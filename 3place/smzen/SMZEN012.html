<h4 id="section">11</h4>
<p>If, because of a sudden illumination that might quell his suspicions,
the blind man entrusted with keeping an account of the ill-gotten gains
of the miscreants had decided to come over to this side with his writing
board, his thick paper and puncher, he would now almost certainly be
occupied in drafting the instructive and lamentable chronicle of the
inadequate diet and the many other privations of these new
fellow-inmates who have been well and truly fleeced. He would begin by
saying that from where he had come, the usurpers had not only expelled
the respectable blind inmates from the ward in order to take possession
of the entire space, but, furthermore, had forbidden the inmates of the
other two wards on the left-hand side any access or use of the
respective sanitary installations, as they are called. He would remark
that the immediate outcome of this infamous tyranny was that all those
poor people would flock to the lavatories on this side, with
consequences easy to imagine for anyone who still remembers the earlier
state of the place. He would point out that it is impossible to walk
through the inner courtyard without tripping over blind inmates getting
rid of their diarrhoea or in contortions from ineffectual straining that
had promised much and in the end resolved nothing, and, being an
observant soul, he would not fail, deliberately, to register the patent
contradiction between the small amount the inmates consumed and the vast
quantity they excreted, perhaps thus showing that the famous
relationship between cause and effect, so often cited, is not, at least
from a quantitative point of view, always to be trusted. He would also
say that while at this hour the ward of this thieving rabble must be
crammed with containers of food, here it will not be long before the
poor wretches are reduced to gathering up crumbs from the filthy floors.
Nor would the blind accountant forget to condemn, in his dual role as
participant in the process and its chronicler, the criminal conduct of
these blind oppressors, who prefer to allow the food to go bad rather
than give it to those who are in such great need, for while it is true
that some of this foodstuff can last for weeks without going off, the
rest, especially the cooked food, unless eaten immediately, soon turns
sour or becomes covered in mould, and is therefore no longer fit for
human consumption, if this sorry lot can still be thought of as human
beings. Changing the subject but not the theme, the chronicler would
write, with much sorrow in his heart, that the illnesses here are not
solely those of the digestive tract, whether from lack of food or
because of poor digestion of what was eaten, most of the people arriving
here, though blind, were not only healthy, but some to all appearances
were positively bursting with health, now they are like the others,
unable to raise themselves from their miserable beds, stricken by
influenza that spread who knows how. And not a single aspirin is there
to be found anywhere in these five wards to lower their temperatures and
relieve the pain of their headaches, what little was left was soon gone,
after one had rummaged even through the lining of the women’s handbags.
Out of discretion, the chronicler would abandon any idea of making a
detailed report of all the other ills that are afflicting most of the
nearly three hundred inmates being kept in this inhumane quarantine, but
he could not fail to mention at least two cases of fairly advanced
cancer, for the authorities had no humanitarian scruples when rounding
up the blind and confining them here, they even stated that the law once
made is the same for everyone and that democracy is incompatible with
preferential treatment. As cruel fate would have it, amongst all these
inmates there is only one doctor, and an ophthalmologist at that, the
last thing we needed. Arriving at this point, the blind accountant,
tired of describing so much misery and sorrow, would let his metal punch
fall to the table, he would search with a trembling hand for the piece
of stale bread he had put to one side while he fulfilled his obligations
as chronicler of the end of time, but he would not find it, because
another blind man, whose sense of smell had become very keen out of dire
necessity, had filched it. Then, renouncing his fraternal gesture, the
altruistic impulse that had brought him rushing to this side, the blind
accountant would decide that the best course of action, if he was still
in time, was to return to the third ward on the left, there, at least,
however much the injustices of those hoodlums stirred up in him feelings
of honest indignation, he would not go hungry.</p>
<p>This is really the crux of the matter. Each time those sent to fetch
the food return to their ward with the meagre rations they have been
given there is an outburst of angry protest. There is always someone who
proposes collective action, a mass demonstration, using the forceful
argument about the cumulative strength of their numbers, confirmed time
and time again and sublimated in the dialectic affirmation that
determined wills, in general merely capable of being added one to the
other, are also very capable in certain circumstances of multiplying
among themselves ad infinitum. However, it was not long before the
inmates calmed down, it was enough that someone more prudent, with the
simple and objective intention of pondering the advantages and risks of
the action proposed, should remind the enthusiasts of the fatal effects
handguns tend to have, Those who went ahead, they would say, would know
what awaits them there, and as for those behind, best not to think of
what might happen in the likely event that we should take fright at the
first shot, more of us would be crushed to death than shot down. As an
intermediate decision, it was decided in one of the wards, and word of
this decision was passed on to the others, that, for the collection of
food, they would not send the usual emissaries who had been subjected to
derision but a sizable group, some ten or twelve persons to be more
precise, who would try to express as one voice, the general discontent.
Volunteers were asked to come forward, but, perhaps because of the
aforementioned warnings of the more cautious, few came forward for this
mission in any of the wards. Fortunately, this patent show of moral
weakness ceased to have any importance, and even to be a cause for
shame, when, proving prudence to be the correct response, the outcome of
the expedition organised by the ward that had thought up the idea became
known. The eight courageous souls who had been so bold were immediately
chased away with cudgels, and while it is true that only one bullet was
fired, it is also true that it was not aimed as high as the first shots,
the proof being that the protesters claimed they had heard it whistle
right past their heads. Whether there had been any intent to kill we
shall perhaps discover later, for the present we shall give the marksman
the benefit of the doubt, that is to say, either that the shot was no
more than a warning, although a more serious one, or the leader of these
rogues underestimated the height of the demonstrators whom he imagined
to be shorter, or, a disconcerting thought, his mistake was to imagine
them taller than they really were, in which case an intent to kill would
inevitably have to be considered. Leaving aside these trifling questions
for the moment and turning to issues of general concern, which are those
that matter, it was truly providential, even if merely a coincidence,
that the protesters should have declared themselves the representatives
of such and such a ward. In this way, only that ward had to fast for
three days as a punishment, and fortunately for them, for they could
have had their provisions cut off for ever, as is only just when someone
dares to bite the hand that feeds him. So, during these three days,
there was no other solution for those from the rebellious ward than to
go from door to door and beg a crust of bread, for pity’s sake, if
possible with a bit of meat or cheese, they did not die of hunger, to be
sure, but they had to take an earful, With ideas like that, what do you
expect, If we had listened to you, where would we be now, but worst of
all was to be told, Be patient, be patient, there are no crueller words,
better to be insulted. And when the three days of punishment were over
and it was thought that a new day was about to dawn, it became clear
that the punishment of that unhappy ward where the forty rebellious
inmates were quartered, was not yet over after all, for the rations
which up until now had barely been enough for twenty, were now reduced
to the point where they would not satisfy the hunger of ten. You can
imagine, therefore, their outrage and indignation, and also, let it hurt
whom it may, facts are facts, the fear of the remaining wards, who
already saw themselves being besieged by the needy, their reactions
divided between the classic duties of human solidarity and the
observance of the ancient and no less time-honoured precept that charity
begins at home.</p>
<p>Things were at this stage when an order came from the hoodlums that
more money and valuables should be handed over inasmuch as they
considered that the food supplies had exceeded the value of the initial
payment, which moreover, according to them, had generously been
calculated to be on the high side. The wards replied in despair that not
so much as a coin was left in their pockets, that all the valuables
collected had been scrupulously handed in, and that, a truly shameful
argument, no decision could be altogether equitable if it were to ignore
the difference in value of the various contributions, that is to say, in
simple language, it was not fair that the upright man should pay for the
sinner, and therefore that they should not cut off the provisions from
someone, who in all probability, still had a balance to their credit.
Obviously, none of the wards knew the value of what had been handed over
by the others, but each ward thought it had every right to go on eating
when the rest had already used up their credit. Fortunately, thanks to
the fact that these latent conflicts were nipped in the bud, the
hoodlums were adamant, their order had to be obeyed by everyone, if
there had been any differences in the evaluation these were known only
to the blind accountant. In the wards the exchanges were heated and
bitter, sometimes becoming violent. Some suspected that certain selfish
and dishonest inmates had withheld some of their valuables when the
collection took place, and therefore had been given food at the expense
of those who had given away everything to benefit the community. Others
alleged, adopting what up until that moment had been a collective
argument, that what they had handed over, should in itself be enough for
them to go on being fed for many days to come, instead of being forced
to feed parasites. The threat made by the blind thugs at the outset,
that they would carry out an inspection of the wards and punish those
who had disobeyed their orders, ended up by being carried out inside
each of the wards, the honest at loggerheads with the dishonest, and
even the malicious. No great fortunes were discovered, but some watches
and rings came to light, mostly belonging to men rather than women. As
for the punishments exacted by internal justice, these were nothing more
than a few random slaps, a few half-hearted and badly aimed punches,
most of the exchanges were verbal insults, some accusing expression
culled from the rhetoric of the past, for example, You’d steal from your
own mother, just imagine, as if a similar ignominy, and others of even
greater consideration would only be committed the day that everyone went
blind, and, having lost the light of their eyes, even lost the guiding
spirit of respect. The blind thugs received the payment with threats of
harsh reprisals, which fortunately they did not carry out, the
assumption being that they had forgotten, when the truth is that they
already had another idea, as would soon be revealed. If they were to
carry out their threats and further injustices, they would aggravate the
situation, perhaps with immediate dramatic consequences, insofar as two
of the wards, in order to conceal their crime of holding back valuables,
presented themselves in the name of others, burdening the innocent wards
with transgressions they had not committed, one of them so honest, in
fact, that it had handed over everything on the first day. Fortunately,
in order to spare himself more work, the blind accountant had decided to
keep note of the various contributions that had just been made on a
single and separate sheet of paper, and this was to everyone’s
advantage, both the innocent and the guilty, for the fiscal irregularity
would almost certainly have caught his attention if he had entered them
against the respective accounts.</p>
<p>After a week, the blind hoodlums sent a message saying that they
wanted women. Just like that, Bring us women. This unexpected demand,
although not altogether unusual, caused an outcry as one might have
expected, the bewildered emissaries who had come with the order returned
at once to communicate that the wards, the three on the right and the
two on the left, not excepting the blind men and women who were sleeping
on the floor, had decided unanimously to ignore this degrading
imposition, arguing that human dignity, in this instance feminine, could
not be debased to this extent, and that if the third ward on the
left-hand side had no women, the responsibility, if any, could not be
laid at their door. The reply was curt and intransigent, Unless you
bring us women, you don’t eat. Humiliated, the emissaries returned to
the wards with this order, Either you go there or they will give us
nothing to eat. The women on their own, those without any partner, or at
least any fixed partner, protested at once, they were not prepared to
pay for the food for other women’s menfolk with what they had between
their legs, one of them was even so bold as to say, forgetting the
respect she owed her own sex, I’ll go there if I want to, but whatever I
may earn is for me, and if I so please, I’ll move in with them, then
I’ll have a bed and my keep assured. These were the unequivocal words
she uttered, but she did not put them into action, she remembered in
time the horrors she would experience if she had to cope on her own with
the erotic frenzy of twenty desperate men whose urgency gave the
impression they were blinded by lust. However, this declaration made so
lightly in the second ward on the right-hand side, did not fall on stony
ground, one of the emissaries, with a particular sense of occasion,
supported her by proposing that women volunteers should come forward for
this service, taking into account that what one does on one’s own
initiative is generally less arduous than if one has to do something
under duress. Only one last scruple, one last reminder of the need for
caution, prevented him from ending his appeal by quoting the well-known
proverb, When the spirit is willing, your feet are light. Even so, no
sooner had he stopped speaking than the protests erupted, anger broke
out on all sides, without pity or compassion, the men were morally
defeated, they were accused of being yobs, pimps, parasites, vampires,
exploiters, panderers, according to the culture, social background and
personal disposition of the women who were rightly indignant. Some of
them declared their remorse at having given in, out of sheer generosity
and compassion, to the sexual overtures of their companions in
misfortune who were now showing their ingratitude by trying to push them
into the worst of fates. The men tried to justify themselves, that it
was not quite like that, that they should not dramatise, what the hell,
by talking things over, people can come to some understanding, it was
only because custom demands that volunteers should be asked to come
forward in difficult and dangerous situations, as this one undoubtedly
is, We are all at risk of dying of hunger, both you and us. Some of the
women calmed down by this reasoning, but one of the others, suddenly
inspired, threw another log on the fire when she asked ironically, And
what would you do if these rascals instead of asking for women had asked
for men, what would you do then, speak up so that everyone can hear. The
women were jubilant, Tell us, tell us, they chorused, delighted at
having backed the men up against the wall, caught in the snares of their
own reasoning from which there was no escape, now they wanted to see how
far that much lauded masculine logic would go, There are no pansies
here, one man dared to protest, And no whores either, retorted the woman
who had asked the provocative question, and even if there were, they
might not be prepared to prostitute themselves for you. Put out, the men
shrugged their shoulders, aware that there was only one answer capable
of satisfying these vindictive women. If they were to ask for men, we
would go, but not one of them had the courage to utter these brief,
explicit and uninhibited words, and they were so dismayed that they
forgot that there was no great harm in saying this, since those sons of
bitches were not interested in relieving themselves with men but with
women.</p>
<p>Now what did not occur to any of the men appeared to have occurred to
the women, there could be no other explanation for the silence that
gradually descended on the ward where these confrontations took place,
as if they had understood that for them, victory in a verbal battle of
wits was no different from the defeat that would inevitably follow,
perhaps in the other wards the debate had been much the same, since we
know that human reason and unreason are the same everywhere. Here, the
person who passed the final judgment was a woman already in her fifties
who had her old mother with her and no other means of providing her with
food, I’ll go, she said, without knowing that these words echoed those
spoken by the doctor’s wife in the first ward on the right-hand side,
I’ll go, there are few women in this ward, perhaps for that reason the
protests were fewer or less vehement, there was the girl with dark
glasses, there was the wife of the first blind man, there was the girl
from the surgery, there was the chambermaid, there was one woman nobody
knew anything about, there was the woman who could not sleep, but she
was so unhappy and wretched that it would be best to leave her in peace,
for there was no reason why only the men should benefit from the women’s
solidarity. The first blind man had begun by declaring that his wife
would not be subjected to the shame of giving her body to strangers in
exchange for whatever, she had no desire to do so nor would he permit
it, for dignity has no price, that when someone starts making small
concessions, in the end life loses all meaning. The doctor then asked
him what meaning he saw in the situation in which all of them there
found themselves, starving, covered in filth up to their ears, ridden
with lice, eaten by bedbugs, bitten by fleas, I, too, would prefer my
wife not to go, but what I want serves no purpose, she has said she is
prepared to go, that was her decision, I know that my manly pride, this
thing we call male pride, if after so many humiliations we still
preserve something worthy of that name, I know that it will suffer, it
already is, I cannot avoid it, but it is probably the only solution, if
we want to live, Each person proceeds according to whatever morals they
have, that’s how I see it and I have no intention of changing my ideas,
the first blind man retorted aggressively. Then the girl with dark
glasses said, The others don’t know how many women are here, therefore
you can keep yours for your exclusive use, we shall feed both you and
her, I’d be interested to see how you feel then about your dignity, how
the bread we bring you will taste, That’s not the point, the first blind
man started to reply, the point is, but his words tailed off, were left
hanging in the air, in reality he did not know what the point was,
everything he had said earlier had been no more than certain vague
opinions, nothing more than opinions belonging to another world, not to
this one, what he ought to do, no doubt about it, was to raise his hands
to heaven thanking fortune that his shame might remain, as it were, at
home, rather than bear the vexation of knowing that he was being kept
alive by the wives of others. By the doctor’s wife, to be absolutely
precise, because as for the rest, apart from the girl with dark glasses,
unmarried and free, about whose dissipated life-style we have more than
enough information, if they had husbands they were not to be seen. The
silence that followed the interrupted phrase seemed to be waiting for
someone to clarify the situation once and for all, for this reason it
was not long before the person who had to speak spoke up, this was the
wife of the first blind man, who said without so much as a tremor in her
voice, I’m no different from the others, I’ll do whatever they do,
You’ll do as I say, interrupted her husband, Stop giving orders, they
won’t do much good here, you’re as blind as I am, It’s indecent, It’s up
to you not to be indecent, from now on you don’t eat, this was her cruel
reply, unexpected in someone who until today had been so docile and
respectful towards her husband. There was a short burst of laughter, it
came from the hotel maid, Ah, eat, eat, what is he to do, poor fellow,
suddenly her laughter turned to weeping, her words changed, What are we
to do, she said, it was almost a question, an almost resigned question
to which there was no answer, like a despondent shaking of the head, so
much so that the girl from the surgery did nothing but repeat, What are
we to do. The doctor’s wife looked up at the scissors hanging on the
wall, from the expression in her eyes you would say she was asking
herself the same question, unless what she was looking for was an answer
to the question she threw back at them, What do you want from me.</p>
<p>However, to everything its proper season, just because you rise early
does not mean that you will die sooner. The blind inmates in the third
ward on the left-hand side are well organised, they had already decided
that they would begin with those closest, with the women from the wards
in their wing. The application of this method of rotation, a more than
apt expression, has all the advantages and no drawbacks, in the first
place, because it will allow them to know, at any given moment, what has
been done and what remains to be done, like looking at a clock and
saying of the day that is passing, I’ve lived from here to here, I’ve so
much or so little left, in the second place, because when the round of
the wards has been completed, the return to the beginning will bring
with it an undeniable air of renovation, especially for those with a
very short sensory memory. So let the women in the wards in the right
wing enjoy themselves, I can cope with the misfortunes of my neighbours,
words that none of the women spoke but which they all thought, in truth,
the human being to lack that second skin we call egoism has not yet been
born, it lasts much longer than the other one, that bleeds so readily.
It also has to be said that these women are enjoying themselves on two
counts, such are the mysteries of the human soul, for the inescapable
impending threat of the humiliation to which they are to be subjected,
aroused and exacerbated in each ward sensual appetites that increasing
familiarity had jaded, it was as if the men were desperately putting
their mark on the women before they were taken off, it was as if the
women wanted to fill their memory with sensations experienced
voluntarily in order to be able better to defend themselves from the
aggression of those sensations which, if they could, they would reject.
It is inevitable that we should ask, taking as an example the first ward
on the right-hand side, how the question of the difference between the
number of men and women was resolved, even discounting the impotent of
the males in the group, as in the case of the old man with the black
eyepatch as well as others, unidentified, both old and young, who for
one reason or another, neither said nor did anything worth bringing into
our narrative. As has already been mentioned, there are seven women in
this ward, including the blind woman who suffers from insomnia and whom
nobody knows, and the so-called normal couples, are no more than two,
which would leave an unbalanced number of men, because the boy with the
squint does not yet count. Perhaps in the other wards there are more
women than men, but an unwritten law, that soon gained acceptance here
and subsequently became statutory decrees that all matters have to be
resolved in the wards in which they have surfaced in accordance with the
precepts of the ancients, whose wisdom we shall never tire of praising,
if you would be well served, serve yourself. Therefore the women from
the first ward on the right-hand side will give relief to the men who
live under the same roof, with the exception of the doctor’s wife, who,
for some reason or other, no one dared to solicit either with words or
an extended hand. Already the wife of the first blind man, after having
made the first move with that abrupt reply she had given her husband,
did, albeit discreetly, what the other women had done, as she herself
had announced. There are, however, certain resistances against which
neither reason nor sentiment can do anything, such as is the case of the
girl with dark glasses, whom the pharmacist’s assistant, however many
arguments he offered, however many pleas he made, was unable to win
over, thus paying for his lack of respect at the outset. This same girl,
there’s no understanding women, who is the prettiest of all the women
here, the one with the shapeliest figure, the most attractive, the one
whom all the men craved when the word about her exceptional looks got
around, finally got into bed one night of her own free will with the old
man with the black eyepatch, who received her like summer rain and
satisfied her as best he could, pretty well given his age, thus proving
once more, that appearances are deceptive, that it is not from someone’s
face and the litheness of their body that we can judge their strength of
heart. Everyone in the ward thought that it was nothing more than an act
of charity that the girl with dark glasses should have offered herself
to the old man with the black eyepatch, but there were men there,
sensitive and dreamers, who having already enjoyed her favours, began to
allow their thoughts to wander, to think there could be no greater prize
in this world than for a man to find himself stretched out on his bed,
all alone, thinking the impossible, only to realise that a woman is
gently lifting the covers and slipping under them, slowly rubbing her
body against his body, and then lying still, waiting for the heat of
their blood to calm the sudden tremor of their startled skin. And all
this for no good reason, just because she wanted to. These are fortunes
that do not go to waste, sometimes a man has to be old and wear a black
eyepatch covering an eye-socket that is definitively blind. And then
there are certain things that are best left unexplained, it’s best just
to say what happened, not to probe people’s inner thoughts and feelings,
as on that occasion when the doctor’s wife had got out of bed to go and
cover up the boy with the squint whose blanket had slipped off. She did
not go back to bed at once. Leaning against the wall at the far end of
the ward, in the narrow space between the two rows of beds, she was
looking in desperation at the door at the other end, that door through
which they had entered on a day that seemed so remote and that now led
nowhere. She was standing there when she saw her husband get up, and,
staring straight ahead as if he were sleepwalking, make his way to the
bed of the girl with dark glasses. She made no attempt to stop him.
Standing motionless, she saw him lift the covers and then lie down,
whereupon the girl woke up and received him without protest, she saw how
those two mouths searched until they found each other, and then the
inevitable happened, the pleasure of the one, the pleasure of the other,
the pleasure of both of them, the muffled cries, she said, Oh, doctor,
and these words could have sounded so ridiculous but did not, he said,
Forgive me, I don’t know what came over me, in fact, we were right, how
could we, who hardly see, know what even he does not know, Lying on the
narrow bed, they could not have imagined that they were being watched,
the doctor certainly could not, he was suddenly worried, would his wife
be asleep, he asked himself, or was she wandering the corridors as she
did every night, he made to go back to his own bed, but a voice said,
Don’t get up, and a hand rested on his chest with the lightness of a
bird, he was about to speak, perhaps about to repeat that he did not
know what had got into him, but the voice said, If you say nothing it
will be easier for me to understand. The girl with dark glasses began to
weep, What an unhappy lot we are, she murmured, and then, I wanted it
too, I wanted it too, you are not to blame, Be quiet the doctor’s wife
said gently, let’s all keep quiet, there are times when words serve no
purpose, if only I, too, could weep, say everything with tears, not have
to speak in order to be understood. She sat on the edge of the bed,
stretched her arm over the two bodies, as if gathering them in the same
embrace, and, bending over the girl with dark glasses, she whispered in
her ear, I can see. The girl remained still, serene, simply puzzled that
she should feel no surprise, it was as if she had known from the very
first day but had not wanted to say so aloud since this was a secret
that did not belong to her. She turned her head ever so slightly and
responded by whispering into the ear of the doctor’s wife, I knew, at
least, I’m not entirely sure, but I think I knew, It’s a secret, you
mustn’t tell a soul, don’t worry, I trust you, And so you should, I’d
rather die than betray you, You must call me “tu,“ Oh, no, I couldn’t, I
simply couldn’t do it. They went on whispering to each other, first one,
then the other, touching each other’s hair, the lobe of the ear, with
their lips, it was an insignificant dialogue, it was a profoundly
serious dialogue, if this contradiction can be reconciled, a brief
conspiratorial conversation that appeared to ignore the man lying
between the two of them, but involved him in a logic outside the world
of commonplace ideas and realities. Then the doctor’s wife said to her
husband, Lie there for a little longer, if you wish, No, I’m going back
to our bed, Then I’ll help you. She sat up to give him greater freedom
of movement, contemplated for an instant the two blind heads resting
side by side on the soiled pillow, their faces dirty, their hair
tangled, only their eyes shining to no purpose. He got up slowly,
looking for support, then remained motionless at the side of the bed,
undecided, as if he had suddenly lost all notion of the place where he
found himself, then she, as she had always done, took him by one arm,
but the gesture now had another meaning, never had he so badly needed
someone to guide him as at this moment, although he would never know to
what extent, only the two women really knew, when the doctor’s wife
stroked the girl’s cheek with her other hand and the girl impulsively
took it and raised it to her lips. The doctor thought he could hear
sobbing, an almost inaudible sound that could have come only from tears
trickling slowly down to the corners of the mouth where they disappear
to recommence the eternal cycle of inexplicable human joys and sorrows.
The girl with dark glasses was about to remain alone, she was the one
who ought to be consoled, for this reason the doctor’s wife was slow to
remove her hand.</p>
<p>Next day, at dinner-time, if a few miserable pieces of stale bread
and mouldy meat deserved such a name, there appeared in the doorway of
the ward three blind men from the other side. How many women have you
got in here, one of them asked, Six, replied the doctor’s wife, with the
good intention of leaving out the blind woman who suffered from
insomnia, but she corrected her in a subdued voice, There are seven of
us. The blind thugs laughed, Too bad, said one of them, you’ll just have
to work all the harder tonight, and another suggested, Perhaps we’d
better go and look for reinforcements in the next ward, It isn’t worth
it, said the third blind man who knew his sums, it works out at three
men for each woman, they can stand it. This brought another burst of
laughter, and the fellow who had asked how many women there were, gave
the order, When you’ve finished, come over to us, and added, That’s if
you want to eat tomorrow and suckle your menfolk. They said these words
in all the wards, and still laughed at the joke with as much gusto as on
the day they had invented it. They doubled up with laughter, stamped
their feet, beat their thick cudgels on the ground, until one of them
suddenly cautioned, Listen here, if any of you has got the curse, we
don’t want you, we’ll leave it until the next time, No one’s got the
curse, the doctor’s wife calmly informed him, Then prepare yourselves
and don’t be long, we’re waiting for you. They turned and disappeared.
The ward remained in silence. A minute later, the wife of the first
blind man said, I cannot eat any more, she had precious little in her
hand, and she could not bear to eat it. Nor me, said the blind woman who
suffered from insomnia, Nor me, said the woman whom nobody seems to
know, I’ve already finished, said the hotel maid, Me too, said the girl
from the surgery, I’ll throw up in the face of the first man who comes
near me, said the girl with dark glasses. They were all on their feet,
shaking and resolute. Then the doctor’s wife said, I’ll go in front. The
first blind man covered his head with the blanket as if this might serve
some purpose, since he was already blind, the doctor drew his wife
towards him and, without saying anything, gave her a quick kiss on the
forehead, what more could he do, it wouldn’t make much difference to the
other men, they had neither the rights nor the obligations of a husband
as far as any of these women were concerned, therefore no one could come
up to them and say, A consenting cuckold is a cuckold twice over. The
girl with dark glasses got in behind the doctor’s wife, then came the
hotel maid, the girl from the surgery, the wife of the first blind man,
the woman no one knows and, finally, the blind woman suffering from
insomnia, a grotesque line-up of foul-smelling women, their clothes
filthy and in tatters, it seems impossible that the animal drive for sex
should be so powerful, to the point of blinding a man’s sense of smell,
the most delicate of the senses, there are even some theologians who
affirm, although not in these exact words, that the worst thing about
trying to live a reasonable life in hell is getting used to the dreadful
stench down there. Slowly, guided by the doctor’s wife, each of them
with her hand on the shoulder of the one in front, the women started
walking. They were all barefoot because they did not want to lose their
shoes amidst the trials and tribulations they were about to endure. When
they arrived in the hallway of the main entrance, the doctor’s wife
headed for the outer door, no doubt anxious to know if the world still
existed. When she felt the fresh air, the hotel maid remembered,
frightened, We can’t go out, the soldiers are out there, and the blind
woman suffering from insomnia said, All the better for us, in less than
a minute we’d be dead, that is how we ought to be, all dead, You mean
us, asked the girl from the surgery, No, all of us, all the women in
here, at least then we’d have the best of reasons for being blind. She
had never had so much to say for herself since she’d been brought here.
The doctor’s wife said, Let’s go, only those who have to die will die,
death doesn’t give any warning when it singles you out. They passed
through the door that gave access to the left wing, they made their way
down the long corridors, the women from the first two wards could, if
they had wished, tell them what awaited them, but they were curled up in
their beds like animals that had been given a good thrashing, the men
did not dare to touch them, nor did they make any attempt to get close,
because the women immediately started screaming.</p>
<p>In the last corridor, at the far end, the doctor’s wife saw a blind
man who was keeping a lookout, as usual. He must have heard their
shuffling footsteps, and informed the others, They’re coming, they’re
coming. From within came cries, whinnying, guffaws of laughter. Four
blind men lost no time in removing the bed that was blocking the
entrance, Quickly, girls, come in, come in, we’re all here like studs in
heat, you’re going to get your bellies filled, said one of them. The
blind thugs surrounded them, tried to fondle them, but fell back in
disarray, when their leader, the one who had the gun, shouted, The first
choice is mine as you well know. The eyes of all those men anxiously
sought out the women, some extended avid hands, if in passing they
happened to touch one of them they finally knew where to look. In the
middle of the aisle, between the beds, the women stood like soldiers on
parade waiting to be inspected. The leader of the blind hoodlums, gun in
hand, came up to them, as agile and frisky as if he were able to see
them. He placed his free hand on the woman suffering from insomnia, who
was first in line, fondled her back and front, her hips, her breasts,
between her legs. The blind woman began to scream and he pushed her
away, You’re a worthless whore. He passed on to the next one, who
happened to be the woman that no one knew, now he was fondling her with
both hands, having put his gun into his trouser pocket, I say, this one
isn’t at all bad, and then he moved on to the wife of the first blind
man, then the employee from the surgery, then the hotel maid, and
exclaimed, Listen, men, these fillies are pretty good. The blind
hoodlums whinnied, stamped their feet on the ground, Let’s get on with
it, it’s getting late, some yelled, Take it easy, said the thug with the
gun, let me first take a look at the others. He fondled the girl with
dark glasses and gave a whistle, Now then, here’s a stroke of luck, no
filly quite like this one has turned up before. Excited, as he went on
fondling the girl, he passed on to the doctor’s wife, gave another
whistle, This one is on the mature side, but could turn out to be quite
a woman. He drew the two women towards him, and almost drooled as he
said, I’ll keep these two, when I’ve finished with them, I’ll pass them
on to the rest of you. He dragged them to the end of the ward, where the
containers of food, packets, tins had been piled up, enough supplies to
feed a regiment. The women, all of them, were already screaming their
heads off, blows, slaps, orders could be heard, Shut up, you whores,
these bitches are all the same, they always have to start yelling, Give
it to her good and hard and she’ll soon be quiet, Just wait until it’s
my turn and you’ll see how they’ll be asking for more, Hurry up there, I
can’t wait another minute. The blind woman suffering from insomnia
wailed in desperation beneath an enormous fellow, the other four were
surrounded by men with their trousers down who were jostling each other
like hyenas around a carcass. The doctor’s wife found herself beside the
bed where she had been taken, she was standing, her trembling hands
gripping the railings of the bed, she watched how the blind leader with
the gun tugged and tore the skirt of the girl with dark glasses, how he
took down his trousers and, guiding himself with his fingers, pointed
his member at the girl’s sex, how he pushed and forced, she could hear
the grunts, the obscenities, the girl with dark glasses said nothing,
she only opened her mouth to vomit, her head to one side, her eyes
turned towards the other woman, he did not even notice what was
happening, the smell of vomit is only noticed when the atmosphere and
all the rest does not smell the same, at last the man shuddered from
head to foot, gave three violent jolts as if he were riveting three
girders, panted like a suffocating pig, he had finished. The girl with
dark glasses wept in silence. The blind man with the gun withdrew his
penis, still dripping and said in a hesitant voice, as he stretched out
his arm to the doctor’s wife, Don’t get jealous, I’ll be dealing with
you next, and then raising his voice, I say, boys, you can come and get
this one, but treat her nicely for I may need her again. Half a dozen
blind men advanced unsteadily along the passageway, grabbed the girl
with dark glasses and almost dragged her away. I’m first, I’m first,
said all of them. The blind man with the gun had sat down on the bed,
his flaccid penis was resting on the edge of the mattress, his trousers
rolled down round his ankles. Kneel down here between my legs, he said.
The doctor’s wife got on to her knees. Suck me, he said, No, she
replied, Either you suck me, or I’ll give you a good thrashing, and you
won’t get any food, he told her, Aren’t you afraid I might bite off your
penis, she asked him, You can try, I have my hands on your neck, I’d
strangle you first if you tried to draw blood, he replied menacingly.
Then he said, I seem to recognise your voice, And I recognise your face,
You’re blind and cannot see me, No, I cannot see you, Then why do you
say that you recognise my face, Because that voice can have only one
face, Suck me, and forget the chitchat, No, Either you suck me, or your
ward won’t see another crumb of bread, go back there and tell them that
if they have nothing to eat it’s because you refused to suck me, and
then come back to tell me what happened. The doctor’s wife leaned
forward, with the tips of two fingers on her right hand she held and
raised the man’s sticky penis, her left hand resting on the floor,
touched his trousers, groped, felt the cold metallic hardness of the
gun, I can kill him, she thought. She could not. With his trousers round
his ankles, it was impossible to reach the pocket where he had put his
weapon. I cannot kill him now, she thought. She moved her head forward,
opened her mouth, closed it, closed her eyes in order not to see and
began sucking.</p>
<p>Day was breaking when the blind hoodlums allowed the women to go. The
blind woman suffering from insomnia had to be carried away in the arms
of her companions, who could scarcely drag themselves along. For hours
they had passed from one man to another, from humiliation to
humiliation, from outrage to outrage, exposed to everything that can be
done to a woman while leaving her still alive. As you know, payment is
in kind, tell those pathetic men of yours that they have to come and
fetch the grub, the blind man with the gun said mockingly as they left.
And he added derisively, See you again, girls, so prepare yourselves for
the next session. The other blind hoodlums repeated more or less in
chorus, See you again, some called them fillies, others whores, but
their waning libido was obvious from the lack of conviction in their
voices. Deaf, blind, silent, tottering on their feet, with barely enough
will-power not to let go of the hand of the woman in front, the hand,
not the shoulder, as when they had come, certainly not one of them would
have known what to reply if they had been asked, Why are you holding
hands as you go, it simply came about, there are gestures for which we
cannot always find an easy explanation, sometimes not even a difficult
one can be found. As they crossed the hallway, the doctor’s wife looked
outside, the soldiers were there as well as a truck that was almost
certainly being used to distribute the food to those in quarantine. Just
at that moment, the blind woman suffering from insomnia lost the power
of her legs, literally, as if they had been cut off with a single blow,
her heart also gave up, it did not even finish the rhythmic contraction
it had started, at last we know why this blind woman could not sleep,
now she will sleep, let us not wake her. She’s dead, said the doctor’s
wife, and her voice was expressionless, if it were possible for such a
voice, as dead as the word it had spoken, to have come from a living
mouth. She raised the suddenly dislocated body, the legs covered in
blood, her abdomen bruised, her poor breasts uncovered, brutally
scarred, teeth marks on her shoulder where she had been bitten. This is
the image of my body, she thought, the image of the body of all the
women here, between these outrages and our sorrows there is only one
difference, we, for the present, are still alive. Where shall we take
her, asked the girl with dark glasses, For the moment to the ward, later
we shall bury her, said the doctor’s wife.</p>
<p>The men were waiting at the door, only the first blind man was
missing, he had covered his head with his blanket once more when he
realised the women were coming back, and the boy with the squint, who
was asleep. Without hesitation, without having to count the beds, the
doctor’s wife laid the blind woman who suffered from insomnia on the bed
she had occupied. She was unconcerned that the others might find it
strange, after all, everyone there knew that she was the blind woman who
was most familiar with every nook and cranny in the place. She’s dead,
she repeated, What happened, asked the doctor, but his wife made no
attempt to answer him, his question might be simply what it appeared to
mean, How did she die, but it could also imply What did they do to you
in there, now, neither for the one nor for the other of these questions
could there be an answer, she simply died, from what scarcely matters,
it is foolish for anyone to ask what someone died from, in time the
cause will be forgotten, only two words remain, She died, and we are no
longer the same women as when we left here, the words they would have
spoken we can no longer speak, and as for the others, the unnameable
exists, that is its name, nothing else. Go and fetch the food, said the
doctor’s wife. Chance, fate, fortune, destiny, or whatever is the
precise term for that which has so many names, is made of pure irony,
how else could we understand why it was precisely the husbands of two of
the women who were chosen to represent the ward and collect their food,
when no one could imagine that the price would be what had just been
paid. It could have been other men, unmarried, free, with no conjugal
honour to defend, but then it had to be these two, who certainly will
not now wish to bear the shame of extending a hand to beg from these
degenerate rogues who have violated their wives. The first blind man
said it, with all the emphasis of a firm decision, Whoever wishes can
go, but I’m not going, I’ll go, said the doctor, I’ll go with you, said
the old man with the black eyepatch. There won’t be much food, but I
warn you it’s quite a weight, I still have the strength to carry the
bread I eat, What always weighs more is the bread of the others, I have
no right to complain, the weight carried by the others will buy me my
food. Let us try to imagine, not the dialogue for that is over and done
with, but the men who took part in it, they are there, face to face, as
if they could see each other, which in this case is impossible, it is
enough that the memory of each of them should bring out from the
dazzling whiteness of the world the mouth that is articulating the
words, and then, like a slow irradiation coming from this centre, the
rest of the faces will start to appear, one an old man, the other not so
old, and anyone who can still see in this way cannot really be called
blind. When they moved off to go and collect the wages of shame, as the
first blind man protested with rhetorical indignation, the doctor’s wife
said to the other women, Stay here, I’ll be right back. She knew what
she wanted, she did not know if she would find it. She needed a bucket
or something that would serve the purpose, she wanted to fill it with
water, even if fetid, even if polluted, she wanted to wash the corpse of
the woman who had suffered from insomnia, to wipe away her own blood and
the sperm of others, to deliver her purified to the earth, if it still
makes sense to speak of the purity of the body in this asylum where we
are living, for purity of the soul, as we know, is beyond everyone’s
reach.</p>
<p>Blind men lay stretched out on the long tables in the refectory. From
a dripping tap over a sink full of garbage, trickled a thread of water.
The doctor’s wife looked around her in search of a bucket or basin but
could see nothing that might serve her purpose. One of the blind men was
disturbed by this presence and asked, Who’s there, She did not reply,
she knew that she would not be welcome, that no one would say, You need
water, then take it, and if it’s to wash the corpse of a dead woman,
take all the water you want. Scattered on the floor were plastic bags,
those used for the food, some of them large. She thought they must be
torn, then reflected that by using two or three, one inside the other,
not much water would be lost. She acted quickly, the blind men were
already getting down from the tables and asking, Who’s there, even more
alarmed when they heard the sound of running water, they headed in that
direction, the doctor’s wife got out of the way and pushed a table
across their path so that they could not come near, she then retrieved
her bag, the water was running slowly, in desperation she forced the
tap, then, as if it had been released from some prison, the water
spurted out, splashed all over the place and soaked her from head to
foot. The blind men took fright and drew back, they thought a pipe must
have burst, and they had all the more reason to think so when the flood
reached their feet, they were not to know that it had been spilled by
the stranger who had entered, as it happened the woman had realised that
she would not be able to carry so much weight. She tied a knot in the
bag, threw it over her shoulder, and, as best she could, fled.</p>
<p>When the doctor and the old man with the black eyepatch entered the
ward with the food, they did not see, could not see, seven naked women
and the corpse of the woman who suffered from insomnia stretched out on
her bed, cleaner than she had ever been in all her life, while another
woman was washing her companions, one by one, and then herself.</p>
