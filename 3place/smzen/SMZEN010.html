<h4 id="section">9</h4>
<p>When, at the beginning, the blind internees in this ward could still
be counted on ten fingers, when an exchange of two or three words was
enough to convert strangers into companions in misfortune, and with
another three or four words they could forgive each other all their
faults, some of them really quite serious, and if a complete pardon was
not forthcoming, it was simply a question of being patient and waiting
for a few days, then it became all too clear how many absurd afflictions
the poor wretches had to suffer, each time their bodies demanded to be
urgently relieved or as we say, to satisfy their needs. Despite this,
and although knowing that perfect manners are somewhat rare and that
even the most discreet and modest natures have their weak points, it has
to be conceded that the first blind people to be brought here under
quarantine, were capable, more or less conscientiously, of bearing with
dignity the cross imposed by the eminently scatological nature of the
human species. Now, with all the beds occupied, all two hundred and
forty, not counting the blind inmates who have to sleep on the floor, no
imagination, however fertile and creative in making comparisons, images
and metaphors, could aptly describe the filth here. It is not just the
state to which the lavatories were soon reduced, fetid caverns such as
the gutters in hell full of condemned souls must be, but also the lack
of respect shown by some of the inmates or the sudden urgency of others
that turned the corridors and other passageways into latrines, at first
only occasionally but now as a matter of habit. The careless or
impatient thought, It doesn’t matter, no one can see me, and they went
no further. When it became impossible in any sense, to reach the
lavatories, the blind internees began using the yard as a place to
relieve themselves and clear their bowels. Those who were delicate by
nature or upbringing spent the whole day restraining themselves, they
put up with it as best they could until nightfall, they presumed it
would be night when most people were asleep in the wards, then off they
would go, clutching their stomachs or squeezing their legs together, in
search of a foot or two of clean ground, if there was any amidst that
endless carpet of trampled excrement, and, to make matters worse, in
danger of getting lost in the infinite space of the yard, where there
were no guiding signs other than the few trees whose trunks had managed
to survive the mania for exploration of the former inmates, and also the
slight mounds, now almost flattened, that barely covered the dead. Once
a day, always in the late afternoon, like an alarm clock set to go off
at the same hour, the voice over the loudspeaker would repeat the
familiar instructions and prohibitions, insist on the advantages of
making regular use of cleansing products, remind the inmates that there
was a telephone in each ward in order to request the necessary supplies
whenever they ran out, but what was really needed there was a powerful
jet from a hose to wash away all that shit, then an army of plumbers to
repair the cisterns and get them working again, then water, lots of
water, to wash the waste down the pipes where it belongs, then, we
beseech you, eyes, a pair of eyes, a hand capable of leading and guiding
us, a voice that will say to me, This way. These blind internees, unless
we come to their assistance, will soon turn into animals, worse still,
into blind animals. This was not spoken by the unknown voice that talked
of the paintings and images of this world, the person saying it, though
in other words, late at night, is the doctor’s wife lying beside her
husband, their heads under the same blanket, A solution has to be found
for this awful mess, I can’t stand it and I can’t go on pretending that
I can’t see, Think of the consequences, they will almost certainly try
to turn you into their slave, a general dogsbody, you will be at the
beck and call of everyone, they will expect you to feed them, wash them,
put them to bed and get them up in the morning and have you take them
from here to there, blow their noses and dry their tears, they will call
out for you when you are asleep, insult you if you keep them waiting,
How can you of all people expect me to go on looking at these miseries,
to have them permanently before my eyes, and not lift a finger to help,
You’re already doing more than enough, What use am I, when my main
concern is that no one should find out that I can see, Some will hate
you for seeing, don’t think that blindness has made us better people, It
hasn’t made us any worse, We’re on our way though, just look at what
happens when it’s time to share out the food, Precisely, someone who can
see could supervise the distribution of food to all those who are here,
share it out with impartiality, with common sense, there would be no
more complaints, these constant arguments that are driving me mad would
cease, you have no idea what it is like to watch two blind people
fighting, Fighting has always been, more or less, a form of blindness,
This is different, Do what you think best, but don’t forget what we are
here, blind, simply blind, blind people with no fine speeches or
commiserations, the charitable, picturesque world of the little blind
orphans is finished, we are now in the harsh, cruel, implacable kingdom
of the blind, If only you could see what I am obliged to see, you would
want to be blind, I believe you, but there’s no need, because I’m
already blind, Forgive me, my love, if you only knew, I know, I know,
I’ve spent my life looking into people’s eyes, it is the only part of
the body where a soul might still exist and if those eyes are lost,
Tomorrow I’m going to tell them I can see, Let’s hope you won’t live to
regret it, Tomorrow I’ll tell them, she paused then added, Unless by
then I, too, have finally entered their world.</p>
<p>But it was not to be just yet. When she woke up next morning, very
early as usual, her eyes could see as clearly as before. All the blind
internees in the ward were asleep. She wondered how she should tell
them, whether she should gather them all together and announce the news,
perhaps it might be preferable to do it in a discreet manner, without
ostentation, to say, for example, as if not wishing to treat the matter
too seriously, Just imagine, who would have thought that I would keep my
sight amongst so many who have turned blind, or whether, perhaps more
wisely, pretend that she really had been blind and had suddenly regained
her sight, it might even be a way of giving the others some hope. If she
can see again, they would say to each other, perhaps we will, too, on
the other hand, they might tell her, If that’s the case, then get out,
be off with you, whereupon she would reply that she could not leave the
place without her husband, and since the army would not release any
blind person from quarantine, there was nothing for it but to allow her
to stay. Some of the blind internees were stirring in their beds and, as
every morning, they were relieving themselves of wind, but this did not
make the atmosphere any more nauseating, saturation point must already
have been reached. It was not just the fetid smell that came from the
lavatories in gusts that made you want to throw up, it was also the
accumulated body odour of two hundred and fifty people, whose bodies
were steeped in their own sweat, who were neither able nor knew how to
wash themselves, who wore clothes that got filthier by the day, who
slept in beds where they had frequently defecated. What use would soaps,
bleach, detergents be, abandoned somewhere around the place, if many of
the showers were blocked or had become detached from the pipes, if the
drains overflowed with the dirty water that spread outside the
wash-rooms, soaking the floorboards in the corridors, infiltrating the
cracks in the flagstones. What madness is this to think of interfering,
the doctor’s wife began to reflect, even if they were not to demand that
I should be at their service, and nothing is less certain, I myself
would not be able to stand it without setting about washing and cleaning
for as long as I had the strength, this is not a job for one person. Her
courage which before had seemed so resolute, began to crumble, to
gradually desert her when confronted with the abject reality that
invaded her nostrils and offended her eyes, now that the moment had come
to pass from words to actions. I’m a coward, she murmured in
exasperation, it would have been better to be blind than go around like
some fainthearted missionary. Three blind internees had got up, one of
them was the pharmacist’s assistant, they were about to take up their
positions in the hallway to collect the allocation of food intended for
the first ward. It could not be claimed, given their lack of eyesight,
that the distribution was made by eye, one container more, one container
less, on the contrary, it was pitiful to see how they got muddled over
the counting and had to start all over again, someone with a more
suspicious nature wanted to know exactly what the others were carrying,
arguments always broke out in the end, the odd shove, a slap for the
blind women, as was inevitable. In the ward everyone was now awake,
ready to receive their ration, with experience they had devised a fairly
easy system of distribution, they began by carrying all the food to the
far end of the ward, where the doctor and his wife had their beds as
well as the girl with dark glasses and the boy who was calling for his
mummy, and that is where the inmates went to fetch their food, two at a
time, starting from the beds nearest the entrance, number one on the
right, number one on the left, number two on the right, number two on
the left, and so on and so forth, without any ill-tempered exchanges or
jostling, it took longer, it is true, but keeping the peace made the
waiting worthwhile. The first, that is to say, those who had the food
right there within arm’s reach, were the last to serve themselves,
except for the boy with the squint, of course, who always finished
eating before the girl with dark glasses received her portion, so that
part of what should have been hers invariably finished up in the boy’s
stomach. All the blind internees had their heads turned towards the
door, hoping to hear the footsteps of their fellow-inmates, the
faltering, unmistakable sound of someone carrying something, but this
was not the noise that could suddenly be heard but rather that of people
running swiftly, were such a feat possible for people who could not see
where they were putting their feet. Yet how else could you describe it
when they appeared panting for breath at the door. What could have
happened out there to send them running in here, and there were the
three of them trying to get through the door at the same time to give
the unexpected news, They wouldn’t allow us to bring the food, said one
of them, and the other two repeated his words, They wouldn’t allow us,
Who, the soldiers, asked some voice or other, No, the blind internees,
What blind internees, we’re all blind here, We don’t know who they are,
said the pharmacist’s assistant, but I think they must belong to the
group that all arrived together, the last group to arrive, And what’s
this about not allowing you to bring the food, asked the doctor, so far
there has never been any problem, They say all that’s over, from now on
anyone who wants to eat will have to pay. Protests came from all sides
of the ward, It cannot be, They’ve taken away our food, The thieves, A
disgrace, the blind against the blind, I never thought I’d live to see
anything like this, Let’s go and complain to the sergeant. Someone more
resolute proposed that they should all go together to demand what was
rightfully theirs, It won’t be easy, said the pharmacist’s assistant,
there are lots of them, I had the clear impression they form a large
group, and the worst is that they are armed, What do you mean by armed,
At the very least they have cudgels, this arm of mine still hurts from
the blow I received, said one of the others, Let’s try and settle this
peacefully, said the doctor, I’ll go with you to speak to these people,
there must be some misunderstanding, Of course, doctor, you have my
support, said the pharmacist’s assistant, but from the way they’re
behaving, I very much doubt that you will be able to persuade them, Be
that as it may, we have to go there, we cannot leave things like this,
I’m coming with you, said the doctor’s wife. The tiny group left the
ward except for the one who was complaining about his arm, he felt that
he had done his duty and stayed behind to relate to the others his
hazardous adventure, their food rations two paces away, and a human wall
to defend them, With cudgels, he insisted.</p>
<p>Advancing together, like a platoon, they forced their way through the
blind inmates from the other wards. When they reached the hallway, the
doctor’s wife realised at once that no diplomatic conversation would be
possible, and probably never likely to be. In the middle of the hallway,
surrounding the containers of food, a circle of blind inmates armed with
sticks and metal rods from the beds, pointing outwards like bayonets or
lances, confronted the desperation of the blind inmates who were
surrounding them and making awkward attempts to force their way through
the line of defence, some with the hope of finding an opening, a gap
someone had been careless enough not to close properly, they warded off
the blows with raised arms, others crawled along on all fours until they
bumped into the legs of their adversaries who repelled them with a blow
to their backs or a vigorous kick. Hitting out blindly, as the saying
goes. These scenes were accompanied by indignant protests, furious
cries, We demand our food, We have a right to eat, Rogues, This is
outrageous, Incredible though it may seem, there was one ingenuous or
distracted soul who said, Call the police, perhaps there were some
policemen amongst them, blindness, as everyone knows, has no regard for
professions or occupations, but a policeman struck blind is not the same
as a blind policeman, and as for the two we knew, they are dead and,
after a great deal of effort, buried. Driven by the foolish hope that
some authority would restore to the mental asylum its former
tranquillity, impose justice, bring back some peace of mind, a blind
woman made her way as best she could to the main entrance and called out
for all to hear, Help us, these rogues are trying to steal our food. The
soldiers pretended not to hear, the orders the sergeant had received
from a captain who had passed through on an official visit could not
have been clearer, If they end up killing each other, so much the
better, there will be fewer of them. The blind woman ranted and raved as
mad women did in bygone days, she herself almost demented, but from
sheer desperation. In the end, realising that her pleas were futile, she
fell silent, went back inside to sob her heart out and, oblivious of
where she was going, she received a blow on the head that sent her to
the floor. The doctor’s wife wanted to run and help her up, but there
was such confusion that she could not move as much as two paces. The
blind internees who had come to demand their food were already beginning
to withdraw in disarray, their sense of direction completely lost, they
tripped over one another, fell, got up, fell again, some did not even
make any attempt, gave up, remained lying prostrate on the ground,
exhausted, miserable, racked with pain, their faces pressed against the
tiled floor. Then the doctor’s wife, terrified, saw one of the blind
hoodlums take a gun from his pocket and raise it brusquely into the air.
The blast caused a large piece of stucco to come crashing down from the
ceiling on to their unprotected heads, increasing the panic. The hoodlum
shouted, Be quiet everyone and keep your mouths shut, if anyone dares to
raise their voice, I’ll shoot straight out, no matter who gets hit, then
there will be no more complaints. The blind internees did not move. The
fellow with the gun continued, Let it be known and there is no turning
back, that from today onwards we shall take charge of the food, you’ve
all been warned, and let no one take it into their head to go out there
to look for it, we shall put guards at the entrance, and anyone who
tries to go against these orders will suffer the consequences, the food
will now be sold, anyone who wants to eat must pay. How are we to pay,
asked the doctor’s wife, I said no one was to speak, bellowed the armed
hoodlum, waving his weapon before him. Someone has to speak, we must
know how we’re to proceed, where are we going to fetch the food, do we
all go together, or one at a time, This woman is up to something,
commented one of the group, if you were to shoot her, there would be one
mouth less to feed, If I could see her, she’d already have a bullet in
her belly. Then addressing everyone, Go back to your wards immediately,
this very minute, once we’ve carried the food inside, we’ll decide what
is to be done, And what about payment, rejoined the doctor’s wife, how
much shall we be expected to pay for a coffee with milk and a biscuit,
She’s really asking for it, that one, said the same voice, Leave her to
me, said the other fellow, and changing tone, Each ward will nominate
two people to be in charge of collecting people’s valuables, all their
valuables of whatever kind, money, jewels, rings, bracelets, earrings,
watches, everything they possess, and they will take the lot to the
third ward on the left, where we are accommodated, and if you want some
friendly advice, don’t get any ideas about trying to cheat us, we know
that there are those amongst you who will hide some of your valuables,
but I warn you to think again, unless we feel that you have handed in
enough, you will simply not get any food and be left to chew your
banknotes and munch on your diamonds. A blind man from the second ward
on the right asked, And what are we to do, do we hand over everything at
once, or do we pay according to what we eat, It would seem I haven’t
explained things clearly enough, said the fellow with the gun, laughing,
first you pay, then you eat and, as for the rest, to pay according to
what you’ve eaten would make keeping accounts extremely complicated,
best to hand over everything at one go and then we shall see how much
food you deserve, but let me warn you again, don’t try to conceal
anything for it will cost you dear, and lest anyone accuses us of not
proceeding honestly, note that after handing over whatever you possess
we shall carry out an inspection, woe betide you if we find so much as a
penny, and now I want everybody out of here as quickly as possible. He
raised his arm and fired another shot. Some more stucco crashed to the
ground. And as for you, said the hoodlum with the gun, I won’t forget
your voice, Nor I your face, replied the doctor’s wife.</p>
<p>No one appeared to notice the absurdity of a blind woman saying that
she won’t forget a face she could not see. The blind internees had
already withdrawn as quickly as they could, in search of the doors, and
those from the first ward were soon informing their fellow-inmates of
the situation, From what we’ve heard, I don’t believe that for the
moment we can do anything other than obey, said the doctor, there must
be quite a number of them, and worst of all, they have weapons. We can
arm ourselves too, said the pharmacist’s assistant, Yes, some sticks cut
from the trees if there are any branches left within arm’s reach, some
metal rods removed from our beds that we shall scarcely have the
strength to wield, while they have at least one firearm at their
disposal, I refuse to hand over my belongings to these sons of a blind
bitch, someone remarked, Nor I, joined in an other, That’s it, either we
all hand over everything, or nobody gives anything, said the doctor, We
have no alternative, said his wife, besides, the régime in here, must be
the same as the one they imposed outside, anyone who doesn’t want to pay
can suit himself, that’s his privilege, but he’ll get nothing to eat and
he cannot expect to be fed at the expense of the rest of us, We shall
all give up what we’ve got and hand over everything, said the doctor,
And what about those who have nothing to give, asked the pharmacist’s
assistant, They will eat whatever the others decide to give them, as the
saying rightly goes, from each according to his abilities, to each
according to his needs. There was a pause, and the old man with the
black eyepatch asked, Well then, who are we going to ask to be in
charge, I suggest the doctor, said the girl with the dark glasses. It
was not necessary to proceed to a vote, the entire ward was in
agreement. There have to be two of us, the doctor reminded them, is
anyone willing to offer, he asked, I’m willing, if no one else comes
forward, said the first blind man, Very well, let us start collecting,
we need a sack, a bag, a small suitcase, any of these things will do, I
can get rid of this, said the doctor’s wife, and began at once to empty
a bag in which she had gathered cosmetics and other odds and ends at a
time when she could never have imagined the conditions in which she was
now obliged to live. Amongst the bottles, boxes and tubes from another
world, there was a pair of long, finely pointed scissors. She could not
remember having put them there, but there they were. The doctor’s wife
raised her head. The blind internees were waiting, her husband had gone
up to the bed of the first blind man, he was talking to him, the girl
with the dark glasses was saying to the boy with the squint that the
food would be arriving soon, on the floor, tucked behind the bedside
table, was a bloodstained sanitary napkin, as if the girl with dark
glasses were anxious, with maidenly and pointless modesty, to hide it
from the eyes of those who could not see. The doctor’s wife looked at
the scissors, she tried to think why she should be staring at them in
this way, in what way, like this, but she could think of no reason,
frankly what reason could she hope to find in a simple pair of long
scissors, lying in her open hands, with its two nickel-plated blades,
the tips sharp and gleaming, Do you have it there, her husband asked
her, Yes, here it is, she replied, and held out the arm holding the
empty bag while she put the other arm behind her back to conceal the
scissors, What’s the matter, asked the doctor, Nothing, replied his
wife, who could just as easily have answered, Nothing you can see, my
voice must have sounded strange, that’s all, nothing else. Accompanied
by the first blind man, the doctor moved towards her, took the bag in
his hesitant hands and said, Start getting your things ready, we’re
about to begin collecting. His wife unclasped her watch, did the same
for her husband, removed her earrings, a tiny ring set with rubies, the
gold chain she wore round her neck, her wedding ring, that of her
husband, both of them easy to remove, Our fingers have got thinner, she
thought, she began putting everything into the bag, then the money they
had brought from home, a fair amount of notes varying in value, some
coins, That’s everything, she said, Are you sure, said the doctor, take
a careful look, That’s everything we have of any value. The girl with
dark glasses had already gathered together her belongings, they were not
so very different, she had two bracelets instead of one, but no wedding
ring. The doctor’s wife waited until her husband and the first blind man
had turned their backs and for the girl with dark glasses to bend down
to the boy with the squint, Think of me as your mummy, she was saying,
I’ll pay for us both, and then she withdrew to the wall at the far end.
There, as all along the other walls, there were large nails sticking out
that must have been used by the mad to hang treasures and other baubles.
She chose the highest nail she could reach, and hung the scissors there.
Then she sat down on her bed. Slowly, her husband and the first blind
man were heading in the direction of the door, they would stop to
collect possessions on both sides from those who had something to offer,
some protested that they were being robbed shamefully, and that was the
honest truth, others divested themselves of their possessions with a
kind of indifference, as if thinking that, all things considered, there
is nothing in this world that belongs to us in an absolute sense,
another all too transparent truth. When they reached the door of the
ward, having finished their collection, the doctor asked, Have we handed
over everything, a number of resigned voices answered yes, some chose to
say nothing and in the fullness of time we shall know whether this was
in order to avoid telling a lie. The doctor’s wife looked up at the
scissors. She was surprised to find them so far up, hanging from one of
the nails, as if she herself had not put them there, then she reflected
that it had been an excellent idea to bring them, now she could trim her
husband’s beard, make him look more presentable, since, as we know,
living in these conditions, it is impossible for a man to shave as
normal. When she looked again in the direction of the door, the two men
had already disappeared into the shadows of the corridor and were making
their way to the third ward on the left, where they had been instructed
to go and pay for their food. Today’s food, tomorrow’s as well, and
perhaps for the rest of the week, And then, the question had no answer,
everything we possessed will have gone in payment.</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, the corridors were not congested as usual,
because normally as the internees left their wards they inevitably
tripped, collided and fell, those assaulted swore, hurled obscenities,
their assailants retaliated with further insults, but no one paid any
attention, a person has to give vent to his feelings somehow, especially
if he is blind. Ahead there was the sound of footsteps and voices, they
must be the emissaries from the other wards who were complying with the
same orders, What a situation we’re in, doctor, said the first blind
man, as if our blindness were not enough, we’ve fallen into the clutches
of blind thieves, that seems to be my fate, first there was the
car-thief, now this rabble who are stealing our food at gunpoint, That’s
the difference, they’re armed, But cartridges don’t last for ever,
Nothing lasts for ever, but in this case it might be preferable if it
did, Why, If the cartridges were to run out, then that would mean that
someone had used them up, and we already have too many corpses, We’re in
an impossible situation, It has been impossible ever since we came into
this place, yet we go on putting up with it, You’re an optimist, doctor,
No, I’m not an optimist, but I cannot imagine anything worse than our
present existence, Well, I’m not entirely convinced that there are
limits to misfortune and evil, You may be right, said the doctor, and
then, as if he were talking to himself, Something has to happen here, a
conclusion that contains a certain contradiction, either there is
something worse than this, after all, or, from now on, things are going
to get better, although all the indications suggest otherwise. Having
steadily made their way and having turned several corners, they were
approaching the third ward. Neither the doctor nor the first blind man
had ever ventured here, but the construction of the two wings, logically
enough, had strictly adhered to a symmetrical pattern, anyone familiar
with the wing on the right would have no difficulty in getting their
bearings in the wing on the left, and vice-versa, you had only to turn
to the left on the one side while on the other you had to turn right.
They could hear voices, they must be of those ahead of them, We’ll have
to wait, said the doctor in a low voice, Why, Those inside will want to
know precisely what these inmates are carrying, for them it is not all
that important, since they have already eaten they’re in no hurry, It
must be almost time for lunch, Even if they could see, it would do this
group no good to know it, they no longer even have watches. A quarter of
an hour later, give or take a minute, the barter was over. Two men
passed in front of the doctor and the first blind man, from their
conversation it was apparent that they were carrying food, Careful,
don’t drop anything, said one of them, and the other was muttering, What
I don’t know is whether there will be enough for everyone. We’ll have to
tighten our belts. Sliding his hand along the wall, with the first blind
man right behind him, the doctor advanced until his hands came into
contact with the door jamb, We’re from the first ward on the right, he
shouted. He made as if to take a step forward, but his leg came up
against an obstacle. He realised it was a bed standing crosswise, placed
there to serve as a trading counter, They’re organised, he thought to
himself, this has not suddenly been improvised, he heard voices,
footsteps, How many of them are there, his wife had mentioned ten, but
it was not inconceivable that there might be many more, certainly not
all of them were there when they went to get the food. The fellow with
the gun was their leader, it was his jeering voice that was saying, Now,
let’s see what riches the first ward on the right has brought us, and
then, in a much lower tone, addressing someone who must have been
standing nearby, Take note. The doctor remained puzzled, what could this
mean, the fellow had said, Take note, so there must be someone here who
can write, someone who is not blind, so that makes two, We must be
careful, he thought, tomorrow this rascal might be standing right next
to us and we wouldn’t even know it, this thought of the doctor’s was
scarcely any different from what the first blind man was thinking, With
a gun and a spy, we’re sunk, we shall never be able to raise our heads
again. The blind man inside, the leader of the thieves, had already
opened the bag, with practised hands he was lifting out, stroking and
identifying the objects and money, clearly he could make out by touch
what was gold and what was not, by touch he could also tell the value of
the notes and coins, easy when one is experienced, it was only after
some minutes that the doctor began to hear the unmistakable sound of
punching paper, which he immediately identified, there nearby was
someone writing in the braille alphabet, also known as anaglyptography,
the sound could be heard, at once quiet and clear, of the pointer as it
punched the thick paper and hit the metallic plate underneath. So there
was a normal blind person amongst these blind delinquents, a blind
person just like all those people who were once referred to as being
blind, the poor fellow had obviously been roped in with all the rest,
but this was not the moment to pry and start asking, are you one of the
recent blind men or have you been blind for some years, tell us how you
came to lose your sight. They were certainly lucky, not only had they
won a clerk in the raffle, they could also use him as a guide, a blind
person with experience as a blind person is something else, he’s worth
his weight in gold. The inventory went on, now and then the thug with
the gun consulted the accountant, What do you think of this, and he
would interrupt his bookkeeping to give an opinion, A cheap imitation,
he would say, in which case the fellow with the gun would comment, If
there is a lot of this, they won’t get any food, or Good stuff, and then
the commentary would be, There’s nothing like dealing with honest
people. In the end, three containers of food were lifted on to the bed,
Take this, said the armed leader. The doctor counted them, Three are not
enough, we used to receive four when the food was only for us, at that
same moment he felt the cold barrel of the gun against his neck, for a
blind man his aim was not bad, I’ll have a container removed every time
you complain, now beat it, take these and thank the Lord that you’ve
still got something to eat. The doctor murmured, Very well, grabbed two
of the containers while the first blind man took charge of the third one
and, much slower now, because they were laden, they re traced the route
that had brought them to the ward. When they arrived in the hallway,
where there did not appear to be anyone around, the doctor said, I’ll
never again have such an opportunity, What do you mean, asked the first
blind man, He put his gun to my neck, I could have grabbed it from him,
That would be risky, Not as risky as it seems, I knew where the gun was
resting, he had no way of knowing where my hands were, even so, at that
moment I’m convinced that he was the blinder of the two of us, what a
pity I didn’t think of it, or did think of it but lacked the courage,
And then what, asked the first blind man, What do you mean, Let’s assume
you had managed to grab his weapon, I don’t believe you would have been
capable of using it, If I were certain it would resolve the situation,
yes I would, But you’re not certain, No, in fact I’m not, Then better
that they should keep their arms, at least so long as they do not use
them against us. To threaten someone with a gun is the same as attacking
them, If you had taken his gun, the real war would have started, and in
all likelihood we would never have got out of that place alive, You’re
right, said the doctor, I’ll pretend I had thought all that through, You
mustn’t forget, doctor, what you told me a little while ago, What did I
say, That something has to happen, It has happened and I didn’t make the
most of it, It has to be something else, not that.</p>
<p>When they entered the ward and had to present the meagre amount of
food they had brought to put on the table, some thought they were to
blame for not having protested and demanded more, that’s why they had
been nominated as the representatives of the group. Then the doctor
explained what had happened, he told them about the blind clerk, about
the insulting behaviour of the blind man with the gun, also about the
gun itself. The malcontents lowered their voices, ended up by agreeing
that undoubtedly the ward’s interests were in the right hands. The food
was finally distributed, there were those who could not resist reminding
the impatient that little is better than nothing, besides, by now it
must be almost time for lunch, The worst thing would be if we got to be
like that famous horse that died when it had already got out of the
habit of eating, someone remarked. The others gave a wan smile and one
said, It wouldn’t be so bad if it’s true that when the horse dies, it
doesn’t know it’s going to die.</p>
