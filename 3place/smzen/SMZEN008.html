<h4 id="section">7</h4>
<p>An empty belly wakes up early. Some of the blind internees opened
their eyes when morning was still some way off, and in their case it was
not so much because of hunger, but because their biological clock, or
whatever you call it, was no longer working properly, they assumed it
was daylight, then thought, I’ve overslept and soon realised that they
were wrong, their fellow-inmates were snoring their heads off, there was
no mistaking that. Now as we know from books, and even more so from
personal experience, anyone who gets up early by inclination or has been
forced to rise early out of necessity finds it intolerable that others
should go on sleeping soundly, and with good reason in the case to which
we are referring, for there is a marked difference between a blind
person who is sleeping and a blind person who has opened his eyes to no
purpose. These observations of a psychological nature, whose subtlety
has no apparent relevance considering the extraordinary scale of the
cataclysm which our narrative is struggling to relate, only serve to
explain why all the blind internees were awake so early, some, as was
said at the outset, were roused by the churning of their empty stomachs
in need of food, others were dragged from their sleep by the nervous
impatience of the early risers, who did not hesitate to make more noise
than the inevitable and tolerable when people cohabit in barracks and
wards. Here there are not only persons of discretion and good manners,
but some real vulgarians who relieve themselves each morning by coughing
up phlegm and passing wind without regard for anyone who might be
present, and if truth be told, they behave just as badly for most of the
day, making the atmosphere increasingly heavy, and there is nothing to
be done, the only opening is the door, the windows cannot be reached
they are so high.</p>
<p>Lying beside her husband, as close as possible given the narrowness
of the bed, but also out of choice, how much it had cost them in the
middle of the night to maintain some decorum, not to behave like those
whom someone had referred to as pigs, the doctor’s wife looked at her
watch. It was twenty-three minutes past two. She took a closer look, saw
that the second hand was not moving. She had forgotten to wind up the
wretched watch, or wretched her, wretched me, for not even this simple
task had she remembered to carry out after only three days of isolation.
Unable to control herself, she burst into convulsive weeping, as if the
worst of all disasters had suddenly befallen her. The doctor thought his
wife had gone blind, that what he so greatly feared had finally
happened, and, beside himself, was on the point of asking, Have you gone
blind, when at the last minute he heard her whisper, No, no, it isn’t
that, it isn’t that, and then in a drawn-out whisper, almost inaudible,
both their heads under the blanket, How stupid of me, I forgot to wind
my watch, and she went on sobbing, inconsolable. Getting up from her bed
on the other side of the passageway, the girl with dark glasses moved in
the direction of the sobbing with arms outstretched, You’re upset, can I
get you anything, she asked as she advanced, and touched the two bodies
on the bed with her hands. Discretion demanded that she should withdraw
immediately, and this certainly was the order that came from her brain,
but her hands did not obey, they simply made more subtle contact, gently
caressing the thick, warm blanket. Can I get you anything, the girl
asked once more, and, by now she had removed her hands, raised them
until they became lost in that sterile whiteness, helpless. Still
sobbing, the doctor’s wife got out of bed, embraced the girl and said,
It’s nothing, I just suddenly felt sad, If you who are so strong are
becoming disheartened, then there really is no salvation for us,
complained the girl. Calmer now, the doctor’s wife thought, looking
straight at her, The signs of conjunctivitis have almost gone, what a
pity I cannot tell her, she would be pleased. Yes, in all probability
she would be pleased, although any such satisfaction would be absurd,
not so much because the girl was blind, but since all the others there
were blind as well, what good would it do her to have beautiful bright
eyes such as these if there is no one to see them. The doctor’s wife
said, We all have our moments of weakness, just as well that we are
still capable of weeping, tears are often our salvation, there are times
when we would die if we did not weep, There is no salvation for us, the
girl with dark glasses repeated, Who can tell, this blindness is not
like any other, it might disappear as suddenly as it came, It will come
too late for those who have died, We all have to die, But not to be
killed and I have killed someone, Don’t blame yourself, it was a
question of circumstances, here we are all guilty and innocent, much
worse was the behaviour of the soldiers who are here to protect us, and
even they can invoke the greatest of all excuses, fear, What if the
wretched fellow did fondle me, he would be alive right now, and my body
would be no different from what it is now, Think no more about it, rest,
try to sleep. She accompanied the girl to her bed, Come now, get into
bed, You’re very kind, said the girl, then lowering her voice, I don’t
know what to do, it’s almost time for my period and I haven’t brought
any sanitary napkins, Don’t worry, I have some. The hands of the girl
with dark glasses searched for somewhere to hold on to, but it was the
doctor’s wife who gently held them in her own hands, Rest, rest. The
girl closed her eyes, remained like that for a minute, she might have
fallen asleep were it not for the quarrel that suddenly erupted, someone
had gone to the lavatory and on his return found his bed occupied, no
harm was meant, the other fellow had got up for the same reason, they
had passed each other on the way, and obviously it did not occur to
either of them to say, Take care not to get into the wrong bed when you
come back. Standing there, the doctor’s wife watched the two blind men
who were arguing, she noticed they made no gestures, that they barely
moved their bodies, having quickly learned that only their voice and
hearing now served any purpose, true, they had their arms, that they
could fight, grapple, come to blows, as the saying goes, but a bed
swapped by mistake was not worth so much fuss, if only all life’s
deceptions were like this one, and all they had to do was to come to
some agreement, Number two is mine, yours is number three, let that be
understood once and for all, Were it not for the fact that we’re blind
this mix-up would never have happened, You’re right, our problem is that
we’re blind. The doctor’s wife said to her husband, The whole world is
right here.</p>
<p>Not quite all of it. The food, for example, was there on the outside
and taking ages to arrive. From both wards, some men had gone to station
themselves in the hallway, waiting for orders to come over the
loudspeaker. They kept shuffling their feet, nervous and impatient. They
knew that they would have to go out to the forecourt to fetch the
containers which the soldiers, fulfilling their promise, would leave in
the area between the main gate and the steps, and they feared that there
might be some ploy or snare, How do we know that they won’t start
firing, After what they’ve done already, they’re capable of anything,
They are not to be trusted, You won’t get me going out there, Nor me,
Someone has to go if we want to eat, I don’t know if it isn’t better to
die being shot than to die of hunger, I’m going, Me too, We don’t all
have to go, The soldiers might not like it, Or get worried and think
we’re trying to escape, that’s probably why they shot the man with the
injured leg, We’ve got to make up our minds, We can’t be too careful,
remember what happened yesterday, nine casualties no more no less, The
soldiers were afraid of us, And I’m afraid of them, What I’d like to
know is if they too go blind, Who’s they, The soldiers, In my opinion
they ought to be the first. They were all in agreement, yet without
asking themselves why, and there was no one there to give them the one
good reason, Because then they would not be able to aim their rifles.
The time passed and passed, and the loudspeaker remained silent. Have
you already tried to bury your dead, a blind man from the first ward
asked for the want of something to say, Not yet, They’re beginning to
smell and infect everything around, Well let them infect everything and
stink to high heaven, as far as I’m concerned, I’ve no intention of
doing anything until I’ve eaten, as someone once said, first you eat
then you wash the pan, That isn’t the custom, your maxim is wrong,
generally it is after burying their dead that the mourners eat and
drink, With me it’s the other way round. After a few minutes one of
these blind men said, There’s one thing that bothers me, What’s that,
How are we going to distribute the food, As we did before, we know how
many we are, the rations are counted, everyone receives his share, it’s
the simplest and fairest way, But it didn’t work, some internees were
left without any food, And there were also those who got double rations,
The distribution was badly organised, It will always be badly organised
unless people show some respect and discipline, If only we had someone
here who could see just a little, Well, he’d try coming up with some
ruse in order to make sure he got the lion’s share, As the saying goes,
in the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, Forget about
sayings, But this is not the same, Here not even the cross-eyed would be
saved, As I see it, the best solution would be to share the food out in
equal parts throughout the wards, then each internee can be
self-sufficient, Who spoke, It was me, Who’s me, Me, which ward are you
from, From ward two, Who would have believed such cunning, since ward
two has fewer patients such an arrangement would be to their advantage
and they would get more to eat than us, since our ward is full, I was
only trying to be helpful, the proverb also says that if the one who
does the sharing out fails to get the better part, he’s either a fool or
a dullard, Shit, that’s quite enough of proverbs, these sayings get on
my nerves, What we should do is to take all the food to the refectory,
each ward elects three of its inmates to do the sharing out, so that
with six people counting there would be little danger of abuse and
deception, And how are we to know that they are telling the truth when
the others say how many there are in their ward, We’re dealing with
honest people, Is that a proverb too, No, that’s me saying it, My dear
fellow, I don’t know about honest but we’re certainly hungry.</p>
<p>As if it had been waiting all this time for the code word, some cue,
an open sesame, the voice finally came over the loudspeaker, Attention,
attention, the internees may come and collect their food, but be
careful, if anyone gets too close to the gate they will receive a
preliminary warning, and unless they turn back immediately, the second
warning will be a bullet. The blind internees advanced slowly, some,
more confident, towards the right where they thought they would find the
door, the others, less sure of their ability to get their bearings,
preferred to slide along the wall, in this way there was no possibility
of mistaking the way, when they reached the corner all they had to do
was to follow the wall at a right angle and there they would find the
door. The hectoring voice over the loudspeaker impatiently repeated the
summons. The change of tone, unmistakable even for those who had no
reason to be suspicious, terrified the blind internees. One of them
declared, I’m not budging from here, what they want to do is to catch us
outside and then kill us all, I’m not moving either, said another, Nor
me, chipped in a third. They were frozen to the spot, undecided, some
wanted to go, but fear was getting the better of all of them. The voice
came again, Unless within the next three minutes someone appears to
collect the containers, we shall take them away. This threat failed to
overcome their fear, only pushed it into the innermost caverns of their
mind, like hunted animals that await an opportunity to attack. Each one
trying to hide behind the other, the blind internees moved fearfully out
on to the landing at the top of the steps. They could not see that the
containers were not alongside the guide rope where they expected to find
them, for they were not to know that the soldiers, out of fear of being
contaminated, had refused to go anywhere near the rope which the blind
internees were holding on to. The food containers were stacked up
together, more or less at the spot where the doctor’s wife had collected
the spade. Come forward, come forward, ordered the sergeant. In some
confusion, the blind internees tried to get into a line so as to advance
in orderly fashion, but the sergeant bellowed at them, You won’t find
the containers there, let go of the rope, let go of it, move over to the
right, your right, your right, fools, you don’t need eyes to know which
side you have your right hand. The warning was given just in time, some
of the blind internees who were punctilious in these matters, had
interpreted the order literally, if it was on the right, logically that
would mean on the right of the person speaking, therefore they were
trying to pass under the rope to go in search of the containers which
were God knows where. In different circumstances, this grotesque
spectacle would have caused the most restrained spectator to burst into
howls of laughter, it was too funny for words, some of the blind
internees advancing on all fours, their faces practically touching the
ground as if they were pigs, one arm outstretched in mid-air, while
others, perhaps afraid that the white space, without a roof to protect
them, would swallow them up, clung desperately to the rope and listened
attentively, expecting to hear at any minute that first exclamation of
triumph once the containers were discovered. The soldiers would have
liked to aim their weapons and, without compunction, shoot down those
imbeciles moving before their eyes like lame crabs, waving their
unsteady pincers in search of their missing leg. They knew what had been
said in the barracks that morning by the regimental commander, that the
problem of these blind internees could be resolved only by physically
wiping out the lot of them, those already there and those still to come,
without any phoney humanitarian considerations, his very words, just as
one amputates a gangrenous limb in order to save the rest of the body,
The rabies of a dead dog, he said, to illustrate the point, is cured by
nature. For some of the soldiers, less sensitive to the beauties of
figurative language, it was difficult to understand what a dog with
rabies had to do with the blind, but the word of a regimental commander,
once again figuratively speaking, is worth its weight in gold, no man
rises to so high a rank in the army without being right in everything he
thinks, says and does. A blind man had finally bumped into the
containers and called out as he got hold of them, They’re here, they’re
here, if this man were to recover his eyesight one day, he would
certainly not announce the wonderful news with greater joy. Within
seconds, the others had pounced on the containers, a confusion of arms
and legs, each man pulling a container towards his side and claiming
priority, I’ll carry it, no, I will. Those who were still holding on to
the rope began to feel nervous, they now had something else to fear,
that they might be excluded on account of their idleness or cowardice,
when the food was shared out, Ah, you men refused to get down on the
ground with your arse in the air and risk the danger of being shot, so
nothing to eat for you, remember the proverb, nothing ventured nothing
gained. Persuaded by these sententious words, one of the blind men let
go of the rope and went, with arms outstretched, in the direction of the
uproar, They’re not going to leave me out, but suddenly the voices fell
silent and there was only the noise of people crawling on the ground,
muffled interjections, a dispersed and confused mass of sounds coming
from everywhere and nowhere. He paused, undecided, tried to go back to
the security of the rope, but he had lost his sense of direction, there
are no stars in his white sky, and what could now be heard was the
sergeant’s voice as it ordered those arguing over the containers to get
back to the steps, for what he was saying could have been meant only for
them, to arrive where you want to be, everything depends on where you
are. There were no longer any blind internees holding on to the rope,
all they had to do was to return the way they had come, and now they
were waiting at the top of the steps for the others to arrive. The blind
man who had lost his way did not dare to move from where he was. In a
state of anguish, he let out a loud cry, Please, help me, unaware that
the soldiers had their rifles trained on him as they waited for him to
tread on that invisible line dividing life from death. Are you going to
stay there all day, you blind bat, asked the sergeant, in a somewhat
nervous voice, the truth being that he did not share the opinion of his
commander, Who can guarantee that the same fate won’t come knocking at
the door tomorrow, as for the soldiers it is well known that they need
only to be given an order and they kill, to be given another order and
they die, You will shoot only when I say so, the sergeant shouted. These
words made the blind man realise that his life was in danger. He fell to
his knees and beseeched them, Please help me, tell me where I have to
go, Keep on walking, blind man, keep on walking this way, a soldier
called from beyond in a tone of false camaraderie, the blind man got up,
took three paces, then suddenly came to another halt, the tense of the
verb aroused his suspicion, keep on walking this way is not the same as
keep going, keep on walking this way tells you that this way, this very
way, in this direction, you will arrive where you are being summoned,
only to come up against the bullet that will replace one form of
blindness with another. This initiative, which we might well describe as
criminal, was taken by a soldier of disreputable character, whom the
sergeant immediately rebuked with two sharp commands given successively,
Halt, Half turn, followed by a severe call to order directed at this
disobedient fellow, who to all appearances belonged to that class of
people who are not to be trusted with a rifle. Encouraged by the
sergeant’s kind intervention, the blind internees who had reached the
top of the steps suddenly made a tremendous racket which served as a
magnetic pole for the blind man who had lost his way. Now more sure of
himself, he advanced in a straight line, Keep on shouting, keep on
shouting, he beseeched them, while the other blind internees applauded
as if they were watching someone complete a long, dynamic but exhausting
sprint. He was given a rapturous welcome, the least they could do, in
the face of adversity, whether proven or foreseeable, you know who your
friends are.</p>
<p>This camaraderie did not last long. Taking advantage of the uproar,
some of the blind internees had sneaked off with a number of containers,
as many as they could carry, a patently disloyal way of forestalling any
hypothetical injustices in the distribution. Those of good faith, who
are always to be found no matter what people may say, protested with
indignation, that they couldn’t live like this, If we cannot trust each
other, where are we going to end up? some asked rhetorically, although
with full justification, What these rogues are asking for is a good
hiding, threatened others, they had not asked for any such thing, but
everyone understood what those words meant, an inaccurate expression
that can be tolerated only because it is so very apt. Already gathered
in the hallway, the blind internees came to an agreement, this being the
most practical way of resolving the first part of the difficult
situation in which they found themselves, that they would distribute the
remaining containers equally between the two wards, fortunately an even
number, and set up a committee, also on an equal basis, to carry out an
investigation with a view to recovering the missing, that is to say,
stolen containers. They wasted some time in debate, as was becoming
their habit, the before and the after, that is to say, whether they
should eat first and then investigate, or the other way round, the
prevailing opinion being that, taking into account all the hours of
enforced fasting they had spent, it would be more convenient to start by
satisfying their stomachs and then proceeding with their inquiries, And
don’t forget that you have to bury your dead, said someone from the
first ward, We haven’t killed them yet and you want us to bury them,
replied one witty fellow, amusing himself with this play on words.
Everyone laughed. However they were soon to discover that the culprits
were not to be found in the wards. At the doors of both wards, waiting
for their food to arrive, the blind internees claimed to have heard
passing along the corridors people who seemed to be in a great hurry,
but no one had entered the wards, much less carrying containers of food,
that they could swear to. Someone remembered that the safest way of
identifying these fellows would be if they were all to return to their
respective beds, obviously those that remained unoccupied must belong to
the thieves, so all they had to do was to wait until they returned from
wherever they had been hiding and licking their chops and then pounce on
them, so that they might learn to respect the sacred principle of
collective property. To proceed with this plan, however opportune and in
keeping with a deep seated sense of justice, had one serious
disadvantage insofar as it would mean postponing, no one could foresee
for how long, that much desired breakfast, already gone cold. Let’s eat
first, suggested one of the blind men, and the majority agreed that it
was better that they should eat first. Alas, only the little that had
remained after that infamous theft. At this hour, in some hiding place
amongst these old and dilapidated buildings, the thieves must be gorging
themselves on double and triple rations that unexpectedly seemed to have
improved, consisting of coffee with milk, cold in fact, biscuits and
bread with margarine, while decent folk had to content themselves with
two or three times less, and not even that. Outside the loudspeaker
could be heard summoning the contagious to fetch their food rations, the
sound also reached some of the internees in the first wing, as they were
sadly chewing on water biscuits. One of the blind men, undoubtedly
influenced by the unwholesome atmosphere left by the theft of food, had
an idea, If we were to wait in the hallway, they would get the fright of
their lives just to see us there, they might even drop the odd
container, but the doctor said he did not think this would be right, it
would be an injustice to punish those without blame. When they had all
finished eating, the doctor’s wife and the girl with dark glasses
carried the cardboard containers into the yard, the empty flasks of milk
and coffee, the paper cups, in a word, everything that could not be
eaten. We must burn the rubbish, the doctor’s wife then suggested, and
get rid of these horrible flies.</p>
<p>Seated on their respective beds, the blind internees settled down to
wait for the pack of thieves to return, Thieving dogs, that’s what they
are, commented a rough voice, unaware that he was responding to a
reminiscence of someone who is not to blame for not knowing how to say
things in any other manner. But the scoundrels did not appear, they must
have suspected something, suspicions no doubt raised by some astute
fellow amongst them like the one here who suggested giving them a good
hiding. The minutes went by, several of the blind men had stretched out,
some were already asleep. For this, my friends, is what it means to eat
and sleep. All things considered, things could be worse. So long as they
go on supplying us with food, for we cannot live without it, this is
like being in a hotel. By contrast, what a torment it would be for a
blind man out there in the city, yes, a real torment. Stumbling through
the streets, everyone fleeing at the very sight of him, his family in a
panic, terrified of approaching him, a mother’s love, a child’s love, a
myth, they would probably treat me just as I am treated in this place,
lock me up in a room and, if I was very lucky, leave a plate outside the
door. Looking at the situation objectively, without preconceptions or
resentments which always cloud our reasoning, it had to be acknowledged
that the authorities had shown great vision when they decided to unite
the blind with the blind, each with his own, which is a wise rule for
those who have to live together, like lepers, and there can be no doubt
that the doctor there at the far end of the ward is right when he says
that we must organise ourselves, the question, in fact, is one of
organisation, first the food, then the organisation, both are
indispensable for life, to choose a number of reliable men and women and
put them in charge, to establish approved rules for our co-existence
here in the ward, simple things, like sweeping the floor, tidying up and
washing, we’ve nothing to complain about there, they have even provided
us with soap and detergent, making sure our beds are always made, the
important thing is not to lose our self-respect, to avoid any conflict
with the soldiers who are only doing their duty by keeping us under
guard, we do not want any more casualties, asking around if there is
anyone willing to entertain us in the evening with stories, fables,
anecdotes, whatever, just think how fortunate we would be if someone
knew the Bible by heart, we could repeat everything since the creation
of the world, the important thing is that we should listen to one
another, pity we haven’t a radio, music has always been a great
distraction, and we could follow the news bulletins, for example, if a
cure were to be discovered for our illness, how we should rejoice.</p>
<p>Then the inevitable happened. They heard shots being fired in the
street, They’re coming to kill us, someone shouted, Calm down, said the
doctor, we must be logical, if they wanted to kill us, they would come
here to shoot us, not outside. The doctor was right, it was the sergeant
who had given the order to shoot in the air, not some soldier who had
suddenly been struck blind when his finger was on the trigger, clearly
there was no other way of controlling and intimidating the new internees
as they stumbled from the vans, the Ministry of Health had informed the
Ministry of Defence, We’re despatching four van-loads, And how many does
that make, About two hundred internees, Where are all these people going
to be accommodated, the wards reserved for the blind internees are the
three in the wing on the right, according to the information we’ve been
given, the total capacity is one hundred and twenty, and there are
already some sixty to seventy internees inside, minus a dozen or so whom
we were obliged to kill, There is one solution, open up all the wards,
That would mean the contaminated coming into direct contact with those
who are blind, In all probability, sooner or later, the former will also
go blind, besides, the situation being as it is, I suppose we’ll all be
contaminated, there cannot be a single person who has not been within
sight of a blind man, If a blind man cannot see, I ask myself, how can
he transmit this disease through his sight, General, this must be the
most logical illness in the world, the eye that is blind transmits the
blindness to the eye that sees, what could be simpler, We have a colonel
here who believes the solution would be to shoot the blind as soon as
they appear, Corpses instead of blind men would scarcely improve the
situation, To be blind is not the same as being dead, Yes, but to be
dead is to be blind, So there are going to be about two hundred of them,
Yes, And what shall we do with the taxi-drivers, Put them inside as
well. That same day, in the late afternoon, the Ministry of Defence
contacted the Ministry of Health, Would you like to hear the latest
news, that colonel we mentioned earlier has gone blind, It’ll be
interesting to see what he thinks of that bright idea of his now, He
already thought, he shot himself in the head, Now that’s what I call a
consistent attitude, The army is always ready to set an example.</p>
<p>The gate had been opened wide. In keeping with barracks routine, the
sergeant ordered that a column should be formed five deep, but the blind
internees were unable to get the numbers right, sometimes they were more
than five, at other times less, and they all ended up by crowding around
the entrance, like the civilians they were, without any sense of order,
they did not even remember to send the women and children ahead, as in
other shipwrecks. It has to be said before we forget, that not all of
the gunshots had been fired in the air, one of the van-drivers had
refused to go with the blind internees, he protested that he could see
perfectly well, the outcome, three seconds later, was to prove the point
made by the Ministry of Health when it decreed that to be dead is to be
blind. The sergeant gave the aforementioned orders, Keep going, there’s
a stairway with six steps, when you get there, go slowly up the steps,
if anyone trips, who knows what will happen, the only recommendation
overlooked was that they should follow the rope, but clearly if they had
used it they would have taken forever to enter, Listen, cautioned the
sergeant, his mind at rest because all of them were already inside the
gate, there are three wards on the right and three on the left, each
ward has forty beds, families should stay together, avoid crowding, wait
at the entrance and ask those who are already interned for assistance,
everything is going to be all right, settle in and keep calm, keep calm,
your food will be delivered later.</p>
<p>It would not be right to imagine that these blind people, in such
great numbers, proceed like lambs to the slaughter, bleating as is their
wont, somewhat crowded, it is true, yet that is how they had always
existed, cheek by jowl, mingling breaths and smells, There are some here
who cannot stop crying, others who are shouting in fear or rage, others
who are cursing, someone uttered a terrible, futile threat, If I get my
hands on you, presumably he was referring to the soldiers, I’ll gouge
your eyes out. Inevitably, the first internees to reach the stairway had
to probe with one foot, the height and depth of the steps, the pressure
of those coming from behind knocked two or three of those in front to
the ground, fortunately nothing more serious occurred, nothing except a
few grazed shins, the sergeant’s advice had proved to be a blessing. A
number of the new arrivals had already entered the hallway, but two
hundred persons cannot be expected to sort themselves out all that
easily, moreover blind and without a guide, this painful situation being
made even worse by the fact that we are in an old building and badly
designed at that, it is not enough for a sergeant who knows only about
military affairs to say, there are three wards on each side, you have to
know what it’s like inside, doorways so narrow that they look more like
bottlenecks, corridors as crazy as the other inmates of the asylum,
opening for no clear reason and closing who knows where, and no one is
ever likely to find out. Instinctively, the vanguard of blind internees
had divided into two columns, moving on both sides along the walls in
search of a door they might enter, a safe method, undoubtedly, assuming
there are no items of furniture blocking the way. Sooner or later, with
know-how and patience, the new inmates will settle in, but not before
the latest battle has been won between the first lines of the column on
the left and the contaminated confined to that side. It was only to be
expected. There was an agreement, there was even a regulation drawn up
by the Ministry of Health, that this wing would be reserved for the
contaminated, and if it was true that it could be foreseen that in all
likelihood, every one of them would end up blind, it was also true, in
terms of pure logic, that until they became blind there was no guarantee
that they were fated to blindness. There is then a person sitting
peacefully at home, confident that at least in his case all will turn
out well, when suddenly he sees coming directly towards him a howling
mob of the people he most fears. At first, the contaminated thought this
was a group of inmates like themselves, only more numerous, but the
deception was short-lived, these people were blind all right, You can’t
come in here, this wing is ours, it isn’t for the blind, you belong to
the wing on the other side, shouted those on guard at the door. Some of
the blind internees tried to do a turnaround and find another entrance,
they didn’t care if they went left or right, but the mass of those who
continued to flock in from outside, jostled them relentlessly. The
contaminated defended the door with punches and kicks, the blind
retaliated as best they could, they could not see their adversaries, but
knew where the blows were coming from. Two hundred people could not get
into the hallway, or anything like that number, so it was not long
before the door leading to the courtyard, despite being fairly wide, was
completely blocked, as if obstructed by a plug, they could go neither
backwards nor forwards, those who were inside, crushed and flattened,
tried to protect themselves by kicking and elbowing their neighbours,
who were suffocating, cries could be heard, blind children were sobbing,
blind mothers were fainting, while the vast crowd that had been unable
to enter pushed even harder, terrified by the bellowing of the soldiers,
who could not understand why those idiots had not gone through. There
was one terrible moment of violent backsurge as people struggled to
extricate themselves from the confusion, from the imminent danger of
being crushed, let us put ourselves in the place of the soldiers,
suddenly they see a considerable number of those who had entered come
hurtling out, they immediately thought the worst, that the new arrivals
were about to turn back, let us remember the precedents, there might
well have been a massacre. Fortunately, the sergeant was once more equal
to the crisis, he himself fired into the air, simply to attract
attention, and shouted over the loudspeaker, Calm down, those on the
steps should draw back a little, clear the way, stop pushing and try to
help each other. That was asking too much, the struggle inside
continued, but the hallway gradually emptied thanks to a much greater
number of blind internees moving to the door of the right wing, there
they were received by blind inmates who were happy to direct them to the
third ward, so far free, or to the beds in the second ward which were
still unoccupied. For one moment it looked as if the battle would be
resolved in favour of the contaminated, not because they were stronger
and had more sight, but because the blind internees, having perceived
that the entrance on the other side was less encumbered, broke off all
contacts, as the sergeant would say in his discussions about strategy
and basic military tactics. However, the triumph of the defenders was of
short duration. From the door of the right wing came voices announcing
that there was no more room, that all the wards were full, there were
even some blind internees still being pushed into the hallway, precisely
at that moment when, once the human stopper up until then blocking the
main entrance dispersed, once the considerable number of blind internees
who were outside, were able to advance and take shelter under the roof
where, safe from the threats of the soldiers, they would live. The
result of these two displacements, practically simultaneous, was to
rekindle the struggle at the entrance of the wing on the left-hand side,
once again blows were exchanged, once more there were shouts, and, as if
this were not enough, in their confusion some of the bewildered blind
internees, who had found and forced open the hallway door leading
directly into the inner courtyard, cried out that there were corpses out
there. Imagine their horror. They withdrew as best they could, There are
corpses out there, they repeated, as if they would be the next to die,
and, within a second, the hallway was once more the raging whirlpool it
had been at its worst, then, in a sudden and desperate impulse, the
human mass swerved towards the wing on the left, carrying all before it,
the resistance of the contaminated broken, many of them no longer merely
contaminated, others, running like madmen, were still trying to escape
their black destiny. They ran in vain. One after the other they were
stricken with blindness, their eyes suddenly drowned in that hideous
white tide inundating the corridors, the wards, the entire space. Out
there in the hallway, in the yard, the blind internees, helpless, some
badly bruised from the blows, others from being trampled, dragged
themselves along, most of them were elderly, many women and children,
beings with few or no defences, and it was nothing short of a miracle
that there were not more corpses in need of burial. Scattered on the
ground, apart from some shoes that had lost their feet, lie bags,
suitcases, baskets, each individual’s bit of wealth, lost for ever,
anyone coming across these objects will insist that what he is carrying
is his.</p>
<p>An old man with a black patch over one eye, came in from the yard.
He, too, had either lost his luggage or had not brought any. He had been
the first to stumble over the corpses, but he did not cry out. He
remained beside them and waited for peace and silence to be restored. He
waited for an hour. Now it is his turn to seek shelter. Slowly, with his
arms outstretched, he searched for the way. He found the door of the
first ward on the right-hand side, heard voices coming from within, then
asked, Any chance of a bed here.</p>
