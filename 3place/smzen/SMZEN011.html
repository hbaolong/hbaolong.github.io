<h4 id="section">10</h4>
<p>The old man with the black eyepatch had understood that the portable
radio, as much for the fragility of its structure as for the information
known about the length of its useful life, was to be excluded from the
list of valuables they had to hand over in payment for their food, in
consideration of the fact that the usefulness of the set depended in the
first place on whether there were or were not batteries inside and, in
the second place, on how long they would last. Judging by the rather
husky voices still coming from the tiny box, it was obvious that little
more could be expected of it. Therefore the old man with the black
eyepatch decided not to have any more general broadcasts, additionally
because the blind internees in the third ward on the left might turn up
and take a different view, not owing to the material value of the set,
which is virtually negligible in the short term, as we have seen, but
owing to its immediate utility, which is undoubtedly considerable, not
to mention the feasible hypothesis that where there is at least one gun
there might also be batteries. So the old man with the black eyepatch
said that, from now on, he would listen to the news under the blanket,
with his head completely covered, and that if there were any interesting
news-item, he would alert the others at once. The girl with dark glasses
asked him to allow her to listen to a little music from time to time, So
as not to forget, she argued, but he was inflexible, insisted that the
important thing was to know what was going on outside, anyone who wanted
music could listen to it in their own head, after all our memory ought
to be put to some good use. The old man with the black eyepatch was
right, the music on the radio was already as grating as only a painful
memory can be, so for this reason he kept the volume as low as possible,
waiting for the news to come on. Then he turned the sound up a little
and listened attentively so as not to lose a single syllable. Then he
summarised the news-items in his own words, and transmitted them to his
immediate neighbours. And so from bed to bed, the news slowly circulated
round the ward, increasingly distorted as it was passed on from one
inmate to the next, in this way diminishing or exaggerating the details,
according to the personal optimism or pessimism of those relaying the
information. Until that moment when the words dried up and the old man
with the black eyepatch found he had nothing more to say. And it was not
because the radio had broken down or the batteries were used up,
experience of life and lives has convincingly shown that no one can
govern time, it was unlikely that this tiny set would last long, but
finally someone fell silent before it went dead. Throughout this first
day spent in the clutches of those blind thugs, the old man with the
black eyepatch had been listening to the radio and passing on the news,
rejecting the patent falseness of the optimistic prophecies being
officially communicated and now, well into the night, with his head out
of the blanket at last, he was listening carefully to the wheeze into
which the waning power of the radio had transformed the announcer’s
voice, when suddenly he heard him call out, I’m blind, then the noise of
something striking the microphone, a hasty sequence of confused sounds,
exclamations, then sudden silence. The only radio station he had been
able to get on the set had gone silent. For some time to come, the old
man with the black eyepatch kept his ear to the box that was now inert,
as if waiting for the announcer’s voice to return and for the news to
continue. However, he sensed, or rather knew, that it would return no
more. The white sickness had not only blinded the announcer. Like a line
of gunpowder, it had quickly and successively reached all those who
happened to be in the studio. Then the old man with the black eyepatch
dropped the radio on the floor. The blind thugs, if they were to come
sniffing out hidden jewels, would find justification, had such a thought
crossed their mind, for the omission of portable radios from their list
of valuables. The old man with the black eyepatch pulled the blanket up
over his head so that he could weep freely.</p>
<p>Little by little, under the murky yellowish light of the dim lamps,
the ward descended into a deep slumber, bodies comforted by the three
meals consumed that day, as had rarely happened before. If things
continue like this, we’ll end up once more reaching the conclusion that
even in the worst misfortunes it is possible to find enough good to be
able to bear the aforesaid misfortunes with patience, which, applied to
the present situation, means that contrary to the first disquieting
predictions, the concentration of food supplies into a single entity for
apportioning and distribution, had its positive aspects, after all,
however much certain idealists might protest that they would have
preferred to go on struggling for life by their own means, even if their
stubbornness meant going hungry. Unconcerned about tomorrow, forgetful
that he who pays in advance always ends up being badly served, the
majority of the blind internees, in all the wards, slept soundly. The
others, tired of searching in vain for an honourable way out of the
vexations suffered, also fell asleep one by one, dreaming of better days
than these, days of greater freedom if not of greater abundance. In the
first ward on the right, only the doctor’s wife was still awake. Lying
on her bed, she was thinking about what her husband had told her, when
for a moment he suspected that amongst the blind thieves there was
someone who could see, someone whom they might use as a spy. It was
curious that they had not touched on the subject again, as if it had not
occurred to the doctor, accustomed as he was to the fact, that his own
wife could still see. It crossed her mind, but she said nothing, she had
no desire to utter the obvious words, What he is unable to do after all,
I can do. What is that, the doctor would ask, pretending not to
understand. Now, with her eyes fixed on the scissors hanging on the
wall, the doctor’s wife was asking herself, What use is my eyesight, It
had exposed her to greater horror than she could ever have imagined, it
had convinced her that she would rather be blind, nothing else. Moving
cautiously, she sat up in bed. Opposite her, the girl with the dark
glasses and the boy with the squint were asleep. She noticed that the
two beds were very close together, the girl had pushed hers over, almost
certainly to be closer to the boy should he need to be comforted or have
someone to dry his tears in the absence of his mother. Why did I not
think of it before, I could have pushed our beds together and we could
have slept together, without this constant worry that he might fall out
of bed. She looked at her husband, who was fast asleep, in a deep sleep
from sheer exhaustion. She had not got round to telling him that she had
brought the scissors, that one of these days she would have to trim his
beard, a task that even a blind man is capable of carrying out so long
as he does not bring the blades too close to his skin. She has found a
good excuse for not mentioning the scissors, Afterwards all the men here
would be pestering me and I’d find myself doing nothing except trimming
beards. She swung her body outwards, rested her feet on the floor and
searched for her shoes. As she was about to slip them on, she held back,
stared at them closely, then shook her head and, without mak ing a
noise, put them back. She passed along the aisle between the beds and
slowly made her way towards the door of the ward. Her bare feet came
into contact with the slimy excrement on the floor, but she knew that
out there in the corridors it would be much worse. She kept looking from
one side to the other, to see if any of the blind internees were awake,
although whether several of them might be keeping vigil, or the entire
ward, was of no importance so long as she did not make a noise, and even
if she did, we know how pressing our bodily needs can be, they do not
choose their hour, in a word, what she did not want was that her husband
should wake up and sense her absence in time to ask her, Where are you
going, which is probably the question husbands most frequently put to
their wives, the other being Where have you been, One of the blind women
was sitting up in bed, her shoulders resting against the low head-rest,
her empty gaze fixed on the wall opposite, but she could not see it. The
doctor’s wife paused for a moment, as if not sure whether to touch that
invisible thread that hovered in the air, as if the slightest contact
would irrevocably destroy it. The blind woman raised her arm, she must
have perceived some gentle vibration in the atmosphere, then she let it
drop, no longer interested, it was enough not to be able to sleep
because of her neighbours’ snoring. The doctor’s wife continued walking
in ever greater haste as she approached the door. Before heading for the
hallway, she looked along the corridor that led to the other wards on
this side, further ahead, to the lavatories, and ultimately to the
kitchen and refectory. There were blind inmates lying up against the
walls, those who on arrival had been unsuccessful in finding a bed,
either because in the assault they had lagged behind, or because they
lacked the strength to contest a bed and win their battle. Ten metres
away, a blind man was lying on top of a blind woman, the man caught
between her legs, they were being as discreet as they could, they were
the discreet kind, but you would not have needed very sharp hearing to
know what they were up to, especially when first one and then the other
could no longer repress their sighs and groans, some inarticulate word,
which are the signs that all that is about to end. The doctor’s wife
stopped in her tracks to watch them, not out of envy, she had her
husband and the satisfaction he gave her, but because of an impression
of another order, for which she could find no name, perhaps a feeling of
sympathy, as if she were thinking of saying to them, Don’t mind my being
here, I also know what this means, continue, perhaps a feeling of
compassion, Even if this instant of supreme pleasure should last you a
lifetime, you will never become united as one. The blind man and the
blind woman were now resting, apart, the one lying beside the other, but
they were still holding hands, they were young, perhaps even lovers who
had gone to the cinema and turned blind there, or perhaps some
miraculous coincidence brought them together in this place, and, this
being the case, how did they recognise each other, good heavens, by
their voices, of course, it is not only the voice of blood that needs no
eyes, love, which people say is blind, also has a voice of its own. In
all probability, though, they were taken at the same time, in which case
those clasped hands are not something recent, they have been clasped
since the beginning.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife sighed, raised her hands to her eyes, she had to
because she could barely see, but she was not alarmed, she knew they
were only tears. Then she continued on her way. On reaching the hallway,
she went up to the door leading to the courtyard. She looked outside.
Behind the gate there was a light which outlined the black silhouette of
a soldier. On the other side of the street, the buildings were all in
darkness. She went out on to the top of the steps. There was no danger.
Even if the soldier were to become aware of her shadow, he would only
shoot if she, having descended the stairs, were to get nearer, after
being warned, from that other invisible line which represented for him
the frontier of his safety. Accustomed now to the constant noises in the
ward, the doctor’s wife found the silence strange, a silence that seemed
to occupy the space of an absence, as if humanity, the whole of
humanity, had disappeared, leaving only a light and a soldier keeping
watch over it. She sat on the ground, her back resting against the door
jamb, in the same position in which she had seen the blind woman in the
ward, and stared ahead like her. The night was cold, the wind blew along
the front of the building, it seemed impossible that there should still
be wind in this world, that the night should be black, she wasn’t
thinking of herself, she was thinking of the blind for whom the day was
endless. Above the light, another silhouette appeared, it was probably
the guard’s relief, Nothing to report, the soldier would be saying
before going off to his tent to get some sleep, neither of them had any
idea what was happening behind that door, probably the noise of the
shots had not even been heard out here, an ordinary gun does not make
much noise. A pair of scissors even less, thought the doctor’s wife. She
did not waste time asking herself where such a thought had come from,
she was only surprised at its slowness, at how the first word had been
so slow in appearing, the slowness of those to follow, and how she found
that the thought was already there before, somewhere or other, and only
the words were missing, like a body searching in the bed for the hollow
that had been prepared for it by the mere idea of lying down. The
soldier approached the gate, although he is standing against the light,
it is clear that he is looking in this direction, he must have noticed
the motionless shadow, although, for the moment, there is not enough
light to see that it is only a woman seated on the ground, her arms
cradling her legs and her chin resting on her knees, the soldier points
the beam of a torch at her, now there can be no doubt, it is a woman who
is about to get up with a movement as slow as her previous thought had
been, but the soldier is not to know this, all he knows is that he is
afraid of that figure of a woman who seems to be taking ages to get to
her feet, in a flash he asks himself whether he should raise the alarm,
the next moment he decides against it, after all, it is only a woman and
she is some way away, in any case, as a precaution he points his weapon
in her direction, but this means putting the torch aside and, with that
movement, the luminous beam shone directly into his eyes, like a sudden
burning, an impression of being dazzled remained in his retina. When he
recovered his vision, the woman had disappeared, now this guard will be
unable to say to the person who comes to relieve him, Nothing to
report.</p>
<p>The doctor’s wife is already in the left wing, in the corridor that
will take her to the third ward. Here too there are blind inmates
sleeping on the floor, more of them than in the right wing. She walks
noiselessly, slowly, she can feel the slime on the ground sticking to
her feet. She looks inside the first two wards, and sees what she
expected to see, bodies lying under blankets, there is a blind man who
is also unable to sleep and says so in a desperate voice, she can hear
the staccato snoring of almost everyone else. As for the smell that all
this gives off, it does not surprise her, there is no other smell in the
entire building, it is the smell of her own body, of the clothes she is
wearing. On turning the corner into the corridor giving access to the
third ward, she came to a halt. There is a man at the door, another
guard. He has a stick in his hand, he is wielding it in slow motion, to
one side then the next, as if blocking the passage of anyone who might
try to approach. Here there are no blind inmates sleeping on the ground
and the corridor is clear. The blind man at the door continues his
uniform toing-and-froing, he seems never to tire, but it is not so,
after several minutes he takes his staff in the other hand and starts
all over again. The doctor’s wife advanced keeping close to the wall on
the other side, taking care not to rub against it. The curve made by the
stick does not even reach halfway across the wide corridor, one is
tempted to say that this guard is on duty with an unloaded weapon. The
doctor’s wife is now directly opposite the blind man, she can see the
ward behind him. Not all the beds are occupied. How many are there, she
wondered. She advanced a little further, almost to the point where his
stick could reach, and there she came to a halt, the blind man had
turned his head to the side where she was standing, as if he had sensed
something unusual, a sigh, a tremor in the air. He was a tall man, with
large hands. First he stretched out before him the hand holding the
stick and with rapid gestures swept the emptiness before him, then took
a short step, for one second, the doctor’s wife feared that he might be
able to see her, that he was only looking for the best place to attack
her, Those eyes are not blind, she thought with alarm. Yes, of course
they were blind, as blind as those of all the inmates living under this
roof, between these walls, all of them, all of them except her. In a low
voice, almost in a whisper, the man asked, Who’s there, he did not shout
like a real guard, Who goes there, friend or foe, the appropriate reply
would be, Friend, whereupon he would say, Pass, but keep your distance,
however, things did not turn out this way, he merely shook his head as
if he were saying to himself, What nonsense, how could anyone be there,
at this hour everyone is asleep. Fumbling with his free hand, he
retreated back towards the door, and, calmed by his own words, he let
his arms hang. He felt sleepy, he had been waiting for ages for one of
his comrades to come and relieve him, but for this to happen it was
necessary that the other, on hearing the inner voice of duty, should
wake up by himself, for there were no alarm clocks around nor any means
of using them. Cautiously, the doctor’s wife reached the other side of
the door and looked inside. The ward was not full. She made a rapid
calculation, decided there must be some nineteen or twenty occupants. At
the far end, she saw a number of food containers piled up, others were
lying on the empty beds. As was only to be expected, they don’t
distribute all the food they receive, she thought. The blind man seemed
to be getting worried again, but made no attempt to investigate. The
minutes passed. The sound of someone coughing loudly, obviously a heavy
smoker, could be heard coming from inside. The blind man turned his head
apprehensively, at last he would get some sleep. None of those lying in
bed got up. Then the blind man, slowly, as if afraid that they might
surprise him in the act of abandoning his post or infringing at one go
all the rules guards are obliged to observe, sat down on the edge of the
bed blocking the entrance. For a few moments, he nodded, then he
succumbed to the river of sleep, and in all certainty as he went under
he must have thought, It doesn’t matter, no one can see me. The doctor’s
wife counted once more those who were asleep inside, Including him there
are twenty of them, at least she had gathered some real information, her
nocturnal excursion had not been in vain, But was this my only reason
for coming here, she asked herself, and she preferred not to pursue the
answer. The blind man was sleeping, his head resting against the
doorjamb, his stick had slipped silently to the floor, there was a
defenceless blind man and with no columns to bring crashing down around
him. The doctor’s wife consciously wanted to think that this man had
stolen the food, had stolen what rightfully belonged to others, that he
took food from the mouths of children, but despite these thoughts, she
did not feel any contempt, not even the slightest irritation, nothing
other than a strange compassion for that drooping body before her, the
head lolling backwards, the long neck covered in swollen veins. For the
first time since she had left the ward she felt a cold shiver run
through her, it was as if the flagstones were turning her feet to ice,
as if they were being scorched. Let’s hope it isn’t fever, she thought.
It couldn’t be, more likely some infinite weariness, a longing to curl
up inside herself, her eyes, especially her eyes, turned inwards, more,
more, more, until they could reach and observe inside her own brain,
there where the difference between seeing and not seeing is invisible to
the naked eye. Slowly, ever more slowly, dragging her body, she retraced
her footsteps to the place where she belonged, she passed by blind
internees who seemed like sleepwalkers, as she must have seemed to them,
she did not even have to pretend that she was blind. The blind lovers
were no longer holding hands, they were asleep and lying huddled beside
each other, she in the curve made by his body to keep warm, and taking a
closer look, they were holding hands, after all, his arm over her body,
their fingers clasped. There inside the ward, the blind woman who had
been unable to sleep was still sitting up in bed, waiting until she
became so tired that her body would finally overcome the obstinate
resistance of her mind. All the others appeared to be sleeping, some
with their heads covered, as if they were still searching for some
impossible darkness. On the bedside table of the girl with dark glasses
stood the bottle of eye-drops. Her eyes were already better, but she was
not to know.</p>
