<h4 id="section">3</h4>
<p>A policeman took the car-thief home. It would never have occurred to
the circumspect and compassionate agent of authority that he was leading
a hardened delinquent by the arm, not to prevent him from escaping, as
might have happened on another occasion, but simply so that the poor man
should not stumble and fall. In recompense, we can easily imagine the
fright it gave the thief’s wife, when, on opening the door, she came
face to face with a policeman in uniform who had in tow, or so it
seemed, a forlorn prisoner, to whom, judging from his miserable
expression, something more awful must have happened than simply to find
himself under arrest. The woman’s first thought was that her husband had
been caught in the act of stealing and the policeman had come to search
the house, this idea, on the other hand, and however paradoxical it may
seem, was somewhat reassuring, considering that her husband only stole
cars, goods which on account of their size cannot be hidden under the
bed. She was not left in doubt for long, the policeman informed her,
This man is blind, look after him, and the woman who should have been
relieved because the officer, after all, had simply accompanied her
husband to his home, perceived the seriousness of the disaster that was
to blight their lives when her husband, weeping his heart out, fell into
her arms and told her what we already know.</p>
<p>The girl with the dark glasses was also accompanied to her parents’
house by a policeman, but the piquancy of the circumstances in which
blindness had manifested itself in her case, a naked woman screaming in
a hotel and alarming the other guests, while the man who was with her
tried to escape, pulling on his trousers in haste, somehow mitigated the
obvious drama of the situation. Overcome with embarrassment, a feeling
entirely compatible, for all the mutterings of hypocritical prudes and
the would-be virtuous, with the mercenary rituals of love to which she
dedicated herself, after the piercing shrieks she let out on realising
that her loss of vision was not some new and unforeseen consequence of
pleasure, the blind girl hardly dared to weep and lament her fate when
unceremoniously, without giving her time to dress properly, and almost
by force, she was evicted from the hotel. In a tone of voice that would
have been sarcastic had it not been simply ill-mannered, the policeman
wanted to know, after asking her where she lived, if she had the money
for the taxi, in these cases, the State doesn’t pay, he warned her, a
procedure which, let us note in passing, is not without a certain logic,
insofar as these women belong to that considerable number who pay no
taxes on their immoral earnings. She gave an affirmative nod, but, being
blind, just imagine, she thought the policeman might not have noticed
her gesture and she murmured, Yes, I have the money, and then under her
breath, added, If only I didn’t, words that might strike us as being
odd, but which, if we consider the circumvolutions of the human mind,
where no short or direct routes exist, these same words end up by being
absolutely clear, what she meant to say was that she had been punished
because of her disreputable conduct, for her immorality, and this was
the outcome. She had told her mother she would not be home for dinner,
and in the end she was home early, even before her father.</p>
<p>The ophthalmologist’s situation was different, not only because he
happened to be at home when he was struck by blindness, but because,
being a doctor, he was not going to surrender helplessly to despair,
like those who only take note of their body when it hurts them. Even in
the anguish of a situation like this, with a night of anxiety ahead of
him, he was still capable of remembering what Homer wrote in the Iliad,
the greatest poem about death and suffering ever written, A doctor is
worth several men, words we should not accept as a straightforward
expression of quantity, but above all, of quality, as we shall soon see.
He summoned the courage to go to bed without disturbing his wife, not
even when, muttering and half asleep, she stirred in the bed and
snuggled up to him. He lay awake for hours on end, the little sleep he
managed to snatch was from pure exhaustion. He hoped the night would
never end rather than have to announce, he whose profession was to cure
ailments in the eyes of others, I’m blind, but, at the same time, he was
anxiously waiting for the light of day, and these are the exact words
that came into his mind, The light of day, knowing that he would not see
it. In fact, a blind ophthalmologist is not much good to anyone, but it
was up to him to inform the health authorities, to warn them of this
situation which might turn into a national catastrophe, nothing more nor
less, of a form of blindness hitherto unknown, with every appearance of
being highly contagious, and which, to all appearances, manifested
itself without the previous existence of earlier pathological symptoms
of an inflammatory, infectious or degenerative nature, as he was able to
verify in the blind man who had come to consult him in his surgery, or
as had been confirmed in his own case, a touch of myopia, a slight
astigmatism, all so mild that he had decided, in the meantime, not to
use corrective lenses. Eyes that had stopped seeing, eyes that were
totally blind, yet meanwhile were in perfect condition, without any
lesions, recent or old, acquired or innate. He recalled the detailed
examination he had carried out on the blind man, how the various parts
of the eye accessible to the ophthalmoscope appeared to be perfectly
healthy, without any trace of morbid changes, a most rare situation in a
man who claimed to be thirty-eight years old, and even in anyone
younger. That man could not be blind, he thought, momentarily forgetting
that he himself was blind, it’s extraordinary how selfless some people
can be, and this is not something new, let us remember what Homer said,
although in apparently different words.</p>
<p>He pretended to be asleep when his wife got up. He felt the kiss she
placed on the forehead, so gentle, as if she did not wish to rouse him
from what she imagined to be a deep sleep, perhaps she thought, Poor
man, he came to bed late after sitting up to study the extraordinary
case of that poor blind man. Alone, as if he were about to be slowly
garrotted by a thick cloud weighing on his chest and entering his
nostrils, blinding him inside, the doctor let out a brief moan, and
allowed two tears, They’re probably white, he thought, to well up in his
eyes and run over his temples, on either side of his face, now he could
understand the fears of his patients, when they told him, Doctor, I
think I’m losing my sight. Small domestic noises reached the bedroom,
his wife would appear any minute now to see if he was still sleeping, it
was almost time for them to go to the hospital. He got up cautiously,
fumbled for his dressing-gown and slipped it on, then he went into the
bathroom to pee. He turned to where he knew a mirror was, and this time
he did not wonder, What’s going on, he did not say, There are a thousand
reasons why the human brain should close down, he simply stretched out
his hands to touch the glass, he knew that his image was there watching
him, his image could see him, he could not see his image. He heard his
wife enter the bedroom, Ah, you’re up already, and he replied, I am. He
felt her by his side, Good morning, my love, they still greeted each
other with words of affection after all these years of marriage, and
then he said, as if both of them were acting in a play and this was his
cue, I doubt whether it will be all that good, there’s something wrong
with my sight. She only took in the last part of the sentence, Let me
take a look, she asked, and examined his eyes attentively, I can’t see
anything, the sentence was obviously borrowed, it was not in her script,
he was the one who should have spoken those words, but he simply said, I
can’t see, and added, I suppose I must have been infected by the patient
I saw yesterday.</p>
<p>With time and intimacy, doctors’ wives also end up knowing something
about medicine, and this one, so close to her husband in everything, had
learned enough to know that blindness does not spread through contagion
like an epidemic, blindness isn’t something that can be caught just by a
blind man looking at someone who is not, blindness is a private matter
between a person and the eyes with which he or she was born. In any
case, a doctor has an obligation to know what he is saying, that is why
he is professionally trained at medical school, and if this doctor here,
apart from having declared himself blind, openly admits that he has been
infected, who is his wife to doubt him, however much she may know about
medicine. It is understandable, therefore, that the poor woman,
confronted by this irrefutable evidence, should react like any ordinary
spouse, two of them we know already, clinging to her husband and showing
natural signs of distress, And what are we going to do now, she asked
amid tears, Advise the health authorities, the Ministry, that’s the
first thing to do, if it should turn out to be an epidemic, measures
must be taken, But no one has ever heard of an epidemic of blindness,
his wife insisted, anxious to hold on to this last shred of hope, Nor
has anyone ever come across a blind man without any apparent reasons for
his condition, and at this very moment there are at least two of them.
No sooner had he uttered this last word than his expression changed. He
pushed his wife away almost violently, he himself drew back, Keep away,
don’t come near me, I might infect you, and then beating on his forehead
with clenched fists, What a fool, what a fool, what an idiot of a
doctor, why did I not think of it before, we’ve spent the entire night
together, I should have slept in the study with the door shut, and even
so, Please, don’t say such things, what has to be will be, come, let me
get you some breakfast, Leave me, leave me, No, I won’t leave you,
shouted his wife, what do you want, to go stumbling around bumping into
the furniture, searching for the telephone without eyes to find the
numbers you need in the telephone directory, while I calmly observe this
spectacle, stuck inside a bell-jar to avoid contamination. She took him
firmly by the arm and said, Come along, love.</p>
<p>It was still early when the doctor had, we can imagine with what
pleasure, finished the cup of coffee and toast his wife had insisted on
preparing for him, much too early to find the people whom he had to
inform at their desks. Logic and efficacy demanded that his report about
what was happening should be made directly and as soon as possible to
someone in authority at the Ministry of Health, but he soon changed his
mind when he realised that to present himself simply as a doctor who had
some important and urgent information to communicate, was not enough to
convince the less exalted civil servant to whom, after much pleading,
the telephone operator had agreed to put him through. The man wanted to
know more details before passing him on to his immediate superior, and
it was clear that a doctor with any sense of responsibility was not
going to declare the outbreak of an epidemic of blindness to the first
minor functionary who appeared before him, it would cause immediate
panic. The functionary at the other end of the line replied, You tell me
you’re a doctor, if you want me to believe you, then, of course, I
believe you, but I have my orders, unless you tell me what you want to
discuss I can take this matter no further, It’s confidential,
Confidential matters are not dealt with over the telephone, you’d better
come here in person. I cannot leave the house, Do you mean you’re ill,
Yes, I’m ill, the blind man said after a pause. In that case you ought
to call a doctor, a real doctor, quipped the functionary, and, delighted
with his own wit, he hung up.</p>
<p>The man’s insolence was like a slap in the face. Only after some
minutes had passed, had he regained enough composure to tell his wife
how rudely he had been treated. Then, as if he had just discovered
something that he should have known a long time ago, he murmured sadly,
This is the stuff we’re made of, half indifference and half malice. He
was about to ask mistrustfully, What now, when he realised that he had
been wasting his time, that the only way of getting the information to
the right quarters by a safe route would be to speak to the medical
director of his own hospital service, doctor to doctor, without any
civil servants in the middle, let him assume responsibility for making
the bureaucratic system do its work. His wife dialled the number, she
knew the hospital number by heart. The doctor identified himself when
they replied, then said rapidly, I’m fine, thank you, no doubt the
receptionist had inquired, How are you, doctor, that is what we say when
we do not wish to play the weakling, we say Fine, even though we may be
dying, and this is commonly known as taking one’s courage in both hands,
a phenomenon that has only been observed in the human species. When the
director came to the telephone, Now then, what’s all this about, the
doctor asked if he was alone, if there was anyone within earshot, no
need to worry about the receptionist, she had better things to do than
listen in to conversations about ophthalmology, besides she was only
interested in gynaecology. The doctor’s account was brief but full, with
no circumlocutions, no superfluous words, with no redundancies, and
expressed with a clinical dryness which, taking into account the
situation, caused the director some surprise, But are you really blind,
he asked, Totally blind, In any case, it might be a coincidence, there
might not really have been, in the strict sense of the word, any
contagion whatsoever, Agreed there is no proof of contagion, but this
was not just a case of his turning blind and my turning blind, each of
us in our own home, without our having seen each other, the man turned
up blind at the surgery and I went blind a few hours later, How can we
trace this man, I have his name and address on file in the surgery, I’ll
send someone there immediately, A doctor, Yes, of course, a colleague,
Don’t you think we ought to inform the Ministry about what is happening,
For the moment that would be premature, think of the public alarm news
of this kind would provoke, good grief, blindness isn’t catching, Death
isn’t catching either, yet nevertheless we all die, Well, you stay at
home while I deal with the matter, then I’ll send someone to fetch you,
I want to examine you, Don’t forget that the fact that I am now blind is
because I examined a blind man, You can’t be sure of that, At least
there is every indication here of cause and effect, Undoubtedly, yet it
is still too early to draw any conclusions, two isolated cases have no
statistical relevance, Unless, at this point, there are more than two of
us, I can understand your state of mind but we must avoid any gloomy
speculations that might turn out to be groundless, Many thanks, You’ll
be hearing from me soon, Goodbye.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, after he had managed, rather awkwardly, to shave,
with some assistance from his wife, the telephone rang. It was the
director again, but this time his voice sounded different, We have a boy
here who has also suddenly gone blind, he sees everything white, his
mother tells me he visited your surgery yesterday, Am I correct in
thinking that this child has a divergent squint in the left eye, Yes,
Then there’s no doubt, it’s him, I’m starting to get worried, the
situation is becoming really serious, What about informing the Ministry,
Yes, of course, I’ll get on to the hospital management right away. After
about three hours, when the doctor and his wife were having their lunch
in silence, he toying with the bits of meat she had cut up for him, the
telephone rang again. His wife went to answer, came back at once, You’ll
have to take the call, it’s from the Ministry. She helped him to his
feet, guided him into the study and handed him the telephone. The
conversation was brief. The Ministry wanted to know the identity of the
patients who had been at his surgery the previous day, the doctor
replied that the clinical files contained all the relevant details,
name, age, marital status, profession, home address, and he ended up
offering to accompany the person or persons entrusted with rounding them
up. At the other end of the line, the tone was curt, That won’t be
necessary. The telephone was passed on to someone else, a different
voice came through, Good afternoon, this is the Minister speaking, on
behalf of the Government I wish to thank you for your zeal, I’m certain
that thanks to your prompt action we shall be able to limit and control
the situation, meanwhile would you please do us the favour of remaining
indoors. The closing words were spoken with courteous formality, but
left him in no doubt that he was being given an order. The doctor
replied, Yes, Minister, but the person at the other end had already put
the phone down.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the telephone rang yet again. It was the medical
director, nervous, jumbling his words, I’ve just been told that the
police have been informed of two cases of sudden blindness, Are they
policemen, No, a man and a woman, they found him in the street screaming
that he was blind, and the woman was in a hotel when she became blind,
it seems she was in bed with someone, We need to check if they, too, are
patients of mine, do you know their names, No names were mentioned, They
have rung me from the Ministry, they’re going to the surgery to collect
the files, What a complicated business, You’re telling me. The doctor
replaced the receiver, raised his hands to his eyes and kept them there
as if trying to defend his eyes from anything worse happening, then he
said faintly, I’m so tired, Try to get some sleep, I’ll take you to your
bed, his wife said, It’s pointless, I wouldn’t be able to sleep, besides
the day isn’t over yet, something could still happen.</p>
<p>It was almost six o’clock when the telephone rang for the last time.
The doctor, who was sitting beside it, picked up the receiver, Yes,
speaking, he said, listened attentively to what he was being told and
merely nodded his head slightly before ringing off, Who was that, his
wife asked, The Ministry, an ambulance is coming to fetch me within the
next half hour, Is that what you expected to happen, Yes, more or less,
Where are they taking you, I don’t know, presumably to a hospital, I’ll
pack a suitcase, sort out some clothes, the usual things, I’m not going
on a trip, We don’t know what it is. She led him gently into the
bedroom, made him sit on the bed, You sit here quietly, I’ll deal with
everything. He could hear her going back and forth, opening and closing
drawers and cupboards, removing clothes and then packing them into the
suitcase on the floor, but what he could not see was that in addition to
his own clothes, she had packed a number of blouses and skirts, a pair
of slacks, a dress, some shoes that could only belong to a woman. It
vaguely crossed his mind that he would not need so many clothes, but
said nothing for this was not the moment to be worrying about such
trivialities. He heard the locks click, then his wife said, Done, we’re
ready for the ambulance now. She carried the suitcase to the door
leading to the stairs, refusing her husband’s help when he said, Let me
help you, that’s something I can do, after all, I’m not an invalid. Then
they went to sit on the sofa in the sitting-room and waited. They were
holding hands, and he said, Who knows how long we shall be separated,
and she replied, Don’t let it worry you.</p>
<p>They waited for almost an hour. When the door-bell rang, she got up
and went to open the door, but there was no one on the landing. She
tried the internal telephone, Very well, he’ll be right down, she said.
She turned to her husband and told him, They’re waiting downstairs, they
have strict orders not to come up to the flat, It would appear the
Ministry is really alarmed. Let’s go. They went down in the elevator,
she helped her husband to negotiate the last few steps and to get into
the ambulance, then went back to the steps to fetch the suitcase, she
lifted it up on her own and pushed it inside. At last she climbed in and
sat beside her husband. The driver of the ambulance turned round to
protest, I can only take him, those are my orders, I must ask you to get
down. The woman calmly replied, You’ll have to take me as well, I’ve
just gone blind this very minute.</p>
