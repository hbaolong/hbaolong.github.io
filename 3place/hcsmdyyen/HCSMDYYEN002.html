<h4 id="foreword">FOREWORD</h4>
<p>VIKTOR FRANKL’S Man’s Search for Meaning is one of the great books of
our time. Typically, if a book has one passage, one idea with the power
to change a person’s life, that alone justifies reading it, rereading
it, and finding room for it on one’s shelves. This book has several such
passages.</p>
<p>It is first of all a book about survival. Like so many German and
East European Jews who thought themselves secure in the 1930s, Frankl
was cast into the Nazi network of concentration and extermination camps.
Miraculously, he survived, in the biblical phrase “a brand plucked from
the fire.” But his account in this book is less about his travails, what
he suffered and lost, than it is about the sources of his strength to
survive. Several times in the course of the book, Frankl approvingly
quotes the words of Nietzsche: “He who has a Why to live for can bear
almost any How.” He describes poignantly those prisoners who gave up on
life, who had lost all hope for a future and were inevitably the first
to die. They died less from lack of food or medicine than from lack of
hope, lack of something to live for. By contrast, Frankl kept himself
alive and kept hope alive by summoning up thoughts of his wife and the
prospect of seeing her again, and by dreaming at one point of lecturing
after the war about the psychological lessons to be learned from the
Auschwitz experience. Clearly, many prisoners who desperately wanted to
live did die, some from disease, some in the crematoria. But Frankl’s
concern is less with the question of why most died than it is with the
question of why anyone at all survived.</p>
<p>Terrible as it was, his experience in Auschwitz reinforced what was
already one of his key ideas: Life is not primarily a quest for
pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler
taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to
find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for
meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for
another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and
of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in
which we respond to it. At one point, Frankl writes that a person “may
remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for
self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more
than an animal.” He concedes that only a few prisoners of the Nazis were
able to do the former, “but even one such example is sufficient proof
that man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.”</p>
<p>Finally, Frankl’s most enduring insight, one that I have called on
often in my own life and in countless counseling situations: Forces
beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one
thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You
cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control
what you will feel and do about what happens to you.</p>
<p>There is a scene in Arthur Miller’s play Incident at Vichy in which
an upper-middle-class professional man appears before the Nazi authority
that has occupied his town and shows his credentials: his university
degrees, his letters of reference from prominent citizens, and so on.
The Nazi asks him, “Is that everything you have?” The man nods. The Nazi
throws it all in the wastebasket and tells him: “Good, now you have
nothing.” The man, whose self-esteem had always depended on the respect
of others, is emotionally destroyed. Frankl would have argued that we
are never left with nothing as long as we retain the freedom to choose
how we will respond.</p>
<p>My own congregational experience has shown me the truth of Frankl’s
insights. I have known successful businessmen who, upon retirement, lost
all zest for life. Their work had given their lives meaning. Often it
was the only thing that had given their lives meaning and, without it,
they spent day after day sitting at home, depressed, “with nothing to
do.” I have known people who rose to the challenge of enduring the most
terrible afflictions and situations as long as they believed there was a
point to their suffering. Whether it was a family milestone they wanted
to live long enough to share or the prospect of doctors finding a cure
by studying their illness, having a Why to live for enabled them to bear
the How.</p>
<p>And my own experience echoes Frankl’s in another way. Just as the
ideas in my book When Bad Things Happen to Good People gained power and
credibility because they were offered in the context of my struggle to
understand the illness and death of our son, Frankl’s doctrine of
logotherapy, curing the soul by leading it to find meaning in life,
gains credibility against the background of his anguish in Auschwitz.
The last half of the book without the first would be far less
effective.</p>
<p>I find it significant that the Foreword to the 1962 edition of Man’s
Search for Meaning was written by a prominent psychologist, Dr. Gordon
Allport, and the Foreword to this new edition is written by a clergyman.
We have come to recognize that this is a profoundly religious book. It
insists that life is meaningful and that we must learn to see life as
meaningful despite our circumstances. It emphasizes that there is an
ultimate purpose to life. And in its original version, before a
postscript was added, it concluded with one of the most religious
sentences written in the twentieth century:</p>
<p>We have come to know Man as he really is. After all, man is that
being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also
that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s
Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.</p>
<p>HAROLD S. KUSHNER</p>
<p>Harold S. Kushner is rabbi emeritus at Temple Israel in Natick,
Massachusetts, and the author of several best-selling books, including
When Bad Things Happen to Good People, Living a Life That Matters, and
When All You’ve Ever Wanted Isn’t Enough.</p>
