<h4 id="afterword">AFTERWORD</h4>
<p>ON JANUARY 27, 2006, the sixty-first anniversary of the liberation of
the Auschwitz death camp, where 1.5 million people died, nations around
the world observed the first International Holocaust Remembrance Day. A
few months later, they might well have celebrated the anniversary of one
of the most abiding pieces of writing from that horrendous time. First
published in German in 1946 as A Psychologist Experiences the
Concentration Camp and later called Say Yes to Life in Spite of
Everything, subsequent editions were supplemented by an introduction to
logotherapy and a postscript on tragic optimism, or how to remain
optimistic in the face of pain, guilt, and death. The English
translation, first published in 1959, was called Man’s Search for
Meaning.</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl’s book has now sold more than 12 million copies in a
total of twenty-four languages. A 1991 Library of
Congress/Book-of-the-Month-Club survey asking readers to name a “book
that made a difference in your life” found Man’s Search for Meaning
among the ten most influential books in America. It has inspired
religious and philosophical thinkers, mental-health professionals,
teachers, students, and general readers from all walks of life. It is
routinely assigned to college, graduate, and high school students in
psychology, philosophy, history, literature, Holocaust studies,
religion, and theology. What accounts for its pervasive influence and
enduring value?</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl’s life spanned nearly all of the twentieth century,
from his birth in 1905 to his death in 1997. At the age of three he
decided to become a physician. In his autobiographical reflections, he
recalls that as a youth he would “think for some minutes about the
meaning of life. Particularly about the meaning of the coming day and
its meaning for me.”</p>
<p>As a teenager Frankl was fascinated by philosophy, experimental
psychology, and psychoanalysis. To supplement his high school classes,
he attended adult-education classes and began a correspondence with
Sigmund Freud that led Freud to submit a manuscript of Frankl’s to the
International Journal of Psychoanalysis. The article was accepted and
later published. That same year, at age sixteen, Frankl attended an
adult-education workshop on philosophy. The instructor, recognizing
Frankl’s precocious intellect, invited him to give a lecture on the
meaning of life. Frankl told the audience that “It is we ourselves who
must answer the questions that life asks of us, and to these questions
we can respond only by being responsible for our existence.” This belief
became the cornerstone of Frankl’s personal life and professional
identity.</p>
<p>Under the influence of Freud’s ideas, Frankl decided while he was
still in high school to become a psychiatrist. Inspired in part by a
fellow student who told him he had a gift for helping others, Frankl had
begun to realize that he had a talent not only for diagnosing
psychological problems, but also for discovering what motivates
people.</p>
<p>Frankl’s first counseling job was entirely his own—he founded
Vienna’s first private youth counseling program and worked with troubled
youths. From 1930 to 1937 he worked as a psychiatrist at the University
Clinic in Vienna, caring for suicidal patients. He sought to help his
patients find a way to make their lives meaningful even in the face of
depression or mental illness. By 1939 he was head of the department of
neurology at Rothschild Hospital, the only Jewish hospital in
Vienna.</p>
<p>In the early years of the war, Frankl’s work at Rothschild gave him
and his family some degree of protection from the threat of deportation.
When the hospital was closed down by the National Socialist government,
however, Frankl realized that they were at grave risk of being sent to a
concentration camp. In 1942 the American consulate in Vienna informed
him that he was eligible for a U.S. immigration visa. Although an escape
from Austria would have enabled him to complete his book on logotherapy,
he decided to let his visa lapse: he felt he should stay in Vienna for
the sake of his aging parents. In September 1942, Frankl and his family
were arrested and deported. Frankl spent the next three years at four
different concentration camps—Theresienstadt, Auschwitz-Birkenau,
Kaufering, and Türkheim, part of the Dachau complex.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Frankl’s imprisonment was not the only
impetus for Man’s Search for Meaning. Before his deportation, he had
already begun to formulate an argument that the quest for meaning is the
key to mental health and human flourishing. As a prisoner, he was
suddenly forced to assess whether his own life still had any meaning.
His survival was a combined result of his will to live, his instinct for
self-preservation, some generous acts of human decency, and shrewdness;
of course, it also depended on blind luck, such as where he happened to
be imprisoned, the whims of the guards, and arbitrary decisions about
where to line up and who to trust or believe. However, something more
was needed to overcome the deprivations and degradations of the camps.
Frankl drew constantly upon uniquely human capacities such as inborn
optimism, humor, psychological detachment, brief moments of solitude,
inner freedom, and a steely resolve not to give up or commit suicide. He
realized that he must try to live for the future, and he drew strength
from loving thoughts of his wife and his deep desire to finish his book
on logotherapy. He also found meaning in glimpses of beauty in nature
and art. Most important, he realized that, no matter what happened, he
retained the freedom to choose how to respond to his suffering. He saw
this not merely as an option but as his and every person’s
responsibility to choose “the way in which he bears his burden.”</p>
<p>Sometimes Frankl’s ideas are inspirational, as when he explains how
dying patients and quadriplegics come to terms with their fate. Others
are aspirational, as when he asserts that a person finds meaning by
“striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.”
He shows how existential frustration provoked and motivated an unhappy
diplomat to seek a new, more satisfying career. Frankl also uses moral
exhortation, however, to call attention to “the gap between what one is
and what one should become” and the idea that “man is responsible and
must actualize the potential meaning of his life.” He sees freedom and
responsibility as two sides of the same coin. When he spoke to American
audiences, Frankl was fond of saying, “I recommend that the Statue of
Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility
on the West Coast.” To achieve personal meaning, he says, one must
transcend subjective pleasures by doing something that “points, and is
directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself … by giving
himself to a cause to serve or another person to love.” Frankl himself
chose to focus on his parents by staying in Vienna when he could have
had safe passage to America. While he was in the same concentration camp
as his father, Frankl managed to obtain morphine to ease his father’s
pain and stayed by his side during his dying days.</p>
<p>Even when confronted by loss and sadness, Frankl’s optimism, his
constant affirmation of and exuberance about life, led him to insist
that hope and positive energy can turn challenges into triumphs. In
Man’s Search for Meaning, he hastens to add that suffering is not
necessary to find meaning, only that “meaning is possible in spite of
suffering.” Indeed, he goes on to say that “to suffer unnecessarily is
masochistic rather than heroic.”</p>
<p>I first read Man’s Search for Meaning as a philosophy professor in
the mid-1960s. The book was brought to my attention by a Norwegian
philosopher who had himself been incarcerated in a Nazi concentration
camp. My colleague remarked how strongly he agreed with Frankl about the
importance of nourishing one’s inner freedom, embracing the value of
beauty in nature, art, poetry, and literature, and feeling love for
family and friends. But other personal choices, activities,
relationships, hobbies, and even simple pleasures can also give meaning
to life. Why, then, do some people find themselves feeling so empty?
Frankl’s wisdom here is worth emphasizing: it is a question of the
attitude one takes toward life’s challenges and opportunities, both
large and small. A positive attitude enables a person to endure
suffering and disappointment as well as enhance enjoyment and
satisfaction. A negative attitude intensifies pain and deepens
disappointments; it undermines and diminishes pleasure, happiness, and
satisfaction; it may even lead to depression or physical illness.</p>
<p>My friend and former colleague Norman Cousins was a tireless advocate
for the value of positive emotions in promoting health, and he warned of
the danger that negative emotions may jeopardize it. Although some
critics attacked Cousins’s views as simplistic, subsequent research in
psychoneuroimmunology has supported the ways in which positive emotions,
expectations, and attitudes enhance our immune system. This research
also reinforces Frankl’s belief that one’s approach to everything from
life-threatening challenges to everyday situations helps to shape the
meaning of our lives. The simple truth that Frankl so ardently promoted
has profound significance for anyone who listens.</p>
<p>The choices humans make should be active rather than passive. In
making personal choices we affirm our autonomy. “A human being is not
one thing among others; things determine each other,” Frankl writes,
“but man is ultimately self determining. What he becomes—within the
limits of endowment and environment—he has made out of himself.” For
example, the darkness of despair threatened to overwhelm a young Israeli
soldier who had lost both his legs in the Yom Kippur War. He was
drowning in depression and contemplating suicide. One day a friend
noticed that his outlook had changed to hopeful serenity. The soldier
attributed his transformation to reading Man’s Search for Meaning. When
he was told about the soldier, Frankl wondered whether “there may be
such a thing as autobibliotherapy—healing through reading.”</p>
<p>Frankl’s comment hints at the reasons why Man’s Search for Meaning
has such a powerful impact on many readers. Persons facing existential
challenges or crises may seek advice or guidance from family, friends,
therapists, or religious counselors. Sometimes such advice is helpful;
sometimes it is not. Persons facing difficult choices may not fully
appreciate how much their own attitude interferes with the decision they
need to make or the action they need to take. Frankl offers readers who
are searching for answers to life’s dilemmas a critical mandate: he does
not tell people what to do, but why they must do it.</p>
<p>After his liberation in 1945 from the Türkheim camp, where he had
nearly died of typhus, Frankl discovered that he was utterly alone. On
the first day of his return to Vienna in August 1945, Frankl learned
that his pregnant wife, Tilly, had died of sickness or starvation in the
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Sadly, his parents and brother had all
died in the camps. Overcoming his losses and inevitable depression, he
remained in Vienna to resume his career as a psychiatrist—an unusual
choice when so many others, especially Jewish psychoanalysts and
psychiatrists, had emigrated to other countries. Several factors may
have contributed to this decision: Frankl felt an intense connection to
Vienna, especially to psychiatric patients who needed his help in the
postwar period. He also believed strongly in reconciliation rather than
revenge; he once remarked, “I do not forget any good deed done to me,
and I do not carry a grudge for a bad one.” Notably, he renounced the
idea of collective guilt. Frankl was able to accept that his Viennese
colleagues and neighbors may have known about or even participated in
his persecution, and he did not condemn them for failing to join the
resistance or die heroic deaths. Instead, he was deeply committed to the
idea that even a vile Nazi criminal or a seemingly hopeless madman has
the potential to transcend evil or insanity by making responsible
choices.</p>
<p>He threw himself passionately into his work. In 1946 he reconstructed
and revised the book that was destroyed when he was first deported (The
Doctor and the Soul), and that same year—in only nine days—he wrote
Man’s Search for Meaning. He hoped to cure through his writings the
personal alienation and cultural malaise that plagued many individuals
who felt an “inner emptiness” or a “void within themselves.” Perhaps
this flurry of professional activity helped Frankl to restore meaning to
his own life.</p>
<p>Two years later he married Eleanore Schwindt, who, like his first
wife, was a nurse. Unlike Tilly, who was Jewish, Elly was Catholic.
Although this may have been mere coincidence, it was characteristic of
Viktor Frankl to accept individuals regardless of their religious
beliefs or secular convictions. His deep commitment to the uniqueness
and dignity of each individual was illustrated by his admiration for
Freud and Adler even though he disagreed with their philosophical and
psychological theories. He also valued his personal relationships with
philosophers as radically different as Martin Heidegger, a reformed Nazi
sympathizer, Karl Jaspers, an advocate of collective guilt, and Gabriel
Marcel, a Catholic philosopher and writer. As a psychiatrist, Frankl
avoided direct reference to his personal religious beliefs. He was fond
of saying that the aim of psychiatry was the healing of the soul,
leaving to religion the salvation of the soul.</p>
<p>He remained head of the neurology department at the Vienna Policlinic
Hospital for twenty-five years and wrote more than thirty books for both
professionals and general readers. He lectured widely in Europe, the
Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa; held professorships at Harvard,
Stanford, and the University of Pittsburgh; and was Distinguished
Professor of Logotherapy at the U.S. International University in San
Diego. He met with politicians, world leaders such as Pope Paul VI,
philosophers, students, teachers, and numerous individuals who had read
and been inspired by his books. Even in his nineties, Frankl continued
to engage in dialogue with visitors from all over the world and to
respond personally to some of the hundreds of letters he received every
week. Twenty-nine universities awarded him honorary degrees, and the
American Psychiatric Association honored him with the Oskar Pfister
Award.</p>
<p>Frankl is credited with establishing logotherapy as a psychiatric
technique that uses existential analysis to help patients resolve their
emotional conflicts. He stimulated many therapists to look beyond
patients’ past or present problems to help them choose productive
futures by making personal choices and taking responsibility for them.
Several generations of therapists were inspired by his humanistic
insights, which gained influence as a result of Frankl’s prolific
writing, provocative lectures, and engaging personality. He encouraged
others to use existential analysis creatively rather than to establish
an official doctrine. He argued that therapists should focus on the
specific needs of individual patients rather than extrapolate from
abstract theories.</p>
<p>Despite a demanding schedule, Frankl also found time to take flying
lessons and pursue his lifelong passion for mountain climbing. He joked
that in contrast to Freud’s and Adler’s “depth psychology,” which
emphasizes delving into an individual’s past and his or her unconscious
instincts and desires, he practiced “height psychology,” which focuses
on a person’s future and his or her conscious decisions and actions. His
approach to psychotherapy stressed the importance of helping people to
reach new heights of personal meaning through self-transcendence: the
application of positive effort, technique, acceptance of limitations,
and wise decisions. His goal was to provoke people into realizing that
they could and should exercise their capacity for choice to achieve
their own goals. Writing about tragic optimism, he cautioned us that
“the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse
unless each of us does his best.”</p>
<p>Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his
own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess
what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student
surprised Frankl by saying, “The meaning of your life is to help others
find the meaning of theirs.”</p>
<p>“That was it, exactly,” Frankl said. “Those are the very words I had
written.”</p>
