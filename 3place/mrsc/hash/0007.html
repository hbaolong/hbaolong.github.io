<p>She felt bound by old promises, trapped on the opposite side of
freedom, yet continued to struggle forward with quiet determination.</p>
<p>The etymology of “struggle” remains bound in mystery, lurking on the
opposite side of certainty where clear origins ought to lie.</p>
<h2 id="bind">bind</h2>
<h3
id="analysis-of-the-word-bind-from-the-perspectives-of-etymology-root-and-morphology">Analysis
of the word <strong>bind</strong> from the perspectives of etymology,
root, and morphology</h3>
<h4 id="etymology-origin-historical-development">1. Etymology (Origin
&amp; Historical Development)</h4>
<p>The word “bind” is one of the oldest fully native English words still
in daily use.<br />
It has been in continuous existence for over 3,000 years.</p>
<p>First recorded in Old English (before 700 CE) as the strong verb
<strong>bindan</strong> (class III strong verb: bindan – band – bundon –
bunden).<br />
It entered Middle English almost unchanged as <strong>binden</strong>,
and by the 13th century simplified to modern <strong>bind – bound –
bound</strong>.</p>
<p>The original literal meaning in Proto-Germanic was “to tie up with a
band or cord” (especially tying prisoners, bundles, or sheaves of
grain).<br />
From this physical act it quickly spread to legal senses (“to obligate”,
already in Old English law codes), magical senses (“to bind with a
spell”), and medical senses (“to bandage a wound”).</p>
<p>By the 16th–17th centuries the figurative uses we know today were all
established: bind someone to secrecy, a binding contract, feel bound by
duty, etc.</p>
<h4 id="root-indo-european-origin">2. Root &amp; Indo-European
Origin</h4>
<p>Pure Germanic word descending from a very ancient Indo-European
root.</p>
<p>Proto-Indo-European root: <strong>bhendh-</strong> meaning “to tie,
bind”.<br />
Proto-Germanic: <strong>bindan</strong> (strong verb).<br />
Old English: <strong>bindan</strong>.</p>
<p>Direct cognates in living languages:<br />
German <strong>binden</strong> (to bind, tie)<br />
Dutch <strong>binden</strong><br />
Swedish <strong>binda</strong><br />
Gothic <strong>bindan</strong> (in the Bible translation of Ulfilas, 4th
century).</p>
<p>Wider Indo-European family from the same <strong>bhendh-</strong>
root:<br />
Sanskrit <strong>bandhati</strong> (“he ties”) → Hindi/Urdu
<strong>bāndhnā</strong><br />
Persian <strong>bastan</strong> (“to bind, close”)<br />
Latin <strong>offendix</strong> (“knot, band”) → French
<strong>offense</strong> (originally a snare)<br />
English <strong>band</strong>, <strong>bend</strong>,
<strong>bond</strong>, <strong>bundle</strong> are all ultimately from
the same ancient root (some via Old Norse or French).</p>
<h4 id="morphology-word-formation-in-english">3. Morphology (Word
Formation in English)</h4>
<p>“Bind” is a classic example of an Old English strong verb (ablaut
series: i – a – u – u).</p>
<p>Principal parts today:<br />
bind – bound – bound (past tense and past participle merged in Modern
English; Old English kept bundon vs bunden).</p>
<p>Main native derivatives (all Germanic, no Latin/Greek
elements):<br />
binder (agent noun, “one who binds” or a cover for papers)<br />
binding (present participle → noun/adjective: a book binding, legally
binding)<br />
bound (past participle → adjective: duty-bound, homeward-bound)<br />
band (original meaning “something that binds” → strip, group, musical
band)<br />
bond (from Old Norse variant <em>bōnda</em> meaning “householder”, later
“something that binds people legally”)<br />
bundle (bind + -le frequentative suffix: “tie into little bundles”).</p>
<p>The verb itself remains highly productive in phrasal verbs: bind up,
bind over (legal), bind off (knitting), etc.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-core-traits">4. Summary of Core Traits</h4>
<p>Original literal meaning: “to tie with a cord or band” (still the
primary sense).<br />
Root: Indo-European <strong>bhendh-</strong> “to tie”.<br />
Completely native Germanic inheritance – never borrowed.<br />
One of the few strong verbs that has kept exactly the same stem for over
1,400 years of recorded English.<br />
Spelling and pronunciation almost unchanged since Anglo-Saxon times
(only the infinitive ending -an disappeared).</p>
<p>In short, <strong>bind</strong> is a linguistic fossil: a word that
has survived from the Bronze Age almost intact, carrying the same core
idea of “tying” across physical, legal, emotional, and magical domains
for millennia.</p>
<h2 id="opposite">opposite</h2>
<h3
id="analysis-of-the-word-opposite-from-the-perspectives-of-etymology-root-and-morphology">Analysis
of the word <strong>opposite</strong> from the perspectives of
etymology, root, and morphology</h3>
<h4 id="etymology-origin-historical-development-1">1. Etymology (Origin
&amp; Historical Development)</h4>
<p>The word “opposite” is a classic Latin borrowing that entered English
in the late 14th century (first recorded around 1375–1400).</p>
<p>It comes directly from Old French <strong>oposit</strong> (modern
French <strong>opposé</strong>), which itself is taken from Latin
<strong>oppositus</strong>, the past participle of the verb
<strong>opponere</strong> (“to place against, set opposite”).</p>
<p>The original literal meaning in Latin was “placed over against” or
“set in front of” (e.g., two armies facing each other, or two doors on
opposite sides of a room).<br />
By the time it reached English, it already carried both spatial
(“facing”) and logical (“contrary”) senses. The logical meaning
(“completely different, contrary”) became dominant in the 15th–16th
centuries through philosophy and rhetoric.</p>
<h4 id="root-classical-elements">2. Root &amp; Classical Elements</h4>
<p>Fully Latin, built from two clear Indo-European components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefix <strong>ob- / op-</strong>: “against, toward, in front of”
(the b assimilates to p before p). From Indo-European
<strong>h₂epo-</strong> or <strong>opi-</strong> (“near, against”).</li>
<li>Verb stem <strong>ponere</strong>: “to place, put, set” (perfect
stem <strong>posit-</strong>). From Indo-European <strong>po-</strong> +
<strong>dʰeh₁-</strong> (“to place, set”).</li>
</ul>
<p>So <strong>op-pōnere</strong> literally = “to set against”.<br />
The past participle <strong>oppositus</strong> → “that which has been
set against” → English <strong>opposite</strong>.</p>
<p>Close relatives from the same roots: - position, propose, expose,
compose, deposit, posture (all from ponere) - opponent, oppose,
opposition (direct siblings) - object (originally “thing thrown against”
the mind)</p>
<h4 id="morphology-word-formation-in-english-1">3. Morphology (Word
Formation in English)</h4>
<p>“Opposite” entered English ready-made as both adjective and noun; a
verb sense (“to oppose”) existed briefly in the 17th century but died
out.</p>
<p>Main forms and derivatives: - opposite
(adjective/noun/preposition/adverb): stress on first syllable as
adjective/noun (/ˈɒp.ə.zɪt/), on second as verb (obsolete /əˈpəʊz/) -
oppositely (adverb) - oppositeness (noun, rare) - opposition (noun:
opposite + -tion, 14th century) - oppositional, oppositionist (modern
formations)</p>
<p>The word is morphologically frozen in modern English – no longer
feels like it has an active prefix + root structure for most
speakers.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-core-traits-1">4. Summary of Core Traits</h4>
<p>Original Latin meaning: “placed over against” (spatial).<br />
Modern primary meanings: (1) facing or across from (spatial), (2)
completely different or contrary (logical/abstract).<br />
Root breakdown: ob-/op- (“against”) + posit- (“placed”).<br />
Borrowed in the 1300s via French; one of the earliest
philosophical/scientific borrowings in Middle English.<br />
Completely supplanted the native Old English words for the concept
(e.g. <strong>onġēan</strong> → Modern English “again” survives, but
lost the “opposite” sense).</p>
<p>In short, <strong>opposite</strong> is a perfect example of how a
literal Latin compound meaning “set against” expanded from battlefield
positioning to become the everyday English term for anything contrary or
facing – one of the most successful spatial-to-abstract semantic shifts
in the language.</p>
<h2 id="struggle">struggle</h2>
<h3
id="analysis-of-the-word-struggle-from-the-perspectives-of-etymology-root-and-morphology">Analysis
of the word <strong>struggle</strong> from the perspectives of
etymology, root, and morphology</h3>
<h4 id="etymology-origin-historical-development-2">1. Etymology (Origin
&amp; Historical Development)</h4>
<p>“Struggle” appears quite suddenly in early Middle English around
1300–1350 as the verb <strong>struglen</strong> /
<strong>stroglen</strong>, and slightly later as the noun (c. 1400).</p>
<p>Despite centuries of investigation, its origin remains one of the
famous mysteries of English etymology — most dictionaries label it
“origin unknown”.</p>
<p>Best current theories: - Almost certainly imitative/onomatopoeic: the
repeated <strong>str-</strong> + <strong>-uggle</strong> mimics violent,
jerky, repetitive movement and effort (compare <strong>strive</strong>,
<strong>strum</strong>, <strong>stroke</strong>,
<strong>scratch</strong>, <strong>shriek</strong>). - A possible
Scandinavian loan: Middle English texts from areas with heavy Norse
influence (the Danelaw) show the word earliest and most frequently. Some
scholars suggest an unrecorded Old Norse verb
<em><strong>strokla</strong> or </em><strong>strúka</strong> meaning “to
move violently, thrash about” (related to Old Norse
<strong>strjúka</strong> “to stroke roughly” or <strong>strokka</strong>
“to strike”). - An unproven link to an Old French frequentative verb
<strong>estrougler</strong> or <strong>estrousser</strong> has been
suggested but is now largely rejected.</p>
<p>Whatever the exact source, by the late 1300s “struggle” had
completely replaced the native Old English verbs for the concept (mainly
<strong>winnan</strong>, <strong>campian</strong>,
<strong>feohhtan</strong>).</p>
<h4 id="root-sound-symbolism">2. Root &amp; Sound Symbolism</h4>
<p>No clear Indo-European root can be proven, which is extremely rare
for a basic action verb in English.</p>
<p>The initial cluster <strong>str-</strong> is highly expressive in
Germanic languages and almost always suggests difficult, forceful, or
unpleasant motion:<br />
strong, stretch, stride, strike, strip, stroke, strive, stress, strip,
strum, strut, stroke, etc.</p>
<p>The ending <strong>-uggle</strong> is a classic Middle English
frequentative/diminutive suffix that signals repeated, diminutive, or
ineffective action (hug &gt; snuggle, wade &gt; waddle, drib &gt;
dribble, spark &gt; sparkle).<br />
So even if the word was invented from Norse, the <strong>-uggle</strong>
ending made it feel instantly native and expressive.</p>
<h4 id="morphology-word-formation-in-english-2">3. Morphology (Word
Formation in English)</h4>
<p>Entered English as a ready-made frequentative verb (indicating
repeated or intense action).</p>
<p>Core family (all formed in Middle English or later): - struggle
(verb, c. 1300) - struggle (noun, late 14th century, originally “a
violent effort”) - struggler (noun, 1570s) - struggling
(adjective/participle, 1540s) - strugglingly (adverb, rare)</p>
<p>The verb is weak/regular today (struggle – struggled – struggled),
but early texts occasionally show strong forms like
<strong>straggle</strong> or <strong>stroggled</strong>, hinting it may
once have been treated as strong.</p>
<p>Note the unrelated but similar-looking <strong>straggle</strong> (“to
wander off in a scattered way”) – probably a separate frequentative of
an old verb <strong>strake/strake</strong> “to go”.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-core-traits-2">4. Summary of Core Traits</h4>
<p>Meaning from the beginning: “to make violent, convulsive, or great
effort against resistance; to contend with an opponent or
difficulty”.<br />
Origin: almost certainly imitative/onomatopoeic, possibly reinforced by
a lost Scandinavian word from Old Norse.<br />
One of the very few everyday action verbs in Modern English whose
ultimate source is still labelled “unknown”.<br />
Replaced a whole group of Old English verbs (winnan, campian, swincan)
and has no direct cognates in modern German, Dutch, or the Scandinavian
languages — a true orphan word that somehow became indispensable.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>struggle</strong> is that rare thing: a basic,
high-frequency English verb that probably arose from the sound of the
action itself — the thrashing, gasping, repetitive effort — and then
stuck because it simply sounded exactly like what it meant.</p>

id="analysis-of-the-word-etymology-from-the-perspectives-of-etymology-meta-root-and-morphology">Analysis
of the word <strong>etymology</strong> from the perspectives of
etymology (meta!), root, and morphology</h3>
<h4 id="etymology-the-words-own-history">1. Etymology (the word’s own
history)</h4>
<p>The word “etymology” itself entered English in the late 14th century
(first recorded c. 1387–1400).</p>
<p>It comes straight from Old French <strong>ethimologie</strong>
(modern French <strong>étymologie</strong>), which was borrowed from
Latin <strong>etymologia</strong>.<br />
Latin took it unchanged from Ancient Greek <strong>ἐτυμολογία</strong>
(etumología), a compound coined by philosophers in the 5th–4th centuries
BCE (it appears in Plato and Aristotle).</p>
<p>The first known person to use the Greek compound systematically was
the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus (c. 280–207 BCE), but it became
standard in Hellenistic scholarship for the “true” or “original” meaning
of words.</p>
<p>So the word is about 2,400 years old and has barely changed its form
or meaning the entire time.</p>
<h4 id="root-classical-greek-elements">2. Root &amp; Classical Greek
Elements</h4>
<p>Greek <strong>ἐτυμολογία</strong> is a perfect compound of two clear
parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ἔτυμος</strong> (étumos) = “true, real, genuine” (the neuter
form ἐτῠμον is used in the compound).<br />
From Proto-Indo-European <strong>h₁s-nt-i̯o-</strong> or
<strong>h₁s-ent-</strong> “that which is, being” → the root of “is / are
/ essence”.</li>
<li><strong>-λογία</strong> (-logía) = “study of, discourse on, account
of”.<br />
From <strong>λόγος</strong> (lógos) “word, speech, reason” +
<strong>-ία</strong> (abstract noun suffix).</li>
</ul>
<p>Literal translation: “the study of the true (meaning/sense of
words)”.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks used ἐτυμολογία because they believed every word
had a single “true” original meaning that could be uncovered by breaking
it down to its real roots (often creatively and fantastically — Plato’s
dialogue <em>Cratylus</em> is full of wildly imaginative etymologies
that we now call folk etymologies).</p>
<h4 id="morphology-word-formation">3. Morphology (Word Formation)</h4>
<p>The word was borrowed whole into Latin and then into English with
almost no change.</p>
<p>Breakdown in English spelling: ety mo log y<br />
etym(o)- + -o- (connecting vowel) + -logy</p>
<p>Core English family (all from the same Greek stem): - etymology
(noun) - etymological (adjective, 1590s) - etymologically (adverb) -
etymologist (one who studies etymology, 1630s) - etymologize (verb,
1680s, “to search for the true origin of words”)</p>
<p>Related English words from the two Greek roots: From
<strong>ἔτυμος</strong>: very few direct descendants, but the idea
survives in “true”. From <strong>-λογία</strong>: hundreds — biology,
theology, geology, psychology, technology, trilogy, etc.</p>
<h4 id="summary-of-core-traits-3">4. Summary of Core Traits</h4>
<p>Original Greek meaning (c. 400 BCE): “the study of the true sense of
words”.<br />
Exact same meaning today, 2,400 years later — one of the most stable
technical terms in Western intellectual history.<br />
Root breakdown: ἐτυμο- “true” + -λογία “study/discourse”.<br />
Borrowed unchanged through Greek → Latin → Old French → Middle
English.<br />
The word “etymology” is itself a perfect example of what it describes:
its form and meaning are virtually identical to the day it was first
coined in ancient Athens.</p>
Ironically, the ancient Greeks often practiced very creative (and wrong)
etymologies. Modern scientific etymology only began in the 19th century
— so the word is far older than the rigorous discipline it now names.
