<h4 id="rule-5">RULE 5</h4>
<p>DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN DO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU DISLIKE THEM</p>
<p>ACTUALLY, IT’S NOT OK</p>
<p>Recently, I watched a three-year-old boy trail his mother and father
slowly through a crowded airport. He was screaming violently at
five-second intervals—and, more important, he was doing it voluntarily.
He wasn’t at the end of this tether. As a parent, I could tell from the
tone. He was irritating his parents and hundreds of other people to gain
attention. Maybe he needed something. But that was no way to get it, and
his parents should have let him know that. You might object that
“perhaps they were worn out, and jet-lagged, after a long trip.” But
thirty seconds of carefully directed problem-solving would have brought
the shameful episode to a halt. More thoughtful parents would not have
let someone they truly cared for become the object of a crowd’s
contempt.</p>
<p>I have also watched a couple, unable or unwilling to say no to their
two-year-old, obliged to follow closely behind him everywhere he went,
every moment of what was supposed to be an enjoyable social visit,
because he misbehaved so badly when not micro-managed that he could not
be given a second of genuine freedom without risk. The desire of his
parents to let their child act without correction on every impulse
perversely produced precisely the opposite effect: they deprived him
instead of every opportunity to engage in independent action. Because
they did not dare to teach him what “No” means, he had no conception of
the reasonable limits enabling maximal toddler autonomy. It was a
classic example of too much chaos breeding too much order (and the
inevitable reversal). I have, similarly, seen parents rendered unable to
engage in adult conversation at a dinner party because their children,
four and five, dominated the social scene, eating the centres out of all
the sliced bread, subjecting everyone to their juvenile tyranny, while
mom and dad watched, embarrassed and bereft of the ability to
intervene.</p>
<p>When my now-adult daughter was a child, another child once hit her on
the head with a metal toy truck. I watched that same child, one year
later, viciously push his younger sister backwards over a fragile
glass-surfaced coffee table. His mother picked him up, immediately
afterward (but not her frightened daughter), and told him in hushed
tones not to do such things, while she patted him comfortingly in a
manner clearly indicative of approval. She was out to produce a little
God-Emperor of the Universe. That’s the unstated goal of many a mother,
including many who consider themselves advocates for full gender
equality. Such women will object vociferously to any command uttered by
an adult male, but will trot off in seconds to make their progeny a
peanut-butter sandwich if he demands it while immersed self-importantly
in a video game. The future mates of such boys have every reason to hate
their mothers-in-law. Respect for women? That’s for other boys, other
men—not for their dear sons.</p>
<p>Something of the same sort may underlie, in part, the preference for
male children seen most particularly in places such as India, Pakistan
and China, where sex-selective abortion is widely practised. The
Wikipedia entry for that practice attributes its existence to “cultural
norms” favouring male over female children. (I cite Wikipedia because it
is collectively written and edited and, therefore, the perfect place to
find accepted wisdom.) But there’s no evidence that such ideas are
strictly cultural. There are plausible psycho-biological reasons for the
evolution of such an attitude, and they’re not pretty, from a modern,
egalitarian perspective. If circumstances force you to put all your eggs
into one basket, so to speak, a son is a better bet, by the strict
standards of evolutionary logic, where the proliferation of your genes
is all that matters. Why?</p>
<p>Well, a reproductively successful daughter might gain you eight or
nine children. The Holocaust survivor Yitta Schwartz, a star in this
regard, had three generations of direct descendants who matched such
performance. She was the ancestor of almost two thousand people by the
time of her death in 2010.77 But the sky is truly the limit with a
reproductively successful son. Sex with multiple female partners is his
ticket to exponential reproduction (given our species’ practical
limitation to single births). Rumour has it that the actor Warren Beatty
and the athlete Wilt Chamberlain each bedded multiple thousands of women
(something not unknown, as well, among rock stars). They didn’t produce
children in those numbers. Modern birth control limits that. But similar
celebrity types in the past have done so. The forefather of the Qing
dynasty, Giocangga (circa 1550), for example, is the male-line ancestor
of a million and a half people in northeastern China.78 The medieval Uí
Néill dynasty produced up to three million male descendants, localized
mainly in northwestern Ireland and the US, through Irish emigration.79
And the king of them all, Genghis Khan, conqueror of much of Asia, is
forefather of 8 percent of the men in Central Asia—sixteen million male
descendants, 34 generations later.80 So, from a deep, biological
perspective there are reasons why parents might favour sons sufficiently
to eliminate female fetuses, although I am not claiming direct
causality, nor suggesting a lack of other, more culturally-dependent
reasons.</p>
<p>Preferential treatment awarded a son during development might even
help produce an attractive, well-rounded, confident man. This happened
in the case of the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, by his own
account: “A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother
keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror, that confidence of success
that often induces real success.”81 Fair enough. But “feeling of a
conqueror” can all too easily become “actual conqueror.” Genghis Khan’s
outstanding reproductive success certainly came at the cost of any
success whatsoever for others (including the dead millions of Chinese,
Persians, Russians and Hungarians). Spoiling a son might therefore work
well from the standpoint of the “selfish gene” (allowing the favoured
child’s genes to replicate themselves in innumerable offspring), to use
the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins’ famous expression. But it
can make for a dark, painful spectacle in the here and now, and mutate
into something indescribably dangerous.</p>
<p>None of this means that all mothers favour all sons over their
daughters (or that daughters are not sometimes favoured over sons, or
that fathers don’t sometimes favor their sons). Other factors can
clearly dominate. Sometimes, for example, unconscious hatred (sometimes
not-so-unconscious, either) overrides any concern a parent might have
for any child, regardless of gender or personality or situation. I saw a
four-year old boy allowed to go hungry on a regular basis. His nanny had
been injured, and he was being cycled through the neighbours for
temporary care. When his mother dropped him off at our house, she
indicated that he wouldn’t eat at all, all day. “That’s OK,” she said.
It wasn’t OK (in case that’s not obvious). This was the same
four-year-old boy who clung to my wife for hours in absolute desperation
and total commitment, when she tenaciously, persistently and mercifully
managed to feed him an entire lunch-time meal, rewarding him throughout
for his cooperation, and refusing to let him fail. He started out with a
closed mouth, sitting with all of us at the dining room table, my wife
and I, our two kids, and two neighbourhood kids we looked after during
the day. She put the spoon in front of him, waiting patiently,
persistently, while he moved his head back and forth, refusing it entry,
using defensive methods typical of a recalcitrant and
none-too-well-attended two-year old.</p>
<p>She didn’t let him fail. She patted him on the head every time he
managed a mouthful, telling him sincerely that he was a “good boy” when
he did so. She did think he was a good boy. He was a cute, damaged kid.
Ten not-too-painful minutes later he finished his meal. We were all
watching intently. It was a drama of life and death.</p>
<p>“Look,” she said, holding up his bowl. “You finished all of it.” This
boy, who was standing in the corner, voluntarily and unhappily, when I
first saw him; who wouldn’t interact with the other kids, who frowned
chronically, who wouldn’t respond to me when I tickled and prodded him,
trying to get him to play—this boy broke immediately into a wide,
radiant smile. It brought joy to everyone at the table. Twenty years
later, writing it down today, it still brings me to tears. Afterward, he
followed my wife around like a puppy for the rest of the day, refusing
to let her out of his sight. When she sat down, he jumped in her lap,
cuddling in, opening himself back up to the world, searching desperately
for the love he had been continually denied. Later in the day, but far
too soon, his mother reappeared. She came down the stairs into the room
we all occupied. “Oh, SuperMom,” she uttered, resentfully, seeing her
son curled up in my wife’s lap. Then she departed, black, murderous
heart unchanged, doomed child in hand. She was a psychologist. The
things you can see, with even a single open eye. It’s no wonder that
people want to stay blind.</p>
<p>Everybody Hates Arithmetic</p>
<p>My clinical clients frequently come to me to discuss their day-to-day
familial problems. Such quotidian concerns are insidious. Their habitual
and predictable occurrence makes them appear trivial. But that
appearance of triviality is deceptive: it is the things that occur every
single day that truly make up our lives, and time spent the same way
over and again adds up at an alarming rate. One father recently spoke
with me about the trouble he was having putting his son to sleep at
nightfn1—a ritual that typically involved about three-quarters of an
hour of fighting. We did the arithmetic. Forty-five minutes a day, seven
days a week—that’s three hundred minutes, or five hours, a week. Five
hours for each of the four weeks of a month—that’s twenty hours per
month. Twenty hours a month for twelve months is two hundred and forty
hours a year. That’s a month and a half of standard forty-hour work
weeks.</p>
<p>My client was spending a month and a half of work weeks per year
fighting ineffectually and miserably with his son. Needless to say, both
were suffering for it. No matter how good your intentions, or how sweet
and tolerant your temperament, you will not maintain good relations with
someone you fight with for a month and a half of work weeks per year.
Resentment will inevitably build. Even if it doesn’t, all that wasted,
unpleasant time could clearly be spent in more productive and useful and
less stressful and more enjoyable activity. How are such situations to
be understood? Where does the fault lie, in child or in parent? In
nature or society? And what, if anything, is to be done?</p>
<p>Some localize all such problems in the adult, whether in the parent
or broader society. “There are no bad children,” such people think,
“only bad parents.” When the idealized image of an unsullied child is
brought to mind, this notion appears fully justified. The beauty,
openness, joy, trust and capacity for love characterizing children makes
it easy to attribute full culpability to the adults on the scene. But
such an attitude is dangerously and naively romantic. It’s too
one-sided, in the case of parents granted a particularly difficult son
or daughter. It’s also not for the best that all human corruption is
uncritically laid at society’s feet. That conclusion merely displaces
the problem, back in time. It explains nothing, and solves no problems.
If society is corrupt, but not the individuals within it, then where did
the corruption originate? How is it propagated? It’s a one-sided, deeply
ideological theory.</p>
<p>Even more problematic is the insistence logically stemming from this
presumption of social corruption that all individual problems, no matter
how rare, must be solved by cultural restructuring, no matter how
radical. Our society faces the increasing call to deconstruct its
stabilizing traditions to include smaller and smaller numbers of people
who do not or will not fit into the categories upon which even our
perceptions are based. This is not a good thing. Each person’s private
trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are
destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and
organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast
stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude
why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being
carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs
to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the
suffering that even small revolutions generally produce.</p>
<p>Was it really a good thing, for example, to so dramatically
liberalize the divorce laws in the 1960s? It’s not clear to me that the
children whose lives were destabilized by the hypothetical freedom this
attempt at liberation introduced would say so. Horror and terror lurk
behind the walls provided so wisely by our ancestors. We tear them down
at our peril. We skate, unconsciously, on thin ice, with deep, cold
waters below, where unimaginable monsters lurk.</p>
<p>I see today’s parents as terrified by their children, not least
because they have been deemed the proximal agents of this hypothetical
social tyranny, and simultaneously denied credit for their role as
benevolent and necessary agents of discipline, order and
conventionality. They dwell uncomfortably and self-consciously in the
shadow of the all-too-powerful shadow of the adolescent ethos of the
1960s, a decade whose excesses led to a general denigration of
adulthood, an unthinking disbelief in the existence of competent power,
and the inability to distinguish between the chaos of immaturity and
responsible freedom. This has increased parental sensitivity to the
short-term emotional suffering of their children, while heightening
their fear of damaging their children to a painful and counterproductive
degree. Better this than the reverse, you might argue—but there are
catastrophes lurking at the extremes of every moral continuum.</p>
<p>The Ignoble Savage</p>
<p>It has been said that every individual is the conscious or
unconscious follower of some influential philosopher. The belief that
children have an intrinsically unsullied spirit, damaged only by culture
and society, is derived in no small part from the eighteenth-century
Genevan French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.82 Rousseau was a
fervent believer in the corrupting influence of human society and
private ownership alike. He claimed that nothing was so gentle and
wonderful as man in his pre-civilized state. At precisely the same time,
noting his inability as a father, he abandoned five of his children to
the tender and fatal mercies of the orphanages of the time.</p>
<p>The noble savage Rousseau described, however, was an ideal—an
abstraction, archetypal and religious—and not the flesh-and-blood
reality he supposed. The mythologically perfect Divine Child permanently
inhabits our imagination. He’s the potential of youth, the newborn hero,
the wronged innocent, and the long-lost son of the rightful king. He’s
the intimations of immortality that accompany our earliest experiences.
He’s Adam, the perfect man, walking without sin with God in the Garden
before the Fall. But human beings are evil, as well as good, and the
darkness that dwells forever in our souls is also there in no small part
in our younger selves. In general, people improve with age, rather than
worsening, becoming kinder, more conscientious, and more emotionally
stable as they mature.83 Bullying at the sheer and often terrible
intensity of the schoolyard84 rarely manifests itself in grown-up
society. William Golding’s dark and anarchistic Lord of the Flies is a
classic for a reason.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is plenty of direct evidence that the horrors of
human behaviour cannot be so easily attributed to history and society.
This was discovered most painfully, perhaps, by the primatologist Jane
Goodall, beginning in 1974, when she learned that her beloved
chimpanzees were capable of and willing to murder each other (to use the
terminology appropriate to humans).85 Because of its shocking nature and
great anthropological significance, she kept her observations secret for
years, fearing that her contact with the animals had led them to
manifest unnatural behaviour. Even after she published her account, many
refused to believe it. It soon became obvious, however, that what she
observed was by no means rare.</p>
<p>Bluntly put: chimpanzees conduct inter-tribal warfare. Furthermore,
they do it with almost unimaginable brutality. The typical full-grown
chimp is more than twice as strong as a comparable human being, despite
their smaller size.86 Goodall reported with some terror the proclivity
of the chimps she studied to snap strong steel cables and levers.87
Chimps can literally tear each other to pieces—and they do. Human
societies and their complex technologies cannot be blamed for that.88
“Often when I woke in the night,” she wrote, “horrific pictures sprang
unbidden to my mind—Satan [a long-observed chimp] cupping his hand below
Sniff’s chin to drink the blood that welled from a great wound in his
face … Jomeo tearing a strip of skin from Dé’s thigh; Figan, charging
and hitting, again and again, the stricken, quivering body of Goliath,
one of his childhood heroes.”89 Small gangs of adolescent chimps, mostly
male, roam the borders of their territory. If they encounter foreigners
(even chimps they once knew, who had broken away from the now-too-large
group) and, if they outnumber them, the gang will mob and destroy them,
without mercy. Chimps don’t have much of a super-ego, and it is prudent
to remember that the human capacity for self-control may also be
overestimated. Careful perusal of book as shocking and horrific as Iris
Chang’s The Rape of Nanking,90 which describes the brutal decimation of
that Chinese city by the invading Japanese, will disenchant even a
committed romantic. And the less said about Unit 731, a covert Japanese
biological warfare research unit established at that time, the better.
Read about it at your peril. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, too, are much more murderous than their urban,
industrialized counterparts, despite their communal lives and localized
cultures. The yearly rate of homicide in the modern UK is about 1 per
100,000.91 It’s four to five times higher in the US, and about ninety
times higher in Honduras, which has the highest rate recorded of any
modern nation. But the evidence strongly suggests that human beings have
become more peaceful, rather than less so, as time has progressed and
societies became larger and more organized. The !Kung bushmen of Africa,
romanticized in the 1950s by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas as “the harmless
people,”92 had a yearly murder rate of 40 per 100,000, which declined by
more than 30% once they became subject to state authority.93 This is a
very instructive example of complex social structures serving to reduce,
not exacerbate, the violent tendencies of human beings. Yearly rates of
300 per 100,000 have been reported for the Yanomami of Brazil, famed for
their aggression—but the stats don’t max out there. The denizens of
Papua, New Guinea, kill each other at yearly rates ranging from 140 to
1000 per 100,000.94 However, the record appears to be held by the Kato,
an indigeneous people of California, 1450 of whom per 100,000 met a
violent death circa 1840.95</p>
<p>Because children, like other human beings, are not only good, they
cannot simply be left to their own devices, untouched by society, and
bloom into perfection. Even dogs must be socialized if they are to
become acceptable members of the pack—and children are much more complex
than dogs. This means that they are much more likely to go complexly
astray if they are not trained, disciplined and properly encouraged.
This means that it is not just wrong to attribute all the violent
tendencies of human beings to the pathologies of social structure. It’s
wrong enough to be virtually backward. The vital process of
socialization prevents much harm and fosters much good. Children must be
shaped and informed, or they cannot thrive. This fact is reflected
starkly in their behavior: kids are utterly desperate for attention from
both peers and adults because such attention, which renders them
effective and sophisticated communal players, is vitally necessary.</p>
<p>Children can be damaged as much or more by a lack of incisive
attention as they are by abuse, mental or physical. This is damage by
omission, rather than commission, but it is no less severe and
long-lasting. Children are damaged when their “mercifully” inattentive
parents fail to make them sharp and observant and awake and leave them,
instead, in an unconscious and undifferentiated state. Children are
damaged when those charged with their care, afraid of any conflict or
upset, no longer dare to correct them, and leave them without guidance.
I can recognize such children on the street. They are doughy and
unfocused and vague. They are leaden and dull instead of golden and
bright. They are uncarved blocks, trapped in a perpetual state of
waiting-to-be.</p>
<p>Such children are chronically ignored by their peers. This is because
they are not fun to play with. Adults tend to manifest the same attitude
(although they will deny it desperately when pressed). When I worked in
daycare centres, early in my career, the comparatively neglected
children would come to me desperately, in their fumbling, half-formed
manner, with no sense of proper distance and no attentive playfulness.
They would flop, nearby—or directly on my lap, no matter what I was
doing—driven inexorably by the powerful desire for adult attention, the
necessary catalyst for further development. It was very difficult not to
react with annoyance, even disgust, to such children and their
too-prolonged infantilism—difficult not to literally push them
aside—even though I felt very badly for them, and understood their
predicament well. I believe that response, harsh and terrible though it
may be, was an almost universally-experienced internal warning signal
indicating the comparative danger of establishing a relationship with a
poorly socialized child: the likelihood of immediate and inappropriate
dependence (which should have been the responsibility of the parent) and
the tremendous demand of time and resources that accepting such
dependence would necessitate. Confronted with such a situation,
potentially friendly peers and interested adults are much more likely to
turn their attention to interacting with other children whose
cost/benefit ratio, to speak bluntly, would be much lower.</p>
<p>Parent or Friend</p>
<p>The neglect and mistreatment that is part and parcel of poorly
structured or even entirely absent disciplinary approaches can be
deliberate—motivated by explicit, conscious (if misguided) parental
motives. But more often than not, modern parents are simply paralyzed by
the fear that they will no longer be liked or even loved by their
children if they chastise them for any reason. They want their
children’s friendship above all, and are willing to sacrifice respect to
get it. This is not good. A child will have many friends, but only two
parents—if that—and parents are more, not less, than friends. Friends
have very limited authority to correct. Every parent therefore needs to
learn to tolerate the momentary anger or even hatred directed towards
them by their children, after necessary corrective action has been
taken, as the capacity of children to perceive or care about long-term
consequences is very limited. Parents are the arbiters of society. They
teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to
interact meaningfully and productively with them.</p>
<p>It is an act of responsibility to discipline a child. It is not anger
at misbehavior. It is not revenge for a misdeed. It is instead a careful
combination of mercy and long-term judgment. Proper discipline requires
effort—indeed, is virtually synonymous with effort. It is difficult to
pay careful attention to children. It is difficult to figure out what is
wrong and what is right and why. It is difficult to formulate just and
compassionate strategies of discipline, and to negotiate their
application with others deeply involved in a child’s care. Because of
this combination of responsibility and difficulty, any suggestion that
all constraints placed on children are damaging can be perversely
welcome. Such a notion, once accepted, allows adults who should know
better to abandon their duty to serve as agents of enculturation and
pretend that doing so is good for children. It’s a deep and pernicious
act of self-deception. It’s lazy, cruel and inexcusable. And our
proclivity to rationalize does not end there.</p>
<p>We assume that rules will irremediably inhibit what would otherwise
be the boundless and intrinsic creativity of our children, even though
the scientific literature clearly indicates, first, that creativity
beyond the trivial is shockingly rare96 and, second, that strict
limitations facilitate rather than inhibit creative achievement.97
Belief in the purely destructive element of rules and structure is
frequently conjoined with the idea that children will make good choices
about when to sleep and what to eat, if their perfect natures are merely
allowed to manifest themselves. These are equally ungrounded
assumptions. Children are perfectly capable of attempting to subsist on
hot dogs, chicken fingers and Froot Loops if doing so will attract
attention, provide power, or shield them from trying anything new.
Instead of going to bed wisely and peacefully, children will fight
night-time unconsciousness until they are staggered by fatigue. They are
also perfectly willing to provoke adults, while exploring the complex
contours of the social environment, just like juvenile chimps harassing
the adults in their troupes.98 Observing the consequences of teasing and
taunting enables chimp and child alike to discover the limits of what
might otherwise be a too-unstructured and terrifying freedom. Such
limits, when discovered, provide security, even if their detection
causes momentary disappointment or frustration.</p>
<p>I remember taking my daughter to the playground once when she was
about two. She was playing on the monkey bars, hanging in mid-air. A
particularly provocative little monster of about the same age was
standing above her on the same bar she was gripping. I watched him move
towards her. Our eyes locked. He slowly and deliberately stepped on her
hands, with increasing force, over and over, as he stared me down. He
knew exactly what he was doing. Up yours, Daddy-O—that was his
philosophy. He had already concluded that adults were contemptible, and
that he could safely defy them. (Too bad, then, that he was destined to
become one.) That was the hopeless future his parents had saddled him
with. To his great and salutary shock, I picked him bodily off the
playground structure, and threw him thirty feet down the field.</p>
<p>No, I didn’t. I just took my daughter somewhere else. But it would
have been better for him if I had.</p>
<p>Imagine a toddler repeatedly striking his mother in the face. Why
would he do such a thing? It’s a stupid question. It’s unacceptably
naive. The answer is obvious. To dominate his mother. To see if he can
get away with it. Violence, after all, is no mystery. It’s peace that’s
the mystery. Violence is the default. It’s easy. It’s peace that is
difficult: learned, inculcated, earned. (People often get basic
psychological questions backwards. Why do people take drugs? Not a
mystery. It’s why they don’t take them all the time that’s the mystery.
Why do people suffer from anxiety? That’s not a mystery. How is that
people can ever be calm? There’s the mystery. We’re breakable and
mortal. A million things can go wrong, in a million ways. We should be
terrified out of our skulls at every second. But we’re not. The same can
be said for depression, laziness and criminality.)</p>
<p>If I can hurt and overpower you, then I can do exactly what I want,
when I want, even when you’re around. I can torment you, to appease my
curiosity. I can take the attention away from you, and dominate you. I
can steal your toy. Children hit first because aggression is innate,
although more dominant in some individuals and less in others, and,
second, because aggression facilitates desire. It’s foolish to assume
that such behaviour must be learned. A snake does not have to be taught
to strike. It’s in the nature of the beast. Two-year-olds, statistically
speaking, are the most violent of people.99 They kick, hit and bite, and
they steal the property of others. They do so to explore, to express
outrage and frustration, and to gratify their impulsive desires. More
importantly, for our purposes, they do so to discover the true limits of
permissible behaviour. How else are they ever going to puzzle out what
is acceptable? Infants are like blind people, searching for a wall. They
have to push forward, and test, to see where the actual boundaries lie
(and those are too-seldom where they are said to be).</p>
<p>Consistent correction of such action indicates the limits of
acceptable aggression to the child. Its absence merely heightens
curiosity—so the child will hit and bite and kick, if he is aggressive
and dominant, until something indicates a limit. How hard can I hit
Mommy? Until she objects. Given that, correction is better sooner than
later (if the desired end result of the parent is not to be hit).
Correction also helps the child learn that hitting others is a
sub-optimal social strategy. Without that correction, no child is going
to undergo the effortful process of organizing and regulating their
impulses, so that those impulses can coexist, without conflict, within
the psyche of the child, and in the broader social world. It is no
simple matter to organize a mind.</p>
<p>My son was particularly ornery when he was a toddler. When my
daughter was little, I could paralyze her into immobility with an evil
glance. Such an intervention had no effect at all on my son. He had my
wife (who is no pushover) stymied at the dinner table by the time he was
nine months of age. He fought her for control over the spoon. “Good!” we
thought. We didn’t want to feed him one more minute than necessary
anyway. But the little blighter would only eat three or four mouthfuls.
Then he would play. He would stir his food around in his bowl. He would
drop bits of it over the high chair table top, and watch as it fell on
the floor below. No problem. He was exploring. But then he wasn’t eating
enough. Then, because he wasn’t eating enough, he wasn’t sleeping
enough. Then his midnight crying was waking his parents. Then they were
getting grumpy and out of sorts. He was frustrating his mother, and she
was taking it out on me. The trajectory wasn’t good.</p>
<p>After a few days of this degeneration, I decided to take the spoon
back. I prepared for war. I set aside sufficient time. A patient adult
can defeat a two-year-old, hard as that is to believe. As the saying
goes: “Old age and treachery can always overcome youth and skill.” This
is partly because time lasts forever, when you’re two. Half an hour for
me was a week for my son. I assured myself of victory. He was stubborn
and horrible. But I could be worse. We sat down, face to face, bowl in
front of him. It was High Noon. He knew it, and I knew it. He picked up
the spoon. I took it from him, and spooned up a delicious mouthful of
mush. I moved it deliberately towards his mouth. He eyed me in precisely
the same manner as the playground foot monster. He curled his lips
downward into a tight frown, rejecting all entry. I chased his mouth
around with the spoon as he twisted his head around in tight
circles.</p>
<p>But I had more tricks up my sleeve. I poked him in the chest, with my
free hand, in a manner calculated to annoy. He didn’t budge. I did it
again. And again. And again. Not hard—but not in a manner to be ignored,
either. Ten or so pokes letter, he opened his mouth, planning to emit a
sound of outrage. Hah! His mistake. I deftly inserted the spoon. He
tried, gamely, to force out the offending food with his tongue. But I
know how to deal with that, too. I just placed my forefinger
horizontally across his lips. Some came out. But some was swallowed,
too. Score one for Dad. I gave him a pat on the head, and told him that
he was a good boy. And I meant it. When someone does something you are
trying to get them to do, reward them. No grudge after victory. An hour
later, it was all over. There was outrage. There was some wailing. My
wife had to leave the room. The stress was too much. But food was eaten
by child. My son collapsed, exhausted, on my chest. We had a nap
together. And he liked me a lot better when he woke up than he had
before he was disciplined.</p>
<p>This was something I commonly observed when we went head to head—and
not only with him. A little later we entered into a babysitting swap
with another couple. All the kids would get together at one house. Then
one pair of parents would go out to dinner, or a movie, and leave the
other pair to watch the children, who were all under three. One evening,
another set of parents joined us. I was unfamiliar with their son, a
large, strong boy of two.</p>
<p>“He won’t sleep,” said his father. “After you put him to bed, he will
crawl out of his bed, and come downstairs. We usually put on an Elmo
video and let him watch it.”</p>
<p>“There’s no damn way I’m rewarding a recalcitrant child for
unacceptable behaviour,” I thought, “and I’m certainly not showing
anyone any Elmo video.” I always hated that creepy, whiny puppet. He was
a disgrace to Jim Henson’s legacy. So reward-by-Elmo was not on the
table. I didn’t say anything, of course. There is just no talking to
parents about their children—until they are ready to listen.</p>
<p>Two hours later, we put the kids to bed. Four of the five went
promptly to sleep—but not the Muppet aficionado. I had placed him in a
crib, however, so he couldn’t escape. But he could still howl, and
that’s exactly what he did. That was tricky. It was good strategy on his
part. It was annoying, and it threatened to wake up all the other kids,
who would then also start to howl. Score one for the kid. So, I
journeyed into the bedroom. “Lie down,” I said. That produced no effect.
“Lie down,” I said, “or I will lay you down.” Reasoning with kids isn’t
often of too much use, particularly under such circumstances, but I
believe in fair warning. Of course, he didn’t lie down. He howled again,
for effect.</p>
<p>Kids do this frequently. Scared parents think that a crying child is
always sad or hurt. This is simply not true. Anger is one of the most
common reasons for crying. Careful analysis of the musculature patterns
of crying children has confirmed this.100 Anger-crying and
fear-or-sadness crying do not look the same. They also don’t sound the
same, and can be distinguished with careful attention. Anger-crying is
often an act of dominance, and should be dealt with as such. I lifted
him up, and laid him down. Gently. Patiently. But firmly. He got up. I
laid him down. He got up. I laid him down. He got up. This time, I laid
him down, and kept my hand on his back. He struggled, mightily, but
ineffectually. He was, after all, only one-tenth my size. I could take
him with one hand. So, I kept him down and spoke calmly to him and told
him he was a good boy and that he should relax. I gave him a soother and
pounded gently on his back. He started to relax. His eyes began to
close. I removed my hand.</p>
<p>He promptly got to his feet. I was impressed. The kid had spirit! I
lifted him up, and laid him down, again. “Lie down, monster,” I said. I
pounded his back gently some more. Some kids find that soothing. He was
getting tired. He was ready to capitulate. He closed his eyes. I got to
my feet, and headed quietly and quickly to the door. I glanced back, to
check his position, one last time. He was back on his feet. I pointed my
finger at him. “Down, monster,” I said, and I meant it. He went down
like a shot. I closed the door. We liked each other. Neither my wife nor
I heard a peep out of him for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>“How was the kid?” his father asked me when he got home, much later
that night. “Good,” I said. “No problem at all. He’s asleep right
now.”</p>
<p>“Did he get up?” said his father.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “He slept the whole time.”</p>
<p>Dad looked at me. He wanted to know. But he didn’t ask. And I didn’t
tell.</p>
<p>Don’t cast pearls before swine, as the old saying goes. And you might
think that’s harsh. But training your child not to sleep, and rewarding
him with the antics of a creepy puppet? That’s harsh too. You pick your
poison, and I’ll pick mine.</p>
<p>Discipline and Punish</p>
<p>Modern parents are terrified of two frequently juxtaposed words:
discipline and punish. They evoke images of prisons, soldiers and
jackboots. The distance between disciplinarian and tyrant or punishment
and torture is, indeed, easily traversed. Discipline and punish must be
handled with care. The fear is unsurprising. But both are necessary.
They can be applied unconsciously or consciously, badly or well, but
there is no escaping their use.</p>
<p>It’s not that it’s impossible to discipline with reward. In fact,
rewarding good behaviour can be very effective. The most famous of all
behavioural psychologists, B.F. Skinner, was a great advocate of this
approach. He was expert at it. He taught pigeons to play ping-pong,
although they only rolled the ball back and forth by pecking it with
their beaks.101 But they were pigeons. So even though they played badly,
it was still pretty good. Skinner even taught his birds to pilot
missiles during the Second World War, in Project Pigeon (later
Orcon).102 He got a long way, before the invention of electronic
guidance systems rendered his efforts obsolete.</p>
<p>Skinner observed the animals he was training to perform such acts
with exceptional care. Any actions that approximated what he was aiming
at were immediately followed by a reward of just the right size: not
small enough to be inconsequential, and not so large that it devalued
future rewards. Such an approach can be used with children, and works
very well. Imagine that you would like your toddler to help set the
table. It’s a useful skill. You’d like him better if he could do it. It
would be good for his (shudder) self-esteem. So, you break the target
behaviour down into its component parts. One element of setting the
table is carrying a plate from the cupboard to the table. Even that
might be too complex. Perhaps your child has only been walking a few
months. He’s still wobbly and unreliable. So, you start his training by
handing him a plate and having him hand it back. A pat on the head could
follow. You might turn it into a game. Pass with your left. Switch to
your right. Circle around your back. Then you might give him a plate and
take a few steps backward so that he has to traverse a few steps before
giving it back. Train him to become a plate-handling virtuoso. Don’t
leave him trapped in his klutz-dom.</p>
<p>You can teach virtually anyone anything with such an approach. First,
figure out what you want. Then, watch the people around you like a hawk.
Finally, whenever you see anything a bit more like what you want, swoop
in (hawk, remember) and deliver a reward. Your daughter has been very
reserved since she became a teenager. You wish she would talk more.
That’s the target: more communicative daughter. One morning, over
breakfast, she shares an anecdote about school. That’s an excellent time
to pay attention. That’s the reward. Stop texting and listen. Unless you
don’t want her to tell you anything ever again.</p>
<p>Parental interventions that make children happy clearly can and
should be used to shape behaviour. The same goes for husbands, wives,
co-workers and parents. Skinner, however, was a realist. He noted that
use of reward was very difficult: the observer had to attend patiently
until the target spontaneously manifested the desired behaviour, and
then reinforce. This required a lot of time, and a lot of waiting, and
that’s a problem. He also had to starve his animals down to
three-quarters of their normal body weight before they would become
interested enough in food reward to truly pay attention. But these are
not the only shortcomings of the purely positive approach.</p>
<p>Negative emotions, like their positive counterparts, help us learn.
We need to learn, because we’re stupid and easily damaged. We can die.
That’s not good, and we don’t feel good about it. If we did, we would
seek death, and then we would die. We don’t even feel good about dying
if it only might happen. And that’s all the time. In that manner,
negative emotions, for all their unpleasantness, protect us. We feel
hurt and scared and ashamed and disgusted so we can avoid damage. And
we’re susceptible to feeling such things a lot. In fact, we feel more
negative about a loss of a given size than we feel good about the
same-sized gain. Pain is more potent than pleasure, and anxiety more
than hope.</p>
<p>Emotions, positive and negative, come in two usefully differentiated
variants. Satisfaction (technically, satiation) tells us that what we
did was good, while hope (technically, incentive reward) indicates that
something pleasurable is on the way. Pain hurts us, so we won’t repeat
actions that produced personal damage or social isolation (as loneliness
is also, technically, a form of pain). Anxiety makes us stay away from
hurtful people and bad places so we don’t have to feel pain. All these
emotions must be balanced against each other, and carefully judged in
context, but they’re all required to keep us alive and thriving. We
therefore do our children a disservice by failing to use whatever is
available to help them learn, including negative emotions, even though
such use should occur in the most merciful possible manner.</p>
<p>Skinner knew that threats and punishments could stop unwanted
behaviours, just as reward reinforces what is desirable. In a world
paralyzed at the thought of interfering with the hypothetically pristine
path of natural child development, it can be difficult even to discuss
the former techniques. However, children would not have such a lengthy
period of natural development, prior to maturity, if their behaviour did
not have to be shaped. They would just leap out of the womb, ready to
trade stocks. Children also cannot be fully sheltered from fear and
pain. They are small and vulnerable. They don’t know much about the
world. Even when they are doing something as natural as learning to
walk, they’re constantly being walloped by the world. And this is to say
nothing of the frustration and rejection they inevitably experience when
dealing with siblings and peers and uncooperative, stubborn adults.
Given this, the fundamental moral question is not how to shelter
children completely from misadventure and failure, so they never
experience any fear or pain, but how to maximize their learning so that
useful knowledge may be gained with minimal cost.</p>
<p>In the Disney movie Sleeping Beauty, the King and Queen have a
daughter, the princess Aurora, after a long wait. They plan a great
christening, to introduce her to the world. They welcome everyone who
loves and honours their new daughter. But they fail to invite Maleficent
(malicious, malevolent), who is essentially Queen of the Underworld, or
Nature in her negative guise. This means, symbolically, that the two
monarchs are overprotecting their beloved daughter, by setting up a
world around her that has nothing negative in it. But this does not
protect her. It makes her weak. Maleficent curses the princess,
sentencing her to death at the age of sixteen, caused by the prick of a
spinning wheel’s needle. The spinning wheel is the wheel of fate; the
prick, which produces blood, symbolizes the loss of virginity, a sign of
the emergence of the woman from the child.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a good fairy (the positive element of Nature) reduces
the punishment to unconsciousness, redeemable with love’s first kiss.
The panicked King and Queen get rid of all the spinning wheels in the
land, and turn their daughter over to the much-too-nice good fairies, of
whom there are three. They continue with their strategy of removing all
dangerous things—but in doing so they leave their daughter naïve,
immature and weak. One day, just before Aurora’s sixteenth birthday, she
meets a prince in the forest, and falls in love, the same day. By any
reasonable standard, that’s a bit much. Then she loudly bemoans the fact
that she is to be wed to Prince Philip, to whom she was betrothed as a
child, and collapses emotionally when she is brought back to her
parents’ castle for her birthday. It is at that moment that Maleficent’s
curse manifests itself. A portal opens up in the castle, a spinning
wheel appears, and Aurora pricks her finger and falls unconscious. She
becomes Sleeping Beauty. In doing so (again, symbolically speaking) she
chooses unconsciousness over the terror of adult life. Something
existentially similar to this often occurs very frequently with
overprotected children, who can be brought low—and then desire the bliss
of unconsciousness—by their first real contact with failure or, worse,
genuine malevolence, which they do not or will not understand and
against which they have no defence.</p>
<p>Take the case of the three-year-old who has not learned to share. She
displays her selfish behaviour in the presence of her parents, but
they’re too nice to intervene. More truthfully, they refuse to pay
attention, admit to what is happening, and teach her how to act
properly. They’re annoyed, of course, when she won’t share with her
sister, but they pretend everything is OK. It’s not OK. They’ll snap at
her later, for something totally unrelated. She will be hurt by that,
and confused, but learn nothing. Worse: when she tries to make friends,
it won’t go well, because of her lack of social sophistication. Children
her own age will be put off by her inability to cooperate. They’ll fight
with her, or wander off and find someone else to play with. The parents
of those children will observe her awkwardness and misbehaviour, and
won’t invite her back to play with their kids. She will be lonely and
rejected. That will produce anxiety, depression and resentment. That
will produce the turning from life that is equivalent to the wish for
unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Parents who refuse to adopt the responsibility for disciplining their
children think they can just opt out of the conflict necessary for
proper child-rearing. They avoid being the bad guy (in the short term).
But they do not at all rescue or protect their children from fear and
pain. Quite the contrary: the judgmental and uncaring broader social
world will mete out conflict and punishment far greater than that which
would have been delivered by an awake parent. You can discipline your
children, or you can turn that responsibility over to the harsh,
uncaring judgmental world—and the motivation for the latter decision
should never be confused with love.</p>
<p>You might object, as modern parents sometimes do: why should a child
even be subject to the arbitrary dictates of a parent? In fact, there is
a new variant of politically correct thinking that presumes that such an
idea is “adultism:”103 a form of prejudice and oppression analogous to,
say, sexism or racism. The question of adult authority must be answered
with care. That requires a thorough examination of the question itself.
Accepting an objection as formulated is halfway to accepting its
validity, and that can be dangerous if the question is ill-posed. Let’s
break it down.</p>
<p>First, why should a child be subject? That’s easy. Every child must
listen to and obey adults because he or she is dependent on the care
that one or more imperfect grown-ups is willing to bestow. Given this,
it is better for the child to act in a manner that invites genuine
affection and goodwill. Something even better might be imagined. The
child could act in a manner that simultaneously ensures optimal adult
attention, in a manner that benefits his or her present state of being
and future development. That’s a very high standard, but it’s in the
best interests of the child, so there is every reason to aspire to
it.</p>
<p>Every child should also be taught to comply gracefully with the
expectations of civil society. This does not mean crushed into mindless
ideological conformity. It means instead that parents must reward those
attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world
outside the family, and use threat and punishment when necessary to
eliminate behaviours that will lead to misery and failure. There’s a
tight window of opportunity for this, as well, so getting it right
quickly matters. If a child has not been taught to behave properly by
the age of four, it will forever be difficult for him or her to make
friends. The research literature is quite clear on this. This matters,
because peers are the primary source of socialization after the age of
four. Rejected children cease to develop, because they are alienated
from their peers. They fall further and further behind, as the other
children continue to progress. Thus, the friendless child too often
becomes the lonely, antisocial or depressed teenager and adult. This is
not good. Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a
consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community. We must be
continually reminded to think and act properly. When we drift, people
that care for and love us nudge us in small ways and large back on
track. So, we better have some of those people around.</p>
<p>It’s also not the case (back to the question) that adult dictates are
all arbitrary. That’s only true in a dysfunctional totalitarian state.
But in civilized, open societies, the majority abide by a functional
social contract, aimed at mutual betterment—or at least at existence in
close proximity without too much violence. Even a system of rules that
allows for only that minimum contract is by no means arbitrary, given
the alternatives. If a society does not adequately reward productive,
pro-social behavior, insists upon distributing resources in a markedly
arbitrary and unfair manner, and allows for theft and exploitation, it
will not remain conflict-free for long. If its hierarchies are based
only (or even primarily) on power, instead of the competence necessary
to get important and difficult things done, it will be prone to
collapse, as well. This is even true, in simpler form, of the
hierarchies of chimpanzees, which is an indication of its fundamental,
biological and non-arbitrary emergent truth.104</p>
<p>Poorly socialized children have terrible lives. Thus, it is better to
socialize them optimally. Some of this can be done with reward, but not
all of it. The issue is therefore not whether to use punishment and
threat. The issue is whether to do it consciously and thoughtfully. How,
then, should children be disciplined? This is a very difficult question,
because children (and parents) differ vastly in their temperaments. Some
children are agreeable. They deeply want to please, but pay for that
with a tendency to be conflict-averse and dependent. Others are
tougher-minded and more independent. Those kids want to do what they
want, when they want, all the time. They can be challenging,
non-compliant and stubborn. Some children are desperate for rules and
structure, and are content even in rigid environments. Others, with
little regard for predictability and routine, are immune to demands for
even minimal necessary order. Some are wildly imaginative and creative,
and others more concrete and conservative. These are all deep, important
differences, heavily influenced by biological factors and difficult to
modify socially. It is fortunate indeed that in the face of such
variability we are the beneficiaries of much thoughtful meditation on
the proper use of social control.</p>
<p>Minimum Necessary Force</p>
<p>Here’s a straightforward initial idea: rules should not be multiplied
beyond necessity. Alternatively stated, bad laws drive out respect for
good laws. This is the ethical—even legal—equivalent of Occam’s razor,
the scientist’s conceptual guillotine, which states that the simplest
possible hypothesis is preferable. So, don’t encumber children—or their
disciplinarians—with too many rules. That path leads to frustration.</p>
<p>Limit the rules. Then, figure out what to do when one of them gets
broken. A general, context-independent rule for punishment severity is
hard to establish. However, a helpful norm has already been enshrined in
English common law, one of the great products of Western civilization.
Its analysis can help us establish a second useful principle.</p>
<p>English common law allows you to defend your rights, but only in a
reasonable manner. Someone breaks into your house. You have a loaded
pistol. You have a right to defend yourself, but it’s better to do it in
stages. What if it’s a drunk and confused neighbour? “Shoot ’em!” you
think. But it’s not that simple. So, you say, instead, “Stop! I have a
gun.” If that produces neither explanation nor retreat, you might
consider a warning shot. Then, if the perpetrator still advances, you
might take aim at his leg. (Don’t mistake any of this for legal advice.
It’s an example.) A single brilliantly practical principle can be used
to generate all these incrementally more severe reactions: that of
minimum necessary force. So now we have two general principles of
discipline. The first: limit the rules. The second: Use the least force
necessary to enforce those rules.</p>
<p>About the first principle, you might ask, “Limit the rules to what,
exactly?” Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in
self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don’t end
up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are
happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to
share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by
adults, so they don’t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you
something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can
have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your
belongings, because you need to learn how and because you’re lucky to
have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that
you’re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you’re
around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these
rules will be welcome everywhere.</p>
<p>About the second, equally important principle, your question might
be: What is minimum necessary force? This must be established
experimentally, starting with the smallest possible intervention. Some
children will be turned to stone by a glare. A verbal command will stop
another. A thumb-cocked flick of the index finger on a small hand might
be necessary for some. Such a strategy is particularly useful in public
places such as restaurants. It can be administered suddenly, quietly and
effectively, without risking escalation. What’s the alternative? A child
who is crying angrily, demanding attention, is not making himself
popular. A child who is running from table to table and disrupting
everyone’s peace is bringing disgrace (an old word, but a good one) on
himself and his parents. Such outcomes are far from optimal, and
children will definitely misbehave more in public, because they are
experimenting: trying to establish if the same old rules also apply in
the new place. They don’t sort that out verbally, not when they are
under three.</p>
<p>When our children were little and we took them to restaurants, they
attracted smiles. They sat nicely and ate politely. They couldn’t keep
it up for long, but we didn’t keep them there too long. When they
started to get antsy, after sitting for forty-five minutes, we knew it
was time to go. That was part of the deal. Nearby diners would tell us
how nice it was to see a happy family. We weren’t always happy, and our
children weren’t always properly behaved. But they were most of the
time, and it was wonderful to see people responding so positively to
their presence. It was truly good for the kids. They could see that
people liked them. This also reinforced their good behaviour. That was
the reward.</p>
<p>People will really like your kids if you give them the chance. This
is something I learned as soon as we had our first baby, our daughter,
Mikhaila. When we took her down the street in her little foldup stroller
in our French Montreal working-class neighbourhood, rough-looking
heavy-drinking lumberjack types would stop in their tracks and smile at
her. They would coo and giggle and make stupid faces. Watching people
respond to children restores your faith in human nature. All that’s
multiplied when your kids behave in public. To ensure that such things
happen, you have to discipline your children carefully and
effectively—and to do that, you have to know something about reward, and
about punishment, instead of shying away from the knowledge.</p>
<p>Part of establishing a relationship with your son or daughter is
learning how that small person responds to disciplinary intervention—and
then intervening effectively. It’s very easy to mouth clichés instead,
such as: “There is no excuse for physical punishment,” or, “Hitting
children merely teaches them to hit.” Let’s start with the former claim:
there is no excuse for physical punishment. First, we should note the
widespread consensus around the idea that some forms of misbehavior,
particularly those associated with theft and assault, are both wrong and
should be subject to sanction. Second, we should note that almost all
those sanctions involve punishment in its many psychological and more
directly physical forms. Deprivation of liberty causes pain in a manner
essentially similar to that of physical trauma. The same can be said of
the use of social isolation (including time out). We know this
neurobiologically. The same brain areas mediate response to all three,
and all are ameliorated by the same class of drugs, opiates.105 Jail is
clearly physical punishment—particularly solitary confinement—even when
nothing violent happens. Third, we should note that some misbegotten
actions must be brought to a halt both effectively and immediately, not
least so that something worse doesn’t happen. What’s the proper
punishment for someone who will not stop poking a fork into an
electrical socket? Or who runs away laughing in a crowded supermarket
parking lot? The answer is simple: whatever will stop it fastest, within
reason. Because the alternative could be fatal.</p>
<p>That’s pretty obvious, in the case of parking lot or outlet. But the
same thing applies in the social realm, and that brings us to the fourth
point regarding excuses for physical punishment. The penalties for
misbehavior (of the sort that could have been effectively halted in
childhood) become increasingly severe as children get older—and it is
disproportionately those who remain unsocialized effectively by age four
who end up punished explicitly by society in their later youth and early
adulthood. Those unconstrained four-year-olds, in turn, are often those
who were unduly aggressive, by nature, at age two. They were
statistically more likely than their peers to kick, hit, bite and take
away toys (later known as stealing). They comprise about five per cent
of boys, and a much smaller percentage of girls.106 To unthinkingly
parrot the magic line “There is no excuse for physical punishment” is
also to foster the delusion that teenage devils magically emerge from
once-innocent little child-angels. You’re not doing your child any
favors by overlooking any misbehavior (particularly if he or she is
temperamentally more aggressive).</p>
<p>To hold the no excuse for physical punishment theory is also (fifth)
to assume that the word no can be effectively uttered to another person
in the absence of the threat of punishment. A woman can say no to a
powerful, narcissistic man only because she has social norms, the law
and the state backing her up. A parent can only say no to a child who
wants a third piece of cake because he or she is larger, stronger and
more capable than the child (and is additionally backed up in his
authority by law and state). What no means, in the final analysis, is
always “If you continue to do that, something you do not like will
happen to you.” Otherwise it means nothing. Or, worse, it means “another
nonsensical nothing muttered by ignorable adults.” Or, worse still, it
means, “all adults are ineffectual and weak.” This is a particularly bad
lesson, when every child’s destiny is to become an adult, and when most
things that are learned without undue personal pain are modelled or
explicitly taught by adults). What does a child who ignores adults and
holds them in contempt have to look forward to? Why grow up at all? And
that’s the story of Peter Pan, who thinks all adults are variants of
Captain Hook, tyrannical and terrified of his own mortality (think
hungry crocodile with clock in his stomach). The only time no ever means
no in the absence of violence is when it is uttered by one civilized
person to another.</p>
<p>And what about the idea that hitting a child merely teaches them to
hit? First: No. Wrong. Too simple. For starters, “hitting” is a very
unsophisticated word to describe the disciplinary act of an effective
parent. If “hitting” accurately described the entire range of physical
force, then there would be no difference between rain droplets and atom
bombs. Magnitude matters—and so does context, if we’re not being
wilfully blind and naïve about the issue. Every child knows the
difference between being bitten by a mean, unprovoked dog and being
nipped by his own pet when he tries playfully but too carelessly to take
its bone. How hard someone is hit, and why they are hit, cannot merely
be ignored when speaking of hitting. Timing, part of context, is also of
crucial importance. If you flick your two-year-old with your finger just
after he smacks the baby on the head with a wooden block, he will get
the connection, and be at least somewhat less willing to smack her again
in the future. That seems like a good outcome. He certainly won’t
conclude that he should hit her more, using the flick of his mother’s
finger as an example. He’s not stupid. He’s just jealous, impulsive and
not very sophisticated. And how else are you going to protect his
younger sibling? If you discipline ineffectively, then the baby will
suffer. Maybe for years. The bullying will continue, because you won’t
do a damn thing to stop it. You’ll avoid the conflict that’s necessary
to establish peace. You’ll turn a blind eye. And then later, when the
younger child confronts you (maybe even in adulthood), you’ll say, “I
never knew it was like that.” You just didn’t want to know. So, you
didn’t. You just rejected the responsibility of discipline, and
justified it with a continual show of your niceness. Every gingerbread
house has a witch inside it that devours children.</p>
<p>So where does all that leave us? With the decision to discipline
effectively, or to discipline ineffectively (but never the decision to
forego discipline altogether, because nature and society will punish in
a draconian manner whatever errors of childhood behavior remain
uncorrected). So here are a few practical hints: time out can be an
extremely effective form of punishment, particularly if the misbehaving
child is welcome as soon as he controls his temper. An angry child
should sit by himself until he calms down. Then he should be allowed to
return to normal life. That means the child wins—instead of his anger.
The rule is “Come be with us as soon as you can behave properly.” This
is a very good deal for child, parent and society. You’ll be able to
tell if your child has really regained control. You’ll like him again,
despite his earlier misbehaviour. If you’re still mad, maybe he hasn’t
completely repented—or maybe you should do something about your tendency
to hold a grudge.</p>
<p>If your child is the kind of determined varmint who simply runs away,
laughing, when placed on the steps or in his room, physical restraint
might have to be added to the time out routine. A child can be held
carefully but firmly by the upper arms, until he or she stops squirming
and pays attention. If that fails, being turned over a parent’s knee
might be required. For the child who is pushing the limits in a
spectacularly inspired way, a swat across the backside can indicate
requisite seriousness on the part of a responsible adult. There are some
situations in which even that will not suffice, partly because some
children are very determined, exploratory, and tough, or because the
offending behaviour is truly severe. And if you’re not thinking such
things through, then you’re not acting responsibly as a parent. You’re
leaving the dirty work to someone else, who will be much dirtier doing
it.</p>
<p>A Summary of Principles</p>
<p>Disciplinary principle 1: limit the rules. Principle 2: use minimum
necessary force. Here’s a third: parents should come in pairs.107
Raising young children is demanding and exhausting. Because of this,
it’s easy for a parent to make a mistake. Insomnia, hunger, the
aftermath of an argument, a hangover, a bad day at work—any of these
things singly can make a person unreasonable, while in combination they
can produce someone dangerous. Under such circumstances, it is necessary
to have someone else around, to observe, and step in, and discuss. This
will make it less likely that a whiny provocative child and her fed-up
cranky parent will excite each other to the point of no return. Parents
should come in pairs so the father of a newborn can watch the new mother
so she won’t get worn out and do something desperate after hearing her
colicky baby wail from eleven in the evening until five in the morning
for thirty nights in a row. I am not saying we should be mean to single
mothers, many of whom struggle impossibly and courageously—and a
proportion of whom have had to escape, singly, from a brutal
relationship—but that doesn’t mean we should pretend that all family
forms are equally viable. They’re not. Period.</p>
<p>Here’s a fourth principle, one that is more particularly
psychological: parents should understand their own capacity to be harsh,
vengeful, arrogant, resentful, angry and deceitful. Very few people set
out, consciously, to do a terrible job as father or mother, but bad
parenting happens all the time. This is because people have a great
capacity for evil, as well as good—and because they remain willfully
blind to that fact. People are aggressive and selfish, as well as kind
and thoughtful. For this reason, no adult human being—no hierarchical,
predatory ape—can truly tolerate being dominated by an upstart child.
Revenge will come. Ten minutes after a pair of all-too-nice-and-patient
parents have failed to prevent a public tantrum at the local
supermarket, they will pay their toddler back with the cold shoulder
when he runs up, excited, to show mom and dad his newest accomplishment.
Enough embarrassment, disobedience, and dominance challenge, and even
the most hypothetically selfless parent will become resentful. And then
the real punishment will begin. Resentment breeds the desire for
vengeance. Fewer spontaneous offers of love will be offered, with more
rationalizations for their absence. Fewer opportunities for the personal
development of the child will be sought out. A subtle turning away will
begin. And this is only the beginning of the road to total familial
warfare, conducted mostly in the underworld, underneath the false façade
of normality and love.</p>
<p>This frequently-travelled path is much better avoided. A parent who
is seriously aware of his or her limited tolerance and capacity for
misbehaviour when provoked can therefore seriously plan a proper
disciplinary strategy—particularly if monitored by an equally awake
partner—and never let things degenerate to the point where genuine
hatred emerges. Beware. There are toxic families everywhere. They make
no rules and limit no misbehaviour. The parents lash out randomly and
unpredictably. The children live in that chaos and are crushed, if
they’re timid, or rebel, counterproductively, if they’re tough. It’s not
good. It can get murderous.</p>
<p>Here’s a fifth and final and most general principle. Parents have a
duty to act as proxies for the real world—merciful proxies, caring
proxies—but proxies, nonetheless. This obligation supersedes any
responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost
self-esteem. It is the primary duty of parents to make their children
socially desirable. That will provide the child with opportunity,
self-regard, and security. It’s more important even than fostering
individual identity. That Holy Grail can only be pursued, in any case,
after a high degree of social sophistication has been established.</p>
<p>The Good Child—and the Responsible Parent</p>
<p>A properly socialized three-year-old is polite and engaging. She’s
also no pushover. She evokes interest from other children and
appreciation from adults. She exists in a world where other kids welcome
her and compete for her attention, and where adults are happy to see
her, instead of hiding behind false smiles. She will be introduced to
the world by people who are pleased to do so. This will do more for her
eventual individuality than any cowardly parental attempt to avoid
day-to-day conflict and discipline.</p>
<p>Discuss your likes and dislikes with regards to your children with
your partner or, failing that, a friend. But do not be afraid to have
likes and dislikes. You can judge suitable from unsuitable, and wheat
from chaff. You realize the difference between good and evil. Having
clarified your stance—having assessed yourself for pettiness, arrogance
and resentment—you take the next step, and you make your children
behave. You take responsibility for their discipline. You take
responsibility for the mistakes you will inevitably make while
disciplining. You can apologize, when you’re wrong, and learn to do
better.</p>
<p>You love your kids, after all. If their actions make you dislike
them, think what an effect they will have on other people, who care much
less about them than you. Those other people will punish them, severely,
by omission or commission. Don’t allow that to happen. Better to let
your little monsters know what is desirable and what is not, so they
become sophisticated denizens of the world outside the family.</p>
<p>A child who pays attention, instead of drifting, and can play, and
does not whine, and is comical, but not annoying, and is
trustworthy—that child will have friends wherever he goes. His teachers
will like him, and so will his parents. If he attends politely to
adults, he will be attended to, smiled at and happily instructed. He
will thrive, in what can so easily be a cold, unforgiving and hostile
world. Clear rules make for secure children and calm, rational parents.
Clear principles of discipline and punishment balance mercy and justice
so that social development and psychological maturity can be optimally
promoted. Clear rules and proper discipline help the child, and the
family, and society, establish, maintain and expand the order that is
all that protects us from chaos and the terrors of the underworld, where
everything is uncertain, anxiety-provoking, hopeless and depressing.
There are no greater gifts that a committed and courageous parent can
bestow.</p>
<p>Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.</p>
