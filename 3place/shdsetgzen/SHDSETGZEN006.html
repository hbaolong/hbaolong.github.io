<h4 id="rule-3">RULE 3</h4>
<p>MAKE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT THE BEST FOR YOU</p>
<p>THE OLD HOMETOWN</p>
<p>The town I grew up in had been scraped only fifty years earlier out
of the endless flat Northern prairie. Fairview, Alberta, was part of the
frontier, and had the cowboy bars to prove it. The Hudson’s Bay
Co. department store on Main Street still bought beaver, wolf and coyote
furs directly from the local trappers. Three thousand people lived
there, four hundred miles away from the nearest city. Cable TV, video
games and internet did not exist. It was no easy matter to stay
innocently amused in Fairview, particularly during the five months of
winter, when long stretches of forty-below days and even colder nights
were the norm.</p>
<p>The world is a different place when it’s cold like that. The drunks
in our town ended their sad lives early. They passed out in snowbanks at
three in the morning and froze to death. You don’t go outside casually
when it’s forty below. On first breath, the arid desert air constricts
your lungs. Ice forms on your eyelashes and they stick together. Long
hair, wet from the shower, freezes solid and then stands on end
wraith-like of its own accord later in a warm house, when it thaws bone
dry, charged with electricity. Children only put their tongues on steel
playground equipment once. Smoke from house chimneys doesn’t rise.
Defeated by the cold, it drifts downwards, and collects like fog on
snow-covered rooftops and yards. Cars must be plugged in at night, their
engines warmed by block heaters, or oil will not flow through them in
the morning, and they won’t start. Sometimes they won’t anyway. Then you
turn the engine over pointlessly until the starter clatters and falls
silent. Then you remove the frozen battery from the car, loosening bolts
with stiffening fingers in the intense cold, and bring it into the
house. It sits there, sweating for hours, until it warms enough to hold
a decent charge. You are not going to see out of the back window of your
car, either. It frosts over in November and stays that way until May.
Scraping it off just dampens the upholstery. Then it’s frozen, too. Late
one night going to visit a friend I sat for two hours on the edge of the
passenger seat in a 1970 Dodge Challenger, jammed up against the
stick-shift, using a vodka-soaked rag to keep the inside of the front
windshield clear in front of the driver because the car heater had quit.
Stopping wasn’t an option. There was nowhere to stop.</p>
<p>And it was hell on house cats. Felines in Fairview had short ears and
tails because they had lost the tips of both to frostbite. They came to
resemble Arctic foxes, which evolved those features to deal proactively
with the intense cold. One day our cat got outside and no one noticed.
We found him, later, fur frozen fast to the cold hard backdoor cement
steps where he sat. We carefully separated cat from concrete, with no
lasting damage—except to his pride. Fairview cats were also at great
risk in the winter from cars, but not for the reasons you think. It
wasn’t automobiles sliding on icy roads and running them over. Only
loser cats died that way. It was cars parked immediately after being
driven that were dangerous. A frigid cat might think highly of climbing
up under such a vehicle and sitting on its still-warm engine block. But
what if the driver decided to use the car again, before the engine
cooled down and cat departed? Let’s just say that heat-seeking
house-pets and rapidly rotating radiator fans do not coexist
happily.</p>
<p>Because we were so far north, the bitterly cold winters were also
very dark. By December, the sun didn’t rise until 9:30 a.m. We trudged
to school in the pitch black. It wasn’t much lighter when we walked
home, just before the early sunset. There wasn’t much for young people
to do in Fairview, even in the summer. But the winters were worse. Then
your friends mattered. More than anything.</p>
<p>My Friend Chris and His Cousin</p>
<p>I had a friend at that time. We’ll call him Chris. He was a smart
guy. He read a lot. He liked science fiction of the kind I was attracted
to (Bradbury, Heinlein, Clarke). He was inventive. He was interested in
electronic kits and gears and motors. He was a natural engineer. All
this was overshadowed, however, by something that had gone wrong in his
family. I don’t know what it was. His sisters were smart and his father
was soft-spoken and his mother was kind. The girls seemed OK. But Chris
had been left unattended to in some important way. Despite his
intelligence and curiosity he was angry, resentful and without hope.</p>
<p>All this manifested itself in material form in the shape of his 1972
blue Ford pickup truck. That notorious vehicle had at least one dent in
every quarter panel of its damaged external body. Worse, it had an
equivalent number of dents inside. Those were produced by the impact of
the body parts of friends against the internal surfaces during the
continual accidents that resulted in the outer dents. Chris’s truck was
the exoskeleton of a nihilist. It had the perfect bumper sticker: Be
Alert—The World Needs More Lerts. The irony it produced in combination
with the dents elevated it nicely to theatre of the absurd. Very little
of that was (so to speak) accidental.</p>
<p>Every time Chris crashed his truck, his father would fix it, and buy
him something else. He had a motorbike and a van for selling ice cream.
He did not care for his motorbike. He sold no ice cream. He often
expressed dissatisfaction with his father and their relationship. But
his dad was older and unwell, diagnosed with an illness only after many
years. He didn’t have the energy he should have. Maybe he couldn’t pay
enough attention to his son. Maybe that’s all it took to fracture their
relationship.</p>
<p>Chris had a cousin, Ed, who was about two years younger. I liked him,
as much as you can like the younger cousin of a teenage friend. He was a
tall, smart, charming, good-looking kid. He was witty, too. You would
have predicted a good future for him, had you met him when he was
twelve. But Ed drifted slowly downhill, into a dropout, semi-drifting
mode of existence. He didn’t get as angry as Chris, but he was just as
confused. If you knew Ed’s friends, you might say that it was peer
pressure that set him on his downward path. But his peers weren’t
obviously any more lost or delinquent than he was, although they were
generally somewhat less bright. It was also the case that Ed’s—and
Chris’s—situation did not appear particularly improved by their
discovery of marijuana. Marijuana isn’t bad for everyone any more than
alcohol is bad for everyone. Sometimes it even appears to improve
people. But it didn’t improve Ed. It didn’t improve Chris, either.</p>
<p>To amuse ourselves in the long nights, Chris and I and Ed and the
rest of the teenagers drove around and around in our 1970s cars and
pickup trucks. We cruised down Main Street, along Railroad Avenue, up
past the high school, around the north end of town, over to the west—or
up Main Street, around the north end of town, over to the east—and so
on, endlessly repeating the theme. If we weren’t driving in town, we
were driving in the countryside. A century earlier, surveyors had laid
out a vast grid across the entire three-hundred-thousand-square-mile
expanse of the great western prairie. Every two miles north, a plowed
gravel road stretched forever, east to west. Every mile west, another
travelled north and south. We never ran out of roads.</p>
<p>Teenage Wasteland</p>
<p>If we weren’t circling around town and countryside we were at a
party. Some relatively young adult (or some relatively creepy older
adult) would open his house to friends. It would then become temporary
home to all manner of party crashers, many of whom started out seriously
undesirable or quickly become that way when drinking. A party might also
happen accidentally, when some teenager’s unwitting parents had left
town. In that case, the occupants of the cars or trucks always cruising
around would notice house lights on, but household car absent. This was
not good. Things could get seriously out of hand.</p>
<p>I did not like teenage parties. I do not remember them nostalgically.
They were dismal affairs. The lights were kept low. That kept
self-consciousness to a minimum. The over-loud music made conversation
impossible. There was little to talk about in any case. There were
always a couple of the town psychopaths attending. Everybody drank and
smoked too much. A dreary and oppressive sense of aimlessness hung over
such occasions, and nothing ever happened (unless you count the time my
too-quiet classmate drunkenly began to brandish his fully-loaded
12-gauge shotgun, or the time the girl I later married contemptuously
insulted someone while he threatened her with a knife, or the time
another friend climbed a large tree, swung out on a branch, and crashed
flat onto his back, half dead right beside the campfire we had started
at its base, followed precisely one minute later by his halfwit
sidekick).</p>
<p>No one knew what the hell they were doing at those parties. Hoping
for a cheerleader? Waiting for Godot? Although the former would have
been immediately preferred (although cheerleading squads were scarce in
our town), the latter was closer to the truth. It would be more
romantic, I suppose, to suggest that we would have all jumped at the
chance for something more productive, bored out of our skulls as we
were. But it’s not true. We were all too prematurely cynical and
world-weary and leery of responsibility to stick to the debating clubs
and Air Cadets and school sports that the adults around us tried to
organize. Doing anything wasn’t cool. I don’t know what teenage life was
like before the revolutionaries of the late sixties advised everyone
young to tune in, turn on and drop out. Was it OK for a teenager to
belong wholeheartedly to a club in 1955? Because it certainly wasn’t
twenty years later. Plenty of us turned on and dropped out. But not so
many tuned in.</p>
<p>I wanted to be elsewhere. I wasn’t the only one. Everyone who
eventually left the Fairview I grew up in knew they were leaving by the
age of twelve. I knew. My wife, who grew up with me on the street our
families shared, knew. The friends I had who did and didn’t leave also
knew, regardless of which track they were on. There was an unspoken
expectation in the families of those who were college-bound that such a
thing was a matter of course. For those from less-educated families, a
future that included university was simply not part of the conceptual
realm. It wasn’t for lack of money, either. Tuition for advanced
education was very low at that time, and jobs in Alberta were plentiful
and high-paying. I earned more money in 1980 working at a plywood mill
than I would again doing anything else for twenty years. No one missed
out on university because of financial need in oil-rich Alberta in the
1970s.</p>
<p>Some Different Friends—and Some More of the Same</p>
<p>In high school, after my first group of cronies had all dropped out,
I made friends with a couple of newcomers. They came to Fairview as
boarders. There was no school after ninth grade in their even more
remote and aptly named hometown, Bear Canyon. They were an ambitious
duo, comparatively speaking; straightforward and reliable, but also cool
and very amusing. When I left town to attend Grande Prairie Regional
College, ninety miles away, one of them became my roommate. The other
went off elsewhere to pursue further education. Both were aiming upward.
Their decisions to do so bolstered mine.</p>
<p>I was a happy clam when I arrived at college. I found another,
expanded group of like-minded companions, whom my Bear Canyon comrade
also joined. We were all captivated by literature and philosophy. We ran
the Student Union. We made it profitable, for the first time in its
history, hosting college dances. How can you lose money selling beer to
college kids? We started a newspaper. We got to know our professors of
political science and biology and English literature in the tiny
seminars that characterized even our first year. The instructors were
thankful for our enthusiasm and taught us well. We were building a
better life.</p>
<p>I sloughed off a lot of my past. In a small town, everyone knows who
you are. You drag your years behind you like a running dog with tin cans
tied to its tail. You can’t escape who you have been. Everything wasn’t
online then, and thank God for that, but it was stored equally indelibly
in everyone’s spoken and unspoken expectations and memory.</p>
<p>When you move, everything is up in the air, at least for a while.
It’s stressful, but in the chaos there are new possibilities. People,
including you, can’t hem you in with their old notions. You get shaken
out of your ruts. You can make new, better ruts, with people aiming at
better things. I thought this was just a natural development. I thought
that every person who moved would have—and want—the same phoenix-like
experience. But that wasn’t always the case.</p>
<p>One time, when I was about fifteen, I went with Chris and another
friend, Carl, to Edmonton, a city of six hundred thousand. Carl had
never been to a city. This was not uncommon. Fairview to Edmonton was an
eight-hundred-mile round trip. I had done it many times, sometimes with
my parents, sometimes without. I liked the anonymity that the city
provided. I liked the new beginnings. I liked the escape from the
dismal, cramped adolescent culture of my home town. So, I convinced my
two friends to make the journey. But they did not have the same
experience. As soon as we arrived, Chris and Carl wanted to buy some
pot. We headed for the parts of Edmonton that were exactly like the
worst of Fairview. We found the same furtive street-vending marijuana
providers. We spent the weekend drinking in the hotel room. Although we
had travelled a long distance, we had gone nowhere at all.</p>
<p>I saw an even more egregious example of this a few years later. I had
moved to Edmonton to finish my undergraduate degree. I took an apartment
with my sister, who was studying to be a nurse. She was also an
up-and-out-of-there person. (Not too many years later she would plant
strawberries in Norway and run safaris through Africa and smuggle trucks
across the Tuareg-menaced Sahara Desert, and babysit orphan gorillas in
the Congo.) We had a nice place in a new high-rise, overlooking the
broad valley of the North Saskatchewan River. We had a view of the city
skyline in the background. I bought a beautiful new Yamaha upright
piano, in a fit of enthusiasm. The place looked good.</p>
<p>I heard through the grapevine that Ed—Chris’s younger cousin—had
moved to the city. I thought that was a good thing. One day he called. I
invited him over. I wanted to see how he was faring. I hoped he was
achieving some of the potential I once saw in him. That is not what
happened. Ed showed up, older, balder and stooped. He was a lot more
not-doing-so-well young adult and a lot less youthful possibility. His
eyes were the telltale red slits of the practised stoner. Ed had had
taken some job—lawn-mowing and casual landscaping—which would have been
fine for a part-time university student or for someone who could not do
better but which was wretchedly low-end as a career for an intelligent
person.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by a friend.</p>
<p>It was his friend I really remember. He was spaced. He was baked. He
was stoned out of his gourd. His head and our nice, civilized apartment
did not easily occupy the same universe. My sister was there. She knew
Ed. She’d seen this sort of thing before. But I still wasn’t happy that
Ed had brought this character into our place. Ed sat down. His friend
sat down, too, although it wasn’t clear he noticed. It was tragicomedy.
Stoned as he was, Ed still had the sense to be embarrassed. We sipped
our beer. Ed’s friend looked upwards. “My particles are scattered all
over the ceiling,” he managed. Truer words were never spoken.</p>
<p>I took Ed aside and told him politely that he had to leave. I said
that he shouldn’t have brought his useless bastard of a companion. He
nodded. He understood. That made it even worse. His older cousin Chris
wrote me a letter much later about such things. I included it in my
first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, published in
1999: “I had friends,” he said.62 “Before. Anyone with enough
self-contempt that they could forgive me mine.”</p>
<p>What was it that made Chris and Carl and Ed unable (or, worse,
perhaps, unwilling) to move or to change their friendships and improve
the circumstances of their lives? Was it inevitable—a consequence of
their own limitations, nascent illnesses and traumas of the past? After
all, people vary significantly, in ways that seem both structural and
deterministic. People differ in intelligence, which is in large part the
ability to learn and transform. People have very different
personalities, as well. Some are active, and some passive. Others are
anxious or calm. For every individual driven to achieve, there is
another who is indolent. The degree to which these differences are
immutably part and parcel of someone is greater than an optimist might
presume or desire. And then there is illness, mental and physical,
diagnosed or invisible, further limiting or shaping our lives.</p>
<p>Chris had a psychotic break in his thirties, after flirting with
insanity for many years. Not long afterward, he committed suicide. Did
his heavy marijuana use play a magnifying role, or was it understandable
self-medication? Use of physician-prescribed drugs for pain has, after
all, decreased in marijuana-legal states such as Colorado.63 Maybe the
pot made things better for Chris, not worse. Maybe it eased his
suffering, instead of exacerbating his instability. Was it the
nihilistic philosophy he nurtured that paved the way to his eventual
breakdown? Was that nihilism, in turn, a consequence of genuine ill
health, or just an intellectual rationalization of his unwillingness to
dive responsibly into life? Why did he—like his cousin, like my other
friends—continually choose people who, and places that, were not good
for him?</p>
<p>Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth—or,
perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a
new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the
past. Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they
don’t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don’t want the trouble of
better. Freud called this a “repetition compulsion.” He thought of it as
an unconscious drive to repeat the horrors of the past—sometimes,
perhaps, to formulate those horrors more precisely, sometimes to attempt
more active mastery and sometimes, perhaps, because no alternatives
beckon. People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at
hand. Faulty tools produce faulty results. Repeated use of the same
faulty tools produces the same faulty results. It is in this manner that
those who fail to learn from the past doom themselves to repeat it. It’s
partly fate. It’s partly inability. It’s partly … unwillingness to
learn? Refusal to learn? Motivated refusal to learn?</p>
<p>Rescuing the Damned</p>
<p>People choose friends who aren’t good for them for other reasons,
too. Sometimes it’s because they want to rescue someone. This is more
typical of young people, although the impetus still exists among older
folks who are too agreeable or have remained naive or who are willfully
blind. Someone might object, “It is only right to see the best in
people. The highest virtue is the desire to help.” But not everyone who
is failing is a victim, and not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise,
although many do, and many manage it. Nonetheless, people will often
accept or even amplify their own suffering, as well as that of others,
if they can brandish it as evidence of the world’s injustice. There is
no shortage of oppressors among the downtrodden, even if, given their
lowly positions, many of them are only tyrannical wannabes. It’s the
easiest path to choose, moment to moment, although it’s nothing but hell
in the long run.</p>
<p>Imagine someone not doing well. He needs help. He might even want it.
But it is not easy to distinguish between someone truly wanting and
needing help and someone who is merely exploiting a willing helper. The
distinction is difficult even for the person who is wanting and needing
and possibly exploiting. The person who tries and fails, and is
forgiven, and then tries again and fails, and is forgiven, is also too
often the person who wants everyone to believe in the authenticity of
all that trying.</p>
<p>When it’s not just naïveté, the attempt to rescue someone is often
fuelled by vanity and narcissism. Something like this is detailed in the
incomparable Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky’s bitter classic, Notes
from Underground, which begins with these famous lines: “I am a sick man
… I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is
diseased.” It is the confession of a miserable, arrogant sojourner in
the underworld of chaos and despair. He analyzes himself mercilessly,
but only pays in this manner for a hundred sins, despite committing a
thousand. Then, imagining himself redeemed, the underground man commits
the worst transgression of the lot. He offers aid to a genuinely
unfortunate person, Liza, a woman on the desperate nineteenth-century
road to prostitution. He invites her for a visit, promising to set her
life back on the proper course. While waiting for her to appear, his
fantasies spin increasingly messianic:</p>
<p>One day passed, however, another and another; she did not come and I
began to grow calmer. I felt particularly bold and cheerful after nine
o’clock, I even sometimes began dreaming, and rather sweetly: I, for
instance, became the salvation of Liza, simply through her coming to me
and my talking to her.… I develop her, educate her. Finally, I notice
that she loves me, loves me passionately. I pretend not to understand (I
don’t know, however, why I pretend, just for effect, perhaps). At last
all confusion, transfigured, trembling and sobbing, she flings herself
at my feet and says that I am her savior, and that she loves me better
than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Nothing but the narcissism of the underground man is nourished by
such fantasies. Liza herself is demolished by them. The salvation he
offers to her demands far more in the way of commitment and maturity
than the underground man is willing or able to offer. He simply does not
have the character to see it through—something he quickly realizes, and
equally quickly rationalizes. Liza eventually arrives at his shabby
apartment, hoping desperately for a way out, staking everything she has
on the visit. She tells the underground man that she wants to leave her
current life. His response?</p>
<p>“Why have you come to me, tell me that, please?” I began, gasping for
breath and regardless of logical connection in my words. I longed to
have it all out at once, at one burst; I did not even trouble how to
begin. “Why have you come? Answer, answer,” I cried, hardly knowing what
I was doing. “I’ll tell you, my good girl, why you have come. You’ve
come because I talked sentimental stuff to you then. So now you are soft
as butter and longing for fine sentiments again. So you may as well know
that I was laughing at you then. And I am laughing at you now. Why are
you shuddering? Yes, I was laughing at you! I had been insulted just
before, at dinner, by the fellows who came that evening before me. I
came to you, meaning to thrash one of them, an officer; but I didn’t
succeed, I didn’t find him; I had to avenge the insult on someone to get
back my own again; you turned up, I vented my spleen on you and laughed
at you. I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had been
treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power.… That’s what it was,
and you imagined I had come there on purpose to save you. Yes? You
imagined that? You imagined that?”</p>
<p>I knew that she would perhaps be muddled and not take it all in
exactly, but I knew, too, that she would grasp the gist of it, very well
indeed. And so, indeed, she did. She turned white as a handkerchief,
tried to say something, and her lips worked painfully; but she sank on a
chair as though she had been felled by an axe. And all the time
afterwards she listened to me with her lips parted and her eyes wide
open, shuddering with awful terror. The cynicism, the cynicism of my
words overwhelmed her.…</p>
<p>The inflated self-importance, carelessness and sheer malevolence of
the underground man dashes Liza’s last hopes. He understands this well.
Worse: something in him was aiming at this all along. And he knows that
too. But a villain who despairs of his villainy has not become a hero. A
hero is something positive, not just the absence of evil.</p>
<p>But Christ himself, you might object, befriended tax-collectors and
prostitutes. How dare I cast aspersions on the motives of those who are
trying to help? But Christ was the archetypal perfect man. And you’re
you. How do you know that your attempts to pull someone up won’t instead
bring them—or you—further down? Imagine the case of someone supervising
an exceptional team of workers, all of them striving towards a
collectively held goal; imagine them hard-working, brilliant, creative
and unified. But the person supervising is also responsible for someone
troubled, who is performing poorly, elsewhere. In a fit of inspiration,
the well-meaning manager moves that problematic person into the midst of
his stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens?—and
the psychological literature is clear on this point.64 Does the errant
interloper immediately straighten up and fly right? No. Instead, the
entire team degenerates. The newcomer remains cynical, arrogant and
neurotic. He complains. He shirks. He misses important meetings. His
low-quality work causes delays, and must be redone by others. He still
gets paid, however, just like his teammates. The hard workers who
surround him start to feel betrayed. “Why am I breaking myself into
pieces striving to finish this project,” each thinks, “when my new team
member never breaks a sweat?” The same thing happens when well-meaning
counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers.
The delinquency spreads, not the stability.65 Down is a lot easier than
up.</p>
<p>Maybe you are saving someone because you’re a strong, generous,
well-put-together person who wants to do the right thing. But it’s also
possible—and, perhaps, more likely—that you just want to draw attention
to your inexhaustible reserves of compassion and good-will. Or maybe
you’re saving someone because you want to convince yourself that the
strength of your character is more than just a side effect of your luck
and birthplace. Or maybe it’s because it’s easier to look virtuous when
standing alongside someone utterly irresponsible.</p>
<p>Assume first that you are doing the easiest thing, and not the most
difficult.</p>
<p>Your raging alcoholism makes my binge drinking appear trivial. My
long serious talks with you about your badly failing marriage convince
both of us that you are doing everything possible and that I am helping
you to my utmost. It looks like effort. It looks like progress. But real
improvement would require far more from both of you. Are you so sure the
person crying out to be saved has not decided a thousand times to accept
his lot of pointless and worsening suffering, simply because it is
easier than shouldering any true responsibility? Are you enabling a
delusion? Is it possible that your contempt would be more salutary than
your pity?</p>
<p>Or maybe you have no plan, genuine or otherwise, to rescue anybody.
You’re associating with people who are bad for you not because it’s
better for anyone, but because it’s easier. You know it. Your friends
know it. You’re all bound by an implicit contract—one aimed at nihilism,
and failure, and suffering of the stupidest sort. You’ve all decided to
sacrifice the future to the present. You don’t talk about it. You don’t
all get together and say, “Let’s take the easier path. Let’s indulge in
whatever the moment might bring. And let’s agree, further, not to call
each other on it. That way, we can more easily forget what we are
doing.” You don’t mention any of that. But you all know what’s really
going on.</p>
<p>Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in
trouble. You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of
unjust circumstances and exploitation. It’s the most unlikely
explanation, not the most probable. In my experience—clinical and
otherwise—it’s just never been that simple. Besides, if you buy the
story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no
personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person
all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future,
as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.</p>
<p>It is far more likely that a given individual has just decided to
reject the path upward, because of its difficulty. Perhaps that should
even be your default assumption, when faced with such a situation.
That’s too harsh, you think. You might be right. Maybe that’s a step too
far. But consider this: failure is easy to understand. No explanation
for its existence is required. In the same manner, fear, hatred,
addiction, promiscuity, betrayal and deception require no explanation.
It’s not the existence of vice, or the indulgence in it, that requires
explanation. Vice is easy. Failure is easy, too. It’s easier not to
shoulder a burden. It’s easier not to think, and not to do, and not to
care. It’s easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today,
and drown the upcoming months and years in today’s cheap pleasures. As
the infamous father of the Simpson clan puts it, immediately prior to
downing a jar of mayonnaise and vodka, “That’s a problem for Future
Homer. Man, I don’t envy that guy!”66</p>
<p>How do I know that your suffering is not the demand of martyrdom for
my resources, so that you can oh-so-momentarily stave off the
inevitable? Maybe you have even moved beyond caring about the impending
collapse, but don’t yet want to admit it. Maybe my help won’t rectify
anything—can’t rectify anything—but it does keep that too-terrible,
too-personal realization temporarily at bay. Maybe your misery is a
demand placed on me so that I fail too, so that the gap you so painfully
feel between us can be reduced, while you degenerate and sink. How do I
know that you would refuse to play such a game? How do I know that I am
not myself merely pretending to be responsible, while pointlessly
“helping” you, so that I don’t have to do something truly difficult—and
genuinely possible?</p>
<p>Maybe your misery is the weapon you brandish in your hatred for those
who rose upward while you waited and sank. Maybe your misery is your
attempt to prove the world’s injustice, instead of the evidence of your
own sin, your own missing of the mark, your conscious refusal to strive
and to live. Maybe your willingness to suffer in failure is
inexhaustible, given what you use that suffering to prove. Maybe it’s
your revenge on Being. How exactly should I befriend you when you’re in
such a place? How exactly could I?</p>
<p>Success: that’s the mystery. Virtue: that’s what’s inexplicable. To
fail, you merely have to cultivate a few bad habits. You just have to
bide your time. And once someone has spent enough time cultivating bad
habits and biding their time, they are much diminished. Much of what
they could have been has dissipated, and much of the less that they have
become is now real. Things fall apart, of their own accord, but the sins
of men speed their degeneration. And then comes the flood.</p>
<p>I am not saying that there is no hope of redemption. But it is much
harder to extract someone from a chasm than to lift him from a ditch.
And some chasms are very deep. And there’s not much left of the body at
the bottom.</p>
<p>Maybe I should at least wait, to help you, until it’s clear that you
want to be helped. Carl Rogers, the famous humanistic psychologist,
believed it was impossible to start a therapeutic relationship if the
person seeking help did not want to improve.67 Rogers believed it was
impossible to convince someone to change for the better. The desire to
improve was, instead, the precondition for progress. I’ve had
court-mandated psychotherapy clients. They did not want my help. They
were forced to seek it. It did not work. It was a travesty.</p>
<p>If I stay in an unhealthy relationship with you, perhaps it’s because
I’m too weak-willed and indecisive to leave, but I don’t want to know
it. Thus, I continue helping you, and console myself with my pointless
martyrdom. Maybe I can then conclude, about myself, “Someone that
self-sacrificing, that willing to help someone—that has to be a good
person.” Not so. It might be just a person trying to look good
pretending to solve what appears to be a difficult problem instead of
actually being good and addressing something real.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of continuing our friendship I should just go off
somewhere, get my act together, and lead by example.</p>
<p>And none of this is a justification for abandoning those in real need
to pursue your narrow, blind ambition, in case it has to be said.</p>
<p>A Reciprocal Arrangement</p>
<p>Here’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship
you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why
would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of
loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be
negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement.
You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a
worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want
things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing,
to choose people who are good for you. It’s appropriate and praiseworthy
to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your
life improve.</p>
<p>If you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim,
they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will
instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and
punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your
resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful
manner. People who are not aiming up will do the opposite. They will
offer a former smoker a cigarette and a former alcoholic a beer. They
will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine. They
will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it.
They will over-ride your accomplishment with a past action, real or
imaginary, of their own. Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if
your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are
dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an
even dimmer light.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that every good example is a fateful challenge,
and every hero, a judge. Michelangelo’s great perfect marble David cries
out to its observer: “You could be more than you are.” When you dare
aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise
of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls,
where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are
unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain. You remind them that they
ceased caring not because of life’s horrors, which are undeniable, but
because they do not want to lift the world up on to their shoulders,
where it belongs.</p>
<p>Don’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy
people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not. A good, healthy person
is an ideal. It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a
person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and
protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.</p>
<p>Make friends with people who want the best for you.</p>
