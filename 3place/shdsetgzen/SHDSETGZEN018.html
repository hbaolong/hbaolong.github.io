<h4 id="foreword">FOREWORD</h4>
<p>fn1 Some argue—mistakenly—that Freud (often mentioned in these pages)
contributed to our current longing for a culture, schools and
institutions that are “non-judgmental.” It is true that he recommended
that when psychoanalysts listen to their patients in therapy, they be
tolerant, empathic, and not voice critical, moralistic judgments. But
this was for the express purposes of helping patients feel comfortable
in being totally honest, and not diminish their problems. This
encouraged self-reflection, and allowed them to explore warded off
feelings, wishes, even shameful anti-social urges. It also—and this was
the masterstroke—allowed them to discover their own unconscious
conscience (and its judgments), and their own harsh self-criticism of
their “lapses,” and their own unconscious guilt which they had often
hidden from themselves, but which often formed the basis of their low
self-esteem, depression and anxiety. If anything, Freud showed that we
are both more immoral and more moral than we are aware of. This kind of
“non-judgmentalism,” in therapy, is a powerful and liberating technique
or tactic—an ideal attitude when you want to better understand yourself.
But Freud never argued (as do some who want all culture to become one
huge group therapy session) that one can live one’s entire life without
ever making judgments, or without morality. In fact, his point in
Civilization and its Discontents is that civilization only arises when
some restraining rules and morality are in place.</p>
<p>OVERTURE</p>
<p>fn1 The yin/yang symbol is the second part of the more comprehensive
five-part tajitu, a diagram representing both the original absolute
unity and its division into the multiplicity of the observed world. This
is discussed in more detail in Rule 2, below, as well as elsewhere in
the book.</p>
<p>fn2 I use the term Being (with a capital “B”) in part because of my
exposure to the ideas of the 20th-century German philosopher Martin
Heidegger. Heidegger tried to distinguish between reality, as conceived
objectively, and the totality of human experience (which is his
“Being”). Being (with a capital “B”) is what each of us experiences,
subjectively, personally and individually, as well as what we each
experience jointly with others. As such, it includes emotions, drives,
dreams, visions and revelations, as well as our private thoughts and
perceptions. Being is also, finally, something that is brought into
existence by action, so its nature is to an indeterminate degree a
consequence of our decisions and choices—something shaped by our
hypothetically free will. Construed in this manner, Being is (1) not
something easily and directly reducible to the material and objective
and (2) something that most definitely requires its own term, as
Heidegger labored for decades to indicate.</p>
<p>RULE 2: TREAT YOURSELF LIKE SOMEONE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
HELPING</p>
<p>fn1 It is of great interest, in this regard, that the five-part
taijitu (referred to in Chapter 1 and the source of the simpler yin/yang
symbol) expresses the origin of the cosmos as, first, originating in the
undifferentiated absolute, then dividing into yin and yang (chaos/order,
feminine/masculine), and then into the five agents (wood, fire, earth,
metal, water) and then, simply put, “the ten thousand things.” The Star
of David (chaos/order, feminine/masculine) gives rise in the same way to
the four basic elements: fire, air, water and earth (out of which
everything else is built). A similar hexagram is used by the Hindus. The
downward triangle symbolizes Shakti, the feminine; the upward triangle,
Shiva, the masculine. The two components are known as om and hrim in
Sanskrit. Remarkable examples of conceptual parallelism.</p>
<p>fn2 Or, in another interpretation, He split the original androgynous
individual into two parts, male and female. According to this line of
thinking, Christ, the “second Adam,” is also the original Man, before
the sexual subdivision. The symbolic meaning of this should be clear to
those who have followed the argument thus far.</p>
<p>RULE 5: DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN DO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU DISLIKE
THEM</p>
<p>fn1 I draw here and will many times again in the course of this book
on my clinical experience (as I have, already, on my personal history).
I have tried to keep the moral of the stories intact, while disguising
the details for the sake of the privacy of those involved. I hope I got
the balance right.</p>
<p>RULE 7: PURSUE WHAT IS MEANINGFUL (NOT WHAT IS EXPEDIENT)</p>
<p>fn1 And this is all true, note, whether there is—or is not—actually
such a powerful figure, “in the sky” :)</p>
<p>fn2 In keeping with this observation is the fact that the word Set is
an etymological precursor to the word Satan. See Murdock, D.M. (2009).
Christ in Egypt: the Horus-Jesus connection. Seattle, WA: Stellar House,
p. 75.</p>
<p>fn3 For anyone who thinks this is somehow unrealistic, given the
concrete material reality and genuine suffering that is associated with
privation, I would once again recommend Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag
Archipelago, which contains a series of exceptionally profound
discussions about proper ethical behavior and its exaggerated rather
than diminished importance in situations of extreme want and
suffering.</p>
<p>RULE 9: ASSUME THAT THE PERSON YOU ARE LISTENING TO MIGHT KNOW
SOMETHING YOU DON’T</p>
<p>fn1 Here, again, I have disguised many of the details of this case,
to maintain the privacy of those involved, while attempting to maintain
the central meaning of the events.</p>
<p>fn2 The strategy of speaking to individuals is not only vital to the
delivery of any message, it’s a useful antidote to fear of public
speaking. No one wants to be stared at by hundreds of unfriendly,
judgmental eyes. However, almost everybody can talk to just one
attentive person. So, if you have to deliver a speech (another terrible
phrase) then do that. Talk to the individuals in the audience—and don’t
hide: not behind the podium, not with downcast eyes, not by speaking too
quietly or mumbling, not by apologizing for your lack of brilliance or
preparedness, not behind ideas that are not yours, and not behind
clichés.</p>
<p>RULE 10: BE PRECISE IN YOUR SPEECH</p>
<p>fn1 This is why, for example, it has taken us far longer than we
originally assumed to make robots that could function autonomously in
the world. The problem of perception is far more difficult than our
immediate effortless access to our own perceptions predisposes us to
infer. In fact, the problem of perception is so difficult that it
stalled the early progress of artificial intelligence almost fatally
(from the perspective of that time), as we discovered that disembodied
abstract reason could not solve even simple real-world problems.
Pioneers such as Rodney Brooks proposed in the late 1980s and early ’90s
that bodies in action were necessary preconditions to the parsing of the
world into manageable things, and the AI revolution regained its
confidence and momentum.</p>
<p>fn2 The recording is available at Peterson, J.B. (2002). Slaying the
Dragon Within Us. Lecture, originally broadcast by TVO: available at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjUkEj1O_0</p>
<p>RULE 11: DO NOT BOTHER CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE SKATEBOARDING</p>
<p>fn1 Names and other details have been changed for the sake of
privacy.</p>
<p>fn2 37-28/28 = 9/28 = 32 percent.</p>
<p>fn3 35-29/35 = 6/35 = 17 percent.</p>
