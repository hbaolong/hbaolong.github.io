<h4 id="rule-6">RULE 6</h4>
<p>SET YOUR HOUSE IN PERFECT ORDER BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE THE WORLD</p>
<p>A RELIGIOUS PROBLEM</p>
<p>It does not seem reasonable to describe the young man who shot twenty
children and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 as a religious person. This is equally
true for the Colorado theatre gunman and the Columbine High School
killers. But these murderous individuals had a problem with reality that
existed at a religious depth. As one of the members of the Columbine duo
wrote:108</p>
<p>The human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the
Earth back to the animals. They deserve it infinitely more than we do.
Nothing means anything anymore.</p>
<p>People who think such things view Being itself as inequitable and
harsh to the point of corruption, and human Being, in particular, as
contemptible. They appoint themselves supreme adjudicators of reality
and find it wanting. They are the ultimate critics. The deeply cynical
writer continues:</p>
<p>If you recall your history, the Nazis came up with a “final solution”
to the Jewish problem.… Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured
it out, I say “KILL MANKIND.” No one should survive.</p>
<p>For such individuals, the world of experience is insufficient and
evil—so to hell with everything!</p>
<p>What is happening when someone comes to think in this manner? A great
German play, Faust: A Tragedy, written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
addresses that issue. The play’s main character, a scholar named
Heinrich Faust, trades his immortal soul to the devil, Mephistopheles.
In return, he receives whatever he desires while still alive on Earth.
In Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary of Being. He
has a central, defining credo:109</p>
<p>I am the spirit who negates</p>
<p>and rightly so, for all that comes to be</p>
<p>deserves to perish, wretchedly.</p>
<p>It were better nothing would begin!</p>
<p>Thus everything that your terms sin,</p>
<p>destruction, evil represent—</p>
<p>hat is my proper element.</p>
<p>Goethe considered this hateful sentiment so important—so key to the
central element of vengeful human destructiveness—that he had
Mephistopheles say it a second time, phrased somewhat differently, in
Part II of the play, written many years later.110</p>
<p>People think often in the Mephistophelean manner, although they
seldom act upon their thoughts as brutally as the mass murderers of
school, college and theatre. Whenever we experience injustice, real or
imagined; whenever we encounter tragedy or fall prey to the machinations
of others; whenever we experience the horror and pain of our own
apparently arbitrary limitations—the temptation to question Being and
then to curse it rises foully from the darkness. Why must innocent
people suffer so terribly? What kind of bloody, horrible planet is this,
anyway?</p>
<p>Life is in truth very hard. Everyone is destined for pain and slated
for destruction. Sometimes suffering is clearly the result of a personal
fault such as willful blindness, poor decision-making or malevolence. In
such cases, when it appears to be self-inflicted, it may even seem just.
People get what they deserve, you might contend. That’s cold comfort,
however, even when true. Sometimes, if those who are suffering changed
their behaviour, then their lives would unfold less tragically. But
human control is limited. Susceptibility to despair, disease, aging and
death is universal. In the final analysis, we do not appear to be the
architects of our own fragility. Whose fault is it, then?</p>
<p>People who are very ill (or, worse, who have a sick child) will
inevitably find themselves asking this question, whether they are
religious believers or not. The same is true of someone who finds his
shirtsleeve caught in the gears of a giant bureaucracy—who is suffering
through a tax audit, or fighting an interminable lawsuit or divorce. And
it’s not only the obviously suffering who are tormented by the need to
blame someone or something for the intolerable state of their Being. At
the height of his fame, influence and creative power, for example, the
towering Leo Tolstoy himself began to question the value of human
existence.111 He reasoned in this way:</p>
<p>My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way
of rational knowledge except a denial of life; and in faith I could find
nothing except a denial of reason, and this was even more impossible
than a denial of life. According to rational knowledge, it followed that
life is evil, and people know it. They do not have to live, yet they
have lived and they do live, just as I myself had lived, even though I
had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil.</p>
<p>Try as he might, Tolstoy could identify only four means of escaping
from such thoughts. One was retreating into childlike ignorance of the
problem. Another was pursuing mindless pleasure. The third was
“continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless, knowing
beforehand that nothing can come of it.” He identified that particular
form of escape with weakness: “The people in this category know that
death is better than life, but they do not have the strength to act
rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing
themselves.…”</p>
<p>Only the fourth and final mode of escape involved “strength and
energy. It consists of destroying life, once one has realized that life
is evil and meaningless.” Tolstoy relentlessly followed his
thoughts:</p>
<p>Only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this
manner. Having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being
played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than
those of the living and that it is better not to exist, they act and put
an end to this stupid joke; and they use any means of doing it: a rope
around the neck, water, a knife in the heart, a train.</p>
<p>Tolstoy wasn’t pessimistic enough. The stupidity of the joke being
played on us does not merely motivate suicide. It motivates murder—mass
murder, often followed by suicide. That is a far more effective
existential protest. By June of 2016, unbelievable as it may seem, there
had been one thousand mass killings (defined as four or more people shot
in a single incident, excluding the shooter) in the US in twelve hundred
and sixty days.112 That’s one such event on five of every six days for
more than three years. Everyone says, “We don’t understand.” How can we
still pretend that? Tolstoy understood, more than a century ago. The
ancient authors of the biblical story of Cain and Abel understood, as
well, more than twenty centuries ago. They described murder as the first
act of post-Edenic history: and not just murder, but fratricidal
murder—murder not only of someone innocent but of someone ideal and
good, and murder done consciously to spite the creator of the universe.
Today’s killers tell us the same thing, in their own words. Who would
dare say that this is not the worm at the core of the apple? But we will
not listen, because the truth cuts too close to the bone. Even for a
mind as profound as that of the celebrated Russian author, there was no
way out. How can the rest of us manage, when a man of Tolstoy’s stature
admits defeat? For years, he hid his guns from himself and would not
walk with a rope in hand, in case he hanged himself.</p>
<p>How can a person who is awake avoid outrage at the world?</p>
<p>Vengeance or Transformation</p>
<p>A religious man might shake his fist in desperation at the apparent
injustice and blindness of God. Even Christ Himself felt abandoned
before the cross, or so the story goes. A more agnostic or atheistic
individual might blame fate, or meditate bitterly on the brutality of
chance. Another might tear himself apart, searching for the character
flaws underlying his suffering and deterioration. These are all
variations on a theme. The name of the target changes, but the
underlying psychology remains constant. Why? Why is there so much
suffering and cruelty?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps it really is God’s doing—or the fault of blind,
pointless fate, if you are inclined to think that way. And there appears
to be every reason to think that way. But, what happens if you do? Mass
murderers believe that the suffering attendant upon existence justifies
judgment and revenge, as the Columbine boys so clearly indicated:113</p>
<p>I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. Before I leave this
worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything,
especially life. If you pissed me off in the past, you will die if I see
you. You might be able to piss off others, and have it eventually all
blow over, but not me. I don’t forget people who wronged me.</p>
<p>One of the most vengeful murderers of the twentieth century, the
terrible Carl Panzram, was raped, brutalized and betrayed in the
Minnesota institution responsible for his “rehabilitation” when he was a
delinquent juvenile. He emerged, enraged beyond measure, as burglar,
arsonist, rapist and serial killer. He aimed consciously and
consistently at destruction, even keeping track of the dollar value of
the property he burned. He started by hating the individuals who had
hurt him. His resentment grew, until his hatred encompassed all of
mankind, and he didn’t stop there. His destructiveness was aimed in some
fundamental manner at God Himself. There is no other way of phrasing it.
Panzram raped, murdered and burned to express his outrage at Being. He
acted as if Someone was responsible. The same thing happens in the story
of Cain and Abel. Cain’s sacrifices are rejected. He exists in
suffering. He calls out God and challenges the Being He created. God
refuses his plea. He tells Cain that his trouble is self-induced. Cain,
in his rage, kills Abel, God’s favourite (and, truth be known, Cain’s
idol). Cain is jealous, of course, of his successful brother. But he
destroys Abel primarily to spite God. This is the truest version of what
happens when people take their vengeance to the ultimate extreme.</p>
<p>Panzram’s response was (and this is what was so terrible) perfectly
understandable. The details of his autobiography reveal that he was one
of Tolstoy’s strong and logically consistent people. He was a powerful,
consistent, fearless actor. He had the courage of his convictions. How
could someone like him be expected to forgive and forget, given what had
happened to him? Truly terrible things happen to people. It’s no wonder
they’re out for revenge. Under such conditions, vengeance seems a moral
necessity. How can it be distinguished from the demand for justice?
After the experience of terrible atrocity, isn’t forgiveness just
cowardice, or lack of willpower? Such questions torment me. But people
emerge from terrible pasts to do good, and not evil, although such an
accomplishment can seem superhuman.</p>
<p>I have met people who managed to do it. I know a man, a great artist,
who emerged from just such a “school” as the one described by
Panzram—only this man was thrown into it as an innocent five-year-old,
fresh from a long stretch in a hospital, where he had suffered measles,
mumps and chicken pox, simultaneously. Incapable of speaking the
language of the school, deliberately isolated from his family, abused,
starved and otherwise tormented, he emerged an angry, broken young man.
He hurt himself badly in the aftermath with drugs and alcohol and other
forms of self-destructive behaviour. He detested everyone—God, himself
and blind fate included. But he put an end to all of that. He stopped
drinking. He stopped hating (although it still emerges in flashes). He
revitalized the artistic culture of his Native tradition, and trained
young men to continue in his footsteps. He produced a fifty-foot totem
pole memorializing the events of his life, and a canoe, forty feet long,
from a single log, of a kind rarely if ever produced now. He brought his
family together, and held a great potlatch, with sixteen hours of
dancing and hundreds of people in attendance, to express his grief, and
make peace with the past. He decided to be a good person, and then did
the impossible things required to live that way.</p>
<p>I had a client who did not have good parents. Her mother died when
she was very young. Her grandmother, who raised her, was a harridan,
bitter and over-concerned with appearances. She mistreated her
granddaughter, punishing her for her virtues: creativity, sensitivity,
intelligence—unable to resist acting out her resentment for an
admittedly hard life on her granddaughter. She had a better relationship
with her father, but he was an addict who died, badly, while she cared
for him. My client had a son. She perpetuated none of this with him. He
grew up truthful, and independent, and hard-working, and smart. Instead
of widening the tear in the cultural fabric she inherited, and
transmitting it, she sewed it up. She rejected the sins of her
forefathers. Such things can be done.</p>
<p>Distress, whether psychic, physical, or intellectual, need not at all
produce nihilism (that is, the radical rejection of value, meaning and
desirability). Such distress always permits a variety of
interpretations.</p>
<p>Nietzsche wrote those words.114 What he meant was this: people who
experience evil may certainly desire to perpetuate it, to pay it
forward. But it is also possible to learn good by experiencing evil. A
bullied boy can mimic his tormentors. But he can also learn from his own
abuse that it is wrong to push people around and make their lives
miserable. Someone tormented by her mother can learn from her terrible
experiences how important it is to be a good parent. Many, perhaps even
most, of the adults who abuse children were abused themselves as
children. However, the majority of people who were abused as children do
not abuse their own children. This is a well-established fact, which can
be demonstrated, simply, arithmetically, in this way: if one parent
abused three children, and each of those children had three children,
and so on, then there would be three abusers the first generation, nine
the second, twenty-seven the third, eighty-one the fourth—and so on
exponentially. After twenty generations, more than ten billion would
have suffered childhood abuse: more people than currently inhabit the
planet. But instead, abuse disappears across generations. People
constrain its spread. That’s a testament to the genuine dominance of
good over evil in the human heart.</p>
<p>The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to
other productive thoughts. The American/English poet T. S. Eliot
explained why, in his play, The Cocktail Party. One of his characters is
not having a good time of it. She speaks of her profound unhappiness to
a psychiatrist. She says she hopes that all her suffering is her own
fault. The psychiatrist is taken aback. He asks why. She has thought
long and hard about this, she says, and has come to the following
conclusion: if it’s her fault, she might be able to do something about
it. If it’s God’s fault, however—if reality itself is flawed, hell-bent
on ensuring her misery—then she is doomed. She couldn’t change the
structure of reality itself. But maybe she could change her own
life.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had every reason to question the structure of
existence when he was imprisoned in a Soviet labour camp, in the middle
of the terrible twentieth century. He had served as a soldier on the
ill-prepared Russian front lines in the face of a Nazi invasion. He had
been arrested, beaten and thrown into prison by his own people. Then he
was struck by cancer. He could have become resentful and bitter. His
life had been rendered miserable by both Stalin and Hitler, two of the
worst tyrants in history. He lived in brutal conditions. Vast stretches
of his precious time were stolen from him and squandered. He witnessed
the pointless and degrading suffering and death of his friends and
acquaintances. Then he contracted an extremely serious disease.
Solzhenitsyn had cause to curse God. Job himself barely had it as
hard.</p>
<p>But the great writer, the profound, spirited defender of truth, did
not allow his mind to turn towards vengeance and destruction. He opened
his eyes, instead. During his many trials, Solzhenitsyn encountered
people who comported themselves nobly, under horrific circumstances. He
contemplated their behaviour deeply. Then he asked himself the most
difficult of questions: had he personally contributed to the catastrophe
of his life? If so, how? He remembered his unquestioning support of the
Communist Party in his early years. He reconsidered his whole life. He
had plenty of time in the camps. How had he missed the mark, in the
past? How many times had he acted against his own conscience, engaging
in actions that he knew to be wrong? How many times had he betrayed
himself, and lied? Was there any way that the sins of his past could be
rectified, atoned for, in the muddy hell of a Soviet gulag?</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn pored over the details of his life, with a fine-toothed
comb. He asked himself a second question, and a third. Can I stop making
such mistakes, now? Can I repair the damage done by my past failures,
now? He learned to watch and to listen. He found people he admired; who
were honest, despite everything. He took himself apart, piece by piece,
let what was unnecessary and harmful die, and resurrected himself. Then
he wrote The Gulag Archipelago, a history of the Soviet prison camp
system.115 It’s a forceful, terrible book, written with the overwhelming
moral force of unvarnished truth. Its sheer outrage screamed unbearably
across hundreds of pages. Banned (and for good reason) in the USSR, it
was smuggled to the West in the 1970s, and burst upon the world.
Solzhenitsyn’s writing utterly and finally demolished the intellectual
credibility of communism, as ideology or society. He took an axe to the
trunk of the tree whose bitter fruits had nourished him so poorly—and
whose planting he had witnessed and supported.</p>
<p>One man’s decision to change his life, instead of cursing fate, shook
the whole pathological system of communist tyranny to its core. It
crumbled entirely, not so many years later, and Solzhenitsyn’s courage
was not the least of the reasons why. He was not the only such person to
perform such a miracle. Václav Havel, the persecuted writer who later,
impossibly, became the president of Czechoslovakia, then of the new
Czech Republic, comes to mind, as does Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart</p>
<p>Whole peoples have adamantly refused to judge reality, to criticize
Being, to blame God. It’s interesting to consider the Old Testament
Hebrews in this regard. Their travails followed a consistent pattern.
The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of
Babel are truly ancient. Their origins vanish into the mysteries of
time. It’s not until after the flood story in Genesis that something
like history, as we understand it, truly starts. It starts with Abraham.
Abraham’s descendants become the Hebrew people of the Old Testament,
also known as the Hebrew Bible. They enter a covenant with Yahweh—with
God—and begin their recognizably historical adventures.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of a great man, the Hebrews organize themselves
into a society, and then an empire. As their fortunes rise, success
breeds pride and arrogance. Corruption raises its ugly head. The
increasingly hubristic state becomes obsessed with power, begins to
forget its duty to the widows and orphans, and deviates from its age-old
agreement with God. A prophet arises. He brazenly and publicly reviles
the authoritarian king and faithless country for their failures before
God—an act of blind courage—telling them of the terrible judgment to
come. When his wise words are not completely ignored, they are heeded
too late. God smites his wayward people, dooming them to abject defeat
in battle and generations of subjugation. The Hebrews repent, at length,
blaming their misfortune on their own failure to adhere to God’s word.
They insist to themselves that they could have done better. They rebuild
their state, and the cycle begins again.</p>
<p>This is life. We build structures to live in. We build families, and
states, and countries. We abstract the principles upon which those
structures are founded and formulate systems of belief. At first we
inhabit those structures and beliefs like Adam and Eve in Paradise. But
success makes us complacent. We forget to pay attention. We take what we
have for granted. We turn a blind eye. We fail to notice that things are
changing, or that corruption is taking root. And everything falls apart.
Is that the fault of reality—of God? Or do things fall apart because we
have not paid sufficient attention?</p>
<p>When the hurricane hit New Orleans, and the town sank under the
waves, was that a natural disaster? The Dutch prepare their dikes for
the worst storm in ten thousand years. Had New Orleans followed that
example, no tragedy would have occurred. It’s not that no one knew. The
Flood Control Act of 1965 mandated improvements in the levee system that
held back Lake Pontchartrain. The system was to be completed by 1978.
Forty years later, only 60 percent of the work had been done. Willful
blindness and corruption took the city down.</p>
<p>A hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare, when the
necessity for preparation is well known—that’s sin. That’s failure to
hit the mark. And the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). The ancient
Jews always blamed themselves when things fell apart. They acted as if
God’s goodness—the goodness of reality—was axiomatic, and took
responsibility for their own failure. That’s insanely responsible. But
the alternative is to judge reality as insufficient, to criticize Being
itself, and to sink into resentment and the desire for revenge.</p>
<p>If you are suffering—well, that’s the norm. People are limited and
life is tragic. If your suffering is unbearable, however, and you are
starting to become corrupted, here’s something to think about.</p>
<p>Clean Up Your Life</p>
<p>Consider your circumstances. Start small. Have you taken full
advantage of the opportunities offered to you? Are you working hard on
your career, or even your job, or are you letting bitterness and
resentment hold you back and drag you down? Have you made peace with
your brother? Are you treating your spouse and your children with
dignity and respect? Do you have habits that are destroying your health
and well-being? Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities? Have
you said what you need to say to your friends and family members? Are
there things that you could do, that you know you could do, that would
make things around you better?</p>
<p>Have you cleaned up your life?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, here’s something to try: Start to stop doing
what you know to be wrong. Start stopping today. Don’t waste time
questioning how you know that what you’re doing is wrong, if you are
certain that it is. Inopportune questioning can confuse, without
enlightening, as well as deflecting you from action. You can know that
something is wrong or right without knowing why. Your entire Being can
tell you something that you can neither explain nor articulate. Every
person is too complex to know themselves completely, and we all contain
wisdom that we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>So, simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should
stop. Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner. Stop saying
those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that
make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with
honour.</p>
<p>You can use your own standards of judgment. You can rely on yourself
for guidance. You don’t have to adhere to some external, arbitrary code
of behaviour (although you should not overlook the guidelines of your
culture. Life is short, and you don’t have time to figure everything out
on your own. The wisdom of the past was hard-earned, and your dead
ancestors may have something useful to tell you).</p>
<p>Don’t blame capitalism, the radical left, or the iniquity of your
enemies. Don’t reorganize the state until you have ordered your own
experience. Have some humility. If you cannot bring peace to your
household, how dare you try to rule a city? Let your own soul guide you.
Watch what happens over the days and weeks. When you are at work you
will begin to say what you really think. You will start to tell your
wife, or your husband, or your children, or your parents, what you
really want and need. When you know that you have left something undone,
you will act to correct the omission. Your head will start to clear up,
as you stop filling it with lies. Your experience will improve, as you
stop distorting it with inauthentic actions. You will then begin to
discover new, more subtle things that you are doing wrong. Stop doing
those, too. After some months and years of diligent effort, your life
will become simpler and less complicated. Your judgment will improve.
You will untangle your past. You will become stronger and less bitter.
You will move more confidently into the future. You will stop making
your life unnecessarily difficult. You will then be left with the
inevitable bare tragedies of life, but they will no longer be compounded
with bitterness and deceit.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will discover that your now less-corrupted soul, much
stronger than it might otherwise have been, is now able to bear those
remaining, necessary, minimal, inescapable tragedies. Perhaps you will
even learn to encounter them so that they stay tragic—merely
tragic—instead of degenerating into outright hellishness. Maybe your
anxiety, and hopelessness, and resentment, and anger—however murderous,
initially—will recede. Perhaps your uncorrupted soul will then see its
existence as a genuine good, as something to celebrate, even in the face
of your own vulnerability. Perhaps you will become an ever-more-powerful
force for peace and whatever is good.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will then see that if all people did this, in their own
lives, the world might stop being an evil place. After that, with
continued effort, perhaps it could even stop being a tragic place. Who
knows what existence might be like if we all decided to strive for the
best? Who knows what eternal heavens might be established by our
spirits, purified by truth, aiming skyward, right here on the fallen
Earth?</p>
<p>Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</p>
