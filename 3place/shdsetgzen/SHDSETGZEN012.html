<h4 id="rule-9">RULE 9</h4>
<p>ASSUME THAT THE PERSON YOU ARE LISTENING TO MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING YOU
DON’T</p>
<p>NOT ADVICE</p>
<p>Psychotherapy is not advice. Advice is what you get when the person
you’re talking with about something horrible and complicated wishes you
would just shut up and go away. Advice is what you get when the person
you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own
intelligence. If you weren’t so stupid, after all, you wouldn’t have
your stupid problems.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy is genuine conversation. Genuine conversation is
exploration, articulation and strategizing. When you’re involved in a
genuine conversation, you’re listening, and talking—but mostly
listening. Listening is paying attention. It’s amazing what people will
tell you if you listen. Sometimes if you listen to people they will even
tell you what’s wrong with them. Sometimes they will even tell you how
they plan to fix it. Sometimes that helps you fix something wrong with
yourself. One surprising time (and this is only one occasion of many
when such things happened), I was listening to someone very carefully,
and she told me within minutes (a) that she was a witch and (b) that her
witch coven spent a lot of its time visualizing world peace together.
She was a long-time lower-level functionary in some bureaucratic job. I
would never have guessed that she was a witch. I also didn’t know that
witch covens spent any of their time visualizing world peace. I didn’t
know what to make of any of it, either, but it wasn’t boring, and that’s
something.</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, I talk and I listen. I talk more to some
people, and listen more to others. Many of the people I listen to have
no one else to talk to. Some of them are truly alone in the world. There
are far more people like that than you think. You don’t meet them,
because they are alone. Others are surrounded by tyrants or narcissists
or drunks or traumatized people or professional victims. Some are not
good at articulating themselves. They go off on tangents. They repeat
themselves. They say vague and contradictory things. They’re hard to
listen to. Others have terrible things happening around them. They have
parents with Alzheimer’s or sick children. There’s not much time left
over for their personal concerns.</p>
<p>One time a client who I had been seeing for a few months came into my
officefn1 for her scheduled appointment and, after some brief
preliminaries, she announced “I think I was raped.” It is not easy to
know how to respond to a statement like that, although there is
frequently some mystery around such events. Often alcohol is involved,
as it is in most sexual assault cases. Alcohol can cause ambiguity.
That’s partly why people drink. Alcohol temporarily lifts the terrible
burden of self-consciousness from people. Drunk people know about the
future, but they don’t care about it. That’s exciting. That’s
exhilarating. Drunk people can party like there’s no tomorrow. But,
because there is a tomorrow—most of the time—drunk people also get in
trouble. They black out. They go to dangerous places with careless
people. They have fun. But they also get raped. So, I immediately
thought something like that might be involved. How else to understand “I
think”? But that wasn’t the end of the story. She added an extra detail:
“Five times.” The first sentence was awful enough, but the second
produced something unfathomable. Five times? What could that possibly
mean?</p>
<p>My client told me that she would go to a bar and have a few drinks.
Someone would start to talk with her. She would end up at his place or
her place with him. The evening would proceed, inevitably, to its sexual
climax. The next day she would wake up, uncertain about what
happened—uncertain about her motives, uncertain about his motives, and
uncertain about the world. Miss S, we’ll call her, was vague to the
point of non-existence. She was a ghost of a person. She dressed,
however, like a professional. She knew how to present herself, for first
appearances. In consequence, she had finagled her way onto a government
advisory board considering the construction of a major piece of
transportation infrastructure (even though she knew nothing about
government, advising or construction). She also hosted a local
public-access radio show dedicated to small business, even though she
had never held a real job, and knew nothing about being an entrepreneur.
She had been receiving welfare payments for the entirety of her
adulthood.</p>
<p>Her parents had never provided her with a minute of attention. She
had four brothers and they were not at all good to her. She had no
friends now, and none in the past. She had no partner. She had no one to
talk to, and she didn’t know how to think on her own (that’s not rare).
She had no self. She was, instead, a walking cacophony of unintegrated
experiences. I had tried previously to help her find a job. I asked her
if she had a CV. She said yes. I asked her to bring it to me. She
brought it to our next session. It was fifty pages long. It was in a
file folder box, divided into sections, with manila tag separators—the
ones with the little colorful index-markers on the sides. The sections
included such topics as “My Dreams” and “Books I Have Read.” She had
written down dozens of her night-time dreams in the “My Dreams” section,
and provided brief summaries and reviews of her reading material. This
was what she proposed to send to prospective employers (or perhaps
already had: who really knew?). It is impossible to understand how much
someone has to be no one at all to exist in a world where a file folder
box containing fifty indexed pages listing dreams and novels constitutes
a CV. Miss S knew nothing about herself. She knew nothing about other
individuals. She knew nothing about the world. She was a movie played
out of focus. And she was desperately waiting for a story about herself
to make it all make sense.</p>
<p>If you add some sugar to cold water, and stir it, the sugar will
dissolve. If you heat up that water, you can dissolve more. If you heat
the water to boiling, you can add a lot more sugar and get that to
dissolve too. Then, if you take that boiling sugar water, and slowly
cool it, and don’t bump it or jar it, you can trick it (I don’t know how
else to phrase this) into holding a lot more dissolved sugar than it
would have it if it had remained cold all along. That’s called a
super-saturated solution. If you drop a single crystal of sugar into
that super-saturated solution, all the excess sugar will suddenly and
dramatically crystallize. It’s as if it were crying out for order. That
was my client. People like her are the reason that the many forms of
psychotherapy currently practised all work. People can be so confused
that their psyches will be ordered and their lives improved by the
adoption of any reasonably orderly system of interpretation. This is the
bringing together of the disparate elements of their lives in a
disciplined manner—any disciplined manner. So, if you have come apart at
the seams (or if you never have been together at all) you can
restructure your life on Freudian, Jungian, Adlerian, Rogerian or
behavioural principles. At least then you make sense. At least then
you’re coherent. At least then you might be good for something, if not
good yet for everything. You can’t fix a car with an axe, but you can
cut down a tree. That’s still something.</p>
<p>At about the same time I was seeing this client, the media was all
afire with stories of recovered memories—particularly of sexual assault.
The dispute raged apace: were these genuine accounts of past trauma? Or
were they post-hoc constructs, dreamed up as a consequence of pressure
wittingly or unwittingly applied by incautious therapists, grasped onto
desperately by clinical clients all-too-eager to find a simple cause for
all their trouble? Sometimes, it was the former, perhaps; and sometimes
the latter. I understood much more clearly and precisely, however, how
easy it might be to instill a false memory into the mental landscape as
soon as my client revealed her uncertainty about her sexual experiences.
The past appears fixed, but it’s not—not in an important psychological
sense. There is an awful lot to the past, after all, and the way we
organize it can be subject to drastic revision.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, a movie where nothing but terrible things
happen. But, in the end, everything works out. Everything is resolved. A
sufficiently happy ending can change the meaning of all the previous
events. They can all be viewed as worthwhile, given that ending. Now
imagine another movie. A lot of things are happening. They’re all
exciting and interesting. But there are a lot of them. Ninety minutes
in, you start to worry. “This is a great movie,” you think, “but there
are a lot of things going on. I sure hope the filmmaker can pull it all
together.” But that doesn’t happen. Instead, the story ends, abruptly,
unresolved, or something facile and clichéd occurs. You leave deeply
annoyed and unsatisfied—failing to notice that you were fully engaged
and enjoying the movie almost the whole time you were in the theatre.
The present can change the past, and the future can change the
present.</p>
<p>When you are remembering the past, as well, you remember some parts
of it and forget others. You have clear memories of some things that
happened, but not others, of potentially equal import—just as in the
present you are aware of some aspects of your surroundings and
unconscious of others. You categorize your experience, grouping some
elements together, and separating them from the rest. There is a
mysterious arbitrariness about all of this. You don’t form a
comprehensive, objective record. You can’t. You just don’t know enough.
You just can’t perceive enough. You’re not objective, either. You’re
alive. You’re subjective. You have vested interests—at least in
yourself, at least usually. What exactly should be included in the
story? Where exactly is the border between events?</p>
<p>The sexual abuse of children is distressingly common.156 However,
it’s not as common as poorly trained psychotherapists think, and it also
does not always produce terribly damaged adults.157 People vary in their
resilience. An event that will wipe one person out can be shrugged off
by another. But therapists with a little second-hand knowledge of Freud
often axiomatically assume that a distressed adult in their practice
must have been subject to childhood sexual abuse. Why else would they be
distressed? So, they dig, and infer, and intimate, and suggest, and
overreact, and bias and tilt. They exaggerate the importance of some
events, and downplay the importance of others. They trim the facts to
fit their theory.158 And they convince their clients that they were
sexually abused—if they could only remember. And then the clients start
to remember. And then they start to accuse. And sometimes what they
remember never happened, and the people accused are innocent. The good
news? At least the therapist’s theory remains intact. That’s good—for
the therapist. But there’s no shortage of collateral damage. However,
people are often willing to produce a lot of collateral damage if they
can retain their theory.</p>
<p>I knew about all this when Miss S came to talk to me about her sexual
experiences. When she recounted her trips to the singles bars, and their
recurring aftermath, I thought a bunch of things at once. I thought,
“You’re so vague and so non-existent. You’re a denizen of chaos and the
underworld. You are going ten different places at the same time. Anyone
can take you by the hand and guide you down the road of their choosing.”
After all, if you’re not the leading man in your own drama, you’re a bit
player in someone else’s—and you might well be assigned to play a
dismal, lonely and tragic part. After Miss S recounted her story, we sat
there. I thought, “You have normal sexual desires. You’re extremely
lonely. You’re unfulfilled sexually. You’re afraid of men and ignorant
of the world and know nothing of yourself. You wander around like an
accident waiting to happen and the accident happens and that’s your
life.”</p>
<p>I thought, “Part of you wants to be taken. Part of you wants to be a
child. You were abused by your brothers and ignored by your father and
so part of you wants revenge upon men. Part of you is guilty. Another
part is ashamed. Another part is thrilled and excited. Who are you? What
did you do? What happened?” What was the objective truth? There was no
way of knowing the objective truth. And there never would be. There was
no objective observer, and there never would be. There was no complete
and accurate story. Such a thing did not and could not exist. There
were, and are, only partial accounts and fragmentary viewpoints. But
some are still better than others. Memory is not a description of the
objective past. Memory is a tool. Memory is the past’s guide to the
future. If you remember that something bad happened, and you can figure
out why, then you can try to avoid that bad thing happening again.
That’s the purpose of memory. It’s not “to remember the past.” It’s to
stop the same damn thing from happening over and over.</p>
<p>I thought, “I could simplify Miss S’s life. I could say that her
suspicions of rape were fully justified, and that her doubt about the
events was nothing but additional evidence of her thorough and long-term
victimization. I could insist that her sexual partners had a legal
obligation to ensure that she was not too impaired by alcohol to give
consent. I could tell her that she had indisputably been subject to
violent and illicit acts, unless she had consented to each sexual move
explicitly and verbally. I could tell her that she was an innocent
victim.” I could have told her all that. And it would have been true.
And she would have accepted it as true, and remembered it for the rest
of her life. She would have been a new person, with a new history, and a
new destiny.</p>
<p>But I also thought, “I could tell Miss S that she is a walking
disaster. I could tell her that she wanders into a bar like a courtesan
in a coma, that she is a danger to herself and others, that she needs to
wake up, and that if she goes to singles bars and drinks too much and is
taken home and has rough violent sex (or even tender caring sex), then
what the hell does she expect?” In other words, I could have told her,
in more philosophical terms, that she was Nietzsche’s “pale
criminal”—the person who at one moment dares to break the sacred law and
at the next shrinks from paying the price. And that would have been
true, too, and she would have accepted it as such, and remembered
it.</p>
<p>If I had been the adherent of a left-wing, social-justice ideology, I
would have told her the first story. If I had been the adherent of a
conservative ideology, I would have told her the second. And her
responses after having been told either the first or the second story
would have proved to my satisfaction and hers that the story I had told
her was true—completely, irrefutably true. And that would have been
advice.</p>
<p>Figure It Out for Yourself</p>
<p>I decided instead to listen. I have learned not to steal my clients’
problems from them. I don’t want to be the redeeming hero or the deus ex
machina—not in someone else’s story. I don’t want their lives. So, I
asked her to tell me what she thought, and I listened. She talked a lot.
When we were finished, she still didn’t know if she had been raped, and
neither did I. Life is very complicated.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to change the way you understand everything to
properly understand a single something. “Was I raped?” can be a very
complicated question. The mere fact that the question would present
itself in that form indicates the existence of infinite layers of
complexity—to say nothing of “five times.” There are a myriad of
questions hidden inside “Was I raped?”: What is rape? What is consent?
What constitutes appropriate sexual caution? How should a person defend
herself? Where does the fault lie? “Was I raped?” is a hydra. If you cut
off the head of a hydra, seven more grow. That’s life. Miss S would have
had to talk for twenty years to figure out whether she had been raped.
And someone would have had to be there to listen. I started the process,
but circumstances made it impossible for me to finish. She left therapy
with me only somewhat less ill-formed and vague than when she first met
me. But at least she didn’t leave as the living embodiment of my damned
ideology.</p>
<p>The people I listen to need to talk, because that’s how people think.
People need to think. Otherwise they wander blindly into pits. When
people think, they simulate the world, and plan how to act in it. If
they do a good job of simulating, they can figure out what stupid things
they shouldn’t do. Then they can not do them. Then they don’t have to
suffer the consequences. That’s the purpose of thinking. But we can’t do
it alone. We simulate the world, and plan our actions in it. Only human
beings do this. That’s how brilliant we are. We make little avatars of
ourselves. We place those avatars in fictional worlds. Then we watch
what happens. If our avatar thrives, then we act like he does, in the
real world. Then we thrive (we hope). If our avatar fails, we don’t go
there, if we have any sense. We let him die in the fictional world, so
that we don’t have to really die in the present.</p>
<p>Imagine two children talking. The younger one says, “Wouldn’t it be
fun to climb up on the roof?” He has just placed a little avatar of
himself in a fictional world. But his older sister objects. She chimes
in. “That’s stupid,” she says. “What if you fall off the roof? What if
Dad catches you?” The younger child can then modify the original
simulation, draw the appropriate conclusion, and let the whole fictional
world wither on the vine. Or not. Maybe the risk is worth it. But at
least now it can be factored in. The fictional world is a bit more
complete, and the avatar a bit wiser.</p>
<p>People think they think, but it’s not true. It’s mostly
self-criticism that passes for thinking. True thinking is rare—just like
true listening. Thinking is listening to yourself. It’s difficult. To
think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you
have to let those people disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue
between two or more different views of the world. Viewpoint One is an
avatar in a simulated world. It has its own representations of past,
present and future, and its own ideas about how to act. So do Viewpoints
Two, and Three, and Four. Thinking is the process by which these
internal avatars imagine and articulate their worlds to one another. You
can’t set straw men against one another when you’re thinking, either,
because then you’re not thinking. You’re rationalizing, post-hoc. You’re
matching what you want against a weak opponent so that you don’t have to
change your mind. You’re propagandizing. You’re using double-speak.
You’re using your conclusions to justify your proofs. You’re hiding from
the truth.</p>
<p>True thinking is complex and demanding. It requires you to be
articulate speaker and careful, judicious listener, at the same time. It
involves conflict. So, you have to tolerate conflict. Conflict involves
negotiation and compromise. So, you have to learn to give and take and
to modify your premises and adjust your thoughts—even your perceptions
of the world. Sometimes it results in the defeat and elimination of one
or more internal avatar. They don’t like to be defeated or eliminated,
either. They’re hard to build. They’re valuable. They’re alive. They
like to stay alive. They’ll fight to stay alive. You better listen to
them. If you don’t they’ll go underground and turn into devils and
torture you. In consequence, thinking is emotionally painful, as well as
physiologically demanding; more so than anything else—except not
thinking. But you have to be very articulate and sophisticated to have
all of this occur inside your own head. What are you to do, then, if you
aren’t very good at thinking, at being two people at one time? That’s
easy. You talk. But you need someone to listen. A listening person is
your collaborator and your opponent.</p>
<p>A listening person tests your talking (and your thinking) without
having to say anything. A listening person is a representative of common
humanity. He stands for the crowd. Now the crowd is by no means always
right, but it’s commonly right. It’s typically right. If you say
something that takes everyone aback, therefore, you should reconsider
what you said. I say that, knowing full well that controversial opinions
are sometimes correct—sometimes so much so that the crowd will perish if
it refuses to listen. It is for this reason, among others, that the
individual is morally obliged to stand up and tell the truth of his or
her own experience. But something new and radical is still almost always
wrong. You need good, even great, reasons to ignore or defy general,
public opinion. That’s your culture. It’s a mighty oak. You perch on one
of its branches. If the branch breaks, it’s a long way down—farther,
perhaps, than you think. If you’re reading this book, there’s a strong
probability that you’re a privileged person. You can read. You have time
to read. You’re perched high in the clouds. It took untold generations
to get you where you are. A little gratitude might be in order. If
you’re going to insist on bending the world to your way, you better have
your reasons. If you’re going to stand your ground, you better have your
reasons. You better have thought them through. You might otherwise be in
for a very hard landing. You should do what other people do, unless you
have a very good reason not to. If you’re in a rut, at least you know
that other people have travelled that path. Out of the rut is too often
off the road. And in the desert that awaits off the road there are
highwaymen and monsters.</p>
<p>So speaks wisdom.</p>
<p>A Listening Person</p>
<p>A listening person can reflect the crowd. He can do that without
talking. He can do that merely by letting the talking person listen to
himself. That is what Freud recommended. He had his patients lay on a
couch, look at the ceiling, let their minds wander, and say whatever
wandered in. That’s his method of free association. That’s the way the
Freudian psychoanalyst avoids transferring his or her own personal
biases and opinions into the internal landscape of the patient. It was
for such reasons that Freud did not face his patients. He did not want
their spontaneous meditations to be altered by his emotional
expressions, no matter how slight. He was properly concerned that his
own opinions—and, worse, his own unresolved problems—would find
themselves uncontrollably reflected in his responses and reactions,
conscious and unconscious alike. He was afraid that he would in such a
manner detrimentally affect the development of his patients. It was for
such reasons, as well, that Freud insisted that psychoanalysts be
analyzed themselves. He wanted those who practiced his method to uncover
and eliminate some of their own worst blind spots and prejudices, so
they would not practise corruptly. Freud had a point. He was, after all,
a genius. You can tell that because people still hate him. But there are
disadvantages to the detached and somewhat distant approach recommended
by Freud. Many of those who seek therapy desire and need a closer, more
personal relationship (although that also has its dangers). This is in
part why I have opted in my practice for the conversation, instead of
the Freudian method—as have most clinical psychologists.</p>
<p>It can be worthwhile for my clients to see my reactions. To protect
them from the undue influence that might produce, I attempt to set my
aim properly, so that my responses emerge from the appropriate
motivation. I do what I can to want the best for them (whatever that
might be). I do my best to want the best, period, as well (because that
is part of wanting the best for my clients). I try to clear my mind, and
to leave my own concerns aside. That way I am concentrating on what is
best for my clients, while I am simultaneously alert to any cues that I
might be misunderstanding what that best is. That’s something that has
to be negotiated, not assumed on my part. It’s something that has to be
managed very carefully, to mitigate the risks of close, personal
interaction. My clients talk. I listen. Sometimes I respond. Often the
response is subtle. It’s not even verbal. My clients and I face each
other. We make eye contact. We can see each other’s expressions. They
can observe the effects of their words on me, and I can observe the
effects of mine on them. They can respond to my responses.</p>
<p>A client of mine might say, “I hate my wife.” It’s out there, once
said. It’s hanging in the air. It has emerged from the underworld,
materialized from chaos, and manifested itself. It is perceptible and
concrete and no longer easily ignored. It’s become real. The speaker has
even startled himself. He sees the same thing reflected in my eyes. He
notes that, and continues on the road to sanity. “Hold it,” he says.
“Back up. That’s too harsh. Sometimes I hate my wife. I hate her when
she won’t tell me what she wants. My mom did that all the time, too. It
drove Dad crazy. It drove all of us crazy, to tell you the truth. It
even drove Mom crazy! She was a nice person, but she was very resentful.
Well, at least my wife isn’t as bad as my mother. Not at all. Wait! I
guess my wife is actually pretty good at telling me what she wants, but
I get really bothered when she doesn’t, because Mom tortured us all half
to death being a martyr. That really affected me. Maybe I overreact now
when it happens even a bit. Hey! I’m acting just like Dad did when Mom
upset him! That isn’t me. That doesn’t have anything to do with my wife!
I better let her know.” I observe from all this that my client had
failed previously to properly distinguish his wife from his mother. And
I see that he was possessed, unconsciously, by the spirit of his father.
He sees all of that too. Now he is a bit more differentiated, a bit less
an uncarved block, a bit less hidden in the fog. He has sewed up a small
tear in the fabric of his culture. He says, “That was a good session,
Dr. Peterson.” I nod. You can be pretty smart if you can just shut
up.</p>
<p>I’m a collaborator and opponent even when I’m not talking. I can’t
help it. My expressions broadcast my response, even when they’re subtle.
So, I’m communicating, as Freud so rightly stressed, even when silent.
But I also talk in my clinical sessions. How do I know when to say
something? First, as I said, I put myself in the proper frame of mind. I
aim properly. I want things to be better. My mind orients itself, given
this goal. It tries to produce responses to the therapeutic dialogue
that furthers that aim. I watch what happens, internally. I reveal my
responses. That’s the first rule. Sometimes, for example, a client will
say something, and a thought will occur to me, or a fantasy flit through
my mind. Frequently it’s about something that was said by the same
client earlier that day, or during a previous session. Then I tell my
client that thought or fantasy. Disinterestedly. I say, “You said this
and I noticed that I then became aware of this.” Then we discuss it. We
try to determine the relevance of meaning of my reaction. Sometimes,
perhaps, it’s about me. That was Freud’s point. But sometimes it is just
the reaction of a detached but positively inclined human being to a
personally revealing statement by another human being. It’s
meaningful—sometimes, even, corrective. Sometimes, however, it’s me that
gets corrected.</p>
<p>You have to get along with other people. A therapist is one of those
other people. A good therapist will tell you the truth about what he
thinks. (That is not the same thing as telling you that what he thinks
is the truth.) Then at least you have the honest opinion of at least one
person. That’s not so easy to get. That’s not nothing. That’s key to the
psychotherapeutic process: two people tell each other the truth—and both
listen.</p>
<p>How Should You Listen?</p>
<p>Carl Rogers, one of the twentieth century’s great psychotherapists,
knew something about listening. He wrote, “The great majority of us
cannot listen; we find ourselves compelled to evaluate, because
listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage, and we do
not always have it.”159 He knew that listening could transform people.
On that, Rogers commented, “Some of you may be feeling that you listen
well to people, and that you have never seen such results. The chances
are very great indeed that your listening has not been of the type I
have described.” He suggested that his readers conduct a short
experiment when they next found themselves in a dispute: “Stop the
discussion for a moment, and institute this rule: ‘Each person can speak
up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings
of the previous speaker accurately, and to that speaker’s
satisfaction.’” I have found this technique very useful, in my private
life and in my practice. I routinely summarize what people have said to
me, and ask them if I have understood properly. Sometimes they accept my
summary. Sometimes I am offered a small correction. Now and then I am
wrong completely. All of that is good to know.</p>
<p>There are several primary advantages to this process of summary. The
first advantage is that I genuinely come to understand what the person
is saying. Of this, Rogers notes, “Sounds simple, doesn’t it? But if you
try it you will discover it is one of the most difficult things you have
ever tried to do. If you really understand a person in this way, if you
are willing to enter his private world and see the way life appears to
him, you run the risk of being changed yourself. You might see it his
way, you might find yourself influenced in your attitudes or
personality. This risk of being changed is one of the most frightening
prospects most of us can face.” More salutary words have rarely been
written.</p>
<p>The second advantage to the act of summary is that it aids the person
in consolidation and utility of memory. Consider the following
situation: A client in my practice recounts a long, meandering,
emotion-laden account of a difficult period in his or her life. We
summarize, back and forth. The account becomes shorter. It is now summed
up, in the client’s memory (and in mine) in the form we discussed. It is
now a different memory, in many ways—with luck, a better memory. It is
now less weighty. It has been distilled; reduced to the gist. We have
extracted the moral of the story. It becomes a description of the cause
and the result of what happened, formulated such that repetition of the
tragedy and pain becomes less likely in the future. “This is what
happened. This is why. This is what I have to do to avoid such things
from now on”: That’s a successful memory. That’s the purpose of memory.
You remember the past not so that it is “accurately recorded,” to say it
again, but so that you are prepared for the future.</p>
<p>The third advantage to employing the Rogerian method is the
difficulty it poses to the careless construction of straw-man arguments.
When someone opposes you, it is very tempting to oversimplify, parody,
or distort his or her position. This is a counterproductive game,
designed both to harm the dissenter and to unjustly raise your personal
status. By contrast, if you are called upon to summarize someone’s
position, so that the speaking person agrees with that summary, you may
have to state the argument even more clearly and succinctly than the
speaker has even yet managed. If you first give the devil his due,
looking at his arguments from his perspective, you can (1) find the
value in them, and learn something in the process, or (2) hone your
positions against them (if you still believe they are wrong) and
strengthen your arguments further against challenge. This will make you
much stronger. Then you will no longer have to misrepresent your
opponent’s position (and may well have bridged at least part of the gap
between the two of you). You will also be much better at withstanding
your own doubts.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes a long time to figure out what someone genuinely
means when they are talking. This is because often they are articulating
their ideas for the first time. They can’t do it without wandering down
blind alleys or making contradictory or even nonsensical claims. This is
partly because talking (and thinking) is often more about forgetting
than about remembering. To discuss an event, particularly something
emotional, like a death or serious illness, is to slowly choose what to
leave behind. To begin, however, much that is not necessary must be put
into words. The emotion-laden speaker must recount the whole experience,
in detail. Only then can the central narrative, cause and consequence,
come into focus or consolidate itself. Only then can the moral of the
story be derived.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone holds a stack of hundred-dollar bills, some of
which are counterfeit. All the bills might have to be spread on a table,
so that each can be seen, and any differences noted, before the genuine
can be distinguished from the false. This is the sort of methodical
approach you have to take when really listening to someone trying to
solve a problem or communicate something important. If upon learning
that some of the bills are counterfeit you too casually dismiss all of
them (as you would if you were in a hurry, or otherwise unwilling to put
in the effort), the person will never learn to separate wheat from
chaff.</p>
<p>If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will
generally tell you everything they are thinking—and with very little
deceit. People will tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting
things. Very few of your conversations will be boring. (You can in fact
tell whether or not you are actually listening in this manner. If the
conversation is boring, you probably aren’t.)</p>
<p>Primate Dominance–Hierarchy Manoeuvres—and Wit</p>
<p>Not all talking is thinking. Nor does all listening foster
transformation. There are other motives for both, some of which produce
much less valuable, counterproductive and even dangerous outcomes. There
is the conversation, for example, where one participant is speaking
merely to establish or confirm his place in the dominance hierarchy. One
person begins by telling a story about some interesting occurrence,
recent or past, that involved something good, bad or surprising enough
to make the listening worthwhile. The other person, now concerned with
his or her potentially substandard status as less-interesting
individual, immediately thinks of something better, worse, or more
surprising to relate. This isn’t one of those situations where two
conversational participants are genuinely playing off each other,
riffing on the same themes, for the mutual enjoyment of both (and
everyone else). This is jockeying for position, pure and simple. You can
tell when one of those conversations is occurring. They are accompanied
by a feeling of embarrassment among speakers and alike, all who know
that something false and exaggerated has just been said.</p>
<p>There is another, closely allied form of conversation, where neither
speaker is listening in the least to the other. Instead, each is using
the time occupied by the current speaker to conjure up what he or she
will say next, which will often be something off-topic, because the
person anxiously waiting to speak has not been listening. This can and
will bring the whole conversational train to a shuddering halt. At this
point, it is usual for those who were on board during the crash to
remain silent, and look occasionally and in a somewhat embarrassed
manner at each other, until everyone leaves, or someone thinks of
something witty and puts Humpty Dumpty together again.</p>
<p>Then there is the conversation where one participant is trying to
attain victory for his point of view. This is yet another variant of the
dominance-hierarchy conversation. During such a conversation, which
often tends toward the ideological, the speaker endeavours to (1)
denigrate or ridicule the viewpoint of anyone holding a contrary
position, (2) use selective evidence while doing so and, finally, (3)
impress the listeners (many of whom are already occupying the same
ideological space) with the validity of his assertions. The goal is to
gain support for a comprehensive, unitary, oversimplified world-view.
Thus, the purpose of the conversation is to make the case that not
thinking is the correct tack. The person who is speaking in this manner
believes that winning the argument makes him right, and that doing so
necessarily validates the assumption-structure of the dominance
hierarchy he most identifies with. This is often—and unsurprisingly—the
hierarchy within which he has achieved the most success, or the one with
which he is most temperamentally aligned. Almost all discussions
involving politics or economics unfold in this manner, with each
participant attempting to justify fixed, a priori positions instead of
trying to learn something or to adopt a different frame (even for the
novelty). It is for this reason that conservatives and liberals alike
believe their positions to be self-evident, particularly as they become
more extreme. Given certain temperamentally-based assumptions, a
predictable conclusion emerges—but only when you ignore the fact that
the assumptions themselves are mutable.</p>
<p>These conversations are very different from the listening type. When
a genuine listening conversation is taking place, one person at a time
has the floor, and everyone else is listening. The person speaking is
granted the opportunity to seriously discuss some event, usually unhappy
or even tragic. Everyone else responds sympathetically. These
conversations are important because the speaker is organizing the
troublesome event in his or her mind, while recounting the story. The
fact is important enough to bear repeating: people organize their brains
with conversation. If they don’t have anyone to tell their story to,
they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves.
The input of the community is required for the integrity of the
individual psyche. To put it another way: It takes a village to organize
a mind.</p>
<p>Much of what we consider healthy mental function is the result of our
ability to use the reactions of others to keep our complex selves
functional. We outsource the problem of our sanity. This is why it is
the fundamental responsibility of parents to render their children
socially acceptable. If a person’s behaviour is such that other people
can tolerate him, then all he has to do is place himself in a social
context. Then people will indicate—by being interested in or bored by
what he says, or laughing or not laughing at his jokes, or teasing or
ridiculing, or even by lifting an eyebrow—whether his actions and
statements are what they should be. Everyone is always broadcasting to
everyone else their desire to encounter the ideal. We punish and reward
each other precisely to the degree that each of us behaves in keeping
with that desire—except, of course, when we are looking for trouble.</p>
<p>The sympathetic responses offered during a genuine conversation
indicate that the teller is valued, and that the story being told is
important, serious, deserving of consideration, and understandable. Men
and women often misunderstand each other when these conversations are
focused on a specified problem. Men are often accused of wanting to “fix
things” too early on in a discussion. This frustrates men, who like to
solve problems and to do it efficiently and who are in fact called upon
frequently by women for precisely that purpose. It might be easier for
my male readers to understand why this does not work, however, if they
could realize and then remember that before a problem can be solved it
must be formulated precisely. Women are often intent on formulating the
problem when they are discussing something, and they need to be listened
to—even questioned—to help ensure clarity in the formulation. Then,
whatever problem is left, if any, can be helpfully solved. (It should
also be noted first that too-early problem-solving may also merely
indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating
conversation.)</p>
<p>Another conversational variant is the lecture. A lecture is—somewhat
surprisingly—a conversation. The lecturer speaks, but the audience
communicates with him or her non-verbally. A surprising amount of human
interaction—much of the delivery of emotional information, for
example—takes place in this manner, through postural display and facial
emotion (as we noted in our discussion of Freud). A good lecturer is not
only delivering facts (which is perhaps the least important part of a
lecture), but also telling stories about those facts, pitching them
precisely to the level of the audience’s comprehension, gauging that by
the interest they are showing. The story he or she is telling conveys to
the members of the audience not only what the facts are, but why they
are relevant—why it is important to know certain things about which they
are currently ignorant. To demonstrate the importance of some set of
facts is to tell those audience members how such knowledge could change
their behaviour, or influence the way they interpret the world, so that
they will now be able to avoid some obstacles and progress more rapidly
to some better goals.</p>
<p>A good lecturer is thus talking with and not at or even to his or her
listeners. To manage this, the lecturer needs to be closely attending to
the audience’s every move, gesture and sound. Perversely, this cannot be
done by watching the audience, as such. A good lecturer speaks directly
to and watches the response of single, identifiable people,fn2 instead
of doing something clichéd, such as “presenting a talk” to an audience.
Everything about that phrase is wrong. You don’t present. You talk.
There is no such thing as “a talk,” unless it’s canned, and it shouldn’t
be. There is also no “audience.” There are individuals, who need to be
included in the conversation. A well-practised and competent public
speaker addresses a single, identifiable person, watches that individual
nod, shake his head, frown, or look confused, and responds appropriately
and directly to those gestures and expressions. Then, after a few
phrases, rounding out some idea, he switches to another audience member,
and does the same thing. In this manner, he infers and reacts to the
attitude of the entire group (insofar as such a thing exists).</p>
<p>There are still other conversations that work primarily as
demonstrations of wit. These also have a dominance element, but the goal
is to be the most entertaining speaker (which is an accomplishment that
everyone participating will also enjoy). The purpose of these
conversations, as a witty friend of mine once observed, was to say
“anything that was either true or funny.” As truth and humour are often
close allies, that combination worked fine. I think that this might be
the intelligent blue-collar worker’s conversation. I participated in
many fine bouts of sarcasm, satire, insult and generally over-the-top
comedic exchange around among people I grew up with in Northern Alberta
and, later, among some Navy SEALs I met in California, who were friends
of an author I know who writes somewhat horrifying popular fiction. They
were all perfectly happy to say anything, no matter how appalling, as
long it was funny.</p>
<p>I attended this writer’s fortieth birthday celebration not too long
ago in LA. He had invited one of the aforementioned SEALs. A few months
beforehand, however, his wife had been diagnosed with a serious medical
condition, necessitating brain surgery. He called up his SEAL friend,
informed him of the circumstances, and indicated that the event might
have to be cancelled. “You think you guys have a problem,” responded his
friend. “I just bought non-refundable airline tickets to your party!”
It’s not clear what percentage of the world’s population would find that
response amusing. I retold the story recently to a group of newer
acquaintances and they were more shocked and appalled than amused. I
tried to defend the joke as an indication of the SEAL’s respect for the
couple’s ability to withstand and transcend tragedy, but I wasn’t
particularly successful. Nonetheless, I believe that he did intend
exactly that respect, and I think he was terrifyingly witty. His joke
was daring, anarchic to the point of recklessness, which is exactly the
point where serious funny occurs. My friend and his wife recognized the
compliment. They saw that their friend knew they were tough enough to
withstand that level of—well, let’s call it competitive humour. It was a
test of character, which they passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>I found that such conversations occurred less and less frequently as
I moved from university to university, up the educational and social
ladder. Maybe it wasn’t a class thing, although I have my suspicions it
was. Maybe it’s just that I’m older, or that the friends a person makes
later in life, after adolescence, lack the insane competitive closeness
and perverse playfulness of those early tribal bonds. When I went back
up north to my hometown for my fiftieth birthday party, however, my old
friends made me laugh so hard I had to duck into a different room
several times to catch my breath. Those conversations are the most fun,
and I miss them. You have to keep up, or risk severe humiliation, but
there is nothing more rewarding than topping the last comedian’s story,
joke, insult or curse. Only one rule really applies: do not be boring
(although it is also very bad form to actually put someone down, when
you are only pretending to put them down).</p>
<p>Conversation on the Way</p>
<p>The final type of conversation, akin to listening, is a form of
mutual exploration. It requires true reciprocity on the part of those
listening and speaking. It allows all participants to express and
organize their thoughts. A conversation of mutual exploration has a
topic, generally complex, of genuine interest to the participants.
Everyone participating is trying to solve a problem, instead of
insisting on the a priori validity of their own positions. All are
acting on the premise that they have something to learn. This kind of
conversation constitutes active philosophy, the highest form of thought,
and the best preparation for proper living.</p>
<p>The people involved in such a conversation must be discussing ideas
they genuinely use to structure their perceptions and guide their
actions and words. They must be existentially involved with their
philosophy: that is, they must be living it, not merely believing or
understanding it. They also must have inverted, at least temporarily,
the typical human preference for order over chaos (and I don’t mean the
chaos typical of mindless antisocial rebellion). Other conversational
types—except for the listening type—all attempt to buttress some
existing order. The conversation of mutual exploration, by contrast,
requires people who have decided that the unknown makes a better friend
than the known.</p>
<p>You already know what you know, after all—and, unless your life is
perfect, what you know is not enough. You remain threatened by disease,
and self-deception, and unhappiness, and malevolence, and betrayal, and
corruption, and pain, and limitation. You are subject to all these
things, in the final analysis, because you are just too ignorant to
protect yourself. If you just knew enough, you could be healthier and
more honest. You would suffer less. You could recognize, resist and even
triumph over malevolence and evil. You would neither betray a friend,
nor deal falsely and deceitfully in business, politics or love. However,
your current knowledge has neither made you perfect nor kept you safe.
So, it is insufficient, by definition—radically, fatally
insufficient.</p>
<p>You must accept this before you can converse philosophically, instead
of convincing, oppressing, dominating or even amusing. You must accept
this before you can tolerate a conversation where the Word that
eternally mediates between order and chaos is operating, psychologically
speaking. To have this kind of conversation, it is necessary to respect
the personal experience of your conversational partners. You must assume
that they have reached careful, thoughtful, genuine conclusions (and,
perhaps, they must have done the work that justifies this assumption).
You must believe that if they shared their conclusions with you, you
could bypass at least some of the pain of personally learning the same
things (as learning from the experience of others can be quicker and
much less dangerous). You must meditate, too, instead of strategizing
towards victory. If you fail, or refuse, to do so, then you merely and
automatically repeat what you already believe, seeking its validation
and insisting on its rightness. But if you are meditating as you
converse, then you listen to the other person, and say the new and
original things that can rise from deep within of their own accord.</p>
<p>It’s as if you are listening to yourself during such a conversation,
just as you are listening to the other person. You are describing how
you are responding to the new information imparted by the speaker. You
are reporting what that information has done to you—what new things it
made appear within you, how it has changed your presuppositions, how it
has made you think of new questions. You tell the speaker these things,
directly. Then they have the same effect on him. In this manner, you
both move towards somewhere newer and broader and better. You both
change, as you let your old presuppositions die—as you shed your skins
and emerge renewed.</p>
<p>A conversation such as this is one where it is the desire for truth
itself—on the part of both participants—that is truly listening and
speaking. That’s why it’s engaging, vital, interesting and meaningful.
That sense of meaning is a signal from the deep, ancient parts of your
Being. You’re where you should be, with one foot in order, and the other
tentatively extended into chaos and the unknown. You’re immersed in the
Tao, following the great Way of Life. There, you’re stable enough to be
secure, but flexible enough to transform. There, you’re allowing new
information to inform you—to permeate your stability, to repair and
improve its structure, and expand its domain. There the constituent
elements of your Being can find their more elegant formation. A
conversation like that places you in the same place that listening to
great music places you, and for much the same reason. A conversation
like that puts you in the realm where souls connect, and that’s a real
place. It leaves you thinking, “That was really worthwhile. We really
got to know each other.” The masks came off, and the searchers were
revealed.</p>
<p>So, listen, to yourself and to those with whom you are speaking. Your
wisdom then consists not of the knowledge you already have, but the
continual search for knowledge, which is the highest form of wisdom. It
is for this reason that the priestess of the Delphic Oracle in ancient
Greece spoke most highly of Socrates, who always sought the truth. She
described him as the wisest living man, because he knew that what he
knew was nothing.</p>
<p>Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you
don’t.</p>
