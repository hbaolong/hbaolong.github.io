<h4 id="rule-4">RULE 4</h4>
<p>COMPARE YOURSELF TO WHO YOU WERE YESTERDAY, NOT TO WHO SOMEONE ELSE
IS TODAY</p>
<p>THE INTERNAL CRITIC</p>
<p>It was easier for people to be good at something when more of us
lived in small, rural communities. Someone could be homecoming queen.
Someone else could be spelling-bee champ, math whiz or basketball star.
There were only one or two mechanics and a couple of teachers. In each
of their domains, these local heroes had the opportunity to enjoy the
serotonin-fuelled confidence of the victor. It may be for that reason
that people who were born in small towns are statistically
overrepresented among the eminent.68 If you’re one in a million now, but
originated in modern New York, there’s twenty of you—and most of us now
live in cities. What’s more, we have become digitally connected to the
entire seven billion. Our hierarchies of accomplishment are now
dizzyingly vertical.</p>
<p>No matter how good you are at something, or how you rank your
accomplishments, there is someone out there who makes you look
incompetent. You’re a decent guitar player, but you’re not Jimmy Page or
Jack White. You’re almost certainly not even going to rock your local
pub. You’re a good cook, but there are many great chefs. Your mother’s
recipe for fish heads and rice, no matter how celebrated in her village
of origin, doesn’t cut it in these days of grapefruit foam and
Scotch/tobacco ice-cream. Some Mafia don has a tackier yacht. Some
obsessive CEO has a more complicated self-winding watch, kept in his
more valuable mechanical hardwood-and-steel automatic self-winding watch
case. Even the most stunning Hollywood actress eventually transforms
into the Evil Queen, on eternal, paranoid watch for the new Snow White.
And you? Your career is boring and pointless, your housekeeping skills
are second-rate, your taste is appalling, you’re fatter than your
friends, and everyone dreads your parties. Who cares if you are prime
minister of Canada when someone else is the president of the United
States?</p>
<p>Inside us dwells a critical internal voice and spirit that knows all
this. It’s predisposed to make its noisy case. It condemns our mediocre
efforts. It can be very difficult to quell. Worse, critics of its sort
are necessary. There is no shortage of tasteless artists, tuneless
musicians, poisonous cooks, bureaucratically-personality-disordered
middle managers, hack novelists and tedious, ideology-ridden professors.
Things and people differ importantly in their qualities. Awful music
torments listeners everywhere. Poorly designed buildings crumble in
earthquakes. Substandard automobiles kill their drivers when they crash.
Failure is the price we pay for standards and, because mediocrity has
consequences both real and harsh, standards are necessary.</p>
<p>We are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be. A very
small number of people produce very much of everything. The winners
don’t take all, but they take most, and the bottom is not a good place
to be. People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there, and remain
unknown and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In
consequence, the self-denigrating voice in the minds of people weaves a
devastating tale. Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default
condition. What but willful blindness could possibly shelter people from
such withering criticism? It is for such reasons that a whole generation
of social psychologists recommended “positive illusions” as the only
reliable route to mental health.69 Their credo? Let a lie be your
umbrella. A more dismal, wretched, pessimistic philosophy can hardly be
imagined: things are so terrible that only delusion can save you.</p>
<p>Here is an alternative approach (and one that requires no illusions).
If the cards are always stacked against you, perhaps the game you are
playing is somehow rigged (perhaps by you, unbeknownst to yourself). If
the internal voice makes you doubt the value of your endeavours—or your
life, or life itself—perhaps you should stop listening. If the critical
voice within says the same denigrating things about everyone, no matter
how successful, how reliable can it be? Maybe its comments are chatter,
not wisdom. There will always be people better than you—that’s a cliché
of nihilism, like the phrase, In a million years, who’s going to know
the difference? The proper response to that statement is not, Well,
then, everything is meaningless. It’s, Any idiot can choose a frame of
time within which nothing matters. Talking yourself into irrelevance is
not a profound critique of Being. It’s a cheap trick of the rational
mind.</p>
<p>Many Good Games</p>
<p>Standards of better or worse are not illusory or unnecessary. If you
hadn’t decided that what you are doing right now was better than the
alternatives, you wouldn’t be doing it. The idea of a value-free choice
is a contradiction in terms. Value judgments are a precondition for
action. Furthermore, every activity, once chosen, comes with its own
internal standards of accomplishment. If something can be done at all,
it can be done better or worse. To do anything at all is therefore to
play a game with a defined and valued end, which can always be reached
more or less efficiently and elegantly. Every game comes with its chance
of success or failure. Differentials in quality are omnipresent.
Furthermore, if there was no better and worse, nothing would be worth
doing. There would be no value and, therefore, no meaning. Why make an
effort if it doesn’t improve anything? Meaning itself requires the
difference between better and worse. How, then, can the voice of
critical self-consciousness be stilled? Where are the flaws in the
apparently impeccable logic of its message?</p>
<p>We might start by considering the all-too-black-and-white words
themselves: “success” or “failure.” You are either a success, a
comprehensive, singular, over-all good thing, or its opposite, a
failure, a comprehensive, singular, irredeemably bad thing. The words
imply no alternative and no middle ground. However, in a world as
complex as ours, such generalizations (really, such failure to
differentiate) are a sign of naive, unsophisticated or even malevolent
analysis. There are vital degrees and gradations of value obliterated by
this binary system, and the consequences are not good.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is not just one game at which to succeed or
fail. There are many games and, more specifically, many good games—games
that match your talents, involve you productively with other people, and
sustain and even improve themselves across time. Lawyer is a good game.
So is plumber, physician, carpenter, or schoolteacher. The world allows
for many ways of Being. If you don’t succeed at one, you can try
another. You can pick something better matched to your unique mix of
strengths, weaknesses and situation. Furthermore, if changing games does
not work, you can invent a new one. I recently watched a talent show
featuring a mime who taped his mouth shut and did something ridiculous
with oven mitts. That was unexpected. That was original. It seemed to be
working for him.</p>
<p>It’s also unlikely that you’re playing only one game. You have a
career and friends and family members and personal projects and artistic
endeavors and athletic pursuits. You might consider judging your success
across all the games you play. Imagine that you are very good at some,
middling at others, and terrible at the remainder. Perhaps that’s how it
should be. You might object: I should be winning at everything! But
winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new
or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing
might be the most important form of winning. Should victory in the
present always take precedence over trajectory across time?</p>
<p>Finally, you might come to realize that the specifics of the many
games you are playing are so unique to you, so individual, that
comparison to others is simply inappropriate. Perhaps you are
overvaluing what you don’t have and undervaluing what you do. There’s
some real utility in gratitude. It’s also good protection against the
dangers of victimhood and resentment. Your colleague outperforms you at
work. His wife, however, is having an affair, while your marriage is
stable and happy. Who has it better? The celebrity you admire is a
chronic drunk driver and bigot. Is his life truly preferable to
yours?</p>
<p>When the internal critic puts you down using such comparisons, here’s
how it operates: First, it selects a single, arbitrary domain of
comparison (fame, maybe, or power). Then it acts as if that domain is
the only one that is relevant. Then it contrasts you unfavourably with
someone truly stellar, within that domain. It can take that final step
even further, using the unbridgeable gap between you and its target of
comparison as evidence for the fundamental injustice of life. That way
your motivation to do anything at all can be most effectively
undermined. Those who accept such an approach to self-evaluation
certainly can’t be accused of making things too easy for themselves. But
it’s just as big a problem to make things too difficult.</p>
<p>When we are very young we are neither individual nor informed. We
have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own
standards. In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because
standards are necessary. Without them, there is nowhere to go and
nothing to do. As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly
individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more
personal and less and less comparable with those of others. Symbolically
speaking, this means we must leave the house ruled by our father, and
confront the chaos of our individual Being. We must take note of our
disarray, without completely abandoning that father in the process. We
must then rediscover the values of our culture—veiled from us by our
ignorance, hidden in the dusty treasure-trove of the past—rescue them,
and integrate them into our own lives. This is what gives existence its
full and necessary meaning.</p>
<p>Who are you? You think you know, but maybe you don’t. You are, for
example, neither your own master, nor your own slave. You cannot easily
tell yourself what to do and compel your own obedience (any more than
you can easily tell your husband, wife, son or daughter what to do, and
compel theirs). You are interested in some things and not in others. You
can shape that interest, but there are limits. Some activities will
always engage you, and others simply will not.</p>
<p>You have a nature. You can play the tyrant to it, but you will
certainly rebel. How hard can you force yourself to work and sustain
your desire to work? How much can you sacrifice to your partner before
generosity turns to resentment? What is it that you actually love? What
is it that you genuinely want? Before you can articulate your own
standards of value, you must see yourself as a stranger—and then you
must get to know yourself. What do you find valuable or pleasurable? How
much leisure, enjoyment, and reward do you require, so that you feel
like more than a beast of burden? How must you treat yourself, so you
won’t kick over the traces and smash up your corral? You could force
yourself through your daily grind and kick your dog in frustration when
you come home. You could watch the precious days tick by. Or you could
learn how to entice yourself into sustainable, productive activity. Do
you ask yourself what you want? Do you negotiate fairly with yourself?
Or are you a tyrant, with yourself as slave?</p>
<p>When do you dislike your parents, your spouse, or your children, and
why? What might be done about that? What do you need and want from your
friends and your business partners? This is not a mere matter of what
you should want. I’m not talking about what other people require from
you, or your duties to them. I’m talking about determining the nature of
your moral obligation, to yourself. Should might enter into it, because
you are nested within a network of social obligations. Should is your
responsibility, and you should live up to it. But this does not mean you
must take the role of lap-dog, obedient and harmless. That’s how a
dictator wants his slaves.</p>
<p>Dare, instead, to be dangerous. Dare to be truthful. Dare to
articulate yourself, and express (or at least become aware of) what
would really justify your life. If you allowed your dark and unspoken
desires for your partner, for example, to manifest themselves—if you
were even willing to consider them—you might discover that they were not
so dark, given the light of day. You might discover, instead, that you
were just afraid and, so, pretending to be moral. You might find that
getting what you actually desire would stop you from being tempted and
straying. Are you so sure that your partner would be unhappy if more of
you rose to the surface? The femme fatale and the anti-hero are sexually
attractive for a reason.…</p>
<p>How do you need to be spoken to? What do you need to take from
people? What are you putting up with, or pretending to like, from duty
or obligation? Consult your resentment. It’s a revelatory emotion, for
all its pathology. It’s part of an evil triad: arrogance, deceit, and
resentment. Nothing causes more harm than this underworld Trinity. But
resentment always means one of two things. Either the resentful person
is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and
get on with it, or there is tyranny afoot—in which case the person
subjugated has a moral obligation to speak up. Why? Because the
consequence of remaining silent is worse. Of course, it’s easier in the
moment to stay silent and avoid conflict. But in the long term, that’s
deadly. When you have something to say, silence is a lie—and tyranny
feeds on lies. When should you push back against oppression, despite the
danger? When you start nursing secret fantasies of revenge; when your
life is being poisoned and your imagination fills with the wish to
devour and destroy.</p>
<p>I had a client decades ago who suffered from severe
obsessive-compulsive disorder. He had to line up his pyjamas just right
before he could go to sleep at night. Then he had to fluff his pillow.
Then he had to adjust the bedsheets. Over and over and over and over. I
said, “Maybe that part of you, that insanely persistent part, wants
something, inarticulate though it may be. Let it have its say. What
could it be?” He said, “Control.” I said, “Close your eyes and let it
tell you what it wants. Don’t let fear stop you. You don’t have to act
it out, just because you’re thinking it.” He said, “It wants me to take
my stepfather by the collar, put him up against the door, and shake him
like a rat.” Maybe it was time to shake someone like a rat, although I
suggested something a bit less primal. But God only knows what battles
must be fought, forthrightly, voluntarily, on the road to peace. What do
you do to avoid conflict, necessary though it may be? What are you
inclined to lie about, assuming that the truth might be intolerable?
What do you fake?</p>
<p>The infant is dependent on his parents for almost everything he
needs. The child—the successful child—can leave his parents, at least
temporarily, and make friends. He gives up a little of himself to do
that, but gains much in return. The successful adolescent must take that
process to its logical conclusion. He has to leave his parents and
become like everyone else. He has to integrate with the group so he can
transcend his childhood dependency. Once integrated, the successful
adult then must learn how to be just the right amount different from
everyone else.</p>
<p>Be cautious when you’re comparing yourself to others. You’re a
singular being, once you’re an adult. You have your own particular,
specific problems—financial, intimate, psychological, and otherwise.
Those are embedded in the unique broader context of your existence. Your
career or job works for you in a personal manner, or it does not, and it
does so in a unique interplay with the other specifics of your life. You
must decide how much of your time to spend on this, and how much on
that. You must decide what to let go, and what to pursue.</p>
<p>The Point of Our Eyes (or, Take Stock)</p>
<p>Our eyes are always pointing at things we are interested in
approaching, or investigating, or looking for, or having. We must see,
but to see, we must aim, so we are always aiming. Our minds are built on
the hunting-and-gathering platforms of our bodies. To hunt is to specify
a target, track it, and throw at it. To gather is to specify and to
grasp. We fling stones, and spears, and boomerangs. We toss balls
through hoops, and hit pucks into nets, and curl carved granite rocks
down the ice onto horizontal bull’s-eyes. We launch projectiles at
targets with bows, guns, rifles and rockets. We hurl insults, launch
plans, and pitch ideas. We succeed when we score a goal or hit a target.
We fail, or sin, when we do not (as the word sin means to miss the
mark70). We cannot navigate, without something to aim at and, while we
are in this world, we must always navigate.71</p>
<p>We are always and simultaneously at point “a” (which is less
desirable than it could be), moving towards point “b” (which we deem
better, in accordance with our explicit and implicit values). We always
encounter the world in a state of insufficiency and seek its correction.
We can imagine new ways that things could be set right, and improved,
even if we have everything we thought we needed. Even when satisfied,
temporarily, we remain curious. We live within a framework that defines
the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If
we did not see things this way, we would not act at all. We wouldn’t
even be able to see, because to see we must focus, and to focus we must
pick one thing above all else on which to focus.</p>
<p>But we can see. We can even see things that aren’t there. We can
envision new ways that things could be better. We can construct new,
hypothetical worlds, where problems we weren’t even aware of can now
show themselves and be addressed. The advantages of this are obvious: we
can change the world so that the intolerable state of the present can be
rectified in the future. The disadvantage to all this foresight and
creativity is chronic unease and discomfort. Because we always contrast
what is with what could be, we have to aim at what could be. But we can
aim too high. Or too low. Or too chaotically. So we fail and live in
disappointment, even when we appear to others to be living well. How can
we benefit from our imaginativeness, our ability to improve the future,
without continually denigrating our current, insufficiently successful
and worthless lives?</p>
<p>The first step, perhaps, is to take stock. Who are you? When you buy
a house and prepare to live in it, you hire an inspector to list all its
faults—as it is, in reality, now, not as you wish it could be. You’ll
even pay him for the bad news. You need to know. You need to discover
the home’s hidden flaws. You need to know whether they are cosmetic
imperfections or structural inadequacies. You need to know because you
can’t fix something if you don’t know it’s broken—and you’re broken. You
need an inspector. The internal critic—it could play that role, if you
could get it on track; if you and it could cooperate. It could help you
take stock. But you must walk through your psychological house with it
and listen judiciously to what it says. Maybe you’re a handy-man’s
dream, a real fixer-upper. How can you start your renovations without
being demoralized, even crushed, by your internal critic’s lengthy and
painful report of your inadequacies?</p>
<p>Here’s a hint. The future is like the past. But there’s a crucial
difference. The past is fixed, but the future—it could be better. It
could be better, some precise amount—the amount that can be achieved,
perhaps, in a day, with some minimal engagement. The present is
eternally flawed. But where you start might not be as important as the
direction you are heading. Perhaps happiness is always to be found in
the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction
awaiting at the next peak. Much of happiness is hope, no matter how deep
the underworld in which that hope was conceived.</p>
<p>Called upon properly, the internal critic will suggest something to
set in order, which you could set in order, which you would set in
order—voluntarily, without resentment, even with pleasure. Ask yourself:
is there one thing that exists in disarray in your life or your
situation that you could, and would, set straight? Could you, and would
you, fix that one thing that announces itself humbly in need of repair?
Could you do it now? Imagine that you are someone with whom you must
negotiate. Imagine further that you are lazy, touchy, resentful and hard
to get along with. With that attitude, it’s not going to be easy to get
you moving. You might have to use a little charm and playfulness.
“Excuse me,” you might say to yourself, without irony or sarcasm. “I’m
trying to reduce some of the unnecessary suffering around here. I could
use some help.” Keep the derision at bay. “I’m wondering if there is
anything that you would be willing to do? I’d be very grateful for your
service.” Ask honestly and with humility. That’s no simple matter.</p>
<p>You might have to negotiate further, depending on your state of mind.
Maybe you don’t trust yourself. You think that you’ll ask yourself for
one thing and, having delivered, immediately demand more. And you’ll be
punitive and hurtful about it. And you’ll denigrate what was already
offered. Who wants to work for a tyrant like that? Not you. That’s why
you don’t do what you want yourself to do. You’re a bad employee—but a
worse boss. Maybe you need to say to yourself, “OK. I know we haven’t
gotten along very well in the past. I’m sorry about that. I’m trying to
improve. I’ll probably make some more mistakes along the way, but I’ll
try to listen if you object. I’ll try to learn. I noticed, just now,
today, that you weren’t really jumping at the opportunity to help when I
asked. Is there something I could offer in return for your cooperation?
Maybe if you did the dishes, we could go for coffee. You like espresso.
How about an espresso—maybe a double shot? Or is there something else
you want?” Then you could listen. Maybe you’ll hear a voice inside
(maybe it’s even the voice of a long-lost child). Maybe it will reply,
“Really? You really want to do something nice for me? You’ll really do
it? It’s not a trick?”</p>
<p>This is where you must be careful.</p>
<p>That little voice—that’s the voice of someone once burnt and twice
shy. So, you could say, very carefully, “Really. I might not do it very
well, and I might not be great company, but I will do something nice for
you. I promise.” A little careful kindness goes a long way, and
judicious reward is a powerful motivator. Then you could take that small
bit of yourself by the hand and do the damn dishes. And then you better
not go clean the bathroom and forget about the coffee or the movie or
the beer or it will be even harder to call those forgotten parts of
yourself forth from the nooks and crannies of the underworld.</p>
<p>You might ask yourself, “What could I say to someone else—my friend,
my brother, my boss, my assistant—that would set things a bit more right
between us tomorrow? What bit of chaos might I eradicate at home, on my
desk, in my kitchen, tonight, so that the stage could be set for a
better play? What snakes might I banish from my closet—and my mind?”
Five hundred small decisions, five hundred tiny actions, compose your
day, today, and every day. Could you aim one or two of these at a better
result? Better, in your own private opinion, by your own individual
standards? Could you compare your specific personal tomorrow with your
specific personal yesterday? Could you use your own judgment, and ask
yourself what that better tomorrow might be?</p>
<p>Aim small. You don’t want to shoulder too much to begin with, given
your limited talents, tendency to deceive, burden of resentment, and
ability to shirk responsibility. Thus, you set the following goal: by
the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better
than they were this morning. Then you ask yourself, “What could I do,
that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would
I like as a reward?” Then you do what you have decided to do, even if
you do it badly. Then you give yourself that damn coffee, in triumph.
Maybe you feel a bit stupid about it, but you do it anyway. And you do
the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each
day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that’s magic.
That’s compound interest. Do that for three years, and your life will be
entirely different. Now you’re aiming for something higher. Now you’re
wishing on a star. Now the beam is disappearing from your eye, and
you’re learning to see. And what you aim at determines what you see.
That’s worth repeating. What you aim at determines what you see.</p>
<p>What You Want and What You See</p>
<p>The dependency of sight on aim (and, therefore, on value—because you
aim at what you value) was demonstrated unforgettably by the cognitive
psychologist Daniel Simons more than fifteen years ago.72 Simons was
investigating something called “sustained inattentional blindness.” He
would sit his research subjects in front of a video monitor and show
them, for example, a field of wheat. Then he would transform the photo
slowly, secretly, while they watched. He would slowly fade in a road
cutting through the wheat. He didn’t insert some little easy-to-miss
footpath, either. It was a major trail, occupying a good third of the
image. Remarkably, the observers would frequently fail to take
notice.</p>
<p>The demonstration that made Dr. Simons famous was of the same kind,
but more dramatic—even unbelievable. First, he produced a video of two
teams of three people.73 One team was wearing white shirts, the other,
black. (The two teams were not off in the distance, either, or in any
way difficult to see. The six of them filled much of the video screen,
and their facial features were close enough to see clearly.) Each team
had its own ball, which they bounced or threw to their other team
members, as they moved and feinted in the small space in front of the
elevators where the game was filmed. Once Dan had his video, he showed
it to his study participants. He asked each of them to count the number
of times the white shirts threw the ball back and forth to one another.
After a few minutes, his subjects were asked to report the number of
passes. Most answered “15.” That was the correct answer. Most felt
pretty good about that. Ha! They passed the test! But then Dr. Simons
asked, “Did you see the gorilla?”</p>
<p>Was this a joke? What gorilla?</p>
<p>So, he said, “Watch the video again. But this time, don’t count.”
Sure enough, a minute or so in, a man dressed in a gorilla suit waltzes
right into the middle of the game for a few long seconds, stops, and
then beats his chest in the manner of stereotyped gorillas everywhere.
Right in the middle of the screen. Large as life. Painfully and
irrefutably evident. But one out of every two of his research subjects
missed it, the first time they saw the video. It gets worse. Dr. Simons
did another study. This time, he showed his subjects a video of someone
being served at a counter. The server dips behind the counter to
retrieve something, and pops back up. So what? Most of his participants
don’t detect anything amiss. But it was a different person who stood up
in the original server’s place! “No way,” you think. “I’d notice.” But
it’s “yes way.” There’s a high probability you wouldn’t detect the
change, even if the gender or race of the person is switched at the same
time. You’re blind too.</p>
<p>This is partly because vision is expensive—psychophysiologically
expensive; neurologically expensive. Very little of your retina is
high-resolution fovea—the very central, high-resolution part of the eye,
used to do such things as identify faces. Each of the scarce foveal
cells needs 10,000 cells in the visual cortex merely to manage the first
part of the multi-stage processing of seeing.74 Then each of those
10,000 requires 10,000 more just to get to stage two. If all your retina
was fovea you would require the skull of a B-movie alien to house your
brain. In consequence, we triage, when we see. Most of our vision is
peripheral, and low resolution. We save the fovea for things of
importance. We point our high-resolution capacities at the few specific
things we are aiming at. And we let everything else—which is almost
everything—fade, unnoticed, into the background.</p>
<p>If something you’re not attending to pops its ugly head up in a
manner that directly interferes with your narrowly focused current
activity, you will see it. Otherwise, it’s just not there. The ball on
which Simons’s research subjects were focused was never obscured by the
gorilla or by any of the six players. Because of that—because the
gorilla did not interfere with the ongoing, narrowly defined task—it was
indistinguishable from everything else the participants didn’t see, when
they were looking at that ball. The big ape could be safely ignored.
That’s how you deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world: you
ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns. You
see things that facilitate your movement forward, toward your desired
goals. You detect obstacles, when they pop up in your path. You’re blind
to everything else (and there’s a lot of everything else—so you’re very
blind). And it has to be that way, because there is much more of the
world than there is of you. You must shepherd your limited resources
carefully. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and
let the rest go.</p>
<p>There’s a profound idea in the ancient Vedic texts (the oldest
scriptures of Hinduism, and part of the bedrock of Indian culture): the
world, as perceived, is maya—appearance or illusion. This means, in
part, that people are blinded by their desires (as well as merely
incapable of seeing things as they truly are). This is true, in a sense
that transcends the metaphorical. Your eyes are tools. They are there to
help you get what you want. The price you pay for that utility, that
specific, focused direction, is blindness to everything else. This
doesn’t matter so much when things are going well, and we are getting
what we want (although it can be a problem, even then, because getting
what we currently want can make blind us to higher callings). But all
that ignored world presents a truly terrible problem when we’re in
crisis, and nothing whatsoever is turning out the way we want it to.
Then, there can be far too much to deal with. Happily, however, that
problem contains within it the seeds of its own solution. Since you’ve
ignored so much, there is plenty of possibility left where you have not
yet looked.</p>
<p>Imagine that you’re unhappy. You’re not getting what you need.
Perversely, this may be because of what you want. You are blind, because
of what you desire. Perhaps what you really need is right in front of
your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently
aiming for. And that brings us to something else: the price that must be
paid before you, or anyone, can get what they want (or, better yet, what
they need). Think about it this way. You look at the world in your
particular, idiosyncratic manner. You use a set of tools to screen most
things out and let some things in. You have spent a lot of time building
those tools. They’ve become habitual. They’re not mere abstract
thoughts. They’re built right into you. They orient you in the world.
They’re your deepest and often implicit and unconscious values. They’ve
become part of your biological structure. They’re alive. And they don’t
want to disappear, or transform, or die. But sometimes their time has
come, and new things need to be born. For this reason (although not only
for this reason) it is necessary to let things go during the journey
uphill. If things are not going well for you—well, that might be
because, as the most cynical of aphorisms has it, life sucks, and then
you die. Before your crisis impels you to that hideous conclusion,
however, you might consider the following: life doesn’t have the
problem. You do. At least that realization leaves you with some options.
If your life is not going well, perhaps it is your current knowledge
that is insufficient, not life itself. Perhaps your value structure
needs some serious retooling. Perhaps what you want is blinding you to
what else could be. Perhaps you are holding on to your desires, in the
present, so tightly that you cannot see anything else—even what you
truly need.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are thinking, enviously, “I should have my boss’s
job.” If your boss sticks to his post, stubbornly and competently,
thoughts like that will lead you into in a state of irritation,
unhappiness and disgust. You might realize this. You think, “I am
unhappy. However, I could be cured of this unhappiness if I could just
fulfill my ambition.” But then you might think further. “Wait,” you
think. “Maybe I’m not unhappy because I don’t have my boss’s job. Maybe
I’m unhappy because I can’t stop wanting that job.” That doesn’t mean
you can just simply and magically tell yourself to stop wanting that
job, and then listen and transform. You won’t—can’t, in fact—just change
yourself that easily. You have to dig deeper. You must change what you
are after more profoundly.</p>
<p>So, you might think, “I don’t know what to do about this stupid
suffering. I can’t just abandon my ambitions. That would leave me
nowhere to go. But my longing for a job that I can’t have isn’t
working.” You might decide to take a different tack. You might ask,
instead, for the revelation of a different plan: one that would fulfill
your desires and gratify your ambitions in a real sense, but that would
remove from your life the bitterness and resentment with which you are
currently affected. You might think, “I will make a different plan. I
will try to want whatever it is that would make my life better—whatever
that might be—and I will start working on it now. If that turns out to
mean something other than chasing my boss’s job, I will accept that and
I will move forward.”</p>
<p>Now you’re on a whole different kind of trajectory. Before, what was
right, desirable, and worthy of pursuit was something narrow and
concrete. But you became stuck there, tightly jammed and unhappy. So you
let go. You make the necessary sacrifice, and allow a whole new world of
possibility, hidden from you because of your previous ambition, to
reveal itself. And there’s a lot there. What would your life look like,
if it were better? What would Life Itself look like? What does “better”
even mean? You don’t know. And it doesn’t matter that you don’t know,
exactly, right away, because you will start to slowly see what is
“better,” once you have truly decided to want it. You will start to
perceive what remained hidden from you by your presuppositions and
preconceptions—by the previous mechanisms of your vision. You will begin
to learn.</p>
<p>This will only work, however, if you genuinely want your life to
improve. You can’t fool your implicit perceptual structures. Not even a
bit. They aim where you point them. To retool, to take stock, to aim
somewhere better, you have to think it through, bottom to top. You have
to scour your psyche. You have to clean the damned thing up. And you
must be cautious, because making your life better means adopting a lot
of responsibility, and that takes more effort and care than living
stupidly in pain and remaining arrogant, deceitful and resentful.</p>
<p>What if it was the case that the world revealed whatever goodness it
contains in precise proportion to your desire for the best? What if the
more your conception of the best has been elevated, expanded and
rendered sophisticated the more possibility and benefit you could
perceive? This doesn’t mean that you can have what you want merely by
wishing it, or that everything is interpretation, or that there is no
reality. The world is still there, with its structures and limits. As
you move along with it, it cooperates or objects. But you can dance with
it, if your aim is to dance—and maybe you can even lead, if you have
enough skill and enough grace. This is not theology. It’s not mysticism.
It’s empirical knowledge. There is nothing magical here—or nothing more
than the already-present magic of consciousness. We only see what we aim
at. The rest of the world (and that’s most of it) is hidden. If we start
aiming at something different—something like “I want my life to be
better”—our minds will start presenting us with new information, derived
from the previously hidden world, to aid us in that pursuit. Then we can
put that information to use and move, and act, and observe, and improve.
And, after doing so, after improving, we might pursue something
different, or higher—something like, “I want whatever might be better
than just my life being better.” And then we enter a more elevated and
more complete reality.</p>
<p>In that place, what might we focus on? What might we see?</p>
<p>Think about it like this. Start from the observation that we indeed
desire things—even that we need them. That’s human nature. We share the
experience of hunger, loneliness, thirst, sexual desire, aggression,
fear and pain. Such things are elements of Being—primordial, axiomatic
elements of Being. But we must sort and organize these primordial
desires, because the world is a complex and obstinately real place. We
can’t just get the one particular thing we especially just want now,
along with everything else we usually want, because our desires can
produce conflict with our other desires, as well as with other people,
and with the world. Thus, we must become conscious of our desires, and
articulate them, and prioritize them, and arrange them into hierarchies.
That makes them sophisticated. That makes them work with each other, and
with the desires of other people, and with the world. It is in that
manner that our desires elevate themselves. It is in that manner that
they organize themselves into values and become moral. Our values, our
morality—they are indicators of our sophistication.</p>
<p>The philosophical study of morality—of right and wrong—is ethics.
Such study can render us more sophisticated in our choices. Even older
and deeper than ethics, however, is religion. Religion concerns itself
not with (mere) right and wrong but with good and evil themselves—with
the archetypes of right and wrong. Religion concerns itself with domain
of value, ultimate value. That is not the scientific domain. It’s not
the territory of empirical description. The people who wrote and edited
the Bible, for example, weren’t scientists. They couldn’t have been
scientists, even if they had wanted to be. The viewpoints, methods and
practices of science hadn’t been formulated when the Bible was
written.</p>
<p>Religion is instead about proper behaviour. It’s about what Plato
called “the Good.” A genuine religious acolyte isn’t trying to formulate
accurate ideas about the objective nature of the world (although he may
be trying to do that to). He’s striving, instead, to be a “good person.”
It may be the case that to him “good” means nothing but “obedient”—even
blindly obedient. Hence the classic liberal Western enlightenment
objection to religious belief: obedience is not enough. But it’s at
least a start (and we have forgotten this): You cannot aim yourself at
anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored. You will not
know what to target, and you won’t fly straight, even if you somehow get
your aim right. And then you will conclude, “There is nothing to aim
for.” And then you will be lost.</p>
<p>It is therefore necessary and desirable for religions to have a
dogmatic element. What good is a value system that does not provide a
stable structure? What good is a value system that does not point the
way to a higher order? And what good can you possibly be if you cannot
or do not internalize that structure, or accept that order—not as a
final destination, necessarily, but at least as a starting point?
Without that, you’re nothing but an adult two-year-old, without the
charm or the potential. That is not to say (to say it again) that
obedience is sufficient. But a person capable of obedience—let’s say,
instead, a properly disciplined person—is at least a well-forged tool.
At least that (and that is not nothing). Of course, there must be
vision, beyond discipline; beyond dogma. A tool still needs a purpose.
It is for such reasons that Christ said, in the Gospel of Thomas, “The
Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, but men do not see
it.”75</p>
<p>Does that mean that what we see is dependent on our religious
beliefs? Yes! And what we don’t see, as well! You might object, “But I’m
an atheist.” No, you’re not (and if you want to understand this, you
could read Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment, perhaps the greatest novel
ever written, in which the main character, Raskolnikov, decides to take
his atheism with true seriousness, commits what he has rationalized as a
benevolent murder, and pays the price). You’re simply not an atheist in
your actions, and it is your actions that most accurately reflect your
deepest beliefs—those that are implicit, embedded in your being,
underneath your conscious apprehensions and articulable attitudes and
surface-level self-knowledge. You can only find out what you actually
believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you
act. You simply don’t know what you believe, before that. You are too
complex to understand yourself.</p>
<p>It takes careful observation, and education, and reflection, and
communication with others, just to scratch the surface of your beliefs.
Everything you value is a product of unimaginably lengthy developmental
processes, personal, cultural and biological. You don’t understand how
what you want—and, therefore, what you see—is conditioned by the
immense, abysmal, profound past. You simply don’t understand how every
neural circuit through which you peer at the world has been shaped (and
painfully) by the ethical aims of millions of years of human ancestors
and all of the life that was lived for the billions of years before
that.</p>
<p>You don’t understand anything.</p>
<p>You didn’t even know that you were blind.</p>
<p>Some of our knowledge of our beliefs has been documented. We have
been watching ourselves act, reflecting on that watching, and telling
stories distilled through that reflection, for tens and perhaps hundreds
of thousands of years. That is all part of our attempts, individual and
collective, to discover and articulate what it is that we believe. Part
of the knowledge so generated is what is encapsulated in the fundamental
teachings of our cultures, in ancient writings such as the Tao te Ching,
or the aforementioned Vedic scriptures, or the Biblical stories. The
Bible is, for better or worse, the foundational document of Western
civilization (of Western values, Western morality, and Western
conceptions of good and evil). It’s the product of processes that remain
fundamentally beyond our comprehension. The Bible is a library composed
of many books, each written and edited by many people. It’s a truly
emergent document—a selected, sequenced and finally coherent story
written by no one and everyone over many thousands of years. The Bible
has been thrown up, out of the deep, by the collective human
imagination, which is itself a product of unimaginable forces operating
over unfathomable spans of time. Its careful, respectful study can
reveal things to us about what we believe and how we do and should act
that can be discovered in almost no other manner.</p>
<p>Old Testament God and New Testament God</p>
<p>The God of the Old Testament can appear harsh, judgmental,
unpredictable and dangerous, particularly on cursory reading. The degree
to which this is true has arguably been exaggerated by Christian
commentators, intent on magnifying the distinction between the older and
newer divisions of the Bible. There has been a price paid, however, for
such plotting (and I mean that in both senses of the word): the tendency
for modern people to think, when confronted with Jehovah, “I would never
believe in a God like that.” But Old Testament God doesn’t much care
what modern people think. He often didn’t care what Old Testament people
thought, either (although He could be bargained with, to a surprising
degree, as is particularly evident in the Abrahamic stories).
Nonetheless, when His people strayed from the path—when they disobeyed
His injunctions, violated His covenants, and broke His
commandments—trouble was certain to follow. If you did not do what Old
Testament God demanded—whatever that might have been and however you
might have tried to hide from it—you and your children and your
children’s children were in terrible, serious trouble.</p>
<p>It was realists who created, or noticed, Old Testament God. When the
denizens of those ancient societies wandered carelessly down the wrong
path, they ended up enslaved and miserable—sometimes for centuries—when
they were not obliterated completely. Was that reasonable? Was that
just? Was that fair? The authors of the Old Testament asked such
questions with extreme caution and under very limited conditions. They
assumed, instead, that the Creator of Being knew what he was doing, that
all power was essentially with Him, and that His dictates should be
carefully followed. They were wise. He was a Force of Nature. Is a
hungry lion reasonable, fair or just? What kind of nonsensical question
is that? The Old Testament Israelites and their forebears knew that God
was not to be trifled with, and that whatever Hell the angry Deity might
allow to be engendered if he was crossed was real. Having recently
passed through a century defined by the bottomless horrors of Hitler,
Stalin, and Mao, we might realize the same thing.</p>
<p>New Testament God is often presented as a different character
(although the Book of Revelation, with its Final Judgment, warns against
any excessively naïve complacency). He is more the kindly Geppetto,
master craftsman and benevolent father. He wants nothing for us but the
best. He is all-loving and all-forgiving. Sure, He’ll send you to Hell,
if you misbehave badly enough. Fundamentally, however, he’s the God of
Love. That seems more optimistic, more naively welcoming, but (in
precise proportion to that) less believable. In a world such as
this—this hothouse of doom—who could buy such a story? The all-good God,
in a post-Auschwitz world? It was for such reasons that the philosopher
Nietzsche, perhaps the most astute critic ever to confront Christianity,
considered New Testament God the worst literary crime in Western
history. In Beyond Good and Evil, he wrote:76</p>
<p>In the Jewish ‘Old Testament’, the book of divine justice, there are
men, things and speeches on such a grand style that Greek and Indian
literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and
reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and
one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula
Europe.… To have bound up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste
in every respect) along with the Old Testament into one book, as the
“Bible,” as “The Book in Itself” is perhaps the greatest audacity and
“sin against the spirit” which literary Europe has on its
conscience.</p>
<p>Who but the most naive among us could posit that such an all-good,
merciful Being ruled this so-terrible world? But something that seems
incomprehensible to someone unseeing might be perfectly evident to
someone who had opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the situation where your aim is being determined by
something petty—your aforementioned envy of your boss. Because of that
envy, the world you inhabit reveals itself as a place of bitterness,
disappointment and spite. Imagine that you come to notice, and
contemplate, and reconsider your unhappiness. Further, you determine to
accept responsibility for it, and dare to posit that it might be
something at least partly under your control. You crack open one eye,
for a moment, and look. You ask for something better. You sacrifice your
pettiness, repent of your envy, and open your heart. Instead of cursing
the darkness, you let in a little light. You decide to aim for a better
life—instead of a better office.</p>
<p>But you don’t stop there. You realize that it’s a mistake to aim for
a better life, if it comes at the cost of worsening someone else’s. So,
you get creative. You decide to play a more difficult game. You decide
that you want a better life, in a manner that will also make the life of
your family better. Or the life of your family, and your friends. Or the
life of your family, and your friends, and the strangers who surround
them. What about your enemies? Do you want to include them, too? You
bloody well don’t know how to manage that. But you’ve read some history.
You know how enmity compounds. So, you start to wish even your enemies
well, at least in principle, although you are by no means yet a master
of such sentiments.</p>
<p>And the direction of your sight changes. You see past the limitations
that hemmed you in, unknowingly. New possibilities for your life emerge,
and you work toward their realization. Your life indeed improves. And
then you start to think, further: “Better? Perhaps that means better for
me, and my family, and my friends—even for my enemies. But that’s not
all it means. It means better today, in a manner that makes everything
better tomorrow, and next week, and next year, and a decade from now,
and a hundred years from now. And a thousand years from now. And
forever.”</p>
<p>And then “better” means to aim at the Improvement of Being, with a
capital “I’ and a capital “B.” Thinking all of this—realizing all of
this—you take a risk. You decide that you will start treating Old
Testament God, with all His terrible and oft-arbitrary-seeming power, as
if He could also be New Testament God (even though you understand the
many ways in which that is absurd). In other words, you decide to act as
if existence might be justified by its goodness—if only you behaved
properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential
faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and
arrogance. It is that declaration of faith that keeps hatred of Being,
with all its attendant evils, at bay. And, as for such faith: it is not
at all the will to believe things that you know perfectly well to be
false. Faith is not the childish belief in magic. That is ignorance or
even willful blindness. It is instead the realization that the tragic
irrationalities of life must be counterbalanced by an equally irrational
commitment to the essential goodness of Being. It is simultaneously the
will to dare set your sights at the unachievable, and to sacrifice
everything, including (and most importantly) your life. You realize that
you have, literally, nothing better to do. But how can you do all
this?—assuming you are foolish enough to try.</p>
<p>You might start by not thinking—or, more accurately, but less
trenchantly, by refusing to subjugate your faith to your current
rationality, and its narrowness of view. This doesn’t mean “make
yourself stupid.” It means the opposite. It means instead that you must
quit manoeuvring and calculating and conniving and scheming and
enforcing and demanding and avoiding and ignoring and punishing. It
means you must place your old strategies aside. It means, instead, that
you must pay attention, as you may never have paid attention before.</p>
<p>Pay Attention</p>
<p>Pay attention. Focus on your surroundings, physical and
psychological. Notice something that bothers you, that concerns you,
that will not let you be, which you could fix, that you would fix. You
can find such somethings by asking yourself (as if you genuinely want to
know) three questions: “What is it that is bothering me?” “Is that
something I could fix?” and “Would I actually be willing to fix it?” If
you find that the answer is “no,” to any or all of the questions, then
look elsewhere. Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers
you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might
be enough for the day.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a stack of paper on your desk, and you have been
avoiding it. You won’t even really look at it, when you walk into your
room. There are terrible things lurking there: tax forms, and bills and
letters from people wanting things you aren’t sure you can deliver.
Notice your fear, and have some sympathy for it. Maybe there are snakes
in that pile of paper. Maybe you’ll get bitten. Maybe there are even
hydras lurking there. You’ll cut off one head, and seven more will grow.
How could you possibly cope with that?</p>
<p>You could ask yourself, “Is there anything at all that I might be
willing to do about that pile of paper? Would I look, maybe, at one part
of it? For twenty minutes?” Maybe the answer will be, “No!” But you
might look for ten, or even for five (and if not that, for one). Start
there. You will soon find that the entire pile shrinks in significance,
merely because you have looked at part of it. And you’ll find that the
whole thing is made of parts. What if you allowed yourself a glass of
wine with dinner, or curled up on the sofa and read, or watched a stupid
movie, as a reward? What if you instructed your wife, or your husband,
to say “good job” after you fixed whatever you fixed? Would that
motivate you? The people from whom thanks you want might not be very
proficient in offering it, to begin with, but that shouldn’t stop you.
People can learn, even if they are very unskilled at the beginning. Ask
yourself what you would require to be motivated to undertake the job,
honestly, and listen to the answer. Don’t tell yourself, “I shouldn’t
need to do that to motivate myself.” What do you know about yourself?
You are, on the one hand, the most complex thing in the entire universe,
and on the other, someone who can’t even set the clock on your
microwave. Don’t over-estimate your self-knowledge.</p>
<p>Let the tasks for the day announce themselves for your contemplation.
Maybe you can do this in the morning, as you sit on the edge of your
bed. Maybe you can try, the night before, when you are preparing to
sleep. Ask yourself for a voluntary contribution. If you ask nicely, and
listen carefully, and don’t try any treachery, you might be offered one.
Do this every day, for a while. Then do it for the rest of your life.
Soon you will find yourself in a different situation. Now you will be
asking yourself, habitually, “What could I do, that I would do, to make
Life a little better?” You are not dictating to yourself what “better”
must be. You are not being a totalitarian, or a utopian, even to
yourself, because you have learned from the Nazis and the Soviets and
the Maoists and from your own experience that being a totalitarian is a
bad thing. Aim high. Set your sights on the betterment of Being. Align
yourself, in your soul, with Truth and the Highest Good. There is
habitable order to establish and beauty to bring into existence. There
is evil to overcome, suffering to ameliorate, and yourself to
better.</p>
<p>It is this, in my reading, that is the culminating ethic of the canon
of the West. It is this, furthermore, that is communicated by those
eternally confusing, glowing stanzas from Christ’s Sermon on the Mount,
the essence, in some sense, of the wisdom of the New Testament. This is
the attempt of the Spirit of Mankind to transform the understanding of
ethics from the initial, necessary Thou Shalt Not of the child and the
Ten Commandments into the fully articulated, positive vision of the true
individual. This is the expression not merely of admirable self-control
and self-mastery but of the fundamental desire to set the world right.
This is not the cessation of sin, but sin’s opposite, good itself. The
Sermon on the Mount outlines the true nature of man, and the proper aim
of mankind: concentrate on the day, so that you can live in the present,
and attend completely and properly to what is right in front of you—but
do that only after you have decided to let what is within shine forth,
so that it can justify Being and illuminate the world. Do that only
after you have determined to sacrifice whatever it is that must be
sacrificed so that you can pursue the highest good.</p>
<p>Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin:</p>
<p>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you,
O ye of little faith?</p>
<p>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall
we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
<p>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly
Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
<p>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof. (Luke 12: 22–34)</p>
<p>Realization is dawning. Instead of playing the tyrant, therefore, you
are paying attention. You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating
the world. You are negotiating, instead of playing the martyr or the
tyrant. You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know
that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be
frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient. You
are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing
to do. You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems
have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less
concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to
do yourself.</p>
<p>Attend to the day, but aim at the highest good.</p>
<p>Now, your trajectory is heavenward. That makes you hopeful. Even a
man on a sinking ship can be happy when he clambers aboard a lifeboat!
And who knows where he might go, in the future. To journey happily may
well be better than to arrive successfully.…</p>
<p>Ask, and ye shall receive. Knock, and the door will open. If you ask,
as if you want, and knock, as if you want to enter, you may be offered
the chance to improve your life, a little; a lot; completely—and with
that improvement, some progress will be made in Being itself.</p>
<p>Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else
is today.</p>
