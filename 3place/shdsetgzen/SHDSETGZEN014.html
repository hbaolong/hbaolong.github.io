<p>DO NOT BOTHER CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE SKATEBOARDING</p>
<p>DANGER AND MASTERY</p>
<p>There was a time when kids skateboarded on the west side of Sidney
Smith Hall, at the University of Toronto, where I work. Sometimes I
stood there and watched them. There are rough, wide, shallow concrete
steps there, leading up from the street to the front entrance,
accompanied by tubular iron handrails, about two and a half inches in
diameter and twenty feet long. The crazy kids, almost always boys, would
pull back about fifteen yards from the top of the steps. Then they would
place a foot on their boards, and skate like mad to get up some speed.
Just before they collided with the handrail, they would reach down, grab
their board with a single hand and jump onto the top of the rail,
boardsliding their way down its length, propelling themselves off and
landing—sometimes, gracefully, still atop their boards, sometimes,
painfully, off them. Either way, they were soon back at it.</p>
<p>Some might call that stupid. Maybe it was. But it was brave, too. I
thought those kids were amazing. I thought they deserved a pat on the
back and some honest admiration. Of course it was dangerous. Danger was
the point. They wanted to triumph over danger. They would have been
safer in protective equipment, but that would have ruined it. They
weren’t trying to be safe. They were trying to become competent—and it’s
competence that makes people as safe as they can truly be.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t dare do what those kids were doing. Not only that, I
couldn’t. I certainly couldn’t climb a construction crane, like a
certain type of modern daredevil, evident on YouTube (and, of course,
people who work on construction cranes). I don’t like heights, although
the twenty-five thousand feet to which airliners ascend is so high that
it doesn’t bother me. I have flown several times in a carbon fibre stunt
plane—even doing a hammerhead roll—and that was OK, although it’s very
physically and mentally demanding. (To perform a hammerhead roll, you
pilot the plane straight up vertically, until the force of gravity makes
it stall. Then it falls backwards, corkscrewing, until eventually it
flips and noses straight down, after which you pull out of the dive. Or
you don’t do another hammerhead roll.) But I can’t skateboard—especially
down handrails—and I can’t climb cranes.</p>
<p>Sidney Smith Hall faces another street on the east side. Along that
street, named St. George—ironically enough—the university installed a
series of rough, hard-edged, concrete plant boxes, sloping down to the
roadway. The kids used to go out there, too, and boardslide along the
box edges, as they did along the concrete surround of a sculpture
adjacent to the building. That didn’t last very long. Little steel
brackets known as “skatestoppers” soon appeared, every two or three
feet, along those edges. When I first saw them, I remembered something
that happened in Toronto several years previously. Two weeks before
elementary school classes started, throughout the city, all the
playground equipment disappeared. The legislation governing such things
had changed, and there was a panic about insurability. The playgrounds
were hastily removed, even though they were sufficiently safe,
grandfathered re their insurability, and often paid for (and quite
recently) by parents. This meant no playgrounds at all for more than a
year. During this time, I often saw bored but admirable kids charging
around on the roof of our local school. It was that or scrounge about in
the dirt with the cats and the less adventurous children.</p>
<p>I say “sufficiently safe” about the demolished playgrounds because
when playgrounds are made too safe, kids either stop playing in them or
start playing in unintended ways. Kids need playgrounds dangerous enough
to remain challenging. People, including children (who are people too,
after all) don’t seek to minimize risk. They seek to optimize it. They
drive and walk and love and play so that they achieve what they desire,
but they push themselves a bit at the same time, too, so they continue
to develop. Thus, if things are made too safe, people (including
children) start to figure out ways to make them dangerous again.165</p>
<p>When untrammeled—and encouraged—we prefer to live on the edge. There,
we can still be both confident in our experience and confronting the
chaos that helps us develop. We’re hard-wired, for that reason, to enjoy
risk (some of us more than others). We feel invigorated and excited when
we work to optimize our future performance, while playing in the
present. Otherwise we lumber around, sloth-like, unconscious, unformed
and careless. Overprotected, we will fail when something dangerous,
unexpected and full of opportunity suddenly makes its appearance, as it
inevitably will.</p>
<p>The skatestoppers are unattractive. The surround of the nearby
sculpture would have to have been badly damaged by diligent boardsliders
before it would look as mean as it does now, studded with metal like a
pit bull’s collar. The large plant boxes have metal guards placed at
irregular intervals across their tops, and this, in addition to the wear
caused by the skateboarders, produces a dismal impression of poor
design, resentment and badly executed afterthoughts. It gives the area,
which was supposed to be beautified by the sculpture and vegetation, a
generic industrial/prison/mental institution/work-camp look of the kind
that appears when builders and public officials do not like or trust the
people they serve.</p>
<p>The sheer harsh ugliness of the solution makes a lie of the reasons
for its implementation.</p>
<p>Success and Resentment</p>
<p>If you read the depth psychologists—Freud and Jung, for example, as
well as their precursor, Friedrich Nietzsche—you learn that there is a
dark side to everything. Freud delved deeply into the latent, implicit
content of dreams, which were often aimed, in his opinion, at the
expression of some improper wish. Jung believed that every act of social
propriety was accompanied by its evil twin, its unconscious shadow.
Nietzsche investigated the role played by what he termed ressentiment in
motivating what were ostensibly selfless actions—and, often, exhibited
all too publicly.166</p>
<p>For that man be delivered from revenge—that is for me the bridge to
the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms. The tarantulas, of
course, would have it otherwise. “What justice means to us is precisely
that the world be filled with the storms of our revenge”—thus they speak
to each other. “We shall wreak vengeange and abuse on all whose equals
we are not”—thus do the tarantula-hearts vow. “And ‘will to equality’
shall henceforth be the name for virtue; and against all that has power
we want to raise our clamor!” You preachers of equality, the
tyrant-mania of impotence clamors thus out of you for equality: your
most secret ambitions to be tyrants thus shroud themselves in words of
virtue.</p>
<p>The incomparable English essayist George Orwell knew this sort of
thing well. In 1937, he wrote The Road to Wigan Pier, which was in part
a scathing attack on upper-class British socialists (this, despite being
inclined towards socialism himself). In the first half of this book,
Orwell portrays the appalling conditions faced by UK miners in the
1930s:167</p>
<p>Several dentists have told me that in industrial districts a person
over thirty with any of his or her own teeth is coming to be an
abnormality. In Wigan various people gave me their opinion that it is
best to get shut of your teeth as early in life as possible. ‘Teeth is
just a misery,’ one woman said to me.</p>
<p>A Wigan Pier coal miner had to walk—crawl would be a better word,
given the height of the mine shafts—up to three miles, underground, in
the dark, banging his head and scraping his back, just to get to his
seven-and-a-half-hour shift of backbreaking work. After that, he crawled
back. “It is comparable, perhaps, to climbing a smallish mountain before
and after your day’s work,” stated Orwell. None of the time spent
crawling was paid.</p>
<p>Orwell wrote The Road to Wigan Pier for the Left Book Club, a
socialist publishing group that released a select volume every month.
After reading the first half of his book, which deals directly with the
miners’ personal circumstances, it is impossible not to feel sympathy
for the working poor. Only a monster could keep his heart hardened
through the accounts of the lives Orwell describes:</p>
<p>It is not long since conditions in the mines were worse than they are
now. There are still living a few very old women who in their youth have
worked underground, crawling on all fours and dragging tubs of coal.
They used to go on doing this even when they were pregnant.</p>
<p>In book’s second half, however, Orwell turned his gaze to a different
problem: the comparative unpopularity of socialism in the UK at the
time, despite the clear and painful inequity observable everywhere. He
concluded that the tweed-wearing, armchair-philosophizing,
victim-identifying, pity-and-contempt-dispensing social-reformer types
frequently did not like the poor, as they claimed. Instead, they just
hated the rich. They disguised their resentment and jealousy with piety,
sanctimony and self-righteousness. Things in the unconscious—or on the
social justice–dispensing leftist front—haven’t changed much, today. It
is because of of Freud, Jung, Nietzsche—and Orwell—that I always wonder,
“What, then, do you stand against?” whenever I hear someone say, too
loudly, “I stand for this!” The question seems particularly relevant if
the same someone is complaining, criticizing, or trying to change
someone else’s behaviour.</p>
<p>I believe it was Jung who developed the most surgically wicked of
psychoanalytic dicta: if you cannot understand why someone did
something, look at the consequences—and infer the motivation. This is a
psychological scalpel. It’s not always a suitable instrument. It can cut
too deeply, or in the wrong places. It is, perhaps, a last-resort
option. Nonetheless, there are times when its application proves
enlightening.</p>
<p>If the consequences of placing skatestoppers on plant-boxes and
sculpture bases, for example, is unhappy adolescent males and brutalist
aesthetic disregard of beauty then, perhaps, that was the aim. When
someone claims to be acting from the highest principles, for the good of
others, there is no reason to assume that the person’s motives are
genuine. People motivated to make things better usually aren’t concerned
with changing other people—or, if they are, they take responsibility for
making the same changes to themselves (and first). Beneath the
production of rules stopping the skateboarders from doing highly
skilled, courageous and dangerous things I see the operation of an
insidious and profoundly anti-human spirit.</p>
<p>More about Chris</p>
<p>My friend Chris, whom I wrote about earlier, was possessed by such a
spirit—to the serious detriment of his mental health. Part of what
plagued him was guilt. He attended elementary and junior high school in
a number of towns, up in the frigid expanses of the northernmost Alberta
prairie, prior to ending up in the Fairview I wrote about earlier.
Fights with Native kids were a too-common part of his experience, during
those moves. It’s no overstatement to point out that such kids were, on
average, rougher than the white kids, or that they were touchier (and
they had their reasons). I knew this well from my own experience.</p>
<p>I had a rocky friendship with a Métis kid, Rene Heck,fn1 when I was
in elementary school. It was rocky because the situation was complex.
There was a large cultural divide between Rene and me. His clothes were
dirtier. He was rougher in speech and attitude. I had skipped a grade in
school, and was, in addition, small for my age. Rene was a big, smart,
good-looking kid, and he was tough. We were in grade six together, in a
class taught by my father. Rene was caught chewing gum. “Rene,” said my
father, “spit that gum out. You look like a cow.” “Ha, ha,” I laughed,
under my breath. “Rene the cow.” Rene might have been a cow, but there
was nothing wrong with his hearing. “Peterson,” he said, “after
school—you’re dead.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning, Rene and I had arranged to see a movie that
night at the local movie theatre, the Gem. It looked like that was off.
In any case, the rest of the day passed, quickly and unpleasantly, as it
does when threat and pain lurk. Rene was more than capable of giving me
a good pounding. After school, I took off for the bike stands outside
the school as fast as I could, but Rene beat me there. We circled around
the bikes, him on one side, me on the other. We were characters in a
“Keystone Cops” short. As long as I kept circling, he couldn’t catch me,
but my strategy couldn’t work forever. I yelled out that I was sorry,
but he wasn’t mollified. His pride was hurt, and he wanted me to
pay.</p>
<p>I crouched down and hid behind some bikes, keeping an eye on Rene.
“Rene,” I yelled, “I’m sorry I called you a cow. Let’s quit fighting.”
He started to approach me again. I said, “Rene, I am sorry I said that.
Really. And I still want to go to the movie with you.” This wasn’t just
a tactic. I meant it. Otherwise what happened next would not have
happened. Rene stopped circling. Then he stared at me. Then he broke
into tears. Then he ran off. That was Native-white relationships in a
nutshell, in our hard little town. We never did go to a movie
together.</p>
<p>When my friend Chris got into it with Native kids, he wouldn’t fight
back. He didn’t feel that his self-defence was morally justified, so he
took his beatings. “We took their land,” he later wrote. “That was
wrong. No wonder they’re angry.” Over time, step by step, Chris withdrew
from the world. It was partly his guilt. He developed a deep hatred for
masculinity and masculine activity. He saw going to school or working or
finding a girlfriend as part of the same process that had led to the
colonization of North America, the horrible nuclear stalemate of the
cold war, and the despoiling of the planet. He had read some books about
Buddhism, and felt that negation of his own Being was ethically
required, in the light of the current world situation. He came to
believe that the same applied to others.</p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate, Chris was, for a while, one of my
roommates. One late night we went to a local bar. We walked home,
afterward. He started to snap the side-view mirrors off parked cars, one
after the other. I said, “Quit that, Chris. What possible good is it
going to do to make the people who own these cars miserable?” He told me
that they were all part of the frenetic human activity that was ruining
everything, and that they deserved whatever they got. I said that taking
revenge on people who were just living normal lives was not going to
help anything.</p>
<p>Years later, when I was in graduate school in Montreal, Chris showed
up, for what was supposed to be a visit. He was aimless, however, and
lost. He asked if I could help. He ended up moving in. I was married by
then, living with my wife, Tammy, and our year-old daughter, Mikhaila.
Chris had also been friends with Tammy back in Fairview (and held out
hopes of more than friendship). That complicated the situation even
more—but not precisely in the manner you might think. Chris started by
hating men, but he ended by hating women. He wanted them, but he had
rejected education, and career, and desire. He smoked heavily, and was
unemployed. Unsurprisingly, therefore, he was not of much interest to
women. That made him bitter. I tried to convince him that the path he
had chosen was only going to lead to further ruin. He needed to develop
some humility. He needed to get a life.</p>
<p>One evening, it was Chris’s turn to make dinner. When my wife came
home, the apartment was filled with smoke. Hamburgers were burning
furiously in the frying pan. Chris was on his hands and knees,
attempting to repair something that had come loose on the legs of the
stove. My wife knew his tricks. She knew he was burning dinner on
purpose. He resented having to make it. He resented the feminine role
(even though the household duties were split in a reasonable manner;
even though he knew that perfectly well). He was fixing the stove to
provide a plausible, even creditable excuse for burning the food. When
she pointed out what he was doing, he played the victim, but he was
deeply and dangerously furious. Part of him, and not the good part, was
convinced that he was smarter than anyone else. It was a blow to his
pride that she could see through his tricks. It was an ugly
situation.</p>
<p>Tammy and I took a walk up towards a local park the next day. We
needed to get away from the apartment, although it was thirty-five
below—bitterly, frigidly cold, humid and foggy. It was windy. It was
hostile to life. Living with Chris was too much, Tammy said. We entered
the park. The trees forked their bare branches upward through the damp
grey air. A black squirrel, tail hairless from mange, gripped a leafless
branch, shivered violently, struggling to hold on against the wind. What
was it doing out there in the cold? Squirrels are partial hibernators.
They only come out in the winter when it’s warm. Then we saw another,
and another, and another, and another, and another. There were squirrels
all around us in the park, all partially hairless, tails and bodies
alike, all windblown on their branches, all shaking and freezing in the
deathly cold. No one else was around. It was impossible. It was
inexplicable. It was exactly appropriate. We were on the stage of an
absurdist play. It was directed by God. Tammy left soon after with our
daughter for a few days elsewhere.</p>
<p>Near Christmas time, that same year, my younger brother and his new
wife came out to visit from western Canada. My brother also knew Chris.
They all put on their winter clothes in preparation for a walk around
downtown Montreal. Chris put on a long dark winter coat. He pulled a
black toque, a brimless knitted cap, far down over his head. His coat
was black, as were his pants and boots. He was very tall, and thin, and
somewhat stooped. “Chris,” I joked. “You look like a serial killer.” Ha
bloody ha. The three came back from their walk. Chris was out of sorts.
There were strangers in his territory. Another happy couple. It was salt
in his wounds.</p>
<p>We had dinner, pleasantly enough. We talked, and ended the evening.
But I couldn’t sleep. Something wasn’t right. It was in the air. At four
in the morning, I had had enough. I crawled out of bed. I knocked
quietly on Chris’s door and went without waiting for an answer into his
room. He was awake on the bed, staring at the ceiling, as I knew he
would be. I sat down beside him. I knew him very well. I talked him down
from his murderous rage. Then I went back to bed, and slept. The next
morning my brother pulled me aside. He wanted to speak with me. We sat
down. He said, “What the hell was going on last night? I couldn’t sleep
at all. Was something wrong?” I told my brother that Chris wasn’t doing
so well. I didn’t tell him that he was lucky to be alive—that we all
were. The spirit of Cain had visited our house, but we were left
unscathed.</p>
<p>Maybe I picked up some change in scent that night, when death hung in
the air. Chris had a very bitter odour. He showered frequently, but the
towels and the sheets picked up the smell. It was impossible to get them
clean. It was the product of a psyche and a body that did not operate
harmoniously. A social worker I knew, who also knew Chris, told me of
her familiarity with that odour. Everyone at her workplace knew of it,
although they only discussed it in hushed tones. They called it the
smell of the unemployable.</p>
<p>Soon after this I finished my post-doctoral studies. Tammy and I
moved away from Montreal to Boston. We had our second baby. Now and
then, Chris and I talked on the phone. He came to visit once. It went
well. He had found a job at an auto-parts place. He was trying to make
things better. He was OK at that point. But it didn’t last. I didn’t see
him in Boston again. Almost ten years later—the night before Chris’s
fortieth birthday, as it happened—he called me again. By this time, I
had moved my family to Toronto. He had some news. A story he had written
was going to be published in a collection put together by a small but
legitimate press. He wanted to tell me that. He wrote good short
stories. I had read them all. We had discussed them at length. He was a
good photographer, too. He had a good, creative eye. The next day, Chris
drove his old pickup—the same battered beast from Fairview—into the
bush. He ran a hose from the exhaust pipe into the front cab. I can see
him there, looking through the cracked windshield, smoking, waiting.
They found his body a few weeks later. I called his dad. “My beautiful
boy,” he sobbed.</p>
<p>Recently, I was invited to give a TEDx talk at a nearby university.
Another professor talked first. He had been invited to speak because of
his work—his genuinely fascinating, technical work—with computationally
intelligent surfaces (like computer touchscreens, but capable of being
placed everywhere). He spoke instead about the threat human beings posed
to the survival of the planet. Like Chris—like far too many people—he
had become anti-human, to the core. He had not walked as far down that
road as my friend, but the same dread spirit animated them both.</p>
<p>He stood in front of a screen displaying an endless slow pan of a
blocks-long Chinese high-tech factory. Hundreds of white-suited workers
stood like sterile, inhuman robots behind their assembly lines,
soundlessly inserting piece A into slot B. He told the audience—filled
with bright young people—of the decision he and his wife had made to
limit their number of children to one. He told them it was something
they should all consider, if they wanted to regard themselves as ethical
people. I felt that such a decision was properly considered—but only in
his particular case (where less than one might have been even better).
The many Chinese students in attendance sat stolidly through his
moralizing. They thought, perhaps, of their parents’ escape from the
horrors of Mao’s Cultural Revolution and its one-child policy. They
thought, perhaps, of the vast improvement in living standard and freedom
provided by the very same factories. A couple of them said as much in
the question period that followed.</p>
<p>Would have the professor reconsidered his opinions, if he knew where
such ideas can lead? I would like to say yes, but I don’t believe it. I
think he could have known, but refused to. Worse, perhaps: he knew, but
didn’t care—or knew, and was headed there, voluntarily, in any case.</p>
<p>Self-Appointed Judges of the Human Race</p>
<p>It has not been long since the Earth seemed infinitely larger than
the people who inhabited it. It was only in the late 1800s that the
brilliant biologist Thomas Huxley (1825-95)—staunch defender of Darwin
and Aldous Huxley’s grandfather—told the British Parliament that it was
literally impossible for mankind to exhaust the oceans. Their power of
generation was simply too great, as far as he could determine, compared
to even the most assiduous human predations. It’s been an even shorter
fifty years since Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring ignited the
environmental movement.168 Fifty years! That’s nothing! That’s not even
yesterday.</p>
<p>We’ve only just developed the conceptual tools and technologies that
allow us to understand the web of life, however imperfectly. We deserve
a bit of sympathy, in consequence, for the hypothetical outrage of our
destructive behaviour. Sometimes we don’t know any better. Sometimes we
do know better, but haven’t yet formulated any practical alternatives.
It’s not as if life is easy for human beings, after all, even now—and
it’s only a few decades ago that the majority of human beings were
starving, diseased and illiterate.169 Wealthy as we are (increasingly,
everywhere) we still only live decades that can be counted on our
fingers. Even at present, it is the rare and fortunate family that does
not contain at least one member with a serious illness—and all will face
that problem eventually. We do what we can to make the best of things,
in our vulnerability and fragility, and the planet is harder on us than
we are on it. We could cut ourselves some slack.</p>
<p>Human beings are, after all, seriously remarkable creatures. We have
no peers, and it’s not clear that we have any real limits. Things happen
now that appeared humanly impossible even at the same time in the recent
past when we began to wake up to our planet-sized responsibilities. A
few weeks before writing this I happened across two videos juxtaposed on
YouTube. One showed the Olympic gold medal vault from 1956; the other,
the Olympic silver medal vault from 2012. It didn’t even look like the
same sport—or the same animal. What McKayla Maroney did in 2012 would
have been considered superhuman in the fifties. Parkour, a sport derived
from French military obstacle course training, is amazing, as is free
running. I watch compilations of such performances with unabashed
admiration. Some of the kids jump off three-storey buildings without
injury. It’s dangerous—and amazing. Crane climbers are so brave it
rattles the mind. The same goes for extreme mountain bikers, freestyle
snowboarders, surfers of fifty-foot waves, and skateboarders.</p>
<p>The boys who shot up Columbine High School, whom we discussed
earlier, had appointed themselves judges of the human race—like the TEDx
professor, although much more extreme; like Chris, my doomed friend. For
Eric Harris, the more literate of the two killers, human beings were a
failed and corrupt species. Once a presupposition such as that is
accepted, its inner logic will inevitably manifest itself. If something
is a plague, as David Attenborough has it,170 or a cancer, as the Club
of Rome claimed,171 the person who eradicates it is a hero—a veritable
planetary saviour, in this case. A real messiah might follow through
with his rigorous moral logic, and eliminate himself, as well. This is
what mass murderers, driven by near-infinite resentment, typically do.
Even their own Being does not justify the existence of humanity. In
fact, they kill themselves precisely to demonstrate the purity of their
commitment to annihilation. No one in the modern world may without
objection express the opinion that existence would be bettered by the
absence of Jews, blacks, Muslims, or Englishmen. Why, then, is it
virtuous to propose that the planet might be better off, if there were
fewer people on it? I can’t help but see a skeletal, grinning face,
gleeful at the possibility of the apocalypse, hiding not so very far
behind such statements. And why does it so often seem to be the very
people standing so visibly against prejudice who so often appear to feel
obligated to denounce humanity itself?</p>
<p>I have seen university students, particularly those in the
humanities, suffer genuine declines in their mental health from being
philosophically berated by such defenders of the planet for their
existence as members of the human species. It’s worse, I think, for
young men. As privileged beneficiaries of the patriarchy, their
accomplishments are considered unearned. As possible adherents of rape
culture, they’re sexually suspect. Their ambitions make them plunderers
of the planet. They’re not welcome. At the junior high, high school and
university level, they’re falling behind educationally. When my son was
fourteen, we discussed his grades. He was doing very well, he said,
matter-of-factly, for a boy. I inquired further. Everyone knew, he said,
that girls do better in school than boys. His intonation indicated
surprise at my ignorance of something so self-evident. While writing
this, I received the latest edition of The Economist. The cover story?
“The Weaker Sex”—meaning males. In modern universities women now make up
more than 50 percent of the students in more than two-thirds of all
disciplines.</p>
<p>Boys are suffering, in the modern world. They are more
disobedient—negatively—or more independent—positively—than girls, and
they suffer for this, throughout their pre-university educational
career. They are less agreeable (agreeableness being a personality trait
associated with compassion, empathy and avoidance of conflict) and less
susceptible to anxiety and depression,172 at least after both sexes hit
puberty.173 Boys’ interests tilt towards things; girls’ interests tilt
towards people.174 Strikingly, these differences, strongly influenced by
biological factors, are most pronounced in the Scandinavian societies
where gender-equality has been pushed hardest: this is the opposite of
what would be expected by those who insist, ever more loudly, that
gender is a social construct. It isn’t. This isn’t a debate. The data
are in.175</p>
<p>Boys like competition, and they don’t like to obey, particularly when
they are adolescents. During that time, they are driven to escape their
families, and establish their own independent existence. There is little
difference between doing that and challenging authority. Schools, which
were set up in the late 1800s precisely to inculcate obedience,176 do
not take kindly to provocative and daring behaviour, no matter how
tough-minded and competent it might show a boy (or a girl) to be. Other
factors play their role in the decline of boys. Girls will, for example,
play boys’ games, but boys are much more reluctant to play girls’ games.
This is in part because it is admirable for a girl to win when competing
with a boy. It is also OK for her to lose to a boy. For a boy to beat a
girl, however, it is often not OK—and just as often, it is even less OK
for him to lose. Imagine that a boy and a girl, aged nine, get into a
fight. Just for engaging, the boy is highly suspect. If he wins, he’s
pathetic. If he loses—well, his life might as well be over. Beat up by a
girl.</p>
<p>Girls can win by winning in their own hierarchy—by being good at what
girls value, as girls. They can add to this victory by winning in the
boys’ hierarchy. Boys, however, can only win by winning in the male
hierarchy. They will lose status, among girls and boys, by being good at
what girls value. It costs them in reputation among the boys, and in
attractiveness among the girls. Girls aren’t attracted to boys who are
their friends, even though they might like them, whatever that means.
They are attracted to boys who win status contests with other boys. If
you’re male, however, you just can’t hammer a female as hard as you
would a male. Boys can’t (won’t) play truly competitive games with
girls. It isn’t clear how they can win. As the game turns into a girls’
game, therefore, the boys leave. Are the universities—particularly the
humanities—about to become a girls’ game? Is this what we want?</p>
<p>The situation in the universities (and in educational institutions in
general) is far more problematic than the basic statistics indicate.177
If you eliminate the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering
and mathematics) programs (excluding psychology), the female/male ratio
is even more skewed.178 Almost 80 percent of students majoring in the
fields of healthcare, public administration, psychology and education,
which comprise one-quarter of all degrees, are female. The disparity is
still rapidly increasing. At this rate, there will be very few men in
most university disciplines in fifteen years. This is not good news for
men. It might even be catastrophic news for men. But it’s also not good
news for women.</p>
<p>Career and Marriage</p>
<p>The women at female-dominated institutes of higher education are
finding it increasingly difficult to arrange a dating relationship of
even moderate duration. In consequence, they must settle, if inclined,
for a hook-up, or sequential hook-ups. Perhaps this is a move forward,
in terms of sexual liberation, but I doubt it. I think it’s terrible for
the girls.179 A stable, loving relationship is highly desirable, for men
as well as women. For women, however, it is often what is most wanted.
From 1997 to 2012, according to the Pew Research Centre,180 the number
of women aged 18 to 34 who said that a successful marriage is one of the
most important things in life rose from 28 to 37 percent (an increase of
more than 30 percentfn2). The number of young men who said the same
thing declined 15 percent over the same period (from 35 to 29
percentfn3). During that time, the proportion of married people over 18
continued to decline, down from three-quarters in 1960 to half now.181
Finally, among never-married adults aged 30 to 59, men are three times
as likely as women to say they do not ever want to marry (27 vs 8
percent).</p>
<p>Who decided, anyway, that career is more important than love and
family? Is working eighty hours a week at a high-end law firm truly
worth the sacrifices required for that kind of success? And if it is
worth it, why is it worth it? A minority of people (mostly men, who
score low in the trait of agreeableness, again) are hyper-competitive,
and want to win at any cost. A minority will find the work intrinsically
fascinating. But most aren’t, and most won’t, and money doesn’t seem to
improve people’s lives, once they have enough to avoid the bill
collectors. Furthermore, most high-performing and high-earning females
have high-performing and high-earning partners—and that matters more to
women. The Pew data also indicate that a spouse with a desirable job is
a high priority for almost 80 percent of never-married but
marriage-seeking women (but for less than 50 percent of men).</p>
<p>When they hit their thirties, most of the top-rate female lawyers
bail out of their high-pressure careers.182 Only 15 percent of equity
partners at the two hundred biggest US law firms are women.183 This
figure hasn’t changed much in the last fifteen years, even though female
associates and staff attorneys are plentiful. It also isn’t because the
law firms don’t want the women to stay around and succeed. There is a
chronic shortage of excellent people, regardless of sex, and law firms
are desperate to retain them.</p>
<p>The women who leave want a job—and a life—that allows them some time.
After law school and articling and the few first years of work, they
develop other interests. This is common knowledge in the big firms
(although it is not something that people are comfortable articulating
in public, men and women alike). I recently watched a McGill University
professor, female, lecture a room full of female law partners or
near-partners about how lack of childcare facilities and “male
definitions of success” impeded their career progress and caused women
to leave. I knew most of the women in the room. We had talked at great
length. I knew they knew that none of this was at all the problem. They
had nannies, and they could afford them. They had already outsourced all
their domestic obligations and necessities. They understood, as well—and
perfectly well—that it was the market that defined success, not the men
they worked with. If you are earning 50 an hour in Toronto as a top
lawyer, and your client in Japan phones you at 4 a.m. on a Sunday, you
answer. Now. You answer, now, even if you have just gone back to sleep
after feeding the baby. You answer because some hyper-ambitious legal
associate in New York would be happy to answer, if you don’t—and that’s
why the market defines the work.</p>
<p>The increasingly short supply of university-educated men poses a
problem of increasing severity for women who want to marry, as well as
date. First, women have a strong proclivity to marry across or up the
economic dominance hierarchy. They prefer a partner of equal or greater
status. This holds true cross-culturally.184 The same does not hold, by
the way, for men, who are perfectly willing to marry across or down (as
the Pew data indicate), although they show a preference for somewhat
younger mates. The recent trend towards the hollowing-out of the middle
class has also been increasing as resource-rich women tend more and
more185 to partner with resource-rich men. Because of this, and because
of the decline in high-paying manufacturing jobs for men (one of six men
of employable age is currently without work in the US), marriage is now
something increasingly reserved for the rich. I can’t help finding that
amusing, in a blackly ironic manner. The oppressive patriarchal
institution of marriage has now become a luxury. Why would the rich
tyrannize themselves?</p>
<p>Why do women want an employed partner and, preferably, one of higher
status? In no small part, it’s because women become more vulnerable when
they have children. They need someone competent to support mother and
child when that becomes necessary. It’s a perfectly rational
compensatory act, although it may also have a biological basis. Why
would a woman who decides to take responsibility for one or more infants
want an adult to look after as well? So, the unemployed working man is
an undesirable specimen—and single motherhood an undesirable
alternative. Children in father-absent homes are four times as likely to
be poor. That means their mothers are poor too. Fatherless children are
at much greater risk for drug and alcohol abuse. Children living with
married biological parents are less anxious, depressed and delinquent
than children living with one or more non-biological parent. Children in
single-parent families are also twice as likely to commit
suicide.186</p>
<p>The strong turn towards political correctness in universities has
exacerbated the problem. The voices shouting against oppression have
become louder, it seems, in precise proportion to how equal—even now
increasingly skewed against men—the schools have become. There are whole
disciplines in universities forthrightly hostile towards men. These are
the areas of study, dominated by the postmodern/neo-Marxist claim that
Western culture, in particular, is an oppressive structure, created by
white men to dominate and exclude women (and other select groups);
successful only because of that domination and exclusion.187</p>
<p>The Patriarchy: Help or Hindrance?</p>
<p>Of course, culture is an oppressive structure. It’s always been that
way. It’s a fundamental, universal existential reality. The tyrannical
king is a symbolic truth; an archetypal constant. What we inherit from
the past is willfully blind, and out of date. It’s a ghost, a machine,
and a monster. It must be rescued, repaired and kept at bay by the
attention and effort of the living. It crushes, as it hammers us into
socially acceptable shape, and it wastes great potential. But it offers
great gain, too. Every word we speak is a gift from our ancestors. Every
thought we think was thought previously by someone smarter. The highly
functional infrastructure that surrounds us, particularly in the West,
is a gift from our ancestors: the comparatively uncorrupt political and
economic systems, the technology, the wealth, the lifespan, the freedom,
the luxury, and the opportunity. Culture takes with one hand, but in
some fortunate places it gives more with the other. To think about
culture only as oppressive is ignorant and ungrateful, as well as
dangerous. This is not to say (as I am hoping the content of this book
has made abundantly clear, so far) that culture should not be subject to
criticism.</p>
<p>Consider this, as well, in regard to oppression: any hierarchy
creates winners and losers. The winners are, of course, more likely to
justify the hierarchy and the losers to criticize it. But (1) the
collective pursuit of any valued goal produces a hierarchy (as some will
be better and some worse at that pursuit not matter what it is) and (2)
it is the pursuit of goals that in large part lends life its sustaining
meaning. We experience almost all the emotions that make life deep and
engaging as a consequence of moving successfully towards something
deeply desired and valued. The price we pay for that involvement is the
inevitable creation of hierarchies of success, while the inevitable
consequence is difference in outcome. Absolute equality would therefore
require the sacrifice of value itself—and then there would be nothing
worth living for. We might instead note with gratitude that a complex,
sophisticated culture allows for many games and many successful players,
and that a well-structured culture allows the individuals that compose
it to play and to win, in many different fashions.</p>
<p>It is also perverse to consider culture the creation of men. Culture
is symbolically, archetypally, mythically male. That’s partly why the
idea of “the patriarchy” is so easily swallowed. But it is certainly the
creation of humankind, not the creation of men (let alone white men, who
nonetheless contributed their fair share). European culture has only
been dominant, to the degree that it is dominant at all, for about four
hundred years. On the time scale of cultural evolution—which is to be
measured, at minimum, in thousands of years—such a timespan barely
registers. Furthermore, even if women contributed nothing substantial to
art, literature and the sciences prior to the 1960s and the feminist
revolution (which is not something I believe), then the role they played
raising children and working on the farms was still instrumental in
raising boys and freeing up men—a very few men—so that humanity could
propagate itself and strive forward.</p>
<p>Here’s an alternative theory: throughout history, men and women both
struggled terribly for freedom from the overwhelming horrors of
privation and necessity. Women were often at a disadvantage during that
struggle, as they had all the vulnerabilities of men, with the extra
reproductive burden, and less physical strength. In addition to the
filth, misery, disease, starvation, cruelty and ignorance that
characterized the lives of both sexes, back before the twentieth century
(when even people in the Western world typically existed on less than a
dollar a day in today’s money) women also had to put up with the serious
practical inconvenience of menstruation, the high probability of
unwanted pregnancy, the chance of death or serious damage during
childbirth, and the burden of too many young children. Perhaps that is
sufficient reason for the different legal and practical treatment of men
and women that characterized most societies prior to the recent
technological revolutions, including the invention of the birth control
pill. At least such things might be taken into account, before the
assumption that men tyrannized women is accepted as a truism.</p>
<p>It looks to me like the so-called oppression of the patriarchy was
instead an imperfect collective attempt by men and women, stretching
over millennia, to free each other from privation, disease and drudgery.
The recent case of Arunachalam Muruganantham provides a salutary
example. This man, the “tampon king” of India, became unhappy because
his wife had to use dirty rags during her menstrual period. She told him
it was either expensive sanitary napkins, or milk for the family. He
spent the next fourteen years in a state of insanity, by his neighbours’
judgment, trying to rectify the problem. Even his wife and his mother
abandoned him, briefly, terrified as they became of his obsession. When
he ran out of female volunteers to test his product, he took to wearing
a bladder of pig’s blood as a replacement. I can’t see how this
behaviour would have improved his popularity or status. Now his low-cost
and locally made napkins are distributed across India, manufactured by
women-run self-help groups. His users have been provided with freedom
they never previously experienced. In 2014, this high-school dropout was
named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world. I
am unwilling to consider personal gain Muruganantham’s primary
motivation. Is he part of the patriarchy?</p>
<p>In 1847, James Young Simpson used ether to help a woman who had a
deformed pelvis give birth. Afterwards, he switched to the
better-performing chloroform. The first baby delivered under its
influence was named “Anaesthesia.” By 1853, chloroform was esteemed
enough to be used by Queen Victoria, who delivered her seventh baby
under its influence. Remarkably soon afterward, the option of painless
childbirth was available everywhere. A few people warned of the danger
of opposing God’s pronouncement to women in Genesis 3:16: “I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt
bring forth children …” Some also opposed its use among males: young,
healthy, courageous men simply did not need anaesthesia. Such opposition
was ineffectual. Use of anaesthesia spread with extreme rapidity (and
far faster than would be possible today). Even prominent churchmen
supported its use.</p>
<p>The first practical tampon, Tampax, didn’t arrive until the 1930s. It
was invented by Dr. Earle Cleveland Haas. He made it of compressed
cotton, and designed an applicator from paper tubes. This helped lessen
resistance to the products by those who objected to the self-touching
that might otherwise occur. By the early 1940s, 25 percent of women were
using them. Thirty years later, it was 70 percent. Now it’s four out of
five, with the remainder relying on pads, which are now hyper-absorbent,
and held in place by effective adhesives (opposed to the awkwardly
placed, bulky, belted, diaper-like sanitary napkins of the 1970s). Did
Muruganantham, Simpson and Haas oppress women, or free them? What about
Gregory Goodwin Pincus, who invented the birth control pill? In what
manner were these practical, enlightened, persistent men part of a
constricting patriarchy?</p>
<p>Why do we teach our young people that our incredible culture is the
result of male oppression? Blinded by this central assumption
disciplines as diverse as education, social work, art history, gender
studies, literature, sociology and, increasingly, law actively treat men
as oppressors and men’s activity as inherently destructive. They also
often directly promote radical political action—radical by all the norms
of the societies within which they are situated—which they do not
distinguish from education. The Pauline Jewett Institute of Women’s and
Gender Studies at Ottawa’s Carleton University, for example, encourages
activism as part of their mandate. The Gender Studies Department at
Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, “teaches feminist, anti-racist,
and queer theories and methods that centre activism for social
change”—indicating support for the supposition that university education
should above all foster political engagement of a particular kind.</p>
<p>Postmodernism and the Long Arm of Marx</p>
<p>These disciplines draw their philosophy from multiple sources. All
are heavily influenced by the Marxist humanists. One such figure is Max
Horkheimer, who developed critical theory in the 1930s. Any brief
summary of his ideas is bound to be oversimplified, but Horkheimer
regarded himself as a Marxist. He believed that Western principles of
individual freedom or the free market were merely masks that served to
disguise the true conditions of the West: inequality, domination and
exploitation. He believed that intellectual activity should be devoted
to social change, instead of mere understanding, and hoped to emancipate
humanity from its enslavement. Horkheimer and his Frankfurt School of
associated thinkers—first, in Germany and later, in the US—aimed at a
full-scale critique and transformation of Western civilization.</p>
<p>More important in recent years has been the work of French
philosopher Jacques Derrida, leader of the postmodernists, who came into
vogue in the late 1970s. Derrida described his own ideas as a
radicalized form of Marxism. Marx attempted to reduce history and
society to economics, considering culture the oppression of the poor by
the rich. When Marxism was put into practice in the Soviet Union, China,
Vietnam, Cambodia and elsewhere, economic resources were brutally
redistributed. Private property was eliminated, and rural people
forcibly collectivized. The result? Tens of millions of people died.
Hundreds of millions more were subject to oppression rivalling that
still operative in North Korea, the last classic communist holdout. The
resulting economic systems were corrupt and unsustainable. The world
entered a prolonged and extremely dangerous cold war. The citizens of
those societies lived the life of the lie, betraying their families,
informing on their neighbours—existing in misery, without complaint (or
else).</p>
<p>Marxist ideas were very attractive to intellectual utopians. One of
the primary architects of the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan,
received a doctorate at the Sorbonne before he became the nominal head
of Cambodia in the mid-1970s. In his doctoral thesis, written in 1959,
he argued that the work done by non-farmers in Cambodia’s cities was
unproductive: bankers, bureaucrats and businessmen added nothing to
society. Instead, they parasitized the genuine value produced through
agriculture, small industry and craft. Samphan’s ideas were favourably
looked upon by the French intellectuals who granted him his Ph.D. Back
in Cambodia, he was provided with the opportunity to put his theories
into practice. The Khmer Rouge evacuated Cambodia’s cities, drove all
the inhabitants into the countryside, closed the banks, banned the use
of currency, and destroyed all the markets. A quarter of the Cambodian
population were worked to death in the countryside, in the killing
fields.</p>
<p>Lest We Forget: Ideas Have Consequences.</p>
<p>When the communists established the Soviet Union after the First
World War, people could be forgiven for hoping that the utopian
collectivist dreams their new leaders purveyed were possible. The
decayed social order of the late nineteenth century produced the
trenches and mass slaughters of the Great War. The gap between rich and
poor was extreme, and most people slaved away in conditions worse than
those later described by Orwell. Although the West received word of the
horror perpetrated by Lenin after the Russian Revolution, it remained
difficult to evaluate his actions from afar. Russia was in
post-monarchical chaos, and the news of widespread industrial
development and redistribution of property to those who had so recently
been serfs provided reason for hope. To complicate things further, the
USSR (and Mexico) supported the democratic Republicans when the Spanish
Civil War broke out, in 1936. They were fighting against the essentially
fascist Nationalists, who had overthrown the fragile democracy
established only five years previously, and who found support with the
Nazis and Italian fascists.</p>
<p>The intelligentsia in America, Great Britain and elsewhere were
severely frustrated by their home countries’ neutrality. Thousands of
foreigners streamed into Spain to fight for the Republicans, serving in
the International Brigades. George Orwell was one of them. Ernest
Hemingway served there as a journalist, and was a supporter of the
Republicans. Politically concerned young Americans, Canadians and Brits
felt a moral obligation to stop talking and start fighting.</p>
<p>All of this drew attention away from concurrent events in the Soviet
Union. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, the Stalinist Soviets
sent two million kulaks, their richest peasants, to Siberia (those with
a small number of cows, a couple of hired hands, or a few acres more
than was typical). From the communist viewpoint, these kulaks had
gathered their wealth by plundering those around them, and deserved
their fate. Wealth signified oppression, and private property was theft.
It was time for some equity. More than thirty thousand kulaks were shot
on the spot. Many more met their fate at the hands of their most
jealous, resentful and unproductive neighbours, who used the high ideals
of communist collectivization to mask their murderous intent.</p>
<p>The kulaks were “enemies of the people,” apes, scum, vermin, filth
and swine. “We will make soap out of the kulak,” claimed one
particularly brutal cadre of city-dwellers, mobilized by party and
Soviet executive committees, and sent out into the countryside. The
kulaks were driven, naked, into the streets, beaten, and forced to dig
their own graves. The women were raped. Their belongings were
“expropriated,” which, in practice, meant that their houses were
stripped down to the rafters and ceiling beams and everything was
stolen. In many places, the non-kulak peasants resisted, particularly
the women, who took to surrounding the persecuted families with their
bodies. Such resistance proved futile. The kulaks who didn’t die were
exiled to Siberia, often in the middle of the night. The trains started
in February, in the bitter Russian cold. Housing of the most substandard
kind awaited them upon arrival on the desert taiga. Many died,
particularly children, from typhoid, measles and scarlet fever.</p>
<p>The “parasitical” kulaks were, in general, the most skillful and
hardworking farmers. A small minority of people are responsible for most
of the production in any field, and farming proved no different.
Agricultural output crashed. What little remained was taken by force out
of the countryside and into the cities. Rural people who went out into
the fields after the harvest to glean single grains of wheat for their
hungry families risked execution. Six million people died of starvation
in the Ukraine, the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, in the 1930s. “To
eat your own children is a barbarian act,” declared posters of the
Soviet regime.</p>
<p>Despite more than mere rumours of such atrocities, attitudes towards
communism remained consistently positive among many Western
intellectuals. There were other things to worry about, and the Second
World War allied the Soviet Union with the Western countries opposing
Hitler, Mussolini and Hirohito. Certain watchful eyes remained open,
nonetheless. Malcolm Muggeridge published a series of articles
describing Soviet demolition of the peasantry as early as 1933, for the
Manchester Guardian. George Orwell understood what was going on under
Stalin, and he made it widely known. He published Animal Farm, a fable
satirizing the Soviet Union, in 1945, despite encountering serious
resistance to the book’s release. Many who should have known better
retained their blindness for long after this. Nowhere was this truer
than France, and nowhere truer in France than among the
intellectuals.</p>
<p>France’s most famous mid-century philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, was a
well-known communist, although not a card-carrier, until he denounced
the Soviet incursion into Hungary in 1956. He remained an advocate for
Marxism, nonetheless, and did not finally break with the Soviet Union
until 1968, when the Soviets violently suppressed the Czechoslovakians
during the Prague Spring.</p>
<p>Not long after came the publication of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The
Gulag Archipelago, which we have discussed rather extensively in
previous chapters. As noted (and is worth noting again), this book
utterly demolished communism’s moral credibility—first in the West, and
then in the Soviet System itself. It circulated in underground samizdat
format. Russians had twenty-four hours to read their rare copy before
handing it to the next waiting mind. A Russian-language reading was
broadcast into the Soviet Union by Radio Liberty.</p>
<p>Solzhenitsyn argued that the Soviet system could have never survived
without tyranny and slave labour; that the seeds of its worst excesses
were definitively sowed in the time of Lenin (for whom the Western
communists still served as apologists); and that it was propped up by
endless lies, both individual and public. Its sins could not be blamed
on a simple cult of personality, as its supporters continued to claim.
Solzhenitsyn documented the Soviet Union’s extensive mistreatment of
political prisoners, its corrupt legal system, and its mass murders, and
showed in painstaking detail how these were not aberrations but direct
expressions of the underlying communist philosophy. No one could stand
up for communism after The Gulag Archipelago—not even the communists
themselves.</p>
<p>This did not mean that the fascination Marxist ideas had for
intellectuals—particularly French intellectuals—disappeared. It merely
transformed. Some refused outright to learn. Sartre denounced
Solzhenitsyn as a “dangerous element.” Derrida, more subtle, substituted
the idea of power for the idea of money, and continued on his merry way.
Such linguistic sleight-of-hand gave all the barely repentant Marxists
still inhabiting the intellectual pinnacles of the West the means to
retain their world-view. Society was no longer repression of the poor by
the rich. It was oppression of everyone by the powerful.</p>
<p>According to Derrida, hierarchical structures emerged only to include
(the beneficiaries of that structure) and to exclude (everyone else, who
were therefore oppressed). Even that claim wasn’t sufficiently radical.
Derrida claimed that divisiveness and oppression were built right into
language—built into the very categories we use to pragmatically simplify
and negotiate the world. There are “women” only because men gain by
excluding them. There are “males and females” only because members of
that more heterogeneous group benefit by excluding the tiny minority of
people whose biological sexuality is amorphous. Science only benefits
the scientists. Politics only benefits the politicians. In Derrida’s
view, hierarchies exist because they gain from oppressing those who are
omitted. It is this ill-gotten gain that allows them to flourish.</p>
<p>Derrida famously said (although he denied it, later): “Il n’y a pas
de hors-texte”—often translated as “there is nothing outside the text.”
His supporters say that is a mistranslation, and that the English
equivalent should have been “there is no outside-text.” It remains
difficult, either way, to read the statement as saying anything other
than “everything is interpretation,” and that is how Derrida’s work has
generally been interpreted.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to over-estimate the nihilistic and
destructive nature of this philosophy. It puts the act of categorization
itself in doubt. It negates the idea that distinctions might be drawn
between things for any reasons other than that of raw power. Biological
distinctions between men and women? Despite the existence of an
overwhelming, multi-disciplinary scientific literature indicating that
sex differences are powerfully influenced by biological factors, science
is just another game of power, for Derrida and his post-modern Marxist
acolytes, making claims to benefit those at the pinnacle of the
scientific world. There are no facts. Hierarchical position and
reputation as a consequence of skill and competence? All definitions of
skill and of competence are merely made up by those who benefit from
them, to exclude others, and to benefit personally and selfishly.</p>
<p>There is sufficient truth to Derrida’s claims to account, in part,
for their insidious nature. Power is a fundamental motivational force
(“a,” not “the”). People compete to rise to the top, and they care where
they are in dominance hierarchies. But (and this is where you separate
the metaphorical boys from the men, philosophically) the fact that power
plays a role in human motivation does not mean that it plays the only
role, or even the primary role. Likewise, the fact that we can never
know everything does make all our observations and utterances dependent
on taking some things into account and leaving other things out (as we
discussed extensively in Rule 10). That does not justify the claim that
everything is interpretation, or that categorization is just exclusion.
Beware of single cause interpretations—and beware the people who purvey
them.</p>
<p>Although the facts cannot speak for themselves (just as an expanse of
land spread out before a voyager cannot tell him how to journey through
it), and although there are a myriad ways to interact with—even to
perceive—even a small number of objects, that does not mean that all
interpretations are equally valid. Some hurt—yourself and others. Others
put you on a collision course with society. Some are not sustainable
across time. Others do not get you where you want to go. Many of these
constraints are built in to us, as a consequence of billions of years of
evolutionary processes. Others emerge as we are socialized into
cooperating and competing peacefully and productively with others. Still
more interpretations emerge as we discard counterproductive strategies
through learning. An endless number of interpretations, certainly: that
is not different than saying an endless number of problems. But a
seriously bounded number of viable solutions. Otherwise life would be
easy. And it’s not.</p>
<p>Now, I have some beliefs that might be regarded as left-leaning. I
think, for example, that the tendency for valuable goods to distribute
themselves with pronounced inequality constitutes an ever-present threat
to the stability of society. I think there is good evidence for that.
That does not mean that the solution to the problem is self-evident. We
don’t know how to redistribute wealth without introducing a whole host
of other problems. Different Western societies have tried different
approaches. The Swedes, for example, push equality to its limit. The US
takes the opposite tack, assuming that the net wealth-creation of a more
free-for-all capitalism constitutes the rising tide that lifts all
boats. The results of these experiments are not all in, and countries
differ very much in relevant ways. Differences in history, geographic
area, population size and ethnic diversity make direct comparisons very
difficult. But it certainly is the case that forced redistribution, in
the name of utopian equality, is a cure to shame the disease.</p>
<p>I think, as well (on what might be considered the leftish side), that
the incremental remake of university administrations into analogues of
private corporations is a mistake. I think that the science of
management is a pseudo-discipline. I believe that government can,
sometimes, be a force for good, as well as the necessary arbiter of a
small set of necessary rules. Nonetheless, I do not understand why our
society is providing public funding to institutions and educators whose
stated, conscious and explicit aim is the demolition of the culture that
supports them. Such people have a perfect right to their opinions and
actions, if they remain lawful. But they have no reasonable claim to
public funding. If radical right-wingers were receiving state funding
for political operations disguised as university courses, as the radical
left-wingers clearly are, the uproar from progressives across North
America would be deafening.</p>
<p>There are other serious problems lurking in the radical disciplines,
apart from the falseness of their theories and methods, and their
insistence that collective political activism is morally obligatory.
There isn’t a shred of hard evidence to support any of their central
claims: that Western society is pathologically patriarchal; that the
prime lesson of history is that men, rather than nature, were the
primary source of the oppression of women (rather than, as in most
cases, their partners and supporters); that all hierarchies are based on
power and aimed at exclusion. Hierarchies exist for many reasons—some
arguably valid, some not—and are incredibly ancient, evolutionarily
speaking. Do male crustaceans oppress female crustaceans? Should their
hierarchies be upended?</p>
<p>In societies that are well-functioning—not in comparison to a
hypothetical utopia, but contrasted with other existing or historical
cultures—competence, not power, is a prime determiner of status.
Competence. Ability. Skill. Not power. This is obvious both anecdotally
and factually. No one with brain cancer is equity-minded enough to
refuse the service of the surgeon with the best education, the best
reputation and, perhaps, the highest earnings. Furthermore, the most
valid personality trait predictors of long-term success in Western
countries are intelligence (as measured with cognitive ability or IQ
tests) and conscientiousness (a trait characterized by industriousness
and orderliness).188 There are exceptions. Entrepreneurs and artists are
higher in openness to experience,189 another cardinal personality trait,
than in conscientiousness. But openness is associated with verbal
intelligence and creativity, so that exception is appropriate and
understandable. The predictive power of these traits, mathematically and
economically speaking, is exceptionally high—among the highest, in terms
of power, of anything ever actually measured at the harder ends of the
social sciences. A good battery of personality/cognitive tests can
increase the probability of employing someone more competent than
average from 50:50 to 85:15. These are the facts, as well supported as
anything in the social sciences (and this is saying more than you might
think, as the social sciences are more effective disciplines than their
cynical critics appreciate). Thus, not only is the state supporting
one-sided radicalism, it is also supporting indoctrination. We do not
teach our children that the world is flat. Neither should we teach them
unsupported ideologically-predicated theories about the nature of men
and women—or the nature of hierarchy.</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to note (if the deconstructionists would leave
it at that) that science can be biased by the interests of power, and to
warn against that—or to point out that evidence is too often what
powerful people, including scientists, decide it is. After all,
scientists are people too, and people like power, just like lobsters
like power—just like deconstructionists like to be known for their
ideas, and strive rightly to sit atop their academic hierarchies. But
that doesn’t mean that science—or even deconstructionism—is only about
power. Why believe such a thing? Why insist upon it? Perhaps it’s this:
if only power exists, then the use of power becomes fully justifiable.
There is no bounding such use by evidence, method, logic, or even the
necessity for coherence. There is no bounding by anything “outside the
text.” That leaves opinion—and force—and the use of force is all too
attractive, under such circumstances, just as its employment in the
service of that opinion is all too certain. The insane and
incomprehensible postmodern insistence that all gender differences are
socially constructed, for example, becomes all too understandable when
its moral imperative is grasped—when its justification for force is once
and for all understood: Society must be altered, or bias eliminated,
until all outcomes are equitable. But the bedrock of the social
constructionist position is the wish for the latter, not belief in the
justice of the former. Since all outcome inequalities must be eliminated
(inequality being the heart of all evil), then all gender differences
must be regarded as socially constructed. Otherwise the drive for
equality would be too radical, and the doctrine too blatantly
propagandistic. Thus, the order of logic is reversed, so that the
ideology can be camouflaged. The fact that such statements lead
immediately to internal inconsistencies within the ideology is never
addressed. Gender is constructed, but an individual who desires gender
re-assignment surgery is to be unarguably considered a man trapped in a
woman’s body (or vice versa). The fact that both of these cannot
logically be true, simultaneously, is just ignored (or rationalized away
with another appalling post-modern claim: that logic itself—along with
the techniques of science—is merely part of the oppressive patriarchal
system).</p>
<p>It is also the case, of course, that all outcomes cannot be
equalized. First, outcomes must be measured. Comparing the salaries of
people who occupy the same position is relatively straightforward
(although complicated significantly by such things as date of hire,
given the difference in demand for workers, for example, at different
time periods). But there are other dimensions of comparison that are
arguably equally relevant, such as tenure, promotion rate, and social
influence. The introduction of the “equal pay for equal work” argument
immediately complicates even salary comparison beyond practicality, for
one simple reason: who decides what work is equal? It’s not possible.
That’s why the marketplace exists. Worse is the problem of group
comparison: women should make as much as men. OK. Black women should
make as much as white women. OK. Should salary then be adjusted for all
parameters of race? At what level of resolution? What racial categories
are “real”?</p>
<p>The U.S. National Institute of Health, to take a single bureaucratic
example, recognizes American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black,
Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and White. But
there are more than five hundred separate American Indian tribes. By
what possible logic should “American Indian” therefore stand as a
canonical category? Osage tribal members have a yearly average income of
0K, while Tohono O’odham’s make 1K. Are they equally oppressed? What
about disabilities? Disabled people should make as much as non-disabled
people. OK. On the surface, that’s a noble, compassionate, fair claim.
But who is disabled? Is someone living with a parent with Alzheimer’s
disabled? If not, why not? What about someone with a lower IQ? Someone
less attractive? Someone overweight? Some people clearly move through
life markedly overburdened with problems that are beyond their control,
but it is a rare person indeed who isn’t suffering from at least one
serious catastrophe at any given time—particularly if you include their
family in the equation. And why shouldn’t you? Here’s the fundamental
problem: group identity can be fractionated right down to the level of
the individual. That sentence should be written in capital letters.
Every person is unique—and not just in a trivial manner: importantly,
significantly, meaningfully unique. Group membership cannot capture that
variability. Period.</p>
<p>None of this complexity is ever discussed by the postmodern/Marxist
thinkers. Instead, their ideological approach fixes a point of truth,
like the North Star, and forces everything to rotate around it. The
claim that all gender differences are a consequence of socialization is
neither provable, nor disprovable, in some sense, because culture can be
brought to bear with such force on groups or individuals that virtually
any outcome is attainable, if we are willing to bear the cost. We know,
for example, from studies of adopted-out identical twins,190 that
culture can produce a fifteen-point (or one standard deviation) increase
in IQ (roughly the difference between the average high school student
and the average state college student) at the cost of a
three-standard-deviation increase in wealth.191 What this means,
approximately, is that two identical twins, separated at birth, will
differ in IQ by fifteen points if the first twin is raised in a family
that is poorer than 85 percent of families and the second is raised in a
family richer than 95 percent of families. Something similar has
recently been demonstrated with education, rather than wealth.192 We
don’t know what it would cost in wealth or differential education to
produce a more extreme transformation.</p>
<p>What such studies imply is that we could probably minimize the innate
differences between boys and girls, if we were willing to exert enough
pressure. This would in no way ensure that we were freeing people of
either gender to make their own choices. But choice has no place in the
ideological picture: if men and women act, voluntarily, to produce
gender-unequal outcomes, those very choices must have been determined by
cultural bias. In consequence, everyone is a brainwashed victim,
wherever gender differences exist, and the rigorous critical
theoretician is morally obligated to set them straight. This means that
those already equity-minded Scandinavian males, who aren’t much into
nursing, require even more retraining. The same goes, in principle, for
Scandinavian females, who aren’t much into engineering.193 What might
such retraining look like? Where might its limits lie? Such things are
often pushed past any reasonable limit before they are discontinued.
Mao’s murderous Cultural Revolution should have taught us that.</p>
<p>Boys into Girls</p>
<p>It has become a tenet of a certain kind of social constructionist
theory that the world would be much improved if boys were socialized
like girls. Those who put forward such theories assume, first, that
aggression is a learned behaviour, and can therefore simply not be
taught, and second (to take a particular example) that, “boys should be
socialized the way girls have been traditionally socialized, and they
should be encouraged to develop socially positive qualities such as
tenderness, sensitivity to feelings, nurturance, cooperative and
aesthetic appreciation.” In the opinions of such thinkers, aggression
will only be reduced when male adolescents and young adults “subscribe
to the same standards of behavior as have been traditionally encouraged
for women.”194</p>
<p>There are so many things wrong with this idea that it is difficult to
know where to start. First, it is not the case that aggression is merely
learned. Aggression is there at the beginning. There are ancient
biological circuits, so to speak, that underlie defensive and predatory
aggression.195 They are so fundamental that they still operate in what
are known as decorticate cats, animals that have had the largest and
most recently evolved parts of their brain—an overwhelmingly large
percentage of the total structure—entirely removed. This suggests not
only that aggression is innate, but that it is a consequence of activity
in extremely fundamental, basic brain areas. If the brain is a tree,
then aggression (along with hunger, thirst and sexual desire) is there
in the very trunk.</p>
<p>And, in keeping with this, it appears that a subset of two-year-old
boys (about 5 percent) are quite aggressive, by temperament. They take
other kids’ toys, kick, bite and hit. Most are nonetheless socialized
effectively by the age of four.196 This is not, however, because they
have been encouraged to act like little girls. Instead, they are taught
or otherwise learn in early childhood to integrate their aggressive
tendencies into more sophisticated behavioural routines. Aggression
underlies the drive to be outstanding, to be unstoppable, to compete, to
win—to be actively virtuous, at least along one dimension. Determination
is its admirable, pro-social face. Aggressive young children who don’t
manage to render their temperament sophisticated by the end of infancy
are doomed to unpopularity, as their primordial antagonism no longer
serves them socially at later ages. Rejected by their peers, they lack
further socialization opportunities and tend towards outcast status.
These are the individuals who remain much more inclined toward
antisocial and criminal behavior when adolescent and adult. But this
does not at all mean that the aggressive drive lacks either utility or
value. At a minimum, it is necessary for self-protection.</p>
<p>Compassion as a Vice</p>
<p>Many of the female clients (perhaps even a majority) that I see in my
clinical practice have trouble in their jobs and family lives not
because they are too aggressive, but because they are not aggressive
enough. Cognitive-behavioural therapists call the treatment of such
people, generally characterized by the more feminine traits of
agreeableness (politeness and compassion) and neuroticism (anxiety and
emotional pain), “assertiveness training.”197 Insufficiently aggressive
women—and men, although more rarely—do too much for others. They tend to
treat those around them as if they were distressed children. They tend
to be naïve. They assume that cooperation should be the basis of all
social transactions, and they avoid conflict (which means they avoid
confronting problems in their relationships as well as at work). They
continually sacrifice for others. This may sound virtuous—and it is
definitely an attitude that has certain social advantages—but it can and
often does become counterproductively one-sided. Because too-agreeable
people bend over backwards for other people, they do not stand up
properly for themselves. Assuming that others think as they do, they
expect—instead of ensuring—reciprocity for their thoughtful actions.
When this does not happen, they don’t speak up. They do not or cannot
straightforwardly demand recognition. The dark side of their characters
emerges, because of their subjugation, and they become resentful.</p>
<p>I teach excessively agreeable people to note the emergence of such
resentment, which is a very important, although very toxic, emotion.
There are only two major reasons for resentment: being taken advantage
of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of), or whiny refusal to
adopt responsibility and grow up. If you’re resentful, look for the
reasons. Perhaps discuss the issue with someone you trust. Are you
feeling hard done by, in an immature manner? If, after some honest
consideration, you don’t think it’s that, perhaps someone is taking
advantage of you. This means that you now face a moral obligation to
speak up for yourself. This might mean confronting your boss, or your
husband, or your wife, or your child, or your parents. It might mean
gathering some evidence, strategically, so that when you confront that
person, you can give them several examples of their misbehaviour (at
least three), so they can’t easily weasel out of your accusations. It
might mean failing to concede when they offer you their
counterarguments. People rarely have more than four at hand. If you
remain unmoved, they get angry, or cry, or run away. It’s very useful to
attend to tears in such situations. They can be used to motivate guilt
on the part of the accuser due, theoretically, to having caused hurt
feelings and pain. But tears are often shed in anger. A red face is a
good cue. If you can push your point past the first four responses and
stand fast against the consequent emotion, you will gain your target’s
attention—and, perhaps, their respect. This is genuine conflict,
however, and it’s neither pleasant nor easy.</p>
<p>You must also know clearly what you want out of the situation, and be
prepared to clearly articulate your desire. It’s a good idea to tell the
person you are confronting exactly what you would like them to do
instead of what they have done or currently are doing. You might think,
“if they loved me, they would know what to do.” That’s the voice of
resentment. Assume ignorance before malevolence. No one has a direct
pipeline to your wants and needs—not even you. If you try to determine
exactly what you want, you might find that it is more difficult than you
think. The person oppressing you is likely no wiser than you, especially
about you. Tell them directly what would be preferable, instead, after
you have sorted it out. Make your request as small and reasonable as
possible—but ensure that its fulfillment would satisfy you. In that
manner, you come to the discussion with a solution, instead of just a
problem.</p>
<p>Agreeable, compassionate, empathic, conflict-averse people (all those
traits group together) let people walk on them, and they get bitter.
They sacrifice themselves for others, sometimes excessively, and cannot
comprehend why that is not reciprocated. Agreeable people are compliant,
and this robs them of their independence. The danger associated with
this can be amplified by high trait neuroticism. Agreeable people will
go along with whoever makes a suggestion, instead of insisting, at least
sometimes, on their own way. So, they lose their way, and become
indecisive and too easily swayed. If they are, in addition, easily
frightened and hurt, they have even less reason to strike out on their
own, as doing so exposes them to threat and danger (at least in the
short term). That’s the pathway to dependent personality disorder,
technically speaking.198 It might be regarded as the polar opposite of
antisocial personality disorder, the set of traits characteristic of
delinquency in childhood and adolescence and criminality in adulthood.
It would be lovely if the opposite of a criminal was a saint—but it’s
not the case. The opposite of a criminal is an Oedipal mother, which is
its own type of criminal.</p>
<p>The Oedipal mother (and fathers can play this role too, but it’s
comparatively rare) says to her child, “I only live for you.” She does
everything for her children. She ties their shoes, and cuts up their
food, and lets them crawl into bed with her and her partner far too
often. That’s a good and conflict-avoidant method for avoiding unwanted
sexual attention, as well.</p>
<p>The Oedipal mother makes a pact with herself, her children, and the
devil himself. The deal is this: “Above all, never leave me. In return,
I will do everything for you. As you age without maturing, you will
become worthless and bitter, but you will never have to take any
responsibility, and everything you do that’s wrong will always be
someone else’s fault.” The children can accept or reject this—and they
have some choice in the matter.</p>
<p>The Oedipal mother is the witch in the story of Hansel and Gretel.
The two children in that fairy tale have a new step-mother. She orders
her husband to abandon his children in the forest, as there is a famine
and she thinks they eat too much. He obeys his wife, takes his children
deep into the woods and leaves them to their fate. Wandering, starving
and lonely, they come across a miracle. A house. And not just any house.
A candy house. A gingerbread house. A person who had not been rendered
too caring, empathic, sympathetic and cooperative might be skeptical,
and ask, “Is this too good to be true?” But the children are too young,
and too desperate.</p>
<p>Inside the house is a kind old woman, rescuer of distraught children,
kind patter of heads and wiper of noses, all bosom and hips, ready to
sacrifice herself to their every wish, at a moment’s notice. She feeds
the children anything they want, any time they want, and they never have
to do anything. But provision of that kind of care makes her hungry. She
puts Hansel into a cage, to fatten him up ever more efficiently. He
fools her into thinking he’s staying thin by offering her an old bone,
when she tries to test his leg for the desired tenderness. She gets too
desperate to wait, eventually, and stokes the oven, preparing to cook
and eat the object of her doting. Gretel, who has apparently not been
lulled into full submission, waits for a moment of carelessness, and
pushes the kind old woman into the oven. The kids run away, and rejoin
their father, who has thoroughly repented of his evil actions.</p>
<p>In a household like that, the choicest cut of child is the spirit,
and it’s always consumed first. Too much protection devastates the
developing soul.</p>
<p>The witch in the Hansel and Gretel tale is the Terrible Mother, the
dark half of the symbolically feminine. Deeply social as we are in our
essence, we tend to view the world as a story, the characters of which
are mother, father and child. The feminine, as a whole, is unknown
nature outside the bounds of culture, creation and destruction: she is
the protective arms of mother and the destructive element of time, the
beautiful virgin-mother and the swamp-dwelling hag. This archetypal
entity was confused with an objective, historical reality, back in the
late 1800s, by a Swiss anthropologist named Johann Jakob Bachofen.
Bachofen proposed that humanity had passed through a series of
developmental stages in its history.</p>
<p>The first, roughly speaking (after a somewhat anarchic and chaotic
beginning), was Das Mutterrecht199—a society where women held the
dominant positions of power, respect and honour, where polyamory and
promiscuity ruled, and where any certainty of paternity was absent. The
second, the Dionysian, was a phase of transition, during which these
original matriarchal foundations were overturned and power was taken by
men. The third phase, the Apollonian, still reigns today. The patriarchy
rules, and each woman belongs exclusively to one man. Bachofen’s ideas
became profoundly influential, in certain circles, despite the absence
of any historical evidence to support them. One Marija Gimbutas, for
example—an archaeologist—famously claimed in the 1980s and 1990s that a
peaceful goddess-and-woman-centred culture once characterized Neolithic
Europe.200 She claimed that it was supplanted and suppressed by an
invasive hierarchical warrior culture, which laid the basis for modern
society. Art historian Merlin Stone made the same argument in his book
When God Was a Woman.201 This whole series of essentially
archetypal/mythological ideas became touchstones for the theology of the
women’s movement and the matriarchal studies of 1970s feminism (Cynthia
Eller, who wrote a book criticizing such ideas—The Myth of Matriarchal
Prehistory—called this theology “an ennobling lie”).202</p>
<p>Carl Jung had encountered Bachofen’s ideas of primordial matriarchy
decades earlier. Jung soon realized, however, that the developmental
progression described by the earlier Swiss thinker represented a
psychological rather than a historical reality. He saw in Bachofen’s
thought the same processes of projection of imaginative fantasy on to
the external world that had led to the population of the cosmos with
constellations and gods. In The Origins and History of Consciousness203
and The Great Mother204, Jung’s collaborator Erich Neumann extended his
colleague’s analysis. Neumann traced the emergence of consciousness,
symbolically masculine, and contrasted it with its symbolically
feminine, material (mother, matrix) origins, subsuming Freud’s theory of
Oedipal parenting into a broader archetypal model. For Neumann, and for
Jung, consciousness—always symbolically masculine, even in
women—struggles upwards toward the light. Its development is painful and
anxiety-provoking, as it carries with it the realization of
vulnerability and death. It is constantly tempted to sink back down into
dependency and unconsciousness, and to shed its existential burden. It
is aided in that pathological desire by anything that opposes
enlightenment, articulation, rationality, self-determination, strength
and competence—by anything that shelters too much, and therefore
smothers and devours. Such overprotection is Freud’s Oedipal familial
nightmare, which we are rapidly transforming into social policy.</p>
<p>The Terrible Mother is an ancient symbol. It manifests itself, for
example, in the form of Tiamat, in the earliest written story we have
recovered, the Mesopotamian Enuma Elish. Tiamat is the mother of all
things, gods and men alike. She is the unknown and chaos and the nature
that gives rise to all forms. But she is also the female dragon-deity
who moves to destroy her own children, when they carelessly kill their
father and attempt to live on the corpse that remains. The Terrible
Mother is the spirit of careless unconsciousness, tempting the
ever-striving spirit of awareness and enlightenment down into the
protective womb-like embrace of the underworld. It’s the terror young
men feel towards attractive women, who are nature itself, ever ready to
reject them, intimately, at the deepest possible level. Nothing inspires
self-consciousness, undermines courage, and fosters feelings of nihilism
and hatred more than that—except, perhaps, the too-tight embrace of
too-caring mom.</p>
<p>The Terrible Mother appears in many fairy tales, and in many stories
for adults. In the Sleeping Beauty, she is the Evil Queen, dark nature
herself—Maleficent, in the Disney version. The royal parents of Princess
Aurora fail to invite this force of the night to their baby daughter’s
christening. Thus, they shelter her too much from the destructive and
dangerous side of reality, preferring that she grow up untroubled by
such things. Their reward? At puberty, she is still unconscious. The
masculine spirit, her prince, is both a man who could save her, by
tearing her from her parents, and her own consciousness, trapped in a
dungeon by the machinations of the dark side of femininity. When that
prince escapes, and presses the Evil Queen too hard, she turns into the
Dragon of Chaos itself. The symbolic masculine defeats her with truth
and faith, and finds the princess, whose eyes he opens with a kiss.</p>
<p>It might be objected (as it was, with Disney’s more recent and deeply
propagandistic Frozen) that a woman does not need a man to rescue her.
That may be true, and it may not. It may be that only the woman who
wants (or has) a child needs a man to rescue her—or at least to support
and aid her. In any case, it is certain that a woman needs consciousness
be rescued, and, as noted above, consciousness is symbolically masculine
and has been since the beginning of time (in the guise both of order and
of the Logos, the mediating principle). The Prince could be a lover, but
could also be a woman’s own attentive wakefulness, clarity of vision,
and tough-minded independence. Those are masculine traits—in actuality,
as well as symbolically, as men are actually less tender-minded and
agreeable than women, on average, and are less susceptible to anxiety
and emotional pain. And, to say it again: (1) this is most true in those
Scandinavian nations where the most steps towards gender equality have
been taken—and (2) the differences are not small by the standards
whereby such things are measured.</p>
<p>The relationship between the masculine and consciousness is also
portrayed, symbolically, in the Disney movie The Little Mermaid. Ariel,
the heroine, is quite feminine, but she also has a strong spirit of
independence. For this reason, she is her father’s favourite, although
she also causes him the most trouble. Her father Triton is the king,
representing the known, culture and order (with a hint of the oppressive
rule-giver and tyrant). Because order is always opposed by chaos, Triton
has an adversary, Ursula, a tentacled octopus—a serpent, a gorgon, a
hydra. Thus, Ursula is in the same archetypal category as the
dragon/queen Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty (or the jealous older queen
in Snow White, Lady Tremaine in Cinderella, the Red Queen in Alice in
Wonderland, Cruella de Vil in 101 Dalmations, Miss Medusa in The
Rescuers and Mother Gothel in Tangled).</p>
<p>Ariel wants to kindle a romance with Prince Eric, whom she previously
rescued from a shipwreck. Ursula tricks Ariel into giving up her voice
so that she can have three days as a human being. Ursula knows full
well, however, that a voiceless Ariel will not be able to establish a
relationship with the Prince. Without her capacity to speak—without the
Logos; without the Divine Word—she will remain underwater, unconscious,
forever.</p>
<p>When Ariel fails to form a union with Prince Eric, Ursula steals her
soul, and places it in her large collection of shrivelled and warped
semi-beings, well-protected by her feminine graces. When King Triton
shows up to demand the return of his daughter, Ursula makes him a
terrible offer: he can take Ariel’s place. Of course, the elimination of
the Wise King (who represents, to say it again, the benevolent side of
the patriarchy) has been Ursula’s nefarious plan all along. Ariel is
released, but Triton is now reduced to a pathetic shadow of his former
self. More importantly, Ursula now has Triton’s magic trident, the
source of his godlike power.</p>
<p>Fortunately for everyone concerned (except Ursula), Prince Eric
returns, distracting the evil queen of the underworld with a harpoon.
This opens an opportunity for Ariel to attack Ursula, who grows, in
response, to monstrous proportions—in the same manner as Maleficent,
Sleeping Beauty’s evil queen. Ursula creates a huge storm, and raises a
whole navy of sunken ships from the ocean floor. As she prepares to kill
Ariel, Eric commandeers a wrecked ship, and rams her with its broken
bowsprit. Triton and the other captured souls are released. The
rejuvenated Triton then transforms his daughter into a human being, so
she can remain with Eric. For a woman to become complete, such stories
claim, she must form a relationship with masculine consciousness and
stand up to the terrible world (which sometimes manifests itself,
primarily, in the form of her too-present mother). An actual man can
help her do that, to some degree, but it is better for everyone
concerned when no one is too dependent.</p>
<p>One day, when I was a kid, I was out playing softball with some
friends. The teams were a mixture of boys and girls. We were all old
enough so that the boys and girls were starting to be interested in one
another in an unfamiliar way. Status was becoming more relevant and
important. My friend Jake and I were about to come to blows, pushing
each other around near the pitching mound, when my mom walked by. She
was a fair distance away, about thirty yards, but I could immediately
see by the change in her body language that she knew what was going on.
Of course, the other kids saw her as well. She walked right by. I knew
that hurt her. Part of her was worried that I would come home with a
bloody nose and a black eye. It would have been easy enough for her just
to yell, “Hey, you kids, quit that!” or even to come over and interfere.
But she didn’t. A few years later, when I was having teenage trouble
with my dad, my mom said, “If it was too good at home, you’d never
leave.”</p>
<p>My mom is a tender-hearted person. She’s empathetic, and cooperative,
and agreeable. Sometimes she lets people push her around. When she went
back to work after being at home with her young kids, she found it
challenging to stand up to the men. Sometimes that made her
resentful—something she also feels, sometimes, in relationship to my
father, who is strongly inclined to do what he wants, when he wants to.
Despite all that, she’s no Oedipal mother. She fostered the independence
of her children, even though doing so was often hard on her. She did the
right thing, even though it caused her emotional distress.</p>
<p>Toughen Up, You Weasel</p>
<p>I spent one youthful summer on the prairie of central Saskatchewan
working on a railway line crew. Every man in that all-male group was
tested by the others during the first two weeks or so of their hiring.
Many of the other workers were Northern Cree Indians, quiet guys for the
most part, easygoing, until they drank too much, and the chips on their
shoulders started to show. They had been in and out of jail, as had most
of their relatives. They didn’t attach much shame to that, considering
it just another part of the white man’s system. It was also warm in jail
in the winter, and the food was regular and plentiful. I lent one of the
Cree guys fifty bucks at one point. Instead of paying me back, he
offered me a pair of bookends, cut from some of the original rail laid
across western Canada, which I still own. That was better than the fifty
bucks.</p>
<p>When a new guy first showed up, the other workers would inevitably
provide him with an insulting nickname. They called me Howdy-Doody,
after I was accepted as a crew member (something I am still slightly
embarrassed to admit). When I asked the originator why he chose that
moniker, he said, wittily and absurdly, “Because you look nothing like
him.” Working men are often extremely funny, in a caustic, biting,
insulting manner (as discussed in Rule 9). They are always harassing
each other, partly for amusement, partly to score points in the eternal
dominance battle between them, but also partly to see what the other guy
will do if he is subjected to social stress. It’s part of the process of
character evaluation, as well as camaraderie. When it works well (when
everybody gets, and gives as good as they get, and can give and take)
it’s a big part of what allows men who work for a living to tolerate or
even enjoy laying pipe and working on oil rigs and lumberjacking and
working in restaurant kitchens and all the other hot, dirty, physically
demanding and dangerous work that is still done almost totally by
men.</p>
<p>Not too long after I started on the rail crew, my name was changed to
Howdy. This was a great improvement, as it had a good Western
connotation, and was not obviously linked to that stupid puppet. The
next man hired was not so fortunate. He carried a fancy lunchbucket,
which was a mistake, as brown paper bags were the proper,
non-pretentious convention. It was a little too nice and too new. It
looked like maybe his mother had bought it (and packed it) for him.
Thus, it became his name. Lunchbucket was not a good-humored guy. He
bitched about everything, and had a bad attitude. Everything was someone
else’s fault. He was touchy, and none too quick on the draw.</p>
<p>Lunchbucket couldn’t accept his name, or settle into his job. He
adopted an attitude of condescending irritation when addressed, and
reacted to the work in the same manner. He was not fun to be around, and
he couldn’t take a joke. That’s fatal, on a work crew. After about three
days of carrying on with his ill-humour and general air of hard-done-by
superiority, Lunchbucket started to experience harassment extending well
beyond his nickname. He would be peevishly working away on the line,
surrounded by about seventy men, spread out over a quarter mile.
Suddenly a pebble would appear out of nowhere, flying through the air,
aimed at his hardhat. A direct hit would produce a thunking sound,
deeply satisfying to all the quietly attending onlookers. Even this
failed to improve his humour. So, the pebbles got larger. Lunchbucket
would involve himself in something and forget to pay attention. Then,
“thunk!”—a well-aimed stone would nail him on the noggin, producing a
burst of irritated and ineffectual fury. Quiet amusement would ripple
down the rail line. After a few days of this, no wiser, and carrying a
few bruises, Lunchbucket vanished.</p>
<p>Men enforce a code of behaviour on each other, when working together.
Do your work. Pull your weight. Stay awake and pay attention. Don’t
whine or be touchy. Stand up for your friends. Don’t suck up and don’t
snitch. Don’t be a slave to stupid rules. Don’t, in the immortal words
of Arnold Schwarzenegger, be a girlie man. Don’t be dependent. At all.
Ever. Period. The harassment that is part of acceptance on a working
crew is a test: are you tough, entertaining, competent and reliable? If
not, go away. Simple as that. We don’t need to feel sorry for you. We
don’t want to put up with your narcissism, and we don’t want to do your
work.</p>
<p>There was a famous advertisement in the form of a comic strip issued
a few decades ago by the bodybuilder Charles Atlas. It was titled “The
Insult that Made a Man out of Mac” and could be found in almost every
comic book, most of which were read by boys. Mac, the protagonist, is
sitting on a beach blanket with an attractive young woman. A bully runs
by, and kicks sand in both their faces. Mac objects. The much larger man
grabs him by the arm and says, “Listen here. I’d smash your face …. Only
you’re so skinny you might dry up and blow away.” The bully departs. Mac
says to the girl, “The big bully! I’ll get even some day.” She adopts a
provocative pose, and says, “Oh, don’t let it bother you, little boy.”
Mac goes home, considers his pathetic physique, and buys the Atlas
program. Soon, he has a new body. The next time he goes to the beach, he
punches the bully in the nose. The now-admiring girl clings to his arm.
“Oh, Mac!” she says. “You’re a real man after all.”</p>
<p>That ad is famous for a reason. It summarizes human sexual psychology
in seven straightforward panels. The too-weak young man is embarrassed
and self-conscious, as he should be. What good is he? He gets put down
by other men and, worse, by desirable women. Instead of drowning in
resentment, and skulking off to his basement to play video games in his
underwear, covered with Cheetos dust, he presents himself with what
Alfred Adler, Freud’s most practical colleague, called a “compensatory
fantasy.”205 The goal of such a fantasy is not so much wish-fulfillment,
as illumination of a genuine path forward. Mac takes serious note of his
scarecrow-like build and decides that he should develop a stronger body.
More importantly, he puts his plan into action. He identifies with the
part of himself that could transcend his current state, and becomes the
hero of his own adventure. He goes back to the beach, and punches the
bully in the nose. Mac wins. So does his eventual girlfriend. So does
everybody else.</p>
<p>It is to women’s clear advantage that men do not happily put up with
dependency among themselves. Part of the reason that so many a
working-class woman does not marry, now, as we have alluded to, is
because she does not want to look after a man, struggling for
employment, as well as her children. And fair enough. A woman should
look after her children—although that is not all she should do. And a
man should look after a woman and children—although that is not all he
should do. But a woman should not look after a man, because she must
look after children, and a man should not be a child. This means that he
must not be dependent. This is one of the reasons that men have little
patience for dependent men. And let us not forget: wicked women may
produce dependent sons, may support and even marry dependent men, but
awake and conscious women want an awake and conscious partner.</p>
<p>If is for this reason that Nelson Muntz of The Simpsons is so
necessary to the small social group that surrounds Homer’s antihero son,
Bart. Without Nelson, King of the Bullies, the school would soon be
overrun by resentful, touchy Milhouses, narcissistic, intellectual
Martin Princes, soft, chocolate-gorging German children, and infantile
Ralph Wiggums. Muntz is a corrective, a tough, self-sufficient kid who
uses his own capacity for contempt to decide what line of immature and
pathetic behaviour simply cannot be crossed. Part of the genius of The
Simpsons is its writers’ refusal to simply write Nelson off as an
irredeemable bully. Abandoned by his worthless father, neglected,
thankfully, by his thoughtless slut of a mother, Nelson does pretty
well, everything considered. He’s even of romantic interest to the
thoroughly progressive Lisa, much to her dismay and confusion (for much
the same reasons that Fifty Shades of Grey became a worldwide
phenomenon).</p>
<p>When softness and harmlessness become the only consciously acceptable
virtues, then hardness and dominance will start to exert an unconscious
fascination. Partly what this means for the future is that if men are
pushed too hard to feminize, they will become more and more interested
in harsh, fascist political ideology. Fight Club, perhaps the most
fascist popular film made in recent years by Hollywood, with the
possible exception of the Iron Man series, provides a perfect example of
such inevitable attraction. The populist groundswell of support for
Donald Trump in the US is part of the same process, as is (in far more
sinister form) the recent rise of far-right political parties even in
such moderate and liberal places as Holland, Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>Men have to toughen up. Men demand it, and women want it, even though
they may not approve of the harsh and contemptuous attitude that is part
and parcel of the socially demanding process that fosters and then
enforces that toughness. Some women don’t like losing their baby boys,
so they keep them forever. Some women don’t like men, and would rather
have a submissive mate, even if he is useless. This also provides them
with plenty to feel sorry for themselves about, as well. The pleasures
of such self-pity should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Men toughen up by pushing themselves, and by pushing each other. When
I was a teenager, the boys were much more likely to get into car
accidents than the girls (as they still are). This was because they were
out spinning donuts at night in icy parking lots. They were drag racing
and driving their cars over the roadless hills extending from the nearby
river up to the level land hundreds of feet higher. They were more
likely to fight physically, and to skip class, and to tell the teachers
off, and to quit school because they were tired of raising their hands
for permission to go to the bathroom when they were big and strong
enough to work on the oil rigs. They were more likely to race their
motorbikes on frozen lakes in the winter. Like the skateboarders, and
crane climbers, and free runners, they were doing dangerous things,
trying to make themselves useful. When this process goes too far, boys
(and men) drift into the antisocial behavior which is far more prevalent
in males than in females.206 That does not mean that every manifestation
of daring and courage is criminal.</p>
<p>When the boys were spinning donuts, they were also testing the limits
of their cars, their ability as drivers, and their capacity for control,
in an out-of-control situation. When they told off the teachers, they
were pushing against authority, to see if there was any real authority
there—the kind that could be relied on, in principle, in a crisis. When
they quit school, they went to work as rig roughnecks when it was forty
bloody degrees below zero. It wasn’t weakness that propelled so many out
of the classroom, where a better future arguably awaited. It was
strength.</p>
<p>If they’re healthy, women don’t want boys. They want men. They want
someone to contend with; someone to grapple with. If they’re tough, they
want someone tougher. If they’re smart, they want someone smarter. They
desire someone who brings to the table something they can’t already
provide. This often makes it hard for tough, smart, attractive women to
find mates: there just aren’t that many men around who can outclass them
enough to be considered desirable (who are higher, as one research
publication put it, in “income, education, self-confidence,
intelligence, dominance and social position”).207 The spirit that
interferes when boys are trying to become men is, therefore, no more
friend to woman than it is to man. It will object, just as vociferously
and self-righteously (“you can’t do it, it’s too dangerous”) when little
girls try to stand on their own two feet. It negates consciousness. It’s
antihuman, desirous of failure, jealous, resentful and destructive. No
one truly on the side of humanity would ally him or herself with such a
thing. No one aiming at moving up would allow him or herself to become
possessed by such a thing. And if you think tough men are dangerous,
wait until you see what weak men are capable of.</p>
<p>Leave children alone when they are skateboarding.</p>
