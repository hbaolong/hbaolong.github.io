<h4 id="overture">Overture</h4>
<p>This book has a short history and a long history. We’ll begin with
the short history.</p>
<p>In 2012, I started contributing to a website called Quora. On Quora,
anyone can ask a question, of any sort—and anyone can answer. Readers
upvote those answers they like, and downvote those they don’t. In this
manner, the most useful answers rise to the top, while the others sink
into oblivion. I was curious about the site. I liked its free-for-all
nature. The discussion was often compelling, and it was interesting to
see the diverse range of opinions generated by the same question.</p>
<p>When I was taking a break (or avoiding work), I often turned to
Quora, looking for questions to engage with. I considered, and
eventually answered, such questions as “What’s the difference between
being happy and being content?”, “What things get better as you age?”
and “What makes life more meaningful?”</p>
<p>Quora tells you how many people have viewed your answer and how many
upvotes you received. Thus, you can determine your reach, and see what
people think of your ideas. Only a small minority of those who view an
answer upvote it. As of July 2017, as I write this—and five years after
I addressed “What makes life more meaningful?”—my answer to that
question has received a relatively small audience (14,000 views, and 133
upvotes), while my response to the question about aging has been viewed
by 7,200 people and received 36 upvotes. Not exactly home runs. However,
it’s to be expected. On such sites, most answers receive very little
attention, while a tiny minority become disproportionately popular.</p>
<p>Soon after, I answered another question: “What are the most valuable
things everyone should know?” I wrote a list of rules, or maxims; some
dead serious, some tongue-in-cheek—“Be grateful in spite of your
suffering,” “Do not do things that you hate,” “Do not hide things in the
fog,” and so on. The Quora readers appeared pleased with this list. They
commented on and shared it. They said such things as “I’m definitely
printing this list out and keeping it as a reference. Simply
phenomenal,” and “You win Quora. We can just close the site now.”
Students at the University of Toronto, where I teach, came up to me and
told me how much they liked it. To date, my answer to “What are the most
valuable things …” has been viewed by a hundred and twenty thousand
people and been upvoted twenty-three hundred times. Only a few hundred
of the roughly six hundred thousand questions on Quora have cracked the
two-thousand-upvote barrier. My procrastination-induced musings hit a
nerve. I had written a 99.9 percentile answer.</p>
<p>It was not obvious to me when I wrote the list of rules for living
that it was going to perform so well. I had put a fair bit of care into
all the sixty or so answers I submitted in the few months surrounding
that post. Nonetheless, Quora provides market research at its finest.
The respondents are anonymous. They’re disinterested, in the best sense.
Their opinions are spontaneous and unbiased. So, I paid attention to the
results, and thought about the reasons for that answer’s
disproportionate success. Perhaps I struck the right balance between the
familiar and the unfamiliar while formulating the rules. Perhaps people
were drawn to the structure that such rules imply. Perhaps people just
like lists.</p>
<p>A few months earlier, in March of 2012, I had received an email from
a literary agent. She had heard me speak on CBC radio during a show
entitled Just Say No to Happiness, where I had criticized the idea that
happiness was the proper goal for life. Over the previous decades I had
read more than my share of dark books about the twentieth century,
focusing particularly on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn, the great documenter of the slave-labour-camp horrors of
the latter, once wrote that the “pitiful ideology” holding that “human
beings are created for happiness” was an ideology “done in by the first
blow of the work assigner’s cudgel.”1 In a crisis, the inevitable
suffering that life entails can rapidly make a mockery of the idea that
happiness is the proper pursuit of the individual. On the radio show, I
suggested, instead, that a deeper meaning was required. I noted that the
nature of such meaning was constantly re-presented in the great stories
of the past, and that it had more to do with developing character in the
face of suffering than with happiness. This is part of the long history
of the present work.</p>
<p>From 1985 until 1999 I worked for about three hours a day on the only
other book I have ever published: Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of
Belief. During that time, and in the years since, I also taught a course
on the material in that book, first at Harvard, and now at the
University of Toronto. In 2013, observing the rise of YouTube, and
because of the popularity of some work I had done with TVO, a Canadian
public TV station, I decided to film my university and public lectures
and place them online. They attracted an increasingly large
audience—more than a million views by April 2016. The number of views
has risen very dramatically since then (up to eighteen million as I
write this), but that is in part because I became embroiled in a
political controversy that drew an inordinate amount of attention.</p>
<p>That’s another story. Maybe even another book.</p>
<p>I proposed in Maps of Meaning that the great myths and religious
stories of the past, particularly those derived from an earlier, oral
tradition, were moral in their intent, rather than descriptive. Thus,
they did not concern themselves with what the world was, as a scientist
might have it, but with how a human being should act. I suggested that
our ancestors portrayed the world as a stage—a drama—instead of a place
of objects. I described how I had come to believe that the constituent
elements of the world as drama were order and chaos, and not material
things.</p>
<p>Order is where the people around you act according to well-understood
social norms, and remain predictable and cooperative. It’s the world of
social structure, explored territory, and familiarity. The state of
Order is typically portrayed, symbolically—imaginatively—as masculine.
It’s the Wise King and the Tyrant, forever bound together, as society is
simultaneously structure and oppression.</p>
<p>Chaos, by contrast, is where—or when—something unexpected happens.
Chaos emerges, in trivial form, when you tell a joke at a party with
people you think you know and a silent and embarrassing chill falls over
the gathering. Chaos is what emerges more catastrophically when you
suddenly find yourself without employment, or are betrayed by a lover.
As the antithesis of symbolically masculine order, it’s presented
imaginatively as feminine. It’s the new and unpredictable suddenly
emerging in the midst of the commonplace familiar. It’s Creation and
Destruction, the source of new things and the destination of the dead
(as nature, as opposed to culture, is simultaneously birth and
demise).</p>
<p>Order and chaos are the yang and yin of the famous Taoist symbol: two
serpents, head to tail.fn1 Order is the white, masculine serpent; Chaos,
its black, feminine counterpart. The black dot in the white—and the
white in the black—indicate the possibility of transformation: just when
things seem secure, the unknown can loom, unexpectedly and large.
Conversely, just when everything seems lost, new order can emerge from
catastrophe and chaos.</p>
<p>For the Taoists, meaning is to be found on the border between the
ever-entwined pair. To walk that border is to stay on the path of life,
the divine Way.</p>
<p>And that’s much better than happiness.</p>
<p>The literary agent I referred to listened to the CBC radio broadcast
where I discussed such issues. It left her asking herself deeper
questions. She emailed me, asking if I had considered writing a book for
a general audience. I had previously attempted to produce a more
accessible version of Maps of Meaning, which is a very dense book. But I
found that the spirit was neither in me during that attempt nor in the
resultant manuscript. I think this was because I was imitating my former
self, and my previous book, instead of occupying the place between order
and chaos and producing something new. I suggested that she watch four
of the lectures I had done for a TVO program called Big Ideas on my
YouTube channel. I thought if she did that we could have a more informed
and thorough discussion about what kind of topics I might address in a
more publicly accessible book.</p>
<p>She contacted me a few weeks later, after watching all four lectures
and discussing them with a colleague. Her interest had been further
heightened, as had her commitment to the project. That was promising—and
unexpected. I’m always surprised when people respond positively to what
I am saying, given its seriousness and strange nature. I’m amazed I have
been allowed (even encouraged) to teach what I taught first in Boston
and now in Toronto. I’ve always thought that if people really noticed
what I was teaching there would be Hell to pay. You can decide for
yourself what truth there might be in that concern after reading this
book. :)</p>
<p>She suggested that I write a guide of sorts to what a person needs
“to live well”—whatever that might mean. I thought immediately about my
Quora list. I had in the meantime written some further thoughts about of
the rules I had posted. People had responded positively toward those new
ideas, as well. It seemed to me, therefore, that there might be a nice
fit between the Quora list and my new agent’s ideas. So, I sent her the
list. She liked it.</p>
<p>At about the same time, a friend and former student of mine—the
novelist and screenwriter Gregg Hurwitz—was considering a new book,
which would become the bestselling thriller Orphan X. He liked the
rules, too. He had Mia, the book’s female lead, post a selection of
them, one by one, on her fridge, at points in the story where they
seemed apropos. That was another piece of evidence supporting my
supposition of their attractiveness. I suggested to my agent that I
write a brief chapter on each of the rules. She agreed, so I wrote a
book proposal suggesting as much. When I started writing the actual
chapters, however, they weren’t at all brief. I had much more to say
about each rule than I originally envisioned.</p>
<p>This was partly because I had spent a very long time researching my
first book: studying history, mythology, neuroscience, psychoanalysis,
child psychology, poetry, and large sections of the Bible. I read and
perhaps even understood much of Milton’s Paradise Lost, Goethe’s Faust
and Dante’s Inferno. I integrated all of that, for better or worse,
trying to address a perplexing problem: the reason or reasons for the
nuclear standoff of the Cold War. I couldn’t understand how belief
systems could be so important to people that they were willing to risk
the destruction of the world to protect them. I came to realize that
shared belief systems made people intelligible to one another—and that
the systems weren’t just about belief.</p>
<p>People who live by the same code are rendered mutually predictable to
one another. They act in keeping with each other’s expectations and
desires. They can cooperate. They can even compete peacefully, because
everyone knows what to expect from everyone else. A shared belief
system, partly psychological, partly acted out, simplifies everyone—in
their own eyes, and in the eyes of others. Shared beliefs simplify the
world, as well, because people who know what to expect from one another
can act together to tame the world. There is perhaps nothing more
important than the maintenance of this organization—this simplification.
If it’s threatened, the great ship of state rocks.</p>
<p>It isn’t precisely that people will fight for what they believe. They
will fight, instead, to maintain the match between what they believe,
what they expect, and what they desire. They will fight to maintain the
match between what they expect and how everyone is acting. It is
precisely the maintenance of that match that enables everyone to live
together peacefully, predictably and productively. It reduces
uncertainty and the chaotic mix of intolerable emotions that uncertainty
inevitably produces.</p>
<p>Imagine someone betrayed by a trusted lover. The sacred social
contract obtaining between the two has been violated. Actions speak
louder than words, and an act of betrayal disrupts the fragile and
carefully negotiated peace of an intimate relationship. In the aftermath
of disloyalty, people are seized by terrible emotions: disgust, contempt
(for self and traitor), guilt, anxiety, rage and dread. Conflict is
inevitable, sometimes with deadly results. Shared belief systems—shared
systems of agreed-upon conduct and expectation—regulate and control all
those powerful forces. It’s no wonder that people will fight to protect
something that saves them from being possessed by emotions of chaos and
terror (and after that from degeneration into strife and combat).</p>
<p>There’s more to it, too. A shared cultural system stabilizes human
interaction, but is also a system of value—a hierarchy of value, where
some things are given priority and importance and others are not. In the
absence of such a system of value, people simply cannot act. In fact,
they can’t even perceive, because both action and perception require a
goal, and a valid goal is, by necessity, something valued. We experience
much of our positive emotion in relation to goals. We are not happy,
technically speaking, unless we see ourselves progressing—and the very
idea of progression implies value. Worse yet is the fact that the
meaning of life without positive value is not simply neutral. Because we
are vulnerable and mortal, pain and anxiety are an integral part of
human existence. We must have something to set against the suffering
that is intrinsic to Being.fn2 We must have the meaning inherent in a
profound system of value or the horror of existence rapidly becomes
paramount. Then, nihilism beckons, with its hopelessness and
despair.</p>
<p>So: no value, no meaning. Between value systems, however, there is
the possibility of conflict. We are thus eternally caught between the
most diamantine rock and the hardest of places: loss of group-centred
belief renders life chaotic, miserable, intolerable; presence of
group-centred belief makes conflict with other groups inevitable. In the
West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even
nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group
conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of
meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all.</p>
<p>While writing Maps of Meaning, I was (also) driven by the realization
that we can no longer afford conflict—certainly not on the scale of the
world conflagrations of the twentieth century. Our technologies of
destruction have become too powerful. The potential consequences of war
are literally apocalyptic. But we cannot simply abandon our systems of
value, our beliefs, our cultures, either. I agonized over this
apparently intractable problem for months. Was there a third way,
invisible to me? I dreamt one night during this period that I was
suspended in mid-air, clinging to a chandelier, many stories above the
ground, directly under the dome of a massive cathedral. The people on
the floor below were distant and tiny. There was a great expanse between
me and any wall—and even the peak of the dome itself.</p>
<p>I have learned to pay attention to dreams, not least because of my
training as a clinical psychologist. Dreams shed light on the dim places
where reason itself has yet to voyage. I have studied Christianity a
fair bit, too (more than other religious traditions, although I am
always trying to redress this lack). Like others, therefore, I must and
do draw more from what I do know than from what I do not. I knew that
cathedrals were constructed in the shape of a cross, and that the point
under the dome was the centre of the cross. I knew that the cross was
simultaneously, the point of greatest suffering, the point of death and
transformation, and the symbolic centre of the world. That was not
somewhere I wanted to be. I managed to get down, out of the heights—out
of the symbolic sky—back to safe, familiar, anonymous ground. I don’t
know how. Then, still in my dream, I returned to my bedroom and my bed
and tried to return to sleep and the peace of unconsciousness. As I
relaxed, however, I could feel my body transported. A great wind was
dissolving me, preparing to propel me back to the cathedral, to place me
once again at that central point. There was no escape. It was a true
nightmare. I forced myself awake. The curtains behind me were blowing in
over my pillows. Half asleep, I looked at the foot of the bed. I saw the
great cathedral doors. I shook myself completely awake and they
disappeared.</p>
<p>My dream placed me at the centre of Being itself, and there was no
escape. It took me months to understand what this meant. During this
time, I came to a more complete, personal realization of what the great
stories of the past continually insist upon: the centre is occupied by
the individual. The centre is marked by the cross, as X marks the spot.
Existence at that cross is suffering and transformation—and that fact,
above all, needs to be voluntarily accepted. It is possible to transcend
slavish adherence to the group and its doctrines and, simultaneously, to
avoid the pitfalls of its opposite extreme, nihilism. It is possible,
instead, to find sufficient meaning in individual consciousness and
experience.</p>
<p>How could the world be freed from the terrible dilemma of conflict,
on the one hand, and psychological and social dissolution, on the other?
The answer was this: through the elevation and development of the
individual, and through the willingness of everyone to shoulder the
burden of Being and to take the heroic path. We must each adopt as much
responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world.
We must each tell the truth and repair what is in disrepair and break
down and recreate what is old and outdated. It is in this manner that we
can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world. It’s asking a
lot. It’s asking for everything. But the alternative—the horror of
authoritarian belief, the chaos of the collapsed state, the tragic
catastrophe of the unbridled natural world, the existential angst and
weakness of the purposeless individual—is clearly worse.</p>
<p>I have been thinking and lecturing about such ideas for decades. I
have built up a large corpus of stories and concepts pertaining to them.
I am not for a moment claiming, however, that I am entirely correct or
complete in my thinking. Being is far more complicated than one person
can know, and I don’t have the whole story. I’m simply offering the best
I can manage.</p>
<p>In any case, the consequence of all that previous research and
thinking was the new essays which eventually became this book. My
initial idea was to write a short essay on all forty of the answers I
had provided to Quora. That proposal was accepted by Penguin Random
House Canada. While writing, however, I cut the essay number to
twenty-five and then to sixteen and then finally, to the current twelve.
I’ve been editing that remainder, with the help and care of my official
editor (and with the vicious and horribly accurate criticism of Hurwitz,
mentioned previously) for the past three years.</p>
<p>It took a long time to settle on a title: 12 Rules for Life: An
Antidote to Chaos. Why did that one rise up above all others? First and
foremost, because of its simplicity. It indicates clearly that people
need ordering principles, and that chaos otherwise beckons. We require
rules, standards, values—alone and together. We’re pack animals, beasts
of burden. We must bear a load, to justify our miserable existence. We
require routine and tradition. That’s order. Order can become excessive,
and that’s not good, but chaos can swamp us, so we drown—and that is
also not good. We need to stay on the straight and narrow path. Each of
the twelve rules of this book—and their accompanying essays—therefore
provide a guide to being there. “There” is the dividing line between
order and chaos. That’s where we are simultaneously stable enough,
exploring enough, transforming enough, repairing enough, and cooperating
enough. It’s there we find the meaning that justifies life and its
inevitable suffering. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we would be able to
tolerate the weight of our own self-consciousness. Perhaps, if we lived
properly, we could withstand the knowledge of our own fragility and
mortality, without the sense of aggrieved victimhood that produces,
first, resentment, then envy, and then the desire for vengeance and
destruction. Perhaps, if we lived properly, we wouldn’t have to turn to
totalitarian certainty to shield ourselves from the knowledge of our own
insufficiency and ignorance. Perhaps we could come to avoid those
pathways to Hell—and we have seen in the terrible twentieth century just
how real Hell can be.</p>
<p>I hope that these rules and their accompanying essays will help
people understand what they already know: that the soul of the
individual eternally hungers for the heroism of genuine Being, and that
the willingness to take on that responsibility is identical to the
decision to live a meaningful life.</p>
<p>If we each live properly, we will collectively flourish.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you all, as you proceed through these pages.</p>
