<h4 id="rule-8">RULE 8</h4>
<p>TELL THE TRUTH—OR, AT LEAST, DON’T LIE</p>
<p>TRUTH IN NO-MAN’S-LAND</p>
<p>I trained to become a clinical psychologist at McGill University, in
Montreal. While doing so, I sometimes met my classmates on the grounds
of Montreal’s Douglas Hospital, where we had our first direct
experiences with the mentally ill. The Douglas occupies acres of land
and dozens of buildings. Many are connected by underground tunnels to
protect workers and patients from the interminable Montreal winters. The
hospital once sheltered hundreds of long-term in-house patients. This
was before anti-psychotic drugs and the large scale
deinstitutionalization movements of the late sixties all but closed down
the residential asylums, most often dooming the now “freed” patients to
a much harder life on the streets. By the early eighties, when I first
visited the grounds, all but the most seriously afflicted residents had
been discharged. Those who remained were strange, much-damaged people.
They clustered around the vending machines scattered throughout the
hospital’s tunnels. They looked as if they had been photographed by
Diane Arbus or painted by Hieronymus Bosch.</p>
<p>One day my classmates and I were all standing in line. We were
awaiting further instruction from the strait-laced German psychologist
who ran the Douglas clinical training program. A long-term inpatient,
fragile and vulnerable, approached one of the other students, a
sheltered, conservative young woman. The patient spoke to her in a
friendly, childlike manner, and asked, “Why are you all standing here?
What are you doing? Can I come along with you?” My classmate turned to
me and asked uncertainly, “What should I say to her?” She was taken
aback, just as I was, by this request coming from someone so isolated
and hurt. Neither of us wanted to say anything that might be construed
as a rejection or reprimand.</p>
<p>We had temporarily entered a kind of no-man’s-land, in which society
offers no ground rules or guidance. We were new clinical students,
unprepared to be confronted on the grounds of a mental hospital by a
schizophrenic patient asking a naive, friendly question about the
possibility of social belonging. The natural conversational
give-and-take between people attentive to contextual cues was not
happening here, either. What exactly were the rules, in such a
situation, far outside the boundaries of normal social interaction? What
exactly were the options?</p>
<p>There were only two, as far as I could quickly surmise. I could tell
the patient a story designed to save everyone’s face, or I could answer
truthfully. “We can only take eight people in our group,” would have
fallen into the first category, as would have, “We are just leaving the
hospital now.” Neither of these answers would have bruised any feelings,
at least on the surface, and the presence of the status differences that
divided us from her would have gone unremarked. But neither answer would
have been exactly true. So, I didn’t offer either.</p>
<p>I told the patient as simply and directly as I could that we were new
students, training to be psychologists, and that she couldn’t join us
for that reason. The answer highlighted the distinction between her
situation and ours, making the gap between us greater and more evident.
The answer was harsher than a well-crafted white lie. But I already had
an inkling that untruth, however well-meant, can produce unintended
consequences. She looked crestfallen, and hurt, but only for a moment.
Then she understood, and it was all right. That was just how it was.</p>
<p>I had had a strange set of experiences a few years before embarking
upon my clinical training.148 I found myself subject to some rather
violent compulsions (none acted upon), and developed the conviction, in
consequence, that I really knew rather little about who I was and what I
was up to. So, I began paying much closer attention to what I was
doing—and saying. The experience was disconcerting, to say the least. I
soon divided myself into two parts: one that spoke, and one, more
detached, that paid attention and judged. I soon came to realize that
almost everything I said was untrue. I had motives for saying these
things: I wanted to win arguments and gain status and impress people and
get what I wanted. I was using language to bend and twist the world into
delivering what I thought was necessary. But I was a fake. Realizing
this, I started to practise only saying things that the internal voice
would not object to. I started to practise telling the truth—or, at
least, not lying. I soon learned that such a skill came in very handy
when I didn’t know what to do. What should you do, when you don’t know
what to do? Tell the truth. So, that’s what I did my first day at the
Douglas Hospital.</p>
<p>Later, I had a client who was paranoid and dangerous. Working with
paranoid people is challenging. They believe they have been targeted by
mysterious conspiratorial forces, working malevolently behind the
scenes. Paranoid people are hyper-alert and hyper-focused. They are
attending to non-verbal cues with an intentness never manifest during
ordinary human interactions. They make mistakes in interpretation
(that’s the paranoia) but they are still almost uncanny in their ability
to detect mixed motives, judgment and falsehood. You have to listen very
carefully and tell the truth if you are going to get a paranoid person
to open up to you.</p>
<p>I listened carefully and spoke truthfully to my client. Now and then,
he would describe blood-curdling fantasies of flaying people for
revenge. I would watch how I was reacting. I paid attention to what
thoughts and images emerged in the theatre of my imagination while he
spoke, and I told him what I observed. I was not trying to control or
direct his thoughts or actions (or mine). I was only trying to let him
know as transparently as I could how what he was doing was directly
affecting at least one person—me. My careful attention and frank
responses did not mean at all that I remained unperturbed, let alone
approved. I told him when he scared me (often), that his words and
behaviour were misguided, and that he was going to get into serious
trouble.</p>
<p>He talked to me, nonetheless, because I listened and responded
honestly, even though I was not encouraging in my responses. He trusted
me, despite (or, more accurately, because of) my objections. He was
paranoid, not stupid. He knew his behaviour was socially unacceptable.
He knew that any decent person was likely to react with horror to his
insane fantasies. He trusted me and would talk to me because that’s how
I reacted. There was no chance of understanding him without that
trust.</p>
<p>Trouble for him generally started in a bureaucracy, such as a bank.
He would enter an institution and attempt some simple task. He was
looking to open an account, or pay a bill, or fix some mistake. Now and
then he encountered the kind of non-helpful person that everyone
encounters now and then in such a place. That person would reject the ID
he offered, or require some information that was unnecessary and
difficult to obtain. Sometimes, I suppose, the bureaucratic runaround
was unavoidable—but sometimes it was unnecessarily complicated by petty
misuses of bureaucratic power. My client was very attuned to such
things. He was obsessed with honour. It was more important to him than
safety, freedom or belonging. Following that logic (because paranoid
people are impeccably logical), he could never allow himself to be
demeaned, insulted or put down, even a little bit, by anyone. Water did
not roll off his back. Because of his rigid and inflexible attitude, my
client’s actions had already been subjected to several restraining
orders. Restraining orders work best, however, with the sort of person
who would never require a restraining order.</p>
<p>“I will be your worst nightmare,” was his phrase of choice, in such
situations. I have wished intensely that I could say something like
that, after encountering unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles, but it’s
generally best to let such things go. My client meant what he said,
however, and sometimes he really did become someone’s nightmare. He was
the bad guy in No Country for Old Men. He was the person you meet in the
wrong place, at the wrong time. If you messed with him, even
accidentally, he was going to stalk you, remind you what you had done,
and scare the living daylights out of you. He was no one to lie to. I
told him the truth and that cooled him off.</p>
<p>My Landlord</p>
<p>I had a landlord around that time who had been president of a local
biker gang. My wife, Tammy, and I lived next door to him in his parents’
small apartment building. His girlfriend bore the marks of
self-inflicted injuries characteristic of borderline personality
disorder. She killed herself while we lived there.</p>
<p>Denis, large, strong, French-Canadian, with a grey beard, was a
gifted amateur electrician. He had some artistic talent, too, and was
supporting himself making laminated wood posters with custom neon
lights. He was trying to stay sober, after being released from jail.
Still, every month or so, he would disappear on a days-long bender. He
was one of those men who have a miraculous capacity for alcohol; he
could drink fifty or sixty beer in a two-day binge and remain standing
the whole time. This may seem hard to believe, but it’s true. I was
doing research on familial alcoholism at the time, and it was not rare
for my subjects to report their fathers’ habitual consumption of forty
ounces of vodka a day. These patriarchs would buy one bottle every
afternoon, Monday through Friday, and then two on Saturday, to tide them
over through the Sunday liquor-store closure.</p>
<p>Denis had a little dog. Sometimes Tammy and I would hear Denis and
the dog out in the backyard at four in the morning, during one of
Denis’s marathon drinking sessions, both of them howling madly at the
moon. Now and then, on occasions like that, Denis would drink up every
cent he had saved. Then he would show up at our apartment. We would hear
a knock at night. Denis would be at the door, swaying precipitously,
upright, and miraculously conscious.</p>
<p>He would be standing there, toaster, microwave, or poster in hand. He
wanted to sell these to me so he could keep on drinking. I bought a few
things like this, pretending that I was being charitable. Eventually,
Tammy convinced me that I couldn’t do it anymore. It made her nervous,
and it was bad for Denis, whom she liked. Reasonable and even necessary
as her request was, it still placed me in a tricky position.</p>
<p>What do you say to a severely intoxicated, violence-prone
ex-biker-gang-president with patchy English when he tries to sell his
microwave to you at your open door at two in the morning? This was a
question even more difficult than those presented by the
institutionalized patient or the paranoid flayer. But the answer was the
same: the truth. But you’d bloody well better know what the truth
is.</p>
<p>Denis knocked again soon after my wife and I had talked. He looked at
me in the direct skeptical narrow-eyed manner characteristic of the
tough, heavy-drinking man who is no stranger to trouble. That look
means, “Prove your innocence.” Weaving slightly back and forth, he
asked—politely—if I might be interested in purchasing his toaster. I rid
myself, to the bottom of my soul, of primate-dominance motivations and
moral superiority. I told him as directly and carefully as I could that
I would not. I was playing no tricks. In that moment I wasn’t an
educated, anglophone, fortunate, upwardly-mobile young man. He wasn’t an
ex-con Québécois biker with a blood alcohol level of .24. No, we were
two men of good will trying to help each other out in our common
struggle to do the right thing. I said that he had told me he was trying
to quit drinking. I said that it would not be good for him if I provided
him with more money. I said that he made Tammy, whom he respected,
nervous when he came over so drunk and so late and tried to sell me
things.</p>
<p>He glared seriously at me without speaking for about fifteen seconds.
That was plenty long enough. He was watching, I knew, for any
micro-expression revealing sarcasm, deceit, contempt or
self-congratulation. But I had thought it through, carefully, and I had
only said things I truly meant. I had chosen my words, carefully,
traversing a treacherous swamp, feeling out a partially submerged stone
path. Denis turned and left. Not only that, he remembered our
conversation, despite his state of professional-level intoxication. He
didn’t try to sell me anything again. Our relationship, which was quite
good, given the great cultural gaps between us, became even more
solid.</p>
<p>Taking the easy way out or telling the truth—those are not merely two
different choices. They are different pathways through life. They are
utterly different ways of existing.</p>
<p>Manipulate the World</p>
<p>You can use words to manipulate the world into delivering what you
want. This is what it means to “act politically.” This is spin. It’s the
specialty of unscrupulous marketers, salesmen, advertisers, pickup
artists, slogan-possessed utopians and psychopaths. It’s the speech
people engage in when they attempt to influence and manipulate others.
It’s what university students do when they write an essay to please the
professor, instead of articulating and clarifying their own ideas. It’s
what everyone does when they want something, and decide to falsify
themselves to please and flatter. It’s scheming and sloganeering and
propaganda.</p>
<p>To conduct life like this is to become possessed by some ill-formed
desire, and then to craft speech and action in a manner that appears
likely, rationally, to bring about that end. Typical calculated ends
might include “to impose my ideological beliefs,” “to prove that I am
(or was) right,” “to appear competent,” “to ratchet myself up the
dominance hierarchy,” “to avoid responsibility” (or its twin, “to garner
credit for others’ actions”), “to be promoted,” “to attract the lion’s
share of attention,” “to ensure that everyone likes me,” “to garner the
benefits of martyrdom,” “to justify my cynicism,” “to rationalize my
antisocial outlook,” “to minimize immediate conflict,” “to maintain my
naïveté,” “to capitalize on my vulnerability,” “to always appear as the
sainted one,” or (this one is particularly evil) “to ensure that it is
always my unloved child’s fault.” These are all examples of what Sigmund
Freud’s compatriot, the lesser-known Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler,
called “life-lies.”149</p>
<p>Someone living a life-lie is attempting to manipulate reality with
perception, thought and action, so that only some narrowly desired and
pre-defined outcome is allowed to exist. A life lived in this manner is
based, consciously or unconsciously, on two premises. The first is that
current knowledge is sufficient to define what is good, unquestioningly,
far into the future. The second is that reality would be unbearable if
left to its own devices. The first presumption is philosophically
unjustifiable. What you are currently aiming at might not be worth
attaining, just as what you are currently doing might be an error. The
second is even worse. It is valid only if reality is intrinsically
intolerable and, simultaneously, something that can be successfully
manipulated and distorted. Such speaking and thinking requires the
arrogance and certainty that the English poet John Milton’s genius
identified with Satan, God’s highest angel gone most spectacularly
wrong. The faculty of rationality inclines dangerously to pride: all I
know is all that needs to be known. Pride falls in love with its own
creations, and tries to make them absolute.</p>
<p>I have seen people define their utopia and then bend their lives into
knots trying to make it reality. A left-leaning student adopts a trendy,
anti-authority stance and spends the next twenty years working
resentfully to topple the windmills of his imagination. An
eighteen-year-old decides, arbitrarily, that she wants to retire at
fifty-two. She works for three decades to make that happen, failing to
notice that she made that decision when she was little more than a
child. What did she know about her fifty-two-year-old self, when still a
teenager? Even now, many years later, she has only the vaguest,
lowest-resolution idea of her post-work Eden. She refuses to notice.
What did her life mean, if that initial goal was wrong? She’s afraid of
opening Pandora’s box, where all the troubles of the world reside. But
hope is in there, too. Instead, she warps her life to fit the fantasies
of a sheltered adolescent.</p>
<p>A naively formulated goal transmutes, with time, into the sinister
form of the life-lie. One forty-something client told me his vision,
formulated by his younger self: “I see myself retired, sitting on a
tropical beach, drinking margaritas in the sunshine.” That’s not a plan.
That’s a travel poster. After eight margaritas, you’re fit only to await
the hangover. After three weeks of margarita-filled days, if you have
any sense, you’re bored stiff and self-disgusted. In a year, or less,
you’re pathetic. It’s just not a sustainable approach to later life.
This kind of oversimplification and falsification is particularly
typical of ideologues. They adopt a single axiom: government is bad,
immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad. Then they
filter and screen their experiences and insist ever more narrowly that
everything can be explained by that axiom. They believe,
narcissistically, underneath all that bad theory, that the world could
be put right, if only they held the controls.</p>
<p>There is another fundamental problem, too, with the life-lie,
particularly when it is based on avoidance. A sin of commission occurs
when you do something you know to be wrong. A sin of omission occurs
when you let something bad happen when you could do something to stop
it. The former is regarded, classically, as more serious than the
latter—than avoidance. I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>Consider the person who insists that everything is right in her life.
She avoids conflict, and smiles, and does what she is asked to do. She
finds a niche and hides in it. She does not question authority or put
her own ideas forward, and does not complain when mistreated. She
strives for invisibility, like a fish in the centre of a swarming
school. But a secret unrest gnaws at her heart. She is still suffering,
because life is suffering. She is lonesome and isolated and unfulfilled.
But her obedience and self-obliteration eliminate all the meaning from
her life. She has become nothing but a slave, a tool for others to
exploit. She does not get what she wants, or needs, because doing so
would mean speaking her mind. So, there is nothing of value in her
existence to counter-balance life’s troubles. And that makes her
sick.</p>
<p>It might be the noisy troublemakers who disappear, first, when the
institution you serve falters and shrinks. But it’s the invisible who
will be sacrificed next. Someone hiding is not someone vital. Vitality
requires original contribution. Hiding also does not save the conforming
and conventional from disease, insanity, death and taxes. And hiding
from others also means suppressing and hiding the potentialities of the
unrealized self. And that’s the problem.</p>
<p>If you will not reveal yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself
to yourself. That does not only mean that you suppress who you are,
although it also means that. It means that so much of what you could be
will never be forced by necessity to come forward. This is a biological
truth, as well as a conceptual truth. When you explore boldly, when you
voluntarily confront the unknown, you gather information and build your
renewed self out of that information. That is the conceptual element.
However, researchers have recently discovered that new genes in the
central nervous system turn themselves on when an organism is placed (or
places itself) in a new situation. These genes code for new proteins.
These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain.
This means that a lot of you is still nascent, in the most physical of
senses, and will not be called forth by stasis. You have to say
something, go somewhere and do things to get turned on. And, if not …
you remain incomplete, and life is too hard for anyone incomplete.</p>
<p>If you say no to your boss, or your spouse, or your mother, when it
needs to be said, then you transform yourself into someone who can say
no when it needs to be said. If you say yes when no needs to be said,
however, you transform yourself into someone who can only say yes, even
when it is very clearly time to say no. If you ever wonder how perfectly
ordinary, decent people could find themselves doing the terrible things
the gulag camp guards did, you now have your answer. By the time no
seriously needed to be said, there was no one left capable of saying
it.</p>
<p>If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a
lie, you weaken your character. If you have a weak character, then
adversity will mow you down when it appears, as it will, inevitably. You
will hide, but there will be no place left to hide. And then you will
find yourself doing terrible things.</p>
<p>Only the most cynical, hopeless philosophy insists that reality could
be improved through falsification. Such a philosophy judges Being and
becoming alike, and deems them flawed. It denounces truth as
insufficient and the honest man as deluded. It is a philosophy that both
brings about and then justifies the endemic corruption of the world.</p>
<p>It is not vision as such, and not a plan devised to achieve a vision,
that is at fault under such circumstances. A vision of the future, the
desirable future, is necessary. Such a vision links action taken now
with important, long-term, foundational values. It lends actions in the
present significance and importance. It provides a frame limiting
uncertainty and anxiety.</p>
<p>It’s not vision. It is instead willful blindness. It’s the worst sort
of lie. It’s subtle. It avails itself of easy rationalizations. Willful
blindness is the refusal to know something that could be known. It’s
refusal to admit that the knocking sound means someone at the door. It’s
refusal to acknowledge the eight-hundred-pound gorilla in the room, the
elephant under the carpet, the skeleton in the closet. It’s refusal to
admit to error while pursuing the plan. Every game has rules. Some of
the most important rules are implicit. You accept them merely by
deciding to play the game. The first of these rules is that the game is
important. If it wasn’t important, you wouldn’t be playing it. Playing a
game defines it as important. The second is that moves undertaken during
the game are valid if they help you win. If you make a move and it isn’t
helping you win, then, by definition, it’s a bad move. You need to try
something different. You remember the old joke: insanity is doing the
same thing over and over while expecting different results.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky, and you fail, and you try something new, you move
ahead. If that doesn’t work, you try something different again. A minor
modification will suffice in fortunate circumstances. It is therefore
prudent to begin with small changes, and see if they help. Sometimes,
however, the entire hierarchy of values is faulty, and the whole edifice
has to be abandoned. The whole game must be changed. That’s a
revolution, with all the chaos and terror of a revolution. It’s not
something to be engaged in lightly, but it’s sometimes necessary. Error
necessitates sacrifice to correct it, and serious error necessitates
serious sacrifice. To accept the truth means to sacrifice—and if you
have rejected the truth for a long time, then you’ve run up a
dangerously large sacrificial debt. Forest fires burn out deadwood and
return trapped elements to the soil. Sometimes, however, fires are
suppressed, artificially. That does not stop the deadwood from
accumulating. Sooner or later, a fire will start. When it does, it will
burn so hot that everything will be destroyed—even the soil in which the
forest grows.</p>
<p>The prideful, rational mind, comfortable with its certainty,
enamoured of its own brilliance, is easily tempted to ignore error, and
to sweep dirt under the rug. Literary, existential philosophers,
beginning with Søren Kierkegaard, conceived of this mode of Being as
“inauthentic.” An inauthentic person continues to perceive and act in
ways his own experience has demonstrated false. He does not speak with
his own voice.</p>
<p>“Did what I want happen? No. Then my aim or my methods were wrong. I
still have something to learn.” That is the voice of authenticity.</p>
<p>“Did what I want happen? No. Then the world is unfair. People are
jealous, and too stupid to understand. It is the fault of something or
someone else.” That is the voice of inauthenticity. It is not too far
from there to “they should be stopped” or “they must be hurt” or “they
must be destroyed.” Whenever you hear about something incomprehensibly
brutal, such ideas have manifested themselves.</p>
<p>There is no blaming any of this on unconsciousness, either, or
repression. When the individual lies, he knows it. He may blind himself
to the consequences of his actions. He may fail to analyze and
articulate his past, so that he does not understand. He may even forget
that he lied and so be unconscious of that fact. But he was conscious,
in the present, during the commission of each error, and the omission of
each responsibility. At that moment, he knew what he was up to. And the
sins of the inauthentic individual compound and corrupt the state.</p>
<p>Someone power-hungry makes a new rule at your workplace. It’s
unnecessary. It’s counterproductive. It’s an irritant. It removes some
of the pleasure and meaning from your work. But you tell yourself it’s
all right. It’s not worth complaining about. Then it happens again.
You’ve already trained yourself to allow such things, by failing to
react the first time. You’re a little less courageous. Your opponent,
unopposed, is a little bit stronger. The institution is a little bit
more corrupt. The process of bureaucratic stagnation and oppression is
underway, and you’ve contributed, by pretending that it was OK. Why not
complain? Why not take a stand? If you do, other people, equally afraid
to speak up, may come to your defence. And if not—maybe it’s time for a
revolution. Maybe you should find a job somewhere else, where your soul
is less in danger from corruption.</p>
<p>For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and forfeit
his soul? (Mark 8:36)</p>
<p>One of the major contributions of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s
masterwork, The Gulag Archipelago, was his analysis of the direct causal
relationship between the pathology of the Soviet prison-work-camp
dependent state (where millions suffered and died) and the almost
universal proclivity of the Soviet citizen to falsify his own day-to-day
personal experience, deny his own state-induced suffering, and thereby
prop up the dictates of the rational, ideology-possessed communist
system. It was this bad faith, this denial, that in Solzhenitsyn’s
opinion aided and abetted that great paranoid mass-murderer, Joseph
Stalin, in his crimes. Solzhenitsyn wrote the truth, his truth,
hard-learned through his own experiences in the camps, exposing the lies
of the Soviet state. No educated person dared defend that ideology again
after Solzhenitsyn published The Gulag Archipelago. No one could ever
say again, “What Stalin did, that was not true communism.”</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Nazi concentration camp survivor
who wrote the classic Man’s Search for Meaning, drew a similar
social-psychological conclusion: deceitful, inauthentic individual
existence is the precursor to social totalitarianism. Sigmund Freud, for
his part, analogously believed that “repression” contributed in a
non-trivial manner to the development of mental illness (and the
difference between repression of truth and a lie is a matter of degree,
not kind). Alfred Adler knew it was lies that bred sickness. C.G. Jung
knew that moral problems plagued his patients, and that such problems
were caused by untruth. All these thinkers, all centrally concerned with
pathology both individual and cultural, came to the same conclusion:
lies warp the structure of Being. Untruth corrupts the soul and the
state alike, and one form of corruption feeds the other.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly observed the transformation of mere existential
misery into outright hell by betrayal and deceit. The barely manageable
crisis of a parent’s terminal illness can be turned, for example, into
something awful beyond description by the unseemly and petty squabbling
of the sufferer’s adult children. Obsessed by the unresolved past, they
gather like ghouls around the deathbed, forcing tragedy into an unholy
dalliance with cowardice and resentment.</p>
<p>The inability of a son to thrive independently is exploited by a
mother bent on shielding her child from all disappointment and pain. He
never leaves, and she is never lonely. It’s an evil conspiracy, forged
slowly, as the pathology unfolds, by thousands of knowing winks and
nods. She plays the martyr, doomed to support her son, and garners
nourishing sympathy, like a vampire, from supporting friends. He broods
in his basement, imagining himself oppressed. He fantasizes with delight
about the havoc he might wreak on the world that rejected him for his
cowardice, awkwardness and inability. And sometimes he wreaks precisely
that havoc. And everyone asks, “Why?” They could know, but refuse
to.</p>
<p>Even well-lived lives can, of course, be warped and hurt and twisted
by illness and infirmity and uncontrollable catastrophe. Depression,
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, like cancer, all involve biological
factors beyond the individual’s immediate control. The difficulties
intrinsic to life itself are sufficient to weaken and overwhelm each of
us, pushing us beyond our limits, breaking us at our weakest point. Not
even the best-lived life provides an absolute defence against
vulnerability. But the family that fights in the ruins of their
earthquake-devastated dwelling place is much less likely to rebuild than
the family made strong by mutual trust and devotion. Any natural
weakness or existential challenge, no matter how minor, can be magnified
into a serious crisis with enough deceit in the individual, family or
culture.</p>
<p>The honest human spirit may continually fail in its attempts to bring
about Paradise on Earth. It may manage, however, to reduce the suffering
attendant on existence to bearable levels. The tragedy of Being is the
consequence of our limitations and the vulnerability defining human
experience. It may even be the price we pay for Being itself—since
existence must be limited, to be at all.</p>
<p>I have seen a husband adapt honestly and courageously while his wife
descended into terminal dementia. He made the necessary adjustments,
step by step. He accepted help when he needed it. He refused to deny her
sad deterioration and in that manner adapted gracefully to it. I saw the
family of that same woman come together in a supporting and sustaining
manner as she lay dying, and gain newfound connections with each
other—brother, sisters, grandchildren and father—as partial but genuine
compensation for their loss. I have seen my teenage daughter live
through the destruction of her hip and her ankle and survive two years
of continual, intense pain and emerge with her spirit intact. I watched
her younger brother voluntarily and without resentment sacrifice many
opportunities for friendship and social engagement to stand by her and
us while she suffered. With love, encouragement, and character intact, a
human being can be resilient beyond imagining. What cannot be borne,
however, is the absolute ruin produced by tragedy and deception.</p>
<p>The capacity of the rational mind to deceive, manipulate, scheme,
trick, falsify, minimize, mislead, betray, prevaricate, deny, omit,
rationalize, bias, exaggerate and obscure is so endless, so remarkable,
that centuries of pre-scientific thought, concentrating on clarifying
the nature of moral endeavour, regarded it as positively demonic. This
is not because of rationality itself, as a process. That process can
produce clarity and progress. It is because rationality is subject to
the single worst temptation—to raise what it knows now to the status of
an absolute.</p>
<p>We can turn to the great poet John Milton, once again, to clarify
just what this means. Over thousands of years of history, the Western
world wrapped a dream-like fantasy about the nature of evil around its
central religious core. That fantasy had a protagonist, an adversarial
personality, absolutely dedicated to the corruption of Being. Milton
took it upon himself to organize, dramatize and articulate the essence
of this collective dream, and gave it life, in the figure of
Satan—Lucifer, the “light bearer.” He writes of Lucifer’s primal
temptation, and its immediate consequences:150</p>
<p>He trusted to have equaled the most High,</p>
<p>If he opposed; and with ambitious aim</p>
<p>Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</p>
<p>Raised impious War in Heaven and Battel proud</p>
<p>With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power</p>
<p>Hurled headlong flaming from the Ethereal Sky</p>
<p>With hideous ruin and combustion down</p>
<p>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</p>
<p>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire …</p>
<p>Lucifer, in Milton’s eyes—the spirit of reason—was the most wondrous
angel brought forth from the void by God. This can be read
psychologically. Reason is something alive. It lives in all of us. It’s
older than any of us. It’s best understood as a personality, not a
faculty. It has its aims, and its temptations, and its weaknesses. It
flies higher and sees farther than any other spirit. But reason falls in
love with itself, and worse. It falls in love with its own productions.
It elevates them, and worships them as absolutes. Lucifer is, therefore,
the spirit of totalitarianism. He is flung from Heaven into Hell because
such elevation, such rebellion against the Highest and Incomprehensible,
inevitably produces Hell.</p>
<p>To say it again: it is the greatest temptation of the rational
faculty to glorify its own capacity and its own productions and to claim
that in the face of its theories nothing transcendent or outside its
domain need exist. This means that all important facts have been
discovered. This means that nothing important remains unknown. But most
importantly, it means denial of the necessity for courageous individual
confrontation with Being. What is going to save you? The totalitarian
says, in essence, “You must rely on faith in what you already know.” But
that is not what saves. What saves is the willingness to learn from what
you don’t know. That is faith in the possibility of human
transformation. That is faith in the sacrifice of the current self for
the self that could be. The totalitarian denies the necessity for the
individual to take ultimate responsibility for Being.</p>
<p>That denial is the meaning of rebellion against “the most High.” That
is what totalitarian means: Everything that needs to be discovered has
been discovered. Everything will unfold precisely as planned. All
problems will vanish, forever, once the perfect system is accepted.
Milton’s great poem was a prophecy. As rationality rose ascendant from
the ashes of Christianity, the great threat of total systems accompanied
it. Communism, in particular, was attractive not so much to oppressed
workers, its hypothetical beneficiaries, but to intellectuals—to those
whose arrogant pride in intellect assured them they were always right.
But the promised utopia never emerged. Instead humanity experienced the
inferno of Stalinist Russia and Mao’s China and Pol Pot’s Cambodia, and
the citizens of those states were required to betray their own
experience, turn against their fellow citizens, and die in the tens of
millions.</p>
<p>There is an old Soviet joke. An American dies and goes to hell. Satan
himself shows him around. They pass a large cauldron. The American peers
in. It’s full of suffering souls, burning in hot pitch. As they struggle
to leave the pot, low-ranking devils, sitting on the rim, pitchfork them
back in. The American is properly shocked. Satan says, “That’s where we
put sinful Englishmen.” The tour continues. Soon the duo approaches a
second cauldron. It’s slightly larger, and slightly hotter. The American
peers in. It is also full of suffering souls, all wearing berets. Devils
are pitchforking would-be escapees back into this cauldron, as well.
“That’s where we put sinful Frenchmen,” Satan says. In the distance is a
third cauldron. It’s much bigger, and is glowing, white hot. The
American can barely get near it. Nonetheless, at Satan’s insistence, he
approaches it and peers in. It is absolutely packed with souls, barely
visible, under the surface of the boiling liquid. Now and then, however,
one clambers out of the pitch and desperately reaches for the rim.
Oddly, there are no devils sitting on the edge of this giant pot, but
the clamberer disappears back under the surface anyway. The American
asks, “Why are there no demons here to keep everyone from escaping?”
Satan replies, “This is where we put the Russians. If one tries to
escape, the others pull him back in.”</p>
<p>Milton believed that stubborn refusal to change in the face of error
not only meant ejection from heaven, and subsequent degeneration into an
ever-deepening hell, but the rejection of redemption itself. Satan knows
full well that even if he was willing to seek reconciliation, and God
willing to grant it, he would only rebel again, because he will not
change. Perhaps it is this prideful stubbornness that constitutes the
mysterious unforgivable sin against the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>… Farewell happy Fields</p>
<p>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrors, hail</p>
<p>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</p>
<p>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings</p>
<p>A mind not to be changed by Place or Time.151</p>
<p>This is no afterlife fantasy. This is no perverse realm of
post-existence torture for political enemies. This is an abstract idea,
and abstractions are often more real than what they represent. The idea
that hell exists in some metaphysical manner is not only ancient, and
pervasive; it’s true. Hell is eternal. It has always existed. It exists
now. It’s the most barren, hopeless and malevolent subdivision of the
underworld of chaos, where disappointed and resentful people forever
dwell.</p>
<p>The mind is its own place, and in itself</p>
<p>Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.152</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Here we may reign secure, and in my choice</p>
<p>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</p>
<p>Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav’n.153</p>
<p>Those who have lied enough, in word and action, live there, in
hell—now. Take a walk down any busy urban street. Keep your eyes open
and pay attention. You will see people who are there, now. These are the
people to whom you instinctively give a wide berth. These are the people
who are immediately angered if you direct your gaze toward them,
although sometimes they will instead turn away in shame. I saw a
horribly damaged street alcoholic do exactly that in the presence of my
young daughter. He wanted above all to avoid seeing his degraded state
incontrovertibly reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p>It is deceit that makes people miserable beyond what they can bear.
It is deceit that fills human souls with resentment and vengefulness. It
is deceit that produces the terrible suffering of mankind: the death
camps of the Nazis; the torture chambers and genocides of Stalin and
that even greater monster, Mao. It was deceit that killed hundreds of
millions of people in the twentieth century. It was deceit that almost
doomed civilization itself. It is deceit that still threatens us, most
profoundly, today.</p>
<p>The Truth, Instead</p>
<p>What happens if, instead, we decide to stop lying? What does this
even mean? We are limited in our knowledge, after all. We must make
decisions, here and now, even though the best means and the best goals
can never be discerned with certainty. An aim, an ambition, provides the
structure necessary for action. An aim provides a destination, a point
of contrast against the present, and a framework, within which all
things can be evaluated. An aim defines progress and makes such progress
exciting. An aim reduces anxiety, because if you have no aim everything
can mean anything or nothing, and neither of those two options makes for
a tranquil spirit. Thus, we have to think, and plan, and limit, and
posit, in order to live at all. How then to envision the future, and
establish our direction, without falling prey to the temptation of
totalitarian certainty?</p>
<p>Some reliance on tradition can help us establish our aims. It is
reasonable to do what other people have always done, unless we have a
very good reason not to. It is reasonable to become educated and work
and find love and have a family. That is how culture maintains itself.
But it is necessary to aim at your target, however traditional, with
your eyes wide open. You have a direction, but it might be wrong. You
have a plan, but it might be ill-formed. You may have been led astray by
your own ignorance—and, worse, by your own unrevealed corruption. You
must make friends, therefore, with what you don’t know, instead of what
you know. You must remain awake to catch yourself in the act. You must
remove the beam in your own eye, before you concern yourself with the
mote in your brother’s. And in this way, you strengthen your own spirit,
so it can tolerate the burden of existence, and you rejuvenate the
state.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians had already figured this out thousands of years
ago, although their knowledge remained embodied in dramatic form.154
They worshipped Osiris, mythological founder of the state and the god of
tradition. Osiris, however, was vulnerable to overthrow and banishment
to the underworld by Set, his evil, scheming brother. The Egyptians
represented in story the fact that social organizations ossify with
time, and tend towards willful blindness. Osiris would not see his
brother’s true character, even though he could have. Set waits and, at
an opportune moment, attacks. He hacks Osiris into pieces, and scatters
the divine remains through the kingdom. He sends his brother’s spirit to
the underworld. He makes it very difficult for Osiris to pull himself
back together.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the great king did not have to deal with Set on his own.
The Egyptians also worshipped Horus, the son of Osiris. Horus took the
twin forms of a falcon, the most visually acute of all creatures, and
the still-famous hieroglyphic single Egyptian eye (as alluded to in Rule
7). Osiris is tradition, aged and willfully blind. Horus, his son, could
and would, by contrast, see. Horus was the god of attention. That is not
the same as rationality. Because he paid attention, Horus could perceive
and triumph against the evils of Set, his uncle, albeit at great cost.
When Horus confronts Set, they have a terrible battle. Before Set’s
defeat and banishment from the kingdom, he tears out one of his nephew’s
eyes. But the eventually victorious Horus takes back the eye. Then he
does something truly unexpected: he journeys voluntarily to the
underworld and gives the eye to his father.</p>
<p>What does this mean? First, that the encounter with malevolence and
evil is of sufficient terror to damage even the vision of a god; second,
that the attentive son can restore the vision of his father. Culture is
always in a near-dead state, even though it was established by the
spirit of great people in the past. But the present is not the past. The
wisdom of the past thus deteriorates, or becomes outdated, in proportion
to the genuine difference between the conditions of the present and the
past. That is a mere consequence of the passage of time, and the change
that passage inevitably brings. But it is also the case that culture and
its wisdom is additionally vulnerable to corruption—to voluntary,
willful blindness and Mephistophelean intrigue. Thus, the inevitable
functional decline of the institutions granted to us by our ancestors is
sped along by our misbehavior—our missing of the mark—in the
present.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility to see what is before our eyes,
courageously, and to learn from it, even if it seems horrible—even if
the horror of seeing it damages our consciousness, and half-blinds us.
The act of seeing is particularly important when it challenges what we
know and rely on, upsetting and destabilizing us. It is the act of
seeing that informs the individual and updates the state. It was for
this reason that Nietzsche said that a man’s worth was determined by how
much truth he could tolerate. You are by no means only what you already
know. You are also all that which you could know, if you only would.
Thus, you should never sacrifice what you could be for what you are. You
should never give up the better that resides within for the security you
already have—and certainly not when you have already caught a glimpse,
an undeniable glimpse, of something beyond.</p>
<p>In the Christian tradition, Christ is identified with the Logos. The
Logos is the Word of God. That Word transformed chaos into order at the
beginning of time. In His human form, Christ sacrificed himself
voluntarily to the truth, to the good, to God. In consequence, He died
and was reborn. The Word that produces order from Chaos sacrifices
everything, even itself, to God. That single sentence, wise beyond
comprehension, sums up Christianity. Every bit of learning is a little
death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception,
forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something
better. Sometimes such deaths virtually destroy us. In such cases, we
might never recover or, if we do, we change a lot. A good friend of mine
discovered that his wife of decades was having an affair. He didn’t see
it coming. It plunged him into a deep depression. He descended into the
underworld. He told me, at one point, “I always thought that people who
were depressed should just shake it off. I didn’t have any idea what I
was talking about.” Eventually, he returned from the depths. In many
ways, he’s a new man—and, perhaps, a wiser and better man. He lost forty
pounds. He ran a marathon. He travelled to Africa and climbed Mount
Kilimanjaro. He chose rebirth over descent into Hell.</p>
<p>Set your ambitions, even if you are uncertain about what they should
be. The better ambitions have to do with the development of character
and ability, rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You
carry character with you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail
against adversity. Knowing this, tie a rope to a boulder. Pick up the
great stone, heave it in front of you, and pull yourself towards it.
Watch and observe while you move forward. Articulate your experience as
clearly and carefully to yourself and others as you possibly can. In
this manner, you will learn to proceed more effectively and efficiently
towards your goal. And, while you are doing this, do not lie. Especially
to yourself.</p>
<p>If you pay attention to what you do and say, you can learn to feel a
state of internal division and weakness when you are misbehaving and
misspeaking. It’s an embodied sensation, not a thought. I experience an
internal sensation of sinking and division, rather than solidity and
strength, when I am incautious with my acts and words. It seems to be
centred in my solar plexus, where a large knot of nervous tissue
resides. I learned to recognize when I was lying, in fact, by noticing
this sinking and division, and then inferring the presence of a lie. It
often took me a long time to ferret out the deception. Sometimes I was
using words for appearance. Sometimes I was trying to disguise my own
true ignorance of the topic at hand. Sometimes I was using the words of
others to avoid the responsibility of thinking for myself.</p>
<p>If you pay attention, when you are seeking something, you will move
towards your goal. More importantly, however, you will acquire the
information that allows your goal itself to transform. A totalitarian
never asks, “What if my current ambition is in error?” He treats it,
instead, as the Absolute. It becomes his God, for all intents and
purposes. It constitutes his highest value. It regulates his emotions
and motivational states, and determines his thoughts. All people serve
their ambition. In that matter, there are no atheists. There are only
people who know, and don’t know, what God they serve.</p>
<p>If you bend everything totally, blindly and willfully towards the
attainment of a goal, and only that goal, you will never be able to
discover if another goal would serve you, and the world, better. It is
this that you sacrifice if you do not tell the truth. If, instead, you
tell the truth, your values transform as you progress. If you allow
yourself to be informed by the reality manifesting itself, as you
struggle forward, your notions of what is important will change. You
will reorient yourself, sometimes gradually, and sometimes suddenly and
radically.</p>
<p>Imagine: you go to engineering school, because that is what your
parents desire—but it is not what you want. Working at cross-purposes to
your own wishes, you will find yourself unmotivated, and failing. You
will struggle to concentrate and discipline yourself, but it will not
work. Your soul will reject the tyranny of your will (how else could
that be said?). Why are you complying? You may not want to disappoint
your parents (although if you fail you will do exactly that). You may
lack the courage for the conflict necessary to free yourself. You may
not want to sacrifice your childish belief in parental omniscience,
wishing devoutly to continue believing that there is someone who knows
you better than you know yourself, and who also knows all about the
world. You want to be shielded in this manner from the stark existential
aloneness of individual Being and its attendant responsibility. This is
all very common and understandable. But you suffer because you are truly
not meant to be an engineer.</p>
<p>One day you have had enough. You drop out. You disappoint your
parents. You learn to live with that. You consult only yourself, even
though that means you must rely on your own decisions. You take a
philosophy degree. You accept the burden of your own mistakes. You
become your own person. By rejecting your father’s vision, you develop
your own. And then, as your parents age, you’ve become adult enough to
be there for them, when they come to need you. They win, too. But both
victories had to be purchased at the cost of the conflict engendered by
your truth. As Matthew 10:34 has it, citing Christ—emphasizing the role
of the spoken Truth: “Think not that I have come to send peace on earth:
I came not to send peace, but a sword.”</p>
<p>As you continue to live in accordance with the truth, as it reveals
itself to you, you will have to accept and deal with the conflicts that
mode of Being will generate. If you do so, you will continue to mature
and become more responsible, in small ways (don’t underestimate their
importance) and in large. You will ever more closely approach your newer
and more wisely formulated goals, and become even wiser in their
formulation, when you discover and rectify your inevitable errors. Your
conception of what is important will become more and more appropriate,
as you incorporate the wisdom of your experience. You will quit wildly
oscillating and walk ever more directly towards the good—a good you
could never have comprehended if you had insisted despite all evidence
that you were right, absolutely right, at the beginning.</p>
<p>If existence is good, then the clearest and cleanest and most correct
relationship with it is also good. If existence is not good, by
contrast, you’re lost. Nothing will save you—certainly not the petty
rebellions, murky thinking and obscurantist blindness that constitute
deceit. Is existence good? You have to take a terrible risk to find out.
Live in truth, or live in deceit, face the consequences, and draw your
conclusions.</p>
<p>This is the “act of faith” whose necessity was insisted upon by the
Danish philosopher Kierkegaard. You cannot know ahead of time. Even a
good example is insufficient for proof, given the differences between
individuals. The success of a good example can always be attributed to
luck. Thus, you have to risk your particular, individual life to find
out. It is this risk that the ancients described as the sacrifice of
personal will to the will of God. It is not an act of submission (at
least as submission is currently understood). It is an act of courage.
It is faith that the wind will blow your ship to a new and better port.
It is the faith that Being can be corrected by becoming. It is the
spirit of exploration itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is better to conceptualize it this way: Everyone needs a
concrete, specific goal—an ambition, and a purpose—to limit chaos and
make intelligible sense of his or her life. But all such concrete goals
can and should be subordinated to what might be considered a meta-goal,
which is a way of approaching and formulating goals themselves. The
meta-goal could be “live in truth.” This means, “Act diligently towards
some well-articulated, defined and temporary end. Make your criteria for
failure and success timely and clear, at least for yourself (and even
better if others can understand what you are doing and evaluate it with
you). While doing so, however, allow the world and your spirit to unfold
as they will, while you act out and articulate the truth.” This is both
pragmatic ambition and the most courageous of faiths.</p>
<p>Life is suffering. The Buddha stated that, explicitly. Christians
portray the same sentiment imagistically, with the divine crucifix. The
Jewish faith is saturated with its remembrance. The equivalence of life
and limitation is the primary and unavoidable fact of existence. The
vulnerability of our Being renders us susceptible to the pains of social
judgement and contempt and the inevitable breakdown of our bodies. But
even all those ways of suffering, terrible as they are, are not
sufficient to corrupt the world, to transform it into Hell, the way the
Nazis and the Maoists and the Stalinists corrupted the world and turned
it into Hell. For that, as Hitler stated so clearly, you need the
lie:155</p>
<p>[I]n the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility;
because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in
the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or
voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they
more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they
themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed
to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their
heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that
others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even
though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to
their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think
that there may be some other explanation.</p>
<p>For the big lie, you first need the little lie. The little lie is,
metaphorically speaking, the bait used by the Father of Lies to hook his
victims. The human capacity for imagination makes us capable of dreaming
up and creating alternative worlds. This is the ultimate source of our
creativity. With that singular capacity, however, comes the counterpart,
the opposite side of the coin: we can deceive ourselves and others into
believing and acting as if things are other than we know they are.</p>
<p>And why not lie? Why not twist and distort things to obtain a small
gain, or to smooth things over, or to keep the peace, or to avoid hurt
feelings? Reality has its terrible aspect: do we really need to confront
its snake-headed face in every moment of our waking consciousness, and
at every turn in our lives? Why not turn away, at least, when looking is
simply too painful?</p>
<p>The reason is simple. Things fall apart. What worked yesterday will
not necessarily work today. We have inherited the great machinery of
state and culture from our forefathers, but they are dead, and cannot
deal with the changes of the day. The living can. We can open our eyes
and modify what we have where necessary and keep the machinery running
smoothly. Or we can pretend that everything is alright, fail to make the
necessary repairs, and then curse fate when nothing goes our way.</p>
<p>Things fall apart: this is one of the great discoveries of humanity.
And we speed the natural deterioration of great things through
blindness, inaction and deceit. Without attention, culture degenerates
and dies, and evil prevails.</p>
<p>What you see of a lie when you act it out (and most lies are acted
out, rather than told) is very little of what it actually is. A lie is
connected to everything else. It produces the same effect on the world
that a single drop of sewage produces in even the largest crystal magnum
of champagne. It is something best considered live and growing.</p>
<p>When the lies get big enough, the whole world spoils. But if you look
close enough, the biggest of lies is composed of smaller lies, and those
are composed of still smaller lies—and the smallest of lies is where the
big lie starts. It is not the mere misstatement of fact. It is instead
an act that has the aspect of the most serious conspiracy ever to
possess the race of man. Its seeming innocuousness, its trivial
meanness, the feeble arrogance that gives rise to it, the apparently
trivial circumventing of responsibility that it aims at—these all work
effectively to camouflage its true nature, its genuine dangerousness,
and its equivalence with the great acts of evil that man perpetrates and
often enjoys. Lies corrupt the world. Worse, that is their intent.</p>
<p>First, a little lie; then, several little lies to prop it up. After
that, distorted thinking to avoid the shame that those lies produce,
then a few more lies to cover up the consequences of the distorted
thinking. Then, most terribly, the transformation of those now necessary
lies through practice into automatized, specialized, structural,
neurologically instantiated “unconscious” belief and action. Then the
sickening of experience itself as action predicated on falsehood fails
to produce the results intended. If you don’t believe in brick walls,
you will still be injured when you run headlong into one. Then you will
curse reality itself for producing the wall.</p>
<p>After that comes the arrogance and sense of superiority that
inevitably accompanies the production of successful lies (hypothetically
successful lies—and that is one of the greatest dangers: apparently
everyone is fooled, so everyone is stupid, except me. Everyone is stupid
and fooled, by me—so I can get away with whatever I want). Finally,
there is the proposition: “Being itself is susceptible to my
manipulations. Thus, it deserves no respect.”</p>
<p>That’s things falling apart, like Osiris, severed into pieces. That’s
the structure of the person or the state disintegrating under the
influence of a malign force. That’s the chaos of the underworld
emerging, like a flood, to subsume familiar ground. But it’s not yet
Hell.</p>
<p>Hell comes later. Hell comes when lies have destroyed the
relationship between individual or state and reality itself. Things fall
apart. Life degenerates. Everything becomes frustration and
disappointment. Hope consistently betrays. The deceitful individual
desperately gestures at sacrifice, like Cain, but fails to please God.
Then the drama enters its final act.</p>
<p>Tortured by constant failure, the individual becomes bitter.
Disappointment and failure amalgamate, and produce a fantasy: the world
is bent on my personal suffering, my particular undoing, my destruction.
I need, I deserve, I must have—my revenge. That’s the gateway to Hell.
That’s when the underworld, a terrifying and unfamiliar place, becomes
misery itself.</p>
<p>At the beginning of time, according to the great Western tradition,
the Word of God transformed chaos into Being through the act of speech.
It is axiomatic, within that tradition, that man and woman alike are
made in the image of that God. We also transform chaos into Being,
through speech. We transform the manifold possibilities of the future
into the actualities of past and present.</p>
<p>To tell the truth is to bring the most habitable reality into Being.
Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years. Truth feeds and
clothes the poor, and makes nations wealthy and safe. Truth reduces the
terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he
can become a partner, rather than an enemy. Truth makes the past truly
past, and makes the best use of the future’s possibilities. Truth is the
ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It’s the light in the
darkness.</p>
<p>See the truth. Tell the truth.</p>
<p>Truth will not come in the guise of opinions shared by others, as the
truth is neither a collection of slogans nor an ideology. It will
instead be personal. Your truth is something only you can tell, based as
it is on the unique circumstances of your life. Apprehend your personal
truth. Communicate it carefully, in an articulate manner, to yourself
and others. This will ensure your security and your life more abundantly
now, while you inhabit the structure of your current beliefs. This will
ensure the benevolence of the future, diverging as it might from the
certainties of the past.</p>
<p>The truth springs forth ever anew from the most profound wellsprings
of Being. It will keep your soul from withering and dying while you
encounter the inevitable tragedy of life. It will help you avoid the
terrible desire to seek vengeance for that tragedy—part of the terrible
sin of Being, which everything must bear gracefully, just so it can
exist.</p>
<p>If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you
cling desperately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling the
truth. If you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused, try
telling the truth. In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth. That is what
makes it Paradise.</p>
<p>Tell the truth. Or, at least, don’t lie.</p>
