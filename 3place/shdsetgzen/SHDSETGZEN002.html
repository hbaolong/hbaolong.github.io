<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<p>Rules? More rules? Really? Isn’t life complicated enough, restricting
enough, without abstract rules that don’t take our unique, individual
situations into account? And given that our brains are plastic, and all
develop differently based on our life experiences, why even expect that
a few rules might be helpful to us all?</p>
<p>People don’t clamour for rules, even in the Bible … as when Moses
comes down the mountain, after a long absence, bearing the tablets
inscribed with ten commandments, and finds the Children of Israel in
revelry. They’d been Pharaoh’s slaves and subject to his tyrannical
regulations for four hundred years, and after that Moses subjected them
to the harsh desert wilderness for another forty years, to purify them
of their slavishness. Now, free at last, they are unbridled, and have
lost all control as they dance wildly around an idol, a golden calf,
displaying all manner of corporeal corruption.</p>
<p>“I’ve got some good news … and I’ve got some bad news,” the lawgiver
yells to them. “Which do you want first?”</p>
<p>“The good news!” the hedonists reply.</p>
<p>“I got Him from fifteen commandments down to ten!”</p>
<p>“Hallelujah!” cries the unruly crowd. “And the bad?”</p>
<p>“Adultery is still in.”</p>
<p>So rules there will be—but, please, not too many. We are ambivalent
about rules, even when we know they are good for us. If we are spirited
souls, if we have character, rules seem restrictive, an affront to our
sense of agency and our pride in working out our own lives. Why should
we be judged according to another’s rule?</p>
<p>And judged we are. After all, God didn’t give Moses “The Ten
Suggestions,” he gave Commandments; and if I’m a free agent, my first
reaction to a command might just be that nobody, not even God, tells me
what to do, even if it’s good for me. But the story of the golden calf
also reminds us that without rules we quickly become slaves to our
passions—and there’s nothing freeing about that.</p>
<p>And the story suggests something more: unchaperoned, and left to our
own untutored judgment, we are quick to aim low and worship qualities
that are beneath us—in this case, an artificial animal that brings out
our own animal instincts in a completely unregulated way. The old Hebrew
story makes it clear how the ancients felt about our prospects for
civilized behaviour in the absence of rules that seek to elevate our
gaze and raise our standards.</p>
<p>One neat thing about the Bible story is that it doesn’t simply list
its rules, as lawyers or legislators or administrators might; it embeds
them in a dramatic tale that illustrates why we need them, thereby
making them easier to understand. Similarly, in this book Professor
Peterson doesn’t just propose his twelve rules, he tells stories, too,
bringing to bear his knowledge of many fields as he illustrates and
explains why the best rules do not ultimately restrict us but instead
facilitate our goals and make for fuller, freer lives.</p>
<p>The first time I met Jordan Peterson was on September 12, 2004, at
the home of two mutual friends, TV producer Wodek Szemberg and medical
internist Estera Bekier. It was Wodek’s birthday party. Wodek and Estera
are Polish émigrés who grew up within the Soviet empire, where it was
understood that many topics were off limits, and that casually
questioning certain social arrangements and philosophical ideas (not to
mention the regime itself) could mean big trouble.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wodek
Szemberg,是加拿大电视制片人，以举办思想开放的沙龙和推动乔丹·彼得森（Jordan
Peterson）进入公众视野而知名。</li>
</ul>
<p>But now, host and hostess luxuriated in easygoing, honest talk, by
having elegant parties devoted to the pleasure of saying what you really
thought and hearing others do the same, in an uninhibited give-and-take.
Here, the rule was “Speak your mind.” If the conversation turned to
politics, people of different political persuasions spoke to each
other—indeed, looked forward to it—in a manner that is increasingly
rare. Sometimes Wodek’s own opinions, or truths, exploded out of him, as
did his laugh. Then he’d hug whoever had made him laugh or provoked him
to speak his mind with greater intensity than even he might have
intended. This was the best part of the parties, and this frankness, and
his warm embraces, made it worth provoking him. Meanwhile, Estera’s
voice lilted across the room on a very precise path towards its intended
listener. Truth explosions didn’t make the atmosphere any less easygoing
for the company—they made for more truth explosions!—liberating us, and
more laughs, and making the whole evening more pleasant, because with
de-repressing Eastern Europeans like the Szemberg-Bekiers, you always
knew with what and with whom you were dealing, and that frankness was
enlivening. Honoré de Balzac, the novelist, once described the balls and
parties in his native France, observing that what appeared to be a
single party was always really two. In the first hours, the gathering
was suffused with bored people posing and posturing, and attendees who
came to meet perhaps one special person who would confirm them in their
beauty and status. Then, only in the very late hours, after most of the
guests had left, would the second party, the real party, begin. Here the
conversation was shared by each person present, and open-hearted
laughter replaced the starchy airs. At Estera and Wodek’s parties, this
kind of wee-hours-of-the-morning disclosure and intimacy often began as
soon as we entered the room.</p>
<p>Wodek is a silver-haired, lion-maned hunter, always on the lookout
for potential public intellectuals, who knows how to spot people who can
really talk in front of a TV camera and who look authentic because they
are (the camera picks up on that). He often invites such people to these
salons. That day Wodek brought a psychology professor, from my own
University of Toronto, who fit the bill: intellect and emotion in
tandem. Wodek was the first to put Jordan Peterson in front of a camera,
and thought of him as a teacher in search of students—because he was
always ready to explain. And it helped that he liked the camera and that
the camera liked him back.</p>
<p>That afternoon there was a large table set outside in the
Szemberg-Bekiers’ garden; around it was gathered the usual collection of
lips and ears, and loquacious virtuosos. We seemed, however, to be
plagued by a buzzing paparazzi of bees, and here was this new fellow at
the table, with an Albertan accent, in cowboy boots, who was ignoring
them, and kept on talking. He kept talking while the rest of us were
playing musical chairs to keep away from the pests, yet also trying to
remain at the table because this new addition to our gatherings was so
interesting.</p>
<p>He had this odd habit of speaking about the deepest questions to
whoever was at this table—most of them new acquaintances—as though he
were just making small talk. Or, if he did do small talk, the interval
between “How do you know Wodek and Estera?” or “I was a beekeeper once,
so I’m used to them” and more serious topics would be nanoseconds.</p>
<p>One might hear such questions discussed at parties where professors
and professionals gather, but usually the conversation would remain
between two specialists in the topic, off in a corner, or if shared with
the whole group it was often not without someone preening. But this
Peterson, though erudite, didn’t come across as a pedant. He had the
enthusiasm of a kid who had just learned something new and had to share
it. He seemed to be assuming, as a child would—before learning how
dulled adults can become—that if he thought something was interesting,
then so might others. There was something boyish in the cowboy, in his
broaching of subjects as though we had all grown up together in the same
small town, or family, and had all been thinking about the very same
problems of human existence all along.</p>
<p>Peterson wasn’t really an “eccentric”; he had sufficient conventional
chops, had been a Harvard professor, was a gentleman (as cowboys can be)
though he did say damn and bloody a lot, in a rural 1950s sort of way.
But everyone listened, with fascination on their faces, because he was
in fact addressing questions of concern to everyone at the table.</p>
<p>There was something freeing about being with a person so learned yet
speaking in such an unedited way. His thinking was motoric; it seemed he
needed to think aloud, to use his motor cortex to think, but that motor
also had to run fast to work properly. To get to liftoff. Not quite
manic, but his idling speed revved high. Spirited thoughts were tumbling
out. But unlike many academics who take the floor and hold it, if
someone challenged or corrected him he really seemed to like it. He
didn’t rear up and neigh. He’d say, in a kind of folksy way, “Yeah,” and
bow his head involuntarily, wag it if he had overlooked something,
laughing at himself for overgeneralizing. He appreciated being shown
another side of an issue, and it became clear that thinking through a
problem was, for him, a dialogic process.</p>
<p>One could not but be struck by another unusual thing about him: for
an egghead Peterson was extremely practical. His examples were filled
with applications to everyday life: business management, how to make
furniture (he made much of his own), designing a simple house, making a
room beautiful (now an internet meme) or in another, specific case
related to education, creating an online writing project that kept
minority students from dropping out of school by getting them to do a
kind of psychoanalytic exercise on themselves, in which they would
free-associate about their past, present and future (now known as the
Self-Authoring Program).</p>
<p>I was always especially fond of mid-Western, Prairie types who come
from a farm (where they learned all about nature), or from a very small
town, and who have worked with their hands to make things, spent long
periods outside in the harsh elements, and are often self-educated and
go to university against the odds. I found them quite unlike their
sophisticated but somewhat denatured urban counterparts, for whom higher
education was pre-ordained, and for that reason sometimes taken for
granted, or thought of not as an end in itself but simply as a life
stage in the service of career advancement. These Westerners were
different: self-made, unentitled, hands on, neighbourly and less
precious than many of their big-city peers, who increasingly spend their
lives indoors, manipulating symbols on computers. This cowboy
psychologist seemed to care about a thought only if it might, in some
way, be helpful to someone.</p>
<p>We became friends. As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who loves
literature, I was drawn to him because here was a clinician who also had
given himself a great books education, and who not only loved soulful
Russian novels, philosophy and ancient mythology, but who also seemed to
treat them as his most treasured inheritance. But he also did
illuminating statistical research on personality and temperament, and
had studied neuroscience. Though trained as a behaviourist, he was
powerfully drawn to psychoanalysis with its focus on dreams, archetypes,
the persistence of childhood conflicts in the adult, and the role of
defences and rationalization in everyday life. He was also an outlier in
being the only member of the research-oriented Department of Psychology
at the University of Toronto who also kept a clinical practice.</p>
<p>On my visits, our conversations began with banter and laughter—that
was the small-town Peterson from the Alberta hinterland—his teenage
years right out of the movie FUBAR—welcoming you into his home. The
house had been gutted by Tammy, his wife, and himself, and turned into
perhaps the most fascinating and shocking middle-class home I had seen.
They had art, some carved masks, and abstract portraits, but they were
overwhelmed by a huge collection of original Socialist Realist paintings
of Lenin and the early Communists commissioned by the USSR. Not long
after the Soviet Union fell, and most of the world breathed a sigh of
relief, Peterson began purchasing this propaganda for a song online.
Paintings lionizing the Soviet revolutionary spirit completely filled
every single wall, the ceilings, even the bathrooms. The paintings were
not there because Jordan had any totalitarian sympathies, but because he
wanted to remind himself of something he knew he and everyone would
rather forget: that hundreds of millions were murdered in the name of
utopia.</p>
<p>It took getting used to, this semi-haunted house “decorated” by a
delusion that had practically destroyed mankind. But it was eased by his
wonderful and unique spouse, Tammy, who was all in, who embraced and
encouraged this unusual need for expression! These paintings provided a
visitor with the first window onto the full extent of Jordan’s concern
about our human capacity for evil in the name of good, and the
psychological mystery of self-deception (how can a person deceive
himself and get away with it?)—an interest we share. And then there were
also the hours we’d spend discussing what I might call a lesser problem
(lesser because rarer), the human capacity for evil for the sake of
evil, the joy some people take in destroying others, captured famously
by the seventeenth-century English poet John Milton in Paradise
Lost.</p>
<p>And so we’d chat and have our tea in his kitchen-underworld, walled
by this odd art collection, a visual marker of his earnest quest to move
beyond simplistic ideology, left or right, and not repeat mistakes of
the past. After a while, there was nothing peculiar about taking tea in
the kitchen, discussing family issues, one’s latest reading, with those
ominous pictures hovering. It was just living in the world as it was, or
in some places, is.</p>
<p>In Jordan’s first and only book before this one, Maps of Meaning, he
shares his profound insights into universal themes of world mythology,
and explains how all cultures have created stories to help us grapple
with, and ultimately map, the chaos into which we are thrown at birth;
this chaos is everything that is unknown to us, and any unexplored
territory that we must traverse, be it in the world outside or the
psyche within.</p>
<p>Combining evolution, the neuroscience of emotion, some of the best of
Jung, some of Freud, much of the great works of Nietzsche, Dostoevsky,
Solzhenitsyn, Eliade, Neumann, Piaget, Frye and Frankl, Maps of Meaning,
published nearly two decades ago, shows Jordan’s wide-ranging approach
to understanding how human beings and the human brain deal with the
archetypal situation that arises whenever we, in our daily lives, must
face something we do not understand. The brilliance of the book is in
his demonstration of how rooted this situation is in evolution, our DNA,
our brains and our most ancient stories. And he shows that these stories
have survived because they still provide guidance in dealing with
uncertainty, and the unavoidable unknown.</p>
<p>One of the many virtues of the book you are reading now is that it
provides an entry point into Maps of Meaning, which is a highly complex
work because Jordan was working out his approach to psychology as he
wrote it. But it was foundational, because no matter how different our
genes or life experiences may be, or how differently our plastic brains
are wired by our experience, we all have to deal with the unknown, and
we all attempt to move from chaos to order. And this is why many of the
rules in this book, being based on Maps of Meaning, have an element of
universality to them.</p>
<p>Maps of Meaning was sparked by Jordan’s agonized awareness, as a
teenager growing up in the midst of the Cold War, that much of mankind
seemed on the verge of blowing up the planet to defend their various
identities. He felt he had to understand how it could be that people
would sacrifice everything for an “identity,” whatever that was. And he
felt he had to understand the ideologies that drove totalitarian regimes
to a variant of that same behaviour: killing their own citizens. In Maps
of Meaning, and again in this book, one of the matters he cautions
readers to be most wary of is ideology, no matter who is peddling it or
to what end.</p>
<p>Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that
purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that
will perfect it. Ideologues are people who pretend they know how to
“make the world a better place” before they’ve taken care of their own
chaos within. (The warrior identity that their ideology gives them
covers over that chaos.) That’s hubris, of course, and one of the most
important themes of this book, is “set your house in order” first, and
Jordan provides practical advice on how to do this.</p>
<p>Ideologies are substitutes for true knowledge, and ideologues are
always dangerous when they come to power, because a simple-minded
I-know-it-all approach is no match for the complexity of existence.
Furthermore, when their social contraptions fail to fly, ideologues
blame not themselves but all who see through the simplifications.
Another great U of T professor, Lewis Feuer, in his book Ideology and
the Ideologists, observed that ideologies retool the very religious
stories they purport to have supplanted, but eliminate the narrative and
psychological richness. Communism borrowed from the story of the
Children of Israel in Egypt, with an enslaved class, rich persecutors, a
leader, like Lenin, who goes abroad, lives among the enslavers, and then
leads the enslaved to the promised land (the utopia; the dictatorship of
the proletariat).</p>
<p>To understand ideology, Jordan read extensively about not only the
Soviet gulag, but also the Holocaust and the rise of Nazism. I had never
before met a person, born Christian and of my generation, who was so
utterly tormented by what happened in Europe to the Jews, and who had
worked so hard to understand how it could have occurred. I too had
studied this in depth. My own father survived Auschwitz. My grandmother
was middle-aged when she stood face to face with Dr. Josef Mengele, the
Nazi physician who conducted unspeakably cruel experiments on his
victims, and she survived Auschwitz by disobeying his order to join the
line with the elderly, the grey and the weak, and instead slipping into
a line with younger people. She avoided the gas chambers a second time
by trading food for hair dye so she wouldn’t be murdered for looking too
old. My grandfather, her husband, survived the Mauthausen concentration
camp, but choked to death on the first piece of solid food he was given,
just before liberation day. I relate this, because years after we became
friends, when Jordan would take a classical liberal stand for free
speech, he would be accused by left-wing extremists as being a
right-wing bigot.</p>
<p>Let me say, with all the moderation I can summon: at best, those
accusers have simply not done their due diligence. I have; with a family
history such as mine, one develops not only radar, but underwater sonar
for right-wing bigotry; but even more important, one learns to recognize
the kind of person with the comprehension, tools, good will and courage
to combat it, and Jordan Peterson is that person.</p>
<p>My own dissatisfaction with modern political science’s attempts to
understand the rise of Nazism, totalitarianism and prejudice was a major
factor in my decision to supplement my studies of political science with
the study of the unconscious, projection, psychoanalysis, the regressive
potential of group psychology, psychiatry and the brain. Jordan switched
out of political science for similar reasons. With these important
parallel interests, we didn’t always agree on “the answers” (thank God),
but we almost always agreed on the questions.</p>
<p>Our friendship wasn’t all doom and gloom. I have made a habit of
attending my fellow professors’ classes at our university, and so
attended his, which were always packed, and I saw what now millions have
seen online: a brilliant, often dazzling public speaker who was at his
best riffing like a jazz artist; at times he resembled an ardent Prairie
preacher (not in evangelizing, but in his passion, in his ability to
tell stories that convey the life-stakes that go with believing or
disbelieving various ideas). Then he’d just as easily switch to do a
breathtakingly systematic summary of a series of scientific studies. He
was a master at helping students become more reflective, and take
themselves and their futures seriously. He taught them to respect many
of the greatest books ever written. He gave vivid examples from clinical
practice, was (appropriately) self-revealing, even of his own
vulnerabilities, and made fascinating links between evolution, the brain
and religious stories. In a world where students are taught to see
evolution and religion as simply opposed (by thinkers like Richard
Dawkins), Jordan showed his students how evolution, of all things, helps
to explain the profound psychological appeal and wisdom of many ancient
stories, from Gilgamesh to the life of the Buddha, Egyptian mythology
and the Bible. He showed, for instance, how stories about journeying
voluntarily into the unknown—the hero’s quest—mirror universal tasks for
which the brain evolved. He respected the stories, was not reductionist,
and never claimed to exhaust their wisdom. If he discussed a topic such
as prejudice, or its emotional relatives fear and disgust, or the
differences between the sexes on average, he was able to show how these
traits evolved and why they survived.</p>
<p>Above all, he alerted his students to topics rarely discussed in
university, such as the simple fact that all the ancients, from Buddha
to the biblical authors, knew what every slightly worn-out adult knows,
that life is suffering. If you are suffering, or someone close to you
is, that’s sad. But alas, it’s not particularly special. We don’t suffer
only because “politicians are dimwitted,” or “the system is corrupt,” or
because you and I, like almost everyone else, can legitimately describe
ourselves, in some way, as a victim of something or someone. It is
because we are born human that we are guaranteed a good dose of
suffering. And chances are, if you or someone you love is not suffering
now, they will be within five years, unless you are freakishly lucky.
Rearing kids is hard, work is hard, aging, sickness and death are hard,
and Jordan emphasized that doing all that totally on your own, without
the benefit of a loving relationship, or wisdom, or the psychological
insights of the greatest psychologists, only makes it harder. He wasn’t
scaring the students; in fact, they found this frank talk reassuring,
because in the depths of their psyches, most of them knew what he said
was true, even if there was never a forum to discuss it—perhaps because
the adults in their lives had become so naively overprotective that they
deluded themselves into thinking that not talking about suffering would
in some way magically protect their children from it.</p>
<p>Here he would relate the myth of the hero, a cross-cultural theme
explored psychoanalytically by Otto Rank, who noted, following Freud,
that hero myths are similar in many cultures, a theme that was picked up
by Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell and Erich Neumann, among others. Where
Freud made great contributions in explaining neuroses by, among other
things, focusing on understanding what we might call a failed-hero story
(that of Oedipus), Jordan focused on triumphant heroes. In all these
triumph stories, the hero has to go into the unknown, into an unexplored
territory, and deal with a new great challenge and take great risks. In
the process, something of himself has to die, or be given up, so he can
be reborn and meet the challenge. This requires courage, something
rarely discussed in a psychology class or textbook. During his recent
public stand for free speech and against what I call “forced speech”
(because it involves a government forcing citizens to voice political
views), the stakes were very high; he had much to lose, and knew it.
Nonetheless, I saw him (and Tammy, for that matter) not only display
such courage, but also continue to live by many of the rules in this
book, some of which can be very demanding.</p>
<p>I saw him grow, from the remarkable person he was, into someone even
more able and assured—through living by these rules. In fact, it was the
process of writing this book, and developing these rules, that led him
to take the stand he did against forced or compelled speech. And that is
why, during those events, he started posting some of his thoughts about
life and these rules on the internet. Now, over 100 million YouTube hits
later, we know they have struck a chord.</p>
<p>Given our distaste for rules, how do we explain the extraordinary
response to his lectures, which give rules? In Jordan’s case, it was of
course his charisma and a rare willingness to stand for a principle that
got him a wide hearing online initially; views of his first YouTube
statements quickly numbered in the hundreds of thousands. But people
have kept listening because what he is saying meets a deep and
unarticulated need. And that is because alongside our wish to be free of
rules, we all search for structure.</p>
<p>The hunger among many younger people for rules, or at least
guidelines, is greater today for good reason. In the West at least,
millennials are living through a unique historical situation. They are,
I believe, the first generation to have been so thoroughly taught two
seemingly contradictory ideas about morality, simultaneously—at their
schools, colleges and universities, by many in my own generation. This
contradiction has left them at times disoriented and uncertain, without
guidance and, more tragically, deprived of riches they don’t even know
exist.</p>
<p>The first idea or teaching is that morality is relative, at best a
personal “value judgment.” Relative means that there is no absolute
right or wrong in anything; instead, morality and the rules associated
with it are just a matter of personal opinion or happenstance, “relative
to” or “related to” a particular framework, such as one’s ethnicity,
one’s upbringing, or the culture or historical moment one is born into.
It’s nothing but an accident of birth. According to this argument (now a
creed), history teaches that religions, tribes, nations and ethnic
groups tend to disagree about fundamental matters, and always have.
Today, the postmodernist left makes the additional claim that one
group’s morality is nothing but its attempt to exercise power over
another group. So, the decent thing to do—once it becomes apparent how
arbitrary your, and your society’s, “moral values” are—is to show
tolerance for people who think differently, and who come from different
(diverse) backgrounds. That emphasis on tolerance is so paramount that
for many people one of the worst character flaws a person can have is to
be “judgmental.”fn1 And, since we don’t know right from wrong, or what
is good, just about the most inappropriate thing an adult can do is give
a young person advice about how to live.</p>
<p>And so a generation has been raised untutored in what was once
called, aptly, “practical wisdom,” which guided previous generations.
Millennials, often told they have received the finest education
available anywhere, have actually suffered a form of serious
intellectual and moral neglect. The relativists of my generation and
Jordan’s, many of whom became their professors, chose to devalue
thousands of years of human knowledge about how to acquire virtue,
dismissing it as passé, “not relevant” or even “oppressive.” They were
so successful at it that the very word “virtue” sounds out of date, and
someone using it appears anachronistically moralistic and
self-righteous.</p>
<p>The study of virtue is not quite the same as the study of morals
(right and wrong, good and evil). Aristotle defined the virtues simply
as the ways of behaving that are most conducive to happiness in life.
Vice was defined as the ways of behaving least conducive to happiness.
He observed that the virtues always aim for balance and avoid the
extremes of the vices. Aristotle studied the virtues and the vices in
his Nicomachean Ethics. It was a book based on experience and
observation, not conjecture, about the kind of happiness that was
possible for human beings. Cultivating judgment about the difference
between virtue and vice is the beginning of wisdom, something that can
never be out of date.</p>
<p>By contrast, our modern relativism begins by asserting that making
judgments about how to live is impossible, because there is no real
good, and no true virtue (as these too are relative). Thus relativism’s
closest approximation to “virtue” is “tolerance.” Only tolerance will
provide social cohesion between different groups, and save us from
harming each other. On Facebook and other forms of social media,
therefore, you signal your so-called virtue, telling everyone how
tolerant, open and compassionate you are, and wait for likes to
accumulate. (Leave aside that telling people you’re virtuous isn’t a
virtue, it’s self-promotion. Virtue signalling is not virtue. Virtue
signalling is, quite possibly, our commonest vice.)</p>
<p>Intolerance of others’ views (no matter how ignorant or incoherent
they may be) is not simply wrong; in a world where there is no right or
wrong, it is worse: it is a sign you are embarrassingly unsophisticated
or, possibly, dangerous.</p>
<p>But it turns out that many people cannot tolerate the vacuum—the
chaos—which is inherent in life, but made worse by this moral
relativism; they cannot live without a moral compass, without an ideal
at which to aim in their lives. (For relativists, ideals are values too,
and like all values, they are merely “relative” and hardly worth
sacrificing for.) So, right alongside relativism, we find the spread of
nihilism and despair, and also the opposite of moral relativism: the
blind certainty offered by ideologies that claim to have an answer for
everything.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at the second teaching that millennials have been
bombarded with. They sign up for a humanities course, to study greatest
books ever written. But they’re not assigned the books; instead they are
given ideological attacks on them, based on some appalling
simplification. Where the relativist is filled with uncertainty, the
ideologue is the very opposite. He or she is hyper-judgmental and
censorious, always knows what’s wrong about others, and what to do about
it. Sometimes it seems the only people willing to give advice in a
relativistic society are those with the least to offer.</p>
<p>Modern moral relativism has many sources. As we in the West learned
more history, we understood that different epochs had different moral
codes. As we travelled the seas and explored the globe, we learned of
far-flung tribes on different continents whose different moral codes
made sense relative to, or within the framework of, their societies.
Science played a role, too, by attacking the religious view of the
world, and thus undermining the religious grounds for ethics and rules.
Materialist social science implied that we could divide the world into
facts (which all could observe, and were objective and “real”) and
values (which were subjective and personal). Then we could first agree
on the facts, and, maybe, one day, develop a scientific code of ethics
(which has yet to arrive). Moreover, by implying that values had a
lesser reality than facts, science contributed in yet another way to
moral relativism, for it treated “value” as secondary. (But the idea
that we can easily separate facts and values was and remains naive; to
some extent, one’s values determine what one will pay attention to, and
what will count as a fact.)</p>
<p>The idea that different societies had different rules and morals was
known to the ancient world too, and it is interesting to compare its
response to this realization with the modern response (relativism,
nihilism and ideology). When the ancient Greeks sailed to India and
elsewhere, they too discovered that rules, morals and customs differed
from place to place, and saw that the explanation for what was right and
wrong was often rooted in some ancestral authority. The Greek response
was not despair, but a new invention: philosophy.</p>
<p>Socrates, reacting to the uncertainty bred by awareness of these
conflicting moral codes, decided that instead of becoming a nihilist, a
relativist or an ideologue, he would devote his life to the search for
wisdom that could reason about these differences, i.e., he helped invent
philosophy. He spent his life asking perplexing, foundational questions,
such as “What is virtue?” and “How can one live the good life?” and
“What is justice?” and he looked at different approaches, asking which
seemed most coherent and most in accord with human nature. These are the
kinds of questions that I believe animate this book.</p>
<p>For the ancients, the discovery that different people have different
ideas about how, practically, to live, did not paralyze them; it
deepened their understanding of humanity and led to some of the most
satisfying conversations human beings have ever had, about how life
might be lived.</p>
<p>Likewise, Aristotle. Instead of despairing about these differences in
moral codes, Aristotle argued that though specific rules, laws and
customs differed from place to place, what does not differ is that in
all places human beings, by their nature, have a proclivity to make
rules, laws and customs. To put this in modern terms, it seems that all
human beings are, by some kind of biological endowment, so ineradicably
concerned with morality that we create a structure of laws and rules
wherever we are. The idea that human life can be free of moral concerns
is a fantasy.</p>
<p>We are rule generators. And given that we are moral animals, what
must be the effect of our simplistic modern relativism upon us? It means
we are hobbling ourselves by pretending to be something we are not. It
is a mask, but a strange one, for it mostly deceives the one who wears
it. Scccccratccch the most clever postmodern-relativist professor’s
Mercedes with a key, and you will see how fast the mask of relativism
(with its pretense that there can be neither right nor wrong) and the
cloak of radical tolerance come off.</p>
<p>Because we do not yet have an ethics based on modern science, Jordan
is not trying to develop his rules by wiping the slate clean—by
dismissing thousands of years of wisdom as mere superstition and
ignoring our greatest moral achievements. Far better to integrate the
best of what we are now learning with the books human beings saw fit to
preserve over millennia, and with the stories that have survived,
against all odds, time’s tendency to obliterate.</p>
<p>He is doing what reasonable guides have always done: he makes no
claim that human wisdom begins with himself, but, rather, turns first to
his own guides. And although the topics in this book are serious, Jordan
often has great fun addressing them with a light touch, as the chapter
headings convey. He makes no claim to be exhaustive, and sometimes the
chapters consist of wide-ranging discussions of our psychology as he
understands it.</p>
<p>So why not call this a book of “guidelines,” a far more relaxed,
user-friendly and less rigid sounding term than “rules”?</p>
<p>Because these really are rules. And the foremost rule is that you
must take responsibility for your own life. Period.</p>
<p>One might think that a generation that has heard endlessly, from
their more ideological teachers, about the rights, rights, rights that
belong to them, would object to being told that they would do better to
focus instead on taking responsibility. Yet this generation, many of
whom were raised in small families by hyper-protective parents, on
soft-surface playgrounds, and then taught in universities with “safe
spaces” where they don’t have to hear things they don’t want to—schooled
to be risk-averse—has among it, now, millions who feel stultified by
this underestimation of their potential resilience and who have embraced
Jordan’s message that each individual has ultimate responsibility to
bear; that if one wants to live a full life, one first sets one’s own
house in order; and only then can one sensibly aim to take on bigger
responsibilities. The extent of this reaction has often moved both of us
to the brink of tears.</p>
<p>Sometimes these rules are demanding. They require you to undertake an
incremental process that over time will stretch you to a new limit. That
requires, as I’ve said, venturing into the unknown. Stretching yourself
beyond the boundaries of your current self requires carefully choosing
and then pursuing ideals: ideals that are up there, above you, superior
to you—and that you can’t always be sure you will reach.</p>
<p>But if it’s uncertain that our ideals are attainable, why do we
bother reaching in the first place? Because if you don’t reach for them,
it is certain you will never feel that your life has meaning.</p>
<p>And perhaps because, as unfamiliar and strange as it sounds, in the
deepest part of our psyche, we all want to be judged.</p>
