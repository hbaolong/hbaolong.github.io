<h4 id="vamp">VAMP</h4>
<p>Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to
cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they know
nothing.</p>
<p>—Voltaire</p>
<p>If we didn’t kill the tumor, we killed the patient.</p>
<p>—William Moloney on the early days</p>
<p>of chemotherapy</p>
<p>VAMP—high-dose, life-threatening, four-drug combination therapy for
leukemia—might have made obvious sense to Skipper, Frei, and Freireich,
but to many of their colleagues, it was a terrifying notion, an
abomination. Freireich finally approached Zubrod with his idea: “I
wanted to treat them with full doses of vincristine and amethopterin,
combined with the 6-MP and prednisone.” The ands in the sentence were
italicized to catch Zubrod’s attention.</p>
<p>Zubrod was stunned. “It is the dose that makes a poison,” runs the
old adage in medicine: all medicines were poisons in one form or another
merely diluted to an appropriate dose. But chemotherapy was poison even
at the correct dose.* A child with leukemia was already stretched to the
brittle limits of survival, hanging on to life by a bare physiological
thread. People at the NCI would often casually talk of chemotherapy as
the “poison of the month.” If four poisons of the month were
simultaneously pumped daily into a three- or six-year-old child, there
was virtually no guarantee that he or she could survive even the first
dose of this regimen, let alone survive week after week after week.</p>
<p>When Frei and Freireich presented their preliminary plan for VAMP at
a national meeting on blood cancers, the audience balked. Farber, for
one, favored giving one drug at a time and adding the second only after
relapse and so forth, following the leukemia consortium’s slow but
steady method of adding drugs carefully and sequentially. “Oh, boy,”
Freireich recalled, “it was a terrible, catastrophic showdown. We were
laughed at and then called insane, incompetent, and cruel.” With limited
patients and hundreds of drugs and combinations to try, every new
leukemia trial had to wind its way through a complex approval process
through the leukemia group. Frei and Freireich, it was felt, were making
an unauthorized quantum leap. The group refused to sponsor VAMP—at least
not until the many other trials had been completed.</p>
<p>But Frei wrangled a last-minute compromise: VAMP would be studied
independently at the NCI, outside the purview of the ALGB. “The idea was
preposterous,” Freireich recalled. “To run the trial, we would need to
split with the ALGB, the very group that we had been so instrumental in
founding.” Zubrod wasn’t pleased with the compromise: it was a break
from his cherished “cooperative” model. Worse still, if VAMP failed, it
would be a political nightmare for him. “If the children had died, we’d
be accused of experimenting on people at this federal installation of
the National Cancer Institute,” Freireich acknowledged. Everyone knew it
was chancy territory. Embroiled in controversy, even if he had resolved
it as best he could, Frei resigned as the chair of the ALGB. Years
later, Freireich acknowledged the risks involved: “We could have killed
all of those kids.”</p>
<p>The VAMP trial was finally launched in 1961. Almost instantly, it
seemed like an abysmal mistake—precisely the sort of nightmare that
Zubrod had been trying to avoid.</p>
<p>The first children to be treated “were already terribly, terribly
ill,” Freireich recalled. “We started VAMP, and by the end of the week,
many of them were infinitely worse than before. It was a disaster.” The
four-drug chemo regimen raged through the body and wiped out all the
normal cells. Some children slumped into near coma and were hooked to
respirators. Freireich, desperate to save them, visited his patients
obsessively in their hospital beds. “You can imagine the tension,” he
wrote. “I could just hear people saying, ‘I told you so, this girl or
boy is going to die.’” He hovered in the wards, pestering the staff with
questions and suggestions. His paternal, possessive instincts were
aroused: “These were my kids. I really tried to take care of them.”</p>
<p>The NCI, as a whole, watched tensely—for its life, too, was on the
line. “I did little things,” Freireich wrote. “Maybe I could make them
more comfortable, give them a little aspirin, lower their temperatures,
get them a blanket.” Thrown into the uncertain front lines of cancer
medicine, juggling the most toxic and futuristic combinations of drugs,
the NCI doctors fell back to their oldest principles. They provided
comfort. They nurtured. They focused on caregiving and support. They
fluffed pillows.</p>
<p>At the end of three excruciating weeks, a few of Freireich’s patients
somehow pulled through. Then, unexpectedly—at a time when it was almost
unbearable to look for it—there was a payoff. The normal bone marrow
cells began to recover gradually, but the leukemia went into remission.
The bone marrow biopsies came back one after another—all without
leukemia cells. Red blood cells and white blood cells and platelets
sprouted up in an otherwise scorched field of bone marrow. But the
leukemia did not return. Another set of biopsies, weeks later, confirmed
the finding. Not a single leukemia cell was visible under the
microscope. This—after near-complete devastation—was a remission so deep
that it exceeded the expectations of everyone at the NCI.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the NCI team drummed up enough courage to try VAMP
on yet another small cohort of patients. Once again, after the nearly
catastrophic dip in counts—“like a drop from a cliff with a thread tied
to your ankles,” as one researcher remembered it—the bone marrow
recovered and the leukemia vanished. A few days later, the bone marrow
began to regenerate, and Freireich performed a hesitant biopsy to look
at the cells. The leukemia had vanished again. What it had left behind
was full of promise: normal cobblestones of blood cells growing back in
the marrow.</p>
<p>By 1962, Frei and Freireich had treated six patients with several
doses of VAMP. Remissions were reliable and durable. The Clinical Center
was now filled with the familiar chatter of children in wigs and scarves
who had survived two or three seasons of chemotherapy—a strikingly
anomalous phenomenon in the history of leukemia. Critics were slowly
turning into converts. Other clinical centers around the nation joined
Frei and Freireich’s experimental regimen. The patient “is amazingly
recovered,” a hematologist in Boston treating an eleven-year-old wrote
in 1964. Astonishment slowly gave way to buoyancy. Even William
Dameshek, the opinionated Harvard-trained hematologist and one of the
most prominent early opponents of VAMP, wrote, “The mood among pediatric
oncologists changed virtually overnight from one of ‘compassionate
fatalism’ to one of ‘aggressive optimism.’”</p>
<p>The optimism was potent, but short-lived. In September 1963, not long
after Frei and Freireich had returned from one of those triumphant
conferences celebrating the unexpected success of VAMP, a few children
in remission came back to the clinic with minor complaints: a headache,
a seizure, an occasional tingling of a nerve in the face.</p>
<p>“Some of us didn’t make much of it at first,” a hematologist
recalled. “We imagined the symptoms would go away.” But Freireich, who
had studied the spread of leukemia cells in the body for nearly a
decade, knew that these were headaches that would not go away. By
October, there were more children back at the clinic, this time with
numbness, tingling, headaches, seizures, and facial paralysis. Frei and
Freireich were both getting nervous.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, Virchow had observed that leukemia cells could
occasionally colonize the brain. To investigate the possibility of a
brain invasion by cancer cells, Frei and Freireich looked directly at
the spinal fluid using a spinal tap, a method to withdraw a few
milliliters of fluid from the spinal canal using a thin, straight
needle. The fluid, a straw-colored liquid that circulates in direct
connection with the brain, is a surrogate for examining the brain.</p>
<p>In the folklore of science, there is the often-told story of the
moment of discovery: the quickening of the pulse, the spectral
luminosity of ordinary facts, the overheated, standstill second when
observations crystallize and fall together into patterns, like pieces of
a kaleidoscope. The apple drops from the tree. The man jumps up from a
bathtub; the slippery equation balances itself.</p>
<p>But there is another moment of discovery—its antithesis—that is
rarely recorded: the discovery of failure. It is a moment that a
scientist often encounters alone. A patient’s CT scan shows a relapsed
lymphoma. A cell once killed by a drug begins to grow back. A child
returns to the NCI with a headache.</p>
<p>What Frei and Freireich discovered in the spinal fluid left them
cold: leukemia cells were growing explosively in the spinal fluid by the
millions, colonizing the brain. The headaches and the numbness were
early signs of much more profound devastations to come. In the months
that followed, one by one, all the children came back to the institute
with a spectrum of neurological complaints—headaches, tinglings,
abstract speckles of light—then slumped into coma. Bone marrow biopsies
were clean. No cancer was found in the body. But the leukemia cells had
invaded the nervous system, causing a quick, unexpected demise.</p>
<p>It was a consequence of the body’s own defense system subverting
cancer treatment. The brain and spinal cord are insulated by a tight
cellular seal called the blood-brain barrier that prevents foreign
chemicals from easily getting into the brain. It is an ancient
biological system that has evolved to keep poisons from reaching the
brain. But the same system had likely also kept VAMP out of the nervous
system, creating a natural “sanctuary” for cancer within the body. The
leukemia, sensing an opportunity in that sanctuary, had furtively
climbed in, colonizing the one place that is fundamentally unreachable
by chemotherapy. The children died one after the other—felled by virtue
of the adaptation designed to protect them.</p>
<p>Frei and Freireich were hit hard by those relapses. For a clinical
scientist, a trial is like a child, a deeply personal investment. To
watch this sort of intense, intimate enterprise fold up and die is to
suffer the loss of a child. One leukemia doctor wrote, “I know the
patients, I know their brothers and sisters, I know their dogs and cats
by name. . . . The pain is that a lot of love affairs end.”</p>
<p>After seven exhilarating and intensive trials, the love affair at the
NCI had indeed ended. The brain relapses after VAMP seemed to push
morale at the institute to the breaking point. Frei, who had so
furiously tried to keep VAMP alive through its most trying stages—twelve
months of manipulating, coaxing, and wheedling—now found himself drained
of his last stores of energy. Even the indefatigable Freireich was
beginning to lose steam. He felt a growing hostility from others at the
institute. At the peak of his career, he, too, felt tired of the
interminable institutional scuffles that had once invigorated him.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1963, Frei left for a position at the MD Anderson
Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The trials were temporarily put on hold
(although they would eventually be resurrected in Texas). Freireich soon
left the NCI to join Frei in Houston. The fragile ecosystem that had
sustained Freireich, Frei, and Zubrod dissolved in a few months.</p>
<p>But the story of leukemia—the story of cancer—isn’t the story of
doctors who struggle and survive, moving from one institution to
another. It is the story of patients who struggle and survive, moving
from one embankment of illness to another. Resilience, inventiveness,
and survivorship—qualities often ascribed to great physicians—are
reflected qualities, emanating first from those who struggle with
illness and only then mirrored by those who treat them. If the history
of medicine is told through the stories of doctors, it is because their
contributions stand in place of the more substantive heroism of their
patients.</p>
<p>I said that all the children had relapsed and died—but this is not
quite true. A few, a small handful, for mysterious reasons, never
relapsed with leukemia in the central nervous system. At the NCI and the
few other hospitals brave enough to try VAMP, about 5 percent of the
treated children finished their yearlong journey. They remained in
remission not just for weeks or months, but for years. They came back,
year after year, and sat nervously in waiting rooms at trial centers all
around the nation. Their voices deepened. Their hair grew back. Biopsy
after biopsy was performed. And there was no visible sign of cancer.</p>
<p>On a summer afternoon, I drove through western Maine to the small
town of Waterboro. Against the foggy, overcast sky, the landscape was
spectacular, with ancient pine and birch forests tipping into
crystalline lakes. On the far edge of the town, I turned onto a dirt
road leading away from the water. At the end of the road, surrounded by
deep pine forests, was a tiny clapboard house. A fifty-six-year-old
woman in a blue T-shirt answered the door. It had taken me seventeen
months and innumerable phone calls, questions, interviews, and
references to track her down. One afternoon, scouring the Internet, I
had found a lead. I remember dialing the number, excited beyond words,
and waiting for interminable rings before a woman answered. I had fixed
up an appointment to meet her that week and driven rather recklessly to
Maine to keep it. When I arrived, I realized that I was twenty minutes
early.</p>
<p>I cannot remember what I said, or struggled to say, as a measure of
introduction. But I felt awestruck. Standing before me against the door,
smiling nervously, was one of the survivors of that original VAMP cohort
cured of childhood leukemia.</p>
<p>The basement was flooded and the couch was growing mildew, so we sat
outdoors in the shadows of the trees in a screened tent with deerflies
and mosquitoes buzzing outside. The woman—Ella, I’ll call her—had
collected a pile of medical records and photographs for me to look
through. As she handed them over, I sensed a shiver running through her
body, as if even today, forty-five years after her ordeal, the memory
haunts her viscerally.</p>
<p>Ella was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1964, about eighteen months
after VAMP was first used at the NCI. She was eleven years old. In the
photographs taken before her diagnosis, she was a typical preteen with
bangs and braces. In the photograph taken just six months later (after
chemotherapy), she was transformed—bald, sheet-white from anemia, and
severely underweight, collapsed on a wheelchair and unable to walk.</p>
<p>Ella was treated with VAMP. (Her oncologists in Boston, having heard
of the spectacular responses at the NCI, had rather bravely chosen to
treat her—off trial—with the four-drug regimen.) It had seemed like a
cataclysm at first. The high doses of vincristine caused such severe
collateral nerve damage that she was left with a permanent burning
sensation in her legs and fingers. Prednisone made her delirious. The
nurses, unable to deal with a strong-willed, deranged preteen wandering
through the corridors of the hospital screaming and howling at night,
restrained her by tying her arms with ropes to the bedposts. Confined to
her bed, she often crouched in a fetal position, her muscles wasting
away, the neuropathy worsening. At twelve years of age, she became
addicted to morphine, which was prescribed for her pain. (She “detoxed”
herself by sheer force of will, she said, by “lasting it out through the
spasms of withdrawal.”) Her lower lip is still bruised from the time she
bit herself in those awful months while waiting out the hour for the
next dose of morphine.</p>
<p>Yet, remarkably, the main thing she remembers is the overwhelming
feeling of being spared. “I feel as if I slipped through,” she told me,
arranging the records back into their envelopes. She looked away, as if
to swat an imaginary fly, and I could see her eyes welling up with
tears. She had met several other children with leukemia in the hospital
wards; none had survived. “I don’t know why I deserved the illness in
the first place, but then I don’t know why I deserved to be cured.
Leukemia is like that. It mystifies you. It changes your life.” My mind
briefly flashed to the Chiribaya mummy, to Atossa, to Halsted’s young
woman awaiting her mastectomy.</p>
<p>Sidney Farber never met Ella, but he encountered patients just like
her—long-term survivors of VAMP. In 1964, the year that Ella began her
chemotherapy, he triumphantly brought photographs of a few such patients
to Washington as a sort of show-and-tell for Congress, living proof that
chemotherapy could cure cancer. The path was now becoming increasingly
clear to him. Cancer research needed an additional thrust: more money,
more research, more publicity, and a directed trajectory toward a cure.
His testimony before Congress thus acquired a nearly devotional,
messianic fervor. After the photographs and his testimony, one observer
recalled, any further proof was “anticlimactic and unnecessary.” Farber
was now ready to leap out from the realm of leukemia into the vastly
more common real cancers. “We are attempting to develop chemicals which
might affect otherwise incurable tumors of the breast, the ovary, the
uterus, the lung, the kidney, the intestine, and highly malignant tumors
of the skin, such as the black cancer, or melanoma,” he wrote. The cure
of even one such solid cancer in adults, Farber knew, would singularly
revolutionize oncology. It would provide the most concrete proof that
this was a winnable war.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since most of the early anticancer drugs were
cytotoxic—cell-killing—the threshold between a therapeutic
(cancer-killing) dose and a toxic dose was extremely narrow. Many of the
drugs had to be very carefully dosed to avoid the unwarranted but
inextricably linked toxicity.</li>
