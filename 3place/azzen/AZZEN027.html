<h4 id="halsteds-ashes">Halsted’s Ashes</h4>
<p>I would rather be ashes than dust.</p>
<p>—Jack London</p>
<p>Will you turn me out if I can’t get better?</p>
<p>—A cancer patient to</p>
<p>her physician, 1960s</p>
<p>Moya Cole’s tamoxifen trial was initially designed to treat women
with advanced, metastatic breast cancer. But as the trial progressed,
Cole began to wonder about an alternative strategy. Typically, clinical
trials of new cancer drugs tend to escalate inexorably toward sicker and
sicker patients (as news of a novel drug spreads, more and more
desperate patients lurch toward last-ditch efforts to save their lives).
But Cole was inclined to journey in the opposite direction. What if
women with earlier-stage tumors were treated with tamoxifen? If a drug
could halt the progression of diffusely metastatic and aggressive stage
IV cancers, might it work even better on more localized, stage II breast
cancers, cancers that had spread only to the regional lymph nodes?</p>
<p>Unwittingly, Cole had come full circle toward Halsted’s logic.
Halsted had invented the radical mastectomy based on the premise that
early breast cancer needed to be attacked exhaustively and
definitively—by surgically “cleansing” every conceivable reservoir of
the disease, even when no visible cancer was present. The result had
been the grotesque and disfiguring mastectomy, foisted indiscriminately
on women with even small, locally restricted tumors to stave off
relapses and metastasis into distant organs. But Cole now wondered
whether Halsted had tried to cleanse the Augean stables of cancer with
all the right intentions, but with the wrong tools. Surgery could not
eliminate invisible reservoirs of cancer. But perhaps what was needed
was a potent chemical—a systemic therapy, Willy Meyer’s dreamed-about
“after-treatment” from 1932.</p>
<p>A variant of this idea had already gripped a band of renegade
researchers at the NCI even before tamoxifen had appeared on the
horizon. In 1963, nearly a decade before Moya Cole completed her
experiments in Manchester, a thirty-three-year-old oncologist at the
NCI, Paul Carbone, had launched a trial to see if chemotherapy might be
effective when administered to women after an early-stage primary tumor
had been completely removed surgically—i.e., women with no visible tumor
remaining in the body. Carbone had been inspired by the patron saint of
renegades at the NCI: Min Chiu Li, the researcher who had been expelled
from the institute for treating women with placental tumors with
methotrexate long after their tumors had visibly disappeared.</p>
<p>Li had been packed off in ignominy, but the strategy that had undone
him—using chemotherapy to “cleanse” the body of residual tumor—had
gained increasing respectability at the institute. In his small trial,
Carbone found that adding chemotherapy after surgery decreased the rate
of relapse from breast cancer. To describe this form of treatment,
Carbone and his team used the word adjuvant, from the Latin phrase “to
help.” Adjuvant chemotherapy, Carbone conjectured, could be the
surgeon’s little helper. It would eradicate microscopic deposits of
cancer left behind after surgery, thus extirpating any remnant
reservoirs of malignancy in the body in early breast cancer—in essence,
completing the Herculean cancer-cleansing task that Halsted had set for
himself.</p>
<p>But surgeons had no interest in getting help from anyone—least of all
chemotherapists. By the mid-1960s, as radical surgery became
increasingly embattled, most breast surgeons had begun to view
chemotherapists as estranged rivals that could not be trusted with
anything, least of all improving surgical outcomes. And since surgeons
largely dominated the field of breast cancer (and saw all the patients
upon diagnosis), Carbone could not ramp up his trial because he could
barely recruit any patients. “Except for an occasional woman who
underwent a mastectomy at the NCI . . . the study never got off the
ground,” Carbone recalled.</p>
<p>But Carbone found an alternative. Shunned by surgeons, he now turned
to the surgeon who had shunned his own compatriots—Bernie Fisher, the
man caught in the controversial swirl of testing radical breast surgery.
Fisher was instantly interested in Carbone’s idea. Indeed, Fisher had
been trying to run a trial along similar lines—combining chemotherapy
with surgical mastectomy. But even Fisher could pick only one fight at a
time. With his own trial, the NSABP-04 (the trial to test radical
surgery versus nonradical surgery) barely limping along, he could hardly
convince surgeons to join a trial to combine chemo and surgery in breast
cancer.</p>
<p>An Italian team came to the rescue. In 1972, as the NCI was scouring
the nation for a site where “adjuvant chemotherapy” after surgery could
be tested, the oncologist Gianni Bonadonna came to Bethesda to visit the
institute. Suave, personable, and sophisticated, impeccably dressed in
custom-cut Milanese suits, Bonadonna made an instant impression at the
NCI. He learned from DeVita, Canellos, and Carbone that they had been
testing combinations of drugs to treat advanced breast cancer and had
found a concoction that would likely work: Cytoxan (a cousin of nitrogen
mustard), methotrexate (a variant of Farber’s aminopterin), and
fluorouracil (an inhibitor of DNA synthesis). The regimen, called CMF,
could be tolerated with relatively minimal side effects, yet was active
enough in combination to thwart microscopic tumors—an ideal combination
to be used as an adjuvant in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Bonadonna worked at a large cancer center in Milan called the
Istituto Tumori, where he had a close friendship with the chief breast
surgeon, Umberto Veronesi. Convinced by Carbone (who was still
struggling to get a similar trial launched in America), Bonadonna and
Veronesi, the only surgeon-chemotherapist pair seemingly on talking
terms with each other, proposed a large randomized trial to study
chemotherapy after breast surgery for early-stage breast cancer. They
were immediately awarded the contract for the NCI trial.</p>
<p>The irony of that award could hardly have escaped the researchers at
the institute. In America, the landscape of cancer medicine had become
so deeply gashed by internal rifts that the most important NCI-sponsored
trial of cytotoxic chemotherapy to be launched after the announcement of
the War on Cancer had to be relocated to a foreign country.</p>
<p>Bonadonna began his trial in the summer of 1973. By the early winter
that year, he had randomized nearly four hundred women to the trial—half
to no treatment and half to treatment with CMF. Veronesi was a crucial
supporter, but there was still little interest from other breast
surgeons. “The surgeons were not just skeptical,” Bonadonna recalled.
“They were hostile. [They] did not want to know. At the time there were
very few chemotherapists, and they were not rated highly, and the
attitude among surgeons was ‘chemotherapists deliver drugs in advanced
disease [while] surgeons operate and we have complete remission for the
entire life of the patient. . . . Surgeons rarely saw their patients
again, and I think they didn’t want to hear about how many patients were
being failed by surgery alone. It was a matter of prestige.’”</p>
<p>On an overcast morning in the winter of 1975, Bonadonna flew to
Brussels to present his results at a conference of European oncologists.
The trial had just finished its second year. But the two groups,
Bonadonna reported, had clearly parted ways. Nearly half the women
treated with no therapy had relapsed. In contrast, only a third of the
women treated with the adjuvant regimen had relapsed. Adjuvant
chemotherapy had prevented breast cancer relapses in about one in every
six treated women.</p>
<p>The news was so unexpected that it was greeted by a stunned silence
in the auditorium. Bonadonna’s presentation had shaken the terra firma
of cancer chemotherapy. It was only on the flight back to Milan, ten
thousand feet above the earth, that Bonadonna was finally inundated with
questions about his trial by other researchers on his flight.</p>
<p>Gianni Bonadonna’s remarkable Milanese trial left a question almost
begging to be answered. If adjuvant CMF chemotherapy could decrease
relapses in women with early-stage breast cancer, then might adjuvant
tamoxifen—the other active breast cancer drug established by Cole’s
group—also decrease relapses in women with localized ER-positive breast
cancer after surgery? Had Moya Cole been right about her instinct in
treating early-stage breast cancer with antiestrogen therapy?</p>
<p>This was a question that Bernie Fisher, although embroiled in several
other trials, could not resist trying to answer. In January 1977, five
years after Cole had published her results on tamoxifen in metastatic
cancer, Fisher recruited 1,891 women with estrogen receptor–positive
(ER-positive) breast cancer that had spread only to the axillary nodes.
He treated half with adjuvant tamoxifen and the other half with no
tamoxifen. By 1981, the two groups had deviated sharply. Treatment with
tamoxifen after surgery reduced cancer relapse rates by nearly 50
percent. The effect was particularly pronounced among women above fifty
years old—a group most resistant to standard chemotherapy regimens and
most likely to relapse with aggressive, metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>Three years later, in ’85, when Fisher reanalyzed the deviating
curves of relapse and survival, the effect of tamoxifen treatment was
even more dramatic. Among the five-hundred-odd women older than fifty
assigned to each group, tamoxifen had prevented fifty-five relapses and
deaths. Fisher had altered the biology of breast cancer after surgery
using a targeted hormonal drug that had barely any significant side
effects.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, brave new paradigms of treatment had thus arisen
out of the ashes of old paradigms. Halsted’s fantasy of attacking
early-stage cancers was reborn as adjuvant therapy. Ehrlich’s “magic
bullet” for cancer was reincarnated as antihormone therapy for breast
and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Neither method of treatment professed to be a complete cure. Adjuvant
therapy and hormonal therapy typically did not obliterate cancer.
Hormonal therapy produced prolonged remissions that could stretch into
years or even decades. Adjuvant therapy was mainly a cleansing method to
purge the body of residual cancer cells; it lengthened survival, but
many patients eventually relapsed. In the end, often after decades of
remission, chemotherapy-resistant and hormone-resistant cancers grew
despite the prior interventions, flinging aside the equilibrium
established during the treatment.</p>
<p>But although these alternatives did not offer definitive cures,
several important principles of cancer biology and cancer therapy were
firmly cemented in these powerful trials. First, as Kaplan had found
with Hodgkin’s disease, these trials again clearly etched the message
that cancer was enormously heterogeneous. Breast or prostate cancers
came in an array of forms, each with unique biological behaviors. The
heterogeneity was genetic: in breast cancer, for instance, some variants
responded to hormonal treatment, while others were hormone-unresponsive.
And the heterogeneity was anatomic: some cancers were localized to the
breast when detected, while others had a propensity to spread to distant
organs.</p>
<p>Second, understanding that heterogeneity was of deep consequence.
“Know thine enemy” runs the adage, and Fisher’s and Bonadonna’s trials
had shown that it was essential to “know” the cancer as intimately as
possible before rushing to treat it. The meticulous separation of breast
cancer into distinct stages, for instance, was a crucial prerequisite to
the success of Bonadonna’s study: early-stage breast cancer could not be
treated like late-stage breast cancer. The meticulous separation of
ER-positive and ER-negative cancers was crucial to Fisher’s study: if
tamoxifen had indiscriminately been tested on ER-negative breast cancer,
the drug would have been discarded as having no benefit.</p>
<p>This nuanced understanding of cancer underscored by these trials had
a sobering effect on cancer medicine. As Frank Rauscher, the director of
the NCI, put it in 1985, “We were all more naive a decade ago. We hoped
that a single application of drugs would result in a dramatic benefit.
We now understand it’s much more complicated than that. People are
optimistic but we’re not expecting home runs. Right now, people would be
happy with a series of singles or doubles.”</p>
<p>Yet the metaphorical potency of battling and obliterating cancer
relatively indiscriminately (“one cause, one cure”) still gripped
oncology. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy were like truces
declared in the battle—signs, merely, that a more aggressive attack was
necessary. The allure of deploying a full armamentarium of cytotoxic
drugs—of driving the body to the edge of death to rid it of its
malignant innards—was still irresistible. So cancer medicine charged on,
even if it meant relinquishing sanctity, sanity, or safety. Pumped up
with self-confidence, bristling with conceit, and hypnotized by the
potency of medicine, oncologists pushed their patients—and their
discipline—to the brink of disaster. “We shall so poison the atmosphere
of the first act,” the biologist James Watson warned about the future of
cancer in 1977, “that no one of decency shall want to see the play
through to the end.”</p>
<p>For many cancer patients caught in the first act, there was little
choice but to see the poisonous play to its end.</p>
<p>“More is more,” a patient’s daughter told me curtly. (I had suggested
to her delicately that for some patients with cancer, “Less might be
more.”) The patient was an elderly Italian woman with liver cancer that
had metastasized widely throughout her abdomen. She had come to the
Massachusetts General Hospital seeking chemotherapy, surgery, or
radiation—if possible, all three. She spoke halting, heavily accented
English, often pausing between her words to catch her breath. Her skin
had a yellow-gray tinge—a tinge, I was worried, that would bloom into a
bright jaundice if the tumor obstructed her bile duct fully and her
blood began to fill up with bile pigments. Exhausted, she drifted in and
out of sleep even while I was examining her. I asked her to hold the
palms of her hands straight upward, as if halting traffic, looking for
signs of a subtle flapping motion that often predates liver failure.
Thankfully, there was no tremor, but the abdomen had a dull, full sound
of fluid building up inside it, likely full of malignant cells.</p>
<p>The daughter was a physician, and she watched me with intense,
hawklike eyes while I finished the exam. She was devoted to her mother,
with the reversed—and twice as fierce—maternal instinct that marks the
poignant moment of midlife when the roles of mother and daughter begin
to switch. The daughter wanted the best possible care for her mother—the
best doctors, the best room with the best view of Beacon Hill, and the
best, strongest, and toughest medicine that privilege and money could
buy.</p>
<p>The elderly woman, meanwhile, would hardly tolerate even the mildest
drug. Her liver had not failed yet but was on the verge of doing so, and
subtle signs suggested her kidneys were barely functioning. I suggested
that we try a palliative drug, perhaps a single chemotherapeutic agent
that might just ameliorate her symptoms rather than pushing for a
tougher regimen to try to cure an incurable disease.</p>
<p>The daughter looked at me as if I were mad. “I came here to get
treatment, not consolations about hospice,” she finally said, glowering
with fury.</p>
<p>I promised to reconsider by asking more experienced doctors to weigh
in. Perhaps I had been too hasty in my caution. But in a few weeks, I
learned that she and her daughter had found another doctor, presumably
someone who had acquiesced more readily to their demands. I do not know
whether the elderly woman died from cancer or its cure.</p>
<p>Yet a third voice of dissent arose in oncology in the 1980s, although
this voice had skirted the peripheries of cancer for several centuries.
As trial after trial of chemotherapy and surgery failed to chisel down
the mortality rate for advanced cancers, a generation of surgeons and
chemotherapists, unable to cure patients, began to learn (or relearn)
the art of caring for patients.</p>
<p>It was a fitful and uncomfortable lesson. Palliative care, the branch
of medicine that focuses on symptom relief and comfort, had been
perceived as the antimatter of cancer therapy, the negative to its
positive, an admission of failure to its rhetoric of success. The word
palliate comes from the Latin palliare, “to cloak”—and providing pain
relief was perceived as cloaking the essence of the illness, smothering
symptoms rather than attacking disease. Writing about pain relief, a
Boston surgeon thus reasoned in the 1950s: “If there is persistent pain
which cannot be relieved by direct surgical attack on the pathological
lesion itself . . ., relief can be obtained only by surgical
interruption of sensory pathways.” The only alternative to surgery was
more surgery—fire to fight fire. Pain-relieving opiate drugs such as
morphine or fentanyl were deliberately denied. “If surgery is withheld,”
the writer continued, “the sufferer is doomed to opiate addiction,
physical deterioration or even suicide”—an ironic consideration, since
Halsted himself, while devising his theory of radical surgery, had
swiveled between his twin addictions to cocaine and morphine.</p>
<p>The movement to restore sanity and sanctity to the end-of-life care
of cancer patients emerged, predictably, not from cure-obsessed America
but from Europe. Its founder was Cecily Saunders, a former nurse who had
retrained as a physician in England. In the late 1940s, Saunders had
tended to a Jewish refugee from Warsaw dying of cancer in London. The
man had left Saunders his life savings—£500—with a desire to be “a
window in [her] home.” As Saunders entered and explored the forsaken
cancer wards of London’s East End in the fifties, she began to decipher
that cryptic request in a more visceral sense: she encountered
terminally ill patients denied dignity, pain relief, and often even
basic medical care—their lives confined, sometimes literally, to rooms
without windows. These “hopeless” cases, Saunders found, had become the
pariahs of oncology, unable to find any place in its rhetoric of battle
and victory, and thus pushed, like useless, wounded soldiers, out of
sight and mind.</p>
<p>Saunders responded to this by inventing, or rather resurrecting, a
counterdiscipline—palliative medicine. (She avoided the phrase
palliative care because care, she wrote, “is a soft word” that would
never win respectability in the medical world.) If oncologists could not
bring themselves to provide care for their terminally ill patients, she
would leverage other specialists—psychiatrists, anesthesiologists,
geriatricians, physical therapists, and neurologists—to help patients
die painlessly and gracefully. And she would physically remove the dying
from the oncology wards: in 1967, she created a hospice in London to
care specifically for the terminally ill and dying, evocatively naming
it St. Christopher’s—not after the patron saint of death, but after the
patron saint of travelers.</p>
<p>It would take a full decade for Saunders’s movement to travel to
America and penetrate its optimism-fortified oncology wards. “The
resistance to providing palliative care to patients,” a ward nurse
recalls, “was so deep that doctors would not even look us in the eye
when we recommended that they stop their efforts to save lives and start
saving dignity instead . . . doctors were allergic to the smell of
death. Death meant failure, defeat—their death, the death of medicine,
the death of oncology.”</p>
<p>Providing end-of-life care required a colossal act of reimagination
and reinvention. Trials on pain and pain relief—trials executed with no
less rigor or precision than those launched to test novel drugs and
surgical protocols—toppled several dogmas about pain and revealed new
and unexpected foundational principles. Opiates, used liberally and
compassionately on cancer patients, did not cause addiction,
deterioration, and suicide; instead, they relieved the punishing cycle
of anxiety, pain, and despair. New antinausea drugs were deployed that
vastly improved the lives of patients on chemotherapy. The first hospice
in the United States was launched at Yale–New Haven Hospital in 1974. By
the early 1980s, hospices for cancer patients built on Saunders’s model
had sprouted up worldwide—most prominently in Britain, where nearly two
hundred hospice centers were operating by the end of that decade.</p>
<p>Saunders refused to recognize this enterprise as pitted “against”
cancer. “The provision of . . . terminal care,” she wrote, “should not
be thought of as a separate and essentially negative part of the attack
on cancer. This is not merely the phase of defeat, hard to contemplate
and unrewarding to carry out. In many ways its principles are
fundamentally the same as those which underlie all other stages of care
and treatment, although its rewards are different.”</p>
<p>This, too, then, was knowing the enemy.</p>
