<h4 id="new-drugs-for-old-cancers">New Drugs for Old Cancers</h4>
<p>In the story of Patroclus</p>
<p>No one survives, not even Achilles</p>
<p>Who was nearly a god.</p>
<p>Patroclus resembled him; they wore</p>
<p>The same armor</p>
<p>—Louise Glück</p>
<p>The perfect therapy has not been developed. Most of us believe that
it will not involve toxic cytotoxic therapy, which is why we support the
kinds of basic investigations that are directed towards more fundamental
understanding of tumor biology. But . . . we must do the best with what
we now have.</p>
<p>—Bruce Chabner to Rose Kushner</p>
<p>In the legend, Achilles was quickly dipped into the river Styx, held
up only by the tendon of his heel. Touched by the dark sheath of water,
every part of his body was instantly rendered impervious to even the
most lethal weapon—except the undipped tendon. A simple arrow targeted
to that vulnerable heel would eventually kill Achilles in the
battlefields of Troy.</p>
<p>Before the 1980s, the armamentarium of cancer therapy was largely
built around two fundamental vulnerabilities of cancer cells. The first
is that most cancers originate as local diseases before they spread
systemically. Surgery and radiation therapy exploit this vulnerability.
By physically excising locally restricted tumors before cancer cells can
spread—or by searing cancer cells with localized bursts of powerful
energy using X-rays—surgery and radiation attempt to eliminate cancer en
bloc from the body.</p>
<p>The second vulnerability is the rapid growth rate of cancer cells.
Most chemotherapy drugs discovered before the 1980s target this second
vulnerability. Antifolates, such as Farber’s aminopterin, interrupt the
metabolism of folic acid and starve all cells of a crucial nutrient
required for cell division. Nitrogen mustard and cisplatin chemically
react with DNA, and DNA-damaged cells cannot duplicate their genes and
thus cannot divide. Vincristine, the periwinkle poison, thwarts the
ability of a cell to construct the molecular “scaffold” required for all
cells to divide.</p>
<p>But these two traditional Achilles’ heels of cancer—local growth and
rapid cell division—can only be targeted to a point. Surgery and
radiation are intrinsically localized strategies, and they fail when
cancer cells have spread beyond the limits of what can be surgically
removed or irradiated. More surgery thus does not lead to more cures, as
the radical surgeons discovered to their despair in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Targeting cellular growth also hits a biological ceiling because
normal cells must grow as well. Growth may be the hallmark of cancer,
but it is equally the hallmark of life. A poison directed at cellular
growth, such as vincristine or cisplatin, eventually attacks normal
growth, and cells that grow most rapidly in the body begin to bear the
collateral cost of chemotherapy. Hair falls out. Blood involutes. The
lining of the skin and gut sloughs off. More drugs produce more toxicity
without producing cures, as the radical chemotherapists discovered to
their despair in the 1980s.</p>
<p>To target cancer cells with novel therapies, scientists and
physicians needed new vulnerabilities that were unique to cancer. The
discoveries of cancer biology in the 1980s offered a vastly more nuanced
view of these vulnerabilities. Three new principles emerged,
representing three new Achilles’ heels of cancer.</p>
<p>First, cancer cells are driven to grow because of the accumulation of
mutations in their DNA. These mutations activate internal
proto-oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressor genes, thus unleashing
the “accelerators” and “brakes” that operate during normal cell
division. Targeting these hyperactive genes, while sparing their
modulated normal precursors, might be a novel means to attack cancer
cells more discriminately.</p>
<p>Second, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes typically lie at
the hubs of cellular signaling pathways. Cancer cells divide and grow
because they are driven by hyperactive or inactive signals in these
critical pathways. These pathways exist in normal cells but are tightly
regulated. The potential dependence of a cancer cell on such permanently
activated pathways is a second potential vulnerability of a cancer
cell.</p>
<p>Third, the relentless cycle of mutation, selection, and survival
creates a cancer cell that has acquired several additional properties
besides uncontrolled growth. These include the capacity to resist death
signals, to metastasize throughout the body, and to incite the growth of
blood vessels. These “hallmarks of cancer” are not invented by the
cancer cell; they are typically derived from the corruption of similar
processes that occur in the normal physiology of the body. The acquired
dependence of a cancer cell on these processes is a third potential
vulnerability of cancer.</p>
<p>The central therapeutic challenge of the newest cancer medicine,
then, was to find, among the vast numbers of similarities in normal
cells and cancer cells, subtle differences in genes, pathways, and
acquired capabilities—and to drive a poisoned stake into that new
heel.</p>
<p>It was one thing to identify an Achilles’ heel—and quite another to
discover a weapon that would strike it. Until the late 1980s, no drug
had reversed an oncogene’s activation or a tumor suppressor’s
inactivation. Even tamoxifen, the most specific cancer-targeted drug
discovered to that date, works by attacking the dependence of certain
breast cancer cells on estrogen, and not by directly inactivating an
oncogene or oncogene-activated pathway. In 1986, the discovery of the
first oncogene-targeted drug would thus instantly galvanize cancer
medicine. Although found largely serendipitously, the mere existence of
such a molecule would set the stage for the vast drug-hunting efforts of
the next decade.</p>
<p>The disease that stood at the pivotal crossroads of oncology was yet
another rare variant of leukemia called acute promyelocytic
leukemia—APL. First identified as a distinct form of adult leukemia in
the 1950s, the disease has a distinct characteristic: the cells in this
form of cancer do not merely divide rapidly, they are also strikingly
frozen in immature development. Normal white blood cells developing in
the bone marrow undergo a series of maturational steps to develop into
fully functional adult cells. One such intermediate cell is termed a
promyelocyte, an adolescent cell on the verge of becoming functionally
mature. APL is characterized by the malignant proliferation of these
immature promyelocytes. Normal promyelocytes are loaded with toxic
enzymes and granules that are usually released by adult white blood
cells to kill viruses, bacteria, and parasites. In promyelocytic
leukemia, the blood fills up with these toxin-loaded promyelocytes.
Moody, mercurial, and jumpy, the cells of APL can release their
poisonous granules on a whim—precipitating massive bleeding or
simulating a septic reaction in the body. In APL, the pathological
proliferation of cancer thus comes with a fiery twist. Most cancers
contain cells that refuse to stop growing. In APL, the cancer cells also
refuse to grow up.</p>
<p>Since the early 1970s, this maturation arrest of APL cells had
prompted scientists to hunt for a chemical that might force these cells
to mature. Scores of drugs had been tested on APL cells in test tubes,
and only one had stood out—retinoic acid, an oxidized form of vitamin A.
But retinoic acid, researchers had found, was a vexingly unreliable
reagent. One batch of the acid might mature APL cells, while another
batch of the same chemical might fail. Frustrated by these flickering,
unfathomable responses, biologists and chemists had turned away after
their initial enthusiasm for the maturation chemical.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1985, a team of leukemia researchers from China
traveled to France to meet Laurent Degos, a hematologist at Saint Louis
Hospital in Paris with a long-standing interest in APL. The Chinese
team, led by Zhen Yi Wang, was also treating APL patients, at Ruijin
Hospital, a busy, urban clinical center in Shanghai, China. Both Degos
and Wang had tried standard chemotherapy agents—drugs that target
rapidly growing cells—to promote remissions in APL patients, but the
results had been dismal. Wang and Degos spoke of the need for a new
strategy to attack this whimsical, lethal disease, and they kept
circling back to the peculiar immaturity of APL cells and to the lapsed
search for a maturation agent for the disease.</p>
<p>Retinoic acid, Wang and Degos knew, comes in two closely related
molecular forms, called cis-retinoic acid and trans-retinoic acid. The
two forms are compositionally identical, but possess a slight difference
in their molecular structure, and they behave very differently in
molecular reactions. (Cis-retinoic acid and trans-retinoic acid have the
same atoms, but the atoms are arranged differently in the two
chemicals.) Of the two forms, cis-retinoic acid had been the most
intensively tested, and it had produced the flickering, transient
responses. But Wang and Degos wondered if trans-retinoic acid was the
true maturation agent. Had the unreliable responses in the old
experiments been due to a low and variable amount of the trans-retinoic
form present in every batch of retinoic acid?</p>
<p>Wang, who had studied at a French Jesuit school in Shanghai, spoke a
lilting, heavily accented French. Linguistic and geographic barriers
breached, the two hematologists outlined an international collaboration.
Wang knew of a pharmaceutical factory outside Shanghai that could
produce pure trans-retinoic acid—without the admixture of cis-retinoic
acid. He would test the drug on APL patients at the Ruijin Hospital.
Degos’s team in Paris would follow after the initial round of testing in
China and further validate the strategy on French APL patients.</p>
<p>Wang launched his trial in 1986 with twenty-four patients.
Twenty-three experienced a dazzling response. Leukemic promyelocytes in
the blood underwent a brisk maturation into white blood cells. “The
nucleus became larger,” Wang wrote, “and fewer primary granules were
observed in the cytoplasm. On the fourth day of culture, these cells
gave rise to myelocytes containing specific, or secondary, granules . .
. [indicating the development of] fully mature granulocytes.”</p>
<p>Then something even more unexpected occurred: having fully matured,
the cancer cells began to die out. In some patients, the differentiation
and death erupted so volcanically that the bone marrow swelled up with
differentiated promyelocytes and then emptied slowly over weeks as the
cancer cells matured and underwent an accelerated cycle of death. The
sudden maturation of cancer cells produced a short-lived metabolic
disarray, which was controlled with medicines, but the only other side
effects of trans-retinoic acid were dryness of lips and mouth and an
occasional rash. The remissions produced by trans-retinoic acid lasted
weeks and often months.</p>
<p>Acute promyelocytic leukemia still relapsed, typically about three to
four months after treatment with trans-retinoic acid. The Paris and
Shanghai teams next combined standard chemotherapy drugs with
trans-retinoic acid—a cocktail of old and new drugs—and remissions were
prolonged by several additional months. In about three-fourths of the
patients, the leukemia remission began to stretch into a full year, then
into five years. By 1993, Wang and Degos concluded that 75 percent of
their patients treated with the combination of trans-retinoic acid and
standard chemotherapy would never relapse—a percentage unheard of in the
history of APL.</p>
<p>Cancer biologists would need another decade to explain the startling
Ruijin responses at a molecular level. The key to the explanation lay in
the elegant studies performed by Janet Rowley, the Chicago cytologist.
In 1984, Rowley had identified a unique translocation in the chromosomes
of APL cells—a fragment of a gene from chromosome fifteen fused with a
fragment of a gene from chromosome seventeen. This created an activated
“chimeric” oncogene that drove the proliferation of promyelocytes and
blocked their maturation, thus creating the peculiar syndrome of
APL.</p>
<p>In 1990, a full four years after Wang’s clinical trial in Shanghai,
this culprit oncogene was isolated by independent teams of scientists
from France, Italy, and America. The APL oncogene, scientists found,
encodes a protein that is tightly bound by trans-retinoic acid. This
binding immediately extinguishes the oncogene’s signal in APL cells,
thereby explaining the rapid, powerful remissions observed in
Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Ruijin discovery was remarkable: trans-retinoic acid represented
the long-sought fantasy of molecular oncology—an oncogene-targeted
cancer drug. But the discovery was a fantasy lived backward. Wang and
Degos had first stumbled on trans-retinoic acid through inspired
guesswork—and only later discovered that the molecule could directly
target an oncogene.</p>
<p>But was it possible to make the converse journey—starting from
oncogene and going to drug? Indeed, Robert Weinberg’s lab in Boston had
already begun that converse journey, although Weinberg himself was
largely oblivious of it.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, Weinberg’s lab had perfected a technique to
isolate cancer-causing genes directly out of cancer cells. Using
Weinberg’s technique, researchers had isolated dozens of new oncogenes
from cancer cells. In 1982, a postdoctoral scientist from Bombay working
in Weinberg’s lab, Lakshmi Charon Padhy, reported the isolation of yet
another such oncogene from a rat tumor called a neuroblastoma. Weinberg
christened the gene neu, naming it after the type of cancer that
harbored this gene.</p>
<p>Neu was added to the growing list of oncogenes, but it was an
anomaly. Cells are bounded by a thin membrane of lipids and proteins
that acts as an oily barrier against the entry of many drugs. Most
oncogenes discovered thus far, such as ras and myc, are sequestered
inside the cell (ras is bound to the cell membrane but faces into the
cell), making them inaccessible to drugs that cannot penetrate the cell
membrane. The product of the neu gene, in contrast, was a novel protein,
not hidden deep inside the cell, but tethered to the cell membrane with
a large fragment that hung outside, freely accessible to any drug.</p>
<p>Lakshmi Charon Padhy even had a “drug” to test. In 1981, while
isolating his gene, he had created an antibody against the new neu
protein. Antibodies are molecules designed to bind to other molecules,
and the binding can occasionally block and inactivate the bound protein.
But antibodies are unable to cross the cell membrane and need an exposed
protein outside the cell to bind. Neu, then, was a perfect target, with
a large portion, a long molecular “foot,” projected tantalizingly
outside the cell membrane. It would have taken Padhy no more than an
afternoon’s experiment to add the neu antibody to the neuroblastoma
cells to determine the binding’s effect. “It would have been an
overnight test,” Weinberg would later recall. “I can flagellate myself.
If I had been more studious and more focused and not as monomaniacal
about the ideas I had at that time, I would have made that
connection.”</p>
<p>Despite the trail of seductive leads, Padhy and Weinberg never got
around to doing their experiment. Afternoon upon afternoon passed.
Introspective and bookish, Padhy shuffled through the lab in a
threadbare coat in the winter, running his experiments privately and
saying little about them to others. And although Padhy’s discovery was
published in a high-profile scientific journal, few scientists noticed
that he might have stumbled on a potential anticancer drug (the
neu-binding antibody was buried in an obscure figure in the article).
Even Weinberg, caught in the giddy upswirl of new oncogenes and obsessed
with the basic biology of the cancer cell, simply forgot about the neu
experiment.*</p>
<p>Weinberg had an oncogene and possibly an oncogene-blocking drug, but
the twain had never met (in human cells or bodies). In the neuroblastoma
cells dividing in his incubators, neu rampaged on monomaniacally,
single-mindedly, seemingly invincible. Yet its molecular foot still
waved just outside the surface of the plasma membrane, exposed and
vulnerable, like Achilles’ famous heel.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1986, Jeffrey Drebin and Mark Greene showed that treatment with
an anti-neu antibody arrested the growth of cancer cells. But the
prospect of developing this antibody into a human anticancer drug eluded
all groups.</li>
