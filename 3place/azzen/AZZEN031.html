<h4 id="a-thief-in-the-night">“A thief in the night”</h4>
<p>By the way, [my cancer] is a squamous cell cancer apparently like all
the other smokers’ lung cancers. I don’t think anyone can bring up a
very forcible argument against the idea of a causal connection with
smoking because after all I had smoked for about 50 years before
stopping.</p>
<p>—Evarts Graham to Ernst Wynder, 1957</p>
<p>We believe the products that we make are not injurious to health. We
always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it
is to safeguard public health.</p>
<p>—“A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers,”</p>
<p>a full-page advertisement produced</p>
<p>by the tobacco industry in 1954</p>
<p>Richard Doll and Bradford Hill published their prospective study on
lung cancer in 1956—the very year that the fraction of smokers in the
adult American population reached its all-time peak at 45 percent. It
had been an epochal decade for cancer epidemiology, but equally, an
epochal decade for tobacco. Wars generally stimulate two industries,
ammunition and cigarettes, and indeed both the World Wars had potently
stimulated the already bloated tobacco industry. Cigarette sales had
climbed to stratospheric heights in the mid-1940s and continued to climb
in the ’50s. In a gargantuan replay of 1864, as tobacco-addicted
soldiers returned to civilian life, they brought even more public
visibility to their addiction.</p>
<p>To stoke its explosive growth in the postwar period, the cigarette
industry poured tens, then hundreds, of millions of dollars into
advertising. And if advertising had transformed the tobacco industry in
the past, the tobacco industry now transformed advertising. The most
striking innovation of this era was the targeting of cigarette
advertising to highly stratified consumers, as if to achieve exquisite
specificity. In the past, cigarettes had been advertised quite generally
to all consumers. By the early 1950s, though, cigarette ads, and
cigarette brands, were being “designed” for segmented groups: urban
workers, housewives, women, immigrants, African-Americans—and, to
preemptively bell the medical cat—doctors themselves. “More doctors
smoke Camels,” one advertisement reminded consumers, thus reassuring
patients of the safety of their smoking. Medical journals routinely
carried cigarette advertisements. At the annual conferences of the
American Medical Association in the early 1950s, cigarettes were
distributed free of charge to doctors, who lined up outside the tobacco
booths. In 1955, when Philip Morris introduced the Marlboro Man, its
most successful smoking icon to date, sales of the brand shot up by a
dazzling 5,000 percent over eight months. Marlboro promised a nearly
erotic celebration of tobacco and machismo rolled into a single,
seductive pack: “Man-sized taste of honest tobacco comes full through.
Smooth-drawing filter feels right in your mouth. Works fine but doesn’t
get in the way.” By the early 1960s, the gross annual sale of cigarettes
in America peaked at nearly billion, a number unparalleled in the
history of tobacco. On average, Americans were consuming nearly four
thousand cigarettes per year or about eleven cigarettes per day—nearly
one for every waking hour.</p>
<p>Public health organizations in America in the mid-1950s were largely
unperturbed by the link between tobacco and cancer delineated by the
Doll and Hill studies. Initially, few, if any, organizations highlighted
the study as an integral part of an anticancer campaign (although this
would soon change). But the tobacco industry was far from complacent.
Concerned that the ever-tightening link between tar, tobacco, and cancer
would eventually begin to frighten consumers away, cigarette makers
began to proactively tout the benefits of filters added to the tips of
their cigarettes as a “safety” measure. (The iconic Marlboro Man, with
his hypermasculine getup of lassos and tattoos, was an elaborate decoy
set up to prove that there was nothing effeminate or sissy about smoking
filter-tipped cigarettes.)</p>
<p>On December 28, 1953, three years before Doll’s prospective study had
been released to the public, the heads of several tobacco companies met
preemptively at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Bad publicity was clearly
looming on the horizon. To counteract the scientific attack, an equal
and opposite counterattack was needed.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of that counterattack was an advertisement titled “A
Frank Statement,” which saturated the news media in 1954, appearing
simultaneously in more than four hundred newspapers over a few weeks.
Written as an open letter from tobacco makers to the public, the
statement’s purpose was to address the fears and rumors about the
possible link between lung cancer and tobacco. In about six hundred
words, it would nearly rewrite the research on tobacco and cancer.</p>
<p>“A Frank Statement” was anything but frank. The speciousness began
right from its opening lines: “Recent reports on experiments with mice
have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some
way linked with lung cancer in human beings.” Nothing, in fact, could
have been further from the truth. The most damaging of the “recent
experiments” (and certainly the ones that had received the “widest
publicity”) were the Doll/Hill and Wynder/Graham retrospective
studies—both of which had been performed not on mice, but on humans. By
making the science seem obscure and arcane, those sentences sought to
render its results equally arcane. Evolutionary distance would force
emotional distance: after all, who could possibly care about lung cancer
in mice? (The epic perversity of all this was only to be revealed a
decade later when, confronted with a growing number of superlative human
studies, the tobacco lobby would counter that smoking had never been
effectively shown to cause lung cancer in, of all things, mice.)</p>
<p>Obfuscation of facts, though, was only the first line of defense. The
more ingenious form of manipulation was to gnaw at science’s own
self-doubt: “The statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with
the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other
aspects of modern life. Indeed the validity of the statistics themselves
is questioned by numerous scientists.” By half revealing and half
concealing the actual disagreements among scientists, the advertisement
performed a complex dance of veils. What, precisely, was being
“questioned by numerous scientists” (or what link was being claimed
between lung cancer and other features of “modern life”) was left
entirely to the reader’s imagination.</p>
<p>Obfuscation of facts and the reflection of self-doubt—the proverbial
combination of smoke and mirrors—might have sufficed for any ordinary
public relations campaign. But the final ploy was unrivaled in its
genius. Rather than discourage further research into the link between
tobacco and cancer, tobacco companies proposed letting scientists have
more of it: “We are pledging aid and assistance to the research effort
into all phases of tobacco use and health . . . in addition to what is
already being contributed by individual companies.” The implication was
that if more research was needed, then the issue was still mired in
doubt—and thus unresolved. Let the public have its addiction, and let
the researchers have theirs.</p>
<p>To bring this three-pronged strategy to fruition, the tobacco lobby
had already formed a “research committee,” which it called the Tobacco
Industry Research Committee, or the TIRC. Ostensibly, the TIRC would act
as an intermediary between an increasingly hostile academy, an
increasingly embattled tobacco industry, and an increasingly confused
public. In January 1954, after a protracted search, the TIRC announced
that it had finally chosen a director, who had—as the institute never
failed to remind the public—been ushered in from the deepest realms of
science. Their choice, as if to close the circle of ironies, was
Clarence Cook Little, the ambitious contrarian that the Laskerites had
once deposed as president of the American Society for the Control of
Cancer (ASCC).</p>
<p>If Clarence Little had not been discovered by the tobacco lobbyists
in 1954, then they might have needed to invent him: he came preformed to
their precise specifications. Opinionated, forceful, and voluble, Little
was a geneticist by training. He had set up a vast animal research
laboratory at Bar Harbor in Maine, which served as a repository for
purebred strains of mice for medical experiments. Purity and genetics
were Little’s preoccupations. He was a strong proponent of the theory
that all diseases, including cancer, were essentially hereditary, and
that these illnesses, in a form of medical ethnic-cleansing, would
eventually carry away those with such predispositions, leaving a
genetically enriched population resistant to diseases. This notion—call
it eugenics lite—was equally applied to lung cancer, which he also
considered principally the product of a genetic aberration. Smoking,
Little argued, merely unveiled that inherent aberration, causing that
bad germ to emerge and unfold in a human body. Blaming cigarettes for
lung cancer, then, was like blaming umbrellas for bringing on the rain.
The TIRC and the tobacco lobby vociferously embraced that view. Doll and
Hill, and Wynder and Graham, had certainly correlated smoking and lung
cancer. But correlation, Little insisted, could not be equated with
cause. In a guest editorial written for the journal Cancer Research in
1956, Little argued that if the tobacco industry was being blamed for
scientific dishonesty, then antitobacco activists bore the blame for
scientific disingenuousness. How could scientists so easily conflate a
mere confluence of two events—smoking and lung cancer—with a causal
relationship?</p>
<p>Graham, who knew Little from his days at the ASCC, was livid. In a
stinging rebuttal written to the editor, he complained, “A causal
relationship between heavy cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung is
stronger than for the efficacy of vaccination against smallpox, which is
only statistical.”</p>
<p>Indeed, like many of his epidemiologist peers, Graham was becoming
exasperated with the exaggerated scrutiny of the word cause. That word,
he believed, had outlived its original utility and turned into a
liability. In 1884, the microbiologist Robert Koch had stipulated that
for an agent to be defined as the “cause” of a disease, it would need to
fulfill at least three criteria. The causal agent had to be present in
diseased animals; it had to be isolated from diseased animals; and it
had to be capable of transmitting the disease when introduced into a
secondary host. But Koch’s postulates had arisen, crucially, from the
study of infectious diseases and infectious agents; they could not
simply be “repurposed” for many noninfectious diseases. In lung cancer,
for instance, it would be absurd to imagine a carcinogen being isolated
from a cancerous lung after months, or years, of the original exposure.
Transmission studies in mice were bound to be equally frustrating. As
Bradford Hill argued, “We may subject mice, or other laboratory animals,
to such an atmosphere of tobacco smoke that they can—like the old man in
the fairy story—neither sleep nor slumber; they can neither breed nor
eat. And lung cancers may or may not develop to a significant degree.
What then?”</p>
<p>Indeed, what then? With Wynder and other coworkers, Graham had tried
to expose mice to a toxic “atmosphere of tobacco smoke”—or at least its
closest conceivable equivalent. Persuading mice to chain-smoke was
obviously unlikely to succeed. So, in an inspired experiment performed
in his lab in St. Louis, Graham had invented a “smoking machine,” a
contraption that would puff the equivalent of hundreds of cigarettes all
day (Lucky Strikes were chosen) and deposit the tarry black residue,
through a maze of suction chambers, into a distilling flask of acetone.
By serially painting the tar on the skins of mice, Graham and Wynder had
found that they could create tumors on the backs of mice. But these
studies had, if anything, fanned up even more controversy. Forbes
magazine had famously spoofed the research by asking Graham, “How many
men distill their tar from their tobacco and paint it on their backs?”
And critics such as Little might well have complained that this
experiment was akin to distilling an orange to a millionth of a million
parts and then inferring, madly, that the original fruit was too
poisonous to eat.</p>
<p>Epidemiology, like the old man in Hill’s fairy story, was thus itself
huffing against the stifling economy of Koch’s postulates. The classical
triad—association, isolation, retransmission—would simply not suffice;
what preventive medicine needed was its own understanding of
“cause.”</p>
<p>Once again, Bradford Hill, the éminence grise of epidemiology,
proposed a solution to this impasse. For studies on chronic and complex
human diseases such as cancer, Hill suggested, the traditional
understanding of causality needed to be broadened and revised. If lung
cancer would not fit into Koch’s straitjacket, then the jacket needed to
be loosened. Hill acknowledged epidemiology’s infernal methodological
struggle with causation—this was not an experimental discipline at its
core—but he rose beyond it. At least in the case of lung cancer and
smoking, he argued, the association possessed several additional
features:</p>
<p>It was strong: the increased risk of cancer was nearly five- or
tenfold in smokers.</p>
<p>It was consistent: Doll and Hill’s study, and Wynder and Graham’s
study, performed in vastly different contexts on vastly different
populations, had come up with the same link.</p>
<p>It was specific: tobacco was linked to lung cancer—precisely the site
where tobacco smoke enters the body.</p>
<p>It was temporal: Doll and Hill had found that the longer one smoked,
the greater the increase in risk.</p>
<p>It possessed a “biological gradient”: the more one smoked in
quantity, the greater the risk for lung cancer.</p>
<p>It was plausible: a mechanistic link between an inhaled carcinogen
and a malignant change in the lung was not implausible.</p>
<p>It was coherent; it was backed by experimental evidence: the
epidemiological findings and the laboratory findings, such as Graham’s
tar-painting experiments in mice, were concordant.</p>
<p>It behaved similarly in analogous situations: smoking had been
correlated with lung cancer, and also with lip, throat, tongue, and
esophageal cancer.</p>
<p>Hill used these criteria to advance a radical proposition.
Epidemiologists, he argued, could infer causality by using that list of
nine criteria. No single item in that list proved a causal relationship.
Rather, Hill’s list functioned as a sort of à la carte menu, from which
scientists could pick and choose criteria to strengthen (or weaken) the
notion of a causal relationship. For scientific purists, this seemed
rococo—and, like all things rococo, all too easy to mock: imagine a
mathematician or physicist choosing from a “menu” of nine criteria to
infer causality. Yet Hill’s list would charge epidemiological research
with pragmatic clarity. Rather than fussing about the metaphysical idea
about causality (what, in the purest sense, constitutes “cause”?), Hill
changed its emphasis to a functional or operational idea. Cause is what
cause does, Hill claimed. Often, like the weight of proof in a detective
case, the preponderance of small bits of evidence, rather than a single
definitive experiment, clinched cause.</p>
<p>Amid this charged and historic reorganization of epidemiology, in the
winter of 1956, Evarts Graham suddenly fell ill with what he thought was
the flu. He was at the pinnacle of his career, a surgeon in full. His
legacy was legion: he had revolutionized lung cancer surgery by
stitching together surgical procedures learned from nineteenth-century
TB wards. He had investigated mechanisms by which cancer cells arose,
using tobacco as his chosen carcinogen. And with Wynder, he had firmly
established the epidemiological link between cigarettes and lung
cancer.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it was his prior aversion to the theory that he
himself had proved that undid Evarts Graham. In January 1957, when the
“flu” refused to remit, Graham underwent a battery of tests at Barnes
Hospital. An X-ray revealed the cause of his troubles: a large, coarse
rind of a tumor clogging the upper bronchioles and both lungs riddled
with hundreds of metastatic deposits of cancer. Keeping the identity of
the patient hidden, Graham showed his films to a surgical colleague. The
surgeon looked at the X-rays and deemed the tumor inoperable and
hopeless. Graham then informed him quietly, “[The tumor] is mine.”</p>
<p>On February 14, with his condition deteriorating weekly, Graham wrote
to his friend and collaborator the surgeon Alton Ochsner: “Perhaps you
have heard that I have recently been a patient at Barnes Hospital
because of bilateral bronchogenic carcinoma which sneaked up on me like
a thief in the night. . . . You know I quit smoking more than five years
ago, but the trouble is that I smoked for 50 years.”</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Graham grew dizzy, nauseated, and confused while
shaving. He was brought to Barnes again, to a room a few floors above
the operating rooms so beloved by him. He was given intravenous
chemotherapy with nitrogen mustard, but to little avail. The “thief” had
widely marauded; cancer was growing in his lungs, lymph nodes, adrenal
glands, liver, and brain. On February 26, confused, lethargic, and
incoherent, he drifted into a coma and died in his room. He was
seventy-four years old. By his request, his body was donated to the
department of anatomy as an autopsy specimen for other students.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1954, three years before his untimely death, Evarts
Graham wrote a strikingly prescient essay in a book entitled Smoking and
Cancer. At the end of the essay, Graham wondered about how the spread of
tobacco in human societies might be combated in the future. Medicine, he
concluded, was not powerful enough to restrict tobacco’s spread.
Academic investigators could provide data about risks and argue
incessantly about proof and causality, but the solution had to be
political. “The obstinacy of [policymakers],” he wrote, “compels one to
conclude that it is their own addiction . . . which blinds them. They
have eyes to see, but see not because of their inability or
unwillingness to give up smoking. All of this leads to the question . .
. are the radio and the television to be permitted to continue carrying
the advertising material of the cigarette industry? Isn’t it time that
the official guardian of the people’s health, the United States Public
Health Service, at least make a statement of warning?”</p>
