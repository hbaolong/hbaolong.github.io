<h4 id="farbers-gauntlet">Farber’s Gauntlet</h4>
<p>Throughout the centuries the sufferer from this disease has been the
subject of almost every conceivable form of experimentation. The fields
and forests, the apothecary shop and the temple, have been ransacked for
some successful means of relief from this intractable malady. Hardly any
animal has escaped making its contribution, in hair or hide, tooth or
toenail, thymus or thyroid, liver or spleen, in the vain search by man
for a means of relief.</p>
<p>—William Bainbridge</p>
<p>The search for a way to eradicate this scourge . . . is left to
incidental dabbling and uncoordinated research.</p>
<p>—The Washington Post, 1946</p>
<p>Seven miles southwest of the Longwood hospitals in Boston, the town
of Dorchester is a typical sprawling New England suburb, a triangle
wedged between the sooty industrial settlements to the west and the
gray-green bays of the Atlantic to its east. In the late 1940s, waves of
Jewish and Irish immigrants—shipbuilders, iron casters, railway
engineers, fishermen, and factory workers—settled in Dorchester,
occupying rows of brick-and-clapboard houses that snaked their way up
Blue Hill Avenue. Dorchester reinvented itself as the quintessential
suburban family town, with parks and playgrounds along the river, a golf
course, a church, and a synagogue. On Sunday afternoons, families
converged at Franklin Park to walk through its leafy pathways or to
watch ostriches, polar bears, and tigers at its zoo.</p>
<p>On August 16, 1947, in a house across from the zoo, the child of a
ship worker in the Boston yards fell mysteriously ill with a low-grade
fever that waxed and waned over two weeks without pattern, followed by
increasing lethargy and pallor. Robert Sandler was two years old. His
twin, Elliott, was an active, cherubic toddler in perfect health.</p>
<p>Ten days after his first fever, Robert’s condition worsened
significantly. His temperature climbed higher. His complexion turned
from rosy to a spectral milky white. He was brought to Children’s
Hospital in Boston. His spleen, a fist-size organ that stores and makes
blood (usually barely palpable underneath the rib cage), was visibly
enlarged, heaving down like an overfilled bag. A drop of blood under
Farber’s microscope revealed the identity of his illness; thousands of
immature lymphoid leukemic blasts were dividing in a frenzy, their
chromosomes condensing and uncondensing, like tiny clenched and
unclenched fists.</p>
<p>Sandler arrived at Children’s Hospital just a few weeks after Farber
had received his first package from Lederle. On September 6, 1947,
Farber began to inject Sandler with pteroylaspartic acid or PAA, the
first of Lederle’s antifolates. (Consent to run a clinical trial for a
drug—even a toxic drug—was not typically required. Parents were
occasionally cursorily informed about the trial; children were almost
never informed or consulted. The Nuremberg code for human
experimentation, requiring explicit voluntary consent from patients, was
drafted on August 9, 1947, less than a month before the PAA trial. It is
doubtful that Farber in Boston had even heard of any such required
consent code.)</p>
<p>PAA had little effect. Over the next month Sandler turned
increasingly lethargic. He developed a limp, the result of leukemia
pressing down on his spinal cord. Joint aches appeared, and violent,
migrating pains. Then the leukemia burst through one of the bones in his
thigh, causing a fracture and unleashing a blindingly intense,
indescribable pain. By December, the case seemed hopeless. The tip of
Sandler’s spleen, more dense than ever with leukemia cells, dropped down
to his pelvis. He was withdrawn, listless, swollen, and pale, on the
verge of death.</p>
<p>On December 28, however, Farber received a new version of antifolate
from Subbarao and Kiltie, aminopterin, a chemical with a small change
from the structure of PAA. Farber snatched the drug as soon as it
arrived and began to inject the boy with it, hoping, at best, for a
minor reprieve in his cancer.</p>
<p>The response was marked. The white cell count, which had been
climbing astronomically—ten thousand in September, twenty thousand in
November, and nearly seventy thousand in December—suddenly stopped
rising and hovered at a plateau. Then, even more remarkably, the count
actually started to drop, the leukemic blasts gradually flickering out
in the blood and then all but disappearing. By New Year’s Eve, the count
had dropped to nearly one-sixth of its peak value, bottoming out at a
nearly normal level. The cancer hadn’t vanished—under the microscope,
there were still malignant white cells—but it had temporarily abated,
frozen into a hematologic stalemate in the frozen Boston winter.</p>
<p>On January 13, 1948, Sandler returned to the clinic, walking on his
own for the first time in two months. His spleen and liver had shrunk so
dramatically that his clothes, Farber noted, had become “loose around
the abdomen.” His bleeding had stopped. His appetite turned ravenous, as
if he were trying to catch up on six months of lost meals. By February,
Farber noted, the child’s alertness, nutrition, and activity were equal
to his twin’s. For a brief month or so, Robert Sandler and Elliott
Sandler seemed identical again.</p>
<p>Sandler’s remission—unprecedented in the history of leukemia—set off
a flurry of activity for Farber. By the early winter of 1948, more
children were at his clinic: a three-year-old boy brought with a sore
throat, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl with lumps in her head and neck,
all eventually diagnosed with childhood ALL. Deluged with antifolates
from Yella and with patients who desperately needed them, Farber
recruited additional doctors to help him: a hematologist named Louis
Diamond, and a group of assistants, James Wolff, Robert Mercer, and
Robert Sylvester.</p>
<p>Farber had infuriated the authorities at Children’s Hospital with his
first clinical trial. With this, the second, he pushed them over the
edge. The hospital staff voted to take all the pediatric interns off the
leukemia chemotherapy unit (the atmosphere in the leukemia wards, it was
felt, was far too desperate and experimental and thus not conducive to
medical education)—in essence, leaving Farber and his assistants to
perform all the patient care themselves. Children with cancer, as one
surgeon noted, were typically “tucked in the farthest recesses of the
hospital wards.” They were on their deathbeds anyway, the pediatricians
argued; wouldn’t it be kinder and gentler, some insisted, to just “let
them die in peace”? When one clinician suggested that Farber’s novel
“chemicals” be reserved only as a last resort for leukemic children,
Farber, recalling his prior life as a pathologist, shot back, “By that
time, the only chemical that you will need will be embalming fluid.”</p>
<p>Farber outfitted a back room of a ward near the bathrooms into a
makeshift clinic. His small staff was housed in various unused spaces in
the Department of Pathology—in back rooms, stairwell shafts, and empty
offices. Institutional support was minimal. Farber’s assistants
sharpened their own bone marrow needles, a practice as antiquated as a
surgeon whetting his knives on a wheel. Farber’s staff tracked the
disease in patients with meticulous attention to detail: every blood
count, every transfusion, every fever, was to be recorded. If leukemia
was going to be beaten, Farber wanted every minute of that battle
recorded for posterity—even if no one else was willing to watch it
happen.</p>
<p>That winter of 1948, a severe and dismal chill descended on Boston.
Snowstorms broke out, bringing Farber’s clinic to a standstill. The
narrow asphalt road out to Longwood Avenue was piled with heaps of muddy
sleet, and the basement tunnels, poorly heated even in the fall, were
now freezing. Daily injections of antifolates became impossible, and
Farber’s team backed down to three times a week. In February, when the
storms abated, the daily injections started again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, news of Farber’s experience with childhood leukemia was
beginning to spread, and a slow train of children began to arrive at his
clinic. And case by case, an incredible pattern emerged: the antifolates
could drive leukemia cell counts down, occasionally even resulting in
their complete disappearance—at least for a while. There were other
remissions as dramatic as Sandler’s. Two boys treated with aminopterin
returned to school. Another child, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl,
started to “play and run about” after seven months of lying in bed. The
normalcy of blood almost restored a flickering, momentary normalcy to
the childhood.</p>
<p>But there was always the same catch. After a few months of remission,
the cancer would inevitably relapse, ultimately flinging aside even the
most potent of Yella’s drugs. The cells would return in the bone marrow,
then burst out into the blood, and even the most active antifolates
would not keep their growth down. Robert Sandler died in 1948, having
responded for a few months.</p>
<p>Yet the remissions, even if temporary, were still genuine
remissions—and historic. By April 1948, there was just enough data to
put together a preliminary paper for the New England Journal of
Medicine. The team had treated sixteen patients. Of the sixteen, ten had
responded. And five children—about one-third of the initial
group—remained alive four or even six months after their diagnosis. In
leukemia, six months of survival was an eternity.</p>
<p>Farber’s paper, published on June 3, 1948, was seven pages long,
jam-packed with tables, figures, microscope photographs, laboratory
values, and blood counts. Its language was starched, formal, detached,
and scientific. Yet, like all great medical papers, it was a
page-turner. And like all good novels, it was timeless: to read it today
is to be pitched behind the scenes into the tumultuous life of the
Boston clinic, its patients hanging on for life as Farber and his
assistants scrambled to find new drugs for a dreadful disease that kept
flickering away and returning. It was a plot with a beginning, a middle,
and, unfortunately, an end.</p>
<p>The paper was received, as one scientist recalls, “with skepticism,
disbelief, and outrage.” But for Farber, the study carried a tantalizing
message: cancer, even in its most aggressive form, had been treated with
a medicine, a chemical. In six months between 1947 and 1948, Farber thus
saw a door open—briefly, seductively—then close tightly shut again. And
through that doorway, he glimpsed an incandescent possibility. The
disappearance of an aggressive systemic cancer via a chemical drug was
virtually unprecedented in the history of cancer. In the summer of 1948,
when one of Farber’s assistants performed a bone marrow biopsy on a
leukemic child after treatment with aminopterin, the assistant could not
believe the results. “The bone marrow looked so normal,” he wrote, “that
one could dream of a cure.”</p>
<p>And so Farber did dream. He dreamed of malignant cells being killed
by specific anticancer drugs, and of normal cells regenerating and
reclaiming their physiological spaces; of a whole gamut of such systemic
antagonists to decimate malignant cells; of curing leukemia with
chemicals, then applying his experience with chemicals and leukemia to
more common cancers. He was throwing down a gauntlet for cancer
medicine. It was then up to an entire generation of doctors and
scientists to pick it up.</p>
