<h4 id="coffins-of-black">“Coffins of black”</h4>
<p>When my mother died I was very young,</p>
<p>And my father sold me while yet my tongue,</p>
<p>Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep,</p>
<p>So your chimneys I sweep andandandand in soot I sleep . . .</p>
<p>And so he was quiet, andandandand that very night.</p>
<p>As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight</p>
<p>That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned, andandandand Jack</p>
<p>Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black</p>
<p>—William Blake</p>
<p>In 1775, more than a century before Ehrlich fantasized about
chemotherapy or Virchow espoused his theory of cancer cells, a surgeon
at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital named Percivall Pott noticed a marked rise
in cases of scrotal cancer in his clinic. Pott was a methodical,
compulsive, reclusive man, and his first impulse, predictably, had been
to try to devise an elegant operation to excise the tumors. But as cases
streamed into his London clinic, he noticed a larger trend. His patients
were almost invariably chimney sweeps or “climbing-boys”—poor,
indentured orphans apprenticed to sweeps and sent up into chimneys to
clean the flues of ash, often nearly naked and swathed in oil. The
correlation startled Pott. It is a disease, he wrote, “peculiar to a
certain set of people . . .; I mean the chimney-sweepers’ cancer. It is
a disease which always makes its first attack on . . . the inferior part
of the scrotum; where it produces a superficial, painful, ragged,
ill-looking sore, with hard and rising edges. . . . I never saw it under
the age of puberty, which is, I suppose, one reason why it is generally
taken, both by patient and surgeon, for venereal; and being treated with
mercurials, is thereby soon and much exasperated.”</p>
<p>Pott might easily have accepted this throwaway explanation. In
Georgian England, sweeps and climbing-boys were regarded as general
cesspools of disease—dirty, consumptive, syphilitic, pox-ridden—and a
“ragged, ill-looking sore,” easily attributed to some sexually
transmitted illness, was usually treated with a toxic mercury-based
chemical and otherwise shrugged off. (“Syphilis,” as the saying ran,
“was one night with Venus, followed by a thousand nights with mercury.”)
But Pott was searching for a deeper, more systematic explanation. If the
illness was venereal, he asked, why, of all things, the predilection for
only one trade? If a sexual “sore,” then why would it get “exasperated”
by standard emollient drugs?</p>
<p>Frustrated, Pott transformed into a reluctant epidemiologist. Rather
than devise new methods to operate on these scrotal tumors, he began to
hunt for the cause of this unusual disease. He noted that sweeps spent
hours in bodily contact with grime and ash. He recorded that minute,
invisible particles of soot could be found lodged under their skin for
days, and that scrotal cancer typically burst out of a superficial skin
wound that tradesmen called a soot wart. Sifting through these
observations, Pott eventually pinned his suspicion on chimney soot
lodged chronically in the skin as the most likely cause of scrotal
cancer.</p>
<p>Pott’s observation extended the work of the Paduan physician
Bernardino Ramazzini. In 1713, Ramazzini had published a monumental
work—De Morbis Artificum Diatriba—that had documented dozens of diseases
that clustered around particular occupations. Ramazzini called these
diseases morbis artificum—man-made diseases. Soot cancer, Pott claimed,
was one such morbis artificum—only in this case, a man-made disease for
which the inciting agent could be identified. Although Pott lacked the
vocabulary to describe it as such, he had discovered a carcinogen.*</p>
<p>The implication of Pott’s work was far-reaching. If soot, and not
some mystical, numinous humor (à la Galen), caused scrotal cancer, then
two facts had to be true. First, external agents, rather than imbalances
of internal fluids, had to lie at the root of carcinogenesis—a theory so
radical for its time that even Pott hesitated to believe it. “All this
makes it (at first) a very different case from a cancer which appears in
an elderly man, whose fluids are become acrimonious from time,” he wrote
(paying sly homage to Galen, while undermining Galenic theory).</p>
<p>Second, if a foreign substance was truly the cause, then cancer was
potentially preventable. There was no need to purge the body of fluids.
Since the illness was man-made, its solution could also be man-made.
Remove the carcinogen—and cancer would stop appearing.</p>
<p>But the simplest means of removing the carcinogen was perhaps the
most difficult to achieve. Eighteenth-century England was a land of
factories, coal, and chimneys—and by extension, of child labor and
chimney sweeps servicing these factories and chimneys. Chimney sweeping,
though still a relatively rare occupation for children—by 1851, Britain
had about eleven hundred sweeps under the age of fifteen—was emblematic
of an economy deeply dependent on children’s labor. Orphans, often as
young as four and five years old, were “apprenticed” to master sweeps
for a small price. (“I wants a ’prentis, and I am ready to take him,”
says Mr. Gamfield, the dark, malevolent chimney sweep in Dickens’s
Oliver Twist. By an odd stroke of luck, Oliver is spared from being sold
to Gamfield, who has already sent two previous apprentices to their
deaths by asphyxiation in chimneys.)</p>
<p>But political winds changed. By the late eighteenth century, the
embarrassing plight of London’s climbing-boys was publicly exposed, and
social reformers in England sought to create laws to regulate the
occupation. In 1788, the Chimney Sweepers Act was passed in Parliament,
preventing master sweeps from employing children under eight (children
over eight were allowed to be apprenticed). In 1834, the age was raised
to fourteen, and in 1840 to sixteen years. By 1875, the use of young
climbing-boys was fully forbidden and the profession vigorously policed
to prevent infractions. Pott did not live to see the changes—he
contracted pneumonia and died in 1788—but the man-made epidemic of
scrotal cancer among sweeps vanished over several decades.</p>
<p>If soot could cause cancer, then were such preventable causes—and
their cancer “artificia”—strewn about in the world?</p>
<p>In 1761, more than a decade before Pott had published his study on
soot cancer, an amateur scientist and apothecary in London, John Hill,
claimed that he had found one such carcinogen concealed in another
innocuous-seeming substance. In a pamphlet entitled Cautions against the
Immoderate Use of Snuff, Hill argued that snuff—oral tobacco—could also
cause lip, mouth, and throat cancer.</p>
<p>Hill’s evidence was no weaker or stronger than Pott’s. He, too, had
drawn a conjectural line between a habit (snuff use), an exposure
(tobacco), and a particular form of cancer. His culprit substance, often
smoked as well as chewed, even resembled soot. But Hill—a self-professed
“Bottanist, apothecary, poet, stage player, or whatever you please to
call him”—was considered the court jester of British medicine, a
self-promoting amateur dabbler, part scholar and part buffoon. While
Pott’s august monograph on soot cancer circulated through the medical
annals of England drawing admiration and praise, Hill’s earlier
pamphlet, written in colorful, colloquial language and published without
the backing of any medical authority, was considered a farce.</p>
<p>In England, meanwhile, tobacco was rapidly escalating into a national
addiction. In pubs, smoking parlors, and coffeehouses—in “close,
clouded, hot, narcotic rooms”—men in periwigs, stockings, and lace ruffs
gathered through the day and night to pull smoke from pipes and cigars
or sniff snuff from decorated boxes. The commercial potential of this
habit was not lost on the Crown or its colonies. Across the Atlantic,
where the tobacco had originally been discovered and the conditions for
cultivating the plant were almost providentially optimal, production
increased exponentially decade by decade. By the mid-1700s, the state of
Virginia was producing thousands of tons of tobacco every year. In
England, the import of tobacco escalated dramatically between 1700 and
1770, nearly tripling from 38 million pounds to more than 100 million
per year.</p>
<p>It was a relatively minor innovation—the addition of a piece of
translucent, combustible paper to a plug of tobacco—that further
escalated tobacco consumption. In 1855, legend runs, a Turkish soldier
in the Crimean War, having run out of his supply of clay pipes, rolled
up tobacco in a sheet of newspaper to smoke it. The story is likely
apocryphal, and the idea of packing tobacco in paper was certainly not
new. (The papirossi, or papelito, had traveled to Turkey through Italy,
Spain, and Brazil.) But the context was pivotal: the war had squeezed
soldiers from three continents into a narrow, blasted peninsula, and
habits and mannerisms were destined to spread quickly through its
trenches like viruses. By 1855, English, Russian, and French soldiers
were all puffing their tobacco rations rolled up in paper. When these
soldiers returned from the war, they brought their habits, like viruses
again, to their respective homelands with them.</p>
<p>The metaphor of infection is particularly apposite, since cigarette
smoking soon spread like a fierce contagion through all those nations
and then leapt across the Atlantic to America. In 1870, the per capita
consumption in America was less than one cigarette per year. A mere
thirty years later, Americans were consuming 3.5 billion cigarettes and
6 billion cigars every year. By 1953, the average annual consumption of
cigarettes had reached thirty-five hundred per person. On average, an
adult American smoked ten cigarettes every day, an average Englishman
twelve, and a Scotsman nearly twenty.</p>
<p>Like a virus, too, the cigarette mutated, adapting itself to diverse
contexts. In the Soviet gulags, it became an informal currency; among
English suffragettes, a symbol of rebellion; among American
suburbanites, of rugged machismo, among disaffected youth, of
generational rift. In the turbulent century between 1850 and 1950, the
world offered conflict, atomization, and disorientation. The cigarette
offered its equal and opposite salve: camaraderie, a sense of belonging,
and the familiarity of habits. If cancer is the quintessential product
of modernity, then so, too, is its principal preventable cause:
tobacco.</p>
<p>It was precisely this rapid, viral ascendancy of tobacco that made
its medical hazards virtually invisible. Our intuitive acuity about
statistical correlations, like the acuity of the human eye, performs
best at the margins. When rare events are superposed against rare
events, the association between them can be striking. Pott, for
instance, had discovered the link between scrotal cancer and chimney
sweeping because chimney sweeping (the profession) and scrotal cancer
(the disease) were both uncommon enough that the juxtaposition of the
two stood out starkly like a lunar eclipse—two unusual occurrences in
precise overlap.</p>
<p>But as cigarette consumption escalated into a national addiction, it
became harder and harder to discern an association with cancer. By the
early twentieth century, four out of five—and, in some parts of the
world, nearly nine of ten—men were smoking cigarettes (women would soon
follow). And when a risk factor for a disease becomes so highly
prevalent in a population, it paradoxically begins to disappear into the
white noise of the background. As the Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto
put it: “By the early 1940s, asking about a connection between tobacco
and cancer was like asking about an association between sitting and
cancer.” If nearly all men smoked, and only some of them developed
cancer, then how might one tease apart the statistical link between one
and the other?</p>
<p>Even surgeons, who encountered lung cancer most frequently, could no
longer perceive any link. In the 1920s, when Evarts Graham, the renowned
surgeon in St. Louis who had pioneered the pneumonectomy (the resection
of the lung to remove tumors), was asked whether tobacco smoking had
caused the increased incidence of lung cancer, he countered
dismissively, “So has the use of nylon stockings.”</p>
<p>Tobacco, like the nylon stockings of cancer epidemiology, thus
vanished from the view of preventive medicine. And with its medical
hazards largely hidden, cigarette usage grew even more briskly, rising
at a dizzying rate throughout the western hemisphere. By the time the
cigarette returned to visibility as arguably the world’s most lethal
carrier of carcinogens, it would be far too late. The lung cancer
epidemic would be in full spate, and the world would be deeply,
inextricably ensconced, as the historian Allan Brandt once characterized
it, in “the cigarette century.”</p>
