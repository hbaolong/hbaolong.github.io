<p>Oedipus: What is the rite of purification? How shall it be done?</p>
<p>Creon: By banishing a man, or expiation of blood by blood.</p>
<p>—Sophocles, Oedipus the King</p>
<p>William Peters was trying to convince himself, using a strict
randomized trial, that megadose chemotherapy worked. But others were
already convinced. Many oncologists had long assumed that the regimen
was so obviously effective that no trial could possibly be needed. After
all, if the deepest reservoirs of the marrow could be depleted by the
searing doses of drugs, how could cancer possibly resist?</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, hospitals and, increasingly, private clinics
offering marrow transplantation for breast cancer had sprouted up all
around America, Great Britain, and France with waiting lists that
stretched into several hundreds of women. Among the most prominent and
successful of the megadose transplanters was Werner Bezwoda, an
oncologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South
Africa, who was recruiting dozens of women into his trial every month.
Transplant was big business: big medicine, big money, big
infrastructure, big risks. At large academic centers, such as the Beth
Israel hospital in Boston, entire floors were refitted into transplant
units, with case volumes that ran into several dozens each week.
Minimizing the risks of the procedure using creative phrasing became a
cottage industry. As private clinics lined up to perform transplants on
women, they christened the procedure a “minitransplant” or “transplant
lite” or even “drive-thru transplant.” Transplanters, as one oncologist
put it, “became gods at hospitals.”</p>
<p>This frantic landscape was tipped into further disarray as patients
began to file requests for insurance providers to pay for the procedure,
priced anywhere between 0,000 to 00,000 per patient. In the summer of
1991, a public-school teacher named Nelene Fox in Temecula, California,
was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. Fox was thirty-eight years
old, the mother of three children. When she relapsed with metastatic
breast cancer after exhausting all conventional therapies, her doctors
suggested an autologous bone marrow transplant as a last resort. Fox
lunged at the suggestion. But when she applied to Health Net, her
insurance provider, to pay for the transplant, Health Net refused,
stating that the procedure was still “investigational” and thus not
covered by the HMO’s standard list of clinically proven protocols.</p>
<p>In another decade and with any other disease, Fox’s case may have
garnered scarcely any public attention. But something fundamental about
the relationship between patients and medicine had changed in the
aftermath of AIDS. Until the late 1980s, an experimental drug or
procedure had been considered precisely that, experimental, and
therefore unavailable for general public use. But AIDS activism had
transformed that idea. An investigational agent, AIDS activists
insisted, was no longer a hothouse flower meant to be cultivated only in
the rarefied greenhouses of academic medicine, but rather a public
resource merely waiting in the warming antechamber of science while
doctors finished clinical trials that would, in the end, prove the
efficacy of said drugs or procedures anyway.</p>
<p>Patients, in short, had lost patience. They did not want trials; they
wanted drugs and cures. ACT UP, parading on the streets of New York and
Washington, had made the FDA out to be a woolly bureaucratic
grandfather—exacting but maddeningly slow, whose sole purpose was to
delay access to critical medicines. Health Net’s denial of Nelene Fox’s
transplant thus generated a visceral public reaction. Furious and
desperate, Fox decided to raise the money privately by writing thousands
of letters. By mid-April 1992, an enormous fund-raising effort to pay
for Fox’s transplant had swung into gear. Temecula, a quiet hamlet of
golf courses and antique shops, was gripped by a mission. Money poured
in from softball matches and pie sales; from lemonade stands and car
washes; from a local Sizzler restaurant; from a yogurt shop that donated
a portion of its profits. On June 19, a retinue of Fox’s supporters,
chanting, “Transplant, transplant,” and Fox’s name, staged a rally
outside Health Net’s corporate headquarters. A few days later, Fox’s
brother, an attorney named Mark Hiepler, filed a lawsuit against Health
Net to force the HMO to pay for his sister’s transplant. “You marketed
this coverage to her when she was well,” Hiepler wrote. “Please provide
it now that she is ill.”</p>
<p>In the late summer of 1992, when Health Net refused yet another
request for coverage, once again citing lack of clinical evidence, Fox
chose to go ahead on her own. By then, she had raised 20,000 from nearly
twenty-five hundred friends, neighbors, relatives, coworkers, and
strangers—enough to afford the transplant on her own.</p>
<p>In August 1992, Nelene Fox thus underwent high-dose chemotherapy and
a bone marrow transplant for metastatic breast cancer, hoping for a new
lease on her life.</p>
<p>In the gleaming new wards of the Norris Center in Los Angeles, where
Fox was undergoing her transplant, the story of Werner Bezwoda’s
remarkable success with megadose chemotherapy was already big news. In
Bezwoda’s hands, everything about the regimen seemed to work like a
perfectly cast spell. A stocky, intense, solitary man capable, Oz-like,
of inspiring both charm and suspicion, Bezwoda was the self-styled
wizard of autologous transplantation who presided over an ever-growing
clinical empire at Witwatersrand in Johannesburg with patients flying in
from Europe, Asia, and Africa. As Bezwoda’s case series swelled, so,
too, did his reputation. By the mid-1990s, he was regularly jetting up
from South Africa to discuss his experience with megadose chemotherapy
at meetings and conferences organized all around the world. “The
dose-limiting barrier,” Bezwoda announced audaciously in 1992, had been
“overcome”—instantly rocketing himself and his clinic into stratospheric
fame.</p>
<p>Oncologists, scientists, and patients who thronged to his packed
seminars found themselves mesmerized by his results. Bezwoda lectured
slowly and dispassionately, in a bone-dry, deadpan drone, looking
occasionally at the screen with his characteristic sideways glance,
delivering the most exhilarating observations in the world of clinical
oncology as if reading the Soviet evening news. At times the ponderous
style seemed almost deliberately mismatched, for even Bezwoda knew that
his results were astounding. As the lights flickered on for the poster
session at the annual oncology meeting held in San Diego in May 1992,
clinicians flocked around him, flooding him with questions and
congratulations. In Johannesburg, more than 90 percent of women treated
with the megadose regimen had achieved a complete response—a rate that
even the powerhouse academic centers in the United States had been
unable to achieve. Bezwoda, it seemed, was going to lead oncology out of
its decades-long impasse with cancer.</p>
<p>Nelene Fox, though, was not so fortunate. She soldiered through the
punishing regimen of high-dose chemotherapy and its multiple
complications. But less than one year after her transplant, breast
cancer relapsed explosively all over her body, in her lungs, liver,
lymph nodes, and, most important, in her brain. On April 22, eleven
months after Bezwoda’s poster was hung up in nearby San Diego, Fox
passed away in her home in a shaded cul-de-sac in Temecula. She was only
forty years old. She left behind a husband and three daughters, aged
four, nine, and eleven. And a lawsuit against Health Net, now winding
its way through the California court system.</p>
<p>Juxtaposed against Bezwoda’s phenomenal results, Fox’s agonizing
struggle and untimely death seemed an even more egregious outcome.
Convinced that the delayed transplant—not cancer—had hastened his
sister’s demise, Hiepler broadened his claims against Health Net and
vigorously pushed for a court trial. The crux of Hiepler’s case rested
on the definition of the word “investigational.” High-dose chemotherapy
could, he argued, hardly be considered an “investigational” procedure if
nearly every major clinical center in the nation was offering it to
patients, both on and off trial. In 1993 alone, 1,177 papers in medical
journals had been written on the subject. In certain hospitals, entire
wards were dedicated to the procedure. The label “experimental” was
slapped on, Hiepler contended, by HMOs to save money by denying
coverage. “If all you have is a cold or the flu, sure, they will take
good care of you. But when you get breast cancer, what happens? Out
comes ‘investigative.’ Out comes ‘experimental.’”</p>
<p>On the morning of December 28, 1993, Mark Hiepler spent nearly two
hours in the courtroom describing the devastating last year of his
sister’s life. The balconies and benches overflowed with Fox’s friends
and supporters and with patients, many of them weeping with anger and
empathy. The jury took less than two hours to deliberate. That evening,
it returned a verdict awarding Fox’s family 9 million in damages—the
second-highest amount in the history of litigation in California and one
of the highest ever awarded in a medical case in America.</p>
<p>Eighty-nine million dollars was largely symbolic (the case was
eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed smaller amount), but
it was also the kind of symbolism that any HMO could readily understand.
In 1993, patient advocacy groups urged women to battle similar cases
around the country. Understandably, most insurers began to relent. In
Massachusetts, Charlotte Turner, a forty-seven-year-old nurse diagnosed
with metastatic breast cancer, lobbied ferociously for her transplant,
rushing on a wheelchair from one legislator’s office to another with
sheaves of medical articles in her arms. In late 1993, as a result of
Turner’s efforts, the Massachusetts state legislature enacted the
so-called Charlotte’s Law, mandating coverage for transplantation for
eligible patients within the state. By the mid-1990s, seven states
required HMOs to pay for bone marrow transplantation, with similar
legislation pending in seven additional states. Between 1988 and 2002,
eighty-six cases were filed by patients against HMOs that had denied
transplants. In forty-seven instances, the patient won the case.</p>
<p>That this turn of events—aggressive chemotherapy and marrow
transplantation mandated by law—was truly extraordinary was not lost on
many observers. It was, at face value, a liberating moment for many
patients and patient advocates. But medical journals ran rife with
scorching critiques of the protocol. It is a “complicated, costly and
potentially dangerous technology,” one article complained pointedly. The
litany of complications was grim: infections, hemorrhage, blood clots in
the arteries and the liver, heart failure, scarring of lungs, skin,
kidneys, and tendons. Infertility was often permanent. Patients were
confined to the hospital for weeks, and most ominous perhaps, between 5
and 10 percent of women ran the risk of developing a second cancer or
precancerous lesion as a result of the treatment itself—cancers doggedly
recalcitrant to any therapy.</p>
<p>But as autologous transplantation for cancer exploded into a major
enterprise, the scientific evaluation of the protocol fell further and
further behind. Indeed the trials were caught in an old and perverse
quagmire. Everyone—patients, doctors, HMOs, advocacy groups—wanted
trials in principle. But no one wanted to be in trials, in practice. The
more health insurance plans opened their floodgates for bone marrow
transplantation, the more women fled from clinical trials, fearing that
they might be assigned to the nontreatment arm by what amounted to a
coin flip.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 1999, roughly forty thousand women around the world
underwent marrow transplantation for breast cancer, at an estimated cost
of between billion and billion (at the higher estimate, about twice the
yearly budget of the NCI). Meanwhile, patient accrual for the clinical
trials, including Peters’s trial at Duke, nearly trickled to a halt. The
disjunction was poignant. Even as clinics overflowed with women being
treated with high-dose chemotherapy and wards filled their beds with
transplanted patients, the seminal measure to test the efficacy of that
regimen was pushed aside, almost as if it were an afterthought.
“Transplants, transplants, everywhere,” as Robert Mayer put it, “but not
a patient to test.”</p>
<p>When Bezwoda returned to the annual cancer meeting in Atlanta in May
1999, he was clearly triumphant. He rose to the podium confidently,
feigning irritation that his name had been mispronounced during the
introduction, and flashed his opening slides. As Bezwoda presented the
data—his monotone voice washing over the vast sea of faces in front of
him—a spell of silence fell over the audience. The wizard of Wits had
worked magic again. At Witwatersrand hospital, young women with
high-risk breast cancer treated with bone marrow transplants had showed
staggeringly successful results. At eight and a half years, nearly 60
percent of patients in the megadose/transplant arm were still alive,
versus only 20 percent in the control arm. For patients treated with the
Bezwoda regimen, the line of survival had plateaued at about seven years
with no further deaths, suggesting that many of the remaining patients
were not just alive, but likely cured. Applause broke out among
transplanters.</p>
<p>But Bezwoda’s triumph felt odd, for although the Witwatersrand
results were unequivocally spectacular, three other trials presented
that afternoon, including Peters’s, were either equivocal or negative.
At Duke, embarrassingly enough, the trial had not even been finished
because of low accrual. And while it was too soon to assess the survival
benefits of transplantation, its darker face was readily evident: of the
three-hundred-odd patients randomized to the transplant arm, thirty-one
women had died of complications—of infections, blood clots, failed
organs, and leukemias. The news from Philadelphia was even more grim.
The megadose chemotherapy regimen had not produced a hint of benefit,
not “even a modest improvement,” as the investigators glumly informed
the audience. A complex and tangled trial from Sweden, with patients
divided into groups and subgroups, was also headed inexorably toward
failure with no obvious survival benefit in sight.</p>
<p>How, then, to reconcile these vastly disparate results? The president
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) had asked a panel of
discussants to try to hammer all the contradictory data into a single
cohesive shape, but even the experts threw up their hands. “My goal
here,” one discussant began, frankly befuddled, “is to critique the data
just presented, to maintain some credibility in the field, and to
continue to remain friends with both the presenters and the
discussants.”</p>
<p>But even that would be a tall order. On and off the stage, the
presenters and discussants bickered about small points, hurling
critiques at each other’s trials. Nothing was resolved and certainly no
friendships were made. “People who like to transplant will continue to
transplant, and people who don’t will continue not to,” Larry Norton,
the powerful breast oncologist and president of the National Alliance of
Breast Cancer Organizations (NABCO), told a journalist from the New York
Times. The conference had been a disaster. As the exhausted audience
trickled out of the massive auditorium in Atlanta, it was already dark
outside and the warm, muggy blast of air provided no relief.</p>
<p>Bezwoda left the Atlanta meeting in a hurry, leaving behind a field
awash with confusion and tumult. He had underestimated the impact of his
data, for it was now the sole fulcrum on which an entire theory of
cancer therapy, not to mention a billion industry, rested. Oncologists
had come to Atlanta for clarity. They left exasperated and confused.</p>
<p>In December 1999, with the benefits of the regimen still uncertain
and thousands of women clamoring for treatment, a team of American
investigators wrote to Bezwoda at Witwatersrand to ask if they could
travel to Johannesburg to examine the data from his trial in person.
Bezwoda’s transplants were the only ones that had succeeded. Perhaps
important lessons could be learned and brought back to America.</p>
<p>Bezwoda readily agreed. On the first day of the visit, when the
investigators requested the records and logbooks of the 154 patients in
his study, Bezwoda sent them only 58 files—all, oddly, from the
treatment arm of the trial. When the team pressed for records from the
control arm, Bezwoda claimed that they had been “lost.”</p>
<p>Mystified, the team probed further, and the picture began to turn
disturbing. The records provided were remarkably shoddy: scratched-out,
one-page notes with random scribbles written almost as an afterthought,
summarizing six or eight months of supposed care. Criteria for
eligibility for the trial were virtually always missing in the records.
Bezwoda had claimed to have transplanted equal numbers of black and
white women, yet nearly all the records belonged to poor, barely
literate black women treated at the Hillbrow Hospital in Johannesburg.
When the reviewers asked for consent forms for a procedure known to have
deadly consequences, no such forms could be found. The hospital’s review
boards, meant to safeguard such protocols, certainly had no copies. No
one, it seemed, had approved the procedure or possessed even the barest
knowledge of the trial. Many of the patients counted as “alive” had long
been discharged to terminal-care facilities with advanced, fungating
lesions of breast cancer, presumably to die, with no designated
follow-up. One woman counted in the treatment arm had never been treated
with any drugs. Another patient record, tracked back to its origin,
belonged to a man—obviously not a patient with breast cancer.</p>
<p>The whole thing was a fraud, an invention, a sham. In late February
2000, with the trial unraveling and the noose of the investigation
tightening around him every day, Werner Bezwoda wrote a terse
typewritten letter to his colleagues at Witwatersrand admitting to
having falsified parts of the study (he would later claim that he had
altered his records to make the trial more “accessible” to American
researchers). “I have committed a serious breach of scientific honesty
and integrity,” he wrote. He then resigned from his university position
and promptly stopped giving interviews, referring all questions to his
attorney. His phone number was unlisted in Johannesburg. In 2008, when I
tried to reach him for an interview, Werner Bezwoda was nowhere to be
found.</p>
<p>The epic fall of Werner Bezwoda was a terminal blow to the ambitions
of megadose chemotherapy. In the summer of 1999, a final trial was
designed to examine whether STAMP might increase survival among women
with breast cancer that had spread to multiple lymph nodes. Four years
later, the answer was clear. There was no discernible benefit. Of the
five hundred patients assigned to the high-dose group, nine died of
transplantation-related complications. An additional nine developed
highly aggressive, chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemias as a
consequence of their treatments—cancers far worse than the cancers that
they had begun with.</p>
<p>“By the late 1990s, the romance was already over,” Robert Mayer said.
“The final trials were merely trials meant to hammer the nails into the
coffin. We had suspected the result for nearly a decade.”</p>
<p>Maggie Keswick Jencks witnessed the end of the transplant era in
1995. Jencks, a landscape artist who lived in Scotland, created
fantastical and desolate gardens—futuristic swirls of sticks, lakes,
stones, and earth shored up against the disordered forces of nature.
Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1988, she was treated with a lumpectomy
and then a mastectomy. For several months, she considered herself cured.
But five years later, just short of her fifty-second birthday, she
relapsed with metastatic breast cancer in her liver, bones, and spine.
At the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, she was treated with
high-dose chemotherapy followed with autologous transplant. Jencks did
not know that the STAMP trial would eventually fail. “Dr. Bill Peters .
. . had already treated several hundred patients with
[transplantation],” she wrote, ever hopeful for a cure. “The average
length of remission for his patients after treatment was eighteen
months. It seemed like a lifetime.” But Jencks’s remission did not last
a lifetime: in 1994, just short of her eighteenth month after
transplantation, she relapsed again. She died in July 1995.</p>
<p>In an essay titled A View from the Front Line, Jencks described her
experience with cancer as like being woken up midflight on a jumbo jet
and then thrown out with a parachute into a foreign landscape without a
map:</p>
<p>“There you are, the future patient, quietly progressing with other
passengers toward a distant destination when, astonishingly (Why me?) a
large hole opens in the floor next to you. People in white coats appear,
help you into a parachute and—no time to think—out you go.</p>
<p>“You descend. You hit the ground. . . . But where is the enemy? What
is the enemy? What is it up to? . . . No road. No compass. No map. No
training. Is there something you should know and don’t?</p>
<p>“The white coats are far, far away, strapping others into their
parachutes. Occasionally they wave but, even if you ask them, they don’t
know the answers. They are up there in the Jumbo, involved with
parachutes, not map-making.”</p>
<p>The image captured the desolation and desperation of the era.
Obsessed with radical and aggressive therapies, oncologists were
devising newer and newer parachutes, but with no systematic maps of the
quagmire to guide patients and doctors. The War on Cancer was “lost”—in
both senses of the word.</p>
<p>Summer is a season of sequels, but no one, frankly, was looking
forward to John Bailar’s. Sequestered away at the University of Chicago,
Bailar had been smoldering quietly in his office since his first
article—“Progress Against Cancer?”—had sent a deep gash through the
NCI’s brow in May 1986. But eleven years had passed since the
publication of that article, and Bailar, the nation’s reminder-in-chief
on cancer, was expected to explode with an update any day. In May 1997,
exactly eleven years after the publication of his first article, Bailar
was back in the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine with
another appraisal of the progress on cancer.</p>
<p>The punch line of Bailar’s article (coauthored with an epidemiologist
named Heather Gornik) was evident in its title: “Cancer Undefeated.” “In
1986,” he began pointedly, “when one of us reported on trends in the
incidence of cancer in the United States from 1950 through 1982, it was
clear that some 40 years of cancer research, centered primarily on
treatment, had failed to reverse a long, slow increase in mortality.
Here we update that analysis through 1994. Our evaluation begins with
1970, both to provide some overlap with the previous article and because
passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971 marked a critical increase in
the magnitude and vigor of the nation’s efforts in cancer research.”</p>
<p>Little had changed in methodology from Bailar’s earlier analysis. As
before, Bailar and Gornik began by “age-adjusting” the U.S. population,
such that every year between 1970 and 1994 contained exactly the same
distribution of ages (the method is described in more detail in earlier
pages). Cancer mortality for each age bracket was also adjusted
proportionally, in effect, creating a frozen, static population so that
cancer mortality could be compared directly from one year to the
next.</p>
<p>The pattern that emerged from this analysis was sobering. Between
1970 and 1994, cancer mortality had, if anything, increased slightly,
about 6 percent, from 189 deaths per 100,000 to 201 deaths. Admittedly,
the death rate had plateaued somewhat in the last ten years, but even
so, this could hardly be construed as a victory. Cancer, Bailar
concluded, was still reigning “undefeated.” Charted as a graph, the
nation’s progress on cancer was a flat line; the War on Cancer had, thus
far, yielded a stalemate.</p>
<p>But was the flat line of cancer mortality truly inanimate? Physics
teaches us to discriminate a static equilibrium from a dynamic
equilibrium; the product of two equal and opposite reactions can seem to
sit perfectly still until the opposing forces are uncoupled. What if the
flat line of cancer mortality represented a dynamic equilibrium of
counterbalanced forces pushing and pulling against each other?</p>
<p>As Bailar and Gornik probed their own data further, they began to
discern such forces counterpoised against each other with almost
exquisite precision. When cancer mortality between 1970 and 1994 was
split into two age groups, the counterbalancing of forces was
immediately obvious: in men and women above fifty-five, cancer mortality
had increased, while in men and women under fifty-five, cancer mortality
had decreased by exactly the same proportion. (Part of the reason for
this will become clear below.)</p>
<p>A similar dynamic equilibrium was apparent when cancer mortality was
reassessed by the type of cancer involved. Mortality had decreased for
some forms, plateaued for others, and increased for yet others,
offsetting nearly every gain with an equal and opposite loss. Death
rates from colon cancer, for instance, had fallen by nearly 30 percent,
and from cervical and uterine cancer by 20. Both diseases could be
detected by screening tests (colonoscopy for colon cancer, and Pap
smears for cervical cancer) and at least part of the decrease in
mortality was the likely consequence of earlier detection.</p>
<p>Death rates for most forms of children’s cancer had also declined
since the 1970s, with declines continuing over the decade. So, too, had
mortality from Hodgkin’s disease and testicular cancer. Although the net
number of such cancers still represented a small fraction of the total
cancer mortality, treatment had fundamentally altered the physiognomy of
these diseases.</p>
<p>The most prominent countervailing ballast against these advances was
lung cancer. Lung cancer was still the single biggest killer among
cancers, responsible for nearly one-fourth of all cancer deaths. Overall
mortality for lung cancer had increased between 1970 and 1994. But the
distribution of deaths was markedly skewed. Death rates among men had
peaked and dropped off by the mid-1980s. In contrast, lung cancer
mortality had dramatically risen in women, particularly in older women,
and it was still rising. Between 1970 and 1994, lung cancer deaths among
women over the age of fifty-five had increased by 400 percent, more than
the rise in the rates of breast and colon cancer combined. This
exponential upswing in mortality had effaced nearly all gains in
survival not just for lung cancer, but for all other types of
cancer.</p>
<p>Alterations in the pattern of lung cancer mortality also partially
explained the overall age skew of cancer mortality. The incidence of
lung cancer was highest in those above fifty-five, and was lower in men
and women below fifty-five, a consequence of changes in smoking behavior
since the 1950s. The decrease in cancer mortality in younger men and
women had been perfectly offset by the increase in cancer mortality in
older men and women.</p>
<p>Taken in balance, “Cancer Undefeated” was an article whose title
belied its message. The national stalemate on cancer was hardly a
stalemate, but rather the product of a frantic game of death in
progress. Bailar had set out to prove that the War on Cancer had reached
terminal stagnancy. Instead, he had chronicled a dynamic, moving battle
in midpitch against a dynamic, moving target.</p>
<p>So even Bailar—especially Bailar, the fiercest and most inventive
critic of the war—could not deny the fierce inventiveness of this war.
Pressed on public television, he begrudgingly conceded the point:</p>
<p>Interviewer: Why do you think they’re going down a little bit, or
plateauing?</p>
<p>Bailar: We think they have gone down perhaps one percent. I would
like to wait a little bit longer to see this downturn confirmed, but if
it isn’t here yet, it’s coming. . . .</p>
<p>Interviewer: Dr. Bailar?</p>
<p>Bailar: I think we might agree that the cup is half-full.</p>
<p>No single strategy for prevention or cure had been a runaway success.
But undeniably this “half-full cup” was the product of an astonishingly
ingenious array of forces that had been deployed against cancer. The
vaunted promises of the 1960s and 1970s and the struggles of the 1980s
had given way to a more grounded realism in the 1990s—but this new
reality had brought its own promises.</p>
<p>Sharply critiquing the defeatism of Bailar and Gornik’s assessment,
Richard Klausner, the director of the NCI, pointed out:</p>
<p>“‘Cancer’ is, in truth, a variety of diseases. Viewing it as a single
disease that will yield to a single approach is no more logical than
viewing neuropsychiatric disease as a single entity that will respond to
one strategy. It is unlikely that we will soon see a ‘magic bullet’ for
the treatment of cancer. But it is just as unlikely that there will be a
magic bullet of prevention or early detection that will knock out the
full spectrum of cancers. . . . We are making progress. Although we also
have a long way to go, it is facile to claim that the pace of favorable
trends in mortality reflects poor policies or mistaken priorities.”</p>
<p>An era of oncology was coming to a close. Already, the field had
turned away from its fiery adolescence, its entrancement with universal
solutions and radical cures, and was grappling with fundamental
questions about cancer. What were the underlying principles that
governed the root behavior of a particular form of cancer? What was
common to all cancers, and what made breast cancer different from lung
or prostate cancer? Might those common pathways, or differences for that
matter, establish new road maps to cure and prevent cancer?</p>
<p>The quest to combat cancer thus turned inward, toward basic biology,
toward fundamental mechanisms. To answer these questions, we must turn
inward, too. We must, at last, return to the cancer cell.</p>
