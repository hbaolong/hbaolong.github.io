<h4 id="a-unitary-cause">“A unitary cause”</h4>
<p>It is the spring of 2005—a pivot point in the medical oncology
fellowship. Our paths are about to divide. Three of us will continue in
the clinic, with a primary focus in clinical research and in the
day-to-day care of patients. Four will explore cancer in the laboratory,
retaining just a minor presence in the clinic, seeing just a handful of
patients every week.</p>
<p>The choice between the two paths is instinctual. Some of us
inherently perceive ourselves as clinicians; others primarily as
scientists. My own inclinations have changed little since the first day
of my internship. Clinical medicine moves me viscerally. But I am a lab
rat, a nocturnal, peripatetic creature drawn to the basic biology of
cancer. I mull over the type of cancer to study in the laboratory, and I
find myself gravitating toward leukemia. I may be choosing the
laboratory, but my subject of research is governed by a patient. Carla’s
disease has left its mark on my life.</p>
<p>Even so, in the fading twilight of my full-time immersion in the
hospital, there are disquieting moments that remind me how deeply
clinical medicine can surprise and engage me. It is late one evening in
the fellows’ room, and the hospital around us has fallen silent save for
the metallic clink of cutlery being brought up for meals. The air
outside is heavy with impending rain. The seven of us, close friends by
now, are compiling lists of patients to pass on to the next class of
fellows when Lauren begins to read her list aloud, calling out the names
of those in her care who have died over our two-year fellowship.
Suddenly inspired, she pauses and adds a sentence to each name as a sort
of epitaph.</p>
<p>It is an impromptu memorial service, and it stirs something in the
room. I join in, calling out names of my patients who have died and
appending a sentence or two in memory.</p>
<p>Kenneth Armor, sixty-two, an internist with stomach cancer. In his
final days, all he wished for was a vacation with his wife and time to
play with his cats.</p>
<p>Oscar Fisher, thirty-eight, had small-cell lung cancer. Cognitively
impaired since birth, he was his mother’s favorite child. When he died,
she was threading rosaries through his fingers.</p>
<p>That night I sit alone with my list, remembering the names and faces
late into the evening. How does one memorialize a patient? These men and
women have been my friends, my interlocutors, my teachers—a surrogate
family. I stand up at my desk, as if at a funeral, my ears hot with
emotion, my eyes full of tears. I look around the room at the empty
desks and note how swiftly the last two years have reshaped all seven of
us. Eric, cocksure, ambitious, and smart, is humbler and more
introspective. Edwin, preternaturally cheerful and optimistic in his
first month, talks openly about resignation and grief. Rick, an organic
chemist by training, has become so infatuated with clinical medicine
that he doubts that he will return to the laboratory. Lauren, guarded
and mature, enlivens her astute assessments with jokes about oncology.
Our encounter with cancer has rounded us off; it has smoothed and
polished us like river rocks.</p>
<p>A few days later, I meet Carla in the infusion room. She is casually
chatting with the nurses, as if catching up with old friends. From a
distance, she is barely recognizable. The sheet-white complexion I
recall from her first visit to the hospital has warmed up several
degrees of red. The bruises in her arm from repeated infusions have
vanished. Her children are back in their routine, her husband has
returned to work, her mother is home in Florida. Carla’s life is nearly
normal. She tells me that her daughter occasionally wakes up crying from
a nightmare. When I ask her if this reflects some remnant trauma from
Carla’s yearlong ordeal with illness, she shakes her head assertively:
“No. It’s just monsters in the dark.”</p>
<p>It has been a little more than a year since her original diagnosis.
She is still taking pills of 6-mercaptopurine and
methotrexate—Burchenal’s drug and Farber’s drug, a combination intended
to block the growth of any remnant cancer cells. When she recalls the
lowest points of her illness, she shudders in disgust. But something is
normalizing and healing inside her. Her own monsters are vanishing, like
old bruises.</p>
<p>When her blood counts return from the lab, they are stone-cold
normal. Her remission continues. I am astonished and exalted by the
news, but I bring it to her cautiously, as neutrally as I can. Like all
patients, Carla smells overenthusiasm with deep suspicion: a doctor who
raves disproportionately about small victories is the same doctor who
might be preparing his patient for some ultimate defeat. But this time
there is no reason to be suspicious. I tell her that her counts look
perfect, and that no more tests are required today. In leukemia, she
knows, no news is the best kind of news.</p>
<p>Late that evening, having finished my notes, I return to the
laboratory. It is a beehive of activity. Postdocs and graduate students
hover around the microscopes and centrifuges. Medical words and phrases
are occasionally recognizable here, but the dialect of the lab bears
little resemblance to the dialect of medicine. It is like traveling to a
neighboring country—one that has similar mannerisms but speaks a
different language:</p>
<p>“But the PCR on the leukemia cells should pick up the band.”</p>
<p>“What conditions did you use to run this gel?”</p>
<p>“Agarose, four percent.”</p>
<p>“Was the RNA degraded in the centrifugation step?”</p>
<p>I retrieve a plate of cells from the incubator. The plate has 384
tiny wells, each barely large enough to hold two grains of rice. In each
well, I have placed two hundred human leukemia cells, then added a
unique chemical from a large collection of untested chemicals. In
parallel, I have its “twin” plate—containing two hundred normal human
blood-forming stem cells, with the same panel of chemicals added to
every well.</p>
<p>Several times each day, an automated microscopic camera will
photograph each well in the two plates, and a computerized program will
calculate the number of leukemia cells and normal stem cells. The
experiment is seeking a chemical that can kill leukemia cells but spare
normal stem cells—a specifically targeted therapy against leukemia.</p>
<p>I aspirate a few microliters containing the leukemia cells from one
well and look at them under the microscope. The cells look bloated and
grotesque, with a dilated nucleus and a thin rim of cytoplasm, the sign
of a cell whose very soul has been co-opted to divide and to keep
dividing with pathological, monomaniacal purpose. These leukemia cells
have come into my laboratory from the National Cancer Institute, where
they were grown and studied for nearly three decades. That these cells
are still growing with obscene fecundity is a testament to the
terrifying power of this disease.</p>
<p>The cells, technically speaking, are immortal. The woman from whose
body they were once taken has been dead for thirty years.</p>
<p>As early as 1858, Virchow recognized this power of proliferation.
Looking at cancer specimens under the microscope, Virchow understood
that cancer was cellular hyperplasia, the disturbed, pathological growth
of cells. But although Virchow recognized and described the core
abnormality, he could not fathom its cause. He argued that
inflammation—the body’s reaction to a harmful injury, characterized by
redness, swelling, and immune-system activation—caused cells to
proliferate, leading to the outgrowth of malignant cells. He was almost
right: chronic inflammation, smoldering over decades, does cause cancer
(chronic hepatitis virus infection in the liver precipitates liver
cancer), but Virchow missed the essence of the cause. Inflammation makes
cells divide in response to injury, but this cell division is driven as
a reaction to an external agent such as a bacteria or a wound. In
cancer, the cell acquires autonomous proliferation; it is driven to
divide by an internal signal. Virchow attributed cancer to the disturbed
physiological milieu around the cell. He failed to fathom that the true
disturbance lay within the cancer cell itself.</p>
<p>Two hundred miles south of Virchow’s Berlin laboratory, Walther
Flemming, a biologist working in Prague, tried to uncover the cause of
abnormal cell division, although using salamander eggs rather than human
cells as his subject. To understand cell division, Flemming had to
visualize the inner anatomy of the cell. In 1879, Flemming thus stained
dividing salamander cells with aniline, the all-purpose chemical dye
used by Paul Ehrlich. The stain highlighted a blue, threadlike substance
located deep within the cell’s nucleus that condensed and brightened to
a cerulean shade just before cell division. Flemming called his
blue-stained structures chromosomes—“colored bodies.” He realized that
cells from every species had a distinct number of chromosomes (humans
have forty-six; salamanders have fourteen). Chromosomes were duplicated
during cell division and divided equally between the two daughter cells,
thus keeping the chromosome number constant from generation to
generation of cell division. But Flemming could not assign any further
function to these mysterious blue “colored bodies” in the cell.</p>
<p>Had Flemming moved his lens from salamander eggs to Virchow’s human
specimens, he might have made the next crucial conceptual leap in
understanding the root abnormality in cancer cells. It was Virchow’s
former assistant David Paul von Hansemann, following Flemming’s and
Virchow’s trails, who made a logical leap between the two. Examining
cancer cells stained with aniline dyes with a microscope, von Hansemann
noticed that Flemming’s chromosomes were markedly abnormal in cancer.
The cells had split, frayed, disjointed chromosomes, chromosomes broken
and rejoined, chromosomes in triplets and quadruplets.</p>
<p>Von Hansemann’s observation had a profound corollary. Most scientists
continued to hunt for parasites in cancer cells. (Bennett’s theory of
spontaneous suppuration still held a macabre fascination for some
pathologists.) But von Hansemann proposed that the real abnormality lay
in the structure of these bodies internal to cancer cells—in
chromosomes—and therefore in the cancer cell itself.</p>
<p>But was it cause or effect? Had cancer altered the structure of
chromosomes? Or had chromosomal changes precipitated cancer? Von
Hansemann had observed a correlation between chromosomal change and
cancer. What he needed was an experiment to causally connect the
two.</p>
<p>The missing experimental link emerged from the lab of Theodor Boveri,
yet another former assistant of Virchow’s. Like Flemming, who worked
with salamander cells, Boveri chose to study simple cells in simple
organisms, eggs from sea urchins, which he collected on the windswept
beaches near Naples. Urchin eggs, like most eggs in the animal kingdom,
are strictly monogamous; once a single sperm has entered the egg, the
egg puts up an instant barrier to prevent others from entering. After
fertilization, the egg divides, giving rise to two, then four cells—each
time duplicating the chromosomes and splitting them equally between the
two daughter cells. To understand this natural chromosomal separation,
Boveri devised a highly unnatural experiment. Rather than allowing the
urchin egg to be fertilized by just one sperm, he stripped the outer
membrane of the egg with chemicals and forcibly fertilized the egg with
two sperms.</p>
<p>The multiple fertilization, Boveri found, precipitated chromosomal
chaos. Two sperms fertilizing an egg results in three of each
chromosome—a number impossible to divide evenly. The urchin egg, unable
to divide the number of chromosomes appropriately among its daughter
cells, was thrown into frantic internal disarray. The rare cell that got
the right combination of all thirty-six sea urchin chromosomes developed
normally. Cells that got the wrong combinations of chromosomes failed to
develop or aborted development and involuted and died. Chromosomes,
Boveri concluded, must carry information vital for the proper
development and growth of cells.</p>
<p>This conclusion allowed Boveri to make a bold, if far-fetched,
conjecture about the core abnormality in cancer cells. Since cancer
cells possessed striking aberrations in chromosomes, Boveri argued that
these chromosomal abnormalities might be the cause of the pathological
growth characteristic of cancer.</p>
<p>Boveri found himself circling back to Galen—to the age-old notion
that all cancers were connected by a common abnormality—the “unitary
cause of carcinoma,” as Boveri called it. Cancer was not “an unnatural
group of different maladies,” Boveri wrote. Instead, a common feature
lurked behind all cancers, a uniform abnormality that emanated from
abnormal chromosomes—and was therefore internal to the cancer cell.
Boveri could not put his finger on the nature of this deeper internal
abnormality. But the “unitary cause” of carcinoma lay in this
disarray—not a chaos of black bile, but a chaos of blue chromosomes.</p>
<p>Boveri published his chromosomal theory of cancer in an elegant
scientific pamphlet entitled “Concerning the Origin of Malignant Tumors”
in 1914. It was a marvel of fact, fantasy, and inspired guesswork that
stitched sea urchins and malignancy into the same fabric. But Boveri’s
theory ran into an unanticipated problem, a hard contradictory fact that
it could not explain away. In 1910, four years before Boveri had
published his theory, Peyton Rous, working at the Rockefeller Institute,
had demonstrated that cancer in chickens could be caused by a virus,
soon to be named the Rous sarcoma virus, or RSV.</p>
<p>The central problem was this: as causal agents, Rous’s virus and
Boveri’s chromosomes were incompatible. A virus is a pathogen, an
external agent, an invader exogenous to the cell. A chromosome is an
internal entity, an endogenous structure buried deep inside the cell.
The two opposites could not both claim to be the “unitary cause” of the
same disease. How could an internal structure, a chromosome, and an
external infectious agent, a virus, both create cancer?</p>
<p>In the absence of concrete proof for either theory, a viral cause for
cancer seemed far more attractive and believable. Viruses, initially
isolated in 1898 as minuscule infectious microbes that caused plant
diseases, were becoming increasingly recognized as causes for a variety
of animal and human diseases. In 1909, a year before Rous isolated his
cancer-causing virus, Karl Landsteiner implicated a virus as the cause
for polio. By the early 1920s, viruses that caused cowpox and human
herpes infections had been isolated and grown in laboratories, further
cementing the connection between viruses and human and animal
diseases.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the belief in cause was admixed with the hope for a cure.
If the causal agent was exogenous and infectious, then a cure for cancer
seemed more likely. Vaccination with cowpox, as Jenner had shown,
prevented the much more lethal smallpox infection, and Rous’s discovery
of a cancer-causing virus (albeit in chickens) had immediately provoked
the idea of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In contrast, Boveri’s theory
that cancer was caused by a mysterious problem lurking in the threadlike
chromosomes, stood on thin experimental evidence and offered no prospect
for a cure.</p>
<p>While the mechanistic understanding of the cancer cell remained
suspended in limbo between viruses and chromosomes, a revolution in the
understanding of normal cells was sweeping through biology in the early
twentieth century. The seeds of this revolution were planted by a
retiring, nearsighted monk in the isolated hamlet of Brno, Austria, who
bred pea plants as a hobby. In the early 1860s, working alone, Gregor
Mendel had identified a few characteristics in his purebred plants that
were inherited from one generation to the next—the color of the pea
flower, the texture of the pea seed, the height of the pea plant. When
Mendel intercrossed short and tall, or blue-flowering and
green-flowering, plants using a pair of minute forceps, he stumbled on a
startling phenomenon. Short plants bred with tall plants did not produce
plants of intermediate height; they produced tall plants. Wrinkle-seeded
peas crossed with smooth-seeded peas produced only wrinkled peas.</p>
<p>The implication of Mendel’s experiment was far-reaching: inherited
traits, Mendel proposed, are transmitted in discrete, indivisible
packets. Biological organisms transmit “instructions” from one cell to
its progeny by transferring these packets of information.</p>
<p>Mendel could only visualize these traits or properties in a
descriptive sense—as colors, texture, or height moving from generation
to generation; he could not see or fathom what conveyed this information
from one plant to its progeny. His primitive lamplit microscope, with
which he could barely peer into the interior of cells, had no power to
reveal the mechanism of inheritance. Mendel did not even have the name
for this unit of inheritance; decades later, in 1909, botanists would
christen it a gene. But the name was still just a name; it offered no
further explanation about a gene’s structure or function. Mendel’s
studies left a provocative question hanging over biology for half a
century: in what corporal, physical form was a “gene”—the particle of
inheritance—carried inside the cell?</p>
<p>In 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan, an embryologist at Columbia University
in New York, discovered the answer. Like Mendel, Morgan was a compulsive
breeder, but of fruit flies, which he raised by the thousands on rotting
bananas in the Fly Room on the far edge of the Columbia campus. Again,
like Mendel, Morgan discovered heritable traits moving indivisibly
through his fruit flies generation upon generation—eye colors and wing
patterns that were conveyed from parents to offspring without
blending.</p>
<p>Morgan made another observation. He noted that an occasional rare
trait, such as white eye color, was intrinsically linked to the gender
of the fly: white eyes were found only in male flies. But “maleness”—the
inheritance of sex—Morgan knew, was linked to chromosomes. So genes had
to be carried on chromosomes—the threadlike structures identified by
Flemming three decades earlier. Indeed, a number of Flemming’s initial
observations on the properties of chromosomes began to make sense to
Morgan. Chromosomes were duplicated during cell division, and genes were
duplicated as well and thus transmitted from one cell to the next, and
from one organism to the next. Chromosomal abnormalities precipitated
abnormalities in the growth and development of sea urchins, and so
abnormal genes must have been responsible for this dysfunction. In 1915,
Morgan proposed a crucial advance to Mendel’s theory of inheritance:
genes were borne on chromosomes. It was the transmission of chromosomes
during cell division that allowed genes to move from a cell to its
progeny.</p>
<p>The third vision of the “gene” emerged from the work of Oswald Avery,
a bacteriologist at the Rockefeller University in New York. Mendel had
found that genes could move from one generation to the next; Morgan had
proved that they did so by being carried on chromosomes. In 1926, Avery
found that in certain species of bacteria, genes could also be
transmitted laterally between two organisms—from one bacterium to its
neighbor. Even dead, inert bacteria—no more than a conglomeration of
chemicals—could transmit genetic information to live bacteria. This
implied that an inert chemical was responsible for carrying genes. Avery
separated heat-killed bacteria into their chemical components. And by
testing each chemical component for its capacity to transmit genes,
Avery and his colleagues reported in 1944 that genes were carried by one
chemical, deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. What scientists had formerly
disregarded as a form of cellular stuffing with no real function—a
“stupid molecule,” as the biologist Max Delbruck once called it
dismissively—turned out to be the central conveyor of genetic
information between cells, the least stupid of all molecules in the
chemical world.</p>
<p>By the mid-1940s, three decades after biologists had coined the word,
the molecular nature of the gene had come into focus. Functionally, a
gene was a unit of inheritance that carried a biological trait from one
cell to another or from one generation to the next. Physically, genes
were carried within the cell in the form of chromosomes. Chemically,
genes were composed of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.</p>
<p>But a gene only carries information. The functional, physical, and
chemical understanding of the gene begged a mechanistic understanding:
How did genetic information become manifest inside the cell? What did a
gene “do”—and how?</p>
<p>George Beadle, Thomas Morgan’s student, switched from Morgan’s fruit
flies to an even more primitive organism, the slime mold, to answer
these questions. Collaborating with the biochemist Edward Tatum at
Stanford University in California, Beadle discovered that genes carried
instructions to build proteins—complex, multidimensional macromolecules
that were the workhorses of the cell.</p>
<p>Proteins, researchers found in the 1940s, carry out the bulk of
cellular functions. They form enzymes, catalysts that speed up
biochemical reactions vital to the life of the cell. Proteins are
receptors for other proteins or molecules, responsible for transmitting
signals from one cell to the next. They can create structural components
of the cell, such as the molecular scaffolding that allows a cell to
exist in a particular configuration in space. They can regulate other
proteins, thus creating minuscule circuits inside the cell responsible
for coordinating the life cycle of the cell.</p>
<p>Beadle and Tatum found that a gene “works” by providing the blueprint
to build a protein. A protein is a gene realized—the machine built from
a gene’s instructions. But proteins are not created directly out of
genes. In the late 1950s, Jacques Monod and François Jacob, working in
Paris, Sydney Brenner and Matthew Meselson at Caltech, and Francis Crick
in Cambridge, discovered that the genesis of proteins from genes
requires an intermediary step—a molecule called ribonucleic acid, or
RNA.</p>
<p>RNA is the working copy of the genetic blueprint. It is through RNA
that a gene is translated into a protein. This intermediary RNA copy of
a gene is called a gene’s “message.” Genetic information is transmitted
from a cell to its progeny through a series of discrete and coordinated
steps. First, genes, located in chromosomes, are duplicated when a cell
divides and are transmitted into progeny cells. Next, a gene, in the
form of DNA, is converted into its RNA copy. Finally, this RNA message
is translated into a protein. The protein, the ultimate product of
genetic information, carries out the function encoded by the gene.</p>
<p>An example, borrowed from Mendel and Morgan, helps illustrate the
process of cellular information transfer. Red-eyed flies have glowering,
ruby-colored eyes because they possess a gene that bears the information
to build a red pigment protein. A copy of this gene is created every
time a cell divides and it thus moves from a fly to its egg cells, and
then into the cells of the offspring fly. In the eye cells of the
progeny fly, this gene is “deciphered”—i.e., converted into an
intermediate RNA message. The RNA message, in turn, instructs the eye
cells to build the red pigment protein, thus giving rise to red-eyed
flies of the next generation. Any interruption in this information flow
might disrupt the transmission of the red eye trait—producing flies with
colorless eyes.</p>
<p>This unidirectional flow of genetic information—DNA → RNA →
protein—was found to be universal in living organisms, from bacteria to
slime molds to fruit flies to humans. In the mid-1950s, biologists
termed this the “central dogma” of molecular biology.</p>
<p>An incandescent century of biological discovery—spanning from
Mendel’s discovery of genes in 1860 to Monod’s identification of the RNA
copy of genes in the late 1950s—illuminated the inner workings of a
normal cell. But it did little to illuminate the workings of a cancer
cell or the cause of cancer—except in two tantalizing instances.</p>
<p>The first came from human studies. Nineteenth-century physicians had
noted that some forms of cancer, such as breast and ovarian cancer,
tended to run in families. This in itself could not prove a hereditary
cause: families share not just genes, but also habits, viruses, foods,
exposures to chemicals, and neurotic behaviors—all factors, at some time
or another, implicated as causes of cancer. But occasionally, a family
history was so striking that a hereditary cause (and, by extension, a
genetic cause) could not be ignored. In 1872, Hilário de Gouvêa, a
Brazilian ophthalmologist practicing in Rio, treated a young boy with a
rare cancer of the eye called a retinoblastoma by removing the eye
surgically. The boy had survived, grown up, and married a woman with no
family history of cancer. The couple had several children, and two of
the daughters developed their father’s retinoblastoma in both eyes—and
died. De Gouvêa reported this case as a puzzling enigma. He did not
possess the language of genetics, but to later observers, the case
suggested an inherited factor that “lived” in genes and caused cancer.
But such cases were so rare that it was hard to test this hypothesis
experimentally, and de Gouvêa’s report was largely ignored.</p>
<p>The second time scientists circled around the cause of cancer—almost
hitting the nerve spot of carcinogenesis—came several decades after the
strange Brazilian case. In the 1910s, Thomas Hunt Morgan, the fruit fly
geneticist at Columbia, noticed that mutant flies occasionally appeared
within his flock of flies. In biology, mutants are defined as organisms
that differ from the normal. Morgan noticed that an enormous flock of
flies with normal wings might occasionally give birth to a “monster”
with rough or scalloped wings. These mutations, Morgan discovered, were
the results of alterations in genes and the mutations could be carried
from one generation to the next.</p>
<p>But what caused mutations? In 1928, Hermann Joseph Muller, one of
Morgan’s students, discovered that X-rays could vastly increase the rate
of mutation in fruit flies. At Columbia, Morgan had produced mutant
flies spontaneously. (When DNA is copied during cell division, a copying
error occasionally generates an accidental change in genes, thus causing
mutations.) Muller found that he could accelerate the incidence of these
accidents. Using X-rays to bombard flies, he found that he could produce
hundreds of mutant flies over a few months—more than Morgan and his
colleagues had produced using their vast breeding program over nearly
two decades.</p>
<p>The link between X-rays and mutations nearly led Morgan and Muller to
the brink of a crucial realization about cancer. Radiation was known to
cause cancer. (Recall Marie Curie’s leukemia, and the tongue cancers of
the radium-watch makers.) Since X-rays also caused mutations in fruit
fly genes, could cancer be a disease of mutations? And since mutations
were changes in genes, could genetic alterations be the “unitary cause”
of cancer?</p>
<p>Had Muller and Morgan, student and mentor, pitched their formidable
scientific skills together, they might have answered this question and
uncovered this essential link between mutations and malignancy. But once
close colleagues, they became pitted and embittered rivals. Cantankerous
and rigid with old age, Morgan refused to give Muller full recognition
for his theory of mutagenesis, which he regarded as a largely derivative
observation. Muller, in turn, was sensitive and paranoid; he felt that
Morgan had stolen his ideas and taken an undue share of credit. In 1932,
having moved his lab to Texas, Muller walked into the nearby woods and
swallowed a roll of sleeping pills in an attempted suicide. He survived,
but haunted by anxiety and depression, his scientific productivity
lapsed in his later years.</p>
<p>Morgan, in turn, remained doggedly pessimistic about the relevance of
the fruit fly work in understanding human diseases. In 1933, Morgan
received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his far-reaching
work on fruit fly genetics. (Muller would receive the Nobel Prize
independently in 1946.) But Morgan wrote self-deprecatingly about the
medical relevance of his work, “The most important contribution to
medicine that genetics has made is, in my opinion, intellectual.” At
some point far in the future, he imagined a convergence between medicine
and genetics. “Possibly,” he speculated, “the doctor may then want to
call in his geneticist friends for consultation!”</p>
<p>But to oncologists in the 1940s, such a “consultation” seemed
far-fetched. The hunt for an internal, genetic cause of cancer had
stalled since Boveri. Pathological mitosis was visible in cancerous
tissue. But both geneticists and embryologists failed to answer the key
question: what caused mitosis to turn so abruptly from such an
exquisitely regulated process to chaos?</p>
<p>More deeply, what had failed was a kind of biological imagination.
Boveri’s mind had so acrobatically leapt from sea urchins to carcinomas,
or Morgan’s from pea plants to fruit flies, in part because biology
itself was leaping from organism to organism, finding systematic
cellular blueprints that ran deeply through all the living world. But
extending that same blueprint to human diseases had turned out to be a
much more challenging task. At Columbia, Morgan had assembled a fair
collection of fruit fly monsters, but none that even remotely resembled
a real human affliction. The notion that the cancer doctor might call in
a “genetic friend” to help understand the pathophysiology of cancer
seemed laughable.</p>
<p>Cancer researchers would return to the language of genes and
mutations again in the 1970s. But the journey back to this language—and
to the true “unitary” cause of cancer—would take a bewildering detour
through the terrain of new biology, and a further fifty years.</p>
