<h4 id="a-private-plague">A Private Plague</h4>
<p>We reveal ourselves in the metaphors we choose for depicting the
cosmos in miniature.</p>
<p>—Stephen Jay Gould</p>
<p>Thus, for 3,000 years and more, this disease has been known to the
medical profession. And for 3,000 years and more, humanity has been
knocking at the door of the medical profession for a “cure.”</p>
<p>—Fortune, March 1937</p>
<p>Now it is cancer’s turn to be the disease that doesn’t knock before
it enters.</p>
<p>—Susan Sontag, Illness as Metaphor</p>
<p>We tend to think of cancer as a “modern” illness because its
metaphors are so modern. It is a disease of overproduction, of fulminant
growth—growth unstoppable, growth tipped into the abyss of no control.
Modern biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine.
Cancer is that machine unable to quench its initial command (to grow)
and thus transformed into an indestructible, self-propelled
automaton.</p>
<p>The notion of cancer as an affliction that belongs paradigmatically
to the twentieth century is reminiscent, as Susan Sontag argued so
powerfully in her book Illness as Metaphor, of another disease once
considered emblematic of another era: tuberculosis in the nineteenth
century. Both diseases, as Sontag pointedly noted, were similarly
“obscene—in the original meaning of that word: ill-omened, abominable,
repugnant to the senses.” Both drain vitality; both stretch out the
encounter with death; in both cases, dying, even more than death,
defines the illness.</p>
<p>But despite such parallels, tuberculosis belongs to another century.
TB (or consumption) was Victorian romanticism brought to its
pathological extreme—febrile, unrelenting, breathless, and obsessive. It
was a disease of poets: John Keats involuting silently toward death in a
small room overlooking the Spanish Steps in Rome, or Byron, an obsessive
romantic, who fantasized about dying of the disease to impress his
mistresses. “Death and disease are often beautiful, like . . . the
hectic glow of consumption,” Thoreau wrote in 1852. In Thomas Mann’s The
Magic Mountain, this “hectic glow” releases a feverish creative force in
its victims—a clarifying, edifying, cathartic force that, too, appears
to be charged with the essence of its era.</p>
<p>Cancer, in contrast, is riddled with more contemporary images. The
cancer cell is a desperate individualist, “in every possible sense, a
nonconformist,” as the surgeon-writer Sherwin Nuland wrote. The word
metastasis, used to describe the migration of cancer from one site to
another, is a curious mix of meta and stasis—“beyond stillness” in
Latin—an unmoored, partially unstable state that captures the peculiar
instability of modernity. If consumption once killed its victims by
pathological evisceration (the tuberculosis bacillus gradually hollows
out the lung), then cancer asphyxiates us by filling bodies with too
many cells; it is consumption in its alternate meaning—the pathology of
excess. Cancer is an expansionist disease; it invades through tissues,
sets up colonies in hostile landscapes, seeking “sanctuary” in one organ
and then immigrating to another. It lives desperately, inventively,
fiercely, territorially, cannily, and defensively—at times, as if
teaching us how to survive. To confront cancer is to encounter a
parallel species, one perhaps more adapted to survival than even we
are.</p>
<p>This image—of cancer as our desperate, malevolent, contemporary
doppelgänger—is so haunting because it is at least partly true. A cancer
cell is an astonishing perversion of the normal cell. Cancer is a
phenomenally successful invader and colonizer in part because it
exploits the very features that make us successful as a species or as an
organism.</p>
<p>Like the normal cell, the cancer cell relies on growth in the most
basic, elemental sense: the division of one cell to form two. In normal
tissues, this process is exquisitely regulated, such that growth is
stimulated by specific signals and arrested by other signals. In cancer,
unbridled growth gives rise to generation upon generation of cells.
Biologists use the term clone to describe cells that share a common
genetic ancestor. Cancer, we now know, is a clonal disease. Nearly every
known cancer originates from one ancestral cell that, having acquired
the capacity of limitless cell division and survival, gives rise to
limitless numbers of descendants—Virchow’s omnis cellula e cellula e
cellula repeated ad infinitum.</p>
<p>But cancer is not simply a clonal disease; it is a clonally evolving
disease. If growth occurred without evolution, cancer cells would not be
imbued with their potent capacity to invade, survive, and metastasize.
Every generation of cancer cells creates a small number of cells that is
genetically different from its parents. When a chemotherapeutic drug or
the immune system attacks cancer, mutant clones that can resist the
attack grow out. The fittest cancer cell survives. This mirthless,
relentless cycle of mutation, selection, and overgrowth generates cells
that are more and more adapted to survival and growth. In some cases,
the mutations speed up the acquisition of other mutations. The genetic
instability, like a perfect madness, only provides more impetus to
generate mutant clones. Cancer thus exploits the fundamental logic of
evolution unlike any other illness. If we, as a species, are the
ultimate product of Darwinian selection, then so, too, is this
incredible disease that lurks inside us.</p>
<p>Such metaphorical seductions can carry us away, but they are
unavoidable with a subject like cancer. In writing this book, I started
off by imagining my project as a “history” of cancer. But it felt,
inescapably, as if I were writing not about something but about someone.
My subject daily morphed into something that resembled an individual—an
enigmatic, if somewhat deranged, image in a mirror. This was not so much
a medical history of an illness, but something more personal, more
visceral: its biography.</p>
<p>So to begin again, for every biographer must confront the birth of
his subject: Where was cancer “born”? How old is cancer? Who was the
first to record it as an illness?</p>
<p>In 1862, Edwin Smith—an unusual character: part scholar and part
huckster, an antique forger and self-made Egyptologist—bought (or, some
say, stole) a fifteen-foot-long papyrus from an antiques seller in Luxor
in Egypt. The papyrus was in dreadful condition, with crumbling, yellow
pages filled with cursive Egyptian script. It is now thought to have
been written in the seventeenth century BC, a transcription of a
manuscript dating back to 2500 BC. The copier—a plagiarist in a terrible
hurry—had made errors as he had scribbled, often noting corrections in
red ink in the margins.</p>
<p>Translated in 1930, the papyrus is now thought to contain the
collected teachings of Imhotep, a great Egyptian physician who lived
around 2625 BC. Imhotep, among the few nonroyal Egyptians known to us
from the Old Kingdom, was a Renaissance man at the center of a sweeping
Egyptian renaissance. As a vizier in the court of King Djozer, he
dabbled in neurosurgery, tried his hand at architecture, and made early
forays into astrology and astronomy. Even the Greeks, encountering the
fierce, hot blast of his intellect as they marched through Egypt
centuries later, cast him as an ancient magician and fused him to their
own medical god, Asclepius.</p>
<p>But the surprising feature of the Smith papyrus is not magic and
religion but the absence of magic and religion. In a world immersed in
spells, incantations, and charms, Imhotep wrote about broken bones and
dislocated vertebrae with a detached, sterile scientific vocabulary, as
if he were writing a modern surgical textbook. The forty-eight cases in
the papyrus—fractures of the hand, gaping abscesses of the skin, or
shattered skull bones—are treated as medical conditions rather than
occult phenomena, each with its own anatomical glossary, diagnosis,
summary, and prognosis.</p>
<p>And it is under these clarifying headlamps of an ancient surgeon that
cancer first emerges as a distinct disease. Describing case forty-five,
Imhotep advises, “If you examine [a case] having bulging masses on [the]
breast and you find that they have spread over his breast; if you place
your hand upon [the] breast [and] find them to be cool, there being no
fever at all therein when your hand feels him; they have no
granulations, contain no fluid, give rise to no liquid discharge, yet
they feel protuberant to your touch, you should say concerning him:
‘This is a case of bulging masses I have to contend with. . . . Bulging
tumors of the breast mean the existence of swellings on the breast,
large, spreading, and hard; touching them is like touching a ball of
wrappings, or they may be compared to the unripe hemat fruit, which is
hard and cool to the touch.’”</p>
<p>A “bulging mass in the breast”—cool, hard, dense as a hemat fruit,
and spreading insidiously under the skin—could hardly be a more vivid
description of breast cancer. Every case in the papyrus was followed by
a concise discussion of treatments, even if only palliative: milk poured
through the ears of neurosurgical patients, poultices for wounds, balms
for burns. But with case forty-five, Imhotep fell atypically silent.
Under the section titled “Therapy,” he offered only a single sentence:
“There is none.”</p>
<p>With that admission of impotence, cancer virtually disappeared from
ancient medical history. Other diseases cycled violently through the
globe, leaving behind their cryptic footprints in legends and documents.
A furious febrile plague—typhus, perhaps—blazed through the port city of
Avaris in 1715 BC, decimating its population. Smallpox erupted
volcanically in pockets, leaving its telltale pockmarks on the face of
Ramses V in the twelfth century BC. Tuberculosis rose and ebbed through
the Indus valley like its seasonal floods. But if cancer existed in the
interstices of these massive epidemics, it existed in silence, leaving
no easily identifiable trace in the medical literature—or in any other
literature.</p>
<p>More than two millennia pass after Imhotep’s description until we
once more hear of cancer. And again, it is an illness cloaked in
silence, a private shame. In his sprawling Histories, written around 440
BC, the Greek historian Herodotus records the story of Atossa, the queen
of Persia, who was suddenly struck by an unusual illness. Atossa was the
daughter of Cyrus, and the wife of Darius, successive Achaemenid
emperors of legendary brutality who ruled over a vast stretch of land
from Lydia on the Mediterranean Sea to Babylonia on the Persian Gulf. In
the middle of her reign, Atossa noticed a bleeding lump in her breast
that may have arisen from a particularly malevolent form of breast
cancer labeled inflammatory (in inflammatory breast cancer, malignant
cells invade the lymph glands of the breast, causing a red, swollen
mass).</p>
<p>If Atossa had desired it, an entire retinue of physicians from
Babylonia to Greece would have flocked to her bedside to treat her.
Instead, she descended into a fierce and impenetrable loneliness. She
wrapped herself in sheets, in a self-imposed quarantine. Darius’ doctors
may have tried to treat her, but to no avail. Ultimately, a Greek slave
named Democedes persuaded her to allow him to excise the tumor.</p>
<p>Soon after that operation, Atossa mysteriously vanishes from
Herodotus’ text. For him, she is merely a minor plot twist. We don’t
know whether the tumor recurred, or how or when she died, but the
procedure was at least a temporary success. Atossa lived, and she had
Democedes to thank for it. And that reprieve from pain and illness
whipped her into a frenzy of gratitude and territorial ambition. Darius
had been planning a campaign against Scythia, on the eastern border of
his empire. Goaded by Democedes, who wanted to return to his native
Greece, Atossa pleaded with her husband to turn his campaign westward—to
invade Greece. That turn of the Persian empire from east to west, and
the series of Greco-Persian wars that followed, would mark one of the
definitive moments in the early history of the West. It was Atossa’s
tumor, then, that quietly launched a thousand ships. Cancer, even as a
clandestine illness, left its fingerprints on the ancient world.</p>
<p>But Herodotus and Imhotep are storytellers, and like all stories,
theirs have gaps and inconsistencies. The “cancers” described by them
may have been true neoplasms, or perhaps they were hazily describing
abscesses, ulcers, warts, or moles. The only incontrovertible cases of
cancer in history are those in which the malignant tissue has somehow
been preserved. And to encounter one such cancer face-to-face—to
actually stare the ancient illness in its eye—one needs to journey to a
thousand-year-old gravesite in a remote, sand-swept plain in the
southern tip of Peru.</p>
<p>The plain lies at the northern edge of the Atacama Desert, a parched,
desolate six-hundred-mile strip caught in the leeward shadow of the
giant furl of the Andes that stretches from southern Peru into Chile.
Brushed continuously by a warm, desiccating wind, the terrain hasn’t
seen rain in recorded history. It is hard to imagine that human life
once flourished here, but it did. The plain is strewn with hundreds of
graves—small, shallow pits dug out of the clay, then lined carefully
with rock. Over the centuries, dogs, storms, and grave robbers have dug
out these shallow graves, exhuming history.</p>
<p>The graves contain the mummified remains of members of the Chiribaya
tribe. The Chiribaya made no effort to preserve their dead, but the
climate is almost providentially perfect for mummification. The clay
leaches water and fluids out of the body from below, and the wind dries
the tissues from above. The bodies, often placed seated, are thus
swiftly frozen in time and space.</p>
<p>In 1990, one such large desiccated gravesite containing about 140
bodies caught the attention of Arthur Aufderheide, a professor at the
University of Minnesota in Duluth. Aufderheide is a pathologist by
training but his specialty is paleopathology, a study of ancient
specimens. His autopsies, unlike Farber’s, are not performed on recently
living patients, but on the mummified remains found on archaeological
sites. He stores these human specimens in small, sterile milk containers
in a vaultlike chamber in Minnesota. There are nearly five thousand
pieces of tissue, scores of biopsies, and hundreds of broken skeletons
in his closet.</p>
<p>At the Chiribaya site, Aufderheide rigged up a makeshift dissecting
table and performed 140 autopsies over several weeks. One body revealed
an extraordinary finding. The mummy was of a young woman in her
midthirties, found sitting, with her feet curled up, in a shallow clay
grave. When Aufderheide examined her, his fingers found a hard “bulbous
mass” in her left upper arm. The papery folds of skin, remarkably
preserved, gave way to that mass, which was intact and studded with
spicules of bone. This, without question, was a malignant bone tumor, an
osteosarcoma, a thousand-year-old cancer preserved inside of a mummy.
Aufderheide suspects that the tumor had broken through the skin while
she was still alive. Even small osteosarcomas can be unimaginably
painful. The woman’s pain, he suggests, must have been blindingly
intense.</p>
<p>Aufderheide isn’t the only paleopathologist to have found cancers in
mummified specimens. (Bone tumors, because they form hardened and
calcified tissue, are vastly more likely to survive over centuries and
are best preserved.) “There are other cancers found in mummies where the
malignant tissue has been preserved. The oldest of these is an abdominal
cancer from Dakhleh in Egypt from about four hundred AD,” he said. In
other cases, paleopathologists have not found the actual tumors, but
rather signs left by the tumors in the body. Some skeletons were riddled
with tiny holes created by cancer in the skull or the shoulder bones,
all arising from metastatic skin or breast cancer. In 1914, a team of
archaeologists found a two-thousand-year old Egyptian mummy in the
Alexandrian catacombs with a tumor invading the pelvic bone. Louis
Leakey, the archaeologist who dug up Lucy, one of the earliest known
human skeletons, also discovered a jawbone dating from 4000 BC from a
nearby site that carried the signs of a peculiar form of lymphoma found
endemically in southeastern Africa (although the origin of that tumor
was never confirmed pathologically). If that finding does represent an
ancient mark of malignancy, then cancer, far from being a “modern”
disease, is one of the oldest diseases ever seen in a human
specimen—quite possibly the oldest.</p>
<p>The most striking finding, though, is not that cancer existed in the
distant past, but that it was fleetingly rare. When I asked Aufderheide
about this, he laughed. “The early history of cancer,” he said, “is that
there is very little early history of cancer.” The Mesopotamians knew
their migraines; the Egyptians had a word for seizures. A leprosy-like
illness, tsara’at, is mentioned in the book of Leviticus. The Hindu
Vedas have a medical term for dropsy and a goddess specifically
dedicated to smallpox. Tuberculosis was so omnipresent and familiar to
the ancients that—as with ice and the Eskimos—distinct words exist for
each incarnation of it. But even common cancers, such as breast, lung,
and prostate, are conspicuously absent. With a few notable exceptions,
in the vast stretch of medical history there is no book or god for
cancer.</p>
<p>There are several reasons behind this absence. Cancer is an
age-related disease—sometimes exponentially so. The risk of breast
cancer, for instance, is about 1 in 400 for a thirty-year-old woman and
increases to 1 in 9 for a seventy-year-old. In most ancient societies,
people didn’t live long enough to get cancer. Men and women were long
consumed by tuberculosis, dropsy, cholera, smallpox, leprosy, plague, or
pneumonia. If cancer existed, it remained submerged under the sea of
other illnesses. Indeed, cancer’s emergence in the world is the product
of a double negative: it becomes common only when all other killers
themselves have been killed. Nineteenth-century doctors often linked
cancer to civilization: cancer, they imagined, was caused by the rush
and whirl of modern life, which somehow incited pathological growth in
the body. The link was correct, but the causality was not: civilization
did not cause cancer, but by extending human life spans—civilization
unveiled it.</p>
<p>Longevity, although certainly the most important contributor to the
prevalence of cancer in the early twentieth century, is probably not the
only contributor. Our capacity to detect cancer earlier and earlier, and
to attribute deaths accurately to it, has also dramatically increased in
the last century. The death of a child with leukemia in the 1850s would
have been attributed to an abscess or infection (or, as Bennett would
have it, to a “suppuration of blood”). And surgery, biopsy, and autopsy
techniques have further sharpened our ability to diagnose cancer. The
introduction of mammography to detect breast cancer early in its course
sharply increased its incidence—a seemingly paradoxical result that
makes perfect sense when we realize that the X-rays allow earlier tumors
to be diagnosed.</p>
<p>Finally, changes in the structure of modern life have radically
shifted the spectrum of cancers—increasing the incidence of some,
decreasing the incidence of others. Stomach cancer, for instance, was
highly prevalent in certain populations until the late nineteenth
century, likely the result of several carcinogens found in pickling
reagents and preservatives and exacerbated by endemic and contagious
infection with a bacterium that causes stomach cancer. With the
introduction of modern refrigeration (and possibly changes in public
hygiene that have diminished the rate of endemic infection), the stomach
cancer epidemic seems to have abated. In contrast, lung cancer incidence
in men increased dramatically in the 1950s as a result of an increase in
cigarette smoking during the early twentieth century. In women, a cohort
that began to smoke in the 1950s, lung cancer incidence has yet to reach
its peak.</p>
<p>The consequence of these demographic and epidemiological shifts was,
and is, enormous. In 1900, as Roswell Park noted, tuberculosis was by
far the most common cause of death in America. Behind tuberculosis came
pneumonia (William Osler, the famous physician from Johns Hopkins
University, called it “captain of the men of death”), diarrhea, and
gastroenteritis. Cancer still lagged at a distant seventh. By the early
1940s, cancer had ratcheted its way to second on the list, immediately
behind heart disease. In that same span, life expectancy among Americans
had increased by about twenty-six years. The proportion of persons above
sixty years—the age when most cancers begin to strike—nearly
doubled.</p>
<p>But the rarity of ancient cancers notwithstanding, it is impossible
to forget the tumor growing in the bone of Aufderheide’s mummy of a
thirty-five-year-old. The woman must have wondered about the insolent
gnaw of pain in her bone, and the bulge slowly emerging from her arm. It
is hard to look at the tumor and not come away with the feeling that one
has encountered a powerful monster in its infancy.</p>
