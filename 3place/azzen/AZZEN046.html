<h4 id="drugs-bodies-and-proof">Drugs, Bodies, and Proof</h4>
<p>Dying people don’t have time or energy. We can’t keep doing this one
woman, one drug, one company at a time.</p>
<p>—Gracia Buffleben</p>
<p>It seemed as if we had entered a brave new world of precisely
targeted, less toxic, more effective combined therapies.</p>
<p>—Breast Cancer Action Newsletter, 2004</p>
<p>By the summer of 1993, news of Slamon’s early-phase trial had spread
like wildfire through the community of breast cancer patients, fanning
out through official and unofficial channels. In waiting rooms, infusion
centers, and oncologists’ offices, patients spoke to other patients
describing the occasional but unprecedented responses and remissions.
Newsletters printed by breast cancer support groups whipped up a frenzy
of hype and hope about Herceptin. Inevitably, a tinderbox of
expectations was set to explode.</p>
<p>The issue was “compassionate use.” Her-2 positive breast cancer is
one of the most fatal and rapidly progressive variants of the disease,
and patients were willing to try any therapy that could produce a
clinical benefit. Breast cancer activists pounded on Genentech’s doors
to urge the release of the drug to women with Her-2 positive cancer who
had failed other therapies. These patients, the activists argued, could
not wait for the drug to undergo interminable testing; they wanted a
potentially lifesaving medicine now. “True success happens,” as one
writer put it in 1995, “only when these new drugs actually enter
bodies.”</p>
<p>For Genentech, though, “true success” was defined by vastly different
imperatives. Herceptin had not been approved by the FDA; it was a
molecule in its infancy. Genentech wanted carefully executed early-phase
trials—not just new drugs entering bodies, but carefully monitored drugs
entering carefully monitored bodies in carefully monitored trials. For
the next phase of Herceptin trials launched in 1993, Genentech wanted to
stay small and focused. The number of women enrolled in these trials had
been kept to an absolute minimum: twenty-seven patients at
Sloan-Kettering, sixteen at UCSF, and thirty-nine at UCLA, a tiny cohort
that the company intended to follow deeply and meticulously over time.
“We do not provide . . . compassionate use programs,” Curd curtly told a
journalist. Most doctors involved in the early-phase trials agreed. “If
you start making exceptions and deviating from your protocol,” Debu
Tripathy, one of the leaders of the UCSF trial, said, “then you get a
lot of patients whose results are not going to help you understand
whether a drug works or not. All you’re doing is delaying . . . being
able to get it out into the public.”</p>
<p>Outside the cloistered laboratories of Genentech, the controversy
ignited a firestorm. San Francisco, of course, was no stranger to this
issue of compassionate use versus focused research. In the late 1980s,
as AIDS had erupted in the city, filling up Paul Volberding’s haunted
Ward 5B with scores of patients, gay men had coalesced into groups such
as ACT UP to demand speedier access to drugs, in part through
compassionate use programs. Breast cancer activists saw a grim
reflection of their own struggle in these early battles. As one
newsletter put it, “Why do women dying of breast cancer have such
trouble getting experimental drugs that could extend their lives? For
years, AIDS activists have been negotiating with drug companies and the
FDA to obtain new HIV drugs while the therapies were still in clinical
trials. Surely women with metastatic breast cancer for whom standard
treatments have failed should know about, and have access to,
compassionate use programs for experimental drugs.”</p>
<p>Or, as another writer put it, “Scientific uncertainty is no excuse
for inaction. . . . We cannot wait for ‘proof.’”</p>
<p>Marti Nelson, for one, certainly could not afford to wait for proof.
An outgoing, dark-haired gynecologist in California, Nelson had
discovered a malignant mass in her breast in 1987, when she was just
thirty-three. She had had a mastectomy and multiple cycles of chemo,
then returned to practicing medicine in a San Francisco clinic. The
tumor had disappeared. The scars had healed. Nelson thought that she
might have been cured.</p>
<p>In 1993, six years after her initial surgery, Nelson noticed that the
scar in her breast had begun to harden. She waved it away. But the
hardened line of tissue outlining her breast was relapsed breast cancer,
worming its way insidiously along the scar lines and coalescing into
small, matted masses in her chest. Nelson, who compulsively followed the
clinical literature on breast cancer, had heard of Her-2. Reasoning
presciently that her tumor might be Her-2 positive, she tried to have
her own specimen tested for the gene.</p>
<p>But Nelson soon found herself inhabiting a Kafkaesque nightmare. Her
HMO insisted that because Herceptin was in investigational trials,
testing the tumor for Her-2 was useless. Genentech insisted that without
Her-2 status confirmed, giving her access to Herceptin was
untenable.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1993, with Nelson’s cancer advancing daily and
spewing out metastases into her lungs and bone marrow, the struggle took
an urgent, political turn. Nelson contacted the Breast Cancer Action
project, a local San Francisco organization connected with ACT UP, to
help her get someone to test her tumor and obtain Herceptin for
compassionate use. BCA, working through its activist networks, asked
several laboratories in and around San Francisco to test Nelson’s tumor.
In October 1994, the tumor was finally tested for Her-2 expression at
UCSF. It was strikingly Her-2 positive. She was an ideal candidate for
the drug. But the news came too late. Nine days later, still awaiting
Herceptin approval from Genentech, Marti Nelson drifted into a coma and
died. She was forty-one years old.</p>
<p>For BCA activists, Nelson’s death was a watershed event. Livid and
desperate, a group of women from the BCA stormed through the Genentech
campus on December 5, 1994, to hold a fifteen-car “funeral procession”
for Nelson with placards showing Nelson in her chemo turban before her
death. The women shouted and honked their horns and drove their cars
through the manicured lawns. Gracia Buffleben, a nurse with breast
cancer and one of the most outspoken leaders of the BCA, parked her car
outside one of the main buildings and handcuffed herself to the steering
wheel. A furious researcher stumbled out of one of the lab buildings and
shouted, “<strong>I’m a scientist working on the AIDS cure. Why are you
here? You are making too much noise.</strong>” It was a statement that
epitomized the vast and growing rift between scientists and
patients.</p>
<p>Marti Nelson’s “funeral” woke Genentech up to a new reality. Outrage,
rising to a crescendo, threatened to spiral into a public relations
disaster. Genentech had a narrow choice: unable to silence the
activists, it was forced to join them. Even Curd admitted, if somewhat
begrudgingly, that the BCA was “a tough group [and] their activism is
not misguided.”</p>
<p>In 1995, a small delegation of Genentech scientists and executives
thus flew to Washington to meet Frances Visco, the chair of the National
Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC), a powerful national coalition of cancer
activists, hoping to use the NBCC as a neutral intermediary between the
company and the local breast cancer activists in San Francisco.
Pragmatic, charismatic, and savvy, Visco, a former attorney, had spent
nearly a decade immersed in the turbulent politics of breast cancer.
Visco had a proposal for Genentech, but her terms were inflexible:
Genentech had to provide an expanded access program for Herceptin. This
program would allow oncologists to treat patients outside clinical
trials. In return, the National Breast Cancer Coalition would act as a
go-between for Genentech and its embittered and alienated community of
cancer patients. Visco offered to join the planning committee of the
phase III trials of Herceptin, and to help recruit patients for the
trial using the NBCC’s extensive network. For Genentech, this was a
long-overdue education. Rather than running trials on breast cancer
patients, the company learned to run trials with breast cancer patients.
(Genentech would eventually outsource the compassionate-access program
to a lottery system run by an independent agency. Women applied to the
lottery and “won” the right to be treated, thus removing the company
from any ethically difficult decision-making.)</p>
<p>It was an uneasy triangle of forces—academic researchers, the
pharmaceutical industry, and patient advocates—united by a deadly
disease. Genentech’s next phase of trials involved large-scale,
randomized studies on thousands of women with metastatic Her-2 positive
cancer, comparing Herceptin treatment against placebo treatment. Visco
sent out newsletters from the NBCC to patients using the coalition’s
enormous Listservs. Kay Dickersin, a coalition member and an
epidemiologist, joined the Data Safety and Monitoring board of the
trial, underscoring the new partnership between Genentech and the NBCC,
between academic medicine and activism. And an all-star team of breast
oncologists was assembled to run the trial: Larry Norton from
Sloan-Kettering, Karen Antman from Columbia, Daniel Hayes from Harvard,
and, of course, Slamon from UCLA.</p>
<p>In 1995, empowered by the very forces that it had resisted for so
long, Genentech launched three independent phase III trials to test
Herceptin. The most pivotal of the three was a trial labeled 648,
randomizing women newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to
standard chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy with Herceptin added.
Trial 648 was launched in 150 breast cancer clinics around the world.
The trial would enroll 469 women and cost Genentech 5 million to
run.</p>
<p>In May 1998, eighteen thousand cancer specialists flocked to Los
Angeles to attend the thirty-fourth meeting of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, where Genentech would unveil the data from the
Herceptin trials, including trial 648. On Sunday, May 17, the third day
of the meeting, an expectant audience of thousands piled into the stuffy
central amphitheater at the convention center to attend a special
session dedicated to Her-2/neu in breast cancer. Slamon was slated to be
the last speaker. A coil of nervous energy, with the characteristic
twitch in his mustache, he stood up at the podium.</p>
<p>Clinical presentations at ASCO are typically sanitized and polished,
with blue-and-white PowerPoint slides depicting the bottom-line message
using survival curves and statistical analyses. But Slamon
began—relishing this pivotal moment—not with numbers and statistics, but
with forty-nine smudgy bands on a gel run by one of his undergraduate
students in 1987. Oncologists slowed down their scribbling. Reporters
squinted their eyes to see the bands on the gel.</p>
<p>That gel, he reminded his audience, had identified a gene with no
pedigree—no history, no function, no mechanism. It was nothing more than
an isolated, amplified signal in a fraction of breast cancer cases.
Slamon had gambled the most important years of his scientific life on
those bands. Others had joined the gamble: Ullrich, Shepard, Carter,
Botstein and Levinson, Visco and the activists, pharma executives and
clinicians and Genentech. The trial results to be announced that
afternoon represented the result of that gamble. But Slamon wouldn’t—he
couldn’t—rush to the end point of the journey without reminding everyone
in the room of the fitful, unsanitized history of the drug.</p>
<p>Slamon paused for a theatrical moment before revealing the results of
the trial. In the pivotal 648 study, 469 women had received standard
cytotoxic chemotherapy (either Adriamycin and Cytoxan in combination, or
Taxol) and were randomized to receive either Herceptin or a placebo. In
every conceivable index of response, women treated with the addition of
Herceptin had shown a clear and measurable benefit. Response rates to
standard chemotherapy had moved up 150 percent. Tumors had shrunk in
half the women treated with Herceptin compared to a third of women in
the control arm. The progression of breast cancer had been delayed from
four to seven and a half months. In patients with tumors heavily
resistant to the standard Adriamycin and Cytoxan regimen, the benefit
had been the most marked: the combination of Herceptin and Taxol had
increased response rates to nearly 50 percent—a rate unheard of in
recent clinical experience. The survival rate would also follow this
trend. Women treated with Herceptin lived four or five months longer
than women in the control group.</p>
<p>At face value, some of these gains might have seemed small in
absolute terms—life extended by only four months. But the women enrolled
in these initial trials were patients with late-stage, metastatic
cancers, often heavily pretreated with standard chemotherapies and
refractory to all drugs—women carrying the worst and most aggressive
variants of breast cancer. (This pattern is typical: in cancer medicine,
trials often begin with the most advanced and refractory cases, where
even small benefits of a drug might outweigh risks.) The true measure of
Herceptin’s efficacy would lie in the treatment of treatment-naive
patients—women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who had never
received any prior treatment.</p>
<p>In 2003, two enormous multinational studies were launched to test
Herceptin in early-stage breast cancer in treatment-naive patients. In
one of the studies, Herceptin treatment increased breast cancer survival
at four years by a striking 18 percent over the placebo group. The
second study, although stopped earlier, showed a similar magnitude of
benefit. When the trials were statistically combined, overall survival
in women treated with Herceptin was increased by 33 percent—a magnitude
unprecedented in the history of chemotherapy for Her-2 positive cancer.
“The results,” one oncologist wrote, were “simply stunning . . . not
evolutionary, but revolutionary. The rational development of molecularly
targeted therapies points the direction toward continued improvement in
breast cancer therapy. Other targets and other agents will follow.”</p>
<p>On the evening of May 17, 1998, after Slamon had announced the
results of the 648 study to a stunned audience at the ASCO meeting,
Genentech threw an enormous cocktail party at the Hollywood Terrace, an
open-air restaurant nestled in the hills of Los Angeles. Wine flowed
freely, and the conversation was light and breezy. Just a few days
earlier, the FDA had reviewed the data from the three Herceptin trials,
including Slamon’s study, and was on the verge of “fast-tracking” the
approval of Herceptin. It was a poignant posthumous victory for Marti
Nelson: the drug that would likely have saved her life would become
accessible to all breast cancer patients—no longer reserved for clinical
trials or compassionate use alone.</p>
<p>“The company,” Robert Bazell, the journalist, wrote, “invited all the
investigators, as well as most of Genentech’s Her-2 team. The activists
came too: Marilyn McGregor and Bob Erwin [Marti Nelson’s husband] from
San Francisco and Fran Visco from the National Breast Cancer
Coalition.”</p>
<p>The evening was balmy, clear, and spectacular. “The warm orange glow
of the setting sun over the San Fernando Valley set the tone of the
festivities. Everyone at the party would celebrate an enormous success.
Women’s lives would be saved and a huge fortune would be made.”</p>
<p>Only one person was conspicuously missing from the party—Dennis
Slamon. Having spent the afternoon planning the next phase of Herceptin
trials with breast oncologists at ASCO, Slamon had jumped into his
run-down Nissan and driven home.</p>
