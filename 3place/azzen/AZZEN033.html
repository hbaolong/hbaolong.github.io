<h4 id="curiouser-and-curiouser">“Curiouser and curiouser”</h4>
<p>You’re under a lot of stress, my dear. You haven’t really got
anything wrong with yourself. We’ll give you an antidepressant.</p>
<p>—Barry Marshall on the treatment of women</p>
<p>with gastritis, a precancerous lesion,</p>
<p>in the 1960s</p>
<p>The classification of tobacco smoke as a potent carcinogen—and the
slow avalanche of forces unleashed to regulate cigarettes in the
1980s—is rightfully counted as one of cancer prevention’s seminal
victories. But it equally highlighted an important lacuna in cancer
epidemiology. Statistical methods to identify risk factors for cancer
are, by their very nature, descriptive rather than mechanistic: they
describe correlations, not causes. And they rely on a certain degree of
foreknowledge. To run a classical “case-control” trial to identify an
unknown risk factor, paradoxically, an epidemiologist must know the
questions to ask. Even Doll and Hill, in devising their classic
case-control and prospective studies, had relied on decades of prior
knowledge—centuries, if one counts John Hill’s pamphlet—about the
possible link between tobacco and cancer.</p>
<p>This does not diminish the incredible power of the case-control
method. In the early 1970s, for instance, a series of studies
definitively identified the risk factor for a rare and fatal form of
lung cancer called mesothelioma. When mesothelioma “cases” were compared
to “controls,” this cancer appeared to cluster densely in certain
professions: insulation installers, firefighters, shipyard workers,
heating equipment handlers, and chrysolite miners. As with Pott and
scrotal cancer, the statistical confluence of a rare profession and a
rare tumor swiftly identified the causal agent in this cancer: exposure
to asbestos. Tort litigation and federal oversight soon followed,
precipitating a reduction in the occupational exposure to asbestos that,
in turn, reduced the risk of mesothelioma.</p>
<p>In 1971, yet another such study identified an even more unusual
carcinogen, a synthetic hormonal medicine called diethylstilbestrol
(DES). DES was widely prescribed to pregnant women in the 1950s to
prevent premature deliveries (although it was of only questionable
benefit in this regard). A generation later, when women with vaginal and
uterine cancer were questioned about their exposures to estrogens, a
peculiar pattern emerged: the women had not been exposed to the chemical
directly, but their mothers had been. The carcinogen had skipped a
generation. It had caused cancers not in the DES-treated women, but in
their daughters exposed to the drug in utero.</p>
<p>But what if the behavior or exposure responsible for the cancer is
completely unknown? What if one did not even know enough about the
natural history of mesothelioma, or the link between estrogen and
vaginal cancer, to ask those afflicted about their occupational history,
or their exposure to asbestos and estrogen? Could carcinogens be
discovered a priori—not by the statistical analysis of cancer-afflicted
populations, but by virtue of some intrinsic property of all
carcinogens?</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, a bacteriologist named Bruce Ames at Berkeley,
working on an unrelated problem, stumbled on a test for chemical
carcinogens. Ames was studying mutations in Salmonella, a bacterial
genus. Salmonella, like any bacteria, possesses genes that allow it to
grow under certain conditions—a gene to “digest” galactose, for
instance, is essential for a bacterium to survive on a petri dish where
the only sugar source is galactose.</p>
<p>Ames observed that mutations in these essential genes could enable or
disable the growth of bacteria on a petri dish. A strain of Salmonella
normally unable to grow on galactose, say, could acquire a gene mutation
that enabled this growth. Once growth-enabled, a single bacterium would
form a minuscule colony on a petri dish. By counting the number of
growth-enabled colonies formed, Ames could quantify the mutation rate in
any experiment. Bacteria exposed to a certain substance might produce
six such colonies, while bacteria exposed to another substance might
produce sixty. This second substance, in other words, had a tenfold
capacity to initiate changes in genes—or a tenfold rate of mutation.</p>
<p>Ames could now test thousands of chemicals to create a catalog of
chemicals that increased the mutation rate—mutagens. And as he populated
his catalog, he made a seminal observation: chemicals that scored as
mutagens in his test tended to be carcinogens as well. Dye derivatives,
known to be potent human carcinogens, scored floridly, causing hundreds
of colonies of bacteria. So did X-rays, benzene compounds, and
nitrosoguanidine derivatives—all known to cause cancers in rats and
mice. In the tradition of all good tests, Ames’s test transformed the
unobservable and immeasurable into the observable and measurable. The
invisible X-rays that had killed the Radium girls in the 1920s could now
be “seen” as revertant colonies on a petri dish.</p>
<p>Ames’s test was far from perfect. Not every known carcinogen scored
in the test: neither DES nor asbestos sprinkled on the disabled
Salmonella caused significant numbers of mutant bacteria. (In contrast,
chemical constituents of tobacco smoke did cause mutation in the
bacteria, as noted by several cigarette manufacturers who ran the test
and, finding it disconcertingly positive, quickly buried the results.)
But despite its shortcomings, the Ames test provided an important link
between a purely descriptive approach toward cancer prevention and a
mechanistic approach. Carcinogens, Ames suggested, had a common,
distinctive functional property: they altered genes. Ames could not
fathom the deeper reason behind this observation: why was the capacity
to cause mutations linked to the ability to induce cancer? But he had
demonstrated that carcinogens could be found experimentally—not
retrospectively (by investigating cases and controls in human subjects)
but by prospectively identifying chemicals that could cause mutations in
a rather simple and elegant biological assay.</p>
<p>Chemicals, it turned out, were not the only carcinogens; nor was
Ames’s test the only method to find such agents. In the late 1960s,
Baruch Blumberg, a biologist working in Philadelphia, discovered that a
chronic, smoldering inflammation caused by a human hepatitis virus could
also cause cancer.</p>
<p>A biochemistry student at Oxford in the 1950s, Blumberg had become
interested in genetic anthropology, the study of genetic variations in
human populations. Traditional biological anthropology in the 1950s
mainly involved collecting, measuring, and categorizing human anatomical
specimens. Blumberg wanted to collect, measure, and categorize human
genes—and he wanted to link genetic variations in humans to the
susceptibility for diseases.</p>
<p>The problem, as Blumberg soon discovered, was the lack of human genes
to be measured or categorized. Bacterial genetics was still in its
infancy in the 1950s—even the structure of DNA and the nature of the
genes was still largely undiscovered—and human genes had not even been
seen or analyzed. The only tangible hint of variations in human genetics
came from an incidental observation. Proteins in the blood, called blood
antigens, varied between individuals and were inherited in families,
thus implying a genetic source for this variation. These blood proteins
could be measured and compared across populations using relatively
simple tests.</p>
<p>Blumberg began to scour far-flung places in the world for blood,
drawing tubes of serum from Fulani tribesmen in Africa one month and
Basque shepherds the next. In 1964, after a brief tenure at the NIH, he
moved to the Institute for Cancer Research in Philadelphia (later
renamed the Fox Chase Cancer Center) to systematically organize the
variant blood antigens that he had cataloged, hoping to link them to
human diseases. It was a curiously inverted approach, like scouring a
dictionary for a word and then looking for a crossword puzzle into which
that word might fit.</p>
<p>One blood antigen that intrigued him was present in several
Australian aboriginal subjects and found frequently in Asian and African
populations, but was typically absent in Europeans and Americans.
Suspecting that this antigen was the fingerprint of an ancient genetic
factor inherited in families, Blumberg called it the Australia antigen
or Au for short.</p>
<p>In 1966, Blumberg’s lab set out to characterize the aboriginal
antigen in greater detail. He soon noted an odd correlation: individuals
carrying the Au antigen often suffered from chronic hepatitis, an
inflammation of the liver. These inflamed livers, studied
pathologically, showed signs of chronic cycles of injury and
repair—death of cells in some pockets and compensatory attempts to
repair and regenerate liver cells in others, resulting in scarred,
shrunken, and burnt-out livers, a condition termed chronic
cirrhosis.</p>
<p>A link between an ancient antigen and cirrhosis suggested a genetic
susceptibility for liver disease—a theory that would have sent Blumberg
off on a long and largely fruitless tangent. But a chance incident
overturned that theory and radically changed the course of Blumberg’s
studies. The lab had been following a young patient at a
mental-disability clinic in New Jersey. Initially, the man had tested
negative for the Au antigen. But during one of the serial blood draws in
the summer of 1966, his serum suddenly converted from “Au negative” to
“Au positive.” When his liver function was measured, an acute, fulminant
hepatitis was discovered.</p>
<p>But how could an “intrinsic” gene cause sudden seroconversion and
hepatitis? Genes, after all, do not typically flicker on and off at
will. Blumberg’s beautiful theory about genetic variation had been slain
by an ugly fact. Au, he realized, could not mark an inherent variation
in a human gene. In fact, Au was soon found to be neither a human
protein nor a blood antigen. Au was a piece of a viral protein floating
in the blood, the sign of an infection. The New Jersey man had been
infected by this microbe and thus converted from Au negative to
positive.</p>
<p>Blumberg now raced to isolate the organism responsible for the
infection. By the early 1970s, working with a team of collaborators, his
lab had purified particles of a new virus, which he called hepatitis B
virus, or HBV. The virus was structurally simple—“roughly circular . . .
about forty-two nanometers in diameter, one of the smallest DNA viruses
that infect humans”—but the simple structure belied extraordinarily
complex behavior. In humans, HBV infection caused a broad spectrum of
diseases, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute hepatitis to
chronic cirrhosis in the liver.</p>
<p>The identification of a new human virus set off a storm of activity
for epidemiologists. By 1969, Japanese researchers (and subsequently
Blumberg’s group) had learned that the virus was transmitted from one
individual to another through blood transfusions. By screening blood
before transfusion—using the now familiar Au antigen as one of the early
biomarkers in serum—the blood-borne infection could be blocked, thereby
reducing the risk of hepatitis B.</p>
<p>But another illness soon stood out as linked to HBV: a fatal,
insidious form of liver cancer endemic in parts of Asia and Africa that
arose out of scarred, ashen livers often decades after chronic viral
infection. When cases of hepatocellular cancer were compared to controls
using classical statistical methods, chronic infection with HBV, and the
associated cycle of injury and repair in liver cells, stood out as a
clear risk factor—at about five- to tenfold the risk for uninfected
controls. HBV, then, was a carcinogen—although a live carcinogen,
capable of being transmitted from one host to another.</p>
<p>The discovery of HBV was an embarrassment to the NCI. The institute’s
highly targeted and heavily funded Special Virus Cancer Program, having
inoculated thousands of monkeys with human cancer extracts, had yet to
find a single cancer-associated virus. Yet a genetic anthropologist
exploring aboriginal antigens had found a highly prevalent virus
associated with a highly prevalent human cancer. Blumberg was acutely
aware of the NCI’s embarrassment, and of the serendipity in his work.
His departure from the NIH in 1964, although cordial, had been driven by
precisely such conflicts; his interdisciplinary curiosity had chafed
against the “discipline-determined rigidity of the constituent
institutes,” among which the NCI, with its goal-directed cancer virus
hunt, was the worst culprit. Worse still for the strongest enthusiasts
of the cancer virus theory, it appeared as if Blumberg’s virus itself
was not the proximal cause of the cancer. The inflammation induced by
the virus in liver cells, and the associated cycle of death and repair,
appeared to be responsible for the cancer—a blow to the notion that
viruses directly cause cancer.</p>
<p>But Blumberg had little time to mull over these conflicts, and he
certainly had no theoretical axes to grind about viruses and cancer. A
pragmatist, he directed his team toward finding a vaccine for HBV. By
1979, his group had devised one. Like the blood-screening strategy, the
vaccine did not, of course, alter the course of the cancer after its
genesis, but it sharply reduced the susceptibility to HBV infection in
uninfected men and women. Blumberg had thus made a critical link from
cause to prevention. He had identified a viral carcinogen, found a
method to detect it before transmission, then found a means to thwart
transmission.</p>
<p>The strangest among the newly discovered “preventable” carcinogens,
though, was not a virus or a chemical but a cellular organism—a
bacterium. In 1979, the year that Blumberg’s hepatitis B vaccine was
beginning its trial in America, a junior resident in medicine named
Barry Marshall and a gastroenterologist, Robin Warren, both at the Royal
Perth Hospital in Australia, set out to investigate the cause of stomach
inflammation, gastritis, a condition known to predispose patients to
peptic ulcers and to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>For centuries, gastritis had rather vaguely been attributed to stress
and neuroses. (In popular use, the term dyspeptic still refers to an
irritable and fragile psychological state.) By extension, then, cancer
of the stomach was cancer unleashed by neurotic stress, in essence a
modern variant of the theory of clogged melancholia proposed by
Galen.</p>
<p>But Warren had convinced himself that the true cause of gastritis was
a yet unknown species of bacteria, an organism that, according to dogma,
could not even exist in the inhospitable acidic lumen of the stomach.
“Since the early days of medical bacteriology, over one hundred years
ago,” Warren wrote, “it was taught that bacteria do not grow in the
stomach. When I was a student, this was taken as so obvious as to barely
rate a mention. It was a ‘known fact,’ like ‘everyone knows that the
earth is flat.’”</p>
<p>But the flat-earth theory of stomach inflammation made little sense
to Warren. When he examined biopsies of men and women with gastritis or
gastric ulcers, he found a hazy, blue layer overlying the craterlike
depressions of the ulcers in the stomach. When he looked even harder at
that bluish layer, he inevitably saw spiral organisms teeming within
it.</p>
<p>Or had he imagined it? Warren was convinced that these organisms
represented a new species of bacterium that caused gastritis and peptic
ulcers. But he could not isolate the bacteria in any form on a plate,
dish, or culture. Others could not see the organism; Warren could not
grow it; the whole theory, with its blue haze of alien organisms growing
above craters in the stomach, smacked of science fiction.</p>
<p>Barry Marshall, in contrast, had no pet theory to test or disprove.
The son of a Kalgoorlie boilermaker and a nurse, he had trained in
medicine in Perth and was an unwhetted junior investigator looking for a
project. Intrigued by Warren’s data (although skeptical of the link with
an unknown, phantasmic bacteria), he started to collect brushings from
patients with ulcers and spread out the material on petri dishes, hoping
to grow a bacterium. But as with Warren, no bacteria grew out. Week
after week, Marshall’s dishes piled up in the incubator and were
discarded in large stacks after a few days of examination.</p>
<p>But then serendipity intervened: over an unexpectedly busy Easter
weekend in 1982, with the hospital overflowing with medical admissions,
Marshall forgot to examine his plates and left them in the incubator.
When he remembered and returned to examine them, he found tiny,
translucent pearls of bacterial colonies growing on the agar. The long
incubation period had been critical. Under the microscope, the bacterium
growing on the plate was a minuscule, slow-growing, fragile organism
with a helical tail, a species that had never been described by
microbiologists. Warren and Marshall called it Helicobacter
pylori—helicobacter for its appearance, and pylorus from the Latin for
“gatekeeper,” for its location near the outlet valve of the stomach.</p>
<p>But the mere existence of the bacteria, or even its association with
ulcers, was not proof enough that it caused gastritis. Koch’s third
postulate stipulated that to be classified as a bona fide causal element
for a disease, an organism needed to re-create the disease when
introduced into a naive host. Marshall and Warren inoculated pigs with
the bacteria and performed serial endoscopies. But the pigs—seventy
pounds of porcine weight that did not take kindly to weekly
endoscopies—did not sprout any ulcers. And testing the theory on humans
was ethically impossible: how could one justify infecting a human with a
new, uncharacterized species of bacteria to prove that it caused
gastritis and predisposed to cancer?</p>
<p>In July 1984, with his experiments stalled and his grant applications
in jeopardy, Marshall performed the ultimate experiment: “On the morning
of the experiment, I omitted my breakfast. . . . Two hours later, Neil
Noakes scraped a heavily inoculated 4 day culture plate of Helicobacter
and dispersed the bacteria in alkaline peptone water (a kind of meat
broth used to keep bacteria alive). I fasted until 10 am when Neil
handed me a 200 ml beaker about one quarter full of the cloudy brown
liquid. I drank it down in one gulp then fasted for the rest of the day.
A few stomach gurgles occurred. Was it the bacteria or was I just
hungry?”</p>
<p>Marshall was not “just hungry.” Within a few days of swallowing the
turbid bacterial culture, he was violently ill, with nausea, vomiting,
night sweats, and chills. He persuaded a colleague to perform serial
biopsies to document the pathological changes, and he was diagnosed with
highly active gastritis, with a dense overlay of bacteria in his stomach
and ulcerating craters beneath—precisely what Warren had found in his
patients. In late July, with Warren as coauthor, Marshall submitted his
own case report to the Medical Journal of Australia for publication (“a
normal volunteer [has] swallowed a pure culture of the organism,” he
wrote). The critics had at last been silenced. Helicobacter pylori was
indisputably the cause of gastric inflammation.</p>
<p>The link between Helicobacter and gastritis raised the possibility
that bacterial infection and chronic inflammation caused stomach
cancer.* Indeed, by the late 1980s, several epidemiological studies had
linked H. pylori–induced gastritis with stomach cancer. Marshall and
Warren had, meanwhile, tested antibiotic regimens (including the
once-forsaken alchemical agent bismuth) to create a potent multidrug
treatment for the H. pylori infection.* Randomized trials run on the
western coast of Japan, where stomach and H. pylori infection are
endemic, showed that antibiotic treatment reduced gastric ulcers and
gastritis.</p>
<p>The effect of antibiotic therapy on cancer, though, was more complex.
The eradication of H. pylori infection in young men and women reduced
the incidence of gastric cancer. In older patients, in whom chronic
gastritis had smoldered for several decades, eradication of the
infection had little effect. In these elderly patients, presumably the
chronic inflammation had already progressed to a point that its
eradication made no difference. For cancer prevention to work,
Auerbach’s march—the prodrome of cancer—had to be halted early.</p>
<p>Although unorthodox in the extreme, Barry Marshall’s
“experiment”—swallowing a carcinogen to create a precancerous state in
his own stomach—encapsulated a growing sense of impatience and
frustration among cancer epidemiologists. Powerful strategies for cancer
prevention arise, clearly, from a deep understanding of causes. The
identification of a carcinogen is only the first step toward that
understanding. To mount a successful strategy against cancer, one needs
to know not only what the carcinogen is, but what the carcinogen
does.</p>
<p>But the set of disparate observations—from Blumberg to Ames to Warren
and Marshall—could not simply be stitched together into a coherent
theory of carcinogenesis. How could DES, asbestos, radiation, hepatitis
virus, and a stomach bacterium all converge on the same pathological
state, although in different populations and in different organs? The
list of cancer-causing agents seemed to get—as another swallower of
unknown potions might have put it—“curiouser and curiouser.”</p>
<p>There was little precedent in other diseases for such an astonishing
diversity of causes. Diabetes, a complex illness with complex
manifestations, is still fundamentally a disease of abnormal insulin
signaling. Coronary heart disease occurs when a clot, arising from a
ruptured and inflamed atherosclerotic plaque, occludes a blood vessel of
the heart. But the search for a unifying mechanistic description of
cancer seemed to be sorely missing. What, beyond abnormal, dysregulated
cell division, was the common pathophysiological mechanism underlying
cancer?</p>
<p>To answer this question, cancer biologists would need to return to
the birth of cancer, to the very first steps of a cell’s journey toward
malignant transformation—to carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>*H. pylori infection is linked to several forms of cancer, including
gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoma.</p>
<p>*Marshall later treated himself with the regimen and eradicated his
infection.</p>
