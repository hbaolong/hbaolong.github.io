<h4 id="stamp">STAMP</h4>
<p>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp
them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p>
<p>—Samuel 22:43</p>
<p>Cancer therapy is like beating the dog with a stick to get rid of his
fleas.</p>
<p>—Anna Deavere Smith, Let Me Down Easy</p>
<p>February was my cruelest month. The second month of 2004 arrived with
a salvo of deaths and relapses, each marked with the astonishing,
punctuated clarity of a gunshot in winter. Steve Harmon, thirty-six, had
esophageal cancer growing at the inlet of his stomach. For six months,
he had soldiered through chemotherapy as if caught in a mythical
punishment cycle devised by the Greeks. He was debilitated by perhaps
the severest forms of nausea that I had ever encountered in a patient,
but he had to keep eating to avoid losing weight. As the tumor whittled
him down week by week, he became fixated, absurdly, on the measurement
of his weight down to a fraction of an ounce, as if gripped by the fear
that he might vanish altogether by reaching zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a growing retinue of family members accompanied him to his
clinic visits: three children who came with games and books and watched,
unbearably, as their father shook with chills one morning; a brother who
hovered suspiciously, then accusingly, as we shuffled and reshuffled
medicines to keep Steve from throwing up; a wife who bravely shepherded
the entire retinue through the whole affair as if it were a family trip
gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p>One morning, finding Steve alone on one of the reclining chairs of
the infusion room, I asked him whether he would rather have the
chemotherapy alone, in a private room. Was it, perhaps, too much for his
family—for his children?</p>
<p>He looked away with a flicker of irritation. “I know what the
statistics are.” His voice was strained, as if tightening against a
harness. “Left to myself, I would not even try. I’m doing this because
of the kids.”</p>
<p>“If a man die,” William Carlos Williams once wrote, “it is because
death / has first possessed his imagination.” Death possessed the
imagination of my patients that month, and my task was to repossess
imagination from death. It is a task almost impossibly difficult to
describe, an operation far more delicate and complex than the
administration of a medicine or the performance of surgery. It was easy
to repossess imagination with false promises; much harder to do so with
nuanced truths. It demanded an act of exquisite measuring and
remeasuring, filling and unfilling a psychological respirator with
oxygen. Too much “repossession” and imagination might bloat into
delusion. Too little and it might asphyxiate hope altogether.</p>
<p>In his poignant memoir of his mother’s illness, Susan Sontag’s son,
David Rieff, describes a meeting between Sontag and a prominent doctor
in New York. Sontag, having survived uterine and breast cancer, had been
diagnosed with myelodysplasia, a precancerous disease that often sours
into full-blown leukemia. (Sontag’s myelodysplasia was caused by the
high-dose chemotherapy that she had received for the other cancers.) The
doctor—Rieff calls him Dr. A.—was totally pessimistic. There was no
hope, he told her flatly. And not just that; there was nothing to do but
wait for cancer to explode out of the bone marrow. All options were
closed. His word—the Word—was final, immutable, static. “Like so many
doctors,” Rieff recalls, “he spoke to us as if we were children but
without the care that a sensible adult takes in choosing what words to
use with a child.”</p>
<p>The sheer inflexibility of that approach and the arrogance of its
finality was a nearly fatal blow for Sontag. Hopelessness became
breathlessness, especially for a woman who wanted to live twice as
energetically, to breathe the world in twice as fast as anyone else—for
whom stillness was mortality. It took months before Sontag found another
doctor whose attitude was vastly more measured and who was willing to
negotiate with her psyche. Dr. A. was right, of course, in the formal,
statistical sense. A moody, saturnine leukemia eventually volcanoed out
of Sontag’s marrow, and, yes, there were few medical options. But
Sontag’s new physician also told her precisely the same information,
without ever choking off the possibility of a miraculous remission. He
moved her in succession from standard drugs to experimental drugs to
palliative drugs. It was all masterfully done, a graded movement toward
reconciliation with death, but a movement nonetheless—statistics without
stasis.</p>
<p>Of all the clinicians I met during my fellowship, the master of this
approach was Thomas Lynch, a lung cancer doctor, whom I often
accompanied to clinic. Clinics with Lynch, a youthful-looking man with a
startling shock of gray hair, were an exercise in medical nuance. One
morning, for instance, a sixty-six-year-old woman, Kate Fitz, came to
the clinic having just recovered from surgery for a large lung mass,
which had turned out to be cancerous. Sitting alone in the room,
awaiting news of her next steps, she looked nearly catatonic with
fear.</p>
<p>I was about to enter the room when Lynch caught me by the shoulder
and pulled me into the side room. He had looked through her scan and her
reports. Everything about the excised tumor suggested a high risk of
recurrence. But more important, he had seen Fitz folded over in fear in
the waiting room. Right now, he said, she needed something else.
“Resuscitation,” he called it cryptically as he strode into her
room.</p>
<p>I watched him resuscitate. He emphasized process over outcome and
transmitted astonishing amounts of information with a touch so slight
that you might not even feel it. He told Fitz about the tumor, the good
news about the surgery, asked about her family, then spoke about his
own. He spoke about his child who was complaining about her long days at
school. Did Fitz have a grandchild? he inquired. Did a daughter or a son
live close by? And then, as I watched, he began to insert numbers here
and there with a light-handedness that was a marvel to observe.</p>
<p>“You might read somewhere that for your particular form of cancer,
there is a high chance of local recurrence or metastasis,” he said.
“Perhaps even fifty or sixty percent.”</p>
<p>She nodded, tensing up.</p>
<p>“Well, there are ways that we will tend to it when that happens.”</p>
<p>I noted that he had said “when,” not “if.” The numbers told a
statistical truth, but the sentence implied nuance. “We will tend to
it,” he said, not “we will obliterate it.” Care, not cure. The
conversation ran for nearly an hour. In his hands, information was
something live and molten, ready to freeze into a hard shape at any
moment, something crystalline yet negotiable; he nudged and shaped it
like glass in the hands of a glassblower.</p>
<p>An anxious woman with stage III breast cancer needs her imagination
to be repossessed before she will accept chemotherapy that will likely
extend her life. A seventy-six-year-old man attempting another round of
aggressive experimental chemotherapy for a fatal, drug-resistant
leukemia needs his imagination to be reconciled to the reality that his
disease cannot be treated. Ars longa, vita brevis. The art of medicine
is long, Hippocrates tells us, “and life is short; opportunity fleeting;
the experiment perilous; judgment flawed.”</p>
<p>For cancer therapeutics, the mid and late 1980s were extraordinarily
cruel years, mixing promise with disappointment, and resilience with
despair. As physician-writer Abraham Verghese wrote, “To say this was a
time of unreal and unparalleled confidence, bordering on conceit, in the
Western medical world is to understate things. . . . When the outcome of
treatment was not good, it was because the host was aged, the protoplasm
frail, or the patient had presented too late—never because medical
science was impotent.</p>
<p>“There seemed to be little that medicine could not do. . . .
Surgeons, like Tom Starzl . . . were embarking on twelve- to
fourteen-hour ‘cluster operations’ where liver, pancreas, duodenum and
jejunum were removed en bloc from a donor and transplanted into a
patient whose belly, previously riddled with cancer, had now been
eviscerated, scooped clean in preparation for this organ bouquet.</p>
<p>“Starzl was an icon for that period in medicine, the pre-AIDS days,
the frontier days of every-other-night call.”</p>
<p>Yet even the patients eviscerated and reimplanted with these “organ
bouquets” did not make it: they survived the operation, but not the
disease.</p>
<p>The chemotherapeutic equivalent of that surgical assault—of
eviscerating the body and replacing it with an implant—was a procedure
known as autologous bone marrow transplant, or ABMT, which roared into
national and international prominence in the mid-1980s. At its core,
ABMT was based on an audacious conjecture. Ever since high-dose,
multidrug regimens had succeeded in curing acute leukemia and Hodgkin’s
disease in the 1960s, chemotherapists had wondered whether solid tumors,
such as breast or lung cancer, had remained recalcitrant to
chemotherapeutic obliteration simply because the bludgeon of drugs used
was not powerful enough. What if, some had fantasized, one could tip the
human body even closer to the brink of death with even higher doses of
cytotoxic drugs? Might it be dragged back from that near-lethal brink,
leaving cancer behind? What if one could double, or even quadruple, the
dosage of drugs?</p>
<p>The dose limit of a drug is set by its toxicity to normal cells. For
most chemotherapy drugs, that dose limit rested principally on a single
organ—the bone marrow, whose whirring cellular mill, as Farber had
found, was so exquisitely sensitive to most drugs that patients
administered drugs to kill cancer were left with no normal blood-forming
cells. For a while, then, it was the bone marrow’s sensitivity to
cytotoxic drugs that had defined the outer horizon of chemotherapeutic
dosage. The bone marrow represented the frontier of toxicity, an
unbreachable barrier that limited the capacity to deliver obliterative
chemotherapy—the “red ceiling” as some oncologists called it.</p>
<p>But by the late 1960s, even that ceiling had seemed to lift. In
Seattle, one of Farber’s early protégés, E. Donnall Thomas, had shown
that bone marrow, much like a kidney or liver, could be harvested from
one patient and transplanted back—either into the same patient (called
autologous transplantation) or into another patient (termed allogeneic
transplantation).</p>
<p>Allogeneic transplantation (i.e., transplanting foreign marrow into a
patient) was temperamental—tricky, mercurial, often deadly. But in some
cancers, particularly leukemias, it was potentially curative. One could,
for instance, obliterate a marrow riddled with leukemia using high-dose
chemo and replace it with fresh, clean marrow from another patient. Once
the new marrow had engrafted, the recipient ran the risk of that foreign
marrow turning and attacking his or her own body as well as any residual
leukemia left in the marrow, a deadly complication termed
graft-versus-host disease or GVHD. But in some patients, that trifecta
of assaults—obliterative chemotherapy, marrow replacement, and the
attack on the tumor by foreign cells—could be fashioned into an
exquisitely potent therapeutic weapon against cancer. The procedure
carried severe risks. In Thomas’s initial trial at Seattle, only twelve
out of a hundred patients had survived. But by the early 1980s, doctors
were using the procedure for refractory leukemias, multiple myeloma, and
myelodysplastic syndrome—diseases inherently resistant to chemotherapy.
Success was limited, but at least some patients were eventually
cured.</p>
<p>Autologous bone marrow transplantation was, if conceivable, the
lighter fraternal twin of allogeneic transplantation. Here, the
patient’s own marrow was harvested, frozen, and transplanted back into
his or her body. No donor was needed. The principal purpose was not to
replace diseased marrow (using a foreign marrow) but to maximize
chemotherapeutic dosage. A patient’s own marrow, containing
blood-forming cells, was harvested and frozen. Then blisteringly high
levels of drugs were administered to kill cancer. The frozen marrow was
thawed and implanted. Since the frozen marrow cells were spared the
brunt of chemotherapy, transplantation allowed doctors, theoretically at
least, to push doses of chemo to their ultimate end.</p>
<p>For advocates of megadose chemotherapy, ABMT breached a final and
crucial roadblock. It was now possible to give five- or even tenfold the
typical doses of drugs, in poisonous cocktails and combinations once
considered incompatible with survival. Among the first and most fervent
proponents of this strategy was Tom Frei—cautious, levelheaded Frei, who
had moved from Houston to Boston as the director of Farber’s institute.
By the early 1980s, Frei had convinced himself that a megadose
combination regimen, bolstered by marrow transplantation, was the only
conceivable solution in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>To test this theory, Frei hoped to launch one of the most ambitious
trials in the history of chemotherapy. With his ear for catchy acronyms,
Frei christened the protocol the Solid Tumor Autologous Marrow
Program—or STAMP. Crystallized in that name was the storm and rage of
cancer medicine; if brute force was needed, then brute force would be
summoned. With searing doses of cytotoxic drugs, STAMP would trample its
way over cancer. “We have a cure for breast cancer,” Frei told one of
his colleagues in the summer of 1982. Uncharacteristically, he had
already let his optimism fly to the far edge of brinkmanship. The first
patient had not even been enrolled on trial.</p>
<p>VAMP had succeeded, Frei privately believed, not just because of the
unique chemotherapeutic synergy among the drugs, but also because of the
unique human synergy at the NCI—that cocktail of brilliant young minds
and risk-taking bodies that had coalesced in Bethesda between 1955 and
1960. In Boston, two decades later, Frei assiduously set about
re-creating that same potent atmosphere, tossing out deadwood faculty
and replacing it with fresh new blood. “It was an intensely competitive
place,” Robert Mayer, the oncologist, recalled, “a pressure cooker for
junior and senior faculty.” Trial-running was the principal currency of
academic advancement, and volley after volley of trials were launched at
the institute with a grim, nearly athletic, determination. Metaphors of
war permeated the Farber. Cancer was the ultimate enemy, and this was
its ultimate crucible, its epic battleground. Laboratory space and
clinical space were deliberately intermingled through the floors to
create the impression of a highly sophisticated interlocking machine
dedicated to a single cause. On blackboards mounted on laboratory walls,
complex diagrams with zigzagging arrows and lines depicted the life line
of a cancer cell. To walk through the narrow corridors of the institute
was to feel immersed in a gigantic, subterranean war room, where
technological prowess was on full display and every molecule of air
seemed poised for a battle.</p>
<p>In 1982, Frei recruited William Peters, a young doctor from New York,
as a fellow at the institute. Peters was an academic all-star. He had
graduated from Pennsylvania State University with three majors, in
biochemistry, biophysics, and philosophy, then steamrollered his way
through the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, earning both
an M.D. and a Ph.D. Affable, determined, enthusiastic, and ambitious, he
was considered the most able corporal among the troops of junior faculty
at the Farber. The relationship between Frei and Peters was almost
instantly magnetic, perhaps even parental. Peters was instinctually
drawn to Frei’s reputation, creativity, and unorthodox methods; Frei, to
Peters’s energy and enthusiasm. Each saw in the other an earlier or
later incarnation of himself.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoons, fellows and faculty at the Farber gathered in
a conference room on the sixteenth floor. The room was symbolically set
on the highest floor of the building, its large windows, overlooking the
evergreen fens of Boston, and its wood-paneled walls, blond and
reflective, creating a light-immersed casket suspended midair. Lunch was
catered. The doors were closed. It was a time dedicated to academic
thinking, sealed away from the daily whir of labs and clinics in the
floors below.</p>
<p>It was at these afternoon conferences that Frei began to introduce
the idea of megadose combination chemotherapy with autologous marrow
support to the fellows and junior faculty. In the fall of 1983, he
invited Howard Skipper, the soft-spoken “mouse doctor” who had so deeply
influenced Frei’s early work, to speak. Skipper was inching toward
higher and higher doses of cytotoxic drugs in his mouse models and spoke
enthusiastically about the possibility of curative treatment with these
megadose regimens. He was soon after followed by Frank Schabel, another
scientist who had demonstrated that combining agents, in doses lethal
for the marrow, possessed synergistic effects on mouse tumors. Schabel’s
lecture was particularly galvanizing, a “seminal event,” as Peters
described it. After the talk, as Frei recalled, the room was abuzz with
excitement; Schabel was surrounded by young, eager investigators
mesmerized by his ideas. Among the youngest, and by far the most eager,
was Bill Peters.</p>
<p>Yet the surer Frei became about megadose chemotherapy, the less sure
some others around him seemed to get. George Canellos, for one, was
wary, right from the outset. Wiry and tall, with a slight stoop and a
commanding basso-profundo voice, Canellos was the closest to Frei’s
equal at the institute, an original member of the NCI from its heady
early days in the mid-1960s. Unlike Frei, though, Canellos had turned
from advocate to adversary of megadose chemo regimens, in part because
he had been among the first to notice a devastating long-term side
effect: as doses escalated, some chemotherapeutic drugs damaged the
marrow so severely that, in time, these regimens could precipitate a
premalignant syndrome called myelodysplasia, a condition that tended to
progress to leukemia. The leukemias that arose from the ashes of
chemotherapy-treated marrows carried such grotesque and aberrant
mutations that they were virtually resistant to any drugs, as if their
initial passage through that fire had tempered them into
immortality.</p>
<p>With Canellos arguing one side and Frei the other, the institute
split into bitterly opposing camps. But Peters and Frei were unstoppably
enthusiastic. By late 1982, with Frei’s guidance, Peters had written a
detailed protocol for the STAMP regimen. A few weeks later, the
Institutional Review Board at the Farber approved STAMP, giving Peters
and Frei the green light to begin their trial. “We were going to swing
and go for the ring,” Peters recalled. “That drove us. You had to
believe you were going to pull off something that was going to change
history.”</p>
<p>The first patient to “change history” with STAMP was a
thirty-year-old commercial driver from Massachusetts with breast cancer.
A grim, determined, hefty woman hardened by the gritty culture of truck
stops and highways, she had been treated and re-treated with multiple
standard and escalating regimens of chemotherapy. Her tumor, a friable,
inflamed disk of tissue, was nearly six centimeters wide, hanging
visibly off her chest wall. But having “failed” all the conventional
treatments, she had become virtually invisible to the institute. Her
case was considered so terminal that she had been written off from every
other experimental protocol. When she signed on to Peters’s protocol, no
one objected.</p>
<p>Marrow transplantation begins, of course, by “harvesting” bone
marrow. On the morning of the first harvest, Peters went down to the
leukemia clinic and gathered his arms full of bone marrow needles. He
wheeled his first patient over to the operating room at the neighboring
Beth Israel hospital (the Farber had no operating rooms) and began
pulling out the marrow, plunging a steel trocar repeatedly into the hip
and drawing out the cells, leaving a hip pockmarked with red bruises.
Each time he pulled, a few droplets of reddish sludge gathered in the
syringe.</p>
<p>Then disaster struck. As Peters pulled out a specimen, the marrow
needle broke, leaving a piece of steel buried deeply in his patient’s
hip. For a few minutes, pandemonium broke out in the operating room.
Nurses made frantic phone calls to the floors, asking for surgeons to
step in to help. An hour later, using a pair of orthopedic pliers to dig
into the hip, Peters recovered the needle.</p>
<p>Later that evening, the full impact of that moment struck Peters. It
had been a close shave. “The ultimate trial of chemotherapeutic
intensification,” Peters said, “almost broke its back on an old needle.”
For Peters and Frei, it was an all-too-obvious metaphor for the
rustiness and obsolescence of the status quo. The War on Cancer was
being waged by timorous doctors (unwilling to maximize chemotherapy)
with blunt, outmoded weapons.</p>
<p>For a few weeks after that initial tumult, Peters’s life fell into a
reasonably stable routine. Early mornings, dodging Canellos and other
muttering skeptics, he rounded on his patients on the far corner of the
twelfth floor, where a few rooms had been set aside for the trial.
Evenings were spent at home with Masterpiece Theatre playing in the
background as he sharpened needles physically and sharpened the trial
intellectually. As the trial gathered speed, it also gained visibility.
Peters’s first few patients had been last-ditch, hopeless cases, women
with tumors so deeply recalcitrant to all drugs that they were readily
enrolled in experimental trials as a last resort in the hope of
obtaining even a minor remission. But as rumors of the trial coursed
through networks of patients and friends, cancer patients began to
contact Peters and Frei to try the megadose strategy up front—not after
they had failed more conventional regimens, but before they had even
tried anything else. In the late summer of 1983, when a previously
untreated woman with metastatic breast cancer enrolled in STAMP, as
Peters recalled, the institute stood up to take notice. “Suddenly,
everything broke loose and things came apart.”</p>
<p>The woman was thirty-six years old—charming, sophisticated, intense,
coiled and tightened into a spring by her yearlong battle with illness.
She had watched her mother die of an aggressive breast cancer that had
been fiercely resistant to conventional therapy. Instinctually, she was
convinced that hers would be just as virulent and just as resistant. She
wanted to live and wanted the most aggressive therapy up front, without
soldiering through trials that would, she was convinced, fail anyway.
When Peters offered her STAMP, she grasped at it without hesitation.</p>
<p>Her clinical course was among the most closely watched in the history
of the institute. Fortunately for Peters, chemotherapy and
transplantation went smoothly. On the seventh day after megadose
chemotherapy, when Frei and Peters hurried down to the basement to look
at the first chest X-ray after treatment, they found that they had been
beaten to it. An entire congregation of curious doctors had gathered in
the room like a jury and was huddled around the films. Against the
sharp, fluorescent light, her chest X-ray showed a marked response. The
metastatic deposits peppered around in her lung had shrunk visibly, and
even the swollen lymph nodes around it had visibly recessed. It was, as
Peters recalls, “the most beautiful remission you could have
imagined.”</p>
<p>As the year drew on, Peters treated and transplanted more cases and
obtained beautiful remissions. By the summer of 1984, the database of
transplanted cases was large enough to begin to discern patterns. The
medical complications of the STAMP regimen had, of course, been
predictably ghastly: near-lethal infections, severe anemia, pneumonias,
and hemorrhages in the heart. But under the clouds of X-rays, blood
tests, and CT scans, Peters and Frei saw a silvery inkling. The
remissions produced by STAMP, they were convinced, had all been more
durable than those produced by conventional chemotherapy. It was only an
impression—at best, a guess. To prove that point, Peters needed a
randomized trial. In 1985, with Frei’s encouragement, he left Boston to
set up a STAMP program at Duke University in North Carolina. He wanted
to leave the Farber’s “pressure cooker” behind for a quiet and stable
academic place where he could run a trial in peace.</p>
<p>As William Peters dreamed of a quiet and stable environment to test
megadose chemotherapy, the world of medicine was overturned by an
unexpected and seemingly unrelated event. In March 1981, in the journal
Lancet, a team of doctors reported eight cases of a highly unusual form
of cancer called Kaposi’s sarcoma in a cohort of men in New York. The
disease was not new: named after a nineteenth-century Hungarian
dermatologist, Kaposi’s sarcoma had long been recognized as a
slow-growing, violet-colored, indolent tumor that crept along the skin
of elderly Italian men that, while occasionally serious, was often
considered a somewhat glorified form of a mole or carbuncle. But all the
Lancet cases were virtually unrecognizable forms of the disease, violent
and aggressive variants that had exploded into bleeding, metastatic,
blue-black macules spread all over the bodies of these young men. All
eight of the men were homosexual. The eighth case drew particular alarm
and interest: this man, with lesions on his head and back, was also
diagnosed with a rare pneumonia called PCP caused by the organism
Pneumocystis carinii. An outbreak of one obscure illness in a cluster of
young men was already outlandish. The confluence of two suggested a
deeper and darker aberration—not just a disease, but a syndrome.</p>
<p>Far away from New York, the sudden appearance of Pneumocystis carinii
was also raising eyebrows at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
Georgia. The CDC is the nation’s medical radar screen, an agency that
tracks emerging diseases to discern patterns and contain their spread.
Pneumocystis pneumonia only occurs in humans when the immune system is
severely compromised. The principal victims had been cancer patients
whose white blood cells had been decimated by chemotherapy. (DeVita had
encountered it in Hodgkin’s patients treated with four-drug chemo.) The
new cases of PCP made little sense: these were young, previously healthy
men who had suddenly succumbed to PCP with their immune systems on the
verge of collapse.</p>
<p>By the late summer of that year, as the coastal cities sweltered in a
heat wave, the CDC began to sense that an epidemiological catastrophe
was forming out of thin air. Between June and August 1981, the weather
vane of strange illnesses swung frantically around its pivot: additional
clusters of PCP, Kaposi’s sarcoma, cryptococcal meningitis, and rare
lymphomas were reported in young men in cities throughout America. The
common pattern behind all these diseases, aside from their
disproportionate predilection for gay men, was a massive, near-total
collapse of the immune system. A letter in Lancet called the disease
“gay compromise syndrome.” Others called it GRID (gay-related immune
deficiency) or, more cruelly, gay cancer. In July 1982, with an
understanding of the cause still missing, the disease finally stumbled
upon its modern name, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.</p>
<p>Twinned conspicuously at this birth, the trajectories of AIDS and
cancer were destined to crisscross and intersect at many levels. And it
was Sontag, again, writing piercingly from her New York apartment (from
whose terraced windows she could observe the AIDS epidemic whirling
through the streets of Chelsea below), who immediately recognized the
symbolic parallels between the two diseases. In a trenchant essay
written as a reply to her earlier Illness as Metaphor, Sontag argued
that AIDS, like cancer, was becoming not just a biological disease but
something much larger—a social and political category replete with its
own punitive metaphors. Like cancer patients, AIDS patients were also
paralyzed and shrouded by those metaphors—stripped bare, like the cancer
patient in Solzhenitsyn’s Cancer Ward, then forced to don the ghoulish
uniform of their disease. The stigmas attached to cancer—guilt, secrecy,
shame—were recycled and refitted for AIDS, acquiring tenfold force and
potency: sexual guilt, sexual secrecy, sexual shame. If cancer, as
Sontag had once argued, was perceived as the product of spoiled germ, of
biological mutability gone wild, then AIDS was the result of
contaminated germ, of social mutability gone wild: men unmoored from the
usual conventions of society, metastasizing from coast to coast on
airplanes, carrying disease and devastation within them. A patient
afflicted with AIDS thus evaporated from individual existence and
morphed instantly into an imagined archetype—a young gay man, fresh out
of the bathhouses, defiled and ravaged by profligacy, now lying
namelessly in the hospital wards of New York or San Francisco.</p>
<p>Sontag concerned herself with metaphorical parallels, but down in
those wards, the medical battles also paralleled the battles fought
against cancer. In the early days, among the first doctors to encounter
and treat AIDS patients were oncologists. One of the “sentinel” diseases
of immunodeficiency was Kaposi’s sarcoma, an explosive variant of an
indolent cancer that had appeared without warning on the bodies of young
men. In San Francisco, at the epicenter of the epidemic, the first
clinic to be organized for AIDS patients was thus a sarcoma clinic that
began to meet weekly beginning in September 1981 led by a dermatologist,
Marcus Conant, and an oncologist, Paul Volberding. Volberding
personified the crisscrossing fates of the two diseases. Trained as an
oncologist at the University of California, San Francisco, he had spent
a rather disappointing stint in the laboratory studying mouse
retroviruses and, frustrated, switched from the lab to clinical oncology
at San Francisco General Hospital.</p>
<p>For Volberding, and for many of his earliest patients, AIDS was
cancer. To treat his sarcoma patients, Volberding borrowed various
chemotherapy regimens from the NCI’s protocols.* But more than
chemotherapy protocols, Volberding borrowed something more ineffable—an
ethos. At San Francisco General, at the end of a long linoleum-floored
corridor with chipped paint on the walls and naked lightbulbs dangling
from wires, Volberding and his team created the world’s first AIDS ward,
called Ward 5B, which was explicitly modeled after the cancer wards that
he had seen as a fellow. “What we did here,” he recalls, was “exactly
like an oncology unit, but with a different focus, AIDS. . . . But it
really was modeled on oncology units, where you have complex medical
diseases with a lot of psychosocial overlay, a lot of use of drugs that
are complex and require a sophisticated nursing staff and psychosocial
support staff.”</p>
<p>Nurses, many of them gay men, gravitated to Ward 5B to tend their
friends (or returned poignantly, as the epidemic bloomed, as patients
themselves). Doctors reinvented medicine here, pitting their wits
against a hostile, mysterious disease that they couldn’t quite fathom
that was plaguing a community that they didn’t quite understand. As the
patients boiled up with bizarre, spectral fevers, rules were unshackled
and reinvented, creating a ward that came to resemble the unorthodox
lives of the men who inhabited it. Fixed visiting hours were eliminated.
Friends, companions, lovers, and family members were allowed, even
encouraged, to sleep overnight in accompanying cots to help patients
through those burning, hallucinatory nights. On Sunday afternoons, a San
Francisco dancer catered elaborate brunches featuring tap dancing,
feather boas, and marijuana-laced brownies. Farber may not have
envisioned these particular innovations, but this, too, in a community
drenched with grief, was its own, inimitable interpretation of “total
care.”</p>
<p>Politically, too, AIDS activists borrowed language and tactics from
cancer lobbyists, and then imbued this language with their own urgency
and potency. In January 1982, as AIDS cases boomed, a group of six men
founded Gay Men’s Health Crisis in New York, a volunteer organization
dedicated to fighting AIDS through advocacy, lobbying, campaigning, and
protest. Early volunteers decamped outside discos, bars, and bathhouses
soliciting donations and distributing posters. From its office in a
crumbling Chelsea brownstone, GMHC coordinated an extraordinary national
effort to bring AIDS awareness to the masses. These were the Laskerites
of AIDS, albeit without the gray suits and pearls.</p>
<p>The seminal scientific breakthrough in the AIDS epidemic was,
meanwhile, unfolding in a laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Paris.
In January 1983, Luc Montagnier’s group found the sign of a virus in a
lymph node biopsy from a young gay man with Kaposi’s sarcoma and in a
Zairean woman who had died of immune deficiency. Montagnier soon deduced
that this was an RNA virus that could convert its genes into DNA and
lodge into the human genome—a retrovirus. He called his virus IDAV,
immuno-deficiency associated viruses, arguing that it was likely the
cause of AIDS.</p>
<p>At the National Cancer Institute, a group led by Robert Gallo was
also circling around the same virus, although under a different name. In
the spring of 1984, the two efforts converged dramatically. Gallo also
found a retrovirus in AIDS patients—Montagnier’s IDAV. A few months
later, the identity of the virus was confirmed by yet another group in
San Francisco. On April 23, 1984, Margaret Heckler, the Health and Human
Services secretary, thus appeared before the press with a bold statement
about the future of the epidemic. With a causal agent in hand, a cure
seemed just a few steps away. “The arrow of funds, medical personnel,
research . . . has hit the target,” she said. “We hope to have a vaccine
ready for testing in about two years. . . . Today’s discovery represents
the triumph of science over dread disease.”</p>
<p>But AIDS activists, facing the lethal upswirl of the epidemic that
was decimating their community, could not afford to wait. In the spring
of 1987, a group of volunteers splintered away from GMHC to form a group
named the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP. Led by a sardonic
and hyperarticulate writer named Larry Kramer, ACT UP promised to
transform the landscape of AIDS treatment using a kind of militant
activism unprecedented in the history of medicine. Kramer blamed many
forces for aiding and abetting the epidemic—he called it “genocide by
neglect”—but chief among the neglecters was the FDA. “Many of us who
live in daily terror of the AIDS epidemic,” Kramer wrote in the Times,
“cannot understand why the Food and Drug Administration has been so
intransigent in the face of this monstrous tidal wave of death.”</p>
<p>Symptomatic of this intransigence was the process by which the FDA
evaluated and approved lifesaving drugs for AIDS, a process that Kramer
characterized as terminally lazy and terminally slow. And terminally
gaga: the slow, contemplative “academic” mechanism of drug testing,
Kramer groused, was becoming life-threatening rather than lifesaving.
Randomized, placebo-controlled trials were all well and good in the cool
ivory towers of medicine, but patients afflicted by a deadly illness
needed drugs now. “Drugs into bodies; drugs into bodies,” ACT UP
chanted. A new model for accelerated clinical trials was needed. “The
FDA is fucked-up, the NIH is fucked-up . . . the boys and girls who are
running this show have been unable to get whatever system they’re
operating to work,” Kramer told his audience in New York. “Double-blind
studies,” he argued in an editorial, “were not created with terminal
illnesses in mind.” He concluded, “AIDS sufferers who have nothing to
lose, are more than willing to be guinea pigs.”</p>
<p>Even Kramer knew that that statement was extraordinary; Halsted’s
ghost had, after all, barely been laid to rest. But as ACT UP members
paraded through the streets of New York and Washington, frothing with
anger and burning paper effigies of FDA administrators, their argument
ricocheted potently through the media and the public imagination. And
the argument had a natural spillover to other, equally politicized
diseases. If AIDS patients demanded direct access to drugs and
treatments, should other patients with terminal illnesses not also make
similar demands? Patients with AIDS wanted drugs into bodies, so why
should bodies with cancer be left without drugs?</p>
<p>In Durham, North Carolina, a city barely touched by the AIDS epidemic
in 1987, the sound and fury of these demonstrations may have seemed like
a distant thunderclap. Deeply ensconced in his trial of megadose
chemotherapy at Duke University, William Peters could not possibly have
predicted that this very storm was about to turn south and beat its way
to his door.</p>
<p>The STAMP regimen—mega-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer—was
gathering momentum day by day. By the winter of 1984, thirty-two women
had completed the Phase I “safety” study—a trial designed to document
whether STAMP could safely be administered. The data looked promising:
although clearly toxic, selected patients could survive the regimen.
(Phase I studies are not designed to assess efficacy.) In December that
year, at the fifth annual Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, Texas,
there was abundant optimism about efficacy as well. “There was so much
excitement within the cancer community that some were already
convinced,” the statistician Donald Berry recalls. Peters was his
typically charming self at the conference—boyish, exuberant, cautious,
but inveterately positive. He called the meeting a “small victory.”</p>
<p>After San Antonio, the early-phase trials gathered speed. Emboldened
by the positive response, Peters pushed for evaluating STAMP not just
for metastatic breast cancer, but as an adjuvant therapy for high-risk
patients with locally advanced cancer (patients with more than ten
cancer-afflicted lymph nodes). Following Peters’s initial observations,
several groups across the nation also hotly pursued megadose
chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation. Two years later, with
early-phase trials completed successfully, a randomized, blinded, Phase
III trial was needed. Peters approached the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB), the centralized group that acted as a clearinghouse for
clinical trials, to sponsor a definitive multicenter, randomized
clinical trial.</p>
<p>On a winter afternoon, Peters flew up from Duke to Boston to detail a
STAMP trial to the CALGB for its approval. As expected, vicious
arguments broke out in the room. Some clinicians still contended that
STAMP was, in fact, no different from cytotoxic chemotherapy taken to
its extreme brink—stale wine being sold in a new bottle. Others
contended that the chemotherapeutic battle against cancer needed to be
taken to the brink. The meeting stretched hour upon hour, each side
hotly debating its points. In the end, the CALGB agreed to sponsor the
trial. Peters left the conference room on the sixth floor of the
Massachusetts General Hospital feeling bewildered but relieved. When the
hinged saloon door of the room swung closed behind him, it was as if he
had just emerged out of a nasty barroom brawl.</p>

were available.</li>
