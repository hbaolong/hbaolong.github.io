<h4 id="the-emperors-nylon-stockings">The Emperor’s Nylon Stockings</h4>
<p>Whether epidemiology alone can, in strict logic, ever prove
causality, even in this modern sense, may be questioned, but the same
must also be said of laboratory experiments on animals.</p>
<p>—Richard Doll</p>
<p>In the early winter of 1947, government statisticians in Britain
alerted the Ministry of Health that an unexpected “epidemic” was slowly
emerging in the United Kingdom: lung cancer morbidity had risen nearly
fifteenfold in the prior two decades. It is a “matter that ought to be
studied,” the deputy registrar wrote. The sentence, although couched in
characteristic English understatement, was strong enough to provoke a
response. In February 1947, in the midst of a bitterly cold winter, the
ministry asked the Medical Research Council to organize a conference of
experts on the outskirts of London to study this inexplicable rise of
lung cancer rates and to hunt for a cause.</p>
<p>The conference was a lunatic comedy. One expert, having noted
parenthetically that large urban towns (where cigarette consumption was
the highest) had much higher rates of lung cancer than villages (where
consumption was the lowest), concluded that “the only adequate
explanation” was the “smokiness or pollution of the atmosphere.” Others
blamed influenza, the fog, lack of sunshine, X-rays, road tar, the
common cold, coal fires, industrial pollution, gasworks, automobile
exhaust—in short, every breathable form of toxin except cigarette
smoke.</p>
<p>Befuddled by this variance in opinions, the council charged Austin
Bradford Hill, the eminent biostatistician who had devised the
randomized trial in the 1940s, to devise a more systematic study to
identify the risk factor for lung cancer. Yet the resources committed
for the study were almost comically minimal: on January 1, 1948, the
council authorized a part-time salary of £600 for a student, £350 each
for two social workers, and £300 for incidental expenses and supplies.
Hill recruited a thirty-six-year-old medical researcher, Richard Doll,
who had never performed a study of comparable scale or significance.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, too, the link between smoking and cancer was
seemingly visible only to neophytes—young interns and residents
“uneducated” in surgery and medicine who seemed to make an intuitive
connection between the two. In the summer of 1948, Ernst Wynder, a
medical student on a surgical rotation in New York, encountered an
unforgettable case of a forty-two-year-old man who had died of
bronchogenic carcinoma—cancer of the airways of the lung. The man had
been a smoker, and as in most autopsies of smokers, his body had been
scarred with the stigmata of chronic smoking: tar-stained bronchi and
soot-blackened lungs. The surgeon who was operating on the case made no
point of it. (As with most surgeons, the association had likely become
invisible to him.) But for Wynder, who had never encountered such a case
before, the image of cancer growing out of that soot-stained lung was
indelible; the link was virtually staring him in the face.</p>
<p>Wynder returned to St. Louis, where he was in medical school, and
applied for money to study the association between smoking and lung
cancer. He was brusquely told that the effort would be “futile.” He
wrote to the U.S. surgeon general quoting prior studies that had
hypothesized such an association, but was told that he would be unable
to prove anything. “The same correlation could be drawn to the intake of
milk. . . . No kind of interviewing [can] get satisfactory results from
patients. . . . Since nothing had been proved there exists no reason why
experimental work should be conducted along this line.”</p>
<p>Thwarted in his attempts to convince the surgeon general’s office,
Wynder recruited an unlikely but powerful mentor in St. Louis: Evarts
Graham, of “nylon stockings” fame. Graham didn’t believe the connection
between smoking and cancer either. The great pulmonary surgeon, who
operated on dozens of lung cancer cases every week, was rarely seen
without a cigarette himself. But he agreed to help Wynder with the study
in part to conclusively disprove the link and lay the issue to rest.
Graham also reasoned the trial would teach Wynder about the complexities
and nuances of study design and allow him to design a trial to capture
the real risk factor for lung cancer in the future.</p>
<p>Wynder and Graham’s trial followed a simple methodology. Lung cancer
patients and a group of control patients without cancer were asked about
their history of smoking. The ratio of smokers to nonsmokers within the
two groups was measured to estimate whether smokers were overrepresented
in lung cancer patients compared to other patients. This setup (called a
case-control study) was considered methodologically novel, but the trial
itself was thought to be largely unimportant. When Wynder presented his
preliminary ideas at a conference on lung biology in Memphis, not a
single question or comment came from the members of the audience, most
of whom had apparently slept through the talk or cared too little about
the topic to be roused. In contrast, the presentation that followed
Wynder’s, on an obscure disease called pulmonary adenomatosis in sheep,
generated a lively, half-hour debate.</p>
<p>Like Wynder and Graham in St. Louis, Doll and Hill could also barely
arouse any interest in their study in London. Hill’s department, called
the Statistical Unit, was housed in a narrow brick house in London’s
Bloomsbury district. Hefty Brunsviga calculators, the precursors of
modern computers, clacked and chimed in the rooms, ringing like clocks
each time a long division was performed. Epidemiologists from Europe,
America, and Australia thronged the statistical seminars. Just a few
steps away, on the gilded railings of the London School of Tropical
Medicine, the seminal epidemiological discoveries of the nineteenth
century—the mosquito as the carrier for malaria, or the sand fly for
black fever—were celebrated with plaques and inscriptions.</p>
<p>But many epidemiologists argued that such cause-effect relationships
could only be established for infectious diseases, where there was a
known pathogen and a known carrier (called a vector) for a disease—the
mosquito for malaria or the tsetse fly for sleeping sickness. Chronic,
noninfectious diseases such as cancer and diabetes were too complex and
too variable to be associated with single vectors or causes, let alone
“preventable” causes. The notion that a chronic disease such as lung
cancer might have a “carrier” of its own sort, to be gilded and hung
like an epidemiological trophy on one of those balconies, was dismissed
as nonsense.</p>
<p>In this charged, brooding atmosphere, Hill and Doll threw themselves
into work. They were an odd couple, the younger Doll formal,
dispassionate, and cool, the older Hill lively, quirky, and humorous, a
pukka Englishman and his puckish counterpart. The postwar economy was
brittle, and the treasury on the verge of a crisis. When the price of
cigarettes was increased by a shilling to collect additional tax
revenues, “tobacco tokens” were issued to those who declared themselves
“habitual users.” During breaks in the long hours and busy days, Doll, a
“habitual user” himself, stepped out of the building to catch a quick
smoke.</p>
<p>Doll and Hill’s study was initially devised as mainly a
methodological exercise. Patients with lung cancer (“cases”) versus
patients admitted for other illnesses (“controls”) were culled from
twenty hospitals in and around London and interviewed by a social worker
in a hospital. And since even Doll believed that tobacco was unlikely to
be the true culprit, the net of associations was spread widely. The
survey included questions about the proximity of gasworks to patients’
homes, how often they ate fried fish, and whether they preferred fried
bacon, sausage, or ham for dinner. Somewhere in that haystack of
questions, Doll buried a throwaway inquiry about smoking habits.</p>
<p>By May 1, 1948, 156 interviews had come in. And as Doll and Hill
sifted through the preliminary batch of responses, only one solid and
indisputable statistical association with lung cancer leapt out:
cigarette smoking. As more interviews poured in week after week, the
statistical association strengthened. Even Doll, who had personally
favored road-tar exposure as the cause of lung cancer, could no longer
argue with his own data. In the middle of the survey, sufficiently
alarmed, he gave up smoking.</p>
<p>In St. Louis, meanwhile, the Wynder-Graham team had arrived at
similar results. (The two studies, performed on two populations across
two continents, had converged on almost precisely the same magnitude of
risk—a testament to the strength of the association.) Doll and Hill
scrambled to get their paper to a journal. In September of that year,
their seminal study, “Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung,” was published
in the British Medical Journal. Wynder and Graham had already published
their study a few months earlier in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.</p>
<p>It is tempting to suggest that Doll, Hill, Wynder, and Graham had
rather effortlessly proved the link between lung cancer and smoking. But
they had, in fact, proved something rather different. To understand that
difference—and it is crucial—let us return to the methodology of the
case-control study.</p>
<p>In a case-control study, risk is estimated post hoc—in Doll’s and
Wynder’s case by asking patients with lung cancer whether they had
smoked. In an often-quoted statistical analogy, this is akin to asking
car accident victims whether they had been driving under the influence
of alcohol—but interviewing them after their accident. The numbers one
derives from such an experiment certainly inform us about a potential
link between accidents and alcohol. But it does not tell a drinker his
or her actual chances of being involved in an accident. It is risk
viewed as if from a rearview mirror, risk assessed backward. And as with
any distortion, subtle biases can creep into such estimations. What if
drivers tend to overestimate (or underestimate) their intoxication at
the time of an accident? Or what if (to return to Doll and Hill’s case)
the interviewers had unconsciously probed lung cancer victims more
aggressively about their smoking habits while neglecting similar habits
in the control group?</p>
<p>Hill knew the simplest method to counteract such biases: he had
invented it. If a cohort of people could be randomly assigned to two
groups, and one group forced to smoke cigarettes and the other forced
not to smoke, then one could follow the two groups over time and
determine whether lung cancer developed at an increased rate in the
smoking group. That would prove causality, but such a ghoulish human
experiment could not even be conceived, let alone performed on living
people, without violating fundamental principles of medical ethics.</p>
<p>But what if, recognizing the impossibility of that experiment, one
could settle for the next-best option—for a half-perfect experiment?
Random assignment aside, the problem with the Doll and Hill study thus
far was that it had estimated risk retrospectively. But what if they
could set the clocks back and launch their study before any of the
subjects developed cancer? Could an epidemiologist watch a disease such
as lung cancer develop from its moment of inception, much as an
embryologist might observe the hatching of an egg?</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, a similar notion had gripped the eccentric Oxford
geneticist Edmund Ford. A firm believer in Darwinian evolution, Ford
nonetheless knew that Darwin’s theory suffered from an important
limitation: thus far, the evolutionary progression had been inferred
indirectly from the fossil record, but never demonstrated directly on a
population of organisms. The trouble with fossils, of course, is that
they are fossilized—static and immobile in time. The existence of three
fossils A, B, and C, representing three distinct and progressive stages
of evolution, might suggest that fossil A generated B and fossil B
generated C. But this proof is retrospective and indirect; that three
evolutionary stages exist suggests, but cannot prove, that one fossil
had caused the genesis of the next.</p>
<p>The only formal method to prove the fact that populations undergo
defined genetic changes over time involves capturing that change in the
real world in real time—prospectively. Ford became particularly obsessed
with devising such a prospective experiment to watch Darwin’s cogwheels
in motion. To this end, he persuaded several students to tramp through
the damp marshes near Oxford collecting moths. Each time a moth was
captured, it was marked with a cellulose pen and released back into the
wild. Year after year, Ford’s students had returned with galoshes and
moth nets, recapturing and studying the moths that they had marked in
the prior years and their unmarked descendants—in effect, creating a
“census” of wild moths in the field. Minute changes in that cohort of
moths, such as shifts in wing markings or variations in size, shape, and
color, were recorded each year with great care. By charting those
changes over nearly a decade, Ford had begun to watch evolution in
action. He had documented gradual changes in the color of moth coats
(and thus changes in genes), grand fluctuations in populations and signs
of natural selection by moth predators—a macrocosm caught in a
marsh.*</p>
<p>Both Doll and Hill had followed this work with deep interest. And the
notion of using a similar cohort of humans occurred to Hill in the
winter of 1951—purportedly, like most great scientific notions, while in
his bath. Suppose a large group of men could be marked, à la Ford, with
some fantastical cellulose pen, and followed, decade after decade after
decade. The group would contain some natural mix of smokers and
nonsmokers. If smoking truly predisposed subjects to lung cancer (much
like bright-winged moths might be predisposed to being hunted by
predators), then the smokers would begin to succumb to cancer at an
increased rate. By following that cohort over time—by peering into that
natural marsh of human pathology—an epidemiologist could calculate the
precise relative risk of lung cancer among smokers versus
nonsmokers.</p>
<p>But how might one find a large enough cohort? Again, coincidences
surfaced. In Britain, efforts to nationalize health care had resulted in
a centralized registry of all doctors, containing more than sixty
thousand names. Every time a doctor in the registry died, the registrar
was notified, often with a relatively detailed description of the cause
of death. The result, as Doll’s collaborator and student Richard Peto
described it, was the creation of a “fortuitous laboratory” for a cohort
study. On October 31, 1951, Doll and Hill mailed out letters to about
59,600 doctors containing their survey. The questions were kept
intentionally brief: respondents were asked about their smoking habits,
an estimation of the amount smoked, and little else. Most doctors could
respond in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>An astonishing number—41,024 of them—wrote back. Back in London, Doll
and Hill created a master list of the doctors’ cohort, dividing it into
smokers and nonsmokers. Each time a death in the cohort was reported,
they contacted the registrar’s office to determine the precise cause of
death. Deaths from lung cancer were tabulated for smokers versus
nonsmokers. Doll and Hill could now sit back and watch cancer unfold in
real time.</p>
<p>In the twenty-nine months between October 1951 and March 1954, 789
deaths were reported in Doll and Hill’s original cohort. Thirty-six of
these were attributed to lung cancer. When these lung cancer deaths were
counted in smokers versus nonsmokers, the correlation virtually sprang
out: all thirty-six of the deaths had occurred in smokers. The
difference between the two groups was so significant that Doll and Hill
did not even need to apply complex statistical metrics to discern it.
The trial designed to bring the most rigorous statistical analysis to
the cause of lung cancer barely required elementary mathematics to prove
its point.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was Ford’s student Henry B. D. Kettlewell who used this
moth-labeling technique to show that dark-colored moths—better
camouflaged on pollution-darkened trees—tended to be spared by predatory
birds, thus demonstrating “natural selection” in action.</li>
