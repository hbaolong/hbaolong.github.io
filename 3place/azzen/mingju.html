<li><p>) Like Bennett, Virchow didn’t understand leukemia. But unlike
Bennett, he didn’t pretend to understand it. His insight lay entirely in
the negative. By wiping the slate clean of all preconceptions, he
cleared the field for thought.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the link between microorganisms and infection was yet to
be established, the connection between pus—purulence—and sepsis, fever,
and death, often arising from an abscess or wound, was well known to
Bennett.</p></li>
<li><p>The identification of HIV as the pathogen, and the rapid spread
of the virus across the globe, soon laid to rest the initially
observed—and culturally loaded—“predeliction” for gay men.</p></li>
<li><p>Virchow did not coin the word, although he offered a
comprehensive description of neoplasia.</p></li>
<li><p>An advisory council of scientists for the institute was assembled
from universities and hospitals. A state-of-the-art laboratory space,
with gleaming halls and conference rooms, was built among leafy arcades
and gardens in suburban Bethesda, a few miles from the nation’s capital.
“The nation is marshaling its forces to conquer cancer, the greatest
scourge that has ever assailed the human race,” Senator Bone announced
reassuringly while breaking ground for the building on October 3, 1938.
After nearly two decades of largely fruitless efforts, a coordinated
national response to cancer seemed to be on its way at last.</p></li>
<li><p>The elaborate armamentarium of “antivitamins” that Farber had
dreamed up so vividly in his fantasies did not exist.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1944, the NCI would become a subsidiary component of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). This foreshadowed the creation of
other disease-focused institutes over the next decades.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1946–47, Neely and Senator Claude Pepper launched a third
national cancer bill. This was defeated in Congress by a small margin in
1947.</p></li>
<li><p>In New York in the 1910s, William B. Coley, James Ewing, and
Ernest Codman had treated bone sarcomas with a mixture of bacterial
toxins—the so-called Coley’s toxin. Coley had observed occasional
responses, but the unpredictable responses, likely caused by immune
stimulation, never fully captured the attention of oncologists or
surgeons.</p></li>

<li><p>A child with leukemia was already stretched to the brittle limits
of survival, hanging on to life by a bare physiological thread. People
at the NCI would often casually talk of chemotherapy as the “poison of
the month.” If four poisons of the month were simultaneously pumped
daily into a three- or six-year-old child, there was virtually no
guarantee that he or she could survive even the first dose of this
regimen, let alone survive week after week after week.</p></li>
<li><p>Since most of the early anticancer drugs were
cytotoxic—cell-killing—the threshold between a therapeutic
(cancer-killing) dose and a toxic dose was extremely narrow. Many of the
drugs had to be very carefully dosed to avoid the unwarranted but
inextricably linked toxicity.</p></li>

<li><p>In many ways, Memphis was the antipode of Boston. Convulsing with
bitter racial tensions and rock-and-roll music—gyrating between the gold
and pink of the Graceland mansion in its south and the starkly
segregated black neighborhoods in its north—Memphis was turbulent,
unpredictable, colorful, perennially warm, and, medically speaking,
virtually a no-man’s-land. Pinkel’s new hospital, called St. Jude’s
(named, aptly enough, after the patron saint of lost causes), rose like
a marooned concrete starfish out of a concrete parking lot on a barren
field. In 1961, when Pinkel arrived, the hospital was barely functional,
with “no track record, uncertain finances, an unfinished building, no
employees or faculty.”</p></li>

years at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, before

of Jimmy, a coming-of-age moment for his “child with cancer.” The
Imperial Ballroom of the Statler Hotel, outside which the Variety Club
had once positioned its baseball-shaped donation box for Jimmy in the
1950s, was outfitted for a colossal celebration. The guest list included
Farber’s typically glitzy retinue of physicians, scientists,
philanthropists, and politicians. Mary Lasker couldn’t attend the event,
but she sent Elmer Bobst from the ACS. Zubrod flew up from the NCI.
Kenneth Endicott came from Bethesda.</p></li>

naked lightbulbs dangling from wires, Volberding and his team created
the world’s first AIDS ward, called Ward 5B, which was explicitly
modeled after the cancer wards that he had seen as a fellow. “What we
did here,” he recalls, was “exactly like an oncology unit, but with a
different focus, AIDS. . . . But it really was modeled on oncology
units, where you have complex medical diseases with a lot of
psychosocial overlay, a lot of use of drugs that are complex and require
a sophisticated nursing staff and psychosocial support staff.”</p></li>

<li><p>But it was the most reliable way to produce a real cancer in a
living organism. Cancer researchers knew that X-rays, soot, cigarette
smoke, and asbestos represented vastly more common risk factors for
human cancers. They had heard of the odd Brazilian case of a family that
seemed to carry retinoblastoma cancer in its genes. But the capacity to
manipulate cancer in an experimental environment was unique to the Rous
virus, and so it stood center stage, occupying all the
limelight.</p></li>
<li><p>Other cancer-causing viruses, such as SV40 and human
papillomavirus (HPV), would eventually be discovered in 1960 and 1983,

the discovery of oncogenes and the invention of curative chemotherapy.
But the two conversations seemed to be occurring in sealed and separate
universes, much as they had at Temin’s conference in Houston more than a
decade earlier. Frei’s award, for curing leukemia, and Erikson’s award,
for identifying the function of a critical oncogene, might almost have
been given to two unconnected pursuits. “I don’t remember any enthusiasm
among the clinicians to reach out to the cancer biologists to synthesize
the two poles of knowledge about cancer,” Erikson recalled. The two
halves of cancer, cause and cure, having feasted and been feted
together, sped off in separate taxis into the night.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, the “normal” cells that Weinberg had used were not
exactly normal. They were already growth-adapted, such that a single
activated oncogene could tip them into transformed growth. Truly
“normal” cells, Weinberg would later discover, require several genes to
become transformed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Laskerites had largely been disbanded in the aftermath of the
1971 National Cancer Act. Mary Lasker was still involved in science
policy, although with nowhere near the force and visceral energy that
she had summoned in the sixties.</p></li>
<li><p>Although cancer is not universally caused by viruses, certain
viruses cause particular cancers, such as the human papilloma virus
(HPV), which causes cervical cancer. When the mechanism driving this
cancer was deciphered in the 1990s, HPV turned out to inactivate Rb’s
and p53’s signal—underscoring the importance of endogenous genes in even
virally induced cancers.</p></li>

the present unfathomable and unrecognizable. “Everything has changed,”
Clauson recalled him saying. “The rooms, the patients, the drugs.” But
more than anything, survivorship had changed. “Einar remembered the
cancer ward as a place with many curtains,” she continued. “When the
children were well, the curtains would be spread open. But they would
soon close the curtains, and there would be no child when they were

were designed to treat human diseases in which a protein or a signal was
absent or low—insulin for diabetics, clotting factors for hemophiliacs,
growth hormone for dwarfs. An oncogene was the opposite—not a missing
signal, but a signal in overabundance. Genentech could fabricate a
missing protein in bacterial cells, but it had yet to learn how to
inactivate a hyperactive protein in a human cell.</p></li>

Bcr. The oncogene created by the fusion of these two genes in CML cells
was named Bcr-abl. In 1987, David Baltimore’s laboratory in Boston
“engineered” a mouse containing the activated Bcr-abl oncogene in its
blood cells. The mouse developed the fatal spleen-choking leukemia that
Bennett had seen in the Scottish slate-layer and Virchow in the German
cook more than a century earlier—proving that Bcr-abl drove the
pathological proliferation of CML cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Abl, too, was first discovered in a virus, and later found to be

<li><p>I was sure that it would end with Carla’s relapse and
death.</p></li>
<li><p>Indeed, the relative paucity of genetic aberrancy in this
leukemia may be one reason that this tumor is so easily felled by
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Scientists speculate that genetically simple
tumors (i.e., those carrying few mutations) might inherently be more
susceptible to drugs, and thus intrinsically more curable. If so, the
strange discrepancy between the success of high-dose chemotherapy in
curing leukemia and its failure to cure most other cancers has a deep
biological explanation. The search for a “universal cure” for cancer was
predicated on a tumor that, genetically speaking, is far from
universal.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus far, the full sequencing of ALL genomes has not been
completed. The alterations described are deletions or amplifications of
genes. Detailed sequencing may reveal an increase in the number of
mutated genes.</p></li>
<li><p>Mice filter out many of the carcinogenic components of tar.
Asbestos incites cancer by inducing a scar-forming, inflammatory
reaction in the body. Bacteria don’t generate this reaction and are thus
“immune” to asbestos.</p></li>
