<h4 id="an-anatomists-tumor">An Anatomist’s Tumor</h4>
<p>It took plain old courage to be a chemotherapist in the 1960s and
certainly the courage of the conviction that cancer would eventually
succumb to drugs.</p>
<p>—Vincent DeVita, National Cancer Institute</p>
<p>investigator (and eventually NCI director)</p>
<p>On a chilly February morning in 2004, a twenty-four-year-old athlete,
Ben Orman, discovered a lump in his neck. He was in his apartment,
reading the newspaper, when, running his hand absentmindedly past his
face, his fingers brushed against a small swelling. The lump was about
the size of a small dried grape. If he took a deep breath, he could
swallow it back into the cavity of his chest. He dismissed it. It was a
lump, he reasoned, and athletes were used to lumps: calluses, swollen
knees, boils, bumps, bruises coming and going with no remembered cause.
He returned to his newspaper and worry vanished from his mind. The lump
in his neck, whatever it was, would doubtless vanish in time as
well.</p>
<p>But it grew instead, imperceptibly at first, then more assertively,
turning from grape-size to prune-size in about a month. He could feel it
on the shallow dip of his collarbone. Worried, Orman went to the walk-in
clinic of the hospital, almost apologetic about his complaints. The
triage nurse scribbled in her notes: “Lump in his neck”—and added a
question mark at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>With that sentence, Orman entered the unfamiliar world of
oncology—swallowed, like his own lump, into the bizarre, cavitary
universe of cancer. The doors of the hospital opened and closed behind
him. A doctor in a blue scrub suit stepped through the curtains and ran
her hands up and down his neck. He had blood tests and X-rays in rapid
succession, followed by CT scans and more examinations. The scans
revealed that the lump in the neck was merely the tip of a much deeper
iceberg of lumps. Beneath that sentinel mass, a chain of masses coiled
from his neck down into his chest, culminating in a fist-size tumor just
behind his sternum. Large masses located in the anterior chest, as
medical students learn, come in four T’s, almost like a macabre nursery
rhyme for cancer: thyroid cancer, thymoma, teratoma, and terrible
lymphoma. Orman’s problem—given his age and the matted, dense appearance
of the lumps—was almost certainly the last of these, a lymphoma—cancer
of the lymph glands.</p>
<p>I saw Ben Orman nearly two months after that visit to the hospital.
He was sitting in the waiting room, reading a book (he read fiercely,
athletically, almost competitively, often finishing one novel a week, as
if in a race). In the eight weeks since his ER visit, he had undergone a
PET scan, a visit with a surgeon, and a biopsy of the neck lump. As
suspected, the mass was a lymphoma, a relatively rare variant called
Hodgkin’s disease.</p>
<p>More news followed: the scans revealed that Orman’s cancer was
confined entirely to one side of his upper torso. And he had none of the
ghostly B symptoms—weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats—that
occasionally accompany Hodgkin’s disease. In a staging system that ran
from I to IV (with an A or B added to denote the absence or presence of
the occult symptoms), he fell into stage IIA—relatively early in the
progression of the disease. It was somber news, but of all the patients
shuttling in and out of the waiting room that morning, Orman arguably
carried the most benign prognosis. With an intensive course of
chemotherapy, it was more than likely—85 percent likely—that he would be
cured.</p>
<p>“By intensive,” I told him, “I mean several months, perhaps even
stretching out to half a year. The drugs will be given in cycles, and
there will have to be visits in between to check blood counts.” Every
three weeks, just as his counts recovered, the whole cycle would begin
all over again—Sisyphus on chemotherapy.</p>
<p>He would lose his hair with the first cycle. He would almost
certainly become permanently infertile. There might be life-threatening
infections during the times when his white counts would bottom out
nearly to zero. Most ominously, the chemo might cause a second cancer in
the future. He nodded. I watched the thought pick up velocity in his
brain, until it had reached its full impact.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a long haul. A marathon,” I stammered
apologetically, groping for an analogy. “But we’ll get to the end.”</p>
<p>He nodded again silently, as if he already knew.</p>
<p>On a Wednesday morning, not long after my meeting with Orman, I took
a shuttle across Boston to see my patients at the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. Most of us called the institute simply “the Farber.” Large
already in life, Sidney Farber had become even larger in death: the
eponymous Farber was now a sprawling sixteen-story labyrinth of concrete
crammed full of scientists and physicians, a comprehensive
lab-cum-clinic-cum-pharmacy-cum-chemotherapy-unit. There were 2,934
employees, dozens of conference rooms, scores of laboratories, a laundry
unit, four banks of elevators, and multiple libraries. The site of the
original basement lab had long been dwarfed by the massive complex of
buildings around it. Like a vast, overbuilt, and overwrought medieval
temple, the Farber had long swallowed its shrine.</p>
<p>As you entered the new building, an oil painting of the man
himself—with his characteristic half-scowling, half-smiling face—stared
back at you in the foyer. Little bits and pieces of him, it seemed, were
strewn everywhere. The corridor on the way to the fellows’ office was
still hung with the cartoonish “portraits” that he had once commissioned
for the Jimmy Fund: Snow White, Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Dumbo. The
bone marrow needles with which we performed our biopsies looked and felt
as if they came from another age; perhaps they had been sharpened by
Farber or one of his trainees fifty years ago. Wandering through these
labs and clinics, you often felt as if you could stumble onto cancer
history at any minute. One morning I did: bolting to catch the elevator,
I ran headlong into an old man in a wheelchair whom I first took to be a
patient. It was Tom Frei, a professor emeritus now, heading up to his
office on the sixteenth floor.</p>
<p>My patient that Wednesday morning was a seventy-six-year-old woman
named Beatrice Sorenson. Bea, as she liked to be called, reminded me of
one of those tiny insects or animals that you read about in
natural-history textbooks that can carry ten times their weight or leap
five times their height. She was almost preternaturally minuscule: about
eighty-five pounds and four and a half feet tall, with birdlike features
and delicate bones that seemed to hang together like twigs in winter. To
this diminutive frame, however, she brought a fierce force of
personality, the lightness of body counterbalanced by the heftiness of
soul. She had been a marine and served in two wars. Even as I towered
over her on the examination table, I felt awkward and humbled, as if she
were towering over me in spirit.</p>
<p>Sorenson had pancreatic cancer. The tumor had been discovered almost
accidentally in the late summer of 2003, when she had had a bout of
abdominal pain and diarrhea and a CT scan had picked up a
four-centimeter solid nodule hanging off the tail of her pancreas. (In
retrospect, the diarrhea may have been unrelated.) A brave surgeon had
attempted to resect it, but the margins of the resection still contained
some tumor cells. Even in oncology, a dismal discipline to begin with,
this—unresected pancreatic cancer—was considered the epitome of the
dismal.</p>
<p>Sorenson’s life had turned upside down. “I want to beat it to the
end,” she had told me at first. We had tried. Through the early fall, we
blasted her pancreas with radiation to kill the tumor cells, then
followed with chemotherapy, using the drug 5-fluorouracil. The tumor had
grown right through all the treatments. In the winter, we had switched
to a new drug called gemcitabine, or Gemzar. The tumor cells had
shrugged the new drug off—instead mockingly sending a shower of painful
metastases into her liver. At times, it felt as if we would have been
better off with no drugs at all.</p>
<p>Sorenson was at the clinic that morning to see if we could offer
anything else. She wore white pants and a white shirt. Her paper-thin
skin was marked with dry lines. She may have been crying, but her face
was a cipher that I could not read.</p>
<p>“She will try anything, anything,” her husband pleaded. “She is
stronger than she looks.”</p>
<p>But strong or not, there was nothing left to try. I stared down at my
feet, unable to confront the obvious questions. The attending physician
shifted uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
<p>Beatrice finally broke the awkward silence. “I’m sorry.” She shrugged
her shoulders and looked vacantly past us. “I know we have reached an
end.”</p>
<p>We hung our heads, ashamed. It was, I suspected, not the first time
that a patient had consoled a doctor about the ineffectuality of his
discipline.</p>
<p>Two lumps seen on two different mornings. Two vastly different
incarnations of cancer: one almost certainly curable, the second, an
inevitable spiral into death. It felt—nearly twenty-five hundred years
after Hippocrates had naively coined the overarching term karkinos—that
modern oncology was hardly any more sophisticated in its taxonomy of
cancer. Orman’s lymphoma and Sorenson’s pancreatic cancer were both, of
course, “cancers,” malignant proliferations of cells. But the diseases
could not have been further apart in their trajectories and
personalities. Even referring to them by the same name, cancer, felt
like some sort of medical anachronism, like the medieval habit of using
apoplexy to describe anything from a stroke to a hemorrhage to a
seizure. Like Hippocrates, it was as if we, too, had naively lumped the
lumps.</p>
<p>But naive or not, it was this lumping—this emphatic, unshakable faith
in the underlying singularity of cancer more than its pluralities—that
galvanized the Laskerites in the 1960s. Oncology was on a quest for
cohesive truths—a “universal cure,” as Farber put it in 1962. And if the
oncologists of the 1960s imagined a common cure for all forms of cancer,
it was because they imagined a common disease called cancer. Curing one
form, the belief ran, would inevitably lead to the cure of another, and
so forth like a chain reaction, until the whole malignant edifice had
crumbled like a set of dominoes.</p>
<p>That assumption—that a monolithic hammer would eventually demolish a
monolithic disease—surcharged physicians, scientists, and cancer
lobbyists with vitality and energy. For the Laskerites, it was an
organizing principle, a matter of faith, the only certain beacon toward
which they all gravitated. Indeed, the political consolidation of cancer
that the Laskerites sought in Washington (a single institute, a single
source of funds, led by a single physician or scientist) relied on a
deeper notion of a medical consolidation of cancer into a single
disease, a monolith, a single, central narrative. Without this grand,
embracing narrative, neither Mary Lasker nor Sidney Farber could have
envisioned a systematic, targeted war.</p>
<p>The illness that had brought Ben Orman to the clinic late that
evening, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, was itself announced late to the world of
cancer. Its discoverer, Thomas Hodgkin, was a thin, short,
nineteenth-century English anatomist with a spadelike beard and an
astonishingly curved nose—a character who might have walked out of an
Edward Lear poem. Hodgkin was born in 1798 to a Quaker family in
Pentonville, a small hamlet outside London. A precocious child, he grew
quickly into an even more precocious young man, whose interests loped
freely from geology to mathematics to chemistry. He apprenticed briefly
as a geologist, then as an apothecary, and finally graduated from the
University of Edinburgh with a degree in medicine.</p>
<p>A chance event enticed Hodgkin into the world of pathological anatomy
and led him toward the disease that would bear his name. In 1825, a
struggle within the faculty of St. Thomas’ and Guy’s hospital in London
broke up the venerable institution into two bickering halves: Guy’s
hospital and its new rival, St. Thomas’. This divorce, like many marital
spats, was almost immediately followed by a vicious argument over the
partition of property. The “property” here was a macabre ensemble—the
precious anatomical collection of the hospital: brains, hearts,
stomachs, and skeletons in pickling jars of formalin that had been
hoarded for use as teaching tools for the hospital’s medical students.
St. Thomas’ hospital refused to part with its precious specimens, so
Guy’s scrambled to cobble together its own anatomical museum. Hodgkin
had just returned from his second visit to Paris, where he had learned
to prepare and dissect cadaveric specimens. He was promptly recruited to
collect specimens for Guy’s new museum. The job’s most inventive
academic perk, perhaps, was his new title: the Curator of the Museum and
the Inspector of the Dead.</p>
<p>Hodgkin proved to be an extraordinary Inspector of the Dead, a
compulsive anatomical curator who hoarded hundreds of samples within a
few years. But collecting specimens was a rather mundane task; Hodgkin’s
particular genius lay in organizing them. He became a librarian as much
as a pathologist; he devised his own systematics for pathology. The
original building that housed his collection has been destroyed. But the
new museum, where Hodgkin’s original specimens are still on display, is
a strange marvel. A four-chambered atrium located deep inside a larger
building, it is an enormous walk-in casket-of-wonders constructed of
wrought iron and glass. You enter a door and ascend a staircase, then
find yourself on the top floor of a series of galleries that cascade
downward. Along every wall are rows of formalin-filled jars: lungs in
one gallery, hearts in another, brains, kidneys, bones, and so forth.
This method of organizing pathological anatomy—by organ system rather
than by date or disease—was a revelation. By thus “inhabiting” the body
conceptually—by climbing in and out of the body at will, often noting
the correlations between organs and systems—Hodgkin found that he could
recognize patterns within patterns instinctually, sometimes without even
consciously registering them.</p>
<p>In the early winter of 1832, Hodgkin announced that he had collected
a series of cadavers, mostly of young men, who possessed a strange
systemic disease. The illness was characterized, as he put it, by “a
peculiar enlargement of lymph glands.” To the undiscerning eye, this
enlargement could easily have been from tuberculosis or syphilis—the
more common sources of glandular swelling at that time. But Hodgkin was
convinced that he had encountered an entirely new disease, an unknown
pathology unique to these young men. He wrote up the case of seven such
cadavers and had his paper, “On Some Morbid Appearances of the Absorbent
Glands and Spleen,” presented to the Medical and Chirurgical
Society.</p>
<p>The story of a compulsive young doctor putting old swellings into new
pathological bottles was received without much enthusiasm. Only eight
members of the society reportedly attended the lecture. They filed out
afterward in silence, not even bothering to record their names on the
dusty attendance roster.</p>
<p>Hodgkin, too, was a little embarrassed by his discovery. “A
pathological paper may perhaps be thought of little value if
unaccompanied by suggestions designed to assist in the treatment, either
curative or palliative,” he wrote. Merely describing an illness, without
offering any therapeutic suggestions, seemed like an empty academic
exercise to him, a form of intellectual frittering. Soon after
publishing his paper, he began to drift away from medicine altogether.
In 1837, after a rather vicious political spat with his superiors, he
resigned his post at Guy’s. He had a brief stint at St. Thomas’ hospital
as its curator—a rebound affair that was doomed to fail. In 1844, he
gave up his academic practice altogether. His anatomical studies slowly
came to a halt.</p>
<p>In 1898, some thirty years after Hodgkin’s death, an Austrian
pathologist, Carl Sternberg, was looking through a microscope at a
patient’s glands when he found a peculiar series of cells staring back
at him: giant, disorganized cells with cleaved, bilobed nuclei—“owl’s
eyes,” as he described them, glaring sullenly out from the forests of
lymph. Hodgkin’s anatomy had reached its final cellular resolution.
These owl’s-eye cells were malignant lymphocytes, lymph cells that had
turned cancerous. Hodgkin’s disease was a cancer of the lymph glands—a
lymphoma.</p>
<p>Hodgkin may have been disappointed by what he thought was only a
descriptive study of his disease. But he had underestimated the value of
careful observation—by compulsively studying anatomy alone, he had
stumbled upon the most critical revelation about this form of lymphoma:
Hodgkin’s disease had a peculiar propensity of infiltrating lymph nodes
locally one by one. Other cancers could be more unpredictable—more
“capricious,” as one oncologist put it. Lung cancer, for instance, might
start as a spicular nodule in the lung, then unmoor itself and ambulate
unexpectedly into the brain. Pancreatic cancer was notoriously known to
send sprays of malignant cells into faraway sites such as the bones and
the liver. But Hodgkin’s—an anatomist’s discovery—was anatomically
deferential: it moved, as if with a measured, ordered pace, from one
contiguous node to another—from gland to gland and from region to
region.</p>
<p>It was this propensity to spread locally from one node to the next
that poised Hodgkin’s uniquely in the history of cancer. Hodgkin’s
disease was yet another hybrid among malignant diseases. If Farber’s
leukemia had occupied the hazy border between liquid and solid tumors,
then Hodgkin’s disease inhabited yet another strange borderland: a local
disease on the verge of transforming into a systemic one—Halsted’s
vision of cancer on its way to becoming Galen’s.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, at a cocktail party in California, Henry Kaplan,
a professor of radiology at Stanford, overheard a conversation about the
plan to build a linear accelerator for use by physicists at Stanford. A
linear accelerator is an X-ray tube taken to an extreme form. Like a
conventional X-ray tube, a linear accelerator also fires electrons onto
a target to generate high-intensity X-rays. Unlike a conventional tube,
however, the “linac” imbues massive amounts of energy into the
electrons, pushing them to dizzying velocities before smashing them
against the metal surface. The X-rays that emerge from this are deeply
penetrating—powerful enough not only to pass through tissue, but to
scald cells to death.</p>
<p>Kaplan had trained at the NCI, where he had learned to use X-rays to
treat leukemia in animals, but his interest had gradually shifted to
solid tumors in humans—lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphomas. Solid
tumors could be treated with radiation, he knew, but the outer shell of
the cancer, like its eponymous crab’s carapace, needed to be penetrated
deeply to kill cancer cells. A linear accelerator with its sharp, dense,
knifelike beam might allow him to reach tumor cells buried deep inside
tissues. In 1953, he persuaded a team of physicists and engineers at
Stanford to tailor-make an accelerator exclusively for the hospital. The
accelerator was installed in a vaultlike warehouse in San Francisco in
1956. Dodging traffic between Fillmore Street and Mission Hill, Kaplan
personally wheeled in its colossal block of lead shielding on an
automobile jack borrowed from a neighboring garage owner.</p>
<p>Through a minuscule pinhole in that lead block, he could now direct
tiny, controlled doses of a furiously potent beam of X-rays—millions of
electron volts of energy in concentrated bursts—to lancinate any cancer
cell to death. But what form of cancer? If Kaplan had learned one lesson
at the NCI, it was that by focusing microscopically on a single disease,
one could extrapolate into the entire universe of diseases. The
characteristics that Kaplan sought in his target were relatively well
defined. Since the linac could only focus its killer beam on local
sites, it would have to be a local, not a systemic, cancer. Leukemia was
out of the question. Breast and lung cancer were important targets, but
both were unpredictable, mercurial diseases, with propensities for
occult and systemic spread. The powerful oculus of Kaplan’s intellect,
swiveling about through the malignant world, ultimately landed on the
most natural target for his investigation: Hodgkin’s disease.</p>
<p>“Henry Kaplan was Hodgkin’s disease,” George Canellos, a former
senior clinician at the NCI told me, leaning back in his chair. We were
sitting in his office while he rummaged through piles of manuscripts,
monographs, articles, books, catalogs, and papers, pulling out
occasional pictures of Kaplan from his files. Here was Kaplan, dressed
in a bow tie, looking at sheaves of papers at the NCI. Or Kaplan in a
white coat standing next to the linac at Stanford, its 5-million-volt
probe just inches from his nose.</p>
<p>Kaplan wasn’t the first doctor to treat Hodgkin’s with X-rays, but he
was certainly the most dogged, the most methodical, and the most
single-minded. In the mid-1930s, a Swiss radiologist named Rene Gilbert
had shown that the swollen lymph nodes of Hodgkin’s disease could
effectively and dramatically be reduced with radiation. But Gilbert’s
patients had typically relapsed after treatment, often in the lymph
nodes immediately contiguous to the original radiated area. At the
Toronto General Hospital, a Canadian surgeon named Vera Peters had
furthered Gilbert’s studies by broadening the radiation field even
farther—delivering X-rays not to a single swollen node, but to an entire
area of lymph nodes. Peters called her strategy “extended field
radiation.” In 1958, analyzing the cohort of patients that she had
treated, Peters observed that broad-field radiation could significantly
improve long-term survival for early-stage Hodgkin’s patients. But
Peters’s data was retrospective—based on the historical analysis of
prior-treated patients. What Peters needed was a more rigorous medical
experiment, a randomized clinical trial. (Historical series can be
biased by doctors’ highly selective choices of patients for therapy, or
by their counting only the ones that do the best.)</p>
<p>Independently of Peters, Kaplan had also realized that extended field
radiation could improve relapse-free survival, perhaps even cure
early-stage Hodgkin’s disease. But he lacked formal proof. In 1962,
challenged by one of his students, Henry Kaplan set out to prove the
point.</p>
<p>The trials that Kaplan designed still rank among the classics of
study design. In the first set, called the L1 trials, he assigned equal
numbers of patients to either extended field radiation or to limited
“involved field” radiation and plotted relapse-free survival curves. The
answer was definitive. Extended field radiation—“meticulous
radiotherapy” as one doctor described it—drastically diminished the
relapse rate of Hodgkin’s disease.</p>
<p>But Kaplan knew that a diminished relapse rate was not a cure. So he
delved further. Two years later, the Stanford team carved out a larger
field of radiation, involving nodes around the aorta, the large
arch-shaped blood vessel that leads out of the heart. Here they
introduced an innovation that would prove pivotal to their success.
Kaplan knew that only patients that had localized Hodgkin’s disease
could possibly benefit from radiation therapy. To truly test the
efficacy of radiation therapy, then, Kaplan realized that he would need
a strictly limited cohort of patients whose Hodgkin’s disease involved
just a few contiguous lymph nodes. To exclude patients with more
disseminated forms of lymphoma, Kaplan devised an intense battery of
tests to stage his patients. There were blood tests, a detailed clinical
exam, a procedure called lymphangiography (a primitive ancestor of a CT
scan for the lymph nodes), and a bone marrow biopsy. Even so, Kaplan was
unsatisfied: doubly careful, he began to perform exploratory abdominal
surgery and biopsy internal nodes to ensure that only patients with
locally confined disease were entering his trials.</p>
<p>The doses of radiation were now daringly high. But gratifyingly, the
responses soared as well. Kaplan documented even greater relapse-free
intervals, now stretching out into dozens of months—then years. When the
first batch of patients had survived five years without relapses, he
began to speculate that some may have been cured by extended field
X-rays. Kaplan’s experimental idea had finally made its way out of a San
Francisco warehouse into the mainstream clinical world.</p>
<p>But hadn’t Halsted wagered on the same horse and lost? Hadn’t radical
surgery become entangled in the same logic—carving out larger and larger
areas for treatment—and then spiraled downward? Why did Kaplan succeed
where others had failed?</p>
<p>First, because Kaplan meticulously restricted radiotherapy to
patients with early-stage disease. He went to exhaustive lengths to
stage patients before unleashing radiation on them. By strictly
narrowing the group of patients treated, Kaplan markedly increased the
likelihood of his success.</p>
<p>And second, he succeeded because he had picked the right disease.
Hodgkin’s was, for the most part, a regional illness. “Fundamental to
all attempts at curative treatment of Hodgkin’s disease,” one reviewer
commented memorably in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1968, “is
the assumption that in the significant fraction of cases, [the disease]
is localized.” Kaplan treated the intrinsic biology of Hodgkin’s disease
with utmost seriousness. If Hodgkin’s lymphoma had been more capricious
in its movement through the body (and occult areas of spread more
common, as in some forms of breast cancer), then Kaplan’s staging
strategy, for all his excruciatingly detailed workups, would inherently
have been doomed to fail. Instead of trying to tailor the disease to fit
his medicine, Kaplan learned to tailor his medicine to fit the right
disease.</p>
<p>This simple principle—the meticulous matching of a particular therapy
to a particular form and stage of cancer—would eventually be given its
due merit in cancer therapy. Early-stage, local cancers, Kaplan
realized, were often inherently different from widely spread, metastatic
cancers—even within the same form of cancer. A hundred instances of
Hodgkin’s disease, even though pathologically classified as the same
entity, were a hundred variants around a common theme. Cancers possessed
temperaments, personalities—behaviors. And biological heterogeneity
demanded therapeutic heterogeneity; the same treatment could not
indiscriminately be applied to all. But even if Kaplan understood it
fully in 1963 and made an example of it in treating Hodgkin’s disease,
it would take decades for a generation of oncologists to come to the
same realization.</p>
