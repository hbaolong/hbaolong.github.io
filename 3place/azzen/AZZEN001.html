<h1 id="a-biography-of-all-cancer---the-emperor-of-maladies">A Biography
of All Cancer - The Emperor of Maladies</h1>
<p>In 2010, about six hundred thousand Americans, and more than 7
million humans around the world, will die of cancer. In the United
States, one in three women and one in two men will develop cancer during
their lifetime. A quarter of all American deaths, and about 15 percent
of all deaths worldwide, will be attributed to cancer. In some nations,
cancer will surpass heart disease to become the most common cause of
death.</p>
<p>Author’s Note</p>
<p>This book is a history of cancer. It is a chronicle of an ancient
disease—once a clandestine, “whispered-about” illness—that has
metamorphosed into a lethal shape-shifting entity imbued with such
penetrating metaphorical, medical, scientific, and political potency
that cancer is often described as the defining plague of our generation.
This book is a “biography” in the truest sense of the word—an attempt to
enter the mind of this immortal illness, to understand its personality,
to demystify its behavior. But my ultimate aim is to raise a question
beyond biography: Is cancer’s end conceivable in the future? Is it
possible to eradicate this disease from our bodies and societies
forever?</p>
<p>The project, evidently vast, began as a more modest enterprise. In
the summer of 2003, having completed a residency in medicine and
graduate work in cancer immunology, I began advanced training in cancer
medicine (medical oncology) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. I had initially envisioned
writing a journal of that year—a view-from-the-trenches of cancer
treatment. But that quest soon grew into a larger exploratory journey
that carried me into the depths not only of science and medicine, but of
culture, history, literature, and politics, into cancer’s past and into
its future.</p>
<p>Two characters stand at the epicenter of this story—both
contemporaries, both idealists, both children of the boom in postwar
science and technology in America, and both caught in the swirl of a
hypnotic, obsessive quest to launch a national “War on Cancer.” The
first is Sidney Farber, the father of modern chemotherapy, who
accidentally discovers a powerful anti-cancer chemical in a vitamin
analogue and begins to dream of a universal cure for cancer. The second
is Mary Lasker, the Manhattan socialite of legendary social and
political energy, who joins Farber in his decades-long journey. But
Lasker and Farber only exemplify the grit, imagination, inventiveness,
and optimism of generations of men and women who have waged a battle
against cancer for four thousand years. In a sense, this is a military
history—one in which the adversary is formless, timeless, and pervasive.
Here, too, there are victories and losses, campaigns upon campaigns,
heroes and hubris, survival and resilience—and inevitably, the wounded,
the condemned, the forgotten, the dead. In the end, cancer truly
emerges, as a nineteenth-century surgeon once wrote in a book’s
frontispiece, as “the emperor of all maladies, the king of terrors.”</p>
<p>A disclaimer: in science and medicine, where the primacy of a
discovery carries supreme weight, the mantle of inventor or discoverer
is assigned by a community of scientists and researchers. Although there
are many stories of discovery and invention in this book, none of these
establishes any legal claims of primacy.</p>
<p>This work rests heavily on the shoulders of other books, studies,
journal articles, memoirs, and interviews. It rests also on the vast
contributions of individuals, libraries, collections, archives, and
papers acknowledged at the end of the book.</p>
<p>One acknowledgment, though, cannot be left to the end. This book is
not just a journey into the past of cancer, but also a personal journey
of my coming-of-age as an oncologist. That second journey would be
impossible without patients, who, above and beyond all contributors,
continued to teach and inspire me as I wrote. It is in their debt that I
stand forever.</p>
<p>This debt comes with dues. The stories in this book present an
important challenge in maintaining the privacy and dignity of these
patients. In cases where the knowledge of the illness was already public
(as with prior interviews or articles) I have used real names. In cases
where there was no prior public knowledge, or when interviewees
requested privacy, I have used a false name, and deliberately confounded
identities to make it difficult to track them. However, these are real
patients and real encounters. I urge all my readers to respect their
identities and boundaries.</p>
