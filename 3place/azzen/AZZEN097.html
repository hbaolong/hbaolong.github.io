<h4 id="glossary">Glossary</h4>
<p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a variant of white blood cell cancer
that affects the lymphoid lineage of blood cells.</p>
<p>Acute myeloid leukemia: a variant of white blood cell cancer that
affects the myeloid lineage of blood cells.</p>
<p>Apoptosis: the regulated process of cell death that occurs in most
cells, involving specific cascades of genes and proteins.</p>
<p>Carcinogen: a cancer-causing or cancer-inciting agent.</p>
<p>Chimeric gene: A gene created by the mixing together of two genes. A
chimeric gene might be the product of a natural translocation, or might
be engineered in the lab.</p>
<p>Chromosome: a structure within a cell comprised of DNA and proteins
that stores genetic information.</p>
<p>Cytotoxic: Cell-killing. Usually refers to chemotherapy that works by
killing cells, particularly rapidly dividing cells.</p>
<p>DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, a chemical that carries genetic
information in all cellular organisms. It is usually present in the cell
as two paired, complementary strands. Each strand is a chemical chain
made up of four chemical units—abbreviated A, C, T, and G. Genes are
carried in the form of a genetic “code” in the strand and the sequence
is converted (transcribed) into RNA (see p. 534) and then translated
into proteins (see p.534).</p>
<p>Enzyme: a protein that accelerates a biochemical reaction.</p>
<p>Gene: a unit of inheritance, normally comprised of a stretch of DNA
that codes for a protein or for an RNA chain (in special cases, genes
might be carried in the RNA form).</p>
<p>Genetic engineering: the capacity to manipulate genes in organisms to
create new genes, or introduce genes into heterologous organisms (e.g.,
a human gene in a bacterial cell).</p>
<p>Genome: the full complement of all genes within the organism.</p>
<p>Incidence: In epidemiology, the number (or fraction) of patients who
are diagnosed with a disease in a given period of time. It differs from
prevalence because incidence reflects the rate of new diagnosis.</p>
<p>Kinase: a protein enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to other
proteins.</p>
<p>Metastatic: cancer that has spread beyond its local site of
origin.</p>
<p>Mitosis: the division of one cell to form two cells that occurs in
most adult tissues of the body (as opposed to meiosis, which generates
germ cells in the ovary and the testes).</p>
<p>Mutation: An alteration in the chemical structure of DNA. Mutations
can be silent—i.e., the change might not affect any function of the
organism—or can result in a change in the function or structure of an
organism.</p>
<p>Neoplasm, neoplasia: an alternative name for cancer.</p>
<p>Oncogene: A cancer-causing or cancer-promoting gene. Activation or
overexpression of a proto-oncogene (see below) promotes the
transformation of a cell from normal to a cancer cell.</p>
<p>Prevalence: in epidemiology, the number (or fraction) of affected
patients in any given period of time.</p>
<p>Primary prevention: prevention aimed at avoiding the development of a
disease, typically by attacking the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>Prospective trial: a trial in which a cohort of patients is followed
forward in time (as opposed to retrospective, in which a cohort of
patients is followed backward).</p>
<p>Protein: A chemical comprised, at its core, of a chain of amino acids
that is created when a gene is translated. Proteins carry out the bulk
of cellular functions, including relaying signals, providing structural
support, and accelerating biochemical reactions. Genes usually “work” by
providing the blueprint for proteins (see DNA, p. 533). Proteins can be
modified chemically by the addition of small chemicals such as
phosphates or sugars or lipids.</p>
<p>Proto-oncogene: A precursor to an oncogene. Typically,
proto-oncogenes are normal cellular genes that, when activated by
mutation or overexpression, promote cancer. Proto-oncogenes typically
code for proteins that are associated with cell growth and
differentiation. Examples of proto-oncogenes include ras and myc.</p>
<p>Randomized trial: a trial in which treatment and control groups are
randomly assigned.</p>
<p>Retrovirus: an RNA virus that keeps its genes in the form of RNA and
is capable, by virtue of an enzyme, reverse transcriptase, to convert
its genes from the RNA form into a DNA form.</p>
<p>Reverse transcriptase: An enzyme that converts a chain of RNA into a
chain of DNA. Reverse transcription is a property of retroviruses.</p>
<p>RNA: Ribonucleic acid, a chemical that performs several functions in
the cells, including acting as an “intermediate” message for a gene to
become a protein. Certain viruses also use RNA, not DNA, to maintain
their genes (see Retrovirus, above).</p>
<p>Secondary prevention: Prevention strategies that are aimed at early
detection of a disease, typically by screening asymptomatic men and
women. Typically, secondary prevention strategies attack early,
pre-symptomatic stages of the disease.</p>
<p>Transfection: the introduction of DNA into a cell.</p>
<p>Transgenic mice: mice in which a genetic change has been artificially
introduced.</p>
<p>Translocation (of a gene): the physical reattachment of a gene from
one chromosome to another.</p>
<p>Tumor suppressor gene (also called anti-oncogene): A gene that, when
inactivated fully, promotes the progression of a cell into a cancer
cell. Tumor suppressors usually protect a cell from one step on the
progression toward cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or
reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer. Typically,
this occurs in combination with other genetic changes.</p>
<p>Two-hit hypothesis: the notion that for tumor suppressor genes, both
functionally intact copies of the gene must be inactivated in order for
a cell to progress toward cancer.</p>
<p>Virus: A microorganism that is incapable of reproducing by itself,
but capable of creating progeny once it has infected a cell. Viruses
come in diverse forms, including DNA viruses and RNA viruses. Viruses
possess a core of either DNA or RNA, coated with proteins, and can be
bound by an outer membrane made of lipids and proteins.</p>
