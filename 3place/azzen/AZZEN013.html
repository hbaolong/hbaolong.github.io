<h4 id="the-goodness-of-show-business">The Goodness of Show
Business</h4>
<p>The name “Jimmy” is a household word in New England . . . a nickname
for the boy next door.</p>
<p>—The House That “Jimmy” Built</p>
<p>I’ve made a long voyage and been to a strange country, and I’ve seen
the dark man very close.</p>
<p>—Thomas Wolfe</p>
<p>Flickering and feeble, the leukemia remissions in Boston and New York
nevertheless mesmerized Farber. If lymphoblastic leukemia, one of the
most lethal forms of cancer, could be thwarted by two distinct chemicals
(even if only for a month or two), then perhaps a deeper principle was
at stake. Perhaps a series of such poisons was hidden in the chemical
world, perfectly designed to obliterate cancer cells but spare normal
cells. The fingerling of that idea kept knocking in his mind as he paced
up and down the wards every evening, writing notes and examining smears
late into the night. Perhaps he had stumbled upon an even more
provocative principle—that cancer could be cured by chemicals alone.</p>
<p>But how might he jump-start the discovery of these incredible
chemicals? His operation in Boston was clearly far too small. How might
he create a more powerful platform to propel him toward the cure for
childhood leukemia—and then for cancer at large?</p>
<p>Scientists often study the past as obsessively as historians because
few other professions depend so acutely on it. Every experiment is a
conversation with a prior experiment, every new theory a refutation of
the old. Farber, too, studied the past compulsively—and the episode that
pivotally fascinated him was the story of the national polio campaign.
As a student at Harvard in the 1920s, Farber had witnessed polio
epidemics sweeping through the city, leaving waves of paralyzed children
in their wake. In the acute phase of polio, the virus can paralyze the
diaphragm, making it nearly impossible to breathe. Even a decade later,
in the mid-1930s, the only treatment available for this paralysis was an
artificial respirator known as the iron lung. As Farber had rounded on
the wards of Children’s Hospital as a resident, iron lungs had
continuously huffed in the background, with children suspended within
these dreaded contraptions often for weeks on end. The suspension of
patients inside these iron lungs symbolized the limbolike, paralytic
state of polio research. Little was known about the nature of the virus
or the biology of the infection, and campaigns to control the spread of
polio were poorly advertised and generally ignored by the public.</p>
<p>Polio research was shaken out of its torpor by Franklin Roosevelt in
1937. A victim of a prior epidemic, paralyzed from the waist down,
Roosevelt had launched a polio hospital and research center, called the
Warm Springs Foundation, in Georgia in 1927. At first, his political
advisers tried to distance his image from the disease. (A paralyzed
president trying to march a nation out of a depression was considered a
disastrous image; Roosevelt’s public appearances were thus elaborately
orchestrated to show him only from the waist up.) But reelected by a
staggering margin in 1936, a defiant and resurgent Roosevelt returned to
his original cause and launched the National Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis, an advocacy group to advance research on and publicize
polio.</p>
<p>The foundation, the largest disease-focused association in American
history, galvanized polio research. Within one year of its launch, the
actor Eddie Cantor created the March of Dimes campaign for the
foundation—a massive and highly coordinated national fund-raising effort
that asked every citizen to send Roosevelt a dime to support polio
education and research. Hollywood celebrities, Broadway stars, and radio
personalities soon joined the bandwagon, and the response was dazzling.
Within a few weeks, 2,680,000 dimes had poured into the White House.
Posters were widely circulated, and money and public attention flooded
into polio research. By the late 1940s, funded in part by these
campaigns, John Enders had nearly succeeded in culturing poliovirus in
his lab, and Sabin and Salk, building on Enders’s work, were well on
their way to preparing the first polio vaccines.</p>
<p>Farber fantasized about a similar campaign for leukemia, perhaps for
cancer in general. He envisioned a foundation for children’s cancer that
would spearhead the effort. But he needed an ally to help launch the
foundation, preferably an ally outside the hospital, where he had few
allies.</p>
<p>Farber did not need to look far. In early May 1947, while Farber was
still in the middle of his aminopterin trial, a group of men from the
Variety Club of New England, led by Bill Koster, toured his
laboratory.</p>
<p>Founded in 1927 in Philadelphia by a group of men in show
business—producers, directors, actors, entertainers, and film-theater
owners—the Variety Club had initially been modeled after the dining
clubs of New York and London. But in 1928, just a year after its
inception, the club had unwittingly acquired a more active social
agenda. In the winter of 1928, with the city teetering on the abyss of
the Depression, a woman had abandoned her child at the doorstep of the
Sheridan Square Film Theater. A note pinned on the child read:</p>
<p>Please take care of my baby. Her name is Catherine. I can no longer
take care of her. I have eight others. My husband is out of work. She
was born on Thanksgiving Day. I have always heard of the goodness of
show business and I pray to God that you will look out for her.</p>
<p>The cinematic melodrama of the episode, and the heartfelt appeal to
the “goodness of show business,” made a deep impression on the members
of the fledgling club. Adopting the orphan girl, the club paid for her
upbringing and education. She was given the name Catherine Variety
Sheridan—her middle name for the club and her last name for the theater
outside which she had been found.</p>
<p>The Catherine Sheridan story was widely reported in the press and
brought more media exposure to the club than its members had ever
envisioned. Thrust into the public eye as a philanthropic organization,
the club now made children’s welfare its project. In the late 1940s, as
the boom in postwar moviemaking brought even more money into the club’s
coffers, new chapters of the club sprouted in cities throughout the
nation. Catherine Sheridan’s story and her photograph were printed and
publicized in club offices throughout the nation. Sheridan became the
club’s unofficial mascot.</p>
<p>The influx of money and public attention also brought a search for
other children’s charity projects. Koster’s visit to the Children’s
Hospital in Boston was a scouting mission to find another such project.
He was escorted around the hospital to the labs and clinics of prominent
doctors. When Koster asked the chief of hematology at Children’s for
suggestions for donations to the hospital, the chief was
characteristically cautious: “Well, I need a new microscope,” he
said.</p>
<p>In contrast, when Koster stopped by Farber’s office, he found an
excitable, articulate scientist with a larger-than-life vision—a messiah
in a box. Farber didn’t want a microscope; he had an audacious
telescopic plan that captivated Koster. Farber asked the club to help
him create a new fund to build a massive research hospital dedicated to
children’s cancer.</p>
<p>Farber and Koster got started immediately. In early 1948, they
launched an organization called the Children’s Cancer Research Fund to
jump-start research and advocacy around children’s cancers. In March
1948, they organized a raffle to raise money and netted 5,456—an
impressive amount to start, but still short of what Farber and Koster
hoped for. Cancer research, they felt, needed a more effective message,
a strategy to catapult it into public fame. Sometime that spring,
Koster, remembering the success with Sheridan, had the inspired idea of
finding a “mascot” for Farber’s research fund—a Catherine Sheridan for
cancer. Koster and Farber searched Children’s wards and Farber’s clinic
for a poster child to pitch the fund to the public.</p>
<p>It was not a promising quest. Farber was treating several children
with aminopterin, and the beds in the wards upstairs were filled with
miserable patients—dehydrated and nauseated from chemotherapy, children
barely able to hold their heads and bodies upright, let alone be paraded
publicly as optimistic mascots for cancer treatment. Looking frantically
through the patient lists, Farber and Koster found a single child
healthy enough to carry the message—a lanky, cherubic, blue-eyed, blond
child named Einar Gustafson, who did not have leukemia but was being
treated for a rare kind of lymphoma in his intestines.</p>
<p>Gustafson was quiet and serious, a precociously self-assured boy from
New Sweden, Maine. His grandparents were Swedish immigrants, and he
lived on a potato farm and attended a single-room schoolhouse. In the
late summer of 1947, just after blueberry season, he had complained of a
gnawing, wrenching pain in his stomach. Doctors in Lewiston, suspecting
appendicitis, had operated on his appendix, but found the lymphoma
instead. Survival rates for the disease were low at 10 percent. Thinking
that chemotherapy had a slight chance to save him, his doctors sent
Gustafson to Farber’s care in Boston.</p>
<p>Einar Gustafson, though, was a mouthful of a name. Farber and Koster,
in a flash of inspiration, rechristened him Jimmy.</p>
<p>Koster now moved quickly to market Jimmy. On May 22, 1948, on a warm
Saturday night in the Northeast, Ralph Edwards, the host of the radio
show Truth or Consequences, interrupted his usual broadcast from
California and linked to a radio station in Boston. “Part of the
function of Truth or Consequences,” Edwards began, “is to bring this old
parlor game to people who are unable to come to the show. . . . Tonight
we take you to a little fellow named Jimmy.</p>
<p>“We are not going to give you his last name because he’s just like
thousands of other young fellows and girls in private homes and
hospitals all over the country. Jimmy is suffering from cancer. He’s a
swell little guy, and although he cannot figure out why he isn’t out
with the other kids, he does love his baseball and follows every move of
his favorite team, the Boston Braves. Now, by the magic of radio, we’re
going to span the breadth of the United States and take you right up to
the bedside of Jimmy, in one of America’s great cities, Boston,
Massachusetts, and into one of America’s great hospitals, the Children’s
Hospital in Boston, whose staff is doing such an outstanding job of
cancer research. Up to now, Jimmy has not heard us. . . . Give us Jimmy
please.”</p>
<p>Then, over a crackle of static, Jimmy could be heard.</p>
<p>Jimmy: Hi.</p>
<p>Edwards: Hi, Jimmy! This is Ralph Edwards of the Truth or
Consequences radio program. I’ve heard you like baseball. Is that
right?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Yeah, it’s my favorite sport.</p>
<p>Edwards: It’s your favorite sport! Who do you think is going to win
the pennant this year?</p>
<p>Jimmy: The Boston Braves, I hope.</p>
<p>After more banter, Edwards sprung the “parlor trick” that he had
promised.</p>
<p>Edwards: Have you ever met Phil Masi?</p>
<p>Jimmy: No.</p>
<p>Phil Masi (walking in): Hi, Jimmy. My name is Phil Masi.</p>
<p>Edwards: What? Who’s that, Jimmy?</p>
<p>Jimmy (gasping): Phil Masi!</p>
<p>Edwards: And where is he?</p>
<p>Jimmy: In my room!</p>
<p>Edwards: Well, what do you know? Right here in your hospital
room—Phil Masi from Berlin, Illinois! Who’s the best home-run hitter on
the team, Jimmy?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Jeff Heath.</p>
<p>(Heath entered the room.)</p>
<p>Edwards: Who’s that, Jimmy?</p>
<p>Jimmy: Jeff . . . Heath.</p>
<p>As Jimmy gasped, player after player filed into his room bearing
T-shirts, signed baseballs, game tickets, and caps: Eddie Stanky, Bob
Elliott, Earl Torgeson, Johnny Sain, Alvin Dark, Jim Russell, Tommy
Holmes. A piano was wheeled in. The Braves struck up the song,
accompanied by Jimmy, who sang loudly and enthusiastically off-key:</p>
<p>Take me out to the ball game,</p>
<p>Take me out with the crowd.</p>
<p>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,</p>
<p>I don’t care if I never get back</p>
<p>The crowd in Edwards’s studio cheered, some noting the poignancy of
the last line, many nearly moved to tears. At the end of the broadcast,
the remote link from Boston was disconnected. Edwards paused and lowered
his voice.</p>
<p>“Now listen, folks. Jimmy can’t hear this, can he? . . . We’re not
using any photographs of him, or using his full name, or he will know
about this. Let’s make Jimmy and thousands of boys and girls who are
suffering from cancer happy by aiding the research to help find a cure
for cancer in children. Because by researching children’s cancer, we
automatically help the adults and stop it at the outset.</p>
<p>“Now we know that one thing little Jimmy wants most is a television
set to watch the baseball games as well as hear them. If you and your
friends send in your quarters, dollars, and tens of dollars tonight to
Jimmy for the Children’s Cancer Research Fund, and over two hundred
thousand dollars is contributed to this worthy cause, we’ll see to it
that Jimmy gets his television set.”</p>
<p>The Edwards broadcast lasted eight minutes. Jimmy spoke twelve
sentences and sang one song. The word swell was used five times. Little
was said of Jimmy’s cancer: it lurked unmentionably in the background,
the ghost in the hospital room. The public response was staggering. Even
before the Braves had left Jimmy’s room that evening, donors had begun
to line up outside the lobby of the Children’s Hospital. Jimmy’s mailbox
was inundated with postcards and letters, some of them addressed simply
to “Jimmy, Boston, Massachusetts.” Some sent dollar bills with their
letters or wrote checks; children mailed in pocket money, in quarters
and dimes. The Braves pitched in with their own contributions. By May
1948, the 0,000 mark set by Koster had long been surpassed; more than
31,000 had rolled in. Hundreds of red-and-white tin cans for donations
for the Jimmy Fund were posted outside baseball games. Cans were passed
around in film theaters to collect dimes and quarters. Little League
players in baseball uniforms went door-to-door with collection cans on
sweltering summer nights. Jimmy Days were held in the small towns
throughout New England. Jimmy’s promised television—a black-and-white
set with a twelve-inch screen set into a wooden box—arrived and was set
up on a white bench between hospital beds.</p>
<p>In the fast-growing, fast-consuming world of medical research in
1948, the 31,000 raised by the Jimmy Fund was an impressive, but still
modest sum—enough to build a few floors of a new building in Boston, but
far from enough to build a national scientific edifice against cancer.
In comparison, in 1944, the Manhattan Project spent 00 million every
month at the Oak Ridge site. In 1948, Americans spent more than 26
million on Coca-Cola alone.</p>
<p>But to measure the genius of the Jimmy campaign in dollars and cents
is to miss its point. For Farber, the Jimmy Fund campaign was an early
experiment—the building of another model. The campaign against cancer,
Farber learned, was much like a political campaign: it needed icons,
mascots, images, slogans—the strategies of advertising as much as the
tools of science. For any illness to rise to political prominence, it
needed to be marketed, just as a political campaign needed marketing. A
disease needed to be transformed politically before it could be
transformed scientifically.</p>
<p>If Farber’s antifolates were his first discovery in oncology, then
this critical truth was his second. It set off a seismic transformation
in his career that would far outstrip his transformation from a
pathologist to a leukemia doctor. This second transformation—from a
clinician into an advocate for cancer research—reflected the
transformation of cancer itself. The emergence of cancer from its
basement into the glaring light of publicity would change the trajectory
of this story. It is a metamorphosis that lies at the heart of this
book.</p>
