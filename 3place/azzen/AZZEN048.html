<h4 id="the-red-queens-race">The Red Queen’s Race</h4>
<p>“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d
generally get to somewhere else—if you ran very fast for a long time, as
we’ve been doing.”</p>
<p>“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it
takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want
to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”</p>
<p>—Lewis Carroll,</p>
<p>Through the Looking-Glass</p>
<p>In August 2000, Jerry Mayfield, a forty-one-year-old Louisiana
policeman diagnosed with CML, began treatment with Gleevec. Mayfield’s
cancer responded briskly at first. The fraction of leukemic cells in his
bone marrow dropped over six months. His blood count normalized and his
symptoms improved; he felt rejuvenated—“like a new man [on] a wonderful
drug.” But the response was short-lived. In the winter of 2003,
Mayfield’s CML stopped responding. Moshe Talpaz, the oncologist treating
Mayfield in Houston, increased the dose of Gleevec, then increased it
again, hoping to outpace the leukemia. But by October of that year,
there was no response. Leukemia cells had fully recolonized his bone
marrow and blood and invaded his spleen. Mayfield’s cancer had become
resistant to targeted therapy.</p>
<p>Now in the fifth year of their Gleevec trial, Talpaz and Sawyers had
seen several cases like Mayfield’s. They were rare. The vast proportion
of CML patients maintained deep, striking remissions on the drug,
requiring no other therapy. But occasionally, a patient’s leukemia
stopped responding to Gleevec, and Gleevec-resistant leukemia cells grew
back. Sawyers, having just entered the world of targeted therapy,
swiftly entered a molecular world beyond targeted therapy: how might a
cancer cell become resistant to a drug that directly inhibits its
driving oncogene?</p>
<p>In the era of nontargeted drugs, cancer cells were known to become
drug-resistant through a variety of ingenious mechanisms. Some cells
acquire mutations that activate molecular pumps. In normal cells, these
pumps extrude natural poisons and waste products from a cell’s interior.
In cancer cells, these activated pumps push chemotherapy drugs out from
the interior of the cell. Spared by chemotherapy, the drug-resistant
cells outgrow other cancer cells. Other cancer cells activate proteins
that destroy or neutralize drugs. Yet other cancers escape drugs by
migrating into reservoirs of the body where drugs cannot penetrate—as in
lymphoblastic leukemia relapsing in the brain.</p>
<p>CML cells, Sawyers discovered, become Gleevec-resistant through an
even wilier mechanism: the cells acquire mutations that specifically
alter the structure of Bcr-abl, creating a protein still able to drive
the growth of the leukemia but no longer capable of binding to the drug.
Normally, Gleevec slips into a narrow, wedgelike cleft in the center of
Bcr-abl—like “an arrow pierced through the center of the protein’s
heart,” as one chemist described it. Gleevec-resistant mutations in
Bcr-abl change the molecular “heart” of the Bcr-abl protein so that the
drug can no longer access the critical cleft in the protein, thus
rendering the drug ineffective. In Mayfield’s case, a single alteration
in the Bcr-abl protein had rendered it fully resistant to Gleevec,
resulting in the sudden relapse of leukemia. To escape targeted therapy,
cancer had changed the target.</p>
<p>To Sawyers, these observations suggested that overcoming Gleevec
resistance with a second-generation drug would require a very different
kind of attack. Increasing the dose of Gleevec, or inventing closely
related molecular variants of the drug, would be useless. Since the
mutations changed the structure of Bcr-abl, a second-generation drug
would need to block the protein through an independent mechanism,
perhaps by gaining another entry point into its crucial central
cleft.</p>
<p>In 2005, working with chemists at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sawyers’s
team generated another kinase inhibitor to target Gleevec-resistant
Bcr-abl. As predicted, this new drug, dasatinib, was not a simple
structural analogue of Gleevec; it accessed Bcr-abl’s “heart” through a
separate molecular crevice on the protein’s surface. When Sawyers and
Talpaz tested dasatinib on Gleevec-resistant patients, the effect was
remarkable: the leukemia cells involuted again. Mayfield’s leukemia,
fully resistant to Gleevec, was forced back into remission in 2005. His
blood count normalized again. Leukemia cells dissipated out of his bone
marrow gradually. In 2009, Mayfield still remains in remission, now on
dasatinib.</p>
<p>Even targeted therapy, then, was a cat-and-mouse game. One could
direct endless arrows at the Achilles’ heel of cancer, but the disease
might simply shift its foot, switching one vulnerability for another. We
were locked in a perpetual battle with a volatile combatant. When CML
cells kicked Gleevec away, only a different molecular variant would
drive them down, and when they outgrew that drug, then we would need the
next-generation drug. If the vigilance was dropped, even for a moment,
then the weight of the battle would shift. In Lewis Carroll’s Through
the Looking-Glass, the Red Queen tells Alice that the world keeps
shifting so quickly under her feet that she has to keep running just to
keep her position. This is our predicament with cancer: we are forced to
keep running merely to keep still.</p>
<p>In the decade since the discovery of Gleevec, twenty-four novel drugs
have been listed by the National Cancer Institute as cancer-targeted
therapies. Dozens more are in development. The twenty-four drugs have
been shown to be effective against lung, breast, colon, and prostate
cancers, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias. Some, such as dasatinib,
directly inactivate oncogenes. Others target oncogene-activated
pathways—the “hallmarks of cancer” codified by Weinberg. The drug
Avastin interrupts tumor angiogenesis by attacking the capacity of
cancer cells to incite blood-vessel growth. Bortezomib, or Velcade,
blocks an internal waste-dispensing mechanism for proteins that is
particularly hyperactive in cancer cells.</p>
<p>More than nearly any other form of cancer, multiple myeloma, a cancer
of immune-system cells, epitomizes the impact of these newly discovered
targeted therapies. In the 1980s, multiple myeloma was treated by high
doses of standard chemotherapy—old, hard-bitten drugs that typically
ended up decimating patients about as quickly as they decimated the
cancer. Over a decade, three novel targeted therapies have emerged for
myeloma—Velcade, thalidomide, and Revlimid—all of which interrupt
activated pathways in myeloma cells. Treatment of multiple myeloma today
involves mixing and matching these drugs with standard chemotherapies,
switching drugs when the tumor relapses, and switching again when the
tumor relapses again. No single drug or treatment cures myeloma
outright; myeloma is still a fatal disease. But as with CML, the
cat-and-mouse game with cancer has extended the survival of myeloma
patients—strikingly in some cases. In 1971, about half the patients
diagnosed with multiple myeloma died within twenty-four months of
diagnosis; the other half died by the tenth year. In 2008, about half of
all myeloma patients treated with the shifting armamentarium of new
drugs will still be alive at five years. If the survival trends
continue, the other half will continue to be alive well beyond ten
years.</p>
<p>In 2005, a man diagnosed with multiple myeloma asked me if he would
be alive to watch his daughter graduate from high school in a few
months. In 2009, bound to a wheelchair, he watched his daughter graduate
from college. The wheelchair had nothing to do with his cancer. The man
had fallen down while coaching his youngest son’s baseball team.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, the Red Queen syndrome—moving incessantly just to
keep in place—applies equally to every aspect of the battle against
cancer, including cancer screening and cancer prevention. In the early
winter of 2007, I traveled to Framingham in Massachusetts to visit a
study site that will likely alter the way we imagine cancer prevention.
A small, nondescript Northeastern town bound by a chain of frozen lakes
in midwinter, Framingham is nonetheless an iconic place writ large in
the history of medicine. In 1948, epidemiologists identified a cohort of
about five thousand men and women living in Framingham. The behavior of
this cohort, its habits, its interrelationships, and its illnesses, has
been documented year after year in exquisite detail, creating an
invaluable longitudinal corpus of data for hundreds of epidemiological
studies. The English mystery writer Agatha Christie often used a
fictional village, St. Mary Mead, as a microcosm of all mankind.
Framingham is the American epidemiologist’s English village. Under sharp
statistical lenses, its captive cohort has lived, reproduced, aged, and
died, affording a rare glimpse of the natural history of life, disease,
and death.</p>
<p>The Framingham data set has spawned a host of studies on risk and
illness. The link between cholesterol and heart attacks was formally
established here, as was the association of stroke and high blood
pressure. But recently, a conceptual transformation in epidemiological
thinking has also been spearheaded here. Epidemiologists typically
measure the risk factors for chronic, noninfectious illnesses by
studying the behavior of individuals. But recently, they have asked a
very different question: what if the real locus of risk lies not in the
behaviors of individual actors, but in social networks?</p>
<p>In May 2008, two Harvard epidemiologists, Nicholas Christakis and
James Fowler, used this notion to examine the dynamics of cigarette
smoking. First, Fowler and Christakis plotted a diagram of all known
relationships in Framingham—friends, neighbors, and relatives, siblings,
ex-wives, uncles, aunts—as a densely interconnected web. Viewed
abstractly, the network began to assume familiar and intuitive patterns.
A few men and women (call them “socializers”) stood at the epicenter of
these networks, densely connected to each other through multiple ties.
In contrast, others lingered on the outskirts of the social
web—“loners”—with few and fleeting contacts.</p>
<p>When the epidemiologists juxtaposed smoking behavior onto this
network and followed the pattern of smoking over decades, a notable
phenomenon emerged: circles of relationships were found to be more
powerful predictors of the dynamics of smoking than nearly any other
factor. Entire networks stopped smoking concordantly, like whole
circuits flickering off. A family that dined together was also a family
that quit together. When highly connected “socializers” stopped smoking,
the dense social circle circumscribed around them also slowly stopped as
a group. As a result, smoking gradually became locked into the far
peripheries of all networks, confined to the “loners” with few social
contacts, puffing away quietly in the distant and isolated corners of
the town.</p>
<p>The smoking-network study offers, to my mind, a formidable challenge
to simplistic models of cancer prevention. Smoking, this model argues,
is entwined into our social DNA just as densely and as inextricably as
oncogenes are entwined into our genetic material. The cigarette
epidemic, we might recall, originated as a form of metastatic
behavior—one site seeding another site seeding another. Soldiers brought
smoking back to postwar Europe; women persuaded women to smoke; the
tobacco industry, sensing opportunity, advertised cigarettes as a form
of social glue that would “stick” individuals into cohesive groups. The
capacity of metastasis is thus built into smoking. If entire networks of
smokers can flicker off with catalytic speed, then they can also flicker
on with catalytic speed. Sever the ties that bind the nonsmokers of
Framingham (or worse, nucleate a large social network with a
proselytizing smoker), and then, cataclysmically, the network might
alter as a whole.</p>
<p>This is why even the most successful cancer-prevention strategies can
lapse so swiftly. When the Red Queen’s feet stop spinning even
temporarily, she does not maintain her position; the world around her,
counter-spinning, pushes her off-balance. So it is with cancer
prevention. When antitobacco campaigns lose their effectiveness or
penetrance—as has recently happened among teens in America or in
Asia—smoking often returns like an old plague. Social behavior
metastasizes, eddying out from its center toward the peripheries of
social networks. Mini-epidemics of smoking-related cancers are sure to
follow.</p>
<p>The landscape of carcinogens is not static either. We are chemical
apes: having discovered the capacity to extract, purify, and react
molecules to produce new and wondrous molecules, we have begun to spin a
new chemical universe around ourselves. Our bodies, our cells, our genes
are thus being immersed and reimmersed in a changing flux of
molecules—pesticides, pharmaceutical drugs, plastics, cosmetics,
estrogens, food products, hormones, even novel forms of physical
impulses, such as radiation and magnetism. Some of these, inevitably,
will be carcinogenic. We cannot wish this world away; our task, then, is
to sift through it vigilantly to discriminate bona fide carcinogens from
innocent and useful bystanders.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done. In 2004, a rash of early scientific
reports suggested that cell phones, which produce radio frequency
energy, might cause a fatal form of brain cancer called a glioma.
Gliomas appeared on the same side of the brain that the phone was
predominantly held, further tightening the link. An avalanche of panic
ensued in the media. But was this a falsely perceived confluence of a
common phenomenon and a rare disease—phone usage and glioma? Or had
epidemiologists missed the “nylon stockings” of the digital age?</p>
<p>In 2004, an enormous British study was launched to confirm these
ominous early reports. “Cases”—patients with gliomas—were compared to
“controls”—men and women with no gliomas—in terms of cell phone usage.
The study, reported in 2006, appeared initially to confirm an increased
risk of right-sided brain cancers in men and women who held their phone
on their right ear. But when researchers evaluated the data
meticulously, a puzzling pattern emerged: right-sided cell phone use
reduced the risk of left-sided brain cancer. The simplest logical
explanation for this phenomenon was “recall bias”: patients diagnosed
with tumors unconsciously exaggerated the use of cell phones on the same
side of their head, and selectively forgot the use on the other side.
When the authors corrected for this bias, there was no detectable
association between gliomas and cell phone use overall. Prevention
experts, and phone-addicted teenagers, may have rejoiced—but only
briefly. By the time the study was completed, new phones had entered the
market and swapped out old phones—making even the negative results
questionable.</p>
<p>The cell phone case is a sobering reminder of the methodological
rigor needed to evaluate new carcinogens. It is easy to fan anxiety
about cancer. Identifying a true preventable carcinogen, estimating the
magnitude of risk at reasonable doses and at reasonable exposures, and
reducing exposure through scientific and legislative
intervention—keeping the legacy of Percivall Pott alive—is far more
complex.</p>
<p>“Cancer at the fin de siècle,” as the oncologist Harold Burstein
described it, “resides at the interface between society and science.” It
poses not one but two challenges. The first, the “biological challenge”
of cancer, involves “harnessing the fantastic rise in scientific
knowledge . . . to conquer this ancient and terrible illness.” But the
second, the “social challenge,” is just as acute: it involves forcing
ourselves to confront our customs, rituals, and behaviors. These,
unfortunately, are not customs or behaviors that lie at the peripheries
of our society or selves, but ones that lie at their definitional cores:
what we eat and drink, what we produce and exude into our environments,
when we choose to reproduce, and how we age.</p>
