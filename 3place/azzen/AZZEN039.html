<h4 id="the-hunting-of-the-sarc">“The hunting of the sarc”</h4>
<p>For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.</p>
<p>—Lewis Carroll</p>
<p>Sol Spiegelman had got hopelessly lost hunting for cancer-causing
retroviruses in humans. His predicament was symptomatic: cancer biology,
the NCI, and the targeted Special Virus Cancer Program had all banked so
ardently on the existence of human cancer retroviruses in the early
1970s that when the viruses failed to materialize, it was as if some
essential part of their identity or imagination had been amputated. If
human cancer retroviruses did not exist, then human cancers must be
caused by some other mysterious mechanism. The pendulum, having swung
sharply toward an infectious viral cause of cancer, swung just as
sharply away.</p>
<p>Temin, too, had dismissed retroviruses as the causal agents for human
cancer by the mid-1970s. His discovery of reverse transcription had
certainly overturned the dogma of cellular biology, but it had not
pushed the understanding of human carcinogenesis far. Viral genes could
attach themselves to cellular genes, Temin knew, but this could not
explain how viruses caused cancer.</p>
<p>Faced with yet another discrepancy between theory and data, Temin
proposed another bold conjecture—again, standing on the thinnest
foundation of evidence. Spiegelman and the retrovirus hunters, Temin
argued, had conflated analogy with fact, confused messenger with
message. Rous sarcoma virus could cause cancer by inserting a viral gene
into cells. This proved that genetic alterations could cause cancer. But
the genetic alteration, Temin proposed, need not originate in a virus.
The virus had merely brought a message into a cell. To understand the
genesis of cancer, it was that culprit message—not the messenger—that
needed to be identified. Cancer virus hunters needed to return to their
lamplit virus again, but this time with new questions: What was the
viral gene that had unleashed pathological mitosis in cells? And how was
that gene related to an internal mutation in the cell?</p>
<p>In the 1970s, several laboratories began to home in on that gene.
Fortuitously, RSV possesses only four genes in its genome. In
California, by then the hotbed of cancer virus research, the virologists
Steve Martin, Peter Vogt, and Peter Duesberg made mutants of the Rous
virus that replicated normally, but could no longer create
tumors—suggesting that the tumor-causing gene had been disrupted. By
analyzing the genes altered in these mutant viruses, these groups
finally pinpointed RSV’s cancer-causing ability to a single gene in the
virus. The gene was called src (pronounced “sarc”), a diminutive of
sarcoma.</p>
<p>Src, then, was the answer to Temin’s puzzle, the cancer-causing
“message” borne by Rous sarcoma virus. Vogt and Duesberg removed or
inactivated src from the virus and demonstrated that the src-less virus
could neither induce cell proliferation nor cause transformation. Src,
they speculated, was some sort of malformed gene acquired by RSV during
its evolution and introduced into normal cells. It was termed an
oncogene,* a gene capable of causing cancer.</p>
<p>A chance discovery in Ray Erikson’s laboratory at the University of
Colorado further elucidated src’s function. Erikson had been a graduate
student in Madison in the early 1960s when Temin had found retroviruses.
Erikson had followed the discovery of the src gene in California and had
been haunted by the function of src ever since. In 1977, working with
Mark Collett and Joan Brugge, Erikson set out to decipher the function
of src. Src, Erikson discovered, was an unusual gene. It encoded a
protein whose most prominent function was to modify other proteins by
attaching a small chemical, a phosphate group, to these proteins—in
essence, playing an elaborate game of molecular tag.† Indeed, scientists
had found a number of similar proteins in normal cells—enzymes that
attached phosphate groups to other proteins. These enzymes were called
the “kinases,” and they were soon found to behave as molecular master
switches within a cell. The attachment of the phosphate group to a
protein acted like an “on” switch—activating the protein’s function.
Often, a kinase turned “on” another kinase, which turned “on” another
kinase, and so forth. The signal was amplified at each step of the chain
reaction, until many such molecular switches were thrown into their “on”
positions. The confluence of many such activated switches produced a
powerful internal signal to a cell to change its “state”—moving, for
instance, from a nondividing to a dividing state.</p>
<p>Src was a prototypical kinase—although a kinase on hyperdrive. The
protein made by the viral src gene was so potent and hyperactive that it
phosphorylated anything and everything around it, including many crucial
proteins in the cell. Src worked by unleashing an indiscriminate volley
of phosphorylation—throwing “on” dozens of molecular switches. In src’s
case, the activated series of proteins eventually impinged on proteins
that controlled cell division. Src thus forcibly induced a cell to
change its state from nondividing to dividing, ultimately inducing
accelerated mitosis, the hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>By the late 1970s, the combined efforts of biochemists and tumor
virologists had produced a relatively simple view of src’s ability to
transform cells. Rous sarcoma virus caused cancer in chickens by
introducing into cells a gene, src, that encoded a hyperactive
overexuberant kinase. This kinase turned “on” a cascade of cellular
signals to divide relentlessly. All of this represented beautiful,
careful, meticulously crafted work. But with no human cancer
retroviruses in the study, none of this research seemed relevant
immediately to human cancers.</p>
<p>Yet the indefatigable Temin still felt that viral src would solve the
mystery of human cancers. In Temin’s mind, there was one riddle yet to
be solved: the evolutionary origin of the src gene. How might a virus
have “acquired” a gene with such potent, disturbing qualities? Was src a
viral kinase gone berserk? Or was it a kinase that the virus had
constructed out of bits of other genes like a cobbled-together bomb?
Evolution, Temin knew, could build new genes out of old genes. But where
had Rous sarcoma virus found the necessary components of a gene to make
a chicken cell cancerous?</p>
<p>At the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF), in a
building perched high on one of the city’s hills, a virologist named J.
Michael Bishop became preoccupied with the evolutionary origin of viral
src. Born in rural Pennsylvania, where his father had been a Lutheran
minister, Bishop had studied history at Gettysburg College, then
drastically altered his trajectory to attend Harvard Medical School.
After a residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, he had trained as a
virologist. In the 1960s, Bishop had moved to UCSF to set up a lab to
explore viruses.</p>
<p>UCSF was then a little-known, backwater medical school. Bishop’s
shared office occupied a sliver of space at the edge of the building, a
room so cramped and narrow that his office-mate had to stand up to let
him through to his desk. In the summer of 1969, when a lanky,
self-assured researcher from the NIH, Harold Varmus, then on a hiking
trip in California, knocked on Bishop’s office door to ask if he might
join the lab to study retroviruses, there was hardly any standing room
at all.</p>
<p>Varmus had come to California seeking adventure. A former graduate
student in literature, he had become enthralled by medicine, obtained
his M.D. at Columbia University in New York, then learned virology at
the NIH. Like Bishop, he was also an academic itinerant—wandering from
medieval literature to medicine to virology. Lewis Carroll’s Hunting of
the Snark tells the story of a motley crew of hunters that launch an
agonizing journey to trap a deranged, invisible creature called the
Snark. That hunt goes awfully wrong. Unpromisingly, as Varmus and Bishop
set off to understand the origins of the src gene in the early 1970s,
other scientists nicknamed the project “the hunting of the sarc.”</p>
<p>Varmus and Bishop launched their hunt using a simple technique—a
method invented, in part, by Sol Spiegelman in the 1960s. Their goal was
to find cellular genes that were distantly similar to the viral src
gene—and thus find src’s evolutionary precursors. DNA molecules
typically exist as paired, complementary strands, like yin and yang,
that are “stuck” together by powerful molecular forces. Each strand, if
separated, can thus stick to another strand that is complementary in
structure. If one molecule of DNA is tagged with radioactivity, it will
seek out its complementary molecule in a mixture and stick to it,
thereby imparting radioactivity to the second molecule. The sticking
ability can be measured by the amount of radioactivity.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Bishop and Varmus began to use the viral src gene
to hunt for its homologues, using this “sticking” reaction. Src was a
viral gene, and they expected to find only fragments or pieces of src in
normal cells—ancestors and distant relatives of the cancer-causing src
gene. But the hunt soon took a mystifying turn. When Varmus and Bishop
looked in normal cells, they did not find a genetic third or fifth
cousin of src. They found a nearly identical version of viral src lodged
firmly in the normal cell’s genome.</p>
<p>Varmus and Bishop, working with Deborah Spector and Dominique
Stehelin, probed more cells, and again the src gene appeared in them: in
duck cells, quail cells, and geese cells. Closely related homologues of
the src gene were strewn all over the bird kingdom; each time Varmus’s
team looked up or down an evolutionary branch, they found some variant
of src staring back. Soon, the UCSF group was racing through multiple
species to look for homologues of src. They found src in the cells of
pheasants, turkeys, mice, rabbits, and fish. Cells from a newborn emu at
the Sacramento zoo had src. So did sheep and cows. Most important, so
did human cells. “Src,” Varmus wrote in a letter in 1976, “. . . is
everywhere.”</p>
<p>But the src gene that existed in normal cells was not identical to
the viral src. When Hidesaburo Hanafusa, a Japanese virologist at
Rockefeller University in New York, compared the viral src gene to the
normal cellular src gene, he found a crucial difference in the genetic
code between the two forms of src. Viral src carried mutations that
dramatically affected its function. Viral src protein, as Erikson had
found in Colorado, was a disturbed, hyperactive kinase that relentlessly
tagged proteins with phosphate groups and thus provided a perpetually
blaring “on” signal for cell division. Cellular src protein possessed
the same kinase activity, but it was far less hyperactive; in contrast
to viral src, it was tightly regulated—turned “on” and turned
“off”—during cell division. The viral src protein, in contrast, was a
permanently activated switch—“an automaton,” as Erikson described
it—that had turned the cell into a dividing machine. Viral src—the
cancer-causing gene—was cellular src on overdrive.</p>
<p>A theory began to convulse out of these results, a theory so
magnificent and powerful that it would explain decades of disparate
observations in a single swoop: perhaps src, the precursor to the
cancer-causing gene, was endogenous to the cell. Perhaps viral src had
evolved out of cellular src. Retrovirologists had long believed that the
virus had introduced an activated src into normal cells to transform
them into malignant cells. But the src gene had not originated in the
virus. It had originated from a precursor gene that existed in a cell—in
all cells. Cancer biology’s decades-long hunt had started with a chicken
and ended, metaphorically, in the egg—in a progenitor gene present in
all human cells.</p>
<p>Rous’s sarcoma virus, then, was the product of an incredible
evolutionary accident. Retroviruses, Temin had shown, shuttle constantly
out of the cell’s genome: RNA to DNA to RNA. During this cycling, they
can pick up pieces of the cell’s genes and carry them, like barnacles,
from one cell to another. Rous’s sarcoma virus had likely picked up an
activated src gene from a cancer cell and carried it in the viral
genome, creating more cancer. The virus, in effect, was no more than an
accidental courier for a gene that had originated in a cancer cell—a
parasite parasitized by cancer. Rous had been wrong—but spectacularly
wrong. Viruses did cause cancer, but they did so, typically, by
tampering with genes that originate in cells.</p>
<p>Science is often described as an iterative and cumulative process, a
puzzle solved piece by piece, with each piece contributing a few hazy
pixels of a much larger picture. But the arrival of a truly powerful new
theory in science often feels far from iterative. Rather than explain
one observation or phenomenon in a single, pixelated step, an entire
field of observations suddenly seems to crystallize into a perfect
whole. The effect is almost like watching a puzzle solve itself.</p>
<p>Varmus and Bishop’s experiments had precisely such a crystallizing,
zippering effect on cancer genetics. The crucial implication of the
Varmus and Bishop experiment was that a precursor of a cancer-causing
gene—the “proto-oncogene,” as Bishop and Varmus called it—was a normal
cellular gene. Mutations induced by chemicals or X-rays caused cancer
not by “inserting” foreign genes into cells, but by activating such
endogenous proto-oncogenes.</p>
<p>“Nature,” Rous wrote in 1966, “sometimes seems possessed of a
sardonic humor.” And the final lesson of Rous sarcoma virus had been its
most sardonic by far. For nearly six decades, the Rous virus had seduced
biologists—Spiegelman most sadly among them—down a false path. Yet the
false path had ultimately circled back to the right destination—from
viral src toward cellular src and to the notion of internal
proto-oncogenes sitting omnipresently in the normal cell’s genome.</p>
<p>In Lewis Carroll’s poem, when the hunters finally capture the
deceptive Snark, it reveals itself not to be a foreign beast, but one of
the human hunters sent to trap it. And so it had turned out with cancer.
Cancer genes came from within the human genome. Indeed the Greeks had
been peculiarly prescient yet again in their use of the term oncos.
Cancer was intrinsically “loaded” in our genome, awaiting activation. We
were destined to carry this fatal burden in our genes—our own genetic
“oncos.”</p>
<p>Varmus and Bishop were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery of
the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes in 1989. At the banquet in
Stockholm, Varmus, recalling his former life as a student of literature,
read lines from the epic poem Beowulf, recapitulating the slaying of the
dragon in that story: “We have not slain our enemy, the cancer cell, or
figuratively torn the limbs from his body,” Varmus said. “In our
adventures, we have only seen our monster more clearly and described his
scales and fangs in new ways—ways that reveal a cancer cell to be, like
Grendel, a distorted version of our normal selves.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The term oncogene had been coined earlier by two NCI scientists,
Robert Huebner and George Todaro, in 1969, although on scant
evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>†Art Levinson, in Mike Bishop’s lab at UCSF, also discovered this
phosphorylating activity; we will return to Levinson’s discovery in
later pages.</p>
