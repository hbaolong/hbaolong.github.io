<h4 id="a-four-minute-mile">A Four-Minute Mile</h4>
<p>The nontoxic curative compound remains undiscovered but not
undreamt.</p>
<p>—James F. Holland</p>
<p>Why, it is asked, does the supply of new miracle drugs lag so far
behind, while biology continues to move from strength to strength . . .?
There is still the conspicuous asymmetry between molecular biology and,
say, the therapy of lung cancer.</p>
<p>—Lewis Thomas,</p>
<p>The Lives of a Cell, 1978</p>
<p>In the summer of 1990, as Herceptin entered its earliest trials,
another oncogene-targeted drug began its long journey toward the clinic.
More than any other medicine in the history of cancer, more even than
Herceptin, the development of this drug—from cancer to oncogene to a
targeted therapy and to successive human trials—would signal the arrival
of a new era in cancer medicine. Yet to arrive at this new era, cancer
biologists would again need to circle back to old observations—to the
peculiar illness that John Bennett had called a “suppuration of blood,”
that Virchow had reclassified as weisses Blut in 1847, and that later
researchers had again reclassified as chronic myeloid leukemia or
CML.</p>
<p>For more than a century, Virchow’s weisses Blut had lived on the
peripheries of oncology. In 1973, CML was suddenly thrust center stage.
Examining CML cells, Janet Rowley identified a unique chromosomal
aberration that existed in all the leukemia cells. This abnormality, the
so-called Philadelphia chromosome, was the result of a translocation in
which the “head” of chromosome twenty-two and the “tail” of chromosome
nine had been fused to create a novel gene. Rowley’s work suggested that
CML cells possess a distinct and unique genetic abnormality—possibly the
first human oncogene.</p>
<p>Rowley’s observation launched a prolonged hunt for the mysterious
chimeric gene produced by the 9:22 fusion. The identity of the gene
emerged piece by piece over a decade. In 1982, a team of Dutch
researchers in Amsterdam isolated the gene on chromosome nine. They
called it abl.* In 1984, working with American collaborators in
Maryland, the same team isolated abl’s partner on chromosome
twenty-two—a gene called Bcr. The oncogene created by the fusion of
these two genes in CML cells was named Bcr-abl. In 1987, David
Baltimore’s laboratory in Boston “engineered” a mouse containing the
activated Bcr-abl oncogene in its blood cells. The mouse developed the
fatal spleen-choking leukemia that Bennett had seen in the Scottish
slate-layer and Virchow in the German cook more than a century
earlier—proving that Bcr-abl drove the pathological proliferation of CML
cells.</p>
<p>As with the study of any oncogene, the field now turned from
structure to function: what did Bcr-abl do to cause leukemia? When
Baltimore’s lab and Owen Witte’s lab investigated the function of the
aberrant Bcr-abl oncogene, they found that, like src, it was yet another
kinase—a protein that tagged other proteins with a phosphate group and
thus unleashed a cascade of signals in a cell. In normal cells, the Bcr
and abl genes existed separately; both were tightly regulated during
cell division. In CML cells, the translocation created a new
chimera—Bcr-abl, a hyperactive, overexuberant kinase that activated a
pathway that forced cells to divide incessantly.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, with little knowledge about the emerging molecular
genetics of CML, a team of chemists at Ciba-Geigy, a pharmaceutical
company in Basel, Switzerland, was trying to develop drugs that might
inhibit kinases. The human genome has about five hundred kinases (of
which, about ninety belong to the subclass that contains src and
Bcr-abl). Every kinase attaches phosphate tags to a unique set of
proteins in the cell. Kinases thus act as molecular master-switches in
cells—turning “on” some pathways and turning “off” others—thus providing
the cell a coordinated set of internal signals to grow, shrink, move,
stop, or die. Recognizing the pivotal role of kinases in cellular
physiology, the Ciba-Geigy team hoped to discover drugs that could
activate or inhibit kinases selectively in cells, thus manipulating the
cell’s master-switches. The team was led by a tall, reserved, acerbic
Swiss physician-biochemist, Alex Matter. In 1986, Matter was joined in
his hunt for selective kinase inhibitors by Nick Lydon, a biochemist
from Leeds, England.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical chemists often think of molecules in terms of faces
and surfaces. Their world is topological; they imagine touching
molecules with the tactile hypersensitivity of the blind. If the surface
of a protein is bland and featureless, then that protein is typically
“undruggable”; flat, poker-faced topologies make for poor targets for
drugs. But if a protein’s surface is marked with deep crevices and
pockets, then that protein tends to make an attractive target for other
molecules to bind—and is thereby a possible “druggable” target.</p>
<p>Kinases, fortuitously, possess at least one such deep druggable
pocket. In 1976, a team of Japanese researchers looking for poisons in
sea bacteria had accidentally discovered a molecule called
staurosporine, a large molecule shaped like a lopsided Maltese cross
that bound to a pocket present in most kinases. Staurosporine inhibited
dozens of kinases. It was an exquisite poison, but a terrible
drug—possessing virtually no ability to discriminate between any kinase,
active or inactive, good or bad, in most cells.</p>
<p>The existence of staurosporine inspired Matter. If sea bacteria could
synthesize a drug to block kinases nonspecifically, then surely a team
of chemists could make a drug to block only certain kinases in cells. In
1986, Matter and Lydon found a critical lead. Having tested millions of
potential molecules, they discovered a skeletal chemical that, like
staurosporine, could also lodge itself into a kinase protein’s cleft and
inhibit its function. Unlike staurosporine, though, this skeletal
structure was a much simpler chemical. Matter and Lydon could make
dozens of variants of this chemical to determine if some might bind
better to certain kinases. It was a self-conscious emulation of Paul
Ehrlich, who had, in the 1890s, gradually coaxed specificity from his
aniline dyes and thus created a universe of novel medicines. History
repeats itself, but chemistry, Matter and Lydon knew, repeats itself
more insistently.</p>
<p>It was a painstaking, iterative game—chemistry by trial and error.
Jürg Zimmermann, a talented chemist on Matter’s team, created thousands
of variants of the parent molecule and handed them off to a cell
biologist, Elisabeth Buchdunger. Buchdunger tested these new molecules
on cells, weeding out those that were insoluble or toxic, then bounced
them back to Zimmermann for resynthesis, resetting the relay race toward
more and more specific and nontoxic chemicals. “[It was] what a
locksmith does when he has to make a key fit,” Zimmermann said. “You
change the shape of the key and test it. Does it fit? If not, you change
it again.”</p>
<p>By the early nineties, this fitting and refitting had created dozens
of new molecules that were structurally related to Matter’s original
kinase inhibitor. When Lydon tested this panel of inhibitors on various
kinases found in cells, he discovered that these molecules possessed
specificity: one molecule might inhibit src and spare every other
kinase, while another might block abl and spare src. What Matter and
Lydon now needed was a disease in which to apply this collection of
chemicals—a form of cancer driven by a locked, overexuberant kinase that
they could kill using a specific kinase inhibitor.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, Nick Lydon traveled to the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston to investigate whether one of the kinase inhibitors
synthesized in Basel might inhibit the growth of a particular form of
cancer. Lydon met Brian Druker, a young faculty member at the institute
fresh from his oncology fellowship and about to launch an independent
laboratory in Boston. Druker was particularly interested in chronic
myelogenous leukemia—the cancer driven by the Bcr-abl kinase.</p>
<p>Druker heard of Lydon’s collection of kinase-specific inhibitors, and
he was quick to make the logical leap. “I was drawn to oncology as a
medical student because I had read Farber’s original paper on
aminopterin and it had had a deep influence on me,” he recalled.
“Farber’s generation had tried to target cancer cells empirically, but
had failed because the mechanistic understanding of cancer was so poor.
Farber had had the right idea, but at the wrong time.”</p>
<p>Druker had the right idea at the right time. Once again, as with
Slamon and Ullrich, two halves of a puzzle came together. Druker had a
cohort of CML patients afflicted by a tumor driven by a specific
hyperactive kinase. Lydon and Matter had synthesized an entire
collection of kinase inhibitors now stocked in Ciba-Geigy’s freezer in
Basel. Somewhere in that Ciba collection, Druker reasoned, was lurking
his fantasy drug—a chemical kinase inhibitor with specific affinity for
Bcr-abl. Druker proposed an ambitious collaboration between Ciba-Geigy
and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to test the kinase inhibitors in
patients. But the agreement fell apart; the legal teams in Basel and
Boston could not find agreeable terms. Drugs could recognize and bind
kinases specifically, but scientists and lawyers could not partner with
each other to bring these drugs to patients. The project, having
generated an interminable trail of legal memos, was quietly tabled.</p>
<p>But Druker was persistent. In 1993, he left Boston to start his own
laboratory at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in
Portland. Unyoked, at last, from the institution that had forestalled
his collaboration, he immediately called Lydon to reestablish a
connection. Lydon informed him that the Ciba-Geigy team had synthesized
an even larger collection of inhibitors and had found a molecule that
might bind Bcr-abl with high specificity and selectivity. The molecule
was called CGP57148. Summoning all the nonchalance that he could
muster—having learned his lessons in Boston—Druker walked over to the
legal department at OHSU and, revealing little about the potential of
the chemicals, watched as the lawyers absentmindedly signed on the
dotted line. “Everyone just humored me,” he recalled. “No one thought
even faintly that this drug might work.” In two weeks, he received a
package from Basel with a small collection of kinase inhibitors to test
in his lab.</p>
<p>The clinical world of CML was, meanwhile, reeling from disappointment
to disappointment. In October 1992, just a few months before CGP57148
crossed the Atlantic from Lydon’s Basel lab into Druker’s hands in
Oregon, a fleet of leukemia experts descended on the historic town of
Bologna in Italy for an international conference on CML. The location
was resplendent and evocative—Vesalius had once lectured and taught in
these quadrangles and amphitheaters, dismantling Galen’s theory of
cancer piece by piece. But the news at the meeting was uninspiring. The
principal treatment for CML in 1993 was allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, the protocol pioneered in Seattle by Donnall Thomas in
the sixties. Allo-transplantation, in which a foreign bone marrow was
transplanted into a patient’s body, could increase the survival of CML
patients, but the gains were often so modest that massive trials were
needed to detect them. At Bologna, even transplanters glumly
acknowledged the meager benefits: “Although freedom from leukemia could
be obtained only with BMT,” one study concluded, “a beneficial effect of
BMT on overall survival could be detected only in a patients’ subset,
and . . . many hundreds of cases and a decade could be necessary to
evaluate the effect on survival.”</p>
<p>Like most leukemia experts, Druker was all too familiar with this
dismal literature. “Cancer is complicated, everyone kept telling me
patronizingly—as if I had suggested that it was not complicated.” The
growing dogma, he knew, was that CML was perhaps intrinsically a
chemotherapy-resistant disease. Even if the leukemia was initiated by
that single translocation of the Bcr-abl gene, by the time the disease
was identified in full bloom in real patients, it had accumulated a host
of additional mutations, creating a genetic tornado so chaotic that even
transplantation, the chemotherapist’s bluntest weapon, was of no
consequence. The inciting Bcr-abl kinase had likely long been
overwhelmed by more powerful driver mutations. Using a kinase inhibitor
to try to control the disease, Druker feared, would be like blowing hard
on a matchstick long after it had ignited a forest fire.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1993, when Lydon’s drug arrived in Druker’s hands,
he added it to CML cells in a petri dish, hoping, at best, for a small
effect. But the cell lines responded briskly. Overnight, the
drug-treated CML cells died, and the tissue-culture flasks filled up
with floating husks of involuted leukemia cells. Druker was amazed. He
implanted CML cells into mice to form real, living tumors and treated
the mice with the drug. As with the first experiment, the tumors
regressed in days. The response suggested specificity as well: normal
mouse blood cells were left untouched. Druker performed a third
experiment. He drew out samples of bone marrow from a few human patients
with CML and applied CGP57148 to the cells in a petri dish. The leukemia
cells in the marrow died immediately. The only cells remaining in the
dish were normal blood cells. He had cured leukemia in the dish.</p>
<p>Druker described the findings in the journal Nature Medicine. It was
a punchy, compact study—just five clean, well-built experiments—driving
relentlessly toward a simple conclusion: “This compound may be useful in
the treatment of Bcr-abl positive leukemias.” Druker was the first
author and Lydon the senior author, with Buchdunger and Zimmermann as
key contributors.</p>
<p>Druker expected Ciba-Geigy to be ecstatic about these results. This,
after all, was the ultimate dream child of oncology—a drug with
exquisite specificity for an oncogene in a cancer cell. But in Basel,
Ciba-Geigy was in internal disarray. The company had fused with its
archrival across the river, the pharma giant Sandoz, into a
pharmaceutical behemoth called Novartis. For Novartis, it was the
exquisite specificity of CGP57148 that was precisely its fatal undoing.
Developing CGP57148 into a clinical drug for human use would involve
further testing—animal studies and clinical trials that would cost 00 to
00 million. CML afflicts a few thousand patients every year in America.
The prospect of spending millions on a molecule to benefit thousands
gave Novartis cold feet.</p>
<p>Druker now found himself inhabiting an inverted world in which an
academic researcher had to beg a pharmaceutical company to push its own
products into clinical trials. Novartis had a plethora of predictable
excuses: “The drug . . . would never work, would be too toxic, would
never make any money.” Between 1995 and 1997 Druker flew back and forth
between Basel and Portland trying to convince Novartis to continue the
clinical development of its drug. “Either get [the drug] into clinical
trials or license it to me. Make a decision,” Druker insisted. If
Novartis would not make the drug, Druker thought he could have another
chemist take it on. “In the worst case,” he recalled, “I thought I would
make it in my own basement.”</p>
<p>Planning ahead, he assembled a team of other physicians to run a
potential clinical trial of the drug on CML patients: Charles Sawyers
from UCLA, Moshe Talpaz, a hematologist from Houston, and John Goldman
from the Hammersmith Hospital in London, all highly regarded authorities
on CML. Druker said, “I had patients in my clinic with CML with no
effective treatment options remaining. Every day, I would come home from
the clinic and promise to push Novartis a little.”</p>
<p>In early 1998, Novartis finally relented. It would synthesize and
release a few grams of CGP57148, just about enough to run a trial on
about a hundred patients. Druker would have a shot—but only one shot. To
Novartis, CGP57148, the product of its most ambitious drug-discovery
program to date, was already a failure.</p>
<p>I first heard of Druker’s drug in the fall of 2002. I was a medical
resident triaging patients in the emergency room at Mass General when an
intern called me about a middle-aged man with a history of CML who had
come in with a rash. I heard the story almost instinctively, drawing
quick conclusions. The patient, I surmised, had been transplanted with
foreign bone marrow, and the rash was the first blush of a cataclysm to
come. The immune cells in the foreign marrow were attacking his own
body—graft-versus-host disease. His prognosis was grim. He would need
steroids, immunosuppressives, and immediate admission to the transplant
floor.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. Glancing at the chart in the red folder, I saw no
mention of a transplant. Under the stark neon light of the examining
room when he held out his hand to be examined, the rash was just a few
scattered, harmless-looking papules—nothing like the dusky, mottled haze
that is often the harbinger of a graft reaction. Searching for an
alternative explanation, I quickly ran my eye through his list of
medicines. Only one drug was listed: Gleevec, the new name for Druker’s
drug, CGP57148.*</p>
<p>The rash was a minor side effect of the drug. The major effect of the
drug, though, was less visible but far more dramatic. Smeared under the
microscope in the pathology lab on the second floor, his blood cells
looked extraordinarily ordinary—“normal red cells, normal platelets,
normal white blood cells,” I whispered under my breath as I ran my eyes
slowly over the three lineages. It was hard to reconcile this field of
blood cells in front of my eyes with the diagnosis; not a single
leukemic blast was to be seen. If this man had CML, he was in a
remission so deep that the disease had virtually vanished from
sight.</p>
<p>By the winter of 1998, Druker, Sawyers, and Talpaz had witnessed
dozens of such remissions. Druker’s first patient to be treated with
Gleevec was a sixty-year-old retired train conductor from the Oregon
coast. The patient had read about the drug in an article about Druker in
a local newspaper. He had called Druker immediately and offered to be a
“guinea pig.” Druker gave him a small dose of the drug, then stood by
his bedside for the rest of the afternoon, nervously awaiting any signs
of toxicity. By the end of the day there were no adverse effects; the
man was still alive. “It was the first time that the molecule had
entered a human body, and it could easily have created havoc, but it
didn’t,” Druker recalled. “The sense of relief was incredible.”</p>
<p>Druker edged into higher and higher doses—25, 50, 85, and 140 mg. His
cohort of patients grew as well. As the dose was escalated in patients,
Gleevec’s effect became even more evident. One patient, a Portland
woman, had come to his clinic with a blood count that had risen to
nearly thirtyfold the normal number; her blood vessels were engorged
with leukemia, her spleen virtually heaving with leukemic cells. After a
few doses of the drug, Druker found her counts dropping precipitously,
then normalizing within one week. Other patients, treated by Sawyers at
UCLA and Talpaz in Houston, responded similarly, with blood counts
normalizing within a few weeks.</p>
<p>News of the drug spread quickly. The development of Gleevec
paralleled the birth of the patient chat room on the Internet; by 1999,
patients were exchanging information about trials online. In many cases,
it was patients who informed their doctors about Druker’s drug and then,
finding their own doctors poorly informed and incredulous, flew to
Oregon or Los Angeles to enroll themselves in the Gleevec trial.</p>
<p>Of the fifty-four patients who received high doses of the drug in the
initial phase I study, fifty-three showed a complete response within
days of starting Gleevec. Patients continued the medicine for weeks,
then months, and the malignant cells did not visibly return in the bone
marrow. Left untreated, chronic myeloid leukemia is only “chronic” by
the standards of leukemia: as the disease accelerates, the symptoms run
on a tighter, faster arc and most patients live only three to five
years. Patients on Gleevec experienced a palpable deceleration of their
disease. The balance between normal and malignant cells was restored. It
was an unsuppuration of blood.</p>
<p>By June 1999, with many of the original patients still in deep
remissions, Gleevec was evidently a success. This success continues;
Gleevec has become the standard of care for patients with CML.
Oncologists now use the phrases “pre-Gleevec era” and “post-Gleevec era”
when discussing this once-fatal disease. Hagop Kantarjian, the leukemia
physician at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, recently summarized
the impact of the drug on CML: “Before the year 2000, when we saw
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, we told them that they had a
very bad disease, that their course was fatal, their prognosis was poor
with a median survival of maybe three to six years, frontline therapy
was allogeneic transplant . . . and there was no second-line treatment.
. . . Today when I see a patient with CML, I tell them that the disease
is an indolent leukemia with an excellent prognosis, that they will
usually live their functional life span provided they take an oral
medicine, Gleevec, for the rest of their lives.”</p>
<p>CML, as Novartis noted, is hardly a scourge on public health, but
cancer is a disease of symbols. Seminal ideas begin in the far
peripheries of cancer biology, then ricochet back into more common forms
of the disease. And leukemia, of all forms of cancer, is often the seed
of new paradigms. This story began with leukemia in Sidney Farber’s
clinic in 1948, and it must return to leukemia. If cancer is in our
blood, as Varmus reminded us, then it seems only appropriate that we
keep returning, in ever-widening circles, to cancer of the blood.</p>
<p>The success of Druker’s drug left a deep impression on the field of
oncology. “When I was a youngster in Illinois in the 1950s,” Bruce
Chabner wrote in an editorial, “the world of sport was shocked by the
feat of Roger Bannister. . . . On May 6, 1954, he broke the four-minute
barrier in the mile. While improving upon the world record by only a few
seconds, he changed the complexion of distance running in a single
afternoon. . . . Track records fell like ripe apples in the late 50s and
60s. Will the same happen in the field of cancer treatment?”</p>
<p>Chabner’s analogy was carefully chosen. Bannister’s mile remains a
touchstone in the history of athletics not because Bannister set an
unbreachable record—currently, the fastest mile is a good fifteen
seconds under Bannister’s. For generations, four minutes was thought to
represent an intrinsic physiological limit, as if muscles could
inherently not be made to move any faster or lungs breathe any deeper.
What Bannister proved was that such notions about intrinsic boundaries
are mythical. What he broke permanently was not a limit, but the idea of
limits.</p>
<p>So it was with Gleevec. “It proves a principle. It justifies an
approach,” Chabner continued. “It demonstrates that highly specific,
non-toxic therapy is possible.” Gleevec opened a new door for cancer
therapeutics. The rational synthesis of a molecule to kill cancer
cells—a drug designed to specifically inactivate an oncogene—validated
Ehrlich’s fantasy of “specific affinity.” Targeted molecular therapy for
cancer was possible; one only needed to hunt for it by studying the deep
biology of cancer cells.</p>
<p>A final note: I said CML was a “rare” disease, and that was true in
the era before Gleevec. The incidence of CML remains unchanged from the
past: only a few thousand patients are diagnosed with this form of
leukemia every year. But the prevalence of CML—the number of patients
presently alive with the disease—has dramatically changed with the
introduction of Gleevec. As of 2009, CML patients treated with Gleevec
survive an average of thirty years after their diagnosis. Based on that
survival figure, Hagop Kantarjian estimates that within the next decade,
250,000 people will be living with CML in America, all of them on
targeted therapy. Druker’s drug will alter the national physiognomy of
cancer, converting a once-rare disease into a relatively common one.
(Druker jokes that he has achieved the perfect inversion of the goals of
cancer medicine: his drug has increased the prevalence of cancer in the
world.) Given that most of our social networks typically extend to about
one thousand individuals, each of us, on average, will know one person
with this leukemia who is being kept alive by a targeted anticancer
drug.</p>
<p>*Abl, too, was first discovered in a virus, and later found to be
present in human cells—again recapitulating the story of ras and src.
Once more, a retrovirus had “pirated” a human cancer gene and turned
into a cancer-causing virus.</p>

<li>Gleevec, the commercial name, is used here because it is more
familiar to patients. The scientific name for CGP57148 is imatinib. The
drug was also called STI571.</li>
