<h4 id="poisoning-the-atmosphere">Poisoning the Atmosphere</h4>
<p>What if this mixture do not work at all? . . .</p>
<p>What if it be a poison . . .?</p>
<p>—Romeo and Juliet</p>
<p>We shall so poison the atmosphere of the first act that no one of
decency shall want to see the play through to the end.</p>
<p>—James Watson, speaking about</p>
<p>chemotherapy, 1977</p>
<p>Every drug, the sixteenth-century physician Paracelsus once opined,
is a poison in disguise. Cancer chemotherapy, consumed by its fiery
obsession to obliterate the cancer cell, found its roots in the obverse
logic: every poison might be a drug in disguise.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1943, more than twenty-five years after the
yellow-crossed bombs had descended on Ypres, a fleet of Luftwaffe planes
flew by a group of American ships huddled in a harbor just outside Bari
in southern Italy and released a volley of shells. The ships were
instantly on fire. Unbeknown even to its own crew, one of the ships in
the fleet, the John Harvey, was stockpiled with seventy tons of mustard
gas stowed away for possible use. As the Harvey blew up, so did its
toxic payload. The Allies had, in effect, bombed themselves.</p>
<p>The German raid was unexpected and a terrifying success. Fishermen
and residents around the Bari harbor began to complain of the whiff of
burnt garlic and horseradishes in the breeze. Grimy, oil-soaked men,
mostly young American sailors, were dragged out from the water seizing
with pain and terror, their eyes swollen shut. They were given tea and
wrapped in blankets, which only trapped the gas closer to their bodies.
Of the 617 men rescued, 83 died within the first week. The gas spread
quickly over the Bari harbor, leaving an arc of devastation. Nearly a
thousand men and women died of complications over the next months.</p>
<p>The Bari “incident,” as the media called it, was a terrible political
embarrassment for the Allies. The injured soldiers and sailors were
swiftly relocated to the States, and medical examiners were secretly
flown in to perform autopsies on the dead civilians. The autopsies
revealed what the Krumbhaars had noted earlier. In the men and women who
had initially survived the bombing but succumbed later to injuries,
white blood cells had virtually vanished in their blood, and the bone
marrow was scorched and depleted. The gas had specifically targeted bone
marrow cells—a grotesque molecular parody of Ehrlich’s healing
chemicals.</p>
<p>The Bari incident set off a frantic effort to investigate war gases
and their effects on soldiers. An undercover unit, called the Chemical
Warfare Unit (housed within the wartime Office of Scientific Research
and Development) was created to study war gases. Contracts for research
on various toxic compounds were spread across research institutions
around the nation. The contract for investigating nitrogen mustard was
issued to two scientists, Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman, at Yale
University.</p>
<p>Goodman and Gilman weren’t interested in the “vesicant” properties of
mustard gas—its capacity to burn skin and membranes. They were
captivated by the Krumbhaar effect—the gas’s capacity to decimate white
blood cells. Could this effect, or some etiolated cousin of it, be
harnessed in a controlled setting, in a hospital, in tiny, monitored
doses, to target malignant white cells?</p>
<p>To test this concept, Gilman and Goodman began with animal studies.
Injected intravenously into rabbits and mice, the mustards made the
normal white cells of the blood and bone marrow almost disappear,
without producing all the nasty vesicant actions, dissociating the two
pharmacological effects. Encouraged, Gilman and Goodman moved on to
human studies, focusing on lymphomas—cancers of the lymph glands. In
1942, they persuaded a thoracic surgeon, Gustaf Lindskog, to treat a
forty-eight-year-old New York silversmith with lymphoma with ten
continuous doses of intravenous mustard. It was a one-off experiment but
it worked. In men, as in mice, the drug produced miraculous remissions.
The swollen glands disappeared. Clinicians described the phenomenon as
an eerie “softening” of the cancer, as if the hard carapace of cancer
that Galen had so vividly described nearly two thousand years ago had
melted away.</p>
<p>But the responses were followed, inevitably, by relapses. The
softened tumors would harden again and recur—just as Farber’s leukemias
had vanished then reappeared violently. Bound by secrecy during the war
years, Goodman and Gilman eventually published their findings in 1946,
several months before Farber’s paper on antifolates appeared in the
press.</p>
<p>Just a few hundred miles south of Yale, at the Burroughs Wellcome
laboratory in New York, the biochemist George Hitchings had also turned
to Ehrlich’s method to find molecules with a specific ability to kill
cancer cells. Inspired by Yella Subbarao’s anti-folates, Hitchings
focused on synthesizing decoy molecules that when taken up by cells
killed them. His first targets were precursors of DNA and RNA.
Hitchings’s approach was broadly disdained by academic scientists as a
“fishing expedition.” “Scientists in academia stood disdainfully apart
from this kind of activity,” a colleague of Hitchings’s recalled.
“[They] argued that it would be premature to attempt chemotherapy
without sufficient basic knowledge about biochemistry, physiology, and
pharmacology. In truth, the field had been sterile for thirty-five years
or so since Ehrlich’s work.”</p>
<p>By 1944, Hitchings’s fishing expedition had yet to yield a single
chemical fish. Mounds of bacterial plates had grown around him like a
molding, decrepit garden with still no sign of a promised drug. Almost
on instinct, he hired a young assistant named Gertrude Elion, whose
future seemed even more precarious than Hitchings’s. The daughter of
Lithuanian immigrants, born with a precocious scientific intellect and a
thirst for chemical knowledge, Elion had completed a master’s degree in
chemistry from New York University in 1941 while teaching high school
science during the day and performing her research for her thesis at
night and on weekends. Although highly qualified, talented, and driven,
she had been unable to find a job in an academic laboratory. Frustrated
by repeated rejections, she had found a position as a supermarket
product supervisor. When Hitchings found Trudy Elion, who would soon
become one of the most innovative synthetic chemists of her generation
(and a future Nobel laureate), she was working for a food lab in New
York, testing the acidity of pickles and the color of egg yolk going
into mayonnaise.</p>
<p>Rescued from a life of pickles and mayonnaise, Gertrude Elion leapt
into synthetic chemistry. Like Hitchings, she started off by hunting for
chemicals that could block bacterial growth by inhibiting DNA—but then
added her own strategic twist. Instead of sifting through mounds of
unknown chemicals at random, Elion focused on one class of compounds,
called purines. Purines were ringlike molecules with a central core of
six carbon atoms that were known to be involved in the building of DNA.
She thought she would add various chemical side chains to each of the
six carbon atoms, producing dozens of new variants of purine.</p>
<p>Elion’s collection of new molecules was a strange merry-go-round of
beasts. One molecule—2,6-diaminopurine—was too toxic at even low doses
to give the drug to animals. Another molecule smelled like garlic
purified a thousand times. Many were unstable, or useless, or both. But
in 1951, Elion found a variant molecule called 6-mercaptopurine, or
6-MP.</p>
<p>6-MP failed some preliminary toxicological tests on animals (the drug
is strangely toxic to dogs), and was nearly abandoned. But the success
of mustard gas in killing cancer cells had boosted the confidence of
early chemotherapists. In 1948, Cornelius “Dusty” Rhoads, a former army
officer, left his position as chief of the army’s Chemical Warfare Unit
to become the director of the Memorial Hospital (and its attached
research institute), thus sealing the connection between the chemical
warfare of the battlefields and chemical warfare in the body. Intrigued
by the cancer-killing properties of poisonous chemicals, Rhoads actively
pursued a collaboration between Hitchings and Elion’s lab at Burroughs
Wellcome and Memorial Hospital. Within months of having been tested on
cells in a petri dish, 6-MP was packaged off to be tested in human
patients.</p>
<p>Predictably, the first target was acute lymphoblastic leukemia—the
rare tumor that now occupied the limelight of oncology. In the early
1950s, two physician-scientists, Joseph Burchenal and Mary Lois Murphy,
launched a clinical trial at Memorial to use 6-MP on children with
ALL.</p>
<p>Burchenal and Murphy were astonished by the speedy remissions
produced by 6-MP. Leukemia cells flickered and vanished in the bone
marrow and the blood, often within a few days of treatment. But, like
the remissions in Boston, these were disappointingly temporary, lasting
only a few weeks. As with Farber’s anti-folates, there was only a
fleeting glimpse of a cure.</p>
