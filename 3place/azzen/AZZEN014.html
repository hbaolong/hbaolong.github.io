<h4 id="the-house-that-jimmy-built">The House That Jimmy Built</h4>
<p>Etymologically, patient means sufferer. It is not suffering as such
that is most deeply feared but suffering that degrades.</p>
<p>—Susan Sontag, Illness as Metaphor</p>
<p>Sidney Farber’s entire purpose consists only of “hopeless cases.”</p>
<p>—Medical World News,</p>
<p>November 25, 1966</p>
<p>There was a time when Sidney Farber had joked about the smallness of
his laboratory. “One assistant and ten thousand mice,” he had called it.
In fact, his entire medical life could have been measured in single
digits. One room, the size of a chemist’s closet, stuffed into the
basement of a hospital. One drug, aminopterin, which sometimes briefly
extended the life of a child with leukemia. One remission in five, the
longest lasting no longer than one year.</p>
<p>By the early months of 1951, however, Farber’s work was growing
exponentially, moving far beyond the reaches of his old laboratory. His
outpatient clinic, thronged by parents and their children, had to be
moved outside the hospital to larger quarters in a residential apartment
building on the corner of Binney Street and Longwood Avenue. But even
the new clinic was soon overloaded. The inpatient wards at Children’s
had also filled up quickly. Since Farber was considered an intruder by
many of the pediatricians at Children’s, increasing ward space within
the hospital was out of the question. “Most of the doctors thought him
conceited and inflexible,” a hospital volunteer recalled. At Children’s,
even if there was space for a few of his bodies, there was no more space
for his ego.</p>
<p>Isolated and angry, Farber now threw himself into fund-raising. He
needed an entire building to house all his patients. Frustrated in his
efforts to galvanize the medical school into building a new cancer
center for children, he launched his own effort. He would build a
hospital in the face of a hospital.</p>
<p>Emboldened by his early fund-raising success, Farber devised
ever-larger drives for research money, relying on his glitzy retinue of
Hollywood stars, political barons, sports celebrities, and moneymakers.
In 1953, when the Braves franchise left Boston for Milwaukee, Farber and
Koster successfully approached the Boston Red Sox to make the Jimmy Fund
their official charity.</p>
<p>Farber soon found yet another famous recruit: Ted Williams—a young
ballplayer of celluloid glamour—who had just returned after serving in
the Korean War. In August 1953, the Jimmy Fund planned a “Welcome Home,
Ted” party for Williams, a massive fund-raising bash with a dinner
billed at 00 per plate that raised 50,000. By the end of that year,
Williams was a regular visitor at Farber’s clinic, often trailing a
retinue of tabloid photographers seeking pictures of the great
ballplayer with a young cancer patient.</p>
<p>The Jimmy Fund became a household name and a household cause. A
large, white “piggy bank” for donations (shaped like an enormous
baseball) was placed outside the Statler Hotel. Advertisements for the
Children’s Cancer Research Fund were plastered across billboards
throughout Boston. Countless red-and-white collection canisters—called
“Jimmy’s cans”—sprouted up outside movie theaters. Funds poured in from
sources large and small: 00,000 from the NCI, ,000 from a bean supper in
Boston, 11 from a lemonade stand, a few dollars from a children’s circus
in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>By the early summer of 1952, Farber’s new building, a large, solid
cube perched on the edge of Binney Street, just off Longwood Avenue, was
almost ready. It was lean, functional, and modern—self-consciously
distinct from the marbled columns and gargoyles of the hospitals around
it. One could see the obsessive hand of Farber in the details. A product
of the 1930s, Farber was instinctively frugal (“You can take the child
out of the Depression, but you can’t take the Depression out of the
child,” Leonard Lauder liked to say about his generation), but with
Jimmy’s Clinic, Farber pulled out all the stops. The wide cement steps
leading up to the front foyer—graded by only an inch, so that children
could easily climb them—were steam-heated against the brutal Boston
blizzards that had nearly stopped Farber’s work five winters before.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the clean, well-lit waiting room had whirring carousels and
boxes full of toys. A toy electric train, set into a stone “mountain,”
chugged on its tracks. A television set was embedded on the face of the
model mountain. “If a little girl got attached to a doll,” Time reported
in 1952, “she could keep it; there were more where it came from.” A
library was filled with hundreds of books, three rocking horses, and two
bicycles. Instead of the usual portraits of dead professors that haunted
the corridors of the neighboring hospitals, Farber commissioned an
artist to paint full-size pictures of fairy-book characters—Snow White,
Pinocchio, and Jiminy Cricket. It was Disney World fused with
Cancerland.</p>
<p>The fanfare and pomp might have led a casual viewer to assume that
Farber had almost found his cure for leukemia, and the brand-new clinic
was his victory lap. But in truth his goal—a cure for leukemia—still
eluded him. His Boston group had now added another drug, a steroid, to
their antileukemia regimen, and by assiduously combining steroids and
antifolates, the remissions had been stretched out by several months.
But despite the most aggressive therapy, the leukemia cells eventually
grew resistant and recurred, often furiously. The children who played
with the dolls and toy trains in the bright rooms downstairs were
inevitably brought back to the glum wards in the hospital, delirious or
comatose and in terminal agony.</p>
<p>One woman whose child was treated for cancer in Farber’s clinic in
the early fifties wrote, “Once I discover that almost all the children I
see are doomed to die within a few months, I never cease to be
astonished by the cheerful atmosphere that generally prevails. True,
upon closer examination, the parents’ eyes look suspiciously bright with
tears shed and unshed. Some of the children’s robust looks, I find, are
owing to one of the antileukemia drugs that produces a swelling of the
body. And there are children with scars, children with horrible
swellings on different parts of their bodies, children missing a limb,
children with shaven heads, looking pale and wan, clearly as a result of
recent surgery, children limping or in wheelchairs, children coughing,
and children emaciated.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the closer one looked, the more sharply the reality hit.
Ensconced in his new, airy building, with dozens of assistants swirling
around him, Farber must have been haunted by that inescapable fact. He
was trapped in his own waiting room, still looking for yet another drug
to eke out a few more months of remission in his children. His
patients—having walked up the fancy steamed stairs to his office, having
pranced around on the musical carousel and immersed themselves in the
cartoonish gleam of happiness—would die, just as inexorably, of the same
kinds of cancer that had killed them in 1947.</p>
<p>But for Farber, the lengthening, deepening remissions bore quite
another message: he needed to expand his efforts even further to launch
a concerted battle against leukemia. “Acute leukemia,” he wrote in 1953,
has “responded to a more marked degree than any other form of cancer . .
. to the new chemicals that have been developed within the last few
years. Prolongation of life, amelioration of symptoms, and a return to a
far happier and even a normal life for weeks and many months have been
produced by their use.”</p>
<p>Farber needed a means to stimulate and fund the effort to find even
more powerful antileukemia drugs. “We are pushing ahead as fast as
possible,” he wrote in another letter—but it was not quite fast enough
for him. The money that he had raised in Boston “has dwindled to a
disturbingly small amount,” he noted. He needed a larger drive, a larger
platform, and perhaps a larger vision for cancer. He had outgrown the
house that Jimmy had built.</p>
<h2 id="part-two">PART TWO</h2>
<p>AN IMPATIENT WAR</p>
<p>Perhaps there is only one cardinal sin: impatience. Because of
impatience we were driven out of Paradise, because of impatience we
cannot return.</p>
<p>—Franz Kafka</p>
<p>The 325,000 patients with cancer who are going to die this year
cannot wait; nor is it necessary, in order to make great progress in the
cure of cancer, for us to have the full solution of all the problems of
basic research . . . the history of Medicine is replete with examples of
cures obtained years, decades, and even centuries before the mechanism
of action was understood for these cures.</p>
<p>—Sidney Farber</p>
<p>Why don’t we try to conquer cancer by America’s 200th birthday? What
a holiday that would be!</p>
