<h4 id="a-moon-shot-for-cancer">“A moon shot for cancer”</h4>
<p>The relationship of government to science in the post-war years is a
case in point. Without very much visible deliberation, but with much
solemnity, we have in little more than a decade elevated science to a
level of extraordinary influence in national policy; and now that it is
there, we are not very certain what to do with it.</p>
<p>—William Carey, 1963</p>
<p>What has Santa Nixon given us lately?</p>
<p>—New York Times, 1971</p>
<p>On December 9, 1969, on a chilly Sunday morning, a full-page
advertisement appeared in the Washington Post:*</p>
<p>Mr. Nixon: You can cure cancer.</p>
<p>If prayers are heard in Heaven, this prayer is heard the most:</p>
<p>“Dear God, please. Not cancer.”</p>
<p>Still, more than 318,000 Americans died of cancer last year.</p>
<p>This year, Mr. President, you have it in your power to begin to end
this curse.</p>
<p>As you agonize over the Budget, we beg you to remember the agony of
those 318,000 Americans. And their families.</p>
<p>. . . We ask a better perspective, a better way to allocate our money
to save hundreds of thousands of lives each year.</p>
<p>. . . Dr. Sidney Farber, Past President of the American Cancer
Society, believes: “We are so close to a cure for cancer. We lack only
the will and the kind of money and comprehensive planning that went into
putting a man on the moon.”</p>
<p>. . . If you fail us, Mr. President, this will happen:</p>
<p>One in six Americans now alive, 34,000,000 people, will die of cancer
unless new cures are found.</p>
<p>One in four Americans now alive, 51,000,000 people, will have cancer
in the future.</p>
<p>We simply cannot afford this.</p>
<p>A powerful image accompanied the text. Across the bottom of the page,
a cluster of cancer cells was loosely grouped into a mass. Some of these
cells were crumbling off that mass, sending a shower of metastatic
fingerlings through the text. The letters e and r in cancer had been
eaten through by these cells, like holes punched out in the bone by
breast cancer.</p>
<p>It is an unforgettable picture, a confrontation. The cells move
across the page, almost tumbling over each other in their frenzy. They
divide with hypnotic intensity; they metastasize in the imagination.
This is cancer in its most elemental form—naked, ghoulish, and
magnified.</p>
<p>The Times ad marked a seminal intersection in the history of cancer.
With it, cancer declared its final emergence from the shadowy interiors
of medicine into the full glare of public scrutiny, morphing into an
illness of national and international prominence. This was a generation
that no longer whispered about cancer. There was cancer in newspapers
and cancer in books, cancer in theater and in films: in 450 articles in
the New York Times in 1971; in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Cancer Ward, a
blistering account of a cancer hospital in the Soviet Union; in Love
Story, a 1970 film about a twenty-four-year-old woman who dies of
leukemia; in Bang the Drum Slowly, a 1973 release about a baseball
catcher diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease; in Brian’s Song, the story of
the Chicago Bears star Brian Piccolo, who died of testicular cancer. A
torrent of op-ed pieces and letters appeared in newspapers and
magazines. One man wrote to the Wall Street Journal describing how his
family had been “plunged into numb agony” when his son was diagnosed
with cancer. “Cancer changes your life,” a patient wrote after her
mastectomy. “It alters your habits. . . . Everything becomes
magnified.”</p>
<p>There is, in retrospect, something preformed in that magnification, a
deeper resonance—as if cancer had struck the raw strings of anxiety
already vibrating in the public psyche. When a disease insinuates itself
so potently into the imagination of an era, it is often because it
impinges on an anxiety latent within that imagination. AIDS loomed so
large on the 1980s in part because this was a generation inherently
haunted by its sexuality and freedom; SARS set off a panic about global
spread and contagion at a time when globalism and social contagion were
issues simmering nervously in the West. Every era casts illness in its
own image. Society, like the ultimate psychosomatic patient, matches its
medical afflictions to its psychological crises; when a disease touches
such a visceral chord, it is often because that chord is already
resonating.</p>
<p>So it was with cancer. As the writer and philosopher Renata Salecl
described it, “A radical change happened to the perception of the object
of horror” in the 1970s, a progression from the external to the
internal. In the 1950s, in the throes of the Cold War, Americans were
preoccupied with the fear of annihilation from the outside: from bombs
and warheads, from poisoned water reservoirs, communist armies, and
invaders from outer space. The threat to society was perceived as
external. Horror movies—the thermometers of anxiety in popular
culture—featured alien invasions, parasitic occupations of the brain,
and body snatching: It Came from Outer Space or The Man from Planet
X.</p>
<p>But by the early 1970s, the locus of anxiety—the “object of horror,”
as Salecl describes it—had dramatically shifted from the outside to the
inside. The rot, the horror—the biological decay and its concomitant
spiritual decay—was now relocated within the corpus of society and, by
extension, within the body of man. American society was still
threatened, but this time, the threat came from inside. The names of
horror films reflected the switch: The Exorcist; They Came from
Within.</p>
<p>Cancer epitomized this internal horror. It was the ultimate emergence
of the enemy from within—a marauding cell that crawled out of one’s own
body and occupied it from the inside, an internal alien. The “Big Bomb,”
a columnist wrote, was replaced by “the Big C”:</p>
<p>“When I was growing up in the 1950s, it was The Bomb. This thing, The
Bomb, belonged to a generation of war babies. . . . But we are fickle
even about fear. We seem to have dropped our bombphobia now without, in
any way, reducing the reasons for it. Cancer now leads this macabre hit
parade. The middle-sized children I know seem to think that death comes,
not with a bang but with a tumor. . . . Cancer is the obsession of
people who sense that disaster may not be a purposeful instrument of
public policy but a matter of accidental, random carelessness.”</p>
<p>These metaphorical shifts were more powerful, more pervasive, and
more influential than the Laskerites could even have imagined. The Times
ad represented a strategic realignment of power. By addressing their
letter to the president on behalf of “millions of Americans,” the
Laskerites performed a tactically brilliant about-face. In the past,
they had pleaded to the nation for funds for cancer. Now, as they
pleaded for the nation for a more coordinated attack on cancer, they
found themselves colossally empowered in the public imagination. The
cure for cancer became incorporated into the very fabric of the American
dream. “To oppose big spending against cancer,” one observer told the
historian James Patterson, was to “oppose Mom, apple pie, and the flag.”
In America, this was a triumvirate too powerful for even the president
to ignore.</p>
<p>Impatient, aggressive, and goal-driven, the president, Richard
Milhous Nixon, was inherently partial to impatient, aggressive, and
goal-driven projects. The notion of science as an open-ended search for
obscure truths bothered and befuddled him. Nixon often groused that
scientists didn’t “know a goddamn thing” about the management of
science. Nor was he particularly sympathetic to open-ended scientific
funding. Corn-fed and fattened on increasingly generous federal grants,
scientists (often called “nuts” or “bastards” by members of his
administration) were thought to have become arrogant and insular. Nixon
wanted them “to shape up.”</p>
<p>For Nixon, this “shaping up” meant wresting the control of science
out of the hands of academic “nutcases” and handing it over to a new
cadre of scientific bureaucrats—science managers who would bring
discipline and accountability to science. The replacement of Nixon’s
science adviser, Lee DuBridge, a scholarly, old-school atomic physicist
from Caltech, with Ed David, an impulsive, fast-paced
engineer-turned-manager from the Bell research labs, was meant as a
signal to the scientific community to get into shape. David was the
first presidential science adviser to emerge out of an industrial lab
and to have no direct connection with a university. His mandate was to
get an effective science operation that would redirect its energies
toward achieving defined national goals. What scientists needed—what the
public demanded—was not an “endless frontier” (à la Vannevar Bush) but a
discipline with pragmatic frontiers and well-defined ends.</p>
<p>Lasker’s job, then, was to convert the already converted. In 1969,
deploying her typical strategic genius, Mary Lasker proposed that a
“neutral” committee of experts, called a Commission on the Conquest of
Cancer, be created to advise the president on the most efficient
strategy to mount a systematic response to cancer. The commission, she
wrote, should “include space scientists, industrialists, administrators,
planners, and cancer research specialists . . . entrusted to outline the
possibilities for the conquest of cancer for the Congress of the United
States at whatever cost.”</p>
<p>Of course, Lasker ensured that there was nothing neutral about the
commission (eventually called the Panel of Consultants). Its members,
chosen with exquisite deliberateness, were all Lasker’s friends,
associates, and sympathizers—men and women already sold on the War on
Cancer. Sidney Farber was selected as the cochairman, along with Senator
Ralph Yarborough from Texas (Yarborough, like Lister Hill, was one of
the Laskers’ oldest allies in Congress). Solomon Garb was appointed on
account of his book. Joseph Burchenal was brought in from Memorial
Hospital, James Holland from Roswell Park, Henry Kaplan from Stanford.
Benno Schmidt, a partner in a prominent New York investment firm and a
major donor to Memorial Hospital, joined the group. (An energetic
organizer, Schmidt was eventually asked to replace Farber and Yarborough
to head the panel; that Schmidt was a Republican and a close confidant
of President Nixon’s was a marked plus.) Politics, science, medicine,
and finance were thus melded together to craft a national response. To
reinforce the facade of neutrality, Yarborough wrote to Mary Lasker in
the summer of 1970, “asking” her to join (although he scribbled at the
bottom, “Your letter should have been the first mailed. It was your
genius, energy and will to help.”)</p>
<p>The panel’s final report, entitled the National Program for the
Conquest of Cancer, was issued in the winter of 1970, and its
conclusions were predictable: “In the past, when the Federal Government
has desired to give top priority to a major scientific project of the
magnitude of that involved in the conquest of cancer, it has, on
occasion, with considerable success, given the responsibility for the
project to an independent agency.” While tiptoeing around the idea, the
panel was proposing the creation of an independent cancer agency—a NASA
for cancer.</p>
<p>The agency would start with a budget of 00 million, then its
allocations would increase by 00 million to 50 million per year, until,
by the mid-1970s, it would stand at billion. When Schmidt was asked if
he thought that the country could “afford such a program,” he was
unhesitant in his reply: “Not only can we afford the effort, we cannot
afford not to do it.”</p>
<p>On March 9, 1971, acting on the panel’s recommendations, Ted Kennedy
and Jacob Javits floated a Senate Bill—S 1828, the Conquest of Cancer
Act—to create a National Cancer Authority, an independent,
self-governing agency for cancer research. The director of the authority
would be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate—again
underscoring an extraordinary level of autonomy. (Usually,
disease-specific institutes, such as the National Heart Institute, were
overseen by the NIH.) An advisory board of eighteen members would report
back to Congress about progress on cancer. That panel would comprise
scientists, administrators, politicians, physicians—and, most
controversially, “lay individuals,” such as Lasker, Foote, and Bobst,
whose sole task would be to keep the public eye trained sharply on the
war. The level of funding, public scrutiny, and autonomy would be
unprecedented in the history of the NIH—and arguably in the history of
American science.</p>
<p>Mary Lasker was busy maneuvering behind the scenes to whip up support
for the Kennedy/Javits bill. In January 1971, she fired off a cavalcade
of letters to her various friends seeking support for the independent
cancer agency. In February, she hit upon another tactical gem: she
persuaded her close friend Ann Landers (her real name was Eppie
Lederer), the widely read advice columnist from Chicago, to publish a
column about cancer and the Kennedy bill, positioning it exactly at the
time that the vote was fermenting in the Senate.</p>
<p>Landers’s column appeared on April 20, 1971. It began solemnly, “Dear
Readers: If you are looking for a laugh today, you’d better skip Ann
Landers. If you want to be part of an effort that might save millions of
lives—maybe your own—please stay with me. . . . How many of us have
asked the question, ‘If this great country of ours can put a man on the
moon why can’t we find a cure for cancer?’”</p>
<p>Landers’s answer to that question—echoing the Laskerites—was that
cancer was missing not merely a medical cure but a political cure. “If
enough citizens let their senators know they want Bill S-34 passed, it
will pass. . . . Vote for S-34,” she pleaded. “And sign your name
please.”</p>
<p>Even Landers and Lasker were shocked by the ensuing “blizzard” of
mail. “I saw trucks arriving at the Senate,” the journalist Barbara
Walters recalled. Letters poured in by the bagful—about a million in
all—pushing the Senate mailroom to its breaking point. One senator wrote
that he received sixty thousand letters. An exasperated secretary
charged with sorting the mail hung up the sign IMPEACH ANN LANDERS on
her desk. Stuart Symington, the senator from Missouri, wrote to Landers
begging her to post another column advising people to stop writing.
“Please Eppie,” he begged, “I got the message.”</p>
<p>The Senate was also getting the message. In June 1971, a modified
version of the Kennedy/Javits bill appeared on the floor. On Wednesday
afternoon, July 7, after dozens of testimonies by scientists and
physicians, the motion was finally put to a vote. At five thirty that
evening, the votes were counted: 79 in favor and 1 against.</p>
<p>The swift and decisive victory in the Senate was precisely as the
Laskerites had planned it. The cancer bill was now destined for the
House, but its passage there promised to be a much tougher hurdle. The
Laskerites had few allies and little influence in the lower chamber. The
House wanted more testimony—and not just testimony from the Laskerites’
carefully curated panel. It solicited opinions from physicians,
scientists, administrators and policymakers—and those opinions, it
found, diverged sharply from the ones presented to the Senate. Philip
Lee, the former assistant secretary of health complained, “Cancer is not
simply an island waiting in isolation for a crash program to wipe it
out. It is in no way comparable to a moon shot—to a Gemini or an Apollo
program—which requires mainly the mobilization of money, men, and
facilities to put together in one imposing package the scientific
knowledge we already possess.” The Apollo mission and the Manhattan
Project, the two models driving this War on Cancer were both
technological achievements that stood on the shoulders of long and deep
scientific discoveries (atomic physics, fluid mechanics, and
thermodynamics). In contrast, even a cursory understanding of the
process that made cells become malignant was missing. Seizing on the
Laskerites’ favorite metaphor, Sol Spiegelman, the Columbia University
cancer scientist, argued, “An all-out effort at this time would be like
trying to land a man on the moon without knowing Newton’s laws of
gravity.” James Watson, who had discovered the structure of DNA,
unloosed a verbal rampage against the Senate bill. “Doing ‘relevant’
research is not necessarily doing ‘good’ research,” Watson would later
write. “In particular we must reject the notion that we will be lucky. .
. . Instead we will be witnessing a massive expansion of
well-intentioned mediocrity.”</p>
<p>Others argued that the notion of a targeted war on a particular
disease inevitably distracted from natural synergies with other arenas
of research, forcing cancer researchers to think “inside the box.” An
NIH administrator complained, “In a nutshell, [the act] states that all
NIH institutes are equal, but one [the NCI] is more equal than the
others.” Yet others argued that the metaphor of war would inevitably
become a distraction. It would whip up a froth of hype and hope, and the
letdown would be catastrophic. “I suspect there is trouble ahead for
research in cancer,” Irvine Page, the editor of a prominent scientific
journal wrote. “People have become impatient with what they take to be
lack of progress. Having seen what can be achieved by systems analysis,
directed research, and great coordinated achievements such as the moon
walk, they transfer the same thinking to the conquest of cancer all too
readily.” This bubble would inevitably burst if the cancer project
stalled or failed.</p>
<p>Nixon, meanwhile, had reached the edge of his patience. Elections
were fast approaching in 1972. Earlier that year, commentators such as
Bob Wiedrich from the Chicago Tribune had laid down the stakes: “If
Richard Milhous Nixon . . . can achieve these two giant goals—an end to
the war in Vietnam and defeat of the ravages of cancer—then he will have
carved for himself in the history of this nation a niche of Lincolnesque
proportions, for he will have done more than put a man on the moon.”</p>
<p>An end to the war in Vietnam was nowhere in sight, but a campaign
against cancer seemed vastly more tractable, and Nixon was willing to
force a cancer bill—any cancer bill—through Congress. When the
ever-resourceful Schmidt went to visit him in the Oval Office that fall
of 1971 (in part, to propose a compromise), Nixon reassured Schmidt that
he would finagle—or strong-arm—a solution: “Don’t worry about it. I’ll
take care of that.”</p>
<p>In November 1971, Paul Rogers, a Democrat in the House from Florida,
crafted a compromise cancer bill. In keeping with the Laskerites’
vision, Rogers’s bill proposed a vast increase in the budget for cancer
research. But in contrast to the Kennedy/Javits bill, it proposed to
sharply restrict the autonomy of the National Cancer Institute. There
would be no “NASA for cancer.” But given the vast increase in money, the
focused federal directive, and the staggering rise in hope and energy,
the rhetoric of a “war” on cancer would still be fully justified. The
Laskerites, their critics, and Nixon would all go home happy.</p>
<p>In December 1971, the House finally put a modified version of
Rogers’s bill to a vote. The verdict was nearly unanimous: 350 votes for
and 5 against. A week later, a House-Senate meeting resolved minor
differences in their bills, and the final legislation was sent to the
president to sign.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1971, on a cold, windswept afternoon in Washington,
Nixon signed the National Cancer Act at a small ceremony in the White
House. The doors to the State Dining Room were thrown open, and the
president seated himself at a small wooden desk. Photographers parried
for positions on the floor around the desk. Nixon leaned over and signed
the act with a quick flourish. He handed the pen as a gift to Benno
Schmidt, the chair of the Panel of Consultants. Mary Lasker beamed
forcefully from her chair. Farber chose not to attend.</p>
<p>For the Laskerites, the date marked a bittersweet vindication. The
flood of money authorized for cancer research and control—00 million for
1972; 00 million for 1973; and 00 million for 1974 (a total of .5
billion over the next three years)—was a monumental achievement. If
money was “frozen energy,” as Mary Lasker often described it, then this,
at last, was a pot of energy to be brought to full boil.</p>
<p>But the passage of the bill had also been a reality check. The
overwhelming opinion among scientists (outside those on the Panel of
Consultants) was that this was a premature attack on cancer. Mary Lasker
was bitingly critical of the final outcome. The new bill, she told a
reporter, “contained nothing that was useful that gave any guts to the
Senate bill.”</p>
<p>Humiliated by the defeat, Lasker and Sidney Farber withdrew soon
after the House vote from the political world of cancer. Farber went
back to Boston and nursed his wounds privately. Lasker retired to her
museum-like apartment on Beekman Place in New York—a white box filled
with white furniture—and switched the focus of her efforts from cancer
to urban beautification projects. She would continue to actively
campaign in Washington for health-related legislation and award the
Lasker Prize, an annual award given to researchers for breakthroughs in
medicine and biological sciences. But the insistent, urgent vigor that
she had summoned during the two-decade campaign for a War on Cancer, the
near-molten energy capable of flowing into any federal agency and
annihilating resistance in its course, dissipated slowly. In April 1974,
a young journalist went to Lasker to ask her about one of her many
tulip-planting proposals for New York. At the end of the interview, the
reporter asked Lasker about her perception of her own power: was she not
one of the most powerful women in the country? Lasker cut the journalist
short: “Powerful? I don’t know. No. If I were really powerful, I’d have
gotten more done.”</p>
<p>Scientists, too, withdrew from the war—in part, because they had
little to contribute to it. The rhetoric of this war implied that its
tools, its weapons, its army, its target, and its strategy had already
been assembled. Science, the discovery of the unknown, was pushed to the
peripheries of this battle. Massive, intensively funded clinical trials
with combinations of cell-killing drugs would be heavily prioritized.
The quest for universal causes and universal solutions—cancer viruses
among them—would be highly funded. “We will in a relatively short period
of time make vast inroads on the cancer problem,” Farber had announced
to Congress in 1970. His army was now “on the march,” even if he and
Mary Lasker had personally extricated themselves from its front
lines.</p>
<p>The act, then, was an anomaly, designed explicitly to please all of
its clients, but unable to satisfy any of them. The NIH, the Laskerites,
scientists, lobbyists, administrators, and politicians—each for his or
her own reasons—felt that what had been crafted was either precisely too
little or precisely too much. Its most ominous assessment came from the
editorial pages of the Chicago Tribune: “A crash program can produce
only one result: a crash.”</p>
<p>On March 30, 1973, in the late afternoon, a code call, a signal
denoting the highest medical emergency, rang through the floors of the
Jimmy Fund Building. It sounded urgently through the open doors of the
children’s clinic, past the corridors with the cartoon portraits on the
walls and the ward beds lined with white sheets and children with
intravenous lines, all the way to the Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
where Farber had trained as an intern—in a sense retracing the
trajectory of his life.</p>
<p>A group of doctors and nurses in scrubs swung out toward the stairs.
The journey took a little longer than usual because their destination
was on the far end of the hospital, up on the eighth floor. In the room
with tall, airy windows, they found Farber with his face resting on his
desk. He had died of a cardiac arrest. His last hours had been spent
discussing the future of the Jimmy Fund and the direction of the War on
Cancer. His papers were neatly arranged in the shelves all around him,
from his first book on the postmortem examination to the most recent
article on advances in leukemia therapy, which had arrived that very
week.</p>
<p>Obituaries poured out from every corner of the world. Mary Lasker’s
was possibly the most succinct and heartfelt, for she had lost not just
her friend but a part of herself. “Surely,” she wrote, “the world will
never be the same.”</p>
<p>From the fellows’ office at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, just a
few hundred feet across the street from where Farber had collapsed in
his office, I called Carla Reed. It was August 2005, a warm, muggy
morning in Boston. A child’s voice answered the phone, then I was put on
hold. In the background I could hear the white noise of a household in
full tilt: crockery, doorbells, alarms, the radio blaring morning news.
Carla came on the phone, her voice suddenly tightening as she recognized
mine.</p>
<p>“I have news,” I said quickly, “good news.”</p>
<p>Her bone marrow results had just returned. A few nodules of normal
blood cells were growing back interspersed between cobblestones of bone
and fat cells—signs of a regenerating marrow reclaiming its space. But
there was no trace of leukemia anywhere. Under the microscope, what had
once been lost to cancer was slowly returning to normalcy. This was the
first of many milestones that we would cross together, a moment of
celebration.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Carla,” I said. “You are in a full remission.”</p>
<p><em>It would run in the New York Times on December 17.</em></p>

<p>Oft expectation fails, and most oft there</p>
<p>Where most it promises; and oft it hits</p>
<p>Where hope is coldest, and despair most sits</p>
<p>—William Shakespeare,</p>
<p>All’s Well That Ends Well</p>

<p>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,</p>

<p>You are absolutely correct, of course, when you say that we can’t go
on asking for more money from the President unless we demonstrate
progress.</p>
