<h4 id="remote-sympathy">“Remote Sympathy”</h4>
<p>In treating of cancer, we shall remark, that little or no confidence
should be placed either in internal . . . remedies, and that there is
nothing, except the total separation of the part affected.</p>
<p>—A Dictionary of Practical Surgery, 1836</p>
<p>Matthew Baillie’s Morbid Anatomy laid the intellectual foundation for
the surgical extractions of tumors. If black bile did not exist, as
Baillie had discovered, then removing cancer surgically might indeed rid
the body of the disease. But surgery, as a discipline, was not yet ready
for such operations. In the 1760s, a Scottish surgeon, John Hunter,
Baillie’s maternal uncle, had started to remove tumors from his patients
in a clinic in London in quiet defiance of Galen’s teachings. But
Hunter’s elaborate studies—initially performed on animals and cadavers
in a shadowy menagerie in his own house—were stuck at a critical
bottleneck. He could nimbly reach down into the tumors and, if they were
“movable” (as he called superficial, noninvasive cancers), pull them out
without disturbing the tender architecture of tissues underneath. “If a
tumor is not only movable but the part naturally so,” Hunter wrote,
“they may be safely removed also. But it requires great caution to know
if any of these consequent tumors are within proper reach, for we are
apt to be deceived.”</p>
<p>That last sentence was crucial. Albeit crudely, Hunter had begun to
classify tumors into “stages.” Movable tumors were typically
early-stage, local cancers. Immovable tumors were advanced, invasive,
and even metastatic. Hunter concluded that only movable cancers were
worth removing surgically. For more advanced forms of cancer, he advised
an honest, if chilling, remedy reminiscent of Imhotep’s: “remote
sympathy.”*</p>
<p>Hunter was an immaculate anatomist, but his surgical mind was far
ahead of his hand. A reckless and restless man with nearly maniacal
energy who slept only four hours a night, Hunter had practiced his
surgical skills endlessly on cadavers from every nook of the animal
kingdom—on monkeys, sharks, walruses, pheasants, bears, and ducks. But
with live human patients, he found himself at a standstill. Even if he
worked at breakneck speed, having drugged his patient with alcohol and
opium to near oblivion, the leap from cool, bloodless corpses to live
patients was fraught with danger. As if the pain during surgery were not
bad enough, the threat of infections after surgery loomed. Those who
survived the terrifying crucible of the operating table often died even
more miserable deaths in their own beds soon afterward.</p>
<p>In the brief span between 1846 and 1867, two discoveries swept away
these two quandaries that had haunted surgery, thus allowing cancer
surgeons to revisit the bold procedures that Hunter had tried to perfect
in London.</p>
<p>The first of these discoveries, anesthesia, was publicly demonstrated
in 1846 in a packed surgical amphitheater at Massachusetts General
Hospital, less than ten miles from where Sidney Farber’s basement
laboratory would be located a century later. At about ten o’clock on the
morning of October 16, a group of doctors gathered in a pitlike room at
the center of the hospital. A Boston dentist, William Morton, unveiled a
small glass vaporizer, containing about a quart of ether, fitted with an
inhaler. He opened the nozzle and asked the patient, Edward Abbott, a
printer, to take a few whiffs of the vapor. As Abbott lolled into a deep
sleep, a surgeon stepped into the center of the amphitheater and, with a
few brisk strokes, deftly made a small incision in Abbott’s neck and
closed a swollen, malformed blood vessel (referred to as a “tumor,”
conflating malignant and benign swellings) with a quick stitch. When
Abbott awoke a few minutes later, he said, “I did not experience pain at
any time, though I knew that the operation was proceeding.”</p>
<p>Anesthesia—the dissociation of pain from surgery—allowed surgeons to
perform prolonged operations, often lasting several hours. But the
hurdle of postsurgical infection remained. Until the mid-nineteenth
century, such infections were common and universally lethal, but their
cause remained a mystery. “It must be some subtle principle contained
[in the wound],” one surgeon concluded in 1819, “which eludes the
sight.”</p>
<p>In 1865, a Scottish surgeon named Joseph Lister made an unusual
conjecture on how to neutralize that “subtle principle” lurking
elusively in the wound. Lister began with an old clinical observation:
wounds left open to the air would quickly turn gangrenous, while closed
wounds would often remain clean and uninfected. In the postsurgical
wards of the Glasgow infirmary, Lister had again and again seen an angry
red margin begin to spread out from the wound and then the skin seemed
to rot from inside out, often followed by fever, pus, and a swift death
(a bona fide “suppuration”).</p>
<p>Lister thought of a distant, seemingly unrelated experiment. In
Paris, Louis Pasteur, the great French chemist, had shown that meat
broth left exposed to the air would soon turn turbid and begin to
ferment, while meat broth sealed in a sterilized vacuum jar would remain
clear. Based on these observations, Pasteur had made a bold claim: the
turbidity was caused by the growth of invisible
microorganisms—bacteria—that had fallen out of the air into the broth.
Lister took Pasteur’s reasoning further. An open wound—a mixture of
clotted blood and denuded flesh—was, after all, a human variant of
Pasteur’s meat broth, a natural petri dish for bacterial growth. Could
the bacteria that had dropped into Pasteur’s cultures in France also be
dropping out of the air into Lister’s patients’ wounds in Scotland?</p>
<p>Lister then made another inspired leap of logic. If postsurgical
infections were being caused by bacteria, then perhaps an antibacterial
process or chemical could curb these infections. It “occurred to me,” he
wrote in his clinical notes, “that the decomposition in the injured part
might be avoided without excluding the air, by applying as a dressing
some material capable of destroying the life of the floating
particles.”</p>
<p>In the neighboring town of Carlisle, Lister had observed sewage
disposers cleanse their waste with a cheap, sweet-smelling liquid
containing carbolic acid. Lister began to apply carbolic acid paste to
wounds after surgery. (That he was applying a sewage cleanser to his
patients appears not to have struck him as even the slightest bit
unusual.)</p>
<p>In August 1867, a thirteen-year-old boy who had severely cut his arm
while operating a machine at a fair in Glasgow was admitted to Lister’s
infirmary. The boy’s wound was open and smeared with grime—a setup for
gangrene. But rather than amputating the arm, Lister tried a salve of
carbolic acid, hoping to keep the arm alive and uninfected. The wound
teetered on the edge of a terrifying infection, threatening to become an
abscess. But Lister persisted, intensifying his application of carbolic
acid paste. For a few weeks, the whole effort seemed hopeless. But then,
like a fire running to the end of a rope, the wound began to dry up. A
month later, when the poultices were removed, the skin had completely
healed underneath.</p>
<p>It was not long before Lister’s invention was joined to the advancing
front of cancer surgery. In 1869, Lister removed a breast tumor from his
sister, Isabella Pim, using a dining table as his operating table, ether
for anesthesia, and carbolic acid as his antiseptic. She survived
without an infection (although she would eventually die of liver
metastasis three years later). A few months later, Lister performed an
extensive amputation on another patient with cancer, likely a sarcoma in
a thigh. By the mid-1870s, Lister was routinely operating on breast
cancer and had extended his surgery to the cancer-afflicted lymph nodes
under the breast.</p>
<p>Antisepsis and anesthesia were twin technological breakthroughs that
released surgery from its constraining medieval chrysalis. Armed with
ether and carbolic soap, a new generation of surgeons lunged toward the
forbiddingly complex anatomical procedures that Hunter and his
colleagues had once concocted on cadavers. An incandescent century of
cancer surgery emerged; between 1850 to 1950, surgeons brazenly attacked
cancer by cutting open the body and removing tumors.</p>
<p>Emblematic of this era was the prolific Viennese surgeon Theodor
Billroth. Born in 1821, Billroth studied music and surgery with almost
equal verve. (The professions still often go hand in hand. Both push
manual skill to its limit; both mature with practice and age; both
depend on immediacy, precision, and opposable thumbs.) In 1867, as a
professor in Berlin, Billroth launched a systematic study of methods to
open the human abdomen to remove malignant masses. Until Billroth’s
time, the mortality following abdominal surgery had been forbidding.
Billroth’s approach to the problem was meticulous and formal: for nearly
a decade, he spent surgery after surgery simply opening and closing
abdomens of animals and human cadavers, defining clear and safe routes
to the inside. By the early 1880s, he had established the routes: “The
course so far is already sufficient proof that the operation is
possible,” he wrote. “Our next care, and the subject of our next
studies, must be to determine the indications, and to develop the
technique to suit all kinds of cases. I hope we have taken another good
step forward towards securing unfortunate people hitherto regarded as
incurable.”</p>
<p>At the Allgemeines Krankenhaus, the teaching hospital in Vienna where
he was appointed a professor, Billroth and his students now began to
master and use a variety of techniques to remove tumors from the
stomach, colon, ovaries, and esophagus, hoping to cure the body of
cancer. The switch from exploration to cure produced an unanticipated
challenge. A cancer surgeon’s task was to remove malignant tissue while
leaving normal tissues and organs intact. But this task, Billroth soon
discovered, demanded a nearly godlike creative spirit.</p>
<p>Since the time of Vesalius, surgery had been immersed in the study of
natural anatomy. But cancer so often disobeyed and distorted natural
anatomical boundaries that unnatural boundaries had to be invented to
constrain it. To remove the distal end of a stomach filled with cancer,
for instance, Billroth had to hook up the pouch remaining after surgery
to a nearby piece of the small intestine. To remove the entire bottom
half of the stomach, he had to attach the remainder to a piece of
distant jejunum. By the mid-1890s, Billroth had operated on forty-one
patients with gastric carcinoma using these novel anatomical
reconfigurations. Nineteen of these patients had survived the
surgery.</p>
<p>These procedures represented pivotal advances in the treatment of
cancer. By the early twentieth century, many locally restricted cancers
(i.e., primary tumors without metastatic lesions) could be removed by
surgery. These included uterine and ovarian cancer, breast and prostate
cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. If these tumors were removed
before they had invaded other organs, these operations produced cures in
a significant fraction of patients.</p>
<p>But despite these remarkable advances, some cancers—even seemingly
locally restricted ones—still relapsed after surgery, prompting second
and often third attempts to resect tumors. Surgeons returned to the
operating table and cut and cut again, as if caught in a cat-and-mouse
game, as cancer was slowly excavated out of the human body piece by
piece.</p>
<p>But what if the whole of cancer could be uprooted at its earliest
stage using the most definitive surgery conceivable? What if cancer,
incurable by means of conventional local surgery, could be cured by a
radical, aggressive operation that would dig out its roots so
completely, so exhaustively, that no possible trace was left behind? In
an era captivated by the potency and creativity of surgeons, the idea of
a surgeon’s knife extracting cancer by its roots was imbued with promise
and wonder. It would land on the already brittle and combustible world
of oncology like a firecracker thrown into gunpowder.</p>

<li>Hunter used this term both to describe metastatic—remotely
disseminated—cancer and to argue that therapy was useless.</li>
