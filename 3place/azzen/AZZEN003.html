<h4 id="a-suppuration-of-blood">“A suppuration of blood”</h4>
<p>Physicians of the Utmost Fame</p>
<p>Were called at once; but when they came</p>
<p>They answered, as they took their Fees,</p>
<p>“There is no Cure for this Disease.”</p>
<p>—Hilaire Belloc</p>
<p>Its palliation is a daily task, its cure a fervent hope.</p>
<p>—William Castle,</p>
<p>describing leukemia in 1950</p>
<p>In a damp fourteen-by-twenty-foot laboratory in Boston on a December
morning in 1947, a man named Sidney Farber waited impatiently for the
arrival of a parcel from New York. The “laboratory” was little more than
a chemist’s closet, a poorly ventilated room buried in a half-basement
of the Children’s Hospital, almost thrust into its back alley. A few
hundred feet away, the hospital’s medical wards were slowly thrumming to
work. Children in white smocks moved restlessly on small wrought-iron
cots. Doctors and nurses shuttled busily between the rooms, checking
charts, writing orders, and dispensing medicines. But Farber’s lab was
listless and empty, a bare warren of chemicals and glass jars connected
to the main hospital through a series of icy corridors. The sharp stench
of embalming formalin wafted through the air. There were no patients in
the rooms here, just the bodies and tissues of patients brought down
through the tunnels for autopsies and examinations. Farber was a
pathologist. His job involved dissecting specimens, performing
autopsies, identifying cells, and diagnosing diseases, but never
treating patients.</p>
<p>Farber’s specialty was pediatric pathology, the study of children’s
diseases. He had spent nearly twenty years in these subterranean rooms
staring obsessively down his microscope and climbing through the
academic ranks to become chief of pathology at Children’s. But for
Farber, pathology was becoming a disjunctive form of medicine, a
discipline more preoccupied with the dead than with the living. Farber
now felt impatient watching illness from its sidelines, never touching
or treating a live patient. He was tired of tissues and cells. He felt
trapped, embalmed in his own glassy cabinet.</p>
<p>And so, Farber had decided to make a drastic professional switch.
Instead of squinting at inert specimens under his lens, he would try to
leap into the life of the clinics upstairs—from the microscopic world
that he knew so well into the magnified real world of patients and
illnesses. He would try to use the knowledge he had gathered from his
pathological specimens to devise new therapeutic interventions. The
parcel from New York contained a few vials of a yellow crystalline
chemical named aminopterin. It had been shipped to his laboratory in
Boston on the slim hope that it might halt the growth of leukemia in
children.</p>
<p>Had Farber asked any of the pediatricians circulating in the wards
above him about the likelihood of developing an antileukemic drug, they
would have advised him not to bother trying. Childhood leukemia had
fascinated, confused, and frustrated doctors for more than a century.
The disease had been analyzed, classified, subclassified, and subdivided
meticulously; in the musty, leatherbound books on the library shelves at
Children’s—Anderson’s Pathology or Boyd’s Pathology of Internal
Diseases—page upon page was plastered with images of leukemia cells and
appended with elaborate taxonomies to describe the cells. Yet all this
knowledge only amplified the sense of medical helplessness. The disease
had turned into an object of empty fascination—a wax-museum doll—studied
and photographed in exquisite detail but without any therapeutic or
practical advances. “It gave physicians plenty to wrangle over at
medical meetings,” an oncologist recalled, “but it did not help their
patients at all.” A patient with acute leukemia was brought to the
hospital in a flurry of excitement, discussed on medical rounds with
professorial grandiosity, and then, as a medical magazine drily noted,
“diagnosed, transfused—and sent home to die.”</p>
<p>The study of leukemia had been mired in confusion and despair ever
since its discovery. On March 19, 1845, a Scottish physician, John
Bennett, had described an unusual case, a twenty-eight-year-old
slate-layer with a mysterious swelling in his spleen. “He is of dark
complexion,” Bennett wrote of his patient, “usually healthy and
temperate; [he] states that twenty months ago, he was affected with
great listlessness on exertion, which has continued to this time. In
June last he noticed a tumor in the left side of his abdomen which has
gradually increased in size till four months since, when it became
stationary.”</p>
<p>The slate-layer’s tumor might have reached its final, stationary
point, but his constitutional troubles only accelerated. Over the next
few weeks, Bennett’s patient spiraled from symptom to symptom—fevers,
flashes of bleeding, sudden fits of abdominal pain—gradually at first,
then on a tighter, faster arc, careening from one bout to another. Soon
the slate-layer was on the verge of death with more swollen tumors
sprouting in his armpits, his groin, and his neck. He was treated with
the customary leeches and purging, but to no avail. At the autopsy a few
weeks later, Bennett was convinced that he had found the reason behind
the symptoms. His patient’s blood was chock-full of white blood cells.
(White blood cells, the principal constituent of pus, typically signal
the response to an infection, and Bennett reasoned that the slate-layer
had succumbed to one.) “The following case seems to me particularly
valuable,” he wrote self-assuredly, “as it will serve to demonstrate the
existence of true pus, formed universally within the vascular
system.”*</p>
<p>It would have been a perfectly satisfactory explanation except that
Bennett could not find a source for the pus. During the necropsy, he
pored carefully through the body, combing the tissues and organs for
signs of an abscess or wound. But no other stigmata of infection were to
be found. The blood had apparently spoiled—suppurated—of its own will,
combusted spontaneously into true pus. “A suppuration of blood,” Bennett
called his case. And he left it at that.</p>
<p>Bennett was wrong, of course, about his spontaneous “suppuration” of
blood. A little over four months after Bennett had described the
slater’s illness, a twenty-four-year-old German researcher, Rudolf
Virchow, independently published a case report with striking
similarities to Bennett’s case. Virchow’s patient was a cook in her
midfifties. White cells had explosively overgrown her blood, forming
dense and pulpy pools in her spleen. At her autopsy, pathologists had
likely not even needed a microscope to distinguish the thick, milky
layer of white cells floating above the red.</p>
<p>Virchow, who knew of Bennett’s case, couldn’t bring himself to
believe Bennett’s theory. Blood, Virchow argued, had no reason to
transform impetuously into anything. Moreover, the unusual symptoms
bothered him: What of the massively enlarged spleen? Or the absence of
any wound or source of pus in the body? Virchow began to wonder if the
blood itself was abnormal. Unable to find a unifying explanation for it,
and seeking a name for this condition, Virchow ultimately settled for
weisses Blut—white blood—no more than a literal description of the
millions of white cells he had seen under his microscope. In 1847, he
changed the name to the more academic-sounding “leukemia”—from leukos,
the Greek word for “white.”</p>
<p>Renaming the disease—from the florid “suppuration of blood” to the
flat weisses Blut—hardly seems like an act of scientific genius, but it
had a profound impact on the understanding of leukemia. An illness, at
the moment of its discovery, is a fragile idea, a hothouse
flower—deeply, disproportionately influenced by names and
classifications. (More than a century later, in the early 1980s, another
change in name—from gay related immune disease (GRID) to acquired immuno
deficiency syndrome (AIDS)—would signal an epic shift in the
understanding of that disease.*) Like Bennett, Virchow didn’t understand
leukemia. But unlike Bennett, he didn’t pretend to understand it. His
insight lay entirely in the negative. By wiping the slate clean of all
preconceptions, he cleared the field for thought.</p>
<p>The humility of the name (and the underlying humility about his
understanding of cause) epitomized Virchow’s approach to medicine. As a
young professor at the University of Würzburg, Virchow’s work soon
extended far beyond naming leukemia. A pathologist by training, he
launched a project that would occupy him for his life: describing human
diseases in simple cellular terms.</p>
<p>It was a project born of frustration. Virchow entered medicine in the
early 1840s, when nearly every disease was attributed to the workings of
some invisible force: miasmas, neuroses, bad humors, and hysterias.
Perplexed by what he couldn’t see, Virchow turned with revolutionary
zeal to what he could see: cells under the microscope. In 1838, Matthias
Schleiden, a botanist, and Theodor Schwann, a physiologist, both working
in Germany, had claimed that all living organisms were built out of
fundamental building blocks called cells. Borrowing and extending this
idea, Virchow set out to create a “cellular theory” of human biology,
basing it on two fundamental tenets. First, that human bodies (like the
bodies of all animals and plants) were made up of cells. Second, that
cells only arose from other cells—omnis cellula e cellula, as he put
it.</p>
<p>The two tenets might have seemed simplistic, but they allowed Virchow
to propose a crucially important hypothesis about the nature of human
growth. If cells only arose from other cells, then growth could occur in
only two ways: either by increasing cell numbers or by increasing cell
size. Virchow called these two modes hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In
hypertrophy, the number of cells did not change; instead, each
individual cell merely grew in size—like a balloon being blown up.
Hyperplasia, in contrast, was growth by virtue of cells increasing in
number. Every growing human tissue could be described in terms of
hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In adult animals, fat and muscle usually
grow by hypertrophy. In contrast, the liver, blood, the gut, and the
skin all grow through hyperplasia—cells becoming cells becoming more
cells, omnis cellula e cellula e cellula.</p>
<p>That explanation was persuasive, and it provoked a new understanding
not just of normal growth, but of pathological growth as well. Like
normal growth, pathological growth could also be achieved through
hypertrophy and hyperplasia. When the heart muscle is forced to push
against a blocked aortic outlet, it often adapts by making every muscle
cell bigger to generate more force, eventually resulting in a heart so
overgrown that it may be unable to function normally—pathological
hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Conversely, and importantly for this story, Virchow soon stumbled
upon the quintessential disease of pathological hyperplasia—cancer.
Looking at cancerous growths through his microscope, Virchow discovered
an uncontrolled growth of cells—hyperplasia in its extreme form. As
Virchow examined the architecture of cancers, the growth often seemed to
have acquired a life of its own, as if the cells had become possessed by
a new and mysterious drive to grow. This was not just ordinary growth,
but growth redefined, growth in a new form. Presciently (although
oblivious of the mechanism) Virchow called it neoplasia—novel,
inexplicable, distorted growth, a word that would ring through the
history of cancer.*</p>
<p>By the time Virchow died in 1902, a new theory of cancer had slowly
coalesced out of all these observations. Cancer was a disease of
pathological hyperplasia in which cells acquired an autonomous will to
divide. This aberrant, uncontrolled cell division created masses of
tissue (tumors) that invaded organs and destroyed normal tissues. These
tumors could also spread from one site to another, causing outcroppings
of the disease—called metastases—in distant sites, such as the bones,
the brain, or the lungs. Cancer came in diverse forms—breast, stomach,
skin, and cervical cancer, leukemias and lymphomas. But all these
diseases were deeply connected at the cellular level. In every case,
cells had all acquired the same characteristic: uncontrollable
pathological cell division.</p>
<p>With this understanding, pathologists who studied leukemia in the
late 1880s now circled back to Virchow’s work. Leukemia, then, was not a
suppuration of blood, but neoplasia of blood. Bennett’s earlier fantasy
had germinated an entire field of fantasies among scientists, who had
gone searching (and dutifully found) all sorts of invisible parasites
and bacteria bursting out of leukemia cells. But once pathologists
stopped looking for infectious causes and refocused their lenses on the
disease, they discovered the obvious analogies between leukemia cells
and cells of other forms of cancer. Leukemia was a malignant
proliferation of white cells in the blood. It was cancer in a molten,
liquid form.</p>
<p>With that seminal observation, the study of leukemias suddenly found
clarity and spurted forward. By the early 1900s, it was clear that the
disease came in several forms. It could be chronic and indolent, slowly
choking the bone marrow and spleen, as in Virchow’s original case (later
termed chronic leukemia). Or it could be acute and violent, almost a
different illness in its personality, with flashes of fever, paroxysmal
fits of bleeding, and a dazzlingly rapid overgrowth of cells—as in
Bennett’s patient.</p>
<p>This second version of the disease, called acute leukemia, came in
two further subtypes, based on the type of cancer cell involved. Normal
white cells in the blood can be broadly divided into two types of
cells—myeloid cells or lymphoid cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was
a cancer of the myeloid cells. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was
cancer of immature lymphoid cells. (Cancers of more mature lymphoid
cells are called lymphomas.)</p>
<p>In children, leukemia was most commonly ALL—lymphoblastic
leukemia—and was almost always swiftly lethal. In 1860, a student of
Virchow’s, Michael Anton Biermer, described the first known case of this
form of childhood leukemia. Maria Speyer, an energetic, vivacious, and
playful five-year-old daughter of a Würzburg carpenter, was initially
seen at the clinic because she had become lethargic in school and
developed bloody bruises on her skin. The next morning, she developed a
stiff neck and a fever, precipitating a call to Biermer for a home
visit. That night, Biermer drew a drop of blood from Maria’s veins,
looked at the smear using a candlelit bedside microscope, and found
millions of leukemia cells in the blood. Maria slept fitfully late into
the evening. Late the next afternoon, as Biermer was excitedly showing
his colleagues the specimens of “exquisit Fall von Leukämie” (an
exquisite case of leukemia), Maria vomited bright red blood and lapsed
into a coma. By the time Biermer returned to her house that evening, the
child had been dead for several hours. From its first symptom to
diagnosis to death, her galloping, relentless illness had lasted no more
than three days.</p>
<p>Although nowhere as aggressive as Maria Speyer’s leukemia, Carla’s
illness was astonishing in its own right. Adults, on average, have about
five thousand white blood cells circulating per milliliter of blood.
Carla’s blood contained ninety thousand cells per milliliter—nearly
twentyfold the normal level. Ninety-five percent of these cells were
blasts—malignant lymphoid cells produced at a frenetic pace but unable
to mature into fully developed lymphocytes. In acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, as in some other cancers, the overproduction of cancer cells
is combined with a mysterious arrest in the normal maturation of cells.
Lymphoid cells are thus produced in vast excess, but, unable to mature,
they cannot fulfill their normal function in fighting microbes. Carla
had immunological poverty in the face of plenty.</p>
<p>White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. Carla’s bone
marrow biopsy, which I saw under the microscope the morning after I
first met her, was deeply abnormal. Although superficially amorphous,
bone marrow is a highly organized tissue—an organ, in truth—that
generates blood in adults. Typically, bone marrow biopsies contain
spicules of bone and, within these spicules, islands of growing blood
cells—nurseries for the genesis of new blood. In Carla’s marrow, this
organization had been fully destroyed. Sheet upon sheet of malignant
blasts packed the marrow space, obliterating all anatomy and
architecture, leaving no space for any production of blood.</p>
<p>Carla was at the edge of a physiological abyss. Her red cell count
had dipped so low that her blood was unable to carry its full supply of
oxygen (her headaches, in retrospect, were the first sign of oxygen
deprivation). Her platelets, the cells responsible for clotting blood,
had collapsed to nearly zero, causing her bruises.</p>
<p>Her treatment would require extraordinary finesse. She would need
chemotherapy to kill her leukemia, but the chemotherapy would
collaterally decimate any remnant normal blood cells. We would push her
deeper into the abyss to try to rescue her. For Carla, the only way out
would be the way through.</p>
<p>Sidney Farber was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1903, one year after
Virchow’s death in Berlin. His father, Simon Farber, a former bargeman
in Poland, had immigrated to America in the late nineteenth century and
worked in an insurance agency. The family lived in modest circumstances
at the eastern edge of town, in a tight-knit, insular, and often
economically precarious Jewish community of shop owners, factory
workers, bookkeepers, and peddlers. Pushed relentlessly to succeed, the
Farber children were held to high academic standards. Yiddish was spoken
upstairs, but only German and English were allowed downstairs. The elder
Farber often brought home textbooks and scattered them across the dinner
table, expecting each child to select and master one book, then provide
a detailed report for him.</p>
<p>Sidney, the third of fourteen children, thrived in this environment
of high aspirations. He studied both biology and philosophy in college
and graduated from the University of Buffalo in 1923, playing the violin
at music halls to support his college education. Fluent in German, he
trained in medicine at Heidelberg and Freiburg, then, having excelled in
Germany, found a spot as a second-year medical student at Harvard
Medical School in Boston. (The circular journey from New York to Boston
via Heidelberg was not unusual. In the mid-1920s, Jewish students often
found it impossible to secure medical-school spots in America—often
succeeding in European, even German, medical schools before returning to
study medicine in their native country.) Farber thus arrived at Harvard
as an outsider. His colleagues found him arrogant and insufferable, but,
he too, relearning lessons that he had already learned, seemed to be
suffering through it all. He was formal, precise, and meticulous,
starched in his appearance and his mannerisms and commanding in
presence. He was promptly nicknamed Four-Button Sid for his propensity
for wearing formal suits to his classes.</p>
<p>Farber completed his advanced training in pathology in the late 1920s
and became the first full-time pathologist at the Children’s Hospital in
Boston. He wrote a marvelous study on the classification of children’s
tumors and a textbook, The Postmortem Examination, widely considered a
classic in the field. By the mid-1930s, he was firmly ensconced in the
back alleys of the hospital as a preeminent pathologist—a “doctor of the
dead.”</p>
<p>Yet the hunger to treat patients still drove Farber. And sitting in
his basement laboratory in the summer of 1947, Farber had a single
inspired idea: he chose, among all cancers, to focus his attention on
one of its oddest and most hopeless variants—childhood leukemia. To
understand cancer as a whole, he reasoned, you needed to start at the
bottom of its complexity, in its basement. And despite its many
idiosyncrasies, leukemia possessed a singularly attractive feature: it
could be measured.</p>
<p>Science begins with counting. To understand a phenomenon, a scientist
must first describe it; to describe it objectively, he must first
measure it. If cancer medicine was to be transformed into a rigorous
science, then cancer would need to be counted somehow—measured in some
reliable, reproducible way.</p>
<p>In this, leukemia was different from nearly every other type of
cancer. In a world before CT scans and MRIs, quantifying the change in
size of an internal solid tumor in the lung or the breast was virtually
impossible without surgery: you could not measure what you could not
see. But leukemia, floating freely in the blood, could be measured as
easily as blood cells—by drawing a sample of blood or bone marrow and
looking at it under a microscope.</p>
<p>If leukemia could be counted, Farber reasoned, then any
intervention—a chemical sent circulating through the blood, say—could be
evaluated for its potency in living patients. He could watch cells grow
or die in the blood and use that to measure the success or failure of a
drug. He could perform an “experiment” on cancer.</p>
<p>The idea mesmerized Farber. In the 1940s and ’50s, young biologists
were galvanized by the idea of using simple models to understand complex
phenomena. Complexity was best understood by building from the ground
up. Single-celled organisms such as bacteria would reveal the workings
of massive, multicellular animals such as humans. What is true for E.
coli [a microscopic bacterium], the French biochemist Jacques Monod
would grandly declare in 1954, must also be true for elephants.</p>
<p>For Farber, leukemia epitomized this biological paradigm. From this
simple, atypical beast he would extrapolate into the vastly more complex
world of other cancers; the bacterium would teach him to think about the
elephant. He was, by nature, a quick and often impulsive thinker. And
here, too, he made a quick, instinctual leap. The package from New York
was waiting in his laboratory that December morning. As he tore it open,
pulling out the glass vials of chemicals, he scarcely realized that he
was throwing open an entirely new way of thinking about cancer.</p>
<p>*Although the link between microorganisms and infection was yet to be
established, the connection between pus—purulence—and sepsis, fever, and
death, often arising from an abscess or wound, was well known to
Bennett.</p>
<ul>
<li>The identification of HIV as the pathogen, and the rapid spread of
the virus across the globe, soon laid to rest the initially observed—and
culturally loaded—“predeliction” for gay men.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Virchow did not coin the word, although he offered a comprehensive
description of neoplasia.</p>
<p>“A monster more insatiable than the guillotine”</p>
<p>The medical importance of leukemia has always been disproportionate
to its actual incidence. . . . Indeed, the problems encountered in the
systemic treatment of leukemia were indicative of the general directions

<p>There were few successes in the treatment of disseminated cancer. . .
. It was usually a matter of watching the tumor get bigger, and the
patient, progressively smaller.</p>
<p>—John Laszlo, The Cure of Childhood Leukemia: Into the Age of
Miracles</p>
<p>Sidney Farber’s package of chemicals happened to arrive at a
particularly pivotal moment in the history of medicine. In the late
1940s, a cornucopia of pharmaceutical discoveries was tumbling open in
labs and clinics around the nation. The most iconic of these new drugs
were the antibiotics. Penicillin, that precious chemical that had to be
milked to its last droplet during World War II (in 1939, the drug was
reextracted from the urine of patients who had been treated with it to
conserve every last molecule), was by the early fifties being produced
in thousand-gallon vats. In 1942, when Merck had shipped out its first
batch of penicillin—a mere five and a half grams of the drug—that amount
had represented half of the entire stock of the antibiotic in America. A
decade later, penicillin was being mass-produced so effectively that its
price had sunk to four cents for a dose, one-eighth the cost of a half
gallon of milk.</p>
<p>New antibiotics followed in the footsteps of penicillin:
chloramphenicol in 1947, tetracycline in 1948. In the winter of 1949,
when yet another miraculous antibiotic, streptomycin, was purified out
of a clod of mold from a chicken farmer’s barnyard, Time magazine
splashed the phrase “The remedies are in our own backyard,” prominently
across its cover. In a brick building on the far corner of Children’s
Hospital, in Farber’s own backyard, a microbiologist named John Enders
was culturing poliovirus in rolling plastic flasks, the first step that
culminated in the development of the Sabin and Salk polio vaccines. New
drugs appeared at an astonishing rate: by 1950, more than half the
medicines in common medical use had been unknown merely a decade
earlier.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more significant than these miracle drugs, shifts in
public health and hygiene also drastically altered the national
physiognomy of illness. Typhoid fever, a contagion whose deadly swirl
could decimate entire districts in weeks, melted away as the putrid
water supplies of several cities were cleansed by massive municipal
efforts. Even tuberculosis, the infamous “white plague” of the
nineteenth century, was vanishing, its incidence plummeting by more than
half between 1910 and 1940, largely due to better sanitation and public
hygiene efforts. The life expectancy of Americans rose from forty-seven
to sixty-eight in half a century, a greater leap in longevity than had
been achieved over several previous centuries.</p>
<p>The sweeping victories of postwar medicine illustrated the potent and
transformative capacity of science and technology in American life.
Hospitals proliferated—between 1945 and 1960, nearly one thousand new
hospitals were launched nationwide; between 1935 and 1952, the number of
patients admitted more than doubled from 7 million to 17 million per
year. And with the rise in medical care came the concomitant expectation
of medical cure. As one student observed, “When a doctor has to tell a
patient that there is no specific remedy for his condition, [the
patient] is apt to feel affronted, or to wonder whether the doctor is
keeping abreast of the times.”</p>
<p>In new and sanitized suburban towns, a young generation thus dreamed
of cures—of a death-free, disease-free existence. Lulled by the idea of
the durability of life, they threw themselves into consuming durables:
boat-size Studebakers, rayon leisure suits, televisions, radios,
vacation homes, golf clubs, barbecue grills, washing machines. In
Levittown, a sprawling suburban settlement built in a potato field on
Long Island—a symbolic utopia—“illness” now ranked third in a list of
“worries,” falling behind “finances” and “child-rearing.” In fact,
rearing children was becoming a national preoccupation at an
unprecedented level. Fertility rose steadily—by 1957, a baby was being
born every seven seconds in America. The “affluent society,” as the
economist John Galbraith described it, also imagined itself as eternally
young, with an accompanying guarantee of eternal health—the invincible
society.</p>
<p>But of all diseases, cancer had refused to fall into step in this
march of progress. If a tumor was strictly local (i.e., confined to a
single organ or site so that it could be removed by a surgeon), the
cancer stood a chance of being cured. Extirpations, as these procedures
came to be called, were a legacy of the dramatic advances of
nineteenth-century surgery. A solitary malignant lump in the breast,
say, could be removed via a radical mastectomy pioneered by the great
surgeon William Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the 1890s. With the
discovery of X-rays in the early 1900s, radiation could also be used to
kill tumor cells at local sites.</p>
<p>But scientifically, cancer still remained a black box, a mysterious
entity that was best cut away en bloc rather than treated by some deeper
medical insight. To cure cancer (if it could be cured at all), doctors
had only two strategies: excising the tumor surgically or incinerating
it with radiation—a choice between the hot ray and the cold knife.</p>
<p>In May 1937, almost exactly a decade before Farber began his
experiments with chemicals, Fortune magazine published what it called a
“panoramic survey” of cancer medicine. The report was far from
comforting: “The startling fact is that no new principle of treatment,
whether for cure or prevention, has been introduced. . . . The methods
of treatment have become more efficient and more humane. Crude surgery
without anesthesia or asepsis has been replaced by modern painless
surgery with its exquisite technical refinement. Biting caustics that
ate into the flesh of past generations of cancer patients have been
obsolesced by radiation with X-ray and radium. . . . But the fact
remains that the cancer ‘cure’ still includes only two principles—the
removal and destruction of diseased tissue [the former by surgery; the
latter by X-rays]. No other means have been proved.”</p>
<p>The Fortune article was titled “Cancer: The Great Darkness,” and the
“darkness,” the authors suggested, was as much political as medical.
Cancer medicine was stuck in a rut not only because of the depth of
medical mysteries that surrounded it, but because of the systematic
neglect of cancer research: “There are not over two dozen funds in the
U.S. devoted to fundamental cancer research. They range in capital from
about 00 up to about ,000,000, but their aggregate capitalization is
certainly not much more than ,000,000. . . . The public willingly spends
a third of that sum in an afternoon to watch a major football game.”</p>
<p>This stagnation of research funds stood in stark contrast to the
swift rise to prominence of the disease itself. Cancer had certainly
been present and noticeable in nineteenth-century America, but it had
largely lurked in the shadow of vastly more common illnesses. In 1899,
when Roswell Park, a well-known Buffalo surgeon, had argued that cancer
would someday overtake smallpox, typhoid fever, and tuberculosis to
become the leading cause of death in the nation, his remarks had been
perceived as a rather “startling prophecy,” the hyperbolic speculations
of a man who, after all, spent his days and nights operating on cancer.
But by the end of the decade, Park’s remarks were becoming less and less
startling, and more and more prophetic by the day. Typhoid, aside from a
few scattered outbreaks, was becoming increasingly rare. Smallpox was on
the decline; by 1949, it would disappear from America altogether.
Meanwhile cancer was already outgrowing other diseases, ratcheting its
way up the ladder of killers. Between 1900 and 1916, cancer-related
mortality grew by 29.8 percent, edging out tuberculosis as a cause of
death. By 1926, cancer had become the nation’s second most common
killer, just behind heart disease.</p>
<p>“Cancer: The Great Darkness” wasn’t alone in building a case for a
coordinated national response to cancer. In May that year, Life carried
its own dispatch on cancer research, which conveyed the same sense of
urgency. The New York Times published two reports on rising cancer
rates, in April and June. When cancer appeared in the pages of Time in
July 1937, interest in what was called the “cancer problem” was like a
fierce contagion in the media.</p>
<p>Proposals to mount a systematic national response against cancer had
risen and ebbed rhythmically in America since the early 1900s. In 1907,
a group of cancer surgeons had congregated at the New Willard Hotel in
Washington to create an organization to lobby Congress for more funds
for cancer research. By 1910, this organization, the American
Association for Cancer Research, had convinced President Taft to propose
to Congress a national laboratory dedicated to cancer research. But
despite initial interest in the plan, the efforts had stalled in
Washington after a few fitful attempts, largely because of a lack of
political support.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, a decade after Taft’s proposal had been tabled,
cancer research found a new and unexpected champion—Matthew Neely, a
dogged and ebullient former lawyer from Fairmont, West Virginia, serving
his first term in the Senate. Although Neely had relatively little
experience in the politics of science, he had noted the marked increase
in cancer mortality in the previous decade—from 70,000 men and women in
1911 to 115,000 in 1927. Neely asked Congress to advertise a reward of
million for any “information leading to the arrest of human cancer.”</p>
<p>It was a lowbrow strategy—the scientific equivalent of hanging a mug
shot in a sheriff’s office—and it generated a reflexively lowbrow
response. Within a few weeks, Neely’s office in Washington was flooded
with thousands of letters from quacks and faith healers purporting every
conceivable remedy for cancer: rubs, tonics, ointments, anointed
handkerchiefs, salves, and blessed water. Congress, exasperated with the
response, finally authorized 0,000 for Neely’s Cancer Control Bill,
almost comically cutting its budget back to just 1 percent of the
requested amount.</p>
<p>In 1937, the indefatigable Neely, reelected to the Senate, launched
yet another effort to launch a national attack on cancer, this time
jointly with Senator Homer Bone and Representative Warren Magnuson. By
now, cancer had considerably magnified in the public eye. The Fortune
and Time articles had fanned anxiety and discontent, and politicians
were eager to demonstrate a concrete response. In June, a joint
Senate-House conference was held to craft legislation to address the
issue. After initial hearings, the bill raced through Congress and was
passed unanimously by a joint session on July 23, 1937. Two weeks later,
on August 5, President Roosevelt signed the National Cancer Institute
Act.</p>
<p>The act created a new scientific unit called the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), designed to coordinate cancer research and education.*
An advisory council of scientists for the institute was assembled from
universities and hospitals. A state-of-the-art laboratory space, with
gleaming halls and conference rooms, was built among leafy arcades and
gardens in suburban Bethesda, a few miles from the nation’s capital.
“The nation is marshaling its forces to conquer cancer, the greatest
scourge that has ever assailed the human race,” Senator Bone announced
reassuringly while breaking ground for the building on October 3, 1938.
After nearly two decades of largely fruitless efforts, a coordinated
national response to cancer seemed to be on its way at last.</p>
<p>All of this was a bold, brave step in the right direction—except for
its timing. By the early winter of 1938, just months after the
inauguration of the NCI campus in Bethesda, the battle against cancer
was overshadowed by the tremors of a different kind of war. In November,
Nazi troops embarked on a nationwide pogrom against Jews in Germany,
forcing thousands into concentration camps. By late winter, military
conflicts had broken out all over Asia and Europe, setting the stage for
World War II. By 1939, those skirmishes had fully ignited, and in
December 1941, America was drawn inextricably into the global
conflagration.</p>
<p>The war necessitated a dramatic reordering of priorities. The U.S.
Marine Hospital in Baltimore, which the NCI had once hoped to convert
into a clinical cancer center, was now swiftly reconfigured into a war
hospital. Scientific research funding stagnated and was shunted into
projects directly relevant to the war. Scientists, lobbyists,
physicians, and surgeons fell off the public radar screen—“mostly
silent,” as one researcher recalled, “their contributions usually
summarized in obituaries.”</p>
<p>An obituary might as well have been written for the National Cancer
Institute. Congress’s promised funds for a “programmatic response to
cancer” never materialized, and the NCI languished in neglect. Outfitted
with every modern facility imaginable in the 1940s, the institute’s
sparkling campus turned into a scientific ghost town. One scientist
jokingly called it “a nice quiet place out here in the country. In those
days,” the author continued, “it was pleasant to drowse under the large,
sunny windows.”*</p>
<p>The social outcry about cancer also drifted into silence. After the
brief flurry of attention in the press, cancer again became the great
unmentionable, the whispered-about disease that no one spoke about
publicly. In the early 1950s, Fanny Rosenow, a breast cancer survivor
and cancer advocate, called the New York Times to post an advertisement
for a support group for women with breast cancer. Rosenow was put
through, puzzlingly, to the society editor of the newspaper. When she
asked about placing her announcement, a long pause followed. “I’m sorry,
Ms. Rosenow, but the Times cannot publish the word breast or the word
cancer in its pages.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” the editor continued, “you could say there will be a
meeting about diseases of the chest wall.”</p>
<p>Rosenow hung up, disgusted.</p>
<p>When Farber entered the world of cancer in 1947, the public outcry of
the past decade had dissipated. Cancer had again become a politically
silent illness. In the airy wards of the Children’s Hospital, doctors
and patients fought their private battles against cancer. In the tunnels
downstairs, Farber fought an even more private battle with his chemicals
and experiments.</p>
<p>This isolation was key to Farber’s early success. Insulated from the
spotlights of public scrutiny, he worked on a small, obscure piece of
the puzzle. Leukemia was an orphan disease, abandoned by internists, who
had no drugs to offer for it, and by surgeons, who could not possibly
operate on blood. “Leukemia,” as one physician put it, “in some senses,
had not [even] been cancer before World War II.” The illness lived on
the borderlands of illnesses, a pariah lurking between disciplines and
departments—not unlike Farber himself.</p>
<p>If leukemia “belonged” anywhere, it was within hematology, the study
of normal blood. If a cure for it was to be found, Farber reasoned, it
would be found by studying blood. If he could uncover how normal blood
cells were generated, he might stumble backward into a way to block the
growth of abnormal leukemic cells. His strategy, then, was to approach
the disease from the normal to the abnormal—to confront cancer in
reverse.</p>
<p>Much of what Farber knew about normal blood he had learned from
George Minot. A thin, balding aristocrat with pale, intense eyes, Minot
ran a laboratory in a colonnaded, brick-and-stone structure off Harrison
Avenue in Boston, just a few miles down the road from the sprawling
hospital complex on Longwood Avenue that included Children’s Hospital.
Like many hematologists at Harvard, Farber had trained briefly with
Minot in the 1920s before joining the staff at Children’s.</p>
<p>Every decade has a unique hematological riddle, and for Minot’s era,
that riddle was pernicious anemia. Anemia is the deficiency of red blood
cells—and its most common form arises from a lack of iron, a crucial
nutrient used to build red blood cells. But pernicious anemia, the rare
variant that Minot studied, was not caused by iron deficiency (indeed,
its name derives from its intransigence to the standard treatment of
anemia with iron). By feeding patients increasingly macabre
concoctions—half a pound of chicken liver, half-cooked hamburgers, raw
hog stomach, and even once the regurgitated gastric juices of one of his
students (spiced up with butter, lemon, and parsley)—Minot and his team
of researchers conclusively demonstrated in 1926 that pernicious anemia
was caused by the lack of a critical micronutrient, a single molecule
later identified as vitamin B12. In 1934, Minot and two of his
colleagues won the Nobel Prize for this pathbreaking work. Minot had
shown that replacing a single molecule could restore the normalcy of
blood in this complex hematological disease. Blood was an organ whose
activity could be turned on and off by molecular switches.</p>
<p>There was another form of nutritional anemia that Minot’s group had
not tackled, an anemia just as “pernicious”—although in the moral sense
of that word. Eight thousand miles away, in the cloth mills of Bombay
(owned by English traders and managed by their cutthroat local
middlemen), wages had been driven to such low levels that the mill
workers lived in abject poverty, malnourished and without medical care.
When English physicians tested these mill workers in the 1920s to study
the effects of this chronic malnutrition, they discovered that many of
them, particularly women after childbirth, were severely anemic. (This
was yet another colonial fascination: to create the conditions of misery
in a population, then subject it to social or medical
experimentation.)</p>
<p>In 1928, a young English physician named Lucy Wills, freshly out of
the London School of Medicine for Women, traveled on a grant to Bombay
to study this anemia. Wills was an exotic among hematologists, an
adventurous woman driven by a powerful curiosity about blood willing to
travel to a faraway country to solve a mysterious anemia on a whim. She
knew of Minot’s work. But unlike Minot’s anemia, she found that the
anemia in Bombay couldn’t be reversed by Minot’s concoctions or by
vitamin B12. Astonishingly, she found she could cure it with Marmite,
the dark, yeasty spread then popular among health fanatics in England
and Australia. Wills could not determine the key chemical nutrient of
Marmite. She called it the Wills factor.</p>
<p>Wills factor turned out to be folic acid, or folate, a vitamin-like
substance found in fruits and vegetables (and amply in Marmite). When
cells divide, they need to make copies of DNA—the chemical that carries
all the genetic information in a cell. Folic acid is a crucial building
block for DNA and is thus vital for cell division. Since blood cells are
produced by arguably the most fearsome rate of cell division in the
human body—more than 300 billion cells a day—the genesis of blood is
particularly dependent on folic acid. In its absence (in men and women
starved of vegetables, as in Bombay) the production of new blood cells
in the bone marrow halts. Millions of half-matured cells spew out,
piling up like half-finished goods bottlenecked in an assembly line. The
bone marrow becomes a dysfunctional mill, a malnourished biological
factory oddly reminiscent of the cloth factories of Bombay.</p>
<p>These links—between vitamins, bone marrow, and normal blood—kept
Farber preoccupied in the early summer of 1946. In fact, his first
clinical experiment, inspired by this very connection, turned into a
horrific mistake. Lucy Wills had observed that folic acid, if
administered to nutrient-deprived patients, could restore the normal
genesis of blood. Farber wondered whether administering folic acid to
children with leukemia might also restore normalcy to their blood.
Following that tenuous trail, he obtained some synthetic folic acid,
recruited a cohort of leukemic children, and started injecting folic
acid into them.</p>
<p>In the months that passed, Farber found that folic acid, far from
stopping the progression of leukemia, actually accelerated it. In one
patient, the white cell count nearly doubled. In another, the leukemia
cells exploded into the bloodstream and sent fingerlings of malignant
cells to infiltrate the skin. Farber stopped the experiment in a hurry.
He called this phenomenon acceleration, evoking some dangerous object in
free fall careering toward its end.</p>
<p>Pediatricians at Children’s Hospital were furious about Farber’s
trial. The folate analogues had not just accelerated the leukemia; they
had likely hastened the death of the children. But Farber was intrigued.
If folic acid accelerated the leukemia cells in children, what if he
could cut off its supply with some other drug—an antifolate? Could a
chemical that blocked the growth of white blood cells stop leukemia?</p>
<p>The observations of Minot and Wills began to fit into a foggy
picture. If the bone marrow was a busy cellular factory to begin with,
then a marrow occupied with leukemia was that factory in overdrive, a
deranged manufacturing unit for cancer cells. Minot and Wills had turned
the production lines of the bone marrow on by adding nutrients to the
body. But could the malignant marrow be shut off by choking the supply
of nutrients? Could the anemia of the mill workers in Bombay be
re-created therapeutically in the medical units of Boston?</p>
<p>In his long walks from his laboratory under Children’s Hospital to
his house on Amory Street in Brookline, Farber wondered relentlessly
about such a drug. Dinner, in the dark-wood-paneled rooms of the house,
was usually a sparse, perfunctory affair. His wife, Norma, a musician
and writer, talked about the opera and poetry; Sidney, of autopsies,
trials, and patients. As he walked back to the hospital at night,
Norma’s piano tinkling practice scales in his wake, the prospect of an
anticancer chemical haunted him. He imagined it palpably, visibly, with
a fanatic’s enthusiasm. But he didn’t know what it was or what to call
it. The word chemotherapy, in the sense we understand it today, had
never been used for anticancer medicines.* The elaborate armamentarium
of “antivitamins” that Farber had dreamed up so vividly in his fantasies
did not exist.</p>
<p>Farber’s supply of folic acid for his disastrous first trial had come
from the laboratory of an old friend, a chemist, Yellapragada
Subbarao—or Yella, as most of his colleagues called him. Yella was a
pioneer in many ways, a physician turned cellular physiologist, a
chemist who had accidentally wandered into biology. His scientific
meanderings had been presaged by more desperate and adventuresome
physical meanderings. He had arrived in Boston in 1923, penniless and
unprepared, having finished his medical training in India and secured a
scholarship for a diploma at the School of Tropical Health at Harvard.
The weather in Boston, Yella discovered, was far from tropical. Unable
to find a medical job in the frigid, stormy winter (he had no license to
practice medicine in the United States), he started as a night porter at
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, opening doors, changing sheets, and
cleaning urinals.</p>
<p>The proximity to medicine paid off. Subbarao made friends and
connections at the hospital and switched to a day job as a researcher in
the Division of Biochemistry. His initial project involved purifying
molecules out of living cells, dissecting them chemically to determine
their compositions—in essence, performing a biochemical “autopsy” on
cells. The approach required more persistence than imagination, but it
produced remarkable dividends. Subbarao purified a molecule called ATP,
the source of energy in all living beings (ATP carries chemical “energy”
in the cell), and another molecule called creatine, the energy carrier
in muscle cells. Any one of these achievements should have been enough
to guarantee him a professorship at Harvard. But Subbarao was a
foreigner, a reclusive, nocturnal, heavily accented vegetarian who lived
in a one-room apartment downtown, befriended only by other nocturnal
recluses such as Farber. In 1940, denied tenure and recognition, Yella
huffed off to join Lederle Labs, a pharmaceutical laboratory in upstate
New York, owned by the American Cyanamid Corporation, where he had been
asked to run a group on chemical synthesis.</p>
<p>At Lederle, Yella Subbarao quickly reformulated his old strategy and
focused on making synthetic versions of the natural chemicals that he
had found within cells, hoping to use them as nutritional supplements.
In the 1920s, another drug company, Eli Lilly, had made a fortune
selling a concentrated form of vitamin B12, the missing nutrient in
pernicious anemia. Subbarao decided to focus his attention on the other
anemia, the neglected anemia of folate deficiency. But in 1946, after
many failed attempts to extract the chemical from pigs’ livers, he
switched tactics and started to synthesize folic acid from scratch, with
the help of a team of scientists including Harriet Kiltie, a young
chemist at Lederle.</p>
<p>The chemical reactions to make folic acid brought a serendipitous
bonus. Since the reactions had several intermediate steps, Subbarao and
Kiltie could create variants of folic acid through slight alterations in
the recipe. These variants of folic acid—closely related molecular
mimics—possessed counterintuitive properties. Enzymes and receptors in
cells typically work by recognizing molecules using their chemical
structure. But a “decoy” molecular structure—one that nearly mimics the
natural molecule—can bind to the receptor or enzyme and block its
action, like a false key jamming a lock. Some of Yella’s molecular
mimics could thus behave like antagonists to folic acid.</p>
<p>These were precisely the antivitamins that Farber had been
fantasizing about. Farber wrote to Kiltie and Subbarao asking them if he
could use their folate antagonists on patients with leukemia. Subbarao
consented. In the late summer of 1947, the first package of antifolate
left Lederle’s labs in New York and arrived in Farber’s laboratory.</p>

fully captured the attention of oncologists or surgeons.</li>
