<h4 id="a-risky-prediction">A Risky Prediction</h4>
<p>They see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another, which
the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave.</p>
<p>—Plato</p>
<p>The philosopher of science Karl Popper coined the term risky
prediction to describe the process by which scientists verify untested
theories. Good theories, Popper proposed, generate risky predictions.
They presage an unanticipated fact or event that runs a real risk of not
occurring or being proven incorrect. When this unanticipated fact proves
true or the event does occur, the theory gains credibility and
robustness. Newton’s understanding of gravitation was most spectacularly
validated when it accurately presaged the return of Halley’s comet in
1758. Einstein’s theory of relativity was vindicated in 1919 by the
demonstration that light from distant stars is “bent” by the mass of the
sun, just as predicted by the theory’s equations.</p>
<p>By the late 1970s, the theory of carcinogenesis proposed by Varmus
and Bishop had also generated at least one such risky prediction. Varmus
and Bishop had demonstrated that precursors of
oncogenes—proto-oncogenes—existed in all normal cells. They had found
activated versions of the src proto-oncogene in Rous sarcoma virus. They
had suggested that mutations in such internal genes caused cancer—but a
crucial piece of evidence was still missing. If Varmus and Bishop were
right, then mutated versions of such proto-oncogenes must exist inside
cancer cells. But thus far, although other scientists had isolated an
assortment of oncogenes from retroviruses, no one had isolated an
activated, mutated oncogene out of a cancer cell.</p>
<p>“Isolating such a gene,” as the cancer biologist Robert Weinberg put
it, “would be like walking out of a cave of shadows. . . . Where
scientists had previously only seen oncogenes indirectly, they might see
these genes, in flesh and blood, living inside the cancer cell.”</p>
<p>Robert Weinberg was particularly concerned with getting out of
shadows. Trained as a virologist in an era of great virologists, he had
worked in Dulbecco’s lab at the Salk Institute in the sixties isolating
DNA from monkey viruses to study their genes. In 1970, when Temin and
Baltimore had discovered reverse transcriptase, Weinberg was still at
the bench, laboriously purifying genes out of monkey viruses. Six years
later, when Varmus and Bishop had announced the discovery of cellular
src, Weinberg was still purifying DNA from viruses. Weinberg felt as if
he was stuck in a perpetual penumbra, surrounded by fame but never
famous himself. The retrovirus revolution, with all its mysteries and
rewards, had quietly passed him by.</p>
<p>In 1972, Weinberg moved to MIT, to a small laboratory a few doors
down from Baltimore’s lab to study cancer-causing viruses. “The chair of
the department,” he said, “considered me quite a fool. A good fool. A
hardworking fool, but still a fool.” Weinberg’s lab occupied a sterile,
uninspiring space at MIT, in a sixties-style brutalist building served
by a single creaking elevator. The Charles River was just far enough to
be invisible from the windows, but just near enough to send freezing
puffs of wind through the quadrangle in the winter. The building’s
basement connected to a warren of tunnels with airless rooms where keys
were cut and machines repaired for other labs.</p>
<p>Labs, too, can become machines. In science, it is more often a
pejorative description than a complimentary one: an efficient,
thrumming, technically accomplished laboratory is like a robot orchestra
that produces perfectly pitched tunes but no music. By the mid-1970s,
Weinberg had acquired a reputation among his colleagues as a careful,
technically competent scientist, but one who lacked direction. Weinberg
felt his work was stagnating. What he needed was a simple, clear
question.</p>
<p>Clarity came to him one morning in the midst of one of Boston’s
infamously blinding blizzards. On a February day in 1978, walking to
work, Weinberg was caught in an epic snowstorm. Public transportation
had ground to a halt, and Weinberg, in a rubber hat and galoshes, had
chosen to plod across the blustering Longfellow Bridge from his home to
his lab, slowly planting his feet through the slush. The snow blotted
out the landscape and absorbed all sounds, creating a silent, hypnotic
interior. And as Weinberg crossed the frozen river, he thought about
retroviruses, cancer, and human cancer genes.</p>
<p>Src had been so easy to isolate and identify as a cancer-causing
gene, Weinberg knew, because Rous sarcoma virus possesses a measly four
genes. One could scarcely turn around in the retroviral genome without
bumping into an oncogene. A cancer cell, in contrast, has about twenty
thousand genes. Searching for a cancer-causing gene in that blizzard of
genes was virtually hopeless.</p>
<p>But an oncogene, by definition, has a special property: it provokes
unbridled cellular proliferation in a normal cell. Temin had used this
property in his cancer-in-a-dish experiment to induce cells to form
“foci.” And as Weinberg thought about oncogenes, he kept returning to
this essential property.</p>
<p>Of the twenty thousand genes in a cancer cell, Weinberg reasoned the
vast majority were likely normal and only a small minority were mutated
proto-oncogenes. Now imagine, for a moment, being able to take all
twenty thousand genes in the cancer cell, the good, the bad, the ugly,
and transferring them into twenty thousand normal cells, such that each
cell receives one of the genes. The normal, unmutated genes will have
little effect on the cells. But an occasional cell will receive an
oncogene, and, goaded by that signal, it will begin to grow and
reproduce insatiably. Reproduced ten times, these cells will form a
little clump on a petri dish; at twelve cell divisions, that clump will
form a visible “focus”—cancer distilled into its primordial, elemental
form.</p>
<p>The snowstorm was Weinberg’s catharsis; he had rid himself of
retroviruses. If activated oncogenes existed within cancer cells, then
transferring these genes into normal cells should induce these normal
cells to divide and proliferate. For decades, cancer biologists had
relied on Rous sarcoma virus to introduce activated src into cells and
thereby incite cell division. But Weinberg would bypass Rous’s virus; he
would determine if cancer-causing genes could be transferred directly
from cancer cells to normal cells. At the end of the bridge, with snow
still swirling around him, he found himself at an empty intersection
with lights still flashing. He crossed it, heading to the cancer
center.</p>
<p>Weinberg’s immediate challenge was technical: how might he transfer
DNA from a cancer cell to a population of normal cells? Fortunately,
this was one of the technical skills that he had so laboriously
perfected in the laboratory during his stagnant decade. His chosen
method of DNA transfer began with the purification of DNA from cancer
cells, grams of it precipitated out of cell extracts in a dense,
flocculent suspension, like curdled milk. This DNA was then sheared into
thousands of pieces, each piece carrying one or two genes. To transfer
this DNA into cells, he next needed a carrier, a molecule that would
slip DNA into the interior of a cell. Here, Weinberg used a trick. DNA
binds to the chemical calcium phosphate to form minuscule white
particles. These particles are ingested by cells, and as the cells
ingest these particles, they also ingest the DNA pieces bound to the
calcium phosphate. Sprinkled on top of a layer of normal cells growing
in a petri dish, these particles of DNA and calcium phosphate resemble a
snowglobe of swirling white flakes, the blizzard of genes that Weinberg
had so vividly imagined in his walk in Boston.</p>
<p>Once that DNA blizzard had been sprinkled on the cells and
internalized by them, Weinberg envisioned a simple experiment. The cell
that had received the oncogene would embark on unbridled growth, forming
the proliferating focus of cells. Weinberg would isolate such foci and
then purify the DNA fragment that had induced the proliferation. He
would thus capture a real human oncogene.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Chiaho Shih, a graduate student in Weinberg’s
lab, began to barrel his way through fifteen different mouse cancer
cells, trying to find a fragment of DNA that would produce foci out of
normal cells. Shih was laconic and secretive, with a slippery,
quicksilver temper, often paranoid about his experiments. He was also
stubborn: when he disagreed with Weinberg, colleagues recalled him
thickening his accent and pretending not to understand English, a
language he spoke with ease and fluency under normal circumstances. But
for all his quirks, Shih was also a born perfectionist. He had learned
the DNA transfection technique from his predecessors in the lab, but
even more important, he had an instinctive feel for his cells, almost a
gardener’s instinct to discriminate normal versus abnormal growth.</p>
<p>Shih grew enormous numbers of normal cells in petri dishes and
sprinkled them weekly with genes derived from his panel of cancer cells.
Plate after plate of transfected cells piled up in the laboratory. As
Weinberg had imagined in his walk across the river, Shih soon stumbled
upon a crucial early result. He found that transferring DNA from mouse
cancer cells invariably produced foci in normal cells, proof that
oncogenes could be discovered through such a method.*</p>
<p>Excited and mystified, Weinberg and Shih performed a bolder variant
of the experiment. Thus far they had been using mouse cancer cell lines
to obtain their DNA. Changing tactics and species, they moved on to
human cancer cells. “If we were going to trap a real oncogene so
laboriously,” Weinberg recalled, “we thought that we might as well find
it in real human cancers.” Shih walked over to the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute and carried back a cancer cell line derived from a patient,
Earl Jensen, a long-term smoker who had died of bladder cancer. DNA from
these cells was sheared into fragments and transfected into the normal
human cell line. Shih returned to his microscope, scouring plate after
plate for foci.</p>
<p>The experiment worked yet again. As with the mouse cancer cell lines,
prominent, disinhibited foci appeared in the dishes. Weinberg pushed
Shih to find the precise gene that could convert a normal cell to a
cancer cell. Weinberg’s laboratory was now racing to isolate and
identify the first native human oncogene.</p>
<p>He soon realized the race had other contenders. At the Farber, across
town, Geoff Cooper, a former student of Temin’s, had also shown that DNA
from cancer cells could induce transformation in cells. So had Michael
Wigler at the Cold Spring Harbor Lab in New York. And Weinberg, Cooper,
and Wigler had yet other competitors. At the NCI, a little-known Spanish
researcher named Mariano Barbacid had also found a fragment of DNA from
yet another cancer cell line that would transform normal cells. In the
late winter of 1981, all four laboratories rushed to the finish line. By
the early spring, each lab had found its sought-after gene.</p>
<p>In 1982, Weinberg, Barbacid, and Wigler independently published their
discoveries and compared their results. It was a powerful, unexpected
convergence: all three labs had isolated the same fragment of DNA,
containing a gene called ras, from their respective cancer cells.† Like
src, ras was also a gene present in all cells. But like src again, the
ras gene in normal cells was functionally different from the ras present
in cancer cells. In normal cells, the ras gene encoded a tightly
regulated protein that turned “on” and “off” like a carefully modulated
switch. In cancer cells, the gene was mutated, just as Varmus and Bishop
had predicted. Mutated ras encoded a berserk, perpetually hyperactive
protein permanently locked “on.” This mutant protein produced an
unquenchable signal for a cell to divide—and to keep dividing. It was
the long-sought “native” human oncogene, captured in flesh and blood out
of a cancer cell. “Once we had cloned a cancer gene,” Weinberg wrote,
“the world would be at our feet.” New insights into carcinogenesis, and
new therapeutic inroads would instantly follow. “It was,” as Weinberg
would later write, all “a wonderful pipe dream.”</p>
<p>In 1983, a few months after Weinberg had purified mutant ras out of
cancer cells, Ray Erikson traveled to Washington to receive the
prestigious General Motors prize for his research on src activity and
function. The other awardee that evening was Tom Frei, being honored for
his advancement of the cure for leukemia.</p>
<p>It was a resplendent evening. There was an elegant candlelit dinner
in a Washington banquet hall, followed by congratulatory speeches and
toasts. Scientists, physicians, and policymakers, including many of the
former Laskerites,* gathered around linen-covered tables. Talk turned
frequently to the discovery of oncogenes and the invention of curative
chemotherapy. But the two conversations seemed to be occurring in sealed
and separate universes, much as they had at Temin’s conference in
Houston more than a decade earlier. Frei’s award, for curing leukemia,
and Erikson’s award, for identifying the function of a critical
oncogene, might almost have been given to two unconnected pursuits. “I
don’t remember any enthusiasm among the clinicians to reach out to the
cancer biologists to synthesize the two poles of knowledge about
cancer,” Erikson recalled. The two halves of cancer, cause and cure,
having feasted and been feted together, sped off in separate taxis into
the night.</p>
<p>The discovery of ras brought one challenge to a close for cancer
geneticists: they had purified a mutated oncogene from a cancer cell.
But it threw open another challenge. Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis had
also generated a risky prediction: that retinoblastoma cancer cells
contained two inactivated copies of the Rb gene. Weinberg, Wigler, and
Barbacid had proved Varmus and Bishop right. Now someone had to prove
Knudson’s prediction by isolating his fabled tumor suppressor gene and
demonstrating that both its copies were inactivated in
retinoblastoma.</p>
<p>This challenge, though, came with an odd conceptual twist. Tumor
suppressor genes, by their very nature, are asserted in their absence.
An oncogene, when mutated, provides an “on” signal for the cells to
grow. A tumor suppressor gene when mutated, in contrast, removes an
“off” signal for growth. Weinberg and Chiaho Shih’s transfection assay
had worked because oncogenes can cause the normal cells to divide
uncontrollably, thus forming a focus of cells. But an anti-oncogene,
transfected into a cell, cannot be expected to create an “anti-focus.”
“How can one capture genes that behave like ghosts,” Weinberg wrote,
“influencing cells from behind some dark curtain?”</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, cancer geneticists had begun to glimpse shadowy
outlines behind retinoblastoma’s “dark curtain.” By analyzing
chromosomes from retinoblastoma cancer cells using the technique
pioneered by Janet Rowley, geneticists had demonstrated that the Rb gene
“lived” on chromosome thirteen. But a chromosome contains thousands of
genes. Isolating a single gene from that vast set—particularly one whose
functional presence was revealed only when inactive—seemed like an
impossible task. Large laboratories professionally equipped to hunt for
cancer genes—Webster Cavenee’s lab in Cincinnati, Brenda Gallie’s in
Toronto, and Weinberg’s in Boston—were frantically hunting for a
strategy to isolate Rb. But these efforts had reached a standstill. “We
knew where Rb lived,” Weinberg recalled, “but we had no idea what Rb
was.”</p>
<p>Across the Charles River from Weinberg’s lab, Thad Dryja, an
ophthalmologist-turned-geneticist, had also joined the hunt for Rb.
Dryja’s laboratory was perched on the sixth floor of the Massachusetts
Eye and Ear Infirmary—the Eyeball, as it was known colloquially among
the medical residents. The ophthalmological infirmary was well-known for
its clinical research on eye diseases, but was barely recognized for
laboratory-based research. Weinberg’s Whitehead Institute boasted the
power of the latest technologies, an army of machines that could
sequence thousands of DNA samples and powerful fluorescent microscopes
that could look down into the very heart of the cell. In contrast, the
Eyeball, with its proud display of nineteenth-century eyeglasses and
lenses in lacquered wooden vitrines, was almost self-indulgently
anachronistic.</p>
<p>Dryja, too, was an unlikely cancer geneticist. In the mid-1980s,
having completed his clinical fellowship in ophthalmology at the
infirmary in Boston, he had crossed town to the science laboratories at
Children’s Hospital to study the genetics of eye diseases. As an
ophthalmologist interested in cancer, Dryja had an obvious target:
retinoblastoma. But even Dryja, an inveterate optimist, was hesitant
about taking on the search for Rb. “Brenda [Gallie] and Web [Cavenee]
had both stalled in their attempts [to clone Rb]. It was a slow,
frustrating time.”</p>
<p>Dryja began his hunt for Rb with a few key assumptions. Normal human
cells, he knew, have two copies of every chromosome (except the sex
chromosomes), one from each parent, twenty-three pairs of chromosomes in
all, a total of forty-six. Every normal cell thus has two copies of the
Rb gene, one in each copy of chromosome thirteen.</p>
<p>Assuming Knudson was right in his two-hit hypothesis, every eye tumor
should possess two independent inactivating mutations in the Rb gene,
one in each chromosome. Mutations, Dryja knew, come in many forms. They
can be small changes in DNA that can activate a gene. Or they can be
large structural deletions in a gene, stretching over a large piece of
the chromosome. Since the Rb gene had to be inactivated to unleash
retinoblastoma, Dryja reasoned that the mutation responsible was likely
a deletion of the gene. Deleting a sizable piece of a gene, after all,
is perhaps the quickest, crudest way to paralyze and inactivate it.</p>
<p>In most retinoblastoma tumors, Dryja suspected, the two deletions in
the two copies of the Rb gene would lie in different parts of the gene.
Since mutations occur randomly, the chance of both mutations lying in
precisely the same region of the gene is a little akin to rolling double
sixes in dice that have one hundred faces. Typically, one of the
deletions would “hit” the front end of the gene, while the other
deletion might hit the back end (in both cases, the functional
consequences would be the same—inactivating Rb). The two “hits” in most
tumors would thus be asymmetric—affecting two different parts of the
gene on the two chromosomes.</p>
<p>But even hundred-headed dice, rolled many times, can yield double
sixes. Rarely, Dryja knew, one might encounter a tumor in which both
hits had deleted exactly the same part of the gene on the two sister
chromosomes. In that case, that piece of chromosome would be completely
missing from the cell. And if Dryja could find a method to identify a
completely missing piece of chromosome thirteen in a retinoblastoma
tumor cell, he would instantly land on the Rb gene. It was the simplest
of strategies: to hunt the gene with absent function, Dryja would look
for absence in structure.</p>
<p>To identify such a missing piece, Dryja needed structural mileposts
along chromosome thirteen—small pieces of DNA called probes, which were
aligned along the length of the chromosome. He could use these DNA
probes in a variant of the same “sticking” reaction that Varmus and
Bishop had used in the 1970s: if the piece of DNA existed in the tumor
cell, it would stick; if the piece did not exist, the probe would not
stick, identifying the missing piece in the cell. Dryja had assembled a
series of such probes. But more than probes, he needed a resource that
he uniquely possessed: an enormous bank of frozen tumors. The chances of
finding a shared deletion in the Rb gene in both chromosomes were slim,
so he would need to test a vast sample set to find one.</p>
<p>This, then, was his crucial advantage over the vast professional labs
in Toronto and Houston. Laboratory scientists rarely venture outside the
lab to find human samples. Dryja, a clinician, had a freezer full of
them. “I stored the tumors obsessively,” he said with the childlike
delight of a collector. “I put news out among patients and doctors that
I was looking for retinoblastoma cases. Every time someone saw a case,
they would say, ‘Get that guy Dryja.’ I would then drive or fly or even
walk to pick up the samples and bring them here. I even got to know the
patients by name. Since the disease ran in families, I would call them
at home to see if there was a brother or sister or cousin with
retinoblastoma. Sometimes, I would know [about a tumor] even before
doctors knew.”</p>
<p>Week after week, Dryja extracted the chromosomes from tumors and ran
his probe set against the chromosomes. If the probes bound, they usually
made a signal on a gel; if a probe was fully missing, the signal was
blank. One morning, having run another dozen tumors, Dryja came to the
lab and held up the blot against the window and ran his eyes left to
right, lane after lane automatically, like a pianist reading a score. In
one tumor, he saw a blank space. One of his probes—H3-8, he had called
it—was deleted in both chromosomes in that tumor. He felt the brief hot
rush of ecstasy, which then tipped into queasiness. “It was at that
moment that I had the feeling that we had a gene in our hands. I had
landed on retinoblastoma.”</p>
<p>Dryja had found a piece of DNA missing in tumor cells. Now he needed
to find the corresponding piece present in normal cells, thus isolating
the Rb gene. Perilously close to the end, Dryja was like an acrobat at
the final stretch of his rope. His one-room lab was taut with tension,
stretched to its limit. He had inadequate skills in isolating genes and
limited resources. To isolate the gene, he would need help, so he took
another lunge. He had heard that researchers in the Weinberg lab were
also hunting for the retinoblastoma gene. Dryja’s choices were stark: he
could either team up with Weinberg, or he could try to isolate the gene
alone and lose the race altogether.</p>
<p>The scientist in Weinberg’s lab trying to isolate Rb was Steve
Friend. A jovial, medically trained molecular geneticist with a quick
wit and an easy manner, Friend had casually mentioned his interest in Rb
to Dryja at a meeting. Unlike Dryja, working with his growing stash of
tumor samples, Friend had been building a collection of normal
cells—cells in which the Rb gene was completely intact. Friend’s
approach had been to find genes that were present in normal retinal
cells, then to try to identify ones that were abnormal in retinoblastoma
tumors—working backward toward Dryja.</p>
<p>For Dryja, the complementarity of the two approaches was obvious. He
had identified a missing piece of DNA in tumors. Could Friend and
Weinberg now pull the intact, full-length gene out of normal cells? They
outlined a potential collaboration between the two labs. One morning in
1985, Dryja took his probe, H3-8, and virtually ran across the
Longfellow Bridge (by now, the central highway of oncogenesis), carrying
it by hand to Friend’s bench at the Whitehead.</p>
<p>It took Friend a quick experiment to test Dryja’s probe. Using the
DNA “sticking” reaction again, Friend trapped and isolated the normal
cellular gene that stuck to the H3-8 probe. The isolated gene “lived” on
chromosome thirteen, as predicted. When Dryja further tested the
candidate gene through his bank of tumor samples, he found precisely
what Knudson had hypothesized more than a decade earlier: all
retinoblastoma cells contained inactivations in both copies of the
gene—two hits—while normal cells contained two normal copies of the
gene. The candidate gene that Friend had isolated was indisputably
Rb.</p>
<p>In October 1986, Friend, Weinberg, and Dryja published their findings
in Nature. The article marked the perfect complement to Weinberg’s ras
paper, the yin to its yang—the isolation of an activated proto-oncogene
(ras) and the identification of the anti-oncogene (Rb). “Fifteen years
ago,” Weinberg wrote, “Knudson provided a theoretical basis for
retinoblastoma tumorigenesis by suggesting that minimally two genetic
events are required to trigger tumor development.” Weinberg noted, “We
have isolated [a human gene] apparently representing one of this class
of genes”—a tumor suppressor.</p>
<p>What Rb does in normal cells is still an unfolding puzzle. Its name,
as it turns out, is quite a misnomer. Rb, retinoblastoma, is not just
mutated in rare eye tumors in children. When scientists tested the gene
isolated by Dryja, Friend, and Weinberg in other cancers in the early
nineties, they found it widely mutated in lung, bone, esophageal,
breast, and bladder cancers in adults. Like ras, it is expressed in
nearly every dividing cell. And it is inactivated in a whole host of
malignancies. Calling it retinoblastoma thus vastly underestimates the
influence, depth, and prowess of this gene.</p>
<p>The retinoblastoma gene encodes a protein, also named Rb, with a deep
molecular “pocket.” Its chief function is to bind to several other
proteins and keep them tightly sealed in that pocket, preventing them
from activating cell division. When the cell decides to divide, it tags
Rb with a phosphate group, a molecular signal that inactivates the gene
and thus forces the protein to release its partners. Rb thus acts as a
gatekeeper for cell division, opening a series of key molecular
floodgates each time cell division is activated and closing them sharply
when the cell division is completed. Mutations in Rb inactivate this
function. The cancer cell perceives its gates as perpetually open and is
unable to stop dividing.</p>
<p>The cloning of ras and retinoblastoma—oncogene and anti-oncogene—was
a transformative moment in cancer genetics. In the decade between 1983
and 1993, a horde of other oncogenes and anti-oncogenes (tumor
suppressor genes) were swiftly identified in human cancers: myc, neu,
fos, ret, akt (all oncogenes), and p53, VHL, APC (all tumor
suppressors). Retroviruses, the accidental carriers of oncogenes, faded
far into the distance. Varmus and Bishop’s theory—that oncogenes were
activated cellular genes—was recognized to be widely true for many forms
of cancer. And the two-hit hypothesis—that tumor suppressors were genes
that needed to be inactivated in both chromosomes—was also found to be
widely applicable in cancer. A rather general conceptual framework for
carcinogenesis was slowly becoming apparent. The cancer cell was a
broken, deranged machine. Oncogenes were its jammed accelerators and
inactivated tumor suppressors its missing brakes.*</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, yet another line of research, resurrected from the
past, yielded a further bounty of cancer-linked genes. Ever since de
Gouvêa’s report of the Brazilian family with eye tumors in 1872,
geneticists had uncovered several other families that appeared to carry
cancer in their genes. The stories of these families bore a familiar,
tragic trope: cancer haunted them generation upon generation, appearing
and reappearing in parents, children, and grandchildren. Two features
stood out in these family histories. First, geneticists recognized that
the spectrum of cancers in every family was limited and often
stereotypical: colon and ovarian cancer threading through one family;
breast and ovarian through another; sarcomas, leukemias, and gliomas
through a third. And second, similar patterns often reappeared in
different families, thereby suggesting a common genetic syndrome. In
Lynch syndrome (first described by an astute oncologist, Henry Lynch, in
a Nebraskan family), colon, ovarian, stomach, and biliary cancer
recurred generation upon generation. In Li-Fraumeni syndrome, there were
recurrent bone and visceral sarcomas, leukemias, and brain tumors.</p>
<p>Using powerful molecular genetic techniques, cancer geneticists in
the 1980s and 1990s could clone and identify some of these cancer-linked
genes. Many of these familial cancer genes, like Rb, were tumor
suppressors (although occasional oncogenes were also found). Most such
syndromes were fleetingly rare. But occasionally geneticists identified
cancer-predisposing gene alterations that were quite frequently
represented in the population. Perhaps the most striking among these,
first suggested by the geneticist Mary Claire-King and then definitively
cloned by Mark Skolnick’s team at the pharma company Myriad Genetics,
was BRCA-1, a gene that strongly predisposes humans to breast and
ovarian cancer. BRCA-1 (to which we will return in later pages) can be
found in up to 1 percent of women in selected populations, making it one
of the most common cancer-linked genes found in humans.</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, the discoveries of cancer biology had thus
traversed the gap between the chicken tumors of Peyton Rous and real
human cancers. But purists still complained. The crusty specter of
Robert Koch still haunted the genetic theory of cancer. Koch had
postulated that for an agent to be identified as the “cause” of a
disease, it must (1) be present in the diseased organism, (2) be capable
of being isolated from the diseased organism, and (3) re-create the
disease in a secondary host when transferred from the diseased organism.
Oncogenes had met the first two criteria. They had been found to be
present in cancer cells and they had been isolated from cancer cells.
But no one had shown that a cancer gene, in and of itself, could create
a bona fide tumor in an animal.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, a series of remarkable experiments allowed cancer
geneticists to meet Koch’s final criteria. In 1984, biologists working
on stem cells had invented a new technology that allowed them to
introduce exogenous genes into early mouse embryos, then create a living
mouse out of those modified embryos. This allowed them to produce
“transgenic mice,” mice in which one or more genes were artificially and
permanently modified. Cancer geneticists seized this opportunity. Among
the first such genes to be engineered into a mouse was c-myc, an
oncogene discovered in lymphoma cells.</p>
<p>Using transgenic mouse technology, Philip Leder’s team at Harvard
altered the c-myc gene in mice, but with a twist: cleverly, they ensured
that only breast tissue in the mouse would overexpress the gene. (Myc
could not be activated in all cells. If myc was permanently activated in
the embryo, the embryo turned into a ball of overproliferating cells,
then involuted and died through unknown mechanisms. The only way to
activate myc in a living mouse was to restrict the activation to only a
subset of cells. Since Leder’s lab was studying breast cancer, he chose
breast cells.) Colloquially, Leder called his mouse the OncoMouse. In
1988, he successfully applied for a patent on the OncoMouse, making it
the first animal patented in history.</p>
<p>Leder expected his transgenic mice to explode with cancer, but to his
surprise, the oncomice sprouted rather mousy cancers. Even though an
aggressive oncogene had been stitched into their chromosomes, the mice
developed small, unilateral breast cancers, and not until late in life.
Even more surprisingly, Leder’s mice typically developed cancers only
after pregnancy, suggesting that environmental influences, such as
hormones, were strictly required to achieve full transformation of
breast cells. “The active myc gene does not appear to be sufficient for
the development of these tumors,” Leder wrote. “If that were the case,
we would have expected the uniform development of tumor masses involving
the entire bilateral [breast] glands of all five tumor-bearing animals.
Rather, our results suggest at least two additional requirements. One of
these is likely to be a further transforming event. . . . The other
seems to be a hormonal environment related to pregnancy that is only
suggested by these initial studies.”</p>
<p>To test the roles of other oncogenes and environmental stimuli, Leder
created a second OncoMouse, in which two activated proto-oncogenes, ras
and myc, were engineered into the chromosome and expressed in breast
cells. Multiple tumors sprouted up in the breast glands of these mice in
months. The requirement for the hormonal milieu of pregnancy was
partially ameliorated. Still, only a few distinct clones of cancer
sprouted out of the ras-myc mice. Millions of breast cells in each mouse
possessed activated ras and myc. Yet, of those millions of cells, each
endowed with the most potent oncogenes, only a few dozen turned into
real, living tumors.</p>
<p>Even so, this was a landmark experiment: cancer had artificially been
created in an animal. “Cancer genetics,” as the geneticist Cliff Tabin
recalls, “had crossed a new frontier. It was not dealing with just genes
and pathways and artificial lumps in the lab, but a real growing tumor
in an animal.” Peyton Rous’s long squabble with the discipline—that
cancer had never been produced in a living organism by altering a
defined set of cellular genes—was finally laid to its long-overdue
rest.</p>
<ul>
<li>In fact, the “normal” cells that Weinberg had used were not exactly
normal. They were already growth-adapted, such that a single activated
oncogene could tip them into transformed growth. Truly “normal” cells,
Weinberg would later discover, require several genes to become
transformed.</li>
</ul>
<p>†In fact, ras, like src, had also been discovered earlier in a
cancer-causing virus—again underscoring the striking capacity of these
viruses to reveal the mechanisms of endogenous oncogenes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Laskerites had largely been disbanded in the aftermath of the
1971 National Cancer Act. Mary Lasker was still involved in science
policy, although with nowhere near the force and visceral energy that
she had summoned in the sixties.</p></li>
<li><p>Although cancer is not universally caused by viruses, certain
viruses cause particular cancers, such as the human papilloma virus
(HPV), which causes cervical cancer. When the mechanism driving this
cancer was deciphered in the 1990s, HPV turned out to inactivate Rb’s
and p53’s signal—underscoring the importance of endogenous genes in even
virally induced cancers.</p></li>
