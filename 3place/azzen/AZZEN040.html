<h4 id="the-wind-in-the-trees">The Wind in the Trees</h4>
<p>The fine, fine wind that takes its course through the chaos of the
world</p>
<p>Like a fine, an exquisite chisel, a wedge-blade inserted . . .</p>
<p>—D. H. Lawrence</p>
<p>The developments of the summer of 1976 drastically reorganized the
universe of cancer biology, returning genes, again, to its center.
Harold Varmus and Michael Bishop’s proto-oncogene theory provided the
first cogent and comprehensive theory of carcinogenesis. The theory
explained how radiation, soot, and cigarette smoke, diverse and
seemingly unrelated insults, could all initiate cancer—by mutating and
thus activating precursor oncogenes within the cell. The theory made
sense of Bruce Ames’s peculiar correlation between carcinogens and
mutagens: chemicals that cause mutations in DNA produce cancers because
they alter cellular proto-oncogenes. The theory clarified why the same
kind of cancer might arise in smokers and nonsmokers, albeit at
different rates: both smokers and nonsmokers have the same
proto-oncogenes in their cells, but smokers develop cancer at a higher
rate because carcinogens in tobacco increase the mutation rate of these
genes.</p>
<p>But what did human cancer genes look like? Tumor virologists had
found src in viruses and then in cells, but surely other endogenous
proto-oncogenes were strewn about in the human cellular genome.</p>
<p>Genetics has two distinct ways to “see” genes. The first is
structural: genes can be envisioned as physical structures—pieces of DNA
lined up along chromosomes, just as Morgan and Flemming had first
envisioned them. The second is functional: genes can be imagined, à la
Mendel, as the inheritance of traits that move from one generation to
the next. In the decade between 1970 and 1980, cancer genetics would
begin to “see” cancer-causing genes in these two lights. Each distinct
vision would enhance the mechanistic understanding of carcinogenesis,
bringing the field closer and closer to an understanding of the core
molecular aberration in human cancers.</p>
<p>Structure—anatomy—came first. In 1973, as Varmus and Bishop were
launching their initial studies on src, a hematologist in Chicago, Janet
Rowley, saw a human cancer gene in a physical form. Rowley’s specialty
was studying the staining patterns of chromosomes in cells in order to
locate chromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells. Chromosome staining,
the technique she had perfected, is as much an art as a science. It is
also an oddly anachronistic art, like painting with tempera in an age of
digital prints. At a time when cancer genetics was zooming off to
explore the world of RNA, tumor viruses, and oncogenes, Rowley was
intent on dragging the discipline back to its roots—to Boveri’s and
Flemming’s chromosomes dyed in blue. Piling anachronism upon
anachronism, the cancer she had chosen to study was chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML)—Bennett’s infamous “suppuration of blood.”</p>
<p>Rowley’s study was built on prior work by a duo of pathologists from
Philadelphia who had also studied CML. In the late 1950s, Peter Nowell
and David Hungerford had found an unusual chromosomal pattern in this
form of leukemia: the cancer cells bore one consistently shortened
chromosome. Human cells have forty-six chromosomes—twenty-three matched
pairs—one inherited from each parent. In CML cells, Nowell found that
one copy of the twenty-second chromosome had its head lopped off. Nowell
called the abnormality the Philadelphia chromosome after the place of
its discovery. But Nowell and Hungerford could not understand where the
decapitated chromosome had come from, or where its missing “head” had
gone.</p>
<p>Rowley, following this study, began to trace the headless chromosome
in her CML cells. By laying out exquisitely stained photographs of CML
chromosomes enlarged thousands of times—she typically spread them on her
dining table and then leaned into the pictures, hunting for the missing
pieces of the infamous Philadelphia chromosome—Rowley found a pattern.
The missing head of chromosome twenty-two had attached itself
elsewhere—to the tip of chromosome nine. And a piece of chromosome nine
had conversely attached itself to chromosome twenty-two. This genetic
event was termed a translocation—the flip-flop transposition of two
pieces of chromosomes.</p>
<p>Rowley examined case after case of CML patients. In every single
case, she found this same translocation in the cells. Chromosomal
abnormalities in cancer cells had been known since the days of von
Hansemann and Boveri. But Rowley’s results argued a much more profound
point. Cancer was not disorganized chromosomal chaos. It was organized
chromosomal chaos: specific and identical mutations existed in
particular forms of cancer.</p>
<p>Chromosomal translocations can create new genes called chimeras by
fusing two genes formerly located on two different chromosomes—the
“head” of chromosome nine, say, fused with the “tail” of a gene in
chromosome thirteen. The CML translocation, Rowley postulated, had
created such a chimera. Rowley did not know the identity or function of
this new chimeric monster. But she had demonstrated that a novel, unique
genetic alteration—later found to be an oncogene—could exist in a human
cancer cell, revealing itself purely by virtue of an aberrant chromosome
structure.</p>
<p>In Houston, Alfred Knudson, a Caltech-trained geneticist, also “saw”
a human cancer-causing gene in the early 1970s, although in yet another
distinct sense.</p>
<p>Rowley had visualized cancer-causing genes by studying the physical
structure of the cancer cell’s chromosomes. Knudson concentrated
monastically on the function of a gene. Genes are units of inheritance:
they shuttle properties—traits—from one generation to the next. If genes
cause cancer, Knudson reasoned, then he might capture a pattern in the
inheritance of cancer, much as Mendel had captured the idea of a gene by
studying the inheritance of flower color or plant height in peas.</p>
<p>In 1969, Knudson moved to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas,
where Freireich had set up a booming clinical center for childhood
cancers. Knudson needed a “model” cancer, a hereditary malignancy whose
underlying pattern of inheritance would reveal how cancer-causing genes
worked. The natural choice was retinoblastoma, the odd, rare variant of
eye cancer that de Gouvêa had identified in Brazil with its striking
tendency to erupt in the same family across generations.</p>
<p>Retinoblastoma is a particularly tragic form of cancer, not just
because it assaults children but because it assaults the quintessential
organ of childhood: the tumor grows in the eye. Afflicted children are
sometimes diagnosed when the world around them begins to blur and fade.
But occasionally the cancer is incidentally found in a child’s
photograph when the eye, lit by a camera flash, glows eerily like a
cat’s eyes in lamplight, revealing the tumor buried behind the lens.
Left untreated, the tumor will crawl backward from the eye socket into
the optic nerve, and then climb into the brain. The primary methods of
treatment are to sear the tumor with high doses of gamma radiation or to
enucleate the eye surgically, leaving behind an empty socket.</p>
<p>Retinoblastoma has two distinct variants, an inherited “familial”
form and a sporadic form. De Gouvêa had identified the familial form.
Children who suffer from this familial or inherited form may carry
strong family histories of the disease—fathers, mothers, cousins,
siblings, and kindred affected—and they typically develop tumors in both
eyes, as in de Gouvêa’s case from Rio. But the tumor also arises in
children with no family history of the disease. Children with this
sporadic form never carry a history in the family and always have a
tumor in only one eye.</p>
<p>This pattern of inheritance intrigued Knudson. He wondered whether he
could discern a subtle difference in the development of cancer between
the sporadic and the inherited versions using mathematical analyses. He
performed the simplest of experiments: he grouped children with the
sporadic form into one cohort and children with the familial form in a
second. And sifting through old hospital records, Knudson tabulated the
ages in which the disease struck the two groups, then plotted them as
two curves. Intriguingly, he found that the two cohorts developed the
cancers at different “velocities.” In inherited retinoblastoma, cancer
onset was rapid, with diagnosis typically two to six months after birth.
Sporadic retinoblastoma typically appeared two to four years after
birth.</p>
<p>But why did the same disease move with different velocities in
different children? Knudson used the numbers and simple equations
borrowed from physics and probability theory to model the development of
the cancer in the two cohorts. He found that the data fit a simple
model. In children with the inherited form of retinoblastoma, only one
genetic change was required to develop the cancer. Children with the
sporadic form required two genetic changes.</p>
<p>This raised another puzzling question: why was only one genetic
change needed to unleash cancer in the familial case, while two changes
were needed in the sporadic form? Knudson perceived a simple, beautiful
explanation. “The number two,” he recalled, “is the geneticist’s
favorite number.” Every normal human cell has two copies of each
chromosome and thus two copies of every gene. Every normal cell must
have two normal copies of the retinoblastoma gene—Rb. To develop
sporadic retinoblastoma, Knudson postulated, both copies of the gene
needed to be inactivated through a mutation in each copy of the Rb gene.
Hence, sporadic retinoblastoma develops at later ages because two
independent mutations have to accumulate in the same cell.</p>
<p>Children with the inherited form of retinoblastoma, in contrast, are
born with a defective copy of Rb. In their cells, one gene copy is
already defective, and only a single additional genetic mutation is
needed before the cell senses the change and begins to divide. These
children are thus predisposed to the cancer, and they develop cancer
faster, producing the “rapid velocity” tumors that Knudson saw in his
statistical charts. Knudson called this the two-hit hypothesis of
cancer. For certain cancer-causing genes, two mutational “hits” were
needed to provoke cell division and thus produce cancer.</p>
<p>Knudson’s two-hit theory was a powerful explanation for the
inheritance pattern of retinoblastoma, but at first glance it seemed at
odds with the initial molecular understanding of cancer. The src gene,
recall, requires a single activated copy to provoke uncontrolled cell
division. Knudson’s gene required two. Why was a single mutation in src
sufficient to provoke cell division, while two were required for Rb?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the function of the two genes. Src activates a
function in cell division. The mutation in src, as Ray Erikson and
Hidesaburo Hanafusa had discovered, creates a cellular protein that is
unable to extinguish its function—an insatiable, hyperactive kinase on
overdrive that provokes perpetual cell division. Knudson’s gene, Rb,
performs the opposite function. It suppresses cell proliferation, and it
is the inactivation of such a gene (by virtue of two hits) that
unleashes cell division. Rb, then, is a cancer suppressor gene—the
functional opposite of src—an “anti-oncogene,” as Knudson called it.</p>
<p>“Two classes of genes are apparently critical in the origin of the
cancers of children,” he wrote. “One class, that of oncogenes, acts by
virtue of abnormal or elevated activity. . . . The other class, that of
anti-oncogenes [or tumor suppressors], is recessive in oncogenesis;
cancer results when both normal copies have been mutated or deleted.
Some persons carry one such mutation in the germline and are highly
susceptible to tumor because only one somatic event is necessary. Some
children, even though carrying no such mutation in the germline, can
acquire tumor as a result of two somatic events.”</p>
<p>It was an exquisitely astute hypothesis spun, remarkably, out of
statistical reasoning alone. Knudson did not know the molecular identity
of his phantasmic anti-oncogenes. He had never looked at a cancer cell
to “see” these genes; he had never performed a biological experiment to
pin down Rb. Like Mendel, Knudson knew his genes only in a statistical
sense. He had inferred them, as he put it, “as one might infer the wind
from the movement of the trees.”</p>
<p>By the late 1970s, Varmus, Bishop, and Knudson could begin to
describe the core molecular aberration of the cancer cell, stitching
together the coordinated actions of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. Cancer
genes, Knudson proposed, came in two flavors. “Positive” genes, such as
src, are mutant activated versions of normal cellular genes. In normal
cells, these genes accelerate cell division, but only when the cell
receives an appropriate growth signal. In their mutant form, these genes
are driven into perpetual hyperactivity, unleashing cell division beyond
control. An activated proto-oncogene, to use Bishop’s analogy, is “a
jammed accelerator” in a car. A cell with such a jammed accelerator
careens down the path of cell division, unable to cease mitosis,
dividing and dividing again relentlessly.</p>
<p>“Negative” genes, such as Rb, suppress cell division. In normal
cells, these anti-oncogenes, or tumor suppressor genes, provide the
“brakes” to cellular proliferation, shutting down cell division when the
cell receives appropriate signals. In cancer cells, these brakes have
been inactivated by mutations. In cells with missing brakes, to use
Bishop’s analogy again, the “stop” signals for mitosis can no longer be
registered. Again, the cell divides and keeps dividing, defying all
signals to stop.</p>
<p>Both abnormalities, activated proto-oncogenes and inactivated tumor
suppressors (“jammed accelerators” and “missing brakes”), represent the
core molecular defects in the cancer cell. Bishop, Knudson, and Varmus
did not know how many such defects were ultimately needed to cause human
cancers. But a confluence of them, they postulated, causes cancer.</p>
