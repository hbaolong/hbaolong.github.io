<h4 id="knowing-the-enemy">Knowing the Enemy</h4>
<p>It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will
not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies
but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know
your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single
battle.</p>
<p>—Sun Tzu</p>
<p>As the armada of cytotoxic therapy readied itself for even more
aggressive battles against cancer, a few dissenting voices began to be
heard along its peripheries. These voices were connected by two common
themes.</p>
<p>First, the dissidents argued that indiscriminate chemotherapy, the
unloading of barrel after barrel of poisonous drugs, could not be the
only strategy by which to attack cancer. Contrary to prevailing dogma,
cancer cells possessed unique and specific vulnerabilities that rendered
them particularly sensitive to certain chemicals that had little impact
on normal cells.</p>
<p>Second, such chemicals could only be discovered by uncovering the
deep biology of every cancer cell. Cancer-specific therapies existed,
but they could only be known from the bottom up, i.e., from solving the
basic biological riddles of each form of cancer, rather than from the
top down, by maximizing cytotoxic chemotherapy or by discovering
cellular poisons empirically. To attack a cancer cell specifically, one
needed to begin by identifying its biological behavior, its genetic
makeup, and its unique vulnerabilities. The search for magic bullets
needed to begin with an understanding of cancer’s magical targets.</p>
<p>The most powerful such voice arose from the most unlikely of sources,
a urological surgeon, Charles Huggins, who was neither a cell biologist
nor even a cancer biologist, but rather a physiologist interested in
glandular secretions. Born in Nova Scotia in 1901, Huggins attended
Harvard Medical School in the early 1920s (where he intersected briefly
with Farber) and trained as a general surgeon in Michigan. In 1927, at
age twenty-six, he was appointed to the faculty of the University of
Chicago as a urological surgeon, a specialist in diseases of the
bladder, kidney, genitals, and prostate.</p>
<p>Huggins’s appointment epitomized the confidence (and hubris) of
surgery: he possessed no formal training in urology, nor had he trained
as a cancer surgeon. It was an era when surgical specialization was
still a fluid concept; if a man could remove an appendix or a lymph
node, the philosophy ran, he could certainly learn to remove a kidney.
Huggins thus learned urology on the fly by cramming a textbook in about
six weeks. He arrived optimistically in Chicago, expecting to find a
busy, flourishing practice. But his new clinic, housed inside a stony
neo-Gothic tower, remained empty all winter. (The fluidity of surgical
specialization was, perhaps, not as reassuring to patients.) Tired of
memorizing books and journals in an empty, drafty waiting room, Huggins
changed tracks and set up a laboratory to study urological diseases
while waiting for patients to come to his clinic.</p>
<p>To choose a medical specialty is also to choose its cardinal bodily
liquid. Hematologists have blood. Hepatologists have bile. Huggins had
prostatic fluid: a runny, straw-colored mixture of salt and sugar meant
to lubricate and nourish sperm. Its source, the prostate, is a small
gland buried deep in the perineum, wrapped around the outlet of the
urinary tract in men. (Vesalius was the first to identify it and draw it
into human anatomy.) Walnut-shaped and only walnut-sized, it is yet
ferociously the site of cancer. Prostate cancer represents a full third
of all cancer incidence in men—sixfold that of leukemia and lymphoma. In
autopsies of men over sixty years old, nearly one in every three
specimens will bear some evidence of prostatic malignancy.</p>
<p>But although an astoundingly common form of cancer, prostate cancer
is also highly variable in its clinical course. Most cases are
indolent—elderly men usually die with prostate cancer than die of
prostate cancer—but in other patients the disease can be aggressive and
invasive, capable of exploding into painful lesions in the bones and
lymph nodes in its advanced, metastatic form.</p>
<p>Huggins, though, was far less interested in cancer than in the
physiology of prostatic fluid. Female hormones, such as estrogen, were
known to control the growth of breast tissue. Did male hormones, by
analogy, control the growth of the normal prostate—and thus regulate the
secretion of its principal product, prostatic fluid? By the late 1920s,
Huggins had devised an apparatus to collect precious drops of prostatic
fluid from dogs. (He diverted urine away by inserting a catheter into
the bladder and stitched a collection tube to the exit of the prostate
gland.) It was the only surgical innovation that he would devise in his
lifetime.</p>
<p>Huggins now had a tool to measure prostatic function; he could
quantify the amount of fluid produced by the gland. He found that if he
surgically removed the testicles of his dogs—and thereby depleted the
dogs of the hormone testosterone—the prostate gland involuted and
shriveled and the fluid secretion dried up precipitously. If he injected
the castrated dogs with purified testosterone, the exogenous hormone
saved the prostate from shriveling. Prostate cells were thus acutely
dependent on the hormone testosterone for their growth and function.
Female sexual hormones kept breast cells alive; male hormones had a
similar effect on prostate cells.</p>
<p>Huggins wanted to delve further into the metabolism of testosterone
and the prostate cell, but his experiments were hampered by a peculiar
problem. Dogs, humans, and lions are the only animals known to develop
prostate cancer, and dogs with sizable prostate tumors kept appearing in
his lab during his studies. “It was vexatious to encounter a dog with a
prostatic tumor during a metabolic study,” he wrote. His first impulse
was to cull the cancer-afflicted dogs from his study and continue
single-mindedly with his fluid collection, but then a question formed in
his mind. If testosterone deprivation could shrink normal prostate
cells, what might testosterone deprivation do to cancer cells?</p>
<p>The answer, as any self-respecting cancer biologist might have
informed him, was almost certain: very little. Cancer cells, after all,
were deranged, uninhibited, and altered—responsive only to the most
poisonous combinations of drugs. The signals and hormones that regulated
normal cells had long been flung aside; what remained was a cell driven
to divide with such pathological and autonomous fecundity that it had
erased all memory of normalcy.</p>
<p>But Huggins knew that certain forms of cancer did not obey this
principle. Variants of thyroid cancer, for instance, continued to make
thyroid hormone, the growth-stimulating molecule secreted by the normal
thyroid gland; even though cancerous, these cells remembered their
former selves. Huggins found that prostate cancer cells also retained a
physiological “memory” of their origin. When he removed the testicles of
prostate cancer–bearing dogs, thus acutely depriving the cancer cells of
testosterone, the tumors also involuted within days. In fact, if normal
prostate cells were dependent on testosterone for survival, then
malignant prostate cells were nearly addicted to the hormone—so much so
that the acute withdrawal acted like the most powerful therapeutic drug
conceivable. “Cancer is not necessarily autonomous and intrinsically
self-perpetuating,” Huggins wrote. “Its growth can be sustained and
propagated by hormonal function in the host.” The link between the
growth-sustenance of normal cells and of cancer cells was much closer
than previously imagined: cancer could be fed and nurtured by our own
bodies.</p>
<p>Surgical castration, fortunately, was not the only means to starve
prostate cancer cells. If male hormones were driving the growth of these
cancer cells, Huggins reasoned, then rather than eliminate the male
hormones, what if one tricked the cancer into thinking that the body was
“female” by suppressing the effect of testosterone?</p>
<p>In 1929, Edward Doisy, a biochemist, had tried to identify the
hormonal factors in the estrous cycle of females. Doisy had collected
hundreds of gallons of urine from pregnant women in enormous copper
vats, then extracted a few milligrams of a hormone called estrogen.
Doisy’s extraction had sparked a race to produce estrogen or its
analogue in large quantities. By the mid-1940s, several laboratories and
pharmaceutical companies, jostling to capture the market for the
“essence of femininity,” raced to synthesize analogues of estrogen or
find novel means to purify it efficiently. The two most widely used
versions of the drug were diethylstilbestrol (or DES), an artificial
estrogen chemically synthesized by biochemists in London, or Premarin,
natural estrogen purified from horse’s urine in Montreal. (The synthetic
analogue, DES, will return in a more sinister form in subsequent
pages.)</p>
<p>Both Premarin (its name derived from pregnant mare urine) and DES
were initially marketed as elixirs to cure menopause. But for Huggins,
the existence of synthetic estrogens suggested a markedly different use:
he could inject them to “feminize” the male body and stop the production
of testosterone in patients with prostate cancer. He called the method
“chemical castration.” And once again, he found striking responses. As
with surgical castration, patients with aggressive prostate cancer
chemically castrated with feminizing hormones responded briskly to the
therapy, often with minimal side effects. (The most prominent complaint
among men was the occurrence of menopause-like hot flashes.) Prostate
cancer was not cured with these steroids; patients inevitably relapsed
with cancer that had become resistant to hormone therapy. But the
remissions, which often stretched into several months, proved that
hormonal manipulations could choke the growth of a hormone-dependent
cancer. To produce a cancer remission, one did not need a toxic,
indiscriminate cellular poison (such as cisplatin or nitrogen
mustard).</p>
<p>If prostate cancer could be starved to near-death by choking off
testosterone, then could hormonal deprivation be applied to starve
another hormone-dependent cancer? There was at least one obvious
candidate—breast cancer. In the late 1890s, an adventurous Scottish
surgeon named George Beatson, trying to devise new surgical methods to
treat breast cancer, had learned from shepherds in the Scottish
highlands that the removal of the ovaries from cows altered their
capacity to lactate and changed the quality of their udders. Beatson did
not understand the basis for this phenomenon (estrogen, the ovarian
hormone, had not yet been discovered by Doisy), but intrigued by the
inexplicable link between ovaries and breasts, Beatson had surgically
removed the ovaries of three women with breast cancer.</p>
<p>In an age before the hormonal circuits between the ovary and the
breast were even remotely established, this was unorthodox beyond
description—like removing the lung to cure a brain lesion. But to
Beatson’s astonishment, his three cases revealed marked responses to the
ovarian removal—the breast tumors shrank dramatically. When surgeons in
London tried to repeat Beatson’s findings on a larger group of women,
though, the operation led to a more nuanced outcome: only about
two-thirds of all women with breast cancer responded.</p>
<p>The hit-and-miss quality of the benefit mystified nineteenth-century
physiologists. “It is impossible to tell beforehand whether any benefit
will result from the operation or not, its effects being quite
uncertain,” a surgeon wrote in 1902. How might the surgical removal of a
faraway organ affect the growth of cancer? And why, tantalizingly, had
only a fraction of cases responded? The phenomenon almost brought back
memories of a mysterious humoral factor circulating in the body—of
Galen’s black bile. But why was this humoral factor only active in
certain women with breast cancer?</p>
<p>Nearly three decades later, Doisy’s discovery of estrogen provided a
partial answer to the first question. Estrogen is the principal hormone
secreted by the ovaries. As with testosterone for the normal prostate,
estrogen was soon demonstrated to be a vital hormone for the maintenance
and growth of normal breast tissue. Was breast cancer also fueled by
estrogen from the ovaries? If so, what of Beatson’s puzzle: why did some
breast cancers shrink with ovarian removal while others remained totally
unresponsive?</p>
<p>In the mid-1960s, working closely with Huggins, a young chemist in
Chicago, Elwood Jensen, came close to solving Beatson’s riddle. Jensen
began his studies not with cancer cells but with the normal physiology
of estrogen. Hormones, Jensen knew, typically work by binding to a
receptor in a target cell, but the receptor for the steroid hormone
estrogen had remained elusive. Using a radioactively labeled version of
the hormone as bait, in 1968 Jensen found the estrogen receptor—the
molecule responsible for binding estrogen and relaying its signal to the
cell.</p>
<p>Jensen now asked whether breast cancer cells also uniformly possessed
this receptor. Unexpectedly, some did and some did not. Indeed, breast
cancer cases could be neatly divided into two types—ones with cancer
cells that expressed high levels of this receptor and those that
expressed low levels, “ER-positive” and “ER-negative” tumors.</p>
<p>Jensen’s observations suggested a possible solution to Beatson’s
riddle. Perhaps the marked variation of breast cancer cells in response
to ovarian removal depended on whether the cancer cells expressed the
estrogen receptor or not. ER-positive tumors, possessing the receptor,
retained their “hunger” for estrogen. ER-negative tumors had rid
themselves of both the receptor and the hormone dependence. ER-positive
tumors thus responded to Beatson’s surgery, Jensen proposed, while
ER-negative tumors were unresponsive.</p>
<p>The simplest way to prove this theory was to launch an experiment—to
perform Beatson’s surgery on women with ER-positive and ER-negative
tumors and determine whether the receptor status of the cancer cells was
predictive of the response. But the surgical procedure had fallen out of
fashion. (Ovarian removal produced many other severe side effects, such
as osteoporosis.) An alternative was to use a pharmacological means to
inhibit estrogen function, a female version of chemical castration à la
Huggins.</p>
<p>But Jensen had no such drug. Testosterone did not work, and no
synthetic “antiestrogen” was in development. In their dogged pursuit of
cures for menopause and for new contraceptive agents (using synthetic
estrogens), pharmaceutical companies had long abandoned the development
of an antiestrogen, and there was no interest in developing an
antiestrogen for cancer. In an era gripped by the hypnotic promise of
cytotoxic chemotherapy, as Jensen put it, “there was little enthusiasm
about developing endocrine [hormonal] therapies to treat cancer.
Combination chemotherapy was [thought to be] more likely to be
successful in curing not only breast cancer but other solid tumors.”
Developing an antiestrogen, an antagonist to the fabled elixir of female
youth, was widely considered a waste of effort, money, and time.</p>
<p>Scarcely anyone paid notice, then, on September 13, 1962, when a team
of talented British chemists from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)
filed a patent for the chemical named ICI 46474, or tamoxifen.
Originally invented as a birth control pill, tamoxifen had been
synthesized by a team led by the hormone biologist Arthur Walpole and a
synthetic chemist, Dora Richardson, both members of the “fertility
control program” at the ICI. But even though structurally designed to be
a potent stimulator of estrogen—its winged, birdlike skeleton designed
to perch perfectly into the open arms of the estrogen receptor—tamoxifen
had turned out to have exactly the opposite effect: rather than turning
on the estrogen signal, a requirement for a contraceptive drug, it had,
surprisingly, shut it off in many tissues. It was an estrogen
antagonist—thus considered a virtually useless drug.</p>
<p>Yet the connection between fertility drugs and cancer preoccupied
Walpole. He knew of Huggins’s experiments with surgical castration for
prostate cancer. He knew of Beatson’s riddle—almost solved by Jensen.
The antiestrogenic properties of his new drug raised an intriguing
possibility. ICI 46474 may be a useless contraceptive, but perhaps, he
reasoned, it might be useful against estrogen-sensitive breast
cancer.</p>
<p>To test that idea, Walpole and Richardson sought a clinical
collaborator. The natural site for such a trial was immediately
apparent, the sprawling Christie Hospital in Manchester, a
world-renowned cancer center just a short ride through the undulating
hills of Cheshire from ICI’s research campus at Alderley Park. And there
was a natural collaborator: Mary Cole, a Manchester oncologist and
radiotherapist with a particular interest in breast cancer. Known
affectionately as Moya by her patients and colleagues, Cole had a
reputation as a feisty and meticulous physician intensely dedicated to
her patients. She had a ward full of women with advanced, metastatic
breast cancer, many of them hurtling inexorably toward their death. Moya
Cole was willing to try anything—even an abandoned contraceptive—to save
the lives of these women.</p>
<p>Cole’s trial was launched at Christie in the late summer of 1969.
Forty-six women with breast cancer were treated with tablets of ICI
46474. Cole expected little from the drug—at best, a partial response.
But in ten patients, the response was almost immediately obvious. Tumors
shriveled visibly in the breast. Lung metastases shrank. Bone pain
flickered away and lymph nodes softened.</p>
<p>Like Huggins’s prostate cancer patients, many of the women who
responded to the drug eventually relapsed. But the success of the trial
was incontrovertible—and the proof of principle historic. A drug
designed to target a specific pathway in a cancer cell—not a cellular
poison discovered empirically by trial and error—had successfully driven
metastatic tumors into remission.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen’s journey came full circle in a little-known pharmaceutical
laboratory in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. In 1973, V. Craig Jordan, a
biochemist working at the lab of the Worcester Foundation (a research
institute involved in the development of new contraceptives),
investigated the pattern behind cancers that did or did not respond to
tamoxifen therapy. Jordan used a simple molecular technique to stain
breast cancer cells for the estrogen receptor that Elwood Jensen had
discovered in Chicago, and the answer to Beatson’s riddle finally leapt
out of the experiment. Cancer cells that expressed the estrogen receptor
were highly responsive to tamoxifen, while cells that lacked the
estrogen receptor did not respond. The reason behind the slippery,
hit-and-miss responses in women with breast cancer observed in England
nearly a century earlier was now clear. Cells that expressed the
estrogen receptor could bind tamoxifen, and the drug, an estrogen
antagonist, shut off estrogen responsiveness, thus choking the cells’
growth. But ER-negative cells lacked the receptor for the drug and thus
were insensitive to it. The schema had a satisfying simplicity. For the
first time in the history of cancer, a drug, its target, and a cancer
cell had been conjoined by a core molecular logic.</p>
