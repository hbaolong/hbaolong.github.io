<h4 id="under-the-lamps-of-viruses">Under the Lamps of Viruses</h4>
<p>Unidentified flying objects, abominable snowmen, the Loch Ness
monster and human cancer viruses.</p>
<p>—Medical World News, 1974,</p>
<p>on four “mysteries” widely reported</p>
<p>and publicized but never seen</p>
<p>The biochemist Arthur Kornberg once joked that the discipline of
modern biology in its early days often operated like the man in the
proverbial story who is frantically searching for his keys under a
streetlamp. When a passerby asks the man whether he lost his keys at
that spot, the man says that he actually lost them at home—but he is
looking for the keys under the lamp because “the light there is the
brightest.”</p>
<p>In the predawn of modern biology, experiments were so difficult to
perform on biological organisms, and the results of manipulations so
unpredictable, that scientists were severely constrained in their
experimental choices. Experiments were conducted on the simplest model
organisms—fruit flies, sea urchins, bacteria, slime molds—because the
“light” there was the brightest.</p>
<p>In cancer biology, Rous’s sarcoma virus represented the only such
lamplit spot. Admittedly, it was a rare virus that produced a rare
cancer in a species of chicken.* But it was the most reliable way to
produce a real cancer in a living organism. Cancer researchers knew that
X-rays, soot, cigarette smoke, and asbestos represented vastly more
common risk factors for human cancers. They had heard of the odd
Brazilian case of a family that seemed to carry retinoblastoma cancer in
its genes. But the capacity to manipulate cancer in an experimental
environment was unique to the Rous virus, and so it stood center stage,
occupying all the limelight.</p>
<p>The appeal of studying Rous virus was further compounded by the
formidable force of Peyton Rous’s personality. Bulldogish, persuasive,
and inflexible, Rous had acquired a near paternal attachment to his
virus, and he was unwilling to capitulate to any other theory of cause.
He acknowledged that epidemiologists had shown that exogenous
carcinogens were correlated with cancer (Doll and Hill’s study,
published in 1950, had clearly shown that smoking was associated with an
increase in lung cancer), but this had not offered any mechanistic
explanation of cancer causation. Viruses, Rous felt, were the only
answer.</p>
<p>By the early 1950s, cancer researchers had thus split into three
feuding camps. The virologists, led by Rous, claimed that viruses caused
cancer, although no such virus had been found in human studies.
Epidemiologists, such as Doll and Hill, argued that exogenous chemicals
caused cancer, although they could not offer a mechanistic explanation
for their theory or results. The third camp, of Theodor Boveri’s
successors, stood at the farthest periphery. They possessed weak,
circumstantial evidence that genes internal to the cell might cause
cancer, but had neither the powerful human data of the epidemiologists
nor the exquisite experimental insights of the chicken virologists.
Great science emerges out of great contradiction, and here was a gaping
rift slicing its way through the center of cancer biology. Was human
cancer caused by an infectious agent? Was it caused by an exogenous
chemical? Was it caused by an internal gene? How could the three groups
of scientists have examined the same elephant and returned with such
radically variant opinions about its essential anatomy?</p>
<p>In 1951, a young virologist named Howard Temin, then a postdoctoral
researcher, arrived at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, California, to study the genetics of fruit flies. Restless and
imaginative, Temin soon grew bored with fruit flies. Switching fields,
he chose to study Rous sarcoma virus in Renato Dulbecco’s laboratory.
Dulbecco, a suave, exquisitely mannered Calabrian aristocrat, ran his
lab at Caltech with a distant and faintly patrician air. Temin was a
perfect fit: if Dulbecco wanted distance, Temin wanted independence.
Temin found a house in Pasadena with several other young scientists
(including John Cairns, the future author of the Scientific American
article on the War on Cancer) and spent his time cooking up unusual
meals in heavy communal pots and talking volubly about biological
riddles late into the night.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, too, Temin was cooking up an unusual experiment
that was virtually guaranteed to fail. Until the late fifties, Rous
sarcoma virus had been shown to cause tumors only in live chickens.
Temin, working closely with Harry Rubin, wanted to study how the virus
converted normal cells into cancer cells. To do this, they needed a
vastly simplified system—a system free of chickens and tumors, and
analogous to bacteria in a petri dish. And so Temin imagined creating
cancer in a petri dish. In 1958, in his seventh year in Dulbecco’s lab,
Temin succeeded. He added Rous sarcoma virus to a layer of normal cells
in a petri dish. The infection of the cells incited them to grow
uncontrollably, forcing them to form tiny distorted heaps containing
hundreds of cells that Temin called foci (the plural of focus). The
foci, Temin reasoned, represented cancer distilled into its essential,
elemental form: cells growing uncontrollably, unstoppably—pathological
mitosis. It was the sheer, driving power of Temin’s imagination that
allowed him to look at a tiny heap of cells and reimagine that heap as
the essence of the diffuse systemic disease that kills humans. But Temin
believed that the cell, and its interaction with the virus, had all the
biological components necessary to drive the malignant process. The
ghost was out of the organism.</p>
<p>Temin could now use his cancer-in-a-dish to perform experiments that
would have been nearly impossible using whole animals. One of his first
experiments with this system, performed in 1959, produced an unexpected
result. Normally, viruses infect cells, produce more viruses, and infect
more cells, but they do not directly affect the genetic makeup, the DNA,
of the cell. Influenza virus, for instance, infects lung cells and
produces more influenza virus, but it does not leave a permanent
fingerprint in our genes; when the virus goes away, our DNA is left
untouched. But Rous’s virus behaved differently. Rous sarcoma virus,
having infected the cells, had physically attached itself to the cell’s
DNA and thereby altered the cell’s genetic makeup, its genome. “The
virus, in some structural as well as functional sense, becomes part of
the genome of the cell,” Temin wrote.*</p>
<p>This observation—that a DNA copy of a virus’s genes could
structurally attach itself to a cell’s genes—intrigued Temin and
Dulbecco. But it raised an even more intriguing conceptual problem. In
viruses, genes are sometimes carried in their intermediary RNA form.
Certain viruses have dispensed with the original DNA copy of genes and
keep their genome in the RNA form, which is directly translated into
viral proteins once the virus infects a cell.</p>
<p>Temin knew from work performed by other researchers that Rous sarcoma
virus is one such RNA virus. But if the virus genes started as RNA, then
how could a copy of its genes convert into DNA? The central dogma of
molecular biology forbade such a transition. Biological information, the
dogma proposed, only travels down a one-way street from DNA to RNA to
proteins. How on earth, Temin wondered, could RNA turn around
acrobatically and make a DNA copy of itself, driving the wrong way down
the one-way street of biological information?</p>
<p>Temin made a leap of faith; if the data did not fit the dogma, then
the dogma—not the data—needed to be changed. He postulated that Rous
sarcoma virus carried a special property, a property unprecedented in
any other living organism: it could convert RNA back into DNA. In normal
cells, the conversion of DNA into RNA is called transcription. The virus
(or the infected cell) therefore had to possess the reverse capacity:
reverse transcription. “Temin had an inkling, but his proof was so
circumstantial—so frail—that he could barely convince anyone,” the
virologist Michael Bishop recalled twenty-five years later. “The
hypothesis had earned him little but ridicule and grief.”</p>
<p>At first, Temin could barely even convince himself. He had made a
bold proposition, but he needed proof. In 1960, determined to find
experimental proof, Temin moved his lab to the McArdle laboratory in
Wisconsin. Madison, unlike Caltech, was a frozen, faraway place,
isolated both physically and intellectually, but this suited Temin.
Standing unknowingly at the edge of a molecular revolution, he wanted
silence. On his daily walk along Lakeshore path, often blanketed in
dense snow, Temin planned experiments to find evidence for this reverse
flow of information.</p>
<p>RNA into DNA. Even the thought made him shiver: a molecule that could
write history backward, turn back the relentless forward flow of
biological information. To prove that such a process existed, Temin
would need to isolate in a test tube the viral enzyme that could reverse
transcription and prove that it could make a DNA copy out of RNA. In the
early 1960s, pursuing the enzyme, he hired a Japanese postdoctoral
student named Satoshi Mizutani. Mizutani’s task was to purify this
reverse transcription enzyme from virus-infected cells.</p>
<p>Mizutani was a catastrophe. Never a cell biologist at heart, as a
colleague recalled, he contaminated the cells, infected the cultures,
and grew out balls of fungi in the petri dishes. Frustrated, Temin moved
Mizutani to a project involving no cells. If Mizutani couldn’t
manipulate cells, he could try to purify the enzyme out of chemical
extracts made from virus-infected cells. The move played to Mizutani’s
natural skills: he was an incredibly gifted chemist. Overnight, he
picked up a weak, flickering enzymatic activity in the cellular extracts
of the Rous virus that was capable of converting RNA into DNA. When he
added RNA to this cellular extract, he could “see” it creating a DNA
copy—reversing transcription. Temin had his proof. Rous sarcoma virus
was no ordinary virus. It could write genetic information backward: it
was a retrovirus.*</p>
<p>At MIT, in Boston, another young virologist, David Baltimore, had
also picked up the hint of an RNA → DNA conversion activity, although in
a different retrovirus. Brilliant, brash, and single-minded, Baltimore
had met and befriended Howard Temin in the 1940s at science summer camp
in Maine, where Temin had been a teaching assistant and Baltimore a
student. They had parted ways for nearly a decade, yet their
intellectual paths had kept crisscrossing. As Temin was exploring
reverse transcription in Rous sarcoma virus in Madison, Baltimore had
begun to amass evidence that his retrovirus also possessed an enzyme
that could convert RNA into DNA. He, too, was steps away from isolating
the enzyme.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 27, 1970, a few weeks after he had found
initial evidence for the RNA → DNA converting enzyme in his lab, Temin
caught a flight to Houston to present his work at the Tenth
International Cancer Congress. The next morning, he walked to the
cavernous auditorium at the Houston Civic Center. Temin’s talk was
entitled “The Role of DNA in the Replication of RNA Viruses,” a title
left intentionally bland. It was a short, fifteen-minute session. The
room was filled mainly with tumor virus specialists, many already dozing
off to sleep.</p>
<p>But as Temin began to unfold his findings, the importance of his talk
dawned on the audience. On the surface, as one researcher recalled, “It
was all very dry biochemistry. . . . Temin spoke in his usual nasal,
high-pitched monotone, giving no indication of excitement.” But the
significance of the work crystallized out of the dry biochemical
monotone. Temin was not just talking about viruses. He was
systematically dismantling one of the fundamental principles of biology.
His listeners became restive, unnerved. By the time Temin reached the
middle of the talk, there was an awestruck silence. Scientists in the
audience were feverishly taking notes, filling page after page with
harrowed scribbles. Once outside the conference room, Temin recalled,
“You could see people on the telephone. . . . People called people in
their laboratories.” Temin’s announcement that he had identified the
long-sought-after enzyme activity in the virus-infected cells left
little doubt about the theory. RNA could generate DNA. A cancer-causing
virus’s genome could become a physical part of a cell’s genes.</p>
<p>Temin returned to Madison the next morning to find his laboratory
inundated with phone messages. The most urgent of these was from David
Baltimore, who had heard an inkling of Temin’s news from the meeting.
Temin called him back.</p>
<p>“You know there is [an enzyme] in the virus particles,” Baltimore
said.</p>
<p>“I know,” said Temin.</p>
<p>Baltimore, who had kept his own work very, very quiet, was stunned.
“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“We found it.”</p>
<p>Baltimore had also found it. He, too, had identified the RNA → DNA
enzymatic activity from the virus particles. Each laboratory, working
apart, had converged on the same result. Temin and Baltimore both rushed
their observations to publication. Their twin reports appeared
back-to-back in Nature magazine in the summer of 1970.</p>
<p>In their respective papers, Temin and Baltimore proposed a radical
new theory about the life cycle of retroviruses. The genes of
retroviruses, they postulated, exist as RNA outside cells. When these
RNA viruses infect cells, they make a DNA copy of their genes and attach
this copy to the cell’s genes. This DNA copy, called a provirus, makes
RNA copies, and the virus is regenerated, phoenixlike, to form new
viruses. The virus is thus constantly shuttling states, rising from the
cellular genome and falling in again—RNA to DNA to RNA; RNA to DNA to
RNA—ad infinitum.</p>
<p>It is surely a sign of the prevailing schizophrenia of the time that
Temin’s work was instantly embraced as a possible mechanistic
explanation for cancer by cancer scientists, but largely ignored by
clinical oncologists. Temin’s presentation in Houston was part of a
mammoth meeting on cancer. Both Farber and Frei had flown in from Boston
to attend. Yet, the conference epitomized the virtually insurmountable
segregation between cancer therapy and cancer science. Chemotherapy and
surgery were discussed in one room. Viral carcinogenesis was discussed
in another. It was as if a sealed divider had been constructed through
the middle of the world of cancer, with “cause” on one side and “cure”
on the other. Few scientists or clinical oncologists crossed between the
two isolated worlds. Frei and Farber returned to Boston with no
significant change in the trajectories of their thoughts about curing
cancer.</p>
<p>Yet for some scientists attending the conference, Temin’s work,
pushed to its logical extreme, suggested a powerful mechanistic
explanation for cancer, and thus a well-defined path toward a cure. Sol
Spiegelman, a Columbia University virologist known for his incendiary
enthusiasm and relentless energy, heard Temin’s talk and instantly built
a monumental theory out of it—a theory so fiercely logical that
Spiegelman could almost conjure it into reality. Temin had suggested
that an RNA virus could enter a cell, make a DNA copy of its genes, and
attach itself to a cell’s genome. Spiegelman was convinced that this
process, through a yet unknown mechanism, could activate a viral gene.
That activated viral gene must induce the infected cell to
proliferate—unleashing pathological mitosis, cancer.</p>
<p>It was a tantalizingly attractive explanation. Rous’s viral theory of
the origin of cancer would fuse with Boveri’s internal genetic theory.
The virus, Temin had shown, could become an endogenous element attached
to a cell’s genes, and thus both an internal aberration and an exogenous
infection would be responsible for cancer. “Spiegelman’s conversion to
the new religion [of cancer viruses] took only minutes,” Robert
Weinberg, the MIT cancer biologist recalled. “The next day [after
Temin’s conference] he was back in his lab at Columbia University in New
York City, setting up a repeat of the work.”</p>
<p>Spiegelman raced off to prove that retroviruses caused human cancers.
“It became his single-minded preoccupation,” Weinberg recalled. The
obsession bore fruit quickly. For Spiegelman’s schema to work, he would
need to prove that human cancers had retrovirus genes hidden inside
them. Working fast and hard, Spiegelman found traces of retroviruses in
human leukemia, in breast cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, brain tumors,
melanomas—in nearly every human cancer that he examined. The Special
Virus Cancer Program, launched in the 1950s to hunt for human cancer
viruses, and moribund for two decades, was swiftly resuscitated: here,
at long last, were the thousands of cancer viruses that it had so long
waited to discover. Money poured into Spiegelman’s lab from the SVCP’s
coffers. It was a perfect folie à deux—endless funds fueling limitless
enthusiasm and vice versa. The more Spiegelman looked for retroviruses
in cancer cells, the more he found, and the more funds were sent his
way.</p>
<p>In the end, though, Spiegelman’s effort turned out to be
systematically flawed. In his frenzied hunt for human cancer
retroviruses, Spiegelman had pushed the virus-detection test so hard
that he saw viruses or traces of viruses that did not exist. When other
labs around the nation tried to replicate the work in the mid-1970s,
Spiegelman’s viruses were nowhere to be found. Only one human cancer, it
turned out, was caused by a human retrovirus—a rare leukemia endemic in
some parts of the Caribbean. “The hoped-for human virus slipped quietly
away into the night,” Weinberg wrote. “The hundreds of millions of
dollars spent by the SVCP . . . could not make it happen. The rocket
never left its launching pad.”</p>
<p>Spiegelman’s conjecture about human retroviruses was half-right and
half-wrong: he was looking for the right kind of virus but in the wrong
kind of cell. Retroviruses would turn out to be the cause of a different
disease—not cancer. Spiegelman died in 1983 of pancreatic cancer, having
heard of a strange illness erupting among gay men and blood-transfusion
recipients in New York and San Francisco. One year after Sol
Spiegelman’s death in New York, the cause of that disease was finally
identified. It was a human retrovirus called HIV.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other cancer-causing viruses, such as SV40 and human
papillomavirus (HPV), would eventually be discovered in 1960 and 1983,
respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Temin’s statement was speculative, but it bore his unerring
biological instinct. Formal proof of the structural attachment of RSV
genes into the cellular genome would only come years later.</p></li>
<li><p>The term retrovirus was coined later by virologists.</p></li>
