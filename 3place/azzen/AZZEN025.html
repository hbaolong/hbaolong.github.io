<p>All others [must] have data”</p>
<p>In science, ideology tends to corrupt; absolute ideology, [corrupts]
absolutely.</p>
<p>—Robert Nisbet</p>
<p>Orthodoxy in surgery is like orthodoxy in other departments of the
mind—it . . . begins to almost challenge a comparison with religion.</p>
<p>—Geoffrey Keynes</p>
<p>You mean I had a mastectomy for nothing?</p>
<p>—Rose Kushner</p>
<p>Farber was fortunate to have lived in the right time, but he was
perhaps even more fortunate to have died at the right time. The year of
his death, 1973, marked the beginning of a deeply fractured and
contentious period in the history of cancer. Theories were shattered;
drug discoveries stagnated; trials languished; and academic meetings
degenerated into all-out brawls. Radiotherapists, chemotherapists, and
surgeons fought viciously for power and information. The War on Cancer
seemed, at times, to have devolved into a war within cancer.</p>
<p>The unraveling began at the very center of oncology. Radical surgery,
Halsted’s cherished legacy, had undergone an astonishing boom in the
1950s and ’60s. At surgical conferences around the world, Halsted’s
descendants—powerful and outspoken surgeons such as Cushman Haagensen
and Jerome Urban—had stood up to announce that they had outdone the
master himself in their radicalism. “In my own surgical attack on
carcinoma of the breast,” Haagensen wrote in 1956, “I have followed the
fundamental principle that the disease, even in its early stage, is such
a formidable enemy that it is my duty to carry out as radical an
operation as the . . . anatomy permits.”</p>
<p>The radical mastectomy had thus edged into the “superradical” and
then into the “ultraradical,” an extraordinarily morbid, disfiguring
procedure in which surgeons removed the breast, the pectoral muscles,
the axillary nodes, the chest wall, and occasionally the ribs, parts of
the sternum, the clavicle, and the lymph nodes inside the chest.</p>
<p>Halsted, meanwhile, had become the patron saint of cancer surgery, a
deity presiding over his comprehensive “theory” of cancer. He had called
it, with his Shakespearean ear for phrasemaking, the “centrifugal
theory”—the idea that cancer, like a malevolent pinwheel, tended to
spread in ever-growing arcs from a single central focus in the body.
Breast cancer, he claimed, spun out from the breast into the lymph nodes
under the arm (poetically again, he called these nodes “sentinels”),
then cartwheeled mirthlessly through the blood into the liver, lungs,
and bones. A surgeon’s job was to arrest that centrifugal spread by
cutting every piece of it out of the body, as if to catch and break the
wheel in midspin. This meant treating early breast cancer aggressively
and definitively. The more a surgeon cut, the more he cured.</p>
<p>Even for patients, that manic diligence had become a form of therapy.
Women wrote to their surgeons in admiration and awe, begging them not to
spare their surgical extirpations, as if surgery were an anagogical
ritual that would simultaneously rid them of cancer and uplift them into
health. Haagensen transformed from surgeon to shaman: “To some extent,”
he wrote about his patients, “no doubt, they transfer the burden [of
their disease] to me.” Another surgeon wrote—chillingly—that he
sometimes “operated on cancer of the breast solely for its effect on
morale.” He also privately noted, “I do not despair of carcinoma being
cured somewhere in the future, but this blessed achievement will, I
believe, never be wrought by the knife of the surgeon.”</p>
<p>Halsted may have converted an entire generation of physicians in
America to believe in the “blessed achievement” of his surgical knife.
But the farther one got from Baltimore, the less, it seemed, was the
force of his centrifugal theory; at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in
London, a young doctor named Geoffrey Keynes was not so convinced.</p>
<p>In August 1924, Keynes examined a patient with breast cancer, a thin,
emaciated woman of forty-seven with an ulcerated malignant lump in her
breast. In Baltimore or in New York, such a patient would immediately
have been whisked off for radical surgery. But Keynes was concerned
about his patient’s constitutional frailty. Rather than reaching
indiscriminately for a radical procedure (which would likely have killed
her at the operating table), he opted for a much more conservative
strategy. Noting that radiation therapists, such as Emil Grubbe, had
demonstrated the efficacy of X-rays in treating breast cancer, Keynes
buried fifty milligrams of radium in her breast to irradiate her tumor
and monitored her to observe the effect, hoping, at best, to palliate
her symptoms. Surprisingly, he found a marked improvement. “The ulcer
rapidly heal[ed],” he wrote, “and the whole mass [became] smaller,
softer and less fixed.” Her mass reduced so rapidly, Keynes thought he
might be able to perform a rather minimal, nonradical surgery on her to
completely remove it.</p>
<p>Emboldened by his success, between 1924 and 1928, Keynes attempted
other variations on the same strategy. The most successful of these
permutations, he found, involved a careful mixture of surgery and
radiation, both at relatively small doses. He removed the malignant
lumps locally with a minor operation (i.e., without resorting to radical
or ultraradical surgery). He followed the surgery with radiation to the
breast. There was no stripping of nodes, no cracking or excavation of
clavicles, no extirpations that stretched into six or eight hours.
Nothing was radical, yet, in case after case, Keynes and his colleagues
found that their cancer recurrence rate was at least comparable to those
obtained in New York or Baltimore—achieved without grinding patients
through the terrifying crucible of radical surgery.</p>
<p>In 1927, in a rather technical report to his department, Keynes
reviewed his experience combining local surgery with radiation. For some
cases of breast cancer, he wrote, with characteristic understatement,
the “extension of [the] operation beyond a local removal might sometimes
be unnecessary.” Everything about Keynes’s sentence was carefully,
strategically, almost surgically constructed. Its implication was
enormous. If local surgery resulted in the same outcome as radical
surgery, then the centrifugal theory had to be reconsidered. Keynes had
slyly declared war on radical surgery, even if he had done so by
pricking it with a pin-size lancet.</p>
<p>But Halsted’s followers in America laughed away Keynes’s efforts.
They retaliated, by giving his operation a nickname: the lumpectomy. The
name was like a low-minded joke, a cartoon surgery in which a
white-coated doctor pulls out a body part and calls it a “lump.”
Keynes’s theory and operation were largely ignored by American surgeons.
He gained fame briefly in Europe as a pioneer of blood transfusions
during the First World War, but his challenge to radical surgery was
quietly buried.</p>
<p>Keynes would have remained conveniently forgotten by American
surgeons except for a fateful series of events. In 1953, a colleague of
Keynes’s, on sabbatical from St. Bart’s at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio,
gave a lecture on the history of breast cancer, focusing on Keynes’s
observations on minimal surgery for the breast. In the audience that
evening was a young surgeon named George Barney Crile. Crile and Keynes
had never met, but they shared old intellectual debts. Crile’s father,
George Crile Sr., had pioneered the use of blood transfusions in America
and written a widely read textbook on the subject. During the First
World War, Keynes had learned to transfuse blood in sterilized,
cone-shaped glass vessels—an apparatus devised, in part, by the elder
Dr. Crile.</p>
<p>Political revolutions, the writer Amitav Ghosh writes, often occur in
the courtyards of palaces, in spaces on the cusp of power, located
neither outside nor inside. Scientific revolutions, in contrast,
typically occur in basements, in buried-away places removed from
mainstream corridors of thought. But a surgical revolution must emanate
from within surgery’s inner sanctum—for surgery is a profession
intrinsically sealed to outsiders. To even enter the operating theater,
one must be soused in soap and water, and surgical tradition. To change
surgery, one must be a surgeon.</p>
<p>The Criles, father and son, were quintessential surgical insiders.
The elder Crile, an early proponent of radical surgery, was a
contemporary of Halsted’s. The younger had learned the radical
mastectomy from students of Halsted himself. The Criles were steeped in
Halstedian tradition, upholding the very pole staffs of radical surgery
for generations. But like Keynes in London, Crile Jr. was beginning to
have his own doubts about the radical mastectomy. Animal studies
performed in mice (by Skipper in Alabama, among others) had revealed
that tumors implanted in animals did not behave as Halsted might have
imagined. When a large tumor was grown in one site, microscopic
metastatic deposits from it often skipped over the local nodes and
appeared in faraway places such as the liver and the spleen. Cancer
didn’t move centrifugally by whirling through larger and larger ordered
spirals; its spread was more erratic and unpredictable. As Crile pored
through Keynes’s data, the old patterns suddenly began to make sense:
Hadn’t Halsted also observed that patients had died four or five years
after radical surgery from “occult” metastasis? Could breast cancer in
these patients also have metastasized to faraway organs even before
radical surgery?</p>
<p>The flaw in the logic began to crystallize. If the tumor was locally
confined to start with, Crile argued, then it would be adequately
removed by local surgery and radiation, and manically stripping away
extra nodes and muscles could add no possible benefit. In contrast, if
breast cancer had already spread outside the breast, then surgery would
be useless anyway, and more aggressive surgery would simply be more
aggressively useless. Breast cancer, Crile realized, was either an
inherently localized disease—thus curable by a smaller mastectomy—or an
inherently systemic disease—thus incurable even by the most exhaustive
surgery.</p>
<p>Crile soon gave up on the radical mastectomy altogether and, instead,
began to operate in a manner similar to Keynes’s, using a limited
surgical approach (Crile called it the “simple mastectomy”). Over about
six years, he found that his “simple” operation was remarkably similar
to Keynes’s lumpectomy+radiation combination in its impact: the survival
rate of patients treated with either form of local surgery tended to be
no different from that of those treated historically with the radical
mastectomy. Separated by an ocean and forty years of clinical practice,
both Keynes and Crile had seemingly stumbled on the same clinical
truth.</p>
<p>But was it a truth? Keynes had had no means to prove it. Until the
1930s, clinical trials had typically been designed to prove positive
results: treatment A was better than treatment B, or drug X superior to
drug Y. But to prove a negative result—that radical surgery was no
better than conventional surgery—one needed a new set of statistical
measures.</p>
<p>The invention of that measure would have a profound influence on the
history of oncology, a branch of medicine particularly suffused with
hope (and thus particularly prone to unsubstantiated claims of success).
In 1928, four years after Keynes had begun his lumpectomies in London,
two statisticians, Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, provided a systematic
method to evaluate a negative statistical claim. To measure the
confidence in a negative claim, Neyman and Pearson invoked a statistical
concept called power. “Power” in simplistic terms, is a measure of the
ability of a test or trial to reject a hypothesis. Intuitively, Neyman
and Pearson reasoned that a scientist’s capacity to reject a hypothesis
depends most critically on how intensively he has tested the
hypothesis—and thus, on the number of samples that have independently
been tested. If one compares five radical mastectomies against five
conventional mastectomies and finds no difference in outcome, it is hard
to make a significant conclusion about the result. But if a thousand
cases of each produce precisely identical outcomes, then one can make a
strong claim about a lack of benefit.</p>
<p>Right there, buried inside that dependence, lies one of the strangest
pitfalls of medicine. For any trial to be adequately “powered,” it needs
to recruit an adequate number of patients. But to recruit patients, a
trialist has to convince doctors to participate in the trial—and yet
these doctors are often precisely those who have the least interest in
having a theory rejected or disproved. For breast cancer, a discipline
immersed in the legacy of the radical surgery, these conflicts were
particularly charged. No breast cancer trial, for instance, could have
proceeded without the explicit blessing and participation of
larger-than-life surgeons such as Haagensen and Urban. Yet these
surgeons, all enraptured intellectual descendants of Halsted, were the
least likely to sponsor a trial that might dispute the theory that they
had so passionately advocated for decades. When critics wondered whether
Haagensen had been biased in his evaluation by selecting only his best
cases, he challenged surgeons to replicate his astounding success using
their own alternative methods: “Go thou and do likewise.”</p>
<p>Thus even Crile—a full forty years after Keynes’s discovery—couldn’t
run a trial to dispute Halsted’s mastectomy. The hierarchical practice
of medicine, its internal culture, its rituals of practice (“The
Gospel[s] of the Surgical Profession,” as Crile mockingly called it),
were ideally arranged to resist change and to perpetuate orthodoxy.
Crile found himself pitted against his own department, against friends
and colleagues. The very doctors that he would need to recruit to run
such a trial were fervently, often viciously, opposed to it. “Power,” in
the colloquial sense of the word, thus collided with “power” in the
statistical sense. The surgeons who had so painstakingly created the
world of radical surgery had absolutely no incentive to revolutionize
it.</p>
<p>It took a Philadelphia surgeon named Bernard Fisher to cut through
that knot of surgical tradition. Fisher was brackish, ambitious, dogged,
and feisty—a man built after Halsted’s image. He had trained at the
University of Pittsburgh, a place just as steeped in the glorious
Halstedian tradition of radical surgery as the hospitals of New York and
Baltimore. But he came from a younger generation of surgeons—a
generation with enough critical distance from Halsted to be able to
challenge the discipline without undermining its own sense of
credibility. Like Crile and Keynes, he, too, had lost faith in the
centrifugal theory of cancer. The more he revisited Keynes’s and Crile’s
data, the more Fisher was convinced that radical mastectomy had no basis
in biological reality. The truth, he suspected, was quite the opposite.
“It has become apparent that the tangled web of threads on the wrong
side of the tapestry really represented a beautiful design when examined
properly, a meaningful pattern, a hypothesis . . . diametrically
opposite to those considered to be ‘halstedian,’” Fisher wrote.</p>
<p>The only way to turn the upside-down tapestry of Halstedian theory
around was to run a controlled clinical trial to test the radical
mastectomy against the simple mastectomy and lumpectomy+radiation. But
Fisher also knew that resistance would be fierce to any such trial.
Holed away in their operating rooms, their slip-covered feet dug into
the very roots of radical surgery, most academic surgeons were least
likely to cooperate.</p>
<p>But another person in that operating room was stirring awake: the
long-silent, etherized body lying at the far end of the scalpel—the
cancer patient. By the late 1960s, the relationship between doctors and
patients had begun to shift dramatically. Medicine, once considered
virtually infallible in its judgment, was turning out to have deep
fallibilities—flaws that appeared to cluster pointedly around issues of
women’s health. Thalidomide, prescribed widely to control
pregnancy-associated “hysteria” and “anxiety,” was hastily withdrawn
from the market in 1961 because of its propensity to cause severe fetal
malformations. In Texas, Jane Roe (a pseudonym) sued the state for
blocking her ability to abort her fetus at a medical clinic—launching
the Roe v. Wade case on abortion and highlighting the complex nexus
between the state, medical authority, and women’s bodies. Political
feminism, in short, was birthing medical feminism—and the fact that one
of the most common and most disfiguring operations performed on women’s
bodies had never been formally tested in a trial stood out as even more
starkly disturbing to a new generation of women. “Refuse to submit to a
radical mastectomy,” Crile exhorted his patients in 1973.</p>
<p>And refuse they did. Rachel Carson, the author of Silent Spring and a
close friend of Crile’s, refused a radical mastectomy (in retrospect,
she was right: her cancer had already spread to her bones and radical
surgery would have been pointless). Betty Rollin and Rose Kushner also
refused and soon joined Carson in challenging radical surgeons. Rollin
and Kushner—both marvelous writers: provocative, down-to-earth,
no-nonsense, witty—were particularly adept at challenging the bloated
orthodoxy of surgery. They flooded newspapers and magazines with
editorials and letters and appeared (often uninvited) at medical and
surgical conferences, where they fearlessly heckled surgeons about their
data and the fact that the radical mastectomy had never been put to a
test. “Happily for women,” Kushner wrote, “. . . surgical custom is
changing.” It was as if the young woman in Halsted’s famous etching—the
patient that he had been so “loathe to disfigure”—had woken up from her
gurney and begun to ask why, despite his “loathing,” the cancer surgeon
was so keen to disfigure her.</p>
<p>In 1967, bolstered by the activism of patients and the public
attention swirling around breast cancer, Fisher became the new chair of
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), a
consortium of academic hospitals modeled self-consciously after Zubrod’s
leukemia group that would run large-scale trials in breast cancer. Four
years later, the NSABP proposed to test the operation using a
systematic, randomized trial. It was, coincidentally, the eightieth
“anniversary” of Halsted’s original description of the radical
mastectomy. The implicit, nearly devotional faith in a theory of cancer
was finally to be put to a test. “The clinician, no matter how
venerable, must accept the fact that experience, voluminous as it might
be, cannot be employed as a sensitive indicator of scientific validity,”
Fisher wrote in an article. He was willing to have faith in divine
wisdom, but not in Halsted as divine wisdom. “In God we trust,” he
brusquely told a journalist. “All others [must] have data.”</p>
<p>It took Fisher a full ten years to actually gather that data.
Recruiting patients for his study was an uphill task. “To get a woman to
participate in a clinical trial where she was going to have her breast
off or have her breast not taken off, that was a pretty difficult thing
to do. Not like testing Drug A versus Drug B,” he recalled.</p>
<p>If patients were reluctant, surgeons were almost impossibly so.
Immersed in the traditions of radical surgery, many American surgeons
put up such formidable barriers to patient recruitment that Canadian
surgeons and their patients were added to complete the study. The trial
recruited 1,765 patients in thirty-four centers in the United States and
Canada. Patients were randomized into three groups: one treated with the
radical mastectomy, the second with simple mastectomy, and the third
with surgery followed by radiation. Even with all forces in gear, it
still took years to recruit adequate numbers. Crippled by forces within
surgery itself, the NSABP-04 trial barely hobbled to its end.</p>
<p>In 1981, the results of the trial were finally made public. The rates
of breast cancer recurrence, relapse, death, and distant cancer
metastasis were statistically identical among all three groups. The
group treated with the radical mastectomy had paid heavily in morbidity,
but accrued no benefits in survival, recurrence, or mortality.</p>
<p>Between 1891 and 1981, in the nearly one hundred years of the radical
mastectomy, an estimated five hundred thousand women underwent the
procedure to “extirpate” cancer. Many chose the procedure. Many were
forced into it. Many others did not even realize that it was a choice.
Many were permanently disfigured; many perceived the surgery as a
benediction; many suffered its punishing penalties bravely, hoping that
they had treated their cancer as aggressively and as definitively as
possible. Halsted’s “cancer storehouse” grew far beyond its original
walls at Hopkins. His ideas entered oncology, then permeated its
vocabulary, then its psychology, its ethos, and its self-image. When
radical surgery fell, an entire culture of surgery thus collapsed with
it. The radical mastectomy is rarely, if ever, performed by surgeons
today.</p>
<p>“The smiling oncologist”</p>
<p>Few doctors in this country seem to be involved with the
non-life-threatening side effects of cancer therapy. . . . In the United
States, baldness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, clogged veins,
financial problems, broken marriages, disturbed children, loss of
libido, loss of self-esteem, and body image are nurses’ turf.</p>
<p>—Rose Kushner</p>
<p>And it is solely by risking life that freedom is obtained.</p>
<p>—Hegel</p>
<p>The ominous toppling of radical surgery off its pedestal may have
given cancer chemotherapists some pause for reckoning. But they had
their own fantasy of radicalism to fulfill, their own radical arsenal to
launch against cancer. Surgery, the traditional battle-ax against
cancer, was considered too primitive, too indiscriminate, and too weary.
A “large-scale chemotherapeutic attack,” as one doctor put it, was
needed to obliterate cancer.</p>
<p>Every battle needs its iconic battleground, and if one physical place
epitomized the cancer wars of the late 1970s, it was the chemotherapy
ward. It was “our trench and our bunker,” a chemotherapist recalls, a
space marked indelibly in the history of cancer. To enter the ward was
to acquire automatic citizenship—as Susan Sontag might have put it—into
the kingdom of the ill.</p>
<p>The journalist Stewart Alsop was confined to one such ward at the NIH
in 1973 for the treatment of a rare and unidentifiable blood cancer.
Crossing its threshold, he encountered a sanitized vision of hell.
“Wandering about the NIH clinical center, in the corridors or in the
elevator, one comes occasionally on a human monster, on a living
nightmare, on a face or body hideously deformed,” he wrote. Patients,
even disguised in “civilian” clothes, could still be identified by the
orange tinge that chemotherapy left on their skin, underneath which
lurked the unique pallor of cancer-related anemia. The space was
limbolike, with no simple means of egress—no exit. In the glass-paneled
sanatorium where patients walked for leisure, Alsop recalled, the
windows were covered in heavy wire mesh to prevent the men and women
confined in the wards from jumping off the banisters and committing
suicide.</p>
<p>A collective amnesia prevailed in these wards. If remembering was an
essential requisite for survival, then so was forgetting. “Although this
was a cancer ward,” an anthropologist wrote, “the word ‘cancer’ was
actively avoided by staff and patients.” Patients lived by the
regulations—“accepted roles, a predetermined routine, constant stimuli.”
The artifice of manufactured cheer (a requirement for soldiers in
battle) made the wards even more poignantly desolate: in one wing, where
a woman lay dying from breast cancer, there were “yellow and orange
walls in the corridors; beige and white stripes in the patients’ rooms.”
At the NIH, in an attempt to inject optimism into the wards, the nurses
wore uniforms with plastic yellow buttons with the cartoonish outline of
a smiling face.</p>
<p>These wards created not just a psychological isolation chamber but
also a physical microenvironment, a sterile bubble where the core theory
of cancer chemotherapy—eradicating cancer with a death-defying
bombardment of drugs—could be adequately tested. It was, undeniably, an
experiment. At the NIH, Alsop wrote pointedly, “Saving the individual
patient is not the essential mission. Enormous efforts are made to do
so, or at least to prolong the patient’s life to the last possible
moment. But the basic purpose is not to save that patient’s particular
life but to find means of saving the lives of others.”</p>
<p>In some cases, the experiment worked. In 1976, the year that the
NSABP-04 trial struggled to its midpoint, a novel drug, cisplatin,
appeared in the cancer wards. Cisplatin—short for cis-platinum—was a new
drug forged out of an old one. Its molecular structure, a central planar
platinum atom with four “arms” extending outward, had been described
back in the 1890s. But chemists had never found an application for
cisplatin: the beautiful, satisfyingly symmetric chemical structure had
no obvious human use. It had been shelved away in the laboratory in
relative obscurity. No one had bothered to test its biological
effects.</p>
<p>In 1965, at Michigan State University, a biophysicist, Barnett
Rosenberg, began to investigate whether electrical currents might
stimulate bacterial cell division. Rosenberg devised a bacterial flask
through which an electrical current could be run using two platinum
electrodes. When Rosenberg turned the electricity on, he found,
astonishingly, that the bacterial cells stopped dividing entirely.
Rosenberg initially proposed that the electrical current was the active
agent in inhibiting cell division. But the electricity, he soon
determined, was merely a bystander. The platinum electrode had reacted
with the salt in the bacterial solution to generate a new
growth-arresting molecule that had diffused throughout the liquid. That
chemical was cisplatin. Like all cells, bacteria need to replicate DNA
in order to divide. Cisplatin had chemically attacked DNA with its
reactive molecular arms, cross-linking and damaging the molecule
irreparably, forcing cells to arrest their division.</p>
<p>For patients such as John Cleland, cisplatin came to epitomize the
new breed of aggressive chemotherapeutics of the 1970s. In 1973, Cleland
was a twenty-two-year-old veterinary student in Indiana. In August that
year, two months after his marriage, he discovered a rapidly expanding
lump in his right testis. He saw a urologist on a Tuesday afternoon in
November. On Thursday, he was whisked off to the operating room for
surgery. He returned with a scar that extended from his abdomen to his
breastbone. The diagnosis was metastatic testicular cancer—cancer of the
testes that had migrated diffusely into his lymph nodes and lungs.</p>
<p>In 1973, the survival rate from metastatic testes cancer was less
than 5 percent. Cleland entered the cancer ward at Indiana University
and began treatment with a young oncologist named Larry Einhorn. The
regimen, a weather-beaten and toxic three-drug cocktail called ABO that
had been derived from the NCI’s studies in the 1960s—was only marginally
effective. Cleland lived in and out of the hospital. His weight shrank
from 158 to 106 pounds. One day in 1974, while he was still receiving
chemo, his wife suggested that they sit outside to enjoy the afternoon.
Cleland realized, to his utter shame, that he was too weak to stand up.
He was carried to his bed like a baby, weeping with embarrassment.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1974, the ABO regimen was stopped. He was switched to
another equally ineffective drug. Einhorn suggested a last-ditch effort:
a new chemical called cisplatin. Other researchers had seen some
responses in patients with testicular cancer treated with single-agent
cisplatin, although not durable ones. Einhorn wanted to combine
cisplatin with two other drugs to see if he could increase the response
rate.</p>
<p>There was the uncertainty of a new combination and the certainty of
death. On October 7, 1974, Cleland took the gamble: he enrolled as
“patient zero” for BVP, the acronym for a new regimen containing
bleomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin (abbreviated P for “platinum”).
Ten days later, when he returned for his routine scans, the tumors in
his lungs had vanished. Ecstatic and mystified, he called his wife from
a hospital phone. “I cannot remember what I said, but I told her.”</p>
<p>Cleland’s experience was typical. By 1975, Einhorn had treated twenty
additional patients with the regimen and found dramatic and sustained
responses virtually unheard of in the history of this disease. Einhorn
presented his data at the annual meeting of oncologists held in Toronto
in the winter of 1975. “Walking up to that podium was like my own walk
on the moon,” he recalled. By the late winter of 1976, it was becoming
progressively clearer that some of these patients would not relapse at
all. Einhorn had cured a solid cancer by chemotherapy. “It was
unforgettable. In my own naive mind I thought this was the formula that
we had been missing all the while.”</p>
<p>Cisplatin was unforgettable in more than one sense. The drug provoked
an unremitting nausea, a queasiness of such penetrating force and
quality that had rarely been encountered in the history of medicine: on
average, patients treated with the drug vomited twelve times a day. (In
the 1970s, there were few effective antinausea drugs. Most patients had
to be given intravenous fluids to tide them through the nausea; some
survived by smuggling marijuana, a mild antiemetic, into the
chemotherapy wards.) In Margaret Edson’s play Wit, a scathing depiction
of a woman’s battle with ovarian cancer, an English professor undergoing
chemotherapy clutches a nausea basin on the floor of her hospital ward,
dry-heaving in guttural agony (prompting her unforgettable aside, “You
may think my vocabulary has taken a turn for the Anglo-Saxon”). The
pharmacological culprit lurking unmentioned behind that scene is
cisplatin. Even today, nurses on oncology floors who tended to patients
in the early 1980s (before the advent of newer antiemetics that would
somewhat ease the effect of the drug) can vividly recollect the violent
jolts of nausea that suddenly descended on patients and brought them
dry-heaving to the ground. In nursing slang, the drug came to be known
as “cisflatten.”</p>
<p>These side effects, however revolting, were considered minor dues to
pay for an otherwise miraculous drug. Cisplatin was touted as the epic
chemotherapeutic product of the late 1970s, the quintessential example
of how curing cancer involved pushing patients nearly to the brink of
death. By 1978, cisplatin-based chemotherapy was the new vogue in cancer
pharmacology; every conceivable combination was being tested on
thousands of patients across America. The lemon-yellow chemical dripping
through intravenous lines was as ubiquitous in the cancer wards as the
patients clutching their nausea basins afterward.</p>
<p>The NCI meanwhile was turning into a factory of toxins. The influx of
money from the National Cancer Act had potently stimulated the
institute’s drug-discovery program, which had grown into an even more
gargantuan effort and was testing hundreds of thousands of chemicals
each year to discover new cytotoxic drugs. The strategy of discovery was
empirical—throwing chemicals at cancer cells in test tubes to identify
cancer killers—but, by now, unabashedly and defiantly so. The biology of
cancer was still poorly understood. But the notion that even relatively
indiscriminate cytotoxic agents discovered largely by accident would
cure cancer had captivated oncology. “We want and need and seek better
guidance and are gaining it,” Howard Skipper (Frei and Freireich’s
collaborator on the early leukemia studies) admitted in 1971, “but we
cannot afford to sit and wait for the promise of tomorrow so long as
stepwise progress can be made with tools at hand today.” Ehrlich’s
seductive phrase—“magic bullet”—had seemingly been foreshortened. What
this war needed was simply “bullets,” whether magical or not, to
annihilate cancer.</p>
<p>Chemicals thus came pouring out of the NCI’s cauldrons, each one with
a unique personality. There was Taxol, one gram purified from the bark
of a hundred Pacific yew trees, whose molecular structure resembled a
winged insect. Adriamycin, discovered in 1969, was bloodred (it was the
chemical responsible for the orange-red tinge that Alsop had seen at the
NCI’s cancer ward); even at therapeutic doses, it could irreversibly
damage the heart. Etoposide came from the fruit of the poisonous
mayapple. Bleomycin, which could scar lungs without warning, was an
antibiotic derived from a mold.</p>
<p>“Did we believe we were going to cure cancer with these chemicals?”
George Canellos recalled. “Absolutely, we did. The NCI was a charged
place. The chief [Zubrod] wanted the boys to move into solid tumors. I
proposed ovarian cancer. Others proposed breast cancer. We wanted to get
started on the larger clinical problems. We spoke of curing cancer as if
it was almost a given.”</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, high-dose combination chemotherapy scored another
sentinel victory. Burkitt’s lymphoma, the tumor originally discovered in
southern Africa (and rarely found in children and adolescents in America
and Europe), was cured with a cocktail of seven drugs, including a
molecular cousin of nitrogen mustard—a regimen concocted at the NCI by
Ian Magrath and John Ziegler.* The felling of yet another aggressive
tumor by combination chemotherapy even more potently boosted the
institute’s confidence—once again underscoring the likelihood that the
“generic solution” to cancer had been found.</p>
<p>Events outside the world of medicine also impinged on oncology,
injecting new blood and verve into the institute. In the early 1970s,
young doctors who opposed the Vietnam War flooded to the NCI. (Due to an
obscure legal clause, enrollment in a federal research program, such as
the NIH, exempted someone from the draft.) The undrafted soldiers of one
battle were thus channeled into another. “Our applications skyrocketed.
They were brilliant and energetic, these new fellows at the institute,”
Canellos said. “They wanted to run new trials, to test new permutations
of drugs. We were a charged place.” At the NCI and in its academic
outposts around the world, the names of regimens evolved into a language
of their own: ABVD, BEP, C-MOPP, ChlaVIP, CHOP, ACT.</p>
<p>“There is no cancer that is not potentially curable,” an ovarian
cancer chemotherapist self-assuredly told the media at a conference in
1979. “The chances in some cases are infinitesimal, but the potential is
still there. This is about all that patients need to know and it is
about all that patients want to know.”</p>
<p>The greatly expanded coffers of the NCI also stimulated enormous,
expensive, multi-institutional trials, allowing academic centers to trot
out ever more powerful permutations of cytotoxic drugs. Cancer
hospitals, also boosted by the NCI’s grants, organized themselves into
efficient and thrumming trial-running machines. By 1979, the NCI had
recognized twenty so-called Comprehensive Cancer Centers spread across
the nation—hospitals with large wards dedicated exclusively to
cancer—run by specialized teams of surgeons and chemotherapists and
supported by psychiatrists, pathologists, radiologists, social workers,
and ancillary staff. Hospital review boards that approved and
coordinated human experimentation were revamped to allow researchers to
bulldoze their way through institutional delays.</p>
<p>It was trial and error on a giant human scale—with the emphasis, it
seemed at times, distinctly on error. One NCI-sponsored trial tried to
outdo Einhorn by doubling the dose of cisplatin in testicular cancer.
Toxicity doubled, although there was no additional therapeutic effect.
In another particularly tenacious trial, known as the eight-in-one
study, children with brain tumors were given eight drugs in a single
day. Predictably, horrific complications ensued. Fifteen percent of the
patients needed blood transfusions. Six percent were hospitalized with
life-threatening infections. Fourteen percent of the children suffered
kidney damage; three lost their hearing. One patient died of septic
shock. Yet, despite the punishing escalation of drugs and doses, the
efficacy of the drug regimen remained minimal. Most of the children in
the eight-in-one trial died soon afterward, having only marginally
responded to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This pattern was repeated with tiresome regularity for many forms of
cancer. In metastatic lung cancer, for instance, combination
chemotherapy was found to increase survival by three or four months; in
colon cancer, by less than six months; in breast, by about twelve. (I do
not mean to belittle the impact of twelve or thirteen months of
survival. One extra year can carry a lifetime of meaning for a man or
woman condemned to death from cancer. But it took a particularly
fanatical form of zeal to refuse to recognize that this was far from a
“cure.”) Between 1984 and 1985, at the midpoint of the most aggressive
expansion of chemotherapy, nearly six thousand articles were published
on the subject in medical journals. Not a single article reported a new
strategy for the definitive cure of an advanced solid tumor by means of
combination chemotherapy alone.</p>
<p>Like lunatic cartographers, chemotherapists frantically drew and
redrew their strategies to annihilate cancer. MOPP, the combination that
had proved successful in Hodgkin’s disease, went through every
conceivable permutation for breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. More
combinations entered clinical trials—each more aggressive than its
precursor and each tagged by its own cryptic, nearly indecipherable
name. Rose Kushner (by then, a member of the National Cancer Advisory
Board) warned against the growing disconnect between doctors and their
patients. “When doctors say that the side effects are tolerable or
acceptable, they are talking about life-threatening things,” she wrote.
“But if you just vomit so hard that you break the blood vessels in your
eyes . . . they don’t consider that even mentionable. And they certainly
don’t care if you’re bald.” She wrote sarcastically, “The smiling
oncologist does not know whether his patients vomit or not.”</p>
<p>The language of suffering had parted, with the “smiling oncologist”
on one side and his patients on the other. In Edson’s Wit—a work not
kind to the medical profession—a young oncologist, drunk with the
arrogance of power, personifies the divide as he spouts out lists of
nonsensical drugs and combinations while his patient, the English
professor, watches with mute terror and fury: “Hexamethophosphacil with
Vinplatin to potentiate. Hex at three hundred mg per meter squared. Vin
at one hundred. Today is cycle two, day three. Both cycles at the full
dose.”</p>
