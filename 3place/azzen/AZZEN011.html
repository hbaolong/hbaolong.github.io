<h4 id="dyeing-and-dying">Dyeing and Dying</h4>
<p>Those who have not been trained in chemistry or medicine may not
realize how difficult the problem of cancer treatment really is. It is
almost—not quite, but almost—as hard as finding some agent that will
dissolve away the left ear, say, and leave the right ear unharmed. So
slight is the difference between the cancer cell and its normal
ancestor.</p>
<p>—William Woglom</p>
<p>Life is . . . a chemical incident.</p>
<p>—Paul Ehrlich</p>
<p>as a schoolboy, 1870</p>
<p>A systemic disease demands a systemic cure—but what kind of systemic
therapy could possibly cure cancer? Could a drug, like a microscopic
surgeon, perform an ultimate pharmacological mastectomy—sparing normal
tissue while excising cancer cells? Willy Meyer wasn’t alone in
fantasizing about such a magical therapy—generations of doctors before
him had also fantasized about such a medicine. But how might a drug
coursing through the whole body specifically attack a diseased
organ?</p>
<p>Specificity refers to the ability of any medicine to discriminate
between its intended target and its host. Killing a cancer cell in a
test tube is not a particularly difficult task: the chemical world is
packed with malevolent poisons that, even in infinitesimal quantities,
can dispatch a cancer cell within minutes. The trouble lies in finding a
selective poison—a drug that will kill cancer without annihilating the
patient. Systemic therapy without specificity is an indiscriminate bomb.
For an anticancer poison to become a useful drug, Meyer knew, it needed
to be a fantastically nimble knife: sharp enough to kill cancer yet
selective enough to spare the patient.</p>
<p>The hunt for such specific, systemic poisons for cancer was
precipitated by the search for a very different sort of chemical. The
story begins with colonialism and its chief loot: cotton. In the
mid-1850s, as ships from India and Egypt laden with bales of cotton
unloaded their goods in English ports, cloth milling boomed into a
spectacularly successful business in England, an industry large enough
to sustain an entire gamut of subsidiary industries. A vast network of
mills sprouted up in the industrial basin of the Midlands, stretching
through Glasgow, Lancashire, and Manchester. Textile exports dominated
the British economy. Between 1851 and 1857, the export of printed goods
from England more than quadrupled—from 6 million to 27 million pieces
per year. In 1784, cotton products had represented a mere 6 percent of
total British exports. By the 1850s, that proportion had peaked at 50
percent.</p>
<p>The cloth-milling boom set off a boom in cloth dyeing, but the two
industries—cloth and color—were oddly out of technological step. Dyeing,
unlike milling, was still a preindustrial occupation. Cloth dyes had to
be extracted from perishable vegetable sources—rusty carmines from
Turkish madder root, or deep blues from the indigo plant—using
antiquated processes that required patience, expertise, and constant
supervision. Printing on textiles with colored dyes (to produce the
ever-popular calico prints, for instance) was even more
challenging—requiring thickeners, mordants, and solvents in multiple
steps—and often took the dyers weeks to complete. The textile industry
thus needed professional chemists to dissolve its bleaches and
cleansers, to supervise the extraction of dyes, and to find ways to
fasten the dyes on cloth. A new discipline called practical chemistry,
focused on synthesizing products for textile dyeing, was soon
flourishing in polytechnics and institutes all over London.</p>
<p>In 1856, William Perkin, an eighteen-year-old student at one of these
institutes, stumbled on what would soon become a Holy Grail of this
industry: an inexpensive chemical dye that could be made entirely from
scratch. In a makeshift one-room laboratory in his apartment in the East
End of London (“half of a small but long-shaped room with a few shelves
for bottles and a table”) Perkin was boiling nitric acid and benzene in
smuggled glass flasks and precipitated an unexpected reaction. A
chemical had formed inside the tubes with the color of pale, crushed
violets. In an era obsessed with dye-making, any colored chemical was
considered a potential dye—and a quick dip of a piece of cotton into the
flask revealed the new chemical could color cotton. Moreover, this new
chemical did not bleach or bleed. Perkin called it aniline mauve.</p>
<p>Perkin’s discovery was a godsend for the textile industry. Aniline
mauve was cheap and imperishable—vastly easier to produce and store than
vegetable dyes. As Perkin soon discovered, its parent compound could act
as a molecular building block for other dyes, a chemical skeleton on
which a variety of side chains could be hung to produce a vast spectrum
of vivid colors. By the mid-1860s, a glut of new synthetic dyes, in
shades of lilac, blue, magenta, aquamarine, red, and purple flooded the
cloth factories of Europe. In 1857, Perkin, barely nineteen years old,
was inducted into the Chemical Society of London as a full fellow, one
of the youngest in its history to be thus honored.</p>
<p>Aniline mauve was discovered in England, but dye making reached its
chemical zenith in Germany. In the late 1850s, Germany, a rapidly
industrializing nation, had been itching to compete in the cloth markets
of Europe and America. But unlike England, Germany had scarcely any
access to natural dyes: by the time it had entered the scramble to
capture colonies, the world had already been sliced up into so many
parts, with little left to divide. German cloth millers thus threw
themselves into the development of artificial dyes, hoping to rejoin an
industry that they had once almost given up as a lost cause.</p>
<p>Dye making in England had rapidly become an intricate chemical
business. In Germany—goaded by the textile industry, cosseted by
national subsidies, and driven by expansive economic growth—synthetic
chemistry underwent an even more colossal boom. In 1883, the German
output of alizarin, the brilliant red chemical that imitated natural
carmine, reached twelve thousand tons, dwarfing the amount being
produced by Perkin’s factory in London. German chemists rushed to
produce brighter, stronger, cheaper chemicals and muscled their way into
textile factories all around Europe. By the mid-1880s, Germany had
emerged as the champion of the chemical arms race (which presaged a much
uglier military one) to become the “dye basket” of Europe.</p>
<p>Initially, the German textile chemists lived entirely in the shadow
of the dye industry. But emboldened by their successes, the chemists
began to synthesize not just dyes and solvents, but an entire universe
of new molecules: phenols, alcohols, bromides, alkaloids, alizarins, and
amides, chemicals never encountered in nature. By the late 1870s,
synthetic chemists in Germany had created more molecules than they knew
what to do with. “Practical chemistry” had become almost a caricature of
itself: an industry seeking a practical purpose for the products that it
had so frantically raced to invent.</p>
<p>Early interactions between synthetic chemistry and medicine had
largely been disappointing. Gideon Harvey, a seventeenth-century
physician, had once called chemists the “most impudent, ignorant,
flatulent, fleshy, and vainly boasting sort of mankind.” The mutual
scorn and animosity between the two disciplines had persisted. In 1849,
August Hofmann, William Perkin’s teacher at the Royal College, gloomily
acknowledged the chasm between medicine and chemistry: “None of these
compounds have, as yet, found their way into any of the appliances of
life. We have not been able to use them . . . for curing disease.”</p>
<p>But even Hofmann knew that the boundary between the synthetic world
and the natural world was inevitably collapsing. In 1828, a Berlin
scientist named Friedrich Wöhler had sparked a metaphysical storm in
science by boiling ammonium cyanate, a plain, inorganic salt, and
creating urea, a chemical typically produced by the kidneys. The Wöhler
experiment—seemingly trivial—had enormous implications. Urea was a
“natural” chemical, while its precursor was an inorganic salt. That a
chemical produced by natural organisms could be derived so easily in a
flask threatened to overturn the entire conception of living organisms:
for centuries, the chemistry of living organisms was thought to be
imbued with some mystical property, a vital essence that could not be
duplicated in a laboratory—a theory called vitalism. Wöhler’s experiment
demolished vitalism. Organic and inorganic chemicals, he proved, were
interchangeable. Biology was chemistry: perhaps even a human body was no
different from a bag of busily reacting chemicals—a beaker with arms,
legs, eyes, brain, and soul.</p>
<p>With vitalism dead, the extension of this logic to medicine was
inevitable. If the chemicals of life could be synthesized in a
laboratory, could they work on living systems? If biology and chemistry
were so interchangeable, could a molecule concocted in a flask affect
the inner workings of a biological organism?</p>
<p>Wöhler was a physician himself, and with his students and
collaborators he tried to backpedal from the chemical world into the
medical one. But his synthetic molecules were still much too simple—mere
stick figures of chemistry where vastly more complex molecules were
needed to intervene on living cells.</p>
<p>But such multifaceted chemicals already existed: the laboratories of
the dye factories of Frankfurt were full of them. To build his
interdisciplinary bridge between biology and chemistry, Wöhler only
needed to take a short day-trip from his laboratory in Göttingen to the
labs of Frankfurt. But neither Wöhler nor his students could make that
last connection. The vast panel of molecules sitting idly on the shelves
of the German textile chemists, the precursors of a revolution in
medicine, may as well have been a continent away.</p>
<p>It took a full fifty years after Wöhler’s urea experiment for the
products of the dye industry to finally make physical contact with
living cells. In 1878, in Leipzig, a twenty-four-year-old medical
student, Paul Ehrlich, hunting for a thesis project, proposed using
cloth dyes—aniline and its colored derivatives—to stain animal tissues.
At best, Ehrlich hoped that the dyes might stain the tissues to make
microscopy easier. But to his astonishment, the dyes were far from
indiscriminate darkening agents. Aniline derivatives stained only parts
of the cell, silhouetting certain structures and leaving others
untouched. The dyes seemed able to discriminate among chemicals hidden
inside cells—binding some and sparing others.</p>
<p>This molecular specificity, encapsulated so vividly in that reaction
between a dye and a cell, began to haunt Ehrlich. In 1882, working with
Robert Koch, he discovered yet another novel chemical stain, this time
for mycobacteria, the organisms that Koch had discovered as the cause of
tuberculosis. A few years later, Ehrlich found that certain toxins,
injected into animals, could generate “antitoxins,” which bound and
inactivated poisons with extraordinary specificity (these antitoxins
would later be identified as antibodies). He purified a potent serum
against diphtheria toxin from the blood of horses, then moved to the
Institute for Sera Research and Serum Testing in Steglitz to prepare
this serum in gallon buckets, and then to Frankfurt to set up his own
laboratory.</p>
<p>But the more widely Ehrlich explored the biological world, the more
he spiraled back to his original idea. The biological universe was full
of molecules picking out their partners like clever locks designed to
fit a key: toxins clinging inseparably to antitoxins, dyes that
highlighted only particular parts of cells, chemical stains that could
nimbly pick out one class of germs from a mixture of microbes. If
biology was an elaborate mix-and-match game of chemicals, Ehrlich
reasoned, what if some chemical could discriminate bacterial cells from
animal cells—and kill the former without touching the host?</p>
<p>Returning from a conference late one evening, in the cramped
compartment of a night train from Berlin to Frankfurt, Ehrlich
animatedly described his idea to two fellow scientists, “It has occurred
to me that . . . it should be possible to find artificial substances
which are really and specifically curative for certain diseases, not
merely palliatives acting favorably on one or another symptom. . . .
Such curative substances—a priori—must directly destroy the microbes
responsible for the disease; not by ‘action from a distance,’ but only
when the chemical compound is fixed by the parasites. The parasites can
only be killed if the chemical compound has a particular relation, a
specific affinity for them.”</p>
<p>By then, the other inhabitants of Ehrlich’s train compartment had
dozed off to sleep. But this rant in a train compartment was one of
medicine’s most important ideas in its distilled, primordial form.
“Chemotherapy,” the use of specific chemicals to heal the diseased body,
was conceptually born in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Ehrlich began looking for his “curative substances” in a familiar
place: the treasure trove of dye-industry chemicals that had proved so
crucial to his earlier biological experiments. His laboratory was now
physically situated near the booming dye factories of Frankfurt—the
Frankfurter Anilinfarben-Fabrik and the Leopold Cassella Company—and he
could easily procure dye chemicals and derivatives via a short walk
across the valley. With thousands of compounds available to him, Ehrlich
embarked on a series of experiments to test their biological effects in
animals.</p>
<p>He began with a hunt for antimicrobial chemicals, in part because he
already knew that chemical dyes could specifically bind microbial cells.
He infected mice and rabbits with Trypanosoma gondii, the parasite
responsible for the dreaded sleeping sickness, then injected the animals
with chemical derivatives to determine if any of them could halt the
infection. After several hundred chemicals, Ehrlich and his
collaborators had their first antibiotic hit: a brilliant ruby-colored
dye derivative that Ehrlich called Trypan Red. It was a name—a disease
juxtaposed with a dye color—that captured nearly a century of medical
history.</p>
<p>Galvanized by his discovery, Ehrlich unleashed volleys of chemical
experiments. A universe of biological chemistry opened up before him:
molecules with peculiar properties, a cosmos governed by idiosyncratic
rules. Some compounds switched from precursors into active drugs in the
bloodstream; others transformed backward from active drugs to inactive
molecules. Some were excreted in the urine; others condensed in the bile
or fell apart immediately in the blood. One molecule might survive for
days in an animal, but its chemical cousin—a variant by just a few
critical atoms—might vanish from the body in minutes.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1910, at the densely packed Congress for Internal
Medicine in Wiesbaden, Ehrlich announced that he had discovered yet
another molecule with “specific affinity”—this one a blockbuster. The
new drug, cryptically called compound 606, was active against a
notorious microbe, Treponema pallidum, which caused syphilis. In
Ehrlich’s era, syphilis—the “secret malady” of eighteenth-century
Europe—was a sensational illness, a tabloid pestilence. Ehrlich knew
that an antisyphilitic drug would be an instant sensation and he was
prepared. Compound 606 had secretly been tested in patients in the
hospital wards of St. Petersburg, then retested in patients with
neurosyphilis at the Magdeburg Hospital—each time with remarkable
success. A gigantic factory, funded by Hoechst Chemical Works, was
already being built to manufacture it for commercial use.</p>
<p>Ehrlich’s successes with Trypan Red and compound 606 (which he named
Salvarsan, from the word salvation) proved that diseases were just
pathological locks waiting to be picked by the right molecules. The line
of potentially curable illnesses now stretched endlessly before him.
Ehrlich called his drugs “magic bullets”—bullets for their capacity to
kill and magic for their specificity. It was a phrase with an ancient,
alchemic ring that would sound insistently through the future of
oncology.</p>
<p>Ehrlich’s magic bullets had one last target to fell: cancer. Syphilis
and trypanosomiasis are microbial diseases. Ehrlich was slowly inching
toward his ultimate goal: the malignant human cell. Between 1904 and
1908, he rigged several elaborate schemes to find an anticancer drug
using his vast arsenal of chemicals. He tried amides, anilines, sulfa
derivatives, arsenics, bromides, and alcohols to kill cancer cells. None
of them worked. What was poison to cancer cells, he found, was
inevitably poison to normal cells as well. Discouraged, he tried even
more fantastical strategies. He thought of starving sarcoma cells of
metabolites, or tricking them into death by using decoy molecules (a
strategy that would presage Subbarao’s antifolate derivatives by nearly
fifty years). But the search for the ultimate, discriminating anticancer
drug proved fruitless. His pharmacological bullets, far from magical,
were either too indiscriminate or too weak.</p>
<p>In 1908, soon after Ehrlich won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of
the principle of specific affinity, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany invited
him to a private audience in his palace. The Kaiser was seeking counsel:
a noted hypochondriac afflicted by various real and imagined ailments,
he wanted to know whether Ehrlich had an anticancer drug within
reach.</p>
<p>Ehrlich hedged. The cancer cell, he explained, was a fundamentally
different target from a bacterial cell. Specific affinity relied,
paradoxically, not on “affinity,” but on its opposite—on difference.
Ehrlich’s chemicals had successfully targeted bacteria because bacterial
enzymes were so radically dissimilar to human enzymes. With cancer, it
was the similarity of the cancer cell to the normal human cell that made
it nearly impossible to target.</p>
<p>Ehrlich went on in this vein, almost musing to himself. He was
circling around something profound, an idea in its infancy: to target
the abnormal cell, one would need to decipher the biology of the normal
cell. He had returned, decades after his first encounter with aniline,
to specificity again, to the bar codes of biology hidden inside every
living cell.</p>
<p>Ehrlich’s thinking was lost on the Kaiser. Having little interest in
this cheerless disquisition with no obvious end, he cut the audience
short.</p>
<p>In 1915, Ehrlich fell ill with tuberculosis, a disease that he had
likely acquired from his days in Koch’s laboratory. He went to
recuperate in Bad Homburg, a spa town famous for its healing
carbonic-salt baths. From his room, overlooking the distant plains
below, he watched bitterly as his country pitched itself into the First
World War. The dye factories that had once supplied his therapeutic
chemicals—Bayer and Hoechst among them—were converted to massive
producers of chemicals that would be turned into precursors for war
gases. One particularly toxic gas was a colorless, blistering liquid
produced by reacting the solvent thiodiglycol (a dye intermediate) with
boiling hydrochloric acid. The gas’s smell was unmistakable, described
alternatively as reminiscent of mustard, burnt garlic, or horseradishes
ground on a fire. It came to be known as mustard gas.</p>
<p>On the foggy night of July 12, 1917, two years after Ehrlich’s death,
a volley of artillery shells marked with small, yellow crosses rained
down on British troops stationed near the small Belgian town of Ypres.
The liquid in the bombs quickly vaporized, a “thick, yellowish green
cloud veiling the sky,” as a soldier recalled, then diffused through the
cool night air. The men in their barracks and trenches, asleep for the
night, awoke to a nauseatingly sharp smell that they would remember for
decades to come: the acrid whiff of horseradishes spreading through the
chalk fields. Within seconds, soldiers ran for cover, coughing and
sneezing in the mud, the blind scrambling among the dead. Mustard gas
diffused through leather and rubber, and soaked through layers of cloth.
It hung like a toxic mist over the battlefield for days until the dead
smelled of mustard. On that night alone, mustard gas killed two thousand
soldiers. In a single year, it left hundreds of thousands dead in its
wake.</p>
<p>The acute, short-term effects of nitrogen mustard—the respiratory
complications, the burnt skin, the blisters, the blindness—were so amply
monstrous that its long-term effects were overlooked. In 1919, a pair of
American pathologists, Edward and Helen Krumbhaar, analyzed the effects
of the Ypres bombing on the few men who had survived it. They found that
the survivors had an unusual condition of the bone marrow. The normal
blood-forming cells had dried up; the bone marrow, in a bizarre mimicry
of the scorched and blasted battlefield, was markedly depleted. The men
were anemic and needed transfusions of blood, often up to once a month.
They were prone to infections. Their white cell counts often hovered
persistently below normal.</p>
<p>In a world less preoccupied with other horrors, this news might have
caused a small sensation among cancer doctors. Although evidently
poisonous, this chemical had, after all, targeted the bone marrow and
wiped out only certain populations of cells—a chemical with specific
affinity. But Europe was full of horror stories in 1919, and this seemed
no more remarkable than any other. The Krumbhaars published their paper
in a second-tier medical journal and it was quickly forgotten in the
amnesia of war.</p>
<p>The wartime chemists went back to their labs to devise new chemicals
for other battles, and the inheritors of Ehrlich’s legacy went hunting
elsewhere for his specific chemicals. They were looking for a magic
bullet that would rid the body of cancer, not a toxic gas that would
leave its victims half-dead, blind, blistered, and permanently anemic.
That their bullet would eventually appear out of that very chemical
weapon seemed like a perversion of specific affinity, a ghoulish
distortion of Ehrlich’s dream.</p>
