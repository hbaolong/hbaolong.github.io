<h4 id="the-cart-and-the-horse">The Cart and the Horse</h4>
<p>I am not opposed to optimism, but I am fearful of the kind that comes
from self-delusion.</p>
<p>—Marvin Davis, in the New England Journal</p>
<p>of Medicine, talking about the “cure” for cancer</p>
<p>The iron is hot and this is the time to pound without cessation.</p>
<p>—Sidney Farber to Mary Lasker,</p>
<p>September 1965</p>
<p>One swallow is a coincidence, but two swallows make summer. By the
autumn of 1968, as the trials in Bethesda and in Memphis announced their
noteworthy successes, the landscape of cancer witnessed a seismic shift.
In the late fifties, as DeVita recalled, “it took plain old courage to
be a chemotherapist . . . and certainly the courage of the conviction
that cancer would eventually succumb to drugs. Clearly, proof was
necessary.”</p>
<p>Just a decade later, the burden of proof had begun to shift
dramatically. The cure of lymphoblastic leukemia with high-dose
chemotherapy might have been dismissed as a biological fluke, but the
success of the same strategy in Hodgkin’s disease made it seem like a
general principle. “A revolution [has been] set in motion,” DeVita
wrote. Kenneth Endicott, the NCI director, concurred: “The next step—the
complete cure—is almost sure to follow.”</p>
<p>In Boston, Farber greeted the news by celebrating the way he knew
best—by throwing a massive public party. The symbolic date for the party
was not hard to come by. In September 1968, the Jimmy Fund turned
twenty-one.* Farber recast the occasion as the symbolic twenty-first
birthday of Jimmy, a coming-of-age moment for his “child with cancer.”
The Imperial Ballroom of the Statler Hotel, outside which the Variety
Club had once positioned its baseball-shaped donation box for Jimmy in
the 1950s, was outfitted for a colossal celebration. The guest list
included Farber’s typically glitzy retinue of physicians, scientists,
philanthropists, and politicians. Mary Lasker couldn’t attend the event,
but she sent Elmer Bobst from the ACS. Zubrod flew up from the NCI.
Kenneth Endicott came from Bethesda.</p>
<p>Conspicuously missing from the list was the original Jimmy
himself—Einar Gustafson. Farber knew of Jimmy’s whereabouts (he was
alive and well, Farber told the press opaquely) but deliberately chose
to shroud the rest in anonymity. Jimmy, Farber insisted, was an icon, an
abstraction. The real Jimmy had returned to a private, cloistered life
on a farm in rural Maine where he now lived with his wife and three
children—his restored normalcy a sign of victory against cancer. He was
thirty-two years old. No one had seen or photographed him for nearly two
decades.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, as the demitasse cups were being wheeled
away, Farber rose to the stage in the full glare of the lights. Jimmy’s
Clinic, he said, now stood at “the most fortunate time in the history of
science and medicine.” Institutions and individuals across the
nation—“the Variety Club, the motion picture industry, the Boston Braves
. . . the Red Sox, the world of sports, the press, the television, the
radio”—had come together around cancer. What was being celebrated in the
ballroom that evening, Farber announced, was not an individual’s
birthday, but the birth of a once-beleaguered community that had
clustered around a disease.</p>
<p>That community now felt on the verge of a breakthrough. As DeVita
described it, “The missing piece of the therapeutic puzzle, effective
chemotherapy for systemic cancers,” had been discovered. High-dose
combination chemotherapy would cure all cancers—once the right
combinations had been found. “The chemical arsenal,” one writer noted,
“now in the hands of prescribing physicians gives them every bit as much
power . . . as the heroic surgeon wielding the knife at the turn of the
century.”</p>
<p>The prospect of a systematic solution to a cure intoxicated
oncologists. It equally intoxicated the political forces that had
converged around cancer. Potent, hungry, and expansive, the word war
captured the essence of the anticancer campaign. Wars demand combatants,
weapons, soldiers, the wounded, survivors, bystanders, collaborators,
strategists, sentinels, victories—and it was not hard to find a
metaphorical analogue to each of these for this war as well.</p>
<p>Wars also demand a clear definition of an enemy. They imbue even
formless adversaries with forms. So cancer, a shape-shifting disease of
colossal diversity, was recast as a single, monolithic entity. It was
one disease. As Isaiah Fidler, the influential Houston oncologist,
described it succinctly, cancer had to possess “one cause, one mechanism
and one cure.”</p>
<p>If clinical oncologists had multidrug cytotoxic chemotherapy to offer
as their unifying solution for cancer—“one cure”—then cancer scientists
had their own theory to advance for its unifying cause: viruses. The
grandfather of this theory was Peyton Rous, a stooping, white-haired
chicken virologist who had been roosting quietly in a laboratory at the
Rockefeller Institute in New York until he was dragged out of relative
oblivion in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1909 (note that date: Halsted had just wrapped up his study of the
mastectomy; Neely was yet to advertise his “reward” for the cure for
cancer), then a thirty-year-old scientist freshly launching his lab at
the Rockefeller Institute, Peyton Rous had been brought a tumor growing
on the back of a hen of a black-and-white species of chicken called
Plymouth Rock. A rare tumor in a chicken might have left others
unimpressed, but the indefatigable Rous secured a 00 grant to study the
chicken cancer. Soon, he had categorized the tumor as a sarcoma, a
cancer of the connective tissues, with sheet upon sheet of rhomboid,
fox-eyed cells invading the tendons and muscle.</p>
<p>Rous’s initial work on the chicken sarcoma was thought to have little
relevance to human cancers. In the 1920s, the only known causes of human
cancer were environmental carcinogens such as radium (recall Marie
Curie’s leukemia) or organic chemicals, such as paraffin and dye
by-products, that were known to cause solid tumors. In the late
eighteenth century, an English surgeon named Percivall Pott had argued
that cancer of the scrotum, endemic among chimney sweeps, was caused by
chronic exposure to chimney soot and smoke. (We will meet Pott again in
subsequent pages.)</p>
<p>These observations had led to a theory called the somatic mutation
hypothesis of cancer. The somatic theory of cancer argued that
environmental carcinogens such as soot or radium somehow permanently
altered the structure of the cell and thus caused cancer. But the
precise nature of the alteration was unknown. Clearly, soot, paraffin,
and radium possessed the capacity to alter a cell in some fundamental
way to generate a malignant cell. But how could such a diverse range of
insults all converge on the same pathological insult? Perhaps a more
systematic explanation was missing—a deeper, more fundamental theory of
carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>In 1910, unwittingly, Rous threw the somatic theory into grave doubt.
Experimenting with the spindle-cell sarcoma, Rous injected the tumor in
one chicken into another chicken and found that the cancer could be
transmitted from one bird to another. “I have propagated a spindle-cell
sarcoma of the common foul into its fourth generation,” he wrote. “The
neoplasm grows rapidly, infiltrates, metastasizes, and remains true to
type.”</p>
<p>This was curious, but nonetheless still understandable—cancer was a
disease of cellular origin, and transferring cells from one organism to
another might have been expected to transmit the cancer. But then Rous
stumbled on an even more peculiar result. Shuttling tumors from one bird
to another, he began to pass the cells through a set of filters, a
series of finer and finer cellular sieves, until the cells had been
eliminated from the mix and all that was left was the filtrate derived
from the cells. Rous expected the tumor transmission to stop, but
instead, the tumors continued propagating with a ghostly efficacy—at
times even increasing in transmissibility as the cells had progressively
vanished.</p>
<p>The agent responsible for carrying the cancer, Rous concluded, was
not a cell or an environmental carcinogen, but some tiny particle
lurking within a cell. The particle was so small that it could easily
pass through most filters and keep producing cancer in animals. The only
biological particle that had these properties was a virus. His virus was
later called Rous sarcoma virus, or RSV for short.</p>
<p>The discovery of RSV, the first cancer-causing virus, felled a deep
blow to the somatic mutation theory and set off a frantic search for
more cancer viruses. The causal agent for cancer, it seemed, had been
found. In 1935, a colleague of Rous’s named Richard Schope reported a
papillomavirus that caused wartlike tumors in cottontail rabbits. Ten
years later, in the mid-1940s, came news of a leukemia-causing virus in
mice and then in cats—but still no sign of a bona fide cancer virus in
humans.</p>
<p>In 1958, after nearly a three-decade effort, the hunt finally yielded
an important prize. An Irish surgeon, Denis Burkitt, discovered an
aggressive form of lymphoma—now called Burkitt’s lymphoma—that occurred
endemically among children in the malaria-ridden belt of sub-Saharan
Africa. The pattern of distribution suggested an infectious cause. When
two British virologists analyzed the lymphoma cells from Africa, they
discovered an infectious agent lodged inside them—not malaria parasites,
but a human cancer virus. The new virus was named Epstein-Barr virus or
EBV. (EBV is more familiar to us as the virus that causes infectious
mononucleosis, or mono.)</p>
<p>The grand total of cancer-causing viruses in humans now stood at one.
But the modesty of that number aside, the cancer virus theory was in
full spate now—in part because viruses were the new rage in all of
medicine. Viral diseases, having been considered incurable for
centuries, were now becoming potentially preventable: the polio vaccine,
introduced in the summer of 1952, had been a phenomenal success, and the
notion that cancer and infectious diseases could eventually collapse
into a single pathological entity was simply too seductive to
resist.</p>
<p>“Cancer may be infectious,” a Life magazine cover piece asserted in
1962. Rous received hundreds of letters from anxious men and women
asking about exposures to cancer-causing bacteria or viruses.
Speculation soon inched toward hysteria and fear. If cancer was
infectious, some wondered, why not quarantine patients to prevent its
spread? Why not send cancer patients to sanitation wards or isolation
facilities, where TB and smallpox victims had once been confined? One
woman who believed that she had been exposed to a coughing lung cancer
patient wrote, “Is there something I can do to kill the cancer germ? Can
the rooms be fumigated . . .? Should I give up my lease and move
out?”</p>
<p>If the “cancer germ” had infected one space most acutely, it was the
imagination of the public—and, equally, the imagination of researchers.
Farber turned into a particularly fervent believer. In the early 1960s,
goaded by his insistence, the NCI inaugurated a Special Virus Cancer
Program, a systematic hunt for human cancer viruses patterned explicitly
after the chemotherapy discovery program. The project snowballed into
public prominence, gathering enormous support. Hundreds of monkeys at
the NCI-funded lab were inoculated with human tumors with the hopes of
turning the monkeys into viral incubators for vaccine development.
Unfortunately, the monkeys failed to produce even a single cancer virus,
but nothing dimmed the optimism. Over the next decade, the cancer virus
program siphoned away more than 10 percent of the NCI contract
budget—nearly 00 million. (In contrast, the institute’s cancer nutrition
program, meant to evaluate the role of diet in cancer—a question of at
least equal import—received one-twentieth of that allocation.)</p>
<p>Peyton Rous was rehabilitated into the scientific mainstream and
levitated into permanent scientific sainthood. In 1966, having been
overlooked for a full fifty-five years, he was awarded the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medicine. On the evening of December 10 at the
ceremony in Stockholm, he rose to the podium like a resurrected messiah.
Rous acknowledged in his talk that the virus theory of cancer still
needed much more work and clarity. “Relatively few viruses have any
connection with the production of neoplasms,” Rous said. But bulldogish
and unwilling to capitulate, Rous lambasted the idea that cancer could
be caused by something inherent to the cells, such as a genetic
mutation. “A favorite explanation has been that oncogenes cause
alterations in the genes of the cells of the body, somatic mutations as
these are termed. But numerous facts, when taken together, decisively
exclude this supposition.”</p>
<p>He groused elsewhere: “What have been [the fruits] of this somatic
mutation hypothesis? . . . Most serious of all the results of the
somatic mutation hypothesis has been its effect on research workers. It
acts as a tranquilizer on those who believe it.”</p>
<p>Rous had his own tranquilizer to offer: a unifying hypothesis that
viruses caused cancer. And many in his audience, in no mood for caveats
and complexities, were desperate to swallow his medicine. The somatic
mutation theory of cancer was dead. The scientists who had studied
environmental carcinogenesis needed to think of other explanations why
radium or soot might cause cancer. (Perhaps, the virus theorists
reasoned, these insults activated endogenous viruses.)</p>
<p>Two superficial theories were thus stitched audaciously—and
prematurely—into one comprehensive whole. One offered a cause: viruses
caused cancer (although a vast majority of them were yet undiscovered).
The second offered a cure: particular combinations of cytotoxic poisons
would cure cancer (although specific combinations for the vast majority
of cancers were yet undiscovered).</p>
<p>Viral carcinogenesis clearly demanded a deeper explanation: how might
viruses—elemental microbes floating from cell to cell—cause so profound
a change in a cell’s physiology as to create a malignant cell? The
success of cytotoxic chemotherapy provoked equally fundamental
questions: why had a series of rather general poisons cured some forms
of cancer, while leaving other forms completely unscathed?</p>
<p>Obviously, a more fundamental explanation lurked beneath all of this,
an explanation that would connect cause and cure. So some researchers
urged patience, diligence, and time. “The program directed by the
National Cancer Institute has been derided as one that puts the cart
before the horse by searching for a cure before knowing the cause,”
Kenneth Endicott, the NCI director, acknowledged in 1963. “We have
certainly not found a cure for cancer. We have a dozen chemicals which
are somewhat better than those known before the program began but none
are dramatically better. They prolong the patient’s life somewhat and
make him more comfortable, but that is all.”</p>
<p>But the Laskerites had little time for such nuanced descriptions of
progress; this cart would have to drag the horse. “The iron is hot and
this is the time to pound without cessation,” Farber wrote to Lasker.
The groundwork for an all-out battle had already been laid. All that was
necessary was to put pressure on Congress to release funds. “No large
mission or goal-directed effort [against cancer], supported with
adequate funds has ever been organized,” Mary Lasker announced in an
open letter to Congress in 1969.</p>
<p>Lasker’s thoughts were echoed by Solomon Garb, a little-known
professor of pharmacology at the University of Missouri who shot to
prominence by publishing the book Cure for Cancer: A National Goal in
1968. “The theme of this book,” Garb began, “is that the time has come
for a closer look at cancer research and for a new consolidation of
effort aimed at cure or control of cancer. . . . A major hindrance to
cancer effort has been a chronic, severe shortage of funds—a situation
that is not generally recognized. It is not enough, however, to point
this out or to repeat it; it is also necessary to explain how additional
funds would be used, what projects they would pay for, why such projects
deserve support, and where the skilled scientists and technicians to do
the work would come from.”</p>
<p>Garb’s book was described as a “springboard to progress,” and the
Laskerites certainly sprang. As with Farber, a doctor’s word was the
ultimate prescription. That Garb had prescribed precisely the strategy
advocated by the Laskerites instantly transformed him in their eyes into
a messianic figure. His book became their bible.</p>
<p>Religious movements and cults are often founded on a tetrad of
elements: a prophet, a prophecy, a book, and a revelation. By the summer
of 1969, the cancer crusade had acquired three of these four essential
elements. Its prophet was Mary Lasker, the woman who had guided it out
of the dark wilderness of the 1950s into national prominence just two
decades later. Its prophecy was the cure for childhood leukemia,
inaugurated by Farber’s experiments in Boston and ending with Pinkel’s
astonishing successes in Memphis. Its book was Garb’s Cure for Cancer.
The final missing element was a revelation—a sign that would auger the
future and capture the imagination of the public. In the spirit of all
great revelations, this one would also appear unexpectedly and
mystically out of the blue. It would apparition, quite literally, from
the heavens.</p>
<p>At 4:17 p.m. EDT on July 20, 1969, a fifteen-ton spacecraft moved
silently through the cold, thin atmosphere above the moon and landed on
a rocky basalt crater on the lunar surface. A vast barren landscape—a
“magnificent desolation”—stretched out around the spacecraft. “It
suddenly struck me,” one of the two astronauts would recall, “that that
tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the earth. I put up my thumb and shut one
eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet.”</p>
<p>On that pea-size blue planet glimmering on the horizon, this was a
moment of reckoning. “It was a stunning scientific and intellectual
accomplishment,” Time reported in July 1969, “for a creature who, in the
space of a few million years—an instant in evolutionary
chronology—emerged from primeval forests to hurl himself at the stars. .
. . It was, in any event, a shining reaffirmation of the optimistic
premise that whatever man imagines he can bring to pass.”</p>
<p>The cancer crusaders could not have asked for a more exuberant
vindication for their own project. Here was another “programmatic”
effort—planned, targeted, goal-oriented, and intensely focused—that had
delivered its results in record time. When Max Faget, the famously
taciturn engineer of the Apollo program, was later asked to comment on
the principal scientific challenge of the moon landing, he could only
come up with a single word: “Propulsion.” The impression was that the
moon walk had turned out to be a technological cakewalk—no more
complicated than building a more powerful jet plane, magnifying it
several dozenfold, and pointing it vertically at the moon.</p>
<p>The Laskerites, transfixed in front of their flickering television
sets in Boston, Washington, and New York on the evening of the moon
landing, were primed to pick up on all these analogies. Like Faget, they
believed that the missing element in the cancer crusade was some sort of
propulsion, a simple, internal vertical thrust that would transform the
scale and scope of their efforts and catapult them toward the cure.</p>
<p>In fact, the missing propulsion, they believed, had finally been
found. The success against childhood leukemia—and more recently,
Hodgkin’s disease—stood out as proofs of principle, the first hesitant
explorations of a vast unexplored space. Cancer, like the moon, was also
a landscape of magnificent desolation—but a landscape on the verge of
discovery. In her letters, Mary Lasker began to refer to a programmatic
War on Cancer as the conquest of “inner space” (as opposed to “outer
space”), instantly unifying the two projects.</p>
<p>The moon landing thus marked a turning point in the life cycle of the
cancer crusade. In the past, the Laskerites had concentrated much of
their efforts on political lobbying in Washington. When advertisements
or posters had been pitched directly to the public, they had been mainly
educational. The Laskerites had preferred to maneuver backstage,
preferring political advocacy to public advocacy.</p>
<p>But by 1969, politics had changed. Lister Hill, the Alabama senator
and one of Mary Lasker’s strongest supporters, was retiring after
several decades in the Senate. Senator Edward Kennedy, Farber’s ally
from Boston, was so deeply embroiled in the Chappaquiddick scandal (in
July 1969, a car carrying Kennedy and a campaign worker veered off a
Martha’s Vineyard bridge and sank underwater, drowning his passenger;
Kennedy was tried for manslaughter, although eventually acquitted) that
he had virtually disappeared into legislative oblivion. The Laskerites
were now doubly orphaned. “We’re in the worst,” Lasker recalled. “We’re
back to a phase that we were in the early fifties when . . . we had no
friend in the Senate. We went on constantly—but no effective
sympathy.”</p>
<p>With their voices now muted in Washington, with little sympathy in
the House and no friend in the Senate, the Laskerites were forced to
revamp the strategy for their crusade—from backstage political
maneuvering to front-stage public mobilization. In retrospect, that turn
in their trajectory was well-timed. The success of Apollo 11 may have
dramatically affected the Laskerites’ own view of their project, but,
more important perhaps, it created an equally seismic shift in the
public perception of science. That cancer could be conquered, just as
the moon had been conquered, was scarcely a matter of doubt. The
Laskerites coined a phrase to describe this analogy. They called it a
“moon shot” for cancer.</p>
