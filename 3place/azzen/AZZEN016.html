<h4 id="these-new-friends-of-chemotherapy">“These new friends of
chemotherapy”</h4>
<p>The death of a man is like the fall of a mighty nation</p>
<p>That had valiant armies, captains, and prophets,</p>
<p>And wealthy ports and ships all over the seas</p>
<p>But now it will not relieve any besieged city</p>
<p>It will not enter into an alliance</p>
<p>—Czeslaw Milosz, “The Fall”</p>
<p>I had recently begun to notice that events outside science, such as
Mary Lasker’s cocktail parties or Sidney Farber’s Jimmy Fund, had
something to do with the setting of science policy.</p>
<p>—Robert Morison</p>
<p>In 1951, as Farber and Lasker were communicating with “telepathic”
intensity about a campaign against cancer, a seminal event drastically
altered the tone and urgency of their efforts. Albert Lasker was
diagnosed with colon cancer. Surgeons in New York heroically tried to
remove the tumor, but the lymph nodes around the intestines were widely
involved, and there was little that could be done surgically. By
February 1952, Albert was confined to the hospital, numb with the shock
of diagnosis and awaiting death.</p>
<p>The sardonic twist of this event could not have escaped the
Laskerites. In their advertisements in the late 1940s to raise awareness
of cancer, the Laskerites had often pointed out that one in four
Americans would succumb to cancer. Albert was now the “one in
four”—struck by the very disease that he had once sought to conquer. “It
seems a little unfair,” one of his close friends from Chicago wrote
(with vast understatement), “for someone who has done as much as you
have to forward the work in this field to have to suffer
personally.”</p>
<p>In her voluminous collection of papers—in nearly eight hundred boxes
filled with memoirs, letters, notes, and interviews—Mary Lasker left few
signs of her response to this terrifying tragedy. Although obsessed with
illness, she was peculiarly silent about its corporality, about the
vulgarity of dying. There are occasional glimpses of interiority and
grief: her visits to the Harkness Pavilion in New York to watch Albert
deteriorate into a coma, or letters to various oncologists—including
Farber—inquiring about yet another last-ditch drug. In the months before
Albert’s death, these letters acquired a manic, insistent tone. He had
seeded metastasis into the liver, and she searched discreetly, but
insistently, for any possible therapy, however far-fetched, that might
stay his illness. But for the vast part, there was silence—impenetrable,
dense, and impossibly lonely. Mary Lasker chose to descend into
melancholy alone.</p>
<p>Albert Lasker died at eight o’clock on the morning of May 30, 1952. A
small private funeral was held in the Lasker residence in New York. In
his obituary, the Times noted, “He was more than a philanthropist, for
he gave not only of his substance, but of his experience, ability and
strength.”</p>
<p>Mary Lasker gradually forged her way back to public life after her
husband’s death. She returned to her routine of fund-raisers, balls, and
benefits. Her social calendar filled up: dances for various medical
foundations, a farewell party for Harry Truman, a fund-raiser for
arthritis. She seemed self-composed, fiery, and energetic—blazing
meteorically into the rarefied atmosphere of New York.</p>
<p>But the person who charged her way back into New York’s society in
1953 was fundamentally different from the woman who had left it a year
before. Something had broken and annealed within her. In the shadow of
Albert’s death, Mary Lasker’s cancer campaign took on a more urgent and
insistent tone. She no longer sought a strategy to publicize a crusade
against cancer; she sought a strategy to run it. “We are at war with an
insidious, relentless foe,” as her friend Senator Lister Hill would
later put it—and a war of this magnitude demanded a relentless, total,
unflinching commitment. Expediency must not merely inspire science; it
must invade science. To fight cancer, the Laskerites wanted a radically
restructured cancer agency, an NCI rebuilt from the ground up, stripped
of its bureaucratic excesses, intensely funded, closely supervised—a
goal-driven institute that would decisively move toward finding a cancer
cure. The national effort against cancer, Mary Lasker believed, had
become ad hoc, diffuse, and abstract. To rejuvenate it, it needed the
disembodied legacy of Albert Lasker: a targeted, directed strategy
borrowed from the world of business and advertising.</p>
<p>Farber’s life also collided with cancer—a collision that he had
perhaps presaged for a decade. In the late 1940s, he had developed a
mysterious and chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines—likely
ulcerative colitis, a debilitating precancerous illness that predisposes
the colon and bile duct to cancer. In the mid-1950s (we do not know the
precise date), Farber underwent surgery to remove his inflamed colon at
Mount Auburn Hospital in Boston, likely choosing the small and private
Cambridge hospital across the Charles River to keep his diagnosis and
surgery hidden from his colleagues and friends on the Longwood campus.
It is also likely that more than just “precancer” was discovered upon
surgery—for in later years, Mary Lasker would refer to Farber as a
“cancer survivor,” without ever divulging the nature of his cancer.
Proud, guarded, and secretive—reluctant to conflate his battle against
cancer with the battle—Farber also pointedly refused to discuss his
personal case publicly. (Thomas Farber, his son, would also not discuss
it. “I will neither confirm nor deny it,” he said, although he admitted
that his father lived “in the shadow of illness in his last years”—an
ambiguity that I choose to respect.) The only remnant of the colon
surgery was a colostomy bag; Farber hid it expertly under his white
cuffed shirt and his four-button suit during his hospital rounds.</p>
<p>Although cloaked in secrecy and discretion, Farber’s personal
confrontation with cancer also fundamentally altered the tone and
urgency of his campaign. As with Lasker, cancer was no longer an
abstraction for him; he had sensed its shadow flitting darkly over
himself. “[It is not] necessary,” he wrote, “in order to make great
progress in the cure of cancer, for us to have the full solution of all
the problems of basic research . . . the history of Medicine is replete
with examples of cures obtained years, decades, and even centuries
before the mechanism of action was understood for these cures.”</p>
<p>“Patients with cancer who are going to die this year cannot wait,”
Farber insisted. Neither could he or Mary Lasker.</p>
<p>Mary Lasker knew that the stakes of this effort were enormous: the
Laskerites’ proposed strategy for cancer ran directly against the grain
of the dominant model for biomedical research in the 1950s. The chief
architect of the prevailing model was a tall, gaunt, MIT-trained
engineer named Vannevar Bush, who had served as the director of the
Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Created in 1941,
the OSRD had played a crucial role during the war years, in large part
by channeling American scientific ingenuity toward the invention of
novel military technologies for the war. To achieve this, the agency had
recruited scientists performing basic research into projects that
emphasized “programmatic research.” Basic research—diffuse and
open-ended inquiry on fundamental questions—was a luxury of peacetime.
The war demanded something more urgent and goal-directed. New weapons
needed to be manufactured, and new technologies invented to aid soldiers
in the battlefield. This was a battle progressively suffused with
military technology—a “wizard’s war,” as newspapers called it—and a
cadre of scientific wizards was needed to help America win it.</p>
<p>The “wizards” had wrought astonishing technological magic. Physicists
had created sonar, radar, radio-sensing bombs, and amphibious tanks.
Chemists had produced intensely efficient and lethal chemical weapons,
including the infamous war gases. Biologists had studied the effects of
high-altitude survival and seawater ingestion. Even mathematicians, the
archbishops of the arcane, had been packed off to crack secret codes for
the military.</p>
<p>The undisputed crown jewel of this targeted effort, of course, was
the atomic bomb, the product of the OSRD-led Manhattan Project. On
August 7, 1945, the morning after the Hiroshima bombing, the New York
Times gushed about the extraordinary success of the project: “University
professors who are opposed to organizing, planning and directing
research after the manner of industrial laboratories . . . have
something to think about now. A most important piece of research was
conducted on behalf of the Army in precisely the means adopted in
industrial laboratories. End result: an invention was given to the world
in three years, which it would have taken perhaps half-a-century to
develop if we had to rely on prima-donna research scientists who work
alone. . . . A problem was stated, it was solved by teamwork, by
planning, by competent direction, and not by the mere desire to satisfy
curiosity.”</p>
<p>The congratulatory tone of that editorial captured a general
sentiment about science that had swept through the nation. The Manhattan
Project had overturned the prevailing model of scientific discovery. The
bomb had been designed, as the Times scoffingly put it, not by tweedy
“prima-donna” university professors wandering about in search of obscure
truths (driven by the “mere desire to satisfy curiosity”), but by a
focused SWAT team of researchers sent off to accomplish a concrete
mission. A new model of scientific governance emerged from the
project—research driven by specific mandates, timelines, and goals
(“frontal attack” science, to use one scientist’s description)—which had
produced the remarkable technological boom during the war.</p>
<p>But Vannevar Bush was not convinced. In a deeply influential report
to President Truman entitled Science the Endless Frontier, first
published in 1945, Bush had laid out a view of postwar research that had
turned his own model of wartime research on its head: “Basic research,”
Bush wrote, “is performed without thought of practical ends. It results
in general knowledge and an understanding of nature and its laws. This
general knowledge provides the means of answering a large number of
important practical problems, though it may not give a complete specific
answer to any one of them. . . .</p>
<p>“Basic research leads to new knowledge. It provides scientific
capital. It creates the fund from which the practical applications of
knowledge must be drawn. . . . Basic research is the pacemaker of
technological progress. In the nineteenth century, Yankee mechanical
ingenuity, building largely upon the basic discoveries of European
scientists, could greatly advance the technical arts. Now the situation
is different. A nation which depends upon others for its new basic
scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in
its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical
skill.”</p>
<p>Directed, targeted research—“programmatic” science—the cause célèbre
during the war years, Bush argued, was not a sustainable model for the
future of American science. As Bush perceived it, even the widely lauded
Manhattan Project epitomized the virtues of basic inquiry. True, the
bomb was the product of Yankee “mechanical ingenuity.” But that
mechanical ingenuity stood on the shoulders of scientific discoveries
about the fundamental nature of the atom and the energy locked inside
it—research performed, notably, with no driving mandate to produce
anything resembling the atomic bomb. While the bomb might have come to
life physically in Los Alamos, intellectually speaking it was the
product of prewar physics and chemistry rooted deeply in Europe. The
iconic homegrown product of wartime American science was, at least
philosophically speaking, an import.</p>
<p>A lesson Bush had learned from all of this was that goal-directed
strategies, so useful in wartime, would be of limited use during periods
of peace. “Frontal attacks” were useful on the war front, but postwar
science could not be produced by fiat. So Bush had pushed for a
radically inverted model of scientific development, in which researchers
were allowed full autonomy over their explorations and open-ended
inquiry was prioritized.</p>
<p>The plan had a deep and lasting influence in Washington. The National
Science Foundation (NSF), founded in 1950, was explicitly created to
encourage scientific autonomy, turning in time, as one historian put it,
into a veritable “embodiment [of Bush’s] grand design for reconciling
government money and scientific independence.” A new culture of
research—“long-term, basic scientific research rather than sharply
focused quests for treatment and disease prevention”—rapidly
proliferated at the NSF and subsequently at the NIH.</p>
<p>For the Laskerites, this augured a profound conflict. A War on
Cancer, they felt, demanded precisely the sort of focus and undiluted
commitment that had been achieved so effectively at Los Alamos. World
War II had clearly surcharged medical research with new problems and new
solutions; it had prompted the development of novel resuscitation
techniques, research on blood and frozen plasma, on the role of adrenal
steroids in shock and on cerebral and cardiac blood flow. Never in the
history of medicine, as A. N. Richards, the chairman of the Committee on
Medical Research, put it, had there been “so great a coordination of
medical scientific labor.”</p>
<p>This sense of common purpose and coordination galvanized the
Laskerites: they wanted a Manhattan Project for cancer. Increasingly,
they felt that it was no longer necessary to wait for fundamental
questions about cancer to be solved before launching an all-out attack
on the problem. Farber had, after all, forged his way through the early
leukemia trials with scarcely any foreknowledge of how aminopterin
worked even in normal cells, let alone cancer cells. Oliver Heaviside,
an English mathematician from the 1920s, once wrote jokingly about a
scientist musing at a dinner table, “Should I refuse my dinner because I
don’t understand the digestive system?” To Heaviside’s question, Farber
might have added his own: should I refuse to attack cancer because I
have not solved its basic cellular mechanisms?</p>
<p>Other scientists echoed this frustration. The outspoken Philadelphia
pathologist Stanley Reimann wrote, “Workers in cancer must make every
effort to organize their work with goals in view not just because they
are ‘interesting’ but because they will help in the solution of the
cancer problem.” Bush’s cult of open-ended, curiosity-driven
inquiry—“interesting” science—had ossified into dogma. To battle cancer,
that dogma needed to be overturned.</p>
<p>The first, and most seminal, step in this direction was the creation
of a focused drug-discovery unit for anticancer drugs. In 1954, after a
furious bout of political lobbying by Laskerites, the Senate authorized
the NCI to build a program to find chemotherapeutic drugs in a more
directed, targeted manner. By 1955, this effort, called the Cancer
Chemotherapy National Service Center (CCNSC), was in full swing. Between
1954 and 1964, this unit would test 82,700 synthetic chemicals, 115,000
fermentation products, and 17,200 plant derivatives and treat nearly 1
million mice every year with various chemicals to find an ideal
drug.</p>
<p>Farber was ecstatic, but impatient. “The enthusiasm . . . of these
new friends of chemotherapy is refreshing and seems to be on a genuine
foundation,” he wrote to Lasker in 1955. “It nevertheless seems
frightfully slow. It sometimes becomes monotonous to see more and more
men brought into the program go through the joys of discovering
America.”</p>
<p>Farber had, meanwhile, stepped up his own drug-discovery efforts in
Boston. In the 1940s, the soil microbiologist Selman Waksman had
systematically scoured the world of soil bacteria and purified a diverse
series of antibiotics. (Like the Penicillium mold, which produces
penicillin, bacteria also produce antibiotics to wage chemical warfare
on other microbes.) One such antibiotic came from a rod-shaped microbe
called Actinomyces. Waksman called it actinomycin D. An enormous
molecule shaped like an ancient Greek statue, with a small, headless
torso and two extended wings, actinomycin D was later found to work by
binding and damaging DNA. It potently killed bacterial cells—but
unfortunately it also killed human cells, limiting its use as an
antibacterial agent.</p>
<p>But a cellular poison could always excite an oncologist. In the
summer of 1954, Farber persuaded Waksman to send him a number of
antibiotics, including actinomycin D, to repurpose them as antitumor
agents by testing the drugs on a series of mouse tumors. Actinomycin D,
Farber found, was remarkably effective in mice. Just a few doses melted
away many mouse cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, and breast
cancers. “One hesitates to call them ‘cures,’” Farber wrote expectantly,
“but it is hard to classify them otherwise.”</p>
<p>Energized by the animal “cures,” in 1955 he launched a series of
trials to evaluate the efficacy of the drug in humans. Actinomycin D had
no effect on leukemias in children. Undeterred, Farber unleashed the
drug on 275 children with a diverse range of cancers: lymphomas, kidney
sarcomas, muscle sarcomas, and neuroblastic tumors. The trial was a
pharmacist’s nightmare. Actinomycin D was so toxic that it had to be
heavily diluted in saline; if even minute amounts leaked out of the
veins, then the skin around the leak would necrose and turn black. In
children with small veins, the drug was often given through an
intravenous line inserted into the scalp.</p>
<p>The one form of cancer that responded in these early trials was
Wilms’ tumor, a rare variant of kidney cancer. Often detected in very
young children, Wilms’ tumor was typically treated by surgical removal
of the affected kidney. Surgical removal was followed by X-ray radiation
to the affected kidney bed. But not all Wilms’ cases could be treated
using local therapy. In a fraction of cases, by the time the tumor was
detected, it had already metastasized, usually to the lungs.
Recalcitrant to treatment there, Wilms’ tumors were usually bombarded
with X-rays and assorted drugs but with little hopes of a sustained
response.</p>
<p>Farber found that actinomycin D, administered intravenously, potently
inhibited the growth of these lung metastases, often producing
remissions that lasted months. Intrigued, he pressed further. If X-rays
and actinomycin D could both attack Wilms’ metastases independently,
what if the agents could be combined? In 1958, he set a young
radiologist couple named Giulio D’Angio and Audrey Evans and an
oncologist named Donald Pinkel to work on the project. Within months,
the team had confirmed that X-rays and actinomycin D were remarkably
synergistic, each multiplying the toxic effect of the other. Children
with metastatic cancer treated with the combined regimen often responded
briskly. “In about three weeks lungs previously riddled with Wilms’
tumor metastasis cleared completely,” D’Angio recalled. “Imagine the
excitement of those days when one could say for the first time with
justifiable confidence, ‘We can fix that.’”</p>
<p>The enthusiasm generated by these findings was infectious. Although
combination X-ray and chemotherapy did not always produce long-term
cures, Wilms’ tumor was the first metastatic solid tumor to respond to
chemotherapy. Farber had achieved his long-sought leap from the world of
liquid cancers to solid tumors.</p>
<p>By the late 1950s, Farber was bristling with a fiery brand of
optimism. Yet visitors to the Jimmy Fund clinic in the mid-1950s might
have witnessed a more nuanced and complex reality. For Sonja Goldstein,
whose two-year-old son, David, was treated with chemotherapy for Wilms’
tumor in 1956, the clinic seemed perpetually suspended between two
poles—both “wonderful and tragic . . . unspeakably depressing and
indescribably hopeful.” On entering the cancer ward, Goldstein would
write later, “I sense an undercurrent of excitement, a feeling
(persistent despite repeated frustrations) of being on the verge of
discovery, which makes me almost hopeful.</p>
<p>“We enter a large hall decorated with a cardboard train along one
wall. Half way down the ward is an authentic-looking stop sign, which
can flash green, red, and amber lights. The train’s engine can be
climbed into and the bell pulled. At the other end of the ward is a
life-size gasoline pump, registering amount sold and price. . . . My
first impression is one of overweening activity, almost snake pit-like
in its intensity.”</p>
<p>It was a snake-pit—only of cancer, a seething, immersed box coiled
with illness, hope, and desperation. A girl named Jenny, about four
years old, played with a new set of crayons in the corner. Her mother,
an attractive, easily excitable woman, kept Jenny in constant sight,
holding her child with the clawlike intensity of her gaze as Jenny
stooped to pick up the colors. No activity was innocent here; anything
might be a sign, a symptom, a portent. Jenny, Goldstein realized, “has
leukemia and is currently in the hospital because she developed
jaundice. Her eyeballs are still yellow”—presaging fulminant liver
failure. She, like many of the ward’s inhabitants, was relatively
oblivious to the meaning of her illness. Jenny’s only concern was an
aluminum teakettle to which she was deeply attached.</p>
<p>“Sitting in a go-cart in the hall is a little girl, who, I think at
first, has been given a black eye. . . . Lucy, a 2-year old, suffers
from a form of cancer that spreads to the area behind the eye and causes
hemorrhaging there. She is not a very attractive child, and wails almost
incessantly that first day. So does Debbie, an angelic-looking 4-year
old whose face is white and frowning with suffering. She has the same
type of tumor as Lucy—a neuroblastoma. Alone in a room lies Teddy. It
takes many days before I venture inside it, for, skeleton-thin and
blinded, Teddy has a monstrosity for a face. His tumor, starting behind
the ear, has engulfed one side of his head and obliterated his normal
features. He is fed through a tube in the nostril, and is fully
conscious.”</p>
<p>Throughout the ward were little inventions and improvisations, often
devised by Farber himself. Since the children were usually too exhausted
to walk, tiny wooden go-carts were scattered about the room so that the
patients could move around with relative freedom. IV poles for
chemotherapy were strung up on the carts to allow chemo to be given at
all times during the day. “To me,” Goldstein wrote, “one of the most
pathetic sights of all that I have seen is the little go-cart, with the
little child, leg or arm tightly bandaged to hold needle in vein, and a
tall IV pole with its burette. The combined effect is that of a boat
with mast but no sail, helplessly drifting alone in a rough, uncharted
sea.”</p>
<p>Every evening, Farber came to the wards, forcefully driving his own
sail-less boat through this rough and uncharted sea. He paused at each
bed, taking notes and discussing the case, often barking out
characteristically brusque instructions. A retinue followed him: medical
residents, nurses, social workers, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and
pharmacists. Cancer, he insisted, was a total disease—an illness that
gripped patients not just physically, but psychically, socially, and
emotionally. Only a multipronged, multidisciplinary attack would stand
any chance of battling this disease. He called the concept “total
care.”</p>
<p>But despite all efforts at providing “total care,” death stalked the
wards relentlessly. In the winter of 1956, a few weeks after David’s
visit, a volley of deaths hit Farber’s clinic. Betty, a child with
leukemia, was the first to die. Then it was Jenny, the four-year-old
with the aluminum teakettle. Teddy, with retinoblastoma, was next. A
week later, Axel, another child with leukemia, bled to death, with
hemorrhages in his mouth. Goldstein observed, “Death assumes shape,
form, and routine. Parents emerge from their child’s room, as they have
perhaps done periodically for days for short rests. A nurse takes them
to the doctor’s small office; the doctor comes in and shuts the door
behind him. Later, a nurse brings coffee. Still later, she hands the
parents a large brown paper bag, containing odds and ends of belongings.
A few minutes later, back at our promenade, we note another empty bed.
Finish.”</p>
<p>In the winter of 1956, after a prolonged and bruising battle, Sonja’s
son, three-year-old David Goldstein, died of metastatic Wilms’ tumor at
the Jimmy Fund clinic, having spent the last few hours of his life
delirious and whimpering under an oxygen mask. Sonja Goldstein left the
hospital carrying her own brown paper bag containing the remains of her
child.</p>
<p>But Farber was unfazed. The arsenal of cancer chemotherapy, having
been empty for centuries, had filled up with new drugs. The
possibilities thrown open by these discoveries were enormous:
permutations and combinations of medicines, variations in doses and
schedules, trials containing two-, three-, and four-drug regimens. There
was, at least in principle, the capacity to re-treat cancer with one
drug if another had failed, or to try one combination followed by
another. This, Farber kept telling himself with hypnotic conviction, was
not the “finish.” This was just the beginning of an all-out attack.</p>
<p>In her hospital bed on the fourteenth floor, Carla Reed was still in
“isolation”—trapped in a cool, sterile room where even the molecules of
air arrived filtered through dozens of sieves. The smell of antiseptic
soap pervaded her clothes. A television occasionally flickered on and
off. Food came on a tray labeled with brave, optimistic names—Chunky
Potato Salad or Chicken Kiev—but everything tasted as if it had been
boiled and seared almost to obliteration. (It had been; the food had to
be sterilized before it could enter the room.) Carla’s husband, a
computer engineer, came in every afternoon to sit by her bed. Ginny, her
mother, spent the days rocking mechanically in a chair, exactly as I had
found her the first morning. When Carla’s children stopped by, in masks
and gloves, she wept quietly, turning her face toward the window.</p>
<p>For Carla, the physical isolation of those days became a barely
concealed metaphor for a much deeper, fiercer loneliness, a
psychological quarantine even more achingly painful than her actual
confinement. “In those first two weeks, I withdrew into a different
person,” she said. “What went into the room and what came out were two
different people.</p>
<p>“I thought over and over again about my chances of surviving through
all this. Thirty percent. I would repeat that number to myself at night.
Not even a third. I would stay up at night looking up at the ceiling and
think: What is thirty percent? What happens thirty percent of the time?
I am thirty years old—about thirty percent of ninety. If someone gave me
thirty percent odds in a game, would I take the odds?”</p>
<p>The morning after Carla had arrived at the hospital, I walked into
her room with sheaves of paper. They were consent forms for chemotherapy
that would allow us to instantly start pumping poisons into her body to
kill cancer cells.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy would come in three phases. The first phase would last
about a month. The drugs—given in rapid-fire succession—would hopefully
send the leukemia into a sustained remission. They would certainly kill
her normal white blood cells as well. Her white cell count would drop in
free fall, all the way to zero. For a few critical days, she would
inhabit one of the most vulnerable states that modern medicine can
produce: a body with no immune system, defenseless against the
environment around it.</p>
<p>If the leukemia did go into remission, then we would “consolidate”
and intensify that remission over several months. That would mean more
chemotherapy, but at lower doses, given over longer intervals. She would
be able to leave the hospital and return home, coming back every week
for more chemotherapy. Consolidation and intensification would last for
eight additional weeks, perhaps longer.</p>
<p>The worst part, perhaps, I kept for last. Acute lymphoblastic
leukemia has an ugly propensity for hiding in the brain. The intravenous
chemotherapy that we would give Carla, no matter how potent, simply
couldn’t break into the cisterns and ventricles that bathed her brain.
The blood-brain barrier essentially made the brain into a “sanctuary”
(an unfortunate word, implying that your own body could be abetting the
cancer) for the leukemia cells. To send drugs directly into that
sanctuary, the medicines would need to be injected directly into Carla’s
spinal fluid, through a series of spinal taps. Whole-brain radiation
treatment—highly penetrant X-rays dosed directly through her skull—would
also be used prophylactically against leukemia growth in her brain. And
there would be even more chemotherapy to follow, spanning over two
years, to “maintain” the remission if we achieved it.</p>
<p>Induction. Intensification. Maintenance. Cure. An arrow in pencil
connecting the four points on a blank piece of paper. Carla nodded.</p>
<p>When I went through the avalanche of chemotherapy drugs that would be
used over the next two years to treat her, she repeated the names softly
after me under her breath, like a child discovering a new tongue
twister: “Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, prednisone, asparaginase,
Adriamycin, thioguanine, vincristine, 6-mercaptopurine,
methotrexate.”</p>
