<h4 id="an-army-on-the-march">An Army on the March</h4>
<p>Now we are an army on the march.</p>
<p>—Sidney Farber in 1963</p>
<p>The next step—the complete cure—is almost sure to follow.</p>
<p>—Kenneth Endicott,</p>
<p>NCI director, 1963</p>
<p>The role of aggressive multiple drug therapy in the quest for
long-term survival [in cancer] is far from clear.</p>
<p>—R. Stein, a scientist in 1969</p>
<p>One afternoon in the late summer of 1963, George Canellos, then a
senior fellow at the NCI, walked into the Clinical Center to find Tom
Frei scribbling furiously on one of the institute’s blackboards. Frei,
in his long white coat, was making lists of chemicals and drawing
arrows. On one side of the board was a list of cytotoxic drugs—Cytoxan,
vincristine, procarbazine, methotrexate. On the other side was a list of
new cancers that Zubrod and Frei wanted to target: breast, ovarian, lung
cancers, lymphomas. Connecting the two halves of the blackboard were
chalky lines matching combinations of cytotoxic drugs to cancers. For a
moment, it almost looked as if Frei had been deriving mathematical
equations: A+B kills C; E+F eliminates G.</p>
<p>The drugs on Frei’s list came largely from three sources. Some, such
as aminopterin or methotrexate, were the products of inspired guesswork
by scientists (Farber had discovered aminopterin by guessing that an
antifolate might block the growth of leukemia cells). Others, such as
nitrogen mustard or actinomycin D, came from serendipitous sources, such
as mustard gas or soil bacteria, found accidentally to kill cancer
cells. Yet others, such as 6-MP, came from drug-screening efforts in
which thousands of molecules were tested to find the handful that
possessed cancer-killing activity.</p>
<p>The notable common feature that linked all these drugs was that they
were all rather indiscriminate inhibitors of cellular growth. Nitrogen
mustard, for instance, damages DNA and kills nearly all dividing cells;
it kills cancer cells somewhat preferentially because cancer cells
divide most actively. To design an ideal anticancer drug, one would need
to identify a specific molecular target in a cancer cell and create a
chemical to attack that target. But the fundamental biology of cancer
was so poorly understood that defining such molecular targets was
virtually inconceivable in the 1960s. Yet, even lacking such targets,
Frei and Freireich had cured leukemia in some children. Even generic
cellular poisons, dosed with adequate brio, could thus eventually
obliterate cancer.</p>
<p>The bravado of that logic was certainly hypnotic. Vincent DeVita,
another fellow at the institute during that time, wrote, “A new breed of
cancer investigators in the 1960s had been addressing the generic
question of whether or not cytotoxic chemotherapy was ever capable of
curing patients with any type of advanced malignancies.” For Frei and
Zubrod, the only way to answer that “generic question” was to direct the
growing armamentarium of combination chemotherapy against another
cancer—a solid tumor this time—which would retrace their steps with
leukemia. If yet another kind of cancer responded to this strategy, then
there could be little doubt that oncology had stumbled upon a generic
solution to the generic problem. A cure would then be within reach for
all cancers.</p>
<p>But which cancer would be used to test the principle? Like Kaplan,
Zubrod, DeVita, and Canellos also focused on Hodgkin’s disease—a cancer
that lived on the ill-defined cusp between solid and liquid, a
stepping-stone between leukemia and, say, lung cancer or breast cancer.
At Stanford, Kaplan had already demonstrated that Hodgkin’s lymphoma
could be staged with exquisite precision and that local disease could be
cured with high-dose extended field radiation. Kaplan had solved half
the equation: he had used local therapy with radiation to cure localized
forms of Hodgkin’s disease. If metastatic Hodgkin’s disease could be
cured by systemic and aggressive combination chemotherapy, then Zubrod’s
“generic solution” would begin to sound plausible. The equation would be
fully solved.</p>
<p>Outspoken, pugnacious, and bold, a child of the rough-and-tumble
Yonkers area of New York who had bulldozed his way through college and
medical school, Vincent DeVita had come to the NCI in 1963 and fallen
into the intoxicating orbit of Zubrod, Frei, and Freireich. The
unorthodoxy of their approach—the “maniacs doing cancer research,” as he
called it—had instantly fascinated him. These were the daredevils of
medical research, acrobats devising new drugs that nearly killed
patients; these men played chicken with death. “Somebody had to show the
skeptics that you could actually cure cancer with the right drugs,” he
believed. In the early months of 1964, he set out to prove the skeptics
wrong.</p>
<p>The first test of intensive combination chemotherapy for
advanced-stage Hodgkin’s disease, led by DeVita, combined four
drugs—methotrexate, vincristine (also called Oncovin), nitrogen mustard,
and prednisone, a highly toxic cocktail called MOMP. Only fourteen
patients were treated. All suffered the predictable consequences of
combination chemotherapy; all were hospitalized and confined in
isolation chambers to prevent infections during the life-threatening
drop in blood counts. As expected, the regimen was sharply criticized at
the NCI; this, again, was a quantum leap into a deadly world of mixed
poisons. But Frei intervened, silencing the critics and allowing the
program to continue.</p>
<p>In 1964, DeVita modified the regimen further. Methotrexate was
substituted with a more powerful agent, procarbazine, and the duration
of treatment was lengthened from two and a half months to six months.
With a team of young, like-minded fellows at the NCI, DeVita began to
enroll patients with advanced Hodgkin’s disease in a trial of this new
cocktail, called MOPP. Like lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease is
a rare illness, but the researchers did not need to look hard to find
patients. Advanced Hodgkin’s disease, often accompanied by the spectral
B symptoms, was uniformly fatal. Young men and women (the disease
typically strikes men and women in their twenties and thirties) were
often referred to the NCI as hopeless cases—and therefore ideal
experimental subjects. In just three years, DeVita and Canellos thus
accumulated cases at a furious clip, forty-three patients in all. Nine
had been blasted with increasing fields of radiation, à la Kaplan, and
still progressed inexorably to disseminated, widely metastatic disease.
Others had been treated with an ad hoc mix of single agents. None had
shown any durable response to prior drugs.</p>
<p>So, like the younger band of leukemics that had gone before them, a
fresh new cohort appeared at the institute every two weeks, occupying
the plastic chairs of the Clinical Center, lining up for the
government-issued cookies and awaiting the terrifying onslaught of the
experimental drugs. The youngest was twelve, not even a teenager yet,
with lymphoma cells packed in her lungs and liver. A thirteen-year-old
boy had Hodgkin’s in his pleural cavity; malignant fluid had compressed
itself into the lining between his chest wall and lung and made it hard
to breathe. The oldest was a sixty-nine-year-old woman with Hodgkin’s
disease choking off the entrance to her intestine.</p>
<p>If the terror of VAMP was death by infection—children slumped on
ventilators with no white blood cells to speak of and bacteria streaming
in their blood—then the terror of MOPP was more visceral: death by
nausea. The nausea that accompanied the therapy was devastating. It
appeared suddenly, then abated just as suddenly, almost capable of
snapping the mind shut with its intensity. Many of the patients on the
protocol were flown in from nearby cities every fortnight. The trip back
home, with the drugs lurching in the blood and the plane lurching in the
air, was, for many, a nightmare even worse than their disease.</p>
<p>The nausea was merely a harbinger. As DeVita charged ahead with
combination chemotherapy, more complex and novel devastations were
revealed. Chemotherapy caused permanent sterility in men and some women.
The annihilation of the immune system by the cytotoxic drugs allowed
peculiar infections to sprout up: the first adult case of a rare form of
pneumonia, caused by an organism, Pneumocystis carinii (PCP), was
observed in a patient receiving MOPP (the same pneumonia, arising
spontaneously in immune-compromised gay men in 1981, would auger the
arrival of the HIV epidemic in America). Perhaps the most disturbing
side effect of chemotherapy would emerge nearly a decade later. Several
young men and women, cured of Hodgkin’s disease, would relapse with a
second cancer—typically an aggressive, drug-resistant leukemia—caused by
the prior treatment with MOPP chemotherapy. As with radiation, cytotoxic
chemotherapy would thus turn out to be a double-edged sword:
cancer-curing on one hand, and cancer-causing on the other.</p>
<p>But the evidently grim litany of side effects notwithstanding, even
early in the course of treatment, there was payoff. In many of the young
men and women, the palpable, swollen lymph nodes dissolved in weeks. A
twelve-year-old boy from Illinois had been so ravaged by Hodgkin’s that
his weight had sunk to fifty pounds; within three months of treatment,
he gained nearly half his body weight and shot up two feet in height. In
others, the stranglehold of Hodgkin’s disease loosened on the organs.
Pleural effusions gradually cleared and the nodes in the gut
disappeared. As the months passed, it was clear that combination chemo
had struck gold once again. At the end of half a year, thirty-five of
the forty-three patients had achieved a complete remission. The MOPP
trial did not have a control group, but one was not needed to discern
the effect. The response and remission rate were unprecedented for
advanced Hodgkin’s disease. The success would continue in the long-term:
more than half the initial cohort of patients would be cured.</p>
<p>Even Kaplan, not an early believer in chemotherapy, was astonished.
“Some of the patients with advanced disease have now survived relapse
free,” he wrote. “The advent of multiple-drug chemotherapy has
dramatically changed the prognosis of patients with previously untreated
stage III or stage IV Hodgkin’s disease.”</p>
<p>In May 1968, as the MOPP trial was ascending to its unexpected
crescendo, there was equally unexpected news in the world of
lymphoblastic leukemia.</p>
<p>Frei and Freireich’s VAMP regimen had trailed off at a strange and
bleak point. Combination chemo had cured most of the children of
leukemia in their blood and bone marrow, but the cancer had explosively
relapsed in the brain. In the months following VAMP in 1962, most of
these children had hobbled back to the clinic with seemingly innocuous
neurological complaints and then spiraled furiously toward their deaths
just a week or two afterward. VAMP, once widely touted as the
institute’s success story, had turned, instead, into its progressive
nightmare. Of the fifteen patients treated on the initial protocol, only
two still survived. At the NCI, the ambition and bravado that had
spurred the original studies was rapidly tipping toward a colder
reality. Perhaps Farber’s critics had been right. Perhaps lymphoblastic
leukemia was a disease that could, at best, be sent into a flickering
remission, but never cured. Perhaps palliative care was the best option
after all.</p>
<p>But having tasted the success of high-dose chemotherapy, many
oncologists could not scale back their optimism: What if even VAMP had
not been intensive enough? What if a chemotherapy regimen could be
muscled up further, pushed closer to the brink of tolerability?</p>
<p>The leader of this gladiatorial camp was a protégé of Farber’s, a
thirty-six-year-old oncologist, Donald Pinkel, who had been recruited
from Boston to start a leukemia program in Memphis, Tennessee.* In many
ways, Memphis was the antipode of Boston. Convulsing with bitter racial
tensions and rock-and-roll music—gyrating between the gold and pink of
the Graceland mansion in its south and the starkly segregated black
neighborhoods in its north—Memphis was turbulent, unpredictable,
colorful, perennially warm, and, medically speaking, virtually a
no-man’s-land. Pinkel’s new hospital, called St. Jude’s (named, aptly
enough, after the patron saint of lost causes), rose like a marooned
concrete starfish out of a concrete parking lot on a barren field. In
1961, when Pinkel arrived, the hospital was barely functional, with “no
track record, uncertain finances, an unfinished building, no employees
or faculty.”</p>
<p>Still, Pinkel got a chemotherapy ward up and running, with nurses,
residents, and fellows trained in administering the toxic, mercurial
drugs. And flung far from the epicenters of leukemia research in New
York and Boston, Pinkel’s team was determined to outdo every other
leukemia trial—the edge outmoding the center—to push the logic of
high-dose combination chemotherapy to its extreme. Pinkel thus hammered
away in trial after trial, edging his way toward the outer limit of
tolerability. And Pinkel and his collaborators emerged with four crucial
innovations to the prior regimens.†</p>
<p>First, Pinkel reasoned that while combinations of drugs were
necessary to induce remissions, combinations were insufficient in
themselves. Perhaps one needed combinations of combinations—six, seven,
or even eight different chemical poisons mixed and matched together for
maximum effect.</p>
<p>Second, since the nervous system relapses had likely occurred because
even these highly potent chemicals could not breach the blood-brain
barrier, perhaps one needed to instill chemotherapy directly into the
nervous system by injecting it into the fluid that bathes the spinal
cord.</p>
<p>Third, perhaps even that instillation was not enough. Since X-rays
could penetrate the brain regardless of the blood-brain barrier, perhaps
one needed to add high-dose radiation to the skull to kill residual
cells in the brain.</p>
<p>And finally, as Min Chiu Li had seen with choriocarcinoma, perhaps
one needed to continue chemotherapy not just for weeks and months as
Frei and Freireich had done, but for month after month, stretching into
two or even three years.</p>
<p>The treatment protocol that emerged from these guiding principles
could only be described as, as one of Pinkel’s colleagues called it, “an
all-out combat.” To start with, the standard antileukemic drugs were
given in rapid-fire succession. Then, at defined intervals, methotrexate
was injected into the spinal canal using a spinal tap. The brain was
irradiated with high doses of X-rays. Then, chemotherapy was bolstered
even further with higher doses of drugs and alternating intervals, “in
maximum tolerated doses.” Antibiotics and transfusions were usually
needed, often in succession, often for weeks on end. The treatment
lasted up to two and a half years; it involved multiple exposures to
radiation, scores of blood tests, dozens of spinal taps, and multiple
intravenous drugs—a strategy so precise and demanding that one journal
refused to publish it, concerned that it was impossible to even dose it
and monitor it correctly without killing several patients in the trials.
Even at St. Jude’s, the regimen was considered so overwhelmingly toxic
that the trial was assigned to relatively junior physicians under
Pinkel’s supervision because the senior researchers, knowing its risks,
did not want to run it. Pinkel called it “total therapy.”</p>
<p>As fellows, we called it “total hell.”</p>
<p>Carla Reed entered this form of hell in the summer of 2004.
Chemotherapy and radiation came back-to-back, one dark tide after
another. Some days she got home in the evening (her children already in
bed, her husband waiting with dinner) only to turn around and come back
the next morning. She lost sleep, her hair, and her appetite and then
something more important and ineffable—her animus, her drive, her will.
She walked around the hospital like a zombie, shuffling in small steps
from the blue vinyl couch in the infusion room to the water dispenser in
the central corridor, then back to the couch in those evenly measured
steps. “The radiation treatment was the last straw,” she recalled.
“Lying on the treatment table as still as death, with the mask on my
face, I often wondered whether I would even wake up.” Even her mother,
who had flown in and out of Boston regularly during Carla’s first month
of treatment, retreated to her own house in Florida, red-eyed and
exhausted.</p>
<p>Carla withdrew even more deeply into her own world. Her melancholy
hardened into something impenetrable, a carapace, and she pulled into it
instinctually, shutting everything out. She lost her friends. During her
first few visits, I noticed that she often brought a cheerful young
woman as a companion. One morning, I noticed that the friend was
missing.</p>
<p>“No company today?” I asked.</p>
<p>Carla looked away and shrugged her shoulders. “We had a falling-out.”
There was something steely, mechanical in her voice. “She needed to be
needed, and I just couldn’t fulfill that demand. Not now.”</p>
<p>I found myself, embarrassingly enough, sympathizing with the missing
friend. As Carla’s doctor, I needed to be needed as well, to be
acknowledged, even as a peripheral participant in her battle. But Carla
had barely any emotional energy for her own recuperation—and certainly
none to spare for the needs of others. For her, the struggle with
leukemia had become so deeply personalized, so interiorized, that the
rest of us were ghostly onlookers in the periphery: we were the zombies
walking outside her head. Her clinic visits began and ended with awkward
pauses. Walking across the hospital in the morning to draw yet another
bone marrow biopsy, with the wintry light crosshatching the rooms, I
felt a certain dread descend on me, a heaviness that bordered on
sympathy but never quite achieved it.</p>
<p>Test came after test. Seven months into her course, Carla had now
visited the clinic sixty-six times, had had fifty-eight blood tests,
seven spinal taps, and several bone marrow biopsies. One writer, a
former nurse, described the typical course of “total therapy” in terms
of the tests involved: “From the time of his diagnosis, Eric’s illness
had lasted 628 days. He had spent one quarter of these days either in a
hospital bed or visiting the doctors. He had received more than eight
hundred blood tests, numerous spinal and bone marrow taps, 30 X-rays,
120 biochemical tests, and more than two hundred transfusions. No fewer
than twenty doctors—hematologists, pulmonologists, neurologists,
surgeons, specialists and so on—were involved in his treatment, not
including the psychologist and a dozen nurses.”</p>
<p>How Pinkel and his team convinced four- and six-year-olds in Memphis
to complete that typical routine remains a mystery in its own right. But
he did. In July 1968, the St. Jude’s team published its preliminary data
on the results of the most advanced iteration of total therapy.
(Pinkel’s team would run eight consecutive trials between 1968 and 1979,
each adding another modification to the regimen.) This particular trial,
an early variant, was nonrandomized and small, a single hospital’s
experience with a single cohort of patients. But despite all the
caveats, the result was electrifying. The Memphis team had treated
thirty-one patients in all. Twenty-seven of them had attained a full
remission. The median time to relapse (the time between diagnosis and
relapse, a measure of the efficacy of treatment) had stretched out to
nearly five years—more than twenty times the longest remissions achieved
by most of Farber’s first patients.</p>
<p>But most important, thirteen patients, about a third of the original
cohort, had never relapsed. They were still alive, off chemotherapy. The
children had come back to the clinic month after month. The longest
remission was now in its sixth year, half the lifetime of that
child.</p>
<p>In 1979, Pinkel’s team revisited the entire cohort of patients
treated over several years with total therapy. Overall, 278 patients in
eight consecutive trials had completed their courses of medicines and
stopped chemotherapy. Of those, about one-fifth had relapsed. The rest,
80 percent—remained disease free after chemotherapy—“cured,” as far as
anyone could tell. “ALL in children cannot be considered an incurable
disease,” Pinkel wrote in a review article. “Palliation is no longer an
acceptable approach to its initial treatment.”</p>
<p>He was writing to the future, of course, but in a more mystical sense
he was writing back to the past, to the doctors who had been deeply
nihilistic about therapy for leukemia and had once argued with Farber to
let his children quietly “die in peace.”</p>

years at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, before
moving to Memphis in 1961.</li>

<p>† The Roswell Park group, led by James Holland, and Joseph Burchenal
at the Memorial Hospital in New York continued to collaborate with
Pinkel in developing the leukemia protocols.</p>
