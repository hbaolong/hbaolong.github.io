<h4 id="a-city-of-strings">A City of Strings</h4>
<p>In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city’s
life, inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white
or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a
relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings
become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the
inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled.</p>
<p>—Italo Calvino</p>
<p>Weinberg may briefly have forgotten about the therapeutic implication
of neu, but oncogenes, by their very nature, could not easily be
forgotten. In his book Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino describes a
fictional metropolis in which every relationship between one household
and the next is denoted by a piece of colored string stretched between
the two houses. As the metropolis grows, the mesh of strings thickens
and the individual houses blur away. In the end, Calvino’s city becomes
no more than an interwoven network of colored strings.</p>
<p>If someone were to draw a similar map of relationships among genes in
a normal human cell, then proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors such as
ras, myc, neu, and Rb would sit at the hub of this cellular city,
radiating webs of colored strings in every direction. Proto-oncogenes
and tumor suppressors are the molecular pivots of the cell. They are the
gatekeepers of cell division, and the division of cells is so central to
our physiology that genes and pathways that coordinate this process
intersect with nearly every other aspect of our biology. In the
laboratory, we call this the six-degrees-of-separation-from-cancer rule:
you can ask any biological question, no matter how seemingly
distant—what makes the heart fail, or why worms age, or even how birds
learn songs—and you will end up, in fewer than six genetic steps,
connecting with a proto-oncogene or tumor suppressor.</p>
<p>It should hardly come as a surprise, then, that neu was barely
forgotten in Weinberg’s laboratory when it was resurrected in another.
In the summer of 1984, a team of researchers, collaborating with
Weinberg, discovered the human homolog of the neu gene. Noting its
resemblance to another growth-modulating gene discovered previously—the
Human EGF Receptor (HER)—the researchers called the gene Her-2.</p>
<p>A gene by any other name may still be the same gene, but something
crucial had shifted in the story of neu. Weinberg’s gene had been
discovered in an academic laboratory. Much of Weinberg’s attention had
been focused on dissecting the molecular mechanism of the neu oncogene.
Her-2, in contrast, was discovered on the sprawling campus of the
pharmaceutical company Genentech. The difference in venue, and the
resulting difference in goals, would radically alter the fate of this
gene. For Weinberg, neu had represented a route to understanding the
fundamental biology of neuroblastoma. For Genentech, Her-2 represented a
route to developing a new drug.</p>
<p>Located on the southern edge of San Francisco, sandwiched among the
powerhouse labs of Stanford, UCSF, and Berkeley and the burgeoning
start-ups of Silicon Valley, Genentech—short for Genetic Engineering
Technology—was born out of an idea imbued with deep alchemic symbolism.
In the late 1970s, researchers at Stanford and UCSF had invented a
technology termed “recombinant DNA.” This technology allowed genes to be
manipulated—engineered—in a hitherto unimaginable manner. Genes could be
shuttled from one organism to another: a cow gene could be transferred
into bacteria, or a human protein synthesized in dog cells. Genes could
also be spliced together to create new genes, creating proteins never
found in nature. Genentech imagined leveraging this technology of genes
to develop a pharmacopoeia of novel drugs. Founded in 1976, the company
licensed recombinant DNA technology from UCSF, raised a paltry 00,000 in
venture funds, and launched its hunt for these novel drugs.</p>
<p>A “drug,” in bare conceptual terms, is any substance that can produce
an effect on the physiology of an animal. Drugs can be simple molecules;
water and salt, under appropriate circumstances, can function as potent
pharmacological agents. Or drugs can be complex, multifaceted
chemicals—molecules derived from nature, such as penicillin, or
chemicals synthesized artificially, such as aminopterin. Among the most
complex drugs in medicine are proteins, molecules synthesized by cells
that can exert diverse effects on human physiology. Insulin, made by
pancreas cells, is a protein that regulates blood sugar and can be used
to control diabetes. Growth hormone, made by the pituitary cells,
augments growth by increasing the metabolism of muscle and bone
cells.</p>
<p>Before Genentech, protein drugs, although recognizably potent, had
been notoriously difficult to produce. Insulin, for instance, was
produced by grinding up cow and pig innards into a soup and then
extracting the protein from the mix—one pound of insulin from every
eight thousand pounds of pancreas. Growth hormone, used to treat a form
of dwarfism, was extracted from pituitary glands dissected out of
thousands of human cadavers. Clotting drugs to treat bleeding disorders
came from liters of human blood.</p>
<p>Recombinant DNA technology allowed Genentech to synthesize human
proteins de novo: rather than extracting proteins from animal and human
organs, Genentech could “engineer” a human gene into a bacterium, say,
and use the bacterial cell as a bioreactor to produce vast quantities of
that protein. The technology was transformative. In 1982, Genentech
unveiled the first “recombinant” human insulin; in 1984, it produced a
clotting factor used to control bleeding in patients with hemophilia; in
1985, it created a recombinant version of human growth hormone—all
created by engineering the production of human proteins in bacterial or
animal cells.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, though, after an astonishing growth spurt,
Genentech ran out of existing drugs to mass-produce using recombinant
technology. Its early victories, after all, had been the result of a
process and not a product: the company had found a radical new way to
produce old medicines. Now, as Genentech set out to invent new drugs
from scratch, it was forced to change its winning strategy: it needed to
find targets for drugs—proteins in cells that might play a critical role
in the physiology of a disease that might, in turn, be turned on or off
by other proteins produced using recombinant DNA.</p>
<p>It was under the aegis of this “target discovery” program that Axel
Ullrich, a German scientist working at Genentech, rediscovered
Weinberg’s gene—Her-2/neu, the oncogene tethered to the cell membrane.*
But having discovered the gene, Genentech did not know what to do with
it. The drugs that Genentech had successfully synthesized thus far were
designed to treat human diseases in which a protein or a signal was
absent or low—insulin for diabetics, clotting factors for hemophiliacs,
growth hormone for dwarfs. An oncogene was the opposite—not a missing
signal, but a signal in overabundance. Genentech could fabricate a
missing protein in bacterial cells, but it had yet to learn how to
inactivate a hyperactive protein in a human cell.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1986, while Genentech was still puzzling over a
method to inactivate oncogenes, Ullrich presented a seminar at the
University of California in Los Angeles. Flamboyant and exuberant,
dressed in a dark, formal suit, Ullrich was a riveting speaker. He
floored his audience with the incredible story of the isolation of
Her-2, and the serendipitous convergence of that discovery with
Weinberg’s prior work. But he left his listeners searching for a punch
line. Genentech was a drug company. Where was the drug?</p>
<p>Dennis Slamon, a UCLA oncologist, attended Ullrich’s talk that
afternoon in 1986. The son of an Appalachian coal miner, Slamon had come
to UCLA as a fellow in oncology after medical school at the University
of Chicago. He was a peculiar amalgam of smoothness and tenacity, a
“velvet jackhammer,” as one reporter described him. Early in his
academic life he had acquired what he called “a murderous resolve” to
cure cancer, but thus far, it was all resolve and no result. In Chicago,
Slamon had performed a series of exquisite studies on a human leukemia
virus called HTLV-1, the lone retrovirus shown to cause a human cancer.
But HTLV-1 was a fleetingly rare cause of cancer. Murdering viruses,
Slamon knew, would not cure cancer. He needed a method to kill an
oncogene.</p>
<p>Slamon, hearing Ullrich’s story of Her-2, made a quick, intuitive
connection. Ullrich had an oncogene; Genentech wanted a drug—but an
intermediate was missing. A drug without a disease is a useless tool; to
make a worthwhile cancer drug, both needed a cancer in which the Her-2
gene was hyperactive. Slamon had a panel of cancers that he could test
for Her-2 hyperactivity. A compulsive pack rat, like Thad Dryja in
Boston, Slamon had been collecting and storing samples of cancer tissues
from patients who had undergone surgery at UCLA, all saved in a vast
freezer. Slamon proposed a simple collaboration. If Ullrich sent him the
DNA probes for Her-2 from Genentech, Slamon could test his collection of
cancer cells for samples with hyperactive Her-2—thus bridging the gap
between the oncogene and a human cancer.</p>
<p>Ullrich agreed. In 1986, he sent Slamon the Her-2 probe to test on
cancer samples. In a few months, Slamon reported back to Ullrich that he
had found a distinct pattern, although he did not fully understand it.
Cancer cells that become habitually dependent on the activity of a gene
for their growth can amplify that gene by making multiple copies of the
gene in the chromosome. This phenomenon—like an addict feeding an
addiction by ramping up the use of a drug—is called oncogene
amplification. Her-2, Slamon found, was highly amplified in breast
cancer samples, but not in all breast cancers. Based on the pattern of
staining, breast cancers could neatly be divided into Her-2 amplified
and Her-2 unamplified samples—Her-2 positive and Her-2 negative.</p>
<p>Puzzled by the “on-off” pattern, Slamon sent an assistant to
determine whether Her-2 positive tumors behaved differently from Her-2
negative tumors. The search yielded yet another extraordinary pattern:
breast tumors that amplified Ullrich’s gene tended to be more
aggressive, more metastatic, and more likely to kill. Her-2
amplification marked the tumors with the worst prognosis.</p>
<p>Slamon’s data set off a chain reaction in Ullrich’s lab at Genentech.
The association of Her-2 with a subtype of cancer—aggressive breast
cancer—prompted an important experiment. What would happen, Ullrich
wondered, if Her-2 activity could somehow be shut off? Was the cancer
truly “addicted” to amplified Her-2? And if so, might squelching the
addiction signal using an anti-Her-2 drug block the growth of the cancer
cells? Ullrich was tiptoeing around the afternoon experiment that
Weinberg and Padhy had forgotten to perform.</p>
<p>Ullrich knew where he might look for a drug to shut off Her-2
function. By the mid-1980s, Genentech had organized itself into an
astonishing simulacrum of a university. The South San Francisco campus
had departments, conferences, lectures, subgroups, even researchers in
cutoff jeans playing Frisbee on the lawns. One afternoon, Ullrich walked
to the Immunology Division at Genentech. The division specialized in the
creation of immunological molecules. Ullrich wondered whether someone in
immunology might be able to design a drug to bind Her-2 and possibly
erase its signaling.</p>
<p>Ullrich had a particular kind of protein in mind—an antibody.
Antibodies are immunological proteins that bind their targets with
exquisite affinity and specificity. The immune system synthesizes
antibodies to bind and kill specific targets on bacteria and viruses;
antibodies are nature’s magic bullets. In the mid-1970s, two
immunologists at Cambridge University, Cesar Milstein and George Kohler,
had devised a method to produce vast quantities of a single antibody
using a hybrid immune cell that had been physically fused to a cancer
cell. (The immune cell secreted the antibody while the cancer cell, a
specialist in uncontrolled growth, turned it into a factory.) The
discovery had instantly been hailed as a potential route to a cancer
cure. But to exploit antibodies therapeutically, scientists needed to
identify targets unique to cancer cells, and such cancer-specific
targets had proved notoriously difficult to identify. Ullrich believed
that he had found one such target. Her-2, amplified in some breast
tumors but barely visible in normal cells, was perhaps Kohler’s missing
bull’s-eye.</p>
<p>At UCLA, meanwhile, Slamon had performed another crucial experiment
with Her-2 expressing cancers. He had implanted these cancers into mice,
where they had exploded into friable, metastatic tumors, recapitulating
the aggressive human disease. In 1988, Genentech’s immunologists
successfully produced a mouse antibody that bound and inactivated Her-2.
Ullrich sent Slamon the first vials of the antibody, and Slamon launched
a series of pivotal experiments. When he treated Her-2 overexpressing
breast cancer cells in a dish with the antibody, the cells stopped
growing, then involuted and died. More impressively, when he injected
his living, tumor-bearing mice with the Her-2 antibody, the tumors also
disappeared. It was as perfect a result as he or Ullrich could have
hoped for. Her-2 inhibition worked in an animal model.</p>
<p>Slamon and Ullrich now had all three essential ingredients for a
targeted therapy for cancer: an oncogene, a form of cancer that
specifically activated that oncogene, and a drug that specifically
targeted it. Both expected Genentech to leap at the opportunity to
produce a new protein drug to erase an oncogene’s hyperactive signal.
But Ullrich, holed away in his lab with Her-2, had lost touch with the
trajectory of the company outside the lab. Genentech, he now discovered,
was abandoning its interest in cancer. Through the 1980s, as Ullrich and
Slamon had been hunting for a target specific to cancer cells, several
other pharmaceutical companies had tried to develop anticancer drugs
using the limited knowledge of the mechanisms driving the growth of
cancer cells. Predictably, the drugs that had emerged were largely
indiscriminate—toxic to both cancer cells and normal cells—and
predictably, all had failed miserably in clinical trials. Ullrich and
Slamon’s approach—an oncogene and an oncogene-targeted antibody—was
vastly more sophisticated and specific, but Genentech was worried that
pouring money into the development of another drug that failed would
cripple the company’s finances. Chastened by the experience of
others—“allergic to cancer,” as one Genentech researcher described
it—Genentech pulled funding away from most of its cancer projects.</p>
<p>The decision created a deep rift in the company. A small cadre of
scientists ardently supported the cancer program, but Genentech’s
executives wanted to focus on simpler and more profitable drugs. Her-2
was caught in the cross fire. Drained and dejected, Ullrich left
Genentech. He would eventually join an academic laboratory in Germany,
where he could work on cancer genetics without the fickle pressures of a
pharmaceutical company constraining his science.</p>
<p>Slamon, now working alone at UCLA, tried furiously to keep the Her-2
effort alive at Genentech, even though he wasn’t on the company’s
payroll. “Nobody gave a shit except him,” John Curd, Genentech’s medical
director, recalled. Slamon became a pariah at Genentech, a pushy,
obsessed gadfly who would often jet up from Los Angeles and lurk in the
corridors seeking to interest anyone he could in his mouse antibody.
Most scientists had lost interest. But Slamon retained the faith of a
small group of Genentech scientists, scientists nostalgic for the
pioneering, early days of Genentech when problems had been taken on
precisely because they were intractable. An MIT-educated geneticist,
David Botstein, and a molecular biologist, Art Levinson, both at
Genentech, had been strong proponents of the Her-2 project. (Levinson
had come to Genentech from Michael Bishop’s lab at UCSF, where he had
worked on the phosphorylating function of src; oncogenes were stitched
into his psyche.) Pulling strings, resources, and connections, Slamon
and Levinson convinced a tiny entrepreneurial team to push ahead with
the Her-2 project.</p>
<p>Marginally funded, the work edged along, almost invisible to
Genentech’s executives. In 1989, Mike Shepard, an immunologist at
Genentech, improved the production and purification of the Her-2
antibody. But the purified mouse antibody, Slamon knew, was far from a
human drug. Mouse antibodies, being “foreign” proteins, provoke a potent
immune response in humans and make terrible human drugs. To circumvent
that response, Genentech’s antibody needed to be converted into a
protein that more closely resembled a human antibody. This process,
evocatively called “humanizing” an antibody, is a delicate art, somewhat
akin to translating a novel; what matters is not just the content, but
the ineffable essence of the antibody—its form. Genentech’s resident
“humanizer” was Paul Carter, a quiet, twenty-nine-year-old Englishman
who had learned the craft at Cambridge from Cesar Milstein, the
scientist who had first produced these antibodies using fused immune and
cancer cells. Under Slamon’s and Shepard’s guidance, Carter set about
humanizing the mouse antibody. In the summer of 1990, Carter proudly
produced a fully humanized Her-2 antibody ready to be used in clinical
trials. The antibody, now a potential drug, would soon be renamed
Herceptin, fusing the words Her-2, intercept, and inhibitor.*</p>
<p>Such was the halting, traumatic birth of the new drug that it was
easy to forget the enormity of what had been achieved. Slamon had
identified Her-2 amplification in breast cancer tissue in 1987; Carter
and Shepard had produced a humanized antibody against it by 1990. They
had moved from cancer to target to drug in an astonishing three years, a
pace unprecedented in the history of cancer.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1990, Barbara Bradfield, a forty-eight-year-old
woman from Burbank, California, discovered a mass in her breast and a
lump under her arm. A biopsy confirmed what she already suspected: she
had breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. She was treated
with a bilateral mastectomy followed by nearly seven months of
chemotherapy. “When I was finished with all that,” she recalled, “I felt
as if I had crossed a river of tragedy.”</p>
<p>But there was more river to ford: Bradfield’s life was hit by yet
another incommensurate tragedy. In the winter of 1991, driving on a
highway not far from their house, her daughter, twenty-three years old
and pregnant, was killed in a fiery accident. A few months later,
sitting numbly in a Bible-study class one morning, Bradfield let her
fingers wander up to the edge of her neck. A new grape-size mass had
appeared just above her collarbone. Her breast cancer had relapsed and
metastasized—almost certainly a harbinger of death.</p>
<p>Bradfield’s oncologist in Burbank offered her more chemotherapy, but
she declined it. She enrolled in an alternative herbal-therapy program
and bought a vegetable juicer and planned a trip to Mexico. When her
oncologist asked if he could send samples of her breast cancer to
Slamon’s lab at UCLA for a second opinion, she agreed reluctantly. A
faraway doctor performing unfamiliar tests on her tumor sample, she
knew, could not possibly affect her.</p>
<p>One afternoon in the summer of 1991, Bradfield received a phone call
from Slamon. He introduced himself as a researcher who had been
analyzing her slides. Slamon told Bradfield about Her-2. “His tone
changed,” she recalled. Her tumor, he said, had one of the highest
levels of amplified Her-2 that he had ever seen. Slamon told her that he
was launching a trial of an antibody that bound Her-2 and that she would
be the ideal candidate for the new drug. Bradfield refused. “I was at
the end of my road,” she said, “and I had accepted what seemed
inevitable.” Slamon tried to reason with her for a while, but found her
unbending. He thanked her for her consideration and rang off.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, though, Slamon was back on the telephone. He
apologized for the intrusion, but her decision had troubled him all
night. Of all the variants of Her-2 amplification that he had
encountered, hers had been truly extraordinary; Bradfield’s tumor was
chock-full of Her-2, almost hypnotically drunk on the oncogene. He
begged her once again to join his trial.</p>
<p>“Survivors look back and see omens, messages they missed,” Joan
Didion wrote. For Bradfield, Slamon’s second phone call was an omen that
was not missed; something in that conversation pierced through a shield
that she had drawn around herself. On a warm August morning in 1992,
Bradfield visited Slamon in his clinic at UCLA. He met her in the
hallway and led her to a room in the back. Under the microscope, he
showed her the breast cancer that had been excised from her body, with
its dark ringlets of Her-2 labeled cells. On a whiteboard, he drew a
step-by-step picture of an epic scientific journey. He began with the
discovery of neu, its rediscovery in Ullrich’s lab, the struggles to
produce a drug, culminating in the antibody stitched together so
carefully by Shepard and Carter. Bradfield considered the line that
stretched from oncogene to drug. She agreed to join Slamon’s trial.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinarily fortunate decision. In the four months
between Slamon’s phone call and the first infusion of Herceptin,
Bradfield’s tumor had erupted, spraying sixteen new masses into her
lung.</p>
<p>Fifteen women, including Bradfield, enrolled in Slamon’s trial at
UCLA in 1992. (The number would later be expanded to thirty-seven.) The
drug was given for nine weeks, in combination with cisplatin, a standard
chemotherapy agent used to kill breast cancer cells, both delivered
intravenously. As a matter of convenience, Slamon planned to treat all
the women on the same day and in the same room. The effect was
theatrical; this was a stage occupied by a beleaguered set of actors.
Some women had begged and finagled their way into Slamon’s trial through
friends and relatives; others, such as Bradfield, had been begged to
join it. “All of us knew that we were living on borrowed time,”
Bradfield said, “and so we felt twice as alive and lived twice as
fiercely.” A Chinese woman in her fifties brought stash after stash of
traditional herbs and salves that she swore had kept her alive thus far;
she would take oncology’s newest drug, Herceptin, only if she could also
take its most ancient drugs with it. A frail, thin woman in her
thirties, recently relapsed with breast cancer after a bone marrow
transplant, glowered silently and intensely in a corner. Some treated
their illness reverentially. Some were bewildered, some too embittered
to care. A mother from Boston in her midfifties cracked raunchy jokes
about her cancer. The daylong drill of infusions and blood tests was
exhausting. In the late evening, after all the tests, the women went
their own ways. Bradfield went home and prayed. Another woman soused
herself with martinis.</p>
<p>The lump on Bradfield’s neck—the only tumor in the group that could
be physically touched, measured, and watched—became the compass for the
trial. On the morning of the first intravenous infusion of the Her-2
antibody, all the women came up to feel the lump, one by one, running
their hands across Bradfield’s collarbone. It was a peculiarly intimate
ritual that would be repeated every week. Two weeks after the first dose
of the antibody, when the group filed past Bradfield, touching the node
again, the change was incontrovertible. Bradfield’s tumor had softened
and visibly shrunk. “We began to believe that something was happening
here,” Bradfield recalled. “Suddenly, the weight of our good fortune hit
us.”</p>
<p>Not everyone was as fortunate as Bradfield. Exhausted and nauseous
one evening, the young woman with relapsed metastatic cancer was unable
to keep down the fluids needed to hydrate her body. She vomited through
the night and then, too tired to keep drinking and too sick to
understand the consequences, fell back into sleep. She died of kidney
failure the next week.</p>
<p>Bradfield’s extraordinary response continued. When the CT scans were
repeated two months into the trial, the tumor in her neck had virtually
disappeared, and the lung metastases had also diminished both in number
and size. The responses in many of the thirteen other women were more
ambiguous. At the three-month midpoint of the trial, when Slamon
reviewed the data with Genentech and the external trial monitors, tough
decisions clearly needed to be made. Tumors had remained unchanged in
size in some women—not shrunk, but static: was this to be counted as a
positive response? Some women with bone metastasis reported diminished
bone pain, but pain could not objectively be judged. After a prolonged
and bitter debate, the trial coordinators suggested dropping seven women
from the study because their responses could not be quantified. One
woman discontinued the drug herself. Only five of the original cohort,
including Bradfield, continued the trial to its six-month end point.
Embittered and disappointed, the others returned to their local
oncologists, their hopes for a miracle drug again dashed.</p>
<p>Barbara Bradfield finished eighteen weeks of therapy in 1993. She
survives today. A gray-haired woman with crystalline gray-blue eyes, she
lives in the small town of Puyallup near Seattle, hikes in the nearby
woods, and leads discussion groups for her church. She vividly remembers
her days at the Los Angeles clinic—the half-lit room in the back where
the nurses dosed the drugs, the strangely intimate touch of the other
women feeling the node in her neck. And Slamon, of course. “Dennis is my
hero,” she said. “I refused his first phone call, but I have never,
ever, refused him anything since that time.” The animation and energy in
her voice crackled across the phone line like an electrical current. She
quizzed me about my research. I thanked her for her time, but she, in
turn, apologized for the distraction. “Get back to work,” she said,
laughing. “There are people waiting for discoveries.”</p>
