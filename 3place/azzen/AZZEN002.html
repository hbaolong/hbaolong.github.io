<h4 id="prologue">Prologue</h4>
<p>Diseases desperate grown</p>
<p>By desperate appliance are relieved,</p>
<p>Or not at all.</p>
<p>—William Shakespeare,</p>
<p>Hamlet</p>
<p>Cancer begins and ends with people. In the midst of scientific
abstraction, it is sometimes possible to forget this one basic fact. . .
. Doctors treat diseases, but they also treat people, and this
precondition of their professional existence sometimes pulls them in two
directions at once.</p>
<p>—June Goodfield</p>
<p>On the morning of May 19, 2004, Carla Reed, a thirty-year-old
kindergarten teacher from Ipswich, Massachusetts, a mother of three
young children, woke up in bed with a headache. “Not just any headache,”
she would recall later, “but a sort of numbness in my head. The kind of
numbness that instantly tells you that something is terribly wrong.”</p>
<p>Something had been terribly wrong for nearly a month. Late in April,
Carla had discovered a few bruises on her back. They had suddenly
appeared one morning, like strange stigmata, then grown and vanished
over the next month, leaving large map-shaped marks on her back. Almost
indiscernibly, her gums had begun to turn white. By early May, Carla, a
vivacious, energetic woman accustomed to spending hours in the classroom
chasing down five- and six-year-olds, could barely walk up a flight of
stairs. Some mornings, exhausted and unable to stand up, she crawled
down the hallways of her house on all fours to get from one room to
another. She slept fitfully for twelve or fourteen hours a day, then
woke up feeling so overwhelmingly tired that she needed to haul herself
back to the couch again to sleep.</p>
<p>Carla and her husband saw a general physician and a nurse twice
during those four weeks, but she returned each time with no tests and
without a diagnosis. Ghostly pains appeared and disappeared in her
bones. The doctor fumbled about for some explanation. Perhaps it was a
migraine, she suggested, and asked Carla to try some aspirin. The
aspirin simply worsened the bleeding in Carla’s white gums.</p>
<p>Outgoing, gregarious, and ebullient, Carla was more puzzled than
worried about her waxing and waning illness. She had never been
seriously ill in her life. The hospital was an abstract place for her;
she had never met or consulted a medical specialist, let alone an
oncologist. She imagined and concocted various causes to explain her
symptoms—overwork, depression, dyspepsia, neuroses, insomnia. But in the
end, something visceral arose inside her—a seventh sense—that told Carla
something acute and catastrophic was brewing within her body.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 19, Carla dropped her three children with a
neighbor and drove herself back to the clinic, demanding to have some
blood tests. Her doctor ordered a routine test to check her blood
counts. As the technician drew a tube of blood from her vein, he looked
closely at the blood’s color, obviously intrigued. Watery, pale, and
dilute, the liquid that welled out of Carla’s veins hardly resembled
blood.</p>
<p>Carla waited the rest of the day without any news. At a fish market
the next morning, she received a call.</p>
<p>“We need to draw some blood again,” the nurse from the clinic
said.</p>
<p>“When should I come?” Carla asked, planning her hectic day. She
remembers looking up at the clock on the wall. A half-pound steak of
salmon was warming in her shopping basket, threatening to spoil if she
left it out too long.</p>
<p>In the end, commonplace particulars make up Carla’s memories of
illness: the clock, the car pool, the children, a tube of pale blood, a
missed shower, the fish in the sun, the tightening tone of a voice on
the phone. Carla cannot recall much of what the nurse said, only a
general sense of urgency. “Come now,” she thinks the nurse said. “Come
now.”</p>
<p>I heard about Carla’s case at seven o’clock on the morning of May 21,
on a train speeding between Kendall Square and Charles Street in Boston.
The sentence that flickered on my beeper had the staccato and deadpan
force of a true medical emergency: Carla Reed/New patient with
leukemia/14th Floor/Please see as soon as you arrive. As the train shot
out of a long, dark tunnel, the glass towers of the Massachusetts
General Hospital suddenly loomed into view, and I could see the windows
of the fourteenth floor rooms.</p>
<p>Carla, I guessed, was sitting in one of those rooms by herself,
terrifyingly alone. Outside the room, a buzz of frantic activity had
probably begun. Tubes of blood were shuttling between the ward and the
laboratories on the second floor. Nurses were moving about with
specimens, interns collecting data for morning reports, alarms beeping,
pages being sent out. Somewhere in the depths of the hospital, a
microscope was flickering on, with the cells in Carla’s blood coming
into focus under its lens.</p>
<p>I can feel relatively certain about all of this because the arrival
of a patient with acute leukemia still sends a shiver down the
hospital’s spine—all the way from the cancer wards on its upper floors
to the clinical laboratories buried deep in the basement. Leukemia is
cancer of the white blood cells—cancer in one of its most explosive,
violent incarnations. As one nurse on the wards often liked to remind
her patients, with this disease “even a paper cut is an emergency.”</p>
<p>For an oncologist in training, too, leukemia represents a special
incarnation of cancer. Its pace, its acuity, its breathtaking,
inexorable arc of growth forces rapid, often drastic decisions; it is
terrifying to experience, terrifying to observe, and terrifying to
treat. The body invaded by leukemia is pushed to its brittle
physiological limit—every system, heart, lung, blood, working at the
knife-edge of its performance. The nurses filled me in on the gaps in
the story. Blood tests performed by Carla’s doctor had revealed that her
red cell count was critically low, less than a third of normal. Instead
of normal white cells, her blood was packed with millions of large,
malignant white cells—blasts, in the vocabulary of cancer. Her doctor,
having finally stumbled upon the real diagnosis, had sent her to the
Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>In the long, bare hall outside Carla’s room, in the antiseptic gleam
of the floor just mopped with diluted bleach, I ran through the list of
tests that would be needed on her blood and mentally rehearsed the
conversation I would have with her. There was, I noted ruefully,
something rehearsed and robotic even about my sympathy. This was the
tenth month of my “fellowship” in oncology—a two-year immersive medical
program to train cancer specialists—and I felt as if I had gravitated to
my lowest point. In those ten indescribably poignant and difficult
months, dozens of patients in my care had died. I felt I was slowly
becoming inured to the deaths and the desolation—vaccinated against the
constant emotional brunt.</p>
<p>There were seven such cancer fellows at this hospital. On paper, we
seemed like a formidable force: graduates of five medical schools and
four teaching hospitals, sixty-six years of medical and scientific
training, and twelve postgraduate degrees among us. But none of those
years or degrees could possibly have prepared us for this training
program. Medical school, internship, and residency had been physically
and emotionally grueling, but the first months of the fellowship flicked
away those memories as if all of that had been child’s play, the
kindergarten of medical training.</p>
<p>Cancer was an all-consuming presence in our lives. It invaded our
imaginations; it occupied our memories; it infiltrated every
conversation, every thought. And if we, as physicians, found ourselves
immersed in cancer, then our patients found their lives virtually
obliterated by the disease. In Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s novel Cancer
Ward, Pavel Nikolayevich Rusanov, a youthful Russian in his midforties,
discovers that he has a tumor in his neck and is immediately whisked
away into a cancer ward in some nameless hospital in the frigid north.
The diagnosis of cancer—not the disease, but the mere stigma of its
presence—becomes a death sentence for Rusanov. The illness strips him of
his identity. It dresses him in a patient’s smock (a tragicomically
cruel costume, no less blighting than a prisoner’s jumpsuit) and assumes
absolute control of his actions. To be diagnosed with cancer, Rusanov
discovers, is to enter a borderless medical gulag, a state even more
invasive and paralyzing than the one that he has left behind.
(Solzhenitsyn may have intended his absurdly totalitarian cancer
hospital to parallel the absurdly totalitarian state outside it, yet
when I once asked a woman with invasive cervical cancer about the
parallel, she said sardonically, “Unfortunately, I did not need any
metaphors to read the book. The cancer ward was my confining state, my
prison.”)</p>
<p>As a doctor learning to tend cancer patients, I had only a partial
glimpse of this confinement. But even skirting its periphery, I could
still feel its power—the dense, insistent gravitational tug that pulls
everything and everyone into the orbit of cancer. A colleague, freshly
out of his fellowship, pulled me aside on my first week to offer some
advice. “It’s called an immersive training program,” he said, lowering
his voice. “But by immersive, they really mean drowning. Don’t let it
work its way into everything you do. Have a life outside the hospital.
You’ll need it, or you’ll get swallowed.”</p>
<p>But it was impossible not to be swallowed. In the parking lot of the
hospital, a chilly, concrete box lit by neon floodlights, I spent the
end of every evening after rounds in stunned incoherence, the car radio
crackling vacantly in the background, as I compulsively tried to
reconstruct the events of the day. The stories of my patients consumed
me, and the decisions that I made haunted me. Was it worthwhile
continuing yet another round of chemotherapy on a sixty-six-year-old
pharmacist with lung cancer who had failed all other drugs? Was is
better to try a tested and potent combination of drugs on a
twenty-six-year-old woman with Hodgkin’s disease and risk losing her
fertility, or to choose a more experimental combination that might spare
it? Should a Spanish-speaking mother of three with colon cancer be
enrolled in a new clinical trial when she can barely read the formal and
inscrutable language of the consent forms?</p>
<p>Immersed in the day-to-day management of cancer, I could only see the
lives and fates of my patients played out in color-saturated detail,
like a television with the contrast turned too high. I could not pan
back from the screen. I knew instinctively that these experiences were
part of a much larger battle against cancer, but its contours lay far
outside my reach. I had a novice’s hunger for history, but also a
novice’s inability to envision it.</p>
<p>But as I emerged from the strange desolation of those two fellowship
years, the questions about the larger story of cancer emerged with
urgency: How old is cancer? What are the roots of our battle against
this disease? Or, as patients often asked me: Where are we in the “war”
on cancer? How did we get here? Is there an end? Can this war even be
won?</p>
<p>This book grew out of the attempt to answer these questions. I delved
into the history of cancer to give shape to the shape-shifting illness
that I was confronting. I used the past to explain the present. The
isolation and rage of a thirty-six-year-old woman with stage III breast
cancer had ancient echoes in Atossa, the Persian queen who swaddled her
cancer-affected breast in cloth to hide it and then, in a fit of
nihilistic and prescient fury, had a slave cut it off with a knife. A
patient’s desire to amputate her stomach, ridden with cancer—“sparing
nothing,” as she put it to me—carried the memory of the
perfection-obsessed nineteenth-century surgeon William Halsted, who had
chiseled away at cancer with larger and more disfiguring surgeries, all
in the hopes that cutting more would mean curing more.</p>
<p>Roiling underneath these medical, cultural, and metaphorical
interceptions of cancer over the centuries was the biological
understanding of the illness—an understanding that had morphed, often
radically, from decade to decade. Cancer, we now know, is a disease
caused by the uncontrolled growth of a single cell. This growth is
unleashed by mutations—changes in DNA that specifically affect genes
that incite unlimited cell growth. In a normal cell, powerful genetic
circuits regulate cell division and cell death. In a cancer cell, these
circuits have been broken, unleashing a cell that cannot stop
growing.</p>
<p>That this seemingly simple mechanism—cell growth without barriers—can
lie at the heart of this grotesque and multifaceted illness is a
testament to the unfathomable power of cell growth. Cell division allows
us as organisms to grow, to adapt, to recover, to repair—to live. And
distorted and unleashed, it allows cancer cells to grow, to flourish, to
adapt, to recover, and to repair—to live at the cost of our living.
Cancer cells grow faster, adapt better. They are more perfect versions
of ourselves.</p>
<p>The secret to battling cancer, then, is to find means to prevent
these mutations from occurring in susceptible cells, or to find means to
eliminate the mutated cells without compromising normal growth. The
conciseness of that statement belies the enormity of the task. Malignant
growth and normal growth are so genetically intertwined that unbraiding
the two might be one of the most significant scientific challenges faced
by our species. Cancer is built into our genomes: the genes that unmoor
normal cell division are not foreign to our bodies, but rather mutated,
distorted versions of the very genes that perform vital cellular
functions. And cancer is imprinted in our society: as we extend our life
span as a species, we inevitably unleash malignant growth (mutations in
cancer genes accumulate with aging; cancer is thus intrinsically related
to age). If we seek immortality, then so, too, in a rather perverse
sense, does the cancer cell.</p>
<p>How, precisely, a future generation might learn to separate the
entwined strands of normal growth from malignant growth remains a
mystery. (“The universe,” the twentieth-century biologist J. B. S.
Haldane liked to say, “is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose”—and so is the trajectory of science.) But this much
is certain: the story, however it plays out, will contain indelible
kernels of the past. It will be a story of inventiveness, resilience,
and perseverance against what one writer called the most “relentless and
insidious enemy” among human diseases. But it will also be a story of
hubris, arrogance, paternalism, misperception, false hope, and hype, all
leveraged against an illness that was just three decades ago widely
touted as being “curable” within a few years.</p>
<p>In the bare hospital room ventilated by sterilized air, Carla was
fighting her own war on cancer. When I arrived, she was sitting with
peculiar calm on her bed, a schoolteacher jotting notes. (“But what
notes?” she would later recall. “I just wrote and rewrote the same
thoughts.”) Her mother, red-eyed and tearful, just off an overnight
flight, burst into the room and then sat silently in a chair by the
window, rocking forcefully. The din of activity around Carla had become
almost a blur: nurses shuttling fluids in and out, interns donning masks
and gowns, antibiotics being hung on IV poles to be dripped into her
veins.</p>
<p>I explained the situation as best I could. Her day ahead would be
full of tests, a hurtle from one lab to another. I would draw a bone
marrow sample. More tests would be run by pathologists. But the
preliminary tests suggested that Carla had acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
It is one of the most common forms of cancer in children, but rare in
adults. And it is—I paused here for emphasis, lifting my eyes up—often
curable.</p>
<p>Curable. Carla nodded at that word, her eyes sharpening. Inevitable
questions hung in the room: How curable? What were the chances that she
would survive? How long would the treatment take? I laid out the odds.
Once the diagnosis had been confirmed, chemotherapy would begin
immediately and last more than one year. Her chances of being cured were
about 30 percent, a little less than one in three.</p>
<p>We spoke for an hour, perhaps longer. It was now nine thirty in the
morning. The city below us had stirred fully awake. The door shut behind
me as I left, and a whoosh of air blew me outward and sealed Carla in.
