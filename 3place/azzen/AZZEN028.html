<h4 id="counting-cancer">Counting Cancer</h4>
<p>We must learn to count the living with that same particular attention
with which we number the dead.</p>
<p>—Audre Lorde</p>
<p>Counting is the religion of this generation. It is its hope and its
salvation.</p>
<p>—Gertrude Stein</p>
<p>In November 1985, with oncology caught at a pivotal crossroads
between the sobering realities of the present and the hype of past
promises, a Harvard biologist named John Cairns resurrected the task of
measuring progress in the War on Cancer.</p>
<p>The word resurrection implies a burial, and since the Fortune article
of 1937, composite assessments of the War on Cancer had virtually been
buried—oddly, in an overwhelming excess of information. Every minor
footfall and every infinitesimal step had been so obsessively reported
in the media that it had become nearly impossible to discern the
trajectory of the field as a whole. In part, Cairns was reacting to the
overgranularity of the view from the prior decade. He wanted to pull
away from the details and offer a bird’s-eye view. Were patients with
cancer surviving longer in general? Had the enormous investments in the
War on Cancer since 1971 translated into tangible clinical
achievements?</p>
<p>To quantify “progress,” an admittedly hazy metric, Cairns began by
revitalizing a fusty old record that had existed since World War II, the
cancer registry, a state-by-state statistical record of cancer-related
deaths subclassified by the type of cancer involved. “These registries,”
Cairns wrote in an article in Scientific American, “yield a rather
precise picture of the natural history of cancer, and that is a
necessary starting point for any discussion of treatment.” By poring
through that record, he hoped to draw a portrait of cancer over time—not
over days or weeks, but over decades.</p>
<p>Cairns began by using the cancer registry to estimate the number of
lives saved by the therapeutic advances in oncology since the 1950s.
(Since surgery and radiation therapy preceded the 1950s, these were
excluded; Cairns was more interested in advances that had emerged from
the brisk expansion in biomedical research since the fifties.) He
divided these therapeutic advances into various categories, then made
numerical conjectures about their relative effects on cancer
mortality.</p>
<p>The first of these categories was “curative” chemotherapy—the
approach championed by Frei and Freireich at the NCI and by Einhorn and
his colleagues at Indiana. Assuming relatively generous cure rates of
about 80 or 90 percent for the subtypes of cancer curable by
chemotherapy, Cairns estimated that between 2,000 and 3,000 lives were
being saved overall every year—700 children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, about 1,000 men and women with Hodgkin’s disease, 300 men with
advanced testicular cancer, and 20 to 30 women with choriocarcinoma.
(Variants of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, which were curable with
polychemotherapy by 1986, would have added another 2,000 lives, bringing
the total up to about 5,000, but Cairns did not include these cures in
his initial metric.)</p>
<p>“Adjuvant” chemotherapy—chemotherapy given after surgery, as in the
Bonadonna and Fisher breast cancer trials—contributed to another 10,000
to 20,000 lives saved annually. Finally, Cairns factored in screening
strategies such as Pap smears and mammograms that detected cancer in its
early stages. These, he estimated loosely, saved an additional 10,000 to
15,000 cancer-related deaths per year. The grand tally, generously
speaking, amounted to about 35,000 to 40,000 lives per year.</p>
<p>That number was to be contrasted with the annual incidence of cancer
in 1985—448 new cancer cases diagnosed for every 100,000 Americans, or
about 1 million every year—and the mortality from cancer in 1985—211
deaths for every 100,000, or 500,000 deaths every year. In short, even
with relatively liberal estimates about lives saved, less than one in
twenty patients diagnosed with cancer in America, and less than one in
ten of the total number of patients who would die of cancer, had
benefited from the advances in therapy and screening.</p>
<p>Cairns wasn’t surprised by the modesty of that number; in fact, he
claimed, no self-respecting epidemiologist should be. In the history of
medicine, no significant disease had ever been eradicated by a
treatment-related program alone. If one plotted the decline in deaths
from tuberculosis, for instance, the decline predated the arrival of new
antibiotics by several decades. Far more potently than any miracle
medicine, relatively uncelebrated shifts in civic arrangements—better
nutrition, housing, and sanitation, improved sewage systems and
ventilation—had driven TB mortality down in Europe and America. Polio
and smallpox had also dwindled as a result of vaccinations. Cairns
wrote, “The death rates from malaria, cholera, typhus, tuberculosis,
scurvy, pellagra and other scourges of the past have dwindled in the US
because humankind has learned how to prevent these diseases. . . . To
put most of the effort into treatment is to deny all precedent.”</p>
<p>Cairns’s article was widely influential in policy circles, but it
still lacked a statistical punch line. What it needed was some measure
of the comparative trends in cancer mortality over the years—whether
more or less people were dying of cancer in 1985 as compared to 1975. In
May 1986, less than a year after Cairns’s article, two of his colleagues
from Harvard, John Bailar and Elaine Smith, provided precisely such an
analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>To understand the Bailar-Smith analysis, we need to begin by
understanding what it was not. Right from the outset, Bailar rejected
the metric most familiar to patients: changes in survival rates over
time. A five-year survival rate is a measure of the fraction of patients
diagnosed with a particular kind of cancer who are alive at five years
after diagnosis. But a crucial pitfall of survival-rate analysis is that
it can be sensitive to biases.</p>
<p>To understand these biases, imagine two neighboring villages that
have identical populations and identical death rates from cancer. On
average, cancer is diagnosed at age seventy in both villages. Patients
survive for ten years after diagnosis and die at age eighty.</p>
<p>Imagine now that in one of those villages, a new, highly specific
test for cancer is introduced—say the level of a protein Preventin in
the blood as a marker for cancer. Suppose Preventin is a perfect
detection test. Preventin “positive” men and women are thus immediately
counted among those who have cancer.</p>
<p>Preventin, let us further suppose, is an exquisitely sensitive test
and reveals very early cancer. Soon after its introduction, the average
age of cancer diagnosis in village 1 thus shifts from seventy years to
sixty years, because earlier and earlier cancer is being caught by this
incredible new test. However, since no therapeutic intervention is
available even after the introduction of Preventin tests, the average
age of death remains identical in both villages.</p>
<p>To a naive observer, the scenario might produce a strange effect. In
village 1, where Preventin screening is active, cancer is now detected
at age sixty and patients die at age eighty—i.e., there is a twenty-year
survival. In village 2, without Preventin screening, cancer is detected
at age seventy and patients die at age eighty—i.e., a ten-year survival.
Yet the “increased” survival cannot be real. How can Preventin, by its
mere existence, have increased survival without any therapeutic
intervention?</p>
<p>The answer is immediately obvious: the increase in survival is, of
course, an artifact. Survival rates seem to increase, although what has
really increased is the time from diagnosis to death because of a
screening test.</p>
<p>A simple way to avoid this bias is to not measure survival rates, but
overall mortality. (In the example above, mortality remains unchanged,
even after the introduction of the test for earlier diagnosis.)</p>
<p>But here, too, there are profound methodological glitches.
“Cancer-related death” is a raw number in a cancer registry, a statistic
that arises from the diagnosis entered by a physician when pronouncing a
patient dead. The problem with comparing that raw number over long
stretches of time is that the American population (like any) is
gradually aging overall, and the rate of cancer-related mortality
naturally increases with it. Old age inevitably drags cancer with it,
like flotsam on a tide. A nation with a larger fraction of older
citizens will seem more cancer-ridden than a nation with younger
citizens, even if actual cancer mortality has not changed.</p>
<p>To compare samples over time, some means is needed to normalize two
populations to the same standard—in effect, by statistically “shrinking”
one into another. This brings us to the crux of the innovation in
Bailar’s analysis: to achieve this scaling, he used a particularly
effective form of normalization called age-adjustment.</p>
<p>To understand age-adjustment, imagine two very different populations.
One population is markedly skewed toward young men and women. The second
population is skewed toward older men and women. If one measures the
“raw” cancer deaths, the older-skewed population obviously has more
cancer deaths.</p>
<p>Now imagine normalizing the second population such that this age skew
is eliminated. The first population is kept as a reference. The second
population is adjusted: the age-skew is eliminated and the death rate
shrunk proportionally as well. Both populations now contain identical
age-adjusted populations of older and younger men, and the death rate,
adjusted accordingly, yields identical cancer-specific death rates.
Bailar performed this exercise repeatedly over dozens of years: he
divided the population for every year into age cohorts—20–29 years,
30–39 years, 40–49, and so forth—then used the population distribution
from 1980 (chosen arbitrarily as a standard) to convert the population
distributions for all other years into the same distribution. Cancer
rates were adjusted accordingly. Once all the distributions were fitted
into the same standard demographic, the populations could be studied and
compared over time.</p>
<p>Bailar and Smith published their article in May 1986—and it shook the
world of oncology by its roots. Even the moderately pessimistic Cairns
had expected at least a small decrease in cancer-related mortality over
time. Bailar and Smith found that even Cairns had been overgenerous:
between 1962 and 1985, cancer-related deaths had increased by 8.7
percent. That increase reflected many factors—most potently, an increase
in smoking rates in the 1950s that had resulted in an increase in lung
cancer.</p>
<p>One thing was frightfully obvious: cancer mortality was not declining
in the United States. There is “no evidence,” Bailar and Smith wrote
darkly, “that some thirty-five years of intense and growing efforts to
improve the treatment of cancer have had much overall effect on the most
fundamental measure of clinical outcome—death.” They continued, “We are
losing the war against cancer notwithstanding progress against several
uncommon forms of the disease [such as childhood leukemia and Hodgkin’s
disease], improvements in palliation and extension of productive years
of life. . . . Some thirty-five years of intense effort focused largely
on improving treatment must be judged a qualified failure.”</p>
<p>That phrase, “qualified failure,” with its mincing academic ring, was
deliberately chosen. In using it, Bailar was declaring his own
war—against the cancer establishment, against the NCI, against a
billion-dollar cancer-treatment industry. One reporter described him as
“a thorn in the side of the National Cancer Institute.” Doctors railed
against Bailar’s analysis, describing him as a naysayer, a hector, a
nihilist, a defeatist, a crank.</p>
<p>Predictably, a torrent of responses appeared in medical journals. One
camp of critics contended that the Bailar-Smith analysis appeared dismal
not because cancer treatment was ineffective, but because it was not
being implemented aggressively enough. Delivering chemotherapy, these
critics argued, was a vastly more complex process than Bailar and Smith
had surmised—so complex that even most oncologists often blanched at the
prospect of full-dose therapy. As evidence, they pointed to a survey
from 1985 that had estimated that only one-third of cancer doctors were
using the most effective combination regimen for breast cancer. “I
estimate that 10,000 lives could be saved by the early aggressive use of
polychemotherapy in breast cancer, as compared with the negligible
number of lives, perhaps several thousand, now being saved,” one
prominent critic wrote.</p>
<p>In principle, this might have been correct. As the ’85 survey
suggested, many doctors were indeed underdosing chemotherapy—at least by
the standards advocated by most oncologists, or even by the NCI. But the
obverse idea—that maximizing chemotherapy would maximize gains in
survival—was also untested. For some forms of cancer (some subtypes of
breast cancer, for instance) increasing the intensity of dosage would
eventually result in increasing efficacy. But for a vast majority of
cancers, more intensive regimens of standard chemotherapeutic drugs did
not necessarily mean more survival. “Hit hard and hit early,” a dogma
borrowed from the NCI’s experience with childhood leukemia, was not
going to be a general solution to all forms of cancer.</p>
<p>A more nuanced critique of Bailar and Smith came, unsurprisingly,
from Lester Breslow, the UCLA epidemiologist. Breslow reasoned that
while age-adjusted mortality was one method of appraising the War on
Cancer, it was by no means the only measure of progress or failure. In
fact, by highlighting only one measure, Bailar and Smith had created a
fallacy of their own: they had oversimplified the measure of progress.
“The problem with reliance on a single measure of progress,” Breslow
wrote, “is that the impression conveyed can vary dramatically when the
measure is changed.”</p>
<p>To illustrate his point, Breslow proposed an alternative metric. If
chemotherapy cured a five-year-old child of ALL, he argued, then it
saved a full sixty-five years of potential life (given an overall life
expectancy of about seventy). In contrast, the chemotherapeutic cure in
a sixty-five-year-old man contributed only five additional years given a
life expectancy of seventy. But Bailar and Smith’s chosen
metric—age-adjusted mortality—could not detect any difference in the two
cases. A young woman cured of lymphoma, with fifty additional years of
life, was judged by the same metric as an elderly woman cured of breast
cancer, who might succumb to some other cause of death in the next year.
If “years of life saved” was used as a measure of progress on cancer,
then the numbers turned far more palatable. Now, instead of losing the
War on Cancer, it appeared that we were winning it.</p>
<p>Breslow, pointedly, wasn’t recommending one form of calculus over
another; his point was to show that measurement itself was subjective.
“Our purpose in making these calculations,” he wrote, “is to indicate
how sensitive one’s conclusions are to the choice of measure. In 1980,
cancer was responsible for 1.824 million lost years of potential life in
the United States to age 65. If, however, the cancer mortality rates of
1950 had prevailed, 2.093 million years of potential life would have
been lost.”</p>
<p>The measurement of illness, Breslow was arguing, is an inherently
subjective activity: it inevitably ends up being a measure of ourselves.
Objective decisions come to rest on normative ones. Cairns or Bailar
could tell us how many absolute lives were being saved or lost by cancer
therapeutics. But to decide whether the investment in cancer research
was “worth it,” one needed to start by questioning the notion of “worth”
itself: was the life extension of a five-year-old “worth” more than the
life extension of a sixty-year-old? Even Bailar and Smith’s “most
fundamental measure of clinical outcome”—death—was far from fundamental.
Death (or at least the social meaning of death) could be counted and
recounted with other gauges, often resulting in vastly different
conclusions. The appraisal of diseases depends, Breslow argued, on our
self-appraisal. Society and illness often encounter each other in
parallel mirrors, each holding up a Rorschach test for the other.</p>
<p>Bailar might have been willing to concede these philosophical points,
but he had a more pragmatic agenda. He was using the numbers to prove a
principle. As Cairns had already pointed out, the only intervention ever
known to reduce the aggregate mortality for a disease—any disease—at a
population level was prevention. Even if other measures were chosen to
evaluate our progress against cancer, Bailar argued that it was
indubitably true that prevention, as a strategy, had been neglected by
the NCI in its ever-manic pursuit of cures.</p>
<p>A vast majority of the institute’s grants, 80 percent, were directed
toward treatment strategies for cancer; prevention research received
about 20 percent. (By 1992, this number had increased to 30 percent; of
the NCI’s billion research budget, 00 million was being spent on
prevention research.) In 1974, describing to Mary Lasker the
comprehensive activities of the NCI, the director, Frank Rauscher, wrote
effusively about its three-pronged approach to cancer: “Treatment,
Rehabilitation and Continuing Care.” That there was no mention of either
prevention or early detection was symptomatic: the institute did not
even consider cancer prevention a core strength.</p>
<p>A similarly lopsided bias existed in private research institutions.
At Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York, for instance, only one
laboratory out of nearly a hundred identified itself as having a
prevention research program in the 1970s. When one researcher surveyed a
large cohort of doctors in the early 1960s, he was surprised to learn
that “not one” was able to suggest an “idea, lead or theory on cancer
prevention.” Prevention, he noted drily, was being carried out “on a
part-time basis.” *</p>
<p>This skew of priorities, Bailar argued, was the calculated by-product
of 1950s-era science; of books, such as Garb’s Cure for Cancer, that had
forecast impossibly lofty goals; of the Laskerites’ near-hypnotic
conviction that cancer could be cured within the decade; of the steely,
insistent enthusiasm of researchers such as Farber. The vision could be
traced back to Ehrlich, ensconced in the semiotic sorcery of his
favorite phrase: “magic bullet.” Progressive, optimistic, and
rationalistic, this vision—of magic bullets and miracle cures—had
admittedly swept aside the pessimism around cancer and radically
transformed the history of oncology. But the notion of the “cure” as the
singular solution to cancer had degenerated into a sclerotic dogma.
Bailar and Smith noted, “A shift in research emphasis, from research on
treatment to research on prevention, seems necessary if substantial
progress against cancer is to be forthcoming. . . . Past disappointments
must be dealt with in an objective, straightforward and comprehensive
manner before we go much further in pursuit of a cure that always seems
just out of reach.”</p>

<li>Although this line of questioning may be intrinsically flawed since
it does not recognize the interrelatedness of preventive and therapeutic
research.</li>

<p>It should first be noted, however, that the 1960s and 1970s did not
witness so much a difficult birth of approaches to prevention that
focused on environmental and lifestyle causes of cancer, as a difficult
reinvention of an older tradition of interest in these possible
causes.</p>
