<h4 id="thirteen-mountains">Thirteen Mountains</h4>
<p>“Every sickness</p>
<p>is a musical problem,”</p>
<p>so said Novalis,</p>
<p>“and every cure</p>
<p>a musical solution.”</p>
<p>—W. H. Auden</p>
<p>The revolution in cancer research can be summed up in a single
sentence: cancer is, in essence, a genetic disease.</p>
<p>—Bert Vogelstein</p>
<p>When I began writing this book, in the early summer of 2004, I was
often asked how I intended to end it. Typically, I would dodge the
question or brush it away. I did not know, I would cautiously say. Or I
was not sure. In truth, I was sure, although I did not have the courage
to admit it to myself. I was sure that it would end with Carla’s relapse
and death.</p>
<p>I was wrong. In July 2009, exactly five years after I had looked down
the microscope into Carla’s bone marrow and confirmed her first
remission, I drove to her house in Ipswich, Massachusetts, with a
bouquet of flowers. It was an overcast morning, excruciatingly muggy,
with a dun-colored sky that threatened rain but would not deliver any.
Just before I left the hospital, I glanced quickly at the first note
that I had written on Carla’s admission to the hospital in 2004. As I
had written that note, I recalled with embarrassment, I had guessed that
Carla would not even survive the induction phase of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>But she had made it; a charring, private war had just ended. In acute
leukemia, the passage of five years without a relapse is nearly
synonymous with a cure. I handed her the azaleas and she stood looking
at them speechlessly, almost numb to the enormity of her victory. Once,
earlier this year, preoccupied with clinical work, I had waited two days
before calling her about a negative bone marrow biopsy. She had heard
from a nurse that the results were in, and my delay had sent her into a
terrifying spiral of depression: in twenty-four hours she had convinced
herself that the leukemia had crept back and my hesitation was a signal
of impending doom.</p>
<p>Oncologists and their patients are bound, it seems, by an intense
subatomic force. So, albeit in a much smaller sense, this was a victory
for me as well. I sat at Carla’s table and watched her pour a glass of
water for herself, unpurified and straight from the sink. She glowed
radiantly, her eyes half-closed, as if the compressed autobiography of
the last five years were flashing through a private and internal cinema
screen. Her children played with their Scottish terrier in the next
room, blissfully oblivious of the landmark date that had just passed for
their mother. All of this was for the best. “The purpose of my book,”
Susan Sontag concluded in Illness as Metaphor, “was to calm the
imagination, not to incite it.” So it was with my visit. Its purpose was
to declare her illness over, to normalize her life—to sever the force
that had locked us together for five years.</p>
<p>I asked Carla how she thought she had survived her nightmare. The
drive to her house from the hospital that morning had taken me an hour
and a half through a boil of heavy traffic. How had she managed, through
the long days of that dismal summer, to drive to the hospital, wait in
the room for hours as her blood tests were run, and then, told that her
blood counts were too low for her to be given chemotherapy safely, turn
back and return the next day for the same pattern to be repeated?</p>
<p>“There was no choice,” she said, motioning almost unconsciously to
the room where her children were playing. “My friends often asked me
whether I felt as if my life was somehow made abnormal by my disease. I
would tell them the same thing: for someone who is sick, this is their
new normal.”</p>
<p>Until 2003, scientists knew that the principal distinction between
the “normalcy” of a cell and the “abnormalcy” of a cancer cell lay in
the accumulation of genetic mutations—ras, myc, Rb, neu, and so
forth—that unleashed the hallmark behaviors of cancer cells. But this
description of cancer was incomplete. It provoked an inevitable
question: how many such mutations does a real cancer possess in total?
Individual oncogenes and tumor suppressors had been isolated, but what
was the comprehensive set of such mutated genes that exists in any true
human cancer?</p>
<p>The Human Genome Project, the full sequence of the normal human
genome, was completed in 2003. In its wake comes a far less publicized
but vastly more complex project: fully sequencing the genomes of several
human cancer cells. Once completed, this effort, called the Cancer
Genome Atlas, will dwarf the Human Genome Project in its scope. The
sequencing effort involves dozens of teams of researchers across the
world. The initial list of cancers to be sequenced includes brain, lung,
pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. The Human Genome Project will provide
the normal genome, against which cancer’s abnormal genome can be
juxtaposed and contrasted.</p>
<p>The result, as Francis Collins, the leader of the Human Genome
Project describes it, will be a “colossal atlas” of cancer—a compendium
of every gene mutated in the most common forms of cancer: “When applied
to the 50 most common types of cancer, this effort could ultimately
prove to be the equivalent of more than 10,000 Human Genome Projects in
terms of the sheer volume of DNA to be sequenced. The dream must
therefore be matched with an ambitious but realistic assessment of the
emerging scientific opportunities for waging a smarter war.” The only
metaphor that can appropriately describe this project is geological.
Rather than understand cancer gene by gene, the Cancer Genome Atlas will
chart the entire territory of cancer: by sequencing the entire genome of
several tumor types, every single mutated gene will be identified. It
will represent the beginnings of the comprehensive “map” so hauntingly
presaged by Maggie Jencks in her last essay.</p>
<p>Two teams have forged ahead in their efforts to sequence the cancer
genome. One, called the Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, has multiple
interconnected teams spanning several labs in several nations. The
second is Bert Vogelstein’s group at Johns Hopkins, which has assembled
its own cancer genome sequencing facility, raised private funding for
the effort, and raced ahead to sequence the genomes of breast, colon,
and pancreatic tumors. In 2006, the Vogelstein team revealed the first
landmark sequencing effort by analyzing thirteen thousand genes in
eleven breast and colon cancers. (Although the human genome contains
about twenty thousand genes in total, Vogelstein’s team initially had
tools to assess only thirteen thousand.) In 2008, both Vogelstein’s
group and the Cancer Genome Atlas consortium extended this effort by
sequencing hundreds of genes of several dozen specimens of brain tumors.
As of 2009, the genomes of ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma,
lung cancer, and several forms of leukemia have been sequenced,
revealing the full catalog of mutations in each tumor type.</p>
<p>Perhaps no one has studied the emerging cancer genome as meticulously
or as devotionally as Bert Vogelstein. A wry, lively, irreverent man in
blue jeans and a rumpled blazer, Vogelstein recently began a lecture on
the cancer genome in a packed auditorium at Mass General Hospital by
attempting to distill the enormous array of discoveries in a few slides.
Vogelstein’s challenge was that of the landscape artist: How does one
convey the gestalt of a territory (in this case, the “territory” of a
genome) in a few broad strokes of a brush? How can a picture describe
the essence of a place?</p>
<p>Vogelstein’s answer to these questions borrows beautifully from an
insight long familiar to classical landscape artists: negative space can
be used to convey expanse, while positive space conveys detail. To view
the landscape of the cancer genome panoramically, Vogelstein splayed out
the entire human genome as if it were a piece of thread zigzagging
across a square sheet of paper. (Science keeps eddying into its past:
the word mitosis—Greek for “thread”—is resonant here again.) In
Vogelstein’s diagram, the first gene on chromosome one of the human
genome occupies the top left corner of the sheet of paper, the second
gene is below it, and so forth, zigzagging through the page, until the
last gene of chromosome twenty-three occupies the bottom right corner of
the page. This is the normal, unmutated human genome stretched out in
its enormity—the “background” out of which cancer arises.</p>
<p>Against the background of this negative space, Vogelstein placed
mutations. Every time a gene mutation was encountered in a cancer, the
mutated gene was demarcated as a dot on the sheet. As the frequency of
mutations in any given gene increased, the dots grew in height into
ridges and hills and then mountains. The most commonly mutated genes in
breast cancer samples were thus represented by towering peaks, while
genes rarely mutated were denoted by small hills or flat dots.</p>
<p>Viewed thus, the cancer genome is at first glance a depressing place.
Mutations litter the chromosomes. In individual specimens of breast and
colon cancer, between fifty to eighty genes are mutated; in pancreatic
cancers, about fifty to sixty. Even brain cancers, which often develop
at earlier ages and hence may be expected to accumulate fewer mutations,
possess about forty to fifty mutated genes.</p>
<p>Only a few cancers are notable exceptions to this rule, possessing
relatively few mutations across the genome. One of these is an old
culprit, acute lymphoblastic leukemia: only five or ten genetic
alterations cross its otherwise pristine genomic landscape.* Indeed, the
relative paucity of genetic aberrancy in this leukemia may be one reason
that this tumor is so easily felled by cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Scientists speculate that genetically simple tumors (i.e., those
carrying few mutations) might inherently be more susceptible to drugs,
and thus intrinsically more curable. If so, the strange discrepancy
between the success of high-dose chemotherapy in curing leukemia and its
failure to cure most other cancers has a deep biological explanation.
The search for a “universal cure” for cancer was predicated on a tumor
that, genetically speaking, is far from universal.</p>
<p>In contrast to leukemia, the genomes of the more common forms of
cancer, Vogelstein finds, are filled with genetic bedlam—mutations piled
upon mutations upon mutations. In one breast cancer sample from a
forty-three-year-old woman, 127 genes were mutated—nearly one in every
two hundred genes in the human genome. Even within a single type of
tumor, the heterogeneity of mutations is daunting. If one compares two
breast cancer specimens, the set of mutated genes is far from identical.
“In the end,” as Vogelstein put it, “cancer genome sequencing validates
a hundred years of clinical observations. Every patient’s cancer is
unique because every cancer genome is unique. Physiological
heterogeneity is genetic heterogeneity.” Normal cells are identically
normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.</p>
<p>Yet, characteristically, where others see only daunting chaos in the
littered genetic landscape, Vogelstein sees patterns coalescing out of
the mess. Mutations in the cancer genome, he believes, come in two
forms. Some are passive. As cancer cells divide, they accumulate
mutations due to accidents in the copying of DNA, but these mutations
have no impact on the biology of cancer. They stick to the genome and
are passively carried along as the cell divides, identifiable but
inconsequential. These are “bystander” mutations or “passenger”
mutations. (“They hop along for the ride,” as Vogelstein put it.)</p>
<p>Other mutations are not passive players. Unlike the passenger
mutations, these altered genes directly goad the growth and the
biological behavior of cancer cells. These are “driver” mutations,
mutations that play a crucial role in the biology of a cancer cell.</p>
<p>Every cancer cell possesses some set of driver and passenger
mutations. In the breast cancer sample from the forty-three-year-old
woman with 127 mutations, only about ten might directly be contributing
to the actual growth and survival of her tumor, while the rest may have
been acquired due to gene-copying errors in cancer cells. But while
functionally different, these two forms of mutations cannot easily be
distinguished. Scientists can identify some driver genes that directly
goad cancer’s growth using the cancer genome. Since passenger mutations
occur randomly, they are randomly spread throughout the genome. Driver
mutations, on the other hand, strike key oncogenes and tumor
suppressors, and only a limited number of such genes exist in the
genome. These mutations—in genes such as ras, myc, and Rb—recur in
sample upon sample. They stand out as tall mountains in Vogelstein’s
map, while passenger mutations are typically represented by the valleys.
But when a mutation occurs in a previously unknown gene, it is
impossible to predict whether that mutation is consequential or
inconsequential—driver or passenger, barnacle or engine.</p>
<p>The “mountains” in the cancer genome—i.e., genes most frequently
mutated in a particular form of cancer—have another property. They can
be organized into key cancer pathways. In a recent series of studies,
Vogelstein’s team at Hopkins reanalyzed the mutations present in the
cancer genome using yet another strategy. Rather than focusing on
individual genes mutated in cancers, they enumerated the number of
pathways mutated in cancer cells. Each time a gene was mutated in any
component of the Ras-Mek-Erk pathway, it was classified as a “Ras
pathway” mutation. Similarly, if a cell carried a mutation in any
component of the Rb signaling pathway, it was classified as “Rb pathway
mutant,” and so forth, until all driver mutations had been organized
into pathways.</p>
<p>How many pathways are typically dysregulated in a cancer cell?
Typically, Vogelstein found, between eleven and fifteen, with an average
of thirteen. The mutational complexity on a gene-by-gene level was still
enormous. Any one tumor bore scores of mutations pockmarked throughout
the genome. But the same core pathways were characteristically
dysregulated in any tumor type, even if the specific genes responsible
for each broken pathway differed from one tumor to the next. Ras may be
activated in one sample of bladder cancer; Mek in another; Erk in the
third—but in each case, some vital piece of the Ras-Mek-Erk cascade was
dysregulated.</p>
<p>The bedlam of the cancer genome, in short, is deceptive. If one
listens closely, there are organizational principles. The language of
cancer is grammatical, methodical, and even—I hesitate to write—quite
beautiful. Genes talk to genes and pathways to pathways in perfect
pitch, producing a familiar yet foreign music that rolls faster and
faster into a lethal rhythm. Underneath what might seem like
overwhelming diversity is a deep genetic unity. Cancers that look vastly
unlike each other superficially often have the same or similar pathways
unhinged. “Cancer,” as one scientist recently put it, “really is a
pathway disease.”</p>
<p>This is either very good news or very bad news. The cancer pessimist
looks at the ominous number thirteen and finds himself disheartened. The
dysregulation of eleven to fifteen core pathways poses an enormous
challenge for cancer therapeutics. Will oncologists need thirteen
independent drugs to attack thirteen independent pathways to “normalize”
a cancer cell? Given the slipperiness of cancer cells, when a cell
becomes resistant to one combination of thirteen drugs, will we need an
additional thirteen?</p>
<p>The cancer optimist, however, argues that thirteen is a finite
number. It is a relief: until Vogelstein identified these core pathways,
the mutational complexity of cancers seemed nearly infinite. In fact,
the hierarchical organization of genes into pathways in any given tumor
type suggests that even deeper hierarchies might exist. Perhaps not all
thirteen need to be targeted to attack complex cancers such as breast or
pancreatic cancer. Perhaps some of the core pathways may be particularly
responsive to therapy. The best example of this might be Barbara
Bradfield’s tumor, a cancer so hypnotically addicted to Her-2 that
targeting this key oncogene melted the tumor away and forced a
decades-long remission.</p>
<p>Gene by gene, and now pathway by pathway, we have an extraordinary
glimpse into the biology of cancer. The complete maps of mutations in
many tumor types (with their hills, valleys, and mountains) will soon be
complete, and the core pathways that are mutated fully defined. But as
the old proverb runs, there are mountains beyond mountains. Once the
mutations have been identified, the mutant genes will need to be
assigned functions in cellular physiology. We will need to move through
a renewed cycle of knowledge that recapitulates a past cycle—from
anatomy to physiology to therapeutics. The sequencing of the cancer
genome represents the genetic anatomy of cancer. And just as Virchow
made the crucial leap from Vesalian anatomy to the physiology of cancer
in the nineteenth century, science must make a leap from the molecular
anatomy to the molecular physiology of cancer. We will soon know what
the mutant genes are. The real challenge is to understand what the
mutant genes do.</p>
<p>This seminal transition from descriptive biology to the functional
biology of cancer will provoke three new directions for cancer
medicine.</p>
<p>The first is a direction for cancer therapeutics. Once the crucial
driver mutations in any given cancer have been identified, we will need
to launch a hunt for targeted therapies against these genes. This is not
an entirely fantastical hope: targeted inhibitors of some of the core
thirteen pathways mutated in many cancers have already entered the
clinical realm. As individual drugs, some of these inhibitors have thus
far had only moderate response rates. The challenge now is to determine
which combinations of such drugs might inhibit cancer growth without
killing normal cells.</p>
<p>In a piece published in the New York Times in the summer of 2009,
James Watson, the codiscoverer of the structure of DNA, made a
remarkable turnabout in opinion. Testifying before Congress in 1969,
Watson had lambasted the War on Cancer as ludicrously premature. Forty
years later, he was far less critical: “We shall soon know all the
genetic changes that underlie the major cancers that plague us. We
already know most, if not all, of the major pathways through which
cancer-inducing signals move through cells. Some 20 signal-blocking
drugs are now in clinical testing after first being shown to block
cancer in mice. A few, such as Herceptin and Tarceva, have Food and Drug
Administration approval and are in widespread use.”</p>
<p>The second new direction is for cancer prevention. To date, cancer
prevention has relied on two disparate and polarized methodologies to
try to identify preventable carcinogens. There have been intensive,
often massive, human studies that have connected a particular form of
cancer with a risk factor, such as Doll and Hill’s study identifying
smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer. And there have been laboratory
studies to identify carcinogens based on their ability to cause
mutations in bacteria or incite precancer in animals and humans, such as
Bruce Ames’s experiment to capture chemical mutagens, or Marshall and
Warren’s identification of H. pylori as a cause for stomach cancer.</p>
<p>But important preventable carcinogens might escape detection by
either strategy. Subtle risk factors for cancer require enormous
population studies; the subtler the effect, the larger the population
needed. Such vast, unwieldy, and methodologically challenging studies
are difficult to fund and launch. Conversely, several important
cancer-inciting agents are not easily captured by laboratory
experiments. As Evarts Graham discovered to his dismay, even tobacco
smoke, the most common human carcinogen, does not easily induce lung
cancer in mice. Bruce Ames’s bacterial test does not register asbestos
as a mutagen.*</p>
<p>Two recent controversies have starkly highlighted such blind spots in
epidemiology. In 2000, the so-called Million Women Study in the United
Kingdom identified estrogen and progesterone, prescribed in
hormone-replacement therapy to women to ease menopausal symptoms, as
major risk factors for the incidence and fatality from estrogen-positive
breast cancer. Scientifically speaking, this is an embarrassment.
Estrogen is not identified as a mutagen in Bruce Ames’s test; nor does
it cause cancer in animals at low doses. But the two hormones have been
known as pathological activators of the ER-positive subtype of breast
cancer since the 1960s. Beatson’s surgery and tamoxifen induce
remissions in breast cancer by blocking estrogen, and so it stands to
reason that exogenous estrogen might incite breast cancer. A more
integrated approach to cancer prevention, incorporating the prior
insights of cancer biology, might have predicted this cancer-inducing
activity, preempted the need for a million-person association study, and
potentially saved the lives of thousands of women.</p>
<p>The second controversy also has its antecedents in the 1960s. Since
the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, environmental
activists have stridently argued that the indiscriminate overuse of
pesticides is partially responsible for the rising incidence of cancer
in America. This theory has spawned intense controversy, activism, and
public campaigns over the decades. But although the hypothesis is
credible, large-scale human-cohort experiments directly implicating
particular pesticides as carcinogens have emerged slowly, and animal
studies have been inconclusive. DDT and aminotriazole have been shown to
cause cancer in animals at high doses, but thousands of chemicals
proposed as carcinogens remain untested. Again, an integrated approach
is needed. The identification of key activated pathways in cancer cells
might provide a more sensitive detection method to discover carcinogens
in animal studies. A chemical may not cause overt cancer in animal
studies, but may be shown to activate cancer-linked genes and pathways,
thus shifting the burden of proof of its potential carcinogenicity.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Harvard epidemiologist David Hunter argued that the
integration of traditional epidemiology, molecular biology, and cancer
genetics will generate a resurgent form of epidemiology that is vastly
more empowered in its ability to prevent cancer. “Traditional
epidemiology,” Hunter reasoned, “is concerned with correlating exposures
with cancer outcomes, and everything between the cause (exposure) and
the outcome (a cancer) is treated as a ‘black box.’ . . . In molecular
epidemiology, the epidemiologist [will] open up the ‘black box’ by
examining the events intermediate between exposure and disease
occurrence or progression.”</p>
<p>Like cancer prevention, cancer screening will also be reinvigorated
by the molecular understanding of cancer. Indeed, it has already been.
The discovery of the BRCA genes for breast cancer epitomizes the
integration of cancer screening and cancer genetics. In the mid-1990s,
building on the prior decade’s advances, researchers isolated two
related genes, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, that vastly increase the risk of
developing breast cancer. A woman with an inherited mutation in BRCA-1
has a 50 to 80 percent chance of developing breast cancer in her
lifetime (the gene also increases the risk for ovarian cancer), about
three to five times the normal risk. Today, testing for this gene
mutation has been integrated into prevention efforts. Women found
positive for a mutation in the two genes are screened more intensively
using more sensitive imaging techniques such as breast MRI. Women with
BRCA mutations might choose to take the drug tamoxifen to prevent breast
cancer, a strategy shown effective in clinical trials. Or, perhaps most
radically, women with BRCA mutations might choose a prophylactic
mastectomy of both breasts and ovaries before cancer develops, another
strategy that dramatically decreases the chances of developing breast
cancer. An Israeli woman with a BRCA-1 mutation who chose this strategy
after developing cancer in one breast told me that at least part of her
choice was symbolic. “I am rejecting cancer from my body,” she said. “My
breasts had become no more to me than a site for my cancer. They were of
no more use to me. They harmed my body, my survival. I went to the
surgeon and asked him to remove them.”</p>
<p>The third, and arguably most complex, new direction for cancer
medicine is to integrate our understanding of aberrant genes and
pathways to explain the behavior of cancer as a whole, thereby renewing
the cycle of knowledge, discovery, and therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>One of the most provocative examples of a cancer cell’s behavior,
inexplicable by the activation of any single gene or pathway, is its
immortality. Rapid cellular proliferation, or the insensitivity to
growth-arresting signals, or tumor angiogenesis, can all largely be
explained by aberrantly activated and inactivated pathways such as ras,
Rb, or myc in cancer cells. But scientists cannot explain how cancers
continue to proliferate endlessly. Most normal cells, even rapidly
growing normal cells, will proliferate over several generations and then
exhaust their capacity to keep dividing. What allows a cancer cell to
keep dividing endlessly without exhaustion or depletion generation upon
generation?</p>
<p>An emerging, although highly controversial, answer to this question
is that cancer’s immortality, too, is borrowed from normal physiology.
The human embryo and many of our adult organs possess a tiny population
of stem cells that are capable of immortal regeneration. Stem cells are
the body’s reservoir of renewal. The entirety of human blood, for
instance, can arise from a single, highly potent blood-forming stem cell
(called a hematopoietic stem cell), which typically lives buried inside
the bone marrow. Under normal conditions, only a fraction of these
blood-forming stem cells are active; the rest are deeply
quiescent—asleep. But if blood is suddenly depleted, by injury or
chemotherapy, say, then the stem cells awaken and begin to divide with
awe-inspiring fecundity, generating cells that generate thousands upon
thousands of blood cells. In weeks, a single hematopoietic stem cell can
replenish the entire human organism with new blood—and then, through yet
unknown mechanisms, lull itself back to sleep.</p>
<p>Something akin to this process, a few researchers believe, is
constantly occurring in cancer—or at least in leukemia. In the
mid-1990s, John Dick, a Canadian biologist working in Toronto,
postulated that a small population of cells in human leukemias also
possess this infinite self-renewing behavior. These “cancer stem cells”
act as the persistent reservoir of cancer—generating and regenerating
cancer infinitely. When chemotherapy kills the bulk of cancer cells, a
small remnant population of these stem cells, thought to be
intrinsically more resistant to death, regenerate and renew the cancer,
thus precipitating the common relapses of cancer after chemotherapy.
Indeed, cancer stem cells have acquired the behavior of normal stem
cells by activating the same genes and pathways that make normal stem
cells immortal—except, unlike normal stem cells, they cannot be lulled
back into physiological sleep. Cancer, then, is quite literally trying
to emulate a regenerating organ—or perhaps, more disturbingly, the
regenerating organism. Its quest for immortality mirrors our own quest,
a quest buried in our embryos and in the renewal of our organs. Someday,
if a cancer succeeds, it will produce a far more perfect being than its
host—imbued with both immortality and the drive to proliferate. One
might argue that the leukemia cells growing in my laboratory derived
from the woman who died three decades earlier have already achieved this
form of “perfection.”</p>
<p>Taken to its logical extreme, the cancer cell’s capacity to
consistently imitate, corrupt, and pervert normal physiology thus raises
the ominous question of what “normalcy” is. “Cancer,” Carla said, “is my
new normal,” and quite possibly cancer is our normalcy as well, that we
are inherently destined to slouch towards a malignant end. Indeed, as
the fraction of those affected by cancer creeps inexorably in some
nations from one in four to one in three to one in two, cancer will,
indeed, be the new normal—an inevitability. The question then will not
be if we will encounter this immortal illness in our lives, but
when.</p>
