<h4 id="a-spiders-web">“A spider’s web”</h4>
<p>It is to earlier diagnosis that we must look for any material
improvement in our cancer cures.</p>
<p>—John Lockhart-Mummery, 1926</p>
<p>The greatest need we have today in the human cancer problem, except
for a universal cure, is a method of detecting the presence of cancer
before there are any clinical signs of symptoms.</p>
<p>—Sidney Farber, letter to Etta Rosensohn,</p>
<p>November 1962</p>
<p>Lady, have you been “Paptized”?</p>
<p>—New York Amsterdam News,</p>
<p>on Pap smears, 1957</p>
<p>The long, slow march of carcinogenesis—the methodical, step-by-step
progression of early-stage lesions of cancer into frankly malignant
cells—inspired another strategy to prevent cancer. If cancer truly
slouched to its birth, as Auerbach suspected, then perhaps one could
still intervene on that progression in its earliest stages—by attacking
precancer rather than cancer. Could one thwart the march of
carcinogenesis in midstep?</p>
<p>Few scientists had studied this early transition of cancer cells as
intensively as George Papanicolaou, a Greek cytologist at Cornell
University in New York. Robust, short, formal, and old-worldly,
Papanicolaou had trained in medicine and zoology in Athens and in Munich
and arrived in New York in 1913. Penniless off the boat, he had sought a
job in a medical laboratory but had been relegated to selling carpets at
the Gimbels store on Thirty-third Street to survive. After a few months
of truly surreal labor (he was, by all accounts, a terrible carpet
salesman), Papanicolaou secured a research position at Cornell that may
have been just as surreal as carpet selling: he was assigned to study
the menstrual cycle of guinea pigs, a species that neither bleeds
visibly nor sheds tissue during menses. Using a nasal speculum and
Q-tips, Papanicolaou had nonetheless learned to scrape off cervical
cells from guinea pigs and spread them on glass slides in thin, watery
smears.</p>
<p>The cells, he found, were like minute watch-hands. As hormones rose
and ebbed in the animals cyclically, the cells shed by the guinea pig
cervix changed their shapes and sizes cyclically as well. Using their
morphology as a guide, he could foretell the precise stage of the
menstrual cycle often down to the day.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, Papanicolaou had extended his technique to human
patients. (His wife, Maria, in surely one of the more grisly displays of
conjugal fortitude, reportedly allowed herself to be tested by cervical
smears every day.) As with guinea pigs, he found that cells sloughed off
by the human cervix could also foretell the stages of the menstrual
cycle in women.</p>
<p>But all of this, it was pointed out to him, amounted to no more than
an elaborate and somewhat useless invention. As one gynecologist archly
remarked, “in primates, including women,” a diagnostic smear was hardly
needed to calculate the stage or timing of the menstrual cycle. Women
had been timing their periods—without Papanicolaou’s cytological
help—for centuries.</p>
<p>Disheartened by these criticisms, Papanicolaou returned to his
slides. He had spent nearly a decade looking obsessively at normal
smears; perhaps, he reasoned, the real value of his test lay not in the
normal smear, but in pathological conditions. What if he could diagnose
a pathological state with his smear? What if the years of staring at
cellular normalcy had merely been a prelude to allow him to identify
cellular abnormalities?</p>
<p>Papanicolaou thus began to venture into the world of pathological
conditions, collecting slides from women with all manners of
gynecological diseases—fibroids, cysts, tubercles, inflammations of the
uterus and cervix, streptococcal, gonococcal, and staphylococcal
infections, tubal pregnancies, abnormal pregnancies, benign and
malignant tumors, abscesses and furuncles, hoping to find some
pathological mark in the exfoliated cells.</p>
<p>Cancer, he found, was particularly prone to shedding abnormal cells.
In nearly every case of cervical cancer, when Papanicolaou brushed cells
off the cervix, he found “aberrant and bizarre forms” with abnormal,
bloated nuclei, ruffled membranes, and shrunken cytoplasm that looked
nothing like normal cells. It “became readily apparent,” he wrote, that
he had stumbled on a new test for malignant cells.</p>
<p>Thrilled by his results, Papanicolaou published his method in an
article entitled “New Cancer Diagnosis” in 1928. But the report,
presented initially at an outlandish “race betterment” eugenics
conference, generated only further condescension from pathologists. The
Pap smear, as he called the technique, was neither accurate nor
particularly sensitive. If cervical cancer was to be diagnosed, his
colleagues argued, then why not perform a biopsy of the cervix, a
meticulous procedure that, even if cumbersome and invasive, was
considered far more precise and definitive than a grubby smear? At
academic conferences, experts scoffed at the crude alternative. Even
Papanicolaou could hardly argue the point. “I think this work will be
carried a little further,” he wrote self-deprecatingly at the end of his
1928 paper. Then, for nearly two decades, having produced two perfectly
useless inventions over twenty years, he virtually disappeared from the
scientific limelight.</p>
<p>Between 1928 and 1950, Papanicolaou delved back into his smears with
nearly monastic ferocity. His world involuted into a series of routines:
the daily half-hour commute to his office with Maria at the wheel; the
weekends at home in Long Island with a microscope in the study and a
microscope on the porch; evenings spent typing reports on specimens with
a phonograph playing Schubert in the background and a glass of orange
juice congealing on his table. A gynecologic pathologist named Herbert
Traut joined him to help interpret his smears. A Japanese fish and bird
painter named Hashime Murayama, a colleague from his early years at
Cornell, was hired to paint watercolors of his smears using a camera
lucida.</p>
<p>For Papanicolaou, too, this brooding, contemplative period was like a
personal camera lucida that magnified and reflected old experimental
themes onto new ones. A decades-old thought returned to haunt him: if
normal cells of the cervix changed morphologically in graded, stepwise
fashion over time, might cancer cells also change morphologically in
time, in a slow, stepwise dance from normal to malignant? Like Auerbach
(whose work was yet to be published), could he identify intermediate
stages of cancer—lesions slouching their way toward full
transformation?</p>
<p>At a Christmas party in the winter of 1950, challenged by a tipsy
young gynecologist in his lab to pinpoint the precise use of the smear,
Papanicolaou verbalized a strand of thought that he had been spinning
internally for nearly a decade. The thought almost convulsed out of him.
The real use of the Pap smear was not to find cancer, but rather to
detect its antecedent, its precursor—the portent of cancer.</p>
<p>“It was a revelation,” one of his students recalled. “A Pap smear
would give a woman a chance to receive preventive care [and] greatly
decrease the likelihood of her ever developing cancer.” Cervical cancer
typically arises in an outer layer of the cervix, then grows in a flaky,
superficial whirl before burrowing inward into the surrounding tissues.
By sampling asymptomatic women, Papanicolaou speculated that his test,
albeit imperfect, might capture the disease at its first stages. He
would, in essence, push the diagnostic clock backward—from incurable,
invasive cancers to curable, preinvasive malignancies.</p>
<p>In 1952, Papanicolaou convinced the National Cancer Institute to
launch the largest clinical trial of secondary prevention in the history
of cancer using his smearing technique. Nearly every adult female
resident of Shelby County, Tennessee—150,000 women spread across eight
hundred square miles—was tested with a Pap smear and followed over time.
Smears poured in from hundreds of sites: from one-room doctor’s offices
dotted among the horse farms of Germantown to large urban community
clinics scattered throughout the city of Memphis. Temporary “Pap
clinics” were set up in factories and office buildings. Once collected,
the samples were funneled into a gigantic microscope facility at the
University of Tennessee, where framed photographs of exemplary normal
and abnormal smears had been hung on the walls. Technicians read slides
day and night, looking up from the microscopes at the pictures. At the
peak, nearly a thousand smears were read every day.</p>
<p>As expected, the Shelby team found its fair share of advanced
cancerous lesions in the population. In the initial cohort of about
150,000, invasive cervical cancer was found in 555 women. But the real
proof of Papanicolaou’s principle lay in another discovery:
astonishingly, 557 women were found to have preinvasive cancers or even
precancerous changes—early-stage, localized lesions curable by
relatively simple surgical procedures. Nearly all these women were
asymptomatic; had they never been tested, they would never have been
suspected of harboring preinvasive lesions. Notably, the average age of
diagnosis of women with such preinvasive lesions was about twenty years
lower than the average age of women with invasive lesions—once again
corroborating the long march of carcinogenesis. The Pap smear had, in
effect, pushed the clock of cancer detection forward by nearly two
decades, and changed the spectrum of cervical cancer from predominantly
incurable to predominantly curable.</p>
<p>A few miles from Papanicolaou’s laboratory in New York, the core
logic of the Pap smear was being extended to a very different form of
cancer. Epidemiologists think about prevention in two forms. In primary
prevention, a disease is prevented by attacking its cause—smoking
cessation for lung cancer or a vaccine against hepatitis B for liver
cancer. In secondary prevention (also called screening), a disease is
prevented by screening for its early, presymptomatic stage. The Pap
smear was invented as a means of secondary prevention for cervical
cancer. But if a microscope could detect a presymptomatic state in
scraped-off cervical tissue, then could another means of “seeing” cancer
detect an early lesion in another cancer-afflicted organ?</p>
<p>In 1913, a Berlin surgeon named Albert Salomon had certainly tried. A
dogged, relentless champion of the mastectomy, Salomon had whisked away
nearly three thousand amputated breasts after mastectomies to an X-ray
room where he had photographed them after surgery to detect the shadowy
outlines of cancer. Salomon had detected stigmata of cancer in his
X-rays—microscopic sprinkles of calcium lodged in cancer tissue (“grains
of salt,” as later radiologists would call them) or thin crustacean
fingerlings of malignant cells reminiscent of the root of the word
cancer.</p>
<p>The next natural step might have been to image breasts before surgery
as a screening method, but Salomon’s studies were rudely interrupted.
Abruptly purged from his university position by the Nazis in the
mid-1930s, Salomon escaped the camps to Amsterdam and vanished
underground—and so, too, did his shadowy X-rays of breasts. Mammography,
as Salomon called his technique, languished in neglect. It was hardly
missed: in a world obsessed with radical surgery, since small or large
masses in the breast were treated with precisely the same gargantuan
operation, screening for small lesions made little sense.</p>
<p>For nearly two decades, the mammogram thus lurked about in the far
peripheries of medicine—in France and England and Uruguay, places where
radical surgery held the least influence. But by the mid-1960s, with
Halsted’s theory teetering uneasily on its pedestal, mammography
reentered X-ray clinics in America, championed by pioneering
radiographers such as Robert Egan in Houston. Egan, like Papanicolaou,
cast himself more as an immaculate craftsman than a scientist—a
photographer, really, who was taking photographs of cancer using X-rays,
the most penetrating form of light. He tinkered with films, angles,
positions, and exposures, until, as one observer put it, “trabeculae as
thin as a spider’s web” in the breast could be seen in the images.</p>
<p>But could cancer be caught in that “spider’s web” of shadows, trapped
early enough to prevent its spread? Egan’s mammograms could now detect
tumors as small as a few millimeters, about the size of a grain of
barley. But would screening women to detect such early tumors and
extricating the tumors surgically save lives?</p>
<p>Screening trials in cancer are among the most slippery of all
clinical trials—notoriously difficult to run, and notoriously
susceptible to errors. To understand why, consider the odyssey from the
laboratory to the clinic of a screening test for cancer. Suppose a new
test has been invented in the laboratory to detect an early,
presymptomatic stage of a particular form of cancer, say, the level of a
protein secreted by cancer cells into the serum. The first challenge for
such a test is technical: its performance in the real world.
Epidemiologists think of screening tests as possessing two
characteristic performance errors. The first error is overdiagnosis—when
an individual tests positive in the test but does not have cancer. Such
individuals are called “false positives.” Men and women who falsely test
positive find themselves trapped in the punitive stigma of cancer, the
familiar cycle of anxiety and terror (and the desire to “do something”)
that precipitates further testing and invasive treatment.</p>
<p>The mirror image of overdiagnosis is underdiagnosis—an error in which
a patient truly has cancer but does not test positive for it.
Underdiagnosis falsely reassures patients of their freedom from disease.
These men and women (“false negatives” in the jargon of epidemiology)
enter a different punitive cycle—of despair, shock, and betrayal—once
their disease, undetected by the screening test, is eventually uncovered
when it becomes symptomatic.</p>
<p>The trouble is that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis are often
intrinsically conjoined, locked perpetually on two ends of a seesaw.
Screening tests that strive to limit overdiagnosis—by narrowing the
criteria by which patients are classified as positive—often pay the
price of increasing underdiagnosis because they miss patients that lie
in the gray zone between positive and negative. An example helps to
illustrate this trade-off. Suppose—to use Egan’s vivid metaphor—a spider
is trying to invent a perfect web to capture flies out of the air.
Increasing the density of that web, she finds, certainly increases the
chances of catching real flies (true positives) but it also increases
the chances of capturing junk and debris floating through the air (false
positives). Making the web less dense, in contrast, decreases the
chances of catching real prey, but every time something is captured,
chances are higher that it is a fly. In cancer, where both overdiagnosis
and underdiagnosis come at high costs, finding that exquisite balance is
often impossible. We want every cancer test to operate with perfect
specificity and sensitivity. But the technologies for screening are not
perfect. Screening tests thus routinely fail because they cannot even
cross this preliminary hurdle—the rate of over- or underdiagnosis is
unacceptably high.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, our new test does survive this crucial bottleneck.
The rates of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis are deemed acceptable, and
we unveil the test on a population of eager volunteers. Suppose,
moreover, that as the test enters the public domain, doctors immediately
begin to detect early, benign-appearing, premalignant lesions—in stark
contrast to the aggressive, fast-growing tumors seen before the test. Is
the test to be judged a success?</p>
<p>No; merely detecting a small tumor is not sufficient. Cancer
demonstrates a spectrum of behavior. Some tumors are inherently benign,
genetically determined to never reach the fully malignant state; and
some tumors are intrinsically aggressive, and intervention at even an
early, presymptomatic stage might make no difference to the prognosis of
a patient. To address the inherent behavioral heterogeneity of cancer,
the screening test must go further. It must increase survival.</p>
<p>Imagine, now, that we have designed a trial to determine whether our
screening test increases survival. Two identical twins, call them Hope
and Prudence, live in neighboring houses and are offered the trial. Hope
chooses to be screened by the test. Prudence, suspicious of
overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, refuses to be screened.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Hope and Prudence, identical forms of cancer develop
in both twins at the exact same time—in 1990. Hope’s tumor is detected
by the screening test in 1995, and she undergoes surgical treatment and
chemotherapy. She survives five additional years, then relapses and dies
ten years after her original diagnosis, in 2000. Prudence, in contrast,
detects her tumor only when she feels a growing lump in her breast in
1999. She, too, has treatment, with some marginal benefit, then relapses
and dies at the same moment as Hope in 2000.</p>
<p>At the joint funeral, as the mourners stream by the identical
caskets, an argument breaks out among Hope’s and Prudence’s doctors.
Hope’s physicians insist that she had a five-year survival: her tumor
was detected in 1995 and she died in 2000. Prudence’s doctors insist
that her survival was one year: Prudence’s tumor was detected in 1999
and she died in 2000. Yet both cannot be right: the twins died from the
same tumor at the exact same time. The solution to this seeming
paradox—called lead-time bias—is immediately obvious. Using survival as
an end point for a screening test is flawed because early detection
pushes the clock of diagnosis backward. Hope’s tumor and Prudence’s
tumor possess exactly identical biological behavior. But since doctors
detected Hope’s tumor earlier, it seems, falsely, that she lived longer
and that the screening test was beneficial.</p>
<p>So our test must now cross an additional hurdle: it must improve
mortality, not survival. The only appropriate way to judge whether
Hope’s test was truly beneficial is to ask whether Hope lived longer
regardless of the time of her diagnosis. Had Hope lived until 2010
(outliving Prudence by a decade), we could have legitimately ascribed a
benefit to the test. Since both women died at the exact same moment, we
now discover that screening produced no benefit.</p>
<p>A screening test’s path to success is thus surprisingly long and
narrow. It must avoid the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis.
It must steer past the narrow temptation to use early detection as an
end in itself. Then, it must navigate the treacherous straits of bias
and selection. “Survival,” seductively simple, cannot be its end point.
And adequate randomization at each step is critical. Only a test capable
of meeting all these criteria—proving mortality benefit in a genuinely
randomized setting with an acceptable over- and underdiagnosis rate—can
be judged a success. With the odds stacked so steeply, few tests are
powerful enough to withstand this level of scrutiny and truly provide
benefit in cancer.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1963, three men set out to test whether screening a
large cohort of asymptomatic women using mammography would prevent
mortality from breast cancer. All three, outcasts from their respective
fields, were seeking new ways to study breast cancer. Louis Venet, a
surgeon trained in the classical tradition, wanted to capture early
cancers as a means to avert the large and disfiguring radical surgeries
that had become the norm in the field. Sam Shapiro, a statistician,
sought to invent new methods to mount statistical trials. And Philip
Strax, a New York internist, had perhaps the most poignant of reasons:
he had nursed his wife through the torturous terminal stages of breast
cancer in the mid-1950s. Strax’s attempt to capture preinvasive lesions
using X-rays was a personal crusade to unwind the biological clock that
had ultimately taken his wife’s life.</p>
<p>Venet, Strax, and Shapiro were sophisticated clinical trialists:
right at the onset, they realized that they would need a randomized,
prospective trial using mortality as an end point to test mammography.
Methodologically speaking, their trial would recapitulate Doll and
Hill’s famous smoking trial of the 1950s. But how might such a trial be
logistically run? The Doll and Hill study had been the fortuitous
by-product of the nationalization of health care in Great Britain—its
stable cohort produced, in large part, by the National Health Service’s
“address book” of registered doctors across the United Kingdom. For
mammography, in contrast, it was the sweeping wave of privatization in
postwar America that provided the opportunity to run the trial. In the
summer of 1944, lawmakers in New York unveiled a novel program to
provide subscriber-based health insurance to groups of employees in New
York. This program, called the Health Insurance Plan (HIP), was the
ancestor of the modern HMO.</p>
<p>The HIP filled a great void in insurance. By the mid-1950s, a triad
of forces—immigration, World War II, and the Depression—had brought
women out of their homes to comprise nearly one-third of the total
workforce in New York. These working women sought health insurance, and
the HIP, which allowed its enrollees to pool risks and thereby reduce
costs, was a natural solution. By the early 1960s, the plan had enrolled
more than three hundred thousand subscribers spread across thirty-one
medical groups in New York—nearly eighty thousand of them women.</p>
<p>Strax, Shapiro, and Venet were quick to identify the importance of
the resource: here was a defined—“captive”—cohort of women spread across
New York and its suburbs that could be screened and followed over a
prolonged time. The trial was kept deliberately simple: women enrollees
in the HIP between the ages of forty and sixty-four were divided into
two groups. One group was screened with mammography while the other was
left unscreened. The ethical standards for screening trials in the 1960s
made the identification of the groups even simpler. The unscreened
group—i.e., the one not offered mammography—was not even required to
give consent; it could just be enrolled passively in the trial and
followed over time.</p>
<p>The trial, launched in December 1963, was instantly a logistic
nightmare. Mammography was cumbersome: a machine the size of a
full-grown bull; photographic plates like small windowpanes; the slosh
and froth of toxic chemicals in a darkroom. The technique was best
performed in dedicated X-ray clinics, but unable to convince women to
travel to these clinics (many of them located uptown), Strax and Venet
eventually outfitted a mobile van with an X-ray machine and parked it in
midtown Manhattan, alongside the ice-cream trucks and sandwich vendors,
to recruit women into the study during lunch breaks.*</p>
<p>Strax began an obsessive campaign of recruitment. When a subject
refused to join the study, he would call, write, and call her again to
persuade her to join. The clinics were honed to a machinelike precision
to allow thousands of women to be screened in a day:</p>
<p>“Interview . . . 5 stations X 12 women per hour = 60 women. . . .
Undress-Dress cubicles: 16 cubicles X 6 women per hour = 96 women per
hour. Each cubicle provides one square of floor space for dress-undress
and contains four clothes lockers for a total of 64. At the close of the
‘circle,’ the woman enters the same cubicle to obtain her clothes and
dress. . . . To expedite turnover, the amenities of chairs and mirrors
are omitted.”</p>
<p>Curtains rose and fell. Closets opened and closed. Chairless and
mirrorless rooms let women in and out. The merry-go-round ran through
the day and late into the evening. In an astonishing span of six years,
the trio completed a screening that would ordinarily have taken two
decades to complete.</p>
<p>If a tumor was detected by mammography, the woman was treated
according to the conventional intervention available at the
time—surgery, typically a radical mastectomy, to remove the mass (or
surgery followed by radiation). Once the cycle of screening and
intervention had been completed, Strax, Venet, and Shapiro could watch
the experiment unfold over time by measuring breast cancer mortality in
the screened versus unscreened groups.</p>
<p>In 1971, eight years after the study had been launched, Strax, Venet,
and Shapiro revealed the initial findings of the HIP trial. At first
glance, it seemed like a resounding vindication of screening. Sixty-two
thousand women had been enrolled in the trial; about half had been
screened by mammography. There had been thirty-one deaths in the
mammography-screened group and fifty-two deaths in the control group.
The absolute number of lives saved was admittedly modest, but the
fractional reduction in mortality from screening—almost 40 percent—was
remarkable. Strax was ecstatic: “The radiologist,” he wrote, “has become
a potential savior of women—and their breasts.”</p>
<p>The positive results of the HIP trial had an explosive effect on
mammography. “Within 5 years, mammography has moved from the realm of a
discarded procedure to the threshold of widespread application,” a
radiologist wrote. At the National Cancer Institute, enthusiasm for
screening rose swiftly to a crescendo. Arthur Holleb, the American
Cancer Society’s chief medical officer, was quick to note the parallel
to the Pap smear. “The time has come,” Holleb announced in 1971, “for
the . . . Society to mount a massive program on mammography just as we
did with the Pap test. . . . No longer can we ask the people of this
country to tolerate a loss of life from breast cancer each year equal to
the loss of life in the past ten years in Viet Nam. The time has come
for greater national effort. I firmly believe that time is now.”</p>
<p>The ACS’s massive campaign was called the Breast Cancer Detection and
Demonstration Project (BCDDP). Notably, this was not a trial but, as its
name suggested, a “demonstration.” There was no treatment or control
group. The project intended to screen nearly 250,000 women in a single
year, nearly eight times the number screened by Strax in three years, in
large part to show that it was possible to muscle through mammographic
screening at a national level. Mary Lasker backed it strongly, as did
virtually every cancer organization in America. Mammography, the
“discarded procedure,” was about to become enshrined in the
mainstream.</p>
<p>But even as the BCDDP forged ahead, doubts were gathering over the
HIP study. Shapiro, recall, had chosen to randomize the trial by placing
the “test women” and “control” women into two groups and comparing
mortality. But, as was common practice in the sixties, the control group
had not been informed of its participation in a trial. It had been a
virtual group—a cohort drawn out of the HIP’s records. When a woman had
died of breast cancer in the control group, Strax and Shapiro had
dutifully updated their ledgers, but—trees falling in statistical
forests—the group had been treated as an abstract entity, unaware even
of its own existence.</p>
<p>In principle, comparing a virtual group to a real group would have
been perfectly fine. But as the trial enrollment had proceeded in the
mid-1960s, Strax and Shapiro had begun to worry whether some women
already diagnosed with breast cancer might have entered the trial. A
screening examination would, of course, be a useless test for such women
since they already carried the disease. To correct for this, Shapiro had
begun to selectively remove such women from both arms of the trial.</p>
<p>Removing such subjects from the mammography test group was relatively
easy: the radiologist could simply ask a woman about her prior history
before she underwent mammography. But since the control group was a
virtual entity, there could be no virtual asking. It would have to be
culled “virtually.” Shapiro tried to be dispassionate and rigorous by
pulling equal numbers of women from the two arms of the trial. But in
the end, he may have chosen selectively. Possibly, he overcorrected:
more patients with prior breast cancer were eliminated from the screened
group. The difference was small—only 434 patients in a trial of
30,000—but statistically speaking, fatal. Critics now charged that the
excess mortality in the unscreened group was an artifact of the culling.
The unscreened group had been mistakenly overloaded with more patients
with prior breast cancer—and the excess death in the untreated group was
merely a statistical artifact.</p>
<p>Mammography enthusiasts were devastated. What was needed, they
admitted, was a fair reevaluation, a retrial. But where might such a
trial be performed? Certainly not in the United States—with two hundred
thousand women already enrolled in the BCDDP (and therefore not eligible
for another trial), and its bickering academic community shadowboxing
over the interpretation of shadows. Scrambling blindly out of
controversy, the entire community of mammographers overcompensated as
well. Rather than build experiments methodically on other experiments,
they launched a volley of parallel trials that came tumbling out over
each other. Between 1976 and 1992, enormous parallel trials of
mammography were launched in Europe: in Edinburgh, Scotland, and in
several sites in Sweden—Malmö, Kopparberg, Östergötland, Stockholm, and
Göteborg. In Canada, meanwhile, researchers lurched off on their own
randomized trial of mammography, called the National Breast Screening
Study (CNBSS). As with so much in the history of breast cancer,
mammographic trial-running had turned into an arms race, with each group
trying to better the efforts of the others.</p>
<p>Edinburgh was a disaster. Balkanized into hundreds of isolated and
disconnected medical practices, it was a terrible trial site to begin
with. Doctors assigned blocks of women to the screening or control
groups based on seemingly arbitrary criteria. Or, worse still, women
assigned themselves. Randomization protocols were disrupted. Women often
switched between one group and the other as the trial proceeded,
paralyzing and confounding any meaningful interpretation of the study as
a whole.</p>
<p>The Canadian trial, meanwhile, epitomized precision and attention to
detail. In the summer of 1980, a heavily publicized national campaign
involving letters, advertisements, and personal phone calls was launched
to recruit thirty-nine thousand women to fifteen accredited centers for
screening mammography. When a woman presented herself at any such
center, she was asked some preliminary questions by a receptionist,
asked to fill out a questionnaire, then examined by a nurse or
physician, after which her name was entered into an open ledger. The
ledger—a blue-lined notebook was used in most clinics—circulated freely.
Randomized assignment was thus achieved by alternating lines in that
notebook. One woman was assigned to the screened group, the woman on the
next line to the control group, the third line to the screened, the
fourth to the control, and so forth.</p>
<p>Note carefully that sequence of events: a woman was typically
randomized after her medical history and examination. That sequence was
neither anticipated nor prescribed in the original protocol (detailed
manuals of instruction had been sent to each center). But that minute
change completely undid the trial. The allocations that emerged after
those nurse interviews were no longer random. Women with abnormal breast
or lymph node examinations were disproportionately assigned to the
mammography group (seventeen to the mammography group; five to the
control arm, at one site). So were women with prior histories of breast
cancer. So, too, were women known to be at “high risk” based on their
past history or prior insurance claims (eight to mammography; one to
control).</p>
<p>The reasons for this skew are still unknown. Did the nurses allocate
high-risk women to the mammography group to confirm a suspicious
clinical examination—to obtain a second opinion, as it were, by X-ray?
Was that subversion even conscious? Was it an unintended act of
compassion, an attempt to help high-risk women by forcing them to have
mammograms? Did high-risk women skip their turn in the waiting room to
purposefully fall into the right line of the allocation book? Were they
instructed to do so by the trial coordinators—by their examining
doctors, the X-ray technicians, the receptionists?</p>
<p>Teams of epidemiologists, statisticians, radiologists, and at least
one group of forensic experts have since pored over those scratchy
notebooks to try to answer these questions and decipher what went wrong
in the trial. “Suspicion, like beauty, lies in the eye of the beholder,”
one of the trial’s chief investigators countered. But there was plenty
to raise suspicion. The notebooks were pockmarked with clerical errors:
names changed, identities reversed, lines whited out, names replaced or
overwritten. Testimonies by on-site workers reinforced these
observations. At one center, a trial coordinator selectively herded her
friends to the mammography group (hoping, presumably, to do them a favor
and save their lives). At another, a technician reported widespread
tampering with randomization with women being “steered” into groups.
Accusations and counteraccusations flew through the pages of academic
journals. “One lesson is clear,” the cancer researcher Norman Boyd wrote
dismissively in a summary editorial: “randomization in clinical trials
should be managed in a manner that makes subversion impossible.”</p>
<p>But such smarting lessons aside, little else was clear. What emerged
from that fog of details was a study even more imbalanced than the HIP
study. Strax and Shapiro had faltered by selectively depleting the
mammography group of high-risk patients. The CNBSS faltered, skeptics
now charged, by succumbing to the opposite sin: by selectively enriching
the mammography group with high-risk women. Unsurprisingly, the result
of the CNBSS was markedly negative: if anything, more women died of
breast cancer in the mammography group than in the unscreened group.</p>
<p>It was in Sweden, at long last, that this stuttering legacy finally
came to an end. In the winter of 2007, I visited Malmö, the site for one
of the Swedish mammography trials launched in the late 1970s. Perched
almost on the southern tip of the Swedish peninsula, Malmö is a bland,
gray-blue industrial town set amid a featureless, gray-blue landscape.
The bare, sprawling flatlands of Skåne stretch out to its north, and the
waters of the Øresund strait roll to the south. Battered by a steep
recession in the mid-1970s, the region had economically and
demographically frozen for nearly two decades. Migration into and out of
the city had shrunk to an astonishingly low 2 percent for nearly twenty
years. Malmö had been in limbo with a captive cohort of men and women.
It was the ideal place to run a difficult trial.</p>
<p>In 1976, forty-two thousand women enrolled in the Malmö Mammography
Study. Half the cohort (about twenty-one thousand women) was screened
yearly at a small clinic outside the Malmö General Hospital, and the
other half not screened—and the two groups have been followed closely
ever since. The experiment ran like clockwork. “There was only one
breast clinic in all of Malmö—unusual for a city of this size,” the lead
researcher, Ingvar Andersson, recalled. “All the women were screened at
the same clinic year after year, resulting in a highly consistent,
controlled study—the most stringent study that could be produced.”</p>
<p>In 1988, at the end of its twelfth year, the Malmö study reported its
results. Overall, 588 women had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the
screened group, and 447 in the control group—underscoring, once again,
the capacity of mammography to detect early cancers. But notably, at
least at first glance, early detection had not translated into
overwhelming numbers of lives saved. One hundred and twenty-nine women
had died of breast cancer—sixty-three in the screened and sixty-six in
the unscreened—with no statistically discernible difference overall.</p>
<p>But there was a pattern behind the deaths. When the groups were
analyzed by age, women above fifty-five years had benefited from
screening, with a reduction in breast cancer deaths by 20 percent. In
younger women, in contrast, screening with mammography showed no
detectable benefit.</p>
<p>This pattern—a clearly discernible benefit for older women, and a
barely detectable benefit in younger women—would be confirmed in scores
of studies that followed Malmö. In 2002, twenty-six years after the
launch of the original Malmö experiment, an exhaustive analysis
combining all the Swedish studies was published in the Lancet. In all,
247,000 women had been enrolled in these trials. The pooled analysis
vindicated the Malmö results. In aggregate, over the course of fifteen
years, mammography had resulted in 20 to 30 percent reductions in breast
cancer mortality for women aged fifty-five to seventy. But for women
below fifty-five, the benefit was barely discernible.</p>
<p>Mammography, in short, was not going to be the unequivocal “savior”
of all women with breast cancer. Its effects, as the statistician Donald
Berry describes it, “are indisputable for a certain segment of women—but
also indisputably modest in that segment.” Berry wrote, “Screening is a
lottery. Any winnings are shared by the minority of women. . . . The
overwhelming proportion of women experience no benefit and they pay with
the time involved and the risks associated with screening. . . . The
risk of not having a mammogram until after age 50 is about the same as
riding a bicycle for 15 hours without a helmet.” If all women across the
nation chose to ride helmetless for fifteen hours straight, there would
surely be several more deaths than if they had all worn helmets. But for
an individual woman who rides her bicycle helmetless to the corner
grocery store once a week, the risk is so minor that some would dismiss
it outright.</p>
<p>In Malmö, at least, this nuanced message has yet to sink in. Many
women from the original mammographic cohort have died (of various
causes), but mammography, as one Malmö resident described it, “is
somewhat of a religion here.” On the windy winter morning that I stood
outside the clinic, scores of women—some over fifty-five and some
obviously younger—came in religiously for their annual X-rays. The
clinic, I suspect, still ran with the same efficiency and diligence that
had allowed it, after disastrous attempts in other cities, to rigorously
complete one of the most seminal and difficult trials in the history of
cancer prevention. Patients streamed in and out effortlessly, almost as
if running an afternoon errand. Many of them rode off on their
bicycles—oblivious of Berry’s warnings—without helmets.</p>
<p>Why did a simple, reproducible, inexpensive, easily learned
technique—an X-ray image to detect the shadow of a small tumor in the
breast—have to struggle for five decades and through nine trials before
any benefit could be ascribed to it?</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in the complexity of running early-detection
trials, which are inherently slippery, contentious, and prone to error.
Edinburgh was undone by flawed randomization; the BCDDP by
nonrandomization. Shapiro’s trial was foiled by a faulty desire to be
dispassionate; the Canadian trial by a flawed impulse to be
compassionate.</p>
<p>Part of the answer lies also in the old conundrum of over- and
underdiagnosis—although with an important twist. A mammogram, it turns
out, is not a particularly good tool for detecting early breast cancer.
Its false-positive and false-negative rates make it far from an ideal
screening test. But the fatal flaw in mammography lies in that these
rates are not absolute: they depend on age. For women above fifty-five,
the incidence of breast cancer is high enough that even a relatively
poor screening tool can detect an early tumor and provide a survival
benefit. For women between forty and fifty years, though, the incidence
of breast cancer sinks to a point that a “mass” detected on a mammogram,
more often than not, turns out to be a false positive. To use a visual
analogy: a magnifying lens designed to make small script legible does
perfectly well when the font size is ten or even six points. But then it
hits a limit. At a certain size font, chances of reading a letter
correctly become about the same as reading a letter incorrectly. In
women above fifty-five, where the “font size” of breast cancer incidence
is large enough, a mammogram performs adequately. But in women between
forty and fifty, the mammogram begins to squint at an uncomfortable
threshold—exceeding its inherent capacity to become a discriminating
test. No matter how intensively we test mammography in this group of
women, it will always be a poor screening tool.</p>
<p>But the last part of the answer lies, surely, in how we imagine
cancer and screening. We are a visual species. Seeing is believing, and
to see cancer in its early, incipient form, we believe, must be the best
way to prevent it. As the writer Malcolm Gladwell once described it,
“This is a textbook example of how the battle against cancer is supposed
to work. Use a powerful camera. Take a detailed picture. Spot the tumor
as early as possible. Treat it immediately and aggressively. . . . The
danger posed by a tumor is represented visually. Large is bad; small is
better.”</p>
<p>But powerful as the camera might be, cancer confounds this simple
rule. Since metastasis is what kills patients with breast cancer, it is,
of course, generally true that the ability to detect and remove
premetastatic tumors saves women’s lives. But it is also true that just
because a tumor is small does not mean that it is premetastatic. Even
relatively small tumors barely detectable by mammography can carry
genetic programs that make them vastly more likely to metastasize early.
Conversely, large tumors may inherently be genetically benign—unlikely
to invade and metastasize. Size matters, in other words—but only to a
point. The difference in the behavior of tumors is not just a
consequence of quantitative growth, but of qualitative growth.</p>
<p>A static picture cannot capture this qualitative growth. Seeing a
“small” tumor and extracting it from the body does not guarantee our
freedom from cancer—a fact that we still struggle to believe. In the
end, a mammogram or a Pap smear is a portrait of cancer in its infancy.
Like any portrait, it is drawn in the hopes that it might capture
something essential about the subject—its psyche, its inner being, its
future, its behavior. “All photographs are accurate,” the artist Richard
Avedon liked to say, “[but] none of them is the truth.”</p>
<p>But if the “truth” of every cancer is imprinted in its behavior, then
how might one capture this mysterious quality? How could scientists make
that crucial transition between simply visualizing cancer and knowing
its malignant potential, its vulnerabilities, its patterns of spread—its
future?</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, the entire discipline of cancer prevention
appeared to have stalled at this critical juncture. The missing element
in the puzzle was a deeper understanding of carcinogenesis—a mechanistic
understanding that would explain the means by which normal cells become
cancer cells. Chronic inflammation with hepatitis B virus and H. pylori
initiated the march of carcinogenesis, but by what route? The Ames test
proved that mutagenicity was linked to carcinogenicity, but mutations in
which genes, and by what mechanism?</p>
<p>And if such mutations were known, could they be used to launch more
intelligent efforts to prevent cancer? Instead of running larger trials
of mammography, for instance, could one run smarter trials of
mammography—by risk-stratifying women (identifying those with
predisposing mutations for breast cancer) such that high-risk women
received higher levels of surveillance? Would that strategy, coupled
with better technology, capture the identity of cancer more accurately
than a simple, static portrait?</p>
<p>Cancer therapeutics, too, had seemingly arrived at the same
bottleneck. Huggins and Walpole had shown that knowing the inner
machinery of the cancer cell could reveal unique vulnerabilities. But
the discovery had to come from the bottom up—from the cancer cell to its
therapy. “As the decade ended,” Bruce Chabner, former director of the
NCI’s Division of Cancer Treatment, recalled, “it was as if the whole
discipline of oncology, both prevention and cure, had bumped up against
a fundamental limitation of knowledge. We were trying to combat cancer
without understanding the cancer cell, which was like launching rockets
without understanding the internal combustion engine.”</p>
<p>But others disagreed. With screening tests still faltering, with
carcinogens still at large, and with the mechanistic understanding of
cancer in its infancy, the impatience to deploy a large-scale
therapeutic attack on cancer grew to its bristling tipping point. A
chemotherapeutic poison was a poison was a poison, and one did not need
to understand a cancer cell to poison it. So, just as a generation of
radical surgeons had once shuttered the blinds around itself and pushed
the discipline to its terrifying limits, so, too, did a generation of
radical chemotherapists. If every dividing cell in the body needed to be
obliterated to rid it of cancer, then so be it. It was a conviction that
would draw oncology into its darkest hour.</p>
