<h4 id="the-butcher-shop">“The butcher shop”</h4>
<p>Randomised screening trials are bothersome. It takes ages to come to
an answer, and these need to be large-scale projects to be able to
answer the questions. [But . . .] there is no second-best option.</p>
<p>—H. J. de Koning,</p>
<p>Annals of Oncology, 2003</p>
<p>The best [doctors] seem to have a sixth sense about disease. They
feel its presence, know it to be there, perceive its gravity before any
intellectual process can define, catalog, and put it into words.
Patients sense this about such a physician as well: that he is
attentive, alert, ready; that he cares. No student of medicine should
miss observing such an encounter. Of all the moments in medicine, this
one is most filled with drama, with feeling, with history.</p>
<p>—Michael LaCombe,</p>
<p>Annals of Internal Medicine, 1993</p>
<p>It was in Bethesda, at the very institute that had been likened to a
suburban golfing club in the 1940s, that the new arsenal of oncology was
deployed on living patients.</p>
<p>In April 1955, in the midst of a humid spring in Maryland, a freshly
recruited researcher at the National Cancer Institute named Emil
Freireich walked up to his new office in the redbrick Clinical Center
Building and found, to his exasperation, that his name had been
misspelled on the door, with the last five letters lopped off. The plate
on the door read EMIL FREI, MD. “My first thought, of course, was: Isn’t
it typical of the government?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a misspelling. When Freireich entered the office, he
confronted a tall, thin young man who identified himself as Emil Frei.
Freireich’s office, with the name correctly spelled, was next door.</p>
<p>Their names notwithstanding, the two Emils were vastly different
characters. Freireich—just thirty-five years old and fresh out of a
hematology fellowship at Boston University—was flamboyant, hot-tempered,
and adventurous. He spoke quickly, often explosively, with a booming
voice followed often by an even more expressive boom of laughter. He had
been a medical intern at the fast-paced “Ward 55” of the Cook County
Hospital in Chicago—and such a nuisance to the authorities that he had
been released from his contract earlier than usual. In Boston, Freireich
had worked with Chester Keefer, one of Minot’s colleagues who had
subsequently spearheaded the production of penicillin during World War
II. Antibiotics, folic acid, vitamins, and antifolates were stitched
into Freireich’s soul. He admired Farber intensely—not just the
meticulous, academic scientist, but the irreverent, impulsive,
larger-than-life Farber who could antagonize his enemies as quickly as
he could seduce his benefactors. “I have never seen Freireich in a
moderate mood,” Frei would later say.</p>
<p>If Freireich had been a character in a film, he would have needed a
cinematic foil, a Laurel to his Hardy or a Felix to his Oscar. The tall,
thin man who confronted him at the door at the NCI that afternoon was
that foil. Where Freireich was brusque and flamboyant, impulsive to a
fault, and passionate about every detail, Frei was cool, composed, and
cautious, a poised negotiator who preferred to work backstage. Emil
Frei—known to most of his colleagues by his nickname, Tom—had been an
art student in St. Louis in the thirties. He had attended medical school
almost as an afterthought in the late 1940s, served in the navy in the
Korean War, and returned to St. Louis as a resident in medicine. He was
charming, soft-spoken, and careful—a man of few, chosen words. To watch
him manage critically ill children and their testy, nervous parents was
to watch a champion swimmer glide through water—so adept in the art that
he made artistry vanish.</p>
<p>The person responsible for bringing the two Emils to Bethesda was
Gordon Zubrod, the new director of the NCI’s Clinical Center.
Intellectual, deliberate, and imposing, a clinician and scientist known
for his regal composure, Zubrod had arrived at the NIH having spent
nearly a decade developing antimalaria drugs during World War II, an
experience that would deeply influence his early interests in clinical
trials for cancer.</p>
<p>Zubrod’s particular interest was children’s leukemia—the cancer that
Farber had plunged into the very forefront of clinical investigation.
But to contend with leukemia, Zubrod knew, was to contend with its
fieriness and brittleness, its moody, volcanic unpredictability. Drugs
could be tested, but first, the children needed to be kept alive. A
quintessential delegator—an “Eisenhower” of cancer research, as
Freireich once called him—Zubrod quickly conscripted two young doctors
to maintain the front lines of the wards: Freireich and Frei, fresh from
their respective fellowships in Boston and St. Louis. Frei drove
cross-country in a beat-up old Studebaker to join Zubrod. Freireich came
just a few weeks later, in a ramshackle Oldsmobile containing all his
belongings, his pregnant wife, and his nine-month-old daughter.</p>
<p>It could easily have been a formula for disaster—but it worked. Right
from the start, the two Emils found that they shared a unique synergy.
Their collaboration was symbolic of a deep intellectual divide that ran
through the front lines of oncology: the rift between overmoderated
caution and bold experimentation. Each time Freireich pushed too hard on
one end of the experimental fulcrum—often bringing himself and his
patients to the brink of disaster—Frei pushed back to ensure that the
novel, quixotic, and often deeply toxic therapies were mitigated by
caution. Frei and Freireich’s battles soon became emblematic of the
tussles within the NCI. “Frei’s job,” one researcher recalled, “in those
days was to keep Freireich from getting in trouble.”</p>
<p>Zubrod had his own schemes to keep leukemia research out of trouble.
As new drugs, combinations, and trials proliferated, Zubrod worried that
institutions would be caught at cross-purposes, squabbling over patients
and protocols when they should really be battling cancer. Burchenal in
New York, Farber in Boston, James Holland at Roswell Park, and the two
Emils at the NCI were all chomping at the bit to launch clinical trials.
And since ALL was a rare disease, every patient was a precious resource
for a leukemia trial. To avert conflicts, Zubrod proposed that a
“consortium” of researchers be created to share patients, trials, data,
and knowledge.</p>
<p>The proposal changed the field. “Zubrod’s cooperative group model
galvanized cancer medicine,” Robert Mayer (who would later become the
chair of one of these groups) recalls. “For the first time, an academic
oncologist felt as if he had a community. The cancer doctor was not the
outcast anymore, not the man who prescribed poisons from some
underground chamber in the hospital.” The first group meeting, chaired
by Farber, was a resounding success. The researchers agreed to proceed
with a series of common trials, called protocols, as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>Zubrod next set about organizing the process by which trials could be
run. Cancer trials, he argued, had thus far been embarrassingly chaotic
and disorganized. Oncologists needed to emulate the best trials in
medicine. And to learn how to run objective, unbiased, state-of-the-art
clinical trials, they would need to study the history of the development
of antibiotics.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, as new antibiotics had begun to appear on the horizon,
physicians had encountered an important quandary: how might one
objectively test the efficacy of any novel drug? At the Medical Research
Council in Britain, the question had taken on a particularly urgent and
rancorous note. The discovery of streptomycin, a new antimicrobial drug
in the early forties, had set off a flurry of optimism that tuberculosis
could be cured. Streptomycin killed tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria in
petri dishes, but its efficacy in humans was unknown. The drug was in
critically short supply, with doctors parrying to use even a few
milligrams of it to treat a variety of other infections. To ration
streptomycin, an objective experiment to determine its efficacy in human
tuberculosis was needed.</p>
<p>But what sort of experiment? An English statistician named Bradford
Hill (a former victim of TB himself) proposed an extraordinary solution.
Hill began by recognizing that doctors, of all people, could not be
entrusted to perform such an experiment without inherent biases. Every
biological experiment requires a “control” arm—untreated subjects
against whom the efficacy of a treatment can be judged. But left to
their own devices, doctors were inevitably likely (even if unconsciously
so) to select certain types of patients upfront, then judge the effects
of a drug on this highly skewed population using subjective criteria,
piling bias on top of bias.</p>
<p>Hill’s proposed solution was to remove such biases by randomly
assigning patients to treatment with streptomycin versus a placebo. By
“randomizing” patients to each arm, any doctors’ biases in patient
assignment would be dispelled. Neutrality would be enforced—and thus a
hypothesis could be strictly tested.</p>
<p>Hill’s randomized trial was a success. The streptomycin arm of the
trial clearly showed an improved response over the placebo arm,
enshrining the antibiotic as a new anti-TB drug. But perhaps more
important, it was Hill’s methodological invention that was permanently
enshrined. For medical scientists, the randomized trial became the most
stringent means to evaluate the efficacy of any intervention in the most
unbiased manner.</p>
<p>Zubrod was inspired by these early antimicrobial trials. He had used
these principles in the late 1940s to test antimalarials, and he
proposed using them to lay down the principles by which the NCI would
test its new protocols. The NCI’s trials would be systematic: every
trial would test a crucial piece of logic or hypothesis and produce yes
and no answers. The trials would be sequential: the lessons of one trial
would lead to the next and so forth—a relentless march of progress until
leukemia had been cured. The trials would be objective, randomized if
possible, with clear, unbiased criteria to assign patients and measure
responses.</p>
<p>Trial methodology was not the only powerful lesson that Zubrod, Frei,
and Freireich learned from the antimicrobial world. “The analogy of drug
resistance to antibiotics was given deep thought,” Freireich remembered.
As Farber and Burchenal had discovered to their chagrin in Boston and
New York, leukemia treated with a single drug would inevitably grow
resistant to the drug, resulting in the flickering, transient responses
followed by the devastating relapses.</p>
<p>The situation was reminiscent of TB. Like cancer cells,
mycobacteria—the germs that cause tuberculosis—also became resistant to
antibiotics if the drugs were used singly. Bacteria that survived a
single-drug regimen divided, mutated, and acquired drug resistance, thus
making that original drug useless. To thwart this resistance, doctors
treating TB had used a blitzkrieg of antibiotics—two or three used
together like a dense pharmaceutical blanket meant to smother all cell
division and stave off bacterial resistance, thus extinguishing the
infection as definitively as possible.</p>
<p>But could two or three drugs be tested simultaneously against
cancer—or would the toxicities be so forbidding that they would
instantly kill patients? As Freireich, Frei, and Zubrod studied the
growing list of antileukemia drugs, the notion of combining drugs
emerged with growing clarity: toxicities notwithstanding, annihilating
leukemia might involve using a combination of two or more drugs.</p>
<p>The first protocol was launched to test different doses of Farber’s
methotrexate combined with Burchenal’s 6-MP, the two most active
antileukemia drugs. Three hospitals agreed to join: the NCI, Roswell
Park, and the Children’s Hospital in Buffalo, New York. The aims of the
trial were kept intentionally simple. One group would be treated with
intensive methotrexate dosing, while the other group would be treated
with milder and less intensive dosing. Eighty-four patients enrolled. On
arrival day, parents of the children were handed white envelopes with
the randomized assignment sealed inside.</p>
<p>Despite the multiple centers and the many egos involved, the trial
ran surprisingly smoothly. Toxicities multiplied; the two-drug regimen
was barely tolerable. But the intensive group fared better, with longer
and more durable responses. The regimen, though, was far from a cure:
even the intensively treated children soon relapsed and died by the end
of one year.</p>
<p>Protocol I set an important precedent. Zubrod’s and Farber’s
cherished model of a cancer cooperative group was finally in action.
Dozens of doctors, nurses, and patients in three independent hospitals
had yoked themselves to follow a single formula to treat a group of
patients—and each one, suspending its own idiosyncrasies, had followed
the instructions perfectly. “This work is one of the first comparative
studies in the chemotherapy of malignant neoplastic disease,” Frei
noted. In a world of ad hoc, often desperate strategies, conformity had
finally come to cancer.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1957, the leukemia group launched yet another
modification to the first experiment. This time, one group received a
combined regimen, while the other two groups were given one drug each.
And with the question even more starkly demarcated, the pattern of
responses was even clearer. Given alone, either of the drugs performed
poorly, with a response rate between 15 and 20 percent. But when
methotrexate and 6-MP were administered together, the remission rate
jumped to 45 percent.</p>
<p>The next chemotherapy protocol, launched just two years later in
1959, ventured into even riskier territory. Patients were treated with
two drugs to send them into complete remission. Then half the group
received several months of additional drugs, while the other group was
given a placebo. Once again, the pattern was consistent. The more
aggressively treated group had longer and more durable responses.</p>
<p>Trial by trial, the group crept forward, like a spring uncoiling to
its end. In just six pivotal years, the leukemia study group had slowly
worked itself to giving patients not one or two, but four chemotherapy
drugs, often in succession. By the winter of 1962, the compass of
leukemia medicine pointed unfailingly in one direction. If two drugs
were better than one, and if three better than two, then what if four
antileukemia drugs could be given together—in combination, as with
TB?</p>
<p>Both Frei and Freireich sensed that this was the inevitable
culmination of the NCI’s trials. But even if they knew it
subconsciously, they tiptoed around the notion for months. “The
resistance would be fierce,” Freireich knew. The leukemia ward was
already being called a “butcher shop” by others at the NCI. “The idea of
treating children with three or four highly cytotoxic drugs was
considered cruel and insane,” Freireich said. “Even Zubrod could not
convince the consortium to try it. No one wanted to turn the NCI into a
National Institute of Butchery.”</p>
