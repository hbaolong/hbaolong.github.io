<h4 id="vanishing-humors">Vanishing Humors</h4>
<p>Rack’t carcasses make ill Anatomies.</p>
<p>—John Donne</p>
<p>In the winter of 1533, a nineteen-year-old student from Brussels,
Andreas Vesalius, arrived at the University of Paris hoping to learn
Galenic anatomy and pathology and to start a practice in surgery. To
Vesalius’s shock and disappointment, the anatomy lessons at the
university were in a preposterous state of disarray. The school lacked a
specific space for performing dissections. The basement of the Hospital
Dieu, where anatomy demonstrations were held, was a theatrically macabre
space where instructors hacked their way through decaying cadavers while
dogs gnawed on bones and drippings below. “Aside from the eight muscles
of the abdomen, badly mangled and in the wrong order, no one had ever
shown a muscle to me, nor any bone, much less the succession of nerves,
veins, and arteries,” Vesalius wrote in a letter. Without a map of human
organs to guide them, surgeons were left to hack their way through the
body like sailors sent to sea without a map—the blind leading the
ill.</p>
<p>Frustrated with these ad hoc dissections, Vesalius decided to create
his own anatomical map. He needed his own specimens, and he began to
scour the graveyards around Paris for bones and bodies. At Montfaucon,
he stumbled upon the massive gibbet of the city of Paris, where the
bodies of petty prisoners were often left dangling. A few miles away, at
the Cemetery of the Innocents, the skeletons of victims of the Great
Plague lay half-exposed in their graves, eroded down to the bone.</p>
<p>The gibbet and the graveyard—the convenience stores for the medieval
anatomist—yielded specimen after specimen for Vesalius, and he
compulsively raided them, often returning twice a day to cut pieces
dangling from the chains and smuggle them off to his dissection chamber.
Anatomy came alive for him in this grisly world of the dead. In 1538,
collaborating with artists in Titian’s studio, Vesalius began to publish
his detailed drawings in plates and books—elaborate and delicate
etchings charting the courses of arteries and veins, mapping nerves and
lymph nodes. In some plates, he pulled away layers of tissue, exposing
the delicate surgical planes underneath. In another drawing, he sliced
through the brain in deft horizontal sections—a human CT scanner,
centuries before its time—to demonstrate the relationship between the
cisterns and the ventricles.</p>
<p>Vesalius’s anatomical project had started as a purely intellectual
exercise but was soon propelled toward a pragmatic need. Galen’s humoral
theory of disease—that all diseases were pathological accumulations of
the four cardinal fluids—required that patients be bled and purged to
squeeze the culprit humors out of the body. But for the bleedings to be
successful, they had to be performed at specific sites in the body. If
the patient was to be bled prophylactically (that is, to prevent
disease), then the purging was to be performed far away from the
possible disease site, so that the humors could be diverted from it. But
if the patient was being bled therapeutically—to cure an established
disease—then the bleeding had to be done from nearby vessels leading
into the site.</p>
<p>To clarify this already foggy theory, Galen had borrowed an equally
foggy Hippocratic expression, και ιειυ—Greek for “straight into”—to
describe isolating the vessels that led “straight into” tumors. But
Galen’s terminology had pitched physicians into further confusion. What
on earth, they wondered, had Galen meant by “straight into”? Which
vessels led “straight into” a tumor or an organ, and which led the way
out? The instructions became a maze of misunderstanding. In the absence
of a systematic anatomical map—without the establishment of
normality—abnormal anatomy was impossible to fathom.</p>
<p>Vesalius decided to solve the problem by systematically sketching out
every blood vessel and nerve in the body, producing an anatomical atlas
for surgeons. “In the course of explaining the opinion of the divine
Hippocrates and Galen,” he wrote in a letter, “I happened to delineate
the veins on a chart, thinking that thus I might be able easily to
demonstrate what Hippocrates understood by the expression και ιειυ, for
you know how much dissension and controversy on venesection was stirred
up, even among the learned.”</p>
<p>But having started this project, Vesalius found that he could not
stop. “My drawing of the veins pleased the professors of medicine and
all the students so much that they earnestly sought from me a diagram of
the arteries and also one of the nerves. . . . I could not disappoint
them.” The body was endlessly interconnected: veins ran parallel to
nerves, the nerves were connected to the spinal cord, the cord to the
brain, and so forth. Anatomy could only be captured in its totality, and
soon the project became so gargantuan and complex that it had to be
outsourced to yet other illustrators to complete.</p>
<p>But no matter how diligently Vesalius pored through the body, he
could not find Galen’s black bile. The word autopsy comes from the Greek
“to see for oneself”; as Vesalius learned to see for himself, he could
no longer force Galen’s mystical visions to fit his own. The lymphatic
system carried a pale, watery fluid; the blood vessels were filled, as
expected, with blood. Yellow bile was in the liver. But black
bile—Galen’s oozing carrier of cancer and depression—could not be found
anywhere.</p>
<p>Vesalius now found himself in a strange position. He had emerged from
a tradition steeped in Galenic scholarship; he had studied, edited, and
republished Galen’s books. But black bile—that glistening centerpiece of
Galen’s physiology—was nowhere to be found. Vesalius hedged about his
discovery. Guiltily, he heaped even more praise on the long-dead Galen.
But, an empiricist to the core, Vesalius left his drawings just as he
saw things, leaving others to draw their own conclusions. There was no
black bile. Vesalius had started his anatomical project to save Galen’s
theory, but, in the end, he quietly buried it.</p>
<p>In 1793, Matthew Baillie, an anatomist in London, published a
textbook called The Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts
of the Human Body. Baillie’s book, written for surgeons and anatomists,
was the obverse of Vesalius’s project: if Vesalius had mapped out
“normal” anatomy, Baillie mapped the body in its diseased, abnormal
state. It was Vesalius’s study read through an inverted lens. Galen’s
fantastical speculations about illnesses were even more at stake here.
Black bile may not have existed discernably in normal tissue, but tumors
should have been chock-full of it. But none was to be found. Baillie
described cancers of the lung (“as large as an orange”), stomach (“a
fungous appearance”), and the testicles (“a foul deep ulcer”) and
provided vivid engravings of these tumors. But he could not find the
channels of bile anywhere—not even in his orange-size tumors, nor in the
deepest cavities of his “foul deep ulcers.” If Galen’s web of invisible
fluids existed, then it existed outside tumors, outside the pathological
world, outside the boundaries of normal anatomical inquiry—in short,
outside medical science. Like Vesalius, Baillie drew anatomy and cancer
the way he actually saw it. At long last, the vivid channels of black
bile, the humors in the tumors, that had so gripped the minds of doctors
and patients for centuries, vanished from the picture.</p>
