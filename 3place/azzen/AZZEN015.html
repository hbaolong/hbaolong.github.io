<h4 id="they-form-a-society">“They form a society”</h4>
<p>All of this demonstrates why few research scientists are in
policy-making positions of public trust. Their training for detail
produces tunnel vision, and men of broader perspective are required for
useful application of scientific progress.</p>
<p>—Michael Shimkin</p>
<p>I am aware of some alarm in the scientific community that singling
out cancer for . . . a direct presidential initiative will somehow lead
to the eventual dismantling of the National Institutes of Health. I do
not share these feelings. . . . We are at war with an insidious,
relentless foe. [We] rightly demand clear decisive action—not endless
committee meetings, interminable reviews and tired justifications of the
status quo.</p>
<p>—Lister Hill</p>
<p>In 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat, toured the
United States and was astonished by the obsessive organizational energy
of its citizens. “Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all
dispositions constantly form associations . . . of a thousand other
kinds—religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous
or diminutive,” Tocqueville wrote. “Americans make associations to give
entertainments, to found seminaries, to build inns, to construct
churches, to diffuse books, to send missionaries to the antipodes. . . .
If it is proposed to inculcate some truth or to foster some feeling by
the encouragement of a great example, they form a society.”</p>
<p>More than a century after Tocqueville toured the States, as Farber
sought to transform the landscape of cancer, he instinctively grasped
the truth behind Tocqueville’s observation. If visionary changes were
best forged by groups of private citizens forming societies, then Farber
needed such a coalition to launch a national attack on cancer. This was
a journey that he could not begin or finish alone. He needed a colossal
force behind him—a force that would far exceed the Jimmy Fund in
influence, organization, and money. Real money, and the real power to
transform, still lay under congressional control. But prying open vast
federal coffers meant deploying the enormous force of a society of
private citizens. And Farber knew that this scale of lobbying was beyond
him.</p>
<p>There was, he knew, one person who possessed the energy, resources,
and passion for this project: a pugnacious New Yorker who had declared
it her personal mission to transform the geography of American health
through group-building, lobbying, and political action. Wealthy,
politically savvy, and well connected, she lunched with the
Rockefellers, danced with the Trumans, dined with the Kennedys, and
called Lady Bird Johnson by her first name. Farber had heard of her from
his friends and donors in Boston. He had run into her during his early
political forays in Washington. Her disarming smile and frozen bouffant
were as recognizable in the political circles in Washington as in the
salons of New York. Just as recognizable was her name: Mary Woodard
Lasker.</p>
<p>Mary Woodard was born in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1900. Her father,
Frank Woodard, was a successful small-town banker. Her mother, Sara
Johnson, had emigrated from Ireland in the 1880s, worked as a saleswoman
at the Carson’s department store in Chicago, and ascended briskly
through professional ranks to become one of the highest-paid saleswomen
at the store. Salesmanship, as Lasker would later write, was “a natural
talent” for Johnson. Johnson had later turned from her work at the
department store to lobbying for philanthropic ventures and public
projects—selling ideas instead of clothes. She was, as Lasker once put
it, a woman who “could sell . . . anything that she wanted to.”</p>
<p>Mary Lasker’s own instruction in sales began in the early 1920s,
when, having graduated from Radcliffe College, she found her first job
selling European paintings on commission for a gallery in New York—a
cutthroat profession that involved as much social maneuvering as canny
business sense. In the mid-1930s, Lasker left the gallery to start an
entrepreneurial venture called Hollywood Patterns, which sold simple
prefab dress designs to chain stores. Once again, good instincts
crisscrossed with good timing. As women joined the workforce in
increasing numbers in the 1940s, Lasker’s mass-produced professional
clothes found a wide market. Lasker emerged from the Depression and the
war financially rejuvenated. By the late 1940s, she had grown into an
extraordinarily powerful businesswoman, a permanent fixture in the
firmament of New York society, a rising social star.</p>
<p>In 1939, Mary Woodard met Albert Lasker, the sixty-year-old president
of Lord and Thomas, an advertising firm based in Chicago. Albert Lasker,
like Mary Woodard, was considered an intuitive genius in his profession.
At Lord and Thomas, he had invented and perfected a new strategy of
advertising that he called “salesmanship in print.” A successful
advertisement, Lasker contended, was not merely a conglomeration of
jingles and images designed to seduce consumers into buying an object;
rather, it was a masterwork of copywriting that would tell a consumer
why to buy a product. Advertising was merely a carrier for information
and reason, and for the public to grasp its impact, information had to
be distilled into its essential elemental form. Each of Lasker’s widely
successful ad campaigns—for Sunkist oranges, Pepsodent toothpaste, and
Lucky Strike cigarettes among many others—highlighted this strategy. In
time, a variant of this idea, of advertising as a lubricant of
information and of the need to distill information into elemental
iconography would leave a deep and lasting impact on the cancer
campaign.</p>
<p>Mary and Albert had a brisk romance and a whirlwind courtship, and
they were married just fifteen months after they met—Mary for the second
time, Albert for the third. Mary Lasker was now forty years old.
Wealthy, gracious, and enterprising, she now launched a search for her
own philanthropic cause—retracing her mother’s conversion from a
businesswoman into a public activist.</p>
<p>For Mary Lasker, this search soon turned inward, into her personal
life. Three memories from her childhood and adolescence haunted her. In
one, she awakes from a terrifying illness—likely a near-fatal bout of
bacterial dysentery or pneumonia—febrile and confused, and overhears a
family friend say to her mother that she will likely not survive: “Sara,
I don’t think that you will ever raise her.”</p>
<p>In another, she has accompanied her mother to visit her family’s
laundress in Watertown, Wisconsin. The woman is recovering from surgery
for breast cancer—radical mastectomies performed on both breasts. Lasker
enters a dark shack with a low, small cot with seven children running
around and she is struck by the desolation and misery of the scene. The
notion of breasts being excised to stave cancer—“Cut off?” Lasker asks
her mother searchingly—puzzles and grips her. The laundress survives;
“cancer,” Lasker realizes, “can be cruel but it does not need to be
fatal.”</p>
<p>In the third, she is a teenager in college, and is confined to an
influenza ward during the epidemic of 1918. The lethal Spanish flu rages
outside, decimating towns and cities. Lasker survives—but the flu will
kill six hundred thousand Americans that year, and take nearly fifty
million lives worldwide, becoming the deadliest pandemic in history.</p>
<p>A common thread ran through these memories: the devastation of
illness—so proximal and threatening at all times—and the occasional
capacity, still unrealized, of medicine to transform lives. Lasker
imagined unleashing the power of medical research to combat diseases—a
power that, she felt, was still largely untapped. In 1939, the year that
she met Albert, her life collided with illness again: in Wisconsin, her
mother suffered a heart attack and then a stroke, leaving her paralyzed
and incapacitated. Lasker wrote to the head of the American Medical
Association to inquire about treatment. She was amazed—and infuriated,
again—at the lack of knowledge and the unrealized potential of medicine:
“I thought that was ridiculous. Other diseases could be treated . . .
the sulfa drugs had come into existence. Vitamin deficiencies could be
corrected, such as scurvy and pellagra. And I thought there was no good
reason why you couldn’t do something about stroke, because people didn’t
universally die of stroke . . . there must be some element that was
influential.”</p>
<p>In 1940, after a prolonged and unsuccessful convalescence, Lasker’s
mother died in Watertown. For Lasker, her mother’s death brought to a
boil the fury and indignation that had been building within her for
decades. She had found her mission. “I am opposed to heart attacks and
cancer,” she would later tell a reporter, “the way one is opposed to
sin.” Mary Lasker chose to eradicate diseases as some might eradicate
sin—through evangelism. If people did not believe in the importance of a
national strategy against diseases, she would convert them, using every
means at her disposal.</p>
<p>Her first convert was her husband. Grasping Mary’s commitment to the
idea, Albert Lasker became her partner, her adviser, her strategist, her
coconspirator. “There are unlimited funds,” he told her. “I will show
you how to get them.” This idea—of transforming the landscape of
American medical research using political lobbying and fund-raising at
an unprecedented scale—electrified her. The Laskers were professional
socialites, in the same way that one can be a professional scientist or
a professional athlete; they were extraordinary networkers, lobbyists,
minglers, conversers, persuaders, letter writers, cocktail
party–throwers, negotiators, name-droppers, deal makers.
Fund-raising—and, more important, friend-raising—was instilled in their
blood, and the depth and breadth of their social connections allowed
them to reach deeply into the minds—and pockets—of private donors and of
the government.</p>
<p>“If a toothpaste . . . deserved advertising at the rate of two or
three or four million dollars a year,” Mary Lasker reasoned, “then
research against diseases maiming and crippling people in the United
States and in the rest of the world deserved hundreds of millions of
dollars.” Within just a few years, she transformed, as BusinessWeek
magazine once put it, into “the fairy godmother of medical
research.”</p>
<p>The “fairy godmother” blew into the world of cancer research one
morning with the force of an unexpected typhoon. In April 1943, Mary
Lasker visited the office of Dr. Clarence Cook Little, the director of
the American Society for the Control of Cancer in New York. Lasker was
interested in finding out what exactly his society was doing to advance
cancer research, and how her foundation could help.</p>
<p>The visit left her cold. The society, a professional organization of
doctors and a few scientists, was self-contained and moribund, an
ossifying Manhattan social club. Of its small annual budget of about
50,000, it spent an even smaller smattering on research programs.
Fund-raising was outsourced to an organization called the Women’s Field
Army, whose volunteers were not represented on the ASCC board. To the
Laskers, who were accustomed to massive advertising blitzes and
saturated media attention—to “salesmanship in print”—the whole effort
seemed haphazard, ineffectual, stodgy, and unprofessional. Lasker was
bitingly critical: “Doctors,” she wrote, “are not administrators of
large amounts of money. They’re usually really small businessmen . . .
small professional men”—men who clearly lacked a systematic vision for
cancer. She made a ,000 donation to the ASCC and promised to be
back.</p>
<p>Lasker quickly got to work on her own. Her first priority was to make
a vast public issue out of cancer. Sidestepping major newspapers and
prominent magazines, she began with the one outlet of the media that she
knew would reach furthest into the trenches of the American psyche:
Reader’s Digest. In October 1943, Lasker persuaded a friend at the
Digest to run a series of articles on the screening and detection of
cancer. Within weeks, the articles set off a deluge of postcards,
telegrams, and handwritten notes to the magazine’s office, often
accompanied by small amounts of pocket money, personal stories, and
photographs. A soldier grieving the death of his mother sent in a small
contribution: “My mother died from cancer a few years ago. . . . We are
living in foxholes in the Pacific theater of war, but would like to help
out.” A schoolgirl whose grandfather had died of cancer enclosed a
dollar bill. Over the next months, the Digest received thousands of
letters and 00,000 in donations, exceeding the ASCC’s entire annual
budget.</p>
<p>Energized by the response, Lasker now set about thoroughly
overhauling the flailing ASCC in the larger hopes of reviving the
flailing effort against cancer. In 1949, a friend wrote to her, “A
two-pronged attack on the nation’s ignorance of the facts of its health
could well be undertaken: a long-range program of joint professional-lay
cooperation . . . and a shorter-range pressure group.” The ASCC, then,
had to be refashioned into this “shorter-range pressure group.” Albert
Lasker, who joined the ASCC board, recruited Emerson Foote, an
advertising executive, to join the society to streamline its
organization. Foote, just as horrified by the mildewy workings of the
agency as the Laskers, drafted an immediate action plan: he would
transform the moribund social club into a highly organized lobbying
group. The mandate demanded men of action: businessmen, movie producers,
admen, pharmaceutical executives, lawyers—friends and contacts culled
from the Laskers’ extensive network—rather than biologists,
epidemiologists, medical researchers, and doctors. By 1945, the
nonmedical representation in the ASCC governing board had vastly
increased, edging out its former members. The “Lay Group,” as it was
called, rechristened the organization the American Cancer Society, or
the ACS.</p>
<p>Subtly, although discernibly, the tone of the society changed as
well. Under Little, the ASCC had spent its energies drafting
insufferably detailed memorandums on standards of cancer care for
medical practitioners. (Since there was little treatment to offer, these
memoranda were not particularly useful.) Under the Laskers, predictably,
advertising and fund-raising efforts began to dominate its agenda. In a
single year, it printed 9 million “educational” pieces, 50,000 posters,
1.5 million window stickers, 165,000 coin boxes, 12,000 car cards, and
3,000 window exhibits. The Women’s Field Army—the “Ladies’ Garden Club,”
as one Lasker associate scathingly described it—was slowly edged out and
replaced by an intense, well-oiled fund-raising machine. Donations shot
through the roof: 32,000 in 1944, ,292,000 in 1945, 2,045,000 in
1947.</p>
<p>Money, and the shift in public visibility, brought inevitable
conflicts between the former members and the new ones. Clarence Little,
the ASCC president who had once welcomed Lasker into the group, found
himself increasingly marginalized by the Lay Group. He complained that
the lobbyists and fund-raisers were “unjustified, troublesome and
aggressive”—but it was too late. At the society’s annual meeting in
1945, after a bitter showdown with the “laymen,” he was forced to
resign.</p>
<p>With Little deposed and the board replaced, Foote and Lasker were
unstoppable. The society’s bylaws and constitution were rewritten with
nearly vengeful swiftness to accommodate the takeover, once again
emphasizing its lobbying and fund-raising activities. In a telegram to
Mary Lasker, Jim Adams, the president of the Standard Corporation (and
one of the chief instigators of the Lay Group), laid out the new rules,
arguably among the more unusual set of stipulations to be adopted by a
scientific organization: “The Committee should not include more than
four professional and scientific members. The Chief Executive should be
a layman.”</p>
<p>In those two sentences, Adams epitomized the extraordinary change
that had swept through the ACS. The society was now a high-stakes
juggernaut spearheaded by a band of fiery “laymen” activists to raise
money and publicity for a medical campaign. Lasker was the center of
this collective, its nucleating force, its queen bee. Collectively, the
activists began to be known as the “Laskerites” in the media. It was a
name that they embraced with pride.</p>
<p>In five years, Mary Lasker had raised the cancer society from the
dead. Her “shorter-range pressure group” was working in full force. The
Laskerites now had their long-range target: Congress. If they could
obtain federal backing for a War on Cancer, then the scale and scope of
their campaign would be astronomically multiplied.</p>
<p>“You were probably the first person to realize that the War against
Cancer has to be fought first on the floor of Congress—in order to
continue the fight in laboratories and hospitals,” the breast cancer
patient and activist Rose Kushner once wrote admiringly to Mary Lasker.
But cannily, Lasker grasped an even more essential truth: that the fight
had to begin in the lab before being brought to Congress. She needed yet
another ally—someone from the world of science to initiate a fight for
science funding. The War on Cancer needed a bona fide scientific sponsor
among all the advertisers and lobbyists—a real doctor to legitimize the
spin doctors. The person in question would need to understand the
Laskerites’ political priorities almost instinctually, then back them up
with unquestionable and unimpeachable scientific authority. Ideally, he
or she would be immersed in cancer research, yet willing to emerge out
of that immersion to occupy a much larger national arena. The one
man—and perhaps the only man—who could possibly fit the role was Sidney
Farber.</p>
<p>In fact, their needs were perfectly congruent: Farber needed a
political lobbyist as urgently as the Laskerites needed a scientific
strategist. It was like the meeting of two stranded travelers, each
carrying one-half of a map.</p>
<p>Farber and Mary Lasker met in Washington in late 1940s, not long
after Farber had shot to national fame with his antifolates. In the
winter of 1948, barely a few months after Farber’s paper on antifolates
had been published, John Heller, the director of the NCI, wrote to
Lasker introducing her to the idea of chemotherapy and to the doctor who
had dreamed up the notion in Boston. The idea of chemotherapy—a chemical
that could cure cancer outright (“a penicillin for cancer,” as the
oncologist Dusty Rhoads at Memorial Hospital liked to describe
it)—fascinated Lasker. By the early 1950s, she was regularly
corresponding with Farber about such drugs. Farber wrote back long,
detailed, meandering letters—“scientific treatises,” he called
them—educating her on his progress in Boston.</p>
<p>For Farber, the burgeoning relationship with Lasker had a cleansing,
clarifying quality—“a catharsis,” as he called it. He unloaded his
scientific knowledge on her, but more important, he also unloaded his
scientific and political ambition, an ambition he found easily
reflected, even magnified, in her eyes. By the mid-1950s, the scope of
their letters had considerably broadened: Farber and Lasker openly
broached the possibility of launching an all-out, coordinated attack on
cancer. “An organizational pattern is developing at a much more rapid
rate than I could have hoped,” Farber wrote. He spoke about his visits
to Washington to try to reorganize the National Cancer Institute into a
more potent and directed force against cancer.</p>
<p>Lasker was already a “regular on the Hill,” as one doctor described
her—her face, with its shellacked frieze of hair, and her hallmark gray
suit and pearls omnipresent on every committee and focus group related
to health care. Farber, too, was now becoming a “regular.” Dressed
perfectly for his part in a crisp, dark suit, his egghead
reading-glasses often perched at the edge of his nose, he was a
congressman’s spitting image of a physician-scientist. He possessed an
“evangelistic pizzazz” for medical science, an observer recalled. “Put a
tambourine in [his] hands” and he would immediately “go to work.”</p>
<p>To Farber’s evangelistic tambourine, Lasker added her own drumbeats
of enthusiasm. She spoke and wrote passionately and confidently about
her cause, emphasizing her points with quotes and questions. Back in New
York, she employed a retinue of assistants to scour newspapers and
magazines and clip out articles containing even a passing reference to
cancer—all of which she read, annotated on the margins with questions in
small, precise script, and distributed to the other Laskerites every
week.</p>
<p>“I have written to you so many times in what is becoming a favorite
technique—mental telepathy,” Farber wrote affectionately to Lasker, “but
such letters are never mailed.” As acquaintance bloomed into
familiarity, and familiarity into friendship, Farber and Lasker struck
up a synergistic partnership that would stretch over decades. In a
letter written in 1954, Farber used the word crusade to describe their
campaign against cancer. The word was deeply symbolic. For Sidney
Farber, as for Mary Lasker, the cancer campaign was indeed turning into
a “crusade,” a scientific battle imbued with such fanatical intensity
that only a religious metaphor could capture its essence. It was as if
they had stumbled upon an unshakable, fixed vision of a cure—and they
would stop at nothing to drag even a reluctant nation toward it.</p>
