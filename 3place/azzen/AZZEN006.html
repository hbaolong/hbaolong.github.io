<p>Black bile without boiling causes cancers.</p>
<p>—Galen, AD 130</p>
<p>We have learned nothing, therefore, about the real cause of cancer or
its actual nature. We are where the Greeks were.</p>
<p>—Francis Carter Wood in 1914</p>
<p>It’s bad bile. It’s bad habits. It’s bad bosses. It’s bad genes.</p>
<p>—Mel Greaves, Cancer:</p>
<p>The Evolutionary Legacy, 2000</p>
<p>In some ways disease does not exist until we have agreed that it
does—by perceiving, naming, and responding to it.</p>
<p>—C. E. Rosenberg</p>
<p>Even an ancient monster needs a name. To name an illness is to
describe a certain condition of suffering—a literary act before it
becomes a medical one. A patient, long before he becomes the subject of
medical scrutiny, is, at first, simply a storyteller, a narrator of
suffering—a traveler who has visited the kingdom of the ill. To relieve
an illness, one must begin, then, by unburdening its story.</p>
<p>The names of ancient illnesses are condensed stories in their own
right. Typhus, a stormy disease, with erratic, vaporous fevers, arose
from the Greek tuphon, the father of winds—a word that also gives rise
to the modern typhoon. Influenza emerged from the Latin influentia
because medieval doctors imagined that the cyclical epidemics of flu
were influenced by stars and planets revolving toward and away from the
earth. Tuberculosis coagulated out of the Latin tuber, referring to the
swollen lumps of glands that looked like small vegetables. Lymphatic
tuberculosis, TB of the lymph glands, was called scrofula, from the
Latin word for “piglet,” evoking the rather morbid image of a chain of
swollen glands arranged in a line like a group of suckling pigs.</p>
<p>It was in the time of Hippocrates, around 400 BC, that a word for
cancer first appeared in the medical literature: karkinos, from the
Greek word for “crab.” The tumor, with its clutch of swollen blood
vessels around it, reminded Hippocrates of a crab dug in the sand with
its legs spread in a circle. The image was peculiar (few cancers truly
resemble crabs), but also vivid. Later writers, both doctors and
patients, added embellishments. For some, the hardened, matted surface
of the tumor was reminiscent of the tough carapace of a crab’s body.
Others felt a crab moving under the flesh as the disease spread
stealthily throughout the body. For yet others, the sudden stab of pain
produced by the disease was like being caught in the grip of a crab’s
pincers.</p>
<p>Another Greek word would intersect with the history of cancer—onkos,
a word used occasionally to describe tumors, from which the discipline
of oncology would take its modern name. Onkos was the Greek term for a
mass or a load, or more commonly a burden; cancer was imagined as a
burden carried by the body. In Greek theater, the same word, onkos,
would be used to denote a tragic mask that was often “burdened” with an
unwieldy conical weight on its head to denote the psychic load carried
by its wearer.</p>
<p>But while these vivid metaphors might resonate with our contemporary
understanding of cancer, what Hippocrates called karkinos and the
disease that we now know as cancer were, in fact, vastly different
creatures. Hippocrates’ karkinos were mostly large, superficial tumors
that were easily visible to the eye: cancers of the breast, skin, jaw,
neck, and tongue. Even the distinction between malignant and
nonmalignant tumors likely escaped Hippocrates: his karkinos included
every conceivable form of swelling—nodes, carbuncles, polyps,
protrusions, tubercles, pustules, and glands—lumps lumped
indiscriminately into the same category of pathology.</p>
<p>The Greeks had no microscopes. They had never imagined an entity
called a cell, let alone seen one, and the idea that karkinos was the
uncontrolled growth of cells could not possibly have occurred to them.
They were, however, preoccupied with fluid mechanics—with waterwheels,
pistons, valves, chambers, and sluices—a revolution in hydraulic science
originating with irrigation and canal-digging and culminating with
Archaemedes discovering his eponymous laws in his bathtub. This
preoccupation with hydraulics also flowed into Greek medicine and
pathology. To explain illness—all illness—Hippocrates fashioned an
elaborate doctrine based on fluids and volumes, which he freely applied
to pneumonia, boils, dysentery, and hemorrhoids. The human body,
Hippocrates proposed, was composed of four cardinal fluids called
humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm. Each of these fluids
had a unique color (red, black, yellow, and white), viscosity, and
essential character. In the normal body, these four fluids were held in
perfect, if somewhat precarious, balance. In illness, this balance was
upset by the excess of one fluid.</p>
<p>The physician Claudius Galen, a prolific writer and influential Greek
doctor who practiced among the Romans around AD 160, brought
Hippocrates’ humoral theory to its apogee. Like Hippocrates, Galen set
about classifying all illnesses in terms of excesses of various fluids.
Inflammation—a red, hot, painful distension—was attributed to an
overabundance of blood. Tubercles, pustules, catarrh, and nodules of
lymph—all cool, boggy, and white—were excesses of phlegm. Jaundice was
the overflow of yellow bile. For cancer, Galen reserved the most
malevolent and disquieting of the four humors: black bile. (Only one
other disease, replete with metaphors, would be attributed to an excess
of this oily, viscous humor: depression. Indeed, melancholia, the
medieval name for “depression,” would draw its name from the Greek
melas, “black,” and khole, “bile.” Depression and cancer, the psychic
and physical diseases of black bile, were thus intrinsically
intertwined.) Galen proposed that cancer was “trapped” black bile—static
bile unable to escape from a site and thus congealed into a matted mass.
“Of blacke cholor [bile], without boyling cometh cancer,” Thomas Gale,
the English surgeon, wrote of Galen’s theory in the sixteenth century,
“and if the humor be sharpe, it maketh ulceration, and for this cause,
these tumors are more blacker in color.”</p>
<p>That short, vivid description would have a profound impact on the
future of oncology—much broader than Galen (or Gale) may have intended.
Cancer, Galenic theory suggested, was the result of a systemic malignant
state, an internal overdose of black bile. Tumors were just local
outcroppings of a deep-seated bodily dysfunction, an imbalance of
physiology that had pervaded the entire corpus. Hippocrates had once
abstrusely opined that cancer was “best left untreated, since patients
live longer that way.” Five centuries later, Galen had explained his
teacher’s gnomic musings in a fantastical swoop of physiological
conjecture. The problem with treating cancer surgically, Galen
suggested, was that black bile was everywhere, as inevitable and
pervasive as any fluid. You could cut cancer out, but the bile would
flow right back, like sap seeping through the limbs of a tree.</p>
<p>Galen died in Rome in 199 AD, but his influence on medicine stretched
over the centuries. The black-bile theory of cancer was so
metaphorically seductive that it clung on tenaciously in the minds of
doctors. The surgical removal of tumors—a local solution to a systemic
problem—was thus perceived as a fool’s operation. Generations of
surgeons layered their own observations on Galen’s, solidifying the
theory even further. “Do not be led away and offer to operate,” John of
Arderne wrote in the mid-1300s. “It will only be a disgrace to you.”
Leonard Bertipaglia, perhaps the most influential surgeon of the
fifteenth century, added his own admonishment: “Those who pretend to
cure cancer by incising, lifting, and extirpating it only transform a
nonulcerous cancer into an ulcerous one. . . . In all my practice, I
have never seen a cancer cured by incision, nor known anyone who
has.”</p>
<p>Unwittingly, Galen may actually have done the future victims of
cancer a favor—at least a temporary one. In the absence of anesthesia
and antibiotics, most surgical operations performed in the dank chamber
of a medieval clinic—or more typically in the back room of a barbershop
with a rusty knife and leather straps for restraints—were disastrous,
life-threatening affairs. The sixteenth-century surgeon Ambroise Paré
described charring tumors with a soldering iron heated on coals, or
chemically searing them with a paste of sulfuric acid. Even a small nick
in the skin, treated thus, could quickly suppurate into a lethal
infection. The tumors would often profusely bleed at the slightest
provocation.</p>
<p>Lorenz Heister, an eighteenth-century German physician, once
described a mastectomy in his clinic as if it were a sacrificial ritual:
“Many females can stand the operation with the greatest courage and
without hardly moaning at all. Others, however, make such a clamor that
they may dishearten even the most undaunted surgeon and hinder the
operation. To perform the operation, the surgeon should be steadfast and
not allow himself to become discomforted by the cries of the
patient.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, rather than take their chances with such “undaunted”
surgeons, most patients chose to hang their fates with Galen and try
systemic medicines to purge the black bile. The apothecary thus soon
filled up with an enormous list of remedies for cancer: tincture of
lead, extracts of arsenic, boar’s tooth, fox lungs, rasped ivory, hulled
castor, ground white-coral, ipecac, senna, and a smattering of
purgatives and laxatives. There was alcohol and the tincture of opium
for intractable pain. In the seventeenth century, a paste of crab’s
eyes, at five shillings a pound, was popular—using fire to treat fire.
The ointments and salves grew increasingly bizarre by the century:
goat’s dung, frogs, crow’s feet, dog fennel, tortoise liver, the laying
of hands, blessed waters, or the compression of the tumor with lead
plates.</p>
<p>Despite Galen’s advice, an occasional small tumor was still
surgically excised. (Even Galen had reportedly performed such surgeries,
possibly for cosmetic or palliative reasons.) But the idea of surgical
removal of cancer as a curative treatment was entertained only in the
most extreme circumstances. When medicines and operations failed,
doctors resorted to the only established treatment for cancer, borrowed
from Galen’s teachings: an intricate series of bleeding and purging
rituals to squeeze the humors out of the body, as if it were an
overfilled, heavy sponge.</p>
