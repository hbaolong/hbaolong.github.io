<p>The professor who blesses the occasion</p>
<p>Which permits him to explain something profound</p>
<p>Nears me and is pleased to direct me—</p>
<p>“Amputate the breast.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” I said with sadness</p>
<p>“But I had forgotten the operation.”</p>
<p>—Rodolfo Figuoeroa,</p>
<p>in Poet Physicians</p>
<p>It is over: she is dressed, steps gently and decently down from the
table, looks for James; then, turning to the surgeon and the students,
she curtsies—and in a low, clear voice, begs their pardon if she has
behaved ill. The students—all of us—wept like children; the surgeon
happed her up.</p>
<p>—John Brown describing a</p>
<p>nineteenth-century mastectomy</p>
<p>William Stewart Halsted, whose name was to be inseparably attached to
the concept of “radical” surgery, did not ask for that distinction.
Instead, it was handed to him almost without any asking, like a scalpel
delivered wordlessly into the outstretched hand of a surgeon. Halsted
didn’t invent radical surgery. He inherited the idea from his
predecessors and brought it to its extreme and logical perfection—only
to find it inextricably attached to his name.</p>
<p>Halsted was born in 1852, the son of a well-to-do clothing merchant
in New York. He finished high school at the Phillips Academy in Andover
and attended Yale College, where his athletic prowess, rather than
academic achievement, drew the attention of his teachers and mentors. He
wandered into the world of surgery almost by accident, attending medical
school not because he was driven to become a surgeon but because he
could not imagine himself apprenticed as a merchant in his father’s
business. In 1874, Halsted matriculated at the College of Physicians and
Surgeons at Columbia. He was immediately fascinated by anatomy. This
fascination, like many of Halsted’s other interests in his later
years—purebred dogs, horses, starched tablecloths, linen shirts,
Parisian leather shoes, and immaculate surgical sutures—soon grew into
an obsessive quest. He swallowed textbooks of anatomy whole and, when
the books were exhausted, moved on to real patients with an equally
insatiable hunger.</p>
<p>In the mid-1870s, Halsted passed an entrance examination to be a
surgical intern at Bellevue, a New York City hospital swarming with
surgical patients. He split his time between the medical school and the
surgical clinic, traveling several miles across New York between
Bellevue and Columbia. Understandably, by the time he had finished
medical school, he had already suffered a nervous breakdown. He
recuperated for a few weeks on Block Island, then, dusting himself off,
resumed his studies with just as much energy and verve. This
pattern—heroic, Olympian exertion to the brink of physical
impossibility, often followed by a near collapse—was to become a
hallmark of Halsted’s approach to nearly every challenge. It would leave
an equally distinct mark on his approach to surgery, surgical
education—and cancer.</p>
<p>Halsted entered surgery at a transitional moment in its history.
Bloodletting, cupping, leaching, and purging were common procedures. One
woman with convulsions and fever from a postsurgical infection was
treated with even more barbaric attempts at surgery: “I opened a large
orifice in each arm,” her surgeon wrote with self-congratulatory
enthusiasm in the 1850s, “and cut both temporal arteries and had her
blood flowing freely from all at the same time, determined to bleed her
until the convulsions ceased.” Another doctor, prescribing a remedy for
lung cancer, wrote, “Small bleedings give temporary relief, although, of
course, they cannot often be repeated.” At Bellevue, the “internes” ran
about in corridors with “pus-pails,” the bodily drippings of patients
spilling out of them. Surgical sutures were made of catgut, sharpened
with spit, and left to hang from incisions into the open air. Surgeons
walked around with their scalpels dangling from their pockets. If a tool
fell on the blood-soiled floor, it was dusted off and inserted back into
the pocket—or into the body of the patient on the operating table.</p>
<p>In October 1877, leaving behind this gruesome medical world of
purgers, bleeders, pus-pails, and quacks, Halsted traveled to Europe to
visit the clinics of London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, or Leipzig, where
young American surgeons were typically sent to learn refined European
surgical techniques. The timing was fortuitous: Halsted arrived in
Europe when cancer surgery was just emerging from its chrysalis. In the
high-baroque surgical amphitheaters of the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in
Vienna, Theodor Billroth was teaching his students novel techniques to
dissect the stomach (the complete surgical removal of cancer, Billroth
told his students, was merely an “audacious step” away). At Halle, a few
hundred miles from Vienna, the German surgeon Richard von Volkmann was
working on a technique to operate on breast cancer. Halsted met the
giants of European surgery: Hans Chiari, who had meticulously
deconstructed the anatomy of the liver; Anton Wolfler, who had studied
with Billroth and was learning to dissect the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>For Halsted, this whirlwind tour through Berlin, Halle, Zurich,
London, and Vienna was an intellectual baptism. When he returned to
practice in New York in the early 1880s, his mind was spinning with the
ideas he had encountered in his journey: Lister’s carbolic sprays,
Volkmann’s early attempts at cancer surgery, and Billroth’s miraculous
abdominal operations. Energized and inspired, Halsted threw himself to
work, operating on patients at Roosevelt Hospital, at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia, at Bellevue, and at Chambers
Hospital. Bold, inventive, and daring, his confidence in his handiwork
boomed. In 1882, he removed an infected gallbladder from his mother on a
kitchen table, successfully performing one of the first such operations
in America. Called urgently to see his sister, who was bleeding heavily
after childbirth, he withdrew his own blood and transfused her with it.
(He had no knowledge of blood types; but fortunately Halsted and his
sister were a perfect match.)</p>
<p>In 1884, at the prime of his career in New York, Halsted read a paper
describing the use of a new surgical anesthetic called cocaine. At
Halle, in Volkmann’s clinic, he had watched German surgeons perform
operations using this drug; it was cheap, accessible, foolproof, and
easy to dose—the fast food of surgical anesthesia. His experimental
curiosity aroused, Halsted began to inject himself with the drug,
testing it before using it to numb patients for his ambitious surgeries.
He found that it produced much more than a transitory numbness: it
amplified his instinct for tirelessness; it synergized with his already
manic energy. His mind became, as one observer put it, “clearer and
clearer, with no sense of fatigue and no desire or ability to sleep.” He
had, it would seem, conquered all his mortal imperfections: the need to
sleep, exhaustion, and nihilism. His restive personality had met its
perfect pharmacological match.</p>
<p>For the next five years, Halsted sustained an incredible career as a
young surgeon in New York despite a fierce and growing addiction to
cocaine. He wrested some control over his addiction by heroic
self-denial and discipline. (At night, he reportedly left a sealed vial
of cocaine by his bedside, thus testing himself by constantly having the
drug within arm’s reach.) But he relapsed often and fiercely, unable to
ever fully overcome his habit. He voluntarily entered the Butler
sanatorium in Providence, where he was treated with morphine to treat
his cocaine habit—in essence, exchanging one addiction for another. In
1889, still oscillating between the two highly addictive drugs (yet
still astonishingly productive in his surgical clinic in New York), he
was recruited to the newly built Johns Hopkins Hospital by the renowned
physician William Welch—in part to start a new surgical department and
in equal part to wrest him out of his New York world of isolation,
overwork, and drug addiction.</p>
<p>Hopkins was meant to change Halsted, and it did. Gregarious and
outgoing in his former life, he withdrew sharply into a cocooned and
private empire where things were controlled, clean, and perfect. He
launched an awe-inspiring training program for young surgical residents
that would build them in his own image—a superhuman initiation into a
superhuman profession that emphasized heroism, self-denial, diligence,
and tirelessness. (“It will be objected that this apprenticeship is too
long, that the young surgeon will be stale,” he wrote in 1904, but
“these positions are not for those who so soon weary of the study of
their profession.”) He married Caroline Hampton, formerly his chief
nurse, and lived in a sprawling three-story mansion on the top of a hill
(“cold as stone and most unlivable,” as one of his students described
it), each residing on a separate floor. Childless, socially awkward,
formal, and notoriously reclusive, the Halsteds raised thoroughbred
horses and purebred dachshunds. Halsted was still deeply addicted to
morphine, but he took the drug in such controlled doses and on such a
strict schedule that not even his closest students suspected it. The
couple diligently avoided Baltimore society. When visitors came
unannounced to their mansion on the hill, the maid was told to inform
them that the Halsteds were not home.</p>
<p>With the world around him erased and silenced by this routine and
rhythm, Halsted now attacked breast cancer with relentless energy. At
Volkmann’s clinic in Halle, Halsted had witnessed the German surgeon
performing increasingly meticulous and aggressive surgeries to remove
tumors from the breast. But Volkmann, Halsted knew, had run into a wall.
Even though the surgeries had grown extensive and exhaustive, breast
cancer had still relapsed, eventually recurring months or even years
after the operation.</p>
<p>What caused this relapse? At St. Luke’s Hospital in London in the
1860s, the English surgeon Charles Moore had also noted these vexing
local recurrences. Frustrated by repeated failures, Moore had begun to
record the anatomy of each relapse, denoting the area of the original
tumor, the precise margin of the surgery, and the site of cancer
recurrence by drawing tiny black dots on a diagram of a breast—creating
a sort of historical dartboard of cancer recurrence. And to Moore’s
surprise, dot by dot, a pattern had emerged. The recurrences had
accumulated precisely around the margins of the original surgery, as if
minute remnants of cancer had been left behind by incomplete surgery and
grown back. “Mammary cancer requires the careful extirpation of the
entire organ,” Moore concluded. “Local recurrence of cancer after
operations is due to the continuous growth of fragments of the principal
tumor.”</p>
<p>Moore’s hypothesis had an obvious corollary. If breast cancer
relapsed due to the inadequacy of the original surgical excisions, then
even more breast tissue should be removed during the initial operation.
Since the margins of extirpation were the problem, then why not extend
the margins? Moore argued that surgeons, attempting to spare women the
disfiguring (and often life-threatening) surgery were exercising
“mistaken kindness”—letting cancer get the better of their knives. In
Germany, Halsted had seen Volkmann remove not just the breast, but a
thin, fanlike muscle spread out immediately under the breast called the
pectoralis minor, in the hopes of cleaning out the minor fragments of
leftover cancer.</p>
<p>Halsted took this line of reasoning to its next inevitable step.
Volkmann may have run into a wall; Halsted would excavate his way past
it. Instead of stripping away the thin pectoralis minor, which had
little function, Halsted decided to dig even deeper into the breast
cavity, cutting through the pectoralis major, the large, prominent
muscle responsible for moving the shoulder and the hand. Halsted was not
alone in this innovation: Willy Meyer, a surgeon operating in New York,
independently arrived at the same operation in the 1890s. Halsted called
this procedure the “radical mastectomy,” using the word radical in the
original Latin sense to mean “root”; he was uprooting cancer from its
very source.</p>
<p>But Halsted, evidently scornful of “mistaken kindness,” did not stop
his surgery at the pectoralis major. When cancer still recurred despite
his radical mastectomy, he began to cut even farther into the chest. By
1898, Halsted’s mastectomy had taken what he called “an even more
radical” turn. Now he began to slice through the collarbone, reaching
for a small cluster of lymph nodes that lay just underneath it. “We
clean out or strip the supraclavicular fossa with very few exceptions,”
he announced at a surgical conference, reinforcing the notion that
conservative, nonradical surgery left the breast somehow “unclean.”</p>
<p>At Hopkins, Halsted’s diligent students now raced to outpace their
master with their own scalpels. Joseph Bloodgood, one of Halsted’s first
surgical residents, had started to cut farther into the neck to evacuate
a chain of glands that lay above the collarbone. Harvey Cushing, another
star apprentice, even “cleaned out the anterior mediastinum,” the deep
lymph nodes buried inside the chest. “It is likely,” Halsted noted,
“that we shall, in the near future, remove the mediastinal contents at
some of our primary operations.” A macabre marathon was in progress.
Halsted and his disciples would rather evacuate the entire contents of
the body than be faced with cancer recurrences. In Europe, one surgeon
evacuated three ribs and other parts of the rib cage and amputated a
shoulder and a collarbone from a woman with breast cancer.</p>
<p>Halsted acknowledged the “physical penalty” of his operation; the
mammoth mastectomies permanently disfigured the bodies of his patients.
With the pectoralis major cut off, the shoulders caved inward as if in a
perpetual shrug, making it impossible to move the arm forward or
sideways. Removing the lymph nodes under the armpit often disrupted the
flow of lymph, causing the arm to swell up with accumulated fluid like
an elephant’s leg, a condition he vividly called “surgical
elephantiasis.” Recuperation from surgery often took patients months,
even years. Yet Halsted accepted all these consequences as if they were
the inevitable war wounds in an all-out battle. “The patient was a young
lady whom I was loath to disfigure,” he wrote with genuine concern,
describing an operation extending all the way into the neck that he had
performed in the 1890s. Something tender, almost paternal, appears in
his surgical notes, with outcomes scribbled alongside personal
reminiscences. “Good use of arm. Chops wood with it . . . no swelling,”
he wrote at the end of one case. “Married, Four Children,” he scribbled
in the margins of another.</p>
<p>But did the Halsted mastectomy save lives? Did radical surgery cure
breast cancer? Did the young woman that he was so “loath to disfigure”
benefit from the surgery that had disfigured her?</p>
<p>Before answering those questions, it’s worthwhile understanding the
milieu in which the radical mastectomy flourished. In the 1870s, when
Halsted had left for Europe to learn from the great masters of the art,
surgery was a discipline emerging from its adolescence. By 1898, it had
transformed into a profession booming with self-confidence, a discipline
so swooningly self-impressed with its technical abilities that great
surgeons unabashedly imagined themselves as showmen. The operating room
was called an operating theater, and surgery was an elaborate
performance often watched by a tense, hushed audience of observers from
an oculus above the theater. To watch Halsted operate, one observer
wrote in 1898, was to watch the “performance of an artist close akin to
the patient and minute labor of a Venetian or Florentine intaglio cutter
or a master worker in mosaic.” Halsted welcomed the technical challenges
of his operation, often conflating the most difficult cases with the
most curable: “I find myself inclined to welcome largeness [of a
tumor],” he wrote—challenging cancer to duel with his knife.</p>
<p>But the immediate technical success of surgery was not a predictor of
its long-term success, its ability to decrease the relapse of cancer.
Halsted’s mastectomy may have been a Florentine mosaic worker’s
operation, but if cancer was a chronic relapsing disease, then perhaps
cutting it away, even with Halsted’s intaglio precision, was not enough.
To determine whether Halsted had truly cured breast cancer, one needed
to track not immediate survival, or even survival over five or ten
months, but survival over five or ten years.</p>
<p>The procedure had to be put to a test by following patients
longitudinally in time. So, in the mid-1890s, at the peak of his
surgical career, Halsted began to collect long-term statistics to show
that his operation was the superior choice. By then, the radical
mastectomy was more than a decade old. Halsted had operated on enough
women and extracted enough tumors to create what he called an entire
“cancer storehouse” at Hopkins.</p>
<p>Halsted would almost certainly have been right in his theory of
radical surgery: that attacking even small cancers with aggressive local
surgery was the best way to achieve a cure. But there was a deep
conceptual error. Imagine a population in which breast cancer occurs at
a fixed incidence, say 1 percent per year. The tumors, however,
demonstrate a spectrum of behavior right from their inception. In some
women, by the time the disease has been diagnosed the tumor has already
spread beyond the breast: there is metastatic cancer in the bones,
lungs, and liver. In other women, the cancer is confined to the breast,
or to the breast and a few nodes; it is truly a local disease.</p>
<p>Position Halsted now, with his scalpel and sutures, in the middle of
this population, ready to perform his radical mastectomy on any woman
with breast cancer. Halsted’s ability to cure patients with breast
cancer obviously depends on the sort of cancer—the stage of breast
cancer—that he confronts. The woman with the metastatic cancer is not
going to be cured by a radical mastectomy, no matter how aggressively
and meticulously Halsted extirpates the tumor in her breast: her cancer
is no longer a local problem. In contrast, the woman with the small,
confined cancer does benefit from the operation—but for her, a far less
aggressive procedure, a local mastectomy, would have done just as well.
Halsted’s mastectomy is thus a peculiar misfit in both cases; it
underestimates its target in the first case and overestimates it in the
second. In both cases, women are forced to undergo indiscriminate,
disfiguring, and morbid operations—too much, too early for the woman
with local breast cancer, and too little, too late, for the woman with
metastatic cancer.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1898, Halsted attended the annual conference of the
American Surgical Association in New Orleans. On the second day, before
a hushed and eager audience of surgeons, he rose to the podium armed
with figures and tables showcasing his highly anticipated data. At first
glance, his observations were astounding: his mastectomy had
outperformed every other surgeon’s operation in terms of local
recurrence. At Baltimore, Halsted had slashed the rate of local
recurrence to a bare few percent, a drastic improvement on Volkmann’s or
Billroth’s numbers. Just as Halsted had promised, he had seemingly
exterminated cancer at its root.</p>
<p>But if one looked closely, the roots had persisted. The evidence for
a true cure of breast cancer was much more disappointing. Of the
seventy-six patients with breast cancer treated with the “radical
method,” only forty had survived for more than three years. Thirty-six,
or nearly half the original number, had died within three years of the
surgery—consumed by a disease supposedly “uprooted” from the body.</p>
<p>But Halsted and his students remained unfazed. Rather than address
the real question raised by the data—did radical mastectomy truly extend
lives?—they clutched to their theories even more adamantly. A surgeon
should “operate on the neck in every case,” Halsted emphasized in New
Orleans. Where others might have seen reason for caution, Halsted only
saw opportunity: “I fail to see why the neck involvement in itself is
more serious than the axillary [area]. The neck can be cleaned out as
thoroughly as the axilla.”</p>
<p>In the summer of 1907, Halsted presented more data to the American
Surgical Association in Washington, D.C. He divided his patients into
three groups based on whether the cancer had spread before surgery to
lymph nodes in the axilla or the neck. When he put up his survival
tables, a pattern became apparent. Of the sixty patients with no
cancer-afflicted nodes in the axilla or the neck, the substantial number
of forty-five had been cured of breast cancer at five years. Of the
forty patients with such nodes, only three had survived.</p>
<p>The ultimate survival from breast cancer, in short, had little to do
with how extensively a surgeon operated on the breast; it depended on
how extensively the cancer had spread before surgery. As George Crile,
one of the most fervent critics of radical surgery, later put it, “If
the disease was so advanced that one had to get rid of the muscles in
order to get rid of the tumor, then it had already spread through the
system”—making the whole operation moot.</p>
<p>But if Halsted came to the brink of this realization in 1907, he just
as emphatically shied away from it. He relapsed to stale aphorisms. “But
even without the proof which we offer, it is, I think, incumbent upon
the surgeon to perform in many cases the supraclavicular operation,” he
advised in one paper. By now the perpetually changing landscape of
breast cancer was beginning to tire him out. Trials, tables, and charts
had never been his forte; he was a surgeon, not a bookkeeper. “It is
especially true of mammary cancer,” he wrote, “that the surgeon
interested in furnishing the best statistics may in perfectly honorable
ways provide them.” That statement—almost vulgar by Halsted’s
standards—exemplified his growing skepticism about putting his own
operation to a test. He instinctively knew that he had come to the far
edge of his understanding of this amorphous illness that was constantly
slipping out of his reach.</p>
<p>The 1907 paper was to be Halsted’s last and most comprehensive
discussion on breast cancer. He wanted new and open anatomical vistas
where he could practice his technically brilliant procedures in peace,
not debates about the measurement and remeasurement of end points of
surgery. Never having commanded a particularly good bedside manner, he
retreated fully into his cloistered operating room and into the vast,
cold library of his mansion. He had already moved on to other organs—the
thorax, the thyroid, the great arteries—where he continued to make
brilliant surgical innovations. But he never wrote another scholarly
analysis of the majestic and flawed operation that bore his name.</p>
<p>Between 1891 and 1907—in the sixteen hectic years that stretched from
the tenuous debut of the radical mastectomy in Baltimore to its
center-stage appearances at vast surgical conferences around the
nation—the quest for a cure for cancer took a great leap forward and an
equally great step back. Halsted proved beyond any doubt that massive,
meticulous surgeries were technically possible in breast cancer. These
operations could drastically reduce the risk for the local recurrence of
a deadly disease. But what Halsted could not prove, despite his most
strenuous efforts, was far more revealing. After nearly two decades of
data gathering, having been levitated, praised, analyzed, and reanalyzed
in conference after conference, the superiority of radical surgery in
“curing” cancer still stood on shaky ground. More surgery had just not
translated into more effective therapy.</p>
<p>Yet all this uncertainty did little to stop other surgeons from
operating just as aggressively. “Radicalism” became a psychological
obsession, burrowing its way deeply into cancer surgery. Even the word
radical was a seductive conceptual trap. Halsted had used it in the
Latin sense of “root” because his operation was meant to dig out the
buried, subterranean roots of cancer. But radical also meant
“aggressive,” “innovative,” and “brazen,” and it was this meaning that
left its mark on the imaginations of patients. What man or woman,
confronting cancer, would willingly choose nonradical, or
“conservative,” surgery?</p>
<p>Indeed, radicalism became central not only to how surgeons saw
cancer, but also in how they imagined themselves. “With no protest from
any other quarter and nothing to stand in its way, the practice of
radical surgery,” one historian wrote, “soon fossilized into dogma.”
When heroic surgery failed to match its expectations, some surgeons
began to shrug off the responsibility of a cure altogether.
“Undoubtedly, if operated upon properly the condition may be cured
locally, and that is the only point for which the surgeon must hold
himself responsible,” one of Halsted’s disciples announced at a
conference in Baltimore in 1931. The best a surgeon could do, in other
words, was to deliver the most technically perfect operation. Curing
cancer was someone else’s problem.</p>
<p>This trajectory toward more and more brazenly aggressive
operations—“the more radical the better”—mirrored the overall path of
surgical thinking of the early 1930s. In Chicago, the surgeon Alexander
Brunschwig devised an operation for cervical cancer, called a “complete
pelvic exenteration,” so strenuous and exhaustive that even the most
Halstedian surgeon needed to break midprocedure to rest and change
positions. The New York surgeon George Pack was nicknamed Pack the Knife
(after the popular song “Mack the Knife”), as if the surgeon and his
favorite instrument had, like some sort of ghoulish centaur, somehow
fused into the same creature.</p>
<p>Cure was a possibility now flung far into the future. “Even in its
widest sense,” an English surgeon wrote in 1929, “the measure of
operability depend[s] on the question: ‘Is the lesion removable?’ and
not on the question: ‘Is the removal of the lesion going to cure the
patient?’” Surgeons often counted themselves lucky if their patients
merely survived these operations. “There is an old Arabian proverb,” a
group of surgeons wrote at the end of a particularly chilling discussion
of stomach cancer in 1933, “that he is no physician who has not slain
many patients, and the surgeon who operates for carcinoma of the stomach
must remember that often.”</p>
<p>To arrive at that sort of logic—the Hippocratic oath turned upside
down—demands either a terminal desperation or a terminal optimism. In
the 1930s, the pendulum of cancer surgery swung desperately between
those two points. Halsted, Brunschwig, and Pack persisted with their
mammoth operations because they genuinely believed that they could
relieve the dreaded symptoms of cancer. But they lacked formal proof,
and as they went further up the isolated promontories of their own
beliefs, proof became irrelevant and trials impossible to run. The more
fervently surgeons believed in the inherent good of their operations,
the more untenable it became to put these to a formal scientific trial.
Radical surgery thus drew the blinds of circular logic around itself for
nearly a century.</p>
<p>The allure and glamour of radical surgery overshadowed crucial
developments in less radical surgical procedures for cancer that were
evolving in its penumbra. Halsted’s students fanned out to invent new
procedures to extirpate cancers. Each was “assigned” an organ. Halsted’s
confidence in his heroic surgical training program was so supreme that
he imagined his students capable of confronting and annihilating cancer
in any organ system. In 1897, having intercepted a young surgical
resident, Hugh Hampton Young, in a corridor at Hopkins, Halsted asked
him to become the head of the new department of urological surgery.
Young protested that he knew nothing about urological surgery. “I know
you didn’t know anything,” Halsted replied curtly, “but we believe that
you can learn”—and walked on.</p>
<p>Inspired by Halsted’s confidence, Young delved into surgery for
urological cancers—cancers of the prostate, kidney, and bladder. In
1904, with Halsted as his assistant, Young successfully devised an
operation for prostate cancer by excising the entire gland. Although
called the radical prostatectomy in the tradition of Halsted, Hampton’s
surgery was rather conservative by comparison. He did not remove
muscles, lymph nodes, or bone. He retained the notion of the en bloc
removal of the organ from radical surgery, but stopped short of
evacuating the entire pelvis or extirpating the urethra or the bladder.
(A modification of this procedure is still used to remove localized
prostate cancer, and it cures a substantial portion of patients with
such tumors.)</p>
<p>Harvey Cushing, Halsted’s student and chief surgical resident,
concentrated on the brain. By the early 1900s, Cushing had found
ingenious ways to surgically extract brain tumors, including the
notorious glioblastomas—tumors so heavily crisscrossed with blood
vessels that they could hemorrhage any minute, and meningiomas wrapped
like sheaths around delicate and vital structures in the brain. Like
Young, Cushing inherited Haslted’s intaglio surgical technique—“the slow
separation of brain from tumor, working now here, now there, leaving
small, flattened pads of hot, wrung-out cotton to control oozing”—but
not Halsted’s penchant for radical surgery. Indeed Cushing found radical
operations on brain tumors not just difficult, but inconceivable: even
if he desired it, a surgeon could not extirpate the entire organ.</p>
<p>In 1933, at the Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, yet another surgical
innovator, Evarts Graham, pioneered an operation to remove a lung
afflicted with cancer by piecing together prior operations that had been
used to remove tubercular lungs. Graham, too, retained the essential
spirit of Halstedian surgery: the meticulous excision of the organ en
bloc and the cutting of wide margins around the tumor to prevent local
recurrences. But he tried to sidestep its pitfalls. Resisting the
temptation to excise more and more tissue—lymph nodes throughout the
thorax, major blood vessels, or the adjacent fascia around the trachea
and esophagus—he removed just the lung, keeping the specimen as intact
as possible.</p>
<p>Even so, obsessed with Halstedian theory and unable to see beyond its
realm, surgeons sharply berated such attempts at nonradical surgery. A
surgical procedure that did not attempt to obliterate cancer from the
body was pooh-poohed as a “makeshift operation.” To indulge in such
makeshift operations was to succumb to the old flaw of “mistaken
kindness” that a generation of surgeons had tried so diligently to
banish.</p>
