<h4 id="the-hard-tube-and-the-weak-light">The Hard Tube and the Weak
Light</h4>
<p>We have found in [X-rays] a cure for the malady.</p>
<p>—Los Angeles Times, April 6, 1902</p>
<p>By way of illustration [of the destructive power of X-rays] let us
recall that nearly all pioneers in the medical X-ray laboratories in the
United States died of cancers induced by the burns.</p>
<p>—The Washington Post, 1945</p>
<p>In late October 1895, a few months after Halsted had unveiled the
radical mastectomy in Baltimore, Wilhelm Röntgen, a lecturer at the
Würzburg Institute in Germany, was working with an electron tube—a
vacuum tube that shot electrons from one electrode to another—when he
noticed a strange leakage. The radiant energy was powerful and
invisible, capable of penetrating layers of blackened cardboard and
producing a white phosphorescent glow on a barium screen accidentally
left on a bench in the room.</p>
<p>Röntgen whisked his wife, Anna, into the lab and placed her hand
between the source of his rays and a photographic plate. The rays
penetrated through her hand and left a silhouette of her finger bones
and her metallic wedding ring on the photographic plate—the inner
anatomy of a hand seen as if through a magical lens. “I have seen my
death,” Anna said—but her husband saw something else: a form of energy
so powerful that it could pass through most living tissues. Röntgen
called his form of light X-rays.</p>
<p>At first, X-rays were thought to be an artificial quirk of energy
produced by electron tubes. But in 1896, just a few months after
Röntgen’s discovery, Henri Becquerel, the French chemist, who knew of
Röntgen’s work, discovered that certain natural materials—uranium among
them—autonomously emitted their own invisible rays with properties
similar to those of X-rays. In Paris, friends of Becquerel’s, a young
physicist-chemist couple named Pierre and Marie Curie, began to scour
the natural world for even more powerful chemical sources of X-rays.
Pierre and Marie (then Maria Skłodowska, a penniless Polish immigrant
living in a garret in Paris) had met at the Sorbonne and been drawn to
each other because of a common interest in magnetism. In the mid-1880s,
Pierre Curie had used minuscule quartz crystals to craft an instrument
called an electrometer, capable of measuring exquisitely small doses of
energy. Using this device, Marie had shown that even tiny amounts of
radiation emitted by uranium ores could be quantified. With their new
measuring instrument for radioactivity, Marie and Pierre began hunting
for new sources of X-rays. Another monumental journey of scientific
discovery was thus launched with measurement.</p>
<p>In a waste ore called pitchblende, a black sludge that came from the
peaty forests of Joachimsthal in what is now the Czech Republic, the
Curies found the first signal of a new element—an element many times
more radioactive than uranium. The Curies set about distilling the boggy
sludge to trap that potent radioactive source in its purest form. From
several tons of pitchblende, four hundred tons of washing water, and
hundreds of buckets of distilled sludge waste, they finally fished out
one-tenth of a gram of the new element in 1902. The metal lay on the far
edge of the periodic table, emitting X-rays with such feverish intensity
that it glowered with a hypnotic blue light in the dark, consuming
itself. Unstable, it was a strange chimera between matter and
energy—matter decomposing into energy. Marie Curie called the new
element radium, from the Greek word for “light.”</p>
<p>Radium, by virtue of its potency, revealed a new and unexpected
property of X-rays: they could not only carry radiant energy through
human tissues, but also deposit energy deep inside tissues. Röntgen had
been able to photograph his wife’s hand because of the first property:
his X-rays had traversed through flesh and bone and left a shadow of the
tissue on the film. Marie Curie’s hands, in contrast, bore the painful
legacy of the second effect: having distilled pitchblende into a
millionth part for week after week in the hunt for purer and purer
radioactivity, the skin in her palm had begun to chafe and peel off in
blackened layers, as if the tissue had been burnt from the inside. A few
milligrams of radium left in a vial in Pierre’s pocket scorched through
the heavy tweed of his waistcoat and left a permanent scar on his chest.
One man who gave “magical” demonstrations at a public fair with a leaky,
unshielded radium machine developed swollen and blistered lips, and his
cheeks and nails fell out. Radiation would eventually burn into Marie
Curie’s bone marrow, leaving her permanently anemic.</p>
<p>It would take biologists decades to fully decipher the mechanism that
lay behind these effects, but the spectrum of damaged tissues—skin,
lips, blood, gums, and nails—already provided an important clue: radium
was attacking DNA. DNA is an inert molecule, exquisitely resistant to
most chemical reactions, for its job is to maintain the stability of
genetic information. But X-rays can shatter strands of DNA or generate
toxic chemicals that corrode DNA. Cells respond to this damage by dying
or, more often, by ceasing to divide. X-rays thus preferentially kill
the most rapidly proliferating cells in the body, cells in the skin,
nails, gums, and blood.</p>
<p>This ability of X-rays to selectively kill rapidly dividing cells did
not go unnoticed—especially by cancer researchers. In 1896, barely a
year after Röntgen had discovered his X-rays, a twenty-one-year-old
Chicago medical student, Emil Grubbe, had the inspired notion of using
X-rays to treat cancer. Flamboyant, adventurous, and fiercely inventive,
Grubbe had worked in a factory in Chicago that produced vacuum X-ray
tubes, and he had built a crude version of a tube for his own
experiments. Having encountered X-ray-exposed factory workers with
peeling skin and nails—his own hands had also become chapped and swollen
from repeated exposures—Grubbe quickly extended the logic of this cell
death to tumors.</p>
<p>On March 29, 1896, in a tube factory on Halsted Street (the name
bears no connection to Halsted the surgeon) in Chicago, Grubbe began to
bombard Rose Lee, an elderly woman with breast cancer, with radiation
using an improvised X-ray tube. Lee’s cancer had relapsed after a
mastectomy, and the tumor had exploded into a painful mass in her
breast. She had been referred to Grubbe as a last-ditch measure, more to
satisfy his experimental curiosity than to provide any clinical benefit.
Grubbe looked through the factory for something to cover the rest of the
breast, and finding no sheet of metal, wrapped Lee’s chest in some
tinfoil that he found in the bottom of a Chinese tea box. He irradiated
her cancer every night for eighteen consecutive days. The treatment was
painful—but somewhat successful. The tumor in Lee’s breast ulcerated,
tightened, and shrank, producing the first documented local response in
the history of X-ray therapy. A few months after the initial treatment,
though, Lee became dizzy and nauseated. The cancer had metastasized to
her spine, brain, and liver, and she died shortly after. Grubbe had
stumbled on another important observation: X-rays could only be used to
treat cancer locally, with little effect on tumors that had already
metastasized.*</p>
<p>Inspired by the response, even if it had been temporary, Grubbe began
using X-ray therapy to treat scores of other patients with local tumors.
A new branch of cancer medicine, radiation oncology, was born, with
X-ray clinics mushrooming up in Europe and America. By the early 1900s,
less than a decade after Röntgen’s discovery, doctors waxed ecstatic
about the possibility of curing cancer with radiation. “I believe this
treatment is an absolute cure for all forms of cancer,” a Chicago
physician noted in 1901. “I do not know what its limitations are.”</p>
<p>With the Curies’ discovery of radium in 1902, surgeons could beam
thousandfold more powerful bursts of energy on tumors. Conferences and
societies on high-dose radiation therapy were organized in a flurry of
excitement. Radium was infused into gold wires and stitched directly
into tumors, to produce even higher local doses of X-rays. Surgeons
implanted radon pellets into abdominal tumors. By the 1930s and ’40s,
America had a national surplus of radium, so much so that it was being
advertised for sale to laypeople in the back pages of journals.
Vacuum-tube technology advanced in parallel; by the mid-1950s variants
of these tubes could deliver blisteringly high doses of X-ray energy
into cancerous tissues.</p>
<p>Radiation therapy catapulted cancer medicine into its atomic age—an
age replete with both promise and peril. Certainly, the vocabulary, the
images, and the metaphors bore the potent symbolism of atomic power
unleashed on cancer. There were “cyclotrons” and “supervoltage rays” and
“linear accelerators” and “neutron beams.” One man was asked to think of
his X-ray therapy as “millions of tiny bullets of energy.” Another
account of a radiation treatment is imbued with the thrill and horror of
a space journey: “The patient is put on a stretcher that is placed in
the oxygen chamber. As a team of six doctors, nurses, and technicians
hover at chamber-side, the radiologist maneuvers a betatron into
position. After slamming shut a hatch at the end of the chamber,
technicians force oxygen in. After fifteen minutes under full pressure .
. . the radiologist turns on the betatron and shoots radiation at the
tumor. Following treatment, the patient is decompressed in
deep-sea-diver fashion and taken to the recovery room.”</p>
<p>Stuffed into chambers, herded in and out of hatches, hovered upon,
monitored through closed-circuit television, pressurized, oxygenated,
decompressed, and sent back to a room to recover, patients weathered the
onslaught of radiation therapy as if it were an invisible
benediction.</p>
<p>And for certain forms of cancer, it was a benediction. Like surgery,
radiation was remarkably effective at obliterating locally confined
cancers. Breast tumors were pulverized with X-rays. Lymphoma lumps
melted away. One woman with a brain tumor woke up from her yearlong coma
to watch a basketball game in her hospital room.</p>
<p>But like surgery, radiation medicine also struggled against its
inherent limits. Emil Grubbe had already encountered the first of these
limits with his earliest experimental treatments: since X-rays could
only be directed locally, radiation was of limited use for cancers that
had metastasized.* One could double and quadruple the doses of radiant
energy, but this did not translate into more cures. Instead,
indiscriminate irradiation left patients scarred, blinded, and scalded
by doses that had far exceeded tolerability.</p>
<p>The second limit was far more insidious: radiation produced cancers.
The very effect of X-rays killing rapidly dividing cells—DNA damage—also
created cancer-causing mutations in genes. In the 1910s, soon after the
Curies had discovered radium, a New Jersey corporation called U.S.
Radium began to mix radium with paint to create a product called
Undark—radium-infused paint that emitted a greenish white light at
night. Although aware of the many injurious effects of radium, U.S.
Radium promoted Undark for clock dials, boasting of glow-in-the-dark
watches. Watch painting was a precise and artisanal craft, and young
women with nimble, steady hands were commonly employed. These women were
encouraged to use the paint without precautions, and to frequently lick
the brushes with their tongues to produce sharp lettering on
watches.</p>
<p>Radium workers soon began to complain of jaw pain, fatigue, and skin
and tooth problems. In the late 1920s, medical investigations revealed
that the bones in their jaws had necrosed, their tongues had been
scarred by irradiation, and many had become chronically anemic (a sign
of severe bone marrow damage). Some women, tested with radioactivity
counters, were found to be glowing with radioactivity. Over the next
decades, dozens of radium-induced tumors sprouted in these
radium-exposed workers—sarcomas and leukemias, and bone, tongue, neck,
and jaw tumors. In 1927, a group of five severely afflicted women in New
Jersey—collectively termed “Radium girls” by the media—sued U.S. Radium.
None of them had yet developed cancers; they were suffering from the
more acute effects of radium toxicity—jaw, skin, and tooth necrosis. A
year later, the case was settled out of court with a compensation of
0,000 each to the girls, and 00 per year to cover living and medical
expenses. The “compensation” was not widely collected. Many of the
Radium girls, too weak even to raise their hands to take an oath in
court, died of leukemia and other cancers soon after their case was
settled.</p>
<p>Marie Curie died of leukemia in July 1934. Emil Grubbe, who had been
exposed to somewhat weaker X-rays, also succumbed to the deadly late
effects of chronic radiation. By the mid-1940s, Grubbe’s fingers had
been amputated one by one to remove necrotic and gangrenous bones, and
his face was cut up in repeated operations to remove radiation-induced
tumors and premalignant warts. In 1960, at the age of eighty-five, he
died in Chicago, with multiple forms of cancer that had spread
throughout his body.</p>
<p>The complex intersection of radiation with cancer—cancer-curing at
times, cancer-causing at others—dampened the initial enthusiasm of
cancer scientists. Radiation was a powerful invisible knife—but still a
knife. And a knife, no matter how deft or penetrating, could only reach
so far in the battle against cancer. A more discriminating therapy was
needed, especially for cancers that were nonlocalized.</p>
<p>In 1932, Willy Meyer, the New York surgeon who had invented the
radical mastectomy contemporaneously with Halsted, was asked to address
the annual meeting of the American Surgical Association. Gravely ill and
bedridden, Meyer knew he would be unable to attend the meeting, but he
forwarded a brief, six-paragraph speech to be presented. On May 31, six
weeks after Meyer’s death, his letter was read aloud to the roomful of
surgeons. There is, in that letter, an unfailing recognition that cancer
medicine had reached some terminus, that a new direction was needed. “If
a biological systemic after-treatment were added in every instance,”
Meyer wrote, “we believe the majority of such patients would remain
cured after a properly conducted radical operation.”</p>
<p>Meyer had grasped a deep principle about cancer. Cancer, even when it
begins locally, is inevitably waiting to explode out of its confinement.
By the time many patients come to their doctor, the illness has often
spread beyond surgical control and spilled into the body exactly like
the black bile that Galen had envisioned so vividly nearly two thousand
years ago.</p>
<p>In fact, Galen seemed to have been right after all—in the accidental,
aphoristic way that Democritus had been right about the atom or Erasmus
had made a conjecture about the Big Bang centuries before the discovery
of galaxies. Galen had, of course, missed the actual cause of cancer.
There was no black bile clogging up the body and bubbling out into
tumors in frustration. But he had uncannily captured something essential
about cancer in his dreamy and visceral metaphor. Cancer was often a
humoral disease. Crablike and constantly mobile, it could burrow through
invisible channels from one organ to another. It was a “systemic”
illness, just as Galen had once made it out to be.</p>

X-rays, although with limited success.</p></li>
<li><p>Radiation can be used to control or palliate metastatic tumors in
selected cases, but is rarely curative in these circumstances.</p></li>
