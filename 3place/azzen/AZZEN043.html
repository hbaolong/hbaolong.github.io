<h4 id="no-one-had-labored-in-vain">“No one had labored in vain”</h4>
<p>Have you met Jimmy? . . . Jimmy is any one of thousands of children
with leukemia or any other form of cancer, from the nation or from
around the world.</p>
<p>—Pamphlet for the Jimmy Fund, 1963</p>
<p>In the summer of 1997, a woman named Phyllis Clauson, from Billerica,
Massachusetts, posted a letter to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. She
was writing on behalf of “Jimmy,” Farber’s mascot. It had been nearly
fifty years since Jimmy had arrived at Farber’s clinic in Boston from
upstate Maine with a diagnosis of lymphoma of the intestines. Like all
his ward-mates from the 1950s, Jimmy was presumed long dead.</p>
<p>Not true, Clauson wrote; he was alive and well. Jimmy—Einar
Gustafson—was her brother, a truck driver in Maine with three children.
For five decades, his family had guarded the knowledge of Jimmy’s
identity and his survival. Only Sidney Farber had known; Christmas cards
from Farber had arrived each winter, until Farber himself had died in
1973. Every year, for decades, Clauson and her siblings had sent in
modest donations to the Jimmy Fund, divulging to no one that the
silhouetted face on the solicitation card for contributions was their
brother’s. But with the passage of fifty years, Clauson felt she could
no longer keep the secret in good conscience. “Jimmy’s story,” she
recalled, “had become a story that I could not hold. I knew I had to
write the letter while Einar was still alive.”</p>
<p>Clauson’s letter was nearly thrown into the trash. Jimmy “sightings,”
like Elvis sightings, were reported often, but rarely taken seriously;
all had turned out to be hoaxes. Doctors had informed the Jimmy Fund’s
publicity department that the odds of Jimmy’s having survived were nil,
and that all claims were to be treated with great skepticism. But
Clauson’s letter contained details that could not be waved away. She
wrote of listening to the radio in New Sweden, Maine, in the summer of
1948 to tune in to the Ralph Edwards broadcast. She recalled her
brother’s midwinter trips to Boston that often took two days, with Jimmy
in his baseball uniform lying patiently in the back of a truck.</p>
<p>When Clauson told her brother about the letter that she had sent, she
found him more relieved than annoyed. “It was like an unburdening for
him, too,” she recalled. “Einar was a modest man. He had kept to himself
because he did not want to brag.” (“I would read in the papers that they
had found me someplace,” he said, “and I would smile.”)</p>
<p>Clauson’s letter was spotted by Karen Cummings, an associate in the
Jimmy Fund’s development office, who immediately understood its
potential significance. She contacted Clauson, and then reached
Gustafson.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, in January 1998, Cummings arranged to meet Jimmy
at a truck stop outside a shopping center in a suburb of Boston. It was
six in the morning on a bone-chilling winter day, and Gustafson and his
wife piled into Cummings’s warm car. Cummings had brought a tape of
Jimmy from 1948 singing his favorite song. She played it:</p>
<p>Take me out to the ball game,</p>
<p>Take me out with the crowd.</p>
<p>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack,</p>
<p>I don’t care if I never get back.</p>
<p>Gustafson listened to his own voice with tears in his eyes. Cummings
and Jimmy’s wife sat in the car, their eyes also welling with silent
tears.</p>
<p>Later that month, Cummings drove up to New Sweden, a brutally
beautiful town in northern Maine with austere angular houses set against
an even more austere landscape. Old-timers in the town also recalled
Gustafson’s trips to Boston for chemotherapy. He had hitchhiked to and
from Boston in cars and trucks and delivery vans anytime someone from
the town had driven up or down the coast; it had taken a village to save
a child. As Cummings sat in Gustafson’s kitchen, he crept upstairs and
returned with a cardboard box. Wrapped inside was the battered baseball
uniform that the Boston Braves had given Jimmy on the night of the
Edwards broadcast. Cummings needed no further proof.</p>
<p>And so it was in May 1998, almost exactly fifty years after he had
journeyed from small-town Maine to the Children’s Hospital to meet the
odd, formal doctor in a three-piece suit, that Jimmy returned with full
fanfare to the Jimmy Fund. His wardmates from the hospital—the Sandler
twin with his recalcitrant leukemia engorging his spleen, the blond girl
in plaits by the television, little Jenny with leukemia—had long ago
been buried in small graves in and around Boston. Gustafson walked into
the Jimmy Fund Building,* up the low, long steps to the room where the
clockwork train had run through the mountain tunnel. Patients,
survivors, nurses, and doctors milled around him. Like a latter-day Rip
van Winkle, he found the present unfathomable and unrecognizable.
“Everything has changed,” Clauson recalled him saying. “The rooms, the
patients, the drugs.” But more than anything, survivorship had changed.
“Einar remembered the cancer ward as a place with many curtains,” she
continued. “When the children were well, the curtains would be spread
open. But they would soon close the curtains, and there would be no
child when they were opened again.”</p>
<p>Here Gustafson was, fifty years later, back in those long hallways
with the faded cartoon paintings on the walls, his curtains thrown
apart. It is impossible to know whether Jimmy had survived because of
surgery, or chemotherapy, or because his cancer had been inherently
benign in its behavior. But the facts of his medical history are
irrelevant; his return was symbolic. Jimmy had unwittingly been picked
to become the icon of the child with cancer. But Einar Gustafson, now
sixty-three years old, had returned as the icon of a man beyond
cancer.</p>
<p>The Italian memoirist Primo Levi, who survived a concentration camp
and then navigated his way through a blasted Germany to his native
Turin, often remarked that among the most fatal qualities of the camp
was its ability to erase the idea of a life outside and beyond itself. A
person’s past and his present were annihilated as a matter of course—to
be in the camps was to abnegate history, identity, and personality—but
it was the erasure of the future that was the most chilling. With that
annihilation, Levi wrote, came a moral and spiritual death that
perpetuated the status quo of imprisonment. If no life existed beyond
the camp, then the distorted logic by which the camp operated became
life as usual.</p>
<p>Cancer is not a concentration camp, but it shares the quality of
annihilation: it negates the possibility of life outside and beyond
itself; it subsumes all living. The daily life of a patient becomes so
intensely preoccupied with his or her illness that the world fades away.
Every last morsel of energy is spent tending the disease. “How to
overcome him became my obsession,” the journalist Max Lerner wrote of
the lymphoma in his spleen. “If it was to be a combat then I had to
engage it with everything I had—knowledge and guile, ways covert as well
as overt.”</p>
<p>For Carla, in the midst of the worst phase of her chemotherapy, the
day-to-day rituals of survival utterly blotted out any thought of
survivorship in the long run. When I asked a woman with a rare form of
muscle sarcoma about her life outside the hospital, she told me that she
spent her days and nights scouring the Internet for news about the
disease. “I am in the hospital,” she said, “even when I am outside the
hospital.” The poet Jason Shinder wrote, “Cancer is a tremendous
opportunity to have your face pressed right up against the glass of your
mortality.” But what patients see through the glass is not a world
outside cancer, but a world taken over by it—cancer reflected endlessly
around them like a hall of mirrors.</p>
<p>I was not immune to this compulsive preoccupation either. In the
summer of 2005, as my fellowship hurtled to its end, I experienced
perhaps the singularly transformative event of my life: the birth of my
daughter. Glowing, beautiful, and cherubic, Leela was born on a warm
night at Massachusetts General Hospital, then swaddled in blankets and
brought to the newborn unit on the fourteenth floor. The unit is
directly across from the cancer ward. (The apposition of the two is
hardly a coincidence. As a medical procedure, childbirth is least likely
to involve infectious complications and is thus the safest neighbor to a
chemotherapy ward, where any infection can turn into a lethal rampage.
As in so much in medicine, the juxtaposition between the two wards is
purely functional and yet just as purely profound.)</p>
<p>I would like to see myself at my wife’s side awaiting the miraculous
moment of my daughter’s birth as most fathers do. But in truth I was
gowned and gloved like a surgeon, with a blue, sterile sheet spread out
in front of me, and a long syringe in my hands, poised to harvest the
maroon gush of blood cells from the umbilical cord. When I cut that
cord, part of me was the father, but the other part an oncologist.
Umbilical blood contains one of the richest known sources of
blood-forming stem cells—cells that can be stored away in cryobanks and
used for a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia in the future, an
intensely precious resource often flushed down a sink in hospitals after
childbirth.</p>
<p>The midwives rolled their eyes; the obstetrician, an old friend,
asked jokingly if I ever stopped thinking about work. But I was too far
steeped in the study of blood to ignore my instincts. In the
bone-marrow-transplant rooms across that very hallway were patients for
whom I had scoured tissue banks across the nation for one or two pints
of these stem cells that might save their lives. Even in this most
life-affirming of moments, the shadows of malignancy—and death—were
forever lurking on my psyche.</p>
<p>But not everything was involuting into death. Something
transformative was also happening in the fellows’ clinics in the summer
of 2005: many of my patients, whose faces had so fixedly been pressed up
against the glass of their mortality, began to glimpse an afterlife
beyond cancer. February, as I said before, had marked the midpoint of an
abysmal descent. Cancer had reached its full, lethal bloom that month.
Nearly every week had brought news of a mounting toll, culminating
chillingly with Steve Harmon’s arrival in the emergency room and his
devastating spiral into death thereafter. Some days I dreaded walking by
the fax machines outside my office, where a pile of death certificates
would be waiting for my signature.</p>
<p>But then, like a poisonous tide receding, the bad news ebbed. The
nightly phone calls from the hospitals or from ERs and hospice units
around Boston bringing news of yet another death (“I’m calling to let
you know that your patient arrived here this evening with dizziness and
difficulty breathing”) suddenly ceased. It was as if the veil of death
had lifted—and survivors had emerged from underneath.</p>
<p>Ben Orman had been definitively cured of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It had
not been an effortless voyage. His blood counts had dropped calamitously
during the midcycle of chemotherapy. For a few weeks it had appeared
that the lymphoma had ceased responding—a poor prognostic sign
portending a therapy-resistant, fatal variant of the disease. But in the
end the mass in his neck, and the larger archipelago of masses in his
chest, had all melted away, leaving just minor remnants of scar tissue.
The formality of his demeanor had visibly relaxed. When I last saw him
in the summer of 2005, he spoke about moving away from Boston to Los
Angeles to join a law firm. He assured me that he would visit to follow
up, but I wasn’t convinced. Orman epitomized the afterlife of
cancer—eager to forget the clinic and its bleak rituals, like a bad trip
to a foreign country.</p>
<p>Katherine Fitz could also see a life beyond cancer. For Fitz, with
the lung tumor wrapped ominously around her bronchus, the biggest hurdle
had been the local control of her cancer. The mass had been excised in
an incredibly meticulous surgery; she had then finished adjuvant
chemotherapy and radiation. Nearly twelve months after the surgery,
there was no sign of a local relapse. Nor was there any sign of the
woman who had come to the clinic several months earlier, nearly folded
over in fear. Tumor out, chemotherapy done, radiation behind her, Fitz’s
effervescence poured out of every spigot of her soul. At times, watching
her personality emerge as if through a nozzle, it seemed abundantly
clear why the Greeks had thought of disease as pathological blockades of
humors.</p>
<p>Carla returned to see me in July 2005, bringing pictures of her three
growing children. She refused to let another doctor perform her bone
marrow biopsy, so I walked over from the lab on a warm morning to
perform the procedure. She looked relieved when she saw me, greeting me
with her anxious half-smile. We had developed a ritualistic
relationship; who was I to desecrate a lucky ritual? The biopsy revealed
no leukemia in the bone marrow. Her remission, for now, was still
intact.</p>
<p>I have chosen these cases not because they were “miraculous” but
because of precisely the opposite reason. They represent a routine
spectrum of survivors—Hodgkin’s disease cured with multidrug
chemotherapy; locally advanced lung cancer controlled with surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation; lymphoblastic leukemia in a prolonged
remission after intensive chemotherapy. To me, these were miracles
enough. It is an old complaint about the practice of medicine that it
inures you to the idea of death. But when medicine inures you to the
idea of life, to survival, then it has failed utterly. The novelist
Thomas Wolfe, recalling a lifelong struggle with illness, wrote in his
last letter, “I’ve made a long voyage and been to a strange country, and
I’ve seen the dark man very close.” I had not made the journey myself,
and I had only seen the darkness reflected in the eyes of others. But
surely, it was the most sublime moment of my clinical life to have
watched that voyage in reverse, to encounter men and women returning
from the strange country—to see them so very close, clambering back.</p>
<p>Incremental advances can add up to transformative changes. In 2005,
an avalanche of papers cascading through the scientific literature
converged on a remarkably consistent message—the national physiognomy of
cancer had subtly but fundamentally changed. The mortality for nearly
every major form of cancer—lung, breast, colon, and prostate—had
continuously dropped for fifteen straight years. There had been no
single, drastic turn but rather a steady and powerful attrition:
mortality had declined by about 1 percent every year. The rate might
sound modest, but its cumulative effect was remarkable: between 1990 and
2005, the cancer-specific death rate had dropped nearly 15 percent, a
decline unprecedented in the history of the disease. The empire of
cancer was still indubitably vast—more than half a million American men
and women died of cancer in 2005—but it was losing power, fraying at its
borders.</p>
<p>What precipitated this steady decline? There was no single answer but
rather a multitude. For lung cancer, the driver of decline was primarily
prevention—a slow attrition in smoking sparked off by the Doll-Hill and
Wynder-Graham studies, fueled by the surgeon general’s report, and
brought to its full boil by a combination of political activism (the FTC
action on warning labels), inventive litigation (the Banzhaf and
Cipollone cases), medical advocacy, and countermarketing (the
antitobacco advertisements).</p>
<p>For colon and cervical cancer, the declines were almost certainly due
to the successes of secondary prevention—cancer screening. Colon cancers
were detected at earlier and earlier stages in their evolution, often in
the premalignant state, and treated with relatively minor surgeries.
Cervical cancer screening using Papanicolaou’s smearing technique was
being offered at primary-care centers throughout the nation, and as with
colon cancer, premalignant lesions were excised using relatively minor
surgeries.</p>
<p>For leukemia, lymphoma, and testicular cancer, in contrast, the
declining numbers reflected the successes of chemotherapeutic treatment.
In childhood ALL, cure rates of 80 percent were routinely being
achieved. Hodgkin’s disease was similarly curable, and so, too, were
some large-cell aggressive lymphomas. Indeed, for Hodgkin’s disease,
testicular cancer, and childhood leukemias, the burning question was not
how much chemotherapy was curative, but how little: trials were
addressing whether milder and less toxic doses of drugs, scaled back
from the original protocols, could achieve equivalent cure rates.</p>
<p>Perhaps most symbolically, the decline in breast cancer mortality
epitomized the cumulative and collaborative nature of these
victories—and the importance of attacking cancer using multiple
independent prongs. Between 1990 and 2005, breast cancer mortality had
dwindled an unprecedented 24 percent. Three interventions had
potentially driven down the breast cancer death rate—mammography
(screening to catch early breast cancer and thereby prevent invasive
breast cancer), surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy after
surgery to remove remnant cancer cells). Donald Berry, a statistician in
Houston, Texas, set out to answer a controversial question: How much had
mammography and chemotherapy independently contributed to survival?
Whose victory was this—a victory of prevention or of therapeutic
intervention?*</p>
<p>Berry’s answer was a long-due emollient to a field beset by squabbles
between the advocates of prevention and the proponents of chemotherapy.
When Berry assessed the effect of each intervention independently using
statistical models, it was a satisfying tie: both cancer prevention and
chemotherapy had diminished breast cancer mortality equally—12 percent
for mammography and 12 percent for chemotherapy, adding up to the
observed 24 percent reduction in mortality. “No one,” as Berry said,
paraphrasing the Bible, “had labored in vain.”</p>
<p>These were all deep, audacious, and meaningful victories borne on the
backs of deep and meaningful labors. But, in truth, they were the
victories of another generation—the results of discoveries made in the
fifties and sixties. The core conceptual advances from which these
treatment strategies arose predated nearly all the significant work on
the cell biology of cancer. In a bewildering spurt over just two
decades, scientists had unveiled a fantastical new world—of errant
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that accelerated and decelerated
growth to unleash cancer; of chromosomes that could be decapitated and
translocated to create new genetic chimeras, of cellular pathways
corrupted to subvert the death of cancer. But the therapeutic advances
that had led to the slow attrition of cancer mortality made no use of
this novel biology of cancer. There was new science on one hand and old
medicine on the other. Mary Lasker had once searched for an epochal
shift in cancer. But the shift that had occurred seemed to belong to
another epoch.</p>
<p>Mary Lasker died of heart failure in 1994 in her carefully curated
home in Connecticut—having removed herself physically from the bristling
epicenters of cancer research and policymaking in Washington, New York,
and Boston. She was ninety-three years old. Her life had nearly spanned
the most transformative and turbulent century of biomedical science. Her
potent ebullience had dimmed in her last decade. She spoke rarely about
the achievements (or disappointments) of the War on Cancer. But she had
expected cancer medicine to have achieved more during her lifetime—to
have taken a more assertive step toward Farber’s “universal cure” for
cancer and marked a more definitive victory in the war. The complexity,
the tenacity—the sheer magisterial force of cancer—had made even its
most committed and resolute opponent seem circumspect and humbled.</p>
<p>In 1994, a few months after Lasker’s death, the cancer geneticist Ed
Harlow captured both the agony and the ecstasy of the era. At the end of
a weeklong conference at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York
pervaded by a giddy sense of anticipation about the spectacular
achievements of cancer biology, Harlow delivered a sobering assessment:
“Our knowledge of . . . molecular defects in cancer has come from a
dedicated twenty years of the best molecular biology research. Yet this
information does not translate to any effective treatments nor to any
understanding of why many of the current treatments succeed or why
others fail. It is a frustrating time.”</p>
<p>More than a decade later, I could sense the same frustration in the
clinic at Mass General. One afternoon, I watched Tom Lynch, the lung
cancer clinician, masterfully encapsulate carcinogenesis, cancer
genetics, and chemotherapy for a new patient, a middle-aged woman with
bronchoalveolar cell cancer. She was a professor of history with a grave
manner and a sharp, darting mind. He sat across from her, scribbling a
picture as he spoke. The cells in her bronchus, he began, had acquired
mutations in their genes that had allowed them to grow autonomously and
uncontrollably. They had formed a local tumor. Their propensity was to
acquire further mutations that might allow them to migrate, to invade
tissues, to metastasize. Chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Taxol (two
standard chemotherapy drugs), augmented with radiation, would kill the
cells and perhaps prevent them from migrating to other organs to seed
metastases. In the best-case scenario, the cells carrying the mutated
genes would die, and her cancer would be cured.</p>
<p>She watched Lynch put his pen down with her quick, sharp eyes. The
explanation sounded logical and organized, but she had caught the glint
of a broken piece in the chain of logic. What was the connection between
this explanation and the therapy being proposed? How, she wanted to
know, would Carboplatin “fix” her mutated genes? How would Taxol know
which cells carried the mutations in order to kill them? How would the
mechanistic explanation of her illness connect with the medical
interventions?</p>
<p>She had captured a disjunction all too familiar to oncologists. For
nearly a decade, practicing cancer medicine had become like living
inside a pressurized can—pushed, on one hand, by the increasing force of
biological clarity about cancer, but then pressed against the wall of
medical stagnation that seemed to have produced no real medicines out of
this biological clarity. In the winter of 1945, Vannevar Bush had
written to President Roosevelt, “The striking advances in medicine
during the war have been possible only because we had a large backlog of
scientific data accumulated through basic research in many scientific
fields in the years before the war.”</p>
<p>For cancer, the “backlog of scientific data” had reached a critical
point. The boil of science, as Bush liked to imagine it, inevitably
produced a kind of steam—an urgent, rhapsodic pressure that could only
find release in technology. Cancer science was begging to find release
