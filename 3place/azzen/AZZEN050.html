<h4 id="atossas-war">Atossa’s War</h4>
<p>We aged a hundred years and this descended</p>
<p>In just one hour, as at a stroke</p>
<p>—Anna Akhmatova,</p>
<p>“In Memoriam, July 19, 1914”</p>
<p>It is time, it is time for me too to depart. Like an old man who has
outlived his contemporaries and feels a sad inner emptiness, Kostoglotov
felt that evening that the ward was no longer his home, even though . .
. there were the same old patients asking the same old questions again
and again as though they had never been asked before: . . . Will they
cure me or won’t they? What other remedies are there that might
help?</p>
<p>—Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Cancer Ward</p>
<p>On May 17, 1973, seven weeks after Sidney Farber’s death in Boston,
Hiram Gans, an old friend, stood up at the memorial service to read some
lines from Swinburne’s “A Forsaken Garden”:</p>
<p>Here now in his triumph where all things falter,</p>
<p>Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,</p>
<p>As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,</p>
<p>Death lies dead.</p>
<p>It was—careful listeners might have noted—a peculiar and deliberate
inversion of the moment. It was cancer that was soon to be dead—its
corpus outstretched and spread-eagled ceremonially on the altar—death
lying dead.</p>
<p>The image belongs very much to Farber and his era, but its essence
still haunts us today. In the end, every biography must also confront
the death of its subject. Is the end of cancer conceivable in the
future? Is it possible to eradicate this disease from our bodies and our
societies forever?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions are embedded in the biology of this
incredible disease. Cancer, we have discovered, is stitched into our
genome. Oncogenes arise from mutations in essential genes that regulate
the growth of cells. Mutations accumulate in these genes when DNA is
damaged by carcinogens, but also by seemingly random errors in copying
genes when cells divide. The former might be preventable, but the latter
is endogenous. Cancer is a flaw in our growth, but this flaw is deeply
entrenched in ourselves. We can rid ourselves of cancer, then, only as
much as we can rid ourselves of the processes in our physiology that
depend on growth—aging, regeneration, healing, reproduction.</p>
<p>Science embodies the human desire to understand nature; technology
couples that desire with the ambition to control nature. These are
related impulses—one might seek to understand nature in order to control
it—but the drive to intervene is unique to technology. Medicine, then,
is fundamentally a technological art; at its core lies a desire to
improve human lives by intervening on life itself. Conceptually, the
battle against cancer pushes the idea of technology to its far edge, for
the object being intervened upon is our genome. It is unclear whether an
intervention that discriminates between malignant and normal growth is
even possible. Perhaps cancer, the scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable
twin to our own scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable cells and genes, is
impossible to disconnect from our bodies. Perhaps cancer defines the
inherent outer limit of our survival. As our cells divide and our bodies
age, and as mutations accumulate inexorably upon mutations, cancer might
well be the final terminus in our development as organisms.</p>
<p>But our goals could be more modest. Above the door to Richard Peto’s
office in Oxford hangs one of Doll’s favorite aphorisms: “Death in old
age is inevitable, but death before old age is not.” Doll’s idea
represents a far more reasonable proximal goal to define success in the
War on Cancer. It is possible that we are fatally conjoined to this
ancient illness, forced to play its cat-and-mouse game for the
foreseeable future of our species. But if cancer deaths can be prevented
before old age, if the terrifying game of treatment, resistance,
recurrence, and more treatment can be stretched out longer and longer,
then it will transform the way we imagine this ancient illness. Given
what we know about cancer, even this would represent a technological
victory unlike any other in our history. It would be a victory over our
own inevitability—a victory over our genomes.</p>
<p>To envision what such a victory might look like, permit a thought
experiment. Recall Atossa, the Persian queen with breast cancer in 500
BC. Imagine her traveling through time—appearing and reappearing in one
age after the next. She is cancer’s Dorian Gray: as she moves through
the arc of history, her tumor, frozen in its stage and behavior, remains
the same. Atossa’s case allows us to recapitulate past advances in
cancer therapy and to consider its future. How has her treatment and
prognosis shifted in the last four thousand years, and what happens to
Atossa later in the new millennium?</p>
<p>First, pitch Atossa backward in time to Imhotep’s clinic in Egypt in
2500 BC. Imhotep has a name for her illness, a hieroglyph that we cannot
pronounce. He provides a diagnosis, but “there is no treatment,” he says
humbly, closing the case.</p>
<p>In 500 BC, in her own court, Atossa self-prescribes the most
primitive form of a mastectomy, which is performed by her Greek slave.
Two hundred years later, in Thrace, Hippocrates identifies her tumor as
a karkinos, thus giving her illness a name that will ring through its
future. Claudius Galen, in AD 168, hypothesizes a universal cause: a
systemic overdose of black bile—trapped melancholia boiling out as a
tumor.</p>
<p>A thousand years flash by; Atossa’s entrapped black bile is purged
from her body, yet the tumor keeps growing, relapsing, invading, and
metastasizing. Medieval surgeons understand little about Atossa’s
disease, but they chisel away at her cancer with knives and scalpels.
Some offer frog’s blood, lead plates, goat dung, holy water, crab paste,
and caustic chemicals as treatments. In 1778, in John Hunter’s clinic in
London, her cancer is assigned a stage—early, localized breast cancer or
late, advanced, invasive cancer. For the former, Hunter recommends a
local operation; for the latter, “remote sympathy.”</p>
<p>When Atossa reemerges in the nineteenth century, she encounters a new
world of surgery. In Halsted’s Baltimore clinic in 1890, Atossa’s breast
cancer is treated with the boldest and most definitive therapy thus
far—radical mastectomy with a large excision of the tumor and removal of
the deep chest muscles and lymph nodes under the armpit and the
collarbone. In the early twentieth century, radiation oncologists try to
obliterate the tumor locally using X-rays. By the 1950s, yet another
generation of surgeons learns to combine the two strategies, although
tempered by moderation. Atossa’s cancer is treated locally with a simple
mastectomy, or a lumpectomy followed by radiation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, new therapeutic strategies emerge. Atossa’s surgery is
followed by adjuvant combination chemotherapy to diminish the chance of
a relapse. Her tumor tests positive for the estrogen receptor.
Tamoxifen, the antiestrogen, is also added to prevent a relapse. In
1986, her tumor is further discovered to be Her-2 amplified. In addition
to surgery, radiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, and tamoxifen, she is
treated with targeted therapy using Herceptin.</p>
<p>It is impossible to enumerate the precise impact of these
interventions on Atossa’s survival. The shifting landscape of trials
does not allow a direct comparison between Atossa’s fate in 500 BC and
her fate in 1989. But surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal
therapy, and targeted therapy have likely added anywhere between
seventeen and thirty years to her survival. Diagnosed at forty, say,
Atossa can reasonably be expected to celebrate her sixtieth
birthday.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the management of Atossa’s breast cancer takes
another turn. Her diagnosis at an early age and her Achaemenid ancestry
raise the question of whether she carries a mutation in BRCA-1 or
BRCA-2. Atossa’s genome is sequenced, and indeed, a mutation is found.
She enters an intensive screening program to detect the appearance of a
tumor in her unaffected breast. Her two daughters are also tested. Found
positive for BRCA-1, they are offered either intensive screening,
prophylactic bilateral mastectomy, or tamoxifen to prevent the
development of invasive breast cancer. For Atossa’s daughters, the
impacts of screening and prophylaxis are dramatic. A breast MRI
identifies a small lump in one daughter. It is found to be breast cancer
and surgically removed in its early, preinvasive stage. The other
daughter chooses to undergo a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Having
excised her breasts preemptively, she will live out her life free of
breast cancer.</p>
<p>Move Atossa into the future now. In 2050, Atossa will arrive at her
breast oncologist’s clinic with a thumb-size flash drive containing the
entire sequence of her cancer’s genome, identifying every mutation in
every gene. The mutations will be organized into key pathways. An
algorithm might identify the pathways that are contributing to the
growth and survival of her cancer. Therapies will be targeted against
these pathways to prevent a relapse of the tumor after surgery. She will
begin with one combination of targeted drugs, expect to switch to a
second cocktail when her cancer mutates, and switch again when the
cancer mutates again. She will likely take some form of medicine,
whether to prevent, cure, or palliate her illness, for the rest of her
life.</p>
<p>This, indubitably, is progress. But before we become too dazzled by
Atossa’s survival, it is worthwhile putting it into perspective. Give
Atossa metastatic pancreatic cancer in 500 BC and her prognosis is
unlikely to change by more than a few months over twenty-five hundred
years. If Atossa develops gallbladder cancer that is not amenable to
surgery, her survival changes only marginally over centuries. Even
breast cancer shows a marked heterogeneity in outcome. If Atossa’s tumor
has metastasized, or is estrogen-receptor negative, Her-2 negative, and
unresponsive to standard chemotherapy, then her chances of survival will
have barely changed since the time of Hunter’s clinic. Give Atossa CML
or Hodgkin’s disease, in contrast, and her life span may have increased
by thirty or forty years.</p>
<p>Part of the unpredictability about the trajectory of cancer in the
future is that we do not know the biological basis for this
heterogeneity. We cannot yet fathom, for instance, what makes pancreatic
cancer or gallbladder cancer so markedly different from CML or Atossa’s
breast cancer. What is certain, however, is that even the knowledge of
cancer’s biology is unlikely to eradicate cancer fully from our lives.
As Doll suggests, and as Atossa epitomizes, we might as well focus on
prolonging life rather than eliminating death. This War on Cancer may
best be “won” by redefining victory.</p>
<p>Atossa’s tortuous journey also raises a question implicit in this
book: if our understanding and treatment of cancer keep morphing so
radically in time, then how can cancer’s past be used to predict its
future?</p>
<p>In 1997, the NCI director, Richard Klausner, responding to reports
that cancer mortality had remained disappointingly static through the
nineties, argued that the medical realities of one decade had little
bearing on the realities of the next. “There are far more good
historians than there are good prophets,” Klausner wrote. “It is
extraordinarily difficult to predict scientific discovery, which is
often propelled by seminal insights coming from unexpected directions.
The classic example—Fleming’s discovery of penicillin on moldy bread and
the monumental impact of that accidental finding—could not easily have
been predicted, nor could the sudden demise of iron-lung technology when
evolving techniques in virology allowed the growth of poliovirus and the
preparation of vaccine. Any extrapolation of history into the future
presupposes an environment of static discovery—an oxymoron.”</p>
<p>In a limited sense, Klausner is right. When truly radical discoveries
appear, their impact is often not incremental but cataclysmic and
paradigm-shifting. Technology dissolves its own past. The speculator who
bought stock options in an iron-lung company before the discovery of the
polio vaccine, or the scientist who deemed bacterial pneumonias
incurable just as penicillin was being discovered, were soon shown to be
history’s fools.</p>
<p>But with cancer, where no simple, universal, or definitive cure is in
sight—and is never likely to be—the past is constantly conversing with
the future. Old observations crystallize into new theories; time past is
always contained in time future. Rous’s virus was reincarnated, decades
later, in the form of endogenous oncogenes; George Beatson’s observation
that removing ovaries might slow the growth of breast cancer, inspired
by a Scottish shepherds’ tale, roars back in the form of a
billion-dollar drug named tamoxifen; Bennett’s “suppuration of blood,”
the cancer that launches this book, is also the cancer that ends this
book.</p>
<p>And there is a subtler reason to remember this story: while the
content of medicine is constantly changing, its form, I suspect, remains
astonishingly the same. History repeats, but science reverberates. The
tools that we will use to battle cancer in the future will doubtless
alter so dramatically in fifty years that the geography of cancer
prevention and therapy might be unrecognizable. Future physicians may
laugh at our mixing of primitive cocktails of poisons to kill the most
elemental and magisterial disease known to our species. But much about
this battle will remain the same: the relentlessness, the inventiveness,
the resilience, the queasy pivoting between defeatism and hope, the
hypnotic drive for universal solutions, the disappointment of defeat,
the arrogance and the hubris.</p>
<p>The Greeks used an evocative word to describe tumors, onkos, meaning
“mass” or “burden.” The word was more prescient than they might have
imagined. Cancer is indeed the load built into our genome, the leaden
counterweight to our aspirations for immortality. But if one looks back
even further behind the Greek to the ancestral Indo-European language,
the etymology of the word onkos changes. Onkos arises from the ancient
word nek. And nek, unlike the static onkos, is the active form of the
word load. It means to carry, to move the burden from one place to the
next, to bear something across a long distance and bring it to a new
place. It is an image that captures not just the cancer cell’s capacity
to travel—metastasis—but also Atossa’s journey, the long arc of
scientific discovery—and embedded in that journey, the animus, so
inextricably human, to outwit, to outlive and survive.</p>
<p>Late one evening in the spring of 2005, toward the end of the first
year of my fellowship, I sat in a room on the tenth floor of the
hospital with a dying woman, Germaine Berne. She was a vivacious
psychologist from Alabama. In 1999, she had been struck by nausea, a
queasiness so sudden and violent that it felt as if it had been released
from a catapult. Even more unsettling, the nausea had been accompanied
by a vague sense of fullness, as if she were perpetually stuck devouring
a large meal. Germaine had driven herself to the Baptist Hospital in
Montgomery, where she had undergone a barrage of tests until a CAT scan
had revealed a twelve-centimeter solid mass pushing into her stomach. On
January 4, 2000, a radiologist had biopsied the mass. Under the
microscope, the biopsy had revealed sheets of spindlelike cells dividing
rapidly. The tumor, which had invaded blood vessels and bucked the
normal planes of tissue, was a rare kind of cancer called a
gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or simply, a GIST.</p>
<p>The news quickly became worse. Her scans showed spots in her liver,
swellings in her lymph nodes, and a spray of masses peppering the left
lung. The cancer had metastasized all over her body. A surgical cure was
impossible, and in 2000, no chemotherapy was known to be effective
against her kind of sarcoma. Her doctors in Alabama cobbled together a
combination of chemotherapeutic drugs, but they were essentially biding
their time. “I signed my letters, paid my bills, and made my will,” she
recalled. “There was no doubt about the verdict. I was told to go home
to die.”</p>
<p>In the winter of 2000, handed her death sentence, Germaine stumbled
into a virtual community of cosufferers—GIST patients who spoke to each
other through a website. The site, like most of its bloggers, was a
strange and moribund affair, with desperate folks seeking desperate
remedies. But in late April, news of a novel drug began to spread like
wildfire through this community. The new drug was none other than
Gleevec—imatinib—the same chemical that Druker had found to be active
against chronic myelogenous leukemia. Gleevec binds and inactivates the
Bcr-abl protein. But serendipitously, the chemical inactivates another
tyrosine kinase, called c-kit. Just as activated Bcr-abl drives cancer
cells to divide and grow in CML, c-kit is a driver gene in GIST. In
early trials, Gleevec had turned out to be remarkably clinically active
against c-kit, and hence against GIST.</p>
<p>Germaine pulled strings to get enrolled in one of these trials. She
was, by nature, effortlessly persuasive, able to cajole, badger,
wheedle, pester, beg, and demand—and her illness had made her bold.
(“Cure me, Doc, and I’ll send you to Europe,” she told me once—an offer
that I politely declined.) She worked her way into a teaching hospital
where patients were being given the drug on trial. Just as she was being
enrolled, Gleevec had turned out to be so effective that doctors could
no longer justify treating GIST patients with a placebo pill. Germaine
started on the drug in August 2001. A month later, her tumors began to
recede at an astonishing rate. Her energy returned; her nausea vanished.
She was resurrected from the dead.</p>
<p>Germaine’s recovery was a medical miracle. Newspapers in Montgomery
picked up the story. She doled out advice to other cancer victims.
Medicine was catching up on cancer, she wrote; there was reason for
hope. Even if no cure was in sight, a new generation of drugs would
control cancer, and another generation would round the bend just as the
first one failed. In the summer of 2004, as she was celebrating the
fourth anniversary of her unexpected recovery, the cells of Germaine’s
tumor suddenly grew resistant to Gleevec. Her lumps, having remained
dormant for four years, sprouted vengefully back. In months, masses
appeared in her stomach, lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen. The nausea
returned, just as powerfully as the first time. Malignant fluid poured
into the cisterns of her abdomen.</p>
<p>Resourceful as usual, Germaine scoured the Web, returning to her
makeshift community of GIST patients for advice. She discovered that
other drugs—second-generation analogues of Gleevec—were in trial in
Boston and in other cities. In 2004, on a telephone halfway across the
country, she enrolled in a trial of one such analogue called SU11248
that had just opened up at the Farber.</p>
<p>The new drug produced a temporary response, but did not work for
long. By February 2005, Germaine’s cancer had spiraled out of control,
growing so fast that she could record its weight, in pounds, as she
stood on the scales every week. Eventually her pain made it impossible
for her to walk even from her bed to the door and she had to be
hospitalized. My meeting with Germaine that evening was not to discuss
drugs and therapies, but to try to make an honest reconciliation between
her and her medical condition.</p>
<p>As usual, she had already beaten me to it. When I entered her room to
talk about next steps, she waved her hand in the air with a withering
look and cut me off. Her goals were now simple, she told me. No more
trials. No more drugs. The six years of survival that she had eked out
between 1999 and 2005 had not been static, frozen years; they had
sharpened, clarified, and cleansed her. She had severed her relationship
with her husband and intensified her bond with her brother, an
oncologist. Her daughter, a teenager in 1999 and now a preternaturally
mature sophomore at a Boston college, had grown into her ally, her
confidante, her sometime nurse, and her closest friend. (“Cancer breaks
some families and makes some,” Germaine said. “In my case, it did
both.”) Germaine realized that her reprieve had finally come to an end.
She wanted to get to Alabama, to her own home, to die the death that she
had expected in 1999.</p>
<p>When I recall that final conversation with Germaine, embarrassingly
enough, the objects seem to stand out more vividly than the words: a
hospital room, with its sharp smell of disinfectant and hand soap; the
steely, unflattering overhead light; a wooden side table on wheels,
piled with pills, books, newspaper clippings, nail polish, jewelry,
postcards. Her room, wallpapered with pictures of her beautiful house in
Montgomery and of her daughter holding some fruit picked from her
garden; a standard-issue plastic hospital pitcher filled with a bunch of
sunflowers perched on a table by her side. Germaine, as I remember her,
was sitting by the bed, one leg dangling casually down, wearing her
usual eccentric and arresting combination of clothes and some large and
unusual pieces of jewelry. Her hair was carefully arranged. She looked
formal, frozen and perfect, like a photograph of someone in a hospital
waiting to die. She seemed content; she laughed and joked. She made
wearing a nasogastric tube seem effortless and dignified.</p>
<p>Only years later, in writing this book, could I finally put into
words why that meeting left me so uneasy and humbled; why the gestures
in that room seemed larger-than-life; why the objects seemed like
symbols; why Germaine herself seemed like an actor playing a part.
Nothing, I realized, was incidental. The characteristics of Germaine’s
personality that had once seemed spontaneous and impulsive were, in
fact, calculated and almost reflexive responses to her illness. Her
clothes were loose and vivid because they were decoys against the
growing outline of the tumor in her abdomen. Her necklace was
distractingly large so as to pull attention away from her cancer. Her
room was topsy-turvy with baubles and pictures—the hospital pitcher
filled with flowers, the cards tacked to the wall—because without them
it would devolve into the cold anonymity of any other room in any other
hospital. She had dangled her leg at that precise, posed angle because
the tumor had invaded her spine and begun to paralyze her other leg,
making it impossible to sit any other way. Her casualness was studied,
the jokes rehearsed. Her illness had tried to humiliate her. It had made
her anonymous and seemingly humorless; it had sentenced her to die an
unsightly death in a freezing hospital room thousands of miles away from
home. She had responded with vengeance, moving to be always one step
ahead, trying to outwit it.</p>
<p>It was like watching someone locked in a chess game. Every time
Germaine’s disease moved, imposing yet another terrifying constraint on
her, she made an equally assertive move in return. The illness acted;
she reacted. It was a morbid, hypnotic game—a game that had taken over
her life. She dodged one blow only to be caught by another. She, too,
was like Carroll’s Red Queen, stuck pedaling furiously just to keep
still in one place.</p>
<p>Germaine seemed, that evening, to have captured something essential
about our struggle against cancer: that, to keep pace with this malady,
you needed to keep inventing and reinventing, learning and unlearning
strategies. Germaine fought cancer obsessively, cannily, desperately,
fiercely, madly, brilliantly, and zealously—as if channeling all the
fierce, inventive energy of generations of men and women who had fought
cancer in the past and would fight it in the future. Her quest for a
cure had taken her on a strange and limitless journey, through Internet
blogs and teaching hospitals, chemotherapy and clinical trials halfway
across the country, through a landscape more desolate, desperate, and
disquieting than she had ever imagined. She had deployed every morsel of
energy to the quest, mobilizing and remobilizing the last dregs of her
courage, summoning her will and wit and imagination, until, that final
evening, she had stared into the vault of her resourcefulness and
resilience and found it empty. In that haunted last night, hanging on to
her life by no more than a tenuous thread, summoning all her strength
and dignity as she wheeled herself to the privacy of her bathroom, it
was as if she had encapsulated the essence of a four-thousand-year-old
war.</p>
<p>—S.M., June 2010</p>
<p>The first medical description of cancer was found in an Egyptian text
originally written in 2500 BC: “a bulging tumor in [the] breast . . .
like touching a ball of wrappings.” Discussing treatment, the ancient
scribe noted: “[There] is none.”</p>
<p>The anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) tried to discover the
source for black bile, the fluid thought to be responsible for cancer.
Unable to find it, Vesalius launched a new search for cancer’s real
cause and cure.</p>
<p>Medieval surgeons attacked cancer using primitive surgical methods.
Johannes Scultetus (1595–1645) describes a mastectomy, the surgical
removal of breast cancer, using fire, acid and leather bindings.</p>
<p>Between 1800 and 1900, surgeons devised increasingly aggressive
operations to attack the roots of cancer in the body. In the 1890s,
William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins University devised the radical
mastectomy—an operation to extirpate the breast, the muscles beneath the
breast and the associated lymph nodes.</p>
<p>“The patient was a young lady whom I was loath to disfigure,” Halsted
wrote. In this etching, Halsted presented an idealized patient. Real
cancer patients tended to be older women with larger tumors, far less
able to withstand this radical attack.</p>
<p>When radium was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie, oncologists and
surgeons began to deliver high doses of radiation to tumors. Yet
radiation was itself carcinogenic: Marie Curie died from a leukemia
caused by decades of X-ray exposure.</p>
<p>During World War Two, hundreds of tons of mustard gas were released
on the Bari harbor in Italy during an air raid. The gas decimated normal
white blood cells in the body, leading pharmacologists to fantasize
about using a similar chemical to kill cancers of white blood cells.
Chemotherapy—chemical warfare on cancer cells—was inspired, literally,
by war.</p>
<p>In 1947, Sidney Farber discovered a folic acid analog called
aminopterin that killed rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow. Using
aminopterin, Farber obtained brief, tantalizing remissions in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. One of Farber’s first patients was two-year-old
Robert Sandler.</p>
<p>From her all-white apartment in New York City, Mary Lasker, a
legendary entrepreneur, socialite, lobbyist and advocate, helped launch
a national battle against cancer. Lasker would become the “fairy
godmother” of cancer research; she would coax and strong-arm the nation
to initiate a War on Cancer.</p>
<p>Farber’s patient, Einar Gustafson—known as “Jimmy”—a baseball fan,
became the unofficial mascot for children’s cancer. The Jimmy Fund,
founded in 1948, was one of the most powerful cancer advocacy
organizations, with Ted Williams a vocal supporter.</p>
<p>Sidney Farber, Lasker’s confidant, mentor and co-conspirator,
provided medical legitimacy to the War on Cancer and oversaw the
building of a new cancer ward in Boston.</p>
<p>At the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the 1960s physicians Emil
Frei</p>
<p>Emil Freireich forged a strategy to cure acute lymphoblastic leukemia
using highly toxic drugs.</p>
<p>Henry Kaplan, a physician-scientist, used radiation therapy to cure
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The cures of lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin’s
lymphoma invigorated the War on Cancer, raising the possibility of
Farber’s “universal cure.”</p>
<p>Inspired by the early victories of chemotherapy, cancer advocates,
led by Lasker and Farber, urged the nation to launch a War on Cancer. In
1970, the Laskerites published a full-page advertisement in the New York
Times, coaxing Nixon to support their war.</p>
<p>Many scientists criticized the War on Cancer as premature, arguing
that a political cure would not lead to a medical cure.</p>
<p>Lasker’s use of canny advertising and potent imagery still inspires
generations of advocates, including Greenpeace.</p>
<p>In 1775, the London surgeon Percivall Pott observed that scrotal
cancer occurred disproportionately in adolescent chimney sweeps, and
proposed a link between soot and scrotal cancer, launching the hunt for
preventable carcinogens in the environment.</p>
<p>Innovative studies in the 1950s established the link between
cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Yet early warning labels affixed on
packages in the 1960s avoided the word “cancer.” Explicit warning labels
were not required until decades later.</p>
<p>Although smoking rates have fallen in most developed nations, active
marketing and bold political lobbying allows the tobacco industry to
flourish in others, creating a new generation of smokers (and of future
cancer victims).</p>
<p>Harold Varmus and J. Michael Bishop discovered that cancer is caused
not by exogenous viruses, but by the activation of endogenous precursor
genes that exist in all normal cells. Cancer, Varmus wrote, is a
“distorted version” of our normal selves.</p>
<p>Working with collaborators across the globe, Robert Weinberg, of MIT,
discovered distorted genes in mouse and human cancer cells.</p>
<p>Scientists have sequenced the entire genome (all 23,000 genes),
making it possible to document every genetic change (relative to normal
genes). Dots represent mutations in genes found in colon cancer, with
commonly mutated genes becoming “hills” and then “mountains.”</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Barbara Bradfield was among the first women to be
treated with a drug, Herceptin, that specifically attacks breast cancer
cells. She is the longest survivor of that treatment, with no hint of
her cancer remaining.</p>
