<h4 id="mice-and-men">Mice and Men</h4>
<p>A model is a lie that helps you see the truth.</p>
<p>—Howard Skipper</p>
<p>Min Chiu Li’s experience with choriocarcinoma was a philosophical
nudge for Frei and Freireich. “Clinical research is a matter of
urgency,” Freireich argued. For a child with leukemia, even a week’s
delay meant the difference between life and death. The academic
stodginess of the leukemia consortium—its insistence on progressively
and systematically testing one drug combination after another—was now
driving Freireich progressively and systematically mad. To test three
drugs, the group insisted on testing “all of the three possible
combinations and then you’ve got to do all of the four combinations and
with different doses and schedules for each.” At the rate that the
leukemia consortium was moving, he argued, it would take dozens of years
before any significant advance in leukemia was made. “The wards were
filling up with these terribly sick children. A boy or girl might be
brought in with a white cell count of three hundred and be dead
overnight. I was the one sent the next morning to speak with the
parents. Try explaining Zubrod’s strategy of sequential, systematic, and
objective trials to a woman whose daughter has just slumped into a coma
and died,” Freireich recalled.</p>
<p>The permutations of possible drugs and doses were further increased
when yet another new anticancer agent was introduced at the Clinical
Center in 1960. The newcomer, vincristine, was a poisonous
plant-alkaloid that came from the Madagascar periwinkle, a small,
weedlike creeper with violet flowers and an entwined, coiled stem. (The
name vincristine comes from vinca, the Latin word for “bind.”)
Vincristine had been discovered in 1958 at the Eli Lilly company through
a drug-discovery program that involved grinding up thousands of pounds
of plant material and testing the extracts in various biological assays.
Although originally intended as an antidiabetic, vincristine at small
doses was found to kill leukemia cells. Rapidly growing cells, such as
those of leukemia, typically create a skeletal scaffold of proteins
(called microtubules) that allows two daughter cells to separate from
each other and thereby complete cell division. Vincristine works by
binding to the end of these microtubules and then paralyzing the
cellular skeleton in its grip—thus, quite literally, evoking the Latin
word after which it was originally named.</p>
<p>With vincristine added to the pharmacopoeia, leukemia researchers
found themselves facing the paradox of excess: how might one take four
independently active drugs—methotrexate, prednisone, 6-MP, and
vincristine—and stitch them together into an effective regimen? And
since each drug was potentially severely toxic, could one ever find a
combination that would kill the leukemia but not kill a child?</p>
<p>Two drugs had already spawned dozens of possibilities; with four
drugs, the leukemia consortium would take not fifty, but a hundred and
fifty years to finish its trials. David Nathan, then a new recruit at
the NCI, recalled the near standstill created by the avalanche of new
medicines: “Frei and Freireich were simply taking drugs that were
available and adding them together in combinations. . . . The possible
combinations, doses, and schedules of four or five drugs were infinite.
Researchers could work for years on finding the right combination of
drugs and schedules.” Zubrod’s sequential, systematic, objective trials
had reached an impasse. What was needed was quite the opposite of a
systematic approach—an intuitive and inspired leap of faith into the
deadly abyss of deadly drugs.</p>
<p>A scientist from Alabama, Howard Skipper—a scholarly, soft-spoken man
who liked to call himself a “mouse doctor”—provided Frei and Freireich a
way out of the impasse. Skipper was an outsider to the NCI. If leukemia
was a model form of cancer, then Skipper had been studying the disease
by artificially inducing leukemias in animals—in effect, by building a
model of a model. Skipper’s model used a mouse cell line called L-1210,
a lymphoid leukemia that could be grown in a petri dish. When laboratory
mice were injected with these cells, they would acquire the leukemia—a
process known as engraftment because it was akin to transferring a piece
of normal tissue (a graft) from one animal to another.</p>
<p>Skipper liked to think about cancer not as a disease but as an
abstract mathematical entity. In a mouse transplanted with L-1210 cells,
the cells divided with nearly obscene fecundity—often twice a day, a
rate startling even for cancer cells. A single leukemia cell engrafted
into the mouse could thus take off in a terrifying arc of numbers: 1, 4,
16, 64, 256, 1,024, 4,096, 16,384, 65,536, 262,144, 1,048,576 . . . and
so forth, all the way to infinity. In sixteen or seventeen days, more
than 2 billion daughter cells could grow out of that single cell—more
than the entire number of blood cells in the mouse.</p>
<p>Skipper learned that he could halt this effusive cell division by
administering chemotherapy to the leukemia-engrafted mouse. By charting
the life and death of leukemia cells as they responded to drugs in these
mice, Skipper emerged with two pivotal findings. First, he found that
chemotherapy typically killed a fixed percentage of cells at any given
instance no matter what the total number of cancer cells was. This
percentage was a unique, cardinal number particular to every drug. In
other words, if you started off with 100,000 leukemia cells in a mouse
and administered a drug that killed 99 percent of those cells in a
single round, then every round would kill cells in a fractional manner,
resulting in fewer and fewer cells after every round of chemotherapy:
100,000 . . . 1,000 . . . 10 . . . and so forth, until the number
finally fell to zero after four rounds. Killing leukemia was an
iterative process, like halving a monster’s body, then halving the half,
and halving the remnant half.</p>
<p>Second, Skipper found that by adding drugs in combination, he could
often get synergistic effects on killing. Since different drugs elicited
different resistance mechanisms, and produced different toxicities in
cancer cells, using drugs in concert dramatically lowered the chance of
resistance and increased cell killing. Two drugs were therefore
typically better than one, and three drugs better than two. With several
drugs and several iterative rounds of chemotherapy in rapid-fire
succession, Skipper cured leukemias in his mouse model.</p>
<p>For Frei and Freireich, Skipper’s observations had an inevitable, if
frightening, conclusion. If human leukemias were like Skipper’s mouse
leukemias, then children would need to be treated with a regimen
containing not one or two, but multiple drugs. Furthermore, a single
treatment would not suffice. “Maximal, intermittent, intensive,
up-front” chemotherapy would need to be administered with nearly
ruthless, inexorable persistence, dose after dose after dose after dose,
pushing the outermost limits of tolerability. There would be no
stopping, not even after the leukemia cells had apparently disappeared
in the blood and the children had apparently been “cured.”</p>
<p>Freireich and Frei were now ready to take their pivotal and intuitive
leap into the abyss. The next regimen they would try would be a
combination of all four drugs: vincristine, amethopterin,
mercaptopurine, and prednisone. The regimen would be known by a new
acronym, with each letter standing for one of the drugs: VAMP.</p>
<p>The name had many intended and unintended resonances. Vamp is a word
that means to improvise or patch up, to cobble something together from
bits and pieces that might crumble apart any second. It can mean a
seductress—one who promises but does not deliver. It also refers to the
front of a boot, the part that carries the full brunt of force during a
kick.</p>
