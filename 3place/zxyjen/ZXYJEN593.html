<h4 id="section">607</h4>
<p>How does one judge what time it is? I do not mean by external
evidences, however, such as the position of the sun, the lightness of
the room, and so on.—One asks oneself, say, “What timp can it be?”,
pauses a moment, perhaps imagines a clock-face, and then says a time.—Or
one considers various possibilities, thinks first of one time, then of
another, and in the end stops at one. That is the kind of way it is
done.-But isn’t the idea accompanied by a feeling of conviction; and
doesn’t that mean that it accords with an inner clock?—No, I don’t read
the time off from any clock; there is a feeling of conviction inasmuch
as I say a time to myself without feeling any doubt, with calm
assurance.—But doesn’t something click as I say this time?—Not that I
know of; unless that is what you call the coming- to-rest of
deliberation, the stopping at one number. For should I ever have spoken
of a ’feeling of conviction* here, but should have said: I considered a
while and then plumped for its being quarter past five.— But what did I
go by? I might perhaps have said: “simply by feel”,</p>
<p>which only means that I left it to what should suggest itself.-</p>
<p>But you surely must at least have disposed yourself in a definite way
in order to guess the time; and you don’t take just any idea of a time
of day as yielding the correct time I—To repeat: I asked myself “I
wonder what time it is?” That is, I did not, for example, read this
question in some narrative, or quote it as someone else’s utterance; nor
was I practising the pronunciation of these words; and so on. These were
not the circumstances of my saying the words.—But then, what were the
circumstances?—I was thinking about my breakfast and wondering whether
it would be late today. These were the kind of circumstances.—But do you
really not see that you were all the same disposed in a way which,
though impalpable, is characteristic of guess ing the time, like being
surrounded by a characteristic atmosphere?— Yes; what was characteristic
was that I said to myself “I wonder what time it is?”—And if this
sentence has a particular atmosphere, how am I to separate it from the
sentence itself? It would never have occurred to me to think the
sentence had such an aura if I had not thought of how one might say it
differently—as a quotation, as a joke, as practice in elocution, and so
on. And then all at once I wanted to say, then all at once it seemed to
me, that I must after all have meant the words somehow specially;
differently, that is, from in those other cases. The picture of the
special atmosphere forced itself upon me; I can see it quite clear
before me—so long, that is, as I do not look at what my memory tells me
really happened.</p>
<p>And as for the feeling of certainty: I sometimes say to myself “I am
sure it’s . . . o’clock”, and in a more or less confident tone of voice,
and so on. Of you ask me the reason for this certainty I have none.</p>
<p>Of I say, I read it off from an inner clock,—that is a picture, and
the only thing that corresponds to it is that I said it was
such-and-such a time. And the purpose of the picture is to assimilate
this case to the other one. I am refusing to acknowledge two different
cases here.</p>
