<p>But what does it mean to say that we cannot define (that is,
describe) these elements, but only name them? This might mean, for
instance, that when in a limiting case a complex consists of only one
square, its description is simply the name of the coloured square.</p>
<p>Here we might say—though this easily leads to all kinds of
philosophical superstition—that a sign “R** or”B**, etc. may be
sometimes a word and sometimes a proposition. But whether it ’is a word
or a proposition* depends on die situation in which it is uttered or
written. For instance, if A has to describe complexes of coloured
squares to A and he uses the word “R** alone&gt; we shall be able to say
that the word is a description—a proposition. But if he is memorizing
the words and their meanings, or if he is teaching someone else the use
of the words and uttering them in the course of ostensive teaching, we
shall not say that they are propositions. In this situation the word”R”,
for instance, is not a description; it names an element-but it would be
queer to make that a reason for saying that an element can only be
named! For naming and describing do not stand on the same level: naming
is a preparation for description. Naming is so far not a move in the
language-game—any more than putting a piece in its place on the board is
a move in chess. We may say: nothing has so far been done, when a thing
has been named. It has not even got a name except in the language-game.
This was what Frege meant too, when he said that a word had meaning only
as part of a sentence.</p>
<p>That does it mean to say that we can attribute neither being nor
non-being to elements?—One might say: if everything that we call
“being** and”non-being** consists in the existence and non-existence of
connexions between elements, it makes no sense to speak of an elements
being (non-being); just as when everything that we call “destruction**
lies in the separation of elements, it makes no sense to speak of the
destruction of an element.</p>
<p>One would, however, like to say: existence cannot be attributed to an
element, for if it did not exists one could not even name it and so one
could say nothing at all of it.—But let us consider an analogous case.
There is one thing of which one can say neither that it is one metre
long, nor that it is not one metre long, and that is the standard metre
in Paris.—But this is, of course, not to ascribe any extraordinary
property to it, but only to mark its peculiar role in the language-game
of measuring with a metre-rule.—Let us imagine samples of colour being
preserved in Paris like the standard metre. We define: “sepia” means the
colour of the standard sepia which is there kept hermetically sealed.
When it will make no sense to say of this sample either that it is of
this colour or that it is not.</p>
<p>We can put it like this: This sample is an instrument of the language
used in ascriptions of colour. In this language-game it is not some
thing that is represented, but is a means of representation.—And just
this goes for an element in language-game (48) when we name it by
uttering the word “R”: this gives this object a role in our language-
game; it is now a means of representation. And to say “If it did not
exist , it could have no name” is to say as much and as little as: if
this thing did not exist, we could not use it in our language-game.—What
looks as if it had to exist, is part of the language. It is a paradigm
in our language-game; something with which comparison is made. And this
may be an important observation; but it is none the less an observation
concerning our language-game—our method of representation.</p>
