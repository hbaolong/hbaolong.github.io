<h4 id="section">156</h4>
<p>This will become clearer if we interpolate the consideration of
another word, namely “reading”. First I need to remark that I am not
counting the understanding of what is read as part of ‘reading’ for
purposes of this investigation: reading is here the activity of
rendering out loud what is written or printed; and also of writing from
dictation, writing out something printed, playing from a score, and so
on.</p>
<p>The use of this word in the ordinary circumstances of our life is of
course extremely familiar to us. But the part the word plays in our
life, and therewith the language-game in which we employ it, would be
difficult to describe even in rough outline. A person, let us say an
Englishman, has received at school or at home one of the kinds of
education usual among us, and in the course of it has learned to read
his native language. Later he reads books, letters, newspapers, and
other things.</p>
<p>How what takes place when, say, he reads a newspaper?-His eye
passes—as we say—along the printed words, he says them out loud—or only
to himself; in particular he reads certain words by taking in their
printed shapes as wholes; others when his eye has taken in the first
syllables; others again he reads syllable by syllable, and an occasional
one perhaps letter by letter,—We should also say that he had read a
sentence if he spoke neither aloud nor to himself during the reading but
was afterwards able to repeat the sentence word for word or nearly
so.—He may attend to what he reads, or again—as we might put it—function
as a mere reading-machine: I mean, read aloud and correctly without
attending to what he is reading; perhaps with his attention on something
quite different (so that he is unable to say what he has been reading if
he is asked about it immediately afterwards).</p>
<p>How compare a beginner with this reader* The beginner reads the words
by laboriously spelling them out.—Some however he guesses from the
context, or perhaps he already pardy knows the passage by heart. When
his teacher says that he is not really reading the words (and in certain
cases that he is only pretending to read them).</p>
<p>Of we think, of this sort of reading, the reading of a beginner, and
ask ourselves what reading consists in, we shall be inclined to say: it
is a special conscious activity of mind.</p>
<p>We also say of the pupil: “Of course he alone knows if he is really
reading or merely saying the words off by heart”. (We have yet to
discuss these propositions: “He alone knows_”.)</p>
<p>But I want to say: we have to admit that—as far as concerns uttering
any one of the printed words—the same thing may take place in the
consciousness of the pupil who is “pretending’ to read, as in that of
the practised reader who is”reading’ it. The word ““to read” is applied
differently when we are speaking of the beginner and of the practised
reader.-Now we should of course like to say: That goes on in that
practised reader and in the beginner when they utter the word catft be
the same. And if there is no difference in what they happen to be
conscious of there must be one in the unconscious workings of their
minds, or, again, in the brain.—So we should like to say: There are at
all events two different mechanisms at work here. And what goes on in
them must distinguish reading from not reading. —But these mechanisms
are only hypotheses, models designed to explain, to sum up, what you
observe.</p>
