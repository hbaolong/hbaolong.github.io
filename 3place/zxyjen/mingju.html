<li><p>years ago I had occasion to re-read my first book (the Tractates
Logico-Pbilosophicus ) and to explain its ideas to someone. It suddenly
seemed to me that I should publish those old thoughts and the new ones
together: that the latter could be seen in the right light only by
contrast with and against the background of my old way of thinking.

<li><p>For the word “number” here shews what place in language, in
grammar,’ we assign to the word. But this means that the word”number”
must be explained before the ostensive definition can be understood.—The
word “number” in the definition does indeed shew this place; does shew
the post at which we station the word. And we can prevent
misunderstandings by saying: “This colour is called so-and-so”, “This
length is called so-and-so”, and so on. That is to say:
misunderstandings are sometimes averted in this way. But is there only
one way of taking the word “colour” or “length”?—Well, they just need
defining.—Defining, then, by means of other words! And what about the
last definition in this chain? (Do not say: “There isn’t a ‘last’
definition”. That is just as if you chose to say: “There isn’t a last
house in this road; one can always build an additional one”.)</p></li>

<li><p>when he is given it?—We have not settled anything about this. One
might ask: what will he do? Well, perhaps he will stand there at a loss,
or shew A the pieces. Here one might say: “N” has become meaningless;
and this expression would mean that the sign “N” no longer had a use in
our language-game (unless we gave it a new one). “N” might also become
meaningless because, for whatever reason, the tool was given another
name and the sign “N” no longer used in the language-game.—But we could
also imagine a convention whereby A has to shake his head in reply if A
gives him the sign belonging to a tool that is broken.—In this way the
command “N” might be said to be given a place in the language-game even
when the tool no longer exists, and the sign “N” to have meaning even
when its bearer ceases to exist.</p></li>

instance, if A has to describe complexes of coloured squares to A and he
uses the word “R</p></li>
<li><p>alone&gt; we shall be able to say that the word is a
description—a proposition. But if he is memorizing the words and their
meanings, or if he is teaching someone else the use of the words and
uttering them in the course of ostensive teaching, we shall not say that
they are propositions. In this situation the word”R”, for instance, is
not a description; it names an element-but it would be queer to make
that a reason for saying that an element can only be named! For naming
and describing do not stand on the same level: naming is a preparation
for description. Naming is so far not a move in the language-game—any
more than putting a piece in its place on the board is a move in chess.
We may say: nothing has so far been done, when a thing has been named.
It has not even got a name except in the language-game. This was what
Frege meant too, when he said that a word had meaning only as part of a
sentence.</p></li>

possible for us to remember it, it must be in itself
indestructible.</p></li>
<li><p>-But what do we regard as the criterion for remembering it
right?—When we work with a sample instead of our memory there are
circumstances in which we say that the sample has changed colour and we
judge of this by memory. But can we not sometimes speak of a darkening
(for example) of our memory-image? Aren’t we as much at the mercy of
memory as of a sample? (For someone might feel like saying: “If we had
no memory we should be at the mercy of a sample”.)—Or perhaps of some
chemical reaction. Imagine that you were supposed to paint a particular
colour “C”, which was the colour that appeared when the chemical
substances A and A combined.—Suppose that the colour struck you as
brighter on one day than on another; would you not sometimes say: “I
must be wrong, the colour is certainly the same as yesterday”? This
shews that we do not always resort to what memory tells us as the

<li><p>—But what is that?—Why, it swam before our minds as we said the
sentence! This was the very expression of a quite particular image: of a
particular picture which we want to use. For certainly experience does
not shew us these elements. We see component parts of something
composite (of a chair, for instance). We say that the back is part of
the chair, but is in turn itself composed of several bits of wood; while
a leg is a simple component part. • We also see a whole which changes
(is destroyed) while its component parts remain unchanged. These are the
materials from which we construct that picture of reality.</p></li>

To repeat, we can draw a boundary— for a special purpose. Does it take
that to make the concept usable? Not at all! (Except for that special
purpose.) To more than it took the definition: 1 pace = 75 cm. to make

(2) looked like this (pictures), (3) has done such-and-such things, and
(4) bore the name “N” in social life.—Asked what I understand by “N”, I
should enumerate all or some of these points, and different ones on
different occasions. To my definition of “N” would perhaps be “the man
of whom all this is true”.—But if some point now proves false?—Shall I
be prepared to declare the proposition “N is dead” false—even if it is,
only something which strikes me as incidental that has turned out false?
But where are the bounds of the incidental?— Of I had given a definition
of the name in such a case, I should now be ready to alter it. ^</li>
