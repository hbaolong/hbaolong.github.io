<h4 id="part-ii">PART II</h4>
<p>i</p>
<p>One can imagine an animal angry, frightened, unhappy, happy,
startled. But hopeful? And why not?</p>
<p>A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his
master will come the day after to-morrow?—And what can he not do
here?—How do I do it?—How am I supposed to answer this?</p>
<p>Can only those hope, who can talk? Only those who have mastered the
use of a language. That is to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of
this complicated form of life. (If a concept refers to a character of
human handwriting, it has no application to beings that do not
write.)</p>
<p>“Grief” describes a pattern which recurs, with different variations,
in the weave of our life. Of a man’s bodily expression of sorrow and of
joy alternated, say with the ticking of a clock, here we should not have
the characteristic formation of the pattern of sorrow or of the pattern
of joy.</p>
<p>“For a second he felt violent pain.”—Why does it sound queer to say:
“For a second he felt deep grief”? Only because it so seldom
happens?</p>
<p>But don’t you feel grief now ? (“But aren’t you playing chess now?”
The answer may be affirmative, but that does not make the concept of
grief any more like the concept of a sensation.—The question was really,
of course, a temporal and personal one, not the logical question which
we wanted to raise.</p>
<p>“I must tell you: I am frightened.”</p>
<p>“I must tell you: it makes me shiver.”—</p>
<p>And one can say this in a smiling tone of voice too.</p>
<p>And do you mean to tell me he doesn’t feel it? How else does he know
it?—But even when he says it as a piece of information he does not learn
it from his sensations.</p>
<p>For think of the sensations produced by physically shuddering: the
words “it makes me shiver” are themselves such a shuddering re action;
and if I hear and feel them as I utter them, this belongs among the rest
of those sensations. How why should the wordless shudder be the ground
of the verbal one?</p>
<p>ii</p>
<p>In saying “When I heard this word, it meant …. to me” one refers to a
point of time and to a way of using the word (Of course, it is this
combination that we fail to grasp.)</p>
<p>And the expression “I was then going to say.” refers to a point of
time and to an action.</p>
<p>I speak of the essential references of the utterance in order to dis
tinguish them from other peculiarities of the expression we use. The
references that are essential to an utterance are the ones which would
make us translate some otherwise alien form of expression into this, our
customary form.</p>
<p>Of you were unable to say that the word “till” could be both a verb
and a conjunction, or to construct sentences in which it was now the one
and now the other, you would not be able to manage simple schoolroom
exercises. But a schoolboy is not asked to conceive the word in one way
or another out of any context, or to report how he has conceived it.</p>
<p>The words “the rose is red” are meaningless if the word “is” has the
meaning “is identical with”.—Does this mean: if you say this sentence
and mean the “is” as the sign of identity, the sense disintegrates?</p>
<p>We take a sentence and tell someone the meaning of each of its words;
this tells him how to apply them and so how to apply the sentence too.
Of we had chosen a senseless sequence of words instead of the sentence,
he would not learn how to apply the sequence . And if we explain the
word “is” as the sign of identity, then he does not learn how to use the
sentence “the rose is red”.</p>
<p>And yet there is something right about this ‘disintegration of the
sense’. You get it in the following example: one might tell someone: if
you want to pronounce the salutation “Hail!” expressively, you had
better not think of hailstones as you say it.</p>
<p>Experiencing a meaning and experiencing a mental image. “In both
cases”, we should like to say, “we are experiencing something, only
something different. A different content is proffered—is present— to
consciousness.”—What is the content of the experience of imagin ing? The
answer is a picture, or a description. And what is the content of the
experience of meaning? I don’t know what I am supposed to say to
this.—If there is any sense in the above remark, it is that the two
concepts are related like those of ‘red’ and ‘blue’; and that is
wrong.</p>
<p>Can one keep hold of an understanding of meaning as one can keep hold
of a mental image? That is, if one meaning of a word suddenly strikes
me,—can it also stay there in my mind?</p>
<p>“The whole scheme presented itself to my mind in a flash and stayed
there like that for five minutes.” Why does this sound odd? One would
like to think: what flashed on me and what stayed there in my mind can’t
have been the same.</p>
<p>I exclaimed “Now I have it!”—a sudden start, and then I was able to
set the scheme forth in detail. That is supposed to have stayed in this
case? A picture, perhaps. But “Now I have it” did not mean, I have the
picture.</p>
<p>Of a meaning of a word has occurred to you and you have not for
gotten it again, you can now use the word in such-and-such a way.</p>
<p>Of the meaning has occurred to you, now you know it, and the know ing
began when it occurred to you. When how is it like an experience of
imagining something?</p>
<p>Of I say “Mr. Scot is not a Scot”, I mean the first “Scot” as a
proper name, the second one as a common name. When do different things
have to go on in my mind at the first and second “Scot”? (Assuming that
I am not uttering the sentence ‘parrot-wise’.)—Try to mean the first
“Scot” as a common name and the second one as a proper name.— How is it
done? When I do it, I blink with the effort as I try to parade the right
meanings before my mind in saying the words.—But do I parade the
meanings of the words before my mind when I make the ordinary use of
them?</p>
<p>When I say the sentence with this exchange of meanings I feel that
its sense disintegrates.—Well, I feel it, but the person I am saying it
to does not. To what harm is done?-“But the point is, when one utters
the sentence in the usual way something else, quite definite, takes
place.”—What takes place is not this ‘parade of the meanings before
one’s mind’.</p>
<p>iii</p>
<p>That makes my image of him into an image of him him?</p>
<p>Not its looking like him.</p>
<p>The same question applies to the expression “I see him now vividly
before me” as to the image. That makes this utterance into an utter ance
about him ?—Nothing in it or simultaneous with it (’behind it*). Of you
want to know whom he meant, ask him.</p>
<p>(But it is also possible for a face to come before my mind, and even
for me to be able to draw it, without my knowing whose it is or where I
have seen it.)</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that someone were to draw while he had an image or
instead of having it, though it were only with his finger in the air.
(This might be called “motor imagery.”) We could be asked: “Whom does
that represent?” And his answer would be decisive.— It is quite as if he
had given a verbal description: and such a description can also simply
take the place of the image.</p>
<p>iv</p>
<p>“I believe that he is suffering.”——Do I also believe that he isn’t an
automaton?</p>
<p>It would go against the grain to use the word in both connexions.</p>
<p>(Or is it like this: I believe that he is suffering, but am certain
that he is not an automaton? Nonsense 1)</p>
<p>Suppose I say of a friend: “He isn’t an automaton”.—What informa tion
is conveyed by this, and to whom would it be information? To a human
being who meets him in ordinary circumstances? That information could it
give him? (At the very most that this man always behaves like a human
being, and not occasionally like a machine.)</p>
<p>“I believe that he is not an automaton”, just like that, so far makes
no sense.</p>
<p>By attitude towards him is an attitude towards a soul. I am not of
the opinion that he has a soul.</p>
<p>Religion teaches that the soul can exist when the body has dis-
integrated. How do I understand this teaching?—Of course I under stand
it-1 can imagine plenty of things in connexion with it. And haven’t
pictures of these things been painted? And why should such a picture be
only an imperfect rendering of the spoken doctrine? Why should it not do
the same service as the words? And it is the service which is the
point.</p>
<p>Of the picture of thought in the head can force itself upon us, then
why not much more that of thought in the soul?</p>
<p>The human body is the best picture of the human soul.</p>
<p>And how about such an expression as: “In my heart I understood when
you said that”, pointing to one’s heart? Does one, perhaps, not mean
this gesture? Of course one means it. Or is one conscious of using a
mere figure? Indeed not.—It is not a figure that we choose, not a
simile, yet it is a figurative expression.</p>
<p>v</p>
<p>Suppose we were observing the movement of a point (for example, a
point of light on a screen). It might be possible to draw important
consequences of the most various kinds from the behaviour of this point.
And what a variety of observations can be made here!—The path of the
point and certain of its characteristic measures (amplitude and
wave-length for instance), or the velocity and the law according to
which it varies, or the number or position of the places at which it
changes discontinuously, or the curvature of the path at these places,
and innumerable other things.—Any of these features of its behaviour
might be the only one to interest us. We might, for example, be in
different to everything about its movements except for the number of
loops it made in a certain time.—And if we were interested, not in just
one such feature, but in several, each might yield us special
information, different iii kind from all the rest. This is how it is
with the behaviour of man; with the different characteristic features
which we observe in this behaviour.</p>
<p>When psychology treats of behaviour, not of the mind?</p>
<p>That do psychologists record?—What do they observe? Isn’t it the
behaviour of human beings, in particular their utterances? But these are
not about behaviour.</p>
<p>“I noticed that he was out of humour.” Is this a report about his
behaviour or his state of mind? (“The sky looks threatening”: is this
about the present or the future?) Both; not side-by-side, however, but
about the one via the other.</p>
<p>A doctor asks: “How is he feeling?” The nurse says: “He is groaning”.
A report on his behaviour. But need there be any question for them
whether the groaning is really genuine, is really the expression of
anything? Might they not, for example, draw the conclusion “If he
groans, we must give him more analgesic”—without suppressing a middle
term? Isn’t the point the service to which they put the descrip tion of
behaviour?</p>
<p>“But then they make a tacit presupposition.” When what we do in our
language-game always rests on a tacit presupposition.</p>
<p>I describe a psychological experiment: the apparatus, the questions
of the experimenter, the actions and replies of the subject—and then I
say that it is a scene in a play.—Now everything is different. To it
will be said: Of this experiment were described in the same way in a
book on psychology, then the behaviour described would be understood as
the expression of something mental just because it is presupposed that
the subject is not taking us in, hasn’t learnt the replies by heart, and
other things of the kind.—So we are making a presupposition?</p>
<p>Should we ever really express ourselves like this: “Naturally I am
presupposing that.”?—Or do we not do so only because the other person
already knows that?</p>
<p>Doesn’t a presupposition imply a doubt? And doubt may be entirely
lacking. Doubting has an end.</p>
<p>It is like the relation: physical object—sense-impressions. Here we
have two different language-games and a complicated relation between
them.—If you try to reduce their relations to a simple formula you go
wrong.</p>
<p>vi</p>
<p>Suppose someone said: every familiar word, in a book for example,
actually carries an atmosphere with it in our minds, a ‘corona’ of
lightly indicated uses.—Just as if each figure in a painting were
surrounded by delicate shadowy drawings of scenes, as it were in another
dimension, and in them we saw the figures in different con texts.—Only
let us take this assumption seriously!—Then we see that it is not
adequate to explain intention .</p>
<p>For if it is like this, if the possible uses of a word do float
before us in half-shades as we say or hear it—this simply goes for us .
But we communicate with other people without knowing if they have this
experience too.</p>
<p>How should we counter someone who told us that with him under
standing was an inner process?-How should we counter him if he said that
with him knowing how to play chess was an inner process?— We should say
that when we want to know if he can play chess we aren’t interested in
anything that goes on inside him.—And if he replies that this is in fact
just what we are interested in, that is, we are interested in whether he
can play chess—then we shall have to draw his attention to the criteria
which would demonstrate his capacity, and on the other hand to the
criteria for the ‘inner states’.</p>
<p>Even if someone had a particular capacity only when, and only as long
as, he had a particular feeling, the feeling would not be the
capacity.</p>
<p>The meaning of a word is not the experience one has in hearing or
saying it, and the sense of a sentence is not a complex of such ex
periences.—(How do the meanings of the individual words make up the
sense of the sentence “I still haven’t seen him yet”?) The sentence is
composed of the words, and that is enough.</p>
<p>Though—one would like to say—every word has a different character in
different contexts, at the same time there is one character it always
has: a single physiognomy. It looks at us.—But a face in a painting
looks at us too.</p>
<p>Are you sure that there is a single if-feeling, and not perhaps
several? Have you tried saying the word in a great variety of contexts?
For example, when it bears the principal stress of the sentence, and
when the word next to it does.</p>
<p>Suppose we found a man who, speaking of how words felt to him, told
us that “if” and “but” felt the same .—Should we have the right to
disbelieve him? We might think it strange. “He doesn’t play our game at
all”, one would like to say. Or even: “This is a different type of
man.”</p>
<p>Of he used the words “if” and “but” as we do, shouldn’t we think he
understood them as we do?</p>
<p>One misjudges the psychological interest of the if-feeling if one
regards it as the obvious correlate of a meaning; it needs rather to be
seen in a different context, in that of the special circumstances in
which it occurs.</p>
<p>Does a person never have the if-feeling when he is not uttering the
word “if”? Surely it is at least remarkable if this cause alone produces
this feeling. And this applies generally to the ‘atmosphere’ of a
word;—why does one regard it so much as a matter of course that only
this word has this atmosphere?</p>
<p>The if-feeling is not a feeling which accompanies the word “if”.</p>
<p>The if-feeling would have to be compared with the special ‘feeling’
which a musical phrase gives us. (One sometimes describes such a feeling
by saying “Here it is as if a conclusion were being drawn”, or</p>
<p>“I should like to say ‘hence .’”, or “Here I should always like to
make a gesture—” and then one makes it.)</p>
<p>But can this feeling be separated from the phrase? And yet it is not
the phrase itself, for that can be heard without the feeling.</p>
<p>Is it in this respect like the ‘expression’ with which the phrase is
played?</p>
<p>We say this passage gives us a quite special feeling. We sing it to
ourselves, and make a certain movement, and also perhaps have some
special sensation. But in a different context we should not recognize
these accompaniments—the movement, the sensation—at all. They are quite
empty except just when we are singing this passage.</p>
<p>“I sing it with a quite particular expression.” This expression is
not something that can be separated from the passage. It is a different
concept. (A different game.)</p>
<p>The experience is this passage played like this (that is, as I am
doing it, for instance; a description could only hint at it).</p>
<p>Thus the atmosphere that is inseparable from its object—is not an
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Closely associated things, things which we have associated, seem to
fit one another. But what is this seeming to fit? How is their seeming
to fit manifested? Perhaps like this: we cannot imagine the man who had
this name, this face, this handwriting, not to have produced these
works, but perhaps quite different ones instead (those of another great
man).</p>
<p>We cannot imagine it? To we try?—</p>
<p>Here is a possibility: I hear that someone is painting a picture
“Beethoven writing the ninth symphony”. I could easily imagine the kind
of thing such a picture would shew us. But suppose someone wanted to
represent what Goethe would have looked like writing the ninth symphony?
Here I could imagine nothing that would not be embarrassing and
ridiculous.</p>
<p>vii</p>
<p>People who on waking tell us certain incidents (that they have been
in such-and-such places, etc.). When we teach them the expression “I
dreamt”, which precedes the narrative. Afterwards I sometimes ask them
“did you dream anything last night?” and am answered yes or no,
sometimes with an account of a dream, sometimes not. That is the
language-game. (I have assumed here that I do not dream myself. But
then, nor do I ever have the feeling of an invisible presence; other
people do, and I can question them about their experiences.)</p>
<p>How must I make some assumption about whether people are deceived by
their memories or not; whether they really had these images while they
slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking? And what meaning
has this question?—And what interest? To we ever ask ourselves this when
someone is telling us his dream? And if not—is it because we are sure
his memory won’t have deceived him? (And suppose it were a man with a
quite specially bad memory?—)</p>
<p>Does this mean that it is nonsense ever to raise the question whether
dreams really take place during sleep, or are a memory phenomenon of the
awakened? It will turn on the use of the question.</p>
<p>“The mind seems able to give a word meaning”—isn’t this as if I were
to say “The carbon atoms in benzene seem to lie at the comers of a
hexagon”? But this is not something that seems to be so; it is a
picture.</p>
<p>The evolution of the higher animals and of man, and the awakening of
consciousness at a particular level. The picture is something like this:
Though the ether is filled with vibrations the world is dandandandandik
But one day man opens his seeing eye, and there is light.</p>
<p>That this language primarily describes is a picture. That is to be
done with the picture, how it is to be used, is still obscure. Quite
clearly, however, it must be explored if we want to understand the sense
of what we are saying. But the picture seems to spare us this work: it
already points to a particular use. This is how it takes us in.</p>
<p>“My kinaesthetic sensations advise me of the movement and position of
my limbs.”</p>
<p>I let my index finger make an easy pendulum movement of small
amplitude. I either hardly feel it, or don’t feel it at all. Perhaps a
little in the tip of the finger, as a slight tension. (Not at all in the
joint.) And this sensation advises me of the movement?—for I can
describe the movement exactly.</p>
<p>“But after all, you must feel it, otherwise you wouldn’t know
(without looking) how your finger was moving.” But “knowing” it only
means: being able to describe it.—I may be able to tell the direc tion
from which a sound comes only because it affects one ear more strongly
than the other, but I don’t feel this in my ears; yet it has its effect:
I know the direction from which the sound comes; for instance, I look in
that direction.</p>
<p>It is the same with the idea that it must be some feature of our pain
that advises us of the whereabouts of the pain in the body, and some
feature of our memory image that tells us the time to which it
belongs.</p>
<p>A sensation can advise us of the movement or position of a limb. (For
example, if you do not know, as a normal person does, whether your arm
is stretched out, you might find out by a piercing pain in the
elbow.)—In the same way the character of a pain can tell us where the
injury is. (And the yellowness of a photograph how old it is.)</p>
<p>That is the criterion for my learning the shape and colour of an
object from a sense-impression?</p>
<p>That sense-impression? Well, this one; I use words or a picture to
describe it.</p>
<p>And now: what do you feel when your fingers are in this position?—
“How is one to define a feeling? It is something special and
indefinable.” But it must be possible to teach the use of the words
I</p>
<p>That I am looking for is the grammatical difference.</p>
<p>Let us leave the kinaesthetic feeling out for the moment.—I want to
describe a feeling to someone, and I tell him “Do this , and then you’ll
get it,” and I hold my arm or my head in a particular position. How is
this a description of a feeling? and when shall I say that he has under
stood what feeling I meant?—He will have to give a further description
of the feeling afterwards. And what kind of description must it be?</p>
<p>I say “Do this , and you’ll get it”. Can’t there be a doubt here?
Mustn’t there be one, if it is a feeling that is meant?</p>
<p>This looks so; this tastes so; this feels so . “This” and “so” must
be differendy explained.</p>
<p>Our interest in a ‘feeling’ is of a quite particular kind. It
includes, for instance, the ‘degree of the feeling’, its ‘place’, and
the extent to which one feeling can be submerged by another. (When a
movement is very painful, so that the pain submerges every other slight
sensation in the same place, does this make it uncertain whether you
have really made this movement? Would it lead you to find out by
looking?)</p>
<p>ix</p>
<p>Of you observe your own grief, which senses do you use to observe it?
A particular sense; one that feels grief? When do you feel it
differently when you are observing it? And what is the grief that you
are observ ing—is it one which is there only while it is being
observed?</p>
<p>’Observing” does not produce what is observed. (That is a concep tual
statement.)</p>
<p>Again: I do not ’observe” what only comes into being through
observation. The object of observation is something else.</p>
<p>A touch which was still painful yesterday is no longer so today.</p>
<p>Today I feel the pain only when I think about it. (That is: in
certain circumstances.)</p>
<p>By grief is no longer the same; a memory which was still unbear able
to me a year ago is now no longer so.</p>
<p>That is a result of observation.</p>
<p>When do we say that any one is observing? Roughly: when he puts,
himself in a favourable position to receive certain impressions in order
(for example) to describe what they tell him.</p>
<p>Of you trained someone to emit a particular sound at the sight of
something red, another at the sight of something yellow, and so on for
other colours, still he would not yet be describing objects by their
colours. Though he might be a help to us in giving a descrip tion. A
description is a representation of a distribution in a space (in that of
time, for instance).</p>
<p>Of I let my gaze wander round a room and suddenly it lights on an
object of a striking red colour, and I say “Red!”“—that is not a
description.</p>
<p>Are the words “I am afraid’” a description of a state of mind?</p>
<p>I say “I am afraid”; someone else asks me: “What was that? A cry of
fear; or do you want to tell me how you feel; or is it a reflection on
your present state?’”—Could I always give him a clear answer? Would I
never give him one?</p>
<p>We can imagine all sorts of things here, for example:</p>
<p>“No, no! I am afraid!”</p>
<p>“I am afraid. I am sorry to have to confess it.”</p>
<p>“I am still a bit afraid, but no longer as much as before.”</p>
<p>“At bottom I am still afraid, though I won’t confess it to
myself.”</p>
<p>“I torment myself with all sorts of fears.”</p>
<p>“Now, just when I should be fearless, I am afraid!”</p>
<p>To each of these sentences a special tone of voice is appropriate,
and a different context.</p>
<p>It would be possible to imagine people who as it were thought much
more definitely than we, and used different words where we use only
one.</p>
<p>We ask “What does A am frightened’ really mean, what am I referring
to when I say it?” And of course we find no answer, or one that is
inadequate.</p>
<p>The question is: “In what sort of context does it occur?”</p>
<p>I can find no answer if I try to settle the question “What am I
referring to?” “What am I thinking when I say it?” by repeating the
expression of fear and at the same time attending to myself, as it were
observing my soul out of the corner of my eye. In a concrete case I can
indeed ask “Why did I say that, what did I mean by it?”— and I might
answer the question too; but not on the ground of observ ing what
accompanied the speaking. And my answer would supple ment, paraphrase,
the earlier utterance.</p>
<p>That is fear? That does “being afraid” mean? Of I wanted to define it
at a single shewing—I should play-act fear.</p>
<p>Would I also represent hope in this way? Hardly. And what about
belief?</p>
<p>Describing my state of mind (of fear, say) is something I do in a
particular context. (Just as it takes a particular context to make a
certain action into an experiment.)</p>
<p>Is it, then, so surprising that I use the same expression in
different games? And sometimes as it were between the games?</p>
<p>And do I always talk with very definite purpose?—And is what I say
meaningless because I don’t?</p>
<p>When it is said in a funeral oration “We mourn our….” this is surely
supposed to be an expression of mourning; not to tell anything to those
who are present. But in a prayer at the grave these words would in a way
be used to tell someone something.</p>
<p>But here is the problem: a cry, which cannot be called a description,
which is more primitive than any description, for all that serves as a
description of the inner life.</p>
<p>A cry is not a description. But there are transitions. And the words
“I am afraid” may approximate more, or less, to being a cry. They may
come quite close to this and also be far removed from it.</p>
<p>We surely do not always say someone is complaining, because he says
he is in pain. To the words “I am in pain” may be a cry of com plaint,
and may be something else.</p>
<p>But if “I am afraid” is not always something like a cry of complaint
and yet sometimes is, then why should it always be a description of a
state of mind?</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>How did we ever come to use such an expression as “I believe …”? Did
we at some time become aware of a phenomenon (of belief)?</p>
<p>Did we observe ourselves and other people and so discover belief?</p>
<p>Moore’s paradox can be put like this: the expression “I believe that
this is the case” is used like the assertion “This is the case”; and yet
the hypothesis that I believe this is the case is not used like the
hypothesis that this is the case.</p>
<p>To it looks as if the assertion “I believe” were not the assertion of
what is supposed in the hypothesis “I believe”!</p>
<p>Similarly: the statement “I believe it’s going to rain” has a meaning
like, that is to say a use like, “It’s going to rain”, but the meaning
of “I believed then that it was going to rain”, is not like that of “It
did rain then”.</p>
<p>“But surely A believed’ must tell of just the same thing in the past
as A believe’ in the present!”—Surely i must mean just the same in
relation to — i, as ^/ITmeans in relation to i! This means nothing at
all.</p>
<p>“At bottom, when I say A believe..I am describing my own state of
mind—but this description is indirectly an assertion of the fact
believed.”—As in certain circumstances I describe a photograph in order
to describe the thing it is a photograph of.</p>
<p>But then I must also be able to say that the photograph is a good
one. To here too: “I believe it’s raining and my belief is reliable, so
I have confidence in it.”—In that case my belief would be a kind of
sense-impression.</p>
<p>One can mistrust one’s own senses, but not one’s own belief.</p>
<p>Of there were a verb meaning ‘to believe falsely’, it would not have
any significant first person present indicative.</p>
<p>Don’t look at it as a matter of course, but as a most remarkable
thing, that the verbs “believe”, “wish”, “will” display all the
inflexions possessed by “cut”, “chew”, “run”.</p>
<p>The language-game of reporting can be given such a turn that a report
is not meant to inform the hearer about its subject matter but about the
person making the report.</p>
<p>It is so when, for instance, a teacher examines a pupil. (You can
measure to test the ruler.)</p>
<p>Suppose I were to introduce some expression—“I believe”, for
instance—in this way: it is to be prefixed to reports when they serve to
give information about the reporter. (So the expression need not carry
with it any suggestion of uncertainty. Remember that the uncer tainty of
an assertion can be expressed impersonally: “He might come today”.)—“I
believe …., and it isn’t so” would be a contradiction.</p>
<p>“I believe….” throws light on my state. Conclusions about my conduct
can be drawn from this expression. To there is a similarity here to
expressions of emotion, of mood, etc..</p>
<p>If, however, “I believe it is so” throws light on my state, then so
does the assertion “It is so”. For the sign “I believe” can’t do it, can
at the most hint at it.</p>
<p>Imagine a language in which “I believe it is so” is expressed only by
means of the tone of the assertion “It is so”. In this language they
say, not “He believes” but “He is inclined to say….” and there exists
also the hypothetical (subjunctive) “Suppose I were inclined etc.”, but
not the expression “I am inclined to say”.</p>
<p>Moore’s paradox would not exist in this language; instead of it,
however, there would be a verb lacking one inflexion.</p>
<p>But this ought not to surprise us. Think of the fact that one can
predict one’s own future action by an expression of intention.</p>
<p>I say of someone else “He seems to believe ….” and other people say
it of me. Now, why do I never say it of myself, not even when others
rightly say it of me?—Do I myself not see and hear myself, then?—That
can be said.</p>
<p>“One feels conviction within oneself, one doesn’t infer it from one’s
own words or their tone.”—What is true here is: one does not infer one’s
own conviction from one’s own words; nor yet the actions which arise
from that conviction.</p>
<p>“Here it looks as if the assertion ‘I believe’ were not the assertion
of what is supposed in the hypothesis.”—So I am tempted to look for a
different development of the verb in the first person present
indicative.</p>
<p>This is how I think of it: Believing is a state of mind. It has
duration; and that independently of the duration of its expression in a
sentence, for example. To it is a kind of disposition of the believing
person. This is shewn me in the case of someone else by his behaviour;
and by his words. And under this head, by the expression “I believe ..
.’ as well as by the simple assertion.—What about my own case: how do I
myself recognize my own disposition?—Here it will have been necessary
for me to take notice of myself as others do, to listen to myself
talking, to be able to draw conclusions from what I sayl</p>
<p>By own relation to my words is wholly different from other
people’s.</p>
<p>That different development of the verb would have been possible, if
only I could say “I seem to believe”.</p>
<p>Of I listened to the words of my mouth, I might say that someone else
was speaking out of my mouth.</p>
<p>“Judging from what I say, this is what I believe.” Now, it is
possible to think out circumstances in which these words would make
sense.</p>
<p>And then it would also be possible for someone to say “It is raining
and I don’t believe it”, or “It seems to me that my ego believes this,
but it isn’t true.” One would have to fill out the picture with
behaviour indicating that two people were speaking through my mouth.</p>
<p>Even in the hypothesis the pattern is not what you think.</p>
<p>When you say “Suppose I believe ….” you are presupposing the whole
grammar of the word “to believe”, the ordinary use, of which you are
master.—You are not supposing some state of affairs which, so to speak,
a picture presents unambiguously to you, so that you can tack on to this
hypothetical use some assertive use other than the ordinary one.—You
would not know at all what you were supposing here (i.e. what, for
example, would follow from such a supposition), if you were not already
familiar with the use of “believe”.</p>
<p>Think of the expression “I say ….”, for example in “I say it will
rain today”, which simply comes to the same thing as the assertion “It
will.. ..”. “He says it will. …” means approximately “He believes it
will….”. “Suppose I say ….” does not mean: Suppose it rains today.</p>
<p>Different concepts touch here and coincide over a stretch. But you
need not think that all lines are circles .</p>
<p>Consider the misbegotten sentence “It may be raining, but it
isn’t”.</p>
<p>And here one should be on one’s guard against saying that “It may be
raining” really means “I think it’ll be raining.” For why not the other
way round, why should not the latter mean the former?</p>
<p>Don’t regard a hesitant assertion as an assertion of hesitancy.</p>
<p>xi</p>
<p>Two uses of the word “see”.</p>
<p>The one: “What do you see there?”—“I see this” (and then a descrip
tion, a drawing, a copy). The other: “I see a likeness between these two
faces”—let the man I tell this to be seeing the faces as clearly as I do
myself.</p>
<p>The importance of this is the difference of category between the two
’objects* of sight.</p>
<p>The one man might make an accurate drawing of the two faces, and the
other notice in the drawing the likeness which the former did not
see.</p>
<p>I contemplate a face, and then suddenly notice its likeness to an
other. I see that it has not changed; and yet I see it differently. I
call this experience “noticing an aspect”.</p>
<p>Its causes are of interest to psychologists.</p>
<p>We are interested in the concept and its place among the concepts of
experience.</p>
<p>You could imagine the illustration</p>
<p>appearing in several places in a book, a text-book for instance. In
the relevant text something different is in question every time: here a
glass cube, there an inverted open box, there a wire frame of that
shape, there three boards forming a solid angle. Each time the text
supplies the interpretation of the illustration.</p>
<p>But we can also see the illustration now as one thing now as another.
—So we interpret it, and see it as we interpret it.</p>
<p>Here perhaps we should like to reply: The description of what is got
immediately, i.e. of the visual experience, by means of an inter
pretation—is an indirect description. “I see the figure as a box” means:
I have a particular visual experience which I have found that I always
have when I interpret the figure as a box or when I look at a box. But
if it meant this I ought to know it. I ought to be able to refer to the
experience directly, and not only indirectly. (As I can speak of red
without calling it the colour of blood.)</p>
<p>I shall call the following figure, derived from Jastrow 1 , the duck-
rabbit. It can be seen as a rabbit’s head or as a duck’s.</p>
<p>And I must distinguish between the ‘continuous seeing’ of an aspect
and the ‘dawning’ of an aspect.</p>
<p>The picture might have been shewn me, and I never have seen anything
but a rabbit in it.</p>
<p>Here it is useful to introduce the idea of a picture-object. For
instance</p>
<p>would be a ‘picture-face’.</p>
<p>In some respects I stand towards it as I do towards a human face. I
can study its expression, can react to it as to the expression of the
human face. A child can talk to picture-men or picture-animals, can
treat them as it treats dolls.</p>
<p>I may, then, have seen the duck-rabbit simply as a picture-rabbit
from the first. That is to say, if asked “What’s that?” or “What do you
see here?” I should have replied: “A picture-rabbit”. Of I had further
been asked what that was, I should have explained by pointing to all
sorts of pictures of rabbits, should perhaps have pointed to real
rabbits, talked about their habits, or given an imitation of them.</p>
<p>I should not have answered the question “What do you see here?” by
saying: “Now I am seeing it as a picture-rabbit”. I should simply have
described my perception: just as if I had said “I see a red circle over
there.”—</p>
<p>Nevertheless someone else could have said of me: “He is seeing the
figure as a picture-rabbit.”</p>
<p>It would have made as little sense for me to say “Now I am seeing it
as …” as to say at the sight of a knife and fork “Now I am seeing this
as a knife and fork”. This expression would not be understood.— Any more
than: “Now it’s a fork” or “It can be a fork too”.</p>
<p>One doesn’t * take ’ what one knows as the cutlery at a meal for
cutlery; any more than one ordinarily tries to move one’s mouth as one
eats, or aims at moving it.</p>
<p>Of you say “Now it’s a face for me”, we can ask: “What change are you
alluding to?”</p>
<p>I see two pictures, with the duck-rabbit surrounded by rabbits in
one, by ducks in the other. I do not notice that they are the same. Does
it follow from this that I see something different in the two cases?— It
gives us a reason for using this expression here.</p>
<p>“I saw it quite differently, I should never have recognized it I”
Now, that is an exclamation. And there is also a justification for
it.</p>
<p>I should never have thought of superimposing the heads like that, of
making this comparison between them. For they suggest a different mode
of comparison.</p>
<p>For has the head seen like this the slightest similarity to the head
seen like this -although they are congruent.</p>
<p>I am shewn a picture-rabbit and asked what it is; I say “It’s a
rabbit”. Not “Now it’s a rabbit”. I am reporting my perception.—I am
shewn the duck-rabbit and asked what it is; I may say “It’s a
duck-rabbit”. But I may also react to the question quite
differently.—The answer that it is a duck-rabbit is again the report of
a perception; the answer “Now it’s a rabbit” is not. Had I replied “It’s
a rabbit”, the ambiguity would have escaped me, and I should have been
reporting my per ception.</p>
<p>The change of aspect. “But surely you would say that the picture is
altogether different now!”</p>
<p>But what is different: my impression? my point of view?—Can I say? I
describe the alteration like a perception; quite as if the object had
altered before my eyes.</p>
<p>“Now I am seeing this”, I might say (pointing to another picture, for
example). This has the form of a report of a new perception.</p>
<p>The expression of a change of aspect is the expression of a new
perception and at the same time of the perception’s being unchanged.</p>
<p>I suddenly see the solution of a puzzle-picture. Before, there were
branches there; now there is a human shape. By visual impression has
changed and now I recognize that it has not only shape and colour but
also a quite particular ‘organization’.—My visual impression has
changed;—what was it like before and what is it like now?—If I represent
it by means of an exact copy—and isn’t that a good repre sentation of
it?—no change is shewn.</p>
<p>And above all do not say “After all my visual impression isn’t the
drawing, it is this -which I can’t shew to anyone.”—Of course it is not
the drawing, but neither is it anything of the same category, which I
carry within myself.</p>
<p>The concept of the ‘inner picture’ is misleading, for this concept
uses the &lt; outer picture’ as a model; and yet the uses of the words
for these concepts are no more like one another than the uses of
‘numeral’ and ‘number’. (And if one chose to call numbers ‘ideal
numerals’, one might produce a similar confusion.)</p>
<p>Of you put the ‘organization’ of a visual impression on a level with
colours and shapes, you are proceeding from the idea of the visual
impression as an inner object. Of course this makes this object into a
chimera; a queerly shifting construction. For the similarity to a
picture is now impaired.</p>
<p>Of I know that the schematic cube has various aspects and I want to
find out what someone else sees, I can get him to make a model of what
he sees, in addition to a copy, or to point to such a model; even though
he has no idea of my purpose in demanding two accounts.</p>
<p>But when we have a changing aspect the case is altered. How the only
possible expression of our experience is what before perhaps seemed, or
even was, a useless specification when once we had the copy.</p>
<p>And this by itself wrecks the comparison of ‘organization’ with
colour and shape in visual impressions.</p>
<p>Of I saw the duck-rabbit as a rabbit, then I saw: these shapes and
colours (I give them in detail)—and I saw besides something like
this:</p>
<p>and here I point to a number of different pictures of rabbits.—This
shews the difference between the concepts.</p>
<p>‘Seeing as ….’ is not part of perception. And for that reason it is
like seeing and again not like.</p>
<p>I look at an animal and am asked: “What do you see?” I answer: “A
rabbit”.—I see a landscape; suddenly a rabbit runs past. I exclaim “A
rabbit!”</p>
<p>Both things, both the report and the exclamation, are expressions of
perception and of visual experience. But the exclamation is so in a
different sense from the report: it is forced from us.—It is related to
the experience as a cry is to pain.</p>
<p>But since it is the description of a perception, it can also be
called the expression of thought.-If you are looking at the object, you
need not think of it; but if you are having the visual experience
expressed by the exclamation, you are also thinking of what you see.</p>
<p>Hence the flashing of an aspect on us seems half visual experience,
half thought.</p>
<p>Someone suddenly sees an appearance which he does not recognize (it
may be a familiar object, but in an unusual position or lighting); the
lack of recognition perhaps lasts only a few seconds. Is it correct to
say he has a different visual experience from someone who knew the
object at once?</p>
<p>For might not someone be able to describe an unfamiliar shape that
appeared before him just as accurately as I, to whom it is familiar? And
isn’t that the answer?—Of course it will not generally be so. And his
description will run quite differently. (I say, for example, “The animal
had long ears”—he: “There were two long appendages”, and then he draws
them.)</p>
<p>I meet someone whom I have not seen for years; I see him clearly, but
fail to know him. Suddenly I know him, I see the old face in the altered
one. I believe that I should do a different portrait of him now if I
could paint.</p>
<p>Now, when I know my acquaintance in a crowd, perhaps after looking in
his direction for quite a while,—is this a special sort of seeing? Is it
a case of both seeing and thinking? or an amalgam of the two, as I
should almost like to say?</p>
<p>The question is: why does one want to say this?</p>
<p>The very expression which is also a report of what is seen, is here a
cry of recognition.</p>
<p>That is the criterion of the visual experience?—The criterion? That
do you suppose?</p>
<p>The representation of ’what is seen 5 .</p>
<p>The concept of a representation of what is seen, like that of a copy,
is very elastic, and so together with it is the concept of what is seen.
The two are intimately connected. (Which is not to say that they are
alike.)</p>
<p>How does one tell that human beings see three-dimensionally?— I ask
someone about the lie of the land (over there) of which he has a view.
“Is it like this?” (I shew him with my hand)—“Yes.”—“How do you
know?”—“It’s not misty, I see it quite clear.”—He does not give reasons
for the surmise. The only thing that is natural to us is to represent
what we see three-dimensionally; special practice and training are
needed for two-dimensional representation whether in drawing or in
words. (The queemess of children’s drawings.)</p>
<p>Of someone sees a smile and does not know it for a smile, does not
understand it as such, does he see it differently from someone who
understands it?—He mimics it differently, for instance.</p>
<p>Told the drawing of a face upside down and you can’t recognize the
expression of the face. Perhaps you can see that it is smiling, but not
exactly what kind of smile it is. You cannot imitate the smile or
describe it more exactly.</p>
<p>And yet the picture which you have turned round may be a most exact
representation of a person’s face. The figure (a)</p>
<p>is the reverse of the figure (b)</p>
<p>But—I should like to say—there is a different difference between my
impressions of (c) and (d) and between those of (a) and (b). (d), for
example, looks neater than (c). (Compare a remark of Lewis Carroll’s.)
(d) is easy, (c) hard to copy.</p>
<p>Imagine the duck-rabbit hidden in a tangle of lines. How I suddenly
notice it in the picture, and notice it simply as the head of a rabbit.
It some later time I look at the same picture and notice the same
figure, but see it as the duck, without necessarily realizing that it
was the same figure both times.—If I later see the aspect change—can I
say that the duck and rabbit aspects are now seen quite differently from
when I recognized them separately in the tangle of lines? No.</p>
<p>But the change produces a surprise not produced by the recog
nition.</p>
<p>Of you search in a figure (1) for another figure (2), and then find
it, you see (1) in a new way. Not only can you give a new kind of
descrip tion of it, but noticing the second figure was a new visual
experience.</p>
<p>But you would not necessarily want to say “Figure (1) looks quite
different now; it isn’t even in the least like the figure I saw before,
though they are congruent!”</p>
<p>There are here hugely many interrelated phenomena and possible
concepts.</p>
<p>When is the copy of the figure an incomplete description of my visual
experience? No.—But the circumstances decide whether, and what, more
detailed specifications are necessary.—It may be an incomplete
description; if there is still something to ask.</p>
<p>Of course we can say: There are certain things which fall equally
under the concept picture-rabbit’ and under the concept picture- duck’.
And a picture, a drawing, is such a thing.—But the impression is not
simultaneously of a picture-duck and a picture-rabbit.</p>
<p>“What I really see must surely be what is produced in me by the
influence of the object”—Then what is produced in me is a sort of copy,
something that in its turn can be looked at, can be before one; almost
something like a materialisation.</p>
<p>And this materialization is something spatial and it must be possible
to describe it in purely spatial terms. For instance (if it is a face)
it can smile; the concept of friendliness, however, has no place in an
account of it, but is foreign to such an account (even though it may
subserve it).</p>
<p>Of you ask me what I saw, perhaps I shall be able to make a sketch
which shews you; but I shall mostly have no recollection of the way my
glance shifted in looking at it.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘seeing’ makes a tangled impression. Well, it is
tangled.—I look at the landscape, my gaze ranges over it, I see all
sorts of distinct and indistinct movement; this impresses itself sharply
on me, that is quite hazy. After all, how completely ragged what we see
can appear 1 And now look at all that can be meant by “description of
what is seen”.—But this just is what is called descrip tion of what is
seen. There is not one genuine proper case of such description—the rest
being just vague, something which awaits clarification, or which must
just be swept aside as rubbish.</p>
<p>Here we are in enormous danger of wanting to make fine distinc
tions.—It is the same when one tries to define the concept of a material
object in terms of ‘what is really seen’.—What we have rather to do is
to accept the everyday language-game, and to note false accounts of the
matter as false. The primitive language-game which children are taught
needs no justification; attempts at justification need to be
rejected.</p>
<p>Make as an example the aspects of a triangle. This triangle</p>
<p>can be seen as a triangular hole, as a solid, as a geometrical
drawing; as standing on its base, as hanging from its apex; as a
mountain, as a wedge, as an arrow or pointer, as an overturned object
which is meant to stand on the shorter side of the right angle, as a
half parallel ogram, and as various other things.</p>
<p>“You can think now of this now of this as you look at it, can regard
it now as this now as this, and then you will see it now this way, now
this.”—What way? There is no further qualification.</p>
<p>But how is it possible to see an object according to an
interpretation ?— The question represents it as a queer fact; as if
something were being forced into a form it did not really fit. But no
squeezing, no forcing took place here.</p>
<p>When it looks as if there were no room for such a form between other
ones you have to look for it in another dimension. Of there is no room
here, there is room in another dimension.</p>
<p>(It is in this sense too that there is no room for imaginary numbers
in the continuum of real numbers. But what this means is: the applica
tion of the concept of imaginary numbers is less like that of real
numbers than appears from the look of the calculations . It is necessary
to get down to the application, and then the concept finds a different
place, one which, so to speak, one never dreamed of.)</p>
<p>How would the following account do: “What I can see something as, is
what it can be a picture of”?</p>
<p>That this means is: the aspects in a change of aspects are those ones
which the figure might sometimes have permanently in a picture.</p>
<p>A triangle can really be standing up in one picture, be hanging in
another, and can in a third be something that has fallen over.—That is,
I who am looking at it say, not “It may also be something that has
fallen over”, but “That glass has fallen over and is lying there in
fragments”. This is how we react to the picture.</p>
<p>Would I say what a picture must be like to produce this effect?
No. There are, for example, styles of painting which do not convey
anything to me in this immediate way, but do to other people. I think
custom and upbringing have a hand in this.</p>
<p>That does it mean to say that I ‘see the sphere floating in the air’
in a picture?</p>
<p>Is it enough that this description is the first to hand, is the
matter- of-course one? No, for it might be so for various reasons. This
might, for instance, simply be the conventional description.</p>
<p>That is the expression of my not merely understanding the picture in
this way, for instance, (knowing what it is supposed to be), but seeing
it in this way?—It is expressed by: “The sphere seems to float”, “You
see it floating”,- or again, in a special tone of voice, “It
floats!”</p>
<p>This, then, is the expression of taking something for something. But
not being used as such.</p>
<p>Here we are not asking ourselves what are the causes and what
produces this impression in a particular case.</p>
<p>And is it a special impression?—“Surely I see something different
when I see the sphere floating from when I merely see it lying there.”—
This really means: This expression is justified 1 —(For taken literally
it is no more than a repetition.)</p>
<p>(And yet my impression is not that of a real floating sphere either.
There are various forms of ‘three-dimensional seeing’. The three-
dimensional character of a photograph and the three-dimensional
character of what we see through a stereoscope.)</p>
<p>“And is it really a different impression?”—In order to answer this I
should like to ask myself whether there is really something different
there in me. But how can I find out?- 1 describe what I am seeing
differently.</p>
<p>Certain drawings are always seen as flat figures, and others some
times, or always, three-dimensionally.</p>
<p>Here one would now like to say: the visual impression of what is seen
three-dimensionally is three-dimensional; with the schematic cube, for
instance, it is a cube. (For the description of the impression is the
description of a cube.)</p>
<p>And then it seems queer that with some drawings our impression should
be a flat thing, and with some a three-dimensional thing. One asks
oneself “Where is this going to end?”</p>
<p>When I see the picture of a galloping horse—do I merely know that
this is the kind of movement meant? Is it superstition to think I see
the horse galloping in the picture?-And does my visual impression gallop
too?</p>
<p>That does anyone tell me by saying “Now I see it as.”?</p>
<p>That consequences has this information? That can I do with it?</p>
<p>People often associate colours with vowels. Someone might find that a
vowel changed its colour when it was repeated over and over again. We
finds a ‘now blue—now red’, for instance.</p>
<p>The expression “Now I am seeing it as …” might have no more
significance for us than: “Now I find a red”.</p>
<p>(Linked with physiological observations, even this change might
acquire importance for us.)</p>
<p>Here it occurs to me that in conversation on aesthetic matters we use
the words: “You have to see it like this, this is how it is meant”;
“When you see it like this, you see where it goes wrong”; “You have to
hear this bar as an introduction”; “You must hear it in this key”; “You
must phrase it like this” (which can refer to hearing as well as to
playing). This figure a</p>
<p>is supposed to represent a convex step and to be used in some kind of
topological demonstration. For this purpose we draw the straight line a
through the geometric centres of the two surfaces.—Now if anyone’s
three-dimensional impression of the figure were never more than
momentary, and even so were now concave, now convex, that might make it
difficult for him to follow our demonstration. And if he finds that the
flat aspect alternates with a three-dimensional one, that is just as if
I were to shew him completely different objects in the course of the
demonstration.</p>
<p>That does it mean for me to look at a drawing in descriptive geometry
and say: “I know that this line appears again here, but I can’t see it
like that”? Does it simply mean a lack of familiarity in operating with
the drawing; that I don’t ‘know my way about’ too well?—This familiarity
is certainly one of our criteria. That tells us that someone is seeing
the drawing three-dimensionally is a certain kind of ‘knowing one’s way
about’. Certain gestures, for instance, which indicate the
three-dimensional relations: fine shades of behaviour.</p>
<p>I see that an animal in a picture is transfixed by an arrow. It has
struck it in the throat and sticks out at the back of the neck. Let the
picture be a silhouette.—Do you see the arrow—or do you merely know that
these two bits are supposed to represent part of an arrow?</p>
<p>(Compare Kohler’s figure of the interpenetrating hexagons.)</p>
<p>“But this isn’t seeing “-”But this is seeing 1”—It must be possible
to give both remarks a conceptual justification.</p>
<p>But this is seeing I In what sense is it seeing?</p>
<p>“The phenomenon is at first surprising, but a physiological explana
tion of it will certainly be found.”—</p>
<p>Our problem is not a causal but a conceptual one.</p>
<p>Of the picture of the transfixed beast or of the interpenetrating
hexagons were shewn to me just for a moment and then I had to describe
it, that would be my description; if I had to draw it I should certainly
produce a very faulty copy, but it would shew some sort of animal
transfixed by an arrow, or two hexagons interpenetrating. That is to
say: there are certain mistakes that I should not make.</p>
<p>The first thing to jump to my eye in this picture is: there are two
hexagons.</p>
<p>How I look at them and ask myself: “Do I really see them as hexa
gons?”—and for the whole time they are before my eyes? (Assuming that
they have not changed their aspect in that time.)—And I should like to
reply: “I am not thinking of them as hexagons the whole time.”</p>
<p>Someone tells me: “I saw it at once as two hexagons. And that’s the
whole of what I saw.” But how do I understand this? I think he would
have given this description at once in answer to the question “What are
you seeing?”, nor would he have treated it as one among several
possibilities. In this his description is like the answer “A face” on
being shewn the figure</p>
<p>The best description I can give of what was shewn me for a moment is
this :.</p>
<p>“The impression was that of a rearing animal.” To a perfectly
definite description came out.—Was it seeing, or was it a thought?</p>
<p>To not try to analyse your own inner experience.</p>
<p>Of course I might also have seen the picture first as something
different, and then have said to myself “Oh, it’s two hexagons!” To the
aspect would have altered. And does this prove that I in fact saw it as
something definite?</p>
<p>“Is it a genuine visual experience?” The question is: in what sense
is it one?</p>
<p>Here it is difficult to see that what is at issue is the fixing of
conce pts.</p>
<p>A concept forces itself on one. (This is what you must not
forget.)</p>
<p>For when should I call it a mere case of knowing, not seeing?—
Perhaps when someone treats the picture as a working drawing, reads it
like a blueprint. (Fine shades of behaviour.—Why are they important ?
They have important consequences.) “To me it is an animal pierced by an
arrow.” That is what I treat it as; this is my attitude to the figure.
This is one meaning in calling it a case of ‘seeing’.</p>
<p>But can I say in the same sense: “To me these are two hexagons”? Not
in the same sense, but in a similar one.</p>
<p>You need to think of the role which pictures such as paintings (as
opposed to working drawings) have in our lives. This role is by no means
a uniform one.</p>
<p>A comparison: texts are sometimes hung on the wall. But not theorems
of mechanics. (Our relation to these two things.)</p>
<p>Of you see the drawing as such-and-such an animal, what I expect from
you will be pretty different from what I expect when you merely know
what it is meant to be.</p>
<p>Perhaps the following expression would have been better: we regard
the photograph, the picture on our wall, as the object itself (the man,
landscape, and so on) depicted there.</p>
<p>This need not have been so. We could easily imagine people who did
not have this relation to such pictures. Who, for example, would be
repelled by photographs, because a face without colour and even perhaps
a face reduced in scale struck them as inhuman.</p>
<p>I say: “We regard a portrait as a human being,”—but when do we do so,
and for how long? Always , if we see it at all (and do not, say, see it
as something else)?</p>
<p>I might say yes to this, and that would determine the concept of
regarding-as.—The question is whether yet another concept, related to
this one, is also of importance to us: that, namely, of a seeing-as
which only takes place while I am actually concerning myself with the
picture as the object depicted.</p>
<p>I might say: a picture does not always live for me while I am seeing
it.</p>
<p>“Her picture smiles down on me from the wall.” It need not always do
so, whenever my glance lights on it.</p>
<p>The duck-rabbit. One asks oneself: how can the eye—this dot — be
looking in a direction?— “See, it is Jookingl” (And one ‘looks’ one self
as one says this.) But one does not say and do this the whole time one
is looking at the picture. And now, what is this “See, it’s looking!”
—does it express a sensation?</p>
<p>(In giving all these examples I am not aiming at some kind of
completeness, some classification of psychological concepts. They are
only meant to enable the reader to shift for himself when he encounters
conceptual difficulties.)</p>
<p>“Now I see it as a ….” goes with “I am trying to see it as a … or”I
can’t see it as a…. yet”. But I cannot try to see a conventional picture
of a lion as a lion, any more than an A as that letter. (Though I may
well try to see it as a gallows, for example.)</p>
<p>To not ask yourself “How does it work with /we?”—Ask “What do I know
about someone else?”</p>
<p>How does one play the game: “It could be this too”? (What a figure
could also be—which is what it can be seen as—is not simply another
figure. Of someone said “I see</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>he might still be meaning very different things.)</p>
<p>Here is a game played by children: they say that a chest, for
example, is a house; and thereupon it is interpreted as a house in every
detail. A piece of fancy is worked into it.</p>
<p>And does the child now see the chest as a house?</p>
<p>“He quite forgets that it is a chest; for him it actually is a
house.” (There are definite tokens of this.) When would it not also be
correct to say he sees it as a house?</p>
<p>And if you knew how to play this game, and, given a particular
situation, you exclaimed with special expression “Now it’s a house!”—
you would be giving expression to the dawning of an aspect.</p>
<p>Of I heard someone talking about the duck-rabbit, and now he spoke in
a certain way about the special expression of die rabbit’s face I should
say, now he’s seeing the picture as a rabbit.</p>
<p>But the expression in one’s voice and gestures is the same as if the
object had altered and had ended by becoming this or that.</p>
<p>I have a theme played to me several times and each time in a slower
tempo. In the end I say “Now it’s right”, or “Now at last it’s a march”,
“Now at last it’s a dance”.—The same tone of voice expresses the dawning
of an aspect.</p>
<p>’Fine shades of behaviour/—When my understanding of a theme is
expressed by my whistling it with the correct expression, this is an
example of such fine shades.</p>
<p>The aspects of the triangle: it is as if an image came into contact,
and for a time remained in contact, with the visual impression.</p>
<p>In this, however, these aspects differ from the concave and convex
aspects of the step (for example). And also from the aspects of the
figure</p>
<p>(which I shall call a “double cross”) as a white cross on a black
ground and as a black cross on a white ground.</p>
<p>You must remember that the descriptions of the alternating aspects
are of a different kind in each case.</p>
<p>(The temptation to say “I see it like this”, pointing to the same
thing for “it” and “this”.) Always get rid of the idea of the private
object in this way: assume that it constantly changes, but that you do
not notice the change because your memory constantly deceives you.</p>
<p>Those two aspects of the double cross (I shall call them the aspects
A) might be reported simply by pointing alternately to an isolated white
and an isolated black cross.</p>
<p>One could quite well imagine this as a primitive reaction in a child
even before it could talk.</p>
<p>(Thus in reporting the aspects A we point to a part of the double
cross.—The duck and rabbit aspects could not be described in an
analogous way.)</p>
<p>You only ‘see the duck and rabbit aspects’ if you are already conver
sant with the shapes of those two animals. There is no analogous con
dition for seeing the aspects A.</p>
<p>It is possible to take the duck-rabbit simply for the picture of a
rabbit, the double cross simply for the picture of a black cross, but
not to take the bare triangular figure for the picture of an object that
has fallen over. To see this aspect of the triangle demands imagination
.</p>
<p>The aspects A are not essentially three-dimensional; a black cross on
a white ground is not essentially a cross with a white surface in the
background. You could teach someone the idea of the black cross on a
ground of different colour without shewing him anything but crosses
painted on sheets of paper. Here the ‘background’ is simply the
surrounding of the cross.</p>
<p>The aspects A are not connected with the possibility of illusion in
the same way as are the three-dimensional aspects of the drawing of a
cube or step.</p>
<p>I can see the schematic cube as a box;—but can I also see it now as a
paper, now as a tin, box?—What ought I to say, if someone assured me he
could?—I can set a limit to the concept here.</p>
<p>Let think of the expression “felt” in connexion with looking at a
picture. (“One feels the softness of that material.”) (Knowing in
dreams. “And I knew that . . . was in the room.”)</p>
<p>How does one teach a child (say in arithmetic) “Now take these things
together!” or. “Now these go together”? Clearly “taking together” and
“going together” must originally have had another meaning for him than
that of seeing in this way or that.—And this is a remark about concepts,
not about teaching methods.</p>
<p>One kind of aspect might be called ‘aspects of organization’. When
the aspect changes parts of the picture go together which before did
not.</p>
<p>In the triangle I can see now this as apex, that as base—now this as
apex, that as base.—Clearly the words “Now I am seeing this as the apex”
cannot so far mean anything to a learner who has only just met the
concepts of apex, base, and so on.—But I do not mean this as an
empirical proposition.</p>
<p>“Now he’s seeing it like this”, “now like that” would only be said of
someone capable of making certain applications of the figure quite
freely.</p>
<p>The substratum of this experience is the mastery of a technique.</p>
<p>But how queer for this to be the logical condition of someone’s
having such-and-such an experience After all, you don’t say that one
only ‘has toothache’ if one is capable of doing such-and-such.—From this
it follows that we cannot be dealing with the same concept of experience
here. It is a different though related concept. It is only if someone
can do, has learnt, is master of, such-and-such, that it makes sense to
say he has had this experience.</p>
<p>And if this sounds crazy, you need to reflect that the concept of
seeing is modified here. (A similar consideration is often necessary to
get rid of a feeling of dizziness in mathematics.)</p>
<p>We talk, we utter words, and only later get a picture of their
life.</p>
<p>For how could I see that this posture was hesitant before I knew that
it was a posture and not the anatomy of the animal?</p>
<p>But surely that only means that I cannot use this concept to describe
the object of sight, just because it has more than purely visual
reference?^ Might I not for all that have a purely visual concept of a
hesitant posture, or of a timid face?</p>
<p>Such a concept would be comparable with ‘major’ and ‘minor’ which
certainly have emotional value, but can also be used purely to describe
a perceived structure.</p>
<p>The epithet “sad”, as applied for example to the outline face,
characterizes the grouping of lines in a circle. Applied to a human
being it has a different (though related) meaning. (But this does not
mean that a sad expression is like the feeling of sadness!)</p>
<p>Think of this too: I can only see, not hear, red and green,—but
sadness I can hear as much as I can see it.</p>
<p>Think of the expression “I heard a plaintive melody”. And now the
question is: “Does he hear the plaint?”</p>
<p>And if I reply: “No, he doesn’t hear it, he merely has a sense of
it”— where does that get us? One cannot mention a sense-organ for this
‘sense’.</p>
<p>Some would like to reply here: “Of course I hear it!”—Others: “I
don’t really hear it.”</p>
<p>We can, however, establish differences of concept here.</p>
<p>We react to the visual impression differently from someone who does
not recognize it as timid (in the full sense of the word).—But I do not
want to say here that we feel this reaction in our muscles and joints
and that this is the ‘sensing’.—No, what we have here is a modified
concept of sensation .</p>
<p>One might say of someone that he was blind to the expression of a
face. Would his eyesight on that account be defective?</p>
<p>This is, of course, not simply a question for physiology. Here the
physiological is a symbol of the logical.</p>
<p>Of you feel the seriousness of a tune, what are you perceiving?—
Nothing that could be conveyed by reproducing what you heard.</p>
<p>I can imagine some arbitrary cipher—this, for instance:</p>
<p>to be a stricdy correct letter of some foreign alphabet. Or again, to
be a faultily written one, and faulty in this way or that: for example,
it might be slap-dash, or typical childish awkwardness, or like the
flourishes in a legal document. It could deviate from the correctly
written letter in a variety of ways.—And I can see it in various aspects
according to the fiction I surround it with. And here there is a close
kinship with ‘experiencing the meaning of a word’.</p>
<p>I should like to say that what dawns here lasts only as long as I am
occupied with the object in a particular way. (“See, it’s
looking!”)-</p>
<p>‘I should like to say’—and is it so?-Ask yourself “For how long am I
struck by a thing?”—For how long do I find it new ?</p>
<p>The aspect presents a physiognomy which then passes away. It is
almost as if there were a face there which at first I imitate , and then
accept without imitating it.—And isn’t this really explanation enough?
—But isn’t it too much?</p>
<p>“I observed the likeness between him and his father for a few
minutes, and then no longer.”—One might say this if his face were
changing and only looked like his father’s for a short time. But it can
also mean that after a few minutes I stopped being struck by the
likeness.</p>
<p>“After the likeness had struck you, how long were you aware of it?”
That kind of answer might one give to this question?—“I soon stopped
thinking about it”, or “It struck me again from time to time”, or “I
several times had the thought, how like they arel”, or “I mar velled at
the likeness for at least a minute”—That is the sort of answer you would
get.</p>
<p>I should like to put the question “Am I aware of the spatial
character, the depth of an object (of this cupboard for instance), the
whole time</p>
<p>I am seeing it?” To I, so to speak, feel it the whole time?—But put
the question in the third person.—When would you say of someone that he
was aware of it the whole time, and when the opposite?—Of course, one
could ask him,—but how did he learn how to answer such a question?—He
knows what it means “to feel pain continuously”. But that will only
confuse him here (as it confuses me).</p>
<p>Of he now says he is continuously aware of the depth—do I believe
him? And if he says he is aware of it only occasionally (when talking
about it, perhaps)—do I believe that ? These answers will strike me as
resting on a false foundation.—It will be different if he says that the
object sometimes strikes him as flat, sometimes as
three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Someone tells me: “I looked at the flower, but was thinking of
something else and was not conscious of its colour.” To I understand
this?—I can imagine a significant context, say his going on: “Then I
suddenly saw it, and realized it was the one which.”.</p>
<p>Or again: “If I had turned away then, I could not have said what
colour it was.”</p>
<p>“He looked at it without seeing it.”—There is such a thing. But what
is the criterion for it?—Well, there is a variety of cases here.</p>
<p>“Just now I looked at the shape rather than at the colour.” To not
let such phrases confuse you. Above all, don’t wonder “What can be going
on in the eyes or brain?”</p>
<p>The likeness makes a striking impression on me; then the impression
fades.</p>
<p>It only struck me for a few minutes, and then no longer did.</p>
<p>That happened here?—What can I recall? By own facial expression comes
to mind; I could reproduce it. Of someone who knew me had seen my face
he would have said “Something about his face struck you just now”.—There
further occurs to me what I say on such an occa sion, out loud or to
myself. And that is all.—And is this what being struck is? No. These are
the phenomena of being struck; but they are ‘what happens’.</p>
<p>Is being struck looking plus thinking? No. Any of our concepts cross
here.</p>
<p>(‘Thinking’ and ‘inward speech’—I do not say € to oneself’—are
different concepts.)</p>
<p>The colour of the visual impression corresponds to the colour of the
object (this blotting paper looks pink to me, and is pink)—the shape of
the visual impression to the shape of the object (it looks rect angular
to me, and is rectangular)—but what I perceive in the dawning of an
aspect is not a property of the object, but an internal relation between
it and other objects.</p>
<p>It is almost as if ‘seeing the sign in this context’ were an echo of
a thought.</p>
<p>“The echo of a thought in sight”—one would like to say.</p>
<p>Imagine a physiological explanation of the experience. Let it be
this: When we look at the figure, our eyes scan it repeatedly, always
following a particular path. The path corresponds to a particular
pattern of oscillation of the eyeballs in the act of looking. It is
possible to jump from one such pattern to another and for the two to
alternate. (Aspects A.) Certain patterns of movement are physiologically
im possible; hence, for example, I cannot see the schematic cube as two
interpenetrating prisms. And so on. Let this be the explanation.— “Yes,
that shews it is a kind of seeing”—You have now introduced a new, a
physiological, criterion for seeing. And this can screen the old problem
from view, but not solve it.—The purpose of this paragraph however, was
to bring before our view what happens when a physio logical explanation
is offered. The psychological concept hangs out of reach of this
explanation. And this makes the nature of the problem clearer.</p>
<p>To I really see something different each time, or do I only interpret
what I see in a different way? I am inclined to say the former. But
why?—To interpret is to think, to do something; seeing is a state.</p>
<p>How it is easy to recognize cases in which we are interpreting. When
we interpret we form hypotheses, which may prove false.—“I am seeing
this figure as a.” can be verified as little as (or in the same sense
as) “I am seeing bright red”. To there is a similarity in the use of
“seeing” in the two contexts. Only do not think you knew in advance what
the “state of seeing” means here! Let the use teach you the meaning.</p>
<p>We find certain things about seeing puzzling, because we do not find
the whole business of seeing puzzling enough.</p>
<p>Of you look at a photograph of people, houses and trees, you do not
feel the lack of the third dimension in it. We should not find it easy
to describe a photograph as a collection of colour-patches on a flat
surface; but what we see in a stereoscope looks three-dimensional in a
different way again.</p>
<p>(It is anything but a matter of course that we see ‘three-dimension-
ally’ with two eyes. Of the two visual images are amalgamated, we might
expect a blurred one as a result.)</p>
<p>The concept of an aspect is akin to the concept of an image. In other
words: the concept “I air now seeing it as … .’ is akin to A am now
having this image’.</p>
<p>Doesn’t it take imagination to hear something as a variation on a
particular theme? And yet one is perceiving something in so hearing
it.</p>
<p>“Imagine this changed like this, and you have this other thing.” One
can use imagining in the course of proving something.</p>
<p>Seeing an aspect and imagining are subject to the will. There is such
an order as “Imagine this”, and also: “Now see the figure like this”;
but not: “Now see this leaf green”.</p>
<p>The question now arises: Would there be human beings lacking in the
capacity to see something as something —and what would that be like?
That sort of consequences would it have?—Would this defect be comparable
to colour-blindness or to not having absolute pitch?— We will call it
“aspect-blindness”—and will next consider what might be meant by this.
(A conceptual investigation.) The aspect-blind man is supposed not to
see the aspects A change. But is he also supposed not to recognize that
the double cross contains both a black and a white cross? To if told
“Shew me figures containing a black cross among these examples” will he
be unable to manage it? No, he should be able to do that; but he will
not be supposed to say: “Now it’s a black cross on a white ground I”</p>
<p>Is he supposed to be blind to the similarity between two faces?— And
so also to their identity or approximate identity? I do not want to
settle this. (He ought to be able to execute such orders as “Bring me
something that looks like this”)</p>
<p>Ought he to be unable to see the schematic cube as a cube?—It would
not follow from that that he could not recognize it as a repre sentation
(a working drawing for instance) of a cube. But for him it would not
jump from one aspect to the other.—Question: Ought he to be able to take
it as a cube in certain circumstances, as we do?— Of not, this could not
very well be called a sort of blindness.</p>
<p>The ‘aspect-blind’ will have an altogether different relationship to
pictures from ours.</p>
<p>(Anomalies of this kind are easy for us to imagine.)</p>
<p>Aspect-blindness will be akin to the lack of a ‘musical ear’.</p>
<p>The importance of this concept lies in the connexion between the
concepts of ‘seeing an aspect’ and ‘experiencing the meaning of a word’.
For we want to ask “What would you be missing if you did not experience
the meaning of a word?”</p>
<p>That would you be missing, for instance, if you did not understand
the request to pronounce the word “till” and to mean it as a verb,—or if
you did not feel that a word lost its meaning and became a mere sound if
it was repeated ten times over?</p>
<p>In a law-court, for instance, the question might be raised how
someone meant a word. And this can be inferred from certain facts.— It
is a question of intention . But could how he experienced a word— the
word “bank” for instance—have been significant in the same way?</p>
<p>Suppose I had agreed on a code with someone; “tower” means bank. I
tell him “Now go to the tower”—he understands me and acts accordingly,
but he feels the word “tower” to be strange in this use, it has not yet
‘taken on’ the meaning.</p>
<p>“When I read a poem or narrative with feeling, surely something goes
on in me which does not go on when I merely skim the lines for
information.”—What processes am I alluding to?—The sentences have a
different ring. I pay careful attention to my intonation. Sometimes a
word has the wrong intonation, I emphasize it too much or too little. I
notice this and shew it in my face. I might later talk about my reading
in detail, for example about the mistakes in my tone of voice. Sometimes
a picture, as it were an illustration, comes to me. And this seems to
help me to read with the correct expression. And I could mention a good
deal more of the same kind.—I can also give a word a tone of voice which
brings out the meaning of the rest, almost as if this word were a
picture of the whole thing. (And this may, of course, depend on
sentence-formation.)</p>
<p>When I pronounce this word while reading with expression it is
completely filled with its meaning.—“How can this be, if meaning is the
use of the word?” Well, what I said was intended figuratively. Not that
I chose the figure: it forced itself on me.—But the figurative
employment of the word can’t get into conflict with the original
one.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be explained why precisely this picture suggests
itself to me. (Just think of the expression, and the meaning of the
expression: “the word that hits it off”.) ,</p>
<p>But if a sentence can strike me as like a painting in words, and the
very individual word in the sentence as like a picture, then it is no
such marvel that a word uttered in isolation and without purpose can
seem to carry a particular meaning in itself.</p>
<p>Think here of a special kind of illusion which throws light on these
matters.—I go for a walk in the environs of a city with a friend. Is we
talk it comes out that I am imagining the city to lie on our right. Not
only have I no conscious reason for this assumption, but some quite
simple consideration was enough to make me realize that the city lay
rather to the left ahead of us. I can at first give no answer to the
question why I imagine the city in this direction. I had no reason to
think it. But though I see no reason still I seem to see certain
psychological causes for it. In particular, certain associations and
memories. For example, we walked along a canal, and once before in
similar circumstances I had followed a canal and that time the city lay
on our right.—I might try as it were psychoanalytically to discover the
causes of my unfounded conviction.</p>
<p>“But what is this queer experience?”—Of course it is not queerer than
any other; it simply differs in kind from those experiences which we
regard as the most fundamental ones, our sense impressions for
instance.</p>
<p>“I feel as if I knew the city lay over there.”—“I feel as if the name
‘Schubert’ fitted Schubert’s works and Schubert’s face.”</p>
<p>You can say the word “March” to yourself and mean it at one time as
an imperative at another as the name of a month. And now say “March
1”—and then “March no furtber “—Does the same experience accompany the
word both times—are you sure?</p>
<p>Of a sensitive ear shews me, when I am playing this game, that I have
now this now that experience of the word—doesn’t it also shew me that I
often do not have any experience of it in the course of talk ing?—For
the fact that I then also mean it, intend it, now like this now like
that , and maybe also say so later is, of course, not in question.</p>
<p>But the question now remains why, in connexion with this game of
experiencing a word, we also speak of ‘the meaning’ and of ‘m eanin g
it’.—This is a different kind of question.-It is the phenomenon which is
characteristic of this language-game that in this situation we use this
expression: we say we pronounced the word with this meaning and take
this expression over from that other language-game.</p>
<p>All it a dream. It does not change anything.</p>
<p>Given the two ideas ‘fat’ and ‘lean’, would you be rather inclined to
say that Wednesday was fat and Tuesday lean, or vice versa ? (I incline
decisively towards the former.) How have “fat” and “lean” some different
meaning here from their usual one?—They have a different use.—So ought I
really to have used different words? Certainly not that.—I want to use
these words (with their familiar meanings) here. —Now, I say nothing
about the causes of this phenomenon. They might be associations from my
childhood. But that is a hypothesis. Whatever the explanation,—the
inclination is there.</p>
<p>Asked “What do you really mean here by ‘fat’ and ‘lean’?”_I</p>
<p>could only explain the meanings in the usual way. I could not point
to the examples of Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Here one might speak of a ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ sense of a word.
It is only if the word has the primary sense for you that you use it in
the secondary one.</p>
<p>Only if you have learnt to calculate—on paper or out loud—can you be
made to grasp, by means of this concept, what calculating in the head
is.</p>
<p>The secondary sense is not a ‘metaphorical’ sense. Of I say “For me
the vowel e is yellow” I do not mean: ‘yellow’ in a metaphorical
sense,—for I could not express what I want to say in any other way than
by means of the idea ‘yellow’.</p>
<p>Someone tells me: “Wait for me by the bank”. Question: Did you, as
you were saying the word, mean this bank?—This question is of the same
kind as “Did you intend to say such-and-such to him on your way to meet
him?” It refers to a definite time (the time of walking, as the former
question refers to the time of speaking)—but not to an experience during
that time. Meaning is as little an experience as intending.</p>
<p>But what distinguishes them from experience?—They have no
experience-content. For the contents (images for instance) which
accompany and illustrate them are not the meaning or intending.</p>
<p>The intention with which one acts does not ’accompany” the action any
more than the thought ’accompanies” speech. Thought and inten tion are
neither ’articulated” nor ’non-articulated”; to be compared neither with
a single note which sounds during the acting or speaking, nor with a
tune.</p>
<p>’Talking” (whether out loud or silently) and ’thinking” are not
concepts of the same kind; even though they are in closest
connexion.</p>
<p>The interest of the experiences one has while speaking and of the
intention is not the same. (The experiences might perhaps inform a
psychologist about the ’ unconscious ” intention.)</p>
<p>“At that word we both thought of him.”” Let us assume that each of us
said the same words to himself—and how can it mean MORE than that?—But
wouldn’t even those words be only a germ} They must surely belong to a
language and to a context, in order really to be the expression of the
thought of that man.</p>
<p>Of Rod had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see
there whom we were speaking of.</p>
<p>“Why did you look at me at that word, were you thinking of… .?”” —So
there is a reaction at a certain moment and it is explained by saying “I
thought of….”” or “I suddenly remembered</p>
<p>In saying this you refer to that moment in the time you were
speaking. It makes a difference whether you refer to this or to that
moment.</p>
<p>Here explanation of a word does not refer to an occurrence at the
moment of speaking.</p>
<p>The language-game “I mean (or meant) this 97 (subsequent explana tion
of a word) is quite different from this one:”I thought of…. as I said
it.”” The latter is akin to “It reminded me of….””</p>
<p>“I have already remembered three times today that I must write to
him.”” Of what importance is it what went on in me then?—On the other
hand what is the importance, what the interest, of the statement
itself?—It permits certain conclusions.</p>
<p>“At these words he occurred to me.”—What is the primitive reaction
with which the language-game begins—which can then be translated I into
these words? How do people get to use these words?</p>
<p>The primitive reaction may have been a glance or a gesture, but it
may also have been a word.</p>
<p>“Why did you look at me and shake your head?”—“I wanted to give you
to understand that you.” This is supposed to express not 2</p>
<p>symbolic convention but the purpose of my action.</p>
<p>Meaning it is not a process which accompanies a word. For no process
could have the consequences of meaning.</p>
<p>(Similarly, I think, it could be said: a calculation is not an experi
ment, for no experiment could have the peculiar consequences of a
multiplication.)</p>
<p>There are important accompanying phenomena of talking which are often
missing when one talks without thinking, and this is characteristic of
talking without thinking. But they are not the thinking.</p>
<p>“Now I know 1” That went on here?-So did I not know, when</p>
<p>I declared that now I knew?</p>
<p>You are looking at it wrong.</p>
<p>(What is the signal for?)</p>
<p>And could the ‘knowing’ be called an accompaniment of the
exclamation?</p>
<p>The familiar physiognomy of a word, the feeling that it has taken up
its meaning into itself, that it is an actual likeness of its
meaning—there could be human beings to whom all this was alien. (They
would not have an attachment to their words.)—And how are these feelings
manifested among us?—By the way we choose and value words.</p>
<p>How do I find the ‘right’ word? How do I choose among words? Without
doubt it is sometimes as if I were comparing them by fine differences of
smell: That is too., that is too., —this is the right one.—But I do not
always have to make judgments, give explanations; often I might only
say: “It simply isn’t right yet”. I am dissatisfied, I go on looking. It
last a word comes: “Thafs it!” Sometimes I can say why. This is simply
what searching, this is what finding, is like here.</p>
<p>But doesn’t the word that occurs to you somehow ‘come’ in a special
way? Must attend and you’ll see!—Careful attention is no use to me. All
it could discover would be what is now going on in me.</p>
<p>And how can I, precisely now, listen for it at all? I ought to have
to wait until a word occurs to me anew. This, however, is the queer
thing: it seems as though I did not have to wait on the occasion, but
could give myself an exhibition of it, even when it is not actually
taking place. How?—I act it.—But what can I learn in this way? That do I
reproduce?—Characteristic accompaniments. Primarily: gestures, faces,
tones of voice.</p>
<p>It is possible—and this is important—to say a great deal about a line
aesthetic difference.—The first thing you say may, of course, be just:
“This word fits, that doesn’t”—or something of the kind. But then you
can discuss all the extensive ramifications of the tie-up effected by
each of the words. That first judgment is not the end of the matter, for
it is the field of force of a word that is decisive.</p>
<p>“The word is on the tip of my tongue.” That is going on in my
consciousness? That is not the point at all. Whatever did go on was not
what was meant by that expression. It is of more interest what went on
in my behaviour.—“The word is on the tip of my tongue” tells you: the
word which belongs here has escaped me, but I hope to find it soon. For
the rest the verbal expression does no more than certain wordless
behaviour.</p>
<p>James, in writing of this subject, is really trying to say: “What a
remarkable experience! The word is not there yet, and yet in a certain
sense is there,—or something is there, which cannot grow into anything
but this word.”—But this is not experience at all. Interpreted as
experience it does indeed look odd. Is does intention, when it is
interpreted as the accompaniment of action; or again, like minus one
interpreted as a cardinal number.</p>
<p>The words “It’s on the tip of my tongue” are no more the expression
of an experience than “Now I know how to go on!”—We use them in certain
situations &gt; and they are surrounded by behaviour of a special kind,
and also by some characteristic experiences. In particular they are
frequently followed by finding the word. (Ask yourself: “What would it
be like if human beings never found the word that was on the tip of
their tongue?”)</p>
<p>Silent ‘internal’ speech is not a half hidden phenomenon which is as
it were seen through a veil. It is not hidden at all, but the concept
may easily confuse us, for it runs over a long stretch cheek by jowl
with the concept of an ‘outward’ process, and yet does not coincide with
it.</p>
<p>(The question whether the muscles of the larynx are innervated in
connexion with internal speech, and similar things, may be of great
interest, but not in our investigation.)</p>
<p>The close relationship between ‘saying inwardly’ and ‘saying’ is
manifested in the possibility of telling out loud what one said
inwardly, and of an outward action’s accompanying inward speech. (I can
sing inwardly, or read silently, or calculate in my head, and beat time
with my hand as I do so.)</p>
<p>“But saying things inwardly is surely a certain activity which I have
to learn I” Very well; but what is ‘doing’ and what is ‘learning’
here?</p>
<p>Let the use of words teach you their meaning. (Similarly one can
often say in mathematics: let the proof teach you what was being
proved.)</p>
<p>“So I don’t really calculate, when I calculate in my head?”—After
all, you yourself distinguish between calculation in the head and
perceptible calculation! But you can only learn what ‘calculating in the
head’ is by learning what ‘calculating’ is; you can only learn to
calculate in your head by learning to calculate.</p>
<p>One can say things in one’s head very ‘distinctly’, when one repro
duces the tone of voice of one’s sentences by humming (with closed
lips). Movements of the larynx help too. But the remarkable thing is
precisely that one then hears the talk in one’s imagination and does not
merely feel the skeleton of it, so to speak, in one’s larynx. (For human
beings could also well be imagined calculating silently with movements
of the larynx, as one can calculate on one’s fingers.)</p>
<p>A hypothesis, such as that such-and-such went on in our bodies when
we made internal calculations, is only of interest to us in that it
points to a possible use of the expression “I said …. to myself”; namely
that of inferring the physiological process from the expression.</p>
<p>That what someone else says to himself is hidden from me is part of
the concept ‘saying inwardly’. Only “hidden” is the wrong word | here;
for if it is hidden from me, it ought to be apparent to him, he would
have to know it. But he does not ’know* it; only, the doubt which exists
for me does not exist for him.</p>
<p>“What anyone says to himself within himself is hidden from me” might
of course also mean that I can for the most part not guess it, nor can I
read it off from, for example, the movements of his throat (which would
be a possibility.)</p>
<p>“I know what I want, wish, believe, feel,.” (and so on through all
the psychological verbs) is either philosophers’ nonsense, or at any
rate not a judgment a priori .</p>
<p>“I know.. may mean”I do not doubt…” but does not mean that the words
“I doubt…” are senseless , that doubt is logically excluded.</p>
<p>One says “I know” where one can also say “I believe” or “I suspect”;
where one can find out. (If you bring up against me the case of people’s
saying “But I must know if I am in pain!”, “Only you can know what you
feel”, and similar things, you should consider the occasion and purpose
of these phrases. “War is war” is not an example of the law of identity,
either.)</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine a case in which I could find out that I had
two hands. Normally, however, I cannot do so. “But all you need is to
hold them up before your eyes I”—If I am now in doubt whether I have two
hands, I need not believe my eyes either. (I might just as well ask a
friend.)</p>
<p>With this is connected the fact that, for instance, the proposition
“The Earth has existed for millions of years” makes clearer sense than
“The Earth has existed in the last five minutes”. For I should ask
anyone who asserted the latter: “What observations does this pro
position refer to; and what observations would count against it?”—
whereas I know what ideas and observations the former proposition goes
with.</p>
<p>“A new-born child has no teeth.”—“A goose has no teeth.”—“A rose has
no teeth.”—This last at any rate—one would like to say—is obviously
true! It is even surer than that a goose has none.—And yet it is none so
clear. For where should a rose’s teeth have been? The goose has none in
its jaw. And neither, of course, has it any in its wings; but no one
means that when he says it has no teeth.—Why, suppose one were to say:
the cow chews its food and then dungs the rose with it, so the rose has
teeth in the mouth of a beast. This would not be absurd, because one has
no notion in advance where to look for teeth in a rose. ((Connexion with
‘pain in someone else’s body’.))</p>
<p>I can know what someone else is thinking, not what I am thinking.</p>
<p>It is correct to say “I know what you are thinking”, and wrong to say
“I know what I am thinking.”</p>
<p>(A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of grammar.)</p>
<p>“A man’s thinking goes on within his consciousness in a seclusion’ in
comparison with which any physical seclusion is an exhibition to public
view.”</p>
<p>Of there were people who always read the silent internal discourse of
others—say by observing the larynx—would they too be inclined to use the
picture of complete seclusion?</p>
<p>Of I were to talk to myself out loud in a language not understood by
those present my thoughts would be hidden from them.</p>
<p>Let us assume there was a man who always guessed right what I was
saying to myself in my thoughts. (It does not matter how he manages it.)
But what is the criterion for his guessing right? Well, I am a truthful
person and I confess that he has guessed right.—But might I not be
mistaken, can my memory not deceive me? And might it not always do so
when—without lying—I express what I have thought within myself?-But now
it does appear that ‘what went on within me’ is not the point at all.
(Here I am drawing a construction-line.)</p>
<p>The criteria for the truth of the confession that I thought
such-and-such are not the criteria for a true description of a process.
And the import ance of the true confession does not reside in its being
a correct and retrain report of a process. It resides rather in the
special consequences which can be drawn from a confession whose truth is
guaranteed by the special criteria of truthfulness.</p>
<p>(Assuming that dreams can yield important information about the
dreamer, what yielded the information would be truthful accounts of
dreams. The question whether the dreamer’s memory deceives him when he
reports the dream after waking cannot arise, unless indeed we introduce
a completely new criterion for the report’s ‘agreeing’</p>
<p>with the dream, a criterion which gives us a concept of ’truth* as
distinct from ’truthfulness* here.)</p>
<p>There is a game of ’guessing thoughts*. A variant of it would be
this: I tell A something in a language that A does not understand. A is
supposed to guess the meaning of what I say.—Another variant: I write
down a sentence which the other person cannot see. We has to guess the
words or their sense.—Yet another: I am putting a jig-saw puzzle
together; the other person cannot see me but from time to time guesses
my thoughts and utters them. We says, for instance, “Now where is this
bit ?—”Now I know how it fits !—”I have no idea what goes in
here,**—“The sky is always the hardest part’* and so on—but I need not
be talking to myself either out loud or silently at the time.</p>
<p>All this would be guessing at thoughts; and the fact that it does not
actually happen does not make thought any more hidden than the
unperceived physical proceedings.</p>
<p>“What is internal is hidden from us.**—The future is hidden from us.
But does the astronomer think like this when he calculates an eclipse of
the sun?</p>
<p>Of I see someone writhing in pain with evident cause I do not think:
all the same, his feelings are hidden from me.</p>
<p>We also say of some people that they are transparent to us. It is,
however, important as regards this observation that one human being can
be a complete enigma to another. We learn this when we come into a
strange country with entirely strange traditions; and, what is more,
even given a mastery of the country’s language. We do not understand the
people. (And not because of not knowing what they are saying to
themselves.) We cannot find our feet with them.</p>
<p>“I cannot know what is going on in him” is above all a picture . It
is the convincing expression of a conviction. It does not give the
reasons for the conviction. They are not readily accessible.</p>
<p>Of a lion could talk, we could not understand him.</p>
<p>It is possible to imagine a guessing of intentions like the guessing
of thoughts, but also a guessing of what someone is actually going to
do.</p>
<p>To say “He alone can know what he intends” is nonsense: to say “He
alone can know what he will do”, wrong. For the prediction contained in
my expression of intention (for example “When it strikes five I am going
home”) need not come true, and someone else may know what will really
happen.</p>
<p>Two points, however, are important: one, that in many cases some one
else cannot predict my actions, whereas I foresee them in my intentions;
the other, that my prediction (in my expression of inten tion) has not
the same foundation as his prediction of what I shall do, and the
conclusions to be drawn from these predictions are quite different.</p>
<p>I can be as certain of someone else’s sensations as of any fact. But
this does not make the propositions “He is much depressed”, “25 A 25 =
625” and “I am sixty years old” into similar instruments. The
explanation suggests itself that the certainty is of a different kind .—
This seems to point to a psychological, difference. But the difference
is logical.</p>
<p>“But, if you are certain , isn’t it that you are shutting your eyes
in face of doubt?”—They are shut.</p>
<p>Am I less certain that this man is in pain than that twice two is
four?—Does this shew the former to be mathematical certainty?-</p>
<p>‘Mathematical certainty’ is not a psychological concept.</p>
<p>The kind of certainty is the kind of language-game.</p>
<p>“He alone knows his motives”—that is an expression of the fact that
we ask him what his motives are.—If he is sincere he will tell us them;
but I need more than sincerity to guess his motives. This is where there
is a kinship with the case of knowing.</p>
<p>Let yourself be struck by the existence of such a thing as our lan
guage-game of: confessing the motive of my action.</p>
<p>We remain unconscious of the prodigious diversity of all the every
day language-games because the clothing of our language makes everything
alike.</p>
<p>Something new (spontaneous, ‘specific’) is always a
language-game.</p>
<p>That is the difference between cause and motive?—How is die motive
discovered , and how the cause?</p>
<p>There is such a question as: “Is this a reliable way of judging
people’s motives?” But in order to be able to ask this we must know what
“judging a motive” means; and we do not learn this by being told what ’
motive ’ is and what judging is.</p>
<p>One judges the length of a rod and can look for and find some method
of judging it more exactly or more reliably. So—you say— what is judged
here is independent of the method of judging it. That length is cannot
be defined by the method of determining length.— To think like this is
to make a mistake. That mistake?—To say “The height of Mont Blanc
depends on how one climbs it” would be queer. And one wants to compare
‘ever more accurate measurement of length’ with the nearer and nearer
approach to an object. But in certain cases it is, and in certain cases
it is not, clear what “approaching nearer to the length of an object”
means. That “determining the length” means is not learned by learning
what length and determining are; the meaning of the word “length” is
learnt by learning, among other things, what it is to determine
length.</p>
<p>(For this reason the word “methodology” has a double meaning. Not
only a physical investigation, but also a conceptual one, can be called
“methodological investigation”.)</p>
<p>We should sometimes like to call certainty and belief tones, colour
ings, of thought; and it is true that they receive expression in the
tone of voice. But do not think of them as ‘feelings’ which we have in
speaking or thinking.</p>
<p>Ask, not: “What goes on in us when we are certain that….?”— but: How
is ‘the certainty that this is the case’ manifested in human action?</p>
<p>“While you can have complete certainty about someone else’s state of
mind, still it is always merely subjective, not objective, certainty.”—
These two words betoken a difference between language-games.</p>
<p>There can be a dispute over the correct result of a calculation (say
of a rather long addition). But such disputes are rare and of short
duration. They can be decided, as we say, ‘with certainty’.</p>
<p>Mathematicians do not in general quarrel over the result of a
calculation. (This is an important fact.)—If it were otherwise, if for
instance one mathematician was convinced that a figure had altered
unperceived, or that his or someone else’s memory had been deceived, and
so on—then our concept of ‘mathematical certainty’ would not exist.</p>
<p>Even then it might always be said: “True we can never know what the
result of a calculation is, but for all that it always has a quite
definite result. (God knows it.) Mathematics is indeed of the highest
certainty—though we only have a crude reflection of it.”</p>
<p>But am I trying to say some such thing as that the certainty of mathe
matics is based on the reliability of ink and paper? No. (That would be
a vicious circle.)—I have not said why mathematicians do not quarrel,
but only that they do not.</p>
<p>It is no doubt true that you could not calculate with certain sorts
of paper and ink, if, that is, they were subject to certain queer
changes— but still the fact that they changed could in turn only be got
from memory and comparison with other means of calculation. And how are
these tested in their turn?</p>
<p>That has to be accepted, the given, is—so one could say —forms of
life.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to say that people generally agree in their ju d g
m e n ts of colour? That would it be like for them not to?—One man would
say a flower was red which another called blue, and so on.— But what
right should we have to call these people’s words “red” and “blue” our
‘colour-words’?“—</p>
<p>How would they learn to use these words? And is the language- game
which they learn still such as we call the use of ‘names of colour’?
There are evidendy differences of degree here.</p>
<p>This consideration must, however, apply to mathematics too. Of there
were not complete agreement, then neither would human beings be learning
the technique which we learn. It would be more or less different from
ours up to the point of unrecognizability.</p>
<p>“But mathematical truth is independent of whether human beings know
it or notl”—Certainly, the propositions “Human beings believe that twice
two is four” and “Twice two is four” do not mean the same. The latter is
a mathematical proposition; the other, if it makes sense at all, may
perhaps mean: human beings have arrived at the mat-Vif»matiral
proposition. The two propositions have entirely different uses .—But
what would this mean: “Even though everybody believed that twice two was
five it would still be four”?—For what would it be like for everybody to
believe that?—Well, I could imagine, for instance, that people had a
different calculus, or a technique which we should</p>
<p>zzje not call “calculating”. But would it be wrong* (Is a coronation
wrong ? To beings different from ourselves it might look extremely
odd.)</p>
<p>Of course, in one sense mathematics is a branch of knowledge,— but
still it is also an activity. And ’false moves* can only exist as the
exception. For if what we now call by that name became the rule, the
game in which they were false moves would have been abrogated.</p>
<p>“We all learn the same multiplication table.” This might, no doubt,
be a remark about the teaching of arithmetic in our schools,—but also an
observation about the concept of the multiplication table. (“In a
horse-race the horses generally run as fast as they can.”)</p>
<p>There is such a thing as colour-blindness and there are ways of
establishing it. There is in general complete agreement in the judg
ments of colours made by those who have been diagnosed normal. This
characterizes the concept of a judgment of colour.</p>
<p>There is in general no such agreement over the question whether an
expression of feeling is genuine or not.</p>
<p>I am sure, sure, that he is not pretending; but some third person is
not. Can I always convince him? And if not is there some mistake in his
reasoning or observations?</p>
<p>“You’re all at sea!”—we say this when someone doubts what we
recognize as clearly genuine—but we cannot prove anything.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as ’expert judgment* about the genuineness of
expressions of feeling?—Even here, there are those whose judgment is
’better* and those whose judgment is ’worse*.</p>
<p>Correcter prognoses will generally issue from the judgments of those
with better knowledge of mankind.</p>
<p>Can one learn this knowledge? Yes; some can. Not, however, by taking
a course in it, but through ’ experience .—Can someone else be a man’s
teacher in this? Certainly. From time to time he gives him the right tip
.—This is what ’learning and ’teaching* are like here.— That one
acquires here is not a technique; one learns correct judgments. There
are also rules, but they do not form a system, and only ex perienced
people can apply them right. Unlike calculating-rules.</p>
<p>That is most difficult here is to put this indefiniteness, correctly
and unfalsified, into words.</p>
<p>“The genuineness of an expression cannot be proved; one has to feel
it.”—Very well,—but what does one go on to do with this recognition of
genuineness? Of someone says “Voila ce que peut dire un cceur vraiment
6pris”—and if he also brings someone else to the same mind,—what are the
further consequences? Or are there none, and does the game end with one
person’s relishing what another does not?</p>
<p>There are certainly consequences , but of a diffuse kind. Experience,
that is varied observation, can inform us of them, and they too are
incapable of general formulation; only in scattered cases can one arrive
at a correct and fruitful judgment, establish a fruitful connexion. And
the most general remarks yield at best what looks like the frag ments of
a system.</p>
<p>It is certainly possible to be convinced by evidence that someone is
in such-and-such a state of mind, that, for instance, he is not pre
tending. But ‘evidence’ here includes ‘imponderable’ evidence.</p>
<p>The question is: what does imponderable evidence accomplish ?</p>
<p>Suppose there were imponderable evidence for the chemical (internal)
structure of a substance, still it would have to prove itself to be
evidence by certain consequences which can be weighed.</p>
<p>(Imponderable evidence might convince someone that a picture was a
genuine …. But it is possible for this to be proved right by docu
mentary evidence as well.)</p>
<p>Imponderable evidence includes subtleties of glance, of gesture, of
tone.</p>
<p>I may recognize a genuine loving look, distinguish it from a
pretended one (and here there can, of course, be a ‘ponderable’
confirmation of my judgment). But I may be quite incapable of describing
the difference. And this not because the languages I know have no words
for it. For why not introduce new words?—If I were a very talented
painter I might conceivably represent the genuine and the simulated
glance in pictures.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: How does a man learn to get a ‘nose’ for something? And
how can this nose be used?</p>
<p>Pretending is, of course, only a special case of someone’s producing
(say) expressions of pain when he is not in pain. For if this is
possible at all, why should it always be pretending that is taking
place—this very special pattern in the weave of our lives?</p>
<p>A child has much to learn before it can pretend. (A dog cannot be a
hypocrite, but neither can he be sincere.)</p>
<p>There might actually occur a case where we should say “This man
believes he is pretending.”</p>
<p>xii</p>
<p>If the formation of concepts can be explained by facts of nature,
should we not be interested, not in grammar, but rather in that in
nature which is the basis of grammar?—Our interest certainly includes
the correspondence between concepts and very general facts of nature.
(Such facts as mostly do not strike us because of their generality.) But
our interest does not fall back upon these possible causes of die
formation of concepts; we are not doing natural science; nor yet natural
history—since we can also invent fictitious natural history for our
purposes.</p>
<p>I am not saying: if such-and-such facts of nature were different
people would have different concepts (in the sense of a hypothesis).
But: if anyone believes that certain concepts are absolutely the correct
ones, and that having different ones would mean not realizing some thing
that we realize—then let him imagine certain very general facts of
nature to be different from what we are used to, and the formation of
concepts different from the usual ones will become intelligible to
him.</p>
<p>Compare a concept with a style of painting. For is even our style of
painting arbitrary? Can we choose one at pleasure? (The Egyptian, for
instance.) Is it a mere question of pleasing and ugly?</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>When I say: “He was here half an hour ago”—that is, remembering
it—this is not the description of a present experience.</p>
<p>Memory-experiences are accompaniments of remembering.</p>
<p>Remembering has no experiential content.—Surely this can be seen by
introspection? Doesn’t it shew precisely that there is nothing there,
when I look about for a content?—But it could only shew this in this
case or that. And even so it cannot shew me what the word “to remember”
means, and hence where to look for a content.</p>
<p>I get the idea of a memory-content only because I assimilate
psychological concepts. It is like assimilating two games. (Football has
goals, tennis not.)</p>
<p>Would this situation be conceivable: someone remembers for the first
time in his life and says “Yes, now I know what ‘remembering’ is, what
it feels like to remember”.—How does he know that this feeling is
‘remembering’? Compare: “Yes, now I know what ‘tingling’ is”. (He has
perhaps had an electric shock for the first time.)—Does he know that it
is memory because it is caused by something past? And how does he know
what the past is? Can learns the concept of the past by remembering.</p>
<p>And how will he know again in the future what remembering feels
like?</p>
<p>(On the other hand one might, perhaps, speak of a feeling “Long, long
ago”, for there is a tone, a gesture, which go with certain narratives
of past times.)</p>
<p>xiv</p>
<p>The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by
calling it a “young science”; its state is not comparable with that of
physics, for instance, in its beginnings. (Rather with that of certain
branches of mathematics. Set theory.) For in psychology there are
experimental methods and conceptual confusion . (As in the other case
conceptual confusion and methods of proof.)</p>
<p>The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the
means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and
method pass one another by.</p>
<p>In investigation is possible in connexion with mathematics which is
entirely analogous to our investigation of psychology. It is just as
little a mathematical investigation as the other is a psychological one.
It will not contain calculations, so it is not for example logistic. It
might deserve the name of an investigation of the ‘foundations of
mathematics’.</p>
