<h4 id="preface">PREFACE</h4>
<p>The thoughts which I publish in what follows are the precipitate of
philosophical investigations which have occupied me for the last sixteen
years. They concern many subjects: the concepts of meaning, of
understanding, of a proposition, of logic, the foundations of
mathematics, states of consciousness, and other things. I have written
down all these thoughts as remarks , short paragraphs, of which there is
sometimes a fairly long chain about the same subject, while I some times
make a sudden change, jumping from one topic to another.—It was my
intention at first to bring all this together in a book whose form I
pictured differently at different times. But the essential thing was
that the thoughts should proceed from one subject to another in a
natural order and without breaks.</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into
such a whole, I realized that I should never succeed. The best that I
could write would never be more than philosophical remarks; my thoughts
were soon crippled if I tried to force them on in any single direction
against their natural inclination.-And this was, of course, connected
with the very nature of the investigation. For this compels us to travel
over a wide field of thought criss-cross in every direction.— The
philosophical remarks in this book are, as it were, a number of sketches
of landscapes which were made in the course of these long and involved
journeyings.</p>
<p>The same or almost the same points were always being approached
afresh from different directions, and new sketches made. Very many of
these were badly drawn or uncharacteristic, marked by all the defects of
a weak draughtsman. And when they were rejected a number of tolerable
ones were left, which now had to be arranged and sometimes cut down, so
that if you looked at them you could get a picture of the landscape.
Thus this book is really only an album.</p>
<p>Up to a short time ago I had really given up the idea of publishing
my work in my lifetime. It used, indeed, to be revived from time to
time: mainly because I was obliged to learn that my results (which I had
communicated in lectures, typescripts and discussions), variously
misunderstood, more or less mangled or watered down, were in
circulation. This stung my vanity and I had difficulty in quieting
it.</p>
<p>Four* years ago I had occasion to re-read my first book (the
Tractates Logico-Pbilosophicus ) and to explain its ideas to someone. It
suddenly seemed to me that I should publish those old thoughts and the
new ones together: that the latter could be seen in the right light only
by contrast with and against the background of my old way of thinking.
1</p>
<p>For since beginning to occupy myself with philosophy again, sixteen
years ago, I have been forced to recognize grave mistakes in what I
wrote in that first book. I was helped to realize these mistakes—to a
degree which I myself am hardly able to estimate—by the criticism which
my ideas encountered from Frank Ramsey, with whom I discussed them in
innumerable conversations during the last two years of his life. Even
more than to this—always certain and forcible— criticism I am indebted
to that which a teacher of this university, Mr. P. Sraffa, for - many
years unceasingly practised on my thoughts.</p>
<p>I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas of
this book.</p>
<p>For more than one reason what I publish here will have points of
contact with what other people are writing to-day.—If my remarks do not
bear a stamp which marks them as mine,—I do not wish to lay any further
claim to them as my property.</p>
<p>I make them public with doubtful feelings. It is not impossible that
it should fall to the lot of this work, in its poverty and in the
darkness of this time, to bring light into one brain or another—but, of
course, it is not likely.</p>
<p>I should not like my writing to spare other people the trouble of
thinking . But, if possible, to stimulate someone to thoughts of his
own.</p>
<p>I should have liked to produce a good book. This has not come about,
but the time is past in which I could improve it.</p>
