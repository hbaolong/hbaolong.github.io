<h4 id="summary">1.4. Summary</h4>
<p>This first chapter has argued for a rethinking of popular statistical
and scientific phi- losophy. Instead of choosing among various black-box
tools for testing null hypotheses, we should learn to build and analyze
multiple non-null models of natural phenomena. To support this goal, the
chapter introduced Bayesian inference, model comparison, multilevel
models, and graphical causal models. The remainder of the book is
organized into four parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Chapters 2 and 3 are foundational. They introduce Bayesian
inference and the basic tools for performing Bayesian calculations. They
move quite slowly and emphasize a purely logical interpretation of
probability theory.</p></li>
<li><p>The next five chapters, 4 through 8, build multiple linear
regression as a Bayesian tool. This tool supports causal inference, but
only when we analyze separate causal models that help us determine which
variables to include. For this reason, you’ll learn basic causal
reasoning supported by causal graphs. These chapters emphasize plotting
results instead of attempting to interpret estimates of individual
parame- ters. Problems of model complexity—overfitting—also feature
prominently. So you’ll also get an introduction to information theory
and predictive model com- parison in 7.</p></li>
<li><p>The third part of the book, Chapters 9through 12, presents
generalized linear mod- els of several types. 9 introduces Markov chain
Monte Carlo, used to fit the models in later chapters. 10 introduces
maximum entropy as an explicit procedure to help us design and interpret
these models. Then Chapters 11 and 12 detail the models
themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The last part, Chapters 13 through 16, gets around to multilevel
models, as well as specialized models that address measurement error,
missing data, and spatial co- variation. This material is fairly
advanced, but it proceeds in the same mechanistic way as earlier
material. 16 departs from the rest ofthe book in deploying models which
are not of the generalized linear type but are rather scientific models
expressed directly as statistical models.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The final chapter, 17, returns to some of the issues raised in this
first one.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, there are practice problems ranging from
easy to hard. These problems help you test your comprehension. The
harder ones expand on the material, intro- ducing new examples and
obstacles. Some of the hard problems are quite hard. Don’t worry, if you
get stuck from time to time. Working in groups is a good way to get
unstuck, just like in real research.</p>
<p>2 Small Worlds and Large Worlds</p>
<p>When Cristoforo Colombo (Christopher Columbus) infamously sailed west
in the year 1492, he believed that the Earth was spherical. In this, he
was like most educated people of his day. He was unlike most people,
though, in that he also believed the planet was much smaller than it
actually is—only 30,000 km around its middle instead of the actual
40,000 km (Figure 2.1).37 This was one of the most consequential
mistakes in European history. If Colombo had believed instead that the
Earth was 40,000 km around, he would have correctly reasoned that his
fleet could not carry enough food and potable water to complete a
journey all the way westward to Asia. But at 30,000 km around, Asia
would lie a bit west of the coast of California. It was possible to
carry enough supplies to make it that far. Emboldened in part by his
unconventional estimate, Colombo set sail, eventually landing in the
Bahamas.</p>
<p>Colombo made a prediction based upon his view that the world was
small. But since he lived in a large world, aspects of the prediction
were wrong. In his case, the error was lucky. His small world model was
wrong in an unanticipated way: There was a lot of land in the way. If he
had been wrong in the expected way, with nothing but ocean between
Europe and Asia, he and his entire expedition would have run out of
supplies long before reaching the East Indies.</p>
<p>Colombo’s small and large worlds provide a contrast between model and
reality. All sta- tistical modeling has these two frames: the small
world of the model itself and the large world we hope to deploy the
model in.38 Navigating between these two worlds remains a central
challenge of statistical modeling. The challenge is greater when we
forget the distinction.</p>
<p>The small world is the self-contained logical world of the model.
Within the small world, all possibilities are nominated. There are no
pure surprises, like the existence of a huge continent between Europe
and Asia. Within the small world of the model, it is important to be
able to verify the model’s logic, making sure that it performs as
expected under favorable assumptions. Bayesian models have some
advantages in this regard, as they have reasonable claims to optimality:
No alternative model could make better use of the information in the
data and support better decisions, assuming the small world is an
accurate description of the real world.39</p>
<p>The large world is the broader context in which one deploys a model.
In the large world, there may be events that were not imagined in the
small world. Moreover, the model is always an incomplete representation
of the large world, and so will make mistakes, even if all kinds of
events have been properly nominated. The logical consistency of a model
in the small world is no guarantee that it will be optimal in the large
world. But it is certainly a warm comfort.</p>
<p>Figure 2.1. Illustration of Martin Behaim’s 1492 globe, showing the
small world that Colombo anticipated. Europe lies on the right- hand
side. Asia lies on the left. The big island labeled “Cipangu” is
Japan.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will begin to build Bayesian models. The way
that Bayesian models learn from evidence is arguably optimal in the
small world. When their assumptions approx- imate reality, they also
perform well in the large world. But large world performance has to be
demonstrated rather than logically deduced. Passing back and forth
between these two worlds allows both formal methods, like Bayesian
inference, and informal methods, like peer review, to play an
indispensable role.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the small world. It explains probability
theory in its essential form: counting the ways things can happen.
Bayesian inference arises automatically from this perspective. Then the
chapter presents the stylized components of a Bayesian statistical
model, a model for learning from data. Then it shows you how to animate
the model, to produce estimates.</p>
<p>All this work provides a foundation for the next chapter, in which
you’ll learn to sum- marize Bayesian estimates, as well as begin to
consider large world obligations.</p>
<p>Rethinking: Fast and frugal in the large world. The natural world is
complex, as trying to do science serves to remind us. Yet everything
from the humble tick to the industrious squirrel to the idle sloth
manages to frequently make adaptive decisions. But it’s a good bet that
most animals are not Bayesian, if only because being Bayesian is
expensive and depends upon having a good model. Instead, animals use
various heuristics that are fit to their environments, past or present.
These heuristics take adaptive shortcuts and so may outperform a
rigorous Bayesian analysis, once costs of information gathering and
processing (and overfitting, 7) are taken into account.40 Once you
already know which information to ignore or attend to, being fully
Bayesian is a waste. It’s neither necessary nor sufficient for making
good decisions, as real animals demonstrate. But for human animals,
Bayesian analysis provides a general way to discover relevant
information and process it logically. Just don’t think that it is the
only way.</p>
