<h4 id="preface-to-the-second-edition">Preface to the Second
Edition</h4>
<p>It came as a complete surprise to me that I wrote a statistics book.
It is even more sur- prising how popular the book has become. But I had
set out to write the statistics book that I wish I could have had in
graduate school. No one should have to learn this stuff the way I did. I
am glad there is an audience to benefit from the book.</p>
<p>It consumed five years to write it. There was an initial set of
course notes, melted down and hammered into a first 200-page manuscript.
I discarded that first manuscript. But it taught me the outline of the
book I really wanted to write. Then, several years of teaching with the
manuscript further refined it.</p>
<p>Really, I could have continued refining it every year. Going to press
carries the penalty of freezing a dynamic process of both learning how
to teach the material and keeping up with changes in the material. As
time goes on, I see more elements of the book that I wish I had done
differently. I’ve also received a lot of feedback on the book, and that
feedback has given me ideas for improving it.</p>
<p>So in the second edition, I put those ideas into action. The major
changes are:</p>
<p>The R package has some new tools. The map tool from the first edition
is still here, but now it is named quap. This renaming is to avoid
misunderstanding. We just used it to get a quadratic approximation to
the posterior. So now it is named as such. A bigger change is that
map2stan has been replaced by ulam. The new ulam is very similar to
map2stan, and in many cases can be used identically. But it is also much
more flexible, mainly because it does not make any assumptions about GLM
structure and allows explicit variable types. All the map2stan code is
still in the package and will continue to work. But now ulam allows for
much more, especially in later chapters. Both of these tools allow
sampling from the prior distribution, using extract.prior, as well as
the posterior. This helps with the next change.</p>
<p>Much more prior predictive simulation. A prior predictive simulation
means simulating predictions from a model, using only the prior
distribution instead of the posterior distri- bution. This is very
useful for understanding the implications of a prior. There was only a
vestigial amount of this in the first edition. Now many modeling
examples have some prior predictive simulation. I think this is one of
the most useful additions to the second edition, since it helps so much
with understanding not only priors but also the model itself.</p>
<p>More emphasis on the distinction between prediction and inference. 5,
the chap- ter on multiple regression, has been split into two chapters.
The first chapter focuses on helpful aspects of regression; the second
focuses on ways that it can mislead. This allows as well a more direct
discussion of causal inference. This means that DAGs—directed
acyclic</p>
<p>graphs—make an appearance. The chapter on overfitting, 7 now, is also
more di- rect in cautioning about the predictive nature of information
criteria and cross-validation.</p>
<p>Cross-validation and importance sampling approximations ofit are now
discussed explicitly. New model types. 4 now presents simple splines. 7
introduces one kind or robust regression. 12 explains how to use ordered
categorical predictor variables. 13 presents a very simple type of
social network model, the social relations model. 14 has an example of a
phylogenetic regression, with a somewhat critical and hetero- dox
presentation. And there is an entirely new chapter, 16, that focuses on
models that are not easily conceived of as GLMMs, including ordinary
differential equation models.</p>
<p>Some new data examples. There are some new data examples,
includingthe Japanese cherry blossoms time series on the cover and a
larger primate evolution data set with 300 species and a matching
phylogeny.</p>
<p>More presentation of raw Stan models. There are many more places now
where raw Stan model code is explained. I hope this makes a transition
to working directly in Stan easier. But most of the time, working
directly in Stan is still optional.</p>
<p>Kindness and persistence. As in the first edition, I have tried to
make the material as kind as possible. None of this stuff is easy, and
the journey into understanding is long and haunted. It is important that
readers expect that confusion is normal. This is also the reason that I
have not changed the basic modeling strategy in the book.</p>
<p>First, I force the reader to explicitly specify every assumption of
the model. Some readers of the first edition lobbied me to use
simplified formula tools like brms or rstanarm. Those are fantastic
packages, and graduating to use them after this book is recommended. But
I don’t see how a person can come to understand the model when using
those tools. The priors being hidden isn’t the most limiting part.
Instead, since linear model formulas like y ~ (1|x) + z don’t show the
parameters, nor even all of the terms, it is not easy to see how the
mathematical model relates to the code. It is ultimately kinder to be a
bit cruel and require more work. So the formula lists remain. You’ll
thank me later.</p>
<p>Second, half the book goes by before MCMC appears. Some readers of
the first edi- tion wanted me to start instead with MCMC. I do not do
this because Bayes is not about MCMC. We seek the posterior
distribution, but there are many legitimate approximations of it. MCMC
is just one set of strategies. Using quadratic approximation in the
first half also allows a clearer tie to non-Bayesian algorithms. And
since finding the quadratic approxima- tion is fast, it means readers
don’t have to struggle with too many things at once.</p>
<p>Thanks. Many readers and colleagues contributed comments that
improved upon the first edition. There are too many to name
individually. Several anonymous reviewers provided many pages of
constructive criticism. Bret Beheim and Aki Vehtari commented on multi-
ple chapters. My colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Anthropology in Leipzig made the largest contributions, by working
through draft chapters and being relent- lessly honest.</p>
