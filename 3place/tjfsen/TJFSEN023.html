<h4 id="practice">3.5. Practice</h4>
<p>Problems are labeled Easy (E), Medium (M), and Hard (H).</p>
<p>Easy. The Easy problems use the samples from the posterior
distribution for the globe tossing ex- ample. This code will give you a
specific set of samples, so that you can check your answers exactly.</p>
<p>Use the values in samples to answer the questions that follow.</p>
<p>3E1. How much posterior probability lies below p = 0.2?</p>
<p>3E2. How much posterior probability lies above p = 0.8?</p>
<p>3E3. How much posterior probability lies between p = 0.2 and p =
0.8?</p>
<p>3E4. 20% of the posterior probability lies below which value ofp?</p>
<p>3E5. 20% of the posterior probability lies above which value ofp?</p>
<p>3E6. Which values of p contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of
the posterior probability?</p>
<p>3E7. Which values of p contain 66% of the posterior probability,
assuming equal posterior probabil- ity both below and above the
interval?</p>
<p>3M1. Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in
15 tosses. Construct the poste- rior distribution, using grid
approximation. Use the same flat prior as before.</p>
<p>3M2. Draw 10,000 samples from the grid approximation from above. Then
use the samples to cal- culate the 90% HPDI for p.</p>
<p>3M3. Construct a posterior predictive check for this model and data.
This means simulate the distri- bution of samples, averaging over the
posterior uncertainty in p. What is the probability of observing 8 water
in 15 tosses?</p>
<p>3M4. Using the posterior distribution constructed from the new (8/15)
data, now calculate the prob- ability of observing 6 water in 9
tosses.</p>
<p>3M5. Start over at 3M1, but now use a prior that is zero below p =
0.5 and a constant above p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information
that a majority of the Earth’s surface is water. Repeat each problem
above and compare the inferences. What difference does the better prior
make? If it helps, compare inferences (using both priors) to the true
value p = 0.7.</p>
<p>3M6. Suppose you want to estimate the Earth’s proportion of water
very precisely. Specifically, you want the 99% percentile interval of
the posterior distribution of p to be only 0.05 wide. This means the
distance between the upper and lower bound of the interval should be
0.05. How many times will you have to toss the globe to do this?</p>
<p>Hard. The Hard problems here all use the data below. These data
indicate the gender (male=1, fe- male=0) of officially reported first
and second born children in 100 two-child families.</p>
<p>So for example, the first family in the data reported a boy (1) and
then a girl (0). The second family reported a girl (0) and then a boy
(1). The third family reported two girls. You can load these two vectors
into R’s memory by typing:</p>
<p>R code 3.29</p>
<p>library(rethinking)</p>
<p>data(homeworkch3)</p>
<p>Use these vectors as data. So for example to compute the total number
of boys born across all of these births, you could use:</p>
<p>R code 3.30</p>
<p>sum(birth1) + sum(birth2)</p>
<p>[1] 111</p>
<p>3H1. Using grid approximation, compute the posterior distribution for
the probability of a birth being a boy. Assume a uniform prior
probability. Which parameter value maximizes the posterior
probability?</p>
<p>3H2. Using the sample function, draw 10,000 random parameter values
from the posterior distri- bution you calculated above. Use these
samples to estimate the 50%, 89%, and 97% highest posterior density
intervals.</p>
<p>3H3. Use rbinom to simulate 10,000 replicates of 200 births. You
should end up with 10,000 num- bers, each one a count of boys out of 200
births. Compare the distribution of predicted numbers of boys to the
actual count in the data (111 boys out of 200 births). There are many
good ways to visualize the simulations, but the dens command (part of
the rethinking package) is probably the easiest way in this case. Does
it look like the model fits the data well? That is, does the
distribution of predictions include the actual observation as a central,
likely outcome?</p>
<p>3H4. Now compare 10,000 counts of boys from 100 simulated firstborns
only to the number of boys in the first births, birth1. How does the
model look in this light?</p>
<p>3H5. The model assumes that sex of first and second births are
independent. To check this assump- tion, focus now on second births that
followed female first borns. Compare 10,000 simulated counts of boys to
only those second births that followed girls. To do this correctly, you
need to count the number of first borns who were girls and simulate that
many births, 10,000 times. Compare the counts of boys in your
simulations to the actual observed count of boys following girls. How
does the model look in this light? Any guesses what is going on in these
data?</p>
<p>4 Geocentric Models</p>
<p>History has been unkind to Ptolemy. Claudius Ptolemy (born 90 CE,
died 168 CE) was an Egyptian mathematician and astronomer, famous for
his geocentric model of the solar system. These days, when scientists
wish to mock someone, they might compare him to a supporter of the
geocentric model. But Ptolemy was a genius. His mathematical model of
the motions of the planets (Figure 4.1) was extremely accurate. To
achieve its accuracy, it employed a device known as an epicycle, a
circle on a circle. It is even possible to have epi- epicycles, circles
on circles on circles. With enough epicycles in the right places,
Ptolemy’s model could predict planetary motion with great accuracy. And
so the model was utilized for over a thousand years. And Ptolemy and
people like him worked it all out without the aid of a computer. Anyone
should be flattered to be compared to Ptolemy.</p>
<p>The trouble of course is that the geocentric model is wrong, in many
respects. If you used it to plot the path of your Mars probe, you’d miss
the red planet by quite a distance. But for spotting Mars in the night
sky, it remains an excellent model. It would have to be re-calibrated
every century or so, depending upon which heavenly body you wish to
locate. But the geocentric model continues to make useful predictions,
provided those predictions remain within a narrow domain of
questioning.</p>
<p>The strategy of using epicycles might seem crazy, once you know the
correct structure of the solar system. But it turns out that the
ancients had hit upon a generalized system of approximation. Given
enough circles embedded in enough places, the Ptolemaic strategy is the
same as a Fourier series, a way of decomposing a periodic function (like
an orbit) into a series of sine and cosine functions. So no matter the
actual arrangement of planets and moons, a geocentric model can be built
to describe their paths against the night sky.</p>
<p>Linear regression is the geocentric model of applied statistics. By
“linear regression,” we will mean a family of simple statistical golems
that attempt to learn about the mean and variance of some measurement,
using an additive combination of other measurements. Like geocentrism,
linear regression can usefully describe a very large variety of natural
phenom- ena. Like geocentrism, linear regression is a descriptive model
that corresponds to many different process models. If we read its
structure too literally, we’re likely to make mistakes. But used wisely,
these little linear golems continue to be useful.</p>
<p>This chapter introduces linear regression as a Bayesian procedure.
Under a probability interpretation, which is necessary for Bayesian
work, linear regression uses a Gaussian (nor- mal) distribution to
describe our golem’s uncertainty about some measurement of interest.
This type of model is simple, flexible, and commonplace. Like all
statistical models, it is not universally useful. But linear regression
has a strong claim to being foundational, in the sense that once you
learn to build and interpret linear regression models, you can more
easily move on to other types of regression which are less normal.</p>

predictions.</p>
