<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>Many people have contributed advice, ideas, and complaints to this
book. Most impor- tant among them have been the graduate students who
have taken statistics courses from</p>
<p>me over the last decade, as well as the colleagues who have come to
me for advice. These people taught me how to teach them this material,
and in some cases I learned the material only because they needed it. A
large number of individuals donated their time to comment on sections of
the book or accompanying computer code. These include: Rasmus Bååth,
Ryan Baldini, Bret Beheim, Maciek Chudek, John Durand, Andrew Gelman,
Ben Goodrich, Mark Grote, Dave Harris, Chris Howerton, James Holland
Jones, Jeremy Koster, Andrew Marshall, Sarah Mathew, Karthik
Panchanathan, Pete Richerson, Alan Rogers, Cody Ross, Noam Ross, Aviva
Rossi, Kari Schroeder, Paul Smaldino, Rob Trangucci, Shravan Vasishth,
Annika Wallin, and a score of anonymous reviewers. Bret Beheim and Dave
Harris were brave enough to provide extensive comments on an early
draft. Caitlin DeRango and Kot- rina Kajokaite invested their time in
improving several chapters and problem sets. Mary Brooke McEachern
provided crucial opinions on content and presentation, as well as calm
support and tolerance. A number of anonymous reviewers provided detailed
feedback on individual chapters. None of these people agree with all
ofthe choices I have made, and all mistakes and deficiencies remain my
responsibility. But especially when we haven’t agreed, their opinions
have made the book stronger.</p>
<p>The book is dedicated to Dr. Parry M. R. Clarke (1977–2012), who
asked me to write it. Parry’s inquisition of statistical and
mathematical and computational methods helped everyone around him. He
made us better.</p>
<p>1 The Golem of Prague</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century, the House of Habsburg controlled much of
Central Europe, the Netherlands, and Spain, as well as Spain’s colonies
in the Americas. The House was maybe the first true world power. The Sun
shone always on some portion of it. Its ruler was also Holy Roman
Emperor, and his seat of power was Prague. The Emperor in the late
sixteenth century, Rudolph II, loved intellectual life. He invested in
the arts, the sciences (including astrology and alchemy), and
mathematics, making Prague into a world center of learning and
scholarship. It is appropriate then that in this learned atmosphere
arose an early robot, the Golem of Prague.</p>
<p>A golem (goh-lem) is a clay robot from Jewish folklore, constructed
from dust and fire and water. It is brought to life by inscribing emet,
Hebrew for “truth,” on its brow. Animated by truth, but lacking free
will, a golem always does exactly what it is told. This is lucky,
because the golem is incredibly powerful, able to withstand and
accomplish more than its creators could. However, its obedience also
brings danger, as careless instructions or unex- pected events can turn
a golem against its makers. Its abundance of power is matched by its
lack of wisdom.</p>
<p>In some versions of the golem legend, Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel
sought a way to defend the Jews of Prague. As in many parts of sixteenth
century Central Europe, the Jews of Prague were persecuted. Using secret
techniques from the Kabbalah, Rabbi Judah was able to build a golem,
animate it with “truth,” and order it to defend the Jewish people of
Prague. Not everyone agreed with Judah’s action, fearing unintended
consequences of toying with the power of life. Ultimately Judah was
forced to destroy the golem, as its combination of extraordinary power
with clumsiness eventually led to innocent deaths. Wiping away one
letter from the inscription emet to spell instead met, “death,” Rabbi
Judah decommissioned the robot.</p>
