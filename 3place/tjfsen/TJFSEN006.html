<h4 id="how-to-use-this-book">How to use this book</h4>
<p>This book is not a reference, but a course. It doesn’t try to support
random access. Rather, it expects sequential access. This has immense
pedagogical advantages, but it has the disadvantage of violating how
most scientists actually read books.</p>
<p>This book has a lot of code in it, integrated fully into the main
text. The reason for this is that doing model-based statistics in the
twenty-first century requires simple programming. The code is really not
optional. Everyplace, I have erred on the side of including too much
code, rather than too little. In my experience teaching scientific
programming, novices learn more quickly when they have working code to
modify, rather than needing to write an algo- rithm from scratch. My
generation was probably the last to have to learn some programming to
use a computer, and so coding has gotten harder and harder to teach as
time goes on. My students are very computer literate, but they sometimes
have no idea what computer code looks like.</p>
<p>What the book assumes. This book does not try to teach the reader to
program, in the most basic sense. It assumes that you have made a basic
effort to learn how to install and process data in R. In most cases, a
short introduction to R programming will be enough. I know many people
have found Emmanuel Paradis’ R for Beginners helpful. You can find it
and many other beginner guides here:</p>
<p>http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html</p>
<p>To make use of this book, you should know already that y&lt;-7 stores
the value 7 in the sym- bol y. You should know that symbols which end in
parentheses are functions. You should recognize a loop and understand
that commands can be embedded inside other commands (recursion). Knowing
that R vectorizes a lot of code, instead of using loops, is important.
But you don’t have to yet be confident with R programming.</p>
<p>Inevitably you will come across elements of the code in this book
that you haven’t seen before. I have made an effort to explain any
particularly important or unusual programming tricks in my own code. In
fact, this book spends a lot of time explaining code. I do this because
students really need it. Unless they can connect each command to the
recipe and the goal, when things go wrong, they won’t know whether it is
because of a minor or major error. The same issue arises when I teach
mathematical evolutionary theory—students and colleagues often suffer
from rusty algebra skills, so when they can’t get the right answer, they
often don’t know whether it’s because of some small mathematical misstep
or instead some problem in strategy. The protracted explanations of code
in this book aim to build a level of understanding that allows the
reader to diagnose and fix problems.</p>
<p>Why R. This book uses R for the same reason that it uses English:
Lots of people know it already. R is convenient for doing computational
statistics. But many other languages are equally fine. I recommend
Python (especially PyMC) and Julia as well. The first edition ended up
with code translations for various languages and styles. Hopefully, the
second edition will as well.</p>
<p>Using the code. Code examples in the book are marked by a shaded box,
and output from example code is often printed just beneath a shaded box,
but marked by a fixed-width type- face. For example:</p>
<p>[1] “All models are wrong, but some are useful.“</p>
<p>Next to each snippet of code, you’ll find a number that you can
search for in the accompa- nying code snippet file, available from the
book’s website. The intention is that the reader follow along, executing
the code in the shaded boxes and comparing their own output to that
printed in the book. I really want you to execute the code, because just
as one cannot learn martial arts by watching Bruce Lee movies, you can’t
learn to program statistical models by only reading a book. You have to
get in there and throw some punches and, likewise, take some hits.</p>
<p>If you ever get confused, remember that you can execute each line
independently and inspect the intermediate calculations. That’s how you
learn as well as solve problems. For example, here’s a confusing way to
multiply the numbers 10 and 20:</p>
<p>R code 0.2</p>
<p>R code 0.3</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>If you don’t understand any particular step, you can always print out
the contents ofthe sym- bol x immediately after that step. For the code
examples, this is how you come to understand them. For your own code,
this is how you find the source of any problems and then fix them.</p>
<p>Optional sections. Reflecting realism in how books like this are
actually read, there are two kinds of optional sections: (1) Rethinking
and (2) Overthinking. The Rethinking sections look like this:</p>
<p>The Overthinking sections look like this:</p>
<p>Overthinking: Getting your hands dirty. These sections, set in
smaller type, provide more detailed explanations of code or mathematics.
This material isn’t essential for understanding the main text. But it
does have a lot of value, especially on a second reading. For example,
sometimes it matters how you perform a calculation. Mathematics tells
that these two expressions are equivalent:</p>
<p>p1 = log(0.01200 )</p>
<p>p2 = 200 × log(0.01)</p>
<p>But when you use R to compute them, they yield different answers:</p>
<p>[1] -Inf</p>
<p>[1] -921.034</p>
<p>The second line is the right answer. This problem arises because of
rounding error, when the computer rounds very small decimal values to
zero. This loses precision and can introduce substantial errors in
inference. As a result, we nearly always do statistical calculations
using the logarithm of a probability, rather than the probability
itself.</p>
<p>You can ignore most of these Overthinking sections on a first
read.</p>
<p>The command line is the best tool. Programming at the level needed to
perform twenty- first century statistical inference is not that
complicated, but it is unfamiliar at first. Why not just teach the
reader how to do all of this with a point-and-click program? There are
big advantages to doing statistics with text commands, rather than
pointing and clicking on menus.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the command line is more powerful. But it also
saves you time and fulfills ethical obligations. With a command script,
each analysis documents itself, so that years from now you can come back
to your analysis and replicate it exactly. You can re-use your old files
and send them to colleagues. Pointing and clicking, however, leaves no
trail of breadcrumbs. A file with your R commands inside it does. Once
you get in the habit of planning, running, and preserving your
statistical analyses in this way, it pays for itself many times over.
With point-and-click, you pay down the road, rather than only up front.
It is also a basic ethical requirement of science that our analyses be
fully documented and repeatable. The integrity of peer review and the
cumulative progress of research depend upon it. A command line
statistical program makes this documentation natural. A point- and-click
interface does not. Be ethical.</p>
<p>So we don’t use the command line because we are hardcore or elitist
(although we might be). We use the command line because it is better. It
is harder at first. Unlike the point-and- click interface, you do have
to learn a basic set of commands to get started with a command line
interface. However, the ethical and cost saving advantages are worth the
inconvenience.</p>
<p>How you should work. But I would be cruel, if I just told the reader
to use a command-line tool, without also explaining something about how
to do it. You do have to relearn some habits, but it isn’t a major
change. For readers who have only used menu-driven statistics software
before, there will be some significant readjustment. But after a few
days, it will seem natural to you. For readers who have used
command-driven statistics software like Stata and SAS, there is still
some readjustment ahead. I’ll explain the overall approach first. Then
I’ll say why even Stata and SAS users are in for a change.</p>
<p>The sane approach to scripting statistical analyses is to work back
and forth between two applications: (1) a plain text editor of your
choice and (2) the R program running in a terminal. There are several
applications that integrate the text editor with the R console. The most
popular of these is RStudio. It has a lot of options, but really it is
just an interface that includes both a script editor and an R
terminal.</p>
<p>A plain text editor is a program that creates and edits simple
formatting-free text files. Common examples include Notepad (in Windows)
and TextEdit (in Mac OS X) and Emacs (in most *NIX distributions,
including Mac OS X). There is also a wide selection of fancy text
editors specialized for programmers. You might investigate, for example,
RStudio and the Atom text editor, both of which are free. Note that
MSWord files are not plain text.</p>
<p>You will use a plain text editor to keep a running log of the
commands you feed into the R application for processing. You absolutely
do not want to just type out commands directly into R itself. Instead,
you want to either copy and paste lines of code from your plain text
editor into R, or instead read entire script files directly into R. You
might enter commands directly into R as you explore data or debug or
merely play. But your serious work should be implemented through the
plain text editor, for the reasons explained in the previous
section.</p>
<p>You can add comments to your R scripts to help you plan the code and
remember later what the code is doing. To make a comment, just begin a
line with the # symbol. To help clar- ify the approach, below I provide
a very short complete script for running a linear regression on one
ofR’s built-in sets of data. Even if you don’t know what the code does
yet, hopefully you will see it as a basic model of clarity of formatting
and use of comments.</p>
<p>Even those who are familiar with scripting Stata or SAS will be in
for some readjust- ment. Programs like Stata and SAS have a different
paradigm for how information is pro- cessed. In those applications,
procedural commands like PROC GLM are issued in imitation of menu
commands. These procedures produce a mass of default output that the
user then sifts through. R does not behave this way. Instead, R forces
the user to decide which bits of information she wants. One fits a
statistical model in R and then must issue later commands to ask
questions about it. This more interrogative paradigm will become
familiar through the examples in the text. But be aware that you are
going to take a more active role in deciding what questions to ask about
your models.</p>
