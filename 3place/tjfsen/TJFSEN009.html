<h4 id="statistical-golems">1.1. Statistical golems</h4>
<p>Scientists also make golems.1 Our golems rarely have physical form,
but they too are often made of clay, living in silicon as computer code.
These golems are scientific models. But these golems have real effects
on the world, through the predictions they make and the intuitions they
challenge or inspire. A concern with “truth” enlivens these models, but
just like a golem or a modern robot, scientific models are neither true
nor false, neither prophets nor charlatans. Rather they are constructs
engineered for some purpose. These constructs are incredibly powerful,
dutifully conducting their programmed calculations.</p>
<p>lf significant, do post hoc test:</p>
<p>Bon ferro ni’s, Dunn’s, Tu key’s, etc.</p>
<p>Figure 1.1. Example decision tree, or flowchart, for selecting an
appropri- ate statistical procedure. Beginning at the top, the user
answers a series of questions about measurement and intent, arriving
eventually at the name of a procedure. Many such decision trees are
possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes their unyielding logic reveals implications previously
hidden to their design- ers. These implications can be priceless
discoveries. Or they may produce silly and dan- gerous behavior. Rather
than idealized angels of reason, scientific models are powerful clay
robots without intent of their own, bumbling along according to the
myopic instructions they embody. Like with Rabbi Judah’s golem, the
golems of science are wisely regarded with both awe and apprehension. We
absolutely have to use them, but doing so always entails some risk.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of statistical models. Whenever someone deploys
even a simple statistical procedure, like a classical t-test, she is
deploying a small golem that will obediently carry out an exact
calculation, performing it the same way (nearly2) every time, without
complaint. Nearly every branch of science relies upon the senses of
statistical golems. In many cases, it is no longer possible to even
measure phenomena of interest, without making use of a model. To measure
the strength of natural selection or the speed of a neutrino or the
number of species in the Amazon, we must use models. The golem is a
prosthesis, doing the measuring for us, performing impressive
calculations, finding patterns where none are obvious.</p>
<p>However, there is no wisdom in the golem. It doesn’t discern when the
context is inap- propriate for its answers. It just knows its own
procedure, nothing else. It just does as it’s told.</p>
<p>And so it remains a triumph of statistical science that there are now
so many diverse golems, each useful in a particular context. Viewed this
way, statistics is neither mathematics nor a science, but rather a
branch of engineering. And like engineering, a common set of design
principles and constraints produces a great diversity of specialized
applications.</p>
<p>This diversity of applications helps to explain why introductory
statistics courses are so often confusing to the initiates. Instead of a
single method for building, refining, and cri- tiquing statistical
models, students are offered a zoo of pre-constructed golems known as
“tests.” Each test has a particular purpose. Decision trees, like the
one in Figure 1.1, are common. By answering a series of sequential
questions, users choose the “correct” proce- dure for their research
circumstances.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while experienced statisticians grasp the unity of
these procedures, stu- dents and researchers rarely do. Advanced courses
in statistics do emphasize engineering principles, but most scientists
never get that far. Teaching statistics this way is somewhat like
teaching engineering backwards, starting with bridge building and ending
with basic physics. So students and many scientists tend to use charts
like Figure 1.1 without much thought to their underlying structure,
without much awareness of the models that each proce- dure embodies, and
without any framework to help them make the inevitable compromises
required by real research. It’s not their fault.</p>
<p>For some, the toolbox of pre-manufactured golems is all they will
ever need. Provided they stay within well-tested contexts, using only a
few different procedures in appropriate tasks, a lot of good science can
be completed. This is similar to how plumbers can do a lot of useful
work without knowing much about fluid dynamics. Serious trouble begins
when scholars move on to conducting innovative research, pushing the
boundaries of their spe- cialties. It’s as if we got our hydraulic
engineers by promoting plumbers.</p>
<p>Why aren’t the tests enough for research? The classical procedures of
introductory sta- tistics tend to be inflexible and fragile. By
inflexible, I mean that they have very limited ways to adapt to unique
research contexts. By fragile, I mean that they fail in unpredictable
ways when applied to new contexts. This matters, because at the
boundaries of most sciences, it is hardly ever clear which procedure is
appropriate. None of the traditional golems has been evaluated in novel
research settings, and so it can be hard to choose one and then to
understand how it behaves. A good example is Fisher’s exact test, which
applies (exactly) to an extremely narrow empirical context, but is
regularly used whenever cell counts are small. I have personally read
hundreds of uses of Fisher’s exact test in scientific journals, but
aside from Fisher’s original use of it, I have never seen it used
appropriately. Even a procedure like ordinary linear regression, which
is quite flexible in many ways, being able to encode a large diversity
of interesting hypotheses, is sometimes fragile. For example, if there
is substan- tial measurement error on prediction variables, then the
procedure can fail in spectacular ways. But more importantly, it is
nearly always possible to do better than ordinary linear regression,
largely because of a phenomenon known as overfitting (7).</p>
<p>The point isn’t that statistical tools are specialized. Of course
they are. The point is that classical tools are not diverse enough to
handle many common research questions. Every active area of science
contends with unique difficulties of measurement and interpretation,
converses with idiosyncratic theories in a dialect barely understood by
other scientists from other tribes. Statistical experts outside the
discipline can help, but they are limited by lack of fluency in the
empirical and theoretical concerns of the discipline.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no statistical tool does anything on its own to address
the basic problem of inferring causes from evidence. Statistical golems
do not understand cause and effect.</p>
<p>They only understand association. Without our guidance and
skepticism, pre-manufactured golems may do nothing useful at all. Worse,
they might wreck Prague.</p>
<p>What researchers need is some unified theory of golem engineering, a
set of principles for designing, building, and refining special-purpose
statistical procedures. Every major branch of statistical philosophy
possesses such a unified theory. But the theory is never taught in
introductory—and often not even in advanced—courses. So there are
benefits in rethinking statistical inference as a set of strategies,
instead of a set of pre-made tools.</p>
