<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>1 Codex Atl., 391r-a/1082r; Notebooks/J. P. Richter, 1340. The issue
of the date of this letter is addressed in chapter 4. Only a draft that
he made in his notebook still survives, not the final version he
sent.</p>
<p>2 Kemp Leonardo, vii, 4; Kemp’s theme in this and other works is the
unifying patterns that lie below Leonardo’s diverse endeavors.</p>

<p>13 I would like to thank Margot Pritzker for an original of the
second edition and some scholarship surrounding it. Vasari’s book is
available in many places online.</p>
<p>14 Vasari declared that his theme was “the rise of the arts to
perfection [during the era of ancient Rome], their decline, and their
restoration or rather renaissance.”</p>
<p>15 Anonimo Gaddiano.</p>
<p>16 Depending on definitions and standards, different scholars put
this number as low as twelve and as high as eighteen. According to Luke
Syson, curator at the National Gallery of London and then the
Metropolitan Museum of New York: “He started probably no more than 20
pictures in a career that lasted nearly half a century and only 15
surviving pictures are currently agreed to be entirely his, of which at
least four are to some degree incomplete.” A running discussion of the
changing expert attributions and disputes over Leonardo autograph
paintings can be found at “List of Works by Leonardo da Vinci,”
Wikipedia,

was born in this cottage because it is listed on a tax document as being
uninhabitable. However, that description may have been to minimize taxes
on a dilapidated cottage that was, most of the time, left vacant.</p>

<p>1 Nicholl, l61. Among those arguing that Leonardo began his
apprenticeship around 1466 are Beck, “Ser Piero da Vinci and His Son
Leonardo,” 29; Brown, 76. Piero da Vinci’s 1469 tax return lists
Leonardo as one of his dependents in Vinci, but this was not a specific
claim of residence; Piero himself did not live there, and it was not
accepted by the tax authorities, who crossed out Leonardo’s name.</p>

<p>4 Codex Ash., 1:9a; Notebooks/Richter, 495. (Richter claims that the
two quotes are not contradictory, for the latter refers to students, but
I think they do express conflicting sentiments and that the latter is
closer to Leonardo’s reality.)</p>

<p>14 Arasse, 38, 43. Arasse notes, “As the codex Trivulziano and the
Manuscript B show, Leonardo transcribed almost half of Luigi Pulci’s
‘All Latin Words in order.’ . . . The list in codex Trivulziano follows
almost to the letter pages 7–10 of De Re Militari by Valturio.” The
Codex Trivulziano dates from around 1487–90.</p>

<p>21 There is a record of the Lords of Florence paying Lorenzo de’
Medici 150 florins for the statue in 1476, but most experts now date its
actual creation to between 1466 and 1468. See Nicholl, 74; Brown, 8;
Andrew Butterfield, The Sculptures of Andrea del Verrocchio (Yale,
1997), 18.</p>
<p>22 Many scholars believe that Leonardo was the model for David.
Martin Kemp is among those more skeptical. “Seems to be a romantic
fantasy to me,” he told me, “but I am austere about evidence! They
exploit statements of naturalism, but their statues would not have been
‘portraits’ of their models.”</p>

<p>35 Many scholars date the drawing to circa 1472, which I think is
correct, but the British Museum, where it is located, dates it to
1475–80.</p>

There are various versions and copies of reliefs done by Verrocchio’s
workshop. The Alexander the Great in the National Gallery of Washington,
DC, can be seen at

also Butterfield, The Sculptures of Andrea Del Verrocchio, 231.</p>
<p>37 Gary Radke makes the argument that Leonardo was involved in
sculpting the Beheading of Saint John. See Gary Radke, ed., Leonardo da
Vinci and the Art of Sculpture (Yale, 2009); Carol Vogel, “Indications
of a Hidden Leonardo,” New York Times, April 23, 2009; Ann Landi,

Leonardo’s drawing and Verrocchio’s sculptures, and who was influencing
whom by the late 1470s, see Brown, 68–72.</p>

<p>42 “Io morando dant sono chontento,” he wrote. Serge Bramly is among
those who assumes that “dant” is a contraction for “d’Antonio” (84).
Carlo Pedretti, in his commentary on Richter’s translations of
Leonardo’s notebooks, has a totally different interpretation,
interpreting the words as “Jo Morando dant sono contento” (“I, Morando
d’Antonio, agree as to”) and suggesting that it was a draft for some
agreement (Commentary, 314).</p>
<p>43 Uffizi, Cabinet of Prints and Drawings, no. 8P. His drawing of a
helmeted warrior may have been earlier, circa 1472; see note 35

Studies in the Book of Tobit (Bloomsbury, 2006), 72–89.</p>
<p>46 Brown, 47–52; Nicholl, 88.</p>
<p>47 The argument is made most forcefully by David Alan Brown (51). For
a pushback, see Jill Dunkerton, “Leonardo in Verrocchio’s Workshop:
Re-examining the Technical Evidence,” National Gallery Technical
Bulletin 32 (2011), 4–31: “That he was capable of making observant
studies of nature in his paintings as well as his sculpture is confirmed
by the bright-eyed raptor that swoops down over the head of the Baptist.
. . . It is important never to underestimate the painting skills of
Verrocchio.” Luke Syson, who once had Tobias in his care as a curator,
told me he thought that Verrocchio was in fact very good with nature and
may have painted the dog and fish.</p>
<p>48 Nicholl, 89.</p>
<p>49 Vasari, 1486. Verrocchio subsequently was commissioned to paint
the altar in the Pistoia Cathedral, but he delegated most of the work to
Lorenzo di Credi. Jill Dunkerton and Luke Syson, “In Search of
Verrocchio the Painter,” National Gallery Technical Bulletin 31 (2010),
4; Zöllner, 1:18; Brown, 151.</p>
<p>50 The evidence shows that Verrocchio started the painting in the
1460s, then put it aside. Work on it was resumed in the mid-1470s, with
Leonardo reworking the landscape, finishing the body of Christ (though
the loincloth had already been done by Verrocchio), as well as painting
his angel. Dunkerton, “Leonardo in Verrocchio’s Workshop,” 21; Brown,

<p>30 Larry Feinberg, The Young Leonardo (Santa Barbara Museum, 2011),
177, and Zöllner, 1:58, agree that the figure behind Mary is Joseph.
Kemp Marvellous, 46, and Nicholl, 171, are among those who say Joseph is
hard to identify in the final version. Nicholl wrote, “The father is
unidentified, submerged into the periphery. One might resist a
psychoanalytical interpretation of this, but it is a motif too recurrent
to ignore—Leonardo always excises Joseph from the Holy Family.”</p>

<p>36 Some scholars have suggested a later date, including the late
1480s, based on the similarity of the pose to the Virgin of the Rocks,
the use of walnut panel, and the resemblance of the church to sketches
he made while in Milan. I think (following Juliana Barone, Martin
Clayton, Frank Zöllner, and others) that he made the drawing around 1480
and then modified it over the years, including while in Milan and then
after he did his anatomy studies of 1510. See Syson (with essay by Scott
Nethersole), 139; Juliana Barone, “Review of Leonardo da Vinci, Painter

<p>7 Leonardo first refers to him as Salai in 1494; Paris Ms. H, 2:16v.
The term is usually translated as “little devil,” but it has the
connotation of someone a bit unclean as well as devilish, like a little
rascal or scamp. It derives from a Tuscan word meaning “limb of the
devil.” His name is sometimes written Salaì, with an accent creating a
third syllable, thus making the pronunciation sah-lie-yee. The name
comes from a demon in Luigi Pulci’s epic poem Il Morgante, a work that
Leonardo owned; in the poem, the name is given as Salai, without an
accent on the i.</p>

<p>20 Squaring a circle in this manner is even more mathematically
complex than doubling a cube. It was not until 1882 that it was proven
impossible. That is because π is a transcendental number, rather than
merely being an algebraic irrational number. It is not the root of any
polynomial with rational coefficients, and it is impossible to construct
its square root with a compass and ruler.</p>

patrons said that the picture had not been finished, they meant that it
had not been completed according to the terms of the contract. Instead
of showing the Virgin and Child with angels, as was required, it showed
the Virgin and Child with an angel and Saint John.” He contends, “It has
been argued therefore that the Paris picture was removed from the
church, probably in the 1490s, and that the London picture was a
substitute. But the documents exclude this possibility. They make it
clear beyond reasonable doubt that the picture commissioned in 1483 was
still in the church in 1508. Had the patrons disposed of it before that
time, the painters would have had no contractual obligation to provide a
new version, and no payment was made to them for one. Equally, the
documents indicate that the patrons did not return the picture to
Leonardo. In order to make a second version, he needed access to the
original, and this was not provided before 1508. Accordingly, one
picture, evidently the one in the Louvre, was supplied between 1483 and
1490, and the London version cannot have been painted before 1508.”</p>

<p>12 Most scholars now agree that it is Lucrezia Crivelli, and that
seems to comport with three court poet sonnets in praise of such a
painting. However, Luke Syson, who organized the London 2011 show of
Leonardo’s Milan paintings, suggests in the catalogue (105) that “it is
not impossible” that the subject may actually be Beatrice d’Este, even
though there is scant resemblance to other portrayals of her and no
poems of praise that almost surely would have accompanied such a
painting.</p>

Interpretation (Leiden: Brill Studies, 1992). Most of the quotations I

paragone and his proposed treatise on painting is a manuscript, probably
compiled by Melzi, that is known as the Codex Urbinas 1270 and is in the
Vatican. The paragone forms the opening section of the treatise; it
originated in Paris Ms. A and what is known as the lost Libro A, which
has been reconstructed by Carlo Pedretti from passages in the Codex
Urbinas. See note 12 below.</p>

versions, see Carlo Pedretti, Leonardo da Vinci on Painting (University

the Melzi manuscript known as the Codex Urbinas 1270 and other codices
(see p. 9 for the Pacioli quote). Melzi listed eighteen manuscripts of
Leonardo that he drew upon, but only seven are still known to exist. For

Hope, “The Last ‘Last Supper,’ ” New York Review of Books, August 9,
2001, argues against Steinberg and others who believe that Leonardo
means to portray the Eucharist: “Leonardo omitted the one indispensable
element of the Eucharist, namely the chalice, which was regularly
included in depictions of the Institution. The table is full of fruit,
rolls, and wine glasses, so Christ’s hands had to be in proximity to
them; but it is difficult to believe that Renaissance Christians would
have associated the Eucharist with a half-drunk wine tumbler. In any
case, the eucharistic theme, though regularly shown in altarpieces for
obvious reasons, was not regarded as appropriate for refectories.”</p>

<p>1 Codex Forster, 3:88r; Notebooks/J. P. Richter, 1384. Some scholars,
including Richter, assume that Caterina was a servant; more recent

informing them of Leonardo’s death, refers to property in Fiesole, which
would not seem to be the same property. However, it seems most probable
that Francesco da Vinci’s property in question was used by Leonardo,
then went to his half brothers.</p>

<p>9 Scholars are divided. “I continue to believe in it as a potent and
unflinching portrait of himself at the end of his life,” Charles Nicholl
wrote (Nicholl, 493). On the other hand, Martin Kemp says it “is
generally but incorrectly taken to be a self-portrait.” Some skeptics
say the style more resembles Leonardo’s work from just after 1500, which
would make it less likely as a self-portrait given that the drawing is
of an older man.</p>

<p>3 John 1:14.</p>
<p>4 Codex Atl., 179r-a, from May 1509, shows a pupil’s sketch of the
pointing hand. Carlo Pedretti, who dated the Codex Atlanticus sheet,
also believes that the Saint John was begun about 1509 and provided the
inspiration for some copies in Italy beginning then (Chronology, 166).
Martin Kemp agrees (Marvellous, 336). Luke Syson suggests it may have
been begun in Milan in 1499 and viewed in 1506 in Florence, where it may
have provided the inspiration for an altarpiece there (“The Rewards of
Service,” 44). Kenneth Clark dated the picture to 1514–15 (248). Frank
Zöllner suggests it was 1513–16 (2:248).</p>

<p>14 Most of the drawings are in Windsor, which officially dates them
to 1517–18, during his period in France. That date was accepted by the
Milan exhibition of 2015. Others, including Carmen Bambach (in Master
Draftsman, 630), have suggested a slightly earlier date of 1515–17.
Whenever he started them, Leonardo had them with him when he died in
France in 1519, and they were part of the bequest to Francesco
Melzi.</p>
