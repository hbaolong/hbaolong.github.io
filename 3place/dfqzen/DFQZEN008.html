Notebooks</h4>
<p>THE COLLECTIONS</p>
<p>As the offspring of a long line of notaries, Leonardo da Vinci had an
instinct for keeping records. Jotting down observations, lists, ideas,
and sketches came naturally. In the early 1480s, shortly after his
arrival in Milan, he began his lifelong practice of keeping notebooks on
a regular basis. Some of them began as loose sheets the size of a
tabloid newspaper. Others were little volumes bound in leather or
vellum, the size of a paperback or even smaller, which he carried around
to make field notes.</p>
<p>One purpose of these notebooks was to record interesting scenes,
especially those involving people and emotions. “As you go about town,”
he wrote in one of them, “constantly observe, note, and consider the
circumstances and behavior of men as they talk and quarrel, or laugh, or
come to blows.”1 For that purpose, he kept a small notebook hanging from
his belt. According to the poet Giovanni Battista Giraldi, whose father
knew Leonardo:</p>
<p>When Leonardo wished to paint a figure, he first considered what
social standing and emotion it was to represent; whether noble or
plebeian, joyful or severe, troubled or serene, old or young, irate or
quiet, good or evil; and when he had made up his mind, he went to places
where he knew that people of that kind assembled and observed their
faces, their manners, dresses, and gestures; and when he found what
fitted his purpose, he noted it in a little book which he was always
carrying in his belt.2</p>
<p>These little books on his belt, along with the larger sheets in his
studio, became repositories for all of his manifold passions and
obsessions, many of them sharing a page. As an engineer, he honed his
technical skills by drawing mechanisms he encountered or imagined. As an
artist, he sketched ideas and made preparatory drawings. As a court
impresario, he jotted down designs for costumes, contrivances for moving
scenery and stages, fables to be enacted, and witty lines to be
performed. Scribbled in the margins were to-do lists, records of
expenses, and sketches of people who caught his imagination. Over the
years, as his scientific study got more serious, he filled pages with
outlines and passages for treatises on topics such as flight, water,
anatomy, art, horses, mechanics, and geology. About the only things
missing are intimate personal revelations or intimacies. These are not
Saint Augustine’s Confessions but rather the outward-looking
enthrallments of a relentlessly curious explorer.</p>
<p>In collecting such a medley of ideas, Leonardo was following a
practice that had become popular in Renaissance Italy of keeping a
commonplace and sketch book, known as a zibaldone. But in their content,
Leonardo’s were like nothing the world had ever, or has ever, seen. His
notebooks have been rightly called “the most astonishing testament to
the powers of human observation and imagination ever set down on
paper.”3</p>
<p>The more than 7,200 pages now extant probably represent about
one-quarter of what Leonardo actually wrote,4 but that is a higher
percentage after five hundred years than the percentage of Steve Jobs’s
emails and digital documents from the 1990s that he and I were able to
retrieve. Leonardo’s notebooks are nothing less than an astonishing
windfall that provides the documentary record of applied creativity.</p>
<p>As usual with Leonardo, however, there is an element of mystery
involved. He rarely put dates on his pages, and much of their order has
been lost. After his death, many of the volumes were disassembled and
the interesting pages were sold or reorganized into new codices by
various collectors, most notably the sculptor Pompeo Leoni, who was born
in 1533.</p>
<p>For example, one of the many repackaged collections is the Codex
Atlanticus, now in Milan’s Biblioteca Ambrosiana, which consists of
2,238 pages assembled by Leoni from different notebooks Leonardo used
from the 1480s to 1518. The Codex Arundel, now in the British Library,
contains 570 pages of Leonardo’s writings from the same long time span
and was assembled by an unknown collector in the seventeenth century. In
contrast, the Codex Leicester contains 72 pages, mainly on geology and
water studies, that have remained together since Leonardo composed them
around 1508 to 1510; it is now owned by Bill Gates. There are
twenty-five codices and manuscript collections of notebook pages in
Italy, France, England, Spain, and the United States. (See list of
Leonardo’s Notebooks in Frequently Cited Sources.) Modern scholars, most
notably Carlo Pedretti, have tried to determine the order and dates of
many of the pages, a task made more difficult because Leonardo sometimes
went back to fill in the unused parts of a page or add to an old
notebook he had put aside.5</p>
<p>Early on, Leonardo primarily recorded ideas that he considered useful
to his art and engineering. For example, the early notebook known as
Paris Ms. B, begun around 1487, contains drawings of possible
submarines, black-sailed stealth ships, and steam-powered cannons, as
well as some architectural designs for churches and ideal cities. Later
notebooks show Leonardo pursuing curiosity for its own sake, and that in
turn evolved into glimmerings of profound scientific inquiry. He became
interested not only in how things work but why.6</p>
<p>Because good paper was costly, Leonardo tried to use every edge and
corner of most pages, cramming as much as possible on each sheet and
jumbling together seemingly random items from diverse fields. Often he
would go back to a page, months or even years later, to add another
thought, just as he would go back to his painting of Saint Jerome, and
later his other paintings, to refine his work as he evolved and
matured.</p>
<p>The juxtapositions can seem haphazard, and to some extent they are;
we watch his mind and pen leap from an insight about mechanics, to a
doodle of hair curls and water eddies, to a drawing of a face, to an
ingenious contraption, to an anatomical sketch, all accompanied by
mirror-script notes and musings. But the joy of these juxtapositions is
that they allow us to marvel at the beauty of a universal mind as it
wanders exuberantly in free-range fashion over the arts and sciences
and, by doing so, senses the connections in our cosmos. We can extract
from his pages, as he did from nature’s, the patterns that underlie
things that at first appear disconnected.</p>
<p>The beauty of a notebook is that it indulges provisional thoughts,
half-finished ideas, unpolished sketches, and drafts for treatises not
yet refined. That, too, suited Leonardo’s leaps of the imagination, in
which brilliance was often unfettered by diligence or discipline. He
occasionally declared an intent to organize and refine his notebook
jottings into published works, but his failure to do so became a
companion to his failure to complete artworks. As he did with many of
his paintings, he would hang on to the treatises that he was drafting,
occasionally make a few new strokes and refinements, but never see them
through to being released to the public as complete.</p>
<p>ONE SHEET</p>
<p>One way to appreciate the notebooks is to focus on just one sheet of
paper. Let’s pick a large one, twelve-by-eighteen inches, that he
composed in about 1490, dubbed by Pedretti a “theme sheet” because it
encompasses so many of Leonardo’s interests.7 (See fig. 24 to follow
along.)</p>
<p>Fig. 24. A notebook sheet c. 1490.</p>
<p>On the center-left is a figure Leonardo loved to draw or doodle: a
semiheroic, craggy old man with a long nose and jutting chin. Wearing a
toga, he looks both noble and slightly comic. In the list of possessions
he had brought to Milan in 1482, Leonardo described one drawing as “the
head of an old man with an enormous chin,” and we will see variations of
this craggy character reappearing often in his notebooks.</p>
<p>Just below the old man are the trunk and branches of a leafless tree,
which blend into his toga and suggest the aorta and arteries of his
blood system. Leonardo believed that analogy was a way to appreciate the
unity of nature, and among the analogous forms he explored was the
branching pattern that could be found in trees, in the arteries of the
human body, and in rivers and their tributaries. He studied carefully
the rules governing these branching systems, such as how the size of
each branch relates to the size of the main trunk, artery, or river. On
this notebook sheet, he hints at the similarity of such branching
patterns in humans and in plants.</p>
<p>Flowing out of the man’s back is a geometrical drawing of a conical
shape that contains some equilateral triangles. Leonardo was beginning
his long attempt to solve the ancient mathematical challenge of
“squaring the circle,” constructing a square that has the same area as a
given circle using only a compass and straightedge. He was not great at
algebra or even arithmetic, but he had a feel for how geometry could be
used to transform one shape into another while keeping the area
constant. Scattered on the sheet are geometrical drawings with shaded
portions that have the same area.</p>
<p>The conical drawing attached to the man’s back resembles a hill, and
Leonardo has it flow into a sketch of a mountainous landscape. The
result is a seamless connection of geometry to nature and a glimpse into
Leonardo’s art of spatial thinking.</p>
<p>A clear theme emerges as we look at the flow of this part of the
drawing from right to left (the direction in which Leonardo drew). The
branches of the leafless tree merge into the man’s body, then into the
conical geometrical pattern, and finally into the mountainous landscape.
What Leonardo probably began as four distinct elements ended up woven
together in a way that illustrates a fundamental theme in his art and
science: the interconnectedness of nature, the unity of its patterns,
and the analogy between the workings of the human body and those of the
earth.</p>
<p>Just below these elements is something simpler to fathom. It’s a
quick but energetic sketch of his vision for Ludovico Sforza’s horse
monument. With just a few strokes, he is able to convey motion and
vitality. Farther down are two heavy-looking mechanical devices,
unexplained by any notes, perhaps some system for casting the horse.
Barely visible at the bottom of the right half of the sheet is a faint
little sketch of a walking horse.</p>
<p>Next to the centerfold at the bottom are two leafy stems, which have
such precise botanical detail that they seem to have been drawn from
direct observation. Vasari wrote that Leonardo studiously drew plants,
and his surviving drawings show how sharp his eye was in observing
nature. His botanical correctness is evident in his paintings, most
notably the Louvre version of the Virgin of the Rocks.8 Continuing his
theme of merging patterns in nature and geometry, one of the grass
shoots curving from the base of the stems merges into a perfect
semicircle drawn with a compass.</p>
<p>On the far right are studies of fluffy cumulus clouds, each with
different patterns of light and shading. Below them is a drawing of a
column of falling water stirring up turbulence as it plunges into a
placid pool; this was a subject that he would still be drawing at the
end of his life. And scattered about on the sheet are doodles of other
subjects that he would return to often: a bell tower for a church, curls
of hair, shimmering branches of foliage, and a lily emerging from swirls
of grass.</p>
<p>There is one note on the page that seems disconnected from everything
else. It is a recipe for making blond-brown hair dye: “To make hair
tawny, take nuts and boil them in lye and immerse the comb in it, then
comb the hair and let it dry in the sun.” This may have been a notation
in preparation for a court pageant. But it is more likely, I think, that
the recipe is a rare intimate jotting. Leonardo was deep into his
thirties by now. Perhaps he was resisting going gray.</p>
