<h4 id="chapter-19-personal-turmoil">CHAPTER 19 Personal Turmoil</h4>
<p>CATERINA’S DEATH</p>
<p>On the rare occasions when he recorded a family event in his
notebooks, Leonardo sometimes displayed a notarial tic of repeating the
date. Thus he recorded the arrival of his mother, Caterina, now widowed
and in her sixties, to live with him in Milan:</p>
<p>On the 16th day of July.</p>
<p>Caterina came on the 16th day of July 1493.1</p>
<p>During her years with her husband, Accattabriga, Caterina had four
daughters and a son. But sometime around 1490 her husband died and their
son was killed by a shot from a crossbow. In his notebook shortly after
that, Leonardo jotted, “Can you tell me what la Caterina wishes to do?”
Apparently, she wanted to come live with him.</p>
<p>On a page adjoining the one in his notebook where he records
Caterina’s arrival, Leonardo writes a rudimentary family tree that she
likely helped him make, listing the names of his father and
grandparents. In June 1494 she is included in an accounting of his
expenses: he gives 3 soldi to Salai and 20 soldi to her.2</p>
<p>She apparently died later that month. A record in the state archives
of Milan reports, “On Thursday 26 June at the Parish of the Saints
Nabore and Felix at Porta Vercellina, Caterina from Florence, 60 years
old, died of malaria.” The evidence from the earlier archival records is
that she was actually about fifty-eight, which is close enough to be in
accord given the vagaries of records at the time.3</p>
<p>Leonardo sublimated whatever emotions he felt; he records nothing
about her death, only an accounting of the cost of her funeral. On the
listing of soldis he spent, he even crossed out the word “death” and
wrote “burial.”4</p>

<p>The detachment seems odd, and some have argued that the expenses seem
low for a mother’s funeral. He would spend four times as much in 1497 on
the silver cloth, velvet trim, and tailoring for a cloak for Salai.5 But
a careful look shows that it was, in fact, a funeral suitable for his
mother rather than a household servant. It was brightly lit, featured
four priests, and was carefully planned and recorded for posterity.6</p>
<p>CAREER STRUGGLES</p>
<p>When he began painting The Last Supper around 1495, Leonardo was at a
high point in his career. With his official appointment as artist and
engineer of the Sforza court, he was comfortably ensconced at Milan’s
old palace, the Corte Vecchia, with his retinue of assistants and
students. He was renowned as a painter, admired as the sculptor of the
mammoth clay model for the horse monument, beloved as a pageant
impresario, and respected as a student of optics, flight, hydraulics,
and anatomy.</p>
<p>But his life became unsettled in the late 1490s, after Caterina’s
death and the completion of The Last Supper. The bronze for his horse
monument had been redirected in 1494 to make cannon to defend against a
possible French invasion, and it soon became clear that Ludovico was not
going to replace it. Instead of major new commissions or portraits of
ducal mistresses, he found himself doing interior design work and
engaging in disputes over pay and performance. All the while, Duke
Ludovico became increasingly preoccupied, and rightly so, by the French
threats to his tenuous hold on power.</p>
<p>One of Leonardo’s projects was doing the decorative painting for a
set of small rooms in the Sforza Castle, known as the camerini, that the
duke planned to use as his private retreat. One of the vaulted
wood-paneled rooms, the Sala delle Asse, was designed by Leonardo as an
enchanted painted forest with sixteen trees, figuratively serving as an
architectural fantasia of columns. Their branches intertwined in complex
patterns worthy of his mathematical mind, and woven through this caprice
was a golden rope that twisted into beautifully complex knots, a
lifelong love of his. “In the trees we find a beautiful invention by
Leonardo, where all the branches transform themselves into bizarre
knots,” wrote Lomazzo.7</p>
<p>The execution did not go as well as the conception, as was often the
case with Leonardo. There was a dispute, and one of the duke’s
secretaries wrote in June 1496, “The painter who is decorating the
camerini caused something of a scandal today, and for this reason he has
left.”8 The secretary asked if someone could be sent from Venice to
finish the work.</p>
<p>That never happened, and Leonardo resumed the commission in early
1498, just as he was finishing work on The Last Supper. But there were
other disputes that are revealed in letters drafted in his notebooks.
One angry missive from 1497 has been ripped in half, so we have only
fragments of sentences that express his frustration. “You remember the
commission to paint the camerini” reads one phrase. “Of the horse I will
say nothing because I know the times are bad,” is another. Then comes a
tumult of complaints, including “two years of my salary still not
received.”9 In another letter drafted for the duke, Leonardo again
complained about money and seems to imply that he had to put aside work
on The Last Supper to make money by decorating the Sala delle Asse.
“Perhaps your Excellency did not give further orders to [pay me],
believing that I had money enough,” he wrote. “It vexes me greatly that
having to earn my living has forced me to interrupt the work and to
attend to small matters, instead of following up the work which your
Lordship entrusted to me.”10</p>
<p>As with The Last Supper, Leonardo was too slow-paced in painting the
Sala delle Asse to put up with using the traditional fresco method that
required each section to be executed rapidly on wet plaster before it
dried. Instead, he again used a tempera-oil mixture on a dry wall (the
wood panels of the room had been removed, unfortunately). The dry
plaster did not absorb the pigments, resulting in the same deterioration
as suffered by The Last Supper. It was restored badly around 1901,
salvaged in the 1950s, and in 2017 was in the midst of a more careful,
laser-guided restoration.</p>
<p>After his temperamental disputes involving the Sala delle Asse,
Leonardo hit a low point. He found himself drafting job applications,
including a letter written in the third person to the council of the
nearby town of Piacenza, which was commissioning brass doors for the
cathedral there. He wrote the letter extolling himself as if he planned
to have a supporter send it on his behalf. “Open your eyes and look
carefully that your money is not spent as to purchase your own shame,”
the letter reads. “There is not a man who is capable—and you may believe
me—except Leonardo the Florentine, who is making the bronze horse of the
Duke Francesco.”11</p>
<p>Larger forces intervened to rescue Leonardo from his employment
concerns. In the summer of 1499, an invasion force sent by the new
French king, Louis XII, was bearing down on Milan. Leonardo added up the
money in his cash box, 1,280 lire, distributed some to Salai (20 lire)
and others, and then proceeded to hide the rest in paper packets around
his studio to keep it safe from invaders and looters. At the beginning
of September, Duke Ludovico fled the city, which the French king entered
a month later. As Leonardo feared, mobs destroyed the homes of many of
his friends and looted their treasures. His studio was spared, but the
French troops destroyed the clay model of his unbuilt horse monument by
shooting arrows at it.</p>
<p>The French were, it turned out, protective of Leonardo. The day after
his arrival, the king went to see The Last Supper, and he even asked
whether it might be possible to cart it back to France. Fortunately, his
engineers told him it was impossible. Instead of fleeing, Leonardo spent
the next few months working with the French. He made a note to contact
one of the painters who had arrived in Milan with King Louis and to get
from him “the method of using dry colors and the white salt method and
how to make coated paper.” On the same page, he laid out a leisurely set
of preparations for the long trip from Milan back to Florence and Vinci,
which he would not begin until December. “Have two covered boxes made to
be carried on mules. One of which leave at Vinci. Buy some tablecloths,
napkins, cloaks, caps, and shoes, four pair of hose, a chamois jerkin
and skins to make new ones. Sell what you cannot take with you.” In
other words, he was not scurrying to escape from the French.</p>
<p>In fact, he had forged a secret deal with the new French governor of
Milan, the Count of Ligny, to meet him in Naples and act as a military
engineer inspecting fortifications. In one of the most curious entries
in his notebooks, on the same page as his list preparing for his trip,
Leonardo writes not only in his mirror script but using a simplistic
code in which he spells names and cities backward: “Go and find ingil
[Ligny] and tell him you will wait for him at amor [Roma] and that you
will go with him to ilopan [Napoli].”12</p>
<p>That plot never came to fruition. What made Leonardo finally leave
Milan was the news that his former patron Ludovico was plotting a
comeback. In late December, Leonardo made arrangements to transfer 600
florins from his Milanese bank to an account in Florence, then left with
his retinue of assistants and his friend the mathematician Luca Pacioli.
Eighteen years after he had arrived in Milan with a lute and a letter
for Ludovico proclaiming his talents as an engineer and artist, Leonardo
da Vinci was returning home to Florence.</p>
