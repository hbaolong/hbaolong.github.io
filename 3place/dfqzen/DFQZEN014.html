<p>THEATRICAL FLIGHTS OF FANCY</p>
<p>“Study the anatomy of the wings of a bird together with the breast
muscles that move those wings,” Leonardo wrote in his notebook. “Do the
same for man to show the possibility that man could sustain himself in
the air by the flapping of wings.”1</p>
<p>For more than two decades, beginning around 1490, Leonardo
investigated, with an unusual degree of diligence, the flight of birds
and the possibility of designing machines that would enable humans to
fly. He produced more than five hundred drawings and thirty-five
thousand words scattered over a dozen notebooks on these topics. The
endeavor wove together his curiosity about nature, his observational
skills, and his engineering instincts. It was also an example of his
method of using analogy to discover nature’s patterns. But in this case
the analogy process extended even further: it took him closer than most
of his other investigations into the realm of pure theory, including
fluid dynamics and the laws of motion.</p>
<p>Leonardo’s interest in flying machines began with his work on
theatrical pageants. From his early days in Verrocchio’s workshop until
his final days in France, he threw himself into such spectacles with
enthusiasm. His mechanical birds were first used—and last used—as court
amusements.2</p>
<p>It was at such pageants that he first saw ingenious devices for
allowing actors to rise, descend, and float as if they were flying.
Brunelleschi, his predecessor as an artist-engineer in Florence, was the
“master of effects” at a dazzling production of an Annunciation in the
1430s, which was revived using the same machinery in 1471, when Leonardo
was nineteen and working in Florence. Suspended from the rafters was a
ring holding twelve boys dressed as angels. Contraptions made of large
pulleys and hand winches kept everything moving and soaring. Mechanical
devices allowed the gilt-winged angels, holding harps and flaming
swords, to fly down from heaven and rescue the saved souls, while from
below the stage the realm of hell shot forth devils. Gabriel then
arrived for the Annunciation. “As the angel ascended amongst the voices
of jubilation,” one spectator wrote, “he moved his hands up and down,
and flapped his wings as if he were truly flying.”</p>
<p>Another play performed at the time, The Ascension, also featured
flying characters. “The sky opened and the Heavenly Father appeared,
miraculously suspended in air,” according to a report, “and the actor
playing Jesus seems to have truly ascended on his own, and without
tottering reached a great height.” Christ’s ascension was accompanied by
a group of winged angels, who had been suspended in the make-believe
clouds above the stage.3</p>
<p>Leonardo’s first studies of flight were for such theatrical
extravaganzas. One set of drawings that he made just before he left
Florence for Milan in 1482 shows bat-like wings, with cranks that would
create motion but not actual flight, connected to what appear to be
theatrical mechanisms.4 Another shows a featherless wing connected to
gears, pulleys, cranks, and cables: the configuration of the crank and
the size of the gears indicate that the whole system is designed for the
theater and not for an actual flying machine. But even for his theater
designs, he was carefully observing nature. On the back of this sheet he
drew a jagged downward line with the caption “This is the manner in
which birds descend.”5</p>
<p>There is one other clue that these drawings from his Florence days
were meant for the theater rather than actual flight: in all of the
ingenious military devices he says he can build in his job application
letter to Ludovico Sforza, there is no boast about being able to make
machines for human flight. It was only after he got to Milan that his
attention turned from theatrical fantasy to real-world engineering.</p>
<p>BIRD-WATCHING</p>
<p>Here’s a test. All of us have looked at birds in flight, but have you
ever stopped to look closely enough to see whether a bird moves its wing
upward at the same speed as it flaps it down? Leonardo did, and he was
able to observe that the answer differs based on species. “There are
some birds that move their wings more swiftly when they lower them than
when they raise them, and this is the case with doves and such birds,”
he recorded in a notebook. “There are others which lower their wings
more slowly than they raise them, and this is seen with crows and
similar birds.” And some, such as magpies, raise and lower at the same
speed.6</p>
<p>Leonardo had a strategy he used to refine his observational skills.
He would write down marching orders to himself, determining how he would
sequence his observations in a methodical step-by-step way. “First
define the motion of the wind and then describe how the birds steer
through it with only the simple balancing of the wings and tail,” he
wrote in one example. “Do this after the description of their
anatomy.”7</p>
<p>He recorded in his notebooks scores of such observations, most of
which we find amazing mainly because we never make the effort, in our
daily lives, to observe ordinary phenomena so closely. On a trip to the
vineyard he had been given by Ludovico in Fiesole, a village just north
of Florence, he watched a chukar partridge take flight. “When a bird
with a wide wingspan and a short tail wants to take off,” he reported,
“it will lift its wings with force and turn them to receive the wind
beneath them.”8 From observations like that he was able to make a
generalization about the relationship between a bird’s tail and its
wings: “Birds with short tails have very wide wings, which by their
width take the place of the tail; and they make considerable use of the
helms set on the shoulders when they wish to turn.” And later: “When
birds are descending near the ground and the head is below the tail,
they lower the tail, which is spread wide open, and take short strokes
with the wings; consequently, the head is raised above the tail, and the
speed is checked so that the bird can alight on the ground without a
shock.”9 Ever notice all that?</p>
<p>After twenty years of observing, he decided to compile his notes into
a treatise. Much of the work was gathered into an eighteen-folio
notebook, now known as the Codex on the Flight of Birds.10 It begins by
exploring the concepts of gravity and density, and it ends by
envisioning the launch of a flying machine he had designed and comparing
its components with the body parts of a bird. But like much of
Leonardo’s work, the treatise remained unfinished. He was more
interested in nailing concepts than he was in polishing them for
publication.</p>
<p>When he was compiling his bird treatise, Leonardo began a section of
another notebook with a directive to put them into a broader context.
“To explain the science of the flight of birds, it is necessary to
explain the science of the winds, which we shall prove by the motion of
the waters,” he wrote. “The understanding of this science of water will
serve as a ladder to arrive at the knowledge of things flying in the
air.”11 He not only got the basic principles of fluid dynamics correct,
but he was able to turn his insights into rudimentary theories that
foreshadowed those of Newton, Galileo, and Bernoulli.</p>
<p>No scientist before Leonardo had methodically shown how birds stay
aloft. Most had simply embellished on Aristotle, who mistakenly thought
that birds were supported by air the way ships were by water.12 Leonardo
realized that keeping aloft in air requires fundamentally different
dynamics than doing so in water, because birds are heavier than air and
are thus subject to being pulled down by gravity. The first two folios
of his Codex on the Flight of Birds deal with the laws of gravity, which
he calls the “attraction of one object to another.” The force of
gravity, he wrote, acts in the direction of “an imaginary line between
the centers of each object.”13 He then described how to calculate the
center of gravity of a bird, a pyramid, and other complex shapes.</p>
<p>One important observation he made ended up informing his studies of
flight and of the flow of water. “Water cannot be compressed like air,”
he wrote.14 In other words, a wing beating down on air will compact the
air into a smaller space, and as a result the air pressure underneath
the wing will be higher than the pressure of the rarefied air above it.
“If the air could not be compressed, the birds would not be able to
support themselves upon the air that is struck by their wings.”15 The
downward flap of the wing pushes the bird higher and thrusts it
forward.</p>
<p>He also realized that the pressure the bird puts on the air is met by
an equal and opposite pressure that the air puts on the bird. “See how
the wings, striking against the air, sustain the heavy eagle in the thin
air on high,” he noted, then added, “As much force is exerted by the
object against the air as by the air against the object.”16 Two hundred
years later, Newton would state a refined version of this as his third
law of motion: “To every action there is always opposed an equal
reaction.”</p>
<p>Leonardo accompanied this concept with a precursor to Galileo’s
principle of relativity: “The effect of moving air on a stationary
object is as great as it is when the object is moving and the air is
stationary.”17 In other words, the forces that would act upon a bird
flying through air are the same as the forces acting on a bird that is
stationary but has air rushing past it (such as a bird in a wind tunnel
or one hovering on a windy day over a spot on the ground). He drew an
analogy from his studies of water flow, which he had recorded earlier in
the same notebook: “The action of a pole drawn through still water
resembles that of running water against a stationary pole.”18</p>
<p>Even more presciently, he had an intimation of what became known,
more than two hundred years later, as Bernoulli’s principle: when air
(or any fluid) flows faster, it exerts less pressure. Leonardo drew a
cross section of a bird’s wing, which shows that the top is curved more
than the underside. (This is also true of airplane wings, which make use
of this principle.) The air flowing over the curved top of the wing has
farther to travel than the air flowing under the bottom. Therefore, the
air on top has to travel faster. The difference in speed means that the
air on the top of the wing exerts less pressure than the air on the
bottom, thus helping the bird (or airplane) to stay aloft. “The air
above birds is thinner than the usual thinness of the other air,” he
wrote.19 Leonardo thus realized, before other scientists, that a bird
stays aloft not merely because the wings beat downward against the air
but also because the wings propel the bird forward and the air lessens
in pressure as it rushes over the wing’s curved top surface.</p>
<p>FLYING MACHINES</p>
<p>Both his observations on anatomy and his analysis of the physics
convinced Leonardo that it was possible to build a winged mechanism that
would allow humans to fly. “A bird is an instrument working according to
mathematical law, and it is in the capacity of man to reproduce such an
instrument,” he wrote. “A man with wings large enough and duly attached
might learn to overcome the resistance of the air and raise himself upon
it.”20</p>
<p>Combining engineering with physics and anatomy, Leonardo began in the
late 1480s to devise contraptions to accomplish this. His first design
(fig. 50) looks like a big bowl with four oar-like blades that were to
alternate in pairs moving up and down, like the four-winged dragonfly he
had studied earlier. To overcome the relative weakness of human breast
muscles, this cross between a flying saucer and a health club torture
chamber has the operator use his legs to push pedals, his arms to crank
a gear-and-pulley mechanism, his head to pump a piston, and his
shoulders to pull cables. It is unclear how he would manage to steer the
machine.21</p>
<p>Fig. 50. A human-powered flying machine.</p>
<p>Fig. 51. A wing with hinges.</p>
<p>Seven pages later in the same notebook, Leonardo produced an elegant
drawing (fig. 51) of an experiment that used a bat-like wing, its thin
bones covered with a membrane of skin rather than feathers, that was
similar to those he had drawn for theatrical productions back in
Florence. The wing is attached to a thick wooden plank, which, he
specified, should weigh 150 pounds, like an average man, and to a lever
mechanism that would pump the wing. Leonardo even drew an amusing man in
motion, jumping up and down on top of the end of the long lever. A
little sketch below shows a clever element: when the wing is swinging
upward a hinge allows it to point its tips downward and encounter less
resistance, then slowly be moved by a spring and pulley back into a
rigid position.22 Later ideas included devising skin flaps in the wings
that would be closed on the downswing but fly open on the upswing to
minimize air resistance.</p>
<p>At times, Leonardo abandoned the hope of achieving self-propelled
flight and designed gliders instead. One of these was shown to be
basically workable in a reconstruction done five hundred years later by
the ITN television network in Britain.23 However, for most of his career
he remained committed to achieving human-powered flight in birdlike
devices with flapping wings. He drew more than a dozen variations, using
pedals and levers with the pilot prone or standing, and began referring
to his machine as the uccello, or bird.</p>
<p>In his spacious accommodations at the Corte Vecchia, Leonardo had
what he called “la mia fabrica” (my factory). In addition to being the
room where he had worked on the ill-fated horse monument for the
Sforzas, it provided space for experimenting with flying machines. At
one point he wrote himself a note about how to conduct a flight
experiment on the roof without being seen by the workers constructing a
tower—the tiburio that he had failed in the competition to design—on the
cathedral next door. “Make a large and tall model, and you will have a
room on the upper roof,” he wrote. “If you stand on the roof at the side
of the tower, the men at work upon the tiburio will not see you.”24</p>
<p>At other times, he envisioned testing a machine over water while
wearing a life-preserver. “You will experiment with this machine over a
lake and you will wear as a belt a long wineskin, so that if you fall
in, you will not drown.”25 And finally, when all of his experiments were
nearing an end, he mingled his plans with fantasies. “The large bird
will take its first flight from the back of the great Swan,” he wrote on
the last folio of his Codex on the Flight of Birds, referring to Swan
Mountain (Monte Ceceri) near Fiesole, “filling the universe with
amazement, filling all writings with its fame, and bringing eternal
glory to the nest where it was born.”26</p>
<p>With beautiful little drawings, Leonardo portrayed the elegance of
birds as they twisted, turned, shifted their center of gravity, and
maneuvered the winds. He also pioneered the use of vector-like lines and
swirls to show invisible currents. But for all the beauty of his art and
all the ingenuity of his designs, he was never able to create a
self-propelled human flying machine. To be fair, after five hundred
years nobody else has either.</p>
<p>Late in his life, Leonardo sketched a cylinder with two feeble wings,
clearly meant as a toy. Look closely, and you can see that it’s attached
to a wire line. In what may be his last drawing of a mechanical bird, he
reverted, in a poignant and slightly sad fashion, to the way he began
drawing them thirty years earlier: as dazzling but ephemeral little
contraptions for the momentary amusement of audiences at court
theatricals and public pageants.27</p>
