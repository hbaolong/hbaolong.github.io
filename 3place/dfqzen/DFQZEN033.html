<p>THE WORD BECOMES FLESH</p>
<p>During the decade of 1506–16, as he wandered between Milan and Rome
pursuing his passions and seeking patronage, Leonardo worked on three
paintings that have an elegiac and spiritual quality, as if he realized
that his days were numbered and was contemplating what lay on the road
ahead. These include two sensuous paintings of Saint John the Baptist,
one of them converted into a rendering of Bacchus by someone many years
later, and a painting of an angel of the Annunciation that has been
lost. They feature, as do their related drawings, a sweetly androgynous
young man with an enigmatic aura, looking (or perhaps even leering)
directly at the viewer and pointing a finger. Despite his immersion into
science, or perhaps because of it, Leonardo had developed an
ever-deepening appreciation for the profound spiritual mystery of our
place in the cosmos. And as Kenneth Clark noted, “Mystery to Leonardo
was a shadow, a smile and a finger pointing into darkness.”1</p>
<p>What distinguishes these paintings is not that they have a religious
theme; like the work of every other Renaissance master, most of
Leonardo’s paintings did. Nor are they the only times that Leonardo used
a pointing gesture; Saint Anne in the Burlington House cartoon and Saint
Thomas in The Last Supper both point upward. What makes this late trio
of paintings distinctive is that the spiritual pointing gesture is
directed personally to us, the viewer. When this late-career version of
the angel of the Annunciation delivers his divine message, he is
speaking and gesturing not to the Virgin Mary but to us. Likewise, in
both pictures of Saint John, he is looking intimately at us, pointing
the way to our own salvation.</p>
<p>Some critics over the centuries have asserted that Leonardo marred
the spiritual nature of these pieces—perhaps heretically and
intentionally so—by giving them an erotic allure. A cataloguer of the
French royal collection complained in 1625 that the Saint John painting
“does not please because it does not arouse feelings of devotion.” In a
similar vein, Kenneth Clark wrote, “Our whole sense of propriety is
outraged,” adding that the depiction of Saint John is “almost
blasphemously unlike the fiery ascetic of the Gospels.”2</p>
<p>I doubt Leonardo thought he was being blasphemous or heretical, nor
should we. The seductive and sensuous elements of these works enhance
rather than lessen the powerful spiritual intimacy that Leonardo
intended them to convey. Saint John comes across as less the Baptist
than the Seducer, but in portraying him this way Leonardo connected the
spiritual to the sensual. By highlighting the ambiguity between spirit
and flesh, Leonardo gave his own charged meaning to “the Word became
flesh and dwelt among us.”3</p>
<p>SAINT JOHN THE BAPTIST</p>
<p>From sketches in his notebook, we know that Leonardo had already
begun working on his portrait of Saint John the Baptist (fig. 128) while
in Milan in 1509.4 But as with many of his late paintings, most of which
he ended up working on out of personal passion rather than to fulfill a
commission, he carried it around with him and intermittently enhanced it
until the end of his life. His focus was on the saint’s eyes, mouth, and
gesture. The close-up of him emerging from the darkness confronts us
starkly. There are no distracting landscapes or lights, and only the
Leonardesque ringlets of hair provide any ornamentation.</p>
<p>Fig. 128. Saint John the Baptist.</p>
<p>As he gestures heavenward in a recognition of divine providence, John
is also pointing toward the source of the light that radiates on him,
thus fulfilling his biblical role “to bear witness of the Light.”5
Leonardo’s use of chiaroscuro, contrasting deep shadows with striking
illumination, not only enhances the sense of mystery of the scene; it
also conveys a powerful feeling of John’s role as witness to the true
Light.6</p>
<p>John wears one of the enigmatic smiles that became a Leonardo
signature, but it has a come-hither naughtiness to it that is missing in
the smiles of Saint Anne and the Mona Lisa. His smile beckons in ways
that are sultry and seductive as well as spiritual. That gives the
picture its erotic frisson, as does John’s androgynous appearance. His
shoulders and chest are broad yet feminine. The model seems to be Salai,
with his soft face and cascade of curls.</p>
<p>Leonardo’s oil-painting technique, which involved applying multiple
thin layers of translucent glazes, was by now even more painstaking and
slow. He rushed no painting, to a fault. In Saint John the Baptist, this
pace enhanced the delicacy of his sfumato. The contours are soft, the
lines are blurred, and the transitions between light and dark are
exceedingly subtle.</p>
<p>There is, however, one exception. Leonardo has painted John’s hand
with a greater sharpness and clarity, just as he had done with the
blessing hand of Christ in Salvator Mundi. The line separating John’s
pointing index finger from his second finger is as distinct as any line
in any of Leonardo’s paintings, almost like one of Michelangelo’s. It is
possible this is due to a misguided restoration at some point. But I
suspect it was intentional on Leonardo’s part, especially since he uses
a similar sharp delineation for the pointing hand in what became the
Bacchus version of the painting. With his theory of acuity perspective,
Leonardo knew that such sharpness would make the hand appear nearer, as
if in a different plane. There is a visual disjuncture: the hand is
positioned at the same distance as the softly delineated arm, but
because it is sharper it seems to pop out toward us and be more in
focus.7</p>
<p>SAINT JOHN WITH THE ATTRIBUTES OF BACCHUS</p>
<p>Fig. 129. Saint John converted to a Bacchus.</p>
<p>The other variation of this theme to emerge from Leonardo’s
studio—probably based on a drawing by Leonardo and partly painted by
him, but also the product of others in his workshop—shows a full-length
Saint John sitting on a dark rock formation with a sunny landscape of a
mountain and a river to his right (fig. 129). In an inventory of Salai’s
estate in 1525, it is referred to as a large-scale painting of Saint
John, and it is identified this way in an inventory of the French royal
art collection at Fontainebleau in 1625. But in a subsequent inventory
of that collection done in 1695, the designation of Saint John is
crossed out and replaced by “Bacchus in a landscape.” From this we can
surmise that, sometime in the late 1600s, the painting was altered,
perhaps for reasons of religious and sexual propriety, to turn Saint
John into Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry.8</p>
<p>There was once a beautiful red-chalk preparatory drawing by Leonardo
for this painting housed in a small museum at a mountaintop religious
sanctuary above the town of Varese, north of Milan. It showed Saint John
sitting on a rocky ledge, his left leg crossed atop his right, his body
muscular but a bit fleshy, like Salai’s, his eyes set deep in shadow and
staring at us intensely. “I have seldom seen an original Leonardo of
more revealing character,” Carlo Pedretti wrote in the early 1970s after
making a pilgrimage to view it.9 Sadly, the drawing was stolen from the
little museum in 1973, and it has not been publicly seen since. In this
drawing, Leonardo had depicted Saint John completely nude, and there is
evidence that is the way he was originally rendered in the painting. But
when he was converted from a Baptist to a Bacchus, a leopard-skin cloth
was placed over his crotch, a wreath of ivy was put on his head, and his
staff or cross was turned into a thyrsus. Leonardo’s discomforting
ambiguity between spirit and flesh was thus replaced by a less jarring
depiction of a pagan god whose lustiness is not heretical.10</p>
<p>In both Leonardo’s drawing and in the painting, the most striking
element is the pointing gesture. Instead of pointing heavenward, as in
Leonardo’s starker rendition of the saint, this time he is pointing off
into the darkness to his left, out of the scene of the picture. As with
The Last Supper, the viewer can almost hear the words that accompany the
gesture, in this case John heralding the arrival of “he who cometh after
me, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.”11</p>
<p>The smile is not as seductive and the body is more muscular and
masculine than in Leonardo’s other treatment of Saint John, but the face
is just as androgynous and the curls just as Salaicious. Once again, the
pointing hand as well as the left leg are more sharply delineated than
is typical of Leonardo, whose signature sfumato is evident in other
parts of the picture. It is unclear whether this is because the leg and
hand were retouched or were the work of a student, or because Leonardo
made their lines sharper so they would feel closer to the viewer. I
suspect it was the latter.</p>
<p>ANGEL OF THE ANNUNCIATION AND ANGEL INCARNATE</p>
<p>Fig. 130. Copy of the lost Angel of the Annunciation.</p>
<p>Around this time, Leonardo painted another pointing figure, an angel
of the Annunciation making a gesture that was similar to that in Saint
John the Baptist. The painting is now lost, but we know what it looked
like from copies made by some of Leonardo’s followers, including one by
Bernardino Luini (fig. 130). There is also a charcoal drawing of it
(fig. 131) by a student on one of Leonardo’s notebook pages, which is
surrounded by Leonardo’s own drawings of horses and men and geometrical
figures. On the student’s sketch, Leonardo used his left-handed hatches
to correct the pointing arm to put it in the proper foreshortened
perspective.</p>
<p>Fig. 131. Student sketch of Angel of the Annunciation, corrected by
Leonardo.</p>
<p>The scene of the Annunciation, in which the angel Gabriel announces
to the Virgin Mary that she will become the mother of Christ, was the
subject of the first painting that Leonardo did mainly on his own during
the early 1470s, while working in Verrocchio’s studio (fig. 11). This
time, however, there is no Virgin Mary in the picture for the angel to
address. Instead, he looks directly at us, and his upward-pointing
gesture seems addressed to us. Like Saint John, he is heralding the
impending arrival of Christ the savior in human form, a miraculous union
of spirit and flesh.</p>
<p>The angel and Saint John are depicted in the exact same pose, with
the same come-hither stare, enigmatic smile, seductive cocking of the
head and twisting of the neck, and glorious curls lustrously lit. Only
the arm of the hand pointing to heaven has changed. Saint John is
turning to the left, so the upraised arm is seen going across the body.
Then as now, Leonardo’s boy angels are feminine to the point of being
androgynous; it is true of the angel in his early Annunciation and also
of the one in Virgin of the Rocks. In this new Annunciation, the
androgyny is more pronounced than ever. The angel has budding breasts,
and his face is even more girlish.</p>
<p>Fig. 132. Angel Incarnate, with breasts and erection.</p>
<p>There is another drawing of the angel, one that is astonishing and
still controversial. Made around 1513, while Leonardo was in Rome, it
shows a lewdly leering transgender version of the Angel of the
Annunciation with female breasts and a large erect penis (fig. 132).
Known as the Angel Incarnate or Angel in the Flesh, it is the extreme
example of Leonardo’s dance around what he viewed as the ambiguous
border between flesh and spirit as well as the one between feminine and
masculine.</p>
<p>Although it is on one of Leonardo’s sheets of blue-tinted paper,
which he used for many of his anatomical studies and drawings of
mirrors, it is unlikely that he was the primary draftsman of this Angel
Incarnate. It is not rendered beautifully, and it is delineated and
shaded clumsily, without Leonardo’s distinctive left-handed hatching. It
seems to have been drawn by the same student—probably Salai—who drew the
notebook sketch of the Angel of the Annunciation that Leonardo
corrected; the smile, the gesture, the hollow eyes, the pose, and even
the flawed foreshortening of the raised arm are similar. Since it was
done on Leonardo’s paper, it was likely done for his amusement and
perhaps with a few corrections by him, just as he had corrected the
Angel of the Annunciation drawing.</p>
<p>The result looks like a catamite, eager to please, signaling a
willingness for an assignation. The juxtaposition of the angel’s
female-nippled breasts and girlish face with its prominent erection and
dangling balls makes the drawing a cross between playful caricature and
hermaphroditic pornography. The drawing echoes the theme from Leonardo’s
Saint John drawings: it combines the angelic and the devilish, and it
links spiritual aspiration with sexual arousal. At one point someone
apparently tried to erase the penis but succeeded mainly in rubbing away
the blue tint of the paper and leaving some erasure marks.12</p>
<p>The history of the drawing is a bit mysterious, perhaps because the
British royal family, in whose collection it once resided, was
embarrassed by it. One story is that a German scholar came to view it at
the Royal Library and whisked it away under his cape; whether or not
that is true, it was rediscovered in 1990 in the private collection of
an aristocratic German family.13</p>
<p>A counterpoint to the gesturing androgynous angels and saints is a
poetic and sweet drawing known as the Pointing Lady (fig. 133), which
the renowned scholar Carlo Pedretti called “perhaps the most beautiful
drawing by Leonardo.”14 The subject has the same mysterious and enticing
smile as her male counterparts, and she likewise is looking directly at
us, directing our attention to a mystery unseen. But unlike Leonardo’s
various angels of the period, there is nothing devilish about her.</p>
<p>Fig. 133. Pointing Lady.</p>
<p>The black-chalk drawing is simple, but it encompasses many facets of
Leonardo’s life and work: his love of plays and pageants, his feel for
fantasy, his mastery of enigmatic smiles, his ability to make women come
alive, and the twisting movement. It is filled with the curls and
spirals that Leonardo loved: there is a hint of a stream and waterfall
creating eddies, and there are flowers and reeds whose curves echo those
of the lady’s diaphanous dress and blowing hair.</p>
<p>Most notably, the lady is pointing. In his last decade, Leonardo is
mesmerized by that gesture, the signal of tidings borne by a mysterious
guide who has come to show us the way. The drawing may have been meant
as an illustration for Dante’s Purgatorio, showing the beautiful
Matelda, who guides the poet through ritual bathings in a forest, or it
could have been a drawing for a costume pageant. But whatever was the
original intent, it became more. It is a profoundly expressive and
poetic drawing by a man entering the twilight and still searching for
guidance about the eternal mysteries that his science and his art have
not, and cannot, explain.</p>
