<h4 id="chapter-33-conclusion">CHAPTER 33 Conclusion</h4>
<p>GENIUS</p>
<p>In the introduction to this book, I suggested that it was unhelpful
to toss around the word genius as if it were a superhuman trait,
bestowed by heaven and not within the ken of mere mortals. As I hope you
will by now agree, Leonardo was a genius, one of the few people in
history who indisputably deserved—or, to be more precise, earned—that
appellation. Yet it is also true that he was a mere mortal.</p>
<p>The most obvious evidence that he was human rather than superhuman is
the trail of projects he left unfinished. Among them were a horse model
that archers reduced to rubble, an Adoration scene and battle mural that
were abandoned, flying machines that never flew, tanks that never
rolled, a river that was never diverted, and pages of brilliant
treatises that piled up unpublished. “Tell me if anything was ever
done,” he repeatedly scribbled in notebook after notebook. “Tell me.
Tell me. Tell me if ever I did a thing. . . . Tell me if anything was
ever made.”1</p>
<p>Of course, the things he did finish were enough to prove his genius.
The Mona Lisa alone does that, as do all of his art masterpieces as well
as his anatomical drawings. But by the end of writing this book, I even
began to appreciate the genius inherent in his designs left unexecuted
and masterpieces left unfinished. By skirting the edge of fantasy with
his flying machines and water projects and military devices, he
envisioned what innovators would invent centuries later. And by refusing
to churn out works that he had not perfected, he sealed his reputation
as a genius rather than a master craftsman. He enjoyed the challenge of
conception more than the chore of completion.</p>
<p>One reason that he was reluctant to relinquish some of his works and
declare them completed was that he relished a world in flux. He had an
uncanny ability to convey movements—of the body and the mind, of
machines and horses, and of rivers and everything else that flows. No
instant, he wrote, is self-contained, just as no action in a theatrical
pageant nor any drop in a flowing river is self-contained. Each moment
incorporates what came right before and what is coming right after.
Similarly, he looked upon his art and engineering and his treatises as a
part of a dynamic process, always receptive to a refinement by the
application of a new insight. He updated Saint Jerome in the Wilderness
after thirty years, when his anatomy experiments taught him something
new about neck muscles. If he had lived another decade, he likely would
have continued to refine the Mona Lisa for that much longer.
Relinquishing a work, declaring it finished, froze its evolution.
Leonardo did not like to do that. There was always something more to be
learned, another stroke to be gleaned from nature that would make a
picture closer to perfect.</p>
<p>What made Leonardo a genius, what set him apart from people who are
merely extraordinarily smart, was creativity, the ability to apply
imagination to intellect. His facility for combining observation with
fantasy allowed him, like other creative geniuses, to make unexpected
leaps that related things seen to things unseen. “Talent hits a target
that no one else can hit,” wrote the German philosopher Arthur
Schopenhauer. “Genius hits a target no one else can see.”2 Because they
“think different,” creative masterminds are sometimes considered
misfits, but in the words that Steve Jobs helped craft for an Apple
advertisement, “While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see
genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change
the world are the ones who do.”3</p>
<p>What also distinguished Leonardo’s genius was its universal nature.
The world has produced other thinkers who were more profound or logical,
and many who were more practical, but none who was as creative in so
many different fields. Some people are geniuses in a particular arena,
such as Mozart in music and Euler in math. But Leonardo’s brilliance
spanned multiple disciplines, which gave him a profound feel for
nature’s patterns and crosscurrents. His curiosity impelled him to
become among the handful of people in history who tried to know all
there was to know about everything that could be known.</p>
<p>There have been, of course, many other insatiable polymaths, and even
the Renaissance produced other Renaissance Men. But none painted the
Mona Lisa, much less did so at the same time as producing unsurpassed
anatomy drawings based on multiple dissections, coming up with schemes
to divert rivers, explaining the reflection of light from the earth to
the moon, opening the still-beating heart of a butchered pig to show how
ventricles work, designing musical instruments, choreographing pageants,
using fossils to dispute the biblical account of the deluge, and then
drawing the deluge. Leonardo was a genius, but more: he was the epitome
of the universal mind, one who sought to understand all of creation,
including how we fit into it.</p>
<p>LEARNING FROM LEONARDO</p>
<p>The fact that Leonardo was not only a genius but also very
human—quirky and obsessive and playful and easily distracted—makes him
more accessible. He was not graced with the type of brilliance that is
completely unfathomable to us. Instead, he was self-taught and willed
his way to his genius. So even though we may never be able to match his
talents, we can learn from him and try to be more like him. His life
offers a wealth of lessons.</p>
<p>Be curious, relentlessly curious. “I have no special talents,”
Einstein once wrote to a friend. “I am just passionately curious.”4
Leonardo actually did have special talents, as did Einstein, but his
distinguishing and most inspiring trait was his intense curiosity. He
wanted to know what causes people to yawn, how they walk on ice in
Flanders, methods for squaring a circle, what makes the aortic valve
close, how light is processed in the eye and what that means for the
perspective in a painting. He instructed himself to learn about the
placenta of a calf, the jaw of a crocodile, the tongue of a woodpecker,
the muscles of a face, the light of the moon, and the edges of shadows.
Being relentlessly and randomly curious about everything around us is
something that each of us can push ourselves to do, every waking hour,
just as he did.</p>
<p>Seek knowledge for its own sake. Not all knowledge needs to be
useful. Sometimes it should be pursued for pure pleasure. Leonardo did
not need to know how heart valves work to paint the Mona Lisa, nor did
he need to figure out how fossils got to the top of mountains to produce
Virgin of the Rocks. By allowing himself to be driven by pure curiosity,
he got to explore more horizons and see more connections than anyone
else of his era.</p>
<p>Retain a childlike sense of wonder. At a certain point in life, most
of us quit puzzling over everyday phenomena. We might savor the beauty
of a blue sky, but we no longer bother to wonder why it is that color.
Leonardo did. So did Einstein, who wrote to another friend, “You and I
never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into
which we were born.”5 We should be careful to never outgrow our wonder
years, or to let our children do so.</p>
<p>Observe. Leonardo’s greatest skill was his acute ability to observe
things. It was the talent that empowered his curiosity, and vice versa.
It was not some magical gift but a product of his own effort. When he
visited the moats surrounding Sforza Castle, he looked at the four-wing
dragonflies and noticed how the wing pairs alternate in motion. When he
walked around town, he observed how the facial expressions of people
relate to their emotions, and he discerned how light bounces off
differing surfaces. He saw which birds move their wings faster on the
upswing than on the downswing, and which do the opposite. This, too, we
can emulate. Water flowing into a bowl? Look, as he did, at exactly how
the eddies swirl. Then wonder why.</p>
<p>Start with the details. In his notebook, Leonardo shared a trick for
observing something carefully: Do it in steps, starting with each
detail. A page of a book, he noted, cannot be absorbed in one stare; you
need to go word by word. “If you wish to have a sound knowledge of the
forms of objects, begin with the details of them, and do not go on to
the second step until you have the first well fixed in memory.”6</p>
<p>See things unseen. Leonardo’s primary activity in many of his
formative years was conjuring up pageants, performances, and plays. He
mixed theatrical ingenuity with fantasy. This gave him a combinatory
creativity. He could see birds in flight and also angels, lions roaring
and also dragons.</p>
<p>Go down rabbit holes. He filled the opening pages of one of his
notebooks with 169 attempts to square a circle. In eight pages of his
Codex Leicester, he recorded 730 findings about the flow of water; in
another notebook, he listed sixty-seven words that describe different
types of moving water. He measured every segment of the human body,
calculated their proportional relationships, and then did the same for a
horse. He drilled down for the pure joy of geeking out.</p>
<p>Get distracted. The greatest rap on Leonardo was that these
passionate pursuits caused him to wander off on tangents, literally in
the case of his math inquiries. It “has left posterity the poorer,”
Kenneth Clark lamented. But in fact, Leonardo’s willingness to pursue
whatever shiny subject caught his eye made his mind richer and filled
with more connections.</p>
<p>Respect facts. Leonardo was a forerunner of the age of observational
experiments and critical thinking. When he came up with an idea, he
devised an experiment to test it. And when his experience showed that a
theory was flawed—such as his belief that the springs within the earth
are replenished the same way as blood vessels in humans—he abandoned his
theory and sought a new one. This practice became common a century
later, during the age of Galileo and Bacon. It has, however, become a
bit less prevalent these days. If we want to be more like Leonardo, we
have to be fearless about changing our minds based on new
information.</p>
<p>Procrastinate. While painting The Last Supper, Leonardo would
sometimes stare at the work for an hour, finally make one small stroke,
and then leave. He told Duke Ludovico that creativity requires time for
ideas to marinate and intuitions to gel. “Men of lofty genius sometimes
accomplish the most when they work least,” he explained, “for their
minds are occupied with their ideas and the perfection of their
conceptions, to which they afterwards give form.” Most of us don’t need
advice to procrastinate; we do it naturally. But procrastinating like
Leonardo requires work: it involves gathering all the possible facts and
ideas, and only after that allowing the collection to simmer.</p>
<p>Let the perfect be the enemy of the good. When Leonardo could not
make the perspective in the Battle of Anghiari or the interaction in the
Adoration of the Magi work perfectly, he abandoned them rather than
produce a work that was merely good enough. He carried around
masterpieces such as his Saint Anne and the Mona Lisa to the end,
knowing there would always be a new stroke he could add. Likewise, Steve
Jobs was such a perfectionist that he held up shipping the original
Macintosh until his team could make the circuit boards inside look
beautiful, even though no one would ever see them. Both he and Leonardo
knew that real artists care about the beauty even of the parts unseen.
Eventually, Jobs embraced a countermaxim, “Real artists ship,” which
means that sometimes you ought to deliver a product even when there are
still improvements that could be made. That is a good rule for daily
life. But there are times when it’s nice to be like Leonardo and not let
go of something until it’s perfect.</p>
<p>Think visually. Leonardo was not blessed with the ability to
formulate math equations or abstractions. So he had to visualize them,
which he did with his studies of proportions, his rules of perspective,
his method for calculating reflections from concave mirrors, and his
ways of changing one shape into another of the same size. Too often,
when we learn a formula or a rule—even one so simple as the method for
multiplying numbers or mixing a paint color—we no longer visualize how
it works. As a result, we lose our appreciation for the underlying
beauty of nature’s laws.</p>
<p>Avoid silos. At the end of many of his product presentations, Jobs
displayed a slide of a sign that showed the intersection of “Liberal
Arts” and “Technology” streets. He knew that at such crossroads lay
creativity. Leonardo had a free-range mind that merrily wandered across
all the disciplines of the arts, sciences, engineering, and humanities.
His knowledge of how light strikes the retina helped inform the
perspective in The Last Supper, and on a page of anatomical drawings
depicting the dissection of lips he drew the smile that would reappear
in the Mona Lisa. He knew that art was a science and that science was an
art. Whether he was drawing a fetus in the womb or the swirls of a
deluge, he blurred the distinction between the two.</p>
<p>Let your reach exceed your grasp. Imagine, as he did, how you would
build a human-powered flying machine or divert a river. Even try to
devise a perpetual-motion machine or square a circle using only a ruler
and a compass. There are some problems we will never solve. Learn
why.</p>
<p>Indulge fantasy. His giant crossbow? The turtle-like tanks? His plan
for an ideal city? The man-powered mechanisms to flap a flying machine?
Just as Leonardo blurred the lines between science and art, he did so
between reality and fantasy. It may not have produced flying machines,
but it allowed his imagination to soar.</p>
<p>Create for yourself, not just for patrons. No matter how hard the
rich and powerful marchesa Isabella d’Este begged, Leonardo would not
paint her portrait. But he did begin one of a silk-merchant’s wife named
Lisa. He did it because he wanted to, and he kept working on it for the
rest of his life, never delivering it to the silk merchant.</p>
<p>Collaborate. Genius is often considered the purview of loners who
retreat to their garrets and are struck by creative lightning. Like many
myths, that of the lone genius has some truth to it. But there’s usually
more to the story. The Madonnas and drapery studies produced in
Verrocchio’s studio, and the versions of Virgin of the Rocks and Madonna
of the Yarnwinder and other paintings from Leonardo’s studio, were
created in such a collaborative manner that it is hard to tell whose
hand made which strokes. Vitruvian Man was produced after sharing ideas
and sketches with friends. Leonardo’s best anatomy studies came when he
was working in partnership with Marcantonio della Torre. And his most
fun work came from collaborations on theatrical productions and evening
entertainments at the Sforza court. Genius starts with individual
brilliance. It requires singular vision. But executing it often entails
working with others. Innovation is a team sport. Creativity is a
collaborative endeavor.</p>
<p>Make lists. And be sure to put odd things on them. Leonardo’s to-do
lists may have been the greatest testaments to pure curiosity the world
has ever seen.</p>
<p>Take notes, on paper. Five hundred years later, Leonardo’s notebooks
are around to astonish and inspire us. Fifty years from now, our own
notebooks, if we work up the initiative to start writing them, will be
around to astonish and inspire our grandchildren, unlike our tweets and
Facebook posts.</p>
<p>Be open to mystery. Not everything needs sharp lines.</p>
<p>coda</p>
<p>Describe the tongue of the woodpecker</p>
<p>The tongue of a woodpecker can extend more than three times the
length of its bill. When not in use, it retracts into the skull and its
cartilage-like structure continues past the jaw to wrap around the
bird’s head and then curve down to its nostril. In addition to digging
out grubs from a tree, the long tongue protects the woodpecker’s brain.
When the bird smashes its beak repeatedly into tree bark, the force
exerted on its head is ten times what would kill a human. But its
bizarre tongue and supporting structure act as a cushion, shielding the
brain from shock.1</p>
<p>There is no reason you actually need to know any of this. It is
information that has no real utility for your life, just as it had none
for Leonardo. But I thought maybe, after reading this book, that you,
like Leonardo, who one day put “Describe the tongue of the woodpecker”
on one of his eclectic and oddly inspiring to-do lists, would want to
know. Just out of curiosity. Pure curiosity.</p>
