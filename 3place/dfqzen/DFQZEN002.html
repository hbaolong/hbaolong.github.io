<h4 id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h4>
<p>Marco Cianchi professionally read the manuscript of this book, made
many suggestions, helped with translations, and was a guide in Italy. A
professor at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, he has degrees in
art history from the universities of Florence and Bologna. He is a
longtime collaborator with Carlo Pedretti and is the author of many
books, including Le macchine di Leonardo (Becocci, 1981), Leonardo, I
Dipinti (Giunti, 1996), and Leonardo, Anatomia (Giunti, 1997). He has
become a delightful friend.</p>
<p>Juliana Barone of Birkbeck College, University of London, was also a
professional reader of much of the manuscript. She wrote her doctoral
dissertation on Leonardo at Oxford and is the author of Leonardo: The
Codex Arundel (British Library, 2008), Studies of Motion: Drawings by
Leonardo from the Codex Atlanticus (De Agostini, 2011), The Treatise on
Painting (De Agostini, 2014), and the forthcoming books Leonardo,
Poussin and Rubens and Leonardo in Britain.</p>
<p>Dr. Barone was recommended to me by Martin Kemp, emeritus professor
of art history at Oxford University and one of the great Leonardo
scholars of our era. Over the past fifty years, he has authored or
co-authored seventy-two books and scholarly articles on Leonardo. He
graciously spent time with me at Trinity College, Oxford, shared with me
his research findings and an early manuscript of his co-authored book
Mona Lisa: The People and the Painting (Oxford University Press, 2017),
and in countless emails offered his opinions on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Frederick Schroeder, the curator of the Codex Leicester for Bill
Gates, and Domenico Laurenza, an author of many books on Leonardo’s
engineering and inventions, read my sections on the Codex Leicester and
provided me with their own updated translations from that work,
scheduled for publication in 2018. David Linley took me to Windsor
Castle to see the Leonardo drawings there and introduced me to the
curator and Leonardo scholar Martin Clayton.</p>
<p>Other Leonardo scholars and curators who read parts of the
manuscript, gave me access to collections, provided assistance, or
offered ideas include Luke Syson, formerly of the National Gallery in
London and now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City;
Vincent Delieuvin and Ina Giscard d’Estaing of the Louvre; David Alan
Brown of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Valeria Poletto
of the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice; Pietro Marani of the
Politecnico di Milano; Alberto Rocca of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in
Milan; and Jacqueline Thalmann of Christ Church, Oxford. I am also
grateful to the staffs of the Villa I Tatti in Florence, the Dumbarton
Oaks Library in Washington, DC, and the Harvard Fine Arts Library. Getty
Images, led by Dawn Airey, adopted this book as a special project; the
team overseeing the acquisition of images included David Savage, Eric
Rachlis, Scott Rosen, and Jill Braaten. At the Aspen Institute, my deep
thanks go to Pat Zindulka, Leah Bitounis, Eric Motley, Chloe Tabah, and
other indulgent colleagues.</p>
<p>All of my books for more than three decades have been published by
Simon andandandand Schuster, and that is because the team there is
extraordinarily talented: Alice Mayhew, Carolyn Reidy, Jonathan Karp,
Stuart Roberts (who shepherded this book and its illustrations), Richard
Rhorer, Stephen Bedford, Jackie Seow, Kristen Lemire, Judith Hoover,
Julia Prosser, Lisa Erwin, Jonathan Evans, and Paul Dippolito. During my
entire writing career, Amanda Urban has been my agent, adviser, wise
counselor, and friend. Strobe Talbott, my colleague from when I joined
Time in 1979, has read the drafts of every one of my books, beginning
with The Wise Men, made incisive comments, and offered encouragement; as
we enter the dessert course of our careers, I savor the procession of
memories that began when we were in our salad days.</p>
<p>As usual, my greatest gratitude goes to my wife, Cathy, and our
daughter, Betsy, who are wise, smart, supportive, and very loving. Thank
you.</p>

<p>Andrea Salai, born Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno (1480–1524).

<p>The ducat was the gold coin of Venice. The florin was the gold coin
of Florence. Both contained 3.5 grams (0.12 ounces) of gold, which would
make them worth about 38 in 2017. One ducat or florin was worth
approximately 7 lire or 120 soldi, which were silver coins.</p>
<p>NOTE REGARDING THE COVER</p>
<p>The cover is a detail of an oil painting in Florence’s Uffizi Gallery
that was once thought to be a self-portrait painted by Leonardo. Based
on recent X-ray analysis, it is now considered to be a portrait of
Leonardo by an unknown artist done in the 1600s. It is based on, or is
the basis for, a similar portrait rediscovered in Italy in 2008, called
the Lucan portrait of Leonardo da Vinci. It has been copied many times.
A watercolor-on-ivory version painted in the 1770s by Giuseppe
Macpherson is in the British Royal Collection and in 2017 was in the
show “Portrait of the Artist” in the Queen’s Gallery of Buckingham
Palace.</p>
