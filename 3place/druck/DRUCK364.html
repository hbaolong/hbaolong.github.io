<h4 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h4>
<p>创新不是从零到一，而是改变一点点</p>
<p>创新总是被鼓励的，那么什么是创新呢？</p>
<p>前几天和一个漂亮的女生聊天，这个女生不会骑自行车。</p>
<p>有一次从地铁出来，要到目的地，差不多1公里左右，我说咱们骑个车吧。</p>
<p>这个漂亮的姑娘红着脸怯怯滴说：”我不会。“</p>
<p>我说干嘛不学呀，现在很少有人不会自行车了。然后，这个姑娘感慨地说了一句话：“我一直以为自行</p>
<p>车很快就会被淘汰了，现在才知道，不会骑自行车马上就要被淘汰了。”</p>
<p>是呀，谁能想到，在工业化几百年后的今天，自行车突然成了城市生活的基本技能。</p>
<p>自行车的起源大概是在18世纪末。</p>
<p>1790年，法国人西夫拉克发明了最原始的自行车。它只有两个轮子而没有传动装置，人骑在上面，需</p>
<p>用两脚蹬地驱车向前滚动。</p>
<p>1801年，俄国人阿尔塔马诺夫设计出用踏板踩动的自行车。</p>
<p>1817年，德国人德莱斯开始制作木轮车，样子跟西夫拉克的差不多。不过，在前轮上加了一个控制方</p>
<p>向的车把子，可以改变前进的方向.但是骑车依然要用两只脚，一下一下地蹬踩地面，才能推动车子向</p>
<p>前滚动，他自称为：小马崽。因此德国男爵卡尔•德莱斯成为一般公认的自行车发明人！</p>
<p>1839年，苏格兰人麦克米伦制造出木制车轮，装实心橡胶轮胎、前轮小、后轮大、坐垫较低、装有脚</p>
<p>踏板和曲柄连杆装置，骑者可以双脚离开地面的自行车。同年，麦克米伦又将木制自行车改为铁制自</p>
<p>行车。</p>
<p>1840年，英格兰的铁匠麦克米伦，在德莱斯发明的“小马崽”的基础上，进行了改进。他在前轮的车轴</p>
<p>上装上曲柄，再用连杆把曲柄和前面的脚蹬连接起来，并且前后轮都用铁制。这样一来，人的双脚真</p>
<p>正离开了地面，由双脚的交替踩动变为轮子的滚动。1842年，麦克米伦骑上这种车，一天跑了近20千</p>
<p>米。</p>
<p>1861年，法国的米肖父子。在前轮上安装了能转动的脚蹬板，车子的鞍座架在前轮上面。他们把这辆</p>
<p>车冠以“自行车”的雅名，并于1867年在巴黎博览会上展出，让观众大开眼界，曾一度掀起自行车热。</p>
<p>但是因高度的关系上下车及下坡时十分危险容易跌倒以及存在危险性又把鞍座改为固定在车架上。</p>
<p>1867年，英国人麦迪逊设计出第一辆装有钢丝辐条的自行车。</p>
<p>1874年，真正具有现代化形式的自行车诞生。英国人劳森在自行车上别出心裁地装上链条和链轮，用</p>
<p>后轮的转动来推动车子前进。但仍然不够协调与稳定。</p>
<p>1886年，英国的机械工程师斯塔利，从机械学、运动学的角度设计出了新的自行车样式，装上前叉和</p>
<p>车闸，使用滚子轴承，前后轮大小同，以保持平衡，并用钢管制成了菱形车架，还首次使用了橡胶车</p>
<p>轮。显著地提高了自行车的骑行性能。斯塔利不仅改进了自行车的结构，还改制了许多生产自行车部</p>
<p>件用的机床。</p>
<p>同年，英国人詹姆斯把自行车前后轮改为大小相同，并增加了链条，使其车型与现代自行车基本相</p>
<p>同。</p>
<p>1887年，德国曼内斯公司将无缝钢管首先用于自行车生产。</p>
<p>1888年，爱尔兰的兽医邓洛普，从医治牛胃气膨胀中得到启示，将自家花园用来浇水的橡胶管粘成圆</p>
<p>形并打足气装在自行车上，这是充气轮胎的开端。</p>
<p>从此，基本奠定了现代自行车的雏形。充气轮胎是自行车发展史上的一个划时代的创举不但从根本上</p>
<p>改变了自行车的骑行性能，也解决了自行车多年来最令人难受的震动问题，同时更把自行车的速度又</p>
<p>推进了许多。而且完善了自行车的使用功能。</p>
<p>从1791年到1888年，自行车的发明和改进，经历了近100年中这些发明者的不懈奋斗。从此，基本奠</p>
<p>定了现代自行车的雏形。时至今日，自行车已成为全世界人们使用最多，最简单，最实用的交通工</p>
<p>具。也许人们应该永远记住这些自行车的发明者们，他们的名字，丝毫不亚于汽车的发明者卡尔.本</p>
<p>茨。</p>
<p>在中国，1980年的自行车大军，是很多大城市的名片。随着小汽车进入每一个家庭，自行车离我们越</p>
<p>来越远，仿佛只能在赛场上看到了。</p>
<p>很多人觉得，自行车会完全消失。知道摩拜、OFO等的崛起。正应了那个美丽的姑娘说的话：“我以为</p>
<p>自行车要被淘汰了，原来不会自行车要被淘汰了。”</p>
<p>其实，从1790年到现在的200多年里，自行车自行车不停地在演化，每一点演化都在解决一个很小的</p>
<p>问题。而到了今天，成为了如此成熟和完美的产品。</p>
<p>哪一步不是创新呢？</p>
<p>其实，所谓的创新，就是这样：改变一点点，让它更有效。</p>

<p>Managing for Results</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>FROM YESTERDAY TO TODAY</p>
<p>Maximizing opportunities looks for those seven-league steps toward
realizing the ideal business</p>
<p>and obtaining rapidly the greatest benefits possible.</p>
<p>By projecting the ideal business design on the analysis of the
existing business all the products,</p>
<p>markets, distribution channels, cost centers, activities, and efforts
of the business can be sorted</p>
<p>out into three categories:</p>
<p>• One high-priority group where the real push has to be made, because
there is a great opportunity</p>
<p>to achieve extraordinary results.</p>
<p>• One high-priority group where the opportunity lies in not-doing;
that is, in rapid and</p>
<p>purposeful abandonment.</p>
<p>• One large and heterogeneous group of also-rans—products, mar- kets,
knowledge work, and so</p>
<p>on—in which neither efforts to excel nor abandonment promise
significant results.</p>
<p>To call abandonment an “opportunity” may come as a sur- prise. Yet
planned, purposeful</p>
<p>abandonment of the old and of the</p>
<p>unrewarding is a prerequisite to successful pursuit of the new and
highly promising. Above all,</p>
<p>abandonment is the key to innova- tion—both because it frees the
necessary resources and</p>
<p>because it stimulates the search for the new that will replace the
old</p>
<p>Push areas and abandonment complement each other and therefore
deserve equal priority.</p>
<p>The push priorities are easily identified. What should be pushed are
those areas where the results,</p>
<p>if successful, produce their costs many times over. These are
invariably the products or markets</p>
<p>that fit most closely the ideal-business design.</p>
<p>The General Motors’ experience is characteristic. Buick and Cadillac,
the two makes that were</p>
<p>profitable in 1921 and had market leadership, were also the only two
of the company’s eight makes</p>
<p>which fitted the ideal-business design.</p>
<p>Typical result areas which deserve priority are, for instance:</p>
<p>• Tomorrow’s breadwinners and sleepers</p>
<p>• The development efforts needed to replace tomorrow’s breadwin- ner
the day after tomorrow</p>
<p>• Important new knowledge and new distributive channels</p>
<p>• Cutting back high support costs, high policing costs and waste in
the cost structure</p>
<p>The areas of high potential are rarely over-supplied with</p>
<p>resources. Hence what matters is not whether the budget for such an
area is too high but whether</p>
<p>it is high enough for results.</p>
<p>The candidates for abandonment are also usually fairly obvious.</p>
<p>There is first the investment in managerial ego. Unjustified
specialties are also on the list. Then</p>
<p>there are unnecessary support activities, and waste that can be
eliminated without major effort.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s breadwinner should almost always be abandoned on a fairly
fast schedule. It still may</p>
<p>produce net revenue. But it soon becomes a bar to the introduction
and success of tomorrow’s</p>
<p>breadwin- ner. One should, therefore, abandon yesterday’s breadwinner
before one really wants to,</p>
<p>let alone before one has to.</p>
<p>Altogether, whenever the cost of incremental acquisition is more than
one-half of the likely return,</p>
<p>there is a candidate for abandonment. It is not good enough that an
activity does not</p>
<p>appear to cost any money. It should produce results to be kept
on.</p>
<p>And the hidden costs of any activity are always much greater than
anybody assumes or than any</p>
<p>accounting system shows.</p>
<p>To keep a man on the payroll always costs at least three times his
wage or salary. He needs space</p>
<p>to work in, heat, light, and a locker in the washroom. He needs
materials to work with, supplies, a</p>
<p>telephone, and so on. He needs a supervisor. In a hundred hidden ways
he creates costs.</p>
<p>Every proposal for abandonment is opposed. The arguments that can be
advanced to justify</p>
<p>retention of the resultless, unpromising, and unrewarding are rarely
more than excuses. Most</p>
<p>common is the plea:</p>
<p>• We must grow; we cannot afford to shrink.</p>
<p>But growth, after all, is the result of success, of offering what the
market wants, buys, and pays for,</p>
<p>of using economic resources effectively, and of making the profits
needed for expan- sion and for</p>
<p>the risks of the future. General Motors either aban- doned or
completely made over six of the eight</p>
<p>makes in the line—and the result was tremendous growth.</p>
<p>The argument is also sophistry. It confuses fat with muscle, and
busy-ness with economic</p>
<p>accomplishment. Activities which do not produce results waste
substance. They are a burden—the</p>
<p>way overweight is a burden on the strength of a human being.</p>
<p>A management in an expanding economy needs to be growthconscious. But
growth means exploiting the opportunities</p>
<p>that the economy offers. It does not mean doing the wrong things to
get volume. The volume will</p>
<p>come soon enough if a business concentrates on doing the right
things.</p>
<p>There are in each business products, services, activities, and
efforts which are neither clear</p>
<p>candidates for concentrated major work nor candidates for
abandonment: the large number of</p>
<p>also- rans which form the third category to be considered.</p>
<p>Among them will be today’s breadwinners and frequently the productive
specialties. Here also will</p>
<p>be cost centers which, while representing a sizable cost burden, can
be reduced only by efforts out</p>
<p>of proportion to the probable results. And here will be found the</p>
<p>repair jobs of all kinds and descriptions, the products, services,
markets,</p>
<p>and so on, which might become worth while if only some major change
or modification were made.</p>
<p>The main rule for also-rans is that they must not absorb resources at
the expense of the high</p>
<p>opportunity areas. Only if resources are left over after the high
opportunity areas have received all</p>
<p>the support they need, should the also-rans be con- sidered. And
high-grade resources already</p>
<p>committed to also- rans should be kept there only if they cannot make
a bigger con- tribution in a</p>
<p>high opportunity task.</p>
<p>In practice, additional resources can rarely be spared for also-rans.
And only the productive</p>
<p>specialty among them normally deserves all the resources it employs.
The others will almost always</p>
<p>be found to absorb resources that would be more productive
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also-rans therefore have to make do with what they have— or with
less. They are put on “milking</p>
<p>status”: as long as they yield results, they will be kept—and milked.
They will, however, not be “fed.”</p>
<p>And as soon as these “milk cows” go into rapid decline, they should
be slaughtered.</p>
<p>THE FORWARD PROJECTION</p>
<p>Upgrading the existing business leads to doing things better.</p>
<p>But what are the different things that ought to be done?</p>
<p>Here there are two distinct categories of opportunities:</p>
<p>• Replacements of present products, activities, and efforts which are
almost right, by products,</p>
<p>activities, and efforts that are completely right</p>
<p>• Innovations, the highest-opportunity group, though a small one</p>
<p>Replacements deserve high priority only if a very small change can
convert an almost right product</p>
<p>into one that fits the ideal business design.</p>
<p>What distinguishes a replacement from a development is that it repre-
sents a different idea of</p>
<p>what the market is and what it wants, or a different exploitation of
the company’s knowledge. A</p>
<p>new pack- aging material is a development—no matter how difficult
technologically it might be to</p>
<p>design and to produce it. A new packaging con- cept, shipping on
pallets or in container bodies</p>
<p>which fit on railway flat- cars as well as on highway trucks, is a
new idea and a replacement. In the</p>
<p>General Motors redesign by Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the replacements
were the three cars that were</p>
<p>revamped in everything but name: the old low- priced Chevrolet, the
Oakland (later the Pontiac),</p>
<p>and the Oldsmobile. These cars had customer acceptance and a dealer
organization. They had</p>
<p>the basic design. What they did not have was a clear idea of their
function and place in the market,</p>
<p>the right pricing policy, and management. For a downtown department
store in the United States</p>
<p>the suburban shopping centers were essentially replacements; they
were ways to make the essential strengths of the department store—its
reputation and its merchandis- ing knowledge—available</p>
<p>where the customers shopped.</p>
<p>A replacement should never present great technical difficulty. It
should arise out of the recognition:</p>
<p>“Now we suddenly understand what is wrong with this product, this
market, this activity.</p>
<p>Now we suddenly understand what we have done wrong, or failed to do.”
What changes is much</p>
<p>less the product itself-if it is not almost right one should not
waste time and effort on it—than the</p>
<p>way the business itself sees, presents, and uses the product.</p>
<p>Innovation is the design and development of something new, as yet
unknown and not in existence,</p>
<p>which will establish a new eco- nomic configuration out of the old,
known, existing elements. It will</p>
<p>give these elements an entirely new economic dimension. It is the
missing link between having a</p>
<p>number of disconnected elements, each marginally effective, and an
integrated system of great</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>It is this “systems” aspect of innovation that is invoked when we say
that men like Siemens or</p>
<p>Edison created a new industry. All the elements were there,
except</p>
<p>one. Adding this one new element created an entirely new economic
capacity.</p>
<p>There are many other examples:</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck built its business on the innovation of a “money-
back-and-no-questions-asked”</p>
<p>guarantee to the farm customers. All</p>
<p>the ingredients of a successful mail-order business existed. What was
lack- ing was the simple</p>
<p>element of confidence in the customer.</p>
<p>IBM similarly created the computer industry by innovating the concept
of pro- graming as a distinct</p>
<p>function which bridged the gap between the technically highly complex
machine and the</p>
<p>technically untrained potential customers,</p>
<p>and which yet could be learned by high school graduates in a short
time.</p>
<p>Sloan’s innovation was the idea of an automobile company supplying
the entire market in a planned</p>
<p>and organized fashion where formerly General Motors—and all the
others—had seen themselves as</p>
<p>producers of individual makes each trying to appeal to all the
potential customers.</p>
<p>American Motors innovated the idea of the “compact,” that is the
smallest car</p>
<p>that would still give adequate room and performance to people used to
big cars.</p>
<p>Innovation is not invention or discovery. It may require either—and
often does. But its focus is not</p>
<p>knowledge but per- formance—and in a business this means economic
performance. Its essence is</p>
<p>conceptual rather than technical or scientific. The characteristic of
the innovator is the ability to</p>
<p>envisage as a sys- tem what to others are unrelated, separate
elements. Innovation is not the</p>
<p>better the bigger it is. On the contrary, it is the better the
smaller it can be. It is, to say it again, the</p>
<p>successful attempt to find and to provide the smallest missing part
that will convert already</p>
<p>existing elements—knowledge, products, customer demand, markets—into
a new and much more</p>
<p>productive whole. To find the areas where innovation would create
maximum opportunities, one</p>
<p>asks: What is lacking to make effective what is already possible?
What one small step would</p>
<p>transform our eco- nomic results? What small change would alter the
capacity of thewhole of our</p>
<p>resources?</p>
<p>To describe the need is not to satisfy it. But describing the need
gives a specification for the</p>
<p>desirable results. Whether they are likely to be obtained can then be
decided. Innovation is applicable to finding business potential and to
making the future.</p>
<p>But its first application is as a strategy for making today fully</p>
<p>effective, and for bringing the existing business closer to the ideal
business.</p>

<p>What is lacking to make effective what is already possible?</p>
<p>The characteristic of the innovator is the ability to envisage as a
system</p>
<p>what to others are unrelated, separate elements. It is the successful
at-tempt to</p>
<p>find and to provide the smallest missing part that will convert
al-ready</p>
<p>existing elements. To find areas where innovation would create
maximum</p>
<p>opportunities, one asks: “What is lacking to make effective what is
already</p>
<p>possible? What one small step would transform our economic re-sults?
What</p>
<p>small change would alter the capacity of the whole of our re-</p>

<p>To describe the need is not to satisfy it. But describing the need
