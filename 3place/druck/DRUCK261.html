<p>马云前几天退休了，准确说是卸任了。卸任了阿里巴巴公司的一切职务。除了股权分红一位，和阿里</p>
<p>不再有什么关系。今年马云刚刚过了55岁生日。</p>
<p>马云卸任的原因众说纷纭，最多的就是阴谋论，有人说是zz原因，有人说是身体原因，还有人煞有介</p>
<p>事地说是被人胁迫。甚至有人说马先生激流勇退是明智的，否则性命难保。</p>
<p>毕竟，在中国文化里，马云离开了自己一手创办的阿里巴巴，反复将军离开了自己的军营，皇帝离开</p>
<p>了自己的国土。接下来就会面临任人宰割的状态。</p>
<p>而马云只是说：“今天开始，请叫我马老师”。</p>
<p>11年前，比尔盖茨辞去了微软的主要职务，留任了一个董事长。这一年比尔盖茨53岁，6年后，59岁</p>
<p>的比尔盖茨辞去了董事长职位。也不再参与微软的运营和决策。专注于辞职后的慈善事业。</p>
<p>比尔盖茨为什么辞职呢？网上的给出的理由是：钱赚够了，落个好名声。</p>
<p>比尔盖茨辞职后并没有闲着，运作了一个基金会，还有好几个医疗项目，当然，还有慈善。据相关资</p>
<p>料显示，比尔盖茨目前的资产中，与微软相关的资产只有10per左右。也就是说，离开了微软的比尔盖</p>
<p>茨，资产还是增长了10倍。</p>
<p>桃花岛是黄药师一手创建起来的。郭靖、黄蓉结婚后，黄药师就离开了桃花岛。后来郭靖、黄蓉出去</p>
<p>找老黄，东找没找到，西找没找到，反而找到了杨过。</p>
<p>大家都觉得黄药师是因为孩子闹，不想带孩子才离开的桃花岛。</p>
<p>不过，黄药师自己还是很开心的，听到了杨过的消息，就去找杨过，和杨过交往了几天。听说有人有</p>
<p>可能坑害自己的女儿、女婿，就悄悄跟着看一下，要不是为了救郭芙，估计郭黄都不知道黄药师来</p>
<p>过。</p>
<p>后来，郭靖、黄蓉一直住在襄阳，桃花岛住着柯镇恶还有程英他们，老黄有没有想回去看看？</p>
<p>或许有吧；更或许有人问老黄：“老黄，你花那么大心思搞的桃花岛，变成了柯镇恶的住所，你如何看</p>
<p>呀？”</p>
<p>我想，老黄大概会回答：“我设计了桃花岛，可是并不需要永远住在桃花岛呀！”</p>
<p>“我现在喜欢江湖，喜欢和年轻人聊天，你以为就老顽童会合年轻人拜把子么？我也会。”</p>
<p>“我现在快乐着呢，这是我的江湖。”</p>
<p>是呀，老黄在年轻时修建了桃花岛，并不意味着自己要一辈子守护这个岛呀！</p>
<p>就像比尔盖下创办了微软，并不意味着就要用一辈子守护微软呀！</p>
<p>就像马云创办了阿里巴巴，并不意味着就要用一辈子去守护阿里巴巴呀！</p>
<p>岛是为老黄服务的，老黄的能力就那么一点岛可以圈住么？我才50多岁呀，我的人生还长着呢，桃花</p>
<p>岛早就住腻了。</p>
<p>微软成就了比尔盖茨，我老比就这么点成就么？我才50多岁呀，IT干腻了，我想做的事情多这呢……</p>
<p>阿里巴巴成就了马云，我马云就这么点成就么？电商干腻了，我老马的未来长着呢……</p>
<p>人活着越来越长，以前的人，一辈子只够做一件事。江湖人的人，好容易搭一个三分地的帐篷，恨不</p>
<p>得绑在自己身上，好像一辈子就这么过了。</p>
<p>可是，那些内外兼修的人，生命是很长的，哪是一个小岛可以困住的？</p>
<p>老顽童头发花白后，跑到百花谷养蜂为乐，这一玩就是十几年。</p>
<p>一灯在几个弟子陪伴下修行几年后，果断渡了一个裘千仞来玩，硬是把一个裘千仞渡成了慈恩。送走</p>
<p>慈恩后，一灯又去和老顽童做邻居了，毕竟，老顽童也是个有趣的人。</p>
<p>现在的人活的越来越久了。你要让55岁的马云在阿里再干50年么？</p>
<p>你要让比尔盖茨在微软再干50年么？</p>
<p>阿里、微软，都是凡人不可企及的辉煌。可是，对于他们来说，那只是人生的一个阶段，人生的前半</p>
<p>场。虽然很辉煌。</p>
<p>人生的下半场还是要开始，或许更辉煌，或许更悠闲，谁知道呢。</p>
<p>我知道的只是，我要结束上半场了。</p>
<p>“今天开始，请叫我马老师，谢谢”</p>

<p>Managing Oneself: The Second Half</p>
<p>What to do with the second half of one’s life?</p>
<p>Knowledge workers are able physically to keep on working into old
age, and well beyond any</p>
<p>traditional retirement age. But they run a new risk: they may become
mentally finished.</p>
<p>mentally：</p>
<p>精神上；智力上；思想上</p>
<p>connected with or happening in the mind</p>
<p>What’s commonly called “burnout,” the most common affliction of the
fortysomething knowledge</p>
<p>worker, is very rarely the result of stress.</p>
<p>Its common, all too common, cause is boredom on the job.</p>
<p>In one big and highly successful company top management said to me:
“Our engineers are slacking</p>
<p>off. Can you try to find out why?” And so I talked to about a dozen
very competent, very</p>
<p>successful, very well paid people in engineering.</p>
<p>And they all said: “My job is important to the success of the
company. I like it. I have done it now for</p>
<p>about ten years and I am very good at it and I am very proud of it.
But I can do it now in my sleep. It</p>
<p>no longer challenges me. I am just plain bored. I no longer look
forward to coming into the office</p>
<p>every morning.”</p>
<p>Yet the obvious answer, that is to rotate people, would have been the
wrong answer.</p>
<p>These people are topflight specialists.</p>
<p>What they needed was to regain some true interest.</p>
<p>And once they had that—one of them, for instance, started to tutor
high school students in math</p>
<p>and science—suddenly their work, too, became again satisfying.</p>

<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Second Half of Your Life</p>
<p>As said before: For the first time in human history, individuals can
expect to outlive organizations. This creates</p>
<p>a totally new challenge: What to do with the second half of one’s
life?</p>
<p>One can no longer expect that the organization for which one works at
age thirty will still be around when one</p>
<p>reaches age sixty. But also, forty or fifty years in the same kind of
work is much too long for most people. They</p>
<p>deteriorate, get bored, lose all joy in their work, “retire on the
job” and become a burden to themselves and to</p>
<p>everyone around them.</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>deteriorate [ V ] ~ (into sth) to become worse</p>
<p>变坏；恶化；退化</p>
<p>：the ~ (of sth) | a ~ (on/to sb) a duty, responsibility, etc. that
causes worry, difficulty or hard</p>
<p>work （义务、责任等的）重担，负担</p>
<p>burden</p>
<p>This is not necessarily true of the very top achievers such as very
great artists. Claude Monet (1840–</p>
<p>1926), the greatest Impressionist painter, was still painting
masterpieces in his eighties, and working twelve</p>
<p>hours a day, even though he had lost almost all his eyesight. Pablo
Picasso (1881–1973), perhaps the greatest</p>
<p>Post-Impressionist painter, similarly painted till he died in his
nineties—and in his seventies invented a new</p>
<p>style. The greatest musical instrumentalist of this century, the
Spanish cellist Pablo Casals (1876–1973),</p>
<p>planned to perform a new piece of music and practiced it on the very
day on which he died at age ninety-seven.</p>
<p>But these are the rarest of exceptions even among very great
achievers. Neither Max Planck (1858–1947) nor</p>
<p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the two giants of modern physics, did
important scientific work after their forties.</p>
<p>Planck had two more careers. After 1918—aged sixty—he reorganized
German science. After</p>
<p>being forced into retirement by the Nazis in 1933, he, in 1945,
almost ninety, started once more to rebuild</p>
<p>German science after Hitler’s fall. But Einstein retired in his
forties to become a “famous man.”</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about the “mid-life</p>
<p>crisis” of the executive. It is mostly boredom. At age forty-five
most executives have reached the peak of their</p>
<p>busi-ness career and know it. After twenty years of doing very much
the same kind of work, they are good at</p>
<p>their jobs. But few are learning anything anymore, few are
contributing anything anymore and few expect the</p>
<p>job again to become a challenge and a satisfaction.</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>boredom</p>
<p>[ U ] the state of feeling bored; the quality of being very
boring</p>
<p>厌烦；厌倦；无聊</p>
<p>Manual workers who have been working for forty years—in the steel
mill for instance, or in the cab of a</p>
<p>locomotive—are physically and mentally tired long before they reach
the end of their normal life expectancy,</p>
<p>that is, well before they reach even traditional retirement age. They
are “finished.” If they survive— and their</p>
<p>life expectancy too has gone up to an average of seven ty-five years
or so—they are quite happy spending ten or</p>
<p>fifteen years doing nothing, playing golf, going fishing, engaging in
some minor hobby and so on. But</p>
<p>knowledge workers are not “finished.” They are perfectly capable of
functioning despite all</p>
<p>kinds of minor complaints. And yet the original work that was so</p>
<p>challenging when the knowledge worker was thirty has become a deadly
bore when the knowledge worker is</p>
<p>fifty—and still he or she is likely to face another fifteen if not
another twenty years of work.</p>
<p>To manage oneself, therefore, will increasingly require preparing
oneself for the second half of one’s life. (The</p>
<p>best books on this subject are by Bob Buford—a very successful busi-
nessman who himself has created his</p>
<p>own second half of life. They are Half Time [Grand Rapids: Zondervan,
1994] and Game Plan [Grand Rapids:</p>
<p>Zondervan, 1997].)</p>
<p>There are three answers:</p>
<p>The first is actually to start a second and different career (as</p>
<p>Max Planck did). Often this means only moving from one kind of an
organization to another.</p>
<p>Typical are the middle-level American business executives who in
substantial numbers move to a hospital, a</p>
<p>university or some other nonprofit organization, around age
forty-five or forty-eight, when the children are</p>
<p>grown and the retirement pension is vested. In many cases they stay
in the</p>
<p>same kind of work. The divisional controller in the big corporation
becomes, for instance, controller in a</p>
<p>medium-sized hospital. But there are also a growing number of people
who actually move into a different line</p>
<p>of work. Increasingly, for instance, students in American Protestant
theological seminaries are forty-five—</p>
<p>rather than twenty-five—years old. They made a first career in
business or government—some in medicine—</p>
<p>and then, when the chil-dren are grown, move into the ministry. And
so did a friend of mine who, after thirty</p>
<p>years as a successful art museum director and curator, entered a
seminary at age 55.</p>
<p>In the United States there is a fairly substantial number of
middle-aged women who have worked for twenty</p>
<p>years, in busi- ness or in local government, have risen to a junior
management position and now, at age fortyfive and with the children
grown, enter law school. Three or four years later they then establish
themselves as</p>
<p>small-time lawyers in their local communities.</p>
<p>We will see much more of such second-career people who have achieved
fair success in their first job. These</p>
<p>people have substantial skills, for example, the divisional
controller who moves into the local community</p>
<p>hospital. They know how to work. They need a community—and the house
is empty with the children gone.</p>
<p>They need the income, too. But above all, they need the
challenge.</p>
<p>The Parallel Career</p>
<p>The second answer to the question of what to do with the sec- ond
half of one’s life is to develop a</p>
<p>parallel career.</p>
<p>A large and rapidly growing number of people—especially people who
are very successful in their first careers</p>
<p>—stay in the work they have been doing for twenty or twenty-five
years. Many</p>
<p>keep on working forty or fifty hours a week in their main and paid
job. Some move from busy full-time to</p>
<p>being part-time employ- ees or become consultants. But then they
create for themselves a parallel job—usually</p>
<p>in a nonprofit organization—and one that often takes another ten
hours of work a week. They take over the</p>
<p>administration of their church, for instance, or the presidency of
the local Girl Scouts Council, they run the</p>
<p>battered women shel- ter, they work for the local public library as
children’s librarian, they sit on the local</p>
<p>school board and so on.</p>
<p>And then, finally, the third answer—there are the “social
entrepreneurs.” These are usually people who</p>
<p>have been very successful in their first profession, as businessmen,
as physicians,</p>
<p>as consultants, as university professors. They love their work, but
it no longer challenges them. In many cases</p>
<p>they keep on doing what they have been doing all along, though they
spend less and less of their time on it. But</p>
<p>they start another, and usually a non- profit, activity.</p>
<p>Here are some examples—beginning with Bob Buford, the</p>
<p>author of the two books, mentioned above, about preparing for the
second half of one’s life. Having built a very</p>
<p>suc-cessful television and radio business, Buford still keeps on
running it. But he first started and built a</p>
<p>successful non-profit organization to make the Protestant churches in
America capable of survival; now he is</p>
<p>building a second, equally successful organization to teach other
social entrepreneurs how to manage their own</p>
<p>private, nonprofit ventures while still running their original
businesses. But there is also the equally successful</p>
<p>lawyer—legal counsel to a big corporation—who has started a venture
to estab- lish model schools in his state.</p>
<p>People who manage the “second half” may always be a minor- ity only.
The majority may keep doing what they</p>
<p>are doing now, that is, to retire on the job, being bored, keeping on
with their</p>
<p>routine and counting the years until retirement. But it will be
this</p>
<p>minority, the people who see the long working-life expectancy as an
opportunity both for themselves and for</p>
<p>society, who may increasingly become the leaders and the models.
They, increas- ingly, will be the</p>
<p>“success stories.”</p>
<p>There is one requirement for managing the second half of one’s life:
to begin creating it long before one enters</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>When it first became clear thirty years ago that working- life
expectancies were lengthening very fast, many</p>
<p>observers (including myself) believed that retired people would
increasingly become volunteers for American</p>
<p>non- profit institutions. This has not happened. If one does not
begin to volunteer before one is forty or so, one</p>
<p>will not volunteer when past sixty.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their
chosen second enterprise long before they</p>
<p>reached their peak in their original business. The lawyer mentioned
above</p>
<p>began to do volunteer legal work for the schools in his state when he
was around thirty-five. He got himself</p>
<p>elected to a school board at age forty. When he reached fifty, and
had amassed a sub- stantial fortune, he then</p>
<p>started his own enterprise to build and run model schools. He is,
however, still working near-full-time as the</p>
<p>lead counsel in the very big company that, as a very young lawyer, he
had helped found.</p>
<p>There is another reason that managing yourself will increas- ingly
mean that the knowledge worker develops a</p>
<p>second major interest, and develops it early.</p>
<p>No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious
setback in one’s life or in one’s work.</p>
<p>There is the competent engineer who at age forty-two is being passed
over for promotion in the company. There</p>
<p>is the competent college professor who at age forty-two realizes that
she will stay forever in the small college in which</p>
<p>she got her first appointment and will never get the profes- sorship
at the big university—even though she may</p>
<p>be fully qualified for it. There are tragedies in one’s personal
family life—the breakup of one’s marriage, the</p>
<p>loss of a child.</p>
<p>And then a second major interest—and not just another hobby—may make
all the difference. The competent</p>
<p>engineer passed over for promotion now knows that he has not been
very successful in his job. But in his</p>
<p>outside activity—for example, as treasurer in his local church—he has
achieved success and con- tinues to have</p>
<p>success. One’s own family may break up, but in that outside activity
there is still a community.</p>
<p>This will be increasingly important in a society in which suc- cess
has become important.</p>
<p>Historically there was no such thing. The overwhelming majority of
people did not expect anything but to stay</p>
<p>in their “proper station,” as an old English prayer has it. The only
mobility there was downward mobility.</p>
<p>Success was practically unknown.</p>
<p>In a knowledge society we expect everyone to be a “success.”</p>
<p>But this is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people
there</p>
<p>is, at best, absence of failure. For where there is success, there
has to be failure. And then it is vitally important</p>
<p>for the individual— but equally for the individual’s family—that
there be an area in which the individual</p>
<p>contributes, makes a difference, and is somebody. That means having a
second area, whether a second career, a</p>
<p>parallel career, a social venture, a serious outside inter- est, all
of them offering an opportunity for being a</p>
<p>leader, for being respected, for being a success.</p>
<p>The changes and challenges of Managing Oneself may seem obvious, if
not elementary, compared to the</p>
<p>changes and chal- lenges discussed in the earlier chapters. And the
answers may seem to be self-</p>
<p>evident to the point of appearing naïve. To be sure, many topics in
the earlier chapters—</p>
<p>for example, Being a Change</p>
<p>Leader or some of the Information Challenges—are far more complex and
require more advanced and more</p>
<p>difficult policies, technologies, methodologies. But most of the new
behavior—the new policies, technologies,</p>
<p>methodologies—called for in these earlier chapters can be considered
EVOLUTIONS.</p>
<p>Managing Oneself is a REVOLUTION in human affairs. It requires new
and unprecedented things from the</p>
<p>individual, and especially from the knowledge worker. For in effect
it demands that each knowledge worker</p>
<p>think and behave as a Chief Executive Officer. It also requires an
almost 180-degree change in the knowledge</p>
<p>workers’ thoughts and actions from what most of us—even of the
younger generation—still take for granted as</p>
<p>the way to think and the way to act. Knowledge workers, after
all,</p>
<p>first came into being in any substantial numbers a generation
ago.</p>
<p>(I coined the term “knowledge worker,” but only thirty years ago, in
my 1969 book The Age of Discontinuity.)</p>
<p>But also the shift from manual workers who do as they are being
told—either by the task or by the boss—</p>
<p>to knowledge workers who have to manage themselves profoundly
challenges social structure. For every</p>
<p>existing society, even the most “individualist” one, takes two things
for granted, if only subconsciously:</p>
<p>Organizations out- live workers, and most people stay put. Managing
Oneself is based on the very opposite</p>
<p>realities: Workers are likely to outlive organi- zations, and the
knowledge worker has mobility.</p>
<p>In the United States MOBILITY is accepted. But even in the United
States, workers outliving organizations—</p>
<p>and with it the need to be prepared for a Second and Different Half
of One’s Life—is a revolution for which</p>
<p>practically no one is prepared. Nor is any existing institution, for
example, the present retire- ment system. In</p>
<p>the rest of the developed world, however, immo- bility is expected
and accepted. It is “stability.”</p>
<p>In Germany, for instance, mobility—until very recently— came to an
end with the individual’s reaching age ten</p>
<p>or, at the latest, age sixteen. If a child did not enter Gymnasium at
age ten, he or she had lost any chance ever to</p>
<p>go to the university. And the apprenticeship that the great majority
who did not go to the Gymnasium entered</p>
<p>at age fifteen or sixteen as a mechanic, a bank clerk, a
cook—irrevocably and irreversibly—decided what work</p>
<p>the person was going to do the rest of his or her life. Moving from
the occupation of one’s apprenticeship into</p>
<p>another occupation was simply not done even when not actually
forbidden.</p>
<p>The developed society that faces the greatest challenge and will have
to make the most difficult changes is the</p>
<p>society that has been most successful in the last fifty years: Japan.
Japan’s success—and there is no precedent</p>
<p>for it in history—very large- ly rested on organized immobility—the
immobility of “lifetime employment.” In</p>
<p>lifetime employment it is the organization that</p>
<p>manages the individual. And it does so, of course, on the assump-
tion that the individual has no choice. The</p>
<p>individual is being managed.</p>
<p>I very much hope that Japan will find a solution that preserves the
social stability, the community—and the</p>
<p>social harmony— that lifetime employment provided, and yet creates
the mobility that knowledge work and</p>
<p>knowledge workers must have. Far more is at stake than Japan’s own
society and civic harmony. A</p>
<p>Japanese solution would provide a model—for in every country a
functioning society does require cohesion.</p>
<p>Still, a successful Japan will be a very different Japan.</p>
<p>But so will be every other developed country. The emergence</p>
<p>of the knowledge worker who both can and must manage himself or
herself is transforming every society.</p>
<p>This book has intentionally confined itself to MANAGE- MENT
CHALLENGES. Even in this last chapter, it</p>
<p>has talked about the individual, that is, the knowledge worker. But
the changes discussed in this book go way</p>
<p>beyond management. They go way beyond the individual and his or her
career. What this book actually dealt</p>
<p>with is:</p>
<p>THE FUTURE OF SOCIETY.</p>

<h3 id="managing-oneself-the-second-half">Managing Oneself: The Second
Half</h3>
<p>What to do with the second half of one’s life?</p>
<p>Knowledge workers are able physically to keep on working into old
age, and</p>
<p>well beyond any traditional retirement age. But they run a new</p>
<p>risk: they may become mentally finished. What’s commonly called</p>
<p>“burnout,” the most common affliction of the fortysomething
knowledge</p>
<p>worker, is very rarely the result of stress. Its common, all too
common,</p>
<p>cause is boredom on the job.</p>
<p>In one big and highly successful company top management said to
me:</p>
<p>“Our engineers are slacking off. Can you try to find out why?” And so
I</p>
<p>talked to about a dozen very competent, very successful, very well
paid</p>
<p>people in engineering. And they all said: “My job is important to the
suc-</p>
<p>cess of the company. I like it. I have done it now for about ten
years and I</p>
<p>am very good at it and I am very proud of it. But I can do it now in
my</p>
<p>sleep. It no longer challenges me. I am just plain bored. I no longer
look</p>
<p>forward to coming into the office every morning.” Yet the obvious</p>
<p>answer, that is to rotate people, would have been the wrong answer.
These</p>
<p>people are topflight specialists. What they needed was to regain some
true</p>
<p>interest. And once they had that—one of them, for instance, started
to</p>
<p>tutor high school students in math and science—suddenly their work,
too,</p>
<p>became again satisfying.</p>
