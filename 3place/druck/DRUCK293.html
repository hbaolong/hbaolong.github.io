<p>你有“fuck you money”么？</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>今天早上看到一个视频，是一个叫刘玉玲的女生面对采访时说的话：</p>
<p>【插入图片】</p>
<p>“我父亲教过我一件事，一切的本质都是生意。所以我为了赚钱努力工作，就是为了有一笔‘Fuck</p>
<p>You’的钱。这笔钱就是用在我不想被别人逼着做一件事，或者被人炒掉，我可以把钱甩出来，老娘有</p>
<p>钱，老娘不在乎，Fuck You！”</p>
<p>【插入视频】</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>这是一个商业时代，在这个时代，一切都是商业的，规则简单透明。虽然也有“潜规则”，商业规则还</p>
<p>是主流，只要准从商业规则，则可以让自己生活的很开心。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>在这个时代，每个人都要参与商业活动，也就是说要赚钱。因为，只有赚钱，你才可以生活；也就</p>
<p>说，只要赚钱，你就可以生活，而且生活的不错。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>赚钱的方式很多，而且越来越多。以前是三百六十行，现在是三千六百行都不止。幸运的是，你做哪</p>
<p>一行都可以赚钱，而且，只要你足够专业，你都可以过上中等的生活。</p>
<p>做工人可以，做农民也可以，做医生也可以，做保险业务员也可以，做银行的理财顾问也可以，做心</p>
<p>理咨询师也可以，帮人介绍工作也可以，帮人跑腿也可以，帮人出主意也可以。</p>
<p>几乎你能想到的动脑、动手、动身体的任何行为，都可以赚到钱。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>前提是你要专业，也就是，你要在某一个领域用心。这就需要你在一个行业内的沉淀。对于保险业务</p>
<p>员来说，你需要了解一类保单细节，需要了解一类人的细节，需要了解用户的需求，需要了解每一个</p>
<p>保单的底层逻辑，它们解决的问题以及客户购买时的心理历程。</p>
<p>如果你在卖课，卖一些线上的付费课程。你需要了解这个课程的内容，需要了解这个课程的目标群</p>
<p>体，需要了解目标群体的需求，以及购买时的心理历程，以及购买后的期望。</p>
<p>如果你在做咨询，你要多看一些书，了解一些理论，你要多接触客户，了解客户的实际情况，你还要</p>
<p>了解现实的环境，了解对应行业的发展，最后，你要给出客户可选的建议。这些都需要你花费很大的</p>
<p>精力。</p>
<p>只要你专业，你就可以做的比别人好，只要你足够用心，任何一个行业都可以让你赚到你需要的钱。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>或许你觉得另一个行业可以赚跟多的钱，你可以尝试，可以了解，甚至可以进入。不过，如果你的目</p>
<p>的是赚钱，那么你要知道，当你把精力分散到一个新的行业时，你的旧的行业的收入就会减少，整体</p>
<p>大体差不多。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>当然，也有可能会多一些。</p>
<p>问题是，你是一个人，一个来这个世界上生活的人。这是一个美好的时代，这是商业时代，在这个时</p>
<p>代，你需要的是找到一个商业机会用来赚钱，赚到钱后，你就可以按自己期望的方式生活了。</p>
<p>赚钱并不是你的目的，生活才是。对于赚钱这件事来说，你只需要在一到两个行业就好了。至于其他</p>
<p>的，你应该是“消费”。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>在自己的领域，在自己的行业，你应该非常用心，努力、全心全力地区赚钱，这个努力，不管如果做</p>
<p>都是正常的。既然你是理财顾问，那就去了解财富运行的所有机制，那就去了解这个时代你的客户群</p>
<p>里的财富获取、使用情况，让自己变得非常专业。在这个行业之外，那里有一笔不错的钱，对不起，</p>
<p>我不要。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>一切都是生意，一切又都是生活。我有我的领域，我有我的专业，我在我的专业赚钱。其他领域，我</p>
<p>是消费者。当我不开心时，我可以说“fuck you”，而这个“fuck
you”的能力就来自你的“fuck you</p>
<p>money”，来自你专业的积累。</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>你可能很自豪自己可以在几个领域赚到钱，问题是，你真的希望自己的钱被分的那么碎么？你有没有</p>
<p>想过，你一天中，有多少时间在“赚钱”，多少时间在“生活”？</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>对于职业之外的事情，你有能力说“fuck
you”么？你有没有想过？你之所以被职业外的事情诱惑，只是</p>
<p>因为你的职业不够专业。</p>
<p>少林方丈玄慈对本寺的七十二绝技也有过描述：“各位大师，敝寺虽有七十二项绝技，但一来每一项功</p>
<p>法均极难练，纵是天资卓异之人，一生亦不易练成一项，何况各项绝技练到精处高处，总之不过在武</p>
<p>学上胜人一筹而已，既能以甲门功夫胜人，便不必再以乙门功夫胜人，至于丙门、丁门，更加不必去</p>
<p>练了。”</p>
<p>十二</p>
<p>你有职业么？你在你的职业专业么？你的职业可以给你“fuck you money
”么？还是你不得不被各种行</p>
<p>业，各种碎钱“fuck”？</p>

<p>Moving Beyond Capitalism?</p>
<p>This interview was conducted by Nathan Gardels, editor of New
Perspectives Quarterly, in the</p>
<p>author’s</p>
<p>office in Claremont, California. It was based on the author’s
specifying the topics and the interv</p>
<p>iewer’s</p>
<p>questions. The author himself edited the interviewer’s draft into the
final text. The interview ap</p>
<p>peared in New Perspectives Quarterly in the spring 1998 issue.</p>
<p>Of late, some of capitalism’s biggest boosters, people such as
yourself and the financier George</p>
<p>Soros, have become its biggest critics.</p>
<p>What is your critique?</p>
<p>I am for the free market. Even though it doesn’t work too well,
nothing else</p>
<p>works at all. But I have serious reservations about capitalism as a
system because</p>
<p>it idolizes economics as the be-all and end-all of life. It is
one-dimensional.</p>
<p>For example, I have often advised managers that a 20–1 salary ratio
is the</p>
<p>limit beyond which they cannot go if they don’t want resentment and
falling morale to hit</p>
<p>their companies. I worried back in the 1930s that the great</p>
<p>inequality generated by the Industrial Revolution would result in so
much despair</p>
<p>that something like fascism would take hold. Unfortunately, I was
right.</p>
<p>Today, I believe it is socially and morally unforgivable when
managers reap huge profits for</p>
<p>themselves but fire workers. As societies, we will pay a heavy price
for the contempt this generates</p>
<p>among the middle managers and workers.</p>
<p>In short, whole dimensions of what it means to be a human being and
treated as one are not</p>
<p>incorporated into the economic calculus of capitalism. For such a</p>
<p>myopic system to dominate other aspects of life is not good for any
society.</p>
<p>With regard to the market, there are several serious problems with
the theory itself.</p>
<p>First of all, the theory assumes there is one homogeneous market. In
reality,</p>
<p>there are three overlapping markets that, by and large, don’t
interchange: an international</p>
<p>market in money and information, national markets, and local
markets.</p>
<p>Most of what passes for transnational economic money, of course, is
only virtual money.</p>
<p>The London interbank market each day has a greater volume of activity
in</p>
<p>dollar terms than the whole world would need for a year to finance
all economic transactions.</p>
<p>This is functionless money. It cannot possibly earn any return since
it serves no function. It has no</p>
<p>purchasing power. It is, therefore, totally speculative and prone to
panics as it rushes here and</p>
<p>there to earn that last 64th of 1 percent.</p>
<p>Then, there is a large national economy which is not exposed to
international commerce. Some 24</p>
<p>percent of U.S. economic activity is exposed to trade. In Japan, it
is only 8 percent.</p>
<p>Then there is the local economy. The hospital near my home has very
high- quality care and is very</p>
<p>competitive. But it does not compete with any hospital forty miles
away in Los Angeles. The</p>
<p>effective market area for hospitals in the</p>
<p>U.S. is about ten miles because, for some obscure reason no economist
would be</p>
<p>able to figure out, people like to be close to their sick
mothers.</p>
<p>Also, what drives markets has changed. The economic center of gravity
shifted sometime during</p>
<p>this century. In the nineteenth century, with steel and</p>
<p>steam, supply generated demand. Since the Great Depression, however,
the tables have turned: In</p>
<p>traditional products, from home construction to cars, demand must
come before supply—</p>
<p>although this is not yet true today of information and electronics,
which stimulate demand.</p>
<p>Beyond this definition of markets, the truly profound issue is that
market theory is based on an</p>
<p>assumption of equilibrium and thus cannot accommodate change, let
alone innovation.</p>
<p>Rather, the real pattern of economic activity, as Joseph
Schumpeter</p>
<p>recognized as long ago as 1911, is “a moving disequilibrium” caused
by the process of</p>
<p>creative destruction as new markets with new products and new demand
are made at the</p>
<p>expense of old ones.</p>
<p>Market outcomes cannot, therefore, be explained in terms of what the
theory would have</p>
<p>predicted. The market is in fact not a predictable system, but
inherently unstable. And if it is not</p>
<p>predictable, you cannot base your behavior</p>
<p>on it. That is a pretty serious limitation for a theory of human
behavior.</p>
<p>All we can say is that, in the end, any long-term equilibrium is the
result of a lot of short-term</p>
<p>adaptations to market signals.</p>
<p>This, finally, is the strength of the market: It is a disciplinarian
for the short</p>
<p>term. By providing feedback through prices, it discourages you from
squandering</p>
<p>time and resources going off in all directions like King Arthur’s
knights.</p>
<p>The old idea was that if you rode on long enough you would run
into</p>
<p>something. The market tells you that if you don’t run into something
in five</p>
<p>weeks, you better change course or do something else.</p>
<p>Beyond the short term, the market is useless. You know, I have sat in
on more than my share of</p>
<p>research planning for large companies. Fundamentally, this</p>
<p>activity is an act of faith. When the chief financial officer asks,
as he always does,</p>
<p>“What will be the return?” on this or that project, the only answer
is “We will know in ten years.”</p>
<p>Years ago you wrote about pension fund ownership of the American
economy, calling it “capitalism</p>
<p>sans capitalists” where workers’ retirement funds own the means of
production.</p>
<p>Today, this dispersion of wealth has gone even further through the
explosion of mutual funds—</p>
<p>more than 51 percent of Americans own shares of stock.</p>
<p>Have we arrived at mass capitalism or postcapitalism?</p>
<p>Well, to call it postcapitalism is merely to say we don’t know what
to call it.</p>
<p>You also can’t call it economic democracy since there is no organized
form of governance</p>
<p>associated with this mass ownership.</p>
<p>What is certain is that it is a totally new phenomenon in
history.</p>
<p>My gardener, who is not a wealthy man, takes the “money markets”
section</p>
<p>of the Wall Street Journal I put out for him at the back door every
week to guide his</p>
<p>stock investments.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who works with a regional financial service that has
2</p>
<p>million accounts told me recently that his average investor has gone
from putting</p>
<p>0,000 per year to 5,000 per year in his mutual fund.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is becoming true that capitalists don’t matter anymore. In
earlier periods of the adoration</p>
<p>of the rich, there were strongly voiced opinions either</p>
<p>that “we need the rich for capital formation” or “the rich are just
exploiting us</p>
<p>all.” One doesn’t hear either of these opinions anymore.</p>
<p>J. P. Morgan once mattered to the American economy. At his peak, he
had enough liquid capital to</p>
<p>finance all capital needs in America for four months.</p>
<p>Adjusting for inflation, J. P. Morgan probably had a little less than
a third of what Bill Gates has</p>
<p>today. Such wealth possessed by one man has not been seen</p>
<p>in the world since the time of the great Khan of China. But Gates’s 0
billion</p>
<p>could only finance the American economy for less than one day.</p>
<p>Bill Gates is important because of the Microsoft company he built and
the</p>
<p>software we use. As a rich man, he is totally irrelevant. How he
spends or wastes his money will</p>
<p>have no impact on the American economy. It is a drop in the
bucket.</p>
<p>The wealth that makes the difference in America today is that held by
tens of millions of</p>
<p>small investors.</p>
<p>Historically, state socialism has failed to produce wealth or
efficiently provide social services. Yet</p>
<p>capitalism ignores any other dimension of life besides economic
exchange. And, as you say, the</p>
<p>market is only short-term. How does society, then, manage in the long
term?</p>
<p>We now know that we need three sectors, not two. Not just government
and business, but what</p>
<p>people now call the civil society or third sector in between.</p>
<p>Indeed, I believe that the realistic alternative to the socialist
delusion on one</p>
<p>hand, and the pure market on the other, combines the dispersed
ownership of the</p>
<p>economy through pension and mutual funds with a “third” nonprofit
sector to</p>
<p>cope with community needs from health care to tutoring students.</p>
<p>The idea that some of my Republican friends have that we can do
without government is just silly. It</p>
<p>is an understandable reaction because of the postwar belief that
government could take care of all</p>
<p>community needs.</p>
<p>But we have learned that government, like any other tool, is good for
some</p>
<p>things but not good for others. It is important, for example, for
collective defense</p>
<p>and for raising the financial means for infrastructure through
taxes.</p>
<p>But, just as I am unlikely to do well trying to cut my toenails with
a hammer, government is</p>
<p>incompetent at fulfilling community needs. Everything a state does,
it has to do on a national level.</p>
<p>It cannot experiment or adapt to the local conditions of a
community.</p>
<p>The state tends to define a problem in a standard way and then
monopolizes</p>
<p>the solution. But what works in St. Louis usually doesn’t work even
in Kansas City, let alone New</p>
<p>York or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>With its singular profit motive, of course, the market simply has no
interest or capacity to cope with</p>
<p>social problems.</p>
<p>Though people think of me mainly as a management consultant for
business, I have spent much of</p>
<p>my time for fifty years consulting for nonprofit</p>
<p>organizations. Fifteen years ago, there were only three hundred
thousand taxexempt nonprofit groups registered with the IRS, including
such well-known groups as the</p>
<p>American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. Now
there are over 1 million.</p>
<p>I also helped set up a foundation for nonprofit management, run by
the former national executive of</p>
<p>the Girl Scouts. The idea was simple: These organizations are not so
much mismanaged as</p>
<p>unmanaged. Without market discipline, they need a focused mission and
a results orientation as</p>
<p>their bottom line.</p>
<p>One of the problems our foundation has had is the overwhelming demand
from countries as</p>
<p>diverse as Japan, Brazil, Argentina, and Poland. They all need social
sector institutions desperately</p>
<p>—from the establishment of nursing</p>
<p>associations to battered women’s shelters to crop education for
peasants in places like Patagonia.</p>
<p>Why is the social sector growing in Japan, where the community has
been so strong?</p>
<p>Well, two things are happening. First, the traditional community
structure is</p>
<p>crumbling. Second, educated women who have worked for a few years,
then left</p>
<p>work to have children, who then go off to school, are bored.</p>
<p>What kind of social problems does Japan have? When you reach
fifty-five</p>
<p>years of age in Japan, you are essentially thrown on the dung
heap—even though you will probably</p>
<p>live thirty years longer. So, the elderly organize clubs, from</p>
<p>sports to ikebana flower arranging, to keep themselves occupied.</p>
<p>One of the most successful new social sector groups in Japan engages
in that most unJapanese of activities: “meals on wheels” for the elderly
who can’t get out.</p>
<p>Young people don’t take care of the elderly anymore. Yet, the
government fought the</p>
<p>establishment of the meals-on-wheels program because it meant
they</p>
<p>had to admit their old people were not doing so well. Indeed, this is
a blot on the Japanese honor.</p>
<p>But it is a fact.</p>
<p>There is also a tremendous need among teenagers and schoolage
children to drive them to and</p>
<p>from school, to supervise homework, and tutor those who do not make
the top grades.</p>
<p>Nobody outside Japan seems to know that while 20 percent of
Japanese</p>
<p>students excel, the rest who don’t are simply forgotten. The social
sector tries to provide for these</p>
<p>kids.</p>
<p>There are also conversation and reading classes in English for
Japanese women who learned a little</p>
<p>in high school or at work and want to maintain it. There are now over
185,000 of these circles, even</p>
<p>in small towns.</p>
<p>In Japan now there is even an Alcoholics Anonymous Association. I
don’t know how big they</p>
<p>are so far, but sometimes it seems every salaryman in the country
could become a member.</p>
<p>In the U.S., though, the size of the social problems means they just
can’t be taken care of by</p>
<p>voluntary associations, can they?</p>
<p>Perhaps not entirely. But the scope of activities is just tremendous.
More than</p>
<p>50 percent of Americans work at least four hours a week in a
voluntary association of some sort, in</p>
<p>the church or the community.</p>
<p>And the solutions to community problems they come up with are highly
creative. I have come over</p>
<p>the years to learn a very important lesson: Practical examples of how
to solve social problems</p>
<p>matter greatly because others will replicate them.</p>
<p>To this end, each year the Drucker Foundation gives a prize to a
voluntary association to highlight</p>
<p>their example so they can be replicated.</p>
<p>One year, we gave the prize to a very small group run by an immigrant
who</p>
<p>found a way to bring together the worst, most unproductive welfare
mothers and the most</p>
<p>seriously disabled children. This led to a situation where the
disabled were cared for and, in time,</p>
<p>the welfare mothers became qualified to be fully employed and well
paid.</p>
<p>There is another project we highlighted by a Lutheran church in
St. Louis. In</p>
<p>their area, they found that about two-fifths of the homeless, mostly
families, need</p>
<p>very little to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>The first thing the church did was assess what homeless families
needed most. The answer</p>
<p>was self-respect.</p>
<p>So the members of the congregation would buy dilapidated houses and
find volunteers to refurbish</p>
<p>them into comfortable middle-class homes. Then they</p>
<p>moved the homeless family in. That by itself changed their outlook on
life. Then</p>
<p>designated church members would help the family with their bills and
in finding work. In the end,</p>
<p>about 80 percent of the families in their program went permanently
off any kind of assistance.</p>
<p>Then there are organizations such as the Girl Scouts that are
reaching new levels of participation. A</p>
<p>few years ago they were down to about five hundred thousand
volunteers. Today they are up to</p>
<p>about nine hundred thousand.</p>
<p>The old volunteer was usually a middle-class housewife bored at home.
The new volunteer is more</p>
<p>often than not a professional woman who has postponed</p>
<p>having children, but likes to be with girls on the weekend after
having worked all week in a</p>
<p>male environment.</p>
<p>For most of the last twenty-five years, I have worked with the
fast-growing Protestant</p>
<p>megachurches in the U.S., which I believe are one of the most</p>
<p>significant social phenomena in the world today. They teach community
activism and encourage</p>
<p>people to live their faith by taking action to improve the lives of
others.</p>
<p>While the traditional churches may be dying in some ways, in others
they are being transformed.</p>
<p>Take the Catholic Church in America. Pope John Paul II has been very
careful</p>
<p>to place conservative bishops in the American church because it
frightens him. It is not so much</p>
<p>the theological problems, married priests, and ordained women that
bother him, but the enormous</p>
<p>upsurge of activity in the dioceses that is laydriven and not
controlled by the bishop.</p>
<p>In one of the larger Midwestern dioceses that I know, there used to
be seven</p>
<p>hundred priests; now there are barely more than two hundred and
fifty. There are</p>
<p>almost no nuns now—but there are twenty-five hundred laywomen. Every
parish</p>
<p>has a lay administrator who is a woman.</p>
<p>All the priest does is say Mass and dispense the sacraments. Women
run the rest of the show</p>
<p>entirely as volunteers. That is a long way from the days of the altar
girl.</p>
<p>Why does the U.S. have such a large and vital third sector when
compared to other countries,</p>
<p>including other Western countries?</p>
<p>No other country has anywhere near the scale of activity the U.S. has
in the nonprofit sector</p>
<p>because, elsewhere essentially, the civil servants of the modern
national state destroyed the</p>
<p>community sector.</p>
<p>In France it is almost a crime to do anything in the community.
The</p>
<p>voluntary sector in Victorian England was quite large. It dealt with
poverty, with crime, with</p>
<p>prostitution, with housing. But in the twentieth century the welfare
state almost destroyed it.</p>
<p>In Europe the basic struggle was to free the state from the
domination of the church, which</p>
<p>explains why continental Europe has such an enormous anticlerical
tradition.</p>
<p>In the U.S., it was the other way around. When Jonathan Edwards
established</p>
<p>the doctrine of separation of church and state around 1740, it was in
order to free</p>
<p>the church from the state. Anticlericalism has never had a place in
this country.</p>
<p>Because of this freedom, the U.S. developed a tradition of religious
pluralism and nongovernmental</p>
<p>churches. And with pluralism, there was competition</p>
<p>among the denominations for members. Out of that competition came a
tradition</p>
<p>of community involvement which doesn’t exist in other countries.</p>
<p>Aside from Jefferson’s University of Virginia, all colleges in the
U.S. were</p>
<p>denominational until Oberlin was established in 1833.</p>

<p>I believe it is socially and morally unforgivable when managers</p>
<p>reap huge profits for themselves but fire workers.</p>
<p>Iam for the free market. Even though it doesn’t work too well,
nothing else</p>
<p>works at all. But I have serious reservations about capitalism as a
sys-tem</p>
<p>because it idolizes economics as the be-all and end-all of life. It
is one-</p>
<p>dimensional. For example, I have often advised managers that a 20–1
salary ratio</p>
<p>between senior executives and rank-and-file white-collar workers is
the limit</p>
<p>beyond which they cannot go if they don’t want resentment and</p>
<p>falling morale to hit their companies.</p>
<p>Today, I believe it is socially and morally unforgivable when
managers</p>
<p>reap huge profits for themselves but fire workers. As societies, we
will</p>
<p>pay a heavy price for the contempt this generates among middle
managers</p>
<p>and workers. In short, whole dimensions of what it means to be a
human</p>
<p>being and treated as one are not incorporated into the economic
calculus</p>
<p>of cap-italism. For such a myopic system to dominate other aspects of
life</p>
<p>is not good for any society.</p>
