<h4 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h4>
<p>段正明是个好皇帝</p>
<p>段正明是大理的现任皇帝，而且是为称职的皇帝。段正明的皇位得自堂哥段寿辉，段寿辉的皇位来自</p>
<p>谋反后的平叛。</p>
<p>段寿辉胆子小，做了一年后，就不敢当皇帝了，找了个由头就退位了。把皇位交给两位自己的堂弟段</p>
<p>正明，段正明还有个亲弟弟也很厉害，就是段正淳。</p>
<p>段正明挺喜欢当皇帝，而且当得也不错。十几年间，大理国被他治理的条条理理，百姓安居乐业。叛</p>
<p>乱后的大理也走出了阴霾，尽享太平景色。</p>
<p>十多年前的那个叛乱，当时的皇帝上德帝段廉义被杀，他的太子，也就是延庆太子，下落不明。这十</p>
<p>多年来，大家也慢慢忘掉了有过这么一个太子，有过这么一个叛乱。</p>
<p>某一天，延庆太子突然来到了保定帝段正明面前。说自己的当年的延庆太子。</p>
<p>这个人是个残疾，面目全毁，双腿残废，仅能用腹语交流。不过，这个人的武功很高，而且很明显是</p>
<p>一阳指。而且一阳指的功力比段正明还高。</p>
<p>当这个残疾人说自己的延庆太子时，保定帝知道他说的是真的。</p>
<p>延庆太子提了一个诉求：我要做皇帝，因为我回来了。</p>
<p>这是一个完全合理、合法的诉求。毕竟，没有谁废黜过延庆太子的太子之位。那么段延庆就还是太</p>
<p>子，既然是太子，现在就可以合情合理地要求继位。</p>
<p>保定帝面临这个诉求时，没有惊慌。而是带着大理鄯阐侯高升泰，弟弟段正淳，以及四大侍卫离开了</p>
<p>万劫谷，回到皇宫。</p>
<p>保定帝知道，大理国面临着一个前所未有的危机，他需要作出关键的决策。</p>
<p>保定帝并不恋位，而且，由于自己的皇位得自堂哥段寿辉，对延庆太子也没有仇恨。十几年的皇帝生</p>
<p>涯，也让自己对这个国家有了深深的感情和责任。保定帝知道，自己的决策关系着大理国的安危和未</p>
<p>来。</p>
<p>很快，保定帝就做出了决策：不能让延庆太子继位。做出决定后，其他的事情就简单了。</p>
<p>保定帝先是和大臣们取得一致。保定帝故意说到：</p>
<p>“皇位本是延庆太子的。当日只因找他不着，上明帝这才接位，后来又传位给我。延庆太子既然复出，</p>
<p>我这皇位便该当还他。”</p>
<p>果然，这个观点得到了所有人的反对。</p>
<p>先是弟弟段正淳不同意：“</p>
<p>大哥登位已久，臣民拥戴，四境升平，别说只延庆太子出世，就算上德帝复生，也不能再居此位。”</p>
<p>接着高侯爷也表了态：“</p>
<p>镇南王此言什是。延庆太子好好将段公子交出便罢，否则咱们也不认他什么太子不太子，只当他是天</p>
<p>下四大恶人之首，人人得而诛之。他武功虽高，终究好汉敌不过人多。”</p>
<p>看到大家观点一致，保定帝就开始收拾残局。延庆太子是自己堂兄。不管是自己，还是弟弟，还是大</p>
<p>理的大臣，和延庆太子都曾经有“君臣之义”，肯定不能对延庆太子动手。如何让太子死心呢？</p>
<p>保定帝第一件事就是确定了自己弟弟段正淳的顺位继承权，册立弟弟为皇太弟。这样自己如果有什么</p>
<p>生命危险，或者被俘，弟弟就可以继位，而不会让国家空转。</p>
<p>接着，保定帝找了家族外的高手黄眉僧，央求黄眉僧替自己去救侄子段誉。并且暗示可以对延庆太子</p>
<p>采取任何手段。</p>
<p>接着，保定帝废除了盐税，用以获取民心，为自己的政权稳定增加筹码。</p>
<p>做了这些后，保定帝来到天龙寺，对祖辈汇报了自己的行为。并许诺政局稳定后逊位为僧。</p>
<p>段正明知道，如果段延庆成为大理的皇帝，大理必然会成为罗刹场，百姓的安乐不复存在，祖宗的基</p>
<p>业也会不稳。作为大理的皇帝，不让段延庆继位，而有自己的弟弟按法定程序继位，是自己的根本诉</p>
<p>求。</p>
<p>几年后，段正淳死于苏州一带，已经倦于皇位的段正明按法定程序册立弟弟的儿子，自己的侄子段誉</p>
<p>为太子，并且传位给段誉。自己则正式出家为僧，法号本尘。</p>
<p>当段誉扭捏地告诉他说，自己是段延庆的儿子时。段正明先是一怔。然后说到：“孩儿，此中缘由，世</p>
<p>上唯你和段延庆二人得知，你原本不须向我禀明。但你竟然直言无隐，足见坦诚。”</p>
<p>“我和你爹爹均无子嗣，别说你本就姓段，就算不是姓段，我也决意立你为嗣。我这皇位，本来是延庆</p>
<p>太子的，我窃居其位数十年，心中常自惭愧，上天如此安排，当真再好也没有。”</p>
<p>“是呀，作为大理的皇帝，自己要的是皇位的顺延，以及百姓的安居乐业，我和延庆太子并没有私</p>
<p>仇。”</p>
<p>“这或许就是最好的安排吧。”</p>

<p>3 OCTOBER</p>
<p>Decision Making</p>
<p>Start with what is right rather than what is acceptable.</p>
<p>One has to start out with what is right rather than what is
acceptable precisely because one</p>
<p>always has to compromise in the end.</p>
<p>compromise：[ C ] an agreement made between two people or groups in
which each side gives up some of the things</p>
<p>they want so that both sides are happy at the end
妥协；折中；互让；和解</p>
<p>precisely：exactly 准确地；恰好地</p>
<p>But if one does not know what is right, one cannot distinguish
between the right compromise and</p>
<p>the wrong compromise—and will end up by making the wrong
compromise.</p>
<p>distinguish：~ (between) A and B | ~ A from B to recognize the
difference between two people or things 区分；辨别；分清</p>
<p>I was taught this when I started in 1944 on my first big consulting
assignment, a study of the</p>
<p>management structure and management policies of the General Motors
Corporation.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., who was then chairman and chief executive
officer of the company, called me</p>
<p>to his office at the start of my study and said: “I shall not tell
you what to study, what to write, or</p>
<p>what conclusions to come to.</p>
<p>My only instruction to you is to put down what you think is right as
you see it. Don’t you worry</p>
<p>about our reaction. And don’t you, above all, concern yourself with
the compromises that might be</p>
<p>needed to make your recommendations acceptable.</p>
<p>There is not one executive in this company who does not know how to
make a compromise without</p>
<p>any help from you.</p>
<p>But he can’t make the right compromise unless you first tell him what
‘right’ is.”</p>
<p>The executive thinking through a decision might put this in front of
him- or herself in neon lights.</p>

<h3 id="action-point">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Define an outcome for the decision in the previous reading that would
perfectly satisfy your</p>
<p>requirements.</p>
<p>The Effective Executive</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Elements of the Decision Process</p>
<p>The truly important features of the decisions Vail and Sloan made are
neither their novelty</p>
<p>nor their controversial nature. They are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The clear realization that the problem was generic and could only be
solved through a</li>
</ol>
<p>decision which established a rule, a principle;</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The definition of the specifications which the answer to the problem
had to satisfy, that</li>
</ol>
<p>is, of the “boundary conditions”;</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The thinking through what is “right,” that is, the solution which
will fully satisfy the</li>
</ol>
<p>specifications before attention is given to the compromises,</p>
<p>adaptations, and concessions needed to make the decision
acceptable;</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The building into the decision of the action to carry it
out;</p></li>
<li><p>The “feedback” which tests the validity and effectiveness of the
decision against the</p></li>
</ol>
<p>actual course of events.</p>
<p>These are the elements of the effective decision process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first question the effective decision-maker asks is: “Is this a
generic situation or an</li>
</ol>
<p>exception?” “Is this something that underlies a great many
occurrences? Or is the</p>
<p>occurrence a unique event that needs to be dealt with as</p>
<p>such?” The generic always has to be answered through a rule, a
principle. The</p>
<p>exceptional can only be handled as such and as it comes.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, one might distinguish between four, rather than
between</p>
<p>two, different types of occurrences.</p>
<p>There is first the truly generic of which the individual occurrence
is only a symptom.</p>
<p>■ Most of the problems that come up in the course of the
executive’s</p>
<p>work are of this nature. Inventory decisions in a business, for
instance,</p>
<p>are not “decisions.” They are adaptations. The problem is generic.
This</p>
<p>is even more likely to be true of events within production.</p>
<p>Typically, a product control and engineering group will handle many
hundreds of</p>
<p>problems in the course of a month. Yet, whenever</p>
<p>these are analyzed, the great majority prove to be just symptoms—that
is, manifestations</p>
<p>of underlying basic situations. The individual</p>
<p>process control engineer or production engineer who works in one part
of the plant</p>
<p>usually cannot see this. He might have a few problems each month with
the couplings in</p>
<p>the pipes that carry steam or hot liquids. But only when the total
workload of the group</p>
<p>over several months is analyzed does the generic problem appear. Then
one sees that</p>
<p>temperatures or pressures have become too great for the existing
equipment and that the</p>
<p>couplings, holding different lines together, need to be redesigned
for greater loads. Until</p>
<p>this is done, process control will spend a tremendous amount of time
fixing leaks without</p>
<p>ever getting control of the situation.</p>
<p>Then there is the problem which, while a unique event for the
individual institution, is</p>
<p>actually generic.</p>
<p>■ The company that receives an offer to merge from another, larger
one, will never</p>
<p>receive such an offer again if it accepts. This is a nonrecurrent
situation as far as the</p>
<p>individual company, its board of directors, and its management are
concerned. But it is, of</p>
<p>course, a generic situation which occurs all the time. To think
through whether to accept</p>
<p>or to reject the offer requires some general rules. For these,
however, one has to look to</p>
<p>the experience of others.</p>
<p>Next there is the truly exceptional, the truly unique event.</p>
<p>■ The power failure that plunged into darkness the whole of
northeastern North America</p>
<p>from the St. Lawrence to Washington in November 1965 was, according
to the first</p>
<p>explanations, a truly exceptional situation. So was the thalidomide
tragedy which led</p>
<p>to the birth of so many deformed babies in the early sixties. The
probability of these</p>
<p>events, we were told, was one in ten million or one in a hundred
million. Such</p>
<p>concatenation of malfunctions is as unlikely</p>
<p>ever to recur again as it is unlikely, for instance, for the chair on
which I sit to disintegrate</p>
<p>into its constituent atoms.</p>
<p>Truly unique events are rare, however. Whenever one appears, one has
to ask: Is this a</p>
<p>true exception or only the first manifestation of a new genus?</p>
<p>And this, the early manifestation of a new generic problem, is the
fourth and</p>
<p>last category of events with which the decision process deals.</p>
<p>■ We know now, for instance, that both the northeastern power failure
and the</p>
<p>thalidomide tragedy were only the first occurrences of what, under
conditions of modern</p>
<p>power technology or of modern</p>
<p>pharmacology, are likely to become fairly frequent malfunctions
unless generic solutions</p>
<p>are found.</p>
<p>All events but the truly unique require a generic solution. They
require a rule, a policy, a</p>
<p>principle. Once the right principle has been developed all
manifestations of the same</p>
<p>generic situation can be handled pragmatically; that is, by
adaptation of the rule to the</p>
<p>concrete circumstances of the case. Truly unique events, however,
must be treated</p>
<p>individually. One cannot develop rules for the exceptional.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker spends time to determine with which of
these four</p>
<p>situations he is dealing. He knows that he will make the wrong
decision if he classifies the</p>
<p>situation wrongly.</p>
<p>By far the most common mistake is to treat a generic situation as if
it were a series of</p>
<p>unique events; that is, to be pragmatic when one lacks the
generic</p>
<p>understanding and principle. This inevitably leads to frustration and
futility.</p>
<p>■ This was clearly shown, I think, by the failure of most of the
policies, whether domestic</p>
<p>or foreign, of the Kennedy administration. For all the brilliance of
its members, the</p>
<p>administration achieved fundamentally only one success, in the Cuban
missile crisis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it achieved practically nothing. The main reason was
surely what its members</p>
<p>called “pragmatism”; that is, its refusal to develop rules and
principles, and its insistence</p>
<p>on treating everything “on its merits.” Yet it was clear to everyone,
including the members</p>
<p>of the administration, that the basic assumptions on which its
policies rested, the basic</p>
<p>assumptions of the postwar years, had become increasingly</p>
<p>unrealistic in international as well as in domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Equally common is the mistake of treating a new event as if it were
just another example</p>
<p>of the old problem to which, therefore, the old rules should be
applied.</p>
<p>■ This was the error that snowballed a local power failure on the New
York–Ontario</p>
<p>border into the great northeastern blackout. The power engineers,
especially in New York</p>
<p>City, applied the right rule for a normal overload. Yet their own
instruments had signaled</p>
<p>that something quite extraordinary was going on which called for
exceptional, rather than</p>
<p>for standard, countermeasures.</p>
<p>By contrast, the one great triumph of President Kennedy, in the Cuban
missile crisis,</p>
<p>rested on acceptance of the challenge to think through an
extraordinary, exceptional</p>
<p>occurrence. As soon as Mr. Kennedy accepted this, his own tremendous
resources of</p>
<p>intelligence and courage effectively came into play.</p>
<p>Almost as common is the plausible but erroneous definition of the
fundamental problem.</p>
<p>Here is one example.</p>
<p>■ Since the end of World War II the American military services
have</p>
<p>been plagued by their inability to keep highly trained medical people
in uniform. There</p>
<p>have been dozens of studies and dozens of proposed remedies. However,
all of the</p>
<p>studies start out with the plausible hypothesis that pay is the
problem—whereas the real</p>
<p>problem lies in the traditional structure of military medicine. With
its emphasis on the</p>
<p>general practitioner, it is out of alignment with today’s medical
profession, which stresses</p>
<p>the specialist. The career ladder in military medicine leads from
specialization to medical</p>
<p>and hospital administration and away from research and specialized
practice. Today’s</p>
<p>young, well-trained physicians, therefore, feel that they waste</p>
<p>their time and skill in the military service, where they either have
to work as general</p>
<p>practitioners or become chairbound administrators. They want the
opportunity to develop</p>
<p>the skills and apply the practice of today’s highly scientific,
specialized doctor.</p>
<p>So far the military has not faced up to the basic decision. Are
the</p>
<p>armed services willing to settle for a second-rate medical
organization</p>
<p>staffed with people who cannot make the grade in the highly
scientific, researchoriented, and highly specialized civilian profession
of medicine? Or are they willing and</p>
<p>able to organize the practice of medicine within the services in ways
that differ</p>
<p>fundamentally from the organization and structure of a military
service? Until the military</p>
<p>accepts this as the real decision, its young doctors will keep on
leaving as soon as</p>
<p>they can.</p>
<p>Or the definition of the problem may be incomplete.</p>
<p>■ This largely explains why the American automobile industry found
itself in 1966</p>
<p>suddenly under sharp attack for its unsafe cars—</p>
<p>and also why the industry itself was so totally bewildered by the
attack.</p>
<p>It is simply not true that the industry has paid no attention to
safety. On the contrary, it</p>
<p>has worked hard at safer highway engineering and at driver training.
That accidents are</p>
<p>caused by unsafe roads and unsafe drivers is plausible enough.
Indeed, all other agencies</p>
<p>concerned with automotive safety, from the highway patrol to the
schools, picked the</p>
<p>same targets for their campaigns. These campaigns have produced
results. Highways</p>
<p>built for safety have many fewer accidents; and so have
safety-trained drivers. But</p>
<p>though the ratio of accidents per thousand cars or per thousand miles
driven has been</p>
<p>going down, the total number of accidents and their severity has kept
creeping up.</p>
<p>Long ago it should have been clear that a small percentage of
drivers—drunken drivers,</p>
<p>for instance, or the 5 percent who are “accident-prone” and cause
three quarters or so of</p>
<p>all accidents—are beyond the reach of driver training and can cause
accidents on the</p>
<p>safest road. Long ago it should have become clear that we have to do
something about a</p>
<p>small but significant probability of accidents that</p>
<p>will occur despite safety laws and safety training. And this means
that safehighway and safe-driving campaigns have to be supplemented
by</p>
<p>engineering to make accidents themselves less dangerous. Where we
engineered to</p>
<p>make cars safe when used right, we also have to engineer to make cars
safe when used</p>
<p>wrong. This, however, the automobile industry failed to see.</p>
<p>This example shows why the incomplete explanation is often more
dangerous than the</p>
<p>totally wrong explanation. Everyone connected with safe- driving
campaigns—the</p>
<p>automobile industry, but also state highway commissioners, automobile
clubs, and</p>
<p>insurance companies—felt that to accept</p>
<p>a probability of accidents was to condone, if not to encourage,
dangerous driving</p>
<p>—just as my grandmother’s generation believed that the doctor who
treated venereal</p>
<p>diseases abetted immorality. It is this common human tendency to
confuse plausibility</p>
<p>with morality which makes the incomplete hypothesis so dangerous a
mistake and so</p>
<p>hard to correct.</p>
<p>The effective decision-maker, therefore, always assumes initially
that the problem is</p>
<p>generic.</p>
<p>He always assumes that the event that clamors for his attention is in
reality a symptom.</p>
<p>He looks for the true problem. He is not content with doctoring the
symptom alone.</p>
<p>And if the event is truly unique, the experienced decision-maker
suspects that this</p>
<p>heralds a new underlying problem and that what appears as unique
will</p>
<p>turn out to have been simply the first manifestation of a new generic
situation.</p>
<p>This also explains why the effective decision-maker always tries to
put his solution on the</p>
<p>highest possible conceptual level. He does not solve the immediate
financing problem by</p>
<p>issuing whatever security would be easiest to sell at the best price
for the next few years.</p>
<p>If he expects to need the capital market for the foreseeable future,
he invents a new kind</p>
<p>of investor and designs the appropriate security for a mass-capital
market that does not</p>
<p>yet exist. If he has to bring into line a flock of undisciplined but
capable divisional</p>
<p>presidents, he does not get rid of the most obstreperous ones and buy
off the rest. He</p>
<p>develops a constitutional concept of large-scale organization. If he
sees his industry as</p>
<p>necessarily monopolistic, he does not content himself with
fulminating against socialism.</p>
<p>He builds the public regulatory agency into a deliberate “third way”
between the Scylla of</p>
<p>irresponsible private enterprise unchecked by competition and the
Charybdis of equally</p>
<p>irresponsible, indeed essentially uncontrollable, government
monopoly.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious facts of social and political life is the
longevity of</p>
<p>the temporary. British licensing hours for taverns, for instance,
French rent controls, or</p>
<p>Washington “temporary” government buildings, all three hastily
developed in World War I</p>
<p>to last “a few months of temporary emergency,” are still with us
fifty years later. The</p>
<p>effective decision-maker knows this. He too improvises, of course.
But he asks himself</p>
<p>every time, “If I had to live with this for a long time, would I be
willing to?” And if the</p>
<p>answer is “No,” he keeps on working to find a more general, a more
conceptual, a more</p>
<p>comprehensive solution—one which establishes the right principle.</p>
<p>As a result, the effective executive does not make many decisions.
But the reason is not</p>
<p>that he takes too long in making one—in fact, a decision on principle
does not, as a rule,</p>
<p>take longer than a decision on symptoms and expediency. The effective
executive does</p>
<p>not need to make many decisions. Because he solves generic situations
through a rule</p>
<p>and policy, he can handle</p>
<p>most events as cases under the rule; that is, by adaptation. “A
country with many laws is a</p>
<p>country of incompetent lawyers,” says an old legal proverb. It is a
country which attempts</p>
<p>to solve every problem as a unique phenomenon, rather than as a
special case under</p>
<p>general rules of law. Similarly, an executive who makes many
decisions is both lazy</p>
<p>and ineffectual.</p>
<p>The decision-maker also always tests for signs that something
atypical,</p>
<p>something unusual, is happening; he always asks: “Does the
explanation explain</p>
<p>the observed events and does it explain all of them?”; he always
writes out what</p>
<p>the solution is expected to make happen—make automobile accidents
disappear,</p>
<p>for instance—and then tests regularly to see if this really happens;
and finally, he goes</p>
<p>back and thinks the problem through again when he sees something
atypical, when he</p>
<p>finds phenomena his explanation does not really explain, or</p>
<p>when the course of events deviates, even in details, from his
expectations.</p>
<p>These are in essence the rules Hippocrates laid down for medical
diagnosis well over</p>
<p>2,000 years ago. They are the rules for scientific observation
first</p>
<p>formulated by Aristotle and then reaffirmed by Galileo three hundred
years ago.</p>
<p>These, in other words, are old, well-known, time-tested rules, rules
one can learn and can</p>
<p>systematically apply.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second major element in the decision process is clear
specifications as to</li>
</ol>
<p>what the decision has to accomplish. What are the objectives the
decision has to reach?</p>
<p>What are the minimum goals it has to attain? What are the conditions
it</p>
<p>has to satisfy? In science these are known as “boundary conditions.”
A decision,</p>
<p>to be effective, needs to satisfy the boundary conditions. It needs
to be adequate to</p>
<p>its purpose.</p>
<p>The more concisely and clearly boundary conditions are stated, the
greater the likelihood</p>
<p>that the decision will indeed be an effective one and will accomplish
what it set out to do.</p>
<p>Conversely, any serious shortfall in defining these boundary
conditions is almost certain</p>
<p>to make a decision ineffectual, no matter how brilliant it may
seem.</p>
<p>“What is the minimum needed to resolve this problem?” is the form in
which</p>
<p>the boundary conditions are usually probed. “Can our needs be
satisfied,” Alfred</p>
<p>P. Sloan presumably asked himself when he took command of General
Motors in 1922,</p>
<p>“by removing the autonomy of the division heads?” His answer was
clearly in the</p>
<p>negative. The boundary conditions of his problem demanded strength
and responsibility</p>
<p>in the chief operating positions. This was needed as much as unity
and control at the</p>
<p>center. The boundary conditions demanded a solution to a problem of
structure, rather</p>
<p>than an accommodation among personalities. And this in turn made his
solution last.</p>
<p>It is not always easy to find the appropriate boundary conditions.
And intelligent people</p>
<p>do not necessarily agree on them.</p>
<p>■ On the morning after the power blackout one New York newspaper
managed to</p>
<p>appear: The New York Times. It had shifted its printing operations
immediately across the</p>
<p>Hudson to Newark, New Jersey, where the power plants were functioning
and where a</p>
<p>local paper, The Newark Evening News, had a substantial printing
plant. But</p>
<p>instead of the million copies the Times management had ordered, fewer
than half this</p>
<p>number actually reached the readers. Just as the Times went to press
(so at least goes a</p>
<p>widely told anecdote) the executive editor and three of his
assistants started arguing how</p>
<p>to hyphenate one word. This took them forty-eight minutes (so it is
said)—or half of the</p>
<p>available press time. The Times, the editor argued, sets a standard
for written English in</p>
<p>the United States and therefore cannot afford a grammatical
mistake.</p>
<p>Assuming the tale to be true—and I do not vouch for it—one</p>
<p>wonders what the management thought about the decision. But there
is</p>
<p>no doubt that, given the fundamental assumptions and objectives of
the executive editor,</p>
<p>it was the right decision. His boundary conditions quite clearly were
not the number of</p>
<p>copies sold at any one morning, but the infallibility of the Times as
a grammarian and as</p>
<p>Magister Americae.</p>
<p>The effective executive knows that a decision that does not satisfy
the boundary</p>
<p>conditions is ineffectual and inappropriate. It may be worse
indeed</p>
<p>than a decision that satisfies the wrong boundary conditions. Both
will be wrong, of</p>
<p>course. But one can salvage the appropriate decision for the
incorrect</p>
<p>boundary conditions. It is still an effective decision. One cannot
get anything but</p>
<p>trouble from the decision that is inadequate to its
specifications.</p>
<p>In fact, clear thinking about the boundary conditions is needed so
that one knows when a</p>
<p>decision has to be abandoned. There are two famous illustrations for
this—</p>
<p>one of a decision where the boundary conditions had become confused
and one of a</p>
<p>decision where they were kept so clear as to make possible immediate
replacement of</p>
<p>the outflanked decision by a new and appropriate policy.</p>
<p>■ The first example is the famous Schlieffen Plan of the German
General Staff at the</p>
<p>outbreak of World War I. This plan was meant to enable Germany to
fight a war on both</p>
<p>the eastern and the western fronts simultaneously without having to
splinter her forces</p>
<p>between East and West. To accomplish this, the Schlieffen Plan
proposed to</p>
<p>offer only token opposition to the weaker enemy, that is, to Russia,
and</p>
<p>to concentrate all forces first on a quick knockout blow against
France, after which Russia</p>
<p>would be dealt with. This, of course, implied willingness to let the
Russian armies move</p>
<p>fairly deeply into German territory at the outbreak of the war and
until the decisive victory</p>
<p>over France. But in August 1914, it became clear that the speed of
the Russian armies had</p>
<p>been underrated. The Junkers in East Prussia whose estates were
overrun by the</p>
<p>Russians set up a howl for protection.</p>
<p>Schlieffen himself had kept the boundary conditions clearly in
his</p>
<p>mind. But his successors were technicians rather than decision-makers
and strategists.</p>
<p>They jettisoned the basic commitment underlying the Schlieffen Plan,
the commitment</p>
<p>not to splinter the German forces. They should have dropped the plan.
Instead they kept</p>
<p>it but made its attainment impossible. They weakened the armies in
the West sufficiently</p>
<p>to deprive their initial victories of full impact, yet did not
strengthen the armies in the East</p>
<p>sufficiently to knock out the</p>
<p>Russians. They thereby brought about the one thing the Schlieffen
Plan</p>
<p>had been designed to prevent: a stalemate with its ensuing war of</p>
<p>attrition in which superiority of manpower, rather than superiority
of</p>
<p>strategy, eventually had to win. Instead of a strategy, all they had
from</p>
<p>there on was confused improvisation, impassioned rhetoric, and hopes
for miracles.</p>
<p>■ Contrast with this the second example: the action of Franklin
D.</p>
<p>Roosevelt when becoming president in 1933. All through his
campaign</p>
<p>Roosevelt had worked on a plan for economic recovery. Such a plan, in
1933, could only</p>
<p>be built on financial conservatism and a balanced budget. Then,
immediately before</p>
<p>FDR’s inauguration, the economy collapsed in the Bank Holiday.
Economic policy might</p>
<p>still have done the work economically. But it had become clear that
the patient would not</p>
<p>survive politically.</p>
<p>Roosevelt immediately substituted a political objective for his
former economic one. He</p>
<p>switched from recovery to reform. The new</p>
<p>specifications called for political dynamics. This, almost
automatically, meant a complete</p>
<p>change of economic policy from one of conservatism to one of radical
innovation. The</p>
<p>boundary conditions had changed—and Roosevelt was enough of a
decisionmaker to know almost intuitively that this meant abandoning his
original plan altogether if</p>
<p>he wanted to have any effectiveness.</p>
<p>But clear thinking about the boundary conditions is needed also to
identify the most</p>
<p>dangerous of all possible decisions: the one that might—just might—
work if nothing</p>
<p>whatever goes wrong. These decisions always seem to make sense. But
when one thinks</p>
<p>through the specifications they have to satisfy, one always finds
that they are essentially</p>
<p>incompatible with each other. That such a decision might succeed is
not impossible—it is</p>
<p>merely grossly improbable. The trouble with miracles is not, after
all, that they happen</p>
<p>rarely; it is that one cannot rely on them.</p>
<p>■ A perfect example was President Kennedy’s Bay of Pigs decision in
1961. One</p>
<p>specification was clearly Castro’s overthrow. But at the same time,
there was another</p>
<p>specification: not to make it appear that</p>
<p>U.S. forces were intervening in one of the American republics. That
the second</p>
<p>specification was rather absurd, and that no one in the whole world
would have believed</p>
<p>for one moment that the invasion was a spontaneous uprising of the
Cubans, is beside</p>
<p>the point. To the</p>
<p>American policy-makers at the time, the appearance of nonintervention
seemed a</p>
<p>legitimate and indeed a necessary condition. But these two
specifications would have</p>
<p>been compatible with each other only if an immediate islandwide
uprising against Castro</p>
<p>would have completely</p>
<p>paralyzed the Cuban army. And this, while not impossible, was
clearly</p>
<p>not highly probable in a police state. Either the whole idea should
have been dropped or</p>
<p>American full-scale support should have been provided to ensure
success of</p>
<p>the invasion.</p>
<p>It is not disrespect for President Kennedy to say that his mistake
was not, as he</p>
<p>explained, that he had “listened to the experts.” The mistake was
failure to think through</p>
<p>clearly the boundary conditions</p>
<p>that the decision had to satisfy, and refusal to face up to the
unpleasant reality that a</p>
<p>decision that has to satisfy two different and at bottom</p>
<p>incompatible specifications is not a decision but a prayer for a
miracle.</p>
<p>Yet, defining the specifications and setting the boundary conditions
cannot</p>
<p>be done on the “facts” in any decision of importance. It always has
to be done on</p>
<p>interpretation. It is risk-taking judgment.</p>
<p>Everyone can make the wrong decision—in fact, everyone will
sometimes</p>
<p>make a wrong decision. But no one needs to make a decision which, on
its face, falls</p>
<p>short of satisfying the boundary conditions.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>One has to start out with what is right rather than what is
acceptable (let alone who is</li>
</ol>
<p>right) precisely because one always has to compromise in the end. But
if one does not</p>
<p>know what is right to satisfy the specifications and boundary</p>
<p>conditions, one cannot distinguish between the right compromise and
the wrong</p>
<p>compromise—and will end up by making the wrong compromise.</p>
<p>■ I was taught this when I started in 1944 on my first big consulting
assignment, a study</p>
<p>of the management structure and management policies of the General
Motors</p>
<p>Corporation. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., who was then chairman and chief
executive officer of the</p>
<p>company, called me to his office at the start of my study and said:
“I shall not tell you</p>
<p>what to study, what to write, or what conclusions to come to. This is
your task. My only</p>
<p>instruction to you is to put down what you think is right as you see
it. Don’t you worry</p>
<p>about our reaction. Don’t you worry about whether we will like this
or dislike that. And</p>
<p>don’t you, above all, concern yourself with the compromises that
might be needed</p>
<p>to make your recommendations acceptable. There is not one executive
in this company</p>
<p>who does not know how to make every single conceivable compromise
without any help</p>
<p>from you. But he can’t make the right compromise unless you first
tell him what ‘right’ is.”</p>
<p>The executive thinking through a decision might put this in front of
himself in neon lights.</p>
<p>President Kennedy learned this lesson from the Bay of Pigs fiasco. It
largely explains his</p>
<p>triumph in the Cuban missile crisis two years later. His ruthless
insistence then on thinking</p>
<p>through what boundary conditions the decision had</p>
<p>to satisfy gave him the knowledge of what compromise to accept
(namely, tacitly to</p>
<p>abandon the U.S. demand for on-the-ground inspection after air
reconnaissance had</p>
<p>shown such inspection to be no longer necessary) and what to insist
on (namely, the</p>
<p>physical dismantling and return to Russia of the Soviet missiles
themselves).</p>
<p>For there are two different kinds of compromise. One kind is
expressed in</p>
<p>the old proverb: “Half a loaf is better than no bread.” The other
kind is expressed in the</p>
<p>story of the Judgment of Solomon, which was clearly based on the
realization that “half a</p>
<p>baby is worse than no baby at all.” In the first instance, the
boundary conditions are still</p>
<p>being satisfied. The purpose of bread is to provide food, and half a
loaf is still food. Half a</p>
<p>baby, however, does not satisfy the boundary conditions. For half a
baby is not half of a</p>
<p>living and growing child. It is a corpse in two pieces.</p>
<p>It is fruitless and a waste of time to worry about what is acceptable
and what one had</p>
<p>better not say so as not to evoke resistance. The things one worries
about never happen.</p>
<p>And objections and difficulties no one thought about suddenly turn
out to be almost</p>
<p>insurmountable obstacles. One gains nothing in other words by
starting out with the</p>
<p>question: “What is acceptable?” And in the</p>
<p>process of answering it, one gives away the important things, as a
rule, and loses</p>
<p>any chance to come up with an effective, let alone with the right,
answer.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Converting the decision into action is the fourth major element in
the decision process.</li>
</ol>
<p>While thinking through the boundary conditions is the most difficult
step in decisionmaking, converting the decision into effective action is
usually the most time-consuming</p>
<p>one. Yet a decision will not become effective unless</p>
<p>the action commitments have been built into the decision from the
start.</p>
<p>In fact, no decision has been made unless carrying it out in specific
steps has</p>
<p>become someone’s work assignment and responsibility. Until then,
there are only</p>
<p>good intentions.</p>
<p>■ This is the trouble with so many policy statements, especially
of</p>
<p>business: They contain no action commitment. To carry them out is no
one’s specific</p>
<p>work and responsibility. No wonder that the people in the
organization tend to view these</p>
<p>statements cynically if not as</p>
<p>declarations of what top management is really not going to do.</p>
<p>Converting a decision into action requires answering several
distinct</p>
<p>questions: Who has to know of this decision? What action has to be
taken? Who</p>
<p>is to take it? And what does the action have to be so that the people
who have to</p>
<p>do it can do it? The first and the last of these are too often
overlooked—with dire results.</p>
<p>■ A story that has become a legend among operations researchers</p>
<p>illustrates the importance of the question “Who has to know?” A major
manufacturer of</p>
<p>industrial equipment decided several years ago to discontinue one
model. For years it had</p>
<p>been standard equipment on a line of machine tools, many of which
were still in use. It</p>
<p>was decided, therefore, to sell the model to present owners of the
old equipment for</p>
<p>another three years as a replacement, and then to stop making and
selling it. Orders for</p>
<p>this particular model had been going down for a good many years. But
they shot up as</p>
<p>former customers reordered against the day when the model would no
longer be</p>
<p>available. No one had, however, asked, “Who needs to know of this
decision?” Therefore</p>
<p>nobody informed the clerk in the purchasing department who was in
charge of buying the</p>
<p>parts from which the model itself was being</p>
<p>assembled. His instructions were to buy parts in a given ratio to
current sales—and the</p>
<p>instructions remained unchanged. When the time came to discontinue
further production</p>
<p>of the model, the company had in its warehouse enough parts for
another eight to ten</p>
<p>years of production, parts that had to be written off at a
considerable loss.</p>
<p>The action must also be appropriate to the capacities of the people
who have to carry it</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>■ A chemical company found itself, in recent years, with fairly
large</p>
<p>amounts of blocked currency in two West African countries. It
decided</p>
<p>that to protect this money, it had to invest it locally in businesses
which</p>
<p>would contribute to the local economy, would not require imports
from</p>
<p>abroad, and would, if successful, be the kind that could be sold to
local investors if and</p>
<p>when currency remittances became possible again. To establish these
businesses, the</p>
<p>company developed a simple chemical process to preserve a tropical
fruit which is a</p>
<p>staple crop in both countries and which, up until then, had suffered
serious spoilage in</p>
<p>transit to its Western markets.</p>
<p>The business was a success in both countries. But in one country the
local manager set</p>
<p>the business up in such a manner that it required highly skilled and,
above all, technically</p>
<p>trained management of the kind not easily available in West Africa.
In the other country</p>
<p>the local manager thought through the capacities of the people who
would eventually</p>
<p>have to run the business and worked hard at making both process and
business simple</p>
<p>and at staffing from the start with nationals of the country right up
to the top.</p>
<p>A few years later it became possible again to transfer currency from
these two countries.</p>
<p>But though the business flourished, no buyer could be found for it in
the first country. No</p>
<p>one available locally had the necessary managerial and technical
skills. The business had</p>
<p>to be liquidated at a loss. In the other country so many local
entrepreneurs</p>
<p>were eager to buy the business that the company repatriated its
original investment with</p>
<p>a substantial profit.</p>
<p>The process and the business built on it were essentially the same in
both places. But in</p>
<p>the first country no one had asked: “What kind of</p>
<p>people do we have available to make this decision effective? And
what</p>
<p>can they do?” As a result, the decision itself became frustrated.</p>
<p>All this becomes doubly important when people have to change
behavior, habits, or</p>
<p>attitudes if a decision is to become effective action. Here one has
to make sure not only</p>
<p>that responsibility for the action is clearly assigned and that the
people responsible are</p>
<p>capable of doing the needful. One has to make sure</p>
<p>that their measurements, their standards for accomplishment, and
their incentives are</p>
<p>changed simultaneously. Otherwise, the people will get caught in a
paralyzing internal</p>
<p>emotional conflict.</p>
<p>■ Theodore Vail’s decision that the business of the Bell System
was</p>
<p>service might have remained dead letter but for the yardsticks of
service performance</p>
<p>which he designed to measure managerial performance. Bell managers
were used to</p>
<p>being measured by the profitability of their units, or at the least,
by cost. The new</p>
<p>yardsticks made them accept rapidly the new objectives.</p>
<p>■ In sharp contrast is the recent failure of a brilliant chairman
and</p>
<p>chief executive to make effective a new organization structure and
new objectives in an</p>
<p>old, large, and proud American company. Everyone agreed that the
changes were</p>
<p>needed. The company, after many years as leader of its industry,
showed definite signs of</p>
<p>aging; in almost all major fields newer, smaller, and more aggressive
competitors were</p>
<p>outflanking it. But to gain acceptance for the new ideas, the
chairman promoted the most</p>
<p>prominent spokesmen of the old school into the most visible and
best-paid positions—</p>
<p>especially into three new executive vicepresidencies. This meant only
one thing to the people in the company: “They don’t really</p>
<p>mean it.”</p>
<p>If the greatest rewards are given for behavior contrary to that which
the new</p>
<p>course of action requires, then everyone will conclude that this
contrary behavior</p>
<p>is what the people at the top really want and are going to
reward.</p>
<p>Not everyone can do what Vail did and build the execution of his
decisions into the</p>
<p>decision itself. But everyone can think what action commitments a
specific decision</p>
<p>requires, what work assignments follow from it, and what people are
available to carry it</p>
<p>out.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Finally, a feedback has to be built into the decision to provide a
continuous</li>
</ol>
<p>testing, against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the
decision.</p>
<p>Decisions are made by men. Men are fallible; at their best their
works do not</p>
<p>last long. Even the best decision has a high probability of being
wrong. Even the most</p>
<p>effective one eventually becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>■ If this needs documentation, the Vail and Sloan decisions supply
it. Despite their</p>
<p>imagination and daring, only one of Vail’s decisions, the decision
that service was the</p>
<p>business of the Bell System, is still valid today and applicable in
the form in which he</p>
<p>worked it out. The investment character of the AT&amp;T common share
had to be drastically</p>
<p>changed in the nineteen-fifties in response to the emergence of the
institutional investors</p>
<p>—pension trusts and mutual funds—as the new</p>
<p>channels through which the middle class invests. While Bell Labs has
maintained its</p>
<p>dominant position, the new scientific and technological
developments—especially in</p>
<p>space technology and in such devices as the laser—have made it
reasonably clear that no</p>
<p>communications company, no matter how large, can any longer hope to
provide by its</p>
<p>own means all its own technological and scientific needs. At the same
time, the</p>
<p>development of technology has made it probable—for the first time in
seventy-five years</p>
<p>—that new processes of telecommunications will seriously compete with
the telephone,</p>
<p>and that in major communications fields, for example, information and
data</p>
<p>communication, no single communications medium can maintain
dominance, let alone</p>
<p>the monopoly which Bell has had for oral communications over
distance. And while</p>
<p>regulation remains a necessity for the existence of a privately owned
telecommunications</p>
<p>company, the regulation Vail worked so hard to make effective—that
is, regulation by the</p>
<p>individual states—is becoming increasingly inappropriate to the
realities of a nationwide</p>
<p>and indeed international system. But the inevitable—and
necessary—regulation by the</p>
<p>federal government has not been worked out by the Bell System and has
instead been</p>
<p>fought by it through the kind of delaying action Vail was so careful
not to engage in.</p>
<p>As to Sloan’s decentralization of General Motors, it still stands—
but it is becoming clear</p>
<p>that it will have to be thought through again soon. Not only have
basic principles of his</p>
<p>design been changed and</p>
<p>revised so often that they have become fuzzy beyond
recognition—the</p>
<p>autonomous automotive divisions, for instance, increasingly are not
in full control of their</p>
<p>manufacturing and assembly operations and</p>
<p>therefore not fully responsible for the results. The individual makes
of car, from Chevrolet</p>
<p>to Cadillac, have also long ceased to represent</p>
<p>major price classes the way Sloan originally designed them. Above
all, Sloan designed a</p>
<p>U.S. company; and though it soon acquired foreign subsidiaries, it
remained a U.S.</p>
<p>company in its organization and management structure. But General
Motors is clearly an</p>
<p>international company today. Its great growth and major opportunities
are</p>
<p>increasingly outside the United States and especially in Europe. It
will survive and prosper</p>
<p>only if it finds the right principles and the right</p>
<p>organization for the multinational company. The job Sloan did in
1922</p>
<p>will have to be done over again soon—it will predictably become
pressing as soon as the</p>
<p>industry runs into a period of economic difficulties. And if not done
over fairly drastically,</p>
<p>Sloan’s solution is likely to become a millstone around GM’s neck and
increasingly a bar to</p>
<p>its success.</p>
<p>When General Eisenhower was elected president, his predecessor, Harry
S. Truman, said:</p>
<p>“Poor Ike; when he was a general, he gave an order and it was carried
out. Now he is</p>
<p>going to sit in that big office and he’ll give an order and not a
damn thing is going to</p>
<p>happen.”</p>
<p>The reason why “not a damn thing is going to happen” is, however, not
that generals have</p>
<p>more authority than presidents. It is that military organizations</p>
<p>learned long ago that futility is the lot of most orders and
organized the feedback to</p>
<p>check on the execution of the order. They learned long ago that to go
oneself</p>
<p>and look is the only reliable feedback. Reports—all a president is
normally able</p>
<p>to mobilize—are not much help. All military services have long ago
learned that the officer</p>
<p>who has given an order goes out and sees for himself whether it has
been carried out. At</p>
<p>the least he sends one of his own aides—he never relies on what he is
told by the</p>
<p>subordinate to whom the order was given. Not that he distrusts the
subordinate; he has</p>
<p>learned from experience to distrust communications.</p>
<p>■ This is the reason why a battalion commander is expected to go out
and taste the food</p>
<p>served his men. He could, of course, read the</p>
<p>menus and order this or that item to be brought in to him. But no; he
is expected to go</p>
<p>into the mess hall and take his sample of the food from the same
kettle that serves the</p>
<p>enlisted men.</p>
<p>With the coming of the computer this will become even more important,
for the decisionmaker will, in all likelihood, be even further removed
from the scene of action. Unless he</p>
<p>accepts, as a matter of course, that he had better go</p>
<p>out and look at the scene of action, he will be increasingly divorced
from reality. All a</p>
<p>computer can handle are abstractions. And abstractions can be relied
on only if they are</p>
<p>constantly checked against the concrete. Otherwise, they are certain
to mislead us.</p>
<p>To go and look for oneself is also the best, if not the only, way to
test whether the</p>
<p>assumptions on which a decision had been made are still valid or</p>
<p>whether they are becoming obsolete and need to be thought through
again. And one</p>
<p>always has to expect the assumptions to become obsolete sooner or
later. Reality never</p>
<p>stands still very long.</p>
<p>Failure to go out and look is the typical reason for persisting in a
course of action long</p>
<p>after it has ceased to be appropriate or even rational. This is true
for business decisions</p>
<p>as well as for governmental policies. It explains in large measure
the failure of Stalin’s</p>
<p>postwar policy in Europe but also the inability of the United States
to adjust its policies to</p>
<p>the realities of de Gaulle’s Europe or the failure of the British to
accept, until too late, the</p>
<p>reality of the European Common Market.</p>
<p>One needs organized information for the feedback. One needs reports
and</p>
<p>figures. But unless one builds one’s feedback around direct exposure
to reality— unless</p>
<p>one disciplines oneself to go out and look—one condemns oneself to a
sterile dogmatism</p>
<p>and with it to ineffectiveness.</p>
<p>These are the elements of the decision process. But what about the
decision itself?</p>

<h3 id="decision-making">Decision Making</h3>
<p>Start with what is right rather than what is acceptable.</p>
<p>One has to start out with what is right rather than what is
acceptable</p>
<p>precisely because one always has to compromise in the end. But if one
does</p>
<p>not know what is right, one cannot distinguish between the right</p>
<p>compromise and the wrong compromise—and will end up by making the</p>
<p>wrong compromise. I was taught this when I started in 1944 on my
first big</p>
<p>consulting assignment, a study of the management structure and
manage-</p>
<p>ment policies of the General Motors Corporation. Alfred P. Sloan,
Jr., who</p>
<p>was then chairman and chief executive officer of the company, called
me to</p>
<p>his office at the start of my study and said: “I shall not tell you
what to study,</p>
<p>what to write, or what conclusions to come to. My only instruction to
you is</p>
<p>to put down what you think is right as you see it. Don’t you worry
about our</p>
<p>reaction. And don’t you, above all, concern yourself with the
compromises</p>
<p>that might be needed to make your recommendations ac-ceptable. There
is</p>
<p>not one executive in this company who does not know how to make</p>
<p>Acompromise without any help from you. But he can’t make the
right</p>
<p>compromise unless you first tell him what ‘right’ is.”</p>
<p>The executive thinking through a decision might put this in front
of</p>
<p>him- or herself in neon lights.</p>
