<p>做坏人奸！做好人要更奸！！！</p>
<p>做好人的资格</p>
<p>我为什么讨厌江南七怪</p>
<p>我是非常讨厌江南七怪的。不但讨厌柯镇恶，也讨厌朱聪，也讨厌南希仁，全金发也不喜欢，甚至连</p>
<p>着韩小莹也一起讨厌起来了。</p>
<p>经常，我自己对自己的这个讨厌都感到莫名其妙。江南七怪是一些挺好的人呀，为什么我这么讨厌他</p>
<p>们呢？</p>
<p>首先，江南七怪都是很重情义的。在江湖上，这绝对是优良品质。江南七怪之间是很重情义的，即使</p>
<p>张阿生死了，他们在教授郭靖武功时，还是教授了张阿生的武功，张阿生也算是郭靖的师父。</p>
<p>当柯镇恶以为黄药师杀死了自己的其他兄弟时，他想的就是杀死郭靖、黄蓉等报仇。不惜一切代价。</p>
<p>这些都是含金量非常高的情义。</p>
<p>而且，江南七怪非常重侠义，这个在江湖上也是优良品质。当江南七怪知道侠义后代郭靖被人绑架</p>
<p>后，当即万里追敌。</p>
<p>当听说全真教要去收拾黄药师时，也不辞辛苦赶到桃花岛报信。</p>
<p>最后，江南七怪是非常诚信的一个人，而且是愚信，一言九鼎。即使明知赴死，也绝不愿意食言。</p>
<p>这样的人，我为什么那么讨厌呢？是我的三观有问题么？难道我居然是个坏人？</p>
<p>今天读了德鲁克之后，我才知道，原来另有原因。</p>
<p>江南七怪非常侠义，他们受人之托去阻止丘处机。他们一直觉得丘处机在为金兵工作，是金狗，可是</p>
<p>他们倒是问一下呀。</p>
<p>七个大活人，啥也见面就噼里啪啦一顿打，但凡有一个有脑子的，开个口，也不至于闹那么大的误</p>
<p>会。</p>
<p>再说，你就算帮焦木，也要问清楚呀，不问清楚，白白放走了抓着郭静妈妈林萍的段天德。</p>
<p>再说了，你和丘处机大，打得过也算，打不过，不说，没理也不说，还那么横。仗着侠义，就着没脑</p>
<p>子硬生生用自己的好心做成了坏事。</p>
<p>再说柯镇恶的那些兄弟死在桃花岛的事情。也算杨康计策狠毒，放了瞎眼的柯镇恶去江湖上四处传说</p>
<p>黄药师的狠毒。</p>
<p>柯镇恶的眼睛是瞎的，他的心也是瞎的么？一些小小的计谋，就给自己的像儿子一样的弟子郭靖带来</p>
<p>了灭顶之灾。</p>
<p>他还觉得自己很委屈，不能为“兄弟们”报仇，不能全情义。</p>
<p>对，这不是他第一次想杀郭靖，在郭靖十几岁的时候就有一次。那时，郭靖正在跟着丹阳子马钰学习</p>
<p>轻功和金雁功。</p>
<p>柯镇恶感觉到郭靖武功进展突然飞速了，就怀疑他有了别的师父。他们觉得不放心，就跟踪郭靖一</p>
<p>趟，发现了梅超风的一些头骨。</p>
<p>柯镇恶用他的猪脑子马上判断出了郭靖是在跟着梅超风学武，很快就要害死他们兄弟几个了。</p>
<p>柯镇恶做了一个决定：</p>
<p>柯镇恶将铁杖在地下重重一顿，低沉了声音道：“咱们现下回去，只作不知，待靖儿回来，先把他废</p>
<p>了。“</p>
<p>其实，这个决定韩小莹是不同意的，韩小莹认为，郭靖不是这样的人，毕竟，郭靖是他们带大的。</p>
<p>不过，她自己一个人也做不了主，最后还是统一”废掉“郭靖了。由柯镇恶来下手。</p>
<p>柯镇恶是如何做的呢？</p>
<p>（郭靖）突然左右双手的手腕同时一紧，已给人抓住，跟着膝後剧疼，给人踢倒在地，呼的一声，铁</p>
<p>杖当头砸落。郭靖侧身倒地，见持杖打来的正是大师父柯镇恶，只吓得魂飞天外，再也想不到抵挡挣</p>
<p>扎，只闭目待死，却听得当的一声，兵刃相交，一人扑在自己身上。</p>
<p>他睁眼看时，只见七师父韩小莹护住了自己，叫道：“大哥，且慢！”她手中长剑却已给柯镇恶铁杖砸</p>
<p>飞。柯镇恶出声长叹，铁杖重重一顿，说道：“七妹总是心软。”</p>
<p>还好七妹心软，不然郭靖就死在了柯镇恶手里，全剧终。</p>
<p>这一段，柯镇恶杀郭靖的逻辑也是通的，也是本的兄弟情谊，因为他们要为张阿生报仇。</p>
<p>唯一欠缺的，是这几人没脑子。</p>
<p>是的，江南七怪重情义，有侠义，守诺言，他们也一心做好事，问题是，他们根本没有做好事的能</p>
<p>力，每一件好事都做成了坏事，最后付出了惨痛的代价，如果不是郭靖、黄蓉的主角光环，这几个重</p>
<p>情重义的侠义之士，早就被人打死了。</p>

<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>Union Carbide and Vienna, West Virginia</p>
<p>West Virginia, never one of the more prosperous areas of the United
States, went into rapid</p>
<p>economic decline in the late twenties as the coal industry, long the
state’s mainstay, began to</p>
<p>shrink. The decline of the coal industry was hastened by rising
concern with mine accidents and</p>
<p>miners diseases. For many of the coal mines of West Virginia were
small and marginal and could</p>
<p>not afford modern safety precautions or adequate health
protection.</p>
<p>By the late 1940s the leading industrial company in the state became
alarmed over the steady</p>
<p>economic shrinkage of the region. Union Carbide, one of America’s
major chemi- cal companies,</p>
<p>had its headquarters in New York. But the original plants of the
company had been based on West</p>
<p>Virginia coal, and the company was still the largest employer in the
state, other than a few large</p>
<p>coal mines. Accordingly, the company’s top management asked a group
of young engineers and</p>
<p>economists in its employ to prepare a plan for the creation of
employment opportunities in West</p>
<p>Virginia, and especially for the location of the company’s new plant
facilities in areas of major</p>
<p>unemployment in the state. For the worst afflicted area, however, the
westernmost corner of the</p>
<p>state on the border of Ohio, the planners could not come up with an
attractive project. Yet this area</p>
<p>needed jobs the most. In and around the little town of Vienna, West
Virginia, there was total</p>
<p>unemploy- ment, and no prospects for new industries. The</p>
<p>only plant that could possibly be put in the Vienna area was a
ferroalloy plant using a process that</p>
<p>had already become obsolete and had heavy cost disadvantages compared
to more modern</p>
<p>processes such as Union Car- bide’s competitors were already
using.</p>
<p>Even for the old process, Vienna was basically an uneconomical
location. The process required</p>
<p>very large amounts of coal of fair quality. But the only coal
available within the area was coal of</p>
<p>such high sulfur content that it could not be used without expensive
treatment and scrubbing. Even</p>
<p>then—that is, after heavy capital investment—the process was
inherently noisy and dirty, releasing</p>
<p>large amounts of fly ash and of noxious gases.</p>
<p>In addition, the only transportation facilities, both rail and road,
were not in West Virignia but across</p>
<p>the river, on the Ohio side. Putting the plant there, however, meant
that the prevailing westerly</p>
<p>winds would blow the soot from the smokestacks and the sul- fur
released by the power plants</p>
<p>directly into the town of Vienna, on the other bank of the river.</p>
<p>Yet the Vienna plant would provide 1,500 jobs in Vienna itself and
another 500 to 1,000 jobs in a</p>
<p>new coal field not too far distant. In addition, the new coal field
would be capable of being stripmined, so the new mining jobs would be
free from the accident and health hazards that had</p>
<p>become increasingly serious in the old and worked-out coal mines of
the area. Union Carbide top</p>
<p>management came to the conclusion that social responsi- bility
demanded building the new plant,</p>
<p>despite its marginal economics.</p>
<p>The plant was built with the most up-to-date antipollution equipment
known at the time. Whereas</p>
<p>even big-city power stations were then content to trap half the fly
ash es- caping their</p>
<p>smokestacks, the Vienna plant installed scrubbers to catch 75
percent— though there was little</p>
<p>anyone could do about the sulfur dioxide fumes emitted by the
high-sulfur coal.</p>
<p>When the plant was opened in 1951, Union Carbide was the hero.
Politicians, public figures,</p>
<p>educators, all praised the company for its social responsibility. But
ten years later the former savior</p>
<p>was fast becoming the public enemy. As the nation became
pollutionconscious, the citizens of Vienna began to complain more and
more bitterly about the ash, the</p>
<p>soot, and the fumes that floated across the river into their town and
homes. About 1961 a new</p>
<p>mayor was elected on the platform “fight pollution,” which meant
“fight Un- ion Carbide.” Ten years</p>
<p>later the plant had become a “national scandal.” Even Business
Week—hardly a publication hostile</p>
<p>to business—chastised Union Carbide (in February, 1971) in an article
entitled “A Corporate Polluter</p>
<p>Learns the Hard Way.”</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Union Carbide’s management did not behave
very intelli- gently. They</p>
<p>should have realized in the early sixties that they were in trouble,
rather than delay and</p>
<p>procrastinate, make and then break promises—until the citizens, the
state gov- ernment, the press,</p>
<p>the environmentalists, and the federal government all were aiming
their biggest guns at the</p>
<p>company. It was not very smart to protest for years that there was
nothing wrong with the plant and</p>
<p>then, when governmental authorities began to get nasty, announce that
the plant would have to be</p>
<p>closed as it could not be brought up to environ- mental
standards.</p>
<p>Yet this is not the basic lesson of this cautionary tale. Once the
decision had been made to employ</p>
<p>an obsolescent process and to build an economically marginal plant
in</p>
<p>order to alleviate unemployment in a bitterly depressed area, the
rest followed more or less</p>
<p>automatically. This decision meant that the plant did not generate
the revenues needed to be</p>
<p>rebuilt. There is very little doubt that on economic reasoning alone
the plant would never have been</p>
<p>built. Public opinion forced Union Carbide to invest substantial sums
in that plant to remedy the</p>
<p>worst pollution problems—though it is questionable whether the
technology exists to do more than</p>
<p>a patch-up job. Publicity also forced Union Carbide to keep the plant
open. But, once the spotlight</p>
<p>shifts elsewhere, most of the jobs in the Vienna, West Virginia,
plant are likely to disappear again, if</p>
<p>indeed the plant re- mains open at all.</p>
