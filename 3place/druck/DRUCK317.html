<h4 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h4>
<p>张无忌的高光时刻</p>
<p>武侠小说是成人的童话，成人看童话图的就是一个字：爽。所以，武侠小说也可以说是爽文。</p>
<p>而作为爽文，主角的高光时刻是必不可少的。</p>
<p>所谓的高光时刻，就是主角高大光辉的时刻，如乔峰的“乔峰拜庄”，如令狐冲的“吴天德”阶段，如韦小</p>
<p>宝的“沐王府”阶段，如杨过的“风陵渡”阶段。这些时候，一直饱受各种磨难的主角终于扬眉吐气，成为</p>
<p>众人眼中的中心。当读者代入时，会得到极大的满足感，和爽的感觉。</p>
<p>那么，张无忌的高光时刻是什么时候呢？</p>
<p>同学们说：“当然是光明顶啦，在光明顶，武功初成的张无忌独自力抗六大派，最后赢得了明教教主的</p>
<p>称呼，姥爷，舅舅都向他下跪。”</p>
<p>有的说是在武当山：“张无忌几分钟内学会了太极拳，有当着众人面学会了太极剑，打败了几乎当世所</p>
<p>有高手。表现除了强大的学习能力和武力”</p>
<p>这两个桥段读起来都很爽，我每次读的时候也会觉得儿很爽，有时还会特意翻到那里去看一看过瘾。</p>
<p>后来，我读了德鲁克后，发现了张无忌的第三个高光时刻，而且我还认为，这才是张无忌真正的高光</p>
<p>时刻。</p>
<p>这就是张无忌成为教主之后。咱们看看张无忌成为教主，外公舅舅向他行礼后，他做了那些事。</p>
<p>像所有的继位一样，张无忌也推让了三次，然后就“勉为其难”接受了教主之位。接任教主之位后，张</p>
<p>无忌做的第一件事就是约法三章：</p>
<p>第一条：教众需要行侠仗义，不得随意伤人</p>
<p>第二条：和中原各派修好，尽释前嫌，不在寻仇</p>
<p>第三条：依阳前教主之命，赴海外迎接谢法王就任教主</p>
<p>别小看这三条，这三条完成了教主，也就是明教的真实管理者的一个基本职责：定目标。</p>
<p>何为教主？也就是一教之主，既然是一教之主，那么，我说的你们就要听，不然还成什么一教之主。</p>
<p>所以，初成教主的张无忌马上就给明教定了一系列目标：行侠仗义、尽释前嫌、迎接谢法王等等等</p>
<p>等。</p>
<p>有了这些目标有，大家就知道这些目标是谁定的了。也就知道真正的管理者，也就是老大是谁了。</p>
<p>接下来呢？</p>
<p>那就是管理者的另一个职责：组织和安排。张无忌带着五散人等去海外迎接谢逊，安排杨逍留在光明</p>
<p>顶守卫。这是一个很常规的安排。不过，这个安排并不好，因为光明顶本来就是杨逍守着，而五散人</p>
<p>和杨逍打架失败就离开了光明顶，之后就很少上来了。</p>
<p>如何改变这种情况呢？这时就需要沟通了。简单沟通后，张无忌随身决定带杨逍离开光明顶，而留下</p>
<p>对自己有功的五散人的老大冷谦在光明顶守卫。对于五散人来说，这是升职和重用，而对于杨逍来</p>
<p>说，陪伴在教主身边也是非常适合的。皆大欢喜。毕竟，激励和沟通也是管理者最基本的职责。</p>
<p>接下来呢？就是考核了。管理者应该对自己的下属非常了解，并且根据下属的特性来安排工作。当张</p>
<p>无忌发现少林被攻破，而敌人正在进攻武当后，随即计划第一时间赶到武当。</p>
<p>这时，张无忌做了一个工作上的安排：自己和青翼蝠王韦一笑作为先头部队赶往武当，杨逍和殷天正</p>
<p>随后赶来。</p>
<p>这是一个看起来很自然的安排：韦一笑武功虽然低于杨逍和殷天正，轻功确高，可以尽快赶到武当，</p>
<p>或者送信，或者救援，都可以起到一些帮助。</p>
<p>最后，作为管理者，最重要的肯定是培养人了。在一个公司了，每个人都有自己的工作目标，有的的</p>
<p>车，有的是人，有的是火柴盒，而管理者，他的工作目标是人，包括自己的人。</p>
<p>既然工作标的是人，那么管理者就要对人的能力负责。所以，张无忌自己的身体还没好，就着急着要</p>
<p>给明教的各级别人物治病：</p>
<p>在秘道中过了七八日，张无忌的剑创已好了九成，结了个寸许长的疤，当即为受了外伤的弟兄治疗，</p>
<p>虽药物多缺，但他针灸推拿，当真着手成春。</p>
<p>然后也帮韦一笑治疗了吸血的问题。</p>
<p>当然，自己也在飞速成长着：学习太极剑、太极拳，还跟着太师父学习了很多其他的武功。</p>
<p>通过这些基本动作，张无忌从一个临危授命的少年，一举成为明教的真正教主。</p>
<p>而我认为，这些不经意间的安排、动作，才是张无忌的高光时刻。而且，这个高光时刻是得到张三丰</p>
<p>认证的：</p>
<p>张三丰初时还疑心他小小年纪，如何能统率群豪，此刻见他发号施令，殷天正等武林大豪竟一一凛</p>
<p>遵，心下什喜，暗想：“他能学到我的太极拳、太极剑，只不过是内功底子好、悟性强，虽属难</p>
<p>能，还不算是如何可贵。但他能管束明教、天鹰教这些大魔头，引得他们走上正途，那才是了不起</p>
<p>的大事呢。嘿，翠山有后，翠山有后！”想到这里，忍不住捋须微笑。</p>

<h3 id="action-point">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Manage by setting objectives and organizing, motivating,
communicating with, measuring, and</p>
<p>developing people, including yourself.</p>
<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Work of the Manager</p>
<p>Most managers spend most of their time on things that are not
“managing.” A sales manager</p>
<p>makes a statistical analysis or placates an important customer. A
foreman repairs a tool or fills out a</p>
<p>production report. A manufacturing manager designs a new plant layout
or tests new materials. A</p>
<p>company president works through the details of a bank loan or
negotiates a big contract—or</p>
<p>spends hours presiding at a dinner in honor of long-service
employees. All these things pertain to a</p>
<p>particular function. All are necessary and have to be done well.</p>
<p>But they are apart from the work which every manager does whatever
his function or</p>
<p>activity, whatever his rank and position, work which is common to all
managers and peculiar to</p>
<p>them. We can apply to the job of the manager the systematic analysis
of scientific management.</p>
<p>We can isolate that which a man does because he is a manager. We can
di- vide it into its</p>
<p>constituent operations. And a man can improve his performance as a
man- ager by improving his</p>
<p>performance of these constituent activities.</p>
<p>There are five basic operations in the work of the manager. Together
they result in the integration</p>
<p>of resources into a viable growing organism.</p>
<p>A manager, in the first place, sets objectives. He determines what
the objectives should be. He</p>
<p>determines what the goals in each area of objectives should be. He
decides what has to be done to</p>
<p>reach these objectives. He makes the objectives effective by
communicating them to the people</p>
<p>whose performance is needed to attain them.</p>
<p>Second, a manager organizes. He analyzes the activities, decisions,
and relations needed. He</p>
<p>classifies the work. He divides it into manageable activities and
further divides the activities into</p>
<p>manageable jobs. He groups these units and jobs into an organization
structure. He selects people</p>
<p>for the management of these units and for the jobs to be done.</p>
<p>Next, a manager motivates and communicates. He makes a team out of
the people that are</p>
<p>responsible for various jobs. He does that through the practices with
which he works. He does it in</p>
<p>his own relations to the men with whom he works. He does it through
his “people decisions” on</p>
<p>pay, placement, and promotion. And he does it through constant
communication, to and from his</p>
<p>subordinates, and to and from his superior, and to and from his
colleagues.</p>
<p>The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement.
The manager establishes yar</p>
<p>dsticks—and few factors are as important to the performance of the
organization and</p>
<p>of every man in it. He sees to it that each man has measurements
available to him which are</p>
<p>focused on the performance of the whole organization and which, at
the same time, focus on the</p>
<p>work of the individual and help him do it. He analyzes, appraises,
and</p>
<p>interprets performance. As in all other areas of his work, he
communicates the meaning of the</p>
<p>measurements and their findings to his subordinates, to his
superiors, and to colleagues.</p>
<p>Finally, a manager develops people, including himself.</p>
<p>Every one of these categories can be divided further into
subcategories, and each of the</p>
<p>subcategories could be discussed in a book of its own. Moreover,
every category requires different</p>
<p>qualities and qualifications.</p>
<p>Setting objectives, for instance, is a problem of balances: a balance
between business results and</p>
<p>the realization of the principles one believes in; a balance between
the imme- diate needs of the</p>
<p>business and those of the future; a balance between desirable ends
and available means. Setting</p>
<p>objectives clearly requires analytical and synthesizing ability.</p>
<p>Organizing, too, requires analytical ability. For it demands the most
economical use of scarce</p>
<p>resources. But it deals with human beings, and therefore stands under
the principle of justice and</p>
<p>requires integrity. Analytical ability and integrity are similarly
required for the development</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>The skill needed for motivating and communicating is primarily
social. Instead of analysis,</p>
<p>integration and synthesis are needed. Justice dominates as the
principle, econ- omy is secondary.</p>
<p>And integrity is of much greater importance than analytical
ability.</p>
<p>Measuring requires, first and foremost, analytical ability. But it
also demands that measurement be</p>
<p>used to make self-control possible rather than abused to control
people from the outside and</p>
<p>above—that is, to dominate them. It is the common violation of this
principle that largely explains</p>
<p>why measurement is the weakest area in the work of the manager today.
As long as measurements</p>
<p>are abused as a tool of control (for instance, as when measurements
are used as a weapon of an</p>
<p>internal secret police that supplies audits and critical appraisals
of a manager’s performance to the</p>
<p>boss without even sending a carbon copy to the manager himself)
measuring will remain the</p>
<p>weakest area in the man- ager’s performance.*</p>
<p>Setting objectives, organizing, motivating and communicating,
measuring, and devel- oping people</p>
<p>are formal, classifying categories. Only a manager’s experience can
bring them to life, concrete</p>
<p>and meaningful. But because they are formal, they apply to every
manager and to everything he</p>
<p>does as a manager. They can therefore be used by every</p>
<p>manager to appraise his own skill and performance and to work
systematically on improv- ing</p>
<p>himself and his performance as a manager.</p>
<p>Being able to set objectives does not make a man a manager, any more
than the ability to tie a</p>
<p>small knot in a confined space makes a man a surgeon. But without
ability to set objectives a man</p>
<p>cannot be an adequate manager, just as a man cannot do good surgery
without tying small knots.</p>
<p>And as a surgeon becomes a better surgeon by improving his knot-tying
skill, so a manager</p>
<p>becomes a better manager by improving his skill and per- formance in
all categories of his work.</p>
<p>The Manager’s Resource: Man</p>
<p>The manager works with a specific resource: man. And the human being
is a unique re- source</p>
<p>requiring peculiar qualities in whoever attempts to work with it.</p>
<p>“Working” the human being always means developing him. The direction
which this development</p>
<p>takes decides whether the human being—both as a man and as a
resource— will become more</p>
<p>productive or cease, ultimately, to be productive at all. This
applies, as cannot be emphasized too</p>
<p>strongly, not alone to the man who is being managed but also to the
manager. Whether he</p>
<p>develops his subordinates in the right direction, helps them to grow
and become bigger and richer</p>
<p>persons, will directly determine whether he himself will develop,
will grow or wither, become richer</p>
<p>or become impoverished, improve or deteriorate.</p>
<p>One can learn certain skills in managing people—for instance, the
skill to lead a con- ference or to</p>
<p>conduct an interview. One can set down practices that are conducive
to de- velopment—in the</p>
<p>structure of the relationship between manager and subordinate, in a
promotion system, in the</p>
<p>rewards and incentives of an organization. But when all is said and
done, developing men still</p>
<p>requires a basic quality in the manager which cannot be</p>
<p>created by supplying skills or by emphasizing the importance of the
task. It requires integrity</p>
<p>of character.</p>
<p>There is tremendous stress these days on liking people, helping
people, getting along with people,</p>
<p>as qualifications for a manager. These alone are never enough. In
every suc- cessful organization</p>
<p>there is one boss who does not like people, who does not help them,
and who does not get along</p>
<p>with them. Cold, unpleasant, demanding, he often teaches and develops
more men than anyone</p>
<p>else. He commands more respect than the most likable man ever could.
He demands exacting</p>
<p>workmanship of himself as well as of his men. He sets high standards
and expects that they will be</p>
<p>lived up to. He considers only what is right and never who is right.
And though often himself a man</p>
<p>of brilliance, he never rates intellectual brilliance above integrity
in others. The manager who lacks</p>
<p>these qualities of character—no matter how likable, helpfu1, or
amiable, no matter even how</p>
<p>competent or brilliant—is a menace and should be adjudged “unfit to
be a manager and a</p>
<p>gentleman.”</p>
<p>What a manager does can be analyzed systematically. What a manager
has to be able to do can be</p>
<p>learned (though perhaps not always taught). But one quality cannot be
learned, one qualification</p>
<p>that the manager cannot acquire but must bring with him. It is not
genius; it is character.</p>

<p>Managers can improve their performance by improving</p>
<p>their performance of these constituent activities.</p>
<p>There are five basic operations in the work of the manager.</p>
<p>•Managers, in the first place, set objectives. They determine what
the</p>
<p>objectives should be. They determine what the goals in each area
of</p>
<p>objectives should be. They decide what has to be done to reach</p>
<p>these objectives. They make the objectives effective by</p>
<p>communicating them to the people whose performance is needed to</p>
<p>attain them.</p>
<p>•Second, managers organize. They analyze the activities,</p>
<p>decisions, and relations needed. They classify the work. They</p>
<p>divide it into manageable activities and further divide the</p>
