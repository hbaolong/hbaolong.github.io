<p>郭靖是如何学习的</p>
<p>郭靖是金庸笔下一个塑造非常成功的大侠，《射雕英雄传》就是一步郭靖的成长史：一个在战场出生</p>
<p>的孩子，如何从一个小屁孩成长为一代大侠的历史。</p>
<p>金庸是写武侠小说的，所以，郭靖就是一个武林人士。作为武林人士，作为一代大侠，郭靖当然要学</p>
<p>习武功了，今天咱们看看郭靖是如何学习武功的。</p>
<p>郭靖的第一个师父是哲别。哲别是个神箭手，教授了郭靖射箭，可能还有摔跤。这两个能力是草原上</p>
<p>必备的：离得近就以摔跤为主，离得远后就要靠射箭了。</p>
<p>哲别很厉害，也很会教，所以，郭靖的摔跤和射箭都不错。算一流的水平吧。</p>
<p>郭靖的第二个（批）老师是江南六怪，是六个人，六个武功不高不低的人。他们不打会教，他们的教</p>
<p>授方法大概就是演示，然后让郭靖跟着学。</p>
<p>在之后的时间年里，主要是这六个人教授郭靖武功。郭靖就那么一遍遍模仿师父们的动作。跟着六位</p>
<p>师父，郭靖学会了坚持、不放弃、用时间换成绩。</p>
<p>后来，郭靖有了第三个师父，这是一个没有拜师的师父，也就是全真教的马钰。马钰教授了他全真教</p>
<p>的入门级内功，以及轻功。</p>
<p>这时的郭靖开始触碰上乘武功。而上乘武功的学习，也让他的普通武功更有威力了。也学的更快了。</p>
<p>郭靖的第四个师父是洪七公，洪七公一上手就教他降龙十八掌的第一掌：亢龙有悔。这个是最高阶的</p>
<p>武功。郭靖也不懂，就当成越女剑这样的武功来练习。郭靖用跟江南六怪时学的坚持、努力和马钰教</p>
<p>授他的内功，很快就学会了降龙十八掌中的十五掌。</p>
<p>这时郭靖学的武功还是不多。不过，他觉得以及非常多了：短短的一个月里，自己居然学会了十五掌</p>
<p>降龙十八掌！开心之余，郭靖有点惶恐。</p>
<p>当洪七公想教授他和黄蓉暗器时，郭靖想了想，拒绝了：我先把手头这些学好
。</p>
<p>后来黄蓉要教他打狗棒法，他也拒绝了。</p>
<p>再后来，郭靖成为了黄药师的女婿，黄药师大概也会教他一些，不过，他并没有学。</p>
<p>再后来，郭靖得到了九阴真经，学习了真经后的郭靖，武学理论和武技都达到了巅峰。</p>
<p>再后来，郭靖通过自己的领悟参透了天罡北斗阵。也学习了很多武功，不过，终其一生，郭靖主要使</p>
<p>用和学习的武功还是射箭、摔跤、降龙十八掌。</p>
<p>郭靖知道，自己不适合学习太复杂的武功，这一点，让郭靖少走了很多弯路，也为他成为一代大侠做</p>
<p>好了准备。</p>

<p>Managing Oneself: How Do I Perform?</p>
<p>Perform：</p>

<p>corrupts</p>
<p>[ U C ] how well or badly you do sth; how well or badly sth works</p>
<p>V-T If someone violates an agreement, law, or promise, they break
it.</p>
<p>:V-T/V-I If someone is corrupted by something, it causes them to
become dishonest and unjust and unable to be trusted.</p>

<p>使虚弱；削弱；逐渐破坏</p>
<p>Just as different people have different strengths and weaknesses,
they also work and perform in</p>
<p>different ways.</p>
<p>For example, some people learn by reading, others by listening.</p>
<p>And few readers can become successful listeners or vice versa.</p>
<p>vice versa：</p>
<p>反过来也一样；反之亦然</p>
<p>used to say that the opposite of what you have just said is also
true</p>
<p>Learning style is just one of several factors that go into making up
a person’s work style.</p>
<p>There are other questions that must be answered.</p>
<p>Do you work best when cooperating with others, or do you achieve
results when working alone?</p>
<p>If you work best with others, is it usually as a subordinate, peer,
or supervisor?</p>
<p>Do you need a predictable, structured work environment?</p>
<p>predictable：</p>
<p>if sth is predictable , you know in advance that it will happen or
what it will be like</p>
<p>Do you thrive under pressure?</p>
<p>thrive：</p>

etc.</p>
<p>可预见的；可预料的</p>
<p>兴旺发达；繁荣；蓬勃发展；旺盛；茁壮成长</p>
<p>You also have to consider your personal values: are they comparable
to or at least compatible</p>
<p>with your strengths?</p>
<p>comparable：</p>

<dt>compatible：</dt>
<dd>

<p>If there is any conflict between your values and strengths, always
choose values.</p>
<p>Performance that violates your values corrupts, and it will
ultimately sap and destroy your</p>
<p>strengths.</p>
<p>These are just some of the questions that must be answered.</p>
<p>What is important is to figure out your unique work style.</p>
<h3 id="action-point">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Think through your work style by answering the questions in this
reading.</p>
<p>Think through your values.</p>
<p>Do not apply your strengths to a position that will destroy your
values.</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>What Are My Strengths?</p>
<p>Most people think they know what they are good at.</p>
<p>They are usually wrong.</p>
<p>People know what they are not good at more often—</p>
<p>and even there people are more often wrong than right.</p>
<p>And yet, one can only perform with one’s strengths.</p>
<p>One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let alone on something
one cannot do at all.</p>
<p>For the great majority of people, to know their strengths was
irrelevant only a few decades ago.</p>
<p>irrelevant：</p>
<dl>
<dt>无关紧要的；不相关的</dt>
<dd>
<p>(to sth/sb) not important to or connected with a situation</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>One was born into a job and into a line of work.</p>
<p>The peasant’s son became a peasant.</p>
<p>peasant：</p>
<p>(especially in the past, or in poorer countries) a farmer who owns or
rents a small piece of land</p>
<p>的）农民，小农，佃农</p>
<p>（尤指昔日或贫穷国家</p>
<p>If he was not good at being a peasant, he failed.</p>
<p>The artisan’s son was similarly going to be an artisan, and so
on.</p>
<p>But now people have choices.</p>
<p>They therefore have to know their strengths so that they can know
where they belong.</p>
<p>There is only one way to find out: The Feedback Analysis.</p>
<p>Whenever one makes a key decision, and whenever one does a key
action, one writes down what</p>
<p>one expects will happen.</p>
<p>And nine months or twelve months later one then feeds back from
results to expectations.</p>
<p>I have been doing this for some fifteen to twenty years now.</p>
<p>And every time I do it I am surprised.</p>
<p>And so is everyone who has ever done this.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new method.</p>
<p>It was invented sometime in the 14th century, by an otherwise totally
obscure German theologian.</p>
<p>Some 150 years later Jean Calvin in Geneva (1509–1564), father of
Calvinism, and Ignatius Loyola</p>
<p>(1491–1556), the founder of the Jesuit Order, quite independent of
each other, picked up the idea</p>
<p>and incorporated it into their rules for every member of their
groups, that is, for the Calvinist pastor</p>
<p>and the Jesuit priest.</p>
<p>This explains why these two new institutions (both founded in the
same year, in 1536) had come</p>
<p>within thirty years to dominate Europe: Calvinism the Protestant
north; the Jesuit Order the</p>
<p>Catholic south.</p>
<p>By that time each group contained so many thousands of members that
most of them had to be</p>
<p>ordinary rather than exceptional.</p>
<p>Many of them worked alone, if not in complete isolation.</p>
<p>Many of them had to work underground and in constant fear of
persecution.</p>
<p>Yet very few defected.</p>
<p>The routine feedback from results to expectations reaffirmed them in
their commitment.</p>
<p>It enabled them to focus on performance and results, and with it, on
achievement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, this
simple procedure will tell people</p>
<p>first where their strengths are—and this is probably the most
important thing to know about</p>
<p>oneself.</p>
<p>It will show them what they do or fail to do that deprives them of
the full yield from their strengths.</p>
<p>It will show them where they are not particularly competent.</p>
<p>And it will finally show them where they have no strengths and cannot
perform.</p>
<p>Several action conclusions follow from the feedback analysis.</p>
<p>The first, and most important, conclusion: Concentrate on your</p>
<p>strengths.</p>
<p>Place yourself where your strengths can produce performance</p>
<p>and results.</p>
<p>Second: Work on improving your strengths.</p>
<p>The feedback analysis rapidly shows where a person needs to improve
skills or has to acquire new</p>
<p>knowledge.</p>
<p>It will show where skills and knowledge are no longer adequate and
have to be updated.</p>
<p>It will also show the gaps in one’s knowledge.</p>
<p>And one can usually acquire enough of any skill or knowledge not to
be incompetent in it.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are born. But almost everyone can learn
trigonometry.</p>
<p>And the same holds for foreign languages or for major disciplines,
whether history or economics or</p>
<p>chemistry.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is the third conclusion: the feedback
analysis soon identifies the areas</p>
<p>where intellectual arrogance causes disabling ignorance.</p>
<p>Far too many people—and especially people with high knowledge in one
area—are contemptuous</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>knowledge in other areas or believe that being “bright” is a
substitute for knowing.</p>
<p>And then the feedback analysis soon shows that a main reason for poor
performance is the result</p>
<p>of simply not knowing enough, or the result of being contemptuous of
knowledge outside one’s</p>
<p>own specialty.</p>
<p>First-rate engineers tend to take pride in not knowing anything about
people—human beings are</p>
<p>much too disorderly for the good engineering mind.</p>
<p>And accountants, too, tend to think it unnecessary to know about
people.</p>
<p>Human Resources people, by contrast, often pride themselves of their
ignorance of elementary</p>
<p>accounting or of quantitative methods altogether.</p>
<p>Brilliant executives who are being posted abroad often believe that
business skill is sufficient, and</p>
<p>dismiss learning about the history, the arts, the culture, the
traditions of the country where they are</p>
<p>now expected to perform—only to find that their brilliant business
skills produce no results.</p>
<p>One important action conclusion from the feedback analysis is</p>
<p>thus to overcome intellectual arrogance and work on acquiring</p>
<p>the skills and knowledge needed to make one’s strengths fully</p>
<p>productive.</p>
<p>An equally important action conclusion is to remedy one’s</p>
<p>bad habits—things one does or fails to do that inhibit
effectiveness</p>
<p>and performance. They quickly show up in the feedback</p>
<p>analysis.</p>
<p>The analysis may show, for instance, that a planner’s beautiful</p>
<p>plans die because he or she does not follow through.</p>
<p>Like so many brilliant people, he or she believes that ideas</p>
<p>move mountains. But bulldozers move mountains; ideas</p>
<p>show where the bulldozers have to go to work. The most</p>
<p>brilliant planners far too often stop when the plan is completed.</p>
<p>But that is when the work begins. Then the planner</p>
<p>needs to find the people to carry out the plan, explain the</p>
<p>plan to them, teach them, adapt and change the plan as it</p>
<p>moves from planning to doing and, finally, decide when to</p>
<p>stop pushing the plan.</p>
<p>But the analysis may also show that a person fails to obtain</p>
<p>results because he or she lacks manners. Bright people—especially</p>
<p>bright young people—often do not understand that manners</p>
<p>are the “lubricating oil” of an organization.</p>
<p>It is a Law of Nature that two moving bodies in contact</p>
<p>with each other create friction. Two human beings in contact</p>
<p>with each other therefore always create friction. And</p>
<p>then manners are the lubricating oil that enables these two</p>
<p>moving bodies to work together, whether they like each</p>
<p>other or not—simple things like saying “please” and</p>
<p>“thank you” and knowing a person’s birthday or name, and</p>
<p>remembering to ask after the person’s family. If the analysis</p>
<p>shows that brilliant work fails again and again as soon</p>
<p>as it requires cooperation by others, it probably indicates a</p>
<p>lack of courtesy, that is, of manners.</p>
<p>Managing Oneself 167</p>
<p>The next action conclusion from the feedback analysis is what</p>
<p>not to do.</p>
<p>Feeding back from results to expectations soon shows where</p>
<p>a person should not try to do anything at all. It shows the areas
in</p>
<p>which a person lacks the minimum endowment needed—and</p>
<p>there are always many such areas for any person. Not enough</p>
<p>people have even one first-rate skill or knowledge area, but all
of</p>
<p>us have an infinite number of areas in which we have no talent,</p>
<p>no skill and little chance to become even mediocre. And in these</p>
<p>areas a person—and especially a knowledge worker—should not</p>
<p>take on work, jobs, assignments.</p>
<p>The final action conclusion is to waste as little effort as
possible</p>
<p>on improving areas of low competence. Concentration should</p>
<p>be on areas of high competence and high skill. It takes far more</p>
<p>energy and far more work to improve from incompetence to low</p>
<p>mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance
to</p>
<p>excellence. And yet most people—and equally most teachers and</p>
<p>most organizations—try to concentrate on making an incompetent</p>
<p>person into a low mediocrity. The energy and resources—and</p>
<p>time—should instead go into making a competent person into a</p>
<p>star performer.</p>
<p>How Do I Perform?</p>
<p>How Do I Perform? is as important a question—and especially for
knowledge workers—as What Are</p>
<p>My Strengths?</p>
<p>In fact, it may be an even more important question.</p>
<p>Amazingly few people know how they get things done.</p>
<p>On the contrary, most of us do not even know that different people
work and perform differently.</p>
<p>They therefore work in ways that are not their ways— and that almost
guarantees nonperformance.</p>
<p>The main reason perhaps that so many people do not know how they
perform is that the schools</p>
<p>throughout history insisted out of necessity on there being only one
way for everybody to do his or</p>
<p>her schoolwork.</p>
<p>The teacher who ran a classroom of forty youngsters simply did not
have the time to find out how</p>
<p>each of the students performed.</p>
<p>The teacher, on the contrary, had to insist that all do the same
work, the same way, the same time.</p>
<p>And so historically everybody grew up with one way of doing the
work.</p>
<p>Here perhaps is where the new technology may have the greatest and
most beneficial impact.</p>
<p>It should enable even the merely competent teacher to find out how a
student learns and then to</p>
<p>encourage the student to do the work the way that fits the individual
student.</p>
<p>Like one’s strengths, how one performs is individual.</p>
<p>It is personality.</p>
<p>Whether personality be “nature” or “nurture,” it surely is formed
long before the person goes to</p>
<p>work.</p>
<p>And how a person performs is a “given,” just as what a person is good
at or not good at is a “given.”</p>
<p>It can be modified, but it is unlikely to be changed.</p>
<p>And just as people have results by doing what they are good at,
people have results by performing</p>
<p>how they perform.</p>
<p>The feedback analysis may indicate that there is something amiss in
how one performs.</p>
<p>But rarely does it identify the cause.</p>
<p>It is, however, normally not too difficult to find out.</p>
<p>It takes a few years of work experience.</p>
<p>And then one can ask—and quickly answer—how one performs.</p>
<p>For a few common personality traits usually determine how one
achieves results.</p>
<p>Am I a Reader or a Listener?</p>
<p>The first thing to know about how one performs is whether one is a
reader or a listener.</p>
<p>Yet very few people even know that there are readers and there are
listeners, and that very few</p>
<p>people are both.</p>
<p>Even fewer know which of the two they themselves are.</p>
<p>But a few examples will show how damaging it is not to know.</p>
<p>When he was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Europe,
General Dwight (Ike) Eisenhower</p>
<p>was the darling of the press, and attendance at one of his press
conferences was considered a rare</p>
<p>treat.</p>
<p>These conferences were famous for their style, for Eisenhower’s total
command of whatever</p>
<p>question was being asked and, equally, for his ability to describe a
situation or to explain a policy in</p>
<p>two or three beautifully polished and elegant sentences.</p>
<p>Ten years later, President Eisenhower was held in open contempt by
his former admirers.</p>
<p>They considered him a buffoon.</p>
<p>He never, they complained, even addressed himself to the question
asked, but rambled on</p>
<p>endlessly about something else.</p>
<p>And he was constantly ridiculed for butchering the King’s English in
his incoherent and</p>
<p>ungrammatical answers.</p>
<p>Yet Eisenhower had owed his brilliant earlier career in large measure
to a virtuoso performance as a</p>
<p>speechwriter for General MacArthur, one of the most demanding
stylists in American public life.</p>
<p>The explanation: Eisenhower apparently did not know himself that he
was a reader and not a</p>
<p>listener.</p>
<p>When he was Commander-in-Chief in Europe, his aides made sure that
every question from the</p>
<p>press was handed in in writing at least half an hour before the
conference began.</p>
<p>And then Eisenhower was in total command.</p>
<p>When he became President he succeeded two listeners, Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Harry Truman.</p>
<p>Both men knew this and both enjoyed free-for-all press
conferences.</p>
<p>Roosevelt know himself to be so much of a listener that he insisted
that everything first be read out</p>
<p>loud to him—only then did he look at anything in writing.</p>
<p>And when Truman realized, after becoming President, that he needed to
learn about foreign and</p>
<p>military affairs—neither of which he had ever been much interested in
before—he arranged for his</p>
<p>two ablest Cabinet members, General Marshall and Dean Acheson, to
give him a daily tutorial in</p>
<p>which each delivered a forty-minute spoken presentation, after which
the President asked</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>Eisenhower, apparently, felt that he had to do what his two famous
predecessors had done.</p>
<p>As a result, he never even heard the question the journalists
asked.</p>
<p>And he was not even an extreme case of a nonlistener.</p>
<p>A few years later Lyndon Johnson destroyed his Presidency, in large
measure, by not knowing that</p>
<p>he—unlike Eisenhower—was a listener.</p>
<p>His predecessor, John Kennedy, who knew that he was a reader, had
assembled as his assistants a</p>
<p>brilliant group of writers such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the
historian, and Bill Moyers, a first-rate</p>
<p>journalist.</p>
<p>Kennedy made sure that they first wrote to him before discussing
their memos in person.</p>
<p>Johnson kept these people as his staff—and they kept on writing.</p>
<p>He never, apparently, got one word of what they wrote.</p>
<p>Yet, as a senator, Johnson, only four years earlier, had been superb;
for parliamentarians have,</p>
<p>above all, to be listeners.</p>
<p>Only a century ago very few people, even in the most highly developed
country, knew whether they</p>
<p>were right-handed or lefthanded.</p>
<p>Left-handers were suppressed. Few actually became competent
right-handers. Most of them</p>
<p>ended up as incompetent no-handers and with severe emotional damage
such as stuttering.</p>
<p>But only one of every ten human beings is left-handed.</p>
<p>The ratio of listeners to readers seems, however, to be close to
fiftyfifty.</p>
<p>Yet, just as few left-handers became competent right-handers, few
listeners can be made, or can</p>
<p>make themselves, into competent readers—and vice versa.</p>
<p>The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the
fate of Lyndon Johnson, while the</p>
<p>reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight
Eisenhower.</p>
<p>They will not perform or achieve.</p>
<p>How Do I Learn?</p>
<p>The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one
learns.</p>
<p>There things may be even worse than they are in respect to readers
and listeners.</p>
<p>For schools everywhere are organized on the assumption that there is
one right way to learn, and</p>
<p>that it is the same way for everybody.</p>
<p>Many first-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do
poorly in school, and they tend</p>
<p>to remember their school as pure torture.</p>
<p>Yet few of their classmates have the same memory of the same school
and the same teachers;</p>
<p>they may not have enjoyed the school very much but the worst they
suffered was boredom.</p>
<p>The explanation is that first-rate writers do not, as a rule, learn
by listening and reading.</p>
<p>They learn by writing.</p>
<p>Since this is not the way the school allows them to learn, they get
poor grades.</p>
<p>And to be forced to learn the way the school teaches is sheer hell
for them and pure torture.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of different ways in which people learn.</p>
<p>Beethoven left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks.</p>
<p>Yet he himself said that he never looked at a sketchbook when he
actually wrote his compositions.</p>
<p>When asked, “Why then, do you keep a sketchbook?” he is reported to
have answered, “If I don’t</p>
<p>write it down immediately I forget it right away. If I put it into a
sketchbook I never forget it, and I</p>
<p>never have to look it up again.”</p>
<p>Alfred Sloan—the man who built General Motors into the world’s
largest, and for sixty years the</p>
<p>world’s most successful, manufacturing company—conducted most of his
management business in</p>
<p>small and lively meetings.</p>
<p>As soon as a meeting was over, Sloan went to his office and spent
several hours composing a letter</p>
<p>to one of the meeting’s participants, in which he brought out the key
questions discussed in the</p>
<p>meeting, the issues the meeting raised, the decisions it reached and
the problems it uncovered but</p>
<p>did not solve.</p>
<p>When complimented on these letters, he is reported to have said, “If
I do not sit down immediately</p>
<p>after the meeting and think through what it actually was all about,
and then put it down in writing, I</p>
<p>will have forgotten it within twenty-four hours. That’s why I write
these letters.”</p>
<p>A chief executive officer who, in the 1950s and 1960s, converted what
was a small and mediocre</p>
<p>family firm into the world’s leading company in its industry, was in
the habit of calling his entire</p>
<p>senior staff into his office, usually once a week, having them sit in
a half-circle around his desk, and</p>
<p>then talking at them for two or three hours.</p>
<p>He very rarely asked these people for their comments or their
questions. He argued with himself.</p>
<p>He raised the possibility of a policy move—acquisition of a small and
failing company in the industry</p>
<p>that had, however, some special technology, for instance.</p>
<p>He always took three different positions on every one of these
questions: one in favor of the move,</p>
<p>one against the move and one on the conditions under which such a
move might make sense.</p>
<p>He needed an audience to hear himself talk.</p>
<p>It was the way he learned.</p>
<p>And again, while a fairly extreme case, he was by no means an unusual
one.</p>
<p>Successful trial lawyers learn the same way; so do many medical
diagnosticians.</p>
<p>There are probably half a dozen different ways to learn.</p>
<p>There are people who learn by taking copious notes—the way Beethoven
did.</p>
<p>But Alfred Sloan never took a note in a meeting, nor did the CEO
mentioned above.</p>
<p>There are people who learn by hearing themselves talk.</p>
<p>There are people who learn by writing.</p>
<p>There are people who learn by doing.</p>
<p>And in an (informal) survey I once took of professors in American
universities who successfully</p>
<p>publish scholarly books of wide appeal, I was told again and again,
“To hear myself talk is the</p>
<p>reason why I teach; because then I can write.”</p>
<p>Actually, of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, this is one
of the easiest to acquire.</p>
<p>When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most of them know it.</p>
<p>But when I then ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?” few do.</p>
<p>And yet to act on this knowledge is the key to performance—or rather
not to act on this knowledge</p>
<p>is to condemn oneself to nonperformance.</p>
<p>To ask “How do I perform?” and “How do I learn?” are the most
important first questions to ask. But</p>
<p>they are by no means the only ones.</p>
<p>To manage oneself one has to ask: “Do I work well with people, or am
I a loner?” And if one finds</p>
<p>out that one works well with people, one asks: “In what relationship
do I work well with people?”</p>
<p>Some people work best as subordinates.</p>
<p>The prime example is the great American military hero of World War
II, General George Patton.</p>
<p>He was America’s top troop commander.</p>
<p>Yet, when he was proposed for an independent command, General George
Marshall, the American</p>
<p>Chief of Staff—and probably the most successful picker of men in
American history—said: “Patton</p>
<p>is the best subordinate the American Army has ever produced, but he
would be the worst</p>
<p>commander.”</p>
<p>Some people work best as team members. Some people work exceedingly
well as coaches and</p>
<p>mentors, and some people are simply incompetent to be mentors.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know about how one performs is whether one
performs well under</p>
<p>stress, or whether one needs a highly structured and predictable
environment.</p>
<p>Another trait: Does one work best as a minnow in a big organization,
or best as a big fish in a small</p>
<p>organization? Few people work well in both ways.</p>
<p>Again and again people who have been very successful in a large
organization—for example, the</p>
<p>General Electric Company or Citibank—flounder miserably when they
move into a small</p>
<p>organization. And again and again people who perform brilliantly in a
small organization flounder</p>
<p>miserably when they take a job with a big organization.</p>
<p>Another crucial question: “Do I produce results as a decision maker
or as an adviser?” A great</p>
<p>many people perform best as advisers, but cannot take the burden and
pressure of the decision.</p>
<p>A good many people, by contrast, need an adviser to force themselves
to think, but then they can</p>
<p>take the decision and act on it with speed, self-confidence and
courage.</p>
<p>This is a reason, by the way, why the number-two person in an
organization often fails when</p>
<p>promoted into the top spot.</p>
<p>The top spot requires a decision maker.</p>
<p>Strong decision makers in the top spot often put somebody whom they
trust into the number-two</p>
<p>spot as their adviser—and in that position that person is
outstanding.</p>
<p>But when then promoted into the number-one spot, the person
fails.</p>
<p>He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot take
decision-making responsibility.</p>
<p>The action conclusion:</p>
<p>Again, do not try to change yourself— it is unlikely to be
successful.</p>
<p>But work, and hard, to improve the way you perform.</p>
<p>And try not to do work of any kind in a way you do not perform or
perform poorly.</p>
<p>What Are My Values?</p>
<p>To be able to manage oneself, one finally has to know: “What are my
values?” In respect to ethics,</p>
<p>the rules are the same for everybody, and the test is a simple one—I
call it the “mirror test.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, the most highly respected diplomatist of all the
Great Powers in the early years</p>
<p>of this century was the German Ambassador in London.</p>
<p>He was clearly destined for higher things, at least to become his
country’s</p>
<p>Foreign Minister, if not German Federal Chancellor.</p>
<p>Yet, in 1906, he abruptly resigned.</p>
<p>King Edward VII had then been on the British throne for five years,
and the diplomatic corps was</p>
<p>going to give him a big dinner.</p>
<p>The German ambassador, being the dean of the diplomatic corps—he had
been in London for close</p>
<p>to fifteen years—was to be the chairman of that dinner.</p>
<p>King Edward VII was a notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind
of dinner he wanted—at</p>
<p>the end, after the desert had been served, a huge cake was going to
appear, and out of it would</p>
<p>jump a dozen or more naked prostitutes as the lights were dimmed.</p>
<p>And the German ambassador resigned rather than preside over this
dinner.</p>
<p>“I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the morning, when I
shave.”</p>
<p>This is the mirror test.</p>
<p>What ethics requires is to ask oneself:</p>
<p>“What kind of person do I want to see when I shave myself in the
morning, or put on my lipstick in</p>
<p>the morning?” Ethics, in other words, are a clear value system. And
they do not vary much— what is</p>
<p>ethical behavior in one kind of organization or situation is ethical
behavior in another kind of</p>
<p>organization or situation.</p>
<p>But ethics are only a part of the value system and, especially, only
a part of the value system of an</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>To work in an organization the value system of which is unacceptable
to a person, or incompatible</p>
<p>with it, condemns the person both to frustration and to
nonperformance.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of values people have to learn about
themselves.</p>
<p>A brilliant and highly successful executive found herself totally
frustrated after her old company</p>
<p>was acquired by a bigger one.</p>
<p>She actually got a big promotion—and a promotion into doing the kind
of work she did best.</p>
<p>It was part of her job to select people for important positions.</p>
<p>She deeply believed that one only hired people from the outside into
important positions after</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>exhausted all inside possibilities.</p>
<p>The company in which she now found herself as a senior human
resources executive believed,</p>
<p>however, that in staffing an important position that had become
vacant, one first looked at the</p>
<p>outside, “to bring in fresh blood.”</p>
<p>There is something to be said for either way (though, in my
experience, the proper one is to do</p>
<p>some of both). But they are fundamentally incompatible, not as
policies but as values.</p>
<p>They bespeak a different view of the relationship between
organization and people; a different view</p>
<p>of the responsibility of an organization to its people and in respect
to developing them; a different</p>
<p>view in what is the most important contribution of a person to an
enterprise, and so on.</p>
<p>After several years of frustration, the human resources executive
quit, at considerable financial loss</p>
<p>to herself.</p>
<p>Her values and the values of the organization simply were not
compatible.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether to try to obtain results in a pharmaceutical
company by making constant, small</p>
<p>improvements, or by occasional, highly expensive and risky
“breakthroughs” is not primarily an</p>
<p>economic question.</p>
<p>The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>It is at bottom a conflict of values—between a value system that sees
the contribution of a</p>
<p>pharmaceutical company to help the already successful physician to do
better what he or she</p>
<p>already does well, and a value system that is “science” oriented.</p>
<p>It is similarly a value question whether a business should be run for
short-term results or for “the</p>
<p>long run.” Financial analysts believe that businesses can be run for
both, simultaneously.</p>
<p>Successful businessmen know better.</p>
<p>To be sure, everyone has to produce short-term results.</p>
<p>But in any conflict between shortterm results and long-term growth,
one company decides in favor</p>
<p>of long-term growth; another company decides such a conflict in favor
of short-term results.</p>
<p>Again, this is not primarily a disagreement on economics.</p>
<p>It is fundamentally a value conflict regarding the function of a
business and the responsibility of</p>
<p>management.</p>
<p>In one of the fastest-growing pastoral churches in the United States,
success is being measured by</p>
<p>the number of new parishioners.</p>
<p>It is believed that what matters is how many people join, and become
regular churchgoers, who</p>
<p>never before came to church. The Good Lord, this church believes,
will then take care of the</p>
<p>spiritual needs of a sufficient number.</p>
<p>Another pastoral, evangelical church believes that what matters is
the spiritual experience of</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>It will ease out newcomers who join the church but who then do not
enter into the spiritual life of</p>
<p>the church.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At first glance it appears
that the second church grows more</p>
<p>slowly.</p>
<p>But it retains a far larger proportion of newcomers than the first
one does.</p>
<p>Its growth, in other words, is far more solid.</p>
<p>This is also not a theological problem, or only secondarily so. It is
a value problem.</p>
<p>One of the two pastors said in a public debate, “Unless you first
come to church you will never find</p>
<p>the Gate to the Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>
<p>“No,” answered the other one. “Until you first look for the Gate to
the Kingdom of Heaven, you</p>
<p>don’t belong in church.”</p>
<p>Organizations have to have values.</p>
<p>But so do people.</p>
<p>To be effective in an organization, one’s own values must be
compatible with the organization’s</p>
<p>values.</p>
<p>They do not need to be the same.</p>
<p>But they must be close enough so that they can coexist.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the person will be frustrated, but also the person will
not produce results.</p>
<p>What to Do in a Value Conflict?</p>
<p>There rarely is a conflict between a person’s strengths and the way
that person performs.</p>
<p>The two are complementary.</p>
<p>But there is sometimes a conflict between a person’s values and the
same person’s strengths.</p>
<p>What one does well—even very well—and successfully may not fit with
one’s value system.</p>
<p>It may not appear to that person as making a contribution and as
something to which to devote</p>
<p>one’s life (or even a substantial portion thereof).</p>
<p>If I may inject a personal note: I too, many years ago, had to decide
between what I was doing well</p>
<p>and successfully, and my values. I was doing extremely well as a
young investment banker in</p>
<p>London in the mid-1930s; it clearly fitted my strengths.</p>
<p>Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset manager of
any kind.</p>
<p>People, I realized, were my values.</p>
<p>And I saw no point in being the richest man in the cemetery.</p>
<p>I had no money, no job in a deep Depression and no prospects.</p>
<p>But I quit—and it was the right thing.</p>
<p>Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test.</p>

<h3 id="managing-oneself-how-do-i-perform">Managing Oneself: How Do I
Perform?</h3>
<p>Performance that violates your values corrupts,</p>
<p>and it will ultimately sap and destroy your strengths.</p>
<p>Just as different people have different strengths and weaknesses,
they also</p>
<p>work and perform in different ways. For example, some people learn by
reading,</p>
<p>others by listening. And few readers can become successful listen-ers
or vice</p>
<p>versa. Learning style is just one of several factors that go into
making up</p>
<p>Aperson’s work style. There are other questions that must be
an-swered. Do you</p>
<p>work best when cooperating with others, or do you achieve results
when working</p>
<p>alone? If you work best with others, is it usually as a subordinate,
peer, or</p>
<p>supervisor? Do you need a predictable, structured</p>
<p>work environment? Do you thrive under pressure?</p>
<p>You also have to consider your personal values: are they comparable
to</p>
<p>or at least compatible with your strengths? If there is any conflict
between</p>
<p>your values and strengths, always choose values. Performance that</p>
<p>violates your values corrupts, and it will ultimately sap and destroy
your</p>
<p>strengths. These are just some of the questions that must be
answered.</p>
<p>What is im-portant is to figure out your unique work style.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-1">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Think through your work style by answering the ques-</p>
<p>tions in this reading. Think through your values. Do not apply
your</p>
<p>strengths to a position that will destroy your values. Find a
position that is</p>
<p>compatible with your values.</p>
