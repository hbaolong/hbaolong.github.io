<h4 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h4>
<p>标题： 从郭靖到郭大侠</p>
<p>郭靖本来是草原上一个小伙子，学习武功本来是为了复仇（顺便替江南六怪争光）。</p>
<p>进入江湖后，郭靖先后遇到了全真教掌教马钰、九指神丐洪七公、老顽童周伯通，以及黄蓉的贴心照</p>
<p>顾。又学习了《九阴真经》里的高深武功，郭靖的武功也就一步步稳扎稳打地高了起来。到了《射雕</p>
<p>英雄传》结尾时，郭靖的武功以及非常高了。可以和五绝中的黄药师、洪七公真实打斗三百招而不</p>
<p>败。不过，这时的郭靖进入了一个武学障：武功唯一的用处就是杀人，武功越高，杀人就越厉害，可</p>
<p>是，人为什么要杀人呢？人难道不应该对别人好么？人为什么要杀人呢？</p>
<p>郭靖一直走不出这个障碍，不想杀人，想忘记武功，为了这个甚至去求死，去自杀。</p>
<p>后来丘处机让他去华山找周伯通，向周伯通学习忘记武功的方法。一向很听话的郭靖来到了华山。来</p>
<p>到华山后，周伯通可没有教他什么，反而被吓得拉了一裤子，一溜烟跑了。</p>
<p>这时，师父洪七公也来到了华山，师父见到了卖国贼裘千仞后，要杀死裘千仞。裘千仞扔出了一个诛</p>
<p>心之问：“若论动武，你们恃众欺寡，我独个儿不是对手。可是说到是非善恶，嘿嘿，裘千仞孤身在</p>
<p>此，那一位生平没杀过人、没犯过恶行错事的，就请上来动手。在下引颈就死，皱一皱眉头的也不算</p>
<p>好汉。”</p>
<p>这时，一灯大师、周伯通、郭靖、黄蓉等都无言以对，而洪七公则威风凛凛地站着石头上大喝一声：</p>
<p>“老叫化一生杀过二百三十一人，这二百三十一人个个都是恶徒，若非贪官污吏、土豪恶霸，就是大奸</p>
<p>巨恶、负义薄幸之辈。我们丐帮查得清清楚楚，证据确实，一人查过，二人再查，决无冤枉，老叫化</p>
<p>这才杀他。老叫化贪饮贪食，小事胡涂，可是生平从来没错杀过一个好人。裘千仞，你是第二百三十</p>
<p>二人！”</p>
<p>听到师父洪七公的一方言语，郭靖顿时领悟了，是呀：“只要不杀错一个好人，那就问心无愧。只要我</p>
<p>将一身武功用于仗义为善，又何须将功夫抛弃忘却？”</p>
<p>“一身好的武功，正好可以行侠仗义，为国为民做出一些贡献，为什么要忘记呢？”</p>
<p>从华山下来的郭靖突破了武学障，武功也就上了一个新的台阶，只之后的几年里，更加熟练九阴真</p>
<p>经、降龙十八掌等，成为江湖中一等一的高手。</p>
<p>下山后，郭靖和黄蓉短暂游历了一段时间，黄蓉就怀孕了。两人知道回到桃花岛过上了居家练武的日</p>
<p>子。</p>
<p>没多久，郭芙出生了，桃花岛也就热闹了起来。郭靖也尝到了做爸爸的开心和烦恼。</p>
<p>郭靖是一个随遇而安的人，不管是在江湖，还是在岛上，郭靖都可以很舒服地适应。</p>
<p>后来，岛上有来了三个孩子：杨过、武修文、武敦儒。三个孩子和郭芙一起学习武功，也把岛上搞得</p>
<p>更乱了。</p>
<p>再后来，杨过闯祸了，郭靖就把他送到了全真教学习武功，这时的郭靖才在时隔几年后再次进入武</p>
<p>林，终南山大战了全真教的天罡北斗阵，以及霍都王子。</p>
<p>这一战，郭靖大胜，郭靖也知道了自己的武功有多么的厉害。</p>
<p>再次回到桃花岛后，郭靖和黄蓉商量着，觉得自己夫妻的这么高的武功，呆在桃花岛有点浪费，应该</p>
<p>为武林、为民众做点什么。黄蓉这时还是丐帮帮主，每天都会通过丐帮的情报系统收到江湖上的各种</p>
<p>信息。</p>
<p>随着蒙古军队打败金军，金国灭完了。蒙古军队并没与收兵，而是陈兵大胜关边界，随时有南侵的迹</p>
<p>象。</p>
<p>郭靖这时不再犹豫，和黄蓉商量后，随机发出英雄帖，召集天下英雄聚集大胜关，讨论抵制蒙古军队</p>
<p>南侵的方法。</p>
<p>郭靖是一个很敦厚的人，这时的武功已经非常高了。而且，郭靖在蒙古带过军队，自己也通读岳飞的</p>
<p>《武穆遗书》，有丰富的作战经验。同时，郭靖还有黄蓉这个超级军师的辅助，还有丐帮的全力协</p>
<p>助。</p>
<p>在大胜关，英雄大会正在进行中，大家讨论着大宋和蒙古军事、政治以及武林中的各种势力。</p>
<p>这时，来了三个不请自来的客人，也就是蒙古国的护国法王金轮法王及其弟子。</p>
<p>金轮法王师徒三人武功非常高，在大胜关的英雄大会上，差点赢得了武林盟主的称号，多亏杨过师徒</p>
<p>的扰乱，才让金轮法王的阴谋没有得逞。</p>
<p>经过英雄大会后，郭靖清楚蒙古对大宋的进攻已经开始了，擅长军事的郭靖在对形势做出分析后，果</p>
<p>断带着英雄大会上的英雄们奔赴襄阳，协助襄阳守卫吕文焕守卫襄阳。众位英雄受郭靖的民族情怀感</p>
<p>召，大多随他来到了襄阳，一起守卫襄阳。</p>
<p>这一守，就是三十多年；这一守，就是一辈子；这一守，就献出了郭靖自己的生命，以及自己爱人黄</p>
<p>蓉的生命，以及自己女儿郭芙的生命，以及自己儿子郭破虏的生命，以及自己女婿耶律齐的生命。</p>
<p>襄阳城破时，郭靖带着家人死杀殉国（我更愿意说殉城）。</p>
<p>守襄阳的三十多年里，郭靖除了偶尔去了一趟华山，进过一次忽必烈的军营外，郭靖一直兢兢业业勤</p>
<p>勤恳恳用心地守护这这座城市。</p>
<p>当金轮法王绑架郭襄来威胁郭靖时，郭靖在两军之前大声喝道：“鞑子若非惧我，何须跟我小女儿为</p>
<p>难？鞑子既然惧我，郭靖有为之身，岂肯轻易就死？”</p>
<p>郭靖一直知道，守卫襄阳是他能做的最恰当的事情。首先，他的武功以及在武林的威望可以吸引很多</p>
<p>武林人士加入襄阳的守卫，大大增强襄阳守卫的力量；其次，自己精通兵法并且熟悉蒙古军队的打战</p>
<p>风格，可以相应地做出对抗；而且，最重要的是，守卫襄阳，可以守住大宋的北方大门，让襄阳南方</p>
<p>的百姓可以有太平可以享受。而这个，是郭靖从华山下来后就认识清楚的一件事：侠之大者，为国为</p>
<p>民。</p>
<p>在襄阳守卫的这三十多年里，郭靖从一个武林侠客，终于成长成为了郭大侠：</p>
<p>“当今天下豪杰，提到郭兄时都称‘郭大侠’而不名。他数十年来助守襄阳，保境安民，如此任侠，决非</p>
<p>古时朱家、郭解辈逞一时意气所能及。我说称他为‘北侠’，自当人人心服。”</p>
<p>襄阳城破两年后，元军攻破临安，南宋灭完。</p>

<p>When such opportunities do come along, it’s best to accept them if

<p>III</p>
<p>What Is My Contribution?</p>
<p>To ask “What is my contribution?” means moving from knowl- edge to
action. The question is not:</p>
<p>“What do I want to contribute?” It is not: “What am I told to
contribute?” It is: “What should I</p>
<p>contribute?”</p>
<p>This is a new question in human history. Traditionally, the task was
given. It was given either by the</p>
<p>work itself—as was the task of the peasant or the artisan. Or it was
given by a master or a mistress,</p>
<p>as was the task of the domestic ser- vant. And, until very recently,
it was taken for granted that</p>
<p>most people were subordinates who did as they were told.</p>
<p>The advent of the knowledge worker is changing this, and fast. The
first reaction to this change</p>
<p>was to look at the employ- ing organization to give the answer.</p>
<p>“Career Planning” is what the Personnel Department—espe- cially of
the large organization—</p>
<p>was supposed to do in the 1950s and 1960s, for the “Organization
Man,” the new knowledge</p>
<p>worker employee. In Japan it is still the way knowledge workers are
being managed. But even in</p>
<p>Japan the knowledge worker can increasingly expect to outlive the
employing organization.</p>
<p>Except in Japan, however, the “Organization Man” and the career-
planning Personnel Department</p>
<p>have long become history. And with them disappeared the notion that
anyone but oneself can—or</p>
<p>should—be the “career planner.” The reaction in the sixties was for
knowledge people to ask: “What</p>
<p>do I want to do?” People were told</p>
<p>that “to do one’s own thing” was the way to contribute. This was, for
instance, what the “student</p>
<p>rebellion” of 1968 believed.</p>
<p>We soon found out, however, that it was as wrong an answer as was the
Organization Man. Very</p>
<p>few of the people who believed that “doing one’s own thing” leads to
contribution, to selffulfillment or to success achieved any of the
three.</p>
<p>But still, there is no return to the old answer, that is, to do
what</p>
<p>you are being told, or what you are being assigned to. Knowledge</p>
<p>workers, in particular, will have to learn to ask: “What should MY
contribution be?” Only then</p>
<p>should they ask: “Does this fit my strengths? Is this what I want to
do?” And “Do I find this rewarding and stimulating?”</p>
<p>The best example I know of is the way Harry Truman repositioned
himself when he became</p>
<p>President of the United States, upon the sudden death of Franklin D.
Roosevelt at the end of World</p>
<p>War II. Truman had been picked for the Vice Presidency because he was
totally concerned with</p>
<p>domestic issues. For it was then generally believed that with the end
of the war—and the end was</p>
<p>clearly in sight—the U.S. would return to almost exclusive concern
with domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Truman had never shown the slightest interest in foreign affairs,
knew nothing about them, and was</p>
<p>kept in total ignorance of them.</p>
<p>He was still totally focused on domestic affairs when, within a few
weeks after his ascendancy, he</p>
<p>went to the Potsdam Conference after Germany surrendered. There he
sat for a week, with</p>
<p>Churchill on one side and Stalin on the other, and realized, to his
horror, that foreign affairs would</p>
<p>dominate, but also that he knew absolutely nothing about them. He
came back from Potsdam</p>
<p>convinced that he had to give up what he wanted to do and instead had
to concentrate on what he</p>
<p>had to do, that is, on foreign affairs. He immediately—as already
mentioned—put himself into</p>
<p>school with General Marshall and Dean Acheson as his tutors. Within
in a few months he was a</p>
<p>master of foreign affairs and he, rather than Churchill or Stalin,
created the postwar world—with his</p>
<p>policy of containing Communism and pushing it back from Iran and
Greece; with the Marshall Plan</p>
<p>that rescued Western Europe; with the decision to rebuild Japan; and
finally, with the call for</p>
<p>worldwide economic development.</p>
<p>By contrast, Lyndon Johnson lost both the Vietnam War and his
domestic policies because he</p>
<p>clung to “What do I want to do?” instead of asking himself “What
should my contribution be?”</p>
<p>Johnson, like Truman, had been entirely focused on domestic
affairs.</p>
<p>He too came into the Presidency wanting to complete what the New Deal
had left unfinished.</p>
<p>He very soon realized that the Vietnam War was what he had to
concentrate on.</p>
<p>But he could not give up what he wanted his contribution to be.</p>
<p>He splintered himself between the Vietnam War and domestic
reforms—and he lost both.</p>
<p>One more question has to be asked to decide “What should I
contribute?”: “Where and how can I</p>
<p>have results that make a difference?”</p>
<p>The answer to this question has to balance a number of things.</p>
<p>Results should be hard to achieve.</p>
<p>They should require “stretching,” to use the present buzzword.</p>
<p>But they should be within reach.</p>
<p>To aim at results that cannot be achieved—or can be achieved only
under the most unlikely</p>
<p>circumstances—is not being “ambitious.”</p>
<p>It is being foolish.</p>
<p>At the same time, results should be meaningful.</p>
<p>They should make a difference.</p>
<p>And they should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable.</p>
<p>Here is one example from a nonprofit institution.</p>
<p>A newly appointed hospital administrator asked himself the question
“What should be my</p>
<p>contribution?” The hos- pital was big and highly prestigious. But it
had been coast- ing on its</p>
<p>reputation for thirty years and had become mediocre.</p>
<p>The new hospital administrator decided that his contribution should
be to establish a standard of</p>
<p>excellence in one important area within two years.</p>
<p>And so he decided to concentrate on turning around the Emergency Room
and the Trauma Center</p>
<p>—both big, visible and sloppy.</p>
<p>The new hospital administrator thought through what to demand of an
Emergency Room, and how</p>
<p>to measure its performance.</p>
<p>He decided that every patient who came into the Emergency Room had to
be seen by a qualified</p>
<p>nurse within sixty seconds.</p>
<p>Within twelve months that hospital’s Emergency Room had become a
model for the entire United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>And its turnaround also showed that there can be standards,
discipline, measurements in a hospital</p>
<p>—and within another two years the whole hospital had been
transformed.</p>
<p>The decision “What should my contribution be?” thus balances three
elements.</p>
<p>First comes the question: “What does the situation require?”</p>
<p>Then comes the question: “How could I make the greatest contribution
with my strengths, my way</p>
<p>of performing, my values, to what needs to be done?”</p>
<p>Finally, there is the question: “What results have to be achieved to
make a difference?”</p>
<p>This then leads to the action conclusions: what to do, where to
start, how to start, what goals and</p>
<p>deadlines to set.</p>
<p>Throughout history, few people had any choices. The task was imposed
on them either by nature or</p>
<p>by a master.</p>
<p>And so, in large measure, was the way in which they were supposed to
perform the task.</p>
<p>But so also were the expected results—they were given.</p>
<p>To “do one’s own thing” is, however, not freedom. It is license. It
does not have results. It does not</p>
<p>contribute. But to start out with the question “What should I
contribute?” gives freedom. It gives</p>
<p>freedom because it gives responsibility.</p>
