<p>如何正确罢免乔峰？</p>
<p>当众位长老知道乔峰是契丹人的事实后，大家的反应是不一样的。有的人觉得，他不可能是契丹人，</p>
<p>谁要说就打死谁，这部分人以白世镜为代表；还有人觉得，乔峰是丐帮帮主，既然他是契丹人，那就</p>
<p>肯定不能做丐帮帮主了，可是又没办法和乔峰说，干脆一刀杀了得了，这部分人以吴长风为代表。</p>
<p>这两部分人的区别在于对乔峰这个人的态度，而共同点是对丐帮体系的了解，他们都知道，按丐帮体</p>
<p>系，他们没办法处理乔峰帮主的位置。</p>
<p>乔峰是丐帮帮主。丐帮不是政府，最多是一个民间组织，帮主历来由上一任帮主任命，帮主就任后，</p>
<p>其对丐帮事物则拥有最大决策权，这个权力不受任何人约束。</p>
<p>也就是说，理论上，没有任何人可以罢免乔峰的帮主之位。除非他自己不干了。</p>
<p>所以，当白世镜知道乔峰是契丹人时，他相信乔峰的为人，所以他坚决不让任何人，特别是包括乔峰</p>
<p>知道这个事情，他知道，只要更多人知道，或者乔峰知道，这个事情就是无解的。</p>
<p>而吴长风呢？当他知道乔峰是契丹人时，他坚持不相信契丹人可以做丐帮帮主，可是，他也一样没有</p>
<p>办法解除帮主之位，所以，他想到的就是“一刀杀了得了”。</p>
<p>虽然历代帮主都是优秀而杰出的人，可是，万一出现问题呢？难道就只能等着这个人自然死亡或者被</p>
<p>人杀死么？</p>
<p>其实，德鲁克给出了一个建议。这个建议是针对NPO的，也就是针对非政府，非商业话组织的。</p>
<p>丐帮帮主虽然权力很大，一句话可以调动几十万人，可，毕竟这只是一个民间组织，帮主之间私相授</p>
<p>受，也没有明确的规则，四大长老倒是各司其职，还有一个执法长老，打打杀杀，可是有一条，只要</p>
<p>你退出丐帮，丐帮就拿你没办法了。“解下袋子，你就不再是丐帮的人”。</p>
<p>这样的组织，既没有皇权的“君权神授”那一套，有没有商业机构的“利益驱动”那一套，这时，大家也就</p>
<p>是靠拳头说话，也就是老大说了算。</p>
<p>老大好的时候还好，不好的时候就麻烦了。德鲁克给的建议是什么呢？</p>
<p>德鲁克建议，对于NPO，也就是这些非商业组织，应该成立董事会，而且是强有力的董事会。这个董</p>
<p>事会负责什么呢？就是负责组织的愿景的。</p>
<p>因为，对于NPO来说，之所以能组织起来，就是因为大家有共同的愿景，比如，乞丐们之所以愿意加</p>
<p>入丐帮，能组织起来，肯定是因为不想受欺负呀。想靠近组织，被组织保护一下。</p>
<p>有了董事会后，董事会要时刻检查组织的领导，比如丐帮的帮主，是否在坚持组织的基本理念：保护</p>
<p>帮众不被人欺负。如果是，那就相安无事，如果董事会发现丐帮帮主不保护自己的弟子，反而袒护外</p>
<p>人，那就要对这个帮主质问，让他给出解释，如果解释不通，就可以罢免。</p>
<p>比如，如果乔峰真的不愿意给马大元报仇，董事会就应该出面和乔峰谈判，如果发现乔峰确实没有尽</p>
<p>到保护自己弟子的职责，那就要罢免吧。发个公告就好了，也不用动手。也免得流血、死人。</p>
<p>这和乔峰是不是契丹人都没什么关系了。</p>
<p>比如下一个帮主，游坦之，就是一个小混蛋，可以，吴长老见了他还是一点办法没有，还得对他行</p>
<p>礼，最后还是被游坦之打死了，遗憾。要是有罢免的机制的话，只需要董事会开个会，就搞定了。吴</p>
<p>长老也就不会死了，而游坦之也不用怕。</p>
<p>哎，可惜了乔峰，可惜了游坦之。</p>

<p>31 OCTOBER</p>
<p>Effective Nonprofit Boards of Directors</p>
<p>Boards：</p>
<p>Membership on this board is not power; it is responsibility.</p>
<p>To be effective, a nonprofit needs a strong board, but a board that
does the board’s work.</p>
<p>The board not only helps think through the institution’s mission, it
is the guardian of that mission</p>
<p>and makes sure the organization lives up to its basic mission.</p>
<p>The board has the responsibility of making sure the nonprofit has
competent management—and</p>
<p>the right management.</p>
<p>competent：having enough skill or knowledge to do sth well or to the
necessary standard 足以胜任</p>
<p>的；有能力的；称职的</p>
<p>The board’s role is to appraise the performance of the
organization.</p>
<p>appraise：( formal ) to consider or examine sb/sth and form an
opinion about them or it 估量；估价</p>
<p>The board is also the premier fund-raising organ of a nonprofit
organization.</p>
<p>Over the door to the nonprofit’s boardroom there should be an
inscription in big letters that says:</p>
<p>MEMBERSHIP ON THIS BOARD IS NOT POWER; IT IS RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
<p>Board membership means responsibility not just to the organization
but to the board itself, to, the</p>
<p>staff, and to the institution’s mission.</p>
<p>A common problem is the badly split board.</p>
<p>Every time an issue comes up, the board members fight out their basic
policy rift.</p>
<p>rift：a serious disagreement between people that stops their
relationship from continuing 分裂；分</p>
<p>歧；严重不和</p>
<p>fight out：以斗争解决</p>
<p>This is much more likely in nonprofit institutions precisely because
the mission is, and should be,</p>
<p>so important.</p>
<p>precisely：exactly 准确地；恰好地</p>
<p>The role of the board then becomes both more important and more
controversial.</p>
<p>controversial：causing a lot of angry public discussion and
disagreement 引起争论的；有争议的</p>
<p>At that point, teamwork between the chairperson and chief executive
officer becomes absolutely</p>
<p>vital.</p>
<p>vital：~ (for/to sth) necessary or essential in order for sth to
succeed or exist 必不可少的；对…极重</p>
<p>要的</p>
<h3 id="action-point">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Have you served on one or more nonprofit organization boards?</p>
<p>Have these boards helped fulfill the nonprofit’s mission or
frustrated the mission?</p>
<p>frustrated：( of an emotion 情感 ) having no effect; not being
satisfied 无效的；没有得到满足的</p>
<p>Managing the Non-Profit Organization</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Key Relationships</p>
<p>One of the most basic differences between non-profit organizations
and businesses is that the typical non-profit</p>
<p>has so many more relationships that are vitally important. In all but
the very biggest businesses, the key</p>
<p>relationships are few</p>
<p>一 employees, customers, and owners, and that’s it. Every non-profit
organization has a</p>
<p>multitude of constituencies and has to work out the relationship with
each of them.</p>
<p>Begin with the board. In most businesses, boards take little interest
in the company until there is a crisis. In the</p>
<p>typical non-profit organization, on the other hand, the board is
deeply committed. Indeed, non-profit executives</p>
<p>and staff often complain that the board is too much concerned with
managing, and that the line between board</p>
<p>function and management is constantly being violated. They complain
that the board ’meddles/</p>
<p>To be effective, a non-profit needs a strong board, but a board that
does the board’s work. The board not only</p>
<p>helps think through the institution’s mission, it is the guardian of
that mission, and makes sure the organization</p>
<p>lives up to its basic commitment. The board has the job of making
sure the non-profit has competent</p>
<p>management</p>
<p>一 and the right management. The board’s role is to appraise the
performance of the organization.</p>
<p>And in a crisis, the board members may have to be firefighters.</p>
<p>The board is also the premier fund-raising organ of a non-profit
organization</p>
<p>一 one important role it does not</p>
<p>have in the for-profit business. If a board doesn’t actively lead in
fund development, it’s very hard to get the</p>
<p>funds the organization needs. Personally, I like a board that not
only gets other people to give money but whose</p>
<p>members put the organization first and foremost on their own list of
donations.</p>
<p>A board that understands its real obligations and sets goals for its
own performance won’t meddle. But if you</p>
<p>leave the board’s role open and undefined, you’ll get one that
interferes with details and yet doesn’t do its job.</p>
<p>Wherever I’ve seen a non-profit institution with a strong board that
gives the right kind of leadership, it</p>
<p>represented very hard work on the part of the chief executive officer
- not only to bring the right people onto the</p>
<p>board but to meld them into a team and point them in the right
direction. In my experience, the chief executive</p>
<p>officer is the conscience of the board. That may explain why the
strong, effective boards I’ve seen are almost all</p>
<p>boards where members come on through a nominating process. I very
rarely have seen a truly strong board in</p>
<p>co-ops, for instance, where boards are elected by the membership.
There the chairperson has no say about who</p>
<p>sits on the board, nor has the CEO. Then you get boards which may
represent this or that segment of the</p>
<p>membership, but they don’t represent the organization, at least in my
experience. Problems are likely to arise on</p>
<p>these boards, such as the troublemakers who abuse the board to create
a political platform for themselves or just</p>
<p>to hear themselves talk.</p>
<p>Over the door to the non-profit’s boardroom there should be an
inscription in big letters that says: Membership</p>
<p>on this board is not power, it is responsibility. Some non-profit
board members still feel that they are there for</p>
<p>the same reason they used to go on hospital boards in the old
days</p>
<p>一 recognition by the community 一 rather</p>
<p>than because of a commitment to service. Board membership means
responsibility not just to the organization</p>
<p>but to the board itself, to the staff, and to the institution’s
mission.</p>
<p>Which brings up a very controversial question, that of an age limit.
For a good many older people, membership</p>
<p>on the board of a service organization is the last activity they
have. They have retired from everything else. So</p>
<p>they hold on to it. All my life I’ve been opposed to age limits. But
when it comes to boards, I have reluctantly</p>
<p>come around to the idea that it is best to limit membership to two
terms ofz say, three years each. After that you</p>
<p>go off the board. Three years later you may come back on again. But
at age seventy-two or so, you go off the</p>
<p>board and stay off the board.</p>
<p>Another common problem is the badly split board. Every time an issue
comes upz the board members fight out</p>
<p>their basic policy rift. This is much more likely to happen in
non-profit institutions precisely because the</p>
<p>mission is, and should be, so important. In my experience, the role
of the board then becomes both more</p>
<p>important and more controversial. At that point, teamwork between
chairperson and chief executive officer</p>
<p>becomes absolutely vital.</p>
<p>TWO-WAY RELATIONSHIPS</p>
<p>Only two-way relationships work. Every organization wants stars and
needs stars. Butin a good opera</p>
<p>performance, the star is not separate from the cast. The cast
supports the star and then, as the great singer</p>
<p>delivers an outstanding performance, the supporting cast is suddenly
lifted out of its mediocrity. Everybody</p>
<p>suddenly has a new dimension. That’s the payoff of an effective
two-way relationship.</p>
<p>An effective non-profit executive starts building this two-way
relationship with the staff, with the board, with</p>
<p>the community, with donors, with volunteers, and with alumni by
asking: ’What do you have to tell me?z Not,</p>
<p>’This is what I am telling you/ That question brings problems out in
the open. And the funny thing is that most</p>
<p>of the problems that bother people so much turn out to be
non-problems when you bring them out in the open.</p>
<p>A friend of mine calls them ‘pebbles in the shoe’ for which you donzt
need an orthopaedic surgeon. The twoway relationship converts a lot of
problems into pebbles in the shoe.</p>
<p>The true test of a relationship is not that it can solve problems but
that it can function despite problems.</p>
<p>Problems don’t become irrelevant. But they don’t get in the way of
whafs important.</p>
<p>RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY</p>
<p>The Visiting Nursesz the Cancer Society, the community college, and
any number of other non-profit</p>
<p>institutions serve one specific community interest. Each has to
maintain relations with governmental agencies,</p>
<p>with all the other institutions in the community, and with the
community’s people in general. This is not a</p>
<p>matter of public relations (though you’d better have good PR). It
requires that the service organization lives its</p>
<p>mission. That is why volunteers are so important. They live in the
community and they exemplify the</p>
<p>institution’s mission. Effective nonprofits train their volunteers to
represent them in the community. They also</p>
<p>should make it easy for volunteers to report back any questions the
community has about the work of the</p>
<p>institution.</p>
<p>I know an area where there are three competing hospitals. Everyone in
the community is full of praise for one</p>
<p>of the hospitals, which on any objective evaluation is probably the
poorest of the three. What does that hospital</p>
<p>do that makes it so visible in the community? Two weeks after a
patient is discharged, somebody from the</p>
<p>hospital calls up and says, ’Mrs Smith, I’m calling you on behalf of
Memorial Hospital to find out how you are/</p>
<p>If Mrs Smith reports she is not doing well, that recovery is slow,
the hospital calls again three weeks later. At</p>
<p>the end of the year she gets a calendar from the hospital saying, We
hope we don’t have to see you againz but</p>
<p>we still care about you - something sentimental. Everybody knows that
this is pure routine. And yet the hospital</p>
<p>tells the community what the community needs to hear from a hospital:
We haven’t forgotten you.</p>
<p>一 are. That, I think,</p>
<p>is probably the one area where each non-profit manager can easily
improve the institution怎 community</p>
<p>Far too few service organizations even know who their ”alumni’ -
expatients or graduates</p>
<p>standing. Results can be achieved with little effort.</p>
