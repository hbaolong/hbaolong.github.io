<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>Writing this book was among the most challenging and rewarding
experiences of my life. I learned much I didn’t know about my culture,
my neighborhood, and my family, and I relearned much that I had
forgotten. I owe a great deal to many people. In no particular
order:</p>
<p>Tina Bennett, my wonderful agent, believed in the project even before
I did. She encouraged me when I needed it, pushed me when I needed it,
and guided me through a publication process that initially scared the
hell out of me. She has the heart of a hillbilly and the mind of a poet,
and I’m honored to call her a friend.</p>
<p>Besides Tina, the person who deserves the most credit for this book’s
existence is Amy Chua, my Yale contracts professor, who convinced me
that both my life and the conclusions I drew from it were worth putting
down on paper. She has the wisdom of a respected academic and the
confident delivery of a Tiger Mother, and there were many times that I
needed (and benefitted) from both.</p>
<p>The entire team at Harper deserves tremendous credit. Jonathan Jao,
my editor, helped me think critically about what I wanted the book to
accomplish and had the patience to help me accomplish it. Sofia Groopman
gave the book a fresh eye when it was desperately needed. Joanna, Tina,
and Katie guided me through the publicity process with warmth and skill.
Tim Duggan took a chance on this project and me when he had little
reason to do so. For all of them, and their work on my behalf, I’m very
thankful.</p>
<p>Many people read various drafts and offered important feedback, from
questioning the choice of a word in a particular sentence to doubting
the wisdom of deleting an entire chapter. Charles Tyler read a very
early draft and forced me to hone in on a few core themes. Kyle
Bumgarner and Sam Rudman offered helpful feedback early in the writing
process. Kiel Brennan-Marquez, who has had the official and unofficial
burden of teaching me writing for many years, read and critiqued
multiple drafts. I appreciate all of their efforts.</p>
<p>I’m grateful to the many people who opened up about their lives and
work, including Jane Rex, Sally Williamson, Jennifer McGuffey, Mindy
Farmer, Brian Campbell, Stevie Van Gordon, Sherry Gaston, Katrina Reed,
Elizabeth Wilkins, JJ Snidow, and Jim Williamson. They made the book
better by exposing me to new ideas and experiences.</p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to have Darrell Stark, Nate Ellis, Bill Zaboski,
Craig Baldwin, Jamil Jivani, Ethan (Doug) Fallang, Kyle Walsh, and Aaron
Kash in my life, and I consider each of them more brother than friend.
I’ve been fortunate, too, to have mentors and friends of incredible
ability, each of whom ensured that I had access to opportunities I
simply didn’t deserve. They include: Ron Selby, Mike Stratton, Shannon
Arledge, Shawn Haney, Brad Nelson, David Frum, Matt Johnson, Judge David
Bunning, Reihan Salam, Ajay Royan, Fred Moll, and Peter Thiel. Many of
these folks read versions of the manuscript and provided critical
feedback.</p>
<p>I owe an incredible amount to my family, especially those who opened
their hearts and shared memories, no matter how difficult or painful. My
sister Lindsay Ratliff and Aunt Wee (Lori Meibers) deserve special
thanks, both for helping me write this book and for supporting me
throughout my life. I’m also grateful to Jim Vance, Dan Meibers, Kevin
Ratliff, Mom, Bonnie Rose Meibers, Hannah Meibers, Kameron Ratliff,
Meghan Ratliff, Emma Ratliff, Hattie Hounshell Blanton, Don Bowman (my
dad), Cheryl Bowman, Cory Bowman, Chelsea Bowman, Lakshmi Chilukuri,
Krish Chilukuri, Shreya Chilukuri, Donna Vance, Rachael Vance, Nate
Vance, Lilly Hudson Vance, Daisy Hudson Vance, Gail Huber, Allan Huber,
Mike Huber, Nick Huber, Denise Blanton, Arch Stacy, Rose Stacy, Rick
Stacy, Amber Stacy, Adam Stacy, Taheton Stacy, Betty Sebastian, David
Blanton, Gary Blanton, Wanda Blanton, Pet Blanton, Teaberry Blanton, and
every crazy hillbilly I’ve ever had the honor to call my kin.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, is my darling wife, Usha, who read
every single word of my manuscript literally dozens of times, offered
needed feedback (even when I didn’t want it!), supported me when I felt
like quitting, and celebrated with me during times of progress. So much
of the credit for both this book and the happy life I lead belongs to
her. Though it is one of the great regrets of my life that Mamaw and
Papaw never met her, it is the source of my greatest joy that I did.</p>
