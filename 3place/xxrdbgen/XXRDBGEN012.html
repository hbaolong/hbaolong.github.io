<h4 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h4>
<p>During my last year of high school, I tried out for the varsity golf
team. For about a year, I’d taken golf lessons from an old golf pro. The
summer before senior year, I got a job at a local golf course so I could
practice for free. Mamaw never showed any interest in sports, but she
encouraged me to learn golf because “that’s where rich people do
business.” Though wise in her own way, Mamaw knew little about the
business habits of rich people, and I told her as much. “Shut up, you
fucker,” she told me. “Everybody knows rich people love to golf.” But
when I practiced my swing in the house (I didn’t use a ball, so the only
damage I did was to the floor) she demanded that I stop ruining her
carpet. “But, Mamaw,” I protested sarcastically, “if you don’t let me
practice, I’ll never get to do any business on the golf course. I might
as well drop out of high school now and get a job bagging groceries.”
“You smart-ass. If I wasn’t crippled, I’d get up right now and smack
your head and ass together.”</p>
<p>So she helped me pay for my lessons and asked her baby brother (my
uncle Gary), the youngest of the Blanton boys, to find me some old
clubs. He delivered a nice set of MacGregors, better than anything we
could have afforded on our own, and I practiced as often as I could. By
the time golf tryouts rolled around, I had mastered enough of a golf
swing not to embarrass myself.</p>
<p>I didn’t make the team, though I did show enough improvement to
justify practicing with my friends who had made the team, and that was
all I really wanted. I learned that Mamaw was right: Golf was a rich
person’s game. At the course where I worked, few of our customers came
from Middletown’s working-class neighborhoods. On my first day of golf
practice, I showed up in dress shoes, thinking that was what golf shoes
were. When an enterprising young bully noticed before the first tee that
I was wearing a pair of Kmart brown loafers, he proceeded to mock me
mercilessly for the next four hours. I resisted the urge to bury my
putter in his goddamned ear, remembering Mamaw’s sage advice to “act
like you’ve been there.” (A note about hillbilly loyalty: Reminded of
that story recently, Lindsay launched into a tirade about how much of a
loser the kid was. The incident occurred thirteen years ago.)</p>
<p>I knew in the back of my mind that decisions were coming about my
future. All of my friends planned to go to college; that I had such
motivated friends was due to Mamaw’s influence. By the time I was in
seventh grade, many of my neighborhood friends were already smoking
weed. Mamaw found out and forbade me to see any of them. I recognize
that most kids ignore instructions like these, but most kids don’t
receive them from the likes of Bonnie Vance. She promised that if she
saw me in the presence of any person on the banned list, she would run
him over with her car. “No one would ever find out,” she whispered
menacingly.</p>
<p>With my friends headed for college, I figured I’d do the same. I
scored well enough on the SAT to overcome my earlier bad grades, and I
knew that the only two schools I had any interest in attending—Ohio
State and Miami University—would both accept me. A few months before I
graduated, I had (admittedly, with little thought) settled on Ohio
State. A large package arrived in the mail, filled with financial aid
information from the university. There was talk of Pell Grants,
subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, scholarships, and something called
“work-study.” It was all so exciting, if only Mamaw and I could figure
out what it meant. We puzzled over the forms for hours before concluding
that I could purchase a decent home in Middletown with the debt I’d
incur to go to college. We hadn’t actually started the forms yet—that
would require another herculean effort on another day.</p>
<p>Excitement turned to apprehension, but I reminded myself that college
was an investment in my future. “It’s the only damned thing worth
spending money on right now,” Mamaw said. She was right, but as I
worried less about the financial aid forms, I began to worry for another
reason: I wasn’t ready. Not all investments are good investments. All of
that debt, and for what? To get drunk all the time and earn terrible
grades? Doing well in college required grit, and I had far too little of
it.</p>
<p>My high school record left much to be desired: dozens of absences and
tardy arrivals, and no school activities to speak of. I was undoubtedly
on an upward trajectory, but even toward the end of high school, C’s in
easy classes revealed a kid unprepared for the rigors of advanced
education. In Mamaw’s house, I was healing, yet as we combed through
those financial aid papers, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had a
long way to go.</p>
<p>Everything about the unstructured college experience terrified
me—from feeding myself healthy food to paying my own bills. I’d never
done any of those things. But I knew that I wanted more out of my life.
I knew that I wanted to excel in college, get a good job, and give my
family the things I’d never had. I just wasn’t ready to start that
journey. That’s when my cousin Rachael—a Marine Corps veteran—advised
that I consider the Corps: “They’ll whip your ass into shape.” Rachael
was Uncle Jimmy’s oldest daughter, and thus the dean of our generation
of grandchildren. All of us, even Lindsay, looked up to Rachael, so her
advice carried enormous weight.</p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks had occurred only a year earlier, during my junior
year of high school; like any self-respecting hillbilly, I considered
heading to the Middle East to kill terrorists. But the prospect of
military service—the screaming drill instructors, the constant exercise,
the separation from my family—frightened me. Until Rachael told me to
talk to a recruiter—implicitly arguing that she thought I could handle
it—joining the Marines seemed as plausible as flying to Mars. Now, just
weeks before I owed a tuition deposit to Ohio State, I could think of
nothing but the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>So one Saturday in late March, I walked into a military recruiter’s
office and asked him about the Marine Corps. He didn’t try to sell me on
anything. He told me I’d make very little money and I might even go to
war. “But they’ll teach you about leadership, and they’ll turn you into
a disciplined young man.” This piqued my interest, but the notion of
J.D. the U.S. Marine still inspired disbelief. I was a pudgy, longhaired
kid. When our gym teacher told us to run a mile, I’d walk at least half.
I had never woken up before six A.M. And here was this organization
promising that I’d rise regularly at five A.M. and run multiple miles
per day.</p>
<p>I went home and considered my options. I reminded myself that my
country needed me, and that I’d always regret not participating in
America’s newest war. I thought about the GI Bill and how it would help
me trade indebtedness for financial freedom. I knew that, most of all, I
had no other choice. There was college, or nothing, or the Marines, and
I didn’t like either of the first two options. Four years in the
Marines, I told myself, would help me become the person I wanted to be.
But I didn’t want to leave home. Lindsay had just had her second kid, an
adorable little girl, and was expecting a third, and my nephew was still
a toddler. Lori’s kids were still babies, too. The more I thought about
it, the less I wanted to do it. And I knew that if I waited too long,
I’d talk myself out of enlisting. So two weeks later, as the Iraq crisis
turned into the Iraq war, I signed my name on a dotted line and promised
the Marine Corps the first four years of my adult life.</p>
<p>At first my family scoffed. The Marines weren’t for me, and people
let me know it. Eventually, knowing I wouldn’t change my mind, everyone
came around, and a few even seemed excited. Everyone, that is, save
Mamaw. She tried every manner of persuasion: “You’re a fucking idiot;
they’ll chew you up and spit you out.” “Who’s going to take care of me?”
“You’re too stupid for the Marines.” “You’re too smart for the Marines.”
“With everything that’s going on in the world, you’ll get your head
blown off.” “Don’t you want to be around for Lindsay’s kids?” “I’m
worried, and I don’t want you to go.” Though she came to accept the
decision, she never liked it. Shortly before I left for boot camp, the
recruiter visited to speak with my fragile grandmother. She met him
outside, stood up as straight as she could, and glowered at him. “Set
one foot on my fucking porch, and I’ll blow it off,” she advised. “I
thought she might be serious,” he later told me. So they had their talk
while he stood in the front yard.</p>
<p>My greatest fear when I left for boot camp wasn’t that I’d be killed
in Iraq or that I’d fail to make the cut. I hardly worried about those
things. But when Mom, Lindsay, and Aunt Wee drove me to the bus that
would take me to the airport and on to boot camp from there, I imagined
my life four years later. And I saw a world without my grandmother in
it. Something inside me knew that she wouldn’t survive my time in the
Marines. I’d never come home again, at least not permanently. Home was
Middletown with Mamaw in it. And by the time I finished with the
Marines, Mamaw would be gone.</p>
<p>Marine Corps boot camp lasts thirteen weeks, each with a new training
focus. The night I arrived in Parris Island, South Carolina, an angry
drill instructor greeted my group as we disembarked from the plane. He
ordered us onto a bus; after a short trip, another drill instructor
ordered us off the bus and onto the famed “yellow footprints.” Over the
next six hours, I was poked and prodded by medical personnel, assigned
equipment and uniforms, and lost all of my hair. We were allowed one
phone call, so I naturally called Mamaw and read off of the card they
gave me: “I have arrived safely at Parris Island. I will send my address
soon. Goodbye.” “Wait, you little shithead. Are you okay?” “Sorry,
Mamaw, can’t talk. But yes, I’m okay. I’ll write as soon as I can.” The
drill instructor, overhearing my two extra lines of conversation, asked
sarcastically whether I’d made enough time “for her to tell you a
fucking story.” That was the first day.</p>
<p>There are no phone calls in boot camp. I was allowed only one, to
call Lindsay when her half brother died. I realized, through letters,
how much my family loved me. While most other recruits—that’s what they
called us; we had to earn the title “marine” by completing the rigors of
boot camp—received a letter every day or two, I sometimes received a
half dozen each night. Mamaw wrote every day, sometimes several times,
offering extended thoughts on what was wrong with the world in some and
few-sentence streams of consciousness in others. Most of all, Mamaw
wanted to know how my days were going and reassure me. Recruiters told
families that what most of us needed were words of encouragement, and
Mamaw delivered that in spades. As I struggled with screaming drill
instructors and physical fitness routines that pushed my out-of-shape
body to its limits, I read every day that Mamaw was proud of me, that
she loved me, and that she knew I wouldn’t give up. Thanks to either my
wisdom or inherited hoarder tendencies, I managed to keep nearly every
one of the letters I received from my family.</p>
<p>Many of them shed an interesting light on the home I left behind. A
letter from Mom, asking me what I might need and telling me how proud
she is of me. “I was babysitting [Lindsay’s kids],” she reports. “They
played with slugs outside. They squeezed one and killed it. But I threw
it away and told them they didn’t because Kam got a little upset,
thinking he killed it.” This is Mom at her best: loving and funny, a
woman who delighted in her grandchildren. In the same letter, a
reference to Greg, likely a boyfriend who has since disappeared from my
memory. And an insight into our sense of normalcy: “Mandy’s husband
Terry,” she starts, referencing a friend of hers, “was arrested on a
probation violation and sent to prison. So they are all doing OK.”</p>
<p>Lindsay also wrote often, sending multiple letters in the same
envelope, each on a different-colored piece of paper, with instructions
on the back—“Read this one second; this is the last one.” Every single
letter contained some reference to her kids. I learned of my oldest
niece’s successful potty training; my nephew’s soccer matches; my
younger niece’s early smiles and first efforts to reach for things.
After a lifetime of shared triumphs and tragedies, we both adored her
kids more than anything else. Almost all of the letters I sent home
asked her to “kiss the babies and tell them that I love them.”</p>
<p>Cut off for the first time from home and family, I learned a lot
about myself and my culture. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the
military is not a landing spot for low-income kids with no other
options. The sixty-nine members of my boot camp platoon included black,
white, and Hispanic kids; rich kids from upstate New York and poor kids
from West Virginia; Catholics, Jews, Protestants, and even a few
atheists.</p>
<p>I was naturally drawn to those like me. “The person I talk to most,”
I wrote to my family in my first letter home, “is from Leslie County,
Kentucky. He talks like he’s from Jackson. I was telling him how much
bullshit it was that Catholics got all the free time they did. They get
it because of the way the church schedule works. He is definitely a
country kid, ’cause he said, ‘What’s a Catholic?’ And I told him that it
was just another form of Christianity, and he said, ‘I might have to try
that out.’” Mamaw understood precisely where he came from. “Down in that
part of Kentucky, everybody’s a snake handler,” she wrote back, only
partially joking.</p>
<p>During my time away, Mamaw showed vulnerability that I’d never seen
before. Whenever she received a letter from me, she would call my aunt
or sister, demanding that someone come to her house immediately and
interpret my chicken scratch. “I love you a big bunch and I miss you a
bunch I forget you aren’t here I think you will come down the stairs and
I can holler at you it is just a feeling you aren’t really gone. My
hands hurt today that arthritis I guess. . . . I’ll go for now write
more later love you please take care.” Mamaw’s letters never contained
the necessary punctuation and always included some articles, usually
from Reader’s Digest, to occupy my time.</p>
<p>She could still be classic Mamaw: mean and ferociously loyal. About a
month into my training, I had a nasty exchange with a drill instructor,
who took me aside for a half hour, forcing me to alternate jumping
jacks, sit-ups, and short sprints until I was completely exhausted. It
was par for the course in boot camp, something nearly everyone faced at
one point or another. If anything, I was lucky to have avoided it for so
long. “Dearest J.D.,” Mamaw wrote when she learned of the incident, “I
must say I have been waiting for them dick face bastards to start on
you—and now they have. Words aren’t invented to describe how they piss
me off. . . . You just keep on doing the best you can do and keep
thinking about this stupid asshole with an IQ of 2 thinking he is Bobby
bad ass but he wears girls underwear. I hate all of them.” When I read
that outburst, I figured Mamaw had gotten it all off her chest. But the
next day, she had more to say: “Hello sweet heart all I can think about
is them dicks screaming at you that is my job not them fuckers. Just
kidding I know you will be what ever you want to be because you are
smart something they aren’t and they know it I hate them all really hate
their guts. Screaming is part of the game they play . . . you carry on
as best you can you will come out ahead.” I had the meanest old
hillbilly staunchly in my corner, even if she was hundreds of miles
away.</p>
<p>In boot camp, mealtime is a marvel of efficiency. You walk through a
cafeteria line, holding your tray for the service staff. They drop all
of the day’s offerings on your plate, both because you’re afraid to
speak up about your least favorite items and because you’re so hungry
that you’d gladly eat a dead horse. You sit down, and without looking at
your plate (that would be unprofessional) or moving your head (that
would also be unprofessional), you shovel food into your mouth until
you’re told to stop. The entire process takes no longer than eight
minutes, and if you’re not quite full by the end, you certainly suffer
from indigestion (which feels about the same).</p>
<p>The only discretionary part of the exercise is dessert, set aside on
small plates at the end of the assembly line. During the first meal of
boot camp, I grabbed the offered piece of cake and marched to my seat.
If nothing else tastes good, I thought, this cake shall certainly be the
exception. Then my drill instructor, a skinny white man with a Tennessee
twang, stepped in front of me. He looked me up and down with his small,
intense eyes and offered a query: “You really need that cake, don’t you,
fat-ass?” I prepared to answer, but the question was apparently
rhetorical, as he smacked the cake out of my hands and moved on to his
next victim. I never grabbed the cake again.</p>
<p>There was an important lesson here, but not one about food or
self-control or nutrition. If you’d told me that I’d react to such an
insult by cleaning up the cake and heading back to my seat, I’d never
have believed you. The trials of my youth instilled a debilitating
self-doubt. Instead of congratulating myself on having overcome some
obstacles, I worried that I’d be overcome by the next ones. Marine Corps
boot camp, with its barrage of challenges big and small, began to teach
me I had underestimated myself.</p>
<p>Marine Corps boot camp is set up as a life-defining challenge. From
the day you arrive, no one calls you by your first name. You’re not
allowed to say “I” because you’re taught to mistrust your own
individuality. Every question begins with “This recruit”—This recruit
needs to use the head (the bathroom); This recruit needs to visit the
corpsman (the doctor). The few idiots who arrive at boot camp with
Marine Corps tattoos are mercilessly berated. At every turn, recruits
are reminded that they are worthless until they finish boot camp and
earn the title “marine.” Our platoon started with eighty-three, and by
the time we finished, sixty-nine remained. Those who dropped out—mostly
for medical reasons—served to reinforce the worthiness of the
challenge.</p>
<p>Every time the drill instructor screamed at me and I stood proudly;
every time I thought I’d fall behind during a run and kept up; every
time I learned to do something I thought impossible, like climb the
rope, I came a little closer to believing in myself. Psychologists call
it “learned helplessness” when a person believes, as I did during my
youth, that the choices I made had no effect on the outcomes in my life.
From Middletown’s world of small expectations to the constant chaos of
our home, life had taught me that I had no control. Mamaw and Papaw had
saved me from succumbing entirely to that notion, and the Marine Corps
broke new ground. If I had learned helplessness at home, the Marines
were teaching learned willfulness.</p>
<p>The day I graduated from boot camp was the proudest of my life. An
entire crew of hillbillies showed up for my graduation—eighteen in
total—including Mamaw, sitting in a wheelchair, buried underneath a few
blankets, looking frailer than I remembered. I showed everyone around
base, feeling like I had just won the lottery, and when I was released
for a ten-day leave the next day, we caravanned back to Middletown.</p>
<p>On my first day home from boot camp, I walked into the barbershop of
my grandfather’s old friend. Marines have to keep their hair short, and
I didn’t want to slack just because no one was watching. For the first
time, the corner barber—a dying breed even though I didn’t know it at
the time—greeted me as an adult. I sat in his chair, told some dirty
jokes (most of which I’d learned only weeks earlier), and shared some
boot camp stories. When he was about my age, he was drafted into the
army to fight in Korea, so we traded some barbs about the Army and the
Marines. After the haircut, he refused to take my money and told me to
stay safe. He’d cut my hair before, and I’d walked by his shop nearly
every day for eighteen years. Yet it was the first time he’d ever shaken
my hand and treated me as an equal.</p>
<p>I had a lot of those experiences shortly after boot camp. In those
first days as a marine—all spent in Middletown—every interaction was a
revelation. I’d shed forty-five pounds, so many of the people I knew
barely recognized me. My friend Nate—who would later serve as one of my
groomsmen—did a double take when I extended my hand at a local mall.
Perhaps I carried myself a little differently. My old hometown seemed to
think so.</p>
<p>The new perspective went both ways. Many of the foods that I ate once
now violated the fitness standards of a marine. In Mamaw’s house,
everything was fried—chicken, pickles, tomatoes. That bologna sandwich
on toast with crumbled potato chips as topping no longer appeared
healthy. Blackberry cobbler, once considered as healthy as any dish
built around fruit (blackberries) and grains (flour), lost its luster. I
began asking questions I’d never asked before: Is there added sugar?
Does this meat have a lot of saturated fat? How much salt? It was just
food, but I was already realizing that I’d never look at Middletown the
same way again. In a few short months, the Marine Corps had already
changed my perspective.</p>
<p>I soon left home for a permanent assignment in the Marine Corps, and
life at home continued on apace. I tried to return as often as I could,
and with long weekends and generous Marine Corps leave, I usually saw my
family every few months. The kids looked a bit bigger every time I saw
them, and Mom moved in with Mamaw not long after I left for boot camp,
though she didn’t plan to stay. Mamaw’s health seemed to improve: She
was walking better and even putting on a bit of weight. Lindsay and Aunt
Wee, as well as their families, were healthy and happy. My greatest fear
before I left was that some tragedy would befall my family while I was
away, and I’d be unable to help. Luckily, that wasn’t happening.</p>
<p>In January 2005, I learned that my unit would head to Iraq a few
months later. I was both excited and nervous. Mamaw fell silent when I
called to tell her. After a few uncomfortable seconds of dead air, she
said only that she hoped the war would end before I had to leave. Though
we spoke on the phone every few days, we never spoke of Iraq, even as
winter turned to spring and everyone knew I’d be leaving for war that
summer. I could tell that Mamaw didn’t want to talk or think about it,
and I obliged.</p>
<p>Mamaw was old, frail, and sick. I no longer lived with her, and I was
preparing to go fight a war. Though her health had improved somewhat
since I’d left for the Marines, she still took a dozen medications and
made quarterly trips to the hospital for various ailments. When AK
Steel—which provided health care for Mamaw as Papaw’s widow—announced
that they were increasing her premiums, Mamaw simply couldn’t afford
them. She barely survived as it was, and she needed three hundred
dollars extra per month. She told me as much one day, and I immediately
volunteered to cover the costs. She had never accepted anything from
me—not money from my paycheck at Dillman’s; not a share of my boot camp
earnings. But she accepted my three hundred a month, and that’s how I
knew she was desperate.</p>
<p>I didn’t make a lot of money myself—probably a thousand dollars a
month after taxes, though the Marines gave me a place to stay and food
to eat, so that money went far. I also made extra money playing online
poker. Poker was in my blood—I’d played with pennies and dimes with
Papaw and my great-uncles as far back as I could remember—and the online
poker craze at the time made it basically free money. I played ten hours
a week on small-stakes tables, earning four hundred dollars a month. I
had planned to save that money, but instead I gave it to Mamaw for her
health insurance. Mamaw, naturally, worried that I had picked up a
gambling habit and was playing cards in some mountain trailer with a
bunch of card-sharking hillbillies, but I assured her that it was online
and legitimate. “Well, you know I don’t understand the fucking Internet.
Just don’t turn to booze and women. That’s always what happens to
dipshits who get caught up in gambling.”</p>
<p>Mamaw and I both loved the movie Terminator 2. We probably watched it
together five or six times. Mamaw saw Arnold Schwarzenegger as the
embodiment of the American Dream: a strong, capable immigrant coming out
on top. But I saw the movie as a sort of metaphor for my own life. Mamaw
was my keeper, my protector, and, if need be, my own goddamned
terminator. No matter what life threw at me, I’d be okay because she was
there to protect me.</p>
<p>Paying for her health insurance made me feel, for the first time in
my life, like I was the protector. It gave me a sense of satisfaction
that I’d never imagined—and how could I? I’d never had the money to help
people before the Marines. When I came home, I was able to take Mom out
to lunch, get ice cream for the kids, and buy nice Christmas presents
for Lindsay. On one of my trips home, Mamaw and I took Lindsay’s two
oldest kids on a trip to Hocking Hills State Park, a beautiful region of
Appalachian Ohio, to meet up with Aunt Wee and Dan. I drove the whole
way, I paid for gas, and I bought everyone dinner (admittedly at
Wendy’s). I felt like such a man, a real grown-up. To laugh and joke
with the people I loved most as they scarfed down the meal that I’d
provided gave me a feeling of joy and accomplishment that words can’t
possibly describe.</p>
<p>For my entire life, I had oscillated between fear at my worst moments
and a sense of safety and stability at my best. I was either being
chased by the bad terminator or protected by the good one. But I had
never felt empowered—never believed that I had the ability and the
responsibility to care for those I loved. Mamaw could preach about
responsibility and hard work, about making something of myself and not
making excuses. No pep talk or speech could show me how it felt to
transition from seeking shelter to providing it. I had to learn that for
myself, and once I did, there was no going back.</p>
<p>Mamaw’s seventy-second birthday was in April 2005. Just a couple of
weeks before then, I stood in the waiting room of a Walmart Supercenter
as car technicians changed my oil. I called Mamaw on the cell phone that
I paid for myself, and she told me about babysitting Lindsay’s kids that
day. “Meghan is so damned cute,” she told me. “I told her to shit in the
pot, and for three hours she just kept on saying ‘shit in the pot, shit
in the pot, shit in the pot’ over and over again. I told her she had to
stop or I’d get in trouble, but she never did.” I laughed, told Mamaw
that I loved her, and let her know that her monthly three-hundred-dollar
check was on the way. “J.D., thank you for helping me. I’m very proud of
you, and I love you.”</p>
<p>Two days later I awoke on a Sunday morning to a call from my sister,
who said that Mamaw’s lung had collapsed, that she was lying in the
hospital in a coma, and that I should come home as quickly as possible.
Two hours later, I was on the road. I packed my dress blue uniform, just
in case I needed it for a funeral. On the way, a West Virginia police
officer pulled me over for going ninety-four miles an hour on I–77. He
asked why I was in such a hurry, and when I explained, he told me that
the highway was clear of speed traps for the next seventy miles, after
which I’d cross into Ohio, and that I should go as fast as I wanted
until then. I took my warning ticket, thanked him profusely, and drove
102 until I crossed the state line. I made the thirteen-hour trip in
just under eleven hours.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Middletown Regional Hospital at eleven in the
evening, my entire family was gathered around Mamaw’s bed. She was
unresponsive, and though her lung had been reinflated, the infection
that had caused it to collapse showed no signs of responding to
treatment. Until that happened, the doctor told us, it would be torture
to wake her—if she could be awakened at all.</p>
<p>We waited a few days for signs that the infection was surrendering to
the medication. But the signs showed the opposite: Her white blood cell
count continued to rise, and some of her organs showed evidence of
severe stress. Her doctor explained that she had no realistic chance of
living without a ventilator and feeding tube. We all conferred and
decided that if, after a day, Mamaw’s white blood cell count increased
further, we would pull the plug. Legally, it was Aunt Wee’s sole
decision, and I’ll never forget when she tearfully asked whether I
thought she was making a mistake. To this day, I’m convinced that
she—and we—made the right decision. I guess it’s impossible to know for
sure. I wished at the time that we had a doctor in the family.</p>
<p>The doctor told us that without the ventilator Mamaw would die within
fifteen minutes, an hour at most. She lasted instead for three hours,
fighting to the very last minute. Everyone was present—Uncle Jimmy, Mom,
and Aunt Wee; Lindsay, Kevin, and I—and we gathered around her bed,
taking turns whispering in her ear and hoping that she heard us. As her
heart rate dropped and we realized that her time drew near, I opened a
Gideon’s Bible to a random passage and began to read. It was First
Corinthians, Chapter 13, Verse 12: “For now we see through a glass,
darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know
even as also I am known.” A few minutes later, she was dead.</p>
<p>I didn’t cry when Mamaw died, and I didn’t cry for days thereafter.
Aunt Wee and Lindsay grew frustrated with me, then worried: You’re just
so stoic, they said. You need to grieve like the rest of us or you’ll
burst.</p>
<p>I was grieving in my own way, but I sensed that our entire family was
on the verge of collapse, and I wanted to give the impression of
emotional strength. We all knew how Mom had reacted to Papaw’s death,
but Mamaw’s death created new pressures: It was time to wind down the
estate, figure out Mamaw’s debts, dispose of her property, and disburse
what remained. For the first time, Uncle Jimmy learned Mom’s true
financial impact on Mamaw—the drug rehab charges, the numerous “loans”
never repaid. To this day, he refuses to speak to her.</p>
<p>For those of us well acquainted with Mamaw’s generosity, her
financial position came as no surprise. Though Papaw had worked and
saved for over four decades, the only thing of value that remained was
the house he and Mamaw had purchased fifty years earlier. And Mamaw’s
debts were large enough to eat into a substantial portion of the home’s
equity. Lucky for us, this was 2005—the height of the real estate
bubble. If she had died in 2008, Mamaw’s estate likely would have been
bankrupt.</p>
<p>In her will, Mamaw divided what remained between her three kids, with
a twist: Mom’s share was divided evenly between me and Lindsay. This
undoubtedly contributed to Mom’s inevitable emotional outburst. I was so
caught up in the financial aspects of Mamaw’s death and spending time
with relatives I hadn’t seen in months that I didn’t realize Mom was
slowly descending to the same place she’d traveled after Papaw’s death.
But it’s hard to miss a freight train barreling down on you, so I
noticed soon enough.</p>
<p>Like Papaw, Mamaw wanted a visitation in Middletown so that all of
her friends from Ohio could gather and pay their respects. Like Papaw,
she wanted a second visitation and funeral back home in Jackson, at
Deaton’s. After her funeral, the convoy departed for Keck, a holler not
far from where Mamaw was born that housed our family’s cemetery. In
family lore, Keck held an even higher place of honor than Mamaw’s
birthplace. Her own mother—our beloved Mamaw Blanton—was born in Keck,
and Mamaw Blanton’s younger sister—Aunt Bonnie, nearly ninety
herself—owned a beautiful log cabin on the same property. A short hike
up the mountain from that log cabin is a relatively flat plot of land
that serves as the final resting place for Papaw and Mamaw Blanton and a
host of relatives, some born in the nineteenth century. That’s where our
convoy was headed, through the narrow mountain roads, to deliver Mamaw
to the family who’d crossed over before her.</p>
<p>I’ve made that drive with a funeral convoy probably half a dozen
times, and every turn reveals a landscape that inspires some memory of
fonder times. It’s impossible to sit in the car for the twenty-minute
trip and not trade stories about the departed, all of which start out
“Do you remember that time . . . ?” But after Mamaw’s funeral, we didn’t
recall a series of fond memories about Mamaw and Papaw and Uncle Red and
Teaberry and that time Uncle David drove off the side of the mountain,
rolled a hundred yards down the hill, and walked away without a scratch.
Lindsay and I instead listened to Mom tell us that we were too sad, that
we loved Mamaw too much, and that Mom had the greater right to grief
because, in her words, “She was my mom, not yours!”</p>
<p>I have never felt angrier at anyone for anything. For years, I had
made excuses for Mom. I had tried to help manage her drug problem, read
those stupid books about addiction, and accompanied her to N.A.
meetings. I had endured, never complaining, a parade of father figures,
all of whom left me feeling empty and mistrustful of men. I had agreed
to ride in that car with her on the day she threatened to kill me, and
then I had stood before a judge and lied to him to keep her out of jail.
I had moved in with her and Matt, and then her and Ken, because I wanted
her to get better and thought that if I played along, there was a chance
she would. For years, Lindsay called me the “forgiving child”—the one
who found the best in Mom, the one who made excuses, the one who
believed. I opened my mouth to spew pure vitriol in Mom’s direction, but
Lindsay spoke first: “No, Mom. She was our mom, too.” That said it all,
so I continued to sit in silence.</p>
<p>The day after the funeral, I drove back to North Carolina to rejoin
my Marine Corps unit. On the way back, on a narrow mountain back road in
Virginia, I hit a wet patch of road coming around a turn, and the car
began spinning out of control. I was moving fast, and my twisting car
showed no signs of slowing as it hurtled towards the guardrail. I
thought briefly that this was it—that I’d topple over that guardrail and
join Mamaw just a bit sooner than I expected—when all of a sudden the
car stopped. It is the closest I’ve ever come to a true supernatural
event, and though I’m sure some law of friction can explain what
happened, I imagined that Mamaw had stopped the car from toppling over
the side of the mountain. I reoriented the car, returned to my lane, and
then pulled off to the side. That was when I broke down and released the
tears that I’d held back during the previous two weeks. I spoke to
Lindsay and Aunt Wee before restarting my journey, and within a few
hours I was back at the base.</p>
<p>My final two years in the Marines flew by and were largely
uneventful, though two incidents stand out, each of which speaks to the
way the Marine Corps changed my perspective. The first was a moment in
time in Iraq, where I was lucky to escape any real fighting but which
affected me deeply nonetheless. As a public affairs marine, I would
attach to different units to get a sense of their daily routine.
Sometimes I’d escort civilian press, but generally I’d take photos or
write short stories about individual marines or their work. Early in my
deployment, I attached to a civil affairs unit to do community outreach.
Civil affairs missions were typically considered more dangerous, as a
small number of marines would venture into unprotected Iraqi territory
to meet with locals. On our particular mission, senior marines met with
local school officials while the rest of us provided security or hung
out with the schoolkids, playing soccer and passing out candy and school
supplies. One very shy boy approached me and held out his hand. When I
gave him a small eraser, his face briefly lit up with joy before he ran
away to his family, holding his two-cent prize aloft in triumph. I have
never seen such excitement on a child’s face.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in epiphanies. I don’t believe in transformative
moments, as transformation is harder than a moment. I’ve seen far too
many people awash in a genuine desire to change only to lose their
mettle when they realized just how difficult change actually is. But
that moment, with that boy, was pretty close for me. For my entire life,
I’d harbored resentment at the world. I was mad at my mother and father,
mad that I rode the bus to school while other kids caught rides with
friends, mad that my clothes didn’t come from Abercrombie, mad that my
grandfather died, mad that we lived in a small house. That resentment
didn’t vanish in an instant, but as I stood and surveyed the mass of
children of a war-torn nation, their school without running water, and
the overjoyed boy, I began to appreciate how lucky I was: born in the
greatest country on earth, every modern convenience at my fingertips,
supported by two loving hillbillies, and part of a family that, for all
its quirks, loved me unconditionally. At that moment, I resolved to be
the type of man who would smile when someone gave him an eraser. I
haven’t quite made it there, but without that day in Iraq, I wouldn’t be
trying.</p>
<p>The other life-altering component of my Marine Corps experience was
constant. From the first day, with that scary drill instructor and a
piece of cake, until the last, when I grabbed my discharge papers and
sped home, the Marine Corps taught me how to live like an adult.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps assumes maximum ignorance from its enlisted folks.
It assumes that no one taught you anything about physical fitness,
personal hygiene, or personal finances. I took mandatory classes about
balancing a checkbook, saving, and investing. When I came home from boot
camp with my fifteen-hundred-dollar earnings deposited in a mediocre
regional bank, a senior enlisted marine drove me to Navy Federal—a
respected credit union—and had me open an account. When I caught strep
throat and tried to tough it out, my commanding officer noticed and
ordered me to the doctor.</p>
<p>We used to complain constantly about the biggest perceived difference
between our jobs and civilian jobs: In the civilian world, your boss
wasn’t able to control your life after you left work. In the Marines, my
boss didn’t just make sure I did a good job, he made sure I kept my room
clean, kept my hair cut, and ironed my uniforms. He sent an older marine
to supervise as I shopped for my first car so that I’d end up with a
practical car, like a Toyota or a Honda, not the BMW I wanted. When I
nearly agreed to finance that purchase directly through the car
dealership with a 21-percent-interest-rate loan, my chaperone blew a
gasket and ordered me to call Navy Fed and get a second quote (it was
less than half the interest). I had no idea that people did these
things. Compare banks? I thought they were all the same. Shop around for
a loan? I felt so lucky to even get a loan that I was ready to pull the
trigger immediately. The Marine Corps demanded that I think
strategically about these decisions, and then it taught me how to do
so.</p>
<p>Just as important, the Marines changed the expectations that I had
for myself. In boot camp, the thought of climbing the thirty-foot rope
inspired terror; by the end of my first year, I could climb the rope
using only one arm. Before I enlisted, I had never run a mile
continuously. On my last physical fitness test, I ran three of them in
nineteen minutes. It was in the Marine Corps where I first ordered grown
men to do a job and watched them listen; where I learned that leadership
depended far more on earning the respect of your subordinates than on
bossing them around; where I discovered how to earn that respect; and
where I saw that men and women of different social classes and races
could work as a team and bond like family. It was the Marine Corps that
first gave me an opportunity to truly fail, made me take that
opportunity, and then, when I did fail, gave me another chance
anyway.</p>
<p>When you work in public affairs, the most senior marines serve as
liaisons with the press. The press is the holy grail of Marine Corps
public affairs: the biggest audience and the highest stakes. Our media
officer at Cherry Point was a captain who, for reasons I never
understood, quickly fell out of favor with the base’s senior brass.
Though he was a captain—eight pay grades higher than I was—because of
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there was no ready replacement when he
got the ax. So my boss told me that for the next nine months (until my
service ended) I would be the media relations officer for one of the
largest military bases on the East Coast.</p>
<p>By then I’d grown accustomed to the sometimes random nature of Marine
Corps assignments. This was something else entirely. As a friend joked,
I had a face for radio, and I wasn’t prepared for live TV interviews
about happenings on base. The Marine Corps threw me to the wolves. I
struggled a bit at first—allowing some photographers to take photos of a
classified aircraft; speaking out of turn at a meeting with senior
officers—and I got my ass chewed. My boss, Shawn Haney, explained what I
needed to do to correct myself. We discussed how to build relationships
with the press, how to stay on message, and how to manage my time. I got
better, and when hundreds of thousands flocked to our base for a
biannual air show, our media relations worked so well that I earned a
commendation medal.</p>
<p>The experience taught me a valuable lesson: that I could do it. I
could work twenty-hour days when I had to. I could speak clearly and
confidently with TV cameras shoved in my face. I could stand in a room
with majors, colonels, and generals and hold my own. I could do a
captain’s job even when I feared I couldn’t.</p>
<p>For all my grandma’s efforts, for all of her “You can do anything;
don’t be like those fuckers who think the deck is stacked against them”
diatribes, the message had only partially set in before I enlisted.
Surrounding me was another message: that I and the people like me
weren’t good enough; that the reason Middletown produced zero Ivy League
graduates was some genetic or character defect. I couldn’t possibly see
how destructive that mentality was until I escaped it. The Marine Corps
replaced it with something else, something that loathes excuses. “Giving
it my all” was a catchphrase, something heard in health or gym class.
When I first ran three miles, mildly impressed with my mediocre
twenty-five-minute time, a terrifying senior drill instructor greeted me
at the finish line: “If you’re not puking, you’re lazy! Stop being
fucking lazy!” He then ordered me to sprint between him and a tree
repeatedly. Just as I felt I might pass out, he relented. I was heaving,
barely able to catch my breath. “That’s how you should feel at the end
of every run!” he yelled. In the Marines, giving it your all was a way
of life.</p>
<p>I’m not saying ability doesn’t matter. It certainly helps. But
there’s something powerful about realizing that you’ve undersold
yourself—that somehow your mind confused lack of effort for inability.
This is why, whenever people ask me what I’d most like to change about
the white working class, I say, “The feeling that our choices don’t
matter.” The Marine Corps excised that feeling like a surgeon does a
tumor.</p>
<p>A few days after my twenty-third birthday, I hopped into the first
major purchase I’d ever made—an old Honda Civic—grabbed my discharge
papers, and drove one last time from Cherry Point, North Carolina, to
Middletown, Ohio. During my four years in the Marines, I had seen, in
Haiti, a level of poverty I never knew existed. I witnessed the fiery
aftermath of an airplane crash into a residential neighborhood. I had
watched Mamaw die and then gone to war a few months later. I had
befriended a former crack dealer who turned out to be the
hardest-working marine I knew.</p>
<p>When I joined the Marine Corps, I did so in part because I wasn’t
ready for adulthood. I didn’t know how to balance a checkbook, much less
how to complete the financial aid forms for college. Now I knew exactly
what I wanted out of my life and how to get there. And in three weeks,
I’d start classes at Ohio State.</p>
