<h4 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h4>
<p>As I started my second year of law school, I felt like I’d made it.
Fresh off a summer job at the U.S. Senate, I returned to New Haven with
a wealth of new friends and experiences. I had this beautiful
girlfriend, and I had a great job at a nice law firm almost in hand. I
knew that kids like me weren’t supposed to get this far, and I
congratulated myself for having beaten the odds. I was better than where
I came from: better than Mom and her addiction and better than the
father figures who’d walked out on me. I regretted only that Mamaw and
Papaw weren’t around to see it.</p>
<p>But there were signs that things weren’t going so well, particularly
in my relationship with Usha. We’d been dating for only a few months
when she stumbled upon an analogy that described me perfectly. I was,
she said, a turtle. “Whenever something bad happens—even a hint of
disagreement—you withdraw completely. It’s like you have a shell that
you hide in.”</p>
<p>It was true. I had no idea how to deal with relationship problems, so
I chose not to deal with them at all. I could scream at her when she did
something I didn’t like, but that seemed mean. Or I could withdraw and
get away. Those were the proverbial arrows in my quiver, and I had
nothing else. The thought of fighting with her reduced me to a morass of
the qualities I thought I hadn’t inherited from my family: stress,
sadness, fear, anxiety. It was all there, and it was intense.</p>
<p>So I tried to get away, but Usha wouldn’t let me. I tried to break
everything off multiple times, but she told me that was stupid unless I
didn’t care about her. So I’d scream and I’d yell. I’d do all of the
hateful things that my mother had done. And then I’d feel guilty and
desperately afraid. For so much of my life, I’d made Mom out to be a
kind of villain. And now I was acting like her. Nothing compares to the
fear that you’re becoming the monster in your closet.</p>
<p>During that second year of law school, Usha and I traveled to D.C.
for follow-up interviews with a few law firms. I returned to our hotel
room, dejected that I had just performed poorly with one of the firms I
really wanted to work for. When Usha tried to comfort me, to tell me
that I’d probably done better than I expected, but that even if I
hadn’t, there were other fish in the sea, I exploded. “Don’t tell me
that I did fine,” I yelled. “You’re just making an excuse for weakness.
I didn’t get here by making excuses for failure.”</p>
<p>I stormed out of the room and spent the next couple of hours on the
streets of D.C.’s business district. I thought about that time Mom took
me and our toy poodle to Middletown’s Comfort Inn after a screaming
match with Bob. We stayed there for a couple of days, until Mamaw
convinced Mom that she had to return home and face her problems like an
adult. And I thought about Mom during her childhood, running out the
back door with her mother and sister to avoid another night of terror
with her alcoholic father. I was a third-generation escaper.</p>
<p>I was near Ford’s Theatre, the historic location where John Wilkes
Booth shot Abraham Lincoln. About half a block from the theater is a
corner store that sells Lincoln memorabilia. In it, a large Lincoln
blow-up doll with an extraordinarily large grin gazes at those walking
by. I felt like this inflatable Lincoln was mocking me. Why the hell is
he smiling? I thought. Lincoln was melancholy to begin with, and if any
place invoked a smile, surely it wouldn’t be a stone’s throw away from
the place where someone shot him in the head.</p>
<p>I turned the corner, and after a few steps I saw Usha sitting on the
steps of Ford’s Theatre. She had run after me, worried about me being
alone. I realized then that I had a problem—that I must confront
whatever it was that had, for generations, caused those in my family to
hurt those whom they loved. I apologized profusely to Usha. I expected
her to tell me to go fuck myself, that it would take days to make up for
what I’d done, that I was a terrible person. A sincere apology is a
surrender, and when someone surrenders, you go in for the kill. But Usha
wasn’t interested in that. She calmly told me through her tears that it
was never acceptable to run away, that she was worried, and that I had
to learn how to talk to her. And then she gave me a hug and told me that
she accepted my apology and was glad I was okay. That was the end of
it.</p>
<p>Usha hadn’t learned how to fight in the hillbilly school of hard
knocks. The first time I visited her family for Thanksgiving, I was
amazed at the lack of drama. Usha’s mother didn’t complain about her
father behind his back. There were no suggestions that good family
friends were liars or backstabbers, no angry exchanges between a man’s
wife and the same man’s sister. Usha’s parents seemed to genuinely like
her grandmother and spoke of their siblings with love. When I asked her
father about a relatively estranged family member, I expected to hear a
rant about character flaws. What I heard instead was sympathy and a
little sadness but primarily a life lesson: “I still call him regularly
and check up on him. You can’t just cast aside family members because
they seem uninterested in you. You’ve got to make the effort, because
they’re family.”</p>
<p>I tried to go to a counselor, but it was just too weird. Talking to
some stranger about my feelings made me want to vomit. I did go to the
library, and I learned that behavior I considered commonplace was the
subject of pretty intense academic study. Psychologists call the
everyday occurrences of my and Lindsay’s life “adverse childhood
experiences,” or ACEs. ACEs are traumatic childhood events, and their
consequences reach far into adulthood. The trauma need not be physical.
The following events or feelings are some of the most common ACEs:</p>
<p>•being sworn at, insulted, or humiliated by parents</p>
<p>•being pushed, grabbed, or having something thrown at you</p>
<p>•feeling that your family didn’t support each other</p>
<p>•having parents who were separated or divorced</p>
<p>•living with an alcoholic or a drug user</p>
<p>•living with someone who was depressed or attempted suicide</p>
<p>•watching a loved one be physically abused.</p>
<p>ACEs happen everywhere, in every community. But studies have shown
that ACEs are far more common in my corner of the demographic world. A
report by the Wisconsin Children’s Trust Fund showed that among those
with a college degree or more (the non–working class), fewer than half
had experienced an ACE. Among the working class, well over half had at
least one ACE, while about 40 percent had multiple ACEs. This is really
striking—four in every ten working-class people had faced multiple
instances of childhood trauma. For the non–working class, that number
was 29 percent.</p>
<p>I gave a quiz to Aunt Wee, Uncle Dan, Lindsay, and Usha that
psychologists use to measure the number of ACEs a person has faced. Aunt
Wee scored a seven—higher even than Lindsay and me, who each scored a
six. Dan and Usha—the two people whose families seemed nice to the point
of oddity—each scored a zero. The weird people were the ones who hadn’t
faced any childhood trauma.</p>
<p>Children with multiple ACEs are more likely to struggle with anxiety
and depression, to suffer from heart disease and obesity, and to
contract certain types of cancers. They’re also more likely to
underperform in school and suffer from relationship instability as
adults. Even excessive shouting can damage a kid’s sense of security and
contribute to mental health and behavioral issues down the road.</p>
<p>Harvard pediatricians have studied the effect that childhood trauma
has on the mind. In addition to later negative health consequences, the
doctors found that constant stress can actually change the chemistry of
a child’s brain. Stress, after all, is triggered by a physiological
reaction. It’s the consequence of adrenaline and other hormones flooding
our system, usually in response to some kind of stimulus. This is the
classic fight-or-flight response that we learn about in grade school. It
sometimes produces incredible feats of strength and bravery from
ordinary people. It’s how mothers can lift heavy objects when their
children are trapped underneath, and how an unarmed elderly woman can
fight off a mountain lion with her bare hands to save her husband.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fight-or-flight response is a destructive constant
companion. As Dr. Nadine Burke Harris put it, the response is great “if
you’re in a forest and there’s a bear. The problem is when that bear
comes home from the bar every night.” When that happens, the Harvard
researchers found, the sector of the brain that deals with highly
stressful situations takes over. “Significant stress in early
childhood,” they write, “. . . result[s] in a hyperresponsive or
chronically activated physiologic stress response, along with increased
potential for fear and anxiety.” For kids like me, the part of the brain
that deals with stress and conflict is always activated—the switch
flipped indefinitely. We are constantly ready to fight or flee, because
there is constant exposure to the bear, whether that bear is an
alcoholic dad or an unhinged mom. We become hardwired for conflict. And
that wiring remains, even when there’s no more conflict to be had.</p>
<p>It’s not just fighting. By almost any measure, American working-class
families experience a level of instability unseen elsewhere in the
world. Consider, for instance, Mom’s revolving door of father figures.
No other country experiences anything like this. In France, the
percentage of children exposed to three or more maternal partners is 0.5
percent—about one in two hundred. The second highest share is 2.6
percent, in Sweden, or about one in forty. In the United States, the
figure is a shocking 8.2 percent—about one in twelve—and the figure is
even higher in the working class. The most depressing part is that
relationship instability, like home chaos, is a vicious cycle. As
sociologists Paula Fornby and Andrew Cherlin found, a “growing body of
literature suggests that children who experience multiple transitions in
family structure may fare worse developmentally than children raised in
stable two-parent families and perhaps even than children raised in
stable, single-parent families.”</p>
<p>For many kids, the first impulse is escape, but people who lurch
toward the exit rarely choose the right door. This is how my aunt found
herself married at sixteen to an abusive husband. It’s how my mom, the
salutatorian of her high school class, had both a baby and a divorce,
but not a single college credit under her belt before her teenage years
were over. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Chaos begets chaos.
Instability begets instability. Welcome to family life for the American
hillbilly.</p>
<p>For me, understanding my past and knowing that I wasn’t doomed gave
me the hope and fortitude to deal with the demons of my youth. And
though it’s cliché, the best medicine was talking about it with the
people who understood. I asked Aunt Wee if she had similar relationship
experiences, and she answered almost reflexively: “Of course. I was
always ready for battle with Dan,” she told me. “Sometimes I’d even
brace myself for a big argument—like physically put myself in a fighting
position—before he stopped speaking.” I was shocked. Aunt Wee and Dan
have the most successful marriage I’ve seen. Even after twenty years,
they interact like they started dating last year. Her marriage got even
better, she said, only after she realized that she didn’t have to be on
guard all the time.</p>
<p>Lindsay told me the same. “When I fought with Kevin, I’d insult him
and tell him to do what I knew he wanted to do anyway—leave. He’d always
ask me, ‘What’s wrong with you? Why do you fight with me like I’m your
enemy?’” The answer is that, in our home, it was often difficult to tell
friend from foe. Sixteen years later, though, and Lindsay is still
married.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about myself, about the emotional triggers I’d
learned over eighteen years of living at home. I realized that I
mistrusted apologies, as they were often used to convince you to lower
your guard. It was an “I’m sorry” that convinced me to take that fateful
car ride with Mom more than a decade earlier. And I began to understand
why I used words as weapons: That’s what everyone around me did; I did
it to survive. Disagreements were war, and you played to win the
game.</p>
<p>I didn’t unlearn these lessons overnight. I continue to struggle with
conflict, to fight the statistical odds that sometimes seem to bear down
on me. Sometimes it’s easier knowing that the statistics suggest I
should be in jail or fathering my fourth illegitimate child. And
sometimes it’s harder—conflict and family breakdown seem like the
destiny I can’t possibly escape. In my worst moments, I convince myself
that there is no exit, and no matter how much I fight old demons, they
are as much an inheritance as my blue eyes and brown hair. The sad fact
is that I couldn’t do it without Usha. Even at my best, I’m a delayed
explosion—I can be defused, but only with skill and precision. It’s not
just that I’ve learned to control myself but that Usha has learned how
to manage me. Put two of me in the same home and you have a positively
radioactive situation. It’s no surprise that every single person in my
family who has built a successful home—Aunt Wee, Lindsay, my cousin
Gail—married someone from outside our little culture.</p>
<p>This realization shattered the narrative I told about my life. In my
own head, I was better than my past. I was strong. I left town as soon
as I could, served my country in the Marines, excelled at Ohio State,
and made it to the country’s top law school. I had no demons, no
character flaws, no problems. But that just wasn’t true. The things I
wanted most in the entire world—a happy partner and a happy
home—required constant mental focus. My self-image was bitterness
masquerading as arrogance. A few weeks into my second year of law
school, I hadn’t spoken to Mom in many months, longer than at any point
in my life. I realized that of all the emotions I felt toward my
mother—love, pity, forgiveness, anger, hatred, and dozens of others—I
had never tried sympathy. I had never tried to understand my mom. At my
most empathetic, I figured she suffered from some terrible genetic
defect, and I hoped I hadn’t inherited it. As I increasingly saw Mom’s
behavior in myself, I tried to understand her.</p>
<p>Uncle Jimmy told me that, long ago, he’d walked in on a discussion
between Mamaw and Papaw. Mom had gotten herself in some trouble and they
needed to bail her out. These bailouts were common, and they always came
with theoretical strings attached. She had to budget, they’d tell her,
and they’d put her on some arbitrary plan they’d designed themselves.
The plan was the cost of their help. As they sat and discussed things,
Papaw buried his head in his hands and did something Uncle Jimmy had
never seen him do: He wept. “I’ve failed her,” he cried. He kept on
repeating, “I’ve failed her; I’ve failed her; I’ve failed my baby
girl.”</p>
<p>Papaw’s rare breakdown strikes at the heart of an important question
for hillbillies like me: How much of our lives, good and bad, should we
credit to our personal decisions, and how much is just the inheritance
of our culture, our families, and our parents who have failed their
children? How much is Mom’s life her own fault? Where does blame stop
and sympathy begin?</p>
<p>All of us have opinions. Uncle Jimmy reacts viscerally to the idea
that any of the blame for Mom’s choices can be laid at Papaw’s feet. “He
didn’t fail her. Whatever happened to her, it’s her own damned fault.”
Aunt Wee sees things in much the same way, and who can blame her? Just
nineteen months younger than Mom, she saw the worst of Mamaw and Papaw
and made her own share of mistakes before coming out on the other side.
If she can do it, then so should Mom. Lindsay has a bit more sympathy
and thinks that just as our lives left us with demons, Mom’s life must
have done the same to her. But at some point, Lindsay says, you have to
stop making excuses and take responsibility.</p>
<p>My own view is mixed. Whatever might be said about my mom’s parents’
roles in my life, their constant fighting and alcoholism must have taken
its toll on her. Even when they were children, the fighting seemed to
affect my aunt and mother differently. While Aunt Wee would plead with
her parents to calm down, or provoke her father in order to take the
heat off her mother, Mom would hide, or run away, or collapse on the
floor with her hands over her ears. She didn’t handle it as well as her
brother and sister. In some ways, Mom is the Vance child who lost the
game of statistics. If anything, my family is probably lucky that only
one of them lost that game.</p>
<p>What I do know is that Mom is no villain. She loves Lindsay and me.
She tried desperately to be a good mother. Sometimes she succeeded;
sometimes she didn’t. She tried to find happiness in love and work, but
she listened too much to the wrong voice in her head. But Mom deserves
much of the blame. No person’s childhood gives him or her a perpetual
moral get-out-of-jail-free card—not Lindsay, not Aunt Wee, not me, and
not Mom.</p>
<p>Throughout my life, no one could inspire such intense emotions as my
mom, not even Mamaw. When I was a kid, I loved her so much that when a
kindergarten classmate made fun of her umbrella, I punched him in the
face. When I watched her succumb again and again to addiction, I hated
her and wished sometimes that she would take enough narcotics to rid me
and Lindsay of her for good. When she lay sobbing in bed after another
failed relationship, I felt a rage that could have driven me to
kill.</p>
<p>Toward the end of law school, Lindsay called to tell me that Mom had
taken to a new drug—heroin—and had decided to give rehab another try. I
didn’t know how many times Mom had been to rehab, how many nights she’d
spent in the hospital barely conscious because of some drug. So I
shouldn’t have been surprised or all that bothered, but “heroin” just
has a certain ring to it; it’s like the Kentucky Derby of drugs. When I
learned of Mom’s newest substance of choice, I felt a cloud hanging over
me for weeks. Maybe I had finally lost all hope for her.</p>
<p>The emotion Mom inspired then was not hatred, or love, or rage, but
fear. Fear for her safety. Fear for Lindsay having to deal yet again
with Mom’s problems while I lived hundreds of miles away. Fear most of
all that I hadn’t escaped a goddamned thing. Months away from graduating
from Yale Law, I should have felt on top of the world. Instead, I found
myself wondering the same thing I’d wondered for much of the past year:
whether people like us can ever truly change.</p>
<p>When Usha and I graduated, the crew that watched me walk across the
stage numbered eighteen, including my cousins Denise and Gail, the
daughters, respectively, of Mamaw’s brothers David and Pet. Usha’s
parents and uncle—fantastic people, though considerably less rowdy than
our crew—made the trip, too. It was the first time that her family met
mine, and we behaved. (Though Denise had some choice words for the
modern “art” at the museum we visited!)</p>
<p>Mom’s bout with addiction ended as they always did—in an uneasy
truce. She didn’t make the trip to see me graduate, but she wasn’t using
drugs at that moment, and that was all right with me. Justice Sonya
Sotomayor spoke at our commencement and advised that it was okay to be
unsure about what we wanted to do with ourselves. I think she was
talking about our careers, but for me it had a much broader meaning. I
had learned much about law at Yale. But I’d also learned that this new
world would always seem a bit foreign to me, and that being a hillbilly
meant sometimes not knowing the difference between love and war. When we
graduated, that’s what I was most unsure about.</p>
