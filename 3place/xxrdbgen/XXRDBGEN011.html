<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>Mamaw knew little of how this arrangement affected me, partly by
design. During a long Christmas break, just a couple of months after I’d
moved in with my new stepfather, I called her to complain. But when she
answered, I could hear the voices of family in the background—my aunt, I
thought, and cousin Gail, and perhaps some others. The background noise
suggested holiday merriment, and I didn’t have the heart to tell her
what I had called to say: that I loathed living with these strangers and
that everything that had made my life to that point tolerable—the
reprieve of her house, the company of my sister—had apparently vanished.
I asked her to tell everyone whose voice I heard in the background that
I loved them, and then I hung up the phone and marched upstairs to watch
TV. I had never felt so alone. Happily, I continued to attend
Middletown’s schools, which kept me in touch with my school friends and
gave me an excuse to spend a few hours at Mamaw’s. During active school
sessions, I saw her a few times a week, and every time I did, she
reminded me of the importance of doing well academically. She often
remarked that if anyone in our family “made it,” it would be me. I
didn’t have the heart to tell her what was really happening. I was
supposed to be a lawyer or a doctor or a businessman, not a high school
dropout. But I was much closer to dropping out than I was to anything
else.</p>
<p>She learned the truth when Mom came to me one morning demanding a jar
of clean urine. I had stayed at Mamaw’s the night before and was getting
ready for school when Mom walked in, frantic and out of breath. She had
to submit to random urinalyses from the nursing board in order to keep
her license, and someone had called that morning demanding a sample by
the end of the day. Mamaw’s piss was dirtied with a half dozen
prescription drugs, so I was the only candidate.</p>
<p>Mom’s demand came with a strong air of entitlement. She had no
remorse, no sense that she was asking me to do something wrong. Nor was
there any guilt over the fact that she had broken yet another promise to
never use drugs.</p>
<p>I refused. Sensing my resistance, Mom transitioned. She became
apologetic and desperate. She cried and begged. “I promise I’ll do
better. I promise.” I had heard it many times before, and I didn’t
believe it even a little. Lindsay once told me that, above all, Mom was
a survivor. She survived her childhood, she survived the men who came
and went. She survived successive brushes with the law. And now she was
doing everything she could to survive an encounter with the nursing
board.</p>
<p>I exploded. I told Mom that if she wanted clean piss, she should stop
fucking up her life and get it from her own bladder. I told Mamaw that
enabling Mom made it worse and that if she had put her foot down thirty
years earlier, then maybe Mom wouldn’t be begging her son for clean
piss. I told Mom that she was a shitty mother and I told Mamaw that she
was a shitty mother, too. The color drained from Mamaw’s face, and she
refused to even look me in the eye. What I had said had clearly struck a
nerve.</p>
<p>Though I meant these things, I also knew that my urine might not be
clean. Mom collapsed onto the couch, crying quietly, but Mamaw wouldn’t
give in so easily, even though I’d wounded her with my criticism. I
pulled Mamaw into the bathroom and whispered a confession—that I had
smoked Ken’s pot twice in the past few weeks. “I can’t give it to her.
If Mom takes my pee, we could both be in trouble.”</p>
<p>First, Mamaw assuaged my fears. A couple of hits of pot over three
weeks wouldn’t show up on the screen, she told me. “Besides, you
probably didn’t know what the hell you were doing. You didn’t inhale,
even if you tried.” Then she addressed the morality of it. “I know this
isn’t right, honey. But she’s your mother and she’s my daughter. And
maybe, if we help her this time, she’ll finally learn her lesson.”</p>
<p>It was the eternal hope, the thing to which I couldn’t say no. That
hope drove me to voluntarily attend those many N.A. meetings, consume
books on addiction, and participate in Mom’s treatment to the fullest
extent that I could. It had driven me to get in the car with her when I
was twelve, knowing that her emotional state could lead her to do
something she’d regret later. Mamaw never lost that hope, after more
heartache and more disappointment than I could possibly fathom. Her life
was a clinic in how to lose faith in people, but Mamaw always found a
way to believe in the people she loved. So I don’t regret relenting.
Giving Mom that piss was wrong, but I’ll never regret following Mamaw’s
lead. Her hope allowed her to forgive Papaw after the rough years of
their marriage. And it convinced her to take me in when I needed her
most.</p>
<p>Though I followed Mamaw’s lead, something inside me broke that
morning. I went to school red-eyed from crying and regretful that I’d
helped. A few weeks earlier, I had sat with Mom at a Chinese buffet as
she tried in vain to shovel food in her mouth. It’s a memory that still
makes my blood boil: Mom unable to open her eyes or close her mouth,
spooning food in as it fell back on the plate. Other people stared at
us, Ken was speechless, and Mom was oblivious. It was a prescription
pain pill (or many of them) that had done this to her. I hated her for
it and promised myself that if she ever did drugs again, I’d leave the
house.</p>
<p>The urine episode was the last straw for Mamaw, too. When I came home
from school, Mamaw told me that she wanted me to stay with her
permanently, with no more moving in between. Mom seemed not to care: She
needed a “break,” she said, I supposed from being a mother. She and Ken
didn’t last much longer. By the end of sophomore year, she had moved out
of his house and I had moved in with Mamaw, never to return to the homes
of Mom and her men. At least she passed her piss test.</p>
<p>I didn’t even have to pack, because much of what I owned remained at
Mamaw’s as I bounced from place to place. She didn’t approve of me
taking too many of my belongings to Ken’s house, convinced that he and
his kids might steal my socks and shirts. (Neither Ken nor his children
ever stole from me.) Though I loved living with her, my new home tested
my patience on many levels. I still harbored the insecurity that I was
burdening her. More important, she was a hard woman to live with,
quick-witted and sharp-tongued. If I didn’t take out the garbage, she
told me to “stop being a lazy piece of shit.” When I forgot to do my
homework, she called me “shit for brains” and reminded me that unless I
studied, I’d amount to nothing. She demanded that I play card games with
her—usually gin rummy—and she never lost. “You are the worst fucking
cardplayer I’ve ever met,” she’d gloat. (That one didn’t make me feel
bad: She said it to everyone she beat, and she beat everyone at gin
rummy.)</p>
<p>Years later, every single one of my relatives—Aunt Wee, Uncle Jimmy,
even Lindsay—repeated some version of “Mamaw was really hard on you. Too
hard.” There were three rules in her house: Get good grades, get a job,
and “get off your ass and help me.” There was no set chore list; I just
had to help her with whatever she was doing. And she never told me what
to do—she just yelled at me if she did anything and I wasn’t
helping.</p>
<p>But we had a lot of fun. Mamaw had a much bigger bark than bite, at
least with me. She once ordered me to watch a TV show with her on a
Friday night, a creepy murder mystery, the type of show Mamaw loved to
watch. At the climax of the show, during a moment designed to make the
viewer jump, Mamaw flipped off the lights and screamed in my ear. She’d
seen the episode before and knew what was coming. She made me sit there
for forty-five minutes just so she could scare me at the appointed
time.</p>
<p>The best part about living with Mamaw was that I began to understand
what made her tick. Until then, I had resented how rarely we traveled to
Kentucky after Mamaw Blanton’s death. The decline in visits wasn’t
noticeable at first, but by the time I started middle school, we visited
Kentucky only a few times a year for a few days at a time. Living with
Mamaw, I learned that she and her sister, Rose—a woman of uncommon
kindness—had a falling-out after their mother died. Mamaw had hoped that
the old house would become a sort of family time share, while Rose had
hoped that the house would go to her son and his family. Rose had a
point: None of the siblings who lived in Ohio or Indiana visited often
enough, so it made sense to give the house to someone who would use it.
But Mamaw feared that without a home base, her children and
grandchildren would have no place to stay during their visits to
Jackson. She, too, had a point.</p>
<p>I started to understand that Mamaw saw returning to Jackson as a duty
to endure rather than a source of enjoyment. To me, Jackson was about my
uncles, and chasing turtles, and finding peace from the instability that
plagued my Ohio existence. Jackson gave me a shared home with Mamaw, a
three-hour road trip to tell and listen to stories, and a place where
everyone knew me as the grandson of the famous Jim and Bonnie Vance.
Jackson was something much different to her. It was the place where she
sometimes went hungry as a child, from which she ran in the wake of a
teenage pregnancy scandal, and where so many of her friends had given
their lives in the mines. I wanted to escape to Jackson; she had escaped
from it.</p>
<p>In her old age, with limited mobility, Mamaw loved to watch TV. She
preferred raunchy humor and epic dramas, so she had a lot of options.
But her favorite show by far was the HBO mob story The Sopranos. Looking
back, it’s hardly surprising that a show about fiercely loyal, sometimes
violent outsiders resonated with Mamaw. Change the names and dates, and
the Italian Mafia starts to look a lot like the Hatfield-McCoy dispute
back in Appalachia. The show’s main character, Tony Soprano, was a
violent killer, an objectively terrible person by almost any standard.
But Mamaw respected his loyalty and the fact that he would go to any
length to protect the honor of his family. Though he murdered countless
enemies and drank excessively, the only criticism she ever levied
against him involved his infidelity. “He’s always sleeping around. I
don’t like that.”</p>
<p>I also saw for the first time Mamaw’s love of children, not as an
object of her affection but as an observer of it. She often babysat for
Lindsay’s or Aunt Wee’s young kids. One day she had both of Aunt Wee’s
girls for the day and Aunt Wee’s dog in the backyard. When the dog
barked, Mamaw screamed, “Shut up, you son of a bitch.” My cousin Bonnie
Rose ran to the back door and began screaming over and over, “Son of a
bitch! Son of a bitch!” Mamaw hobbled over to Bonnie Rose and scooped
her up in her arms. “Shhh! You can’t say that or you’ll get me in
trouble.” But she was laughing so hard that she could barely get the
words out. A few weeks later, I got home from school and asked Mamaw how
her day had gone. She told me that she’d had a great day because she’d
been watching Lindsay’s son Kameron. “He asked me if he could say ‘fuck’
like I do. I told him yes, but only at my house.” Then she chuckled
quietly to herself. Regardless of how she felt, whether her emphysema
made it difficult to breathe or her hip hurt so badly that she could
barely walk, she never turned down an opportunity to “spend time with
those babies,” as she put it. Mamaw loved them, and I began to
understand why she had always dreamed of becoming a lawyer for abused
and neglected children.</p>
<p>At some point, Mamaw underwent major back surgery to help with the
pain that made walking difficult. She landed in a nursing home for a few
months to recover, forcing me to live alone, an experience that happily
didn’t last long. Every night she called Lindsay, Aunt Wee, or me and
made the same request: “I hate the damned food here. Can you go to Taco
Bell and get me a bean burrito?” Indeed, Mamaw hated everything about
the nursing home and once asked me to promise that if she ever faced a
permanent stay, I’d take her .44 Magnum and put a bullet in her head.
“Mamaw, you can’t ask me to do that. I’d go to jail for the rest of my
life.” “Well,” she said, pausing for a moment to reflect, “then get your
hands on some arsenic. That way no one will know.” Her back surgery, it
turned out, was completely unnecessary. She had a broken hip, and as
soon as a surgeon repaired it, she was back on her feet, though she used
a walker or cane from then on. Now that I’m a lawyer, I marvel that we
never considered a medical malpractice suit against the doctor who
operated unnecessarily on her back. But Mamaw wouldn’t have allowed it:
She didn’t believe in using the legal system until you had to.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’d see Mom every few days, and sometimes I’d go a couple
of weeks without hearing from her at all. After one breakup, she spent a
few months on Mamaw’s couch, and we both enjoyed her company. Mom tried,
in her own way: When she was working, she’d always give me money on
paydays, almost certainly more than she could afford. For reasons I
never quite understood, Mom equated money with affection. Perhaps she
felt that I would never appreciate that she loved me unless she offered
a wad of spending money. But I never cared about the money. I just
wanted her to be healthy.</p>
<p>Not even my closest friends knew that I lived in my grandma’s house.
I recognized that though many of my peers lacked the traditional
American family, mine was more nontraditional than most. And we were
poor, a status Mamaw wore like a badge of honor but one I’d hardly come
to grips with. I didn’t wear clothes from Abercrombie andandandand Fitch
or American Eagle unless I’d received them for Christmas. When Mamaw
picked me up from school, I’d ask her not to get out of the car lest my
friends see her—wearing her uniform of baggy jeans and a men’s
T-shirt—with a giant menthol cigarette hanging from her lip. When people
asked, I lied and told them that I lived with my mom, that she and I
took care of my ailing grandmother. Even today, I still regret that far
too many high school friends and acquaintances never knew Mamaw was the
best thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>My junior year, I tested into the honors Advanced Math class—a hybrid
of trigonometry, advanced algebra, and precalculus. The class’s
instructor, Ron Selby, enjoyed legendary status among the students for
his brilliance and high demands. In twenty years, he had never missed a
day of school. According to Middletown High School legend, a student
called in a bomb threat during one of Selby’s exams, hiding the
explosive device in a bag in his locker. With the entire school
evacuated outside, Selby marched into the school, retrieved the contents
of the kid’s locker, marched outside, and threw those contents into a
trash can. “I’ve had that kid in class; he’s not smart enough to make a
functioning bomb,” Selby told the police officers gathered at the
school. “Now let my students go back to class to finish their
exams.”</p>
<p>Mamaw loved stories like this, and though she never met Selby, she
admired him and encouraged me to follow his lead. Selby encouraged (but
didn’t require) his students to obtain advanced graphing calculators—the
Texas Instruments model 89 was the latest and greatest. We didn’t have
cell phones, and we didn’t have nice clothes, but Mamaw made sure that I
had one of those graphing calculators. This taught me an important
lesson about Mamaw’s values, and it forced me to engage with school in a
way I never had before. If Mamaw could drop 80 on a graphing
calculator—she insisted that I spend none of my own money—then I had
better take schoolwork more seriously. I owed it to her, and she
reminded me of it constantly. “Have you finished your work for that
Selby teacher?” “No, Mamaw, not yet.” “You damn well better start. I
didn’t spend every penny I had on that little computer so you could fuck
around all day.”</p>
<p>Those three years with Mamaw—uninterrupted and alone—saved me. I
didn’t notice the causality of the change, how living with her turned my
life around. I didn’t notice that my grades began to improve immediately
after I moved in. And I couldn’t have known that I was making lifelong
friends.</p>
<p>During that time, Mamaw and I started to talk about the problems in
our community. Mamaw encouraged me to get a job—she told me that it
would be good for me and that I needed to learn the value of a dollar.
When her encouragement fell on deaf ears, she then demanded that I get a
job, and so I did, as a cashier at Dillman’s, a local grocery store.</p>
<p>Working as a cashier turned me into an amateur sociologist. A
frenetic stress animated so many of our customers. One of our neighbors
would walk in and yell at me for the smallest of transgressions—not
smiling at her, or bagging the groceries too heavy one day or too light
the next. Some came into the store in a hurry, pacing between aisles,
looking frantically for a particular item. But others waded through the
aisles deliberately, carefully marking each item off of their list. Some
folks purchased a lot of canned and frozen food, while others
consistently arrived at the checkout counter with carts piled high with
fresh produce. The more harried a customer, the more they purchased
precooked or frozen food, the more likely they were to be poor. And I
knew they were poor because of the clothes they wore or because they
purchased their food with food stamps. After a few months, I came home
and asked Mamaw why only poor people bought baby formula. “Don’t rich
people have babies, too?” Mamaw had no answers, and it would be many
years before I learned that rich folks are considerably more likely to
breast-feed their children.</p>
<p>As my job taught me a little more about America’s class divide, it
also imbued me with a bit of resentment, directed toward both the
wealthy and my own kind. The owners of Dillman’s were old-fashioned, so
they allowed people with good credit to run grocery tabs, some of which
surpassed a thousand dollars. I knew that if any of my relatives walked
in and ran up a bill of over a thousand dollars, they’d be asked to pay
immediately. I hated the feeling that my boss counted my people as less
trustworthy than those who took their groceries home in a Cadillac. But
I got over it: One day, I told myself, I’ll have my own damned tab.</p>
<p>I also learned how people gamed the welfare system. They’d buy two
dozen-packs of soda with food stamps and then sell them at a discount
for cash. They’d ring up their orders separately, buying food with food
stamps, and beer, wine, and cigarettes with cash. They’d regularly go
through the checkout line speaking on their cell phones. I could never
understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of
government largesse enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.</p>
<p>Mamaw listened intently to my experiences at Dillman’s. We began to
view much of our fellow working class with mistrust. Most of us were
struggling to get by, but we made do, worked hard, and hoped for a
better life. But a large minority was content to live off the dole.
Every two weeks, I’d get a small paycheck and notice the line where
federal and state income taxes were deducted from my wages. At least as
often, our drug-addict neighbor would buy T-bone steaks, which I was too
poor to buy for myself but was forced by Uncle Sam to buy for someone
else. This was my mind-set when I was seventeen, and though I’m far less
angry today than I was then, it was my first indication that the
policies of Mamaw’s “party of the working man”—the Democrats—weren’t all
they were cracked up to be.</p>
<p>Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain
how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly
Republican in less than a generation. Some blame race relations and the
Democratic Party’s embrace of the civil rights movement. Others cite
religious faith and the hold that social conservatism has on
evangelicals in that region. A big part of the explanation lies in the
fact that many in the white working class saw precisely what I did,
working at Dillman’s. As far back as the 1970s, the white working class
began to turn to Richard Nixon because of a perception that, as one man
put it, government was “payin’ people who are on welfare today doin’
nothin’! They’re laughin’ at our society! And we’re all hardworkin’
people and we’re gettin’ laughed at for workin’ every day!”20</p>
<p>At around that time, our neighbor—one of Mamaw and Papaw’s oldest
friends—registered the house next to ours for Section 8. Section 8 is a
government program that offers low-income residents a voucher to rent
housing. Mamaw’s friend had little luck renting his property, but when
he qualified his house for the Section 8 voucher, he virtually assured
that would change. Mamaw saw it as a betrayal, ensuring that “bad”
people would move into the neighborhood and drive down property
values.</p>
<p>Despite our efforts to draw bright lines between the working and
nonworking poor, Mamaw and I recognized that we shared a lot in common
with those whom we thought gave our people a bad name. Those Section 8
recipients looked a lot like us. The matriarch of the first family to
move in next door was born in Kentucky but moved north at a young age as
her parents sought a better life. She’d gotten involved with a couple of
men, each of whom had left her with a child but no support. She was
nice, and so were her kids. But the drugs and the late-night fighting
revealed troubles that too many hillbilly transplants knew too well.
Confronted with such a realization of her own family’s struggle, Mamaw
grew frustrated and angry.</p>
<p>From that anger sprang Bonnie Vance the social policy expert: “She’s
a lazy whore, but she wouldn’t be if she was forced to get a job”; “I
hate those fuckers for giving these people the money to move into our
neighborhood.” She’d rant against the people we’d see in the grocery
store: “I can’t understand why people who’ve worked all their lives
scrape by while these deadbeats buy liquor and cell phone coverage with
our tax money.”</p>
<p>These were bizarre views for my bleeding-heart grandma. And if she
blasted the government for doing too much one day, she’d blast it for
doing too little the next. The government, after all, was just helping
poor people find a place to live, and my grandma loved the idea of
anyone helping the poor. She had no philosophical objection to Section 8
vouchers. So the Democrat in her would resurface. She’d rant about the
lack of jobs and wonder aloud whether that was why our neighbor couldn’t
find a good man. In her more compassionate moments, Mamaw asked if it
made any sense that our society could afford aircraft carriers but not
drug treatment facilities—like Mom’s—for everyone. Sometimes she’d
criticize the faceless rich, whom she saw as far too unwilling to carry
their fair share of the social burden. Mamaw saw every ballot failure of
the local school improvement tax (and there were many) as an indictment
of our society’s failure to provide a quality education to kids like
me.</p>
<p>Mamaw’s sentiments occupied wildly different parts of the political
spectrum. Depending on her mood, Mamaw was a radical conservative or a
European-style social Democrat. Because of this, I initially assumed
that Mamaw was an unreformed simpleton and that as soon as she opened
her mouth about policy or politics, I might as well close my ears. Yet I
quickly realized that in Mamaw’s contradictions lay great wisdom. I had
spent so long just surviving my world, but now that I had a little space
to observe it, I began to see the world as Mamaw did. I was scared,
confused, angry, and heartbroken. I’d blame large businesses for closing
up shop and moving overseas, and then I’d wonder if I might have done
the same thing. I’d curse our government for not helping enough, and
then I’d wonder if, in its attempts to help, it actually made the
problem worse.</p>
<p>Mamaw could spew venom like a Marine Corps drill instructor, but what
she saw in our community didn’t just piss her off. It broke her heart.
Behind the drugs, and the fighting matches, and the financial struggles,
these were people with serious problems, and they were hurting. Our
neighbors had a kind of desperate sadness in their lives. You’d see it
in how the mother would grin but never really smile, or in the jokes
that the teenage girl told about her mother “smacking the shit out of
her.” I knew what awkward humor like this was meant to conceal because
I’d used it in the past. Grin and bear it, says the adage. If anyone
appreciated this, Mamaw did.</p>
<p>The problems of our community hit close to home. Mom’s struggles
weren’t some isolated incident. They were replicated, replayed, and
relived by many of the people who, like us, had moved hundreds of miles
in search of a better life. There was no end in sight. Mamaw had thought
she escaped the poverty of the hills, but the poverty—emotional, if not
financial—had followed her. Something had made her later years eerily
similar to her earliest ones. What was happening? What were our
neighbor’s teenage daughter’s prospects? Certainly the odds were against
her, with a home life like that. This raised the question: What would
happen to me?</p>
<p>I was unable to answer these questions in a way that didn’t implicate
something deep within the place I called home. What I knew is that other
people didn’t live like we did. When I visited Uncle Jimmy, I did not
wake to the screams of neighbors. In Aunt Wee and Dan’s neighborhood,
homes were beautiful and lawns well manicured, and police came around to
smile and wave but never to load someone’s mom or dad in the back of
their cruiser.</p>
<p>So I wondered what was different about us—not just me and my family
but our neighborhood and our town and everyone from Jackson to
Middletown and beyond. When Mom was arrested a couple of years earlier,
the neighborhood’s porches and front yards filled with spectators;
there’s no embarrassment like waving to the neighbors right after the
cops have carted your mother off. Mom’s exploits were undoubtedly
extreme, but all of us had seen the show before with different
neighbors. These sorts of things had their own rhythm. A mild screaming
match might invite a few cracked shutters or peeking eyes behind the
shades. If things escalated a bit, bedrooms would illuminate as people
awoke to investigate the commotion. And if things got out of hand, the
police would come and take someone’s drunk dad or unhinged mom down to
the city building. That building housed the tax collector, the public
utilities, and even a small museum, but all the kids in my neighborhood
knew it as the home of Middletown’s short-term jail.</p>
<p>I consumed books about social policy and the working poor. One book
in particular, a study by eminent sociologist William Julius Wilson
called The Truly Disadvantaged, struck a nerve. I was sixteen the first
time I read it, and though I didn’t fully understand it all, I grasped
the core thesis. As millions migrated north to factory jobs, the
communities that sprouted up around those factories were vibrant but
fragile: When the factories shut their doors, the people left behind
were trapped in towns and cities that could no longer support such large
populations with high-quality work. Those who could—generally the well
educated, wealthy, or well connected—left, leaving behind communities of
poor people. These remaining folks were the “truly disadvantaged”—unable
to find good jobs on their own and surrounded by communities that
offered little in the way of connections or social support.</p>
<p>Wilson’s book spoke to me. I wanted to write him a letter and tell
him that he had described my home perfectly. That it resonated so
personally is odd, however, because he wasn’t writing about the
hillbilly transplants from Appalachia—he was writing about black people
in the inner cities. The same was true of Charles Murray’s seminal
Losing Ground, another book about black folks that could have been
written about hillbillies—which addressed the way our government
encouraged social decay through the welfare state.</p>
<p>Though insightful, neither of these books fully answered the
questions that plagued me: Why didn’t our neighbor leave that abusive
man? Why did she spend her money on drugs? Why couldn’t she see that her
behavior was destroying her daughter? Why were all of these things
happening not just to our neighbor but to my mom? It would be years
before I learned that no single book, or expert, or field could fully
explain the problems of hillbillies in modern America. Our elegy is a
sociological one, yes, but it is also about psychology and community and
culture and faith.</p>
<p>During my junior year of high school, our neighbor Pattie called her
landlord to report a leaky roof. The landlord arrived and found Pattie
topless, stoned, and unconscious on her living room couch. Upstairs the
bathtub was overflowing—hence, the leaking roof. Pattie had apparently
drawn herself a bath, taken a few prescription painkillers, and passed
out. The top floor of her home and many of her family’s possessions were
ruined. This is the reality of our community. It’s about a naked druggie
destroying what little of value exists in her life. It’s about children
who lose their toys and clothes to a mother’s addiction.</p>
<p>Another neighbor lived alone in a big pink house. She was a recluse,
a neighborhood mystery. She came outside only to smoke. She never said
hello, and her lights were always off. She and her husband had divorced,
and her children had landed in jail. She was extremely obese—as a child,
I used to wonder if she hated the outdoors because she was too heavy to
move.</p>
<p>There were the neighbors down the street, a younger woman with a
toddler and her middle-aged boyfriend. The boyfriend worked, and the
woman spent her days watching The Young and the Restless. Her young son
was adorable, and he loved Mamaw. At all times of the day—one time, past
midnight—he would wander to her doorstep and ask for a snack. His mother
had all the time in the world, but she couldn’t keep a close enough
watch on her child to prevent him from straying into the homes of
strangers. Sometimes his diaper would need changing. Mamaw once called
social services on the woman, hoping they’d somehow rescue the young
boy. They did nothing. So Mamaw used my nephew’s diapers and kept a
watchful eye on the neighborhood, always looking for signs of her
“little buddy.”</p>
<p>My sister’s friend lived in a small duplex with her mother (a welfare
queen if one ever existed). She had seven siblings, most of them from
the same father—which was, unfortunately, a rarity. Her mother had never
held a job and seemed interested “only in breeding,” as Mamaw put it.
Her kids never had a chance. One ended up in an abusive relationship
that produced a child before the mom was old enough to purchase
cigarettes. The oldest overdosed on drugs and was arrested not long
after he graduated from high school.</p>
<p>This was my world: a world of truly irrational behavior. We spend our
way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and iPads. Our children wear
nice clothes thanks to high-interest credit cards and payday loans. We
purchase homes we don’t need, refinance them for more spending money,
and declare bankruptcy, often leaving them full of garbage in our wake.
Thrift is inimical to our being. We spend to pretend that we’re
upper-class. And when the dust clears—when bankruptcy hits or a family
member bails us out of our stupidity—there’s nothing left over. Nothing
for the kids’ college tuition, no investment to grow our wealth, no
rainy-day fund if someone loses her job. We know we shouldn’t spend like
this. Sometimes we beat ourselves up over it, but we do it anyway.</p>
<p>Our homes are a chaotic mess. We scream and yell at each other like
we’re spectators at a football game. At least one member of the family
uses drugs—sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, sometimes both.
At especially stressful times, we’ll hit and punch each other, all in
front of the rest of the family, including young children; much of the
time, the neighbors hear what’s happening. A bad day is when the
neighbors call the police to stop the drama. Our kids go to foster care
but never stay for long. We apologize to our kids. The kids believe
we’re really sorry, and we are. But then we act just as mean a few days
later.</p>
<p>We don’t study as children, and we don’t make our kids study when
we’re parents. Our kids perform poorly in school. We might get angry
with them, but we never give them the tools—like peace and quiet at
home—to succeed. Even the best and brightest will likely go to college
close to home, if they survive the war zone in their own home. “I don’t
care if you got into Notre Dame,” we say. “You can get a fine, cheap
education at the community college.” The irony is that for poor people
like us, an education at Notre Dame is both cheaper and finer.</p>
<p>We choose not to work when we should be looking for jobs. Sometimes
we’ll get a job, but it won’t last. We’ll get fired for tardiness, or
for stealing merchandise and selling it on eBay, or for having a
customer complain about the smell of alcohol on our breath, or for
taking five thirty-minute restroom breaks per shift. We talk about the
value of hard work but tell ourselves that the reason we’re not working
is some perceived unfairness: Obama shut down the coal mines, or all the
jobs went to the Chinese. These are the lies we tell ourselves to solve
the cognitive dissonance—the broken connection between the world we see
and the values we preach.</p>
<p>We talk to our children about responsibility, but we never walk the
walk. It’s like this: For years I’d dreamed of owning a German shepherd
puppy. Somehow Mom found me one. But he was our fourth dog, and I had no
clue how to train him. Within a few years, all of them had
vanished—given to the police department or to a family friend. After
saying goodbye to the fourth dog, our hearts harden. We learn not to
grow too attached.</p>
<p>Our eating and exercise habits seem designed to send us to an early
grave, and it’s working: In certain parts of Kentucky, local life
expectancy is sixty-seven, a full decade and a half below what it is in
nearby Virginia. A recent study found that unique among all ethnic
groups in the United States, the life expectancy of working-class white
folks is going down. We eat Pillsbury cinnamon rolls for breakfast, Taco
Bell for lunch, and McDonald’s for dinner. We rarely cook, even though
it’s cheaper and better for the body and soul. Exercise is confined to
the games we play as children. We see people jog on the streets only if
we leave our homes for the military or for college in some distant
place.</p>
<p>Not all of the white working class struggles. I knew even as a child
that there were two separate sets of mores and social pressures. My
grandparents embodied one type: old-fashioned, quietly faithful,
self-reliant, hardworking. My mother and, increasingly, the entire
neighborhood embodied another: consumerist, isolated, angry,
distrustful.</p>
<p>There were (and remain) many who lived by my grandparents’ code.
Sometimes you saw it in the subtlest of ways: the old neighbor who
diligently tended her garden even as her neighbors let their homes rot
from the inside out; the young woman who grew up with my mom, who
returned to the neighborhood every day to help her mother navigate old
age. I say this not to romanticize my grandparents’ way of life—which,
as I’ve observed, was rife with problems—but to note that many in our
community may have struggled but did so successfully. There are many
intact families, many dinners shared in peaceful homes, many children
studying hard and believing they’ll claim their own American Dream. Many
of my friends have built successful lives and happy families in
Middletown or nearby. They are not the problem, and if you believe the
statistics, the children of these intact homes have plenty of reason for
optimism.</p>
<p>I always straddled those two worlds. Thanks to Mamaw, I never saw
only the worst of what our community offered, and I believe that saved
me. There was always a safe place and a loving embrace if ever I needed
it. Our neighbors’ kids couldn’t say the same.</p>
<p>One Sunday, Mamaw agreed to watch Aunt Wee’s kids for several hours.
Aunt Wee dropped them off at ten. I had to work the dreaded eleven A.M.
to eight P.M. shift at the grocery store. I hung out with the kids for
about forty-five minutes, then left at ten-forty-five for work. I was
unusually upset—devastated, even—to leave them. I wanted nothing more
than to spend the day with Mamaw and the babies. I told Mamaw that, and
instead of telling me to “quit your damn whining” like I expected, she
told me she wished that I could stay home, too. It was a rare moment of
empathy. “But if you want the sort of work where you can spend the
weekends with your family, you’ve got to go to college and make
something of yourself.” That was the essence of Mamaw’s genius. She
didn’t just preach and cuss and demand. She showed me what was
possible—a peaceful Sunday afternoon with the people I loved—and made
sure I knew how to get there.</p>
<p>Reams of social science attest to the positive effect of a loving and
stable home. I could cite a dozen studies suggesting that Mamaw’s home
offered me not just a short-term haven but also hope for a better life.
Entire volumes are devoted to the phenomenon of “resilient
children”—kids who prosper despite an unstable home because they have
the social support of a loving adult.</p>
<p>I know Mamaw was good for me not because some Harvard psychologist
says so but because I felt it. Consider my life before I moved in with
Mamaw. In the middle of third grade, we left Middletown and my
grandparents to live in Preble County with Bob; at the end of fourth
grade, we left Preble County to live in a Middletown duplex on the 200
block of McKinley Street; at the end of fifth grade, we left the 200
block of McKinley Street to move to the 300 block of McKinley Street,
and by that time Chip was a regular in our home, though he never lived
with us; at the end of sixth grade, we remained on the 300 block of
McKinley Street, but Chip had been replaced by Steve (and there were
many discussions about moving in with Steve); at the end of seventh
grade, Matt had taken Steve’s place, Mom was preparing to move in with
Matt, and Mom hoped that I would join her in Dayton; at the end of
eighth grade, she demanded that I move to Dayton, and after a brief
detour at my dad’s house, I acquiesced; at the end of ninth grade, I
moved in with Ken—a complete stranger—and his three kids. On top of all
that were the drugs, the domestic violence case, children’s services
prying into our lives, and Papaw dying.</p>
<p>Today, even remembering that period long enough to write it down
invokes an intense, indescribable anxiety in me. Not long ago, I noticed
that a Facebook friend (an acquaintance from high school with similarly
deep hillbilly roots) was constantly changing boyfriends—going in and
out of relationships, posting pictures of one guy one week and another
three weeks later, fighting on social media with her new fling until the
relationship publicly imploded. She is my age with four children, and
when she posted that she had finally found a man who would treat her
well (a refrain I’d seen many times before), her thirteen-year-old
daughter commented: “Just stop. I just want you and this to stop.” I
wish I could hug that little girl, because I know how she feels. For
seven long years, I just wanted it to stop. I didn’t care so much about
the fighting, the screaming, or even the drugs. I just wanted a home,
and I wanted to stay there, and I wanted these goddamned strangers to
stay the fuck out.</p>
<p>Now consider the sum of my life after I moved in with Mamaw
permanently. At the end of tenth grade, I lived with Mamaw, in her
house, with no one else. At the end of eleventh grade, I lived with
Mamaw, in her house, with no one else. At the end of twelfth grade, I
lived with Mamaw, in her house, with no one else. I could say that the
peace of Mamaw’s home gave me a safe space to do my homework. I could
say that the absence of fighting and instability let me focus on school
and my job. I could say that spending all of my time in the same house
with the same person made it easier for me to form lasting friendships
with people at school. I could say that having a job and learning a bit
about the world helped clarify precisely what I wanted out of my own
life. In hindsight, those explanations make sense, and I am certain that
a bit of truth lies in each.</p>
<p>I’m sure that a sociologist and a psychologist, sitting in a room
together, could explain why I lost interest in drugs, why my grades
improved, why I aced the SAT, and why I found a couple of teachers who
inspired me to love learning. But what I remember most of all is that I
was happy—I no longer feared the school bell at the end of the day, I
knew where I’d be living the next month, and no one’s romantic decisions
affected my life. And out of that happiness came so many of the
opportunities I’ve had for the past twelve years.</p>
