<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>As I began to think a bit more deeply about my own identity, I fell
hard for a classmate of mine named Usha. As luck would have it, we were
assigned as partners for our first major writing assignment, so we spent
a lot of time during that first year getting to know each other. She
seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive
quality a human being should have: bright, hardworking, tall, and
beautiful. I joked with a buddy that if she had possessed a terrible
personality, she would have made an excellent heroine in an Ayn Rand
novel, but she had a great sense of humor and an extraordinarily direct
way of speaking. Where others might have asked meekly, “Yeah, maybe you
could rephrase this?” or “Have you thought about this other idea?” Usha
would say simply: “I think this sentence needs work” or “This is a
pretty terrible argument.” At a bar, she looked up at a mutual friend of
ours and said, without a hint of irony, “You have a very small head.” I
had never met anyone like her.</p>
<p>I had dated other girls before, some serious, some not. But Usha
occupied an entirely different emotional universe. I thought about her
constantly. One friend described me as “heartsick” and another told me
he had never seen me like this. Toward the end of our first year, I
learned that Usha was single, and I immediately asked her out. After a
few weeks of flirtations and a single date, I told her that I was in
love with her. It violated every rule of modern dating I’d learned as a
young man, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>Usha was like my Yale spirit guide. She’d attended the university for
college, too, and knew all of the best coffee shops and places to eat.
Her knowledge went much deeper, however: She instinctively understood
the questions I didn’t even know to ask, and she always encouraged me to
seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed. “Go to office hours,”
she’d tell me. “Professors here like to engage with students. It’s part
of the experience here.” In a place that always seemed a little foreign,
Usha’s presence made me feel at home.</p>
<p>I went to Yale to earn a law degree. But that first year at Yale
taught me most of all that I didn’t know how the world worked. Every
August, recruiters from prestigious law firms descend on New Haven,
hungry for the next generation of high-quality legal talent. The
students call it FIP—short for Fall Interview Program—and it’s a
marathon week of dinners, cocktail hours, hospitality suite visits, and
interviews. On my first day of FIP, just before second-year classes
began, I had six interviews, including one with the firm I most
coveted—Gibson, Dunn andandandand Crutcher, LLP (Gibson Dunn for
short)—which had an elite practice in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The interview with Gibson Dunn went well and I was invited to their
infamous dinner at one of New Haven’s fanciest restaurants. The rumor
mill informed me that the dinner was a kind of intermediate interview:
We needed to be funny, charming, and engaging, or we’d never be invited
to the D.C. or New York offices for final interviews. When I arrived at
the restaurant, I thought it a pity that the most expensive meal I’d
ever eaten would take place in such a high-stakes environment.</p>
<p>Before dinner, we were all corralled into a private banquet room for
wine and conversation. Women a decade older than I was carried around
wine bottles wrapped in beautiful linens, asking every few minutes
whether I wanted a new glass of wine or a refill on the old one. At
first I was too nervous to drink. But I finally mustered the courage to
answer yes when someone asked whether I’d like some wine and, if so,
what kind. “I’ll take white,” I said, which I thought would settle the
matter. “Would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay?”</p>
<p>I thought she was screwing with me. But I used my powers of deduction
to determine that those were two separate kinds of white wine. So I
ordered a chardonnay, not because I didn’t know what sauvignon blanc was
(though I didn’t) but because it was easier to pronounce. I had just
dodged my first bullet. The night, however, was young.</p>
<p>At these types of events, you have to strike a balance between shy
and overbearing. You don’t want to annoy the partners, but you don’t
want them to leave without shaking your hand. I tried to be myself; I’ve
always considered myself gregarious but not oppressive. But I was so
impressed by the environment that “being myself” meant staring
slack-jawed at the fineries of the restaurant and wondering how much
they cost.</p>
<p>The wineglasses look like they’ve been Windexed. That dude did not
buy his suit at the three-suits-for-one sale at Jos. A. Bank; it looks
like it’s made from silk. The linens on the table look softer than my
bedsheets; I need to touch them without being weird about it. Long story
short, I needed a new plan. By the time we sat down for dinner, I’d
resolved to focus on the task at hand—getting a job—and leave the class
tourism for later.</p>
<p>My bearing lasted another two minutes. After we sat down, the
waitress asked whether I’d like tap or sparkling water. I rolled my eyes
at that one: As impressed as I was with the restaurant, calling the
water “sparkling” was just too pretentious—like “sparkling” crystal or a
“sparkling” diamond. But I ordered the sparkling water anyway. Probably
better for me. Fewer contaminants.</p>
<p>I took one sip and literally spit it out. It was the grossest thing
I’d ever tasted. I remember once getting a Diet Coke at a Subway without
realizing that the fountain machine didn’t have enough Diet Coke syrup.
That’s exactly what this fancy place’s “sparkling” water tasted like.
“Something’s wrong with that water,” I protested. The waitress
apologized and told me she’d get me another Pellegrino. That was when I
realized that “sparkling” water meant “carbonated” water. I was
mortified, but luckily only one other person noticed what had happened,
and she was a classmate. I was in the clear. No more mistakes.</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter, I looked down at the place setting and
observed an absurd number of instruments. Nine utensils? Why, I
wondered, did I need three spoons? Why were there multiple butter
knives? Then I recalled a scene from a movie and realized there was some
social convention surrounding the placement and size of the cutlery. I
excused myself to the restroom and called my spirit guide: “What do I do
with all these damned forks? I don’t want to make a fool of myself.”
Armed with Usha’s reply—“Go from outside to inside, and don’t use the
same utensil for separate dishes; oh, and use the fat spoon for soup”—I
returned to dinner, ready to dazzle my future employers.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was uneventful. I chatted politely and
remembered Lindsay’s admonition to chew with my mouth closed. Those at
our table talked about law and law school, firm culture, and even a
little politics. The recruiters we ate with were very nice, and everyone
at my table landed a job offer—even the guy who spit out his sparkling
water.</p>
<p>It was at this meal, on the first of five grueling days of
interviews, that I began to understand that I was seeing the inner
workings of a system that lay hidden to most of my kind. Our career
office had emphasized the importance of sounding natural and being
someone the interviewers wouldn’t mind sitting with on an airplane. It
made perfect sense—after all, who wants to work with an asshole?—but it
seemed an odd emphasis for what felt like the most important moment of a
young career. Our interviews weren’t so much about grades or résumés, we
were told; thanks to a Yale Law pedigree, one foot was already in the
door. The interviews were about passing a social test—a test of
belonging, of holding your own in a corporate boardroom, of making
connections with potential future clients.</p>
<p>The most difficult test was the one I wasn’t even required to take:
getting an audience in the first place. All week I marveled at the ease
of access to the most esteemed lawyers in the country. All of my friends
had at least a dozen interviews, and most led to job offers. I had
sixteen when the week began, though by the end I was so spoiled (and
exhausted) by the process that I turned down a couple of interviews. Two
years earlier, I had applied to dozens of places in the hope of landing
a well-paying job after college but was rebuffed every time. Now, after
only a year at Yale Law, my classmates and I were being handed
six-figure salaries by men who had argued before the United States
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>It was pretty clear that there was some mysterious force at work, and
I had just tapped into it for the first time. I had always thought that
when you need a job, you look online for job postings. And then you
submit a dozen résumés. And then you hope that someone calls you back.
If you’re lucky, maybe a friend puts your résumé at the top of the pile.
If you’re qualified for a very high-demand profession, like accounting,
maybe the job search comes a bit easier. But the rules are basically the
same.</p>
<p>The problem is, virtually everyone who plays by those rules fails.
That week of interviews showed me that successful people are playing an
entirely different game. They don’t flood the job market with résumés,
hoping that some employer will grace them with an interview. They
network. They email a friend of a friend to make sure their name gets
the look it deserves. They have their uncles call old college buddies.
They have their school’s career service office set up interviews months
in advance on their behalf. They have parents tell them how to dress,
what to say, and whom to schmooze.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the strength of your résumé or interview
performance is irrelevant. Those things certainly matter. But there is
enormous value in what economists call social capital. It’s a
professor’s term, but the concept is pretty simple: The networks of
people and institutions around us have real economic value. They connect
us to the right people, ensure that we have opportunities, and impart
valuable information. Without them, we’re going it alone.</p>
<p>I learned this the hard way during one of my final interviews of the
marathon FIP week. At that point, the interviews were like a broken
record. People asked about my interests, my favorite classes, my
expected legal specialty. Then they asked if I had any questions. After
a dozen tries, my answers were polished, and my questions made me sound
like a seasoned consumer of law firm information. The truth was that I
had no idea what I wanted to do and no idea what field of law I expected
to practice in. I wasn’t even sure what my questions about “firm
culture” and “work-life balance” meant. The whole process was little
more than a dog and pony show. But I didn’t seem like an asshole, so I
was coasting.</p>
<p>Then I hit a wall. The last interviewer asked me a question I was
unprepared to answer: Why did I want to work for a law firm? It was a
softball, but I’d gotten so used to talking about my budding interest in
antitrust litigation (an interest that was at least a little fabricated)
that I was laughably unprepared. I should have said something about
learning from the best or working on high-stakes litigation. I should
have said anything other than what came from my mouth: “I don’t really
know, but the pay isn’t bad! Ha ha!” The interviewer looked at me like I
had three eyes, and the conversation never recovered.</p>
<p>I was certain I was toast. I had flubbed the interview in the worst
way. But behind the scenes, one of my recommenders was already working
the phones. She told the hiring partner that I was a smart, good kid and
would make an excellent lawyer. “She raved about you,” I later heard. So
when the recruiters called to schedule the next round of interviews, I
made the cut. I eventually got the job, despite failing miserably at
what I perceived was the most important part of the recruiting process.
The old adage says that it’s better to be lucky than good. Apparently
having the right network is better than both.</p>
<p>At Yale, networking power is like the air we breathe—so pervasive
that it’s easy to miss. Toward the end of our first year, most of us
were studying for The Yale Law Journal writing competition. The Journal
publishes lengthy pieces of legal analysis, mostly for an academic
audience. The articles read like radiator manuals—dry, formulaic, and
partially written in another language. (A sampling: “Despite grading’s
great promise, we show that the regulatory design, implementation, and
practice suffer from serious flaws: jurisdictions fudge more than
nudge.”) Kidding aside, Journal membership is serious business. It is
the single most significant extracurricular activity for legal
employers, some of whom hire only from the publication’s editorial
board.</p>
<p>Some kids came to the law school with a plan for admission to The
Yale Law Journal. The writing competition kicked off in April. By March,
some people were weeks into preparation. On the advice of recent
graduates (who were also close friends), a good friend had begun
studying before Christmas. The alumni of elite consulting firms gathered
together to grill each other on editorial techniques. One second-year
student helped his old Harvard roommate (a first-year student) design a
study strategy for the final month before the test. At every turn,
people were tapping into friendship circles and alumni groups to learn
about the most important test of our first year.</p>
<p>I had no idea what was going on. There was no Ohio State alumni
group—when I arrived, I was one of two Ohio State graduates at the
entire law school. I suspected the Journal was important, because
Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor had been a member. But I didn’t
know why. I didn’t even know what the Journal did. The entire process
was a black box, and no one I knew had the key.</p>
<p>There were official channels of information. But they telegraphed
conflicting messages. Yale prides itself on being a low-stress,
noncompetitive law school. Unfortunately, that ethos sometimes manifests
itself in confused messaging. No one seemed to know what value the
credential actually held. We were told that the Journal was a huge
career boost but that it wasn’t that important, that we shouldn’t stress
about it but that it was a prerequisite for certain types of jobs. This
was undoubtedly true: For many career paths and interests, Journal
membership was merely wasted time. But I didn’t know which career paths
that applied to. And I was unsure how to find out.</p>
<p>It was around this time that Amy Chua, one of my professors, stepped
in and told me exactly how things worked: “Journal membership is useful
if you want to work for a judge or if you want to be an academic.
Otherwise, it’s a waste. But if you’re unsure what you want to do, go
ahead and try out.” It was million-dollar advice. Because I was unsure
what I wanted, I followed it. Though I didn’t make it during my first
year, I made the cut during my second year and became an editor of the
prestigious publication. Whether I made it isn’t the point. What
mattered was that, with a professor’s help, I had closed the information
gap. It was like I’d learned to see.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the last time Amy helped me navigate unfamiliar terrain.
Law school is a three-year obstacle course of life and career decisions.
One the one hand, it’s nice to have so many opportunities. On the other
hand, I had no idea what to do with those opportunities or any clue
which opportunities served some long-term goal. Hell, I didn’t even have
a long-term goal. I just wanted to graduate and get a good job. I had
some vague notion that I’d like to do public service after I repaid my
law school debt. But I didn’t have a job in mind.</p>
<p>Life didn’t wait. Almost immediately after I committed to a law firm,
people started talking about clerkship applications for after
graduation. Judicial clerkships are one-year stints with federal judges.
It’s a fantastic learning experience for young lawyers: Clerks read
court filings, research legal issues for a judge, and even help the
judge draft opinions. Every former clerk raves about the experience, and
private-sector employers often shell out tens of thousands in signing
bonuses for recent clerks.</p>
<p>That’s what I knew about clerkships, and it was completely true. It
was also very superficial: The clerkship process is infinitely more
complex. First you have to decide what kind of court you want to work
for: a court that does a lot of trials or a court that hears appeals
from lower courts. Then you have to decide which regions of the country
to apply to. If you want to clerk for the Supreme Court, certain
“feeder” judges give you a greater chance of doing so. Predictably,
those judges hire more competitively, so holding out for a feeder judge
carries certain risks—if you win the game, you’re halfway to the
chambers of the nation’s highest court; if you lose, you’re stuck
without a clerkship. Sprinkled on top of these factors is the reality
that you work closely with these judges. And no one wants to waste a
year getting berated by an asshole in black robes.</p>
<p>There’s no database that spits out this information, no central
source that tells you which judges are nice, which judges send people to
the Supreme Court, and which type of work—trial or appellate—you want to
do. In fact, it’s considered almost unseemly to talk about these things.
How do you ask a professor if the judge he’s recommending you to is a
nice lady? It’s trickier than it might seem.</p>
<p>So to get this information, you have to tap into your social
network—student groups, friends who have clerked, and the few professors
who are willing to give brutally honest advice. By this point in my law
school experience, I had learned that the only way to take advantage of
networking was to ask. So I did. Amy Chua told me that I shouldn’t worry
about clerking for a prestigious feeder judge because the credential
wouldn’t prove very useful, given my ambitions. But I pushed until she
relented and agreed to recommend me to a high-powered federal judge with
deep connections to multiple Supreme Court justices.</p>
<p>I submitted all the materials—a résumé, a polished writing sample,
and a desperate letter of interest. I didn’t know why I was doing it.
Maybe, with my Southern drawl and lack of a family pedigree, I felt like
I needed proof that I belonged at Yale Law. Or maybe I was just
following the herd. Regardless of the reason, I needed to have this
credential.</p>
<p>A few days after I submitted my materials, Amy called me into her
office to let me know that I had made the short list. My heart
fluttered. I knew that all I needed was an interview and I’d get the
job. And I knew that if she pushed my application hard enough, I’d get
the interview.</p>
<p>That was when I learned the value of real social capital. I don’t
mean to suggest that my professor picked up the phone and told the judge
he had to give me an interview. Before she did that, my professor told
me that she wanted to talk to me very seriously. She turned downright
somber: “I don’t think you’re doing this for the right reasons. I think
you’re doing this for the credential, which is fine, but the credential
doesn’t actually serve your career goals. If you don’t want to be a
high-powered Supreme Court litigator, you shouldn’t care that much about
this job.”</p>
<p>She then told me how hard a clerkship with this judge would be. He
was demanding to the extreme. His clerks didn’t take a single day off
for an entire year. Then she got personal. She knew I had a new
girlfriend and that I was crazy about her. “This clerkship is the type
of thing that destroys relationships. If you want my advice, I think you
should prioritize Usha and figure out a career move that actually suits
you.”</p>
<p>It was the best advice anyone has ever given me, and I took it. I
told her to withdraw my application. It’s impossible to say whether I
would have gotten the job. I was probably being overconfident: My grades
and résumé were fine but not fantastic. However, Amy’s advice stopped me
from making a life-altering decision. It prevented me from moving a
thousand miles away from the person I eventually married. Most
important, it allowed me to accept my place at this unfamiliar
institution—it was okay to chart my own path and okay to put a girl
above some shortsighted ambition. My professor gave me permission to be
me.</p>
<p>It’s hard to put a dollar value on that advice. It’s the kind of
thing that continues to pay dividends. But make no mistake: The advice
had tangible economic value. Social capital isn’t manifest only in
someone connecting you to a friend or passing a résumé on to an old
boss. It is also, or perhaps primarily, a measure of how much we learn
through our friends, colleagues, and mentors. I didn’t know how to
prioritize my options, and I didn’t know that there were other, better
paths for me. I learned those things through my network—specifically, a
very generous professor.</p>
<p>My education in social capital continues. For a time, I contributed
to the website of David Frum, the journalist and opinion leader who now
writes for The Atlantic. When I was ready to commit to one D.C. law
firm, he suggested another firm where two of his friends from the Bush
administration had recently taken senior partnerships. One of those
friends interviewed me and, when I joined his firm, became an important
mentor. I later ran into this man at a Yale conference, where he
introduced me to his old buddy from the Bush White House (and my
political hero), Indiana governor Mitch Daniels. Without David’s advice,
I never would have found myself at that firm, nor would I have spoken
(albeit briefly) to the public figure I most admired.</p>
<p>I did decide that I wanted to clerk. But instead of walking into the
process blindly, I came to know what I wanted out of the experience—to
work for someone I respected, to learn as much as I could, and to be
close to Usha. So Usha and I decided to go through the clerkship process
together. We landed in northern Kentucky, not far from where I grew up.
It was the best possible situation. We liked our judicial bosses so much
that we asked them to officiate our wedding.</p>
<p>This is just one version of how the world of successful people
actually works. But social capital is all around us. Those who tap into
it and use it prosper. Those who don’t are running life’s race with a
major handicap. This is a serious problem for kids like me. Here’s a
non-exhaustive list of things I didn’t know when I got to Yale Law
School:</p>
<p>That you needed to wear a suit to a job interview.</p>
<p>That wearing a suit large enough to fit a silverback gorilla was
inappropriate.</p>
<p>That a butter knife wasn’t just decorative (after all, anything that
requires a butter knife can be done better with a spoon or an index
finger).</p>
<p>That pleather and leather were different substances.</p>
<p>That your shoes and belt should match.</p>
<p>That certain cities and states had better job prospects.</p>
<p>That going to a nicer college brought benefits outside of bragging
rights.</p>
<p>That finance was an industry that people worked in.</p>
<p>Mamaw always resented the hillbilly stereotype—the idea that our
people were a bunch of slobbering morons. But the fact is that I was
remarkably ignorant of how to get ahead. Not knowing things that many
others do often has serious economic consequences. It cost me a job in
college (apparently Marine Corps combat boots and khaki pants aren’t
proper interview attire) and could have cost me a lot more in law school
if I hadn’t had a few people helping me every step of the way.</p>
