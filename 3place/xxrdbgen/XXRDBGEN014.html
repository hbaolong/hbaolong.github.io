<h4 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h4>
<p>During my first round of law school applications, I didn’t even apply
to Yale, Harvard, or Stanford—the mythical “top three” schools. I didn’t
think I had a chance at those places. More important, I didn’t think it
mattered; all lawyers get good jobs, I assumed. I just needed to get to
any law school, and then I’d do fine: a nice salary, a respectable
profession, and the American Dream. Then my best friend, Darrell, ran
into one of his law school classmates at a popular D.C. restaurant. She
was bussing tables, simply because that was the only job available to
her. On the next round, I gave Yale and Harvard a try.</p>
<p>I didn’t apply to Stanford—one of the very best schools in the
country—and to know why is to understand that the lessons I learned as a
kid were sometimes counterproductive. Stanford’s law school application
wasn’t the standard combination of college transcript, LSAT score, and
essays. It required a personal sign-off from the dean of your college:
You had to submit a form, completed by the dean, attesting that you
weren’t a loser.</p>
<p>I didn’t know the dean of my college at Ohio State. It’s a big place.
I’m sure she is a lovely person, and the form was clearly little more
than a formality. But I just couldn’t ask. I had never met this person,
never taken a class with her, and, most of all, didn’t trust her.
Whatever virtues she possessed as a person, she was, in the abstract, an
outsider. The professors I’d selected to write my letters had gained my
trust. I listened to them nearly every day, took their tests, and wrote
papers for them. As much as I loved Ohio State and its people for an
incredible education and experience, I could not put my fate in the
hands of someone I didn’t know. I tried to talk myself into it. I even
printed the form and drove it to campus. But when the time came, I
crumpled it up and tossed it in the garbage. There would be no Stanford
Law for J.D.</p>
<p>I decided that I wanted to go to Yale more than any other school. It
had a certain aura—with its small class sizes and unique grading system,
Yale billed itself as a low-stress way to jump-start a legal career. But
most of its students came from elite private colleges, not large state
schools like mine, so I imagined that I had no chance of admission.
Nonetheless, I submitted an application online, because that was
relatively easy. It was late afternoon on an early spring day, 2010,
when my phone rang and the caller ID revealed an unfamiliar 203 area
code. I answered, and the voice on the other line told me that he was
the director of admissions at Yale Law, and that I’d been admitted to
the class of 2013. I was ecstatic and leaped around during the entire
three-minute conversation. By the time he said goodbye, I was so out of
breath that when I called Aunt Wee to tell her, she thought I’d just
gotten into a car accident.</p>
<p>I was sufficiently committed to going to Yale Law that I was willing
to accept the two hundred thousand dollars or so in debt that I knew I’d
accrue. Yet the financial aid package Yale offered exceeded my wildest
dreams. In my first year, it was nearly a full ride. That wasn’t because
of anything I’d done or earned—it was because I was one of the poorest
kids in school. Yale offered tens of thousands in need-based aid. It was
the first time being so broke paid so well. Yale wasn’t just my dream
school, it was also the cheapest option on the table.</p>
<p>The New York Times recently reported that the most expensive schools
are paradoxically cheaper for low-income students. Take, for example, a
student whose parents earn thirty thousand per year—not a lot of money
but not poverty level, either. That student would pay ten thousand for
one of the less selective branch campuses of the University of Wisconsin
but would pay six thousand at the school’s flagship Madison campus. At
Harvard, the student would pay only about thirteen hundred despite
tuition of over forty thousand. Of course, kids like me don’t know this.
My buddy Nate, a lifelong friend and one of the smartest people I know,
wanted to go to the University of Chicago as an undergraduate, but he
didn’t apply because he knew he couldn’t afford it. It likely would have
cost him considerably less than Ohio State, just as Yale cost
considerably less for me than any other school.</p>
<p>I spent the next few months getting ready to leave. My aunt and
uncle’s friend got me that job at a local floor tile distribution
warehouse, and I worked there during the summer—driving a forklift,
getting tile shipments ready for transport, and sweeping a giant
warehouse. By the end of the summer, I’d saved enough not to worry about
the move to New Haven.</p>
<p>The day I moved felt different from every other time I’d moved away
from Middletown. I knew when I left for the Marines that I’d return
often and that life might bring me back to my hometown for an extended
period (indeed it did). After four years in the Marines, the move to
Columbus for college hadn’t seemed all that significant. I’d become an
expert at leaving Middletown for other places, and each time I felt at
least a little forlorn. But I knew this time that I was never really
coming back. That didn’t bother me. Middletown no longer felt like
home.</p>
<p>On my first day at Yale Law School, there were posters in the
hallways announcing an event with Tony Blair, the former British prime
minister. I couldn’t believe it: Tony Blair was speaking to a room of a
few dozen students? If he came to Ohio State, he would have filled an
auditorium of a thousand people. “Yeah, he speaks at Yale all the time,”
a friend told me. “His son is an undergraduate.” A few days after that,
I nearly bumped into a man as I turned a corner to walk into the law
school’s main entrance. I said, “Excuse me,” looked up, and realized the
man was New York governor George Pataki. These sorts of things happened
at least once a week. Yale Law School was like nerd Hollywood, and I
never stopped feeling like an awestruck tourist.</p>
<p>The first semester was structured in a way to make life easy on
students. While my friends in other law schools were overwhelmed with
work and worrying about strict grading curves that effectively placed
you in direct competition with your classmates, our dean asked us during
orientation to follow our passions, wherever they might lead, and not
worry so much about grades. Our first four classes were graded on a
credit/no credit basis, which made that easy. One of those classes, a
constitutional law seminar of sixteen students, became a kind of family
for me. We called ourselves the island of misfit toys, as there was no
real unifying force to our team—a conservative hillbilly from
Appalachia, the supersmart daughter of Indian immigrants, a black
Canadian with decades’ worth of street smarts, a neuroscientist from
Phoenix, an aspiring civil rights attorney born a few minutes from
Yale’s campus, and an extremely progressive lesbian with a fantastic
sense of humor, among others—but we became excellent friends.</p>
<p>That first year at Yale was overwhelming, but in a good way. I’d
always been an American history buff, and some of the buildings on
campus predated the Revolutionary War. Sometimes I’d walk around campus
searching for the placards that identified the ages of buildings. The
buildings themselves were breathtakingly beautiful—towering masterpieces
of neo-Gothic architecture. Inside, intricate stone carvings and wood
trim gave the law school an almost medieval feel. You’d even sometimes
hear that we went to HLS (Hogwarts Law School). It’s telling that the
best way to describe the law school was a reference to a series of
fantasy novels.</p>
<p>Classes were hard, and sometimes required long nights in the library,
but they weren’t that hard. A part of me had thought I’d finally be
revealed as an intellectual fraud, that the administration would realize
they’d made a terrible mistake and send me back to Middletown with their
sincerest apologies. Another part of me thought I’d be able to hack it
but only with extraordinary dedication; after all, these were the
brightest students in the world, and I did not qualify as such. But that
didn’t end up being the case. Though there were rare geniuses walking
the halls of the law school, most of my fellow students were smart but
not intimidatingly so. In classroom discussions and on tests, I largely
held my own.</p>
<p>Not everything came easy. I always fancied myself a decent writer,
but when I turned in a sloppy writing assignment to a famously stern
professor, he handed it back with some extraordinarily critical
commentary. “Not good at all,” he scribbled on one page. On another, he
circled a large paragraph and wrote in the margin, “This is a vomit of
sentences masquerading as a paragraph. Fix.” I heard through the
grapevine that this professor thought Yale should accept only students
from places like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton: “It’s not our
job to do remedial education, and too many of these other kids need it.”
That committed me to changing his mind. By the end of the semester, he
called my writing “excellent” and admitted that he might have been wrong
about state schools. As the first year drew to a close, I felt
triumphant—my professors and I got along well, I had earned solid
grades, and I had a dream job for the summer—working for the chief
counsel for a sitting U.S. senator.</p>
<p>Yet, for all of the joy and intrigue, Yale planted a seed of doubt in
my mind about whether I belonged. This place was so beyond the pale for
what I expected of myself. I knew zero Ivy League graduates back home; I
was the first person in my nuclear family to go to college and the first
person in my extended family to attend a professional school. When I
arrived in August 2010, Yale had educated two of the three most recent
Supreme Court justices and two of the six most recent presidents, not to
mention the sitting secretary of state (Hillary Clinton). There was
something bizarre about Yale’s social rituals: the cocktail receptions
and banquets that served as both professional networking and personal
matchmaking events. I lived among newly christened members of what folks
back home pejoratively call the “elites,” and by every outward
appearance, I was one of them: I am a tall, white, straight male. I have
never felt out of place in my entire life. But I did at Yale.</p>
<p>Part of it has to do with social class. A student survey found that
over 95 percent of Yale Law’s students qualified as upper-middle-class
or higher, and most of them qualified as outright wealthy. Obviously, I
was neither upper-middle-class nor wealthy. Very few people at Yale Law
School are like me. They may look like me, but for all of the Ivy
League’s obsession with diversity, virtually everyone—black, white,
Jewish, Muslim, whatever—comes from intact families who never worry
about money. Early during my first year, after a late night of drinking
with my classmates, we all decided to stop at a New Haven chicken joint.
Our large group left an awful mess: dirty plates, chicken bones, ranch
dressing and soda splattered on the tables, and so on. I couldn’t
imagine leaving it all for some poor guy to clean up, so I stayed
behind. Of a dozen classmates, only one person helped me: my buddy
Jamil, who also came from a poorer background. Afterward, I told Jamil
that we were probably the only people in the school who’d ever had to
clean up someone else’s mess. He just nodded his head in silent
agreement.</p>
<p>Even though my experiences were unique, I never felt like a foreigner
in Middletown. Most people’s parents had never gone to college. My
closest friends had all seen some kind of domestic strife in their
life—divorces, remarriages, legal separations, or fathers who spent some
time in jail. A few parents worked as lawyers, engineers, or teachers.
They were “rich people” to Mamaw, but they were never so rich that I
thought of them as fundamentally different. They still lived within
walking distance of my house, sent their kids to the same high school,
and generally did the same things the rest of us did. It never occurred
to me that I didn’t belong, even in the homes of some of my relatively
wealthy friends.</p>
<p>At Yale Law School, I felt like my spaceship had crashed in Oz.
People would say with a straight face that a surgeon mother and engineer
father were middle-class. In Middletown, 60,000 is an unfathomable
salary; at Yale Law School, students expect to earn that amount in the
first year after law school. Many of them are already worried that it
won’t be enough.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just about the money or my relative lack of it. It was
about people’s perceptions. Yale made me feel, for the first time in my
life, that others viewed my life with intrigue. Professors and
classmates seemed genuinely interested in what seemed to me a
superficially boring story: I went to a mediocre public high school, my
parents didn’t go to college, and I grew up in Ohio. The same was true
of nearly everyone I knew. At Yale, these things were true of no one.
Even my service in the Marine Corps was pretty common in Ohio, but at
Yale, many of my friends had never spent time with a veteran of
America’s newest wars. In other words, I was an anomaly.</p>
<p>That’s not exactly a bad thing. For much of that first year in law
school, I reveled in the fact that I was the only big marine with a
Southern twang at my elite law school. But as law school acquaintances
became close friends, I became less comfortable with the lies I told
about my own past. “My mom is a nurse,” I told them. But of course that
wasn’t true anymore. I didn’t really know what my legal father—the one
whose name was on my birth certificate—did for a living; he was a total
stranger. No one, except my best friends from Middletown whom I asked to
read my law school admissions essay, knew about the formative
experiences that shaped my life. At Yale, I decided to change that.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what motivated this change. Part of it is that I stopped
being ashamed: My parents’ mistakes were not my fault, so I had no
reason to hide them. But I was concerned most of all that no one
understood my grandparents’ outsize role in my life. Few of even my
closest friends understood how utterly hopeless my life would have been
without Mamaw and Papaw. So maybe I just wanted to give credit where
credit is due.</p>
<p>Yet there’s something else. As I realized how different I was from my
classmates at Yale, I grew to appreciate how similar I was to the people
back home. Most important, I became acutely aware of the inner conflict
born of my recent success. On one of my first visits home after classes
began, I stopped at a gas station not far from Aunt Wee’s house. The
woman at the nearest pump began a conversation, and I noticed that she
wore a Yale T-shirt. “Did you go to Yale?” I asked. “No,” she replied,
“but my nephew does. Do you?” I wasn’t sure what to say. It was
stupid—her nephew went to school there, for Christ’s sake—but I was
still uncomfortable admitting that I’d become an Ivy Leaguer. The moment
she told me her nephew went to Yale, I had to choose: Was I a Yale Law
student, or was I a Middletown kid with hillbilly grandparents? If the
former, I could exchange pleasantries and talk about New Haven’s beauty;
if the latter, she occupied the other side of an invisible divide and
could not to be trusted. At her cocktail parties and fancy dinners, she
and her nephew probably even laughed about the unsophisticates of Ohio
and how they clung to their guns and religion. I would not join forces
with her. My answer was a pathetic attempt at cultural defiance: “No, I
don’t go to Yale. But my girlfriend does.” And then I got in my car and
drove away.</p>
<p>This wasn’t one of my prouder moments, but it highlights the inner
conflict inspired by rapid upward mobility: I had lied to a stranger to
avoid feeling like a traitor. There are lessons to draw here, among them
what I’ve noted already: that one consequence of isolation is seeing
standard metrics of success as not just unattainable but as the property
of people not like us. Mamaw always fought that attitude in me, and for
the most part, she was successful.</p>
<p>Another lesson is that it’s not just our own communities that
reinforce the outsider attitude, it’s the places and people that upward
mobility connects us with—like my professor who suggested that Yale Law
School shouldn’t accept applicants from non-prestigious state schools.
There’s no way to quantify how these attitudes affect the working class.
We do know that working-class Americans aren’t just less likely to climb
the economic ladder, they’re also more likely to fall off even after
they’ve reached the top. I imagine that the discomfort they feel at
leaving behind much of their identity plays at least a small role in
this problem. One way our upper class can promote upward mobility, then,
is not only by pushing wise public policies but by opening their hearts
and minds to the newcomers who don’t quite belong.</p>
<p>Though we sing the praises of social mobility, it has its downsides.
The term necessarily implies a sort of movement—to a theoretically
better life, yes, but also away from something. And you can’t always
control the parts of your old life from which you drift. In the past few
years, I’ve vacationed in Panama and England. I’ve bought my groceries
at Whole Foods. I’ve watched orchestral concerts. I’ve tried to break my
addiction to “refined processed sugars” (a term that includes at least
one too many words). I’ve worried about racial prejudice in my own
family and friends.</p>
<p>None of these things is bad on its own. In fact, most of them are
good—visiting England was a childhood dream; eating less sugar improves
health. At the same time, they’ve shown me that social mobility isn’t
just about money and economics, it’s about a lifestyle change. The
wealthy and the powerful aren’t just wealthy and powerful; they follow a
different set of norms and mores. When you go from working-class to
professional-class, almost everything about your old life becomes
unfashionable at best or unhealthy at worst. At no time was this more
obvious than the first (and last) time I took a Yale friend to Cracker
Barrel. In my youth, it was the height of fine dining—my grandma’s and
my favorite restaurant. With Yale friends, it was a greasy public health
crisis.</p>
<p>These aren’t exactly major problems, and if given the option all over
again, I’d trade a bit of social discomfort for the life I lead in a
heartbeat. But as I realized that in this new world I was the cultural
alien, I began to think seriously about questions that had nagged at me
since I was a teenager: Why has no one else from my high school made it
to the Ivy League? Why are people like me so poorly represented in
America’s elite institutions? Why is domestic strife so common in
families like mine? Why did I think that places like Yale and Harvard
were so unreachable? Why did successful people feel so different?</p>
