<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>My name is J.D. Vance, and I think I should start with a confession:
I find the existence of the book you hold in your hands somewhat absurd.
It says right there on the cover that it’s a memoir, but I’m thirty-one
years old, and I’ll be the first to admit that I’ve accomplished nothing
great in my life, certainly nothing that would justify a complete
stranger paying money to read about it. The coolest thing I’ve done, at
least on paper, is graduate from Yale Law School, something
thirteen-year-old J.D. Vance would have considered ludicrous. But about
two hundred people do the same thing every year, and trust me, you don’t
want to read about most of their lives. I am not a senator, a governor,
or a former cabinet secretary. I haven’t started a billion-dollar
company or a world-changing nonprofit. I have a nice job, a happy
marriage, a comfortable home, and two lively dogs.</p>
<p>So I didn’t write this book because I’ve accomplished something
extraordinary. I wrote this book because I’ve achieved something quite
ordinary, which doesn’t happen to most kids who grow up like me. You
see, I grew up poor, in the Rust Belt, in an Ohio steel town that has
been hemorrhaging jobs and hope for as long as I can remember. I have,
to put it mildly, a complex relationship with my parents, one of whom
has struggled with addiction for nearly my entire life. My grandparents,
neither of whom graduated from high school, raised me, and few members
of even my extended family attended college. The statistics tell you
that kids like me face a grim future—that if they’re lucky, they’ll
manage to avoid welfare; and if they’re unlucky, they’ll die of a heroin
overdose, as happened to dozens in my small hometown just last year.</p>
<p>I was one of those kids with a grim future. I almost failed out of
high school. I nearly gave in to the deep anger and resentment harbored
by everyone around me. Today people look at me, at my job and my Ivy
League credentials, and assume that I’m some sort of genius, that only a
truly extraordinary person could have made it to where I am today. With
all due respect to those people, I think that theory is a load of
bullshit. Whatever talents I have, I almost squandered until a handful
of loving people rescued me.</p>
<p>That is the real story of my life, and that is why I wrote this book.
I want people to know what it feels like to nearly give up on yourself
and why you might do it. I want people to understand what happens in the
lives of the poor and the psychological impact that spiritual and
material poverty has on their children. I want people to understand the
American Dream as my family and I encountered it. I want people to
understand how upward mobility really feels. And I want people to
understand something I learned only recently: that for those of us lucky
enough to live the American Dream, the demons of the life we left behind
continue to chase us.</p>

<p>There is an ethnic component lurking in the background of my story.
In our race-conscious society, our vocabulary often extends no further
than the color of someone’s skin—“black people,” “Asians,” “white
privilege.” Sometimes these broad categories are useful, but to
understand my story, you have to delve into the details. I may be white,
but I do not identify with the WASPs of the Northeast. Instead, I
identify with the millions of working-class white Americans of
Scots-Irish descent who have no college degree. To these folks, poverty
is the family tradition—their ancestors were day laborers in the
Southern slave economy, sharecroppers after that, coal miners after
that, and machinists and millworkers during more recent times. Americans
call them hillbillies, rednecks, or white trash. I call them neighbors,
friends, and family.</p>
<p>The Scots-Irish are one of the most distinctive subgroups in America.
As one observer noted, “In traveling across America, the Scots-Irish
have consistently blown my mind as far and away the most persistent and
unchanging regional subculture in the country. Their family structures,
religion and politics, and social lives all remain unchanged compared to
the wholesale abandonment of tradition that’s occurred nearly everywhere
else.”1 This distinctive embrace of cultural tradition comes along with
many good traits—an intense sense of loyalty, a fierce dedication to
family and country—but also many bad ones. We do not like outsiders or
people who are different from us, whether the difference lies in how
they look, how they act, or, most important, how they talk. To
understand me, you must understand that I am a Scots-Irish hillbilly at
heart.</p>
<p>If ethnicity is one side of the coin, then geography is the other.
When the first wave of Scots-Irish immigrants landed in the New World in
the eighteenth century, they were deeply attracted to the Appalachian
Mountains. This region is admittedly huge—stretching from Alabama to
Georgia in the South to Ohio to parts of New York in the North—but the
culture of Greater Appalachia is remarkably cohesive. My family, from
the hills of eastern Kentucky, describe themselves as hillbillies, but
Hank Williams, Jr.—born in Louisiana and an Alabama resident—also
identified himself as one in his rural white anthem “A Country Boy Can
Survive.” It was Greater Appalachia’s political reorientation from
Democrat to Republican that redefined American politics after Nixon. And
it is in Greater Appalachia where the fortunes of working-class whites
seem dimmest. From low social mobility to poverty to divorce and drug
addiction, my home is a hub of misery.</p>
<p>It is unsurprising, then, that we’re a pessimistic bunch. What is
more surprising is that, as surveys have found, working-class whites are
the most pessimistic group in America. More pessimistic than Latino
immigrants, many of whom suffer unthinkable poverty. More pessimistic
than black Americans, whose material prospects continue to lag behind
those of whites. While reality permits some degree of cynicism, the fact
that hillbillies like me are more down about the future than many other
groups—some of whom are clearly more destitute than we are—suggests that
something else is going on.</p>
<p>Indeed it is. We’re more socially isolated than ever, and we pass
that isolation down to our children. Our religion has changed—built
around churches heavy on emotional rhetoric but light on the kind of
social support necessary to enable poor kids to do well. Many of us have
dropped out of the labor force or have chosen not to relocate for better
opportunities. Our men suffer from a peculiar crisis of masculinity in
which some of the very traits that our culture inculcates make it
difficult to succeed in a changing world.</p>
<p>When I mention the plight of my community, I am often met with an
explanation that goes something like this: “Of course the prospects for
working-class whites have worsened, J.D., but you’re putting the chicken
before the egg. They’re divorcing more, marrying less, and experiencing
less happiness because their economic opportunities have declined. If
they only had better access to jobs, other parts of their lives would
improve as well.”</p>
<p>I once held this opinion myself, and I very desperately wanted to
believe it during my youth. It makes sense. Not having a job is
stressful, and not having enough money to live on is even more so. As
the manufacturing center of the industrial Midwest has hollowed out, the
white working class has lost both its economic security and the stable
home and family life that comes with it.</p>
<p>But experience can be a difficult teacher, and it taught me that this
story of economic insecurity is, at best, incomplete. A few years ago,
during the summer before I enrolled at Yale Law School, I was looking
for full-time work in order to finance my move to New Haven,
Connecticut. A family friend suggested that I work for him in a
medium-sized floor tile distribution business near my hometown. Floor
tile is extraordinarily heavy: Each piece weighs anywhere from three to
six pounds, and it’s usually packaged in cartons of eight to twelve
pieces. My primary duty was to lift the floor tile onto a shipping
pallet and prepare that pallet for departure. It wasn’t easy, but it
paid thirteen dollars an hour and I needed the money, so I took the job
and collected as many overtime shifts and extra hours as I could.</p>
<p>The tile business employed about a dozen people, and most employees
had worked there for many years. One guy worked two full-time jobs, but
not because he had to: His second job at the tile business allowed him
to pursue his dream of piloting an airplane. Thirteen dollars an hour
was good money for a single guy in our hometown—a decent apartment costs
about five hundred dollars a month—and the tile business offered steady
raises. Every employee who worked there for a few years earned at least
sixteen dollars an hour in a down economy, which provided an annual
income of thirty-two thousand—well above the poverty line even for a
family. Despite this relatively stable situation, the managers found it
impossible to fill my warehouse position with a long-term employee. By
the time I left, three guys worked in the warehouse; at twenty-six, I
was by far the oldest.</p>
<p>One guy, I’ll call him Bob, joined the tile warehouse just a few
months before I did. Bob was nineteen with a pregnant girlfriend. The
manager kindly offered the girlfriend a clerical position answering
phones. Both of them were terrible workers. The girlfriend missed about
every third day of work and never gave advance notice. Though warned to
change her habits repeatedly, the girlfriend lasted no more than a few
months. Bob missed work about once a week, and he was chronically late.
On top of that, he often took three or four daily bathroom breaks, each
over half an hour. It became so bad that, by the end of my tenure,
another employee and I made a game of it: We’d set a timer when he went
to the bathroom and shout the major milestones through the
warehouse—“Thirty-five minutes!” “Forty-five minutes!” “One hour!”</p>
<p>Eventually, Bob, too, was fired. When it happened, he lashed out at
his manager: “How could you do this to me? Don’t you know I’ve got a
pregnant girlfriend?” And he was not alone: At least two other people,
including Bob’s cousin, lost their jobs or quit during my short time at
the tile warehouse.</p>
<p>You can’t ignore stories like this when you talk about equal
opportunity. Nobel-winning economists worry about the decline of the
industrial Midwest and the hollowing out of the economic core of working
whites. What they mean is that manufacturing jobs have gone overseas and
middle-class jobs are harder to come by for people without college
degrees. Fair enough—I worry about those things, too. But this book is
about something else: what goes on in the lives of real people when the
industrial economy goes south. It’s about reacting to bad circumstances
in the worst way possible. It’s about a culture that increasingly
encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.</p>
<p>The problems that I saw at the tile warehouse run far deeper than
macroeconomic trends and policy. Too many young men immune to hard work.
Good jobs impossible to fill for any length of time. And a young man
with every reason to work—a wife-to-be to support and a baby on the
way—carelessly tossing aside a good job with excellent health insurance.
More troublingly, when it was all over, he thought something had been
done to him. There is a lack of agency here—a feeling that you have
little control over your life and a willingness to blame everyone but
yourself. This is distinct from the larger economic landscape of modern
America.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that although I focus on the group of people I
know—working-class whites with ties to Appalachia—I’m not arguing that
we deserve more sympathy than other folks. This is not a story about why
white people have more to complain about than black people or any other
group. That said, I do hope that readers of this book will be able to
take from it an appreciation of how class and family affect the poor
without filtering their views through a racial prism. To many analysts,
terms like “welfare queen” conjure unfair images of the lazy black mom
living on the dole. Readers of this book will realize quickly that there
is little relationship between that specter and my argument: I have
known many welfare queens; some were my neighbors, and all were
white.</p>
<p>This book is not an academic study. In the past few years, William
Julius Wilson, Charles Murray, Robert Putnam, and Raj Chetty have
authored compelling, well-researched tracts demonstrating that upward
mobility fell off in the 1970s and never really recovered, that some
regions have fared much worse than others (shocker: Appalachia and the
Rust Belt score poorly), and that many of the phenomena I saw in my own
life exist across society. I may quibble with some of their conclusions,
but they have demonstrated convincingly that America has a problem.
Though I will use data, and though I do sometimes rely on academic
studies to make a point, my primary aim is not to convince you of a
documented problem. My primary aim is to tell a true story about what
that problem feels like when you were born with it hanging around your
neck.</p>
<p>I cannot tell that story without appealing to the cast of characters
who made up my life. So this book is not just a personal memoir but a
family one—a history of opportunity and upward mobility viewed through
the eyes of a group of hillbillies from Appalachia. Two generations ago,
my grandparents were dirt-poor and in love. They got married and moved
north in the hope of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. Their
grandchild (me) graduated from one of the finest educational
institutions in the world. That’s the short version. The long version
exists in the pages that follow.</p>
<p>Though I sometimes change the names of people to protect their
privacy, this story is, to the best of my recollection, a fully accurate
portrait of the world I’ve witnessed. There are no composite characters
and no narrative shortcuts. Where possible, I corroborated the details
with documentation—report cards, handwritten letters, notes on
photographs—but I am sure this story is as fallible as any human memory.
Indeed, when I asked my sister to read an earlier draft, that draft
ignited a thirty-minute conversation about whether I had misplaced an
event chronologically. I left my version in, not because I suspect my
sister’s memory is faulty (in fact, I imagine hers is better than mine),
but because I think there is something to learn in how I’ve organized
the events in my own mind.</p>
<p>Nor am I an unbiased observer. Nearly every person you will read
about is deeply flawed. Some have tried to murder other people, and a
few were successful. Some have abused their children, physically or
emotionally. Many abused (and still abuse) drugs. But I love these
people, even those to whom I avoid speaking for my own sanity. And if I
leave you with the impression that there are bad people in my life, then
I am sorry, both to you and to the people so portrayed. For there are no
villains in this story. There’s just a ragtag band of hillbillies
struggling to find their way—both for their sake and, by the grace of
God, for mine.</p>
