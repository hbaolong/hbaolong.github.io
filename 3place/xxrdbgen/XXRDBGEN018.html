<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Shortly before Christmas last year, I stood in the kids’ section of a
Washington, D.C., Walmart, shopping list in hand, gazing at toys and
talking myself out of each of them. That year, I had volunteered to
“adopt” a needy child, which meant that I was given a list by the local
branch of the Salvation Army and told to return with a bag of unwrapped
Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty simple, but I managed to find fault with nearly
every suggestion. Pajamas? Poor people don’t wear pajamas. We fall
asleep in our underwear or blue jeans. To this day, I find the very
notion of pajamas an unnecessary elite indulgence, like caviar or
electric ice cube makers. There was a toy guitar that I thought looked
both fun and enriching, but I remembered the electronic keyboard my
grandparents had given me one year and how one of Mom’s boyfriends
meanly ordered me to “shut that fucking thing up.” I passed on learning
aids for fear of appearing condescending. Eventually I settled on some
clothes, a fake cell phone, and fire trucks.</p>
<p>I grew up in a world where everyone worried about how they’d pay for
Christmas. Now I live in one where opportunities abound for the wealthy
and privileged to shower their generosity on the community’s poor. Many
prestigious law firms sponsor an “angel program,” which assigns a child
to a lawyer and provides a wish list of gifts. Usha’s former courthouse
encouraged judicial employees to adopt a kid for the holidays—each a
child of someone who previously went through the court system. Program
coordinators hoped that if someone else purchased presents, the child’s
parents might feel less tempted to commit crimes in order to provide.
And there’s always Toys for Tots. During the past few Christmas seasons,
I’ve found myself in large department stores, buying toys for kids I’ve
never met.</p>
<p>As I shop, I’m reminded that wherever I fell on the American
socioeconomic ladder as a child, others occupy much lower rungs:
children who cannot depend on the generosity of grandparents for
Christmas gifts; parents whose financial situations are so dire that
they rely on criminal conduct—rather than payday loans—to put today’s
hot toys under the tree. This is a very useful exercise. As scarcity has
given way to plenty in my own life, these moments of retail reflection
force me to consider just how lucky I am.</p>
<p>Still, shopping for low-income kids reminds me of my childhood and of
the ways that Christmas gifts can serve as domestic land mines. Every
year the parents in my neighborhood would begin an annual ritual very
different from the one I’ve become accustomed to in my new material
comfort: worrying about how to give their kids a “nice Christmas,” with
niceness always defined by the bounty underneath the Christmas tree. If
your friends came over the week before Christmas and saw a barren floor
beneath the tree, you would offer a justification. “Mom just hasn’t gone
shopping yet” or “Dad’s waiting for a big paycheck at the end of the
year, and then he’ll get a ton of stuff.” These excuses were meant to
mask what everyone knew: All of us were poor, and no amount of Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles memorabilia would change that.</p>
<p>No matter our financial position, our family somehow managed to spend
just more than we had on holiday shopping. We didn’t qualify for credit
cards, but there were many ways to spend money you didn’t have. You
could write a future date on a check (a practice called “post-dating”)
so the recipient couldn’t cash it until you had money in the bank. You
could draw a short-term loan from a payday lender. If all else failed,
you could borrow money from the grandparents. Indeed, I recall many
winter conversations in which Mom pleaded with Mamaw and Papaw to lend
her money to ensure that their grandchildren had a nice Christmas.
They’d always protest Mom’s understanding of what made Christmas nice,
but they’d still give in. It might be the day before Christmas, but our
tree would be piled high with the trendiest gifts even as our family
savings dwindled from very little to nothing, then from nothing to
something less than that.</p>
<p>When I was a baby, Mom and Lindsay frantically searched for a Teddy
Ruxpin doll, a toy so popular that every store in town sold out. It was
expensive and, as I was only two, unnecessary. But Lindsay still
remembers the day wasted searching for the toy. Mom somehow received a
tip about a stranger who was willing to part with one of his Ruxpins at
a significant markup. Mom and Lindsay traveled to his house to fetch the
trinket that stood between a child who could barely walk and the
Christmas of his dreams. The only thing I remember of old Teddy is
finding him in a box years later, his sweater tattered and his face
covered in crusted snot.</p>
<p>It was the holiday season that taught me about tax refunds, which I
gathered were free bits of money sent to the poor in the new year to
save them from the financial indiscretions of the old one. Income tax
refunds were the ultimate backstops. “We can definitely afford this;
we’ll just pay for it with the refund check” became a Christmas mantra.
But the government was fickle. There were few moments more anxious than
the one when Mom came home from the tax preparer in early January.
Sometimes the refund exceeded expectations. But when Mom learned that
Uncle Sam couldn’t cover the Christmas splurge because her “credits”
weren’t as high as she had hoped, that could ruin your whole month. Ohio
Januaries are depressing enough as it is.</p>
<p>I assumed that rich people celebrated Christmas just like us, perhaps
with fewer financial worries and even cooler presents. Yet I noticed
after my cousin Bonnie was born that Christmastime at Aunt Wee’s house
had a decidedly different flavor. Somehow my aunt and uncle’s children
ended up with more pedestrian gifts than I had come to expect as a
child. There was no obsession with meeting a two- or
three-hundred-dollar threshold for each child, no worry that a kid would
suffer in the absence of the newest electronic gadget. Usha often
received books for Christmas. My cousin Bonnie, at the age of eleven,
asked her parents to donate her Christmas gifts to Middletown’s needy.
Shockingly, her parents obliged: They didn’t define their family’s
Christmas holiday by the dollar value of gifts their daughter
accumulated.</p>
<p>However you want to define these two groups and their approach to
giving—rich and poor; educated and uneducated; upper-class and
working-class—their members increasingly occupy two separate worlds. As
a cultural emigrant from one group to the other, I am acutely aware of
their differences. Sometimes I view members of the elite with an almost
primal scorn—recently, an acquaintance used the word “confabulate” in a
sentence, and I just wanted to scream. But I have to give it to them:
Their children are happier and healthier, their divorce rates lower,
their church attendance higher, their lives longer. These people are
beating us at our own damned game.</p>
<p>I was able to escape the worst of my culture’s inheritance. And
uneasy though I am about my new life, I cannot whine about it: The life
I lead now was the stuff of fantasy during my childhood. So many people
helped create that fantasy. At every level of my life and in every
environment, I have found family and mentors and lifelong friends who
supported and enabled me.</p>
<p>But I often wonder: Where would I be without them? I think back on my
freshman year of high school, a grade I nearly failed, and the morning
when Mom walked into Mamaw’s house demanding a cup of clean urine. Or
years before that, when I was a lonely kid with two fathers, neither of
whom I saw very often, and Papaw decided that he would be the best dad
he could be for as long as he lived. Or the months I spent with Lindsay,
a teenage girl acting as a mother while our own mother lived in a
treatment center. Or the moment I can’t even remember when Papaw
installed a secret phone line in the bottom of my toy box so that
Lindsay could call Mamaw and Papaw if things got a little too crazy.
Thinking about it now, about how close I was to the abyss, gives me
chills. I am one lucky son of a bitch.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I had lunch with Brian, a young man who reminded me of
fifteen-year-old J.D. Like Mom, his mother caught a taste for narcotics,
and like me, he has a complicated relationship with his father. He’s a
sweet kid with a big heart and a quiet manner. He has spent nearly his
entire life in Appalachian Kentucky; we went to lunch at a local
fast-food restaurant, because in that corner of the world there isn’t
much else to eat. As we talked, I noticed little quirks that few others
would. He didn’t want to share his milk shake, which was a little out of
character for a kid who ended every sentence with “please” or “thank
you.” He finished his food quickly and then nervously looked from person
to person. I could tell that he wanted to ask a question, so I wrapped
my arm around his shoulder and asked if he needed anything. “Y—Yeah,” he
started, refusing to make eye contact. And then, almost in a whisper: “I
wonder if I could get a few more french fries?” He was hungry. In 2014,
in the richest country on earth, he wanted a little extra to eat but
felt uncomfortable asking. Lord help us.</p>
<p>Just a few months after we saw each other last, Brian’s mom died
unexpectedly. He hadn’t lived with her in years, so outsiders might
imagine that her death was easier to bear. Those folks are wrong. People
like Brian and me don’t lose contact with our parents because we don’t
care; we lose contact with them to survive. We never stop loving, and we
never lose hope that our loved ones will change. Rather, we are forced,
either by wisdom or by the law, to take the path of
self-preservation.</p>
<p>What happens to Brian? He has no Mamaw or Papaw, at least not like
mine, and though he’s lucky enough to have supportive family who will
keep him out of foster care, his hope of a “normal life” evaporated long
ago, if it ever existed. When we met, his mother had already permanently
lost custody. In his short life, he has already experienced multiple
instances of childhood trauma, and in a few years he will begin making
decisions about employment and education that even children of wealth
and privilege have trouble navigating.</p>
<p>Any chance he has lies with the people around him—his family, me, my
kin, the people like us, and the broad community of hillbillies. And if
that chance is to materialize, we hillbillies must wake the hell up.
Brian’s mom’s death was another shitty card in an already abysmal hand,
but there are many cards left to deal: whether his community empowers
him with a sense that he can control his own destiny or encourages him
to take refuge in resentment at forces beyond his control; whether he
can access a church that teaches him lessons of Christian love, family,
and purpose; whether those people who do step up to positively influence
Brian find emotional and spiritual support from their neighbors.</p>
<p>I believe we hillbillies are the toughest goddamned people on this
earth. We take an electric saw to the hide of those who insult our
mother. We make young men consume cotton undergarments to protect a
sister’s honor. But are we tough enough to do what needs to be done to
help a kid like Brian? Are we tough enough to build a church that forces
kids like me to engage with the world rather than withdraw from it? Are
we tough enough to look ourselves in the mirror and admit that our
conduct harms our children?</p>
<p>Public policy can help, but there is no government that can fix these
problems for us.</p>
<p>Recall how my cousin Mike sold his mother’s house—a property that had
been in our family for over a century—because he couldn’t trust his own
neighbors not to ransack it. Mamaw refused to purchase bicycles for her
grandchildren because they kept disappearing—even when locked up—from
her front porch. She feared answering her door toward the end of her
life because an able-bodied woman who lived next door would not stop
bothering her for cash—money, we later learned, for drugs. These
problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else.
We created them, and only we can fix them.</p>
<p>We don’t need to live like the elites of California, New York, or
Washington, D.C. We don’t need to work a hundred hours a week at law
firms and investment banks. We don’t need to socialize at cocktail
parties. We do need to create a space for the J.D.s and Brians of the
world to have a chance. I don’t know what the answer is, precisely, but
I know it starts when we stop blaming Obama or Bush or faceless
companies and ask ourselves what we can do to make things better.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask Brian whether, like me, he had bad dreams. For nearly
two decades, I suffered from a terrible recurring nightmare. The first
time it came to me, I was seven, fast asleep in my great Mamaw Blanton’s
bed. In the dream, I’m trapped in large conference room in a large tree
house—as if the Keebler elves had just finished a massive picnic and
their tree house were still adorned with dozens of tables and chairs.
I’m there alone with Lindsay and Mamaw, when all of a sudden Mom charges
through the room, tossing tables and chairs as she goes. She screams,
but her voice is robotic and distorted, as if filtered through radio
static. Mamaw and Lindsay run for a hole in the floor—presumably the
exit ladder from the tree house. I fall behind, and by the time I reach
the exit, Mom is just behind me. I wake up, right as she’s about to grab
me, when I realize not just that the monster has caught me but that
Mamaw and Lindsay have abandoned me.</p>
<p>In different versions, the antagonist changes form. It has been a
Marine Corps drill instructor, a barking dog, a movie villain, and a
mean teacher. Mamaw and Lindsay always make an appearance, and they
always make it to the exit just ahead of me. Without fail, the dream
provokes pure terror. The first time I had it, I woke up and ran to
Mamaw, who was up late watching TV. I explained the dream and begged her
never to leave me. She promised that she wouldn’t and stroked my hair
until I fell asleep again.</p>
<p>My subconscious had spared me for years, when, out of nowhere, I had
the dream again a few weeks after I graduated from law school. There was
a crucial difference: The subject of the monster’s ire wasn’t me but my
dog, Casper, with whom I’d lost my temper earlier in the night. There
was no Lindsay and no Mamaw. And I was the monster.</p>
<p>I chased my poor dog around the tree house, hoping to catch him and
throttle him. But I felt Casper’s terror, and I felt my shame at having
lost my temper. I finally caught up to him, but I didn’t wake up.
Instead, Casper turned and looked at me with those sad, heart-piercing
eyes that only dogs possess. So I didn’t throttle him; I gave him a hug.
And the last emotion I felt before waking was relief at having
controlled my temper.</p>
<p>I got out of bed for a glass of cold water, and when I returned,
Casper was staring at me, wondering what on earth his human was doing
awake at such an odd hour. It was two o’clock in the morning—probably
about the same time it was when I first woke from the terrifying dream
over twenty years earlier. There was no Mamaw to comfort me. But there
were my two dogs on the floor, and there was the love of my life lying
in bed. Tomorrow I would go to work, take the dogs to the park, buy
groceries with Usha, and make a nice dinner. It was everything I ever
wanted. So I patted Casper’s head and went back to sleep.</p>
