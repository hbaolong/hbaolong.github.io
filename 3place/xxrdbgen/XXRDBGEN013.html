<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>I arrived for orientation at Ohio State in early September 2007, and
I couldn’t have been more excited. I remember every little detail about
that day: lunch at Chipotle, the first time Lindsay had ever eaten
there; the walk from the orientation building to the south campus house
that would soon be my Columbus home; the beautiful weather. I met with a
guidance counselor who talked me through my first college schedule,
which put me in class only four days per week, never before nine thirty
in the morning. After the Marine Corps and its five thirty A.M.
wake-ups, I couldn’t believe my good fortune.</p>
<p>Ohio State’s main campus in Columbus is about a hundred miles away
from Middletown, meaning it was close enough for weekend visits to my
family. For the first time in a few years, I could drop in on Middletown
whenever I felt like it. And while Havelock (the North Carolina city
closest to my Marine Corps base) was not too different from Middletown,
Columbus felt like an urban paradise. It was (and remains) one of the
fastest-growing cities in the country, powered in large part by the
bustling university that was now my home. OSU grads were starting
businesses, historic buildings were being converted into new restaurants
and bars, and even the worst neighborhoods seemed to be undergoing
significant revitalization. Not long after I moved to Columbus, one of
my best friends began working as the promotions director for a local
radio station, so I always knew what was happening around town and
always had an in to the city’s best events, from local festivals to VIP
seating for the annual fireworks show.</p>
<p>In many ways, college was very familiar. I made a lot of new friends,
but virtually all of them were from southwest Ohio. My six roommates
included five graduates of Middletown High School and one graduate of
Edgewood High School in nearby Trenton. They were a little younger (the
Marine Corps had aged me past the age of the typical freshman), but I
knew most of them from back home. My closest friends had already
graduated or were about to, but many stayed in Columbus after
graduation. Though I didn’t know it, I was witnessing a phenomenon that
social scientists call “brain drain”—people who are able to leave
struggling cities often do, and when they find a new home with
educational and work opportunities, they stay there. Years later, I
looked at my wedding party of six groomsmen and realized that every
single one of them had, like me, grown up in a small Ohio town before
leaving for Ohio State. To a man, all of them had found careers outside
of their hometowns, and none of them had any interest in ever going
back.</p>
<p>By the time I started at Ohio State, the Marine Corps had instilled
in me an incredible sense of invincibility. I’d go to classes, do my
homework, study at the library, and make it home in time to drink well
past midnight with my buddies, then wake up early to go running. My
schedule was intense, but everything that had made me fear the
independent college life when I was eighteen felt like a piece of cake
now. I had puzzled through those financial aid forms with Mamaw a few
years earlier, arguing about whether to list her or Mom as my
“parent/guardian.” We had worried that unless I somehow obtained and
submitted the financial information of Bob Hamel (my legal father), I’d
be guilty of fraud. The whole experience had made both of us painfully
aware of how unfamiliar we were with the outside world. I had nearly
failed out of high school, earning Ds and Fs in English I. Now I paid my
own bills and earned As in every class I took at my state’s flagship
university. I felt completely in control of my destiny in a way that I
never had before.</p>
<p>I knew that Ohio State was put-up-or-shut-up time. I had left the
Marine Corps not just with a sense that I could do what I wanted but
also with the capacity to plan. I wanted to go to law school, and I knew
that to go to the best law school, I’d need good grades and to ace the
infamous Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT. There was much I didn’t
know, of course. I couldn’t really explain why I wanted to go to law
school besides the fact that in Middletown the “rich kids” were born to
either doctors or lawyers, and I didn’t want to work with blood. I
didn’t know how much else was out there, but the little knowledge I had
at least gave me direction, and that was all I needed.</p>
<p>I loathed debt and the sense of limitation it imposed. Though the GI
Bill paid for a significant chunk of my education, and Ohio State
charged relatively little to an in-state resident, I still needed to
cover about twenty thousand dollars of expenses on my own. I took a job
at the Ohio Statehouse, working for a remarkably kind senator from the
Cincinnati area named Bob Schuler. He was a good man, and I liked his
politics, so when constituents called and complained, I tried to explain
his positions. I watched lobbyists come and go and overheard the senator
and his staff debate whether a particular bill was good for his
constituents, good for his state, or good for both. Observing the
political process from the inside made me appreciate it in a way that
watching cable news never had. Mamaw had thought all politicians were
crooks, but I learned that, no matter their politics, that was largely
untrue at the Ohio Statehouse.</p>
<p>After a few months at the Ohio Senate, as my bills piled up and I
found fewer and fewer ways to make up the difference between my spending
and my income (one can donate plasma only twice per week, I learned), I
decided to get another job. One nonprofit advertised a part-time job
that paid ten dollars an hour, but when I showed up for the interview in
khakis, an ugly lime-green shirt, and Marine Corps combat boots (my only
non-sneakers at the time) and saw the interviewer’s reaction, I knew
that I was out of luck. I barely noticed the rejection email a week
later. A local nonprofit did work for abused and neglected children, and
they also paid ten dollars an hour, so I went to Target, bought a nicer
shirt and a pair of black shoes, and came away with a job offer to be a
“consultant.” I cared about their mission, and they were great people. I
began work immediately.</p>
<p>With two jobs and a full-time class load, my schedule intensified,
but I didn’t mind. I didn’t realize there was anything unusual about my
commitments until a professor emailed me about meeting after class to
discuss a writing assignment. When I sent him my schedule, he was
aghast. He sternly told me that I should focus on my education and not
let work distractions stand in my way. I smiled, shook his hand, and
said thanks, but I did not heed his advice. I liked staying up late to
work on assignments, waking up early after only three or four hours of
sleep, and patting myself on the back for being able to do it. After so
many years of fearing my own future, of worrying that I’d end up like
many of my neighbors or family—addicted to drugs or alcohol, in prison,
or with kids I couldn’t or wouldn’t take care of—I felt an incredible
momentum. I knew the statistics. I had read the brochures in the social
worker’s office when I was a kid. I had recognized the look of pity from
the hygienist at the low-income dental clinic. I wasn’t supposed to make
it, but I was doing just fine on my own.</p>
<p>Did I take it too far? Absolutely. I didn’t sleep enough. I drank too
much and ate Taco Bell at nearly every meal. A week into what I thought
was just a really awful cold, a doctor told me that I had mono. I
ignored him and kept on living as though NyQuil and DayQuil were magical
elixirs. After a week of this, my urine turned a disgusting brown shade,
and my temperature registered 103. I realized I might need to take care
of myself, so I downed some Tylenol, drank a couple of beers, and went
to sleep.</p>
<p>When Mom found out what was happening, she drove to Columbus and took
me to the emergency room. She wasn’t perfect, she wasn’t even a
practicing nurse, but she took it as a point of pride to supervise every
interaction we had with the health care system. She asked the right
questions, got annoyed with doctors when they didn’t answer directly,
and made sure I had what I needed. I spent two full days in the hospital
as doctors emptied five bags of saline to rehydrate me and discovered
that I had contracted a staph infection in addition to the mono, which
explained why I grew so sick. The doctors released me to Mom, who
wheeled me out of the hospital and took me home to recover.</p>
<p>My illness lasted another few weeks, which, happily, coincided with
the break between Ohio State’s spring and summer terms. When I was in
Middletown, I split time between Aunt Wee’s and Mom’s; both of them
cared for me and treated me like a son. It was my first real
introduction to the competing emotional demands of Middletown in a
post-Mamaw world: I didn’t want to hurt Mom’s feelings, but the past had
created rifts that would likely never go away. I never confronted these
demands head-on. I never explained to Mom that no matter how nice and
caring she was at any given time—and while I had mono, she couldn’t have
been a better mother—I just felt uncomfortable around her. To sleep in
her house meant talking to husband number five, a kind man but a
stranger who would never be anything to me but the future ex–Mr. Mom. It
meant looking at her furniture and remembering the time I hid behind it
during one of her fights with Bob. It meant trying to understand how Mom
could be such a contradiction—a woman who sat patiently with me at the
hospital for days and an addict who would lie to her family to extract
money from them a month later.</p>
<p>I knew that my increasingly close relationship with Aunt Wee hurt
Mom’s feelings. She talked about it all the time. “I’m your mother, not
her,” she’d repeat. To this day, I often wonder whether, if I’d had the
courage as an adult that I’d had as a child, Mom might have gotten
better. Addicts are at their weakest during emotionally trying times,
and I knew that I had the power to save her from at least some bouts of
sadness. But I couldn’t do it any longer. I didn’t know what had
changed, but I wasn’t that person anymore. Perhaps it was nothing more
than self-preservation. Regardless, I couldn’t pretend to feel at home
with her.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of mono, I felt well enough to return to Columbus
and my classes. I’d lost a lot of weight—twenty pounds over four
weeks—but otherwise felt pretty good. With the hospital bills piling up,
I got a third job (as an SAT tutor at the Princeton Review), which paid
an incredible eighteen dollars an hour. Three jobs were too much, so I
dropped the job I loved the most—my work at the Ohio senate—because it
paid the least. I needed money and the financial freedom it provided,
not rewarding work. That, I told myself, would come later.</p>
<p>Shortly before I left, the Ohio senate debated a measure that would
significantly curb payday-lending practices. My senator opposed the bill
(one of the few senators to do so), and though he never explained why, I
liked to think that maybe he and I had something in common. The senators
and policy staff debating the bill had little appreciation for the role
of payday lenders in the shadow economy that people like me occupied. To
them, payday lenders were predatory sharks, charging high interest rates
on loans and exorbitant fees for cashed checks. The sooner they were
snuffed out, the better.</p>
<p>To me, payday lenders could solve important financial problems. My
credit was awful, thanks to a host of terrible financial decisions (some
of which weren’t my fault, many of which were), so credit cards weren’t
a possibility. If I wanted to take a girl out to dinner or needed a book
for school and didn’t have money in the bank, I didn’t have many
options. (I probably could have asked my aunt or uncle, but I
desperately wanted to do things on my own.) One Friday morning I dropped
off my rent check, knowing that if I waited another day, the
fifty-dollar late fee would kick in. I didn’t have enough money to cover
the check, but I’d get paid that day and would be able to deposit the
money after work. However, after a long day at the senate, I forgot to
grab my paycheck before I left. By the time I realized the mistake, I
was already home, and the Statehouse staff had left for the weekend. On
that day, a three-day payday loan, with a few dollars of interest,
enabled me to avoid a significant overdraft fee. The legislators
debating the merits of payday lending didn’t mention situations like
that. The lesson? Powerful people sometimes do things to help people
like me without really understanding people like me.</p>
<p>My second year of college started pretty much as my first year had,
with a beautiful day and a lot of excitement. With the new job, I was a
bit busier, but I didn’t mind the work. What I did mind was the gnawing
feeling that, at twenty-four, I was a little too old to be a second-year
college student. But with four years in the Marine Corps behind me, more
separated me from the other students than age. During an undergraduate
seminar in foreign policy, I listened as a nineteen-year-old classmate
with a hideous beard spouted off about the Iraq war. He explained that
those fighting the war were typically less intelligent than those (like
him) who immediately went to college. It showed, he argued, in the
wanton way soldiers butchered and disrespected Iraqi civilians. It was
an objectively terrible opinion—my friends from the Marine Corps spanned
the political spectrum and held nearly every conceivable opinion about
the war. Many of my Marine Corps friends were staunch liberals who had
no love for our commander in chief—then George W. Bush—and felt that we
had sacrificed too much for too little gain. But none of them had ever
uttered such unreflective tripe.</p>
<p>As the student prattled on, I thought about the never-ending training
on how to respect Iraqi culture—never show anyone the bottom of your
foot, never address a woman in traditional Muslim garb without first
speaking to a male relative. I thought about the security we provided
for Iraqi poll workers, and how we studiously explained the importance
of their mission without ever pushing our own political views on them. I
thought about listening to a young Iraqi (who couldn’t speak a word of
English) flawlessly rap every single word of 50 Cent’s “In Da Club” and
laughing along with him and his friends. I thought about my friends who
were covered in third-degree burns, “lucky” to have survived an IED
attack in the Al-Qaim region of Iraq. And here was this dipshit in a
spotty beard telling our class that we murdered people for sport.</p>
<p>I felt an immediate drive to finish college as quickly as possible. I
met with a guidance counselor and plotted my exit—I’d need to take
classes during the summer and more than double the full-time course load
during some terms. It was, even by my heightened standards, an intense
year. During a particularly terrible February, I sat down with my
calendar and counted the number of days since I’d slept more than four
hours in a day. The tally was thirty-nine. But I continued, and in
August 2009, after one year and eleven months at Ohio State, I graduated
with a double major, summa cum laude. I tried to skip my graduation
ceremony, but my family wouldn’t let me. So I sat in an uncomfortable
chair for three hours before I walked across the podium and received my
college diploma. When Gordon Gee, then president of the Ohio State
University, paused for an unusually long photograph with the girl who
stood in front of me in line, I extended my hand to his assistant,
nonverbally asking for the diploma. She handed it to me, and I stepped
behind Dr. Gee and down off the podium. I may have been the only
graduating student that day to not shake his hand. On to the next one, I
thought.</p>
<p>I knew I’d go to law school later the next year (my August graduation
precluded a 2009 start to law school), so I moved home to save money.
Aunt Wee had taken Mamaw’s place as the family matriarch: She put out
the fires, hosted family gatherings, and kept us all from breaking
apart. She had always provided me with a home base after Mamaw’s death,
but ten months seemed like an imposition; I didn’t like the idea of
disrupting her family’s routine. But she insisted, “J.D., this is your
home now. It’s the only place for you to stay.”</p>
<p>Those last months living in Middletown were among the happiest of my
life. I was finally a college graduate, and I knew that I’d soon
accomplish another dream—going to law school. I worked odd jobs to save
money and grew closer to my aunt’s two daughters. Every day I’d get home
from work, dusty and sweaty from manual labor, and sit at the dinner
table to hear my teenage cousins talk about their days at school and
trials with friends. Sometimes I’d help with homework. On Fridays during
Lent, I helped with the fish fries at the local Catholic church. That
feeling I had in college—that I had survived decades of chaos and
heartbreak and finally come out on the other side—deepened.</p>
<p>The incredible optimism I felt about my own life contrasted starkly
with the pessimism of so many of my neighbors. Years of decline in the
blue-collar economy manifested themselves in the material prospects of
Middletown’s residents. The Great Recession, and the not-great recovery
that followed, had hastened Middletown’s downward trajectory. But there
was something almost spiritual about the cynicism of the community at
large, something that went much deeper than a short-term recession.</p>
<p>As a culture, we had no heroes. Certainly not any politician—Barack
Obama was then the most admired man in America (and likely still is),
but even when the country was enraptured by his rise, most Middletonians
viewed him suspiciously. George W. Bush had few fans in 2008. Many loved
Bill Clinton, but many more saw him as the symbol of American moral
decay, and Ronald Reagan was long dead. We loved the military but had no
George S. Patton figure in the modern army. I doubt my neighbors could
even name a high-ranking military officer. The space program, long a
source of pride, had gone the way of the dodo, and with it the celebrity
astronauts. Nothing united us with the core fabric of American society.
We felt trapped in two seemingly unwinnable wars, in which a
disproportionate share of the fighters came from our neighborhood, and
in an economy that failed to deliver the most basic promise of the
American Dream—a steady wage.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of this cultural detachment, you must
appreciate that much of my family’s, my neighborhood’s, and my
community’s identity derives from our love of country. I couldn’t tell
you a single thing about Breathitt County’s mayor, its health care
services, or its famous residents. But I do know this: “Bloody
Breathitt” allegedly earned its name because the county filled its World
War I draft quota entirely with volunteers—the only county in the entire
United States to do so. Nearly a century later, and that’s the factoid
about Breathitt that I remember best: It’s the truth that everyone
around me ensured I knew. I once interviewed Mamaw for a class project
about World War II. After seventy years filled with marriage, children,
grandchildren, death, poverty, and triumph, the thing about which Mamaw
was unquestionably the proudest and most excited was that she and her
family did their part during World War II. We spoke for minutes about
everything else; we spoke for hours about war rations, Rosie the
Riveter, her dad’s wartime love letters to her mother from the Pacific,
and the day “we dropped the bomb.” Mamaw always had two gods: Jesus
Christ and the United States of America. I was no different, and neither
was anyone else I knew.</p>
<p>I’m the kind of patriot whom people on the Acela corridor laugh at. I
choke up when I hear Lee Greenwood’s cheesy anthem “Proud to Be an
American.” When I was sixteen, I vowed that every time I met a veteran,
I would go out of my way to shake his or her hand, even if I had to
awkwardly interject to do so. To this day, I refuse to watch Saving
Private Ryan around anyone but my closest friends, because I can’t stop
from crying during the final scene.</p>
<p>Mamaw and Papaw taught me that we live in the best and greatest
country on earth. This fact gave meaning to my childhood. Whenever times
were tough—when I felt overwhelmed by the drama and the tumult of my
youth—I knew that better days were ahead because I lived in a country
that allowed me to make the good choices that others hadn’t. When I
think today about my life and how genuinely incredible it is—a gorgeous,
kind, brilliant life partner; the financial security that I dreamed
about as a child; great friends and exciting new experiences—I feel
overwhelming appreciation for these United States. I know it’s corny,
but it’s the way I feel.</p>
<p>If Mamaw’s second God was the United States of America, then many
people in my community were losing something akin to a religion. The tie
that bound them to their neighbors, that inspired them in the way my
patriotism had always inspired me, had seemingly vanished.</p>
<p>The symptoms are all around us. Significant percentages of white
conservative voters—about one-third—believe that Barack Obama is a
Muslim. In one poll, 32 percent of conservatives said that they believed
Obama was foreign-born and another 19 percent said they were
unsure—which means that a majority of white conservatives aren’t certain
that Obama is even an American. I regularly hear from acquaintances or
distant family members that Obama has ties to Islamic extremists, or is
a traitor, or was born in some far-flung corner of the world.</p>
<p>Many of my new friends blame racism for this perception of the
president. But the president feels like an alien to many Middletonians
for reasons that have nothing to do with skin color. Recall that not a
single one of my high school classmates attended an Ivy League school.
Barack Obama attended two of them and excelled at both. He is brilliant,
wealthy, and speaks like a constitutional law professor—which, of
course, he is. Nothing about him bears any resemblance to the people I
admired growing up: His accent—clean, perfect, neutral—is foreign; his
credentials are so impressive that they’re frightening; he made his life
in Chicago, a dense metropolis; and he conducts himself with a
confidence that comes from knowing that the modern American meritocracy
was built for him. Of course, Obama overcame adversity in his own
right—adversity familiar to many of us—but that was long before any of
us knew him.</p>
<p>President Obama came on the scene right as so many people in my
community began to believe that the modern American meritocracy was not
built for them. We know we’re not doing well. We see it every day: in
the obituaries for teenage kids that conspicuously omit the cause of
death (reading between the lines: overdose), in the deadbeats we watch
our daughters waste their time with. Barack Obama strikes at the heart
of our deepest insecurities. He is a good father while many of us
aren’t. He wears suits to his job while we wear overalls, if we’re lucky
enough to have a job at all. His wife tells us that we shouldn’t be
feeding our children certain foods, and we hate her for it—not because
we think she’s wrong but because we know she’s right.</p>
<p>Many try to blame the anger and cynicism of working-class whites on
misinformation. Admittedly, there is an industry of conspiracy-mongers
and fringe lunatics writing about all manner of idiocy, from Obama’s
alleged religious leanings to his ancestry. But every major news
organization, even the oft-maligned Fox News, has always told the truth
about Obama’s citizenship status and religious views. The people I know
are well aware of what the major news organizations have to say about
the issue; they simply don’t believe them. Only 6 percent of American
voters believe that the media is “very trustworthy.”21 To many of us,
the free press—that bulwark of American democracy—is simply full of
shit.</p>
<p>With little trust in the press, there’s no check on the Internet
conspiracy theories that rule the digital world. Barack Obama is a
foreign alien actively trying to destroy our country. Everything the
media tells us is a lie. Many in the white working class believe the
worst about their society. Here’s a small sample of emails or messages
I’ve seen from friends or family:</p>
<p>•From right-wing radio talker Alex Jones on the ten-year anniversary
of 9/11, a documentary about the “unanswered question” of the terrorist
attacks, suggesting that the U.S. government played a role in the
massacre of its own people.</p>
<p>•From an email chain, a story that the Obamacare legislation requires
microchip implantation in new health care patients. This story carries
extra bite because of the religious implications: Many believe that the
End Times “mark of the beast” foretold in biblical prophecy will be an
electronic device. Multiple friends warned others about this threat via
social media.</p>
<p>•From the popular website WorldNetDaily, an editorial suggesting that
the Newtown gun massacre was engineered by the federal government to
turn public opinion on gun control measures.</p>
<p>•From multiple Internet sources, suggestions that Obama will soon
implement martial law in order to secure power for a third presidential
term.</p>
<p>The list goes on. It’s impossible to know how many people believe one
or many of these stories. But if a third of our community questions the
president’s origin—despite all evidence to the contrary—it’s a good bet
that the other conspiracies have broader currency than we’d like. This
isn’t some libertarian mistrust of government policy, which is healthy
in any democracy. This is deep skepticism of the very institutions of
our society. And it’s becoming more and more mainstream.</p>
<p>We can’t trust the evening news. We can’t trust our politicians. Our
universities, the gateway to a better life, are rigged against us. We
can’t get jobs. You can’t believe these things and participate
meaningfully in society. Social psychologists have shown that group
belief is a powerful motivator in performance. When groups perceive that
it’s in their interest to work hard and achieve things, members of that
group outperform other similarly situated individuals. It’s obvious why:
If you believe that hard work pays off, then you work hard; if you think
it’s hard to get ahead even when you try, then why try at all?</p>
<p>Similarly, when people do fail, this mind-set allows them to look
outward. I once ran into an old acquaintance at a Middletown bar who
told me that he had recently quit his job because he was sick of waking
up early. I later saw him complaining on Facebook about the “Obama
economy” and how it had affected his life. I don’t doubt that the Obama
economy has affected many, but this man is assuredly not among them. His
status in life is directly attributable to the choices he’s made, and
his life will improve only through better decisions. But for him to make
better choices, he needs to live in an environment that forces him to
ask tough questions about himself. There is a cultural movement in the
white working class to blame problems on society or the government, and
that movement gains adherents by the day.</p>
<p>Here is where the rhetoric of modern conservatives (and I say this as
one of them) fails to meet the real challenges of their biggest
constituents. Instead of encouraging engagement, conservatives
increasingly foment the kind of detachment that has sapped the ambition
of so many of my peers. I have watched some friends blossom into
successful adults and others fall victim to the worst of Middletown’s
temptations—premature parenthood, drugs, incarceration. What separates
the successful from the unsuccessful are the expectations that they had
for their own lives. Yet the message of the right is increasingly: It’s
not your fault that you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault.</p>
<p>My dad, for example, has never disparaged hard work, but he mistrusts
some of the most obvious paths to upward mobility. When he found out
that I had decided to go to Yale Law, he asked whether, on my
applications, I had “pretended to be black or liberal.” This is how low
the cultural expectations of working-class white Americans have fallen.
We should hardly be surprised that as attitudes like this one spread,
the number of people willing to work for a better life diminishes.</p>
<p>The Pew Economic Mobility Project studied how Americans evaluated
their chances at economic betterment, and what they found was shocking.
There is no group of Americans more pessimistic than working-class
whites. Well over half of blacks, Latinos, and college-educated whites
expect that their children will fare better economically than they have.
Among working-class whites, only 44 percent share that expectation. Even
more surprising, 42 percent of working-class whites—by far the highest
number in the survey—report that their lives are less economically
successful than those of their parents’.</p>
<p>In 2010, that just wasn’t my mind-set. I was happy about where I was
and overwhelmingly hopeful about the future. For the first time in my
life, I felt like an outsider in Middletown. And what turned me into an
alien was my optimism.</p>
