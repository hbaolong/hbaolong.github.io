<h4 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h4>
<p>In the fall after I turned thirteen, Mom began dating Matt, a younger
guy who worked as a firefighter. I adored Matt from the start—he was my
favorite of all of Mom’s men, and we still keep in touch. One night I
was at home watching TV, waiting for Mom to get home from work with a
bucket of KFC for dinner. I had two responsibilities that evening:
first, track down Lindsay in case she was hungry; and second, run food
over to Mamaw as soon as Mom arrived. Shortly before I expected Mom,
Mamaw called. “Where is your mother?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. What’s wrong, Mamaw?”</p>
<p>Her response, more than anything I’ve ever heard, is seared in my
memory. She was worried—scared, even. The hillbilly accent that she
usually hid dripped from her lips. “No one has seen or heard from
Papaw.” I told her I’d call as soon as Mom got home, which I expected
would happen soon.</p>
<p>I figured Mamaw was overreacting. But then I considered the utter
predictability of Papaw’s schedule. He woke at six in the morning every
day, without an alarm clock, then drove to McDonald’s at seven to grab a
coffee with his old Armco buddies. After a couple of hours of
conversation, he would amble over to Mamaw’s house and spend the morning
watching TV or playing cards. If he left at all before dinnertime, he
might briefly visit his friend Paul’s hardware store. Without exception,
he stayed at Mamaw’s house to greet me when I came home from school. And
if I didn’t go to Mamaw’s—if I went to Mom’s, as I did when times were
good—he’d usually come over and say goodbye before he went home for the
evening. That he had missed all of these events meant that something was
very wrong.</p>
<p>Mom walked in the door a few minutes after Mamaw called, and I was
already sobbing. “Papaw . . . Papaw, I think he’s dead.” The rest is a
blur: I think I relayed Mamaw’s message; we picked her up down the
street and sped over to Papaw’s house, no more than a few minutes’ drive
away. I knocked on his door violently. Mom ran to the back door,
screamed, and came around front, both to tell Mamaw that he was hunched
over in his chair and to grab a rock. She then broke and went in through
a window, unlocked and opened the door, and tended to her father. By
then he had been dead for nearly a day.</p>
<p>Mom and Mamaw sobbed uncontrollably as we waited for an ambulance. I
tried to hug Mamaw, but she was beside herself and unresponsive even to
me. When she stopped crying, she clutched me to her chest and told me to
go say goodbye before they took his body away. I tried, but the medical
technician kneeling beside him gazed at me as if she thought I was
creepy for wanting to look at a dead body. I didn’t tell her the real
reason I had walked back to my slouching Papaw.</p>
<p>After the ambulance took Papaw’s body away, we drove immediately to
Aunt Wee’s house. I guessed Mom had called her, because she descended
from her porch with tears in her eyes. We all hugged her before
squeezing into the car and heading back to Mamaw’s. The adults gave me
the unenviable task of tracking down Lindsay and giving her the news.
This was before cell phones, and Lindsay, being a seventeen-year-old,
was difficult to reach. She wasn’t answering the house phone, and none
of her friends answered my calls. Mamaw’s house sat literally five
houses away from Mom’s—313 McKinley to 303—so I listened to the adults
make plans and watched out the window for signs of my sister’s return.
The adults spoke about funeral arrangements, where Papaw would want to
be buried—“In Jackson, goddammit,” Mamaw insisted—and who would call
Uncle Jimmy and tell him to come home.</p>
<p>Lindsay returned home shortly before midnight. I trudged down the
street and opened our door. She was walking down the stairs but stopped
cold when she saw my face, red and blotchy from crying all day. “Papaw,”
I blurted out. “He’s dead.” Lindsay collapsed on the stairs, and I ran
up and embraced her. We sat there for a few minutes, crying as two
children do when they find out that the most important man in their
lives has died. Lindsay said something then, and though I don’t remember
the exact phrase, I do remember that Papaw had just done some work on
her car, and she was muttering something through the tears about taking
advantage of him.</p>
<p>Lindsay was a teenager when Papaw died, at the height of that weird
mixture of thinking you know everything and caring too much about how
others perceive you. Papaw was many things, but he was never cool. He
wore the same old T-shirt every day with a front pocket just big enough
to fit a pack of cigarettes. He always smelled of mildew, because he
washed his clothes but let them dry “naturally,” meaning packed together
in a washing machine. A lifetime of smoking had blessed him with an
unlimited supply of phlegm, and he had no problem sharing that phlegm
with everyone, no matter the time or occasion. He listened to Johnny
Cash on perpetual repeat and drove an old El Camino—a car
truck—everywhere he went. In other words, Papaw wasn’t ideal company for
a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl with an active social life. Thus,
she took advantage of him in the same way that every young girl takes
advantage of a father: She loved and admired him, she asked him for
things that he sometimes gave her, and she didn’t pay him a lot of
attention when she was around her friends.</p>
<p>To this day, being able to “take advantage” of someone is the measure
in my mind of having a parent. For me and Lindsay, the fear of imposing
stalked our minds, infecting even the food we ate. We recognized
instinctively that many of the people we depended on weren’t supposed to
play that role in our lives, so much so that it was one of the first
things Lindsay thought of when she learned of Papaw’s death. We were
conditioned to feel that we couldn’t really depend on people—that, even
as children, asking someone for a meal or for help with a broken-down
automobile was a luxury that we shouldn’t indulge in too much lest we
fully tap the reservoir of goodwill serving as a safety valve in our
lives. Mamaw and Papaw did everything they could to fight that instinct.
On our rare trips to a nice restaurant, they would interrogate me about
what I truly wanted until I’d confess that yes, I did want the steak.
And then they’d order it for me over my protests. No matter how
imposing, no figure could erase that feeling entirely. Papaw had come
the closest, but he clearly hadn’t succeeded all the way, and now he was
gone.</p>
<p>Papaw died on a Tuesday, and I know this because when Mom’s
boyfriend, Matt, drove me to a local diner the next morning to pick up
food for the whole family, the Lynyrd Skynyrd song “Tuesday’s Gone” was
playing on the radio. “But somehow I’ve got to carry on / Tuesday’s gone
with the wind.” That was the moment it really hit me that Papaw was
never coming back. The adults did what people do when a loved one dies:
They planned a funeral, figured out how to pay for it, and hoped that
they did the deceased some justice. We hosted a visitation in Middletown
that Thursday so all the locals could pay their respects, then had a
second visitation in Jackson on Friday before a Saturday funeral. Even
in death, Papaw had one foot in Ohio and another in the holler.</p>
<p>Everyone I cared to see came to the funeral in Jackson—Uncle Jimmy
and his kids, our extended family and friends, and all of the Blanton
men who were still kicking. It occurred to me as I saw these titans of
my family that, for the first eleven or so years of my life, I saw them
during happy times—family reunions and holidays or lazy summers and long
weekends—and in the two most recent years I’d seen them only at
funerals.</p>
<p>At Papaw’s funeral, as at other hillbilly funerals I’ve witnessed,
the preacher invited everyone to stand up and say a few words about the
deceased. As I sat next to Uncle Jimmy in the pew, I sobbed throughout
the hour-long funeral, my eyes so irritated by the end that I could
hardly see. Still, I knew this was it, and that if I didn’t stand up and
speak my piece, I’d regret it for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I thought about a moment nearly a decade earlier that I’d heard about
but didn’t remember. I was four or five, sitting in a church pew for a
great-uncle’s funeral in that same Deaton funeral home in Jackson. We
had just arrived after a long drive from Middletown, and when the
minister asked us to bow our heads and pray, I bowed my head and passed
out. Mamaw’s older brother Uncle Pet lay me on my side with a Bible as a
pillow and thought nothing more of it. I was asleep for what happened
next, but I’ve heard some version of it a hundred times. Even today,
when I see someone who attended that funeral, they tell me about my
hillbilly Mamaw and Papaw.</p>
<p>When I failed to appear in the crowd of mourners leaving the church,
Mamaw and Papaw grew suspicious. There were perverts even in Jackson,
they told me, who wanted to stick sticks up your butt and “blow on your
pecker” as much as the perverts in Ohio or Indiana or California. Papaw
hatched a plan: There were only two exits to Deaton’s, and no one had
driven away yet. Papaw ran to the car and grabbed a .44 Magnum for
himself and a .38 Special for Mamaw. They manned the exits to the
funeral home and checked every car. When they encountered an old friend,
they explained the situation and enlisted help. When they met someone
else, they searched the cars like goddamned DEA agents.</p>
<p>Uncle Pet approached, frustrated that Mamaw and Papaw were holding up
traffic. When they explained, Pet howled with laughter: “He’s asleep in
the church pew, let me show you.” After they found me, they allowed
traffic to flow freely once again.</p>
<p>I thought about Papaw buying me a BB gun with a mounted scope. He
placed the gun on his workbench with a vise to hold it in place and
fired repeatedly at a target. After each shot, we adjusted the scope,
aligning the crosshairs with where the BB impacted the target. And then
he taught me how to shoot—how to focus on the sights and not the target,
how to exhale before pulling the trigger. Years later, our marine boot
camp marksmanship instructors would tell us that the kids who already
“knew” how to shoot performed the worst, because they’d learned improper
fundamentals. That was true with one exception: me. From Papaw, I had
learned excellent fundamentals, and I qualified with an M16 rifle as an
expert, the highest category, with one of the highest scores in my
entire platoon.</p>
<p>Papaw was gruff to the point of absurdity. To every suggestion or
behavior he didn’t like, Papaw had one reply: “Bullshit.” That was
everyone’s cue to shut the hell up. His hobby was cars: He loved buying,
trading, and fixing them. One day not long after Papaw quit drinking,
Uncle Jimmy came home to find him fixing an old automobile on the
street. “He was cussing up a storm. ‘These goddamned Japanese cars,
cheap pieces of shit. What a stupid motherfucker who made this part.’ I
just listened to him, not knowing a single person was around, and he
just kept carrying on and complaining. I thought he sounded miserable.”
Uncle Jimmy had recently started working and was eager to spend his
money to help his dad out. So he offered to take the car to a shop and
get it fixed. The suggestion caught Papaw completely off guard. “What?
Why?” he asked innocently. “I love fixing cars.”</p>
<p>Papaw had a beer belly and a chubby face but skinny arms and legs. He
never apologized with words. While helping Aunt Wee move across the
country, she admonished him for his earlier alcoholism and asked why
they rarely had the chance to talk. “Well, talk now. We’ve got all
fucking day in the car together.” But he did apologize with deeds: The
rare times when he lost his temper with me were always followed with a
new toy or a trip to the ice cream parlor.</p>
<p>Papaw was a terrifying hillbilly made for a different time and place.
During that cross-country drive with Aunt Wee, they stopped at a highway
rest stop in the early morning. Aunt Wee decided to comb her hair and
brush her teeth and thus spent more time in the ladies’ room than Papaw
thought reasonable. He kicked open the door holding a loaded revolver,
like a character in a Liam Neeson movie. He was sure, he explained, that
she was being raped by some pervert. Years later, after Aunt Wee’s dog
growled at her infant baby, Papaw told her husband, Dan, that unless he
got rid of the dog, Papaw would feed it a steak marinated in antifreeze.
He wasn’t joking: Three decades earlier, he had made the same promise to
a neighbor after a dog nearly bit my mom. A week later that dog was
dead. In that funeral home I thought about these things, too.</p>
<p>Most of all I thought about Papaw and me. I thought about the hours
we spent practicing increasingly complex math problems. He taught me
that lack of knowledge and lack of intelligence were not the same. The
former could be remedied with a little patience and a lot of hard work.
And the latter? “Well, I guess you’re up shit creek without a
paddle.”</p>
<p>I thought about how Papaw would get on the ground with me and Aunt
Wee’s baby girls and play with us like a child. Despite his “bullshits”
and his grouchiness, he never met a hug or a kiss that he didn’t
welcome. He bought Lindsay a crappy car and fixed it up, and after she
wrecked it, he bought her another one and fixed that one up, too, just
so she didn’t feel like she “came from nothing.” I thought about losing
my temper with Mom or Lindsay or Mamaw, and how those were among the few
times Papaw ever showed a mean streak, because, as he once told me, “the
measure of a man is how he treats the women in his family.” His wisdom
came from experience, from his own earlier failures with treating the
women in his family well.</p>
<p>I stood up in that funeral home, resolved to tell everyone just how
important he was. “I never had a dad,” I explained. “But Papaw was
always there for me, and he taught me the things that men needed to
know.” Then I spoke the sum of his influence on my life: “He was the
best dad that anyone could ever ask for.”</p>
<p>After the funeral, a number of people told me that they appreciated
my bravery and courage. Mom was not among them, which struck me as odd.
When I located her in the crowd, she seemed trapped in some sort of
trance: saying little, even to those who approached her; her movements
slow and her body slouched.</p>
<p>Mamaw, too, seemed out of sorts. Kentucky was usually the one place
where she was completely in her element. In Middletown, she could never
truly be herself. At Perkins, our favorite breakfast spot, Mamaw’s mouth
would sometimes earn a request from the manager that she keep her voice
down or watch her language. “That fucker,” she’d mutter under her
breath, chastened and uncomfortable. But at Bill’s Family Diner, the
only restaurant in Jackson worth sitting down at for a meal, she’d
scream at the kitchen staff to “hurry the hell up” and they’d laugh and
say, “Okay, Bonnie.” Then she’d look at me and tell me, “You know I’m
just fucking with them, right? They know I’m not a mean old bitch.”</p>
<p>In Jackson, among old friends and real hillbillies, she needed no
filter. At her brother’s funeral a few years earlier, Mamaw and her
niece Denise convinced themselves that one of the pallbearers was a
pervert, so they broke into his funeral home office and searched through
his belongings. They found an extensive magazine collection, including a
few issues of Beaver Hunt (a periodical that I can assure you has
nothing to do with aquatic mammals). Mamaw found it hilarious. “Fucking
Beaver Hunt!” she’d roar. “Who comes up with this shit?” She and Denise
hatched a plot to take the magazines home and mail them to the
pallbearer’s wife. After a short deliberation, she changed her mind.
“With my luck,” she told me, “we’ll get in a crash on the way back to
Ohio and the police will find these damned things in my trunk. I’ll be
damned if I’m going to go out with everyone thinking I was a lesbian—and
a perverted one at that!” So they threw the magazines away to “teach
that pervert a lesson” and never spoke of it again. This side of Mamaw
rarely showed itself outside of Jackson.</p>
<p>Deaton’s funeral home in Jackson—where she’d stolen those Beaver
Hunts—was organized like a church. In the center of the building was a
main sanctuary flanked by larger rooms with couches and tables. On the
other two sides were hallways with exits to a few smaller rooms—offices
for staff, a tiny kitchen, and bathrooms. I’ve spent much of my life in
that tiny funeral home, saying goodbye to aunts and uncles and cousins
and great-grandparents. And whether she went to Deaton’s to bury an old
friend, a brother, or her beloved mother, Mamaw greeted every guest,
laughed loudly, and cursed proudly.</p>
<p>So it was a surprise to me when, during Papaw’s visitation, I went
searching for comfort and found Mamaw alone in a corner of the funeral
home, recharging batteries that I never knew could go empty. She stared
blankly at the floor, her fire replaced with something unfamiliar. I
knelt before her and laid my head in her lap and said nothing. At that
moment, I realized that Mamaw was not invincible.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it’s clear that there was more than grief to both
Mamaw’s and Mom’s behavior. Lindsay, Matt, and Mamaw did their best to
hide it from me. Mamaw forbade me to stay at Mom’s, under the ruse that
Mamaw needed me with her as she grieved. Perhaps they hoped to give me a
little space to mourn Papaw. I don’t know.</p>
<p>I didn’t see at first that something had veered off course. Papaw was
dead, and everyone processed it differently. Lindsay spent a lot of time
with her friends and was always on the move. I stayed as close to Mamaw
as possible and read the Bible a lot. Mom slept more than usual, and I
figured this was her way of coping. At home, she lacked even a modicum
of temper control. Lindsay failed to do the dishes properly, or forgot
to take out the dog, and Mom’s anger poured out: “My dad was the only
one who really understood me!” she’d scream. “I’ve lost him, and you’re
not making this any easier!” Mom had always had a temper, though, so I
dismissed even this.</p>
<p>Mom seemed bothered that anyone but her was grieving. Aunt Wee’s
grief was unjustified, because Mom and Papaw had a special bond. So,
too, was Mamaw’s, for she didn’t even like Papaw and chose not to live
under the same roof. Lindsay and I needed to get over ourselves, for it
was Mom’s father, not ours, who had just died. The first indication that
our lives were about to change came one morning when I woke and strolled
over to Mom’s house, where I knew Lindsay and Mom were sleeping. I went
first to Lindsay’s room, but she was asleep in my room instead. I knelt
beside her, woke her up, and she hugged me tightly. After a little
while, she said earnestly, “We’ll get through this, J.”—that was her
nickname for me—“I promise.” I still have no idea why she slept in my
room that night, but I would soon learn what she promised we’d get
through.</p>
<p>A few days after the funeral, I walked onto Mamaw’s front porch,
looked down the street, and saw an incredible commotion. Mom was
standing in a bath towel in her front yard, screaming at the only people
who truly loved her: to Matt, “You’re a fucking loser nobody”; to
Lindsay, “You’re a selfish bitch, he was my dad, not yours, so stop
acting like you just lost your father”; to Tammy, her unbelievably kind
friend who was secretly gay, “The only reason you act like my friend is
because you want to fuck me.” I ran over and begged Mom to calm down,
but by then a police cruiser was already on the scene. I arrived on the
front porch as a police officer grabbed Mom’s shoulders and she
collapsed on the ground, struggling and kicking. Then the officer
grabbed Mom and carried her to the cruiser, and she fought the whole
way. There was blood on the porch, and someone said that she had tried
to cut her wrists. I don’t think the officer arrested her, though I
don’t know what happened. Mamaw arrived on the scene and took Lindsay
and me with her. I remember thinking that if Papaw were here, he would
know what to do.</p>
<p>Papaw’s death cast light upon something that had previously lurked in
the shadows. Only a kid could have missed the writing on the wall, I
suppose. A year earlier, Mom had lost her job at Middletown Hospital
after Rollerblading through the emergency room. At the time I saw Mom’s
bizarre behavior as the consequence of her divorce from Bob. Similarly,
Mamaw’s occasional references to Mom “getting loaded” seemed like random
comments of a woman known for her willingness to say anything, not a
diagnosis of a deteriorating reality. Not long after Mom lost her job,
during my trip to California, I heard from her just once. I had no idea
that, behind the scenes, the adults—meaning Mamaw on the one hand and
Uncle Jimmy and his wife, Aunt Donna, on the other—were debating whether
I should move permanently to California.</p>
<p>Mom flailing and screaming in the street was the culmination of the
things I hadn’t seen. She’d begun taking prescription narcotics not long
after we moved to Preble County. I believe the problem started with a
legitimate prescription, but soon enough, Mom was stealing from her
patients and getting so high that turning an emergency room into a
skating rink seemed like a good idea. Papaw’s death turned a
semi-functioning addict into a woman unable to follow the basic norms of
adult behavior.</p>
<p>In this way, Papaw’s death permanently altered the trajectory of our
family. Before his death, I had settled into the chaotic but happy
routine of splitting time between Mom’s and Mamaw’s. Boyfriends came and
went, Mom had good days and bad, but I always had an escape route. With
Papaw gone and Mom in rehab at the Cincinnati Center for Addiction
Treatment—or “the CAT house,” as we called it—I began to feel myself a
burden. Though she never said anything to make me feel unwanted, Mamaw’s
life had been a constant struggle: From the poverty of the holler to
Papaw’s abuse, from Aunt Wee’s teenage marriage to Mom’s rap sheet,
Mamaw had spent the better part of her seven decades managing crises.
And now, when most people her age were enjoying the fruits of
retirement, she was raising two teenage grandchildren. Without Papaw to
help her, that burden seemed twice as heavy. In the months after Papaw’s
death, I remembered the woman I found in an isolated corner of Deaton’s
funeral home and couldn’t shake the feeling that, no matter what aura of
strength Mamaw projected, that other woman lived somewhere inside
her.</p>
<p>So instead of retreating to Mamaw’s house, or calling her every time
problems arose with Mom, I relied on Lindsay and on myself. Lindsay was
a recent high school graduate, and I had just started seventh grade, but
we made it work. Sometimes Matt or Tammy brought us food, but we largely
fended for ourselves: Hamburger Helper, TV dinners, Pop-Tarts, and
breakfast cereal. I’m not sure who paid the bills (probably Mamaw). We
didn’t have a lot of structure—Lindsay once came home from work to find
me hanging out with a couple of her friends, all of us drunk—but in some
ways we didn’t need it. When Lindsay learned that I got the beer from a
friend of hers, she didn’t lose her cool or laugh at the indulgence; she
kicked everyone out and then lectured me on substance abuse.</p>
<p>We saw Mamaw often, and she asked about us constantly. But we both
enjoyed the independence, and I think we enjoyed the feeling that we
burdened no one except perhaps each other. Lindsay and I had grown so
good at managing crises, so emotionally stoic even as the very planet
seemed to lose its cool, that taking care of ourselves seemed easy. No
matter how much we loved Mom, our lives were easier with one less person
to care for.</p>
<p>Did we struggle? Certainly. We received one letter from the school
district informing us that I had collected so many unexcused absences
that my parents might be summoned before the school or even prosecuted
by the city. We found this letter hilarious: One of my parents had
already faced a prosecution of sorts and hardly possessed any
walking-around liberty, while the other was sufficiently off the grid
that “summoning” him would require some serious detective work. We also
found it frightening: Without a legal guardian around to sign the
letter, we didn’t know what the hell to do. But as we had with other
challenges, we improvised. Lindsay forged Mom’s signature, and the
school district stopped sending letters home.</p>
<p>On designated weekdays and weekends, we visited our mother at the CAT
house. Between the hills of Kentucky, Mamaw and her guns, and Mom’s
outbursts, I thought that I had seen it all. But Mom’s newest problem
exposed me to the underworld of American addiction. Wednesdays were
always dedicated to a group activity—some type of training for the
family. All of the addicts and their families sat in a large room with
each family assigned to an individual table, engaged in some discussion
meant to teach us about addiction and its triggers. In one session, Mom
explained that she used drugs to escape the stress of paying bills and
to dull the pain of Papaw’s death. In another, Lindsay and I learned
that standard sibling conflict made it more difficult for Mom to resist
temptation.</p>
<p>These sessions provoked little more than arguments and raw emotion,
which I suppose was their purpose. On the nights when we sat in that
giant hall with other families—all of whom were either black or
Southern-accented whites like us—we heard screaming and fighting,
children telling their parents that they hated them, sobbing parents
begging forgiveness in one breath and then blaming their families in the
next. It was there that I first heard Lindsay tell Mom how she resented
having to play the caretaker in the wake of Papaw’s death instead of
grieving for him, how she hated watching me grow attached to some
boyfriend of Mom’s only to see him walk out on us. Perhaps it was the
setting, or perhaps it was the fact that Lindsay was almost eighteen,
but as my sister confronted my mother, I began to see my sister as the
real adult. And our routine at home only enhanced her stature.</p>
<p>Mom’s rehab proceeded apace, and her condition apparently improved
with time. Sundays were designated as unstructured family time: We
couldn’t take Mom off-site, but we were able to eat and watch TV and
talk as normal. Sundays were usually happy, though Mom did angrily chide
us during one visit because our relationship with Mamaw had grown too
close. “I’m your mother, not her,” she told us. I realized that Mom had
begun to regret the seeds she’d sown with Lindsay and me.</p>
<p>When Mom came home a few months later, she brought a new vocabulary
along with her. She regularly recited the Serenity Prayer, a staple of
addiction circles in which the faithful ask God for the “serenity to
accept the things [they] cannot change.” Drug addiction was a disease,
and just as I wouldn’t judge a cancer patient for a tumor, so I
shouldn’t judge a narcotics addict for her behavior. At thirteen, I
found this patently absurd, and Mom and I often argued over whether her
newfound wisdom was scientific truth or an excuse for people whose
decisions destroyed a family. Oddly enough, it’s probably both: Research
does reveal a genetic disposition to substance abuse, but those who
believe their addiction is a disease show less of an inclination to
resist it. Mom was telling herself the truth, but the truth was not
setting her free.</p>
<p>I didn’t believe in any of the slogans or sentiments, but I did
believe she was trying. Addiction treatment seemed to give Mom a sense
of purpose, and it gave us something to bond over. I read what I could
on her “disease” and even made a habit of attending some of her
Narcotics Anonymous meetings, which proceeded precisely as you’d expect:
a depressing conference room, a dozen or so chairs, and a bunch of
strangers sitting in a circle, introducing themselves as “Bob, and I’m
an addict.” I thought that if I participated, she might actually get
better.</p>
<p>At one meeting a man walked in a few minutes late, smelling like a
garbage can. His matted hair and dirty clothes evidenced a life on the
streets, a truth he confirmed as soon as he opened his mouth. “My kids
won’t speak to me; no one will,” he told us. “I scrounge together what
money I can and spend it on smack. Tonight I couldn’t find any money or
any smack, so I came in here because it looked warm.” The organizer
asked if he’d be willing to try giving up the drugs for more than one
night, and the man answered with admirable candor: “I could say yes, but
honestly, probably not. I’ll probably be back at it tomorrow night.”</p>
<p>I never saw that man again. Before he left, someone did ask him where
he was from. “Well, I’ve lived here in Hamilton for most of my life. But
I was born down in eastern Kentucky, Owsley County.” At the time, I
didn’t know enough about Kentucky geography to tell the man that he had
been born no more than twenty miles from my grandparents’ childhood
home.</p>
