<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>Like most small children, I learned my home address so that if I got
lost, I could tell a grown-up where to take me. In kindergarten, when
the teacher asked me where I lived, I could recite the address without
skipping a beat, even though my mother changed addresses frequently, for
reasons I never understood as a child. Still, I always distinguished “my
address” from “my home.” My address was where I spent most of my time
with my mother and sister, wherever that might be. But my home never
changed: my great-grandmother’s house, in the holler, in Jackson,
Kentucky.</p>
<p>Jackson is a small town of about six thousand in the heart of
southeastern Kentucky’s coal country. Calling it a town is a bit
charitable: There’s a courthouse, a few restaurants—almost all of them
fast-food chains—and a few other shops and stores. Most of the people
live in the mountains surrounding Kentucky Highway 15, in trailer parks,
in government-subsidized housing, in small farmhouses, and in mountain
homesteads like the one that served as the backdrop for the fondest
memories of my childhood.</p>
<p>Jacksonians say hello to everyone, willingly skip their favorite
pastimes to dig a stranger’s car out of the snow, and—without
exception—stop their cars, get out, and stand at attention every time a
funeral motorcade drives past. It was that latter practice that made me
aware of something special about Jackson and its people. Why, I’d ask my
grandma—whom we all called Mamaw—did everyone stop for the passing
hearse? “Because, honey, we’re hill people. And we respect our
dead.”</p>
<p>My grandparents left Jackson in the late 1940s and raised their
family in Middletown, Ohio, where I later grew up. But until I was
twelve, I spent my summers and much of the rest of my time back in
Jackson. I’d visit along with Mamaw, who wanted to see friends and
family, ever conscious that time was shortening the list of her favorite
people. And as time wore on, we made our trips for one reason above all:
to take care of Mamaw’s mother, whom we called Mamaw Blanton (to
distinguish her, though somewhat confusingly, from Mamaw). We stayed
with Mamaw Blanton in the house where she’d lived since before her
husband left to fight the Japanese in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Mamaw Blanton’s house was my favorite place in the world, though it
was neither large nor luxurious. The house had three bedrooms. In the
front were a small porch, a porch swing, and a large yard that stretched
into a mountain on one side and to the head of the holler on the other.
Though Mamaw Blanton owned some property, most of it was uninhabitable
foliage. There wasn’t a backyard to speak of, though there was a
beautiful mountainside of rock and tree. There was always the holler,
and the creek that ran alongside it; those were backyard enough. The
kids all slept in a single upstairs room: a squad bay of about a dozen
beds where my cousins and I played late into the night until our
irritated grandma would frighten us into sleep.</p>
<p>The surrounding mountains were paradise to a child, and I spent much
of my time terrorizing the Appalachian fauna: No turtle, snake, frog,
fish, or squirrel was safe. I’d run around with my cousins, unaware of
the ever-present poverty or Mamaw Blanton’s deteriorating health.</p>
<p>At a deep level, Jackson was the one place that belonged to me, my
sister, and Mamaw. I loved Ohio, but it was full of painful memories. In
Jackson, I was the grandson of the toughest woman anyone knew and the
most skilled auto mechanic in town; in Ohio, I was the abandoned son of
a man I hardly knew and a woman I wished I didn’t. Mom visited Kentucky
only for the annual family reunion or the occasional funeral, and when
she did, Mamaw made sure she brought none of the drama. In Jackson,
there would be no screaming, no fighting, no beating up on my sister,
and especially “no men,” as Mamaw would say. Mamaw hated Mom’s various
love interests and allowed none of them in Kentucky.</p>
<p>In Ohio, I had grown especially skillful at navigating various father
figures. With Steve, a midlife-crisis sufferer with an earring to prove
it, I pretended earrings were cool—so much so that he thought it
appropriate to pierce my ear, too. With Chip, an alcoholic police
officer who saw my earring as a sign of “girlieness,” I had thick skin
and loved police cars. With Ken, an odd man who proposed to Mom three
days into their relationship, I was a kind brother to his two children.
But none of these things were really true. I hated earrings, I hated
police cars, and I knew that Ken’s children would be out of my life by
the next year. In Kentucky, I didn’t have to pretend to be someone I
wasn’t, because the only men in my life—my grandmother’s brothers and
brothers-in-law—already knew me. Did I want to make them proud? Of
course I did, but not because I pretended to like them; I genuinely
loved them.</p>
<p>The oldest and meanest of the Blanton men was Uncle Teaberry,
nicknamed for his favorite flavor of chewing gum. Uncle Teaberry, like
his father, served in the navy during World War II. He died when I was
four, so I have only two real memories of him. In the first, I’m running
for my life, and Teaberry is close behind with a switchblade, assuring
me that he’ll feed my right ear to the dogs if he catches me. I leap
into Mamaw Blanton’s arms, and the terrifying game is over. But I know
that I loved him, because my second memory is of throwing such a fit
over not being allowed to visit him on his deathbed that my grandma was
forced to don a hospital robe and smuggle me in. I remember clinging to
her underneath that hospital robe, but I don’t remember saying
goodbye.</p>
<p>Uncle Pet came next. Uncle Pet was a tall man with a biting wit and a
raunchy sense of humor. The most economically successful of the Blanton
crew, Uncle Pet left home early and started some timber and construction
businesses that made him enough money to race horses in his spare time.
He seemed the nicest of the Blanton men, with the smooth charm of a
successful businessman. But that charm masked a fierce temper. Once,
when a truck driver delivered supplies to one of Uncle Pet’s businesses,
he told my old hillbilly uncle, “Off-load this now, you son of a bitch.”
Uncle Pet took the comment literally: “When you say that, you’re calling
my dear old mother a bitch, so I’d kindly ask you speak more carefully.”
When the driver—nicknamed Big Red because of his size and hair
color—repeated the insult, Uncle Pet did what any rational business
owner would do: He pulled the man from his truck, beat him unconscious,
and ran an electric saw up and down his body. Big Red nearly bled to
death but was rushed to the hospital and survived. Uncle Pet never went
to jail, though. Apparently, Big Red was also an Appalachian man, and he
refused to speak to the police about the incident or press charges. He
knew what it meant to insult a man’s mother.</p>
<p>Uncle David may have been the only one of Mamaw’s brothers to care
little for that honor culture. An old rebel with long, flowing hair and
a longer beard, he loved everything but rules, which might explain why,
when I found his giant marijuana plant in the backyard of the old
homestead, he didn’t try to explain it away. Shocked, I asked Uncle
David what he planned to do with illegal drugs. So he got some cigarette
papers and a lighter and showed me. I was twelve. I knew if Mamaw ever
found out, she’d kill him.</p>
<p>I feared this because, according to family lore, Mamaw had nearly
killed a man. When she was around twelve, Mamaw walked outside to see
two men loading the family’s cow—a prized possession in a world without
running water—into the back of a truck. She ran inside, grabbed a rifle,
and fired a few rounds. One of the men collapsed—the result of a shot to
the leg—and the other jumped into the truck and squealed away. The
would-be thief could barely crawl, so Mamaw approached him, raised the
business end of her rifle to the man’s head, and prepared to finish the
job. Luckily for him, Uncle Pet intervened. Mamaw’s first confirmed kill
would have to wait for another day.</p>
<p>Even knowing what a pistol-packing lunatic Mamaw was, I find this
story hard to believe. I polled members of my family, and about half had
never heard the story. The part I believe is that she would have
murdered the man if someone hadn’t stopped her. She loathed disloyalty,
and there was no greater disloyalty than class betrayal. Each time
someone stole a bike from our porch (three times, by my count), or broke
into her car and took the loose change, or stole a delivery, she’d tell
me, like a general giving his troops marching orders, “There is nothing
lower than the poor stealing from the poor. It’s hard enough as it is.
We sure as hell don’t need to make it even harder on each other.”</p>
<p>Youngest of all the Blanton boys was Uncle Gary. He was the baby of
the family and one of the sweetest men I knew. Uncle Gary left home
young and built a successful roofing business in Indiana. A good husband
and a better father, he’d always say to me, “We’re proud of you, ole
Jaydot,” causing me to swell with pride. He was my favorite, the only
Blanton brother not to threaten me with a kick in the ass or a detached
ear.</p>
<p>My grandma also had two younger sisters, Betty and Rose, whom I loved
each very much, but I was obsessed with the Blanton men. I would sit
among them and beg them to tell and retell their stories. These men were
the gatekeepers to the family’s oral tradition, and I was their best
student.</p>
<p>Most of this tradition was far from child appropriate. Almost all of
it involved the kind of violence that should land someone in jail. Much
of it centered on how the county in which Jackson was
situated—Breathitt—earned its alliterative nickname, “Bloody Breathitt.”
There were many explanations, but they all had one theme: The people of
Breathitt hated certain things, and they didn’t need the law to snuff
them out.</p>
<p>One of the most common tales of Breathitt’s gore revolved around an
older man in town who was accused of raping a young girl. Mamaw told me
that, days before his trial, the man was found facedown in a local lake
with sixteen bullet wounds in his back. The authorities never
investigated the murder, and the only mention of the incident appeared
in the local newspaper on the morning his body was discovered. In an
admirable display of journalistic pith, the paper reported: “Man found
dead. Foul play expected.” “Foul play expected?” my grandmother would
roar. “You’re goddamned right. Bloody Breathitt got to that son of a
bitch.”</p>
<p>Or there was that day when Uncle Teaberry overheard a young man state
a desire to “eat her panties,” a reference to his sister’s (my Mamaw’s)
undergarments. Uncle Teaberry drove home, retrieved a pair of Mamaw’s
underwear, and forced the young man—at knifepoint—to consume the
clothing.</p>
<p>Some people may conclude that I come from a clan of lunatics. But the
stories made me feel like hillbilly royalty, because these were classic
good-versus-evil stories, and my people were on the right side. My
people were extreme, but extreme in the service of something—defending a
sister’s honor or ensuring that a criminal paid for his crimes. The
Blanton men, like the tomboy Blanton sister whom I called Mamaw, were
enforcers of hillbilly justice, and to me, that was the very best
kind.</p>
<p>Despite their virtues, or perhaps because of them, the Blanton men
were full of vice. A few of them left a trail of neglected children,
cheated wives, or both. And I didn’t even know them that well: I saw
them only at large family reunions or during the holidays. Still, I
loved and worshipped them. I once overheard Mamaw tell her mother that I
loved the Blanton men because so many father figures had come and gone,
but the Blanton men were always there. There’s definitely a kernel of
truth to that. But more than anything, the Blanton men were the living
embodiment of the hills of Kentucky. I loved them because I loved
Jackson.</p>
<p>As I grew older, my obsession with the Blanton men faded into
appreciation, just as my view of Jackson as some sort of paradise
matured. I will always think of Jackson as my home. It is unfathomably
beautiful: When the leaves turn in October, it seems as if every
mountain in town is on fire. But for all its beauty, and for all the
fond memories, Jackson is a very harsh place. Jackson taught me that
“hill people” and “poor people” usually meant the same thing. At Mamaw
Blanton’s, we’d eat scrambled eggs, ham, fried potatoes, and biscuits
for breakfast; fried bologna sandwiches for lunch; and soup beans and
cornbread for dinner. Many Jackson families couldn’t say the same, and I
knew this because, as I grew older, I overheard the adults speak about
the pitiful children in the neighborhood who were starving and how the
town could help them. Mamaw shielded me from the worst of Jackson, but
you can keep reality at bay only so long.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to Jackson, I made sure to stop at Mamaw Blanton’s
old house, now inhabited by my second cousin Rick and his family. We
talked about how things had changed. “Drugs have come in,” Rick told me.
“And nobody’s interested in holding down a job.” I hoped my beloved
holler had escaped the worst, so I asked Rick’s boys to take me on a
walk. All around I saw the worst signs of Appalachian poverty.</p>
<p>Some of it was as heartbreaking as it was cliché: decrepit shacks
rotting away, stray dogs begging for food, and old furniture strewn on
the lawns. Some of it was far more troubling. While passing a small
two-bedroom house, I noticed a frightened set of eyes looking at me from
behind the curtains of a bedroom window. My curiosity piqued, I looked
closer and counted no fewer than eight pairs of eyes, all looking at me
from three windows with an unsettling combination of fear and longing.
On the front porch was a thin man, no older than thirty-five, apparently
the head of the household. Several ferocious, malnourished, chained-up
dogs protected the furniture strewn about the barren front yard. When I
asked Rick’s son what the young father did for a living, he told me the
man had no job and was proud of it. But, he added, “they’re mean, so we
just try to avoid them.”</p>
<p>That house might be extreme, but it represents much about the lives
of hill people in Jackson. Nearly a third of the town lives in poverty,
a figure that includes about half of Jackson’s children. And that
doesn’t count the large majority of Jacksonians who hover around the
poverty line. An epidemic of prescription drug addiction has taken root.
The public schools are so bad that the state of Kentucky recently seized
control. Nevertheless, parents send their children to these schools
because they have little extra money, and the high school fails to send
its students to college with alarming consistency. The people are
physically unhealthy, and without government assistance they lack
treatment for the most basic problems. Most important, they’re mean
about it—they will hesitate to open their lives up to others for the
simple reason that they don’t wish to be judged.</p>
<p>In 2009, ABC News ran a news report about Appalachian America,
highlighting a phenomenon known locally as “Mountain Dew mouth”: painful
dental problems in young children, generally caused by too much sugary
soda. In its broadcast, ABC featured a litany of stories about
Appalachian children confronting poverty and deprivation. The news
report was widely watched in the region but met with utter scorn. The
consistent reaction: This is none of your damn business. “This has to be
the most offensive thing I have ever heard and you should all be
ashamed, ABC included,” wrote one commenter online. Another added: “You
should be ashamed of yourself for reinforcing old, false stereotypes and
not giving a more accurate picture of Appalachia. This is an opinion
shared among many in the actual rural towns of the mountains that I have
met.”</p>
<p>I knew this because my cousin took to Facebook to silence the
critics—noting that only by admitting the region’s problems could people
hope to change them. Amber is uniquely positioned to comment on the
problems of Appalachia: Unlike me, she spent her entire childhood in
Jackson. She was an academic star in high school and later earned a
college degree, the first in her nuclear family to do so. She saw the
worst of Jackson’s poverty firsthand and overcame it.</p>
<p>The angry reaction supports the academic literature on Appalachian
Americans. In a December 2000 paper, sociologists Carol A. Markstrom,
Sheila K. Marshall, and Robin J. Tryon found that avoidance and
wishful-thinking forms of coping “significantly predicted resiliency”
among Appalachian teens. Their paper suggests that hillbillies learn
from an early age to deal with uncomfortable truths by avoiding them, or
by pretending better truths exist. This tendency might make for
psychological resilience, but it also makes it hard for Appalachians to
look at themselves honestly.</p>
<p>We tend to overstate and to understate, to glorify the good and
ignore the bad in ourselves. This is why the folks of Appalachia reacted
strongly to an honest look at some of its most impoverished people. It’s
why I worshipped the Blanton men, and it’s why I spent the first
eighteen years of my life pretending that everything in the world was a
problem except me.</p>
<p>The truth is hard, and the hardest truths for hill people are the
ones they must tell about themselves. Jackson is undoubtedly full of the
nicest people in the world; it is also full of drug addicts and at least
one man who can find the time to make eight children but can’t find the
time to support them. It is unquestionably beautiful, but its beauty is
obscured by the environmental waste and loose trash that scatters the
countryside. Its people are hardworking, except of course for the many
food stamp recipients who show little interest in honest work. Jackson,
like the Blanton men, is full of contradictions.</p>
<p>Things have gotten so bad that last summer, after my cousin Mike
buried his mother, his thoughts turned immediately to selling her house.
“I can’t live here, and I can’t leave it untended,” he said. “The drug
addicts will ransack it.” Jackson has always been poor, but it was never
a place where a man feared leaving his mother’s home alone. The place I
call home has taken a worrisome turn.</p>
<p>If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow
concern of backwoods hollers, a glimpse at my own life reveals that
Jackson’s plight has gone mainstream. Thanks to the massive migration
from the poorer regions of Appalachia to places like Ohio, Michigan,
Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, hillbilly values spread widely
along with hillbilly people. Indeed, Kentucky transplants and their
children are so prominent in Middletown, Ohio (where I grew up), that as
kids we derisively called it “Middletucky.”</p>
<p>My grandparents uprooted themselves from the real Kentucky and
relocated to Middletucky in search of a better life, and in some ways
they found it. In other ways, they never really escaped. The drug
addiction that plagues Jackson has afflicted their older daughter for
her entire adult life. Mountain Dew mouth may be especially bad in
Jackson, but my grandparents fought it in Middletown, too: I was nine
months old the first time Mamaw saw my mother put Pepsi in my bottle.
Virtuous fathers are in short supply in Jackson, but they are equally
scarce in the lives of my grandparents’ grandchildren. People have
struggled to get out of Jackson for decades; now they struggle to escape
Middletown.</p>
<p>If the problems start in Jackson, it is not entirely clear where they
end. What I realized many years ago, watching that funeral procession
with Mamaw, is that I am a hill person. So is much of America’s white
working class. And we hill people aren’t doing very well.</p>
