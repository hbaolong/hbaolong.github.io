<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>What I remember most is the fucking spiders. Really big ones, like
tarantulas or something. I stood at a window of one of those sleazy
roadside motels, separated from a woman (who certainly hadn’t majored in
hospitality management) by a thick pane of glass. The light from her
office illuminated a few spiderwebs suspended between the building and
the makeshift sun blocker that seemed primed to collapse on top of me.
On each web was at least one giant spider, and I thought that if I
looked away from them for too long, one of those ghastly creatures would
jump on my face and suck my blood. I’m not even afraid of spiders, but
these things were big.</p>
<p>I wasn’t supposed to be here. I’d structured my entire life to avoid
just these types of places. When I thought of leaving my hometown, of
“getting out,” it was from this sort of place that I wanted to escape.
It was past midnight. The streetlight revealed the silhouette of a man
sitting halfway in his truck—the door open, his feet dangling to the
side—with the unmistakable form of a hypodermic needle sticking from his
arm. I should have been shocked, but this was Middletown, after all.
Just a few weeks earlier, the police had discovered a woman passed out
at the local car wash, a bag of heroin and a spoon in the passenger
seat, the needle still protruding from her arm.</p>
<p>The woman running the hotel that night was the most pitiful sight of
all. She might have been forty, but everything about her—from the long,
gray, greasy hair, the mouth empty of teeth, and the frown that she wore
like a millstone—screamed old age. This woman had lived a hard life. Her
voice sounded like a small child’s, even a toddler’s. It was meek,
barely audible, and very sad.</p>
<p>I gave the woman my credit card, and she was clearly unprepared.
“Normally, people pay cash,” she explained. I told her, “Yeah, but like
I said on the phone, I’m going to pay with a credit card. I can run to
an ATM if you’d prefer.” “Oh, I’m sorry, I guess I forgot. But it’s
okay, we’ve got one of those machines around here somewhere.” So she
retrieved one of those ancient card-swiping machines—the kind that
imprints the card’s information on a yellow slip of paper. When I handed
her the card, her eyes seemed to plead with me, as if she were a
prisoner in her own life. “Enjoy your stay,” she said, which struck me
as an odd instruction. I had told her on the phone not an hour earlier
that the room wasn’t for me, it was for my homeless mother. “Okay,” I
said. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>I was a recent graduate of Yale Law School, a former editor of the
prestigious Yale Law Journal, and a member of the bar in good standing.
Just two months earlier, Usha and I were married on a beautiful day in
Eastern Kentucky. My entire family showed up for the occasion, and we
both changed our name to Vance—giving me, finally, the same name as the
family to which I belonged. I had a nice job, a recently purchased home,
a loving relationship, and a happy life in a city I loved—Cincinnati.
Usha and I had returned there for a year after law school for one-year
clerkships and had built a home with our two dogs. I was upwardly
mobile. I had made it. I had achieved the American Dream.</p>
<p>Or at least that’s how it looked to an outsider. But upward mobility
is never clean-cut, and the world I left always finds a way to reel me
back in. I don’t know the precise chain of events that led me to that
hotel, but I knew the stuff that mattered. Mom had begun using again.
She’d stolen some family heirlooms from her fifth husband to buy drugs
(prescription opiates, I think), and he’d kicked her out of the house in
response. They were divorcing, and she had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>I’d sworn to myself that I’d never help Mom again, but the person who
made that oath to himself had changed. I was exploring, however
uneasily, the Christian faith that I’d discarded years earlier. I had
learned, for the first time, the extent of Mom’s childhood emotional
wounds. And I had realized that those wounds never truly heal, even for
me. So when I discovered that Mom was in dire straits, I didn’t mutter
insults under my breath and hang up the phone. I offered to help
her.</p>
<p>I tried to call a Middletown hotel and give them my credit card
information. The cost for a week was a hundred and fifty dollars, and I
figured that would give us time to come up with a plan. But they
wouldn’t accept my card over the phone, so at eleven P.M. on a Tuesday
night, I drove from Cincinnati to Middletown (about an hour’s drive each
way) to keep Mom from homelessness.</p>
<p>The plan I developed seemed relatively simple. I’d give Mom enough
money to help her get on her feet. She’d find her own place, save money
to get her nursing license back, and go from there. In the meantime, I’d
monitor her finances to ensure that she stayed clean and on track
financially. It reminded me of the “plans” Mamaw and Papaw used to put
together, but I convinced myself that this time things would be
different.</p>
<p>I’d like to say that helping Mom came easily. That I had made some
peace with my past and was able to fix a problem that had plagued me
since elementary school. That, armed with sympathy and an understanding
of Mom’s childhood, I was able to patiently help Mom deal with her
addiction. But dealing with that sleazy motel was hard. And actively
managing her finances, as I planned to do, required more patience and
time than I had.</p>
<p>By the grace of God, I no longer hide from Mom. But I can’t fix
everything, either. There is room now for both anger at Mom for the life
she chooses and sympathy for the childhood she didn’t. There is room to
help when I can, when finances and emotional reserves allow me to care
in the way Mom needs. But there is also recognition of my own
limitations and my willingness to separate myself from Mom when
engagement means too little money to pay my own bills or too little
patience left over for the people who matter most. That’s the uneasy
truce I’ve struck with myself, and it works for now.</p>
<p>People sometimes ask whether I think there’s anything we can do to
“solve” the problems of my community. I know what they’re looking for: a
magical public policy solution or an innovative government program. But
these problems of family, faith, and culture aren’t like a Rubik’s Cube,
and I don’t think that solutions (as most understand the term) really
exist. A good friend, who worked for a time in the White House and cares
deeply about the plight of the working class, once told me, “The best
way to look at this might be to recognize that you probably can’t fix
these things. They’ll always be around. But maybe you can put your thumb
on the scale a little for the people at the margins.”</p>
<p>There were many thumbs put on my scale. When I look back at my life,
what jumps out is how many variables had to fall in place in order to
give me a chance. There was my grandparents’ constant presence, even
when my mother and stepfather moved far away in an effort to shut them
out. Despite the revolving door of would-be father figures, I was often
surrounded by caring and kind men. Even with her faults, Mom instilled
in me a lifelong love of education and learning. My sister always
protected me, even after I’d physically outgrown her. Dan and Aunt Wee
opened their home when I was too afraid to ask. Long before that, they
were my first real exemplars of a happy and loving marriage. There were
teachers, distant relatives, and friends.</p>
<p>Remove any of these people from the equation, and I’m probably
screwed. Other people who have overcome the odds cite the same sorts of
interventions. Jane Rex runs the transfer students’ office at
Appalachian State University. Like me, she grew up in a working-class
family and was its first member to attend college. She’s also been
married for nearly forty years and has raised three successful kids of
her own. Ask what made a difference in her life, and she’ll tell you
about the stable family that empowered her and gave her a sense of
control over her future. And she’ll tell you about the power of seeing
enough of the world to dream big: “I think you have to have good role
models around you. One of my very good friends, her father was the
president of the bank, so I got to see different things. I knew there
was another life out there, and that exposure gives you something to
dream for.”</p>
<p>My cousin Gail is one of my all-time favorite people: She’s one of
the first of my mom’s generation, the Blanton grandchildren. Gail’s life
is the American Dream personified: a beautiful house, three great kids,
a happy marriage, and a saintly demeanor. Outside of Mamaw Blanton, a
virtual deity in the eyes of us grandkids and great-grandkids, I’ve
never heard anyone else called “the nicest person in the world.” For
Gail, it’s an entirely deserved title.</p>
<p>I assumed that Gail had inherited her storybook life from her
parents. No one’s that nice, I thought, especially not someone who’s
suffered any real adversity. But Gail was a Blanton, and, at heart a
hillbilly, and I should have known that no hillbilly makes it to
adulthood without a few major screwups along the way. Gail’s home life
provided its own emotional baggage. She was seven when her dad walked
out and seventeen when she graduated from high school, planning for
college at Miami University. But there was a catch: “Mom told me I
couldn’t go to college unless I broke up with my boyfriend. So I moved
out the day after graduation, and by August, I was pregnant.”</p>
<p>Almost immediately, her life began to disintegrate. Racial prejudice
bubbled to the surface when she announced that a black baby was joining
the family. Announcements led to arguments, and then one day Gail found
herself without a family. “I didn’t hear from any of our relatives,”
Gail told me. “My mom said she never wanted to hear my name again.”</p>
<p>Given her age and the lack of family support, it’s hardly surprising
that her marriage soon ended. But Gail’s life had grown considerably
more complex: She hadn’t just lost her family, she’d gained a young
daughter who depended entirely on her. “It completely changed my
life—being a mom was my identity. I might have been a hippie, but now I
had rules—no drugs, no alcohol, nothing that was going to lead to social
services taking my baby away.”</p>
<p>So here’s Gail: teenage single mom, no family, little support. A lot
of people would wilt in those circumstances, but the hillbilly took
over. “Dad wasn’t really around,” Gail remembered, “and hadn’t been in
years, and I obviously wasn’t speaking to Mom. But I remember the one
lesson I took from them, and that was that we could do anything we
wanted. I wanted that baby, and I wanted to make it work. So I did it.”
She got a job with a local telephone company, worked her way up the
ladder, and even returned to college. By the time she remarried, she had
hit one hell of a stride. The storybook marriage to her second husband,
Allan, is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Some version of Gail’s story often rears its head where I grew up.
You watch as teenagers find themselves in dire straits, sometimes of
their own making and sometimes not. The statistics are stacked high
against them, and many succumb: to crime or an early death at worst,
domestic strife and welfare dependency at best. But others make it.
There’s Jane Rex. There’s Lindsay, who blossomed in the midst of Mamaw’s
death; Aunt Wee, who put her life on track after ditching an abusive
husband. Each benefited from the same types of experiences in one way or
another. They had a family member they could count on. And they saw—from
a family friend, an uncle, or a work mentor—what was available and what
was possible.</p>
<p>Not long after I began thinking about what might help the American
working class get ahead, a team of economists, including Raj Chetty,
published a groundbreaking study on opportunity in America.
Unsurprisingly, they found that a poor kid’s chances of rising through
the ranks of America’s meritocracy were lower than most of us wanted. By
their metrics, a lot of European countries seemed better than America at
the American Dream. More important, they discovered that opportunity was
not spread evenly over the whole country. In places like Utah, Oklahoma,
and Massachusetts, the American Dream was doing just fine—as good or
better than any other place in the world. It was in the South, the Rust
Belt, and Appalachia where poor kids really struggled. Their findings
surprised a lot of people, but not me. And not anyone who’d spent any
time in these areas.</p>
<p>In a paper analyzing the data, Chetty and his coauthors noted two
important factors that explained the uneven geographic distribution of
opportunity: the prevalence of single parents and income segregation.
Growing up around a lot of single moms and dads and living in a place
where most of your neighbors are poor really narrows the realm of
possibilities. It means that unless you have a Mamaw and Papaw to make
sure you stay the course, you might never make it out. It means that you
don’t have people to show you by example what happens when you work hard
and get an education. It means, essentially, that everything that made
it possible for me, Lindsay, Gail, Jane Rex, and Aunt Wee to find some
measure of happiness is missing. So I wasn’t surprised that Mormon
Utah—with its strong church, integrated communities, and intact
families—wiped the floor with Rust Belt Ohio.</p>
<p>There are, I think, policy lessons to draw from my life—ways we might
put our thumb on that all-important scale. We can adjust how our social
services systems treat families like mine. Remember that when I was
twelve I watched Mom get hauled away in a police cruiser. I’d seen her
get arrested before, but I knew that this time was different. We were in
the system now, with social worker visits and mandated family
counseling. And a court date hanging over my head like a guillotine
blade.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the caseworkers were there to protect me, but it became
very obvious, very early in the process, that they were obstacles to
overcome. When I explained that I spent most of my time with my
grandparents and that I’d like to continue with that arrangement, they
replied that the courts would not necessarily sanction such an
arrangement. In the eyes of the law, my grandmother was an untrained
caretaker without a foster license. If things went poorly for my mother
in the courts, I was as likely to find myself with a foster family as I
was with Mamaw. The notion of being separated from everyone and
everything I loved was terrifying. So I shut my mouth, told the social
workers everything was fine, and hoped that I wouldn’t lose my family
when the court hearing came.</p>
<p>That hope panned out—Mom didn’t go to jail, and I got to stay with
Mamaw. The arrangement was informal: I could stay with Mom if I wanted,
but if not, Mamaw’s door was always open. The enforcement mechanism was
equally informal: Mamaw would kill anyone who tried to keep me from her.
This worked for us because Mamaw was a lunatic and our entire family
feared her.</p>
<p>Not everyone can rely on the saving graces of a crazy hillbilly.
Child services are, for many kids, the last pieces of the safety net; if
they fall through, precious little remains to catch them.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is how state laws define the family. For families
like mine—and for many black and Hispanic families—grandparents,
cousins, aunts, and uncles play an outsize role. Child services often
cut them out of the picture, as they did in my case. Some states require
occupational licensing for foster parents—just like nurses and
doctors—even when the would-be foster parent is a grandmother or another
close family member. In other words, our country’s social services
weren’t made for hillbilly families, and they often make a bad problem
worse.</p>
<p>I wish I could say this was a small problem, but it’s not. In a given
year, 640,000 children, most of them poor, will spend at least some time
in foster care. Add that to the unknown number of kids who face abuse or
neglect but somehow avoid the foster care system, and you have an
epidemic—one that current policies exacerbate.</p>
<p>There are other things we can do. We can build policies based on a
better understanding of what stands in the way of kids like me. The most
important lesson of my life is not that society failed to provide me
with opportunities. My elementary and middle schools were entirely
adequate, staffed with teachers who did everything they could to reach
me. Our high school ranked near the bottom of Ohio’s schools, but that
had little to do with the staff and much to do with the students. I had
Pell Grants and government-subsidized low-interest student loans that
made college affordable, and need-based scholarships for law school. I
never went hungry, thanks at least in part to the old-age benefits that
Mamaw generously shared with me. These programs are far from perfect,
but to the degree that I nearly succumbed to my worst decisions (and I
came quite close), the fault lies almost entirely with factors outside
the government’s control.</p>
<p>Recently, I sat down with a group of teachers from my alma mater,
Middletown High. All of them expressed the worry, in one form or
another, that society devoted too many resources too late in the game.
“It’s like our politicians think college is the only way,” one teacher
told me. “For many, it’s great. But a lot of our kids have no realistic
shot of getting a college degree.” Another said: “The violence and the
fighting, it’s all they’ve seen from a very young age. One of my
students lost her baby like she’d lost her car keys—had no idea where it
went. Two weeks later, her child turned up in New York City with the
father, a drug dealer, and some of his family.” Short of a miracle, we
all know what kind of life awaits that poor baby. Yet there’s precious
little to support her now, when an intervention might help.</p>
<p>So I think that any successful policy program would recognize what my
old high school’s teachers see every day: that the real problem for so
many of these kids is what happens (or doesn’t happen) at home. For
example, we’d recognize that Section 8 vouchers ought to be administered
in a way that doesn’t segregate the poor into little enclaves. As Brian
Campbell, another Middletown teacher, told me, “When you have a large
base of Section 8 parents and kids supported by fewer middle-class
taxpayers, it’s an upside-down triangle. There’re fewer emotional and
financial resources when the only people in a neighborhood are
low-income. You just can’t lump them together, because then you have a
bigger pool of hopelessness.” On the other hand, he said, “put the
lower-income kids with those who have a different lifestyle model, and
the lower-income kids start to rise up.” Yet when Middletown recently
tried to limit the number of Section 8 vouchers offered within certain
neighborhoods, the federal government balked. Better, I suppose, to keep
those kids cut off from the middle class.</p>
<p>Government policy may be powerless to resolve other problems in our
community. As a child, I associated accomplishments in school with
femininity. Manliness meant strength, courage, a willingness to fight,
and, later, success with girls. Boys who got good grades were “sissies”
or “faggots.” I don’t know where I got this feeling. Certainly not from
Mamaw, who demanded good grades, nor from Papaw. But it was there, and
studies now show that working-class boys like me do much worse in school
because they view schoolwork as a feminine endeavor. Can you change this
with a new law or program? Probably not. Some scales aren’t that
amenable to the proverbial thumb.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that the very traits that enabled my survival during
childhood inhibit my success as an adult. I see conflict and I run away
or prepare for battle. This makes little sense in my current
relationships, but without that attitude, my childhood homes would have
consumed me. I learned early to spread my money out lest Mom or someone
else find it and “borrow” it—some under the mattress, some in the
underwear drawer, some at Mamaw’s house. When, later in life, Usha and I
consolidated finances, she was shocked to learn that I had multiple bank
accounts and small past-due balances on credit cards. Usha still
sometimes reminds me that not every perceived slight—from a passing
motorist or a neighbor critical of my dogs—is cause for a blood feud.
And I always concede, despite my raw emotions, that she’s probably
right.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I was driving in Cincinnati with Usha, when
somebody cut me off. I honked, the guy flipped me off, and when we
stopped at a red light (with this guy in front of me), I unbuckled my
seat belt and opened the car door. I planned to demand an apology (and
fight the guy if necessary), but my common sense prevailed and I shut
the door before I got out of the car. Usha was delighted that I’d
changed my mind before she yelled at me to stop acting like a lunatic
(which has happened in the past), and she told me that she was proud of
me for resisting my natural instinct. The other driver’s sin was to
insult my honor, and it was on that honor that nearly every element of
my happiness depended as a child—it kept the school bully from messing
with me, connected me to my mother when some man or his children
insulted her (even if I agreed with the substance of the insult), and
gave me something, however small, over which I exercised complete
control. For the first eighteen or so years of my life, standing down
would have earned me a verbal lashing as a “pussy” or a “wimp” or a
“girl.” The objectively correct course of action was something that the
majority of my life had taught me was repulsive to an upstanding young
man. For a few hours after I did the right thing, I silently criticized
myself. But that’s progress, right? Better that than sitting in a jail
cell for teaching that asshole a lesson about defensive driving.</p>
