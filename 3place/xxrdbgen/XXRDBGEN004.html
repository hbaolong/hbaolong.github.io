<h4 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h4>
<p>Hillbillies like to add their own twist to many words. We call
minnows “minners” and crayfish “crawdads.” “Hollow” is defined as a
“valley or basin,” but I’ve never said the word “hollow” unless I’ve had
to explain to a friend what I mean when I say “holler.” Other people
have all kinds of names for their grandparents: grandpa, nanna, pop-pop,
grannie, and so on. Yet I’ve never heard anyone say “Mamaw”—pronounced
ma’am-aw—or “Papaw” outside of our community. These names belong only to
hillbilly grandparents.</p>
<p>My grandparents—Mamaw and Papaw—were, without question or
qualification, the best things that ever happened to me. They spent the
last two decades of their lives showing me the value of love and
stability and teaching me the life lessons that most people learn from
their parents. Both did their part to ensure that I had the
self-confidence and the right opportunities to get a fair shot at the
American Dream. But I doubt that, as children, Jim Vance and Bonnie
Blanton ever expected much out of their own lives. How could they?
Appalachian hills and single-room, K–12 schoolhouses don’t tend to
foster big dreams.</p>
<p>We don’t know much about Papaw’s early years, and I doubt that will
ever change. We do know that he was something of hillbilly royalty.
Papaw’s distant cousin—also Jim Vance—married into the Hatfield family
and joined a group of former Confederate soldiers and sympathizers
called the Wildcats. When Cousin Jim murdered former Union soldier Asa
Harmon McCoy, he kicked off one of the most famous family feuds in
American history.</p>
<p>Papaw was born James Lee Vance in 1929, his middle name a tribute to
his father, Lee Vance. Lee died just a few months after Papaw’s birth,
so Papaw’s overwhelmed mother, Goldie, sent him to live with her father,
Pap Taulbee, a strict man with a small timber business. Though Goldie
sent money occasionally, she rarely visited her young son. Papaw would
live with Taulbee in Jackson, Kentucky, for the first seventeen years of
his life.</p>
<p>Pap Taulbee had a tiny two-room house just a few hundred yards from
the Blantons—Blaine and Hattie and their eight children. Hattie felt
sorry for the young motherless boy and became a surrogate mother to my
grandfather. Jim soon became an extra member of the family: He spent
most of his free time running around with the Blanton boys, and he ate
most of his meals in Hattie’s kitchen. It was only natural that he’d
eventually marry her oldest daughter.</p>
<p>Jim married into a rowdy crew. The Blantons were a famous group in
Breathitt, and they had a feuding history nearly as illustrious as
Papaw’s. Mamaw’s great-grandfather had been elected county judge at the
beginning of the twentieth century, but only after her grandfather,
Tilden (the son of the judge), killed a member of a rival family on
Election Day.2 In a New York Times story about the violent feud, two
things leap out. The first is that Tilden never went to jail for the
crime.3 The second is that, as the Times reported, “complications [were]
expected.” I would imagine so.</p>
<p>When I first read this gruesome story in one of the country’s most
circulated newspapers, I felt one emotion above all the rest: pride.
It’s unlikely that any other ancestor of mine has ever appeared in The
New York Times. Even if they had, I doubt that any deed would make me as
proud as a successful feud. And one that could have swung an election,
no less! As Mamaw used to say, you can take the boy out of Kentucky, but
you can’t take Kentucky out of the boy.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine what Papaw was thinking. Mamaw came from a family
that would shoot at you rather than argue with you. Her father was a
scary old hillbilly with the mouth and war medals of a sailor. Her
grandfather’s murderous exploits were impressive enough to make the
pages of The New York Times. And as scary as her lineage was, Mamaw
Bonnie herself was so terrifying that, many decades later, a Marine
Corps recruiter would tell me that I’d find boot camp easier than living
at home. “Those drill instructors are mean,” he said. “But not like that
grandma of yours.” That meanness wasn’t enough to dissuade my
grandfather. So Mamaw and Papaw were married as teenagers in Jackson, in
1947.</p>
<p>At that time, as the post–World War II euphoria wore off and people
began to adjust to a world at peace, there were two types of people in
Jackson: those who uprooted their lives and planted them in the
industrial powerhouses of the new America, and those who didn’t. At the
tender ages of fourteen and seventeen, my grandparents had to decide
which group to join.</p>
<p>As Papaw once told me, the sole option for many of his friends was to
work “in the mines”—mining coal not far from Jackson. Those who stayed
in Jackson spent their lives on the edge of poverty, if not submerged in
it. So, soon after marrying, Papaw uprooted his young family and moved
to Middletown, a small Ohio town with a rapidly growing industrialized
economy.</p>
<p>This is the story my grandparents told me, and like most family
legends it’s largely true but plays fast and loose with the details. On
a recent trip to visit family in Jackson, my great-uncle Arch—Mamaw’s
brother-in-law and the last of that generation of Jacksonians—introduced
me to Bonnie South, a woman who’d spent all of her eighty-four years a
hundred yards from Mamaw’s childhood home. Until Mamaw left for Ohio,
Bonnie South was her best friend. And by Bonnie South’s reckoning, Mamaw
and Papaw’s departure involved a bit more scandal than any of us
realized.</p>
<p>In 1946, Bonnie South and Papaw were lovers. I’m not sure what this
meant in Jackson at the time—whether they were preparing for an
engagement or just passing the time together. Bonnie had little to say
of Papaw besides the fact that he was “very handsome.” The only other
thing Bonnie South recalled was that, at some point in 1946, Papaw
cheated on Bonnie with her best friend—Mamaw. Mamaw was thirteen and
Papaw sixteen, but the affair produced a pregnancy. And that pregnancy
added a number of pressures that made right now the time to leave
Jackson: my intimidating, grizzled war-veteran great-grandfather; the
Blanton Brothers, who had already earned a reputation for defending
Mamaw’s honor; and an interconnected group of gun-toting hillbillies who
immediately knew all about Bonnie Blanton’s pregnancy. Most important,
Bonnie and Jim Vance would soon have another mouth to feed before they’d
gotten used to feeding themselves. Mamaw and Papaw left abruptly for
Dayton, Ohio, where they lived briefly before settling permanently in
Middletown.</p>
<p>In later years, Mamaw sometimes spoke of a daughter who died in
infancy, and she led us all to believe that the daughter was born
sometime after Uncle Jimmy, Mamaw and Papaw’s eldest child. Mamaw
suffered eight miscarriages in the decade between Uncle Jimmy’s birth
and my mother’s. But recently my sister discovered a birth certificate
for “Infant” Vance, the aunt I never knew, who died so young that her
birth certificate also lists her date of death. The baby who brought my
grandparents to Ohio didn’t survive her first week. On that birth
certificate, the baby’s brokenhearted mother lied about her age: Only
fourteen at the time and with a seventeen-year-old husband, she couldn’t
tell the truth, lest they ship her back to Jackson or send Papaw to
jail.</p>
<p>Mamaw’s first foray into adulthood ended in tragedy. Today I often
wonder: Without the baby, would she ever have left Jackson? Would she
have run off with Jim Vance to foreign territory? Mamaw’s entire
life—and the trajectory of our family—may have changed for a baby who
lived only six days.</p>
<p>Whatever mix of economic opportunity and family necessity catapulted
my grandparents to Ohio, they were there, and there was no going back.
So Papaw found a job at Armco, a large steel company that aggressively
recruited in eastern Kentucky coal country. Armco representatives would
descend on towns like Jackson and promise (truthfully) a better life for
those willing to move north and work in the mills. A special policy
encouraged wholesale migration: Applicants with a family member working
at Armco would move to the top of the employment list. Armco didn’t just
hire the young men of Appalachian Kentucky; they actively encouraged
those men to bring their extended families.</p>
<p>A number of industrial firms employed a similar strategy, and it
appears to have worked. During that era, there were many Jacksons and
many Middletowns. Researchers have documented two major waves of
migration from Appalachia to the industrial powerhouse economies in the
Midwest. The first happened after World War I, when returning veterans
found it nearly impossible to find work in the not-yet-industrialized
mountains of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee. It ended as the
Great Depression hit Northern economies hard.4 My grandparents were part
of the second wave, composed of returning veterans and the rapidly
rising number of young adults in 1940s and ’50s Appalachia.5 As the
economies of Kentucky and West Virginia lagged behind those of their
neighbors, the mountains had only two products that the industrial
economies of the North needed: coal and hill people. And Appalachia
exported a lot of both.</p>
<p>Precise numbers are tough to pin down because studies typically
measure “net out-migration”—as in the total number of people who left
minus the number of people who came in. Many families constantly
traveled back and forth, which skews the data. But it is certain that
many millions of people traveled along the “hillbilly highway”—a
metaphorical term that captured the opinion of Northerners who saw their
cities and towns flooded with people like my grandparents. The scale of
the migration was staggering. In the 1950s, thirteen of every one
hundred Kentucky residents migrated out of the state. Some areas saw
even greater emigration: Harlan County, for example, which was brought
to fame in an Academy Award–winning documentary about coal strikes, lost
30 percent of its population to migration. In 1960, of Ohio’s ten
million residents, one million were born in Kentucky, West Virginia, or
Tennessee. This doesn’t count the large number of migrants from
elsewhere in the southern Appalachian Mountains; nor does it include the
children or grandchildren of migrants who were hill people to the core.
There were undoubtedly many of these children and grandchildren, as
hillbillies tended to have much higher birthrates than the native
population.6</p>
<p>In short, my grandparents’ experience was extremely common.
Significant parts of an entire region picked up shop and moved north.
Need more proof? Hop on a northbound highway in Kentucky or Tennessee
the day after Thanksgiving or Christmas, and virtually every license
plate you see comes from Ohio, Indiana, or Michigan—cars full of
hillbilly transplants returning home for the holidays.</p>
<p>Mamaw’s family participated in the migratory flow with gusto. Of her
seven siblings, Pet, Paul, and Gary moved to Indiana and worked in
construction. Each owned a successful business and earned considerable
wealth in the process. Rose, Betty, Teaberry, and David stayed behind.
All of them struggled financially, though everyone but David managed a
life of relative comfort by the standards of their community. The four
who left died on a significantly higher rung of the socioeconomic ladder
than the four who stayed. As Papaw knew when he was a young man, the
best way up for the hillbilly was out.</p>
<p>It was probably uncommon for my grandparents to be alone in their new
city. But if Mamaw and Papaw were isolated from their family, they were
hardly segregated from Middletown’s broader population. Most of the
city’s inhabitants had moved there for work in the new industrial
plants, and most of these new workers were from Appalachia. The
family-based hiring practices of the major industrial firms7 had their
desired effect, and the results were predictable. All over the
industrial Midwest, new communities of Appalachian transplants and their
families sprang up, virtually out of nowhere. As one study noted,
“Migration did not so much destroy neighborhoods and families as
transport them.”8 In 1950s Middletown, my grandparents found themselves
in a situation both new and familiar. New because they were, for the
first time, cut off from the extended Appalachian support network to
which they were accustomed; familiar because they were still surrounded
by hillbillies.</p>
<p>I’d like to tell you how my grandparents thrived in their new
environment, how they raised a successful family, and how they retired
comfortably middle-class. But that is a partial truth. The full truth is
that my grandparents struggled in their new life, and they continued to
do so for decades.</p>
<p>For starters, a remarkable stigma attached to people who left the
hills of Kentucky for a better life. Hillbillies have a phrase—“too big
for your britches”—to describe those who think they’re better than the
stock they came from. For a long time after my grandparents came to
Ohio, they heard exactly that phrase from people back home. The sense
that they had abandoned their families was acute, and it was expected
that, whatever their responsibilities, they would return home regularly.
This pattern was common among Appalachian migrants: More than nine in
ten would make visits “home” during the course of their lives, and more
than one in ten visited about once a month.9 My grandparents returned to
Jackson often, sometimes on consecutive weekends, despite the fact that
the trip in the 1950s required about twenty hours of driving. Economic
mobility came with a lot of pressures, and it came with a lot of new
responsibilities.</p>
<p>That stigma came from both directions: Many of their new neighbors
viewed them suspiciously. To the established middle class of white
Ohioans, these hillbillies simply didn’t belong. They had too many
children, and they welcomed their extended families into their homes for
too long. On several occasions, Mamaw’s brothers and sisters lived with
her and Papaw for months as they tried to find good work outside of the
hills. In other words, many parts of their culture and customs met with
roaring disapproval from native Middletonians. As one book, Appalachian
Odyssey, notes about the influx of hill people to Detroit: “It was not
simply that the Appalachian migrants, as rural strangers ‘out of place’
in the city, were upsetting to Midwestern, urban whites. Rather, these
migrants disrupted a broad set of assumptions held by northern whites
about how white people appeared, spoke, and behaved . . . the disturbing
aspect of hillbillies was their racialness. Ostensibly, they were of the
same racial order (whites) as those who dominated economic, political,
and social power in local and national arenas. But hillbillies shared
many regional characteristics with the southern blacks arriving in
Detroit.”10</p>
<p>One of Papaw’s good friends—a hillbilly from Kentucky whom he met in
Ohio—became the mail carrier in their neighborhood. Not long after he
moved, the mail carrier got embroiled in a battle with the Middletown
government over the flock of chickens that he kept in his yard. He
treated them just as Mamaw had treated her chickens back in the holler:
Every morning he collected all the eggs, and when his chicken population
grew too large, he’d take a few of the old ones, wring their necks, and
carve them up for meat right in his backyard. You can just imagine a
well-bred housewife watching out the window in horror as her
Kentucky-born neighbor slaughtered squawking chickens just a few feet
away. My sister and I still call the old mail carrier “the chicken man,”
and years later even a mention of how the city government ganged up on
the chicken man could inspire Mamaw’s trademark vitriol: “Fucking zoning
laws. They can kiss my ruby-red asshole.”</p>
<p>The move to Middletown created other problems, as well. In the
mountain homes of Jackson, privacy was more theory than practice.
Family, friends, and neighbors would barge into your home without much
warning. Mothers would tell their daughters how to raise their children.
Fathers would tell sons how to do their jobs. Brothers would tell
brothers-in-law how to treat their wives. Family life was something
people learned on the fly with a lot of help from their neighbors. In
Middletown, a man’s home was his castle.</p>
<p>However, that castle was empty for Mamaw and Papaw. They brought an
ancient family structure from the hills and tried to make it work in a
world of privacy and nuclear families. They were newlyweds, but they
didn’t have anyone to teach them about marriage. They were parents, but
there were no grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins to help them with
the workload. The only nearby close relative was Papaw’s mother, Goldie.
She was mostly a stranger to her own son, and Mamaw couldn’t have held
her in lower esteem for abandoning him.</p>
<p>After a few years, Mamaw and Papaw began to adapt. Mamaw became close
friends with the “neighbor lady” (that was her word for the neighbors
she liked) who lived in a nearby apartment; Papaw worked on cars in his
spare time, and his coworkers slowly turned from colleagues to friends.
In 1951 they welcomed a baby boy—my uncle Jimmy—and showered him with
their new material comforts. Jimmy, Mamaw would tell me later, could sit
up at two weeks, walk at four months, speak in complete sentences just
after his first birthday, and read classic novels by age three (“A
slight exaggeration,” my uncle later admitted). They visited Mamaw’s
brothers in Indianapolis and picnicked with their new friends. It was,
Uncle Jimmy told me, “a typical middle-class life.” Kind of boring, by
some standards, but happy in a way you appreciate only when you
understand the consequences of not being boring.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that things always proceeded smoothly. Once, they
traveled to the mall to buy Christmas presents with the holiday throng
and let Jimmy roam so he could locate a toy he coveted. “They were
advertising it on television,” he told me recently. “It was a plastic
console that looked like the dash of a jet fighter plane. You could
shine a light or shoot darts. The whole idea was to pretend that you
were a fighter pilot.”</p>
<p>Jimmy wandered into a pharmacy that happened to sell the toy, so he
picked it up and began to play with it. “The store clerk wasn’t happy.
He told me to put the toy down and get out.” Chastised, young Jimmy
stood outside in the cold until Mamaw and Papaw strolled by and asked if
he’d like to go inside the pharmacy.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” Jimmy told his father.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I just can’t.”</p>
<p>“Tell me why right now.”</p>
<p>He pointed at the store clerk. “That man got mad at me and told me to
leave. I’m not allowed to go back inside.”</p>
<p>Mamaw and Papaw stormed in, demanding an explanation for the clerk’s
rudeness. The clerk explained that Jimmy had been playing with an
expensive toy. “This toy?” Papaw asked, picking up the toy. When the
clerk nodded, Papaw smashed it on the ground. Utter chaos ensued. As
Uncle Jimmy explained, “They went nuts. Dad threw another of the toys
across the store and moved toward the clerk in a very menacing way; Mom
started grabbing random shit off the shelves and throwing it all over
the place. She’s screaming, ‘Kick his fucking ass! Kick his fucking
ass!’ And then Dad leans in to this clerk and says very clearly, ‘If you
say another word to my son, I will break your fucking neck.’ This poor
guy was completely terrified, and I just wanted to get the hell out of
there.” The man apologized, and the Vances continued with their
Christmas shopping as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>So, yes, even in their best times, Mamaw and Papaw struggled to
adapt. Middletown was a different world. Papaw was supposed to go to
work and complain politely to management about rude pharmacy employees.
Mamaw was expected to cook dinner, do laundry, and take care of the
children. But sewing circles, picnics, and door-to-door vacuum salesmen
were not suited to a woman who had almost killed a man at the tender age
of twelve. Mamaw had little help when the children were young and
required constant supervision, and she had nothing else to do with her
time. Decades later she would remember how isolated she felt in the slow
suburban crawl of midcentury Middletown. Of that era, she said with
characteristic bluntness: “Women were just shit on all the time.”</p>
<p>Mamaw had her dreams but never the opportunity to pursue them. Her
greatest love was children, in both a specific sense (her children and
grandchildren were the only things in the world she seemed to enjoy in
old age) and a general one (she watched shows about abused, neglected,
and missing kids and used what little spare money she had to purchase
shoes and school supplies for the neighborhood’s poorest children). She
seemed to feel the pain of neglected kids in a deeply personal way and
spoke often of how she hated people who mistreated children. I never
understood where this sentiment came from—whether she herself was abused
as a child, perhaps, or whether she just regretted that her childhood
had ended so abruptly. There is a story there, though I’ll likely never
hear it.</p>
<p>Mamaw dreamed of turning that passion into a career as a children’s
attorney—serving as a voice for those who lacked one. She never pursued
that dream, possibly because she didn’t know what becoming an attorney
took. Mamaw never spent a day in high school. She’d given birth to and
buried a child before she could legally drive a car. Even if she’d known
what was required, her new lifestyle offered little encouragement or
opportunity for an aspiring law student with three children and a
husband.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, both of my grandparents had an almost religious
faith in hard work and the American Dream. Neither was under any
illusions that wealth or privilege didn’t matter in America. On
politics, for example, Mamaw had one opinion—“They’re all a bunch of
crooks”—but Papaw became a committed Democrat. He had no problem with
Armco, but he and everyone like him hated the coal companies in Kentucky
thanks to a long history of labor strife. So, to Papaw and Mamaw, not
all rich people were bad, but all bad people were rich. Papaw was a
Democrat because that party protected the working people. This attitude
carried over to Mamaw: All politicians might be crooks, but if there
were any exceptions, they were undoubtedly members of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition.</p>
<p>Still, Mamaw and Papaw believed that hard work mattered more. They
knew that life was a struggle, and though the odds were a bit longer for
people like them, that fact didn’t excuse failure. “Never be like these
fucking losers who think the deck is stacked against them,” my grandma
often told me. “You can do anything you want to.”</p>
<p>Their community shared this faith, and in the 1950s that faith
appeared well founded. Within two generations, the transplanted
hillbillies had largely caught up to the native population in terms of
income and poverty level. Yet their financial success masked their
cultural unease, and if my grandparents caught up economically, I wonder
if they ever truly assimilated. They always had one foot in the new life
and one foot in the old one. They slowly acquired a small number of
friends but remained strongly rooted in their Kentucky homeland. They
hated domesticated animals and had little use for “critters” that
weren’t for eating, yet they eventually relented to the children’s
demands for dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Their children, though, were different. My mom’s generation was the
first to grow up in the industrial Midwest, far from the deep twangs and
one-room schools of the hills. They attended modern high schools with
thousands of other students. To my grandparents, the goal was to get out
of Kentucky and give their kids a head start. The kids, in turn, were
expected to do something with that head start. It didn’t quite work out
that way.</p>
<p>Before Lyndon Johnson and the Appalachian Regional Commission brought
new roads to southeastern Kentucky, the primary road from Jackson to
Ohio was U.S. Route 23. So important was this road in the massive
hillbilly migration that Dwight Yoakam penned a song about northerners
who castigated Appalachian children for learning the wrong three R’s:
“Reading, Rightin’, Rt. 23.” Yoakam’s song about his own move from
southeastern Kentucky could have come from Mamaw’s diary:</p>
<p>They thought readin’, writin’, Route 23 would take them to the good
life that they had never seen;</p>
<p>They didn’t know that old highway would lead them to a world of
misery</p>
<p>Mamaw and Papaw may have made it out of Kentucky, but they and their
children learned the hard way that Route 23 didn’t lead where they
hoped.</p>
