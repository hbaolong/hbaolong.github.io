<h4 id="december-eva-as-a-productivity-measure">8 December EVA as a
Productivity Measure</h4>
<p>Until a business returns a profit that is greater than its cost of
capital, it does not create wealth, it destroys it.</p>
<ul>
<li>capital,英 [ˈkæpɪt(ə)l] 美 [ˈkæpɪt(ə)l]
n. 资本，资金；资本家，资方；首都，首府，省会；活动（或生产）中心；大写字母；柱顶，柱头
adj. 可处死刑的；大写的；首府的，省会的；<旧>顶好的，极好的</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring total-factor productivity is one of the major challenges
confronting the executive in the age of knowledge work. For manual work,
measuring quantity is usually sufficient. In knowledge work, we have to
manage both quantity and quality, and we do not know yet how to do that.
We must try to assess total-factor productivity using the common
denominator of revenues and expenses. By measuring the value added over
all costs, including the cost of capital, EVA (economic value added
analysis) measures, in effect, the productivity of all factors of
production [or the true economic costs produced by all resources
used].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>confront,英 [kənˈfrʌnt] 美 [kənˈfrʌnt] v.
面对，面临；正视，处理；对峙，对抗；对质，当面对证</p></li>
<li><p>quantity,英 [ˈkwɒntəti] 美 [ˈkwɑːntəti]
n. 量，数目；大量，大批；（尤指和质量相对的）数量；（语音）音量；值，参量；代表数量（或参量）的数（或符号）</p></li>
<li><p>productivity,英 [ˌprɒdʌkˈtɪvəti] 美
[ˌproʊdʌkˈtɪvətiˌˌprɑːdʌkˈtɪvəti] n. 生产率，生产力</p></li>
<li><p>denominator,英 [dɪˈnɒmɪneɪtə(r)] 美 [dɪˈnɑːmɪneɪtər]
n. （分数中的）分母；统计基准；命名者；共同特征或共同性质</p></li>
<li><p>revenue,英 [ˈrevənjuː] 美 [ˈrevənuː]
n. （企业、组织的）收入，收益；（政府的）税收；税务局，税务署（the
revenue）</p></li>
<li><p>expense,英 [ɪkˈspens] 美 [ɪkˈspens]
n. 代价，费用；业务费用，报销（expenses）；需要花钱的东西，花销的东西 v.
<非正式>把……记入费用账户；向……收取费用；被花掉</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never mind that a business pays taxes as if it had earned a
profit.</strong> It does not cover its full costs until reported profits
exceed its cost of capital. Until a business returns a profit that is
greater than its cost of capital, it operates at a loss. And this is why
EVA is growing in popularity. It does not, by itself, tell us why a
certain product or a certain service does not add value or what to do
about it. It does show which products, services, operations, or
activities have unusually high productivity and add unusually high
value. Then we should ask ourselves, “What can we learn from these
successes?”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Calculate the “economic value added” for your
organization or for a product or service that you provide.</p>

<h4 id="december-benchmarking-for-competitiveness">9 December
Benchmarking for Competitiveness</h4>
<p>Benchmarking assumes that being at least as good as the leader is a
prerequisite to being competitive.</p>
<p>EVA (economic value added analysis) is a good start to assess the
competitiveness of an enterprise in the global marketplace, but to it we
must add benchmarking. Benchmarking is a tool that helps a firm tell
whether or not it is globally competitive. Benchmarking assumes,
correctly, that what one company does another company can always do as
well. “Best performers” are often found in identical services or
functions inside an organization, in competitor organizations, but also
in organizations outside the industry. Together, EVA and benchmarking
provide the diagnostic tools needed to measure total-factor productivity
and to manage it. They are examples of the new tools executives should
understand to measure and manage what goes on inside the enterprise.
Combined, they are the best measures we have so far available.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Instigate a benchmarking study by gathering data on a
product, service, or process from a comparable organization, even from
one outside your industry. Set performance measures to ensure that you
are competitive with the best performers.</p>

<h4 id="december-resource-allocation-decisions">10 December
Resource-Allocation Decisions</h4>
<p>The allocation of capital and people determine whether the
organization will do well or poorly.</p>
<p>The allocation of capital and performing people converts into action
all that management knows about its business—they determine whether the
organization will do well or poorly. An organization should allocate
human resources as purposefully and as thoughtfully as it allocates
capital. To understand a capital investment, a company has to look at
four measures: return on investment, payback period, cash flow, and
discounted present value. Each of these four measures tells the
executive something different about a prospective capital investment.
Each looks at the investment through a different lens. Decision makers
should not evaluate capital investments in isolation, but as part of a
cluster of projects. They should then select the cluster that shows the
best ratio between opportunity and risk. The results of capital spending
should be assessed against expectations in the postaudit procedure.
Information gathered from the procedure can then be used to help make
decisions about future investments.</p>
<p>The decisions to hire, to fire, and to promote are among the most
important decisions of the executive. They are more difficult than the
capital allocation decision. An organization needs to have a systematic
process for making people decisions that is just as rigorous as the one
it has for making decisions about capital. Executives need to evaluate
people against expectations.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Review your capital allocation decisions of the past
year. Are they meeting your expectations? Review your hiring and
promotion decisions of the past year. Are they meeting your
expectations? Make changes to your resource allocation procedures based
on feedback analysis.</p>

</ul>
<p>Acquisitions should be successful, but few are, in fact. The reason
for this nonperformance is always the same: disregard of the well-known
and well-tested rules for successful acquisitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>nonperformance,英 [ˌnɒnpəˈfɔːməns] n. 不履行，不实行</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The six rules of successful acquisitions are:</p>
<p>The successful acquisition must be based on business strategy, not
financial strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>strategy,英 [ˈstrætədʒi] 美 [ˈstrætədʒi]
n. （尤指为获得某物制定长期的）策略，行动计划；战略，战略学</li>

<p>The acquirer must respect the business, products, and customers of
the acquired company, as well as its values.</p>
<ul>

<p>The acquirer must be prepared to provide top management to the
acquired business within a fairly short period, a year at most.</p>
<p>The successful acquisition must rapidly create visible opportunities

<h4 id="december-business-not-financial-strategy">12 December Business
Not Financial Strategy</h4>
<p>“There ain’t no bargains,” and “You get at most what you pay
for.”</p>
<p>S uccessful acquisitions are based upon business plans, not financial
analyses. Acquisition targets must fit the business strategies of the
acquiring company; otherwise, the acquisition is likely to fail. The
worst acquisition record of the last decades of the twentieth century
was that of Peter Grace, the longtime CEO of W. R. Grace. He was a
brilliant man. He set out in the 1950s to build a world-class
multinational through financially-based acquisitions. He assembled the
ablest group of financial analysts and had them scout all over the world
for industries and companies with a low price/earnings ratio. He bought
these companies at what he thought were bargain prices. The financial
analysis of each Grace purchase was impeccable. But there was absolutely
no business strategy.</p>
<p>By contrast, one of the most successful examples of company growth
based on acquisitions was the one that underlined the stellar
performance of General Electric during the tenure of Jack Welch as CEO
from 1981 to 2001. The largest single cause of the company’s growth in
sales and earnings—and the resulting rise in the company’s market
value—was the acquisition-based expansion of GE Capital. Of course, not
all of them panned out. In fact, there was one major failure, the
acquisition of a brokerage firm. But otherwise the GE Capital
acquisitions seem to have worked out magnificently. Underlying
practically all of them was a sound business strategy.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Think through an acquisition made by your organization.
What was the basis of the acquisition: strategic or financial? How has
it worked out?</p>

<li>acquirer,英 [əˈkwaɪərə(r)] 美 [əˈkwaɪərər]
n. 收买者；受让人；需方；捕捉器</li>
</ul>
<p>The successful acquisition is based on what the acquiring company
contributes to the acquisition.</p>
<p>An acquisition will succeed only if the acquiring company thinks
through what it can contribute to the business it is buying, not what
the acquired company will contribute to the acquirer, no matter how
attractive the expected “synergy” may look. What the acquiring company
contributes may vary. It may be management, technology, or strength in
distribution. This contribution has to be something besides money.
<strong>Money by itself is never enough.</strong></p>

<li>synergy,英 [ˈsɪnədʒi] 美 [ˈsɪnərdʒi]
n. （两个或多个组织共同协作后产生的）协同增效作用，协同作用</li>
</ul>
<p>The acquisition of Citibank by Travelers was successful because the
acquiring company, Travelers, thought through and planned what it could
contribute to Citibank that would make a major difference. Citibank had
established itself successfully in practically every country of the
world and had, at the same time, built a transnational management. But
in its products and services Citibank was still primarily a traditional
bank, and its distributive and management capacity way exceeded the
products and services commercial banking can produce and deliver. And
Travelers had a good many of these products and services. What it saw
itself as being able to contribute was greatly to increase the volume of
business the superb Citibank worldwide distribution system and
management could sell, and at little or no extra cost.</p>

<p>The Successful Acquisition (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="december-common-core-of-unity">14 December Common Core of
Unity</h4>
<p>There has to be a “common culture” or at least a “cultural
affinity.”</p>
<p>S uccessful diversification by acquisition, like all successful
diversification, requires a common core of unity. The two businesses
must have in common either markets or technology, though occasionally a
comparable production process has also provided sufficient unity of
experience and expertise, as well as a common language, to bring
companies together. Without such a core of unity, diversification,
especially by acquisition, never works; financial ties alone are
insufficient.</p>
<p>One example is a big French company that has been built by acquiring
producers of all kinds of luxury goods: champagne and high-fashion
designers, very expensive watches and perfumes and handmade shoes. It
looks like the worst kind of conglomerate. The products have seemingly
nothing in common. But all of them are being bought by customers for the
same reason, which, of course, is not utility or price. Instead, people
buy them because they are “status.” What all the acquisitions of this
successful acquirer have in common is their customers’ values. Champagne
is being sold quite differently from high fashion. But it is being
bought for much the same reason.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: In any acquisition, make sure there is a common culture
or a cultural affinity between the two entities.</p>

<p>The Successful Acquisition (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="december-respect-for-the-business-and-its-values">15 December
Respect for the Business and Its Values</h4>
<p>The acquisition must be a “temperamental fit.”</p>
<p>N o acquisition works unless the people in the acquiring company have
respect for the product, the markets, and the customers of the company
they acquire. Though many large pharmaceutical companies have acquired
cosmetic firms, none has made a great success of it. Pharmacologists and
biochemists are “serious” people concerned with health and disease.
Lipsticks and lipstick users are frivolous to them. By the same token,
few of the big television networks and other entertainment companies
have made a go of the book publishers they bought. Books are not
“media,” and neither book buyers nor authors—a book publisher’s two
customers—bear any resemblance to what the Nielsen rating means by
“audience.” Sooner or later, usually sooner, a business requires a
decision. People who do not respect or feel comfortable with the
business, its products, and its users invariably make the wrong
decision.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Take an acquisition with which you are familiar. Was
there a temperamental fit between the two companies? How did the
companies respect, or fail to respect, each other’s business?</p>
<p>The Frontiers of Management</p>
<p>The Successful Acquisition (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="december-provide-new-top-management">16 December Provide New Top
Management</h4>
<p>The business these people sell is their “child.”</p>
<p>W ithin a year or so, the acquiring company must be able to provide
top management for the company it acquires. The buyer has to be prepared
to lose the top incumbents in companies that are bought. Top people are
used to being bosses; they don’t want to be “division managers.” If they
were owners or part-owners, the merger has made them so wealthy they
don’t have to stay if they don’t enjoy it. And if they are professional
managers, without an ownership stake, they usually find another job
easily enough. Then to recruit new top management is a gamble that
rarely comes off.</p>
<p>This applies particularly to a CEO who originally built the company
that he or she sold. Very often this CEO has actually initiated the
acquisition. He or she typically expects the acquirer to make the
changes that he or she has been reluctant to make—for instance, get rid
of an old employee who is a close friend and has served the company
faithfully as it grew but has been long outgrown by the job. But still,
the business these people sell is their “child.” And the moment it is
owned by someone else, they become protective and see their job as
defending the “child” against one of those unfeeling “foreigners” who
now own it.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Investigate a recent acquisition by your company or
another company. What happened to the top management of the acquired
company?</p>
<p>The Frontiers of Management</p>
<p>The Successful Acquisition (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="december-promote-across-lines">17 December Promote Across
Lines</h4>
<p>Politically, the people in the acquired company become “us”
determined to defend their business against “them.”</p>
<p>E ven if all the rules have been faithfully observed, many
acquisitions end up failing or at least take forever before they live up
to their expectations. Legally the acquired business is now part of the
acquiring company. But politically, the people in the acquired company
become “us” determined to defend their business against “them,” the
people in the acquiring company. And the people in the acquiring company
similarly think and act in terms of “us” against “them.” Sometimes it
takes a whole generation before these invisible but impenetrable
barriers come down. It is therefore imperative that, within the first
few months after the acquisition, a number of people on both sides are
promoted to a better job across the lines. This way both sides see the
acquisition as a personal opportunity.</p>
<p>The goal is to convince managers in both companies that the merger
offers them personal opportunities. This principle apples not only to
executives at or near the top, but also to the younger executives and
professionals, the people on whose dedication and efforts any business
primarily depends. If they see themselves blocked as a result of an
acquisition, they will “vote with their feet,” and as a rule they can
find new jobs even more easily than displaced top executives.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make sure you promote people in the wake of an
acquisition.</p>

<h4 id="december-alliances-for-progress">18 December Alliances for
Progress</h4>
<p>The practice of management will have to base itself on the new
assumption that its scope is not legal but the entire economic
chain.</p>
<p>B usiness growth and business expansion in different parts of the
world will increasingly not be based on mergers and acquisitions or even
on starting new, wholly owned businesses there. They will increasingly
have to be based on alliances, partnerships, joint ventures, and all
kinds of relations with organizations located in other political
jurisdictions. They will increasingly have to be based on structures
that are economic units and not legal—and therefore not
political—units.</p>
<p>There are many reasons growth henceforth will be based on
partnerships of all sorts rather than on outright ownership and
command-and-control. One of the more compelling will be the need to
operate in both a global world economy and a splintered world polity. A
partnership is by no means a perfect solution to this problem. But at
least the conflict between economic reality and legal reality is greatly
lessened if the economic unit is not also a legal unit, but is a
partnership, an alliance, a joint venture, that is a relationship in
which political and legal appearance can be separated from economic
reality.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: A very successful U.S. company constructed a number of
plants in South America. A less prominent U.S. company decided to form
alliances with existing companies in South America. The first company
failed miserably, whereas the second succeeded. What insights are
provided by this reading as to why the second was successful and the
first a failure?</p>
<p>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</p>
<h4 id="december-rules-for-successful-alliances">19 December Rules for
Successful Alliances</h4>
<p>Alliances tend to get into serious trouble when they succeed.</p>
<p>W hile their failure rate in early years is no higher than that of
new ventures, alliances tend to get into serious trouble—sometimes
fatal—when they succeed. Often when an alliance does well, it becomes
apparent that the goals and objectives of the partners are not
compatible.</p>
<p>The problems can be anticipated and largely prevented by following
five rules.</p>
<p>Before the alliance is completed, all parties must think through
their objectives and the objectives of the “child.”</p>
<p>Equally important is advance agreement on how the joint enterprise
should be run.</p>
<p>Next, there has to be careful thinking about who will manage the
alliance.</p>
<p>Each partner needs to make provisions in its own structure for the
relationship to the joint enterprise and the other partners. The best
way, especially in a large organization, is to entrust all such
“dangerous liaisons” to one senior executive.</p>
<p>Finally, there has to be prior agreement on how to resolve
disagreements. The best way is to agree, in advance of any dispute, on
an arbitrator whom all sides know and respect and whose verdict will be
accepted as final by all of them.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Alliances have been portrayed as “dangerous liaisons.”
What is so dangerous about entering into an alliance?</p>
<p>Managing for the Future</p>
<h4 id="december-the-temptation-to-do-good">20 December The Temptation
to Do Good</h4>
<p>Public-service institutions are out to maximize rather than to
optimize.</p>
<p>T he most important obstacle to innovation is that public-service
institutions exist, after all, to “do good.” This means that they tend
to see their mission as a moral absolute rather than as economic and
subject to a cost/benefit calculus. Economics always seeks a different
allocation of the same resources to obtain a higher yield. In the
public-service institution, there is no such thing as a higher yield. If
one is “doing good,” then there is no “better.” Indeed, failure to
attain objectives in the quest for a “good” only means that efforts need
to be redoubled.</p>
<p>“Our mission will not be completed,” asserts the head of the Crusade
Against Hunger, “as long as there is one child on the earth going to bed
hungry.” If he were to say, “Our mission will be completed if the
largest possible number of children that can be reached through existing
distribution channels get enough to eat not to be stunted,” he would be
booted out of office. But if the goal is maximization, it can never be
attained. Indeed, the closer one comes toward attaining one’s objective,
the more efforts are called for. For, once optimization has been
reached, additional costs go up exponentially while additional results
fall off exponentially. The closer a public-service institution comes to
attaining its objectives, therefore, the more frustrated it will be and
the harder it will work on what it is already doing.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Prison Fellowship seeks to reduce the rate at which
released prisoners are incarcerated again because of new crimes. Why
would it be unwise for Prison Fellowship to try to eliminate so-called
“recidivism?”</p>
<p>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</p>
<h4 id="december-the-whistle-blower">21 December The Whistle-blower</h4>
<p>Whistle-blowing is ethically ambiguous.</p>
<p>T oday’s ethics of organization debate pays great attention to the
duty to be a “whistle-blower” and to the protection of the
whistle-blower against retaliation or suppression by his boss or by his
organization. This sounds high-minded. Surely, the subordinate has a
right, if not indeed a duty, to bring to public attention and remedial
action his superior’s misdeeds, let alone violation of the law on the
part of a superior or of his employing organization. But in the context
of the ethics of interdependence, whistle-blowing is ethically quite
ambiguous.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are misdeeds of the superior or of the employing
organization that so grossly violate propriety and laws that the
subordinate (or the friend, or the child, or even the wife) cannot
remain silent. This is, after all, what the word “felony” implies; one
becomes a partner to a felony and criminally liable by not reporting,
and thus compounding it. But otherwise? It is not primarily that to
encourage whistle-blowing corrodes that bond of trust that ties the
superior to the subordinate. Encouraging the whistle-blower must make
the subordinate lose trust in the superior’s willingness and ability to
protect people.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The Sarbanes-Oxley law encourages whistle-blowing from
insiders in the case of corporate corruption. How will this legislation
affect the bond between superior and subordinates?</p>
<p>The Ecological Vision</p>
<h4 id="december-limits-of-social-responsibility">22 December Limits of
Social Responsibility</h4>
<p>“It is not enough for business to do well; it must also do good.”</p>
<p>But in order to “do good,” a business must first “do well.”</p>
<p>W henever a business has disregarded the limitation of economic
performance and has assumed social responsibilities that it could not
support economically, it has soon gotten into trouble.</p>
<p>Union Carbide was not socially responsible when it put its plant into
Vienna, West Virginia, to alleviate unemployment there. It was, in fact,
irresponsible. The plant was marginal to begin with. The process was
obsolescent. At best the plant could barely keep its head above water.
And this, inevitably, meant a plant unable to take on social
responsibility, even for its own impacts. Because the plant was
uneconomical to begin with, Union Carbide resisted so long all demands
to clean it up. This particular demand could not have been foreseen in
the late 1940s, when concern with jobs far outweighed any concern for
the environment. But demands of some kind can always be expected. To do
something out of social responsibility that is economically irrational
and untenable is therefore never responsible. It is sentimental. The
result is always greater damage.</p>

<h4 id="december-spiritual-values">23 December Spiritual Values</h4>
<p>Only compassion can save—the wordless knowledge of my own
responsibility for whatever is being done to the least of God’s
children.</p>
<p>This is knowledge of the spirit.</p>
<p>S ociety needs a return to spiritual values—not to offset the
material but to make it fully productive. However remote its realization
for the great mass of mankind, there is today the promise of material
abundance or at least of material sufficiency. Mankind needs the return
to spiritual values, for it needs compassion. It needs the deep
experience that the Thou and the I are one, which all higher religions
share. In an age of terror, of persecution, and of mass murder, such as
ours, the hard shell of moral callousness may be necessary to survival.
Without it we might yield to paralyzing despair. But moral numbness is
also a terrible disease of mind and soul, and a terrible danger. It
abets, even if it does not condone, cruelty and persecution. We have
learned that the ethical humanitarianism of the nineteenth century
cannot prevent man from becoming beast.</p>
<p>The individual needs the return to spiritual values, for he can
survive in the present human situation only by reaffirming that man is
not just a biological and physiological being but also a spiritual
being, that is, creature, and existing for the purposes of his Creator
and subject to Him. Only thus can the individual know that the threat of
instant physical annihilation of the species does not invalidate his own
existence, its meaning, and its responsibility.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: In the presence of the threat of instant annihilation,
how can we maintain meaning and responsibility without spiritual
values?</p>

<h4 id="december-human-existence-in-tension">24 December Human Existence
in Tension</h4>
<p>For Kierkegaard, human existence is possible only in tension—in
tension between man’s simultaneous life as an individual in the spirit
and as a citizen in society.</p>
<p>D isintegration of the rational character of society and the rational
relationship between individual and society is the most revolutionary
trait of our times.</p>
<p>Society must make it possible for man to die without despair if it
wants him to be able to live exclusively in society. And it can do so in
only one way: by making individual life meaningless. If you are nothing
but a leaf on the tree of the race, a cell in the body of society, then
your death is not really death; you had better call it a process of
collective regeneration. But then of course your life is not a real life
either; it is just a functional process within the life of the whole,
devoid of any meaning except in terms of the whole. Thus an optimism
that proclaims human existence in society leads straight to despair. And
this despair can lead only to totalitarianism. Human existence is
possible as existence not in despair, as existence not in tragedy; it is
possible as existence in Faith. Faith is the belief that in God the
impossible is possible, that in Him time and eternity are one, that both
life and death are meaningful.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Reflect on the following: “Human existence is possible
only in tension—in tension between man’s simultaneous life as an
individual in the spirit and as a citizen in society.”</p>

<h4 id="december-the-unfashionable-kierkegaard">25 December The
Unfashionable Kierkegaard</h4>
<p>Faith enables man to die; but it also enables him to live.</p>
<p>M y work has indeed been totally in society. But I knew at once, in
those far-back days of 1928, that my life would not and could not be
totally in society, that it would have to have an existential dimension
that transcends society. Still my work has been totally in
society—except for this essay on Kierkegaard.</p>
<p>Though Kierkegaard’s faith cannot overcome the awful loneliness, the
isolation and dissonance of human existence, it can make it bearable by
making it meaningful. The philosophy of the totalitarian creeds enables
man to die. It is dangerous to underestimate the strength of such a
philosophy; for, in a time of sorrow and suffering, of catastrophe and
horror, it is a great thing to be able to die. Yet it is not enough.
Kierkegaard’s faith, too, enables man to die; but it also enables him to
live. Faith is the belief that in God the impossible is possible, that
in Him time and eternity are one, that both life and death are
meaningful. Faith is the knowledge that man is creature—not autonomous,
not the master, not the end, not the center—and yet responsible and
free. It is the acceptance of man’s essential loneliness, to be overcome
by the certainty that God is always with man, even “unto the hour of our
death.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Salvation by society has always failed in the end. Find
a purpose that sustains you both in society and as a human being.</p>

<h4 id="december-return-of-the-demons">26 December Return of the
Demons</h4>
<p>If freedom is incompatible with security, the masses will decide for
security.</p>
<p>T he masses, then, have become prepared to abandon freedom if this
promises to reestablish the rationality of the world. If freedom is
incompatible with equality, they will give up freedom. If it is
incompatible with security, they will decide for security. To be free or
not has become a secondary question, since the freedom available does
not help to banish the demons. Since the “free” society is the one that
is threatened by the demons, it seems more than plausible to blame
freedom and to expect delivery from despair through the abandonment of
freedom.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The passage refers to the embrace by Europe of Nazism
to escape the demons of war and depression. Why will society be more
likely to embrace complete regimentation and totalitarianism in the
absence of strong institutions?</p>
<p>The End of Economic Man</p>
<h4 id="december-integrating-the-economic-and-social">27 December
Integrating the Economic and Social</h4>
<p>It is this absence of a functioning industrial society, able to
integrate our industrial reality, that underlies the crises of our
times.</p>
<p>M an in his social and political existence must have a functioning
society just as he must have air to breathe in his biological existence.
However, the fact that man has to have a society does not necessarily
mean that he has it. Nobody calls the mass of unorganized, panicky,
stampeding humanity in a shipwreck a “society.” There is no society,
though there are human beings in a group. Actually, the panic is
directly due to the breakdown of a society; and the only way to overcome
it is by restoring a society with social values, social discipline,
social power, and social relationships.</p>
<p>Social life cannot function without a society; but it is conceivable
that it does not function at all. The evidence of the last twenty-five
years of Western civilization hardly entitles us to say that our social
life functioned so well as to make out a prima-facie case for the
existence of a functioning society.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The passage above was written during World War II. It
recognized that after centuries of industrial advance there had not been
a similar advance in other institutions of society. Should the economic
dimension of society ever take supremacy over the human, social, and
political dimensions?</p>
<p>The Future of Industrial Man</p>
<h4 id="december-the-family-managed-business">28 December The
Family-Managed Business</h4>
<p>The majority of businesses everywhere are family controlled and
family managed.</p>
<p>T he majority of businesses everywhere—including the United States
and all other developed countries—are family controlled and family
managed. And family management is by no means confined to small and
medium-sized firms—families run some of the world’s largest companies.
DuPont, controlled and managed by family members for 170 years (since
its founding in 1802 until professional management took over in the
mid-1970s), grew into the world’s largest chemical company. And two
centuries after a still obscure coin dealer began to send out his sons
to establish banks in Europe’s capitals, financial firms bearing the
Rothschild name and run by Rothschilds are still among the world’s
premier private bankers.</p>
<p>Yet management books and management courses deal almost entirely with
the publicly owned and professionally managed company—they rarely as
much as mention the family-managed business. Of course, there is no
difference whatever between professionally managed and family-managed
businesses in respect to all functional work: research or marketing or
accounting. But with respect to management, the family business requires
its own and very different rules. These rules have to be stringently
observed. Otherwise, the family-managed business will not survive, let
alone prosper.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Less than 30 percent of family-owned companies survive
into the second generation, while only 10 percent make it to the third
generation, and just 4 percent to the fourth generation (Family
Magazine, Web site, June 2004). Speculate as to why family businesses
have such difficulty transitioning from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Managing in a Time of Great Change</p>
<h4 id="december-rules-for-the-family-managed-business">29 December
Rules for the Family-Managed Business</h4>
<p>The controlling word in “family-managed business” is not
“family.”</p>
<p>It has to be “business.”</p>
<p>T he first rule is that family members do not work in the business
unless they are at least as able as any nonfamily employee, and work at
least as hard. The second rule is equally simple: No matter how many
family members are in the company’s management, and how effective they
are, one top job is always filled by an outsider who is not a member of
the family. Typically, this is either the financial executive or the
head of research—the two positions in which technical qualifications are
most important. Rule three is that family-managed businesses, except
perhaps for the very smallest ones, increasingly need to staff key
positions with nonfamily professionals. The knowledge and expertise
needed, whether in manufacturing or in marketing, in finance, in
research, in human resource management, have become far too great to be
satisfied by any but the most competent family member.</p>
<p>Even the family-managed business that faithfully observes the
preceding three rules tends to get into trouble—and often breaks up—over
management succession. Then what the business needs and what the family
wants tend to collide. There is only one solution: Entrust the
succession decision to an outsider who is neither part of the family nor
part of the business.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Get to know the top management of a family-owned
business. Ask members how they plan to handle the problem of management
succession “into the next generation.” Determine whether the plans are
being driven by business issues or family issues, or by a combination of
the two.</p>

Innovations for Maximum Opportunities</h4>
<p>What is lacking to make effective what is already possible?</p>
<p>T he characteristic of the innovator is the ability to envisage as a
system what to others are unrelated, separate elements. It is the
successful attempt to find and to provide the smallest missing part that
will convert already existing elements. To find areas where innovation
would create maximum opportunities, one asks: “What is lacking to make
effective what is already possible? What one small step would transform
our economic results? What small change would alter the capacity of the
whole of our resources?”</p>
<p>To describe the need is not to satisfy it. But describing the need
gives a specification for the desirable results. Whether they are likely
to be obtained can be decided. Innovation is applicable to finding
business potential and to making the future.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Ask yourself the three questions above.</p>
<p>Managing for Results</p>
<h4 id="december-from-data-to-information-literacy">31 December From
Data to Information Literacy</h4>
<p>The executive and the knowledge worker have only one
tool—information.</p>
<p>I nformation is what holds an organization together and information
is what makes individual knowledge workers effective. Enterprises and
individuals will have to learn what information they need and how to get
it. They will have to learn how to organize information as their key
resource.</p>
<p>In moving from data literacy to information literacy, you need to
answer two principal questions: “What information does my enterprise
need?” and “What information do I need?” To answer these questions you
have to rethink:</p>
<p>What your job is, and what it should be</p>
<p>What your contribution is, or should be</p>
<p>What the fundamentals are of your organization</p>
<p>You will need three different types of information, each with its own
concepts. The three primary types of information are: external
information, internal information, and cross-organizational information.
Your success and the success of your organization depend upon getting
these answers right.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Answer these questions: “What is my job? What should be
my contribution?” and “What are the fundamentals of the organization?”
Then answer: “What information does my organization need?” and “What
information do I need?”</p>

<p>From Data to Information Literacy (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="january-integrity-in-leadership">1 January Integrity in
Leadership</h4>
<p>The spirit of an organization is created from the top.</p>
<p>T he proof of the sincerity and seriousness of a management is
uncompromising emphasis on integrity of character. This, above all, has
to be symbolized in management’s “people” decisions. For it is character
through which leadership is exercised; it is character that sets the
example and is imitated. Character is not something one can fool people
about. The people with whom a person works, and especially subordinates,
know in a few weeks whether he or she has integrity or not. They may
forgive a person for a great deal: incompetence, ignorance, insecurity,
or bad manners. But they will not forgive a lack of integrity in that
person. Nor will they forgive higher management for choosing him.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise.
For the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an
organization is great in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top
people is great. If it decays, it does so because the top rots; as the
proverb has it, “Trees die from the top.” No one should ever be
appointed to a senior position unless top management is willing to have
his or her character serve as the model for subordinates.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Evaluate the character of the CEO and top management
when considering a job offer. Align yourself with people who have
integrity.</p>

<h4 id="january-identifying-the-future">2 January Identifying the
Future</h4>
<p>The important thing is to identify the “future that has already
happened.”</p>
<p>F uturists always measure their batting average by counting how many
things they have predicted that have come true. They never count how
many important things come true that they did not predict. Everything a
forecaster predicts may come to pass. Yet, he may not have seen the most
meaningful of the emergent realities or, worse still, may not have paid
attention to them. There is no way to avoid this irrelevancy in
forecasting, for the important and distinctive are always the result of
changes in values, perception, and goals, that is, in things that one
can divine but not forecast.</p>
<p>But the most important work of the executive is to identify the
changes that have already happened. The important challenge in society,
economics, politics, is to exploit the changes that have already
occurred and to use them as opportunities. The important thing is to
identify the “future that has already happened”—and to develop a
methodology for perceiving and analyzing these changes. A good deal of
this methodology is incorporated in my 1985 book Innovation and
Entrepreneurship, which shows how one systematically looks to the
changes in society, in demographics, in meaning, in science and
technology, as opportunities to make the future.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify the major trends in your market that have
already appeared. Write a page on their likely longevity and impact on
your life and organization.</p>

<h4 id="january-management-is-indispensable">3 January Management Is
Indispensable</h4>
<p>Whoever makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before
deserves better of mankind than any speculative philosopher or
metaphysical system builder.</p>
<p>M anagement will remain a basic and dominant institution perhaps as
long as Western civilization itself survives. For management is not only
grounded in the nature of the modern industrial system and in the needs
of modern business enterprise, to which an industrial system must
entrust its productive resources, both human and material. Management
also expresses the basic beliefs of modern Western society. It expresses
the belief in the possibility of controlling man’s livelihood through
the systematic organization of economic resources. It expresses the
belief that economic change can be made into the most powerful engine
for human betterment and social justice—that, as Jonathan Swift first
overstated it three hundred years ago, whoever makes two blades of grass
grow where only one grew before deserves better of mankind than any
speculative philosopher or metaphysical system builder.</p>
<p>Management—which is the organ of society specifically charged with
making resources productive, that is, with the responsibility for
organized economic advance—therefore reflects the basic spirit of the
modern age. It is, in fact, indispensable, and this explains why, once
begotten, it grew so fast and with so little opposition.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Come up with a few examples of why management, its
competence, its integrity, and its performance, is so decisive to the
free world.</p>
<p>The Practice of Management</p>
<h4 id="january-organizational-inertia">4 January Organizational
Inertia</h4>
<p>All organizations need a discipline that makes them face up to
reality.</p>
<p>A ll organizations need to know that virtually no program or activity
will perform effectively for a long time without modification and
redesign. Eventually every activity becomes obsolete. Among
organizations that ignore this fact, the worst offender is government.
Indeed, the inability to stop doing anything is the central disease of
government and a major reason why government today is sick. Hospitals
and universities are only a little better than government in getting rid
of yesterday.</p>
<p>Businessmen are just as sentimental about yesterday as bureaucrats.
They are just as likely to respond to the failure of a product or
program by doubling the efforts invested in it. But they are,
fortunately, unable to indulge freely in their predilections. They stand
under an objective discipline, the discipline of the market. They have
an objective outside measurement, profitability. And so they are forced
to slough off the unsuccessful and unproductive sooner or later. In
other organizations—government, hospitals, the military, and so
on—economics is only a restraint.</p>
<p>All organizations must be capable of change. We need concepts and
measurements that give to other kinds of organizations what the market
test and profitability yardstick give to business. Those tests and
yardsticks will be quite different.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make sure your nonprofit organization has rigorous
tests and yardsticks to measure performance.</p>

<h4 id="january-abandonment">5 January Abandonment</h4>
<p>There is nothing as difficult and as expensive, but also nothing as
futile, as trying to keep a corpse from stinking.</p>
<p>E ffective executives know that they have to get many things done
effectively. Therefore, they concentrate. And the first rule for the
concentration of executive efforts is to slough off the past that has
ceased to be productive. The first-class resources, especially those
scarce resources of human strength, are immediately pulled out and put
to work on the opportunities of tomorrow. If leaders are unable to
slough off yesterday, to abandon yesterday, they simply will not be able
to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>Without systematic and purposeful abandonment, an organization will
be overtaken by events. It will squander its best resources on things it
should never have been doing or should no longer do. As a result, it
will lack the resources, especially capable people, needed to exploit
the opportunities that arise. Far too few businesses are willing to
slough off yesterday, and as a result, far too few have resources
available for tomorrow.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Stop squandering resources on obsolete businesses and
free up your capable people to take advantage of new opportunities.</p>

<h4 id="january-practice-of-abandonment">6 January Practice of
Abandonment</h4>
<p>If we did not do this already, would we go into it now?</p>
<p>T he question has to be asked—and asked seriously—“If we did not do
this already, would we, knowing what we know, go into it now?” If the
answer is no, the reaction must be “What do we do now?”</p>
<p>In three cases the right action is always outright abandonment.
Abandonment is the right action if a product, service, market, or
process “still has a few years of life.” It is these dying products,
services, or processes that always demand the greatest care and the
greatest efforts. They tie down the most productive and ablest people.
But equally, a product, service, market, or process should be abandoned
if the only argument for keeping it is “It is fully written off.” For
management purposes there are no “cost-less assets.” There are only
“sunk costs.” The third case where abandonment is the right policy—and
the most important one—is the one where, for the sake of maintaining the
old or declining product, service, market, or process the new and
growing product, service, or process is being stunted or neglected.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Ask the questions posed above and if the answer is no,
make the tough choice to abandon a cherished business.</p>

<h4 id="january-knowledge-workers-asset-not-cost">7 January Knowledge
Workers: Asset Not Cost</h4>
<p>Management’s duty is to preserve the assets of the institution in its
care.</p>
<p>K nowledge workers own the means of production. It is the knowledge
between their ears. And it is a totally portable and enormous capital
asset. Because knowledge workers own their means of production, they are
mobile. Manual workers need the job much more than the job needs them.
It may still not be true for all knowledge workers that the organization
needs them more than they need the organization. But for most of them it
is a symbiotic relationship in which the two need each other in equal
measure.</p>
<p>Management’s duty is to preserve the assets of the institution in its
care. What does this mean when the knowledge of the individual knowledge
worker becomes an asset and, in more and more cases, the main asset of
an institution? What does this mean for personnel policy? What is needed
to attract and to hold the highest-producing knowledge workers? What is
needed to increase their productivity and to convert their increased
productivity into performance capacity for the organization?</p>

workers by treating them and their knowledge as the organization’s most
valuable assets.</p>

<h4 id="january-autonomy-in-knowledge-work">8 January Autonomy in
Knowledge Work</h4>
<p>Knowledge work requires both autonomy and accountability.</p>
<p>D emanding of knowledge workers that they define their own task and
its results is necessary because knowledge workers must be autonomous.
As knowledge varies among different people, even in the same field, each
knowledge worker carries his or her own unique set of knowledge. With
this specialized, unique knowledge, each worker should know more about
his or her specific area than anyone else in the organization. Indeed,
knowledge workers must know more about their areas than anyone else;
they are paid to be knowledgeable in their fields. What this means is
that once each knowledge worker has defined his or her own task and once
the work has been appropriately restructured, each worker should be
expected to work out his or her own course and to take responsibility
for it. Knowledge workers should be asked to think through their own
work plans and then to submit them. What am I going to focus on? What
results can be expected for which I should be held accountable? By what
deadline? Knowledge work requires both autonomy and accountability.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Write a work plan that includes your focus, desired
results, and deadline. Submit it to your boss.</p>

<p>Establishing a new corporate persona calls for a change in the

top management. In the half century after the Second World War, the
business corporation has brilliantly proven itself as an economic

Management as the Alternative to Tyranny</h4>
<p>The alternative to autonomous institutions that function and perform
is not freedom. It is totalitarian tyranny.</p>
<p>I f the institutions of our pluralist society of institutions do not
perform in responsible autonomy, we will not have individualism and a
society in which there is a chance for people to fulfill themselves. We
will, instead, impose on ourselves complete regimentation in which no
one will be allowed autonomy. We will have Stalinism rather than
participatory democracy, let alone the joyful spontaneity of doing one’s
own thing. Tyranny is the only alternative to strong, performing
autonomous institutions.</p>
<p>Tyranny substitutes one absolute boss for the pluralism of competing
institutions. It substitutes terror for responsibility. It does indeed
do away with the institutions, but only by submerging all of them in the
one all-embracing bureaucracy of the apparat. It does produce goods and
services, though only fitfully, wastefully, at a low level, and at an
enormous cost in suffering, humiliation, and frustration. To make our
institutions perform responsibly, autonomously, and on a high level of
achievement is thus the only safeguard of freedom and dignity in the
pluralist society of institutions. Performing, responsible management is
the alternative to tyranny and our only protection against it.</p>

know what events have already occurred that do not fit into their

<p>Intellectuals and scholars tend to believe that ideas come first,
which then lead to new political, social, economic, psychological

be learned and taught and, above all, into something that can be

the humanities and social sciences—on psychology and philosophy, on

Attitude</h4>
<p>The demands for a “managerial attitude” on the part of even the
lowliest worker is an innovation.</p>
<p>N o part of the productive resources of industry operates at a lower
efficiency than the human resources. The few enterprises that have been
able to tap this unused reservoir of human ability and attitude have
achieved spectacular increases in productivity and output. In the better
use of human resources lies the major opportunity for increasing
productivity in the great majority of enterprises—so that the management
of people should be the first and foremost concern of operating
managements, rather than the management of things and techniques, on
which attention has been focused so far.</p>

good example was President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s confidential adviser
in World War II, Harry Hopkins. A dying, almost a dead man for whom
every step was torment, he could work only a few hours every other day
or so. This forced him to cut out everything but truly vital matters. He
did not lose effectiveness thereby; on the contrary, he became as
Churchill called him once, “Lord Heart of the Matter” and accomplished
more than anyone else in wartime Washington. Roosevelt broke every rule
in the book to enable the dying Harry Hopkins to make his unique
contribution.</p>

<p>Above all management is responsible for producing results.</p>
<p>M anagement has to give direction to the institution it manages. It
has to think through the institution’s mission, has to set its
objectives, and has to organize resources for the results the
institution has to contribute. Management is, indeed, J. B. Say’s
“entrepreneur” and responsible for directing vision and resources toward
greatest results and contributions.</p>
<p>In performing these essential functions, management everywhere faces
the same problems. It has to organize work for productivity; it has to
lead the worker toward productivity and achievement. It is responsible
for the social impact of its enterprise. Above all, it is responsible
for producing the results—whether economic performance, student
learning, or patient care—for the sake of which each institution
exists.</p>

Management: The Central Social Function</h4>
<p>Noneconomic institutions need a yardstick that does for them what
profitability does for business.</p>
<p>N onbusiness institutions flock in increasing numbers to business
management to learn from it how to manage themselves. The hospital, the
armed service, the Catholic diocese, the civil service—all want to go to
school for business management.</p>
<p>This does not mean that business management can be transferred to
other, nonbusiness institutions. On the contrary, the first thing these
institutions have to learn from business management is that management
begins with the setting of objectives and that, therefore, noneconomic
institutions, such as a university or a hospital, will also need very
different management from that of a business. But these institutions are
right in seeing business management as the prototype. Business, far from
being exceptional, is simply the first of the species and the one we
have studied the most intensively. Noneconomic institutions need a
yardstick that does for them what profitability does for the business.
“Profitability,” in other words, rather than being the “exception” and
distinct from “human” or “social” needs, emerges, in the pluralist
society of organizations, as the prototype of the measurement needed by
every institution in order to be managed and manageable.</p>

<p>“By their fruits ye shall know them.”</p>
<p>S ociety in all developed countries has become a society of
organizations in which most, if not all, social tasks are being done in
and by an organization. Organizations do not exist for their own sake.
They are means: each society’s organ for the discharge of one social
task. The organization’s goal is a specific contribution to individual
and society. The test of its performance, unlike that of a biological
organism, therefore, always lies outside itself. This means that we must
know what “performance” means for this or that institution.</p>
<p>Each institution will be the stronger the more clearly it defines its
objectives. It will be more effective the more yardsticks and
measurements there are against which its performance can be appraised.
It will be more legitimate the more strictly it bases authority on
justification by performance. “By their fruits ye shall know them”—this

<h4 id="january-profits-function">21 January Profit’s Function</h4>
<p>Today’s profitable business will become tomorrow’s white

<p>J oseph Schumpeter insisted that innovation is the very essence of
economics and most certainly of a modern economy. Schumpeter’s Theory of
Economic Development makes profit fulfill an economic function. In the
economy of change and innovation, a profit, in contrast to Karl Marx’s
theory, is not a “surplus value” stolen from the workers. On the
contrary, it is the only source of jobs for workers and of labor income.
The theory of economic development shows that no one except the
innovator makes a genuine “profit”; and the innovator’s profit is always
quite short-lived.</p>
<p>But innovation, in Schumpeter’s famous phrase, is also “creative
destruction.” It makes obsolete yesterday’s capital equipment and
capital investment. The more an economy progresses, the more capital
formation will it therefore need. Thus, what the classical economist—or
the accountant or the stock exchange—considers “profit” is a genuine
cost, the cost of staying in business, the cost of a future in which
nothing is predictable except that today’s profitable business will
become tomorrow’s white elephant.</p>

<p>I do not accept the basic premise on which economics as a discipline
is based and without which it cannot be sustained. I do not accept that
the economic sphere is an independent sphere, let alone that it is the
dominant one. It is surely an important sphere. And as Bertolt Brecht
said, “first comes the belly and then morality”—and filling the belly is
what economics is all about in the main. I not only am willing but
insist that in all political and social decisions the economic costs are
calculated and taken into account. To talk only of “benefits,” I
consider irresponsible and bound to lead to disaster. And I believe in
free markets, having seen far too much of the alternative.</p>
<p>But still, for me the economic sphere is one sphere rather than the
sphere. Economic considerations are restraints rather than overriding
determinants. Economic wants and economic satisfactions are important
but not absolutes. Above all, economic activities, economic
institutions, economic rationality, are means to noneconomic (that is,
human or social) ends rather than ends in themselves. And this means
that I do not see economics as an autonomous “science.” In short, it
means that I am not an economist—something I have known since, in 1934
as a young economist in a London merchant bank, I sat in the John
Maynard Keynes seminar in Cambridge. I suddenly realized that Keynes was
interested in the behavior of commodities, while I was interested in the

back from the actual results to these anticipations. This very soon
shows him what he did well and what his strengths are. It also shows him
what he has to learn and what habits he has to change. Finally it shows
him what he is not gifted for and cannot do well. I have followed this
method myself, now for fifty years. It brings out what one’s strengths
are—and this is the most important thing an individual can know about
himself or herself. It brings out where improvement is needed and what
kind of improvement is needed. Finally, it brings out what an individual

fundamental characteristic—skills change very, very slowly. Knowledge,
however, changes itself. It makes itself obsolete, and very rapidly. A
knowledge worker becomes obsolescent if he or she does not go back to
school every three or four years.</p>
<p>This not only means that the equipment of learning, of knowledge, of
skill, of experience that one acquires early is not sufficient for our
present life time and working time. People change over such a long time
span. They become different persons with different needs, different
abilities, different perspectives, and, therefore, with a need to
“reinvent themselves.” I quite intentionally use a stronger word than
“revitalize.” If you talk of fifty years of working life—and this, I
think, is going to be increasingly the norm—you have to reinvent

discipline itself boasts an old and distinguished lineage. Its greatest
document is Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. But no one is
as close to me in temperament, concepts, and approach as the
mid-Victorian Englishman Walter Bagehot. Living (as I have) in an age of
great social change, Bagehot first saw the emergence of new
institutions: civil service and cabinet government, as cores of a
functioning democracy, and banking as the center of a functioning
economy.</p>
<p>A hundred years after Bagehot, I was first to identify management as
the new social institution of the emerging society of organizations and,
a little later, to spot the emergence of knowledge as the new central
resource, and knowledge workers as the new ruling class of a society
that is not only “postindustrial” but postsocialist and, increasingly,
postcapitalist. As it had been for Bagehot, for me too the tension
between the need for continuity and the need for innovation and change
was central to society and civilization. Thus, I know what Bagehot meant
when he said that he saw himself sometimes as a liberal Conservative and
sometimes as a conservative Liberal but never as a “conservative

Controlled Experiment in Mismanagement</h4>
<p>The story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his company is what one might call a controlled experiment in
mismanagement.</p>
<p>T he story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his company under his grandson, Henry Ford II, has been told many times.
But it is not commonly realized that this dramatic story is far more
than a story of personal success and failure. It is, above all, what one
might call a controlled experiment in mismanagement.</p>
<p>The first Ford failed because of his firm conviction that a business
did not need managers and management. All it needed, he believed, was
the owner-entrepreneur with his “helpers.” The only difference between
Ford and most of his business contemporaries, in the U.S. as well as
abroad, was that, as in everything else he did, Henry Ford stuck
uncompromisingly to his convictions. The way he applied them—for
example, by firing or sidelining any one of his “helpers,” no matter how
able, who dared act as a “manager,” make a decision, or take action
without orders from Ford—can only be described as a test of a hypothesis
that ended up by fully disproving it. In fact, what makes the Ford story
unique—but also important—is that Ford could test the hypothesis, in
part because he lived so long and in part because he had a billion
dollars to back his convictions. Ford’s failure was not the result of
personality or temperament but, first and foremost, the result of his
refusal to accept managers and management as necessary and as grounded
in task and function rather than in “delegation” from the “boss.”</p>

economy or to our society than to attempt to professionalize management
by licensing managers, for instance, or by limiting access to management
positions to people with a special academic degree. On the contrary, the
test of good management is whether it enables the successful performer
to do her work. And any serious attempt to make management “scientific”
or a “profession” is bound to lead to the attempt to eliminate those
“disturbing nuisances,” the unpredictabilities of business life—its

persuasion, still believes reality to be. “What is” differs totally from
what both the Right and the Left believe “ought to be.” The greatest and
most dangerous turbulence today results from the collision between the
delusions of the decision makers—whether in governments, in the top
managements of businesses, or in union leadership—and the realities.</p>
<p>But a time of turbulence is also one of great opportunity for those
who can understand, accept, and exploit the new realities. One constant
theme is, therefore, the need for the decision maker in the individual
enterprise to face up to reality and resist the temptation of what
“everybody knows,” the temptations of the certainties of yesterday,
which are about to become the deleterious superstitions of tomorrow. To
manage in turbulent times, therefore, means to face up to the new

engineering of work. This led to the productivity revolution. The
Productivity Revolution has become a victim of its own success. From now
on, what matters is the productivity of nonmanual workers. And that
requires applying knowledge to knowledge.</p>
<p>But knowledge is now also being applied systematically and
purposefully to define what new knowledge is needed, whether it is
feasible, and what has to be done to make knowledge effective. It is
being applied, in other words, to systematic innovation. This third

<p>T he search for knowledge, as well as the teaching thereof, has
traditionally been dissociated from application. Both have been
organized by subject, that is, according to what appeared to be the
logic of knowledge itself. The faculties and departments of the
university, its degrees, its specializations, indeed the entire
organization of higher learning, have been subject-focused. They have
been, to use the language of the experts on organization, based upon
“product,” rather than on “market” or “end use.” Now we are increasingly
organizing knowledge and the search for it around areas of application
rather than around the subject areas of disciplines. Interdisciplinary
work has grown everywhere.</p>
<p>This is a symptom of the shift in the meaning of knowledge from an
end in itself to a resource, that is, a means to some result. Knowledge
as the central energy of a modern society exists altogether in
application and when it is put to work. Work, however, cannot be defined

population will cause an even greater upheaval than the growing number
of older people, if only because nothing like this has happened since
the dying centuries of the Roman Empire. In every single developed
country, but also in China and Brazil, the birth rate is now well below
the replacement rate of 2.2 live births per woman of reproductive age.
Politically, this means that immigration will become an important—and
highly divisive—issue in all rich countries. It will cut across all
traditional political alignments.</p>

<p>Successful transnational companies see themselves as separate,

<p>M ost companies doing international business today are still
organized as traditional multinationals. But the transformation into
transnational companies has begun, and it is moving fast. The products
or services may be the same, but the structure is fundamentally
different. In a transnational company there is only one economic unit,
the world. Selling, servicing, public relations, and legal affairs are
local. But parts, machines, planning, research, finance, marketing,
pricing, and management are conducted in contemplation of the world
market. One of America’s leading engineering companies, for instance,
makes one critical part for all its forty-three plants worldwide in one
location outside of Antwerp, Belgium—and nothing else. It has organized
product development for the entire world in three places and quality
control in four. For this company, national boundaries have largely
become irrelevant.</p>
<p>The transnational company is not totally beyond the control of
national governments. It must adapt to them. But these adaptations are

<h4 id="february-the-educated-person">7 February The Educated
Person</h4>
<p>The educated person needs to bring knowledge to bear on the present,
not to mention molding the future.</p>
<p>I n his 1943 novel, published in English as Magister Ludi (1949),
Hermann Hesse anticipated the sort of world the humanists want—and its
failure. The book depicts a brotherhood of intellectuals, artists, and
humanists who live a life of splendid isolation, dedicated to the Great
Tradition, its wisdom and its beauty. But the hero, the most
accomplished Master of the Brotherhood, decides in the end to return to
the polluted, vulgar, turbulent, strife-torn, moneygrubbing reality—for
his values are only fool’s gold unless they have relevance to the
world.</p>
<p>Postcapitalist society needs the educated person even more than any
earlier society did, and access to the great heritage of the past will
have to be an essential element. But liberal education must enable the
person to understand reality and master it.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Read a book on politics, history, or anything that
interests you. What did you learn? How can you put that knowledge to
work?</p>

<h4 id="february-balance-continuity-and-change">8 February Balance
Continuity and Change</h4>
<p>Precisely because change is a constant, the foundations have to be
extra strong.</p>
<p>T he more an institution is organized to be a change leader, the more
it will need to establish continuity internally and externally, the more
it will need to balance rapid change and continuity. One way is to make
partnership in change the basis of continuing relationships. Balancing
change and continuity requires continuous work on information. Nothing
disrupts continuity and corrupts relationships more than poor or
unreliable information. It has to become routine for any enterprise to
ask at any change, even the most minor one: “Who needs to be informed of
this?” And this will become more and more important as more enterprises
come to rely on people working together without actually working
together—that is, on people using the new technologies of information.
Above all, there is need for continuity in respect to the fundamentals
of the enterprise: its mission, its values, its definition of
performance and results.</p>
<p>Finally, the balance between change and continuity has to be built
into compensation, recognition, and rewards. We will have to learn,
similarly, that an organization will have to reward continuity—for
instance, by considering people who deliver continuing improvement to be
as valuable to the organization, and as deserving of recognition and
reward, as the genuine innovator.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: When you make a decision or a change, ask yourself,
“Who needs to be informed of this?”</p>

<h4 id="february-organizations-destabilize-communities">9 February
Organizations Destabilize Communities</h4>
<p>In its culture, the organization always transcends the community.</p>
<p>M odern organizations have to operate in a community. Their results
are in the community. Yet the organization cannot submerge itself in the
community or subordinate itself to that community. Its “culture” has to
transcend community. Companies on which local communities depend for
employment close their factories or replace grizzled model-makers who
have spent years learning their craft with twenty-five-year-old “whiz
kids” who know computer simulation. Every one of such changes upsets the
community. Every one is perceived as “unfair.” Every one
destabilizes.</p>
<p>It is the nature of the task that determines the culture of an
organization, rather than the community in which that task is being
performed. Each organization’s value system is determined by its task.
Every hospital, every school, every business, has to believe that what
it is doing is an essential contribution on which all the others in the
community depend in the last analysis. To perform its task successfully,
it has to be organized and managed the same way. If an organization’s
culture clashes with the values of its community, the organization’s
culture will prevail—or else the organization will not be able to make
its social contribution.</p>

Modern Organization Must Be a Destabilizer</h4>
<p>Only a society in dynamic disequilibrium has stability and
cohesion.</p>
<p>S ociety, community, and family are all conserving institutions. They
try to maintain stability and to prevent, or at least to slow, change.
And yet we also know that theories, values, and all the artifacts of
human minds do age and rigidify, becoming obsolete, becoming
afflictions.</p>
<p>Yet “revolutions” every generation, as was recommended by Thomas
Jefferson, are not the solution. We know that “revolution” is not
achievement and the new dawn. It results from senile decay, from the
bankruptcy of ideas and institutions, from a failure of self-renewal.
The only way in which an institution—whether a government, a university,
a business, a labor union, an army—can maintain continuity is by
building systematic, organized innovation into its very structure.
Institutions, systems, policies, eventually outlive themselves, as do
products, processes, and services. They do it when they accomplish their
objectives, and they do it when they fail to accomplish their
objectives. Innovation and entrepreneurship are thus needed in society
as much as in the economy, in public service institutions as much as in
business. The modern organization must be a destabilizer; it must be
organized for innovation.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: When is the last time you created or helped create a
new product or service? Were you just copying a competitor, or did you

Management</h4>
<p>Management is about human beings.</p>
<p>T he task of management is to make people capable of joint
performance, to make their strengths effective and their weaknesses
irrelevant. This is what organization is all about, and it is the reason
that management is the critical, determining factor.</p>
<p>Management must be built on communications and on individual
responsibility. All members need to think through what they aim to
accomplish—and make sure their associates know and understand that aim.
All have to think through what they owe to others—and make sure that
others understand. All have to think through what they, in turn, need
from others—and make sure others know what is expected of them.</p>
<p>Management must enable the enterprise and each of its members to grow
and to develop as needs and opportunities change.</p>

<h4 id="february-role-of-the-bystander">12 February Role of the
Bystander</h4>
<p>…the bystander sees things neither actor nor audience notices.</p>
<p>B ystanders have no history of their own. They are on the stage but
are not part of the action. They are not even audience. The fortunes of
the play and every actor in it depend on the audience, whereas the
reaction of the bystander has no effect except on himself. But standing
in the wings—much like the fireman in the theater—the bystander sees
things neither actor nor audience notices. Above all, he sees
differently from the way actors or audience see. Bystanders reflect, and
reflection is a prism rather than a mirror; it refracts.</p>
<p>To watch and think for yourself is highly commendable. But “to shock
people by shouting strange views from the rooftops is not.” The
admonition is well taken. But I have rarely heeded it.</p>

<h4 id="february-the-nature-of-freedom">13 February The Nature of
Freedom</h4>
<p>Freedom is never a release and always a responsibility.</p>
<p>F reedom is not fun. It is not the same as individual happiness, nor
is it security or peace or progress. It is a responsible choice. Freedom
is not so much a right as a duty. Real freedom is not freedom from
something; that would be license. It is freedom to choose between doing
or not doing something, to act one way or another, to hold one belief or
the opposite. It is not “fun” but the heaviest burden laid on man: to
decide his own individual conduct as well as the conduct of society and
to be responsible for both decisions.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: List specific goals for your work. Think of goals that
will meet your need for personal fulfillment, while also helping your
boss meet his or her performance objectives. Sell these goals to your
boss and keep the boss informed on your progress.</p>

<h4 id="february-demands-on-political-leadership">14 February Demands on
Political Leadership</h4>
<p>Beware charisma.</p>
<p>C harisma is “hot” today. There is an enormous amount of talk about
it, and an enormous number of books are written on the charismatic
leader. But, the desire for charisma is a political death wish. No
century has seen more leaders with more charisma than the twentieth
century, and never have political leaders done greater damage than the
four giant leaders of the twentieth century: Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler,
and Mao. What matters is not charisma. What matters is whether the
leader leads in the right direction or misleads. The constructive
achievements of the twentieth century were the work of completely
uncharismatic people. The two military men who guided the Allies to
victory in World War II were Dwight Eisenhower and George Marshall. Both
were highly disciplined, highly competent, and deadly dull.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest cause for hope, for optimism is that to the new
majority, the knowledge workers, the old politics make no sense at all.
But proven competence does.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Seek out the most competent people in your
organization, not necessarily those with the most charisma.</p>

<h4 id="february-salvation-by-society">15 February Salvation by
Society</h4>
<p>The end of the belief in salvation by society may even lead to a
return to individual responsibility.</p>
<p>S urely the collapse of Marxism as a creed signifies the end of the
belief in salvation by society. What will emerge next, we cannot know;
we can only hope and pray. Perhaps nothing beyond stoic resignation?
Perhaps a rebirth of traditional religion, addressing itself to the
needs and challenges of the person in the knowledge society? The
explosive growth of what I call “pastoral” Christian churches in
America—Protestant, Catholic, nondenominational—might be a portent. But
so might the resurgence of fundamentalist Islam. For the young people in
the Muslim world who now so fervently embrace Islamic fundamentalism
would, forty years ago, have been equally fervent Marxists. Or will
there be new religions? Still, redemption, self-renewal, spiritual
growth, goodness, and virtue—the “New Man,” to use the traditional
term—are likely to be seen again as existential rather than social goals
or political prescriptions. The end of the belief in salvation by
society surely marks an inward turning. It makes possible renewed
emphasis on the individual, the person. It may even lead—at least we can
so hope—to a return to individual responsibility.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The human resources department is not responsible for
taking care of you; you are. Know what you are good at, make sure your
results are equal to your expectations, and manage yourself. Continually
ask yourself, “What should MY contribution be?”</p>
<p>Post-Capitalist Society</p>
<h4 id="february-need-for-a-harmony-of-interests">16 February Need for a
Harmony of Interests</h4>
<p>The demand for harmony does not mean that society should abandon its
right to limit the exercise of economic power on the part of the
corporation.</p>
<p>E conomic purpose does not mean that the corporation should be free
from social obligations. On the contrary it should be so organized as to
fulfill, automatically, its social obligations in the very act of
seeking its own self-interest. An individual society based on the
corporation can function only if the corporation contributes to social
stability and to the achievement of social aims independent of the
goodwill or the social consciousness of individual corporation
managements.</p>
<p>At the same time, the demand for harmony does not mean that society
should abandon its needs and aims and its right to limit the exercise of
economic power on the part of the corporation. On the contrary, it is a
vital function of rulership to set the frame within which institutions
and individuals act. But, society must be organized so that there is no
temptation to enact, in the name of social stability or social beliefs,
measures that are inimical to the survival and stability of its
representative institutions.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Until early in 2004 many well-known mutual funds
permitted large customers to trade funds after the close of business,
which gave these large customers the advantage of knowing the sell price
at the time of sale, a benefit unavailable to the common shareholder.
Send an e-mail to the chairman of a mutual fund in which you own shares
and ask for proof that you were not harmed by this practice.</p>

<h4 id="february-social-purpose-for-society">17 February Social Purpose
for Society</h4>
<p>The absence of a basic social purpose for industrial society
constitutes the core of our problem.</p>
<p>W e already have given up the belief that economic progress is always
and by necessity the highest goal. And once we have given up economic
achievement as the highest value and have come to regard it as no more
than one goal among many, we have, in effect, given up economic activity
as the basis for social life. The abandonment of the economic as the
socially constructive sphere has gone further. Western society has given
up the belief that man is fundamentally Economic Man, that his motives
are economic motives, and that his fulfillment lies in economic success
and economic rewards.</p>
<p>We have to develop a free and functioning society on the basis of a
new concept of man’s nature and of the purpose and fulfillment of
society. A basic ethical concept of social life must be developed. It
lies in the philosophical or metaphysical field.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Define an organizational purpose that goes beyond
next-quarter financial results and goes beyond maximization of
shareholder wealth. Define a purpose that employees can believe in and
challenges them to contribute their best work.</p>

<h4 id="february-reinventing-government">18 February Reinventing
Government</h4>
<p>Government has to regain a modicum of performance capacity.</p>
<p>G overnments have become powerless against the onslaught of
special-interest groups, have, indeed, become powerless to govern—to
make decisions and to enforce them. The new tasks—protection of the
environment, stamping out private armies and international terrorism,
making arms control effective—all will require more rather than less
government. But they will require a different form of government.</p>
<p>Government has to regain a modicum of performance capacity. It has to
be turned around. To turn around any institution—whether a business, a
labor union, a university, a hospital, or a government—always requires
the same three steps:</p>
<p>Abandonment of the things that do not work, the things that have
never worked, the things that have outlived their usefulness and their
capacity to contribute.</p>
<p>Concentration on the things that do work, the things that produce
results, the things that improve the organization’s ability to
perform.</p>
<p>Analysis of the half-successes, the half-failures.</p>
<p>A turnaround requires abandoning whatever does not perform and doing
more of what does perform.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Can your business profit from government incompetence

Postal Service? If you work for government, improve your effectiveness
by concentrating on what works.</p>
<p>Post-Capitalist Society</p>
<h4 id="february-reprivatization">19 February Reprivatization</h4>
<p>The strongest argument for private enterprise is the function of
loss.</p>
<p>R eprivatization is a systematic policy of using the other,
nongovernmental institutions of the society of organizations for the
actual “doing,” that is, the performance, operation, execution of tasks
that flowed to government because the original private institution of
society, the family, could not discharge them. What makes business
especially appropriate for reprivatization is that, of all social
institutions, it is predominately an organ of innovation. All other
institutions were originally created to prevent, or at least to slow
down, change. They become innovators only by necessity and most
reluctantly.</p>
<p>Business has two advantages where government has a major weakness.
Business can abandon an activity. Indeed, it is forced to do so if it
operates in a market. What’s more: of all institutions, business is the
only one society will let disappear. The second strength of business:
alone among all institutions, it has the test of performance. The
consumer always asks: “And what will the product do for me tomorrow?” If
the answer is “nothing,” he will see its manufacturer disappear without
the slightest regret. And so will the investor. The strongest argument
for “private enterprise” is not the function of profit. The strongest
argument is the function of loss. Because of it business is the most
adaptable and the most flexible of the institutions around.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: First prisons, now wars are being manned by private
companies. Make a list of which sectors will privatize next and
determine how you can benefit.</p>

Management and Economic Development</h4>
<p>It can be said that there are no “underdeveloped countries.”</p>
<p>There are only “undermanaged” ones.</p>
<p>M anagement creates economic and social development. Economic and
social development is the result of management. It can be said, without
too much oversimplification, that there are no “underdeveloped
countries.” There are only “undermanaged” ones. Japan a hundred and
forty years ago was an underdeveloped country by every material
measurement. But it very quickly produced management of great
competence, indeed, of excellence.</p>
<p>This means that management is the prime mover and that development is
a consequence. All our experience in economic development proves this.
Wherever we have only capital, we have not achieved development. In the
few cases where we have been able to generate management energies, we
have generated rapid development. Development, in other words, is a
matter of human energies rather than of economic wealth. And the
generation and direction of human energies is the task of
management.</p>

<h4 id="february-failure-of-central-planning">21 February Failure of
Central Planning</h4>
<p>Any society in the era of the new technology would perish miserably
were it to run the economy by central planning.</p>
<p>T he new technology will greatly extend the management area; many
people now considered rank-and-file will have to become capable of doing
management work. And on all levels the demands on the manager’s
responsibility and competence, her vision, her capacity to choose
between alternate risks, her economic knowledge and skill, her ability
to manage managers and to manage worker and work, her competence in
making decisions, will be greatly increased.</p>
<p>The new technology will demand the utmost in decentralization. Any
society in the era of the new technology would perish miserably were it
to attempt to get rid of free management of autonomous enterprise so as
to run the economy by central planning. And so would any enterprise that
attempted to centralize responsibility and decision making at the top.
It would go under like the great reptiles of the saurian age who
attempted to control a huge body by a small, centralized nervous system
that could not adapt to rapid change in the environment.</p>

<p>The Practice of Management</p>
<h4 id="february-the-pork-barrel-state">22 February The Pork-Barrel
State</h4>
<p>Government becomes the master of civil society, able to mold and
shape it.</p>
<p>U ntil World War I, no government in history was ever able to obtain
from its people more than a very small fraction of the country’s
national income, perhaps 5 or 6 percent. As long as revenues were known
to be limited, governments, whether democracies or absolute monarchies
like that of the Russian czars, operated under extreme restraints. These
restraints made it impossible for the government to act as either a
social or an economic agency. But since World War I—and even more
noticeably since World War II—the budgeting process has meant, in
effect, saying yes to everything. Under the new dispensation, which
assumes that there are no economic limits to the revenues it can obtain,
government becomes the master of civil society, able to mold and shape
it. Through the power of the purse, it can shape society in the
politician’s image. Worst of all, the fiscal state has become a
“pork-barrel state.”</p>
<p>The pork-barrel state thus increasingly undermines the foundations of
a free society. The elected representatives fleece their constituents to
enrich special-interest groups and thereby to buy their votes. This is a
denial of the concept of citizenship—and is beginning to be seen as
such.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Draft a ballot petition for a balanced-budget amendment
in your city including a limit to annual increases in property taxes,
like Proposition 13 in California. Then go to city council meetings and

<p>The new tasks will require a different form of government.</p>
<p>T he new tasks all will require more rather than less government. But
they will require a different form of government. The greatest threat is
damage to the human habitat. Second only to caring for the environment
is the growing need for transnational action and institutions to abort
the return of private armies and stamp out terrorism.</p>
<p>Terrorism is all the more threatening as very small groups can
effectively hold even large countries to ransom. A nuclear bomb can
easily be put into a locker or a postal box in any major city and
exploded by remote control; so could a bacterial bomb, containing enough
anthrax spores to kill thousands of people and to contaminate a big
city’s water supply, making it un-inhabitable. What is needed to control
the threat of terrorism is action that goes beyond any one sovereign
state. The design of the necessary agencies is still ahead of us; so is
the length of time it will take any of them to develop. It may well take
major catastrophes to make national governments willing to accept
subordination to such institutions and their decisions.</p>

the members of the industrial system are given the social status and
function that they lack today, our society will disintegrate. The masses
will not revolt; they will sink into lethargy; they will flee the

of the Corporation</h4>
<p>What does capitalism mean when knowledge governs rather than
money?</p>
<p>W ithin a fairly short period of time, we will face the problem of
the governance of corporations again. We will have to redefine the
purpose of the employing organization and of its management, to satisfy
both the legal owners, such as shareholders, and the owners of the human
capital that gives the organization its wealth-producing power, that is,
the knowledge workers. For increasingly the ability of organizations to
survive will come to depend on their “comparative advantage” in making
the knowledge worker productive. And the ability to attract and hold the
best of the knowledge workers is the first and most fundamental
precondition.</p>
<p>What does capitalism mean when knowledge governs rather than money?
And what do “free markets” mean when knowledge workers are the true
assets? Knowledge workers can be neither bought nor sold. They do not
come with a merger or an acquisition. It is certain that the emergence
of the knowledge worker will bring about fundamental changes in the very
structure and nature of the economic system.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: What percentage of your workforce consists of people
whose work requires advanced schooling? Tell these people you value
their contributions and ask them to participate in decisions where their

<h4 id="february-balancing-three-corporate-dimensions">26 February
Balancing Three Corporate Dimensions</h4>
<p>Shareholder sovereignty is bound to flounder. It is a fair-weather
model.</p>
<p>A n important task for top management in the next society’s
corporation will be to balance the three dimensions of the corporation:
as an economic organization, as a human organization, and as an
increasingly important social organization. Each of the three models of
the corporation developed in the past half-century stressed one of these
dimensions and subordinated the other two. The German model of the
“social market economy” put the emphasis on the social dimension; the
Japanese one, on the human dimension; and the American one, on the
economic dimension.</p>
<p>None of the three is adequate on its own. The German model achieved
both economic success and social stability, but at the price of high
unemployment and dangerous labor-market rigidity. The Japanese model was
strikingly successful for many years, but faltered at the first serious
challenge; indeed, it was a major obstacle to recovery from Japan’s
recession of the 1990s. Shareholder sovereignty is also bound to
flounder. It is a fair-weather model that works well only in times of
prosperity. Obviously the enterprise can fulfill its human and social
functions only if it prospers as a business. But now that knowledge
workers are becoming the key employees, a company also needs to be a
desirable employer to be successful.</p>

<p>Managing in the Next Society</p>
<h4 id="february-defining-business-purpose-and-mission">27 February
Defining Business Purpose and Mission</h4>
<p>What is our business?</p>
<p>N othing may seem simpler or more obvious than to know what a
company’s business is. A steel mill makes steel; a railroad runs trains
to carry freight and passengers; an insurance company underwrites fire
risks; a bank lends money. Actually, “What is our business?” is almost
always a difficult question and the right answer is usually anything but
obvious.</p>
<p>A business is not defined by the company’s name, statutes, or
articles of incorporation. It is defined by the want the customer
satisfies when she buys a product or a service. To satisfy the customer
is the mission and purpose of every business. The question “What is our
business?” can, therefore, be answered only by looking at the business
from the outside, from the point of view of the customer and the market.
What the customer sees, thinks, believes, and wants, at any given time,
must be accepted by management as an objective fact and must be taken as
seriously as the reports of the salesperson, the tests of the engineer,
or the figures of the accountant. And management must make a conscious
effort to get answers from the customer herself rather than attempt to
read her mind.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Talk to one customer every day this week. Ask them how
they see your company, what they think of it, what kind of company they
believe it is and what they want from it. Use this feedback to better
define your company’s mission.</p>

Defining Business Purpose and Mission:</h4>
<p>The Customer</p>
<p>Who is the customer?</p>
<p>“W ho is the customer?” is the first and the crucial question in
defining business purpose and business mission. It is not an easy, let
alone an obvious question. How it is being answered determines, in large
measure, how the business defines itself. The consumer—that is, the
ultimate user of a product or a service—is always a customer.</p>
<p>Most businesses have at least two customers. Both have to buy if
there is to be a sale. The manufacturers of branded consumer goods
always have two customers at the very least: the housewife and the
grocer. It does not do much good to have the housewife eager to buy if
the grocer does not stock the brand. Conversely, it does not do much
good to have the grocer display merchandise advantageously and give it
shelf space if the housewife does not buy. To satisfy only one of these
customers without satisfying the other means that there is no
performance.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Take one product or service that you are responsible
for and determine how many kinds of customers you have for it. Then
figure out if you are satisfying all of your different kinds of
customers, or if you are ignoring some category(ies) of customers.</p>
<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<p>29 February Understanding What the Customer Buys</p>
<p>What does the customer consider value?</p>
<p>T he final question needed in order to come to grips with business
purpose and business mission is: “What is value to the customer?” It may
be the most important question. Yet it is the one least often asked. One
reason is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer. Value
is what they, in their business, define as quality. But this is almost
always the wrong definition. The customer never buys a product. By
definition the customer buys the satisfaction of a want. He buys
value.</p>
<p>For the teenage girl, for instance, value in a shoe is high fashion.
It has to be “in.” Price is a secondary consideration and durability is
not value at all. For the same girl as a young mother, a few years
later, high fashion becomes a restraint. She will not buy something that
is quite unfashionable. But what she looks for is durability, price,
comfort and fit, and so on. The same shoe that represents the best buy
for the teenager is a very poor value for her slightly older sister.
What a company’s different customers consider value is so complicated
that it can be answered only by the customers themselves. Management
should not even try to guess at the answers—it should always go to the
customers in a systematic quest for them.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: What do your customers consider most valuable about the
product or service you provide? If you don’t know, find out. If you do
know, ask your customers if you are delivering.</p>

<h4 id="march-the-change-leader">1 March The Change Leader</h4>
<p>The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create
it.</p>
<p>O ne cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it. In a period
of upheavals, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm. To
be sure, it is painful and risky, and above all it requires a great deal
of very hard work. But unless it is seen as the task of the organization
to lead change, the organization will not survive. In a period of rapid
structural change, the only ones who survive are the change leaders. A
change leader sees change as an opportunity. A change leader looks for
change, knows how to find the right changes, and knows how to make them
effective both outside the organization and inside it. To make the
future is highly risky. It is less risky, however, than not to try to
make it. A goodly proportion of those attempting to will surely not
succeed. But predictably, no one else will.</p>

<h4 id="march-test-of-innovation">2 March Test of Innovation</h4>
<p>Measure innovations by what they contribute to market and
customer.</p>
<p>T he test of an innovation is whether it creates value. Innovation
means the creation of new value and new satisfaction for the customer. A
novelty only creates amusement. Yet, again and again, managements decide
to innovate for no other reason than that they are bored with doing the
same thing or making the same product day in and day out. The test of an
innovation, as well as the test of “quality,” is not “Do we like it?” It
is “Do customers want it and will they pay for it?”</p>
<p>Organizations measure innovations not by their scientific or
technological importance but by what they contribute to market and
customer. They consider social innovation to be as important as
technological innovation. Installment selling may have had a greater
impact on economics and markets than most of the great scientific
advances in this century.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify innovations in your organization that are
novelties versus those that are creating value. Did you launch the
novelties because you were bored with doing the same thing? If so, make
sure your next new product or service meets your customers’ needs.</p>

<h4 id="march-knowledge-external-to-the-enterprise">3 March Knowledge
External to the Enterprise</h4>
<p>The technologies that are likely to have the greatest impact on a
company and an industry are technologies outside its own field.</p>
<p>M any changes that have transformed enterprises have originated
outside the specific industry of that enterprise. Here are three notable
examples. The zipper was originally invented to close bales of heavy
goods, such as grain, particularly in seaports. Nobody thought of using
it for clothing. The clothing industry did not think it could replace
buttons. And the inventor never dreamed it would be successful in the
clothing industry.</p>
<p>Commercial paper (that is, short-term notes originated by nonbank
financial institutions) did not originate with banks, but had a
tremendous negative impact on them. Under U.S. law, commercial paper is
considered a security, which means that commercial banks cannot deal in
it. Because financial services companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill
Lynch, GE Capital, and so on, discovered this, they have largely
replaced commercial banks as the world’s most important and leading
financial institutions. Fiberglass cable, the invention that has
revolutionized the telephone industry, did not come out of the great
telephone research labs in the U.S., Japan, or Germany. It came, rather,
from a glass company, Corning.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify at least one change that has originated
outside your industry that either has transformed or has the potential
to transform your enterprise. Look for ideas in other industries that
can be used profitably in your industry.</p>

<h4 id="march-in-innovation-emphasize-the-big-idea">4 March In
Innovation, Emphasize the Big Idea</h4>
<p>Innovative ideas are like frogs’ eggs: of a thousand hatched, only
one or two survive to maturity.</p>
<p>T he innovative organization understands that innovation starts with
an idea. Ideas are somewhat like babies—they are born small, immature,
and shapeless. They are promise rather than fulfillment. In the
innovative organization executives do not say, “This is a damn-fool
idea.” Instead they ask, “What would be needed to make this embryonic,
half-baked, foolish idea into something that makes sense, that is
feasible, that is an opportunity for us?”</p>
<p>But an innovative organization also knows that the great majority of
ideas will turn out not to make sense. Executives in innovative
organizations therefore demand that people with ideas think through the
work needed to turn an idea into a product, a process, a business, or a
technology. They ask, “What work should we have to do and what would we
have to find out and learn before we can commit the company to this idea
of yours?” These executives know that it is as difficult and risky to
convert a small idea into successful reality as it is to make a major
innovation. They do not aim at “improvements” or “modifications” in
products or technology. They aim at innovating a new business.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make a list of your three best ideas. Then make a list
of the key pieces of information you need to know and the major work
that needs to be done before these ideas can blossom into a new
business. Now pursue the best idea, or if none is practical, start
again.</p>
<p>The Frontiers of Management</p>
<h4 id="march-managing-for-the-future">5 March Managing for the
Future</h4>
<p>Prediction of future events is futile.</p>
<p>T he starting point to know the future is the realization that there
are two different, though complementary, approaches:</p>
<p>Finding and exploiting the time lag between the appearance of a
discontinuity in the economy and society and its full impact—one might
call this anticipation of a future that has already happened.</p>
<p>Imposing on the yet unborn future a new idea that tries to give
direction and shape to what is to come. This one might call making the
future happen.</p>
<p>The future that has already happened is not within the present
business; it is outside: a change in society, knowledge, culture,
industry, or economic structure. It is, moreover, a major trend, a break
in the pattern rather than a variation within it. Looking for the future
that has already happened and anticipating its impacts introduces new
perception in the beholder. The need is to make oneself see it. What
then could or should be done is usually not too difficult to discover.
The opportunities are neither remote nor obscure. The pattern has to be
recognized first.</p>
<p>Predicting the future can only get you in trouble. The task is to
manage what is there and to work to create what could and should be.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Spot a discontinuity in the economy or society that has
appeared and presents an opportunity for your enterprise. Determine how
long it will take for this change to impact the business. Develop a
business plan to cash in on this insight.</p>
<p>Managing for Results</p>
<h4 id="march-innovation-and-risk-taking">6 March Innovation and Risk
Taking</h4>
<p>Successful innovators are conservative.</p>
<p>I once attended a university symposium on entrepreneurship at which a
number of psychologists spoke. Although their papers disagreed on
everything else, they all talked about an “entrepreneurial personality,”
which was characterized by a “propensity for risk taking.” A well-known
and successful innovator and entrepreneur who had built a process-based
innovation into a substantial worldwide business in the space of
twenty-five years was then asked to comment. He said: “I find myself
baffled by your papers. I think I know as many successful innovators and
entrepreneurs as anyone, beginning with myself. I have never come across
an ‘entrepreneurial personality.’ The successful ones I know all have,
however, one thing—and only one thing—in common: they are not ‘risk
takers.’ They try to define the risks they have to take and to minimize
them as much as possible. Otherwise none of us could have
succeeded.”</p>
<p>This jibes with my own experience. I, too, know a good many
successful entrepreneurs. Not one of them has a “propensity for risk
taking.” Most successful innovators in real life are colorless figures,
and much more likely to spend hours on cash-flow projections than to
dash off looking for “risks.” They are not “risk-focused”; they are
“opportunity-focused.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Determine which of your ideas presents the least risk
and the most opportunity and focus on them.</p>
<p>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</p>
<h4 id="march-creating-a-true-whole">7 March Creating a True Whole</h4>
<p>Create a true whole greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>A manager has the task of creating a true whole that is larger than
the sum of its parts. One analogy is the task of the conductor of a
symphony orchestra, through whose effort, vision, and leadership
individual instrumental parts become the living whole of a musical
performance. But the conductor has the composer’s score; he is only
interpreter. The manager is both composer and conductor.</p>
<p>The task of creating a genuine whole also requires that the manager,
in every one of her acts, consider simultaneously the performance and
results of the enterprise as a whole and the diverse activities needed
to achieve synchronized performance. It is here, perhaps, that the
comparison with the orchestra conductor fits best. A conductor must
always hear both the whole orchestra and, say, the second oboe.
Similarly, a manager must always consider both the overall performance
of the enterprise and, say, the market-research activity needed. By
raising the performance of the whole, she creates scope and challenge
for market research. By improving the performance of market research,
she makes possible better overall business results. The manager must
simultaneously ask two double-barreled questions: “What better business
performance is needed and what does this require of what activities?”
And “What better performances are the activities capable of and what
improvement in business results will they make possible?”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Have you composed your symphony? Has your boss composed
his or hers? Have you begun rehearsals with your players yet? Can you
hear the second oboe? Are you ready for Carnegie Hall?</p>

<p>Others reach for a big spoon.</p>
<p>T he manager will have to look at her task and ask, “What must I do
to be prepared for danger, for opportunities, and above all for change?”
First, this is a time to make sure that your organization is lean and
can move fast. So this is a time when one systematically abandons and
sloughs off unjustifiable products and activities—and sees to it that
the really important tasks are adequately supported. Second, she will
have to work on the most expensive of resources—time —particularly in
areas where it is people’s only resource, as it is for highly paid,
important groups such as research workers, technical service staffs, and
all managers. And one must set goals for productivity improvement.
Third, managers must learn to manage growth and to distinguish among
kinds of growth. If productivity of your combined resources goes up with
growth, it is healthy growth. Fourth, the development of people will be
far more crucial in the years ahead.</p>

Constant Change</h4>
<p>Today’s certainties always become tomorrow’s absurdities.</p>
<p>O ne thing is certain for developed countries—and probably for the
entire world—we face long years of profound changes. An organization
must be organized for constant change. It will no longer be possible to
consider entrepreneurial innovation as lying outside of management or
even as peripheral to management. Entrepreneurial innovation will have
to become the very heart and core of management. The organization’s
function is entrepreneurial, to put knowledge to work —on tools,
products, and processes; on the design of work; on knowledge itself.</p>
<p>Deliberate emphasis on innovation may be needed most where
technological changes are least spectacular. Everyone in a
pharmaceutical company knows that the company’s survival depends on its
ability to replace three quarters of its products by entirely new ones
every ten years. But how many people in an insurance company realize
that the company’s growth—perhaps even its survival—depends on the
development of new forms of insurance? The less spectacular or prominent
technological change is in a business, the greater the danger that the
whole organization will ossify, and the more important, therefore, is
the emphasis on innovation.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Are you and your organization in danger of
ossification? Decide how you and your organization can systematically
innovate, and build this into your management process.</p>

<h4 id="march-searching-for-change">10 March Searching for Change</h4>
<p>A change is something people do; a fad is something people talk
about.</p>
<p>E ntrepreneurs see change as the norm and as healthy. Usually they do
not bring about the change themselves. But—and this defines the
entrepreneur and entrepreneurship—the entrepreneur always searches for
change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Look at every change, look out every window. And ask: “Could this be
an opportunity?” “Is this new thing a genuine change or simply a fad?”
The difference is very simple: A change is something people do, and a
fad is something people talk about. An enormous amount of talk is a fad.
You must also ask yourself if these transitions, these changes, are an
opportunity or a threat. If you start out by looking at change as
threat, you will never innovate. Don’t dismiss something because this is
not what you had planned. The unexpected is often the best source of
innovation.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Take a half an hour to discuss with a colleague the
changes sweeping your industry and identify the biggest genuine changes.
Ignore the fads; figure out how to capitalize on the genuine
changes.</p>

<h4 id="march-piloting-change">11 March Piloting Change</h4>
<p>Neither studies nor market research nor computer modeling is a
substitute for the test of reality.</p>
<p>E verything improved or new needs first to be tested on a small
scale; that is, it needs to be piloted. The way to do this is to find
somebody within the enterprise who really wants the new. Everything new
gets into trouble. And then it needs a champion. It needs somebody who
says, “I am going to make this succeed,” and who then goes to work on
it. And this person needs to be somebody whom the organization respects.
This need not even be somebody within the organization.</p>
<p>Often a good way to pilot a new product or new service is to find a
customer who really wants the new, and who is willing to work with the
producer on making truly successful the new product or the new service.
If the pilot test is successful—it finds the problems nobody anticipated
but also finds the opportunities that nobody anticipated, whether in
terms of design, of market, of service—the risk of change is usually
quite small.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make sure the best ideas in your organization have
fierce advocates to see them through a test in the marketplace.</p>

<h4 id="march-the-purpose-of-a-business">12 March The Purpose of a
Business</h4>
<p>A business enterprise has two basic functions: marketing and
innovation.</p>
<p>I f we want to know what a business is, we have to start with its
purpose. And the purpose must lie outside the business itself. In fact,
it must lie in society, since a business enterprise is an organ of
society. There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to
create a customer. The customer is the foundation of a business and
keeps it in existence. He alone gives employment. And it is to supply
the customer that society entrusts wealth-producing resources to the
business enterprise.</p>
<p>Because it is the purpose to create a customer, any business
enterprise has two—and only two—basic functions: marketing and
innovation. These are the entrepreneurial functions. Marketing is the
distinguishing, the unique function of Business.</p>

<h4 id="march-converting-strategic-plans-to-action">13 March Converting
Strategic Plans to Action</h4>
<p>The best plan is only good intentions unless it degenerates into
work.</p>
<p>T he distinction that marks a plan capable of producing results is
the commitment of key people to work on specific tasks. Unless such
commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes, but no plan. A
plan needs to be tested by asking managers, “Which of your best people
have you put on this work today?” The manager who comes back (as most of
them do) and says, “But I can’t spare my best people now. They have to
finish what they are doing now before I can put them to work on
tomorrow,” is simply admitting that he does not have a plan.</p>
<p>Work implies accountability, a deadline, and finally, the measurement
of results, that is, feedback from results on the work. What we measure
and how we measure determine what will be considered relevant, and
determine, thereby, not just what we see, but what we—and others—do.</p>

measure results. Set deadlines for yourself and your organization to
achieve these results.</p>

<p>The entrepreneurial disciplines are not just desirable; they are

<p>E very institution—and not only businesses—must build into its
day-to-day management four entrepreneurial activities that run in
parallel. One is organized abandonment of products, services, processes,
markets, distribution channels, and so on that are no longer an optimal
allocation of resources. Then any institution must organize for
systematic, continuing improvement. Then it has to organize for
systematic and continuous exploitation, especially of its successes. And
finally, it has to organize systematic innovation, that is, create the
different tomorrow that makes obsolete and, to a large extent, replaces
even the most successful products of today in an organization. I
emphasize that these disciplines are not just desirable; they are
conditions for survival today.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Abandon what is about to be obsolete, develop a system
to exploit your successes, and develop a systematic approach to
innovation.</p>

<p>John Maynard Keynes’s best-known saying is surely “In the long run we
are all dead.” It is a total fallacy that, as Keynes implies, optimizing
the short term creates the right long-term future.</p>
<p>I t is a value question whether a business should be run for
short-term results or for “the long run.” Financial analysts believe
that businesses can be run for both, simultaneously. Successful
businessmen know better. To be sure, everyone has to produce short-term
results. But in any conflict between short-term results and long-term
growth, one company decides in favor of long-term growth, and another
company decides such a conflict in favor of short-term results. Again,
this is not primarily a disagreement on economics. It is fundamentally a
value conflict regarding the function of a business and the
responsibility of management.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Does your organization sacrifice the long-term
wealth-producing capacity of the enterprise to produce short-term
results? Discuss how you can break out of this trap and still produce

<h4 id="march-balancing-objectives-and-measurements">16 March Balancing
Objectives and Measurements</h4>
<p>The traditional theorem of the maximization of profit has to be
discarded.</p>
<p>T o manage a business is to balance a variety of needs and goals. To
emphasize only profit, misdirects managers to the point where they may
endanger the survival of the business. To obtain profit today, they tend
to undermine the future. They may push the most easily saleable product
lines and slight those that are the market of tomorrow. They tend to
short-change research, promotion, and other postponable investments.
Above all, they shy away from any capital expenditure that may increase
the investment capital base against which profits are measured; and the
result is dangerous obsolescing of equipment. In other words, they are
directed into the worst practices of management.</p>
<p>Objectives are needed in every area where performance and results
directly and vitally affect the survival and prosperity of the business.
There are eight areas in which performance and objectives have to be
set: market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial
resources, profitability, manager performance and development, worker
performance and attitude, and public responsibility. Different key areas
require different emphasis in different businesses—and different
emphasis at different stages of the development of each business. But
the areas are the same, whatever the business, whatever the economic
conditions, whatever the business’s size or stage of growth.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: In addition to setting profit objectives, set
objectives for your business in the following areas: market standing,
innovation, productivity, physical and financial resources,
profitability, manager performance and development, worker performance,
and public responsibility.</p>
<p>The Practice of Management</p>
<h4 id="march-the-purpose-of-profit">17 March The Purpose of Profit</h4>
<p>Profit is the ultimate test of business performance.</p>
<p>P rofit serves three purposes. One is it measures the net
effectiveness and soundness of a business’s efforts. Another is the
“risk premium” that covers the costs of staying in business—replacement,
obsolescence, market risk and uncertainty. Seen from this point of view,
there is no such thing as “profit”; there are only “costs of being in
business” and “costs of staying in business.” And the task of a business
is to provide adequately for these “costs of staying in business” by
earning an adequate profit. Finally, profit ensures the supply of future
capital for innovation and expansion, either directly, by providing the
means of self-financing out of retained earnings, or indirectly, through
providing sufficient inducement for new outside capital in the form in
which it is best suited to the enterprise’s objectives.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Decide to pull the plug on an unprofitable business if
it is not covering the cost required to stay in business or providing
enough capital for future growth.</p>
<p>The Practice of Management</p>
<h4 id="march-morality-and-profits">18 March Morality and Profits</h4>
<p>Is there sufficient profit?</p>
<p>J oseph Schumpeter’s “innovator,” with his “creative destruction,” is
the only theory so far to explain why there is something we call
“profit.” The classical economists very well knew that their theory did
not give any rationale for profit. Indeed, in the equilibrium economics
of a closed economic system, there is no place for profit, no
justification for it, no explanation of it. If profit is, however, a
genuine cost, and especially if profit is the only way to maintain jobs
and to create new ones, then capitalism becomes again a moral
system.</p>
<p>The weakness on moral grounds of the profit incentive enabled Karl
Marx at once to condemn the capitalist as wicked and immoral and assert
“scientifically” that he serves no function. As soon, however, as one
shifts from the axiom of an unchanging, self-contained, closed economy,
what is called profit is no longer immoral. It becomes a moral
imperative. Indeed the question then is no longer: “How can the economy
be structured to minimize the bribe of the functionless surplus called
profit that has to be handed over to the capitalist to keep the economy
going?” The question in Schumpeter’s economics is always: “Is there
sufficient profit?” Is there adequate capital formation to provide for
the costs of the future, the costs of staying in business, the costs of
“creative destruction”?</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Check to see if you are earning enough profit to cover
the cost of capital and provide for innovation. If not, what are you
going to do about it?</p>

<h4 id="march-defining-corporate-performance">19 March Defining
Corporate Performance</h4>
<p>Maximize the wealth-producing capacity of the enterprise.</p>
<p>R alph Cordiner, CEO of the General Electric Company from 1958 to
1963, asserted that top management in the large, publicly owned
corporation was a “trustee.” Cordiner argued that senior executives were
responsible for managing the enterprise “in the best-balanced interest
of shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers, and plant community
cities.” That is what we now call “stakeholders.” Cordiner’s answer
still required a clear definition of results and of the meaning of
“best” with respect to “balance.” We no longer need to theorize about
how to define performance and results in the large enterprise. We have
successful examples.</p>
<p>Both the Germans and the Japanese have highly concentrated
institutional ownership. How, then, do the institutional owners of
German or Japanese industry define performance and results? Though they
manage quite differently, they define them in the same way. Unlike
Cordiner, they do not “balance” anything. They maximize. But they do not
attempt to maximize shareholder value or the short-term interest of any
one of the enterprise’s “stakeholders.” Rather, they maximize the
wealth-producing capacity of the enterprise. It is this objective that
integrates short-term and long-term results and that ties the
operational dimensions of business performance—market standing,
innovation, productivity, and people and their development—with
financial needs and financial results. It is also this objective on
which all the constituencies—whether shareholders, customers, or
employees—depend for the satisfaction of their expectations and
objectives.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Check the tradeoff your enterprise is making between
long-term performance variables—market standing, innovation,
productivity, and people development—and short-term profitability.
Decide whether these tradeoffs are healthy for the enterprise.</p>

Managers</h4>
<p>The things that the proponents of “management audits” talk
about—integrity and creativity, for instance—are better left to the
novelist.</p>
<p>T he “bottom line” measures business performance rather than
management performance. And the performance of a business today is
largely a result of the performance of management in years past.
Performance in management, therefore, means in large measure doing a
good job of preparing today’s business for the future. The future of a
business is largely formed by present-management performance in four
areas:</p>
<p>Performance in appropriating capital: We need to measure the return
on investment against the return expected.</p>
<p>Performance in people decisions: Neither what is expected of a
person’s performance when he or she is put into the job, nor how the
appointment works out, is “intangible.” Both can be fairly easily
judged.</p>
<p>Performance in innovation: Research results can be appraised, and
then projected backward on the promises and expectations at the time the
research effort was started.</p>
<p>Strategies versus performance: Did the things that the strategy
expected to happen take place? And were the goals set the right goals in
light of actual developments? Have they been attained?</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Perform a management audit of yourself and the people
who report directly to you. The criteria should include whether you/they
made good people decisions, whether you/they have had any innovative
ideas, and whether your/their strategic expectations came to pass.</p>

about fifteen or twenty years ago: e-commerce —that is, the explosive

<p>The medium not only controls how things are communicated, but what

<p>I n health care, information technology has already made a fabulous
impact. In education, its impact will be greater. However, attempts to
put ordinary college courses on the Internet are a mistake. Marshall
McLuhan was correct. The medium controls not only how things are
communicated, but what things are communicated. On the Web, you must do
it differently.</p>
<p>You must redesign everything. Firstly, you must hold students’
attention. Any good teacher has a radar system to get the class’s
reaction, but you don’t have that online. Secondly, you must enable
students to do what they can do in a college course, which is to go back
and forth. So, online you must combine a book’s qualities with a
course’s continuity and flow. Above all, you must put it in a context.
In a college course, the college provides the context. In that online
course you turn on at home, the course must provide the background, the
context, the references.</p>

Strength of E-Commerce</h4>
<p>Selling is tied no longer to production but to distribution.</p>
<p>E -commerce is to the information revolution what the railroad was to
the industrial revolution. The railroad mastered distance—e-commerce
eliminates it. The Internet provides the enterprise with the ability to
link one activity to another and to make real-time data widely
available, both within the company and to outside suppliers, outside
channels of distribution, and customers. It strengthens the move to
disintegrate the corporation.</p>
<p>But, the great strength of e-commerce is that it provides the
consumer with a whole range of products, no matter who makes them.
Examples include Amazon.com and CarsDirect.com. E-commerce separates,
for the first time, selling and producing. Selling is tied no longer to
production but to distribution. There is absolutely no reason why any
e-commerce facility should limit itself to marketing and selling one
maker’s products or brands.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Is your business the equivalent of Amazon.com or the
local bookstore? If the latter, determine how you can use e-commerce to
fight back.</p>

Challenge</h4>
<p>It is going to CANNIBALIZE our business.</p>
<p>W e don’t know yet which goods and services will turn out to be most
suitable for e-commerce. But we do know that any success in selling
through e-commerce, whether business-to-business or
business-to-consumer, is going to be seen as a threat by the traditional
distribution channels, such as the supermarkets or the local offices of
the brokerage houses. “It is going to CANNIBALIZE our business,” the
traditional distributors will scream. Actually, if past experience is
any guide, it may, in many cases, ADD traditional business and actually,
increase their business and their profits. That’s very often the result
of a new distribution channel.</p>
<p>But we won’t know that for a good many years. Nor will we know for
some years which goods and services will lend themselves to distribution
through e-commerce. And there’s no point in trying to guess. So the
decision to push e-commerce is a risky one. And yet, no business can
risk NOT pushing e-commerce if there’s the slightest indication that it
will become an important distribution channel for its goods and
services, if not the most important one.</p>

<p>Where do activities belong?</p>
<p>I ncreasingly, the economic process depends on structures built upon
alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing. Structures that are built
upon strategy, rather than ownership and control, are becoming the
models for growth in the global economy. Executives in these partnership
structures should organize and manage corporate strategy, product
planning, and product costing as one economic whole.</p>
<p>Take for example, a leading global manufacturer of consumer goods.
Formerly the company assumed that the more in-house manufacturing it
did, the better. Now it is asking, “Where do activities belong?” So, it
has decided to place finishing activities into many of the 180 countries
where the customer is located. But it produces itself fundamental
compounds for the products only in a few regions of the world. For
example, a large plant in Ireland serves all of Europe and Africa. The
company is in-sourcing the basic compounds to achieve quality control,
but it is outsourcing final assembly. It is looking at the entire value
chain and decides where to place various activities.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Think about your job. Could someone else do it cheaper
and better? If so, develop a plan to get new skills to move up the food

<h4 id="march-management-of-the-multinational">26 March Management of
the Multinational</h4>
<p>The multinationals of 2025 are likely to be held together and
controlled by strategy.</p>
<p>S tatistically, multinational companies play much the same part in
the world economy today as they did in 1913. But they have become very
different animals. Multinationals in 1913 were domestic firms with
subsidiaries abroad, each of them self-contained, in charge of a
politically defined territory, and highly autonomous. Multinationals now
tend to be organized globally along product or service lines. But like
the multinationals of 1913, they are held together and controlled by
ownership. By contrast, the multinationals of 2025 are likely to be held
together and controlled by strategy. There will still be ownership, of
course. But alliances, joint ventures, minority stakes, know-how
agreements and contracts, will increasingly be the building blocks of a
confederation.</p>
<p>This kind of organization will need a new kind of top management. In
most countries, and even in a good many large and complex companies, top
management is still seen as an extension of operating management.
Tomorrow’s top management, however, is likely to be a distinct and
separate organ: it will stand for the company.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Is your expertise or your boss’s expertise in the nuts
and bolts of operating a division or in knitting together a far-flung

<p>The axiom that an enterprise should aim for maximum integration is
obsolete.</p>
<p>The traditional axiom that an enterprise should aim for maximum
integration is becoming obsolete in the new corporation. There are two
explanations for the “disintegration” of the enterprise.</p>
<p>First, knowledge has become increasingly specialized. Knowledge is
therefore increasingly expensive, and also it is increasingly difficult
to maintain enough critical mass for every major task within an
enterprise.</p>
<p>And because knowledge rapidly deteriorates unless it is used
constantly, maintaining within an organization an activity that is used
only intermittently guarantees incompetence.</p>
<p>Second, by now the new information technologies—Internet and
e-mail—have practically eliminated the physical costs of communication.
This has meant that often the most productive and most profitable way to
organize is to disintegrate and to partner.</p>
<p>This is being extended to more and more activities. Outsourcing the
management of an institution’s information technology, data processing,
and computer system has become routine, for instance.</p>

<p>Major changes always start outside an organization. A retailer may

<h4 id="march-why-management-science-fails-to-perform">29 March Why
Management Science Fails to Perform</h4>
<p>Parts exist in contemplation of the whole.</p>
<p>T here is one fundamental insight underlying all management science.
It is that the business enterprise is a system of the highest order: a
system whose parts are human beings contributing voluntarily of their
knowledge, skill, and dedication to a joint venture. And one thing
characterizes all genuine systems, whether they be mechanical like the
control of a missile, biological like a tree, or social like the
business enterprise: it is interdependence. The whole of a system is not
necessarily improved if one particular function or part is improved or
made more efficient. In fact, the system may well be damaged thereby, or
even destroyed. In some cases the best way to strengthen the system may
be to weaken a part—to make it less precise or less efficient. For what
matters in any system is the performance of the whole; this is the
result of growth and of dynamic balance, adjustment, and integration,
rather than of mere technical efficiency.</p>
<p>Primary emphasis on the efficiency of parts in management science is
therefore bound to do damage. It is bound to optimize precision of the
tool at the expense of the health and performance of the whole.</p>

or engineering, might be weakened to improve overall performance.</p>

<h4 id="march-nature-of-complex-systems">30 March Nature of Complex
Systems</h4>
<p>In respect to short-term phenomena, there is no system. There is only
chaos.</p>
<p>T he fastest growing field of modern mathematics is the theory of
complexity. It shows, with rigorous mathematical proof, that complex
systems do not allow prediction; they are controlled by factors that are
not statistically significant. This has become known as the “butterfly
effect”: a whimsical but mathematically rigorous (and experimentally
proven) theorem shows that a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon
rain forest can and sometimes does control the weather in Chicago a few
weeks or months later. In complex systems, the climate is predictable
and has high stability; the “weather” is not predictable and is totally
unstable. And no complex system can exclude anything as “external.” In
respect to the weather, that is, in respect to short-term phenomena,
there is no system. There is only chaos.</p>
<p>Economics and economic policy deal with short-term phenomena. They
deal with recessions and changes in prices. Contemporary economics and
economic policy assume that the system, the long term, is made by
short-term policies, for example, changes in interest rates, government
spending, tax rates, and so on. For a complex system this is simply not
true, as modern mathematics has now proven.</p>

<p>The New Realities</p>
<h4 id="march-from-analysis-to-perception">31 March From Analysis to
Perception</h4>
<p>In an ecology, the “whole” has to be seen and understood and the
“parts” exist only in contemplation of the whole.</p>
<p>I n the world of the mathematicians and philosophers, perception was
“intuition” and either spurious or mystical, elusive, mysterious.
Perception, the mechanical worldview asserts, is not “serious” but is
relegated to the “finer things of life,” that is to things we can do
without. In the biological universe, however, perception is at the
center. And of course any “ecology” is perception rather than analysis.
In an ecology, the “whole” has to be seen and understood and the “parts”
exist only in contemplation of the whole. Three hundred years ago,
Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” We will now have to say also,
“I see therefore I am.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the new realities with which this book deals are
configurations and, as such, call for perception as much as analysis:
the dynamic disequilibrium of the new pluralisms, for instance; the
multinational and transnational economy and the transnational ecology;
the new archetype of the “educated person” that is so badly needed.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: What are the roles of both perception and analysis in
the following statement about an organization?: “For what matters in any
system is the performance of the whole; this is the result of growth and
of dynamic balance, adjustment, and integration rather than of mere
technical efficiency.”</p>
<p>The New Realities</p>
<h4 id="april-management-as-a-human-endeavor">1 April Management as a
Human Endeavor</h4>
<p>Management is about human beings.</p>
<p>T he modern enterprise is a human and social organization. Management
as a discipline and as a practice deals with human and social values. To
be sure, the organization exists for an end beyond itself. In the case
of business enterprise, the end is economic; in the case of the
hospital, it is the care of the patient and his or her recovery; in the
case of the university, it is teaching, learning, and research. To
achieve these ends, the peculiar modern invention we call management
organizes human beings for joint performance and creates social
organization. But only when management succeeds in making the human
resources of the organization productive is it able to attain the
desired outside objectives and results.</p>
<p>Management is no more a science than is medicine: both are practices.
A practice feeds from a large body of true sciences. Just as medicine
feeds off biology, chemistry, physics, and a host of other natural
sciences, so management feeds off economics, psychology, mathematics,
political theory, history, and philosophy. But like medicine, management
is also a discipline in its own right, with its own assumptions, its own
aims, its own tools, and its own performance goals and measurements.</p>

Worker</h4>
<p>The responsible worker has a personal commitment to getting

<p>B ut there also is the task of building and leading organizations in

burden of what is basically managerial responsibility: responsibility
for her own job and work group, for her contribution to the performance
and results of the entire organization, and for the social tasks of the
work community.</p>
<p>Responsibility, therefore, is both external and internal. Externally
it implies accountability to some person or body and accountability for
specific performance. Internally it implies commitment. The Responsible
Worker is a worker who not only is accountable for specific results but
also has authority to do whatever is necessary to produce these results
and, finally, is committed to these results as a personal
achievement.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Are you personally committed to getting results at

for the group as well as for each individual.</p>
<p>The focus of the organization must be on opportunities rather than on
problems.</p>
<p>The decisions that affect people —their placement, pay, promotion,
demotion, and severance—must express the values and beliefs of the
organization.</p>
<p>Finally, in its people decisions, management must demonstrate that it

one quality that he has to bring with him and cannot be expected to
acquire later on.</p>

I would look at what the candidates have done, what their strengths are.
You can only perform with strength—and what have they done with it?
Second, I would look at the institution and ask: “What is the one
immediate key challenge?” I would try to match the strength with the
needs.</p>
<p>Then I would look for integrity. A leader sets an example, especially
a strong leader. He or she is somebody on whom people, especially
younger people, in the organization model themselves. Many years ago I
learned from a very wise old man, who was the head of a very large,
worldwide organization. He was in his late seventies, famous for putting
the right people into the right enterprises, all over the globe. I asked
him: “What do you look for?” And he said: “I always ask myself, would I
want one of my sons to work under that person? If he is successful, then
young people will imitate him. Would I want my son to look like this?”

<p>Leadership is the lifting of a man’s vision to higher sights.</p>
<p>T he leader who basically focuses on himself or herself is going to
mislead. The three most charismatic leaders in this century inflicted
more suffering on the human race than almost any other trio in history:
Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. What matters is not the leader’s charisma. For
leadership is not magnetic personality—that can just as well be
demagoguery. It is not “making friends and influencing people”—that is
flattery.</p>
<p>Leadership is the lifting of a man’s vision to higher sights, the
raising of a man’s performance to a higher standard, the building of a
man’s personality beyond its normal limitations. Nothing better prepares
the ground for such leadership than a spirit of management that confirms
in the day-to-day practices of the organization strict principles of
conduct and responsibility, high standards of performance, and respect
for the individual and his work.</p>

<p>The distance between the leaders and the average is a constant.</p>
<p>I n human affairs, the distance between the leaders and the average
is a constant. If leadership performance is high, the average will go
up. The effective executive knows that it is easier to raise the
performance of one leader than it is to raise the performance of a whole
mass. She therefore makes sure that she puts into the leadership
position, into the standard-setting, the performance-making position,
the person who has the strength to do the outstanding, the pacesetting
job. This always requires focus on the one strength of a person and
dismissal of weaknesses as irrelevant unless they hamper the full
deployment of the available strength.</p>
<p>The task of an executive is not to change human beings. Rather, as
the Bible tells us in the parable of the talents, the task is to
multiply the performance capacity of the whole by putting to use
whatever strength, whatever health, whatever aspiration there is in
individuals.</p>

<p>Not enough generals were killed.</p>
<p>A ll the effective leaders I have encountered—both those I worked
with and those I merely watched—knew four simple things: a leader is
someone who has followers; popularity is not leadership, results are;
leaders are highly visible, they set examples; leadership is not rank,
privilege, titles, or money, it is responsibility.</p>
<p>When I was in my final high school years, our excellent history
teacher—himself a badly wounded war veteran—told each of us to pick
several of a whole spate of history books on World War I and write a
major essay on our selections. When we then discussed these essays in
class, one of my fellow students said, “Every one of these books says
that the Great War was a war of total military incompetence. Why was
it?” Our teacher did not hesitate a second but shot right back, “Because
not enough generals were killed; they stayed way behind the lines and
let others do the fighting and dying.” Effective leaders delegate, but
they do not delegate the one thing that will set the standards. They do
it.</p>

<h4 id="april-absence-of-integrity">9 April Absence of Integrity</h4>
<p>An executive should be a realist; and no one is less realistic than
the cynic.</p>
<p>I ntegrity may be difficult to define, but what constitutes lack of
integrity is of such seriousness as to disqualify a person for a
managerial position. A person should never be appointed to a managerial
position if his vision focuses on people’s weaknesses rather than on
their strengths. The person who always knows exactly what people cannot
do, but never sees anything they can do, will undermine the spirit of
her organization. An executive should be a realist; and no one is less
realistic than the cynic.</p>
<p>A person should not be appointed if that person is more interested in
the question “Who is right?” than in the question “What is right?” To
ask “Who is right?” encourages one’s subordinates to play it safe, if
not to play politics. Above all, it encourages subordinates to “cover
up” rather than to take corrective action as soon as they find out that
they have made a mistake. Management should not appoint a person who
considers intelligence more important than integrity. It should never
promote a person who has shown that he or she is afraid of strong
subordinates. It should never put into a management job a person who
does not set high standards for his or her own work.</p>

<h4 id="april-crisis-and-leadership">10 April Crisis and Leadership</h4>
<p>Leadership is a foul-weather job.</p>
<p>T he most successful leader of the twentieth century was Winston
Churchill. But for twelve years, from 1928 to Dunkirk in 1940, he was
totally on the sidelines, almost discredited—because there was no need
for a Churchill. Things were routine or, at any rate, looked routine.
When the catastrophe came, thank goodness he was available. Fortunately
or unfortunately, the one predictable thing in any organization is the
crisis. That always comes. That’s when you do depend on the leader.</p>
<p>The most important task of an organization’s leader is to anticipate
crisis. Perhaps not to avert it, but to anticipate it. To wait until
crisis hits is abdication. One has to make the organization capable of
anticipating the storm, weathering it, and in fact, being ahead of it.
You cannot prevent a major catastrophe, but you can build an
organization that is battle-ready, that has high morale, that knows how
to behave, that trusts itself, and where people trust one another. In
military training, the first rule is to instill soldiers with trust in
their officers, because without trust they won’t fight.</p>

<p>The task matters, and you are a servant.</p>
<p>M ost organizations need somebody who can lead regardless of the
weather. What matters is that he or she works on the basic competencies.
As the first such basic competence, I would put the willingness,
ability, and self-discipline to listen. Listening is not a skill; it is
a discipline. Anybody can do it. All you have to do is to keep your
mouth shut. The second essential competence is the willingness to
communicate, to make yourself understood. That requires infinite
patience. The next important competence is not to alibi. Say: “This
doesn’t work as well as it should. Let’s take it back and reengineer
it.” The last basic competence is the willingness to realize how
unimportant you are compared to the task. Leaders subordinate themselves
to the task.</p>
<p>When effective leaders have the capacity to maintain their
personality and individuality, even though they are totally dedicated,
the task will go on after them. They also have a human existence outside
of the task. Otherwise they do things for personal aggrandizement, in
the belief that this furthers the cause. They become self-centered and
vain. And above all, they become jealous. One of the great strengths of
Winston Churchill was that Churchill, to the very end, pushed and
furthered young politicians.</p>

<h4 id="april-fake-versus-true-leaders">12 April Fake Versus True
Leaders</h4>
<p>All one could do in 1939 was pray and hope.</p>
<p>B ut this is hindsight. Winston Churchill appears in The End of
Economic Man and is treated with great respect. Indeed, reading now what
I then wrote, I suspect that I secretly hoped that Churchill would
indeed emerge into leadership. I also never fell for the ersatz leaders
to whom a good many well-informed contemporaries—a good many members of
Franklin Roosevelt’s entourage in Washington, for instance—looked for
deliverance. Yet in 1939 Churchill was a might-have-been: a powerless
old man rapidly approaching seventy; a Cassandra who bored his listeners
in spite (or perhaps because) of his impassioned rhetoric; a two-time
loser who, however magnificent in opposition, had proven himself
inadequate to the demands of office. I know that it is hard to believe
today that even in 1940 Churchill was by no means the inevitable
successor when the “Men of Munich” were swept out of office by the fall
of France and the retreat at Dunkirk.</p>
<p>Churchill’s emergence in 1940, more than a year after the book was
first published, was the reassertion of the basic moral and political
values for which The End of Economic Man had prayed and hoped. But all
one could do in 1939 was pray and hope. The reality was the absence of
leadership, the absence of affirmation, the absence of men and values
and principle.</p>

<p>What Churchill gave was moral authority, belief in values, and faith
in the rightness of rational action.</p>
<p>T he last reality of the thirties, which The End of Economic Man
clearly conveys, is the total absence of leadership. The political stage
was full of characters. Never before, it seems, had there been so many
politicians, working so frenziedly. Quite a few of these politicians
were decent men, some even very able ones. But excepting the twin
Princes of Darkness, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, they were all
pathetically small men; even mediocrities were conspicuous by their
absence. “But,” today’s reader will protest, “there was Winston
Churchill.” To be sure, Churchill’s emergence as the leader in Europe’s
fight against the evil forces of totalitarianism was the crucial event.
It was, to use a Churchillian phrase, “the hinge of fate.”</p>
<p>Today’s reader is indeed likely to underrate Churchill’s importance.
Until Churchill took over as leader of free peoples everywhere, after
the retreat at Dunkirk and the fall of France, Hitler had moved with
apparent infallibility. After Churchill, Hitler was “off” for good,
never retaining his sense of timing or his uncanny ability to anticipate
every opponent’s slightest move. The shrewd calculator of the thirties
became the wild, uncontrolled plunger of the forties. It is hard to
realize today, sixty-five years after the event, that without Churchill
the United States might have resigned itself to Nazi domination of
Europe. What Churchill gave was precisely what Europe needed: moral
authority, belief in values, and faith in the rightness of rational
action.</p>

during his long tenure at the top. Many GM managers felt a deep personal
gratitude to him for his quiet but decisive acts of kindness, of help,
of advice, or just warm sympathy when they were in trouble. At the same
time, however, Sloan kept aloof from the entire management group in
GM.</p>
<p>“It is the duty of the Chief Executive Officer to be objective and
impartial,” Sloan said, explaining his management style. “He must be
absolutely tolerant and pay no attention to how a man does his work, let
alone whether he likes a man or not. The only criteria must be
performance and character. And that is incompatible with friendship and
social relations. A Chief Executive Officer who has ‘friendships’ within
the company, has ‘social relations’ with colleagues, or discusses
anything with them except the job, cannot remain impartial—or at least,
which is equally damaging, he will not appear as such. Loneliness,
distance, and formality may be contrary to his temperament—they have
always been contrary to mine—but they are his duty.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Focus on your employees’ performance and character, not
on whether you like them.</p>

<h4 id="april-people-decisions">15 April People Decisions</h4>
<p>No organization can do better than the people it has.</p>
<p>P eople decisions are the ultimate—perhaps the only—control of an
organization. People determine the performance capacity of an
organization. No organization can do better than the people it has. The
yield from the human resource really determines the organization’s
performance. And that’s decided by the basic people decisions: whom we
hire and whom we fire, where we place people, and whom we promote. The
quality of these human decisions largely determines whether the
organization is being run seriously, whether its mission, its values,
and its objectives are real and meaningful to people, rather than just
public relations and rhetoric.</p>
<p>Any executive who starts out believing that he or she is a good judge
of people is going to end up making the worst decisions. To be a judge
of people is not a power given to mere mortals. Those who have a batting
average of almost a thousand in such decisions start out with a very
simple premise: that they are not judges of people. They start out with
a commitment to a diagnostic process. Medical educators say their
greatest problem is the brilliant young physician who has a good eye. He
has to learn not to depend on that alone but to go through the patient
process of making a diagnosis; otherwise he kills people. An executive,
too, has to learn not to depend on insight and knowledge of people but
on a mundane, boring, and conscientious step-by-step process.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Don’t hire people based on your instincts. Have a
process in place to research and test applicants thoroughly.</p>

“What do our jobs have to be to attract and hold the kind of people we
need and want? What is the supply available on the job market? And, what
do we have to do to attract it?” It is highly desirable to have specific
objectives for manager supply, development, and performance, but also
specific objectives for major groups within the nonmanagerial workforce.
There is need for objectives for employee attitudes as well as for
employee skills.</p>
<p>The first sign of decline of an industry is loss of appeal to
qualified, able, and ambitious people. The American railroads, for
instance, did not begin their decline after World War II—it only became
obvious and irreversible then. The decline actually set in around the
time of World War I. Before World War I, able graduates of American
engineering schools looked for a railroad career. From the end of World
War I on—for whatever reason—the railroads no longer appealed to young
engineering graduates, or to any educated young people. As a result,
there was nobody in management capable and competent to cope with new
problems when the railroads ran into heavy weather twenty years
later.</p>

can do.</p>
<p>A very great leader of men, General George C. Marshall, chief of
staff of the U.S. Army during World War II, had the most remarkable
record of putting people into the right place at the right time. He
appointed something like six hundred people to positions as general
officer, division commander, and so on, almost without a dud. And not
one of these people had ever commanded troops before. A discussion would
come up, and Marshall’s aides would say, “Colonel So-and-So is the best
trainer of people we have, but he has never gotten along with his boss.
If he has to testify before Congress, he’ll be a disaster. He is so
rude.” Marshall would then ask, “What is the assignment? To train a
division? If he is first-rate as a trainer, put him in. The rest is my
job.” As a result, he created the largest army the world had ever seen,
thirteen million people, in the shortest possible time, with very few
mistakes. The lesson is to focus on strengths.</p>

<h4 id="april-decision-steps-for-picking-people">18 April Decision Steps
for Picking People</h4>
<p>The most important thing is that the person and the assignment fit
each other.</p>
<p>G eneral George C. Marshall followed Five Simple Decision Steps in
making people decisions. First, Marshall carefully thought through the
assignment. Job descriptions may last a long time, but job assignments
change all the time. Second, Marshall always looked at several qualified
people. Formal qualifications, such as those listed in a résumé, are no
more than a starting point. Their absence disqualifies a candidate.
However, the most important thing is that the person and the assignment
fit each other. To find the best fit, you must consider at least three
to five candidates. Third, Marshall studied the performance records of
all three to five candidates to find what each did well. He looked for
the candidate’s strengths. The things a person cannot do are of little
importance; instead, you must concentrate on the things they can do and
determine whether they are the right strengths for this particular
assignment. Performance can only be built on strengths. Fourth, Marshall
discussed the candidates with others who had worked with them. The best
information often comes through informal discussions with a candidate’s
former bosses and colleagues. And fifth, once the decision was made,
Marshall made sure the appointee understood the assignment. Perhaps the
best way to do this is to ask the new person to carefully think over
what they have to do to be a success, and then, ninety days into the
job, have the person commit it to writing.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Follow these five decision steps when hiring someone:
Understand the job, consider three to five people, study candidates
performance records to find their strengths, talk to the candidates’
colleagues about them, and once hired, explain the assignment to the new
employee.</p>

<p>The soldier has a right to competent command.</p>
<p>T here is no such thing as a perfect record in making people
decisions. Successful executives follow five ground rules. First, the
executive must accept responsibility for any placement that fails. To
blame the nonperformer is a cop-out. The executive made a mistake in
selecting that particular person. But second, the executive does have
the responsibility to remove people who do not perform. The incompetent
or poor performer, when left in his or her job, penalizes all others and
demoralizes the entire organization. Third, just because a person
doesn’t perform in the job he or she was put in doesn’t mean that that
person is a bad worker whom the company should let go. It only means
that he or she is in the wrong job. Fourth, the executive must try to
make the right people decisions for every position. An organization can
only perform to the capacity of its individual workers; thus people
decisions must be right. And fifth, newcomers best be put in an
established position where the expectations are known and help is
available. New major assignments should mainly go to people whose
behaviors and habits are well known and who have already earned trust
and credibility.</p>

<h4 id="april-the-succession-decision">20 April The Succession
Decision</h4>
<p>The most critical people decision, and the one that is hardest to
undo, is the succession to the top.</p>
<p>T he succession to the top decision is the most difficult because
every such decision is a gamble. The only test of performance in the top
position is performance in the top position—and there is very little
preparation for it. What not to do is fairly simple. You don’t want a
carbon copy of the outgoing CEO. If the outgoing CEO says, “Joe 〔or
Mary〕 is just like me thirty years ago,” that’s a carbon copy—and
carbon copies are always weak. Be a little leery, too, of the faithful
assistant who for eighteen years has been at the boss’s side
anticipating his or her every wish, but has never made a decision alone.
By and large, people who are willing and able to make decisions don’t
stay in the assistant role very long. Stay away, too, from the anointed
prince. Nine times out of ten that’s a person who has managed to avoid
ever being put in a position where performance is essential, measured,
and where he or she might make a mistake. They are media events rather
than performers.</p>
<p>What are the positive ways to handle the succession decision? Look at
the assignment. In this institution, what is going to be the biggest
challenge over the next few years? Then look at the people and their
performance. Match the need against proven performance.</p>

organization is going to be over the next five years and choose someone
who has a proven track record of surmounting those challenges.</p>

<p>“If we didn’t spend four hours on placing a man and placing him
right, we’d spend four hundred hours on cleaning up after our
mistake.”</p>
<p>D uring the years in which I attended the meetings of GM’s top
committees, the company made basic decisions on postwar policies such as
capital investments; overseas expansion; the balance between automotive
businesses, accessory businesses, and nonautomotive businesses; union
relations; and financial structure…. I soon realized that a
disproportionate amount of time was taken up with decisions on people
compared to the time spent on decisions on policy. On one occasion the
committee spent hours discussing the work and assignment of a position
way down the line…. As we went out, I turned and said, “Mr. Sloan, how
can you afford to spend four hours on a minor job like this?” “This
corporation pays me a pretty good salary,” he said, “for making the
important decisions, and for making them right…. If that master mechanic
in Dayton is the wrong man, our decisions might as well be written on
water. He converts them into performance. And as for taking a lot of
time, that’s horse apples” (his strongest and favorite epithet)…. “If we
didn’t spend four hours on placing a man and placing him right, we’d
spend four hundred hours on cleaning up after our mistake—and that time
I wouldn’t have. The decision,” he concluded, “about people is the only
truly crucial one. You think and everybody thinks that a company can
have ‘better’ people. All it can do is place people right—and then it’ll
have performance.”</p>

mistakes, not because we’re good judges of people but because we’re
conscientious.”</p>
<p>Decisions on people usually provoked heated debate in the General
Motors executive committee. But on one occasion the whole committee
seemed to be agreed on one candidate—he had handled this crisis
superbly, solved that problem beautifully, quenched yonder fire with
great aplomb—when suddenly Mr. Sloan broke in. “A very impressive record
your Mr. Smith has,” he said, “but do explain to me how he gets into all
those crises he then so brilliantly surmounts?” Nothing more was heard
of Mr. Smith. However, on occasion Mr. Sloan could also say, “You know
all the things Mr. George cannot do—how come he got as far as he did?
What can he do?” And when Mr. Sloan was told, he would say, “Alright,
he’s not brilliant, and not fast, and looks drab. But hasn’t he always
performed?” And Mr. George turned into a most successful general manager
in a big division at a difficult time.</p>

<p>The crucial promotion is not a person’s first—though it may be the
most important one to her and to her career. Nor is it the final one
into the top position; there a management must choose from a small,
already preselected group. The crucial promotion is into the group from
which tomorrow’s top people will have to be selected. It is the decision
at the point where the pyramid in an organization narrows abruptly. Up
to this point, there are in a large organization usually forty to fifty
people to choose from for every vacant spot. Above it, the choice
narrows to one out of three or four. Up to this point also, a person
usually works in one area or function. Above it, she works in the

performance is the base without which business cannot discharge any
other responsibilities, cannot be a good employer, a good citizen, a
good neighbor. But economic performance is not the only responsibility
of a business any more than educational performance is the only
responsibility of a school or health care the only responsibility of a
hospital.</p>
<p>Every organization must assume responsibility for its impact on
employees, the environment, customers, and whomever and whatever it
touches. That is social responsibility. But we also know that society
will increasingly look to major organizations, for-profit and nonprofit
alike, to tackle major social ills. And there we had better be watchful,
because good intentions are not always socially responsible. It is
irresponsible for an organization to accept—let alone to
pursue—responsibilities that would impede its capacity to perform its
main task and mission or to act where it has no competence.</p>

<h4 id="april-sloan-on-social-responsibility">25 April Sloan on Social
Responsibility</h4>
<p>Authority without responsibility is illegitimate; but so is
responsibility without authority.</p>
<p>“P ublic” responsibility was to Alfred Sloan worse than
unprofessional; it was irresponsible, a usurpation of power. “We have a
responsibility toward higher education,” a chief executive of a major
American corporation once said at a meeting both Sloan and I attended.
“Do we in business have any authority over higher education?” Sloan
asked. “Should we have any?” “Of course not,” was the answer. “Then
let’s not talk about ‘responsibility,’” said Sloan with asperity. “You
are a senior executive in a big company and you know the first rule:
authority and responsibility must be congruent and commensurate to each
other. If you don’t want authority and shouldn’t have it, don’t talk
about responsibility. And if you don’t want responsibility and shouldn’t
have it, don’t talk about authority.”</p>
<p>Sloan based this on management principles. But of course it is the
first lesson of political theory and political history. Authority
without responsibility is illegitimate; but so is responsibility without
authority. Both lead to tyranny. Sloan wanted a great deal of authority
for his professional manager, and was ready to take high responsibility.
But for that reason he insisted on limiting authority to the areas of
professional competence, and refused to assert or admit responsibility
in areas outside them.</p>

last boom considerably increased the temptation to fake the books—the

Ethics?</h4>
<p>Business ethics assumes that for some reason the ordinary rules of

<p>T he fundamental axiom on which the Western tradition of ethics has
always been based is: There is only one code of ethics, that of
individual behavior, for prince and pauper, for rich and poor, for the
mighty and the meek alike. Ethics, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, is
the affirmation that all men and women are alike creatures—whether the
Creator be called God, Nature, or Society. There is only one ethics, one
set of rules of morality, one code, that of individual behavior in which
the same rules apply to everyone alike. And this fundamental axiom
business ethics denies. Business ethics, in other words, is not ethics
at all, as the term has commonly been used by Western philosophers and
Western theologians. Business ethics assumes that for some reason the
ordinary rules of ethics do not apply to business. What is business

<p>W hat is business ethics? “It’s casuistry,” the historian of Western
philosophy would answer. Casuistry asserted that rulers, because of
their responsibility, have to strike a balance between the ordinary
demands of ethics that apply to them as individuals and their social
responsibility to their kingdom. But this implies that the rules that
decide what is ethical for ordinary people do not apply equally, if at
all, to those with social responsibility. Ethics for them is instead a
cost-benefit calculation involving the demands of individual conscience
and the demands of position—and that means that the rulers are exempt
from the demands of ethics, if only their behavior can be argued to
confer benefits on other people.</p>
<p>A great horror story of business ethics would, to the casuist, appear
as an example of business virtue if not of unselfish business martyrdom.
In the “electrical apparatus conspiracy” of the late 1950s, several
high-ranking General Electric executives were sent to jail. They were
found guilty of a criminal conspiracy in violation of antitrust because
orders for heavy generating equipment, such as turbines, were parceled
out among the three electrical apparatus manufacturers in the United
States—General Electric, Westinghouse, and Allis Chalmers. The purpose
of the cartel was the protection of the weakest and most dependent of
the companies, Allis Chalmers. As soon as government action destroyed
the cartel, Allis Chalmers had to go out of the turbine business and had
to lay off several thousand people.</p>

is “outsourcing,” in which a company, a hospital, or a government agency
turns over an entire activity to an independent firm that specializes in
that kind of work. Even more important may be the trend toward

<p>Here is an example. An entrepreneur developed a highly successful

jobs is to convince associates and colleagues that the competition is no
longer merely Mexican. Even without the physical presence of
competitors, the Internet allows customers to stay abreast of global

<p>A t present, the term “knowledge worker” is widely used to describe
people with considerable theoretical knowledge and learning: doctors,
lawyers, teachers, accountants, chemical engineers. But, the most
striking growth will be in “knowledge technologists”: computer
technicians, software designers, analysts in clinical labs,
manufacturing technologists, paralegals. These people are as much manual
workers as they are knowledge workers; in fact, they usually spend far
more time working with their hands than with their brains.</p>
<p>So, knowledge does not eliminate skill. On the contrary, knowledge is
fast becoming the foundation for skill. We are using knowledge more and
more to enable people to acquire skills of a very advanced kind fast and
successfully. Only when knowledge is used as a foundation for skill does
it become productive. For example, surgeons preparing for an operation
to correct a brain aneurysm before it produces a lethal brain hemorrhage
spend hours in diagnosis before they cut—and that requires specialized
knowledge of the highest order. The surgery itself, however, is manual
work—and manual work consisting of repetitive manual operations in which
the emphasis is on speed, accuracy, uniformity. And these operations are
studied, organized, learned, and practiced exactly like any other manual
work.</p>

refine these skills for optimum quality and productivity.</p>

<p>P ostcapitalist society is both a knowledge society and a society of
organizations, each dependent on the other and yet each very different
in its concepts, views, and values. Specialized knowledge by itself
produces nothing. It can become productive only when it is integrated
into a task. And this is why the knowledge society is also a society of
organizations: the purpose and function of every organization, business
and nonbusiness alike, is the integration of specialized knowledges into
a common task. It is only the organization that can provide the basic
continuity that knowledge workers need to be effective. It is only the
organization that can convert the specialized knowledge of the knowledge
worker into performance.</p>
<p>Intellectuals see the organization as a tool; it enables them to
practice their techne, their specialized knowledge. Managers see
knowledge as a means to the end of organizational performance. Both are
right. They are opposites; but they relate to each other as poles rather
than as contradictions. If the two balance each other there can be
creativity and order, fulfillment and mission.</p>

<p>Japanese youngsters suffer sleep deprivation because they spend their
evenings at a crammer to help them pass their exams. Otherwise they will
not get into the prestige university of their choice, and thus into a
good job. Other countries, such as America, Britain, and France, are
also allowing their schools to become viciously competitive. That this
has happened over such a short time—no more than thirty or forty
years—indicates how much the fear of failure has already permeated the
knowledge society. Given this competitive struggle, a growing number of
highly successful knowledge workers—business managers, university
teachers, museum directors, doctors—“plateau” in their forties. If their
work is all they have, they are in trouble. Knowledge workers therefore
need to develop some serious outside interest.</p>

ability to acquire and apply theoretical and analytical knowledge. They
require a different approach to work and a different mind-set. Above all
they require a habit of continuous learning.</p>
<p>What mix of knowledges is required for everybody? What is “quality”
in learning and teaching? All these will, of necessity, become central
concerns of the knowledge society, and central political issues. In
fact, it may not be too fanciful to anticipate that the acquisition and

to be turned over to government—and this, everyone seemed to believe,
made sure that the job was already done.</p>
<p>But now our attitudes are in transition. We are rapidly moving to
doubt and distrust of government. We still, if only out of habit, turn
social tasks over to government. We still revise unsuccessful programs
over and over again, and assert that nothing is wrong with them that a
change in procedures will not cure. But we no longer believe these
promises when we reform a bungled program for the third time. We no
longer expect results from government. Who, for instance, believes
anymore that changes in the foreign aid program of the United States (or
of the United Nations) will really produce rapid worldwide development?
What was a torrid romance between the people and government for so very

several kinds of foreign exchange risks: losses on sales or purchases in

can be minimized or at least contained. Above all, they can be converted
into a known, predictable, and controlled cost of doing business not too
different from any other insurance premium by the use of hedging and

Paradox</h4>
<p>How do you get far more output with far fewer workers?</p>
<p>T he most believable forecast for 2020 suggests that manufacturing
output in the developed countries will at least double, while
manufacturing employment will shrink to 10 to 12 percent of the total
workforce. What has changed manufacturing, and sharply pushed up
productivity, are new concepts, such as “lean manufacturing.”
Information and automation are less important than new theories of
manufacturing, which are an advance comparable to the arrival of mass
production eighty years ago.</p>
<p>The decline in manufacturing as a creator of wealth and jobs will
inevitably bring about a new protectionism, once again echoing what
happened earlier in agriculture. The fewer farm voters there are, the
more important the “farm vote” has become. As numbers have shrunk,
farmers have become a unified special-interest group that carries
disproportionate clout in all rich countries.</p>

<p>T he decline in manufacturing as a creator of wealth and jobs will
inevitably bring about a new protectionism. For the first reaction to a
period of turbulence is to try to build a wall that shields one’s own
garden from the cold winds outside. But such walls no longer protect
institutions—and especially businesses—that do not perform up to world
standards. It will only make them more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The best example is Mexico, which for fifty years from 1929 on had a
deliberate policy of building its domestic economy independent of the
outside world. It did this not only by building high walls of
protectionism to keep foreign competition out. It did it—and this was
uniquely Mexican in the twentieth-century world—by practically
forbidding its own companies to export. This attempt to create a modern
but purely Mexican economy failed dismally. Mexico actually became
increasingly dependent on imports, both of food and of manufactured
products, from the outside world. It was finally forced to open itself
to the outside world, since it simply could no longer pay for the needed
imports. And then Mexico found that a good deal of its industry could
not survive.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: When manufacturing jobs decline, is the country’s
manufacturing base threatened? Why is it so difficult to accept that

<h4 id="may-splintered-nature-of-knowledge-work">14 May Splintered
Nature of Knowledge Work</h4>
<p>Knowledge work is deeply splintered in most organizations.</p>
<p>K nowledge work is specialized, and because it is so specialized, it
is deeply splintered in most organizations. Managing all of these
specialties effectively is a big challenge for knowledge-based
organizations. For example, hospitals may use outsourcing, PEOs
(Professional Employer Organizations), and temp agencies to manage,
place, and satisfy the highly specialized knowledge worker. This results
in outsourcing part of the management task. The modern hospital provides
a great example of the management complexities created by the
splintering of knowledge work and the resultant use of outsourcing, PEOs
as well as temp agencies.</p>
<p>Even a fair-size community hospital with 275 to 300 beds will have
approximately 3,000 people working for it. Close to half will be
knowledge workers of one kind or another. Two of these groups, nurses
and specialists in the business departments, are fairly large, numbering
several hundred people each. But there are around thirty “paramedic
specialties”: the physical therapists and the people in the clinical
lab; the psychiatric case workers; the oncological technicians; the two
dozen people who prepare people for surgery; the people in sleep
clinics; the ultrasound technicians; the cardiac-clinic technicians; and
many, many more. Managing all these specialties makes the modern
hospital the most complex of modern organizations.</p>

<p>Outsourcing human resources management can save up to 30 percent of
the cost and increase employee satisfaction as well.</p>
<p>C ompanies are experiencing important changes in human resources
management and the Professional Employer Organizations, or PEOs, have
been one response to these changes. Primary factors driving the growth
of the industry include an increase in the complexity of laws and
regulations governing the human resource function and the subsequent
need for professional expertise to manage and maintain a workforce to
deal with these new realities. PEOs concentrate mainly on small- and
medium-size companies. The use of PEOs frees up managers to focus on
their core competencies rather than on employment-related rules,
regulations, and paperwork. This industry, which twenty years ago barely
existed, is now growing at a rate of 30 percent a year.</p>
<p>In contrast to PEOs, Business Process Outsourcing firms, or BPOs,
assume full responsibility for performing the work of the human resource
function in large enterprises, companies typically with twenty thousand
or more employees. The innovator and leader in the BPO industry, Exult,
founded in 1998, now manages the full spectrum of employee process such
as payroll, recruiting and staffing, training administration,
employee-data management, relocation, and severance administration for a
number of Global Fortune 500 companies. According to a study by
McKinsey, the management consultancy, outsourcing human resources
management in these ways can save up to 30 percent of the cost and
increase employee satisfaction as well.</p>

<p>A long with full-time employees, PEOs, and temp workers, there may

nontraditional employees in the new corporation. Increasingly, employees
take early retirement but they do not stop working. Instead, their
“second career” often takes an unconventional form. They may work
freelance, or part-time, or as temporaries, or for an outsourcing
contractor, or as contractors themselves. Such “early retirement to keep
on working” is particularly common among knowledge workers.</p>
<p>Attracting and holding these diverse groups will become the central
tasks of people management in the new corporation. These people do not
have permanent relationships with the business. They may not have to be
managed, but they have to be made productive. They will therefore have
to be deployed where their specialized knowledge can make the greatest
contribution. Managers need to work closely with their counterparts in
the outsource contractor organization on the professional development,
motivation, satisfaction, and productivity of these nontraditional
workers.</p>

Confederation</h4>
<p>From corporation to confederation.</p>
<p>H ere are two prominent examples of the corporation as a
confederation. Eighty years ago General Motors first developed both the
organizational concepts and the organizational structure upon which
today’s large corporations everywhere are based. And it was based for
seventy-five of these eighty years on two basic principles. We own as
much as possible of whatever we manufacture and we own everything we do.
Now it is experimenting with becoming the minority partner in competing
companies: Saab in Sweden, Suzuki and Isuzu in Japan, and it’s about to
become the controlling minority partner of Fiat. At the same time, it
has divested itself of 70 or 80 percent of what it manufactures.</p>
<p>The second example goes exactly the other way. It’s Toyota, which for
the last twenty years or so has been the most successful automotive
company. It is restructuring itself around its core
competency—manufacturing. It is moving away from having multiple
suppliers of parts and accessories to having only one or two everyplace.
At the same time, it uses its manufacturing competence to manage these
suppliers. They remain independent companies but they are basically part
of Toyota in terms of management.</p>

<p>One example is a “syndicate” being tested by several noncompeting
manufacturers in the European Union. Each of the constituent companies
is medium-sized, family-owned, and owner-managed. Each is a leader in a
narrow, highly engineered product line. Each is heavily
export-dependent. The individual companies intend to remain independent,
and to continue to design their products separately. They will also
continue to make them in their own plants for their main markets, and to
sell them in these markets. But for other markets, and especially for
emerging or less-developed countries, the syndicate will arrange for the
making of the products, either in syndicate-owned plants producing for
several of the members or by local contract manufacturers. The syndicate
will handle the delivery of all members’ products, and service them in
all markets. Each member will own a share of the syndicate, and the
syndicate, in turn, will own a small share of each member’s capital. If
this sounds familiar, it is because the model is the nineteenth-century

<p>Knowledge work includes manual operations that require industrial
engineering.</p>
<p>F rederick Winslow Taylor’s principles sound deceptively simple. The
first step in making the manual worker productive is to look at the task
and to analyze its constituent motions. The next step is to record each
motion, the physical effort it takes and the time it takes. Then motions
that are not needed can be eliminated. Then each of the motions that
remain as essential to obtaining the finished product is set up so as to
be done the simplest way, the easiest way, the way that puts the least
physical and mental strain on the operator, the way that requires the
least time. Then these motions are put together again into a “job” that
is in logical sequence. Finally, the tools needed to do the motions are
redesigned.</p>
<p>Taylor’s approach is still going to be the organizing principle in
countries in which manual work is the growth sector of society and
economy. In developed countries the challenge is no longer to make
manual work productive. The central challenge will be to make knowledge
workers productive. But, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge
work—including work requiring highly advanced and theoretical
knowledge—that includes manual operations. And the productivity of these
operations also requires Industrial Engineering, the name by which

Work</h4>
<p>Raising the productivity of service work is the first social
responsibility of management.</p>
<p>T he need to raise the productivity of service work is a social
priority in developed countries. Unless it is met, the developed world
faces increasing social tensions, increasing polarization, increasing
radicalization. It may increasingly face a new class war. Unless the
productivity of service work is rapidly improved, both the social and
economic position of a large class—as large a group as people making and
moving things ever were at their peak—must steadily go down. Real
incomes cannot for any length of time be higher than productivity. The
service workers may use their numerical strength to get higher wages
than their economic contribution justifies. But this only impoverishes
all of society with everybody’s real income going down and unemployment
going up. Or the incomes of the unskilled workers are allowed to go down
in relation to the steadily rising wages of the affluent knowledge
workers, with an increasing gulf between the two groups, an increasing
polarization into classes. In either case the service workers must
become alienated, increasingly bitter, increasingly see themselves as a
class apart.</p>
<p>We know how to raise service work productivity. This is production
work and what we have learned during the past hundred years about
increasing productivity applies to such work with minimum adaptation.

fundamental changes in the structure of organizations. Service work in

such as maintenance, and to a good deal of clerical work. “Outsourcing,”
moreover, will be applied increasingly to such work as drafting for
architects and to the technical or professional library. In fact,
American law firms already contract out to an outside computerized
“database” most of what their own law library used to do.</p>
<p>The greatest need for increased productivity is in activities that do
not lead to promotion into senior management within the organization.
But nobody in senior management is likely to be much interested in this
kind of work, know enough about it, care greatly for it, or even
consider it important. Such work does not fit the organization’s value
system. In the hospital, for instance, the value system is that of the
doctors and nurses. They are concerned with patient care. No one
therefore pays much attention to maintenance work, support work,
clerical work. We should therefore expect within a fairly short period

<p>Knowledge-worker productivity demands that we ask the question: “What

matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as important.</p>

Task in Knowledge Work</h4>
<p>In knowledge work, the how only comes after the what has been
answered.</p>
<p>I n manual work the task is always given. Wherever there still are
domestic servants, the owner of the house tells them what to do. The
machine or the assembly line programs the factory worker. But, in
knowledge work, what to do becomes the first and decisive question. For
knowledge workers are not programmed by the machine. They largely are in
control of their own tasks and must be in control of their own tasks.
For they, and only they, own and control the most expensive of the means
of production—their education—and their most important tool—their
knowledge. They do use other tools, of course, whether the nurse’s IV or
the engineer’s computer. But their knowledge decides how these tools are
being used and for what. They know what steps are most important and
what methods need to be used to complete the tasks; and it is their
knowledge that tells them what chores are unnecessary and should be
eliminated.</p>
<p>Work on knowledge-worker productivity therefore begins with asking
the knowledge workers themselves: What is your task? What should it be?
What should you be expected to contribute? and What hampers you in doing
your task and should be eliminated? The how only comes after the what
has been answered.</p>

<p>Results for a scientist—the advancement of scientific knowledge—may

<p>D efining the task makes it possible to define what the results of a
given task should be. There is often more than one right answer to the
question of what the right results are. Salespeople are right when they
define results as the largest sale per customer, and they are also right
when they define results as customer retention.</p>
<p>Hence the next and crucial step in making the knowledge worker
productive is to define what results are or should be in a particular
knowledge worker’s task. This is—and should be—a controversial decision.
It is also a risk-taking decision. Above all, it is the point where the
individual worker’s task and the mission of the organization converge
and have to be harmonized. It is up to management to decide whether the
department store aims at maximum sales per transaction or at maximum
sales per customer. It is up to management to decide whether the patient
or the physician is the primary customer of the hospital. And this
decision is going to be one of the permanent challenges for managers and
executives in the knowledge organization.</p>

in Knowledge Work</h4>
<p>Measuring quality in knowledge work sounds formidable.</p>
<p>In practice, it defines itself.</p>
<p>I n some knowledge work—and especially in some work requiring a high
degree of knowledge—we already measure quality. Surgeons, for instance,
are routinely measured, by their success rates in difficult and
dangerous procedures, for example, by the survival rates of their
open-heart surgical patients. But by and large we have, so far, mainly
judgments rather than measures regarding the quality of a great deal of
knowledge work. The main trouble is, however, not the difficulty of
measuring quality. It is the difficulty in defining what the task is and
what it should be.</p>
<p>The best example is the American school. Public schools in the
American inner city have become disaster areas. But next to them—in the
same location and serving the same kinds of children—are private schools
in which the kids behave well and learn well. There is endless
speculation to explain these enormous quality differences. But a major
reason is surely that the two kinds of schools define their tasks
differently. The typical public school defines its task as “helping the
underprivileged”; the typical private school (and especially the
parochial schools of the Catholic church) define their task as “enabling
those who want to learn, to learn.” One therefore is governed by its
scholastic failures, the other one by its scholastic successes.</p>

Learning in Knowledge Work</h4>
<p>A knowledge organization has to be both a learning organization and a
teaching organization.</p>
<p>K nowledge workers must have continuous learning built into their
tasks. And a knowledge organization has to be both a learning
organization and a teaching organization. Knowledge today, in all areas,
changes so fast that knowledge workers become obsolete pretty soon
unless they build continuous learning into their work. And that is not
just true of high knowledge such as that of the engineer, the chemist,
the biologist, or the accountant. It’s increasingly just as true of the
cardiac nurse, the person who handles payroll records, and the computer
repair person. But also, a knowledge organization depends on knowledge
specialists understanding what their colleagues are doing or trying to
do. And each of them has a different specialty. Knowledge workers need,
therefore, to hold themselves responsible for educating their
colleagues, especially when the knowledge base of their own specialty
changes.</p>
<p>This means that knowledge workers are well advised to sit down and
answer two questions:</p>
<p>What do I need to learn to keep abreast of the knowledge I am being
paid to know?</p>
<p>And what do my associates have to know and understand about my
knowledge area and about what it can and should contribute to the
organization and to their own work?</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Answer the two questions at the end of this

Yield of Existing Knowledge</h4>
<p>“Only connect.”</p>
<p>I n learning and teaching, we do have to focus on the tool. In usage,
we have to focus on the end result, on the task, on the work. “Only
connect” was the constant admonition of a great English novelist, E. M.
Forster. It has always been the hallmark of the artist, but equally of
the great scientist. At their level, the capacity to connect may be
inborn and part of that mystery we call “genius.” But to a large extent,
the ability to connect and thus to raise the yield of existing knowledge
is learnable. Eventually, it should become teachable. It requires a
methodology for problem definition—even more urgently perhaps than it
requires the methodology for “problem solving.” It requires systematic
analysis of the kind of knowledge and information a given problem
requires, and a methodology for organizing the stages in which a given
problem can be tackled—the methodology that underlies what we now call
“systems research.” It requires what might be called “Organizing
Ignorance”—and there is always so much more ignorance around than there
is knowledge.</p>
<p>Specialization into knowledges has given us enormous performance
potential in each area. But because knowledges are so specialized, we
need also a methodology, a discipline, a process to turn this potential
into performance. Otherwise, most of the available knowledge will not
become productive; it will remain mere information. To make knowledge
productive, we will have to learn to connect.</p>

knowledge worker sees herself as just another “professional,” no
different from the lawyer, the teacher, the preacher, the doctor, the
government servant of yesterday. She has the same education. She may
realize that she depends on the organization for access to income and

would be no job for her. But she also realizes, and rightly so, that the

<p>We have an approach that relates economics to human values.</p>
<p>T omorrow’s economics must answer the questions: “How do we relate
the way we run a business to results? What are results?” The traditional
answer—“the bottom line”—is treacherous. Under a bottom-line philosophy,
we cannot relate the short run to the long term, and yet the balance
between the two is a crucial test of management.</p>
<p>The beacons of productivity and innovation must be our guideposts. If
we achieve profits at the cost of downgrading productivity or not
innovating, they aren’t profits. We’re destroying capital. On the other
hand, if we continue to improve productivity of all key resources and
improve our innovative standing, we are going to be profitable. Not only
today, but tomorrow. In looking at knowledge applied to human work as
the source of wealth, we also see the function of the economic
organization. For the first time we have an approach that makes
economics a human discipline and relates it to human values, a theory
that gives a businessperson a yardstick to measure whether she’s still
moving in the right direction and whether her results are real or
delusions. We are on the threshold of posteconomic theory, grounded in
what we know and understand about the generation of wealth.</p>

<p>Knowledge workers must take responsibility for managing
themselves.</p>
<p>K nowledge workers are likely to outlive their employing
organization. Their average working life is likely to be fifty years.
But the average life expectancy of a successful business is only thirty
years. Increasingly, therefore, knowledge workers will outlive any one
employer, and will have to be prepared for more than one job. And this
means most knowledge workers will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES. They have
to place themselves where they can make the greatest contribution; they
will have to learn to develop themselves. They will have to learn how
and when to change what they do, how they do it, and when they do
it.</p>
<p>The key to managing oneself is to know: Who am I? What are my
strengths? How do I work to achieve results? What are my values? Where
do I belong? Where do I not belong? Finally, a crucial step in
successfully managing oneself is FEEDBACK ANALYSIS. Record what you
expect the results to be of every key action or key decision you take,
and then compare ACTUAL RESULTS nine months or a year later to your
expectations.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Manage yourself by knowing your strengths, values, and
where you do best. Then use feedback analysis by, first, recording what
you expect the results of key actions or decisions to be, and then nine
months or a year later, comparing the actual results to those
expectations.</p>

<p>Managing Oneself (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<h4 id="june-a-successful-information-based-organization">2 June A
Successful Information-Based Organization</h4>
<p>The system worked because it was designed to ensure that each of its
members had the information he needed to do his job.</p>
<p>T he best example of a large and successful information-based
organization, and one without any middle management at all, was the
British civil administration in India. The British ran the Indian
subcontinent for two hundred years, from the middle of the eighteenth
century through World War II. The Indian civil service never had more
than one thousand members to administer the vast and densely populated
subcontinent. Most of the Britishers lived alone in isolated outposts
with their nearest countryman a day or two of travel away, and for the
first hundred years there was no telegraph or railroad.</p>
<p>The organization structure was totally flat. Each district officer
reported directly to the “COO,” the provincial political secretary. And
since there were nine provinces, each political secretary had at least
one hundred people reporting directly to him. Each month the district
officer spent a whole day writing a full report to the political
secretary in the provincial capital. He discussed each of his principal
tasks. He put down in detail what he had expected would happen with
respect to each of them, what actually did happen, and why, if there was
a discrepancy, the two differed. Then he wrote down what he expected
would happen in the ensuing month with respect to each key task and what
he was going to do about it, asked questions about policy, and commented
on long-term opportunities, threats, and needs. In turn, the political
secretary wrote back a full comment.</p>

and the British civil administration in India.</p>

<h4 id="june-the-score-in-information-based-organizations">3 June The
“Score” in Information-Based Organizations</h4>
<p>All the specialists in the hospital share a common “score”: the care
and cure of the sick.</p>
<p>W hat can we say about the requirements of the information-based
organization? Several hundred musicians and their CEO, the conductor,
can play together because they all have the same score. Similarly, all
the specialists in the hospital share a common mission: the care and
cure of the sick. The diagnosis is their “score”; it dictates specific
action for the X-ray lab, the dietitian, the physical therapist, and the
rest of the medical team. Information-based organizations, in other
words, require clear, simple, common objectives that translate into
particular actions.</p>
<p>Because the “players” in an information-based organization are
specialists, they cannot be told how to do their work. There are
probably few orchestra conductors who could coax even one note out of a
French horn, let alone show the horn player how to do it. But the
conductor can focus the horn player’s skill and knowledge on the
musicians’ joint performance. And this focus is what the leaders of an
information-based business must be able to achieve. An information-based
business must be structured around goals that clearly state management’s
performance expectations for the enterprise and for each part and
specialist and around organized feedback that compares results with
these performance expectations so that every member can exercise
self-control.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Have a common “score” for your organization that

Information Responsibility</h4>
<p>Information specialists are tool makers. They can tell us what tool
to use to hammer upholstery nails into a chair. We need to decide
whether we should be upholstering a chair at all.</p>
<p>A requirement of an information-based organization is that everyone
take information responsibility. The bassoonist in the orchestra takes
information responsibility every time he plays a note. Doctors and
para-medics work with an elaborate system of reports and an information
center, the nurses’ station on the patient’s floor. The district officer
in India acted on this responsibility every time he filed a report. The
key to such a system is that everyone asks: “Who in this organization
depends on me for what information? And on whom, in turn, do I depend?”
Each person’s list will always include superiors and subordinates. But
the most important names on it will be those of colleagues, people with
whom one’s primary relationship is coordination. The relationship of the
internist, the surgeon, and the anesthesiologist is one example. But the
relationship of a biochemist, a pharmacologist, the medical director in
charge of clinical testing, and a marketing specialist in a
pharmaceutical company is no different. It, too, requires each party to
take the fullest information responsibility.</p>

information to the right people at the right time. Make a list of whom
you depend on for what information and, in turn, who depends on you.</p>

<p>O pportunities for specialists in an information-based business
organization should be more plentiful than they are in an orchestra or
hospital, let alone in the Indian civil service. But as in these
organizations, they will primarily be opportunities for advancement
within the specialty, and for limited advancement at that. Advancement
into “management” will be the exception, for the simple reason that
there will be far fewer middle-management positions to move into.</p>
<p>But to professional specialists—and to their management
colleagues—the only meaningful opportunities are promotions into
management. And the prevailing compensation structure in practically all
businesses reinforces this attitude because it is heavily biased toward
managerial positions and titles. There are no easy answers to this
problem. Some help may come from looking at large law and consulting
firms, where even the most senior partners tend to be specialists and
associates who will not make partner are outplaced fairly early on. But
whatever scheme is eventually developed will work only if the values and
compensation structure of business are drastically changed.</p>

<p>Traditional organizations rest on command authority.</p>
<p>Information-based organizations rest on responsibility.</p>

technology, it must ask the questions: “Who requires what information,
when and where?” And then those management positions and management
layers whose duty it has been to report rather than to do can be
scrapped.</p>
<p>But, the information-based organization demands self-discipline and
upward responsibility from the first-level supervisor all the way to top
management. Traditional organizations rest on command authority.
Information-based organizations rest on responsibility. The flow is
circular from the bottom up and then down again. The information-based
system can, therefore, function only if each individual and each unit
accepts responsibility: for their goals and their priorities, for their
relationships, and for their communications. This in turn makes possible
fast decisions and quick responses. These advantages will be obtained
only if there are understanding, shared values, and, above all, mutual
respect. If every player needs to know the score, there has to be a
common language, a common core of unity. If the organization is
information-based, diversification in which financial control is the
only language is bound to collapse into the confusion of the Tower of
Babel.</p>

<p>W hy should people who, for ten or fifteen years, have been competent
suddenly become incompetent? The reason in practically all cases I have
seen, is that people continue in their new assignment to do what made
them successful in the old assignment and what earned them the
promotion. Then they turn incompetent, not because they have become
incompetent, but because they are doing the wrong things.</p>
<p>What the new assignment requires is not superior knowledge or
superior talent. It requires concentration on the things that the new
assignment requires, the things that are crucial to the new challenge,
the new job, the new task.</p>

So, he chuckled and said, “I didn’t expect you to be able to answer it.
But if you still can’t answer it by the time you’re fifty, you will have
wasted your life.”</p>
<p>I’m always asking that question: “What do you want to be remembered
for?” It is a question that induces you to renew yourself, because it
pushes you to see yourself as a different person—the person you can

that question early enough in your life so that you will continue to ask
it as you go through life. It is a question that induces you to renew

one’s own development is to strive for excellence. Workmanship counts,
not just because it makes such a difference in the quality of the job
done, but because it makes such a difference in the person doing the
job. Expect the job to provide stimulus only if you work on your own
self-renewal, only if you create the excitement, the challenge, the
transformation that makes an old job enriching over and over again. The
most effective road to self-renewal is to look for the unexpected
success and run with it.</p>
<p>The critical factor for success is accountability—holding yourself
accountable. Everything else flows from that. The important thing is not
that you have rank, but that you have responsibility. To be accountable,
you must take the job seriously enough to recognize: I’ve got to grow up
to the job. By focusing on accountability, people take a bigger view of

one’s value system. It may not appear to that person as making a
contribution and as something to which to devote one’s life (or even a
substantial portion thereof).</p>
<p>I, too, many years ago, had to decide between what I was doing well
and successfully, and my values. I was doing extremely well as a young
investment banker in London in the mid-1930s; it clearly fitted my
strengths. Yet I did not see myself making a contribution as an asset
manager of any kind. People, I realized, were my values. And I saw no
point in being the richest man in the cemetery. I had no money, no other
job in a deep Depression, and no prospects. But I quit—and it was the

a person?” This requires understanding what kind of work environment you
need to do your best: A big organization or a small one? Working with
people or alone? In situations of uncertainty or not? Under pressures of
deadlines?</p>
<p>If the thoughtful answer to the question “Where do I belong?” is that
you don’t belong where you currently work, the next question is why? Is
it because you can’t accept the values of the organization? Is the
organization corrupt? That will certainly damage you, because you become
cynical and contemptuous of yourself if you find yourself in a situation
where the values are incompatible with your own. Or you might find
yourself working for a boss who corrupts because he’s a politician or
because he’s concerned only with his career. Or—most tricky of all—a
boss whom you admire fails in the crucial duty of a boss: to support,
foster, and promote capable subordinates. The right decision is to quit
if you are in the wrong place, if it is basically corrupt, or if your

<p>A ttracting and holding knowledge workers have become two of the
central tasks of people management. We already know what does not work:
bribery. In the past ten or fifteen years many businesses in America
have used bonuses or stock options to attract and keep knowledge
workers. It always fails when falling profits eliminate the bonus or
falling stock prices make the option worthless. Then both the employee
and the spouse feel bitter and betrayed. Of course knowledge workers
need to be satisfied with their pay, because dissatisfaction with income
and benefits is a powerful disincentive. The incentives, however, are
different.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers know they can leave. They have both mobility and
self-confidence. This means they have to be treated and managed as
volunteers, in the same way as volunteers who work for not-for-profit
organizations. The first thing such people want to know is what the
company is trying to do and where it is going. Next, they are interested
in personal achievement and personal responsibility—which means they
have to be put in the right job. Knowledge workers expect continuous
learning and continuous training. Above all, they want respect, not so
much for themselves, but for their area of knowledge. Knowledge workers
expect to make the decisions in their own area.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Manage professionals as volunteers by defining for them

stake in the business through their retirement and pension funds. By
2000, pension funds and mutual funds in the U.S. had come to own the
majority of the share capital of America’s large companies. This has
given shareholders the power to demand short-term rewards. But the need
for a secure retirement income will increasingly focus people’s minds on
the future value of the investment. Corporations, therefore, will have
to pay attention both to their short-term business results and to their
long-term performance as providers of retirement benefits. The two are
not irreconcilable, but they are different, and they will have to be

nineteenth century, the biggest financial need of common people was for
life insurance to protect their families in the event of their early
death. With life expectancies now almost double those of the nineteenth
century, the biggest need of common people today is protection against
the threat of living too long. The nineteenth-century “life insurance”
was really “death insurance.” The pension fund is “old-age” insurance.
It is an essential institution in a society in which most people can
expect to outlive their working lives by many years.</p>

<p>It requires quite different skills and different rules to invest in
the old and existing as opposed to the new ventures. The person who is
investing in what already exists is, in effect, trying to minimize risk.
He invests in established trends and markets, in proven technology and
management performance. The entrepreneurial investor must operate on the
assumption that out of ten investments, seven will go sour and have to
be liquidated with more or less a total loss. There is no way to judge
in advance which of the ten investments in the young and the new will
turn out failures and which will succeed. The entrepreneurial skill does

They are not business-focused, nor could they be. They are asset
managers. Yet they need in-depth business analysis of the companies they
collectively own. And they need an institutional structure in which
management accountability is embedded.</p>

systematic evaluation of business performance: starting with mission and
strategy, through marketing, innovation, productivity, people
development, community relations, all the way to profitability.</p>

Unemployment</h4>
<p>Inflation is the greatest threat to retired people on pensions.</p>
<p>E ver since the Great Depression, unemployment has been seen as both
the endemic and the most dangerous disease of modern society and
economy. Under pension-fund socialism, inflation can be expected to take
over both roles instead. Inflation is the greatest threat to the retired
people on pensions, and an equally great one to the workers over fifty
with an increasing stake in the future purchasing power of their
retirement benefits. Together, these two groups constitute a
near-majority of the adult population. These two groups, as a result of
pension-fund socialism, have a far greater interest in preventing
inflation than ever existed before. A substantial constituency of this
kind, sharing a common concern, is by definition a major “interest
group” in the American political system and a potent political force. At
the same time unemployment is far less of a threat, if a threat at all,
for the “constituency” of the pension funds, that is, retired people and
older workers.</p>

<p>It is management’s job to get the right regulation enacted.</p>
<p>T o make elimination of a detrimental business impact into a business
opportunity should always be attempted. But it cannot be done in many
cases. More often eliminating an impact means increasing the costs. What
was an “externality” for which the general public paid becomes business
cost. It therefore becomes a competitive disadvantage unless everybody
in the industry accepts the same rule. And this, in most cases, can be
done only by regulation—that means by some form of public action.</p>
<p>Whenever an impact cannot be eliminated without an increase in cost,
it becomes incumbent upon management to think ahead and work out the
regulation that is most likely to solve the problem at the minimum cost
and with the greatest benefit to public and business alike. And it is
then management’s job to work at getting the right regulation enacted.
Management—and not only business management—has shunned this
responsibility.</p>

I was in my early thirties, that I really knew what I am good at and
where I belong. But I then resolved that, whatever my life’s work would

<p>Managements have tended to reject ideas for the self-governing plant

prerogatives.</p>
<p>O f all my work on management and “the anatomy of industrial order,”
I consider my ideas for the self-governing plant community and for the
responsible worker to be the most important and most original. A
self-governing plant community is the assumption of managerial
responsibility by the individual employee, the work team, and the
employee group alike for the structure of the individual job, for the
performance of major tasks, and for the management of such community
affairs as shift schedules, vacation schedules, overtime assignments,
industrial safety, and, above all, employee benefits.</p>
<p>But managements have tended to reject these ideas as an
“encroachment” on their prerogatives. And labor unions have been
outright hostile: they are convinced that they need a visible and
identifiable “boss,” who can be fought as “the enemy.” Yet what was
achieved in these areas in World War II went way beyond anything that is
being trumpeted today as a breakthrough, such as the highly publicized
attempt to replace the assembly line at some Swedish automobile
companies. This actually goes much less far than the assembly lines that
have been standard in American industry, not to mention the
responsibility factory-floor work teams have assumed routinely at IBM,
hardly a particularly “permissive” company.</p>

business can provide the new communities that every major city in the
world needs. That is the task of the nongovernmental, nonbusiness,
nonprofit organizations. Only the social sector can create what we now
need, communities for citizens—and especially for the highly educated
knowledge workers who increasingly dominate developed societies. One
reason for this is that only nonprofit organizations can provide the
enormous diversity of communities we need—from churches to professional
associations, from organizations taking care of the homeless to health
clubs…</p>
<p>The nonprofit organizations are also the only ones that can satisfy
the second need for effective community, the need for effective
citizenship. The twentieth century saw an explosive growth of both

<p>T he modern corporation as a child of laissez-faire economics and of
the market society is based on a creed whose greatest weakness is the
inability to see the need for status and function of the individual in
society. In its refusal to concern itself with the unsuccessful
majority, the market society was a true child of Calvinism with its
refusal to concern itself with the great majority that is not elected to
be saved. Following the English philosopher Herbert Spencer, this belief
is now expressed usually in the language of Darwinian “survival of the
fittest” rather than in theological terms. But this does not alter the
fact that the philosophy of the market society only makes sense if the
unsuccessful are seen as “rejected by the Lord” with whom to have pity
would be as sinful as questioning the decision of the Lord. We can only
deny social status and function to the economically unsuccessful if we
are convinced that lack of economic success is (a) always a person’s own
fault, and (b) a reliable indication of his or her worthlessness as a

it’s a dull routine, but you enjoy it.</p>
<p>The same is true of people I’ve seen in business who enjoy the work.
Their routine is: It’s got to be done, and I enjoy it because I enjoy
the work. And that is the difference, I believe, not between mediocrity

where the whole organization grows and then the process changes—and an
organization that maybe does very well but nobody misses it after five

requires that they know management. The first task of the manager is
indeed to manage the institution for the mission for which it has been
designed. The first task of the business manager is, therefore, economic
performance. But at the same time she faces the tasks of making the work
productive and the worker achieving, and of providing for the quality of
life for society and individual. But a leadership group also has to have
legitimacy. It has to be accepted by the community as “right.” They need
to ground their authority in a moral commitment, which at the same time,
expresses the purpose and character of organizations. There is only one
such principle of morality. It is the purpose of organization, and,

Government has proved incompetent at solving social problems. The

<p>Instead of using the federal tax system to encourage donations to
nonprofits, we have the IRS making one move after the other to curtail
donations to nonprofits. Each of these moves is presented as “closing a

hostility to the nonprofits—not too different from the bureaucracy’s
hostility to markets and private enterprise in the former Communist
countries. The success of the nonprofits undermines the bureaucracy’s

that if these young men and women had gone to jail, the majority would
have become habitual criminals. But the Salvation Army was able to
rehabilitate 80 percent of them through a strict work program that was
run largely by volunteers. And the program cost a fraction of what it
would have to keep the offenders behind bars.</p>
<p>Underlying this program and many other effective nonprofit endeavors
is a commitment to management. Forty years ago, management was a dirty
word for those involved in nonprofit organizations. It meant business,
and nonprofits prided themselves on being free of the taint of
commercialism and above such sordid considerations as the bottom line.
Now most of them have learned that nonprofits need management even more
than business does, precisely because they lack the discipline of the
bottom line. The nonprofits are, of course, still dedicated to “doing
good.” But they also realize that good intentions are no substitute for
organization and leadership, for accountability, performance, and

<p>A theory of the business has three parts. First, there are
assumptions about the environment of the organization: society and its

about the environment define what an organization is paid for. Second,
there are assumptions about the specific mission of the organization.
The assumptions about mission define what an organization considers to
be meaningful results—they point to how it envisions itself making a
difference in the economy and society at large. Third, there are
assumptions about the core competencies needed to accomplish the
organization’s mission. Core competencies define where an organization
must excel in order to maintain leadership.</p>

England—Simon Marks and his three brothers-in-law—decided in the early
1920s that a humdrum penny bazaar should become an agent of social
change, World War I had profoundly shaken their country’s class
structure. It had also created masses of new buyers for good-quality,
stylish, and inexpensive merchandise such as lingerie, blouses, and
stockings—Marks and Spencer’s first successful product categories. Marks
and Spencer then systematically set to work developing brand-new and
unheard-of core competencies. Until then, the core competency of a
merchant was the ability to buy well. Marks and Spencer decided that it
was the merchant, rather than the manufacturer, who knew the customer.
Therefore, the merchant, not the manufacturer, should design the
products, develop them, and find producers to make the goods to his
design, specifications, and costs. This new definition of a merchant
took five to eight years to develop and make acceptable to traditional
suppliers, who had always seen themselves as “manufacturers,” not
“subcontractors.”</p>

pursue what is expedient rather than what is right. It stops thinking.

transportation, or energy. These general terms may make good slogans for

<p>There is no loss to the customer by eliminating activities that do

<p>A ctivity-based costing provides the foundation for integrating into
one analysis the several procedures required to create customer value.
With activity costs as a starting point, the enterprise can separate
activities that add value to customers from those that do not, and
eliminate the latter. The chain of value-creating activities uncovered
during value analysis is the starting point for analyzing the underlying
process of value creation. Process analysis seeks to: improve the
features of the product or service, restructure the process while
reducing costs, and maintain or improve quality.</p>
<p>Process analysis in an automobile company involves designing and
redesigning components and subfunctions in order to carry out each
function at predetermined cost targets. For instance, the basic function
of an automobile is to provide transportation, but secondary functions
include comfort, fuel efficiency, and safety. Each of the functions and
subfunctions require components or services that create value for the
customer. Each also contributes to the quality of the automobile as well
as to the cost. A process team is formed from personnel who perform the
value-chain activities. This team often includes suppliers and
customers. The task of the team is to identify the functions the product
or service is to perform and to analyze the components or services that
go into each function with the objective of achieving value and quality
objectives while meeting cost targets.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Eliminate activities that do not create value. Analyze
the underlying processes of value-creating activities and redesign the

Competencies</h4>
<p>Core competencies meld customer value with a special ability of the

<p>L eadership rests on being able to do something others cannot do at
all or find difficult to do even poorly. It rests on core competencies
that meld market or customer value with a special ability of the
producer or supplier. Some examples: the ability of the Japanese to
miniaturize electronic components, which is based on their
three-hundred-year-old artistic tradition of putting landscape paintings
on a tiny lacquered box; or the almost unique ability GM has had for
eighty years to make successful acquisitions.</p>
<p>But how does one identify both the core competencies one has already
and those the business needs to take and maintain a leadership position?
How does one find out whether one’s core competence is improving or
weakening? Or whether it is still the right core competence and what
changes it might need? The first step is to keep careful track of one’s
own and one’s competitors’ performance, looking especially for
unexpected successes and for unexpected poor performance in areas where
one should have done well. The successes demonstrate what the market
values and will pay for. They indicate where the business enjoys a
leadership advantage. The nonsuccesses should be viewed as the first
indication that the market is changing or that the company’s
competencies are weakening.</p>

organization—not just businesses—needs one core competence: innovation.
And every organization needs a way to record and appraise its innovative
performance. In organizations already doing that—among them, several
topflight pharmaceutical manufacturers—the starting point is not the
company’s own performance. It is a careful record of the innovations in
the entire field during a given period. Which of them were truly
successful? How many of them were ours? Is our performance commensurate
with our objectives? With the direction of the market? With our market
standing? With our research spending? Are our successful innovations in
the areas of greatest growth and opportunity? How many of the truly
important innovation opportunities did we miss? Why? Because we did not
see them? Or because we saw them but dismissed them? Or because we
botched them? And how well do we do in converting an innovation into a
commercial product? A good deal of that, admittedly, is assessment
rather than measurement. It raises rather than answers questions, but it
raises the right questions.</p>

<h4 id="july-exploiting-success">10 July Exploiting Success</h4>
<p>Change leaders should starve problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>T he first—and usually the best—opportunity for successful change is
to exploit one’s own successes and to build on them. Problems cannot be
ignored. And serious problems have to be taken care of. But to be change
leaders, enterprises have to focus on opportunities. They have to starve
problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>This requires a small but fundamental procedural change: an
additional “first page” to the monthly report, one that should precede
the page that shows the problems. It requires a page that focuses on
where results are better than expected, whether in terms of sales,
revenues, profits, or volume. As much time then should be spent on this
new first page as has traditionally been spent on the problem page.
Enterprises that succeed in being change leaders make sure that they
staff the opportunities. The way to do this is to list the opportunities
on one page and then to list the organization’s performing and capable
people on another page. Then one allocates the ablest and most
performing people to the top opportunities. The best example, perhaps,
is the Japanese company Sony. It has built itself into one of the
world’s leaders in a number of major businesses by systematically
exploiting one success after the other—big or small.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Every month, prepare a page that lists opportunities,
including areas where results were better than expected, whether in
terms of sales, revenues, profits, or volume. Follow this with another
page that lists the organization’s most capable people. Then allocate
the best performers to the top opportunities.</p>

<p>However, continuing improvement requires a major decision. What
constitutes “performance” in a given area? If performance is to be
improved, we need to define clearly what “performance” means. For
example, a major commercial bank decided that the way to improve
performance in its branches was to offer new and more advanced financial
“products.” But when the bank introduced the new products in its
branches, it rapidly lost customers. Only then did the bank find out
that to customers, performance of a bank branch means not having to wait
in line for routine transactions. The bank’s solution was to concentrate
the tellers at the branches on the simple, repetitive, routine services,
which require neither skill nor time. The new financial products were
assigned to different groups of people who were moved to separate
tables, with big signs advertising the products in which each table
specialized. As soon as this was done, business went up sharply, both
for the traditional and the new services.</p>

<p>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</p>
<h4 id="july-systematic-innovation">12 July Systematic Innovation</h4>
<p>Successful entrepreneurs do not wait until the “the Muse kisses them”
and gives them a bright idea; they go to work.</p>
<p>S ystematic innovation means monitoring seven sources for innovative
opportunity. The first four sources lie within the enterprise, whether
business or public-service institution, or within an industry or service
sector. The unexpected —the unexpected success, the unexpected failure,
the unexpected outside event; the incongruity —between reality as it
actually is and reality as it is assumed to be or as it “ought to be”;
innovation based on process need; changes in industry structure or
market structure that catch everyone unawares. The second set of sources
for innovative opportunity involves changes outside the enterprise or
industry: demographics (population changes); changes in perception,
mood, and meaning; new knowledge, both scientific and nonscientific.</p>
<p>The lines between these seven source areas of innovative
opportunities are blurred, and there is considerable overlap between
them. They can be likened to seven windows, each on a different side of
the same building. Each window shows some features that can also be seen
from the window on either side of it. But the view from the center of
each is distinct and different.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Monitor the seven windows of innovative opportunity:
the unexpected; the incongruity; process need; changes in industry
structure or market structure; changes in demographics; changes in
perception, mood, and meaning; and new knowledge.</p>
<p>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</p>
<h4 id="july-unexpected-success">13 July Unexpected Success</h4>
<p>It takes an effort to perceive unexpected success as one’s own best
opportunity.</p>
<p>I t is precisely because the unexpected jolts us out of our
preconceived notions, our assumptions, our certainties, that it is such
a fertile source of innovation. In no other area are innovative
opportunities less risky and their pursuit less arduous. Yet the
unexpected success is almost totally neglected; worse, managements tend
actively to reject it. One reason why it is difficult for management to
accept unexpected success is that all of us tend to believe that
anything that has lasted a fair amount of time must be “normal” and go
on “forever.”</p>
<p>This explains why one of the major U.S. steel companies, around 1970,
rejected the “mini-mill.” Management knew that its steelworks were
rapidly becoming obsolete and would need billions of dollars of
investment to be modernized. A new, smaller “mini-mill” was the
solution. Almost by accident, such a “mini-mill” was acquired. It soon
began to grow rapidly and to generate cash and profits. Some of the
younger people within the steel company proposed that available
investment funds be used to acquire additional “mini-mills” and to build
new ones. Top management indignantly vetoed the proposal. “The
integrated steelmaking process is the only right one,” top management
argued. “Everything else is cheating—a fad, unhealthy, and unlikely to
endure.” Needless to say, thirty years later the only parts of the steel
industry in America that were still healthy, growing, and reasonably
prosperous were “mini-mills.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Don’t neglect or reject unexpected success. Identify
it, absorb it, and learn from it.</p>

<h4 id="july-unexpected-failure">14 July Unexpected Failure</h4>
<p>Failure should always be considered a symptom of an innovative
opportunity.</p>
<p>T he unexpected failure demands that you go out, look around, and
listen. A competitor’s unexpected success or failure is equally
important. Failure should always be considered a symptom of an
innovative opportunity, and taken seriously as such. One does not just
“analyze.” One goes out to investigate. A good many failures are, of
course, nothing but mistakes, the results of greed, stupidity,
thoughtless bandwagon-climbing, or incompetence, whether in design or
execution. Yet if something fails despite being carefully planned,
carefully designed, and conscientiously executed, that failure often
bespeaks underlying change and with it, opportunity.</p>
<p>Unexpected failure often informs us of underlying changes in customer
values and perceptions. The assumptions upon which a product or service,
its design or market strategy, were based can quickly become outdated.
Perhaps customers have changed their value proposition—they may be
buying the same thing, but they are actually purchasing a very different
value. For example, after the failure of the Edsel, Ford decided that
income segmentation no longer applied to the automobile industry.
Rather, it was lifestyle segmentation that mattered to consumers.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify an important unexpected failure, yours or a
competitor’s. Identify plausible explanations for the failure. Apply
these lessons to your current business.</p>

<h4 id="july-incongruity">15 July Incongruity</h4>
<p>The incongruity bespeaks an underlying “fault.”</p>
<p>T here is often a discrepancy between “what is” and what management
thinks “ought to be” that represents an incongruity within an industry,
a market, and a process. The incongruity may be clearly visible to the
people within or close to the industry, market, or process. Insiders may
notice it but think, “this is the way it has always been,” as a reason
for not initiating a change. Change leaders exploit these incongruities
to the organization’s advantage.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the unequal information in the hands of buyers and
sellers of automobiles. There are a few things about buying vehicles
most of us dislike. These include haggling over price, misleading ads,
spending hours at a dealership while the salesperson goes back and forth
between the sales manager and us, and so on. Several online
organizations have created one-stop shopping for used and new
automobiles with complete and accurate information about vehicles of all
types, including warranties, financing, and insurance. They have leveled
the playing field for consumers.</p>

<h4 id="july-process-need">16 July Process Need</h4>
<p>“Necessity is the mother of invention.”</p>
<p>T he first two possibilities for innovation are opportunity driven.
But the third is anchored in the old proverb, “Necessity is the mother
of invention.” Here need is the source of innovation. I call it process
need. Everybody in the organization always knows that the process need
exists. Yet usually no one does anything about it. However, when the
innovation appears, it is immediately accepted as “obvious” and soon
becomes “standard.”</p>
<p>Process innovation starts with the job to be done and requires the
presence of five basic criteria: a self-contained process, a weak or
missing link, a clear definition of the objectives, clearly defined
specifications for the solution, and widespread realization that there
ought to be a better way. Take for example, O. M. Scott and Company, a
leader among American producers of lawn-care products. It gained its
leadership position based upon a simple gadget called the spreader that
users can set to evenly distribute proper quantities of lawn-care
chemicals. Without such a tool there was an internal incongruity in the
existing process and this incongruity frustrated consumers who were
unable to evenly distribute chemicals. There are now many such
spreaders.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Define a process in your organization that has a
missing link. Describe the process, the objectives of the process, the
level of awareness of the existence of a missing link, the missing link,
and the specifications for a solution.</p>

Structure</h4>
<p>Market and industry structures are quite brittle.</p>
<p>One small scratch and they disintegrate, often fast.</p>
<p>I ndustry and market structures appear so solid that the people in an
industry are likely to consider them foreordained, part of the order of
nature, and certain to endure forever. A change in market or industry
structure is a major opportunity for innovation. In industry structure,
a change requires entrepreneurship from every member of the industry. It
requires that each one ask anew: “What is our business?” And each of the
members will have to give a different, but above all a new, answer to
that question. Large, dominant producers and suppliers, having been
successful and unchallenged for many years, tend to be arrogant. At
first they dismiss the newcomer as insignificant and, indeed,
amateurish. But even when the newcomer takes a larger and larger share
of their business, they find it hard to mobilize themselves for
counteraction.</p>
<p>For example, the U.S. Post Office did not react when UPS and FedEx
took away larger and larger shares of its business. What had made the
Post Office so vulnerable was rapid growth in the demand for urgent
delivery of time-sensitive documents and packages.</p>

<h4 id="july-demographics">18 July Demographics</h4>
<p>Changing demographics is both a highly productive and a highly
dependable innovative opportunity.</p>
<p>O f all external changes, demographics—defined as changes in
population, its size, age structure, composition, employment,
educational status, and income—are the clearest. They are unambiguous.
They have the most predictable consequences. They have a major impact on
what will be bought, by whom, and in what quantities.</p>
<p>Demographic shifts may be inherently unpredictable, yet they do have
long lead times before impact, and lead times, moreover, that are
predictable. Particularly important are age distribution and with the
highest predictive value changes in the center of population gravity,
that is, in the age group that at any given time constitutes both the
largest and the fastest-growing age cohort in the population. In the
U.S. in the 1960s, this was a shift to teenagers as the fastest-growing
group. With these shifts came a change in what would be considered
“representative” behavior. The teenagers of course continued to behave
like teenagers. But that was widely dismissed as the way teenagers
behave rather than seen as a change in the constitutive values of
behavior of society. Statistics are only the starting point. For those
genuinely willing to go out into the field, to look and to listen,
changing demographics is both a highly productive and a highly
dependable innovative opportunity.</p>

<p>If general perception changes from seeing the glass as “half-full” to

<p>I n mathematics there is no difference between “the glass is half
full” and “the glass is half empty.” But the meanings of these two
statements are totally different, and so are their consequences. If
general perception changes from seeing the glass as “half full” to
seeing it as “half empty,” there are major innovative opportunities.</p>
<p>Unexpected success or unexpected failure is often an indication of
change in perception and meaning for the consumer. When a change in
perception takes place, the facts do not change. Their meaning does. For
example, American health hypochondria represents a change in American
values, such as worship of youth, more than a reaction to the health
statistics. Forty years ago even minor improvements in the nation’s
health were seen as major steps forward. Now dramatic improvements are
barely paid attention to. This change in perception has created a vast
market for new health-care magazines, alternative sources of medicine,
physical fitness centers, and other “wellness” goods and services.</p>

<h4 id="july-new-knowledge">20 July New Knowledge</h4>
<p>In the theory and practice of innovation and entrepreneurship, the
bright-idea innovation belongs in the appendix.</p>
<p>N ew knowledge is not the most reliable or most predictable source of
successful innovations. For all the visibility, glamour, and importance
of science-based innovation, it is actually the least reliable and least
predictable one. Knowledge-based innovation has the longest lead-time of
any innovation. First, there is a long time span between the emergence
of new knowledge, and it’s becoming applicable to technology. And then
there is another long period before the new technology turns into
products, processes, or services in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The introduction of innovation creates excitement and attracts a host
of competitors, meaning that innovators have to be right the first time.
They are unlikely to get a second chance. Here, even successful
innovators almost immediately have far more company than they want and
must prepare themselves to weather the storm that lies ahead. For
example, Apple Computer invented the personal computer. IBM was able to
wrest market leadership from Apple through creative imitation. Apple
failed to maintain its leadership position and became a niche player
because it failed to predict and respond to the competition it would
face. In the theory and practice of innovation and entrepreneurship, the
bright-idea innovation belongs in the appendix. But it should be
appreciated and rewarded. It represents qualities that society needs:
initiative, ambition, and ingenuity.</p>

Innovation in Public-Service Institutions</h4>
<p>Most innovations in public-service institutions are imposed on them
either by outsiders or by catastrophe.</p>
<p>I nstitutions such as government agencies, labor unions, churches,
universities and schools, hospitals, community and charitable
organizations, professional and trade associations, and the like need to
be entrepreneurial and innovative fully as much as any business does.
Indeed, they may need it more.</p>
<p>The rapid changes in today’s society, technology, and economy are
simultaneously an even greater threat to them and an even greater
opportunity. Yet public-service institutions find it far more difficult
to innovate than even the most “bureaucratic” company. The “existing”
seems to be even more of an obstacle. To be sure, every service
institution likes to get bigger. In the absence of a profit test, size
is the one criterion of success for a service institution, and growth a
goal in itself. And then, of course, there is always so much more that
needs to be done. But stopping what has “always been done” and doing
something new are equally anathema to service institutions, or at least
excruciatingly painful to them. Most innovations in public-service
institutions are imposed on them either by outsiders or by catastrophe.
For example, the modern American university in the mid-nineteenth
century came into being when the country’s traditional colleges and
universities were dying and could no longer attract students.</p>

Service Institutions Need a Defined Mission</h4>
<p>We have attained what we were trying to do.</p>
<p>F irst, the public-service institution needs a clear definition of
its mission. What is it trying to do? Why does it exist? It needs to
focus on objectives rather than on programs and projects. Programs and
projects are means to an end. They should always be considered as
temporary and, in fact, short-lived. Second, the public-service
institution needs a realistic statement of goals. It should say, “Our
job is to assuage famine,” rather than, “Our job is to eliminate
hunger.” It needs something that is genuinely attainable and therefore a
commitment to a realistic goal, so that it can say eventually, “Our job
is finished.” Most objectives can and should be phrased in optimal
rather than in maximal terms. Then it is possible to say, “We have
attained what we were trying to do.” Third, failure to achieve
objectives should be considered an indication that the objective is
wrong or at least defined wrongly. If an objective has not been attained
after repeated tries, one has to assume that it is the wrong one.
Failure to attain objectives is a prima facie reason to question the
validity of the objective—the exact opposite of what most public-service
institutions believe.</p>

<h4 id="july-optimal-market-standing">23 July Optimal Market
Standing</h4>
<p>Market domination produces tremendous internal resistance against any
innovation.</p>
<p>A major decision underlying marketing objectives is market standing.
One common approach is to say, “We want to be the leader.” The other one
is to say, “We don’t care what share of the market we have as long as
sales go up.” Both sound plausible, but both are wrong. It does not do
much good for a company’s sales to go up if it loses market share, that
is, if the market expands much faster than the company’s sales do. A
company with a small share of the market will eventually become marginal
in the marketplace, and thereby exceedingly vulnerable. There is also a
maximum market standing above which it may be unwise to go—even if there
were no antitrust laws. Market domination tends to lull the leader to
sleep; monopolists flounder on their own complacency rather than on
public opposition. Market domination produces tremendous internal
resistance against any innovation and thus makes adaptation to change
dangerously difficult. There is also well-founded resistance in the
marketplace to dependence on one dominant supplier. No one likes to be
at the mercy of the monopoly supplier.</p>
<p>The market standing to aim at is not the maximum but the optimum.
This requires careful analysis of customers, of products or services, of
market segments, and of distribution channels. It requires a market
strategy, and it requires a decision of high risk.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Define your institution’s optimal market share by
carefully analyzing your customers, competitors, market segments, and
distribution channels. Base your market strategy on your optimal market
share, not on simply dominating the market or increasing market
share.</p>

<h4 id="july-worship-of-high-profit-margins">24 July Worship of High
Profit Margins</h4>
<p>High profit margin holds an umbrella over the competitor.</p>
<p>M ost businesspeople are aware that profit is not the same as profit
margin. Profit is profit margin multiplied by the turnover of capital.
Maximum profitability and maximum profit flow are thus obtained by the
profit margin that produces the optimum market standing and with it the
optimum turnover of capital.</p>
<p>Why is the worship of high profit margin likely to damage—if not
destroy—the business? It not only holds an umbrella over the competitor;
it also makes competing practically risk-free and virtually guarantees
that the competitor will take over the market. Xerox invented the
copier, and in all of business history very few products have been as
successful as the Xerox copy machine. But then Xerox began to chase
profit margin. It put more and more gimmicks on the machine, each
developed primarily to increase the profit margin. But each of these new
accessories also increased the price of the machine, and what was
probably even more important, each made it more difficult to service the
machine. And the great majority of users didn’t need these additional
features. And so a Japanese company, Canon, developed what was not much
more than a replica of the original Xerox machine. The Canon model was
simple and cheap, and easy to service, and it captured the U.S. market
in less than one year.</p>

Marketing</h4>
<p>Henry Ford is supposed to have said: “We can sell the Model T at such
a low price only because it earns such a nice profit.”</p>
<p>O f the top marketing lessons for the highly competitive twenty-first
century, the most crucial one is that buying customers doesn’t work. The
collapse of the Hyundai Excel was a spectacular marketing failure. There
was nothing wrong with the car. But the company had greatly underpriced
it. As a result, it had no profits to plow back into promotion, service,
dealers, or improvements to the car itself.</p>
<p>How to define the market is the second lesson—the lesson of what was
both a marketing success and a major marketing fiasco: the conquest of
the American market by the fax machine. The Japanese did not ask, “What
is the market for this machine?” Instead they asked, “What is the market
for what it does?” And they immediately saw, when looking at the growth
of courier services such as Federal Express, that the market for the fax
machine had already been established. The next lesson is that marketing
starts with all customers in the market rather than with our customers.
The final lesson is that of the success of the new “pastoral” churches
by exploiting demographic changes as a marketing opportunity.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Apply these four marketing lessons to your business:
Don’t try to buy customers. Ask, “What is the market for what the

<p>Consumerism is the “shame of marketing.”</p>
<p>D espite the emphasis on marketing and the marketing approach,
marketing is still rhetoric rather than reality in far too many
businesses. “Consumerism” proves this. For what consumerism demands of
business is that it actually market. It demands that business start out
with the needs, the realities, the values of the customer. It demands
that business define its goal as the satisfaction of customer needs. It
demands that business base its reward on its contribution to the
customer. That after years of marketing rhetoric consumerism could
become a powerful popular movement proves that not much marketing has
been practiced. Consumerism is the “shame of marketing.” Indeed, selling
and marketing are antithetical rather than synonymous or even
complementary.</p>
<p>There will always, one can assume, be a need for some selling. But
the aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous. The aim of
marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the
product or service fits her and sells itself. Ideally, marketing should
result in a customer who is ready to buy. We may be a long way from this
ideal. But consumerism is a clear indication that the right motto for
business management should increasingly be, “From selling to
marketing.”</p>

<h4 id="july-cost-driven-pricing">27 July Cost-Driven Pricing</h4>
<p>Customers do not see it as their job to ensure that manufacturers
make a profit.</p>
<p>M ost American and European companies set their prices by adding up
costs and then putting a profit margin on top. And then, as soon as they
have introduced the product or service, they have to start cutting the
price, have to redesign the product at enormous expense, have to take
losses—and, often, have to drop a perfectly good product or service
because it is priced incorrectly. Their argument? “We have to recover
our costs and make a profit.” But the only sound way to price is to
start out with what the market is willing to pay and design to that
price specification. To start out with price and then whittle down costs
is certainly more work initially. But in the end it is much less work
than to start out wrong and then spend loss-making years bringing costs
into line.</p>
<p>Price-led costing is an American invention and over one hundred years
old. It gave the General Electric company world leadership in electric
generating stations way back in the early years of the twentieth
century. That’s when GE began to design turbines and transformers to the
price the customers, the electric power companies, could pay. They were
designed from the price the customer could pay and was willing to pay;
and so the customer could and did buy them.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Investigate your pricing practices. Set prices
according to customer realities and then form a team to help achieve a
cost structure that will allow you to make the necessary profit at a
preset price.</p>

<h4 id="july-cost-control-in-a-stable-business">28 July Cost Control in
a Stable Business</h4>
<p>In cost control an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>
<p>A ll of us have learned that it is much harder to get rid of five
extra pounds than it is not to put them on in the first place. In no
other area is it as true as it is in cost control that an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure. An absolute necessity is to watch
like a hawk to make sure that costs do not go up as fast as revenues;
and, conversely, that they fall at least as fast as revenues if there is
a recession and revenues go down.</p>
<p>One example of a follower of this rule is one of the world’s largest
pharmaceutical companies, a company that grew almost eightfold, adjusted
for inflation, between 1965 and 1995. During those thirty years, it held
cost increases to a fixed percentage of its increase in revenues; a
maximum 6 percent rise in costs for every 10 percent rise in revenues.
After five or six years of trying, it also learned how to make sure that
costs go down in the same proportion as revenues go down in a down
period. It took quite a few years to make this work; now it’s almost
second nature in that company.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Hold increases in operating costs to a fixed percentage
of increases in operating revenues. Make sure operating costs go down by
the percentage decrease in operating revenues.</p>

<p>How much business can we expect in this new company if we are

<p>T o grow a business one has to put in front-end money. That money is
invested in tomorrow’s profit makers, so those front-end investments
will only be costs and no returns, and sometimes for a long time. How
does one manage those to maintain cost control? The first thing is to
budget these activities separately. I call it the opportunities budget.
The second rule, therefore, is to think through what results we expect
from these investments in the future and within what time period.</p>
<p>The best example I know is how Citibank became the world’s only
successful transnational bank in the heady 1970s and 1980s. The reason
was that Citi first thought through how much front-end investment in a
new branch could be justified. It thought through what the minimum
results in the new territory could and should be. Citibank asked: “How
much business can we expect in this new country if we are successful and
become a market leader? And how much front-end investment is then
justified assuming that the front-end investment must not exceed a
certain percentage of the potential results?” And then Citi knew from
its own experience how long it should take before this new branch should
reach break-even, that is, before it should begin to produce
profits.</p>

<p>Would the roof cave in if we stopped doing this work altogether?</p>
<p>N o matter how well a business prevents cost inflation, it will still
have to cut costs. This is because businesses are like people, and
people often get sick no matter how carefully they exercise, control
their diet, and avoid substance abuse. There is thus always the need for
cost cutting. To start cost cutting, management usually asks: “How can
we make this operation more efficient?” It is the wrong question. The
question should be: “Would the roof cave in if we stopped doing this
work altogether?” And if the answer is “probably not,” one eliminates
the operation. It is always amazing how many of the things we do will
never be missed. But businesses that actually succeed in cutting costs
don’t wait until they have to cut costs. They build cost-cutting into
normal operations. They build into their routine operations organized
abandonment. Otherwise, eliminating activities and operations runs into
extreme political resistance.</p>

<p>Cost control is not a matter of cost cutting but of cost
prevention.</p>
<p>W hat matters is not really the method. It is the realization that
the cost-effectiveness of an activity depends on the way it is being
structured. It depends heavily on accepting the premise that cost
control is not a matter of cost cutting but of cost prevention. And
costs never drift down, so cost prevention is a never-ending task. No
matter how well structured the organization, its cost-effectiveness
needs to be looked at again and again. No matter how carefully it
controls its costs, its activities and processes need to be put on trial
for their lives every few years.</p>
<p>This process also ensures that the entire workforce embraces and
accepts cost control. It should actually see it as an opportunity and
not a threat. If cost control is seen as cost cutting, the workforce
will see it as a job threat and will refuse to support it. But if cost
control is seen and practiced as cost prevention, then the workforce
will actually see it as an opportunity, or at the very least it will
support the cost control for the sake of better and more secure
jobs.</p>

<h4 id="august-diversification">1 August Diversification</h4>
<p>“Shoemaker, stick to your last!”</p>
<p>T he old cliché is still sound advice. The less diverse a business,
the more manageable it is. Simplicity makes for clarity. People can
understand their own job and see its relationship to results and to the
performance of the whole. Efforts will tend to be concentrated.
Expectations can be defined, and results can easily be appraised and
measured. The less complex a business is, the fewer things can go wrong.
And the more complex a business is, the more difficult it is to figure
out what went wrong and to take the right remedial action. Complexity
creates problems of communications. The more complex a business, the
more layers of management, the more forms and procedures, the more
meetings, and the more delays in making decisions.</p>
<p>There are only two ways in which diversity can be harmonized into
unity. A business can be highly diversified and yet have fundamental
unity if its businesses and technologies, its products and product
lines, and its activities are embraced within the unity of a common
market. And a business can be highly diversified and have fundamental
unity if its businesses, its markets, its products and product lines,
and its activities are held together in a common technology.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Examine your business. Is it focused or diffused? If
diffused, develop a plan to bring unity out of the diversity using
market or technology as the basis for unity.</p>

<h4 id="august-being-the-wrong-size">2 August Being the Wrong Size</h4>
<p>A business that is the wrong size is a business that does not have
the right niche to survive and prosper.</p>
<p>B eing the wrong size is a chronic, debilitating, wasting—and a very
common—disease. Being the wrong size is curable in the majority of
cases. But the cure is neither easy nor pleasant. The symptoms are clear
and are always the same. In a business that is the wrong size, there is
always one area, activity, function, or effort—or at most a very
few—that is out of all proportion and hypertrophied. This area has to be
so big, requires so much effort, and imposes so much cost on the
business as to make economic performance and results impossible. The old
American Motors furnishes the example. American Motors announced
successive plans to aggressively recruit new and strong dealers and push
up its sales. In order to obtain the sales volume that would have given
the business a viable size, the expenses that made the business
nonviable had to be increased. And this is precisely what the business
could not afford.</p>
<p>The most rewarding strategy to come to grips with the problem is to
attempt to change the character of the business. A business that is the
wrong size is a business that does not have the right niche to survive
and prosper. A comparison between American Motors and Volkswagen shows
the difference between being the wrong size as a result of lack of
distinction, and being the right size by occupying a distinct niche.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Analyze your business. Are you too small to compete in
the business? If so, develop a profitable niche within which you can
compete effectively.</p>

<h4 id="august-growth">3 August Growth</h4>
<p>Growth that results only in volume and does not produce higher
overall productivities is fat—it should be sweated.</p>
<p>M anagement needs to think through the minimum of growth that its
company requires. What is the minimum of growth without which the
company would actually lose strength, vigor, and ability to perform, if
not to survive? A company needs a viable market standing. Otherwise it
soon becomes marginal. It soon becomes, in effect, the wrong size. And
if the market expands, whether domestically or worldwide, a company has
to grow with the market to maintain its viability. At times a company
therefore needs a very high minimum growth rate.</p>
<p>A business needs to distinguish between the wrong kind of growth and
the right kind of growth, between muscle, fat, and cancer. The rules are
simple: Any growth that, within a short period of time, results in an
overall increase in the total productivities of the enterprise’s
resources is healthy growth. It should be fed and supported. But growth
that results only in volume and does not, within a fairly short period
of time, produce higher overall productivities is fat. Any increase in
volume that does not lead to higher overall productivity should be
sweated off again. Finally, any increase in volume that leads to reduced
productivities should be eliminated by radical surgery—fast.</p>

<p>Every new project is an infant and infants belong in the nursery.</p>
<p>I nnovative efforts, especially those aimed at developing new

line managers charged with responsibility for ongoing operations.
Unfortunately, this is a common error.</p>
<p>The new project is an infant and will remain one for the foreseeable
future, and infants belong in the nursery. The “adults,” that is, the
executives in charge of existing businesses or products, will have
neither time nor understanding for the infant project. The best-known
practitioners of this approach are three American companies: Procter
andandandand Gamble, the soap, detergent, edible oil, and food producer;
Johnson andandandand Johnson, the hygiene and health-care supplier; and
3M, a major manufacturer of industrial and consumer products. These
three companies differ in the details of practice, but essentially all
three have the same policy. They set up the new venture as a separate
business from the beginning and put a project manager in charge.</p>

<p>Your being the one who makes your product, process, or service
obsolete is the only way to prevent your competitor from doing so. One
major American company that has long understood and accepted this is
DuPont. When nylon came out in 1938, DuPont immediately put chemists to
work to invent new synthetic fibers to compete with nylon. It also began
to cut nylon’s price—thus making it less attractive for would-be
competitors to find a way around DuPont’s patents. This explains why
DuPont is still the world’s leading synthetic-fiber maker, and why
DuPont’s nylon is still in the market, and profitably so.</p>

<p>Often a prescription drug designed for a specific ailment sometimes

<p>W hen a new venture does succeed, more often than not it is in a
market other than the one it was originally intended to serve, with
products or services not quite those with which it had set out, bought
in large part by customers it did not even think of when it started, and
used for a host of purposes besides the ones for which the products were
first designed. If a new venture does not anticipate this, organizing
itself to take advantage of the unexpected and unseen markets; if it is
not totally market-focused, if not market-driven, then it will succeed
only in creating an opportunity for a competitor.</p>
<p>The new venture therefore needs to start out with the assumption that
its product or service may find customers in markets no one thought of,
for uses no one envisaged when the product or service was designed, and
that it will be bought by customers outside its field of vision and even
unknown to the new venture. If the new venture does not have such a
market focus from the very beginning, all it is likely to create is the
market for a competitor.</p>

<h4 id="august-social-innovation-the-research-lab">7 August Social
Innovation: The Research Lab</h4>
<p>Management is increasingly becoming the agent of social
innovation.</p>
<p>T he research lab dates back to 1905. It was conceived and built for
the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, by one of the
earliest “research managers,” the German-American physicist Charles
Proteus Steinmetz. Steinmetz had two clear objectives from the start: to
organize science and scientific work for purposeful technological
invention and to build continuous self-renewal through innovation into
that new social phenomenon—the big corporation.</p>
<p>Steinmetz’s lab radically redefined the relationship between science
and technology in research. In setting the goals of his project,
Steinmetz identified the new theoretical science needed to accomplish
the desired technological results and then organized the appropriate
“pure” research to obtain the needed new knowledge. Steinmetz himself
was originally a theoretical physicist. But every one of his
“contributions” was the result of research he had planned and specified
as part of a project to design and to develop a new product line, for
example, fractional horsepower motors. Technology, traditional wisdom
held and still widely holds, is “applied science.” In Steinmetz’s lab,
science—including the purest of “pure research”—is technology-driven,
that is, a means to a technological end.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Follow the example of Steinmetz and do market-driven
research and development.</p>

<h4 id="august-social-innovation-the-lab-without-walls">8 August Social

<p>Steinmetz’s technology-driven science is anathema to many academic
scientists.</p>
<p>S teinmetz’s innovation also led to the “lab without walls,” which is
America’s specific, and major, contribution to very large scientific and
technological programs. The first of these, conceived and managed by
President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s former law partner, Basil O’Connor,
was the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (March of Dimes),
which tackled polio in the early 1930s. This project continued for more
than twenty-five years and brought together in a planned, step-by-step
effort a large number of scientists from half a dozen disciplines, in a
dozen different locations across the country, each working on his own
project but within a central strategy and under overall direction.</p>
<p>This then established the pattern for the great World War II
projects: the RADAR lab, the Lincoln Laboratory, and, most massive of
them all, the Manhattan Project for atomic energy. Similarly, NASA
organized a “research lab without walls” when this country decided,
after Sputnik, to put a man on the moon. Steinmetz’s technology-driven
science is still highly controversial. Still, it is the organization we
immediately reach for whenever a new scientific problem emerges, for
example, when AIDS suddenly became a major medical problem in
1984–85.</p>

<p>W hat accounts for the decline in the number of major corporate
research labs? The company-owned research laboratory was one of the
nineteenth century’s most successful inventions. Now many research
directors, as well as high-tech industrialists, tend to believe that
such labs are becoming obsolete. Why? Technologies crisscross industries
and travel incredibly fast, making few of them unique anymore. And
increasingly, the knowledge needed in a given industry comes out of some
totally different technology with which, very often, the people in the
industry are quite unfamiliar. As a result the big research labs of the
past are becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>The research laboratory of the big telephone companies, the famous
Bell Laboratories of the U.S., was for many decades the source of all
major innovations in the telephone industry. But no one in that industry
worked on fiberglass cables or had ever heard of them. They were

<p>Businesses are not paid to reform customers.</p>
<p>A bove all, the people who are running a new venture need to spend
time outside: in the marketplace, with customers, and with their own
sales force, looking and listening. The new venture needs to build in
systematic practices to remind itself that a “product” or a “service” is
defined by the customer, not by the producer. It needs to work
continuously on challenging itself in respect to the utility and value
that its products or services contribute to customers. The greatest
danger for the new venture is to “know better” than the customer what
the product or service is or should be, how it should be bought, and
what it should be used for. Above all, the new venture needs willingness
to see the unexpected success as an opportunity rather than as an
affront to its expertise. And it needs to accept that elementary axiom
of marketing: Businesses are not paid to reform customers. They are paid
to satisfy customers. Lack of market focus is typically a disease of the
“neonatal,” the infant new venture. It is the most serious affliction of
the new venture in its early stages—and one that can permanently stunt
even those that survive.</p>

<h4 id="august-the-rapidly-growing-new-venture">11 August The Rapidly
Growing New Venture</h4>
<p>The more successful a new venture is, the more dangerous the lack of
financial foresight.</p>
<p>T he lack of adequate financial focus and the right financial
policies is the greatest threat to the new venture in the next stage of
its growth. It is, above all, a threat to the rapidly growing new
venture. Suppose that a new venture has successfully launched its
product or service and is growing fast. It reports “rapidly increasing
profits” and issues rosy forecasts. The stock market then “discovers”
the new venture, especially if it is high-tech or in a field otherwise
currently fashionable. Predictions abound that the new venture’s sales
will reach a billion dollars within five years.</p>
<p>Eighteen months later, the new venture collapses. It is suddenly
awash in red ink, lays off 180 of its 275 employees, fires the
president, or is sold at a bargain price to a big company. The causes
are always the same: lack of cash; inability to raise the capital needed
for expansion; and loss of control, with expenses, inventories, and
receivables in disarray. These three financial afflictions often hit
together at the same time. Yet any one of them by itself endangers the
health, if not the life, of the new venture. Once this financial crisis
has erupted, it can be cured only with great difficulty and considerable
suffering.</p>

venture. Don’t look at your accounting and finance people as “bean

<h4 id="august-managing-cash-in-the-new-venture">12 August Managing Cash
in the New Venture</h4>
<p>There is an old banker’s rule of thumb according to which one assumes
that bills will have to be paid sixty days earlier than expected and
receivables will come in sixty days later.</p>
<p>E ntrepreneurs starting new ventures are rarely unmindful of money;
on the contrary, they tend to be greedy. They therefore focus on
profits. But this is the wrong focus for a new venture, or rather, it
comes last rather than first. Cash flow, capital, and controls come much
earlier. Without them, the profit figures are fiction—good for twelve to
eighteen months, perhaps, after which they evaporate. Growth has to be
fed. In financial terms this means that growth in a new venture demands
adding financial resources rather than taking them out. The healthier a
new venture and the faster it grows, the more financial feeding it
requires.</p>
<p>The new venture needs cash-flow analysis, cash-flow forecasts, and
cash management. The fact that America’s new ventures of the last few
years (with the significant exception of high-tech companies) have been
doing so much better than new ventures used to do is largely because the
new entrepreneurs in the United States have learned that
entrepreneurship demands financial management. Cash management is fairly
easy if there are reliable cash-flow forecasts, with “reliable” meaning
“worst case” assumptions rather than hopes. If the forecast is overly
conservative, the worst that can happen is a temporary cash surplus.</p>

forecasts for new ventures. Monitor receivables and inventory levels

that the business may double within three or five years, then it is the
duty of the founder or founders to build the management team the new
venture will soon require. First of all the founders, together with
other key people in the firm, will have to think through the key
activities of their business. What are the specific areas upon which the
survival and success of this particular business depend? Every activity
that any member of the group thinks belongs there should go down on the
list.</p>
<p>The next step is, then, for each member of the group, beginning with
the founder, to ask: “What are the activities that I am doing well? And
what are the activities that each of my key associates in this business
is actually doing well?” Next one asks: “Which of the key activities
should each of us, therefore, take on as his or her first and major
responsibility because they fit the individual’s strengths? Which
individual fits which key activity?” Then the work on building a team
can begin. But all key activities need to be covered by someone who has
proven ability in performance.</p>

the challenges and opportunities of the present, it will still be far
below its optimum performance. Its potential is always greater than its
realized actuality.</p>
<p>Dangers and weaknesses indicate where to look for business potential.
To convert them from problems into opportunities brings extraordinary
returns. Opportunities have to be reflected against the experience of a
company and against its past successes and failures. Sometimes all that
is needed to accomplish this transformation is a change in the attitude
of the executives. Three questions will bring out the hidden potential
of a business:</p>
<p>What are the restraints and limitations that make the business
vulnerable?</p>
<p>What are the imbalances of the business?</p>
<p>What are we afraid of, what do we see as a threat to this
business—and how can we use it as an opportunity?</p>

inherent weaknesses, requires great effort.</p>
<p>Searching for the potential of opportunity in a company’s
vulnerabilities, limitations, and weaknesses is therefore likely to be
resented by its most accomplished people as a direct attack on their
position, pride, and power. This is the reason why the opportunities are

mortality rate of healthy new products or services. And like yesterday’s
infant mortality rate, the mortality rate of new products and services
is totally unnecessary. It can be reduced fairly fast and without
spending a great deal of money. Much of it is simply the result of
ignorance of the entrepreneurial strategies. The right entrepreneurial
strategy has a very high chance of success.</p>
<p>There are four specifically entrepreneurial strategies aiming at
market leadership: being “Fustest with the Mostest”; “Hitting Them Where
They Ain’t”; finding and occupying a specialized “ecological niche”; and
changing the economic characteristics of a product, a market, or an
industry. These four strategies are not mutually exclusive. One and the
same entrepreneur often combines two, sometimes even elements of three,
in one strategy. Still, each of these four has its prerequisites. Each
fits certain kinds of innovation and does not fit others. Each requires
specific behavior on the part of the entrepreneur. Finally, each has its
own limitations and carries its own risks.</p>

<h4 id="august-first-with-the-most">17 August First with the Most</h4>
<p>“Being Fustest with the Mostest.”</p>
<p>“F irst with the most” was the expression used by a Confederate
general to describe his cavalry unit’s consistent victories in the Civil
War. In business, it describes the strategy in which an innovator looks
to attain leadership, if not outright dominance. This is the
entrepreneurial strategy with the potentially highest rewards; but it’s
also the most risky one. There can be no mistakes or second chances. The
outcome is either market and industry leadership or nothing at all.
Entrepreneurs must be right the first time; otherwise, they fail. For
every innovator that succeeds with this strategy, dozens fail. Yet if
the “first with the most” strategy succeeds, the innovator reaps
tremendous rewards. It’s the strategy that underlies the success and
market leadership of such giants as 3M, Procter andandandand Gamble,
Intel, and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Yet there is a special risk to this strategy: to achieve initial
success, then to be outflanked by someone practicing the next
entrepreneurial strategy, “hitting them where they aren’t.” For example,
the two young engineers who started the Apple computer company in the
proverbial garage, without financial backers or previous business
experience, aimed from the beginning at creating an industry and
dominating it. But they were soon outflanked by IBM.</p>

Where They Aren’t</h4>
<p>“Hitting them where they aren’t” outflanks the leader by creative
imitation.</p>
<p>H ere, the innovator doesn’t create a major new product or service.
Instead, it takes something just created by somebody else and improves
upon it. This is imitation. But it is creative imitation because the
innovator reworks the new product or service to better satisfy
customers’ wants and needs. Once the innovator succeeds in creating what
customers want, it can achieve leadership and take control of the
market.</p>
<p>The perfect example is how IBM became the leading producer of PCs in
the 1970s. Apple invented the PC. When the Apple appeared, it was an
instant sensation. IBM set to work to outflank the Apple. It asked,
“What are Apple’s shortcomings?” Within eighteen months IBM had on the
market a PC that did everything the PC customers needed and wanted but
had what the Apple lacked: software. And within another year IBM’s PC
had become the market leader worldwide; it held that position for more
than ten years. And Apple had become marginal. It almost went under and
only turned itself around into a respectable niche player twenty-odd
years later, in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>T he Japanese judo master looks for the strength that is his
opponent’s pride and joy. He assumes, and does so with high probability,
that the opponent bases his strategy on this strength in every fight.
And then the judo master figures out where this continuing reliance on a
particular strength leaves the opponent vulnerable and undefended. Then
he turns his opponent’s strength into the opponent’s fatal weakness that
defeats the opponent.</p>
<p>Businesses, like judo fighters, tend to become set in their
behaviors. And then Entrepreneurial Judo turns what the market leaders
consider their strengths into the very weaknesses that defeat them. For
example, the Japanese became the leaders in one American market after
the other: first in copiers, then in machine tools, then in consumer
electronics, then in automobiles, and then in fax machines. The strategy
was always the same. They turned what the Americans considered their
strength into a weakness that defeated the American companies. The
Americans saw high profitability as their greatest strength. And thus
they focused on the high end of the market and left the mass market
undersupplied and underserviced. The Japanese moved in with low-cost
products with minimum features. The Americans didn’t even try to fight
them. But when the Japanese had taken over the mass market they had the
cash flow to move in on the high-end market, too. And they soon came to
dominate both the mass market and the high-end market.</p>

Economic Characteristics</h4>
<p>Successful innovators price according to what the customer pays
for.</p>
<p>U nder the other entrepreneurial strategies, the innovator has to
come up with an innovative product or service; here the strategy itself
is the innovation. The innovative strategy converts an existing product
or service into something new by changing its utility, its value, and
its economic characteristics. There is new economic value and new
customers, but no new product or service. Often the most successful way
to change the economic characteristics of a product or service is to
change its pricing. In the end the producer gets at least the same
amount of money, if not a good deal more. But the way pricing is
structured reflects the customer’s reality rather than the reality of
the producer.</p>
<p>Here is an example. The Internet was designed as an information
network. And most providers charged for access to it, such as for
hosting an e-mail address. But Yahoo and other companies give away
Internet access. It gets paid for by advertisers whose ads the customers
have to see when they go online. Yahoo asked: “Who is the customer?” Its
answer: “It’s a supplier who wants access to a potential customer.” This
changed the characteristics of the industry. It gave the Internet a new
dimension.</p>

Niche: Tollbooth Strategy</h4>
<p>If the innovator succeeds, it will have a nearly impenetrable
position.</p>
<p>T he fourth major entrepreneurial strategy, occupying an ecological
niche, allows an innovator to establish a virtual monopoly in a small
niche market. The first niche strategy is the tollbooth strategy. Under
the tollbooth strategy, the innovator creates a product or service that
is an indispensable part of a larger process. Then the cost of using the
product becomes eventually irrelevant. Here the market must be so
limited that whoever occupies the niche first is able to effectively bar
anyone else from entering it.</p>
<p>Here is an example: Alcon, a company started in the late 1950s by a
salesman for a major pharmaceutical company. He had known all along that
there was a major incongruity in the operation for senile cataracts in
the eyes. There was one dangerous procedure in the surgery where the
surgeon had to sever a piece of muscle tissue with a slight risk of
bleeding that would destroy the eye. The innovator read up on what was
known about this muscle and found almost immediately that an enzyme
dissolved it without bleeding or cutting. But there had been no way to
prevent this enzyme from disintegrating and to give it shelf life. Then
the innovator found that since 1890 a number of substances had been
developed to give enzymes stability and shelf life. He patented the
application of one of these substances to the enzyme, and within
eighteen months he had the world market for the stuff.</p>

strategy, but it tends to be somewhat larger. For example, everyone can
name the major U.S. automobile manufacturers. But how many people know
the companies that make the brake pads or electrical circuits or
headlamps that go into these cars? Those largely unknown companies
occupy a specialty-skill position in an ecological niche. Developing
high skill at a very early time in a new industry or market captures
this position. Once the market begins to grow, the innovator has a
significant head start over potential competitors and has already become
the standard industry supplier.</p>
<p>The best example is that of America’s leading twentieth-century
inventor, Charles Kettering. Kettering aimed in all his inventions at
creating a vastly profitable niche business. And his first, and probably
the world’s most profitable invention, was aimed at creating a
specialty-skill niche market. It was the self-starter. Until then,
automobiles had to be started by cranking by hand, which was very hard
and also quite dangerous. But for fifteen years or so, during the period
of the most rapid growth in the automobile industry, every carmaker had
to buy Kettering’s self-starter. It added very little to the cost of the
car, maybe 1 or 2 percent. But Kettering’s profit margins were known to
be around 500 percent or more.</p>

Niche: Specialty Market</h4>
<p>With the specialty-market strategy the innovator must create a small
but profitable new market.</p>
<p>T he final niche strategy is to establish a specialty-market niche
big enough to be profitable but small enough not to make it worthwhile
for potential competitors to invade it. For example, the most profitable
financial product for twenty or more years, from 1919 until World War II
and even a decade beyond, was the American Express Travelers Cheque—a
specialty-market niche. The Travelers Cheque was much safer than
carrying a lot of cash and usable everywhere—they were accepted, for
instance, by every European hotel. Banks sold the Cheques and got a
small fee for each transaction. This not only kept American Express from
needing to market the Cheques, but it also discouraged the banks from
launching a competing service. And American Express made oodles of money
because Cheque owners would hold the Cheques for months, or even years,
before cashing them, during which time American Express had the “float,”
that is, the interest-free use of the money the Cheque holders had paid.
Everyone in the financial industry knew how profitable the Travelers
Cheques were. But the market then was so small that there was no point
in any major bank trying to muscle its way into it.</p>

<h4 id="august-threats-to-niche-strategies">24 August Threats to Niche
Strategies</h4>
<p>While it lasts, the niche strategy is the most profitable
entrepreneurial strategy.</p>
<p>W hat all niche strategies have in common is that they are unlikely
to endure forever. One threat is for the niche to be outflanked, and
especially by technological change. That happened to Alcon. Fifteen
years after it became a worldwide near-monopoly, somebody in
Czechoslovakia invented a new cataract operation, the implant lens, in
which eye muscle has to be maintained rather than dissolved. And Alcon’s
solvent became history.</p>
<p>Another threat is if a niche becomes the main mass market. That’s
what happened to the Travelers Cheque. Before World War II, a European
trip for Americans was still the rare exception. Now the transatlantic
jets carry more passengers in two days between Europe and the U.S. than
all the steamships carried in an entire year before World War II. And
the new mass traveler uses a credit card. And when the automobile market
became a mass market, in the U.S. during World War I and in Europe and
Japan after World War II, the intense pressure to cut costs meant that
to be the niche supplier depending on a specialty skill ceased to yield
niche profits. These players were the ones, and still are, on which the
automobile companies put the greatest pressure to cut prices. And they
had no choice but to yield.</p>

Three Case Studies on Innovation Strategy</h4>
<p>Three pharmaceutical companies—Able, Baker, and Charlie —are among
the most successful pharmaceutical businesses in the world. Able and
Baker are very large. Charlie</p>
<p>Able Company: Research Strategy is medium-sized, but growing fast.
All three companies spend about the same percentage of their revenues on
research. There the similarity ends. Each of them approaches research
quite differently.</p>
<p>Able’s aim is to gain early leadership in a major area, acquire
dominance in it, and then maintain this leadership position.</p>
<p>A ble Company—spends a great deal of research money on one carefully
selected area at a time. It picks this area when pure research in the
universities first indicates a genuine breakthrough. Then, long before
commercial products are available, it hires the very best people in the
field, and puts them to work. Outside of these areas, however, the
company spends no research money and is perfectly willing not to be a
factor at all. The company takes big positions in big fields at a very
early stage, at great risk, but also at great reward.</p>

<h4 id="august-baker-company-research-strategy">26 August Baker Company:
Research Strategy</h4>
<p>Baker’s aim is to come up with a small number of drugs in each field
that are clearly superior and offer significant advances to medical
practice.</p>
<p>T he strategy of Baker Company is completely different. Its research
lab, perhaps the most famous in the pharmaceutical industry, works in an
enormous number of fields. It does not, however, enter a field until the
basic scientific theoretical work has been done. Then it goes to work.
Of every ten products that come out of its own laboratory, the company
itself markets no more than two or three. When it becomes reasonably
clear that an effective drug will result from a line of research, the
company carefully scrutinizes the product and, indeed, the entire field.
First, is the new product likely to be medically so superior as to
become the new “standard”? Second, is it likely to have major impact
throughout the field of health care and medical practice rather than be
confined to one specialty area, even a large one? And finally, is it
likely to remain the “standard” for a good many years, rather than to be
overtaken by competitive products?</p>
<p>If the answer to any of these three questions is “No,” the company
will license or sell the development, rather than convert it into a
product of its own. This has been highly profitable in two ways. It has
generated licensing income almost equal to the profits the company makes
on the drugs it makes and sells under its own name. And it has assured
that each of the company’s products is considered the “leader” by the
medical profession.</p>

Company: Research Strategy</h4>
<p>Charlie Company does no research. It looks for areas where a fairly

<p>C harlie Company does no research. All it does is develop. It will
not tackle any of the products Able or Baker companies consider
attractive. It looks for areas in medical and surgical practice where
existing products are not doing a good job, and where a fairly simple
change can greatly improve the doctor’s or surgeon’s performance. And it
looks for fields that are so small that once there is a truly superior
product, there is no incentive for anyone else to go in and compete.</p>
<p>Its first product was a simple enzyme—actually known for forty
years—to make cataract operations virtually bloodless and greatly ease
the eye surgeon’s job. All the work that had to be done was to find a
way to extend the shelf life of the enzyme. The next product was a very
simple ointment to put on the umbilical cord of infants to prevent
infection and speed up healing. It has become standard in every
maternity hospital throughout the world. The company later brought out a
product to replace the toxic solution with which newborn babies used to
be washed to prevent infection—again, primarily a matter of compounding
rather than discovering. In each area, the world market is so
limited—maybe to 0 million—that a single supplier, provided it offers a
truly superior product, can occupy a near-monopoly position with a
minimum of competition and practically no pressure on price.</p>

<p>S uccess always obsoletes the very behavior that achieved it. It
always creates new realities. It always creates, above all, its own and
different problems. It is not easy for the management of a successful
company to ask, “What is our business?” Everybody in the company thinks
that the answer is so obvious as not to deserve discussion. It is never
popular to argue with success, never popular to rock the boat. But the
management that does not ask “What is our business?” when the company is
successful is, in effect, smug, lazy, and arrogant. It will not be long
before success will turn into failure.</p>
<p>The two most successful American industries of the 1920s were
anthracite coal mines and railroads. Both believed that God had given
them an unshakable monopoly forever. Both believed that the definition
of their business was so obvious as to eliminate all need for thought,
let alone for action. Neither need have tumbled from its leadership
position—the anthracite industry into total oblivion—had their
managements not taken success for granted. Above all: when a management
attains the company’s objectives, it should always ask seriously, “What
is our business?” This requires self-discipline and responsibility. The
alternative is decline.</p>

<p>Performing organizations enjoy what they’re doing.</p>
<p>O rganizations have a gravity, the weight is constantly being pushed
into being problem-focused, and one has to fight it all the time. Not
very many organizations are good at what I call “exploitation of
success.” Look at what is today the world’s largest consumer-electronics
entertainment company: Sony. Basically, all Sony has ever done is run
with the tape recorder and build on its success. But if you build that
into the organization and demand it from everybody, then you create a
receptivity for being opportunity-focused rather than problem-focused.
And above all, you create enjoyment. I know this is not the academically
respectable thing to say, but performing organizations enjoy what
they’re doing. I’m always asked how I know what kind of an organization
to accept as a client. When you walk through the door, you know in two
minutes whether they enjoy it. And if they don’t enjoy it, then I’d
rather not work for them. But if they like it and they feel that
tomorrow is going to be better—that creates a totally different
climate.</p>

<p>One survives problems by making them irrelevant because of
success.</p>
<p>E very surprise is something to be taken seriously. The entire
reporting system kind of encourages the neglect of opportunities and
surprises, but also it’s fairly easy to change. Fifty years ago, a
friend and mentor of mine invented a system used in a big company that’s
become very successful as a result. Every manager, down to the
first-line supervisor, sits down every month and writes a letter with
one subject: the unexpected. Not what went right or what went wrong, but
the unexpected. And then they have a meeting and look at these things
with the question: Does this tell us something? Now, the great majority
don’t, the great majority are just anecdotes, but there are usually
three or four that are relevant. And out of this, the company—a
pharmaceutical company—has grown from a fairly unimportant commodity
producer to one of the world’s leaders. And it’s come out of surprises,
clinical surprises, like when a physician uses a medication for what it
was not developed for and has amazing results. You have to focus on
success, especially unexpected success, and run with it.</p>

<h4 id="september-know-thy-time">1 September Know Thy Time</h4>
<p>Effective executives start with their time.</p>
<p>“K now thyself,” the old prescription for wisdom, is almost
impossibly difficult for mortal men. But everyone can follow the
injunction “Know thy time” if one wants to, and be well on the road
toward contribution and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Most discussions of the executive’s task start with the advice to
plan one’s work. This sounds eminently plausible. The only thing wrong
with it is that it rarely works. The plans always remain on paper,
always remain good intentions. They seldom turn into achievement.
Effective executives, in my observation, do not start with their tasks.
They start with their time. And they do not start out with planning.
They start by finding out where their time actually goes. Then they
attempt to manage their time and to cut back unproductive demands on
their time. Finally they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the
largest possible continuing units. This three-step process</p>
<p>recording time</p>
<p>managing time</p>

<p>is the foundation of executive effectiveness.</p>

Record Time and Eliminate Time Wasters</h4>
<p>All one has to do is to learn to say “no” if an activity contributes
nothing.</p>
<p>T he first step toward executive effectiveness is to record actual
time-use. There are executives who keep such a time log themselves.
Others have their secretaries do it for them. The important thing is
that it gets done, and that the record is made in “real” time. A good
many effective executives keep such a log continuously and look at it
regularly every month. After each such sample, they rethink and rework
their schedule. First one tries to identify and eliminate the things
that need not be done at all, the things that are purely a waste of time
without any results whatever. To find these time wasters, one asks of
all activities in the time records: “What would happen if this were not
done at all?” And if the answer is, “Nothing would happen,” then
obviously the conclusion is to stop doing it.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Create a time log of your activities. Eliminate those
activities that are time wasters.</p>
<p>The Effective Executive</p>
<h4 id="september-consolidate-time">3 September Consolidate Time</h4>
<p>Effective executives know that one rarely overprunes.</p>
<p>T he final step in time management is to consolidate the time that
record and analysis show as normally available and under the executive’s
control. To be effective every executive needs to be able to dispose of
time in fairly large chunks. This is particularly true with respect to
time spent working with people, which is, of course, a central task in
the work of the executive. The manager who thinks that she can discuss
the plans, direction, and performance of one of her subordinates in
fifteen minutes is just deceiving herself.</p>
<p>There are a good many ways to consolidate time. Some people work at
home one or more days a week. Other executives schedule all the
operating work—the meetings, reviews, problem-sessions, and so on—for
two days a week and set aside the mornings of the remaining days for
consistent, continuing work on major issues. But the method by which one
consolidates one’s discretionary time is far less important than the
approach. Effective executives start out by estimating how much
discretionary time they can realistically call their own. And if they
find later that other matters encroach on this reserve, they scrutinize
their record again and get rid of some more time demands from
less-than-fully-productive activities.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Consolidate your time and set aside large blocks of
time to complete major tasks.</p>

<h4 id="september-practices-of-effective-executives">4 September
Practices of Effective Executives</h4>
<p>All that effective executives have in common is the ability to get
the right things done.</p>
<p>T he effective executives I have seen differ widely in their
temperaments and abilities, in what they do and how they do it, in their
personalities, their knowledge, their interests—in fact, in almost
everything that distinguishes human beings. But all effective executives
I’ve known perform only necessary tasks and eliminate unnecessary
ones.</p>
<p>Five practices have to be acquired to be effective. Effective
executives know where their time goes. They work systematically at
managing the little of their time that can be brought under their
control. Effective executives focus on outward contributions. Effective
executives build on strengths —theirs and others. They do not build on
weaknesses. Effective executives concentrate on superior performance
where superior performance will produce outstanding results. They force
themselves to stay within priorities. Effective executives make
effective decisions. They know that this is a system—the right steps in
the right sequence. They know that to make decisions fast is to make the
wrong decisions. Whenever I have found a person who—no matter how great
in intelligence, industry, imagination, or knowledge—fails to observe
these practices, I have also found an executive deficient in
effectiveness.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Commit these five tasks to memory and practice them:
know where your time goes; focus on outward contributions; build on
strengths; concentrate on superior performance; and make effective
decisions.</p>
<p>The Effective Executive</p>
<h4 id="september-focus-on-contribution">5 September Focus on
Contribution</h4>
<p>The question “What should I contribute?” gives freedom because it
gives responsibility.</p>
<p>T he great majority of executives tend to focus downward. They are
occupied with efforts rather than with results. They worry over what the
organization and their superiors “owe” them and should do for them. And
they are conscious above all of the authority they “should have.” As a
result, they render themselves ineffectual. The effective executive
focuses on contribution. He looks up from his work and outward toward
goals. He asks: “What can I contribute that will significantly affect
the performance and the results of the institution I serve?” His stress
is on responsibility.</p>
<p>The focus on contribution is the key to effectiveness: in a person’s
own work—its content, its level, its standards, and its impacts; in his
relations with others—his superiors, his associates, his subordinates;
in his use of the tools of the executive such as meetings or reports.
The focus on contribution turns the executive’s attention away from his
own specialty, his own narrow skills, his own department, and toward the
performance of the whole. It turns his attention to the outside, the
only place where there are results.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Maintain a constant focus on the contribution you can
and should make to your organization.</p>

<p>Management Challenges for the 21st Century</p>
<h4 id="september-performance-appraisals">6 September Performance
Appraisals</h4>
<p>Appraisals—and the philosophy behind them—are far too much concerned
with “potential.”</p>
<p>E ffective executives usually work out their own unique form of
performance appraisal. It starts out with a statement of the major
contributions expected from a person in his past and present positions
and a record of his performance against these goals. Then it asks four
questions:</p>
<p>What has he 〔or she〕 done well?</p>
<p>What, therefore, is he likely to be able to do well?</p>
<p>What does he have to learn or to acquire to be able to get the full
benefit from his strength?</p>
<p>If I had a son or daughter, would I be willing to have him or her
work under this person? If yes, why?</p>
<p>If no, why?</p>
<p>This appraisal actually takes a much more critical look at a person
than the usual procedure does. But it focuses on strengths. Weaknesses
are seen as limitations to the full use of strengths and to one’s own
achievement, effectiveness, and accomplishment. The last question (b.)
is the only one that is not primarily concerned with strengths.
Subordinates, especially bright, young, and ambitious ones, tend to mold
themselves after a forceful boss. There is, therefore, nothing more
corrupting and more destructive in an organization than a forceful but
basically corrupt executive. Here, therefore, is the one area where
weakness is a disqualification by itself rather than a limitation on
performance capacity and strength.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Adhere to the four questions in this reading when
conducting performance appraisals.</p>
<p>The Effective Executive</p>
<h4 id="september-how-to-develop-people">7 September How to Develop
People</h4>
<p>Any organization develops people; it either forms them or deforms
them.</p>
<p>A ny organization develops people; it has no choice. It either helps
them grow or it stunts them. What do we know about developing people?
Quite a bit. We certainly know what not to do, and those don’ts are
easier to spell out than the dos. First, one does not try to build upon
people’s weakness. One can expect adults to develop manners and behavior
and to learn skills and knowledge. But one has to use people’s
personalities the way they are, not the way we would like them to be. A
second don’t is to take a narrow and shortsighted view of the
development of people. One has to learn specific skills for a specific
job. But development is more than that: it has to be for a career and
for a life. The specific job must fit into this longer-term goal.
Another thing we know is not to establish crown princes. Look always at
performance, not at promise. With the focus on performance and not
potential, the executive can make high demands. One can always relax
standards, but one can never raise them. Next, the executive must learn
to place people’s strengths.</p>
<p>In developing people the lesson is to focus on strengths. Then make
really stringent demands, and take the time and trouble (it’s hard work)
to review performance. Sit down with people and say: “This is what you
and I committed ourselves to a year ago. How have you done? What have
you done well?”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Develop your people. Focus first on their strengths.
Then make high demands based on a person’s strengths. Finally,
periodically review their performance.</p>

Knowledge Worker as Effective Executive</h4>
<p>The executive who works at making strengths productive—his own as
well as those of others—works at making organizational performance
compatible with personal achievement.</p>
<p>S elf-development of the executive toward effectiveness is the only
available answer to satisfy both the objective needs of society for
performance by the organization, and the needs of the person for
achievement and fulfillment. It is the only way in which organization
goals and individual needs can come together. Executives who work at
making strengths productive—his own as well as those of others—work at
making organizational performance compatible with personal achievement.
They work at making their knowledge area become organizational
opportunity. And by focusing on contribution, they make their own values
become organization results.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers demand economic rewards too. Their absence is a
deterrent. But their presence is not enough. They need opportunity; they
need achievement; they need fulfillment; they need values. Only by
making themselves into effective executives can knowledge workers obtain
these satisfactions. Only executive effectiveness can enable society to
harmonize its two needs: the needs of the organization to obtain from
the individual the contribution it needs, and the need of the
individuals to have the organization serve as their tool for the
accomplishment of their purposes.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Know your strengths. Apply them to areas in your
organization where you can make a contribution. Make sure your values
and the values of the organization are compatible.</p>

and not depending on any particular company. Equally important is
managing your own career. You don’t know what you’ll be doing next, or
whether you’ll work in a private office or one big amphitheater or even
out of your home. You have to take responsibility for knowing yourself,
so you can find the right jobs as you develop and as your family becomes

<p>Remarkably few Americans are prepared to select jobs for themselves.
When you ask, “Do you know what you are good at? Do you know your
limitations?” they look you in the eye with a blank stare. Or they often
respond in terms of subject knowledge, which is the wrong answer. When
they prepare their résumés, they try to list positions like steps up a
ladder. It is time to give up thinking of jobs or career paths as we
once did and think in terms of taking on one assignment after another.
We have to leap right over the search for objective criteria and get
into the subjective—what I call competencies.</p>

<h4 id="september-defining-ones-performance">10 September Defining One’s
Performance</h4>
<p>Performance is not hitting the bull’s-eye with every shot—that is a
circus act.</p>
<p>T he first requirement of organizational health is a high demand on
performance. Indeed, one of the major reasons for demanding that
management be by objectives and that it focus on the objective
requirements of the task is the need to have managers set high standards
of performance for themselves. This requires that performance be
understood properly. Performance is not hitting the bull’s-eye with
every shot. Performance is rather the consistent ability to produce
results over prolonged periods of time and in a variety of assignments.
A performance record must include mistakes. It must include failures. It
must reveal a person’s limitations as well as his strengths.</p>
<p>The one person to distrust is the one who never makes a mistake,
never commits a blunder, never fails in what he tries to do. Either he
is a phony, or he stays with the safe, the tried, and the trivial. The
better a person is, the more mistakes he will make—for the more new
things he will try.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Define performance as a “batting average.” Create an
atmosphere where people are permitted to make mistakes. Evaluate a
person’s performance as “the consistent ability to produce results over
a relatively long period of time.”</p>

That Make a Difference</h4>
<p>What results have to be achieved to make a difference?</p>
<p>O ne question has to be asked to decide “What should I contribute?”
“Where and how can I have results that make a difference?” The answer to
this question has to balance a number of things. Results should be hard
to achieve. They should require “stretching,” to use the present
buzzword. But they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot
be achieved—or can be achieved only under the most unlikely
circumstances—is not being “ambitious.” It is being foolish. At the same
time, results should be meaningful. They should make a difference. And
they should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable.</p>
<p>The decision about “What should my contribution be?” balances three
elements. First comes the question: “What does the situation require?”
Then comes the question: “How could I make the greatest contribution,
with my strengths, my way of performing, my values, to what needs to be
done?” Finally, there is the question: “What results have to be achieved
to make a difference?” This then leads to the action conclusions: what
to do, where to start, how to start, what goals and deadlines to
set.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Define results for your position that will make a
difference. How can you make the greatest contribution based upon your
strengths? Establish goals and set deadlines for them.</p>

expectations. After two to three years of use, you will know your
strengths by tracking those decisions and actions where actual results
fell in line with or exceeded expectations. Once you have identified
your strengths through feedback analysis, you can use this knowledge to
improve performance and results. You can make this happen in five
ways.</p>
<p>First, concentrate on your strengths. Second, work on improving
strengths. You may need to learn new knowledge or to update old. Third,
recognize disabling habits. The worst, and most common, one is
arrogance. Oftentimes poor performance results from an unwillingness to
pursue knowledge outside one’s own narrow specialty. Fourth, remedy bad
habits and bad manners. All too often, a bad habit such as
procrastination or bad manners makes cooperation and teamwork all but
impossible. And fifth, figure out what you should not do.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Use feedback analysis to identify your strengths. Then
go to work on improving your strengths. Identify and eliminate bad
habits that hinder the full development of your strengths. Figure out
what you should do and do it. Finally, decide what you should not
do.</p>

Managing Oneself: How Do I Perform?</h4>
<p>Performance that violates your values corrupts, and it will
ultimately sap and destroy your strengths.</p>
<p>J ust as different people have different strengths and weaknesses,
they also work and perform in different ways. For example, some people
learn by reading, others by listening. And few readers can become
successful listeners or vice versa. Learning style is just one of
several factors that go into making up a person’s work style. There are
other questions that must be answered. Do you work best when cooperating
with others, or do you achieve results when working alone? If you work
best with others, is it usually as a subordinate, peer, or supervisor?
Do you need a predictable, structured work environment? Do you thrive
under pressure?</p>
<p>You also have to consider your personal values: are they comparable
to or at least compatible with your strengths? If there is any conflict
between your values and strengths, always choose values. Performance
that violates your values corrupts, and it will ultimately sap and
destroy your strengths. These are just some of the questions that must
be answered. What is important is to figure out your unique work
style.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Think through your work style by answering the
questions in this reading. Think through your values. Do not apply your
strengths to a position that will destroy your values. Find a position
that is compatible with your values.</p>

<p>N ow that you have identified your strengths and work style you can
begin to look for the right opportunities. These are the assignments
that will enable you to use your strength, match your work style, and
fit within your personal value system. They are also the assignments
that help you to make the right contribution. But you first have to

<p>Figuring out the right contribution helps you move from knowledge to
action. What do you think you should contribute? In other words, how can
you make a difference within your organization? Answering these
questions helps you to analyze opportunities in search for the right
few. When such opportunities do come along, it’s best to accept them if
they suit you and how you work. It requires you to think through the
requirements of a specific situation, your greatest potential
contribution, and the results that must be achieved. It is through such
processes that successful careers are built. They are not the products
of luck or planning; they are built by people who are able to seize
those opportunities that match their own strengths, work styles, and

<p>J ust as it is important for you to know your own strengths, work

work styles, and values of the people around you. Each person is an
individual, and there are likely to be great differences between
yourself and others. But such differences do not matter. What does
matter is whether everyone performs. Consistent group performance can be
achieved only if each person within the group is able to perform as an
individual. And to help make this happen, you must build on other
people’s strengths, other people’s work styles, and other people’s
values.</p>
<p>Once you have identified your strengths, work style, and values, as
well as what your contribution should be, you must then consider who
else needs to know about it. Everyone who depends on you and on whom you
depend needs to know this information about how you work. Since
communication is a two-way process, you should feel comfortable asking
your coworkers to think through and define their own strengths, work
styles, and values.</p>

<p>There are keys to success in managing bosses. First, put down on a
piece of paper a “boss list,” everyone to whom you are accountable,
everyone who appraises you and your work, everyone on whom you depend to
make effective your work and that of your people. Next, go to each of
the people on the boss list at least once a year and ask, “What do I do
and what do my people do that helps you do your job?” And, “What do we
do that hampers you and makes life more difficult for you?” It is your
job to enable each of your bosses to perform as unique individuals
according to their working styles. Your bosses should feel comfortable
that you are playing to their strengths and safeguarding them from their
limitations and weaknesses.</p>

Managing Oneself: The Second Half</h4>
<p>What to do with the second half of one’s life?</p>
<p>K nowledge workers are able physically to keep on working into old
age, and well beyond any traditional retirement age. But they run a new
risk: they may become mentally finished. What’s commonly called
“burnout,” the most common affliction of the fortysomething knowledge
worker, is very rarely the result of stress. Its common, all too common,
cause is boredom on the job.</p>
<p>In one big and highly successful company top management said to me:
“Our engineers are slacking off. Can you try to find out why?” And so I
talked to about a dozen very competent, very successful, very well paid
people in engineering. And they all said: “My job is important to the
success of the company. I like it. I have done it now for about ten
years and I am very good at it and I am very proud of it. But I can do
it now in my sleep. It no longer challenges me. I am just plain bored. I
no longer look forward to coming into the office every morning.” Yet the
obvious answer, that is to rotate people, would have been the wrong
answer. These people are topflight specialists. What they needed was to
regain some true interest. And once they had that—one of them, for
instance, started to tutor high school students in math and
science—suddenly their work, too, became again satisfying.</p>

<p>Managing oneself is based on these realities: Workers are likely to

<p>M anaging oneself is a REVOLUTION in human affairs. It requires new
and unprecedented things from the individual, and especially from the
knowledge worker. For, in effect, it demands that each knowledge worker
think and behave as a chief executive officer. It also requires an
almost 180-degree change in the knowledge workers’ thoughts and actions
from what most of us still take for granted as the way to think and the
way to act.</p>
<p>The shift from manual workers who do as they are being told—either by
the task or by the boss—to knowledge workers who have to manage
themselves profoundly challenges social structure. For every existing
society, even the most “individualist” one, takes two things for
granted, if only subconsciously: Organizations outlive workers, and most
people stay put. Managing oneself is based on the very opposite
realities. In the United States MOBILITY is accepted. But even in the
United States, workers outliving organizations—and with it the need to
be prepared for a second and different half of one’s life —is a
revolution for which practically no one is prepared. Nor is any existing

successful knowledge workers of both sexes—business managers, university
teachers, museum directors, doctors—plateau in their forties. They know
they have achieved all they will achieve. If their work is all they
have, they are in trouble. Knowledge workers therefore need to develop,
preferably while they are still quite young, a noncompetitive life and
community of their own, and some serious outside interest. This outside
interest will give them the opportunity for personal contribution and
achievement beyond the workplace.</p>
<p>No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious

who at age forty-two is being passed over for promotion in the company.
The engineer now knows that he has not been very successful in his job.
But in his outside activity—for example, as treasurer in his local
church—he has achieved success and continues to have success. And, one’s
own family may break up, but in that outside activity, there is still a
community.</p>

<p>T he people decision is a big gamble—by basing it on what a person

strength productive. They fill positions and promote based upon what a
person can do—not to minimize weakness but to maximize strength. Strong
people always have strong weaknesses. Where there are peaks there are
valleys. There is no such thing as a “good person”; “good for what?” is
the question. Look for excellence in one major area, and not for
performance that gets by all around. Human excellence can only be
achieved in one area, or at the most, in very few. Always start out with
what a person should be able to do well and then demand that he or she
really do it.</p>
<p>There is one area where weakness in itself is of importance and

anything. But their absence faults everything else. Here is the one area

Positions</h4>
<p>A widow-maker position is a job that defeats two competent people in
a row.</p>
<p>“W idow-maker” is the term that nineteenth-century New England
shipbuilders used to describe a well-built new ship that still managed
to have two fatal accidents in a row. Instead of attempting to fix the
problems with the ship, they immediately broke it up to prevent another
accident from occurring. In organizations, a widow-maker is a job that
defeats two competent people in a row. It will almost certainly defeat a
third one, no matter how competent. The only thing to do is to abolish
the widow-maker position and restructure the work. Widow-makers
typically appear when an organization experiences rapid growth or rapid
change. I have since seen this phenomenon in a lot of organizations—for
example, in a university that within ten years had moved from being
primarily an undergraduate teaching institution to becoming a major
research university. That killed off two excellent people who took on
the presidency as it had been structured the old way, and by the way,
any number of deans—again, these positions could be filled successfully
only after the university had restructured itself thoroughly.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One person
who somehow combined temperamental characteristics that are not usually
found in one person created the job and acquitted himself or herself
well. In other words, what looked like a logical job was an accident of
personality rather than the result of a genuine function. But one cannot
replace personality.</p>

be clearly established and firmly enforced, is that people beyond their
early sixties should ease out of major managerial responsibilities. It
is a sensible rule for anyone, and not only for the executive, to stay
out of decisions if one won’t be around to help bail out the company
when the decisions cause trouble a few years down the road—as most of
them do. The older executive should move into work one performs on one’s
own rather than be the “boss.” This way, he or she specializes and
concentrates on one major contribution, advises, teaches, sets
standards, and resolves conflicts, rather than works as a “manager.” The
Japanese have “counselors,” and they work very effectively, sometimes
well into their eighties.</p>

<h4 id="september-controls-control-and-management">23 September
Controls, Control, and Management</h4>
<p>The probability of an event’s being meaningful is a much more
important datum than the event itself.</p>
<p>W e are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business and in other social institutions, based on a great improvement
in techniques, especially the ability to process and analyze large
masses of data very fast. What does this mean for “control”? Especially,
what are the requirements for these greatly improved controls to give
better control to management? For, in the task of a manager, controls
are purely a means to an end; the end is control. If we deal with a
human being in a social institution, controls must become personal
motivation that leads to control. A translation is required before the
information yielded by the controls can become grounds for action—the
translation of one kind of information into another, which we call
perception. In the social institution there is a second complexity, a
second “uncertainty principle.” It is almost impossible to prefigure the
responses appropriate to a certain event in a social situation.</p>
<p>But a control-reading “profits are falling” does not indicate, with
any degree of probability, the response “raise prices,” let alone by how
much; the control-reading “sales are falling” does not indicate the
response “cut prices,” and so on. The event itself may not even be
meaningful. But even if it is, it is by no means certain what it
means.</p>

manage your organization. Eliminate each of those measures that is not
meaningful to the results of the organization.</p>

Controls: Neither Objective nor Neutral</h4>
<p>The act of measurement changes both the event and the observer.</p>
<p>I n any social situation of the kind we deal with in enterprise, the
act of measurement is neither objective nor neutral. It is subjective
and of necessity biased. It changes both the event and the observer.
Events in the social situation acquire value by the fact that they are
being singled out for the attention of being measured. The fact that
this or that set of phenomena is singled out for being “controlled”
signals that it is considered to be important. Controls in a social
institution such as a business are goal-setting and value-setting. They
are not “objective.” They are of necessity moral. Controls create
vision. They change both the events measured and the observer. They
endow events not only with meaning but with value. And this means that
the basic question is not “How do we control?” but “What do we measure
in our control system?”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Remember, “What you measure is what you get.” Ensure
that every measure of performance is pertinent to the achievement of a
goal or value of your organization. Otherwise, you risk misdirecting
your organization.</p>

Controls Should Focus on Results</h4>
<p>What today’s organization needs are synthetic sense organs for the
outside.</p>
<p>E very social institution exists to contribute to society, economy,
and individual. In consequence results exist only on the outside—in
economy, in society, and with the customer. It is the customer only who
creates a profit. Everything inside a business creates only costs, is
only a “cost center.” But results are entrepreneurial. Yet we do not
have adequate, let alone reliable, information regarding the “outside.”
The century of patient analysis of managerial, inside phenomena, events
and data, the century of patient, skillful work on the individual
operations and tasks within the business, has no counterpart with
respect to the entrepreneurial job. We can easily record and therefore
quantify efficiency, that is, efforts. It is of little value to have the
most efficient engineering department if it designs the wrong product.
And it mattered little, I daresay, during the period of IBM’s great
expansion in the fifties and sixties how “efficient” its operations
were; its basic entrepreneurial idea was the right, the effective
one.</p>
<p>The outside, the area of results, is much less accessible than the
inside. The central problem of executives in the large organization is
their insulation from the outside. What today’s organization therefore
needs are synthetic sense organs for the outside. If modern controls are
to make a contribution, it would be, above all, here.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Develop a systematic method of collecting critical
information on the environment. The information should include knowledge
of customer satisfaction, noncustomer buying habits, technological
developments, competitors, and relevant government policies.</p>

Controls for Nonmeasurable Events</h4>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the nonmeasurable is a central
and constant problem of management.</p>
<p>B usiness, like any other institution, has important results that are
incapable of being measured. Any experienced executive knows companies
or industries that are bound for extinction because they cannot attract
or hold able people. This, every experienced executive also knows, is a
more important fact about a company or an industry than last year’s
profit statement. Yet the statement cannot be defined clearly let alone
“quantified.” It is anything but “intangible”; it is very “tangible”
indeed. It is just nonmeasurable. And measurable results will not show
up for a decade.</p>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the nonmeasurable is therefore a
central and constant problem of management and a true decision area.
Measurements that do not spell out the assumptions with respect to the
nonmeasurable statements that are being made—misdirect, therefore. They
actually misinform. Yet the more we can quantify the truly measurable
areas, the greater the temptation to put all-out emphasis on those—the
greater, therefore, the danger that what looks like better controls will
actually mean less control if not a business out of control
altogether.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: List both nonmeasurable and measurable variables that
are important to the achievement of the goals of your organization.
Develop quantitative assessments for those variables that can be so
measured and qualitative assessments for those critical variables that
are qualitative.</p>

The Ultimate Control of Organizations</h4>
<p>People act as they are being rewarded or punished.</p>
<p>T here is a fundamental, incurable, basic limitation to controls in a
social institution. A social institution is comprised of persons, each
with his own purpose, his own ambitions, his own ideas, his own needs.
No matter how authoritarian the institution, it has to satisfy the
ambitions and needs of its members, and do so in their capacity as
individuals through institutional rewards and punishments, incentives,
and deterrents. The expression of this may be quantifiable—such as a
raise in salary. But the system itself is not quantitative in character
and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>Yet here is the real control of the institution. People act as they
are being rewarded or punished. For this, to them, rightly, is the true
expression of the values of the institution and of its true, as against
its professed, purpose and role. A system of controls that is not in
conformity with this ultimate control of the organization, which lies in
its people decisions, will therefore at best be ineffectual. At worst it
will cause never-ending conflict and will push the organization out of
control. In designing controls for an organization, one has to
understand and analyze the actual control of the business, its people
decisions. One has to realize that even the most powerful “instrument
board” complete with computers is secondary to the invisible,
qualitative control of any human organization, its systems of rewards
and punishments, of values and taboos.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Specify the system of rewards and punishments in your
organization, including the procedure used for making promotion
decisions. Evaluate the performance measures in place in your
organization. Make sure that good performance on the performance
measures leads to rewards and promotions.</p>

<p>A manager has two specific tasks. The first is creation of a true
whole that is larger than the sum of its parts, a productive entity that
turns out more than the sum of the resources put into it. The second
specific task of the manager is to harmonize in every decision and
action the requirements of the immediate and of the long-range future. A
manager cannot sacrifice either without endangering the enterprise.</p>
<p>If a manager does not take care of the next hundred days, there will
be no next hundred years. Whatever the manager does should be sound in
expediency as well as in basic long-range objective and principle. And
where he cannot harmonize the two time dimensions, he must at least
balance them. He must calculate the sacrifice he imposes on the
long-range future of the enterprise to protect its immediate interests,
or the sacrifice he makes today for the sake of tomorrow. He must limit
either sacrifice as much as possible. And he must repair as soon as
possible the damage it inflicts. He lives and acts in two time
dimensions, and is responsible for the performance of the whole
enterprise and of his own component in it.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Develop a system of performance measures that will lead
to maximizing the total wealth-producing capacity of your organization.

Misdirection by Specialization</h4>
<p>“I am building a cathedral.”</p>
<p>A n old story tells of three stonecutters who were asked what they
were doing. The first replied, “I am making a living.” The second kept
on hammering while he said, “I am doing the best job of stonecutting in
the entire country.” The third one looked up with a visionary gleam in
his eyes and said, “I am building a cathedral.” The third man is, of
course, the true manager. The first man knows what he wants to get out
of the work and manages to do so. He is likely to give a “fair day’s
work for a fair day’s pay.” But he is not a manager and will never be
one. It is the second man who is a problem. Workmanship is essential: in
fact, an organization demoralizes if it does not demand of its members
the highest workmanship they are capable of. But there is always a
danger that the true workman, the true professional, will believe that
he is accomplishing something when in effect he is just polishing stones
or collecting footnotes. Workmanship must be encouraged in the business
enterprise. But it must always be related to the needs of the whole.</p>

Structure</h4>
<p>Compensation must always try to balance recognition of the individual
with stability and maintenance of the group.</p>
<p>P eople have to be paid, but every compensation system is liable to
misdirect. Compensation always expresses status, both within the
enterprise and in society. It entails judgments on a person’s worth as
much as on performance. It is emotionally tied to all our ideas of
fairness, justice, and equity. Money is, of course, quantitative. But
the money in any compensation system expresses the most intangible, but
also the most sensitive, values and qualities. No attempt at a
“scientific formula” for compensation can therefore be completely
successful.</p>
<p>The best possible compensation plan is of necessity a compromise
among the various functions and meanings of compensation, for the
individual as well as for the group. Even the best plan will still
disorganize as well as organize, misdirect as well as direct, and
encourage the wrong as well as the right behavior. The preference should
be for simple compensation systems rather than for complex ones. It
should be for compensation systems that allow judgment to be used and
that enable pay to be fitted to the job of the individual rather than
impose one formula on everybody. All one can do is to watch lest the
compensation system reward the wrong behavior, emphasize the wrong
results, and direct people away from performance for the common
good.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Develop a compensation system that rewards individual
performance while balancing individual rewards with rewards that help
maintain the continuity of the entire organization as a whole.</p>

<h4 id="october-decision-objectives">2 October Decision Objectives</h4>
<p>A decision, to be effective, needs to satisfy the boundary
conditions.</p>
<p>A decision process requires clear specifications as to what the
decision has to accomplish. What are the objectives the decision has to
reach? In science these are known as “boundary conditions.” A decision,
to be effective, needs to be adequate to its purpose. The more concisely
and clearly boundary conditions are stated, the greater the likelihood
that the decision will indeed be an effective one and will accomplish
what it set out to do. Conversely, any serious shortfall in defining
these boundary conditions is almost certain to make a decision
ineffectual, no matter how brilliant it may seem.</p>
<p>“What is the minimum needed to resolve this problem?” is the form in
which the boundary conditions are usually probed. “Can our needs be
satisfied,” Alfred P. Sloan presumably asked himself when he took
command of General Motors in 1922, “by removing the autonomy of the
division heads?” His answer was clearly in the negative. The boundary
conditions of his problem demanded strength and responsibility in the
chief operating positions. This was needed as much as control at the
center and unity. The boundary conditions demanded a solution to a
problem of structure, rather than an accommodation among personalities.
And this, in turn, made his solution last.</p>

<p>Start with what is right rather than what is acceptable.</p>
<p>O ne has to start out with what is right rather than what is
acceptable precisely because one always has to compromise in the end.
But if one does not know what is right, one cannot distinguish between
the right compromise and the wrong compromise—and will end up by making
the wrong compromise. I was taught this when I started in 1944 on my
first big consulting assignment, a study of the management structure and
management policies of the General Motors Corporation. Alfred P. Sloan,
Jr., who was then chairman and chief executive officer of the company,
called me to his office at the start of my study and said: “I shall not
tell you what to study, what to write, or what conclusions to come to.
My only instruction to you is to put down what you think is right as you
see it. Don’t you worry about our reaction. And don’t you, above all,
concern yourself with the compromises that might be needed to make your
recommendations acceptable. There is not one executive in this company
who does not know how to make a compromise without any help from you.
But he can’t make the right compromise unless you first tell him what
‘right’ is.”</p>
<p>The executive thinking through a decision might put this in front of
him- or herself in neon lights.</p>

Compromise</h4>
<p>“Half a loaf is better than no bread.”</p>
<p>O ne has to start out with what is right rather than what is
acceptable (let alone who is right) precisely because one always has to
compromise in the end. But if one does not know what is right to satisfy
the specifications and boundary conditions, one cannot distinguish
between the right compromise and the wrong compromise—and will end up by
making the wrong compromise.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of compromise. One kind is expressed in
the old proverb, “Half a loaf is better than no bread.” The other kind
is expressed in the story of the Judgment of Solomon, which was clearly
based on the realization that “half a baby is worse than no baby at
all.” In the first instance, the boundary conditions are still being
satisfied. The purpose of bread is to provide food, and half a loaf is
still food. Half a baby, however, does not satisfy the boundary
conditions. For half a baby is not half of a living and growing child.
It is a corpse in two pieces.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Now think through the problem you specified in the two
previous readings. Make a decision that represents a compromise, half a
loaf, but goes in the right direction toward the ideal solution. Then
think of a compromise that is “no bread at all.”</p>

Action into the Decision</h4>
<p>A decision is only a hope until carrying it out has become somebody’s
work assignment and responsibility, with a deadline.</p>
<p>A decision is a commitment to action. Until the right thing happens,
there has been no decision. And one thing can be taken for granted: the
people who have to take the action are rarely the people who have made
the decision. No decision has, in fact, been made until carrying it out
has become somebody’s work assignment and responsibility—and with a
deadline. Until then, it’s still only a hope.</p>
<p>A decision will not become effective unless needed actions have been
built into it from the start. Converting a decision into action requires
answering several questions:</p>
<p>Who has to know of this decision?</p>
<p>What action has to be taken?</p>
<p>Who is to take it?</p>
<p>What does the action have to be so that the people who have to do it
can do it?</p>
<p>The action must be appropriate to the capacities of the people who
have to carry it out. This is especially important if people have to
change their behavior, habits, or attitudes for the decision to become
effective.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Think through a decision you have made. Who has to know
of the decision? What action has to be taken? Who has to take the
action? Make sure the people who have to take the action are able to do
so.</p>

<h4 id="october-organize-dissent">6 October Organize Dissent</h4>
<p>The effective decision-maker organizes dissent.</p>
<p>D ecisions of the kind the executive has to make are not made well by
acclamation. They are made well only if based on the clash of
conflicting views, the dialogue between different points of view, the
choice between different judgments. The first rule in decision making is
that one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., is reported to have said at a meeting of one of
the GM top committees, “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete
agreement on the decision here.” Everyone around the table nodded
assent. “Then,” continued Mr. Sloan, “I propose we postpone further
discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time
to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the
decision is all about.” There are three reasons why dissent is needed.
It first safeguards the decision maker against becoming the prisoner of
the organization. Everybody is a special pleader, trying—often in
perfectly good faith—to obtain the decision he favors. Second,
disagreement alone can provide alternatives to a decision. And a
decision without an alternative is a desperate gambler’s throw, no
matter how carefully thought through it might be. Above all,
disagreement is needed to stimulate the imagination.</p>

Necessary?</h4>
<p>One does not make unnecessary decisions any more than a good surgeon
does unnecessary surgery.</p>
<p>U nnecessary decisions not only waste time and resources, but they
also threaten to make all decisions ineffectual. Therefore, it is
important that you be able to distinguish between necessary and
unnecessary decisions. Surgeons provide perhaps the best example of
effective decision-making, as they have had to make risk-taking
decisions on a daily basis for thousands of years now. Since there is no
such thing as risk-free surgery, unnecessary operations must be avoided.
The rules used by surgeons to make decisions are:</p>
<p>Rule one: In a condition that is likely to cure itself or to
stabilize itself without risk or danger or great pain to the patient,
you put it on watch and check regularly. But you don’t cut. To do
surgery in such a condition is an unnecessary decision.</p>
<p>Rule two: If the condition is degenerative or life-threatening and
there is something you can do, you do it—fast and radically. It is a
necessary decision despite the risk.</p>
<p>Rule three: This is the problem in between, and it’s probably the
largest single category—the condition that is not degenerative and not
life-threatening but still not self-correcting and quite serious. This
is where the surgeon has to weigh opportunity against risk. And it is
this decision that distinguishes the first-rate surgeon from the
also-ran.</p>

<p>Generic events that are common within the organization and throughout

<p>Generic events that are unique for the organization but common
throughout the industry</p>
<p>Truly unique events</p>
<p>Events that appear to be unique but are really the first appearance
of a new generic problem</p>
<p>All but the truly unique event requires a generic solution. Generic
problems can be answered with standard rules and practices. Once the
right principle has been developed, all manifestations of the same
generic event can be handled by applying the standard principle. All the
executive must do is adapt the principle to the concrete circumstances
of the specific problem. Unique events, however, require a unique
solution and must be treated individually. Truly unique events are quite
rare; someone else has solved virtually every problem an organization
faces already. Applying a standard rule or principle can solve most
types of problems.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Cite an example of a problem you are facing that has a

Problem: An Example</h4>
<p>The right answer to the wrong problem is very difficult to fix.</p>
<p>D efining the problem may be the most important element in making
effective decisions—and the one executives pay the least attention to. A
wrong answer to the right problem can, as a rule, be repaired and
salvaged. But the right answer to the wrong problem, that’s very
difficult to fix, if only because it’s so difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The management of one of America’s largest manufacturing companies
prided itself on its safety record. The company had the lowest number of
accidents per one thousand employees of any company in its industry and
one of the very lowest of any manufacturing place in the world. Yet its
labor union constantly berated it for its horrendous accident rate, and
so did OSHA. The company thought this a public-relations problem and
spent large sums of money advertising its near-perfect safety record.
And yet the union attacks continued. By aggregating all accidents and
showing them as accidents per thousand workers, the company did not see
the places where there was a very high accident rate. Once the company
segregated its accidents and reported them in a number of categories it
found, almost immediately, that there was a very small number of places,
about 3 percent of all units, that had above-average accident rates. And
an even smaller number of places had very high accident rates. But they
were the places the union got its complaints from, the places whose
accidents got into the papers and into OSHA reports.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The manufacturing company described above defined the
problem of its accidents as a public-relations problem. What “facts” did

way to make sure that the problem is correctly defined is to check it

<p>If you wait until you have made the decision and then start to “sell”
it, it’s unlikely to ever become effective.</p>
<p>U nless the organization has “bought” the decision, it will remain
ineffectual; it will remain a good intention. And for a decision to be
effective, being bought has to be built into it from the start of the
decision-making process. This is one lesson to learn from Japanese
management. As soon as it starts the decision-making process, and long
before the final decision is made, Japanese management sells the
decision.</p>
<p>Everyone who is likely to be affected by a decision—say, to go into a
joint venture with a Western company or to acquire a minority stake in a
potential U.S. distributor—is asked to write down how such a decision
would affect his work, job, and unit. He is expressly forbidden to have
an opinion and to recommend or to object to the possible move. But he is
expected to think it through. And top management, in turn, then knows
where each of these people stands. Then top management makes the
decision from the top down. There isn’t much “participatory management”
in Japanese organizations. But everyone who will be affected by the
decision knows what it is all about—whether he likes it or not—and is
prepared for it. There is no need to sell it—it’s been sold.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Involve everyone who will have to carry out a decision

the Decision Against Results</h4>
<p>“Poor Ike…. Now…he’ll give an order and not a damn thing is going to
happen.”</p>
<p>F eedback has to be built into the decision to provide a continuous
testing, against actual events, of the expectations that underlie the
decision. Decisions are made by people. People are fallible; at their
best, their works do not last long. Even the best decision has a high
probability of being wrong. Even the most effective one eventually
becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected president, his
predecessor, Harry S. Truman, said: “Poor Ike; when he was a general, he
gave an order and it was carried out. Now he is going to sit in that big
office and he’ll give an order and not a damn thing is going to happen.”
The reason why “not a damn thing is going to happen” is, however, not
that generals have more authority than presidents. It is that military
organizations learned long ago that futility is the lot of most orders
and organized the feedback to check on the execution of the order. They
learned long ago that to go oneself and look is the only reliable
feedback. Reports—all a president is normally able to mobilize—are not
much help.</p>

<h4 id="october-continuous-learning-in-decision-making">14 October
Continuous Learning in Decision Making</h4>
<p>Feedback from the results of a decision compared against the
expectations when it was being made makes even moderately endowed
executives into competent decision makers.</p>
<p>I n no area is it more important than in decision making to build
continuous learning into the executive’s work. And the way to do this is
to feed back from results of the decision to the expectations when it
was being made. Whenever executives make an important decision, they put
down in writing what results are expected and when. And then the
executive, nine months or a year later, begins to feed back from the
actual results to the expected ones and keeps on doing this as long as
the decision is in force. So in an acquisition, for example, an
executive compares the actual results to the expected ones for the two
to five years it takes fully to integrate an acquisition.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much we learn by doing this and how fast. And
physicians have been taught since Hippocrates in Greece 2,400 years ago
to write down what course they expect a patient’s condition to take as a
result of the treatment the physician prescribes, that is, as a result
of the physician’s decision. And that, as every experienced physician
will tell you, is what makes even moderately endowed doctors into
competent practitioners within a few years.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: When you make an important decision, make sure to write
down the expected “prognosis.” Then at a time appropriate for the
particular decision, go out and look at what results have transpired.
Compare results to your prognosis. Use what you learn in subsequent
decision situations.</p>

<h4 id="october-placing-decision-responsibility">15 October Placing
Decision Responsibility</h4>
<p>Executives should be high enough to have the authority needed to make
the decisions and low enough to have the detailed knowledge.</p>
<p>T here are four basic characteristics that determine the nature of
any business decision. First, there is the degree of futurity in the
decision. For how long into the future does it commit the company? The
second criterion is the impact a decision has on other functions, on
other areas, or on the business as a whole. The character of a decision
is also determined by the number of qualitative factors that enter into
it: basic principles of conduct, ethical values, social and political
beliefs, and so on. Finally, decisions can be classified according to
whether they are periodically recurrent or rare, if not unique,
decisions.</p>
<p>A decision should always be made at the lowest possible level and as
close to the scene of action as possible. However, a decision should
always be made at a level ensuring that all activities and objectives
affected are fully considered. The first rule tells us how far down a
decision should be made. The second how far down it can be made, as well
as which managers must share in the decision and which must be informed
of it. The two together tell us where certain activities should be
placed.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Push decision making down to as close to the action as
possible. But remember: The longer a decision commits the organization,
the wider its impact upon other functions, the greater the number of
qualitative factors involved and finally, the rarer the decision, the
higher in the organization the decision should be made.</p>

<h4 id="october-legitimate-power-in-society">16 October Legitimate Power

<p>No society can function as a society unless the decisive social power
is legitimate.</p>
<p>L egitimate power stems from the same basic belief of society
regarding man’s nature and fulfillment on which the individual’s social
status and function rest. Indeed legitimate power can be defined as
rulership that finds its justification in the basic ethos of society. In
every society there are many powers that have nothing to do with such a
principle, and institutions that in no way are either designed or
devoted to its fulfillment. In other words, there are always a great
many “unfree” institutions in a free society, a great many inequalities
in an equal society, and a great many sinners among the saints. But as
long as the decisive social power that we call rulership is based upon
the claim of freedom, equality, or saintliness, and is exercised through
institutions that are designed toward the fulfillment of these ideal
purposes, society can function as a free, equal, or saintly society. For
its institutional structure is one of legitimate power.</p>

<p>Religion cannot accept any society without abandoning its true

<p>T he End of Economic Man reached the conclusion that the churches
could not, after all, furnish the basis for European society and
European politics. They had to fail, though not for the reasons for
which the contemporaries tended to ignore them. Religion could indeed
offer an answer to the despair of the individual and to his existential
agony. But, it could not offer an answer to the despair of the masses. I
am afraid that this conclusion still holds today. Western Man—indeed
today Man altogether—is not ready to renounce this world. Indeed he
still looks for secular salvation, if he expects salvation at all. And
churches, especially Christian churches, can (and should) preach a
“social gospel.” But they cannot (and should not) substitute politics
for Grace, and social science for Redemption. Religion, the critic of
any society, cannot accept any society or even any social program,
without abandoning its true Kingdom, that of a Soul alone with its God.
Therein lies both the strength of the churches as the conscience of
society and their incurable weakness as political and social forces of
society.</p>

<h4 id="october-capitalism-justified">18 October Capitalism
Justified</h4>
<p>Capitalism as a social order and as a creed is the expression of the
belief in economic progress as leading toward the freedom and equality
of the individual in the free and equal society.</p>
<p>C apitalism expects the free and equal society to result from the
enthronement of private profit as supreme ruler of social behavior.
Capitalism did not, of course, invent the “profit motive.” Profit has
always been one of the main motivating forces of the individual and will
always be—regardless of the social order in which one lives. But the
capitalist creed was the first and only social creed that valued the
profit motive positively as the means by which the ideal free and equal
society would be automatically realized. All previous creeds had
regarded the profit motive as socially destructive, or at least
neutral.</p>
<p>Capitalism has, therefore, to endow the economic sphere with
independence and autonomy, which means that economic activities must not
be subjected to noneconomic considerations, but must rank higher. All
social energies have to be concentrated upon the promotion of economic
ends, because economic progress carries the promise of the social
millennium. This is capitalism: and without this social end it has

centuries of empires and superstates, it has transformed itself
profoundly in the last hundred years. It mutated into the Megastate. The
shift from the national state to the Megastate began in the last decades
of the nineteenth century. The first small step toward the Megastate was
German chancellor Bismarck’s invention in the 1880s of the Welfare
State. The other major social program of the period immediately after
World War II, the British National Health Service, was the first one
(outside of the totalitarian countries) to take government beyond the
role of insurer or provider. Hospitals and hospital care under the
National Health Service were taken over by government. The people
working in hospitals became government employees; and government
actually manages the hospitals.</p>
<p>By 1960, it had become accepted doctrine in all developed Western
countries that government is the appropriate agent for all social
problems and all social tasks. And this held until the 1990s.</p>

<p>Every government is a “government of forms.”</p>
<p>G overnment is a poor manager. It is, of necessity, concerned with
procedure, and it is also, of necessity, large and cumbersome.
Government is also properly conscious of the fact that it administers
public funds and must account for every penny. It has no choice but to
be “bureaucratic.” Whether government is a “government of laws” or a
“government of men” is debatable. But every government is, by
definition, a “government of forms.” This means inevitably high
costs.</p>
<p>But, the purpose of government is to make fundamental decisions, and
to make them effectively. The purpose of government is to focus the
political energies of society. It is to dramatize issues. It is to
present fundamental choices. The purpose of government, in other words,
is to govern. This, as we have learned, in other institutions, is
incompatible with “doing.” Any attempt to combine governing with “doing”
on a large scale, paralyzes the decision-making capacity. Business has
had to face, on a much smaller scale, the problem that modern government
now faces: the incompatibility between “governing” and “doing.” Business
management learned that the two have to be separated, and that the top
organ, the decision maker, has to be detached from “doing.” Otherwise he
does not make decisions, and the “doing” does not get done either. In
business this goes by the name of “decentralization.”</p>

discharges the “doing” tasks. It would rather be a systematic policy of
using the other, the nongovernmental institutions of the society of
organizations, for the actual “doing,” that is, for performance,
operations, execution.</p>
<p>Government would start out by asking the question: “How do these
institutions work and what can they do?” It would then ask: “How can
political and social objectives be formulated and organized in such a
manner as to become opportunities for performance for these
institutions?” It would then ask: “And what opportunities for
accomplishment of political objectives do the abilities and capacities
of these institutions offer to government?” Reprivatization will not
weaken government. Indeed, its main purpose is to restore strength and
performance capacity to sick and incapacitated government. We cannot go
much further along the road on which government has been traveling. All

<p>W e do not face a “withering away of the state,” as Karl Marx
promised. On the contrary, we need a vigorous, a strong, and a very
active government. But we do face a choice between big and impotent
government and a government that is strong because it confines itself to
decision and direction and leaves the “doing” to others. We do not face
a “return of laissez-faire” in which the economy is left alone. In all
major areas we have a new choice in this pluralist society of
organizations: an organic diversity in which institutions are used to do
what they are best equipped to do.</p>
<p>Government would figure out how to structure a given political
objective so as to make it attractive to one of the autonomous
institutions. And just as we praise a composer for his ability to write
“playable” music, which best uses the specific performance
characteristic of French horn, violin, or flute, we may come to praise
the lawmaker who best structures a particular task so as to make it most
congenial for this or that of the autonomous, self-governing, private
institutions of pluralist society.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Write a letter to an editor praising a lawmaker who
structures government programs to be managed by nongovernmental
institutions and to have the ability to solve social problems where
government programs are deficient.</p>

<p>W e need strong, effective governments in the international sphere so
that we can make the sacrifices of sovereignty needed to give us working
supranational institutions for the world society and world economy.</p>
<p>Protection of the environment today requires international ecological
laws. We might “quarantine” polluters and forbid shipment in
international commerce of goods produced under conditions that seriously
pollute or damage the human habitat—for example, by polluting the
oceans, by raising the temperature of the atmosphere, or by depleting
its ozone. This will be decried as “interference with sovereign
nations”—and so it is. It will probably require that the developed rich
countries compensate the developing poor ones for the high costs of
environmental protection, such as sewage treatment plants. In fact,
environmental protection might well be the most productive purpose of
foreign aid and far more successful than development aid.</p>

Labor Unions</h4>
<p>To become again a dynamic, effective, legitimate organ, the labor
union will have to transform itself.</p>
<p>T he true strength of the labor movement in developed countries has
been moral: its claim to be the political conscience of a modern secular
society.</p>
<p>Management—no matter who “owns” and no matter whether the institution
is a business, a government agency, or a hospital—has to have
considerable power and authority—power and authority grounded in the
needs of the enterprise and based on competence. And power, as the
drafters of the American Constitution knew, needs to be limited by
countervailing power. Modern society, a society of organizations each
requiring strong management, needs an organ such as the labor union. In
the last few years events have amply proved this. But to become again a
dynamic, effective, legitimate organ, the labor union will have to
transform itself drastically. Otherwise the union will become
irrelevant.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Reflect on constructive ways labor unions can check the
power of businesses, governments, and hospitals.</p>

Political Integration of Knowledge Workers</h4>
<p>Knowledge workers are, to coin a term, “uniclass.”</p>
<p>The new majority, the “knowledge worker,” does not fit any
interest-group definition.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers are neither farmers nor labor nor business; they
are employees of organizations. Yet they are not “proletarians” and do
not feel “exploited” as a class.</p>
<p>Collectively, they are “capitalists” through their pension funds.</p>
<p>Many of them are themselves bosses and have “subordinates.”</p>
<p>Yet they also have a boss themselves.</p>
<p>They are not middle-class, either.</p>
<p>They are, to coin a term, “uniclass”—though some of them make more
money than others.</p>
<p>It makes absolutely no difference to their social position whether
they work for a business, a hospital, or a university.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers who move from accounting work in a business to
accounting work in a hospital are not changing social or economic
position.</p>
<p>They are changing a job.</p>
<p>This status implies no specific economic or social culture. So far
there is no political concept, no political integration that fits
them.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Knowledge workers are capitalists in both the old and
new senses. Do you see any political party addressing the interests of
these new capitalists?</p>

The Corporation as a Political Institution</h4>
<p>In dealing with constituencies outside the primary task, managers
have to think politically.</p>
<p>When it comes to the performance of the primary task of an
institution—whether economic goods and services in the case of the
business, health care in that of a hospital, or scholarship and higher
education in that of the university—the rule is to optimize.</p>
<p>There, managers have to base their decisions on what is right rather
than on what is acceptable. But in dealing with the constituencies
outside and beyond this narrow definition of the primary task, managers
have to think politically—in terms of the minimum needed to placate and
appease and keep quiet constituent groups that otherwise might use their
power of veto. Managers cannot be politicians. They cannot confine
themselves to “satisficing” decisions. But they also cannot be concerned
only with optimization in the central area of performance of their
institution. They have to balance both approaches in one continuous
decision-making progress. The corporation is an economic institution.
But it is also a political institution.</p>
<p>Managers have to think through what the constituencies are that can
effectively veto and block decisions, and what their minimum
expectations and needs should be.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: List the constituents of your enterprise. Next, list
how you plan to optimize the needs of your customers and meet at least
the minimum expectations of each of the other constituents.</p>

<p>The nonprofit institution is not merely delivering a service. It
wants the end user to be not a user but a doer. It uses a service to
bring about a change in human beings. It attempts to become a part of
the recipient rather than merely a supplier.</p>
<p>Nonprofit institutions used to think they didn’t need marketing. But,
as a famous old saying by a great nineteenth-century con man has it,
“It’s much easier to sell the Brooklyn Bridge than to give it away.”
<strong>Nobody trusts you if you offer something for free.</strong> You
need to market even the most beneficial service. But the marketing you
do in the nonprofit sector is quite different from selling. It’s more a
matter of looking at your service from the recipient’s point of view.
You have to know what to sell, to whom to sell, and when to sell.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: The mission of the Salvation Army is to make citizens
out of the rejected. How does that service look from the recipient’s
point of view? How should the Salvation Army market that service?</p>

<p>Fund-raising is going around with a begging bowl.</p>
<p>The nonprofit institution needs a fund-development strategy.</p>
<p>The source of its money is probably the greatest single difference
between the nonprofit sector and business and government.</p>
<p>A business raises money by selling to its customers; the government
taxes.</p>
<p>The nonprofit institution has to raise money from donors.</p>
<p>It raises money, or at least a large portion of it—from people who
want to participate in the cause but who are not beneficiaries.</p>
<p>A nonprofit institution that becomes a prisoner of money-raising is
in serious trouble and in a serious identity crisis.</p>
<p>The purpose of a strategy for raising money is precisely to enable
the nonprofit institution to carry out its mission without subordinating
that mission to fund-raising.</p>

<p>This is why nonprofit people have now changed the term they use from

<p>Fund development is creating a constituency that supports the

<p>The board not only helps think through the institution’s mission, it
is the guardian of that mission and makes sure the organization lives up
to its basic mission.</p>
<p>The board has the responsibility of making sure the nonprofit has
competent management—and the right management.</p>
<p>The board’s role is to appraise the performance of the
organization.</p>
<p>The board is also the premier fund-raising organ of a nonprofit
organization.</p>
<p>Over the door to the nonprofit’s boardroom there should be an
inscription in big letters that says: MEMBERSHIP ON THIS BOARD IS NOT
POWER; IT IS RESPONSIBILITY.</p>
<p>Board membership means responsibility not just to the organization
but to the board itself, to, the staff, and to the institution’s
mission.</p>
<p>A common problem is the badly split board.</p>
<p>Every time an issue comes up, the board members fight out their basic
policy rift.</p>
<p>This is much more likely in nonprofit institutions precisely because
the mission is, and should be, so important.</p>
<p>The role of the board then becomes both more important and more
controversial.</p>
<p>At that point, teamwork between the chairperson and chief executive

<p>Mass enables the organization to put to work a great many more kinds
of knowledge and skill than could possibly be combined in any one person

<p>But mass is also a limitation. An organization, no matter what it
would like to do, can only do a small number of tasks at any one time.
This is not something that better organization or “effective

<p><strong>The law of organization is concentration.</strong></p>
<p>Yet modern organization must be capable of change. Indeed it must be
capable of initiating change, that is innovation.</p>
<p>It must be able to move scarce and expensive resources of knowledge
from areas of low productivity and nonresults to opportunities for
achievement and contribution.</p>
<p>This, however, requires the ability to stop doing what wastes

<p>Organized information about the environment needs to include
information about actual and potential competitors worldwide.</p>
<p>However, not all outside information is available. But, even when
information is available, many businesses are oblivious to it.</p>
<p>Half of new technologies that transform an industry come from outside

<p>Molecular biology and genetic engineering were not developed by the
giant pharmaceutical industry, yet they are transforming the entire
health-care industry.</p>
<p>Information on these developments is available and companies in the
pharmaceutical industry must keep abreast of these developments.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify three technologies that are transforming your
business that have come from outside of your industry. Set up an

<p><strong>The ultimate test of an information system is that there are

<p>The ultimate test of an information system is that there are no
surprises. Before events become significant, executives have already
adjusted to them, analyzed them, understood them, and taken appropriate
action.</p>
<p>One example is the very few American financial institutions that, in
the late 1990s, were not surprised by the collapse of mainland Asia.
They had thought through what “information” means in respect to Asian
economies and Asian currencies.</p>
<p>They had gradually eliminated all the information they got from
within their own subsidiaries and affiliates in these countries—these,
they had begun to realize, were just “data.” Instead, they had begun to
organize their information about such things as the ratio between
short-term borrowing and the country’s balance of payments and
information about funds available to service foreign short-term
debt.</p>
<p>Long before these ratios turned so unfavorable as to make a panic in
mainland Asia inevitable, these executives had realized that it was
coming. They realized that they had to decide whether to pull out of
these countries, or to stay for the very long term. They had, in other
words, realized what economic data are meaningful in respect to emerging
countries, had organized them, had analyzed them, and had interpreted
them. They had turned the data into information—and had decided what
action to take long before that action became necessary.</p>

<p>In good times expenditures are increased across the board. In bad
times expenditures are cut across the board.</p>
<p>This, however, practically guarantees missing out on the future. The
change leader’s first budget is an operating budget that shows operating
and capital outlays to maintain the present business.</p>
<p>That budget should always be approached with the question: “What is
the minimum we need to spend to keep operations going?” And in poor
times it should, indeed, be adjusted downward.</p>
<p>And then the change leader has a second, separate budget for the
future.</p>
<p>The future budget should be approached with the question: “What is
the maximum funding these new activities require to produce optimal
results.”</p>
<p>That amount should be maintained in good times or bad—unless times
are so catastrophic that maintaining expenditures threatens the survival
of the enterprise.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: <strong>Prepare a “development budget” that contains
funds to exploit opportunities. Make sure the budget provides stability
of funding in good times and bad.</strong></p>

<p>I was once opposed to the term “strategy.” I thought it smacked too
much of the military. But I have slowly become a convert. That is
because in many businesses and nonprofit organizations, planning is an
intellectual exercise. You put it in a nicely bound volume on your shelf
and leave it there. Everybody feels virtuous; we have done the planning.
But until it becomes actual work, you have done nothing. Strategies, on
the other hand, are action-focused. So I have reluctantly accepted the

<p>The future will not just happen if one wishes hard enough.</p>
<p>T he future requires decisions—now. It imposes risk—now. It requires
action—now. It demands allocation of resources, and above all, of human
resources—now. It requires work—now.</p>
<p>The idea of long-range planning—and much of its reality—rests on a
number of misunderstandings. The long range is largely made by short-run
decisions. Unless the long range is built into, and based on,
short-range plans and decisions, the most elaborate long-range plan will
be an exercise in futility. And conversely, unless the short-range
plans—that is, the decisions on the here and now—are integrated into one
unified plan of action, they will be expedient, guess, and misdirection.
“Short range” and “long range” are not determined by any given time
span. A decision is not short range because it takes only a few months
to carry it out. What matters is the time span over which it is
effective. Long-range planning should prevent managers from uncritically
extending present trends into the future, from assuming that today’s
products, services, markets, and technologies will be the products,
services, markets, and technologies of tomorrow, and, above all, from
dedicating their resources and energies to the defense of yesterday.
Everything that is “planned” becomes immediate work and commitment.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Focus your long-range planning on decisions based on
such questions as these: “Which of our present businesses should we
abandon? Which should we play down? Which should we push and supply new
resources to?”</p>

<h4 id="november-how-to-abandon">10 November How to Abandon</h4>
<p>Abandonment must be practiced systematically.</p>
<p>“T o abandon what?” and “To abandon how?” have to be practiced
systematically. Otherwise they will always be “postponed,” for they are
never “popular” policies.</p>
<p>In one fairly big company offering outsourcing services in most
developed countries, the first Monday of every month is set aside for an
abandonment meeting at every management level from top management to the
supervisors in each area. Each of these sessions examines one part of
the business—one of the services one Monday, one of the regions in which
the company does business a month later, the way this or that service is
organized the Monday morning of the third month, and so on. Within the
year, the company this way examines itself completely, including its
personnel policies, for instance. In the course of a year, three to four
major decisions are likely to be made on the “what” of the company’s
services and perhaps twice as many decisions to change the “how.” But
also each year, three to five ideas for new things to do come out of
these sessions. These decisions to change anything—whether to abandon
something, whether to abandon the way something is being done, or
whether to do something new—are reported each month to all members of
management. And twice a year all management levels report on what has
actually happened as a result of their sessions, what action has been
taken and with what results.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Implement a process of systematic abandonment, such as
setting aside the first Monday of every month for an abandonment
meeting.</p>

don’t ask:</p>
<p>“Who’ll make the best husband for her?” Ask instead:</p>
<p>“For which kind of a man would she make a good wife?”</p>
<p>D ivestment is a “marketing” rather than a “selling” problem. The
question is not: “What do we want to sell and for how much?” It is: “For
whom is this venture ‘value’ and under what conditions?” The salient
point is finding the potential buyer for whom what is misfit to the
seller is a perfect fit, the buyer to whom the venture to be sold offers
the best opportunity or solves the worst problem. This is then also the
buyer who will pay the most.</p>
<p>A major printing company decided that a mass-circulation magazine it
owned was at best a partial fit and should be sold. The magazine had
been bought originally to hold its printing contract. They asked, “What
is value to a magazine publishing company?” “If it is a growing magazine
company,” they answered, “its greatest need is cash. For a growing
magazine requires heavy cash investments in building circulation for
several years. “How can we supply this need of the potential buyer to
our own advantage?” was the next question. And the answer was, “By
giving him ninety days rather than the customary thirty days to pay his
print and paper bill to our printing plants.” The printing company then
rapidly found a publishing group that filled their requirements.</p>

Manager</h4>
<p>Managers can improve their performance by improving their performance
of these constituent activities.</p>
<p>T here are five basic operations in the work of the manager.</p>
<p>Managers, in the first place, set objectives. They determine what the
objectives should be. They determine what the goals in each area of
objectives should be. They decide what has to be done to reach these
objectives. They make the objectives effective by communicating them to
the people whose performance is needed to attain them.</p>
<p>Second, managers organize. They analyze the activities, decisions,
and relations needed. They classify the work. They divide it into
manageable activities and further divide the activities into manageable
jobs. They group these units and jobs into an organization structure.
They select people for the management of these units and for the jobs to
be done.</p>
<p>Next, managers motivate and communicate. They make a team out of the
people who are responsible for various jobs.</p>
<p>The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is measurement.
The manager establishes yardsticks—and few factors are as important to
the performance of the organization and of every person in it.</p>
<p>Finally, managers develop people, including themselves.</p>

<h5 id="care-about-the-term-get-by"><a href="./hash/0010.html">care
about the term ‘get by’!</a></h5>
<p>Self-control means stronger motivation: a desire to do the best
rather than just enough to get by. It means higher performance goals and
broader vision. Even if management by objectives were not necessary to
give the enterprise the unity of direction and effort of a management
team, it would be necessary to make possible management by
self-control.</p>
<p><strong>“Control” means the ability to direct oneself and one’s
work.</strong> It can also mean domination of one person by another.</p>
<h5 id="设定目标是为了自我管理而不是为了目标本身"><a

<p><strong>Objectives are the basis of “control” in the first sense; but
they must never become the basis of “control” in the second, for this
would defeat their purpose.</strong> Indeed, one of the major
contributions of management by objectives is that it enables us to
substitute management by self-control for management by domination.</p>
<p>It should be clearly understood what behavior and methods the company
bars as unethical, unprofessional, or unsound.</p>
<p>But <strong>within these limits every manager must be free to decide
what he or she has to do.</strong></p>

<h4 id="november-how-to-use-objectives">14 November How to Use
Objectives</h4>
<p>Objectives are not fate; they are direction.</p>
<p><strong>If objectives are only good intentions, they are worthless.
They must degenerate into work. And work is always specific, always
has—or should have—clear, unambiguous, measurable results, a deadline,
and a specific assignment of accountability.</strong> But
<strong>objectives that become a straitjacket do harm. Objectives are
always based on expectations. And expectations are, at best, informed
guesses. The world does not stand still.</strong></p>
<h5 id="你有目标么注意目标不是理想"><a
href="./hash/0012.html">你有目标么？注意！目标不是理想。</a></h5>
<p>The proper way to use objectives is the way an airline uses schedules
and flight plans. The schedule provides for the 9 AM flight from Los
Angeles to get to Boston by 5 PM . But if there is a blizzard in Boston
that day, the plane will land in Pittsburgh instead and wait out the
storm. The flight plan provides for flying at thirty thousand feet and
for flying over Denver and Chicago. But if the pilot encounters
turbulence or strong headwinds, he will ask flight control for
permission to go up another five thousand feet and to take the
Minneapolis–Montreal route. Yet <strong>no flight is ever operated
without a schedule and flight plan.</strong> Any change is immediately
fed back to produce a new schedule and flight plan. <strong>Objectives
are not fate; they are direction. They are not commands; they are
commitments.</strong> They do not determine the future; they are a means
to mobilize the resources and energies of the business for the making of
the future.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Set and use objectives the way an airline uses
schedules and flight plans.</p>

<h4 id="november-the-management-letter">15 November The Management
Letter</h4>
<p><strong>Managing managers requires special efforts not only to
establish common direction, but to eliminate misdirection.</strong></p>
<p>Setting objectives is so important that some of the most effective
managers I know have each of their subordinates write a “manager’s
letter” twice a year.</p>
<p>In this letter to his superior, each manager first defines the
objectives of his superior’s job and of his own job as he sees them.</p>
<p>He then sets down the performance standards that he believes are
being applied to him.</p>
<p>Next, he lists the things he must do to attain these goals—and the
things within his own unit he considers the major obstacles.</p>
<p>He lists the things his superior and the company do that help him and
the things that hamper him.</p>
<p>Finally, he outlines what he proposes to do during the next year to
reach his goals.</p>
<p>If his superior accepts this statement, the “manager’s letter”
becomes the charter under which the manager operates.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual understanding can never be attained by “communications
down,” can never be created by talking. It can result only from
“communications up.”</strong></p>

Organization</h4>
<p>The only things that evolve by themselves in an organization are
disorder, friction, malperformance.</p>
<p>The pioneers of management a century ago were right: organizational
structure is needed. The modern enterprise needs organization. But the
pioneers were wrong in their assumption that there is—or should be—one
right organization.</p>
<p><strong>Instead of searching for the right organization, management
needs to learn to look for, to develop, to test, the organization that
fits the task.</strong></p>
<p>There are some “principles” of organization.</p>
<p>One is that organization has to be transparent. People have to know
and have to understand the organization structure they are supposed to
work in. Someone in the organization must have the authority to make the
final decision in a given area. <strong>It also is a sound principle
that authority be commensurate with responsibility.</strong> It is a
sound principle that any one person in an organization should have only
one “master.” These principles are not too different from the ones that
inform an architect’s work. They do not tell him what kind of building
to build. They tell him what the restraints are. And this is pretty much
what the various principles of organization structure do.</p>

Quantification</h4>
<h5 id="是呀对于社会问题定量化分析又啥意义"><a
href="./hash/0009.html">是呀，对于社会问题定量化分析，又啥意义？</a></h5>
<p>The most important reason why I am not a quantifier is that in social
affairs, events that matter cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>For example, Henry Ford’s ignorance in 1900 or 1903 of the prevailing
economic wisdom that the way to maximize profit was to be a
monopolist—that is, to keep production low and prices high—led him to
assume that the way to make money was to keep prices low and production
high.</p>
<p>This, the invention of “mass production,” totally changed industrial
economics.</p>
<p>It would have been impossible, however, to quantify the impact even
as late as 1918 or 1920, years after Ford’s success had made him the
richest industrialist in the United States, and probably in the
world.</p>
<p>He had revolutionized industrial production, the automobile industry,
and the economy in general, and had, above all, completely changed our
perception of industry.</p>
<p>The unique event that changes the universe is an event “at the
margin.”</p>
<p>By the time it becomes statistically significant, it is no longer
“future”; it is, indeed, no longer even “present.” It is already
“past.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify a unique event with an impact that is
unquantifiable now, but is likely to transform your organization in the
next decade. Be out in front and take advantage of the opportunities it
will afford.</p>

<h4 id="november-hierarchy-and-equality">18 November Hierarchy and

<p>One hears a great deal today about “the end of hierarchy.”</p>
<p>That is blatant nonsense.</p>
<p>T o attack industrial society, as would the sentimental equalitarian,
because it is based on subordination instead of on formal equality is a
misunderstanding of the nature of both industry and society. Like every
other institution that coordinates human efforts to a social end, the
corporation must be organized on hierarchical lines. But, also,
everybody from the boss to the sweeper must be seen as equally necessary
to the success of the common enterprise. At the same time, the large
corporation must offer equal opportunities for advancement. This is
simply the traditional demand for justice, a consequence of the
Christian concept of human dignity.</p>
<p>The demand for equal opportunities is not, as is often mistakenly
assumed, a demand for absolute equality of rewards. On the contrary,
equal opportunities automatically assume an inequality of rewards. For
the very concept of justice implies rewards graduated according to
unequal performance and unequal responsibility.</p>

boss and the sweeper, or just the boss?</p>

<h4 id="november-characteristics-of-organizations">19 November
Characteristics of Organizations</h4>
<p>Organization is a tool. As with any tool, the more specialized its
given task, the greater its performance capacity.</p>
<p>O rganizations are special-purpose institutions. They are effective
because they concentrate on one task. If you were to go to the American
Lung Association and say, “Ninety percent of all adult Americans suffer
from ingrown toenails; we need your expertise in research, health
education, and prevention to stamp out this dreadful scourge,” you’d get
the answer: “We are interested only in what lies between the hips and
the shoulders.” That explains why the American Lung Association or the
American Heart Association or any of the other organizations in the
health field get results.</p>
<p>Society, community, family, have to deal with whatever problem
arises. To do so in an organization is “diversification.” And in an
organization, diversification means splintering. It destroys the
performance capacity of any organization—whether business, labor union,
school, hospital, community service, or church. Because the organization
is composed of specialists, each with his or her own narrow knowledge
area, its mission must be crystal clear. The organization must be
single-minded, otherwise its members become confused. They will follow
their specialty rather than applying it to the common task. They will
each define “results” in terms of that specialty, imposing their own
values on the organization. Only a clear, focused, and common mission
can hold the organization together and enable it to produce results.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make sure your organization has a clear focus, a
mission that everyone can identify with, and that it concentrates on
producing results.</p>

<h4 id="november-the-federal-principle">20 November The Federal
Principle</h4>
<p>Federalism relieves top management from operating duties and sets it
free to devote itself to its proper functions.</p>
<p>What the enterprise needs is a principle that gives both the center
and the parts genuine managerial functions and powers. This principle is
federalism, in which the whole of the enterprise is conceived as made up
of autonomous units. The federal enterprise and all its units are in the
same business. The same economic factors determine the future of the
whole as well as of all units; the same basic decisions have to be made
for all of them; the same kind and type of executive is needed. Hence
the whole requires a unified management in charge of the basic
functions: the decision what business the enterprise is in, the
organization of the human resources, and the selection, training, and
testing of future leaders.</p>
<p>At the same time, each unit is a business by itself. It produces its
own products for a distinct market. Each unit must, therefore, have wide
autonomy within limits set by the general decisions of the management of
the whole. Each unit has to have its own management. The local
management will be primarily an operating management; it will be
concerned mainly with the present and immediate future rather than with
basic policy. But within a limited scope it will have also to discharge
real top-management functions.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Make maximum use of the federal principle.</p>
<p>The New Society</p>
<h4 id="november-federal-decentralization-strengths">21 November Federal
Decentralization: Strengths</h4>
<p>The greatest strength of the federal principle is that it alone of
all known principles of organization prepares and tests people for
top-management responsibility at an early stage.</p>
<p>I n “federal decentralization” a company is organized into a number
of autonomous businesses. Each unit has responsibility for its own
performance, its own results, and its own contribution to the total
company. Each unit has its own management which, in effect, runs its own
“autonomous business.”</p>
<p>In a federally organized structure, each manager is close enough to
business performance and business results to focus on them. The federal
principle therefore enables us to divide large and complex organizations
into a number of businesses that are small and simple enough that
managers know what they are doing and can direct themselves toward the
performance of the whole instead of becoming prisoners of their own
work, effort, and skill. Because management by objectives and
self-control become effective, the number of people or units under one
manager is no longer limited by the span of control; it is limited only
by the much wider span of managerial responsibility. The greatest
strength of the federal principle is, however, with respect to manager
development. This by itself makes it the principle to be used in
preference to any other.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Give people maximum responsibility by organizing
according to the federal principle. Become an organization that develops
numerous people.</p>
<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<h4 id="november-federal-decentralization-requirements">22 November
Federal Decentralization: Requirements</h4>
<p>As a minimum the unit must contribute a profit to the company rather
than merely contribute to the profit of the company.</p>
<p>F ederal decentralization has stringent requirements. Federal
decentralization is applicable only where a company can truly be
organized into a number of genuine “businesses.” This is its basic
limitation. As a minimum the unit must contribute a profit to the
company. And it must be a genuine profit determined by the objective
judgment of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization will work only if the top-management job is
clearly defined and thought through. Federalization, if properly
applied, makes top management capable of doing its own job precisely
because it does not have to worry about operations, but can concentrate
on direction, strategy, objectives, and key decisions for the future.
The federal principle demands great responsibility from the operating
units, the autonomous businesses. They are given the maximum of
autonomy; and this requires that they assume the maximum of
responsibility. Federal decentralization requires centralized controls
and common measurements. Both the managers of the autonomous businesses
and top management must know what is expected of each business, what is
meant by “performance,” and what developments are important. To be able
to give autonomy one must have confidence. And this requires controls
that make opinions unnecessary. A federal unit of a company is
autonomous, but it is not independent and should not be. Its autonomy is
a means toward better performance for the entire company.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Ensure that executives of your autonomous units have
maximum autonomy and maximum responsibility. Implement this by
establishing a system of controls that makes performance or the lack of
performance very evident.</p>
<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<h4 id="november-reservation-of-authority">23 November Reservation of
Authority</h4>
<p>There must be a kind of “supremacy clause” reserving to central
management the decisions that affect the business as a whole and its
long-range future welfare.</p>
<p>Top management in a decentralized company must think through
carefully what decisions it reserves for itself. For there are decisions
that have to do with the entire company, its integrity, and its future.
These decisions can be made only by somebody who sees the whole and is
responsible for the whole. Specifically, there must be three reserved
areas if the business is to remain a whole rather than splinter into
fragments.</p>
<p>Top management, and top management alone, can make the decision on
what technologies, markets, and products to go into, what businesses to
start and what businesses to abandon, and also what the basic values,
beliefs, and principles of the company are.</p>
<p>Second, top management must reserve to itself the control of the
allocation of the key resource of capital. Both the supply of capital
and its investment are top-management responsibilities that cannot be
turned over to the autonomous units of a federal organization.</p>
<p>Third, the other key resource is people. The people in a federally
organized company, and especially managers and key professionals, are a
resource of the entire company rather than of any one unit.</p>
<p>The company’s policies with respect to people and decisions on key
appointments in the decentralized autonomous businesses are
top-management decisions—though of course, autonomous business managers
need to take an active part in them.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: <strong>Reserve certain key decisions for top
management, especially those having to do with the mission, values, and
direction of the organization; the allocation of capital; and the
selection of key people.</strong></p>

<h4 id="november-simulated-decentralization">24 November Simulated
Decentralization</h4>
<p>The main rule is to look upon simulated decentralization as a last
resort only.</p>
<p>W henever a unit can be set up as a business, no design principle can
match federal decentralization. We have learned, however, that a great
many large companies cannot be divided into genuine businesses. Yet they
have clearly outgrown the limits of size and complexity of the
functional or of the team structure. These are the companies that are
increasingly turning to “simulated decentralization” as the answer to
their organization problem. Simulated decentralization forms structural
units that are not businesses but which are still set up as if they were
businesses, with maximum possible autonomy, with their own management,
and with at least a “simulation” of profit-and-loss responsibility. They
buy from and sell to each other using “transfer prices” determined
internally rather than by an outside market. Or their “profits” are
arrived at by internal allocation of costs to which then, often, a
“standard fee,” such as 20 percent of costs, is added.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Produce internal competition by using “micro”
profit-centers when feasible. Attribute revenue to each unit and match
revenue with its cost.</p>

<h4 id="november-building-blocks-of-organization">25 November Building
Blocks of Organization</h4>
<p>Contribution determines ranking and placement.</p>
<p>“W hat activities belong together and what activities belong apart?”
A searching analysis is needed that groups activities by the kind of
contribution they make. There are four major groups of activities, if
distinguished by their contribution. First, result-producing activities
—that is, activities that produce measurable results that can be
related, directly or indirectly, to the results and performance of the
entire enterprise. Second, support activities that, while needed and
even essential, do not by themselves produce results but have results
only through the use made of their “output” by other components within
the business. Third, activities that have no direct or indirect
relationship to the results of the business, activities that are truly
ancillary. They are hygiene and housekeeping activities. Finally, is the
top-management activity. Among the result-producing activities, there
are some that directly bring in revenues (or in service institutions,
directly produce “patient care” or “learning”). Here belong innovating
activities, selling and all the work needed to do a systematic and
organized selling job. Here also belongs the treasury function, that is,
the supply and management of money in the business.</p>
<p>Key activities should never be subordinated to nonkey activities.
Revenue-producing activities should never be subordinated to
nonrevenue-producing activities. And support activities should never be
mixed with revenue-producing and result-contributory activities.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Give result-producing activities high visibility in
your organization. Make sure support activities are subordinated to
result-producing activities. Consider delegating employee welfare
activities to employee teams.</p>

<h4 id="november-fundamentals-of-communications">26 November
Fundamentals of Communications</h4>
<p>To improve communications, work not on the utterer but the
recipient.</p>
<p>I t is the recipient who communicates. Unless there is someone who
hears, there is no communication. There is only noise. One can perceive
only what one is capable of perceiving. One can communicate only in the
recipients’ language or in their terms. And the terms have to be
experience-based. We perceive, as a rule, what we expect to perceive. We
see largely what we expect to see, and we hear largely what we expect to
hear. The unexpected is usually not received at all. Communication
always makes demands. It always demands that the recipient become
somebody, do something, believe something. It always appeals to
motivation. If it goes against her aspirations, her values, her
motivations, it is likely not to be received at all or, at best, to be
resisted.</p>
<p>Where communication is perception, information is logic. As such,
information is purely formal and has no meaning. Information is always
encoded. To be received, let alone to be used, the code must be known
and understood by the recipient. This requires prior agreement, that is,
some communication.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Take steps to improve communications by asking
recipients to initiate an information exchange. Formulate questions such
as, “What objectives do you believe are appropriate for your area of
responsibility next quarter?”</p>

<h4 id="november-rules-for-staff-work">27 November Rules for Staff
Work</h4>
<p>Staff work is not done to advance knowledge; its only justification
is the improvement of the performance of operating people and of the
entire organization.</p>
<p>F irst, staff should concentrate on tasks of major importance that
will continue for many years. A task of major importance that will not
last forever—for example, the reorganization of a company’s
management—is better handled as a one-time assignment. Staff work should
be limited to a few tasks of high priority. Proliferation of staff
services deprives them of effectiveness. Worse, it destroys the
effectiveness of the people who produce results, the operating people.
Unless the number of staff tasks is closely controlled, staff will
gobble up more and more of operating people’s scarcest resource:
time.</p>
<p>Effective staff work requires specific goals and objectives, clear
targets, and deadlines. “We expect to cut absenteeism in half within
three years” or “Two years from now we expect to understand the
segmentation of our markets sufficiently to reduce the number of product
lines by at least one third.” Objectives like these make for productive
staff work. Vague goals such as “getting a handle on employee behavior”
or “a study of customer motivation” do not. Every three years or so, it
is important to sit down with every staff unit and ask, “What have you
contributed these last three years that makes a real difference to this
company?”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Keep support staff small and few. Establish specific
goals and deadlines for all staff work. Make sure goals are linked
directly to one or more organizational goals.</p>
<p>The Frontiers of Management</p>
<h4 id="november-rules-for-staff-people">28 November Rules for Staff
People</h4>
<p>Unless staff people have proved themselves in operations, they will
lack credibility among operating people and will be dismissed as
“theoreticians.”</p>
<p>R ules for staff people are just as important as rules for staff
work. Don’t ever put anyone into a staff job unless he or she has
successfully held a number of operating jobs, preferably in more than
one functional area. For if staff people lack operating experience, they
will be arrogant about operations, which always look so simple to the
“planner.” But today, in government even more than in business, we put
young people fresh out of business or law school into fairly senior
staff jobs as analysts or planners or staff counsel. Their arrogance and
their rejection by the operating organization practically guarantee that
they will be totally unproductive.</p>
<p>With rare exceptions, staff work should not be a person’s “career”
but only be a part of his or her career. After five to seven years on a
staff job, people ought to go back into operating work and not return to
a staff assignment for five years or so. Otherwise, they will soon
become behind-the-scene wire pullers, “gray eminences,” “kingmakers,”
“brilliant mischief-makers.”</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Rotate staff people in and out of operating work.</p>

<p>Every major decision of a great corporation affects the public
somehow, as workers, consumers, citizens; hence the public will react
consciously or subconsciously to every move the company makes. On this
reaction depends, however, the effectiveness of the company’s
decision—simply another way of saying that any corporation lives in
society. Hence the effectiveness of the executive’s decision depends not
only on his understanding the problems of his business but also on his
understanding the public attitude toward his problems. Hence the program
of public relations is to give both central-office and divisional
executives a knowledge of public attitudes and beliefs, and an

</ul>
<p>Now is the time to start middle-management weight control. One means
is attrition. As a job becomes vacant through retirement, death, or
resignation, don’t automatically fill it. Leave jobs open for six or
eight months and see what happens; unless there is an overwhelming
clamor for filling the job, then abolish it. The few companies that have
tried this report that about half the “vacancies” disappeared after six
months.</p>

<p>A second way to reduce middle-management bulk is to substitute
job-enlargement for promotion. The one and only way to provide
satisfaction and achievement for young managers and executives—and for
the even younger people working under them—is to make jobs bigger, more
challenging, more demanding, and more autonomous, while increasingly
using lateral transfers to different assignments, rather than
promotions, as a reward for outstanding performance.</p>

<p>A simple example is the emergence of knowledge as a key resource. The
event that alerted me to the fact that something was happening was the
passage of the GI Bill of Rights in the United States after the Second
World War. This law gave every returning war veteran the right to attend
college, with the government paying the bill. It was a totally
unprecedented development. These considerations led me to the question:
“What impact does this have on expectations, on values, on social
structure, on employment, and so on?” And once this question was asked—I
first asked it in the late 1940s—it became clear that knowledge as a
productive resource had attained a position in society as never before
in human history. <strong>We were clearly on the threshold of a major
change.</strong> Ten years later, by the mid-1950s, one could
confidently talk of a “knowledge society,” of “knowledge work” as the
new center of the economy, and of the “knowledge worker” as the new,
ascendant workforce.</p>

Ahead</h4>
<p>In turbulent times, the first task of management is to make sure of
the institution’s capacity to survive a blow.</p>
<p>I n turbulent times, the first task of management is to make sure of
the institution’s capacity for survival, to make sure of its structural
strengths, of its capacity to survive a blow, to adapt to sudden change,
and to avail itself of new opportunities. Turbulence, by definition, is
irregular, nonlinear, erratic. But its underlying causes can be
analyzed, predicted, managed.</p>
<p>What management should—and can—manage is the single most important
new reality underlying a great deal of the turbulence around: the
sea-change in population structure and population dynamics, and
especially the shift in population structure and population dynamics in
the developed countries of the West and Japan. These shifts are already
changing the modes of economic integration throughout the world. They
are likely to lead to a new “transnational confederation” based on
production sharing and market control, replacing in many areas the old
“multinational corporation” based on financial control. They are
creating new consumer markets and realigning existing old consumer
markets. They are drastically changing the labor force to the point
where there will only be “labor forces,” each with different
expectations and different characteristics. They will force us to
abandon altogether the concept of “fixed retirement age.” And they will
create a new demand on management—as well as a new opportunity—to make
organized plans for redundancy.</p>

your enterprise today. What steps should you take now to protect your
organization and to allow it to thrive in the midst of turbulence?</p>

Entrepreneur</h4>
<p>History moves in a spiral; one returns to the preceding position, but
on a higher level, and by a corkscrew-like path.</p>
<p>W e are again entering an era in which emphasis will be on
entrepreneurship. However, it will not be an entrepreneurship of a
century ago, that is, the ability of a single man to organize a business
he himself could run, control, embrace. It will rather be the ability to
create and direct an organization for the new. We need men and women who
can build a new structure of entrepreneurship on the managerial
foundations laid these last eighty years. History, it has often been
observed, moves in a spiral; one returns to the preceding position, or
to the preceding problem, but on a higher level, and by a corkscrew-like
path. In this fashion we are going to return to entrepreneurship on a
path that led out from a lower level, that of the single entrepreneur,
to the manager, and now back, though upward, to entrepreneurship again.
The businessperson will have to acquire a number of new abilities, all
of them entrepreneurial in nature, but all of them to be exercised in
and through a managerial organization.</p>

<h4 id="december-information-on-cost-and-value">4 December Information
on Cost and Value</h4>
<p>We cannot achieve results until we have information on cost and
value.</p>
<p>B asic structural information is focused upon the value that is
created for customers and the resources used to do so. The concepts and
tools of accounting are now in the throes of its most fundamental
change. The new accounting tools are not just different views of
recording transactions but represent different concepts of what business
is and what results are. So even the executive far removed from any work
in accounting, such as a research manager in a development laboratory,
needs to understand the basic theory and concepts represented by these
changes in accounting. These new concepts and tools include:
activity-based costing, price-led costing, economic-chain costing,
economic value added, and benchmarking.</p>
<p>Activity-based costing reports all the costs of a product or service
until the customer actually buys the product, and provides the
foundation for integrating cost and value into one analysis.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Pick up a book on Activity-Based Costing and become
proficient with the strategic, conceptual, and procedural issues of this
accounting concept.</p>

<h4 id="december-price-led-costing">5 December Price-Led Costing</h4>
<p>The problem is not with technology. It is with mentality.</p>
<p>T raditionally, Western companies have started with costs, put a
desired profit margin on top, and arrived at a price. This is cost-led
pricing. In price-led costing, the price the customer is willing to pay
determines allowable costs, beginning with design costs and ending with
service costs. Marketing provides information on the price the customer
is willing to pay for the value the product or service provides.</p>
<p>A cross-functional team starts its analysis of costs by taking this
price as a given. The team then subtracts the profit required to
compensate the enterprise for capital investment and risk, and arrives
at an allowable cost for a product or service. Then it proceeds to make
the tradeoffs between the utility provided by a product and allowable
costs. Under price-led costing, the entire economic framework focuses
upon creating value for the customer and meeting cost targets while
earning the necessary rate of return on investment.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Examine the cost-and-pricing procedures used in your
organization. Are they cost-led pricing or price-led costing? Focus on
creating value for your customer and implement price-led costing.</p>

<h4 id="december-activity-costing">6 December Activity Costing</h4>
<p>Activity-based costing is a totally different way of thinking.</p>
<p>T raditional costing techniques are now rapidly being replaced by
activity-based cost accounting. Traditional costing builds cost from the
bottom up—labor, material, and overhead. It concentrates primarily on
manufacturing-related costs, the so-called inventoriable costs.
Activity-based costing starts from the end and asks, “Which activities
and related costs are used in carrying out the complete value chain of
activities associated with the cost object?” Activity-based costing
includes the cost of quality and service.</p>
<p>By designing quality into products and services during the design
stage, design costs may increase, but warranty and service costs are
likely to decrease, thus overcoming any cost increase experienced at the
front-end of the chain. And unlike traditional costing, it includes all
costs of producing a product or service.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Activity-based costing is a totally different way of
thinking, especially for accountants whose financial reports do not
require activity costs. Tackle this issue with your accounting
staff.</p>

Obstacles to Economic-Chain Costing</h4>
<p>Switching to economic-chain costing requires uniform accounting
systems along the entire chain.</p>
<p>T he real cost is the cost of an entire process, in which even the
biggest company is just one link. Companies are therefore beginning to
shift costing from including only what goes on inside their own
organization to costing the entire economic process, the economic chain.
There are obstacles in implementing economic-chain costing. For many
businesses it will be painful to switch to economic-chain costing. Doing
so requires uniform or at least compatible accounting systems of all
businesses along the entire chain. Yet each one does its accounting in
its own way, and each is convinced that its system is the only possible
one. Moreover, economic-chain costing requires information sharing
across companies; yet even within the same company, people tend to
resist information sharing. Whatever the obstacles, economic-chain
costing is going to be done. Otherwise, even the most efficient company
will suffer from an increasing cost disadvantage.</p>
<p>ACTION POINT: Identify the obstacles to implementing economic-chain
costing, overcome them, and implement economic-chain costing in your
organization.</p>
