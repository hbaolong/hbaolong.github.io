<h4 id="story-notes">Story Notes</h4>
<p>“Tower of Babylon”</p>
<p>This story was inspired by a conversation with a friend, when he
mentioned the version of the Tower of Babel myth he’d been taught in
Hebrew school. At that point I knew only the Old Testament account, and
it hadn’t made a big impression on me. But in the more elaborate
version, the tower is so tall that it takes a year to climb, and when a
man falls to his death, no one mourns, but when a brick is dropped, the
bricklayers weep because it will take a year to replace.</p>
<p>The original legend is about the consequences of defying God. For me,
however, the tale conjured up images of a fantastic city in the sky,
reminiscent of Magritte’s Castle in the Pyrenees. I was captivated by
the audacity of such a vision, and started wondering what life in such a
city would be like.</p>
<p>Tom Disch called this story “Babylonian science fiction.” I hadn’t
thought about it that way when I was writing it—the Babylonians
certainly knew enough physics and astronomy to recognize this story as
fanciful—but I understood what he meant. The characters may be
religious, but they rely on engineering rather than prayer. No deity
makes an appearance in the story; everything that happens can be
understood in purely mechanistic terms. It’s in that sense that—despite
the obvious difference in cosmology—the universe in the story resembles
our own.</p>
<p>“Understand”</p>
<p>This is the oldest story in this volume, and might never have been
published if it weren’t for Spider Robinson, one of my instructors at
Clarion. This story had collected a bunch of rejection slips when I
first sent it out, but Spider encouraged me to resubmit it after I had
Clarion on my resume. I made some revisions and sent it out, and it got
a much better response the second time around.</p>
<p>The initial germ for this story was an offhand remark made by a
roommate of mine in college; he was reading Sartre’s Nausea at the time,
whose protagonist finds only meaninglessness in everything he sees. But
what would it be like, my roommate wondered, to find meaning and order
in everything you saw? To me that suggested a kind of heightened
perception, which in turn suggested superintelligence. I started
thinking about the point at which quantitative improvements—better
memory, faster pattern recognition—turn into a qualitative difference, a
fundamentally different mode of cognition.</p>
<p>Something else I wondered about was the possibility of truly
understanding how our minds works. Some people are certain that it’s
impossible for us to understand our minds, offering analogies like “you
can’t see your face with your own eyes.” I never found that persuasive.
It may turn out that we can’t, in fact, understand our minds (for
certain values of “understand” and “mind“), but it’ll take an argument
much more persuasive than that to convince me.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“Division by Zero”</p>
<p>There’s a famous equation that looks like this:</p>
<p>eiπ + 1 = 0</p>
<p>When I first saw the derivation of this equation, my jaw dropped in
amazement. Let me try to explain why.</p>
<p>One of the things we admire most in fiction is an ending that is
surprising, yet inevitable. This is also what characterizes elegance in
design: the invention that’s clever yet seems totally natural. Of course
we know that they aren’t really inevitable; it’s human ingenuity that
makes them seem that way, temporarily.</p>
<p>Now consider the equation mentioned above. It’s definitely
surprising; you could work with the numbers e and i for years, each in a
dozen different contexts, without realizing they intersected in this
particular way. Yet once you’ve seen the derivation, you feel that this
equation really is inevitable, that this is the only way things could
be. It’s a feeling of awe, as if you’ve come into contact with absolute
truth.</p>
<p>A proof that mathematics is inconsistent, and that all its wondrous
beauty was just an illusion, would, it seemed to me, be one of the worst
things you could ever learn.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“Story of Your Life”</p>
<p>This story grew out of my interest in the variational principles of
physics. I’ve found these principles fascinating ever since I first
learned of them, but I didn’t know how to use them in a story until I
saw a performance of Time Flies When You’re Alive, Paul Linke’s one-man
show about his wife’s battle with breast cancer. It occurred to me then
that I might be able to use variational principles to tell a story about
a person’s response to the inevitable. A few years later, that notion
combined with a friend’s remark about her newborn baby to form the
nucleus of this story.</p>
<p>For those interested in physics, I should note that the story’s
discussion of Fermat’s Principle of Least Time omits all mention of its
quantum-mechanical underpinnings. The QM formulation is interesting in
its own way, but I preferred the metaphoric possibilities of the
classical version.</p>
<p>As for this story’s theme, probably the most concise summation of it
that I’ve seen appears in Kurt Vonnegut’s introduction to the 25th
anniversary edition of Slaughterhouse-Five: “Stephen Hawking … found it
tantalizing that we could not remember the future. But remembering the
future is child’s play for me now. I know what will become of my
helpless, trusting babies because they are grown-ups now. I know how my
closest friends will end up because so many of them are retired or dead
now … To Stephen Hawking and all others younger than myself I say, ‘Be
patient. Your future will come to you and lie down at your feet like a
dog who knows and loves you no matter what you are.’”</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“Seventy-Two Letters”</p>
<p>This story came about when I noticed a connection between two ideas
I’d previously thought were unrelated. The first one was the golem.</p>
<p>In what’s probably the best known story of the golem, Rabbi Loew of
Prague brings a clay statue to life to act as a defender of the Jews,
protecting them from persecution. It turns out this story is a modern
invention, dating back only to 1909. Stories in which the golem is used
as a servant to perform chores—with varying degrees of
success—originated in the 1500s, but they still aren’t the oldest
references to the golem. In stories dating back to the second century,
rabbis would animate golems not to accomplish anything practical, but
rather to demonstrate mastery of the art of permutating letters; they
sought to know God better by performing acts of creation.</p>
<p>The whole theme of the creative power of language has been discussed
elsewhere, by people smarter than me. What I found particularly
interesting about golems was the fact that they’re traditionally unable
to speak. Since the golem is created through language, this limitation
is also a limitation on reproduction. If a golem were able to use
language, it would be capable of self-replication, rather like a Von
Neumann machine.</p>
<p>The other idea I’d been thinking about was preformation, the theory
that organisms exist fully formed in the germ cells of their parents.
It’s easy for people now to dismiss it as ridiculous, but at the time,
preformation made a lot of sense. It was an attempt to solve the problem
of how living organisms are able to replicate themselves, which is the
same problem that later inspired Von Neumann machines. When I recognized
that, it seemed that I was interested in these two ideas for the same
reason, and I knew I had to write about them.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“The Evolution of Human Science”</p>
<p>This short-short was written for the British science journal Nature.
Throughout the year 2000, Nature ran a feature called “Futures“; each
week a different writer provided a short fictional treatment of a
scientific development occurring in the next millenium.</p>
<p>Since the piece would appear in a scientific journal, making it about
a scientific journal seemed like a natural choice. I started wondering
about what such a journal might look like after the advent of superhuman
intelligence. William Gibson once said, “The future is already here;
it’s just not evenly distributed.” Right now there are people in the
world who, if they’re aware of the computer revolution at all, know of
it only as something happening to other people, somewhere else. I expect
that will remain true no matter what technological revolutions await
us.</p>
<p>(A note about the title: this short-short originally appeared under a
title chosen by the editors of Nature; I’ve chosen to restore its
original title for this reprint.)</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“Hell is the Absence of God”</p>
<p>I first wanted to write a story about angels after seeing the movie
The Prophecy, a supernatural thriller written and directed by Gregory
Widen. For a long time I tried to think of a story in which angels were
characters, but couldn’t come up with a scenario I liked; it was only
when I started thinking about angels as phenomena of terrifying power,
whose visitations resembled natural disasters, that I was able to move
forward. (Perhaps I was subconsciously thinking of Annie Dillard. Later
on I remembered she once wrote that if people had more belief, they’d
wear crash helmets when attending church, and lash themselves to the
pews.)</p>
<p>Thinking about natural disasters led to thinking about the problem of
innocent suffering. An enormous range of advice has been offered from a
religious perspective to those who suffer, and it seems clear that no
single response can satisfy everyone; what comforts one person
inevitably strikes someone else as outrageous. Consider the Book of Job
as an example.</p>
<p>For me, one of the unsatisfying things about the Book of Job is that,
in the end, God rewards Job. Leave aside the question of whether new
children can compensate for the loss of his original ones. Why does God
restore Job’s fortunes at all? Why the happy ending? One of the basic
messages of the book is that virtue isn’t always rewarded; bad things
happen to good people. Job ultimately accepts this, demonstrating
virtue, and is subsequently rewarded. Doesn’t this undercut the
message?</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Book of Job lacks the courage of its
convictions: if the author were really committed to the idea that virtue
isn’t always rewarded, shouldn’t the book have ended with Job still
bereft of everything?</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>“Liking What You See: A Documentary”</p>
<p>Psychologists once conducted an experiment where they repeatedly left
a fake college application in an airport, supposedly forgotten by a
traveler. The answers on the application were always the same, but each
time they included a different photo of the fictitious applicant. It
turned out people were more likely to mail in the application if the
applicant was attractive. This is perhaps not surprising, but it
illustrates just how thoroughly we’re influenced by appearances; we
favor attractive people even in a situation where we’ll never meet
them.</p>
<p>Yet any discussion of beauty’s advantages is usually accompanied by a
mention of the burden of beauty. I don’t doubt that beauty has its
drawbacks, but so does everything else. Why do people seem more
sympathetic to the idea of burdensome beauty than to, say, the idea of
burdensome wealth? It’s because beauty is working its magic again: even
in a discussion of its drawbacks, beauty is providing its possessors
with an advantage.</p>
<p>I expect physical beauty will be around for as long as we have bodies
and eyes. But if calliagnosia ever becomes available, I for one will
give it a try.</p>
