<h4 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h4>
<p>Ted Chiang was born in Port Jefferson, New York and holds a degree in
computer science from Brown University. In 1989 he attended the Clarion
Writers Workshop. His fiction has won three Hugos, four Nebulas, three
Locus awards, and a Sturgeon award. He lives near Seattle,
Washington.</p>
<p>Praise for Ted Chiang’s stories:</p>
<p>“Meticulously pieced together, utterly thought through, Chiang’s
stories emerge slowly … but with the perfection of slow-growing
crystal.”</p>
<p>—Lev Grossman, Best of the Decade: Science Fiction and Fantasy,
Techland.com</p>
<p>“In Chiang’s hands, SF really is the ‘literature of ideas’ it is
often held to be, and the genre’s traditional “sense of wonder” is
paramount. But though one reads Stories of Your Life with a kind of
thematic nostalgia for classic philosophical SF such as that of Asimov
and Theodore Sturgeon, the collection never feels dated. Partly this is
because the “wonder” of these stories is a modern, melancholy
transcendence, not the naive ’50s dreams of the genre’s golden age. More
important, the collection is united by a humane intelligence that speaks
very directly to the reader, and makes us experience each story with
immediacy and Chiang’s calm passion.”</p>
<p>—China Mieville, The Guardian</p>
<p>“Ted is a national treasure … each of those stories is a goddamned
jewel.”</p>
<p>—Cory Doctorow, BoingBoing</p>
<p>“Chiang’s work confirms that blending science and fine art at this
length can produce touching works, tales as intimate as our own blood
cells, with the structural strength of just-discovered industrial
alloys.”</p>
<p>—The Seattle Times</p>
<p>“Summarizing these stories does not do justice to Chiang’s talent.
Seemingly ordinary ideas are pursued ruthlessly, their tendons flayed,
their bones exposed. Chiang derides lazy thinking, weasels it out of its
hiding place, and leaves it cowering.”</p>
<p>—The Washington Post</p>
<p>“Chiang is one of those authors who prove the power of science
fiction by looking at things in totally new ways.”</p>
<p>—The Denver Post</p>
<p>“Abounds with examples of why Ted Chiang’s stories have continued to
be award winners. From “Understand“, which both plays homage to and
expands upon Daniel Keyes’ classic “Flowers For Algernon” to “Story of
Your Life,” in which a linguist confronts the relationship between
language and reality, it will not take readers new to these stories very
long to appreciate their quality and beauty. Science fiction has always
depended on writers who work best at shorter lengths to continue to
examine new ideas and push the boundaries of the field. In the decade
plus a few years since he first started publishing, Ted Chiang has shown
himself to be more than up to that task.”</p>
<p>—SF Site</p>
<p>“Reading a Chiang story means juggling multiple conceptions of what
is normal and right. Probably this kind of brain twisting can be done
with such intensity only in shorter lengths; if these stories were much
longer, readers’ heads might explode…. They resemble the work of a less
metaphysical Philip K. Dick or a Borges with more characterization and a
grasp of cutting-edge science.”</p>
<p>—Publishers Weekly</p>
<p>“Brilliantly conceived and emotionally moving.”</p>
<p>—Infinity Plus</p>
<p>“A quirky, inventive and morally sober collection … Discovering
Chiang is one of those pleasures reserved for those of us not snobbish
about genre SF. He is an important short-story writer.”</p>
<p>—Roz Kaveney, Time Out London</p>
<p>“Absolutely mind-blowing and stunningly creative—Ted Chiang is the
future of science fiction!”</p>
<p>—Jamie M., Powells.com Staff Pick</p>
<p>“This marvelous collection by one of science fiction’s most
thoughtful and graceful writers belongs on the bookshelf of anyone
interested in literary science fiction … Chiang has the gift that lies
at the heart of good science fiction: a human story, beautifully told,
in which the science is an expression of the deeper issues that the
characters must confront.”</p>
<p>—Amazon.com</p>
<p>“The level of ideas and concepts at work are nothing short of
breathtaking.”</p>
<p>—SF</p>
<p>X“Essential. You won’t know SF if you don’t read Ted Chiang.”</p>
<p>—Greg Bear</p>
<p>“Can he be the best SF writer to come down the pike in the past
thirty years? I honestly believe that he is.”</p>
<p>—Harry Harrison</p>
<p>“[Chiang] is a master of prose as a precise instrument, or rather a
well-stocked toolbox of instruments, subtly choosing and coolly crafting
the right style not just to convey the particular content but to suit
the particular form.”</p>
<p>—Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine</p>
<p>“It has often been said that the short story is the heart of sf. On
the evidence of Chiang’s first collection, the genre heart is beating
strongly and in a very healthy state indeed.”</p>
<p>—Vector</p>
<p>“The qualities for which Ted Chiang is well-known—conceptual
originality and dazzling clarify, for starters—are on show
throughout.”</p>
<p>—Foundation</p>
<p>“Sheer originality … a remarkable collection. Every story amply
repays the investment put into reading it.”</p>
<p>—Interzone</p>
<p>“Chiang is a consummate stylist, and these lyrical tales aren’t just
great SF; they’re great literature.”</p>
<p>—The Globe and Mail</p>
<p>“Ted Chiang’s collection is probably—without exaggeration—the most
anticipated short story collection of its generation.”</p>
<p>—The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</p>
