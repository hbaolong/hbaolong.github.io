<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<p>By Will HuttonLinda Holbeche</p>
<p>PETER FERDINAND DRUCKER – IDEAS, IMPACT AND LEGACY</p>
<p>Peter Drucker is one of the greats. His sustained creativity over
nearly fifty years of reflection on management, organization and the
wider economy and society is almost unmatched. There is scarcely a
contemporary idea—whether the idea of the voluntary knowledge worker to
the importance of management itself—that was not prefigured in his
writing. Sometimes his enthusiasm ran away with him (we are not
strangers to that ourselves): it is not obvious that knowledge, for
example, is quite so short lived as he once declared (redundant in ten
minutes) and the belief that all the world’s problems can be reduced to
managerial solutions is surely overdoing it. But his overall legacy is
so outstanding that you have to pay homage—and acknowledge the extent of
one’s own personal debt.</p>
<p>He was the Enlightenment thinker par excellence. Drucker’s breadth of
vision is reflected in his many fields of inquiry: international law,
history, organizations, politics, ethics, aesthetics and the human
condition. His wide range of publications reflected his belief that
management is central to life, not just to business. He was a true
Renaissance man.</p>
<p>His prolific written output included three-dozen books (fifteen on
management) and hundreds of articles, carrying on writing into his 90s.
He launched his reputation as a management guru with The Practice of
Management (1954) which he reinforced by Managing for Results (1964),
both hugely influential texts. His writings divide almost equally
between management theory and technique and works of economic, political
and social analysis, such as The Age of Discontinuity (1969) which
pointed to the decline of Britain’s manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The free spirit</p>
<p>Drucker refused to play the academic game, declining to publish in
obscure journals. He was one of the first thinkers to write for
management audiences, translating theory into practice. He pioneered
courses on leadership in the 1950s and coined the term “followership”.
He argued that leaders should spend less time asking “what do I want?”
than “what is needed?” He also stated: “you cannot manage other people
unless you have learned to manage yourself”.</p>
<p>Consequently he was accused by academia of being a wilful generalist
and was never offered major roles in prestigious business schools or
universities. Instead he preferred to work for smaller universities less
hide-bound by academic dogma. Indeed, though he was Clarke Professor of
Social Science and Management at the independent Claremont Graduate
University his critique of much business school education would do
little to endear him to academic colleagues. He argued (in 2001) that
most management education, even at Claremont, is basically the same as
65 years ago and that what is needed is a rethink of the curriculum so
that students can relate themselves more fully to the universe of
knowledge such as psychology, economics etc. and that social skills in
particular are missing. He stated “we do a very poor job of teaching
writing, speaking and listening, the communication tools on which all
effectiveness in an organization depends” (BizEd, Nov/Dec 2001).</p>
<p>Major universities and funding bodies still have much to learn from
Drucker’s broader definition of what constitutes knowledge, especially
that which can be translated into valuable practice.</p>
<p>His scepticism about the role of business schools was reflected in
many of his later predictions about how work would develop. The heart of
business success would increasingly be via creativity and innovation,
and it was wrong to suggest that the right approach could be codified in
any business school course; thus the context for the slightly outlandish
claim that knowledge makes itself obsolete every ten minutes. Creativity
is always a response to the challenge of a particular circumstance—and
requires a degree of personal responsibility and willingness to
experiment. Too many business school graduates took refuge in the notion
of a predictable career delivered by the practice of acquired and never
changing competences and skills. That was organizational death. Rather
every manager had to possess an entrepreneurial understanding; the trick
of the leader was to find ways of inculcating such a culture and
motivating managers to flower within it—even when there might not be
immediate promotion opportunities.</p>
<p>The thought leader</p>
<p>Many of Drucker’s books have become classics of management
literature. Where Drucker led, others followed. The Age of Discontinuity
prefigured later books in the 1980s and 1990s on managing chaos and
disruptive change, anticipating in particular works by Handy (The Age of
Unreason), Pascale, Peters, Naisbitt (Megatrends) and others.</p>
<p>Throughout his management writing, Drucker’s emphasis was on the
effectiveness of managers—particularly in making good use of their human
resources—as the key to a productive and profitable organization. His
five basic principles of management have stood the test of time:</p>
<p>• Setting objectives (set out in Management: Tasks, Responsibilities,
Practices (1973)) which defines every aspect of managerial skills and is
regarded as a DIY business school course.</p>
<p>• Organizing.</p>
<p>• Motivating and communicating (though he has sometimes been
criticized for neglecting theories of motivation).</p>
<p>• Establishing measurements of performance.</p>
<p>• Developing people, including self.</p>
<p>He created some of the leading management theories of the 20th
century, including:</p>
<p>• Management by objectives (and by self-control). MBO emerged out of
Drucker’s work as consultant with General Electric and was later
developed further by Humble.</p>
<p>• Putting the customer first and ‘Stick to the knitting’ (later taken
up by Tom Peters).</p>
<p>• The role of the chief executive in corporate strategy.</p>
<p>• Structure follows strategy (Hammer and Champy’s approach to
re-engineering owes its roots to early work by Drucker).</p>
<p>Similarly, he identified 7 key elements of post-war management
development which continue to influence thinking and practice in
organizations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Scientific management of work as the key to
productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Decentralization as a basic principle of organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel management as the orderly way of fitting people into
organization structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Manager development to provide for the needs of
tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Managerial accounting—use of analysis and information as the
foundation for firm decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-range planning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>He challenged conventional wisdom. One of the key ideas throughout
his writing is not to make assumptions about technology or markets, but
to “look at the world upside down” and “build organized abandonment into
your system”.</p>
<p>The soothsayer</p>
<p>Drucker’s ability to foresee and interpret trends was legendary. He
had remarkable prescience, anticipating by decades some of the major
changes in world economics and the impact of technology on the
workplace. In The Age of Discontinuity (1969) for instance he introduced
the concepts of the coming information economy and the “knowledge
worker”. We are both directors of The Work Foundation where we continue
to build on Drucker’s ideas in our multi-phased research into the nature
and effects of the Knowledge Economy.</p>
<p>His book The New Realities (1989) anticipated global changes
including the development of the transnational economy, the
democratization of the Soviet Republics, the changing ethos of the US
and the demands of the post-industrial, post-business society. He
believed that the imperative for growth inevitably pushes organizations
beyond their national borders in search of new markets and that the
world becomes interconnected by a series of cross-cutting trade
relationships in which the interests of managers outweigh the interests
of politicians.</p>
<p>In Post-Capitalist Society (1992) he examined the division of society
into knowledge and service workers and the economic and social
challenges involved. He recognized that workers would need to master
self-management, a discipline which he considered to be both challenging
and little researched. In his later writings he recognized the growing
power of pension funds and the narrow focus of other institutional
investors in late twentieth century capitalism.</p>
<p>Similarly, he recognized that (re-)privatization was likely to be a
feature of developed economies as the public becomes disillusioned with
governments’ inability to produce miracles. He advocated privatization
of all institutions, including universities, on the grounds that the
role of government was to govern, not to “do” and that the two roles
were incompatible. The insight was valuable, but limited; there remains
a quality of “publicness” about institutions that deliver public
services that has to be retained, even while they need more autonomy,
freedom and capacity to devise their own creative responsiveness to
citizen users demands rather than carry out centralized diktats and
targets. Simple privatization was and is never enough. At The Work
Foundation we are developing a programme investigating public value that
aims to combine Drucker’s insistence that public sector organizations
need to be more decentralized and have more autonomy with their ongoing
need to create public value. Drucker, we hope, would have approved.</p>
<p>Many of Drucker’s later writings were about the lessons to be learnt
from the way voluntary bodies are run. Another of his later concerns was
about what society should do about the fact that people are living
longer and retiring earlier. In other words, in the post-industrial
economy we are still treating retirement like we did in the mid-20th
century, resulting in bored, underutilized talented people who want to
still be active in their 70s and resentful younger workers whose taxes
support them. One answer, he argued, is to get away from a
promotion-oriented career to one where lifelong opportunities to develop
personal interests and skills are an important aspect of reward.</p>
<p>The importance of purpose</p>
<p>But perhaps some of the most profound and perspicacious of his ideas
relate to the purpose of work itself. To Drucker, the business
organization should be “a human, a social, indeed a moral phenomenon”;
that customer service rather than profit should dominate management
thinking and that profit should be invested in ongoing innovation and
improvement. In People and Performance (1973) he defined his view of
management as “to fulfil the specific purpose and mission of the
organization; to make work productive and the worker achieving; and to
manage social impacts and social responsibility”.</p>
<p>He argued that, as power in the workplace shifted from bosses to
knowledge workers, they effectively become volunteers, who join and stay
with the organization because they believe in what the organization
stands for; therefore it is of critical importance to articulate and
maintain a strong sense of purpose that keeps them there.</p>
<p>As a visionary and profound humanitarian, he advocated organizational
approaches which help people to grow, organizations to flourish and work
made more rewarding. There is no higher purpose. Indeed, it is Peter
Drucker’s influence and vision which has helped shape the purpose and
mission of The Work Foundation which is to inspire “good work for all”
in the twenty-first century. It is an inspirational legacy.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>This book grew out of a suggestion by my long-time American editor,
Cass Canfield, Jr., of HarperCollins. It is, however, a very different
book from the one Mr. Canfield and I originally envisaged. We thought of
a book that would bring together in one volume the best from the
management books I have written and published for more than fifty
years—a kind of “Drucker Retrospective.” But as I began to work on the
book Mr. Canfield suggested, it became increasingly clear to both of us
that what was appropriate was not a book looking backward. It was one
that looks AHEAD. As a result, this book contains NOTHING that is an
excerpt from earlier management books of mine. It supplements them by
LOOKING AHEAD. And all the time, while working on this book, I have
had—as I have had for many, many years—the benefit of Mr. Canfield’s
advice, suggestions, comments—they have greatly improved this book.</p>
<p>But this book also celebrates SIXTY years of close association with
my UK publisher, Butterworth-Heinemann. Since the firm—then Wm.
Heinemann—published my first book, The End of Economic Man, in 1939, I
have had no other publisher in the UK and in the countries of the
Commonwealth. It is an association I greatly treasure. I am delighted
that this book of mine will again appear under the Heinemann
imprint.</p>
<p>As readers see in Chapter Three, I preach piloting the new, that is,
testing it on a small scale. And, for once, I practice what I preach. I
pilot-test a new book. One way is to distribute early drafts and copies
to a few friends—mostly longtime clients—and ask for their candid
reaction. Again and again I have changed something, rewritten a section,
clarified an issue, as a result of their comments and criticism. But the
best pilot-test for my writings, I have found, is to prepublish sections
of a forthcoming book in magazines. This does TWO things. I get
reactions from readers—and they tell me both what might need changing
and where I need to explain or clarify. I owe a great debt to the
people—mostly strangers—who write in, comment on or criticize one of
these prepublished pieces, and especially to those who—often
loudly—dissent. My thanks to them all. But, above all, prepublishing in
a magazine gives me the inestimable benefit of being EDITED. I cannot
even begin to do justice to what I owe the editors of these
magazines—for their questions, their guidance, their cutting,
rephrasing, repositioning. Especially thanks are due to Jim Michaels and
Rich Karlgaard of Forbes magazine (which prepublished sections of
Chapter One and the first part of Chapter Four), to Gunders Strads of
the California Management Review (which prepublished an abridged version
of Chapter Five), and to Nan Stone of the Harvard Business Review (which
prepublished sections of Chapter Four and Chapter Six). They greatly
helped to make this a better book.</p>
<p>Introduction: Tomorrow’s “Hot” Issues</p>
<p>Where, readers may ask, is the discussion of COMPETITIVE STRATEGY, of
LEADERSHIP, of CREATIVITY, of TEAMWORK, of TECHNOLOGY in a book on
MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES? Where are the “HOT” ISSUES OF TODAY? But this is
the very reason why they are not in this book. It deals exclusively with
TOMORROW’S “Hot” Issues—the crucial, central, life-and-death issues that
are certain to be the major challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>CERTAIN? Yes. For this is not a book of PREDICTIONS, not a book about
the FUTURE. The challenges and issues discussed in it are already with
us in every one of the developed countries and in most of the emerging
ones (e.g., Korea or Turkey). They can already be identified, discussed,
analyzed and prescribed for. Some people, someplace, are already working
on them. But so far very few organizations do, and very few executives.
Those who do work on these challenges today, and thus prepare themselves
and their institutions for the new challenges, will be the leaders and
dominate tomorrow. Those who wait until these challenges have indeed
become “hot” issues are likely to fall behind, perhaps never to
recover.</p>
<p>This book is thus a Call for Action.</p>
<p>These challenges are not arising out of today. THEY ARE DIFFERENT. In
most cases they are at odds and incompatible with what is accepted and
successful today. We live in a period of PROFOUND TRANSITION—and the
changes are more radical perhaps than even those that ushered in the
“Second Industrial Revolution” of the middle of the 19th century, or the
structural changes triggered by the Great Depression and the Second
World War. READING this book will upset and disturb a good many people,
as WRITING it disturbed me. For in many cases—for example, in the
challenges inherent in the DISAPPEARING BIRTHRATE in the developed
countries, or in the challenges to the individual, and to the employing
organization, discussed in the final chapter on MANAGING ONESELF—the new
realities and their demands require a REVERSAL of policies that have
worked well for the last century and, even more, a change in the MINDSET
of organizations as well as of individuals.</p>
<p>This is a MANAGEMENT BOOK. It intentionally leaves out BUSINESS
CHALLENGES—even very important ones such as the question of whether the
EURO will displace the U.S. dollar as the world’s key currency, or what
will SUCCEED the 19th century’s most successful economic inventions, the
commercial bank and the investment bank. It intentionally does not
concern itself with ECONOMICS—even though the basic MANAGEMENT changes
(e.g., the emergence of knowledge as the economy’s key resource) will
certainly necessitate radically new economic theory and equally
radically new economic policy. The book does not concern itself with
politics—not even with such crucial questions as whether Russia can and
will recover as a political, military and economic power. It sticks with
MANAGEMENT ISSUES. There are good reasons for this. The issues this book
discusses, the new social, demographic and economic REALITIES, are not
issues that GOVERNMENT can successfully deal with. They are issues that
will have profound impact on politics; but they are not political
issues. They are not issues the Free Market can deal with. They are also
not issues of ECONOMIC THEORY or even of ECONOMIC POLICY. They are
issues that only MANAGEMENT and the INDIVIDUAL knowledge worker,
professional or executive can tackle and resolve. They are surely going
to be debated in the domestic politics of every developed and every
emerging country. But their resolution will have to take place within
the individual organization and will have to be worked out by the
individual organization’s MANAGEMENT—and by every single individual
knowledge worker (and especially by every single executive) within the
organization.</p>
<p>A great many of these organizations will, of course, be businesses.
And a great many of the individual knowledge workers affected by these
challenges will be employees of business or working with business. Yet
this is a MANAGEMENT book rather than a BUSINESS management book. The
challenges it presents affect ALL organizations of today’s society. In
fact, some of them will affect nonbusinesses even more, if only because
a good many nonbusiness organizations—the university, for instance, or
the hospital, let alone the government agency—are more rigid and less
flexible than businesses are, and far more deeply rooted in the
concepts, the assumptions, the policies of yesterday or even, as are
universities, in the assumptions of the day before yesterday (i.e., of
the 19th century).</p>
<p>How to use the book? I suggest you read a chapter at a time—they are
long chapters. And then first ask: “What do these issues, these
challenges MEAN for our organization and for me as a knowledge worker, a
professional, an executive?” Once you have thought this through, ask:
“What ACTION should our organization and I, the individual knowledge
worker and/or executive, take to make the challenges of this chapter
into OPPORTUNITIES for our organization and me?”</p>
<p>AND THEN GO TO WORK!</p>

<h4 id="chapter-1-managements-new-paradigms">CHAPTER 1 Management’s New
Paradigms</h4>
<p>Why Assumptions Matter •Management Is Business Management •The One
Right Organization •The One Right Way to Manage People •Technologies and
End-Users Are Fixed and Given •Management’s Scope Is Legally Defined
•Management’s Scope Is Politically Defined •The Inside Is Management’s
Domain</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Why Assumptions Matter</p>
<p>BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT REALITY are the PARADIGMS of a social
science, such as management. They are usually held subconsciously by the
scholars, the writers, the teachers, the practitioners in the field. Yet
those assumptions largely determine what the discipline—scholars,
writers, teachers, practitioners—assumes to be REALITY.</p>
<p>The discipline’s basic assumptions about reality determine what it
focuses on. They determine what a discipline considers “facts,” and
indeed what it considers the discipline itself to be all about. The
assumptions also largely determine what is being disregarded in a
discipline or is being pushed aside as an “annoying exception.” They
decide both what in a given discipline is being paid attention to and
what is neglected or ignored.</p>
<p>A good example is what happened to the most insightful of the earlier
management scholars: Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933).* Because her
assumptions did not fit the realities which the budding discipline of
management assumed in the 1930s and 1940s, she became a “nonperson” even
before her death in 1932, with her work practically forgotten for
twenty-five years or more. And yet we now know that her basic
assumptions regarding society, people and management were far closer to
reality than those on which the management people then based
themselves—and still largely base themselves today.</p>
<p>Yet, despite their importance, the assumptions are rarely analyzed,
rarely studied, rarely challenged—indeed rarely even made explicit.</p>
<p>For a social discipline such as management the assumptions are
actually a good deal more important than are the paradigms for a natural
science. The paradigm—that is, the prevailing general theory—has no
impact on the natural universe. Whether the paradigm states that the sun
rotates around the earth or that, on the contrary, the earth rotates
around the sun has no effect on sun and earth. A natural science deals
with the behavior of OBJECTS. But a social discipline such as management
deals with the behavior of PEOPLE and HUMAN INSTITUTIONS. Practitioners
will therefore tend to act and to behave as the discipline’s assumptions
tell them to. Even more important, the reality of a natural science, the
physical universe and its laws, do not change (or if they do only over
eons rather than over centuries, let alone over decades). The social
universe has no “natural laws” of this kind. It is thus subject to
continuous change. And this means that assumptions that were valid
yesterday can become invalid and, indeed, totally misleading in no time
at all.</p>
<p>Everyone these days preaches the team as the “right” organization for
every task. (I myself began to preach teams as early as 1954 and
especially in my 1973 book Management: Tasks, Responsibilities,
Practices.) Underlying the present orthodoxy regarding teams is a basic
assumption held practically by all management theorists and by most
practitioners since the earliest days of thinking about organization,
that is, since Henri Fayol in France and Walter Rathenau in Germany
around 1900: There is—or, at least, there MUST be—ONE right
organization. And what matters most is not whether the team is indeed
“the answer” (so far there is not too much evidence for it), but, as
will be discussed a little later, that the basic assumption of the one
right organization is no longer tenable.</p>
<p>What matters most in a social discipline such as management are
therefore the basic assumptions. And a CHANGE in the basic assumptions
matters even more.</p>
<p>Since the study of management first began—and it truly did not emerge
until the 1930s—TWO SETS of assumptions regarding the REALITIES of
management have been held by most scholars, most writers and most
practitioners:</p>
<p>One set of assumptions underlies the DISCIPLINE of management:</p>
<p>1 Management is Business Management.</p>
<p>2 There is—or there must be—ONE right organization structure.</p>
<p>3 There is—or there must be—ONE right way to manage people.</p>
<p>Another set of assumptions underlies the PRACTICE of Management:</p>
<p>1 Technologies, markets and end-uses are given.</p>
<p>2 Management’s scope is legally defined.</p>
<p>3 Management is internally focused.</p>
<p>4 The economy as defined by national boundaries is the “ecology” of
enterprise and management.</p>
<p>For most of this period—at least until the early 1980s—all but the
first of these assumptions were close enough to reality to be
operational, whether for research, for writing, for teaching or for
practicing management. By now all of them have out-lived their
usefulness. They are close to being caricatures. They are now so far
removed from actual reality that they are becoming obstacles to the
Theory and even more serious obstacles to the Practice of management.
Indeed, reality is fast becoming the very opposite of what these
assumptions claim it to be. It is high time therefore to think through
these assumptions and to try to formulate the NEW ASSUMPTIONS that now
have to inform both the study and the practice of management.</p>
<p>I Management Is Business Management</p>
<p>For most people, inside and outside management, this assumption is
taken as self-evident. Indeed management writers, management
practitioners and the laity do not even hear the word “management”; they
automatically hear BUSINESS MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>This assumption regarding the universe of management is of fairly
recent origin. Before the 1930s the few writers and thinkers, who
concerned themselves with management—beginning with Frederick Winslow
Taylor around the turn of the century and ending with Chester Barnard
just before World War II—all assumed that business management is just a
subspecies of general management and basically no more different from
the management of any other organization than one breed of dogs is from
another breed of dogs.</p>
<p>The first practical application of management theory did not take
place in a business but in nonprofits and government agencies. Frederick
Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), the inventor of “Scientific Management,” in
all probability also coined the terms “Management” and “Consultant” in
their present meaning. On his calling card he identified himself as
“Consultant to Management”—and he explained that he had intentionally
chosen these new and strange terms to shock potential clients into
awareness of his offering something totally new. But Taylor did not cite
a business but the nonprofit Mayo Clinic as the “perfect example” of
“Scientific Management” in his 1912 testimony before the Congress which
first made the United States management-conscious. And the most
publicized application of Taylor’s “Scientific Management” (though
aborted by union pressure) was not in a business but in the
government-owned and government-run Watertown Arsenal of the U.S.
Army.</p>
<p>The first job to which the term “Manager” in its present meaning was
applied was not in business. It was the City Manager—an American
invention of the early years of the century. The first conscious and
systematic application of “management principles” similarly was not in a
business. It was the reorganization of the U.S. Army in 1901 by Elihu
Root (1845–1937), Theodore Roosevelt’s Secretary of War.</p>
<p>The first Management Congress—Prague in 1922—was not organized by
business people but by Herbert Hoover, then U.S. Secretary of Commerce,
and Thomas Masaryk, a world-famous historian and the founding President
of the new Czechoslovak Republic. And Mary Parker Follett, whose work on
Management began at roughly the same time, never differentiated between
business management and nonbusiness management. She talked of the
management of organizations, to all of which the same principles
applied.</p>
<p>What led to the identification of Management with Business Management
was the Great Depression with its hostility to business and its contempt
for business executives. In order not to be tarred with the business
brush, management in the public sector was rechristened “Public
Administration” and proclaimed a separate discipline—with its own
university departments, its own terminology, its own career ladder. At
the same time—and for the same reason—what had begun as a study of
management in the rapidly growing hospital (e.g., by Raymond Sloan, the
younger brother of GM’s Alfred Sloan) was split off as a separate
discipline and christened “Hospital Administration.”</p>
<p>Not to be called “management” was, in other words, “political
correctness” in the Depression years.</p>
<p>In the postwar period, however, the fashion turned. By 1950 BUSINESS
had become a “good word”—largely the result of the performance during
World War II of American business management. And then very soon
“business management” became “politically correct” as a field of study,
above all. And ever since, management has remained identified in the
public mind as well as in academia with “business management.”</p>
<p>Now, however, we are beginning to unmake this sixty-year-old
mistake—as witness the renaming of so many “business schools” into
“schools of management,” the rapidly growing offerings in “nonprofit
management” by these schools, the emergence of “executive management
programs” recruiting both business and nonbusiness executives or the
emergence of Departments of “Pastoral Management” in divinity
schools.</p>
<p>But the assumption that Management is Business Management still
persists. It is therefore important to assert—and to do so loudly—that
Management is NOT Business Management—any more than, say, Medicine is
Obstetrics.</p>
<p>There are, of course, differences in management between different
organizations—Mission defines Strategy, after all, and Strategy defines
Structure. There surely are differences between managing a chain of
retail stores and managing a Catholic diocese (though amazingly fewer
than either chain stores or bishops believe); between managing an air
base, a hospital and a software company. But the greatest differences
are in the terms individual organizations use. Otherwise the differences
are mainly in application rather than in principles. There are not even
tremendous differences in tasks and challenges. The executives of all
these organizations spend, for instance, about the same amount of their
time on people problems—and the people problems are almost always the
same. Ninety percent or so of what each of these organizations is
concerned with is generic. And the differences in respect to the last 10
percent are no greater between businesses and nonbusinesses than they
are between businesses in different industries, for example, between a
multinational bank and a toy manufacturer. In every
organization—business or nonbusiness alike—only the last 10 percent of
management has to be fitted to the organization’s specific mission, its
specific culture, its specific history and its specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>That Management is not Business Management is particularly important
as the growth sector of a developed society in the 21st century is most
unlikely to be business—in fact, business has not even been the growth
sector of the 20th century in developed societies. A far smaller
proportion of the working population in every developed country is now
engaged in economic activity, that is, in “business,” than it was a
hundred years ago. Then virtually everybody in the working population
made his or her living in economic activities (e.g., farming). The
growth sectors in the 20th century in developed countries have been in
“nonbusiness”—in government, in the professions, in health care, in
education. As an employer and a source of livelihood business has been
shrinking steadily for a hundred years (or at least since World War I).
And insofar as we can predict, the growth sector in the 21st century in
developed countries will not be “business,” that is, organized economic
activity. It is likely to be the nonprofit social sector. And that is
also the sector where management is today most needed and where
systematic, principled, theory-based management can yield the greatest
results the fastest.</p>
<p>The first Conclusion of this analysis of the ASSUMPTIONS that must
underlie Management to make productive both its study and its practice
is therefore:</p>
<p>Management is the specific and distinguishing organ of any and all
organizations.</p>
<p>II The One Right Organization</p>
<p>Concern with management and its study began with the sudden emergence
of large organizations—business, governmental civil service, the large
standing army—which was the novelty of late-19th-century society.</p>
<p>And from the very beginning more than a century ago, the study of
organization has rested on one assumption:</p>
<p>There is—or there must be—one right organization.</p>
<p>What is presented as the “one right organization” has changed more
than once. But the search for the one right organization has continued
and continues today.</p>
<p>Organization structure in business was first tackled in France around
the turn of the century, by Henri Fayol (1841– 1925), the head of one of
Europe’s largest but also totally disorganized enterprises, a
coal-mining company. (He did not, however, publish his book until 1916.)
Practitioners were also the first ones concerned with organization in
the United States and at about the same time: John J. Rockefeller, Sr.;
J. P. Morgan, and especially Andrew Carnegie (who still deserves to be
studied and who had the most lasting impact). A little later Elihu Root
applied organization theory to the U.S. Army, as already mentioned—and
it is hardly coincidence that Root had been Carnegie’s legal adviser. At
the same time, Georg Siemens (1839–1901), the founder in 1870 of the
Deutsche Bank, used (around 1895) the organization concepts of his
friend Fayol to save the rapidly floundering Siemens Electric Company
that his cousin Werner Siemens (1816–1892) had founded but had left
leaderless at his death.</p>
<p>Yet the need for organization structure was by no means obvious to
everybody in these early years.</p>
<p>Frederick Winslow Taylor did not see it at all. Until his death he
wrote and talked of “the owners and their helpers.” And it was on this
concept, that is, on a non-structure, that Henry Ford (1863–1947), up to
the time of his death, tried to run what for many years (until the late
1920s) was the world’s largest manufacturing company.</p>
<p>It was World War I that made clear the need for a formal organization
structure. But it was also World War I that showed that Fayol’s (and
Carnegie’s) functional structure was not the one right organization.
Immediately after World War I first Pierre S. Du Pont (1870–1954) and
then Alfred Sloan (1875–1966) developed Decentralization. And now, in
the last few years, we have come to tout the “Team” as the one right
organization for pretty much everything.</p>
<p>By now, however, it should have become clear that there is no such
thing as the one right organization. There are only organizations, each
of which has distinct strengths, distinct limitations and specific
applications. It has become clear that organization is not an absolute.
It is a tool for making people productive in working together. As such,
a given organization structure fits certain tasks in certain conditions
and at certain times.</p>
<p>One hears a great deal today about “the end of hierarchy.” This is
blatant nonsense. In any institution there has to be a final authority,
that is, a “boss”—someone who can make the final decisions and who can
expect them to be obeyed. In a situation of common peril—and every
institution is likely to encounter it sooner or later—survival of all
depends on clear command. If the ship goes down, the captain does not
call a meeting, the captain gives an order. And if the ship is to be
saved, everyone must obey the order, must know exactly where to go and
what to do, and do it without “participation” or argument. “Hierarchy,”
and the unquestioning acceptance of it by everyone in the organization,
is the only hope in a crisis.</p>
<p>Other situations within the same institution require deliberation.
Others still require teamwork—and so on.</p>
<p>Organization Theory assumes that institutions are homogeneous and
that, therefore, the entire enterprise should be organized the same
way.</p>
<p>Fayol assumed a “typical manufacturing enterprise.” Alfred Sloan in
the 1920s organized each of General Motors’ decentralized divisions
exactly the same way. Thirty years later, in the massive reorganization
of the (American) General Electric Company in the early 1950s, it was
still considered “heresy” to organize a small unit of a few dozen
researchers engaged solely on development work for the U.S. Air Force
differently from huge “departments” employing several thousand people
and manufacturing a standard product, for example, a toaster for the
kitchen. The small development group was actually saddled with a
manufacturing manager, a personnel manager, a financial manager, and a
public relations manager.</p>
<p>But in any one enterprise—probably even in Fayol’s “typical
manufacturing company”—there is need for a number of different
organization structures coexisting side by side.</p>
<p>Managing foreign currency exposure is an increasingly critical—and
increasingly difficult—task in a world economy. It requires total
centralization. No one unit of the enterprise can be permitted to handle
its own foreign currency exposures. But in the same enterprise servicing
the customer, especially in high-tech areas, requires almost complete
local autonomy—going way beyond traditional decentralization. Each of
the individual service people has to be the “boss,” with the rest of the
organization taking its direction from them.</p>
<p>Certain forms of research require a strict functional organization
with all specialists “playing their instrument” by themselves. Other
kinds of research, however, especially research that involves decision
making at an early stage (e.g., some pharmaceutical research), require
teamwork from the beginning. And the two kinds of research often occur
side by side and in the same research organization.</p>
<p>The belief that there must be one right organization is closely tied
to the fallacy that Management is Business Management. If earlier
students of management had not been blinkered by this fallacy but had
looked at nonbusinesses, they would soon have found that there are vast
differences in organization structure according to the nature of the
task.</p>
<p>A Catholic diocese is organized very differently from an opera. A
modern army is organized very differently from a hospital. But also,
typically, these institutions have more than one organization structure.
In the Catholic diocese, for instance, the bishop is the absolute
authority in certain areas, a constitutional monarch in others (severely
limited, for instance, in his right to discipline his diocesan clergy)
and virtually powerless in others—he cannot, for instance, visit a
parish in his diocese unless the parish priest invites him to do so. The
bishop appoints the members of the diocesan court—though custom
indicates which of his clerics are eligible for such an appointment. But
once that court is appointed it, rather than the bishop, has exclusive
jurisdiction in a great many areas.</p>
<p>There are indeed some “principles” of organization.</p>
<p>One is surely that organization has to be transparent. People have to
know and have to understand the organization structure they are supposed
to work in. This sounds obvious—but it is far too often violated in most
institutions (even in the military).</p>
<p>Another principle I have already mentioned: Someone in the
organization must have the authority to make the final decision in a
given area. And someone must clearly be in command in a CRISIS. It also
is a sound principle that authority be commensurate with
responsibility.</p>
<p>It is a sound principle that one person in an organization should
have only one “master.” There is wisdom to the old proverb of the Roman
Law that a slave who has three masters is a free man. It is a very old
principle of human relations that no one should be put into a conflict
of loyalties—and having more than one “master” creates such a conflict
(which, by the way, is the reason that the “Jazz Combo” team, so popular
now, is so difficult—every one of its members has two masters, the head
of the specialty function, for example, engineering, and the team
leader). It is a sound, structural principle to have the fewest layers,
that is, to have an organization that is as “flat” as possible—if only
because, as Information Theory tells us, “every relay doubles the noise
and cuts the message in half.”</p>
<p>But these principles do not tell us what to do. They only tell us
what not to do. They do not tell us what will work. They tell us what is
unlikely to work. These principles are not too different from the ones
that inform an architect’s work. They do not tell him what kind of
building to build. They tell him what the restraints are. And this is
pretty much what the various principles of organization structure
do.</p>
<p>One implication: Individuals will have to be able to work at one and
the same time in different organization structures. For one task they
will work in a team. But for another task they will have to work—and at
the same time—in a command and control structure. The same individual
who is a “boss” within his or her own organization is a “partner” in an
alliance, a minority participation, a joint venture and so on.
Organizations, in other words, will have to become part of the
executive’s toolbox.</p>
<p>Even more important: We need to go to work on studying the strengths
and the limitations of different organizations. For what tasks are what
organizations most suitable? For what tasks are what organizations least
suitable? And when, in the performance of a task, should we switch from
one kind of organization to another?</p>
<p>This analysis is perhaps most needed for the currently “politically
correct” organization: the team.</p>
<p>It is generally assumed today that there is only one kind of
team—call it the Jazz Combo—and that it fits every task. Actually there
are at least half a dozen—perhaps a full dozen—very different teams,
each with its own area of application, each with its own limitations and
difficulties, and each requiring different management. The team that is
popular now, the Jazz Combo, is arguably the most difficult one, the one
most difficult to make work and the one with the most severe
limitations. Unless we work out, and fast, what a given team is suited
for, and what a given team is not suited for, teams will become
discredited as “just another fad” within a few short years. Yet teams
are important. Where they do belong and where they do work, they are the
most effective organization.</p>
<p>And surely we will have to study and to use “mixed” structures rather
than only the “pure,” “one right organization,” which organization
theory—and largely also organization practice—still believes in.</p>
<p>One example: the dozen or more highly trained people needed to
perform open-heart surgery such as a heart bypass operation. They can be
seen as a pure—indeed an extreme—example of Fayol’s “functional
organization,” with each member—the lead surgeon, the two assistant
surgeons, the anesthesiologist, the two nurses who prepare the patient
for the operation, the three nurses who assist at the operation, the two
or three nurses and the resident in the recovery room and intensive care
unit, the respiratory technician running the heart-lung machine, the
three or four electronic technicians—each doing ONE, and only one task
and never, never doing anything else. Yet these people look upon
themselves as a “team”—and are seen as a team by everyone in the
hospital. They are indeed a “team” in that each member—immediately and
without anyone’s giving an order or saying one word—changes HOW he or
she is doing the job with the slightest change in the rhythm, the
progress, the flow of the operation.</p>
<p>One area in which research and study are particularly needed is the
ORGANIZATION OF TOP MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>Concern with organization actually began with the first conscious
design of the top management job—the AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. This design
did solve for the first time what had been the oldest organization
problem of political society and one that no earlier political system
could solve: the succession problem. The Constitution made sure that
there would always be a chief executive officer fully legitimate, fully
authorized and (hopefully) prepared for the job—and yet not threatening
the authority of the present incumbent as did the crown princes of yore.
In respect to the structure of top management in nonpolitical
organizations, work also antedates formal organization theory. Georg
Siemens—already mentioned as the founder of the Deutsche Bank and as the
savior, through imposing formal organization structure, of his cousin’s
electric company (and both the Deutsche Bank and the Siemens Electric
Company are still their country’s largest businesses in their respective
industries)—designed what to this day is the legal structure of top
management in Germany (and, with slight variations, in Central and
Northern Europe as well): a team of equal partners, each of whom,
however, is a FUNCTIONAL expert and all but autonomous in his or her
area, with the entire group then electing a “SPEAKER” who is not a
“boss” but a “leader.”</p>
<p>Yet I doubt that anyone would assert that we really know how to
organize the top management job, whether in a business, a university, a
hospital or even a modern church.</p>
<p>One clear sign is the growing disparity between our rhetoric and our
practice: We talk incessantly about “teams”—and every study comes to the
conclusion that the top management job does indeed require a team. Yet
we now practice—and not only in American industry—the most extreme
“personality cult” of CEO supermen. And no one seems to pay the
slightest attention in our present worship of these larger-than-life
CEOs to the question of how and by what process they are to be
succeeded—and yet, succession has always been the ultimate test of any
top management and the ultimate test of any institution.</p>
<p>There is, in other words, an enormous amount of work to be done in
organizational theory and organization practice—even though both are the
oldest areas of organized work and organized practice in management.</p>
<p>The pioneers of management a century ago were right. Organizational
Structure is needed. The modern enterprise—whether business, civil
service, university, hospital, large church or large military—needs
organization just as any biological organization beyond the ameba needs
structure. But the pioneers were wrong in their assumption that there
is—or should be—one right organization. Just as there are a great number
of different structures for biological organizations, so there are a
number of organizations for the social organism that is the modern
institution. Instead of searching for the right organization, management
needs to learn to look for, to develop, to test.</p>
<p>The organization that fits the task.</p>
<p>III The One Right Way to Manage People</p>
<p>In no other area are the basic traditional assumptions held as
firmly—though mostly subconsciously—as in respect to people and their
management. And in no other area are they so totally at odds with
reality and so totally counterproductive.</p>
<p>“There is one right way to manage people—or at least there should
be.” This assumption underlies practically every book or paper on the
management of people.</p>
<p>Its most quoted exposition is Douglas McGregor’s book The Human Side
of Enterprise (1960), which asserted that managements have to choose
between two and only two different ways of managing people, “Theory X”
and “Theory Y,” and which then asserted that Theory Y is the only sound
one. (A little earlier I had said pretty much the same thing in my 1954
book The Practice of Management.) A few years later Abraham H. Maslow
(1908–1970) showed in his Eupsychian Management (1962; new edition 1995
entitled Maslow on Management) that both McGregor and I were dead wrong.
He showed conclusively that different people have to be managed
differently.</p>
<p>I became an immediate convert—Maslow’s evidence is overwhelming. But
to date very few people have paid much attention.</p>
<p>On this fundamental assumption that there is—or at least should
be—one and only one right way to manage people, rest all the other
assumptions about people in organizations and their management.</p>
<p>One of these assumptions is that the people who work for an
organization are employees of the organization, working full-time, and
dependent on the organization for their livelihood and their careers.
Another such assumption is that the people who work for an organization
are subordinates. Indeed, it is assumed that the great majority of these
people have either no skill or low skills and do what they are being
assigned to do.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, when these assumptions were first formulated,
during and at the end of WWI, they conformed close enough to reality to
be considered valid. Today every one of them has become untenable. The
majority of people who work for an organization may still be employees
of the organization. But a very large and steadily growing
minority—though working for the organization—are no longer its
employees, let alone its full-time employees. They work for an
outsourcing contractor, for example, the outsourcing firm that provides
maintenance in a hospital or a manufacturing plant, or the outsourcing
firm that runs the data processing system for a government agency or a
business. They are “temps” or part-timers. Increasingly they are
individual contractors working on a retainer or for a specific
contractual period; this is particularly true of the most knowledgeable
and therefore the most valuable people working for the organization.</p>
<p>Even if employed full-time by the organization, fewer and fewer
people are “subordinates”—even in fairly low-level jobs. Increasingly
they are “knowledge workers.” And knowledge workers are not
subordinates; they are “associates.” For, once beyond the apprentice
stage, knowledge workers must know more about their job than their boss
does—or else they are no good at all. In fact, that they know more about
their job than anybody else in the organization is part of the
definition of knowledge workers.</p>
<p>The engineer servicing a customer does not know more about the
product than the engineering manager does. But he knows more about the
customer—and that may be more important than product knowledge. The
meteorologist on an air base is vastly inferior in rank to the air base
commander. But he is of no use unless he knows infinitely more about
weather forecasting than the air base commander does. The mechanic
servicing an airliner knows far more about the technical condition of
the plane than the airport manager of the airline to whom he reports,
and so on.</p>
<p>Add to this that today’s “superiors” usually have not held the jobs
their “subordinates” hold—as they did only a few short decades ago and
as still is widely assumed they do.</p>
<p>A regimental commander in the army, only a few decades ago, had held
every one of the jobs of his subordinates—battalion commander, company
commander, platoon commander. The only difference in these respective
jobs between the lowly platoon commander and the lordly regimental
commander was in the number of people each commands; the work they did
was exactly alike. To be sure, today’s regimental commanders have
commanded troops earlier in their careers—but often for a short period
only. They also have advanced through captain and major. But for most of
their careers they have held very different assignments—in staff jobs,
in research jobs, in teaching jobs, attached to an embassy abroad and so
on. They simply can no longer assume that they know what their
“subordinate,” the captain in charge of a company, is doing or trying to
do—they have been captains, of course, but they may have never commanded
a company.</p>
<p>Similarly, the vice-president of marketing may have come up the sales
route. He or she knows a great deal about selling. But he or she knows
nothing about market research, pricing, packaging, service, sales
forecasting. The marketing vice-president therefore cannot possibly tell
the experts in the marketing department what they should be doing, and
how. Yet they are supposed to be the marketing vice-president’s
“subordinates”—and the marketing vice-president is definitely
responsible for their performance and for their contribution to the
company’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The same is true for the hospital administrator or the hospital’s
medical director in respect to the trained knowledge workers in the
clinical laboratory or in physical therapy.</p>
<p>To be sure, these associates are “subordinates” in that they depend
on the “boss” when it comes to being hired or fired, promoted, appraised
and so on. But in his or her own job the superior can perform only if
these so-called subordinates take responsibility for educating him or
her, that is, for making the “superior” understand what market research
or physical therapy can do and should be doing, and what “results” are
in their respective areas. In turn, these “subordinates” depend on the
superior for direction. They depend on the superior to tell them what
the “score” is.</p>
<p>Their relationship, in other words, is far more like that between the
conductor of an orchestra and the instrumentalist than it is like the
traditional superior/subordinate relationship. The superior in an
organization employing knowledge workers cannot, as a rule, do the work
of the supposed subordinate any more than the conductor of an orchestra
can play the tuba. In turn, the knowledge worker is dependent on the
superior to give direction and, above all, to define what the “score” is
for the entire organization, that is, what are standards and values,
performance and results. And just as an orchestra can sabotage even the
ablest conductor—and certainly even the most autocratic one—a knowledge
organization can easily sabotage even the ablest, let alone the most
autocratic, superior.</p>
<p>Altogether, an increasing number of people who are full-time
employees have to be managed as if they were volunteers. They are paid,
to be sure. But knowledge workers have mobility. They can leave. They
own their “means of production,” which is their knowledge. (See on this
also Chapter Six.)</p>
<p>We have known for fifty years that money alone does not motivate to
perform. Dissatisfaction with money grossly demotivates. Satisfaction
with money is, however, mainly a “hygiene factor,” as Frederick Herzberg
called it all of forty years ago in his 1959 book The Motivation to
Work. What motivates—and especially what motivates knowledge workers—is
what motivates volunteers. Volunteers, we know, have to get more
satisfaction from their work than paid employees, precisely because they
do not get a paycheck. They need, above all, challenge. They need to
know the organization’s mission and to believe in it. They need
continuous training. They need to see results.</p>
<p>Implicit in this is that different groups in the work population have
to be managed differently, and that the same group in the work
population has to be managed differently at different times.
Increasingly “employees” have to be managed as “partners”—and it is the
definition of a partnership that all partners are equal. It is also the
definition of a partnership that partners cannot be ordered. They have
to be persuaded. Increasingly, therefore, the management of people is a
“marketing job.” And in marketing one does not begin with the question:
“What do we want?” One begins with the question: “What does the other
party want? What are its values? What are its goals? What does it
consider results?” And this is neither “Theory X” nor “Theory Y,” nor
any other specific theory of managing people.</p>
<p>Maybe we will have to redefine the task altogether. It may not be
“managing the work of people.” The starting point both in theory and in
practice may have to be “managing for performance.” The starting point
may be a definition of results—just as the starting points of both the
orchestra conductor and the foot-ball coach are the score.</p>
<p>The productivity of the knowledge worker is likely to become the
center of the management of people, just as the work on the productivity
of the manual worker became the center of managing people a hundred
years ago, that is, since Frederick W. Taylor. This will require, above
all, very different assumptions about people in organizations and their
work:</p>
<p>One does not “manage” people.</p>
<p>The task is to lead people.</p>
<p>And the goal is to make productive the specific strengths and
knowledge of each individual.</p>
<p>IV Technologies and End-Users Are Fixed and Given</p>
<p>Four major assumptions, as said above, have been underlying the
PRACTICE of Management all along—in fact for much longer than there has
been a DISCIPLINE of Management.</p>
<p>The assumptions about technology and end-users to a very large extent
underlie the rise of modern business and of the modern economy
altogether. They go back to the very early days of the Industrial
Revolution.</p>
<p>When the textile industry first developed out of what had been
cottage industries it was assumed—and with complete validity—that the
textile industry had its own unique technology. The same was true in
respect to coal mining, and of any of the other industries that arose in
the late 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. The first
one to understand this and to base a major enterprise on it was also one
of the first men to develop what we would today call a modern business,
the German Werner Siemens (1816–1892). It led him in 1869 to hire the
first university-trained scientist to start a modern research
lab—devoted exclusively to what we would now call electronics, and based
on a clear understanding that electronics (in those days called
“low-voltage”) was distinct and separate from all other industries, and
had its distinct and separate technology.</p>
<p>Out of this insight grew not only Siemens’s own company with its own
research lab, but also the German chemical industry, which assumed
worldwide leadership because it based itself on the assumption that
chemistry—and especially organic chemistry—had its own unique
technology. Out of it then grew all the other major leading companies
the world over, whether the American electrical and chemical companies,
the automobile companies, the telephone companies and so on. Out of this
insight then grew what may well be the most successful invention of the
19th century, the research laboratory—the last one almost a century
after Siemens’s, the 1950 lab of IBM—and at around the same time the
research labs of the major pharmaceutical companies as they emerged as a
worldwide industry after World War II.</p>
<p>By now these assumptions have become untenable. The best example is
of course the pharmaceutical industry, which increasingly has come to
depend on technologies that are fundamentally different from the
technologies on which the pharmaceutical research lab is based:
genetics, for instance, microbiology, molecular biology, medical
electronics and so on.</p>
<p>But the same thing has happened in the automobile industry, which
increasingly has become dependent on electronics, and on the computer.
It has happened to the steel industry, which increasingly has become
dependent on materials sciences of which the original steel companies
were totally ignorant—and largely still are. It has happened to the
paper industry—the list could be continued indefinitely.</p>
<p>In the 19th century and throughout the first half of the 20th
century, it could be taken for granted that technologies outside one’s
own industry had no, or at least only minimal, impact on the industry.
Now the assumption to start with is that the technologies that are
likely to have the greatest impact on a company and an industry are
technologies outside its own field.</p>
<p>The original assumption was of course that one’s own research lab
would and could produce everything the company—or the company’s
industry—needed. And in turn the assumption was that everything that
this research lab produced would be used in and by the industry that it
served.</p>
<p>This, for instance, was the clear foundation of what was probably the
most successful of all the great research labs of the last hundred
years, the Bell Labs of the American telephone system. Founded in the
early 1920s, the Bell Labs until the late 1960s did indeed produce
practically every new knowledge and every new technology the telephone
industry needed. And in turn practically everything the Bell Labs
scientists produced found its main use in the telephone system. This
changed drastically with what was probably the Bell Labs’s greatest
scientific achievement: the transistor. The telephone company itself did
become a heavy user of the transistor. But the main uses of the
transistor were outside the telephone system. This was so unexpected
that the Bell Telephone Company, when the transistor was first
developed, virtually gave it away—it did not see enough use for it
within the telephone system. But it also did not see any use for it
outside it. And so what was the most revolutionary development that came
out of the Bell Labs—and certainly the most valuable one—was sold freely
to all comers for the paltry sum of 5,000. It is on this total failure
of the Bell Labs to understand the significance of its own achievement
that practically all modern electronic companies outside of the
telephone are based.</p>
<p>Conversely, the things that have revolutionized the telephone
system—such as digital switching or the fiberglass cable—did not come
out of the Bell Labs. They came out of technologies that were foreign to
telephone technology. And this has been typical altogether of the last
thirty to fifty years—and it is increasingly becoming more typical of
every industry.</p>
<p>Technologies, unlike the 19th-century technologies, no longer run in
parallel. They constantly crisscross. Constantly, something in a
technology of which people in a given industry have barely heard (just
as the people in the pharmaceutical industry had never heard of
genetics, let alone of medical electronics) revolutionizes an industry
and its technology. Constantly, such outside technologies force an
industry to learn, to acquire, to adapt, to change its very mindset, let
alone its technical knowledge. The basic assumptions of genetics are
alien to a pharmacologist—and yet genetics is rapidly revolutionizing
the pharmaceutical industry. And the mindset of the geneticist is so
different that so far, no major pharmaceutical company has been able to
integrate genetics successfully into its own research program. It can
only get access to genetics by alliances with outsiders, whether through
minority participation in a genetics company or through an agreement
with a university genetics department.</p>
<p>Equally important to the rise of 19th- and early-20th-century
industry and companies was a second assumption: End-uses are fixed and
given. For a certain end-use, for example, to put beer into containers,
there may have been extreme competition between various suppliers of
containers. But all of them, until recently, were glass companies, and
there was only one way of putting beer into containers, a glass
bottle.</p>
<p>Similarly, as soon as steel became available, that is, beginning in
the last decades of the 19th century, rails for railroads were to be
made from steel and from nothing else. As soon as electricity began to
be transmitted over any distance, the wire had to be made from copper.
And the same assumption applied to services. The credit needs of a
business could only be supplied by a commercial loan from a commercial
bank. The post office had a “natural monopoly” on transporting and
delivering written and printed communications. There were two ways of
getting fed: cooking for oneself at home or going out to a
restaurant.</p>
<p>This was accepted as obvious not only by business, industry and the
consumer, but by governments as well. The American regulation of
business rests on the assumptions that to every industry pertains a
unique technology and that to every end-use pertains a specific and
unique product or service. These are the assumptions on which Anti-Trust
was based. And to this day Anti-Trust concerns itself with the
domination of the market in glass bottles and pays little attention to
the fact that beer increasingly is not put into glass bottles but into
cans (or, vice versa, Anti-Trust concerns itself exclusively with the
concentration of supply in respect to metal containers for beer, paying
no attention to the fact that beer is still being put into glass
bottles, but also increasingly into plastic cans). As late as the
mid-twenties the U.S. Supreme Court decided that there were two and only
two mutually exclusive and non-competitive ways for
telecommunication—the spoken word went via telephone and the written
word went via telegraph. And ten years later during the Depression, the
Congress of the United States separated investment banking from
commercial banking, each to be set up in separate institutions and each
having its own exclusive end-use.</p>
<p>But since WWII end-uses are not uniquely tied any more to a certain
product or service. The plastics of course were the first major
exception to the rule. But by now it is clear that it is not just one
material moving in on what was considered the “turf” of another one.
Increasingly the same want is being satisfied by very different means.
It is the want that is unique, and not the means to satisfy it.</p>
<p>As late as the beginning of WWII, news was basically the monopoly of
the newspaper—an 18th-century invention that saw its biggest growth in
the early years of the 20th century. By now there are several competing
ways to deliver news: still the printed newspaper, increasingly the same
newspaper delivered on-line through the Internet, radio, television,
separate news organizations that use only electronics—as is increasingly
the case with economic and business news—and quite a few additional
ones.</p>
<p>The U.S. Glass-Steagall Act of the Depression years not only
attempted to prevent commercial banks from doing business in the
investment market, it also tried to prevent investment bankers from
doing commercial banking business and thus tried to give banks a
monopoly on lending. One paradoxical result was that this act, intended
to establish the monopoly position of the bank in the commercial market,
has given the commercial market to the investment bankers. By a quirk of
American law (a Supreme Court decision of the 1920s) “commercial paper”
(the American equivalent to the European Bill of Exchange) was
classified as a “security.” This then enabled the investment bankers
after 1960 to become the dominant force in the commercial banking
business, that is, to replace increasingly the banks’ commercial loan
with the investment bankers’ “commercial paper.”</p>
<p>But increasingly in all developed countries the fastest-growing
source of commercial credit is neither the commercial bank nor the
investment bank. It is the credit card in its various forms. A still
fairly small but rapidly growing number of credit card customers have
multiple credit cards—some as many as twenty-five or thirty. They use
these cards to obtain and to maintain a level of credit far beyond their
creditworthiness. That the interest rate is very high does not seem to
bother them, since they do not have any intention anyhow of paying off
the loans. They manipulate them by shifting the outstanding balance from
one card to the other so that they are never forced to pay more than
very small, minimum amounts. The credit card has thus become what used
to be called “legal tender.” Nobody knows how big this new form of money
has become—but it is clearly a new form of money. And it has already
become so big as to make almost meaningless the figures for money in
circulation, whether M1 or M2 or M3, on which central banks and
economists base their theories and their forecasts.</p>
<p>And then there is the new “basic resource” information. It differs
radically from all other commodities in that it does not stand under the
scarcity theorem. On the contrary, it stands under an abundance theorem.
If I sell a thing—for example, a book—I no longer have the book. If I
impart information, I still have it. And in fact, information becomes
more valuable the more people have it. What this means for economics is
well beyond the scope of this book—though it is clear that it will force
us radically to revise basic economic theory. But it also means a good
deal for management. Increasingly basic assumptions will have to be
changed. Information does not pertain to any industry or to any
business. Information also does not have any one end-use, nor does any
end-use require a particular kind of information or depend on one
particular kind of information.</p>
<p>Management therefore now has to start out with the assumption that
there is no one technology that pertains to any industry and that, on
the contrary, all technologies are capable—and indeed likely—to be of
major importance to any industry and to have impact on any industry.
Management similarly has to start with the assumption that there is no
one given end-use for any product or service and that, conversely, no
end-use is going to be linked to any one product or service.</p>
<p>Some implications of this are that increasingly the non-customers of
an enterprise—whether a business, a university, a church, a hospital—are
as important as the customers, if not more important.</p>
<p>Even the biggest enterprise (other than a government monopoly) has
many more noncustomers than it has customers. There are very few
institutions that supply as large a percentage of a market as 30
percent. There are therefore few institutions where the noncustomers do
not amount to at least 70 percent of the potential market. And yet very
few institutions know anything about the noncustomers—very few of them
even know that they exist, let alone know who they are. And even fewer
know why they are not customers. Yet it is with the noncustomers that
changes always start.</p>
<p>Another critical implication is that the starting point for
management can no longer be its own product or service, and not even its
known market and its known end-uses for its products and services. The
starting point has to be what customers consider value. The starting
point has to be the assumption—an assumption amply proven by all our
experience—that the customer never buys what the supplier sells. What is
value to the customer is always something quite different from what is
value or quality to the supplier. This applies as much to a business as
to a university or to a hospital.</p>
<p>One example is the pastoral mega-churches that have been growing so
very fast in the United States since 1980, and that are surely the most
important social phenomenon in American society in the last thirty
years. Almost unknown thirty years ago—there were no more than a
thousand churches then that had a congregation exceeding two thousand
people—there are now some twenty thousand of them. And while all the
traditional denominations have steadily declined, the mega-churches have
exploded. They have done so because they asked, “What is value?” to a
nonchurchgoer. And they have found that it is different from what
churches traditionally thought they were supplying. The greatest value
to the thousands who now throng the mega-churches—and do so week-days
and Sundays—is a spiritual experience rather than a ritual, and equally
management, responsibility for volunteer service, whether in the church
itself or, through the church, in the community.</p>
<p>Management, in other words, will increasingly have to be based on the
assumption that neither technology nor end-use is a foundation for
management policy. They are limitations. The foundations have to be
customer values and customer decisions on the distribution of their
disposable income. It is with those that management policy and
management strategy increasingly will have to start.</p>
<p>V Management’s Scope Is Legally Defined</p>
<p>Management, both in theory and in practice, deals with the legal
entity, the individual enterprise—whether the business corporation, the
hospital, the university and so on. The scope of management is thus
legally defined. This has been—and still is—the almost universal
assumption.</p>
<p>One reason for this assumption is the traditional concept of
management as being based on command and control. Command and control
are indeed legally defined. The chief executive of a business, the
bishop of a diocese, the administrator of a hospital have no command and
control authority beyond the legal confines of their institution.</p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago it first became clear that the legal
definition was not adequate to manage a major enterprise.</p>
<p>The Japanese are usually credited with the invention of the
“Keiretsu,” the management concept in which the suppliers to an
enterprise are tied together with their main customer, for example,
Toyota, for planning, product development, cost control and so on. But
actually the Keiretsu is much older and an American invention. It goes
back to around 1910 and to the man who first saw the potential of the
automobile to become a major industry, William C. Durant (1861–1947). It
was Durant who created General Motors by buying up small but successful
automobile manufacturers such as Buick and merging them into one big
automobile company. A few years later Durant then realized that he
needed to bring the main suppliers into his corporation. He began to buy
up and merge into General Motors one parts and accessories maker after
the other, finishing in 1920 by buying Fisher Body, the country’s
largest manufacturer of automobile bodies. With this purchase General
Motors had come to own the manufacturers of 70 percent of everything
that went into its automobiles—and had become by far the world’s most
integrated large business. It was this prototype Keiretsu that gave
General Motors the decisive advantage, both in cost and in speed, which
made it within a few short years both the world’s largest and the
world’s most profitable manufacturing company, and the unchallenged
leader in an exceedingly competitive American automobile market. In
fact, for some thirty-odd years, General Motors enjoyed a 30 percent
cost advantage over all its competitors, including Ford and
Chrysler.</p>
<p>But the Durant Keiretsu was still based on the belief that management
means command and control—this was the reason that Durant bought all the
companies that became part of General Motors’ Keiretsu. And this
eventually became the greatest weakness of GM. Durant had carefully
planned to ensure the competitiveness of the GM-owned accessory
suppliers. Each of them (excepting Fisher Body) had to sell 50 percent
of its output outside of GM, that is, to competing automobile
manufacturers, and thus had to maintain competitive costs and
competitive quality. But after WWII the competing automobile
manufacturers disappeared—and with them the check on the competitiveness
of GM’s wholly owned accessory divisions. Also, with the unionization of
the automobile industry in 1936–1937, the high labor costs of automobile
assembly plants were imposed on General Motors’ accessory divisions,
which put them at a cost disadvantage that to this day they have not
been able to overcome. That Durant based his Keiretsu on the assumption
that management means command and control largely explains, in other
words, the decline of General Motors in the last twenty-five years and
the company’s inability to turn itself around.</p>
<p>This was clearly realized in the 1920s and 1930s by the builder of
the next Keiretsu, Sears Roebuck. As Sears became America’s largest
retailer, especially of appliances and hardware, it too realized the
necessity to bring together into one group its main suppliers so as to
make possible joint planning, joint product development and product
design, and cost control across the entire economic chain. But instead
of buying these suppliers, Sears bought small minority stakes in
them—more as a token of its commitment than as an investment—and based
the relationship otherwise on contract. And the next Keiretsu
builder—and probably the most successful one so far (even more
successful than the Japanese)—was Marks andandandand Spencer in England,
which, beginning in the early 1930s, integrated practically all its
suppliers into its own management system, but exclusively through
contracts rather than through ownership stakes or ownership control.</p>
<p>It is the Marks andandandand Spencer model that the Japanese, quite
consciously, copied in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Actually, the share of even the most highly integrated enterprise in
the total costs and the total results of the entire process is quite
small indeed. While General Motors at its peak manufactured 70 percent
of everything that went into the finished automobile, it got only 15
percent of what the ultimate consumer actually paid for a new car. Fifty
percent of the total went for distribution, that is, for costs incurred
after the finished car had left the General Motors assembly plant.
Another 10–15 percent of the total were various taxes. And of the
remaining 35 percent of the total, one-half—another 17 percent—was still
payments to outside suppliers. Yet no manufacturing company in history
has dominated a larger share of the total economic process than did GM
at the period of its greatest success, that is, in the 1950s and 1960s.
The share of the typical manufacturing company in the costs and revenues
of the economic process—that is, what the customer ultimately
pays—rarely amounts to as much as an almost insignificant 10 percent of
the total. Yet if management’s scope is legally defined, this is all the
manufacturer typically has any information on—and all it can even try to
manage.</p>
<p>In every single case, beginning with General Motors, the Keiretsu,
that is, the integration into one management system of enterprises that
are linked economically rather than controlled legally, has given a cost
advantage of at least 25 percent and more often 30 percent. In every
single case it has given dominance in the industry and in the
marketplace.</p>
<p>And yet the Keiretsu is not enough. It is still based on power.
Whether it is General Motors and the small, independent accessory
companies that Durant bought between 1915 and 1920, or Sears Roebuck, or
Marks andandandand Spencer, or Toyota—the central company has
overwhelming economic power. The Keiretsu is not based on a partnership
of equals. It is based on the dependence of the suppliers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, however, the economic chain brings together genuine
partners, that is, institutions in which there is equality of power and
genuine independence. This is true of the partnership between a
pharmaceutical company and the biology faculty of a major research
university. This is true of the joint ventures through which American
industry got into Japan after WWII. This is true of the partnerships
today between chemical and pharmaceutical companies and companies in
genetics, molecular biology or medical electronics. These companies in
the new technologies may be quite small—and very often are—and badly in
need of capital. But they own independent technology. Therefore they are
the senior partners when it comes to technology. They, rather than the
much bigger pharmaceutical or chemical company, have a choice with whom
to ally themselves. The same is largely true in information technology,
and also in finance. And then neither the traditional Keiretsu nor
command and control work.</p>
<p>What is needed, therefore, is a redefinition of the scope of
management. Management has to encompass the entire process. For business
this means by and large the economic process. But the biology department
of the major research university does not see itself as an economic
unit, and cannot be managed as such. In other institutions the process
also has to be defined differently. Where we have gone furthest in
trying to build management of the entire process is American health
care. The HMO (health maintenance organization) is an attempt—a first
and so far a very tentative, very debatable attempt—to bring the entire
process of health care delivery under partnership management.</p>
<p>The new assumption on which management, both as a discipline and as a
practice, will increasingly have to base itself is that the scope of
management is not legal.</p>
<p>It has to be operational. It has to embrace the entire process. It
has to be focused on results and performance across the entire economic
chain.</p>
<p>VI Management’s Scope Is Politically Defined</p>
<p>It is still generally assumed in the discipline of management—and
very largely still taken for granted in the practice of management—that
the domestic economy, as defined by national boundaries, is the ecology
of enterprise and management—and of nonbusinesses as much as of
businesses.</p>
<p>This assumption underlies the traditional “multinational.”</p>
<p>As is well known, before WWI, as large a share of the world’s
production of manufactured goods and of financial services was
multinational as it is now. The 1913 leading company in any industry,
whether in manufacturing or in finance, derived as large a share of its
sales from selling outside its own country as it did by selling inside
its own country. But insofar as it produced outside its own national
boundaries, it produced within the national boundaries of another
country.</p>
<p>One example:</p>
<p>The largest supplier of war matériel to the Italian Army during WWI
was a young but rapidly growing company called Fiat in Turin—it made all
the automobiles and trucks for the Italian Army. The largest supplier of
war matériel to the Austro-Hungarian Army in WWI was also a company
called Fiat—in Vienna. It supplied all the automobiles and trucks to the
Austro-Hungarian Army. It was two to three times the size of its parent
company. For Austria-Hungary was a much larger market than Italy, partly
because it had a much larger population, and partly because it was more
highly developed, especially in its Western parts. Fiat-Austria was
wholly owned by Fiat-Italy. But except for the designs that came from
Italy, Fiat-Austria was a separate company. Everything it used was made
or bought in Austria. All products were sold in Austria. And every
employee up to and including the CEO was an Austrian. When WWI came, and
Austria and Italy became enemies, all the Austrians had to do,
therefore, was to change the bank account of Fiat-Austria—it kept on
working as it had all along.</p>
<p>Even traditional industries like the automotive industry or insurance
are no longer organized that way.</p>
<p>Until recently General Motors’ two European subsidiaries, Opel in
Germany and Vauxhall in the UK, were separate companies, one producing
in Germany and selling on the Continent, one producing and selling in
the UK. Now GM has one European company, designing, producing and
selling in all of Europe and run out of one European headquarters.
GM-Europe also produces in South America and Asia—and also sells in the
United States. GM-Europe increasingly also designs for the rest of
General Motors Worldwide. In turn, General Motors USA increasingly
designs and produces for GM-Europe and GM-Brazil, and so on. The
worldwide insurance companies—the foremost of them today a German one,
Allianz—are increasingly moving major activities, such as settling
claims, and above all investment, into central facilities that do the
work for all the group’s businesses, wherever they are.</p>
<p>Post-WWII industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, or the
information industries, are increasingly not even organized in
“domestic” and “international” units as GM and Allianz still are. They
are run as a worldwide system in which individual tasks, whether
research, design, engineering, development, testing and increasingly
manufacturing and marketing, are each organized “transnationally.”</p>
<p>One large pharmaceutical company has seven labs in seven different
countries, each focusing on one major area (e.g., antibiotics) but all
run as one “research department” and all reporting to the same research
director in headquarters. The same company has manufacturing plants in
eleven countries, each highly specialized and producing one or two major
product groups for worldwide distribution and sale. It has one medical
director who decides in which of five or six countries a new drug is to
be tested. But managing the company’s foreign exchange exposure is
totally centralized in one location for the entire system. The
medical-electronics business of the (American) General Electric Company
has three “headquarters,” one in the United States, one in Japan, one in
France, each in charge worldwide of one major technology area and the
products based on it (e.g., imaging products such as traditional X-ray
machines or the more recent ultrasound machines). And each of the three
manufactures in a dozen or more countries with each plant supplying a
few key parts for all the other plants throughout the world.</p>
<p>In the traditional multinational, economic reality and political
reality were congruent. The country was the “business unit,” to use
today’s term. In today’s transnational—but increasingly, also, in the
old multinationals as they are being forced to transform themselves—the
country is only a “cost center.” It is a complication rather than the
unit for organization and the unit of business, of strategy, of
production and so on. (But see Chapter Two for some of the resulting
problems.)</p>
<p>Management and national boundaries are no longer congruent. The scope
of management can no longer be politically defined. National boundaries
will continue to be important.</p>
<p>But the new assumption has to be:</p>
<p>National boundaries are important primarily as restraints. The
practice of management—and by no means for businesses only—will
increasingly have to be defined operationally rather than
politically.</p>
<p>VII The Inside Is Management’s Domain</p>
<p>All the traditional assumptions led to one conclusion: The inside of
the organization is the domain of management.</p>
<p>This assumption explains the otherwise totally incomprehensible
distinction between management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In actual practice this distinction makes no sense whatever. An
enterprise, whether a business or any other institution, that does not
innovate and does not engage in entrepreneurship will not survive
long.</p>
<p>The oldest institution in the world is the Roman Catholic church. It
is usually considered the most conservative one—and prides itself on not
being given to rapid changes. Yet, as an old observation has it, any
major change in society produces new and very different religious orders
in the Roman Catholic church—the Benedictines in the 5th century A.D.,
when the Barbarians overran the Roman Empire; the Franciscans and
Dominicans, seven hundred years later, when cities reemerged in the
Middle Ages; the Jesuits in the 16th century as an answer to the
Protestant Reformation, and so on. In Protestantism, as the great church
historian Richard Niebuhr (1894–1962) showed in several books, any major
change in society leads to the emergence of new Protestant
denominations. The emergence of the Knowledge Society today, for
instance, has led on the one hand to the explosive rise of the new,
large, nondenominational, pastoral “mega-churches” that attract the new
knowledge workers, and to equally explosive worldwide growth of
Pentecostalism, attracting largely the less educated and therefore not
upwardly mobile members of modern society.</p>
<p>It should have been obvious from the beginning that management and
entrepreneurship are only two different dimensions of the same task. An
entrepreneur who does not learn how to manage will not last long. A
management that does not learn to innovate will not last long. In fact,
as Chapter Three will argue, business—and every other organization
today—has to be designed for change as the norm and to create change
rather than react to it.</p>
<p>But entrepreneurial activities start with the Outside and are focused
on the Outside. They therefore do not fit within the traditional
assumptions of management’s domain—which explains why they have come so
commonly to be regarded as different, if not incompatible. Any
organization, however, which actually believes that management and
entrepreneurship are different, let alone incompatible, will soon find
itself out of business.</p>
<p>The inward focus of management has been greatly aggravated in the
last decades by the rise of Information Technology. Information
Technology so far may actually have done more damage to management than
it has helped, as discussed in greater depth in Chapter Four.</p>
<p>The traditional assumption that the inside of the organization is the
domain of management means that management is assumed to concern itself
with efforts, if not with costs only. For effort is the only thing that
exists within an organization. And, similarly, everything inside an
organization is a cost center.</p>
<p>But results of any institution exist only on the outside.</p>
<p>It is understandable that management began as a concern for the
inside of the organization. When the large organizations first
arose—with the business enterprise, around 1870, the first and by far
the most visible one—managing the inside was the new challenge. Nobody
had ever done it before. But while the assumption that management’s
domain is the inside of the organization originally made sense—or at
least can be explained—its continuation makes no sense whatever. It is a
contradiction of the very function and nature of organization.</p>
<p>Management must focus on the results and performance of the
organization. Indeed, the first task of management is to define what
results and performance are in a given organization—and this, as anyone
who has worked on it can testify, is in itself one of the most
difficult, one of the most controversial, but also one of the most
important tasks. It is therefore the specific function of management to
organize the resources of the organization for results outside the
organization.</p>
<p>The new assumption—and the basis for the new paradigm on which
management, both as a discipline and as a practice has to be based—is
therefore:</p>
<p>Management exists for the sake of the institution’s results. It has
to start with the intended results and has to organize the resources of
the institution to attain these results. It is the organ to make the
institution, whether business, church, university, hospital or a
battered women’s shelter, capable of producing results outside of
itself.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This chapter has not tried to give answers—intentionally so. It has
tried to raise questions. But underlying all of these is one insight.
The center of a modern society, economy and community is not technology.
It is not information. It is not productivity. It is the managed
institution as the organ of society to produce results. And management
is the specific tool, the specific function, the specific instrument to
make institutions capable of producing results. This, however, requires
a FINAL new management paradigm:</p>
<p>Management’s concern and management’s responsibility are everything
that affects the performance of the institution and its results—whether
inside or outside, whether under the institution’s control or totally
beyond it.</p>

New Certainties</h4>
<p>Why Strategy? •The Collapsing Birthrate •The Distribution of Income
•The Present Growth Industries •Defining Performance •Global
Competitiveness •The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Reality and
Political Reality</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Why Strategy?</p>
<p>Every organization operates on a Theory of the Business,* that is, a
set of assumptions as to what its business is, what its objectives are,
how it defines results, who its customers are, what the customers value
and pay for.</p>
<p>Strategy converts this Theory of the Business into performance. Its
purpose is to enable an organization to achieve its desired results in
an unpredictable environment. For strategy allows an organization to be
purposefully opportunistic.</p>
<p>Strategy is also the test of the Theory of the Business. Failure of
the strategy to produce the expected results is usually the first
serious indication that the Theory of the Business needs to be thought
through again. And unexpected successes are often also the first
indications that the Theory of the Business needs to be rethought.
Indeed, what is an “opportunity” can only be decided if there is a
strategy. Otherwise, there is no way to tell what genuinely advances the
organization toward its desired results, and what is diversion and
splintering of resources.</p>
<p>But what can strategy be based on in a period of rapid change and
total uncertainty, such as the world is facing at the turn of the 21st
century? Are there any assumptions on which to base the strategies of an
organization and especially of a business? Are there any
certainties?</p>
<p>There are indeed FIVE phenomena that can be considered certainties.
They are, however, different from anything present strategies consider.
Above all, they are not, essentially, economic. They are primarily
social and political.</p>
<p>These five certainties are:</p>
<p>1 The Collapsing Birthrate in the Developed World.</p>
<p>2 Shifts in the Distribution of Disposable Income.</p>
<p>3 Defining Performance.</p>
<p>4 Global Competitiveness.</p>
<p>5 The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Globalization and
Political Splintering.</p>
<p>I The Collapsing Birthrate</p>
<p>The most important single new certainty—if only because there is no
precedent for it in all of history—is the collapsing birthrate in the
developed world. In Western and Central Europe and in Japan, the
birthrate has already fallen well below the rate needed to reproduce the
population. That is, below 2.1 live births for women of reproductive
age. In some of Italy’s richest regions, for example, in Bologna, the
birthrate by the year 1999 had fallen to 0.8; in Japan to 1.3. In fact,
Japan and all of Southern Europe—Portugal, Spain, Southern France,
Italy, Greece—are drifting toward collective national suicide by the end
of the 21st century. By then Italy’s population, for instance—now 60
million—might be down to 20 or 22 million; Japan’s population—now 125
million—might be down to 50 or 55 million. But even in Western and
Northern Europe the birthrates are down to 1.5 and falling.</p>
<p>But in the United States, too, the birthrate is now below 2 and going
down steadily. And it is as high as it is only because of the large
number of recent immigrants who still, for the first generation, tend to
retain the high birthrates of their country of origin, for example,
Mexico.</p>
<p>In Japan and in Southern Europe, population is already peaking as it
is in Germany. In the United States it will still grow for another
twenty to twenty-five years, though the entire growth after the year
2015 will be in people fifty-five years and older.</p>
<p>But more important than absolute numbers is the age distribution
within the population. Of those 20-odd million Italians by the year
2080, a very small number will be under fifteen, and a very large
number—at least one-third of the population—well above sixty. In Japan
the disproportion between younger people and people above any
traditional retirement age will be equally great if not greater. In the
United States, the young population is already growing much more slowly
than the older population, past traditional retirement. Still, up to the
year 2015 or so, the number of young people will still be growing in
absolute numbers in the United States. But then it is likely to go down
and quite rapidly.</p>
<p>Birthrates can change, and can do so quite fast, as the American
experience after World War II proved. But even if the birthrates in the
developed world were to turn up drastically, it would take twenty years
or so before these new babies would reach the age at which they join the
labor force. There is nothing—except unprecedentedly massive
immigration—that can prevent a sharp drop in the labor force of
traditional age (i.e., below sixty or sixty-five) in the developed
world—in the United States after 2025 or so, in the rest of the
developed world much earlier.</p>
<p>There is no precedent for this. The birthrate within part of the
Roman Empire may have been falling after A.D. 200 or 250 but, of course,
there are no figures. Above all, there is no precedent for a population
structure in which old people past any traditional retirement age
outnumber young people as they already do in parts of Europe and as they
will do in all developed countries well before the middle of the 21st
century.</p>
<p>For at least two hundred years, all institutions of the modern world
and especially all businesses have assumed a steadily growing
population. In the West the population has been growing since 1400. And
from 1700 on the growth has been very fast—until well after World War
II. Population growth in Japan began around 1600 or so, that is, after
the end of the Civil Wars. It speeded up around 1800 and has continued
until well after World War II. But increasingly, in all developed
countries, the strategy of all institutions will have to be based, from
now on, on the totally different assumption of a shrinking population,
and especially of a shrinking young population.</p>
<p>An aging population—the demographic phenomenon that now preoccupies
economists, politicians and the public in all developed countries—is
nothing new. Life expectancies have been growing in the developed world
since the 18th and certainly since the 19th century. They have not even
been growing very much faster the last fifty years than they did in the
last hundred and fifty years. And we also know how to deal with the
problem. It will be difficult, painful, turbulent and terribly
unpopular, to be sure. But within the next twenty to thirty years the
retirement age in all developed countries will have to move up to around
seventy-nine or so—seventy-nine being the age that, in terms of both
life and health expectancies, corresponds to age sixty-five in 1936,
when the United States, the last Western country to do so, adopted a
national retirement plan (Social Security).</p>
<p>Similarly, there is nothing particularly new in the growth of the
population in the Third World. It largely parallels the growth of
population in the developed countries a hundred years earlier—it is not
even significantly faster. And the population growth in most of the
Third World is slowing down so fast that one can predict with near
certainty that population in the Third World—excepting perhaps only
India—will level off well before it reaches a crisis point. We know that
in terms of food and raw materials there is going to be no major crisis.
We know that clean water and clean air will present tremendous
problems—and that altogether population and environment will have to be
brought into balance. But that too is not as new a problem as most
people believe. In some places in Europe (e.g., the German Ruhr) the
problem was faced early in the 20th century and was solved then, and
quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p>What is, to repeat, totally unprecedented is the collapse of the
birthrate in the developed world.</p>
<p>Some of the implications are clear.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For the next twenty or thirty years demographics will dominate the
politics of all developed countries. And they will inevitably be
politics of great turbulence. No country is prepared for the issues.
Indeed, in no country are political factions and political parties
aligned around the issues that demographics pose. Is extending
retirement age “right” or “left”? Is encouraging older people to keep on
working past age sixty by exempting from taxes part or all of their
earned income “progressive” or “reactionary,” “Liberal” or
“Conservative”?</li>
</ol>
<p>But equally upsetting—perhaps even more so—will be the political
issue of immigration. The population decline in the developed and rich
countries is accompanied by population growth in most of the neighboring
and poor countries of the Third World—in the case of the United States,
in Central America and the Caribbean; in the case of Southern Europe, in
North Africa; in the case of Germany, a Third World Russia; in the case
of Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and mainland Southeast Asia. To
prevent immigration pressure is, however, very much like preventing the
law of gravity. Yet there is no more inflammatory issue than large-scale
immigration, especially from countries of different cultures and
religions. And the turbulence will, in all likelihood, be most severe in
Japan, in part because it still has the lowest retirement age, in part
because its labor market is totally inflexible, but also because Japan
has never before—at least not in her recorded history—allowed any
immigration whatsoever. Conversely, the problems are likely to be least
severe in the United States both because it is, after all, a country of
immigrants and because it has the most flexible labor markets. But even
in the United States the demographic changes are bound to create
enormous political emotions and to bring about totally new—and
unpredictable—political shifts.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>For the next twenty or thirty years no developed country is
likely, therefore, to have stable politics or a strong government.
Government instability is going to be the norm.</p></li>
<li><p>“Retirement” may come to mean two different things. It is quite
likely that the trend toward “early retirement” will continue. But it
will no longer mean that a person stops working. It will come to mean
that a person stops working full-time or as an employee for an
organization for the entire year rather than a few months at a time.
Employment relations—traditionally among the most rigid and most uniform
relationships—are likely to become increasingly heterogeneous and
increasingly flexible, at least for older people (on this see also
Chapters One and Six). This will increasingly be the case as the center
of gravity in the older population shifts from manual workers to people
who have never worked with their hands, and especially to knowledge
workers—a shift that will begin in the United States around the year
2010 when the babies of the “baby boom” which began in 1948 reach
traditional retirement age. For these babies were the first age cohort
in human history, a majority of which did not go into manual work but
increasingly into knowledge work. They are therefore also the first age
cohort in human history who, after thirty or forty years of full-time
work, are not physically worn out by hard manual labor but still, in the
great majority, perfectly capable to function and to work, both
physically and mentally.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Major innovations in work and employment are therefore already needed
in Europe and Japan. In the United States there may still be enough
young people to postpone radical changes until around 2010. Yet in all
likelihood the new employment relations are likely to be developed first
in the United States, again because it has the most flexible and least
restrictive labor markets and a tradition of experimentation by
individual employers as well as by individual employees.</p>
<p>In the United States, therefore, employing organizations—and by no
means only businesses—should start as soon as possible to experiment
with new work relationships with older people and especially with older
knowledge workers. The organization that first succeeds in attracting
and holding knowledge workers past traditional retirement age, and makes
them fully productive, will have a tremendous competitive advantage. In
any event the strategy of any organization should be based on the
assumption that twenty or thirty years hence, a large and growing part
of the work—including some of the organization’s most important
work—will be done by people who are past traditional working age; who
are not and should be neither “executives” nor “subordinates,” but have
no rank; who, above all, are not “employees” in the traditional sense
and certainly not full-timers coming to work in a corporate office every
day.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The final implication is that in all developed countries the
productivity of all workers—whether full-time or part-time—and
especially of all knowledge workers, will have to increase very rapidly
(on this see Chapter Five). Otherwise the country—and every organization
in it—will lose position and become steadily poorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what are the implications for the individual company in a
developed country?</p>
<p>The first question is whether the steady growth in the number of
older people will continue to provide market opportunities—and for how
long? In all developed countries older people have become the most
prosperous group in the society, with their postretirement incomes in
many cases substantially higher than their preretirement incomes. Their
numbers will continue to increase. But will their income stay high or go
down? And will they continue to spend as freely as they have been doing?
And—the biggest question mark—will they continue to want to be “young”
and spend accordingly? The answer to these questions will very largely
shape the consumer market in the developed countries and with it the
economy altogether.</p>
<p>And what does the shrinkage in the number of young people—and
especially of people under eighteen, that is, babies, children and
teenagers—mean for the economy and for the individual business? Is it
only a threat? Or may it also be an opportunity for a particular
institution?</p>
<p>That there will be fewer children might be seen as a tremendous
opportunity for upgrading schools everywhere. So far, Japan is the only
country that even understands that the crucial element in a country’s
ability to perform is the education of the small child, and that
therefore the elementary school teacher is the truly important part of
the educational establishment, and needs to be treated, to be respected
and to be paid as such.</p>
<p>But even for a business that makes its living making goods for small
children, the collapsing birthrate may be an opportunity. It is
conceivable that having fewer children means that the child becomes more
and more precious and that a larger share of the disposable income is
spent on it.</p>
<p>This apparently has already happened in the one country that has had
a shrinking birthrate as a national goal: China. The Chinese policy that
restricts a family to one child has been quite effective in the large
cities of China, where a majority of families have only one child. And
there many families, despite their poverty, apparently spend more on the
single child than they used to spend on three or four children. There
are signs in Germany, but also in Italy, of similar developments. And
even in the United States the middle-class family—where the birthrate is
already way down—is clearly spending a good deal more on its fewer
children. That it realized and exploited this underlay the tremendous
success of the Mattel Company with its expensive Barbie dolls.</p>
<p>The birthrate collapse has tremendous political and social
implications that we cannot even guess at today. But it surely will also
have tremendous economic and business implications—and some of those can
already be explored, some of them can already be tested. Above all, any
strategy, that is, any commitment of present resources to future
expectations—and this, to repeat, is what a strategy means—has to start
out with demo-graphics and, above all, with the collapsing birthrate in
the developed world. Of all developments, it is the most spectacular,
the most unexpected and one that has no precedent whatever.</p>
<p>II The Distribution of Income</p>
<p>Shifts in the shares of disposable income are just as important as
shifts in population, but usually even less attention is paid to them.
And they are likely—indeed all but certain—to be as dramatic as the
demographic changes during the first decades of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Businesses and industries have become highly conscious of their
market standing. They all keep figures on their sales and know whether
their sales go up or down. All of them know whether they grow in volume
or not. But practically none knows the truly important figure: the share
of the disposable income of their customers—whether other institutions
and businesses or ultimate consumers—that is being spent on the products
or services that they produce and sell. And practically no one knows
whether the share goes up or down.</p>
<p>Shares in disposable income are the foundation of all economic
information. In the first place, of all the outside information needed
by a business (see on this Chapter Four), it is usually the most easily
obtainable. It is usually also the most reliable foundation for
strategy. For as a rule, trends in the distribution of disposable income
that go to a certain product category or service category tend, once
established, to persist for long periods of time. They are usually
impervious even to the business cycle.</p>
<p>But for that reason, there are few more important changes for an
institution than a change in the trend. And equally important is a
change within the trend, that is, a switch from one kind of product or
service within a category to another product or service within the same
category.</p>
<p>And within the first decades of the 21st century there will be both
changes in the trends and changes within the trend. Yet neither
executives nor economists pay much attention to the distribution of the
shares of disposable income. In fact, most are totally ignorant of
them.</p>
<p>Practically all economists and the great majority of business
executives believe, for instance, that the great economic expansion of
the 20th century was driven by economic forces. It was not; on the
contrary, the share of disposable income allocated to economic
satisfaction has steadily dropped during this century in all developed
countries.</p>
<p>The four growth sectors during the 20th century were,
respectively:</p>
<p>• Government</p>
<p>• Health Care</p>
<p>• Education</p>
<p>• Leisure</p>
<p>with Leisure probably taking as much of the enormous expansion of
economic productivity and output as the other three together.</p>
<p>In 1900 the great majority of people in the developed countries still
worked at least sixty hours a week, fifty-one weeks a year—with about
eight holidays a year—and six days a week. By the end of the century the
great majority works fewer than forty hours a week—thirty-four or
thirty-five in Germany—and at most (in the United States) forty-seven
weeks a year (i.e., with about twelve holidays per year) and five days a
week—a drop from more than 3,000 hours a year to fewer than 1,500 hours
in Germany and to 1,850 hours in the hardest-working developed country,
the United States.</p>
<p>Of these four 20th-century growth sectors, Government probably has
the greatest impact on the distribution of disposable income. Not
because it is a major buyer or user of products and services; except in
wartime even the biggest government is only a marginal consumer. But the
main economic function of government in a developed country is to
redistribute between 30 and 50 percent of the country’s national income.
Nothing else has therefore as great an impact on the distribution of
shares of national income as changes in government policy.</p>
<p>The other three—Health Care, Education, Leisure—are all major users
of products and services, that is, of material goods. But none of them
provides material, and that means “economic,” satisfactions.</p>
<p>And all four are not in the “Free Market,” do not behave according to
the economist’s rules of supply and demand, are not particularly “price
sensitive” and altogether do not fit the economist’s model or behave
according to the economist’s theories.</p>
<p>And yet, together, they are well over half of a developed economy,
even of the most “capitalist” one.</p>
<p>The trends of these four sectors are therefore the first thing
strategy has to consider. And all four are certain to change greatly in
the next decades.</p>
<p>Government in its traditional form, that is, as collector and
redistributor of national income, is supposed to have stopped growing
(though the figures so far, especially in the United States and the UK,
do not support this belief). But governments in all developed
countries—despite all “privatization”—are rapidly acquiring new and very
powerful tools to influence—if not to control—the distribution of
disposable income: new regulations that control and direct economic
resources to new goals, for example, the environment. Strategy,
therefore, has to consider government the first concern in industry or
company strategy.</p>
<p>Leisure, by contrast, is “mature” and may be “declining.” In the
developed countries we are probably at the end of the steady cutting of
weekly hours. Indeed, these are signs that work hours are going up
again—especially in the United States and the UK. The leisure
market—next to armaments the 20th century’s fastest-growing
market—already shows the signs of a declining market: rapidly increasing
competition for time, that is, for the leisure market’s “purchasing
power”; sharply declining profit margins; and less and less true product
differentiation, for example, between going to the movies or looking at
a VCR on one’s own TV at home.</p>
<p>Both health care and education should continue to be major “growth
sectors”—demographics make reasonably sure of this. But both are certain
to undergo major shifts within the sector, for example, the shift,
discussed earlier, from schooling the young to the continued education
of highly schooled adult knowledge workers. And, probably, the shifts in
health care ahead of us—in every developed country—are going to be even
more radical and may happen even faster.</p>
<p>What do these developments in the 20th century’s growth sectors mean
for the 21st century’s strategy of an industry and of a particular
institution within it, whether a business, a university, a hospital, a
church?</p>
<p>The answer to this question first requires defining what makes an
industry a “growth” industry, a “mature” industry or a “declining”
industry. A growth industry is one in which the demand for its products,
whether goods or services, grows faster than national income and/or
population. An industry in which the demand for its products or services
grows as fast as national income and/or population is a “mature”
industry. And an industry in which the demand for its products or
services grows less fast than national income and/or population is a
“declining” industry, even if its absolute sales volume still continues
to grow.</p>
<p>The passenger-automobile industry of the world, for instance, has
been a declining industry for the last thirty or forty years. It was a
growth industry until 1960 or perhaps 1970. By that time Europe and
Japan had become fully motorized. Total sales of passenger cars the
world over are still growing worldwide, though only slowly. But they are
growing much less fast than either national income or population.</p>
<p>Similarly, since the First World War—and probably since 1900—the
share of disposable income in the developed countries, but altogether in
the world economy, that is being spent on commodities of all kinds has
been going down steadily at the rate of one-half of one percent per
annum compound—wartimes excepted. This has held true for both food and
industrial raw materials. This has meant that since 1900, the prices of
all commodities have trended downward over any period of time.</p>
<p>And the trend is still downward.</p>
<p>Mature or declining industries may turn around and again become
growth industries.</p>
<p>This may be the case of industries that produce transportation
materials, for example, locomotives or road-building equipment. In the
developed countries the existing transportation infrastructure has been
grossly undermaintained. In emerging and Third World countries it is
decades behind the needs of the economy and of the population—with
China, perhaps, the outstanding example. Will this lead to another
transportation boom such as fueled the economic expansion of the
mid-19th century? There are few signs of this so far—but it is one of
the trends to be watched.</p>
<p>For, to repeat, few things are as important for a strategy—both as
threat and as opportunity—as a change in the trend of the shares of
disposable income that such an upturn would represent.</p>
<p>The Present Growth Industries</p>
<p>But what are the present growth industries—and what can we learn from
them?</p>
<p>The world’s fastest-growing and most prosperous industry in the
closing thirty years of the 20th century has not been Information. It
has been Financial Services—but Financial Services the like of which did
not exist at any earlier time, that is, retail services to provide an
affluent, aging population in the developed countries with financial
products to provide retirement income. And the demographic changes
discussed earlier in this chapter largely underlie these new financial
services.</p>
<p>Increasingly in the developed countries the newly affluent
middle-class people, and especially those who do not work with their
hands but work as service or knowledge workers, realize when they reach
age forty-five or fifty that the existing retirement provisions are
unlikely to be adequate should they survive into old age. And thus,
beginning with age forty-five or fifty these people begin to look for
investments that will promise them financial security thirty years
hence.</p>
<p>This new growth industry is, however, quite different from the
traditional financial industry such as the “corporate banker,” a J. P.
Morgan for instance, a Citibank or a Goldman Sachs. The new investors
are not primarily interested in “making money” or in “deals.” Their main
concern is to maintain what little money they have as a cushion for
their retirement years. The institutions that understand this—mutual
funds, pension-fund managers and a few, mostly new, brokerage
houses—have prospered mightily, first in the United States, then in the
UK, and increasingly in Continental Europe and in the Japanese
markets.</p>
<p>Most of the traditional financial “giants” did not, how-ever,
understand that the very meaning of “financial services” has changed.
They only saw that “finance” takes a larger—a much larger—share of the
disposable income in the developed countries. They therefore rapidly
expanded their traditional “corporate” services. But actually the share
of these traditional financial services—major corporate loans or major
public offerings of corporate securities—is not growing. In all
likelihood it is shrinking, and quite fast. For this is primarily a
market of big companies. The growth sector in every developed
country—even Japan—in the last twenty years has, however, been mid-sized
businesses, with the share of big business going down steadily. And
mid-sized businesses typically are not customers for traditional
“corporate” financial services.</p>
<p>As a result the traditional financial giants have greatly
overexpanded worldwide. And as their legitimate corporate business
became less and less profitable—in part because there was increasingly
less of it, in part because competition for the pieces of the shrinking
pie has become fiercer and fiercer, driving down profits to the
vanishing point—these corporate-banking giants, American, British,
Japanese, German, French, Swiss, have increasingly resorted to “trading
for their own account,” that is, to outright speculation, so as to
support their swollen overheads. This, however, as centuries of
financial history teach (beginning with the Medici in 15th-century
Europe), has only one—but an absolutely certain—outcome: catastrophic
losses. And it is these losses resulting from a misreading of the trend
toward financial services as a major growth industry which in large
measure triggered the financial crisis that began in Asia in the
mid-nineties and is threatening to engulf the entire world economy.</p>
<p>The actual trend, that is, the growth of the new “retail finance” and
of the new investors, is, however, likely to continue despite the
crisis. At least it is likely to continue until developed societies have
adapted their retirement systems to the new demo-graphic realities
discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>Here is another example—and another lesson.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that what we call “information”—and what might be
more aptly called “Access to the World”—has been a major growth
industry, growing much faster in every developed or developing
country—and even in totally under-developed Third World countries—than
either national income or population. All of us hear “Electronics” or
“Computers” when we hear “Information.” But the number of printed books
published and sold in every developed country has gone up in the last
thirty or forty years as fast as the sales of the new electronics (on
this see Chapter Four). The world’s leading book publishing companies
may not have grown as fast as some of the top electronic companies such
as Intel and Microsoft in the United States or SAP in Germany, but they
have grown faster than the electronic-information industry in its
totality—and are arguably more profitable. And yet, though the United
States has been the world’s biggest and fastest-growing printed-book
market, no U.S. publisher saw this. As a result many American book
publishers are now owned by non-Americans (with Bertelsmann, Holtzbrinck
and Murdoch in the lead). And these firms increasingly dominate the
printed-book market in the rest of the world—and it is growing there
just as fast as in the United States, in Japan or in Europe (e.g.,
Bertelsmann’s book clubs in China).</p>
<p>Industries, whether businesses or nonbusinesses, have to be managed
differently depending on whether they are growth industries, mature
industries or declining industries. A growth industry that can count on
demand for its products or services growing faster than economy or
population manages to create the future. It needs to take the lead in
innovation and needs to be willing to take risks. A mature industry
needs to be managed to have a leadership position in a few, a very few,
but crucial areas, and especially in areas where the demand can be
satisfied at substantially lower cost by advanced technology or advanced
quality. And it needs to be managed for flexibility and rapid change. A
mature industry shifts from one way of satisfying wants to another. A
mature industry therefore needs to be managed for alliances,
partnerships and joint ventures to adapt rapidly to such shifts.</p>
<p>One example is the pharmaceutical industry. Until very recently—since
the invention of the sulfa drugs and the antibiotics just before World
War II—it was a leading growth industry. In the 1990s it became a mature
industry. This means with high probability that there will be fast and
sudden shifts to new ways of satisfying the old demands, for example,
from chemical drugs to genetics, molecular biology, medical electronics,
or even to “alternative medicine.”</p>
<p>In a declining industry one has to manage, above all, for steady,
systematic, purposeful cost reduction and for steady improvement in
quality and service, that is, for strengthening the company’s position
within the industry, rather than for growth in volume—which one can only
take away from somebody else. For in a declining industry it is more and
more difficult to establish meaningful product differentiation. Products
in a declining industry tend to become “commodities”—as is rapidly
happening with passenger automobiles (except so far for a few luxury
cars).</p>
<p>In conclusion, institutions—businesses as well as non-businesses—will
have to learn to base their strategy on their knowledge of, and
adaptation to, the trends in the distribution of disposable income and,
above all, to any shifts in this distribution. And they need both
quantitative information and qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>III Defining Performance</p>
<p>James Harrington (1611–1677), the Father of the English political
philosophy out of which grew Locke, Hume, Burke, and The Federalist
Papers, laid down in his book Oceania that “Power Follows Property.” It
was the shift in property from the great nobles to the country squires,
he argued, that explained the English Revolution of the 1640s, the
overthrow of absolute government and its replacement by the
parliamentary government of the new property owners, the local
gentry.</p>
<p>Demographics have, within the last fifty years, shifted property in
all developed countries. We now are beginning to see the resultant
shifts in power. Two developments—the emergence of an affluent (though
by no means rich) middle class of nonmanual workers, and the extension
of life expectancy—have led to the development of institutions such as
the pension funds and the mutual funds. And these are now the legal
“owners” of the key property in a modern, developed society, that is, of
the publicly owned corporations.</p>
<p>The development began in the United States (it was first described in
my 1975 book, The Unseen Revolution, reissued in 1993 as The Pension
Fund Revolution). As a result, institutions representing the future
pensioners now own at least 40 percent of American publicly listed
corporations, and probably more than 60 percent of the big ones. They
similarly own British business. And they are beginning to be the owners
of business in all other developed countries, Germany, France, Japan and
so on. And with that shift in property, we are seeing a shift in
power.</p>
<p>This underlies the present debate about the Governance of
Corporations, which is basically a debate concerning for whose benefit
businesses should be run. It underlies the dramatic shift to the
predominance of the “shareholder interest.” And a similar debate is
beginning to emerge in all other developed countries.</p>
<p>Till now it has not been the prevailing theorem in any country that a
business, and especially a large business, should be run exclusively—or
even primarily—in the interest of the shareholders. In the United
States, since the late 1920s, the prevailing theorem, however fuzzy,
held that the business should be run for a balance of
interests—customers, employees, share-holders and so on—which in fact
meant that it should not be accountable to anyone. Britain more or less
followed the same path. In Japan, Germany and Scandinavia, large
enterprises have been seen—and are still being seen—as being run
primarily to create and to maintain social harmony, which in effect
means that they are to be run in the interest of manual workers.</p>
<p>These traditional views are now obsolescent. But the emerging
American theorem that businesses should be run exclusively for the
short-term interest of the shareholders is also not tenable, and will
certainly have to be revised.</p>
<p>The future economic security of more and more people—that is, of the
people who can expect to live into old age—is increasingly dependent on
their economic investments—that is, on their income as owners. The
emphasis on performance as that which most benefits the shareholders
will therefore not go away. Immediate gains, whether in earnings or in
share price, are, however, not what they need. They need economic
returns twenty or thirty years hence. But at the same time, as Chapter
Five on the productivity of the knowledge worker explains, businesses
will increasingly have to satisfy the interests of their knowledge work
employees—or at least put these interests high enough to attract and to
hold the knowledge workers they need, and to make them productive.</p>
<p>Consequently, the employee for whose sake the traditional German or
Japanese company is supposed to be run, that is, the manual worker, will
increasingly be less and less important—and with it the traditional
emphasis on “social harmony” as the performance objective of business
enterprise, and especially of large enterprise.</p>
<p>The present debate about the Governance of Corporations is therefore
only a first skirmish. We will have to learn to establish new
definitions of what “performance” means in a given enterprise, and
especially in the large, publicly owned enterprise. We will have to
learn how to balance short-term results—which is what the present
emphasis on “shareholder value” amounts to—with the long-range
prosperity and survival of the enterprise. Even in purely financial
terms, we face something totally new: the need for an enterprise to
survive thirty or forty years, that is, to survive until its investors
are reaching pensionable age. This is a formidable goal—and so far quite
Utopian. The average life span of business enterprise, at least as a
successful organization, has never in the past been more than thirty
years. We will therefore have to learn to develop new concepts of what
“performance” means in an enterprise. We will have to develop new
measurements and so on. But at the same time performance will have to be
defined nonfinancially so as to be meaningful to the knowledge workers
and to generate “commitment” from them. And that is a nonfinancial, a
“value” return.</p>
<p>All institutions will therefore have to think through what
performance means. This used to be obvious and simple. It no longer is.
And strategy increasingly will have to be based on new definitions of
performance.</p>
<p>IV Global Competitiveness</p>
<p>All institutions have to make global competitiveness a strategic
goal. No institution, whether a business, a university or a hospital,
can hope to survive, let alone to succeed, unless it measures up to the
standards set by the leaders in its field, anyplace in the world.</p>
<p>One implication: It is no longer possible to base a business or a
country’s economic development on cheap labor. However low its wages, a
business—except for the smallest and most purely local one, for example,
a local restaurant—is unlikely to survive, let alone to prosper, unless
its workforce rapidly attains the productivity of the leaders of the
industry anyplace in the world. This is true particularly in
manufacturing. For in most manufacturing industries of the developed
world the cost of manual labor is rapidly becoming a smaller and smaller
factor—one-eighth of total costs or less. Low labor productivity
endangers a company’s survival. But low labor costs no longer give
enough of a cost advantage to offset low labor productivity.</p>
<p>This (as already said in Chapter One) also means that the economic
development model of the 20th century—the model first developed by Japan
after 1955 and then successfully copied by South Korea and Thailand—no
longer works. Despite their enormous surplus of young people qualified
only for unskilled manual work, emerging countries from now on will have
to base growth either on technological leadership (as did the United
States and Germany in the second half of the 19th century), or on
productivity equal to that of the world leaders in a given industry, if
not on themselves becoming the world’s productivity leaders.</p>
<p>The same is true for all areas: Design, Marketing, Finance,
Innovation—that is, for management altogether. Performance below the
world’s highest standards stunts, even if the costs are very low and
even if government subsidies are very high. And “Protection” no longer
protects, no matter how high the custom duties or how low the import
quotas.</p>
<p>Still, in all likelihood, we face a protectionist wave throughout the
world in the next few decades. For the first reaction to a period of
turbulence is to try to build a wall that shields one’s own garden from
the cold winds outside. But such walls no longer protect
institutions—and especially businesses—that do not perform up to world
standards. It will only make them more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The best example is Mexico, which for fifty years from 1929 on had a
deliberate policy of building its domestic economy independent of the
outside world. It did this not only by building high walls of
protectionism to keep foreign competition out. It did it—and this was
uniquely Mexican in the 20th-century world—by practically forbidding its
own companies to export. This attempt to create a modern but purely
Mexican economy failed dismally. Mexico actually became increasingly
dependent on imports, both of food and of manufactured products, from
the outside world. It was finally forced to open itself to the outside
world, since it simply could no longer pay for the needed imports. And
then Mexico found that a good deal of its industry could not
survive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Japanese tried to protect the bulk of their business
and industry by keeping the foreigners out while creating a small but
exceedingly competitive number of export industries—and then providing
these industries with capital at very low or no cost, thus giving them a
tremendous competitive advantage. That policy too has failed. The
present (1999) crisis in Japan is in large part the result of the
failure to make the bulk of Japanese business and industry (and
especially its financial industries) globally competitive.</p>
<p>Strategy, therefore, has to accept a new fundamental. Any
institution—and not just businesses—has to measure itself against the
standards set by each industry’s leaders anyplace in the world.</p>
<p>V The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Reality and Political
Reality</p>
<p>The final fundamental on which to base strategy in the period of
worldwide structural change and uncertainty is the growing incongruence
between economic reality and political reality.</p>
<p>The world economy is increasingly becoming global. National
boundaries are impediments and cost centers. As discussed in the first
chapter of this book, business—and increasingly many other institutions
as well—can no longer define their scope in terms of national economies
and national boundaries. They have to define their scope in terms of
industries and services worldwide.</p>
<p>But at the same time, political boundaries are not going to go away.
In fact, it is doubtful that even the new regional economic units, the
European Economic Community, the North American Free Trade Zone (NAFTA)
or Mercosur, the proposed economic community in South America, will
actually weaken political boundaries, let alone overcome them.</p>
<p>There has been talk about the “end of sovereignty” since well before
1918. But nothing has emerged yet to take the place of national
government and national sovereignty in political affairs. In fact, since
1914, the trend has been toward increasing splintering. Gone are the
empires that politically unified the largest areas of the world before
1914—Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire; the British, the French,
the Dutch; the Portuguese and the Belgian Empires; the Eurasian Empire
of Tsars and Communists. At the same time, small political units have
become economically viable because money and information have become
“transnational” (which actually means that they have no nationality
whatever). Since 1950 one mini-state after the other has come into
being, each with its own government, its own military, its own
diplomatic service, its own tax and fiscal policy and so on. So far
there are no signs yet of any global institutions, not even in the
economic sphere, for example, a global Central Bank controlling the
totally reckless flows of money worldwide, let alone a global
institution controlling tax and monetary policies worldwide.</p>
<p>Even within transnational economic units, national politics still
overrule economic rationality. Despite the European Economic Community,
for instance, it has proven all but politically impossible to close a
totally redundant plant in Belgium and shift the work to a French plant
of the same company only thirty miles away, but on the other side of a
national border.</p>
<p>We have in fact three overlapping spheres. There is a true global
economy of money and information. There are regional economies in which
goods circulate freely and in which impediments to the movement of
services and of people are being cut back, though by no means
eliminated. And then increasingly there are national and local
realities, which are both economic, but above all political. And all
three are growing fast. And businesses—and other institutions, for
example, universities—have no choice. They have to live and perform in
all spheres, and at the same time. This is the reality on which strategy
has to be based. But no management anyplace knows yet what this reality
actually means. They are all still groping.</p>
<p>Many—perhaps most—large multinationals in manufacturing, in finance,
in insurance have organized themselves into worldwide “business units”
across national boundaries. The leasing business of a financial services
company is, for example, run as one business, whether in Spain or in
Hong Kong. And it is run separately from any other business of the same
financial services company in Spain or in Hong Kong, for example, the
company’s foreign exchange business. But company after company has
learned that for the local government or the local labor union—or any
other local political agency—the “business unit” is a meaningless
fiction. For them Spain or Hong Kong are the only meaningful reality and
the Spanish or Hong Kong businesses of the company are therefore the
only units they perceive and accept and are willing to deal with. No
company I know has yet been able to figure out in advance what decision
and action can actually be handled as a decision or action of the
“business unit” and which will have to be handled as a “national”
one—let alone how to work out in advance how to make an action or a
decision fit both realities, the economic reality of the transnational
business unit and the political reality of Spanish or Hong Kong
“sovereignty.”</p>
<p>But some implications are already clear. First, it is clear what not
to do—that is, to be willing to be bribed to subordinate economic
decisions to local politics. Because the political unit is becoming
increasingly less powerful economically, it is increasingly tempted to
offer all kinds of bribes—exemption from taxes, for instance;
special-tariff protection; a guaranteed monopoly; all kinds of
subsidies, and so on—to obtain an economic advantage. A typical example
is the lavish subsidies given to European and Japanese automobile
companies by some Southeastern U.S. states to bribe the companies into
putting their new U.S. plants into the state. But of course there are
hundreds—and probably thousands—of additional examples.</p>
<p>And a good many of them are much worse examples. The European and
Japanese automobile companies had good economic reasons (at least they
thought so) to build plants in the United States. In many other
cases—for instance the bribes offered by small countries—the bribe is
the only reason for a company to go into a certain country or to bail
out a local company in trouble. It is absolutely predictable, however,
that a decision motivated by such a bribe rather than by economic
reality will turn into a disaster.</p>
<p>This is what happened, for instance, to every single manufacturing
plant put by a U.S. company in the 1960s and 1970s into a small Latin
American country, because that country’s government promised to give the
company a monopoly in the national market.</p>
<p>“There ain’t no bargains” is old folk wisdom. The first rule for a
business in managing the incongruence between economic reality and
political reality is therefore NOT to do anything that does not satisfy
economic reality. The first question has to be: “If we didn’t get the
bribe, would we do this as part of our business strategy?” If the answer
is “no,” don’t do it however tempting the bribe. It will be a costly
failure. But even if the answer is “yes,” it is almost certainly wise to
say “no” to the proffered bribe. All experience—and there is plenty of
it—indicates that, in the end, one pays and pays heavily for accepting
such bribes.</p>
<p>Closely related is another “Don’t.” Do not expand or grow globally by
going into businesses—especially not by acquisition—unless they fit into
the company’s Theory of the Business and its overall strategy.</p>
<p>In different regions or different countries, different products
and/or services will behave differently. In France, for instance, the
Coca-Cola Company does far better selling fruit juices than it does
selling carbonated Cokes. In Japan one of its major products is coffee
dispensed in vending machines. But both fruit juices and prepared coffee
fit Coca-Cola’s Theory of the Business and its strategy. Physically they
are different from the original Coke. In every other aspect, that is, as
businesses, they are exactly the same.</p>
<p>To repeat something said earlier in this chapter: A strategy enables
an institution to be purposefully opportunistic. If what looks like an
opportunity does not advance the strategic goal of the institution, it
is not an opportunity. It is a distraction. Even if it fits—or seems to
fit—a particular national, that is, political, reality, it is still a
distraction and is to be left alone. Otherwise it is practically bound
to end in failure.</p>
<p>So much for the “Don’ts.” And now the two “Do’s” we already know.</p>
<p>Business growth and business expansion in different parts of the
world will increasingly not be based on mergers and acquisitions or even
on starting new, wholly owned businesses there. They will increasingly
have to be based on alliances, partnerships, joint ventures and all
kinds of relations with organizations located in other political
jurisdictions. They will, in other words, increasingly have to be based
on structures that are economic units and not legal—and therefore not
political—units.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons—some of them discussed earlier—that
growth henceforth will be based on partnerships of all sorts rather than
on outright ownership and command and control. But in all likelihood one
of the most compelling ones will be the need to operate in both a global
world economy and a splintered world polity. A partnership is by no
means a perfect solution to this problem. In fact, partnerships have
enormous problems of their own. But at least the conflict between
economic reality and legal reality is greatly lessened if the economic
unit is not also a legal unit, but is a partnership, an alliance, a
joint venture that is a relationship in which political and legal
appearance can be separated from economic reality.</p>
<p>The final implication: All businesses will have to learn to manage
their currency exposure. Every business, even a purely local one, is in
the world economy today. As such, it is subject to currency fluctuations
even if it does not sell outside its own country, or does not buy
outside it.</p>
<p>Even the most provincial and most local Mexican company was severely
hit by the sudden collapse of the Mexican peso a few years ago. Even the
most purely local Indonesian company was severely hit by the sudden
collapse of the Indonesian currency in 1998.</p>
<p>There is no country today that is immune to sudden currency
fluctuations—for the simple reason that the world is awash in “virtual
money,” that is, in liquidity for which there is no profitable
investment. Every country, therefore, is awash in money that is not
invested in property, in businesses, in manufacturing or in service
enterprises, but kept in liquid and volatile “portfolio” investment. And
very few countries have enough of a surplus in their balance of payments
to service the interest on this “portfolio investment,” let alone to pay
it out should it take flight. Every country’s currency, in other words,
is at the mercy of short-term movements of money for which there may not
be any economic rationale whatever.</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of what was expected in 1973 when
President Nixon cut the dollar loose from any fixed value and made it
“float.” The idea then was that this would limit currency fluctuations
to minor adjustments. But because governments—beginning with the
American government—grossly abused this new “freedom,” currencies have
become extremely unstable. They can be expected to continue to remain
unstable. There is practically no reason to expect that the political
units, that is, the various nations, will subordinate their fiscal,
monetary and credit policies to any but their own political authority.
It is to be hoped that the new European Bank will be able to maintain
the Euro stable as a regional currency. But it is much too much to hope
that the individual countries within the European unions will then
subordinate their domestic policies to the stability of the Euro.</p>
<p>In other words, strategy has to be based on the assumption that
currencies will continue to be volatile and unstable. One implication of
this is that every management will have to learn what so far few
managements can do: manage their foreign exchange exposure.</p>
<p>The realities discussed in this chapter do not tell an institution
what to do, let alone how to do it. They raise the questions to which
strategy has to find the answers for the individual institution. And
there are questions that strategy so far has rarely, if ever,
considered. But unless an institution starts out by considering these
new realities, it will not have a strategy. It will not be prepared for
the challenges that the next few years, if not the next few decades, are
certain to raise. Unless these challenges can be met successfully, no
enterprise can expect to succeed, let alone to prosper, in a period of
turbulence, of structural change and of economic, social, political and
technological transformation.</p>

<p>One Cannot Manage Change •Change Policies •Organized Improvement
•Exploiting Success •Creating Change •Windows of Opportunity •What Not
to Do •Piloting •The Change Leader’s Two Budgets •Change and
Continuity</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>One Cannot Manage Change</p>
<p>One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it.</p>
<p>We do not hear much anymore about “overcoming resistance to change,”
which ten or fifteen years ago was one of the most popular topics of
management books and management seminars. Everybody has accepted by now
that “change is unavoidable.” But this still implies that change is like
“death and taxes”: It should be postponed as long as possible, and no
change would be vastly preferable.</p>
<p>But in a period of upheavals, such as the one we are living in,
change is the norm. To be sure, it is painful and risky, and above all
it requires a great deal of very hard work. But unless it is seen as the
task of the organization to lead change, the organization—whether
business, university, hospital and so on—will not survive. In a period
of rapid structural change, the only ones who survive are the Change
Leaders.</p>
<p>It is therefore a central 21st-century challenge for management that
its organization become a change leader. A change leader sees change as
opportunity. A change leader looks for change, knows how to find the
right changes and knows how to make them effective both outside the
organization and inside it. This requires:</p>
<p>1 Policies to make the future.</p>
<p>2 Systematic methods to look for and to anticipate change.</p>
<p>3 The right way to introduce change, both within and outside the
organization.</p>
<p>4 Policies to balance change and continuity.</p>
<p>It is with these four requirements for being a change leader that
this chapter concerns itself.</p>
<p>I Change Policies</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about “the innovative
organization.” But making an organization more receptive to
innovation—even organizing it for innovation—is not nearly enough to be
a change leader. It might even be a distraction. For to be a change
leader requires the willingness and ability to change what is already
being done just as much as to do new and different things. It requires
policies to make the present create the future.</p>
<p>The first policy—and the foundation for all the others—is to abandon
yesterday. The first need is to free resources from being committed to
maintaining what no longer contributes to performance, and no longer
produces results. In fact, it is not possible to create tomorrow unless
one first sloughs off yesterday. To maintain yesterday is always
difficult and extremely time-consuming. To maintain yesterday therefore
always commits the institution’s scarcest and most valuable
resources—and above all, its ablest people—to nonresults. Yet to do
anything different—let alone to innovate—always runs into unexpected
difficulties. It therefore always demands leadership by people of high
and proven ability. And if these people are committed to maintaining
yesterday, they are simply not available to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>The first change policy, therefore, throughout the entire
institution, has to be Organized Abandonment.</p>
<p>The change leader puts every product, every service, every process,
every market, every distribution channel, every customer and end-use, on
trial for its life. And it does so on a regular schedule. The question
has to be asked—and asked seriously—“If we did not do this already,
would we, knowing what we now know, go into it?” If the answer is “no,”
the reaction must not be “Let’s make another study.” The reaction must
be “What do we do now?” The enterprise is committed to change. It is
committed to action.</p>
<p>In three cases the right action is always outright abandonment.</p>
<p>Abandonment is the right action if a product, service, market or
process “still has a few good years of life.” It is these dying
products, services or processes that always demand the greatest care and
the greatest efforts. They tie down the most productive and ablest
people. But also we almost always over-estimate how much “life” there is
still in the old product, service, market or process. Usually they are
not “dying”; they are dead. And as an old medical proverb has it, “There
is nothing as difficult and as expensive, but also nothing as futile, as
to try to keep a corpse from stinking.”</p>
<p>But equally a product, service, market or process should be abandoned
if the only argument for keeping it is: “It’s fully written off.” To
treat assets as being fully written off has its place in tax accounting,
but nowhere else. For management purposes there are no “cost-less
assets.” There are only “sunk costs,” the economist’s term for buildings
and other fixed investments. The question is never: “What have they
cost?” The question is: “What will they produce?” And assets that no
longer produce except in accounting terms, that is, assets which produce
only because they appear not to “cost” anything, are not assets. There
are only sunk costs.</p>
<p>The third case where abandonment is the right policy—and the most
important one—is the old and declining product, service, market or
process for the sake of maintaining which, the new and growing product,
service or process is being stunted or neglected.</p>
<p>One recent example of what not to do is how the future was sacrificed
in the nineties, on the altar of yesterday, by America’s largest
automobile manufacturer, General Motors, and America’s largest union of
factory workers, the United Automobile Workers Union (UAW).</p>
<p>Everybody in the United States knows that the Japanese automobile
makers acquired 30 percent of the U.S. passenger-car market in ten short
years from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties. But few realize that
none of this gain was at the expense of America’s two smaller
manufacturers, Ford and Chrysler—on the contrary, both actually gained
market share. One-third of the Japanese gain was at the expense of
Germany’s Volkswagen, which had a market share of 10 percent in the
seventies but had lost practically all of it ten years later to the
Japanese. Two-thirds of the Japanese gain—a hefty 20 percent of the
American market—was, however, General Motors’ loss; its market share
slumped from 50 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p>For fifteen years General Motors did nothing except fiddle with
prices and discounts—none to any effect. Then, finally, in the late
1980s it decided to counterattack—with a new car called the “Saturn.”
The Saturn is little but a slightly more costly imitation of the
Japanese—in its styling, its manufacturing and marketing, its service
and its labor relations. And GM badly bungled its market introduction.
Still it was a smash hit since a great many people in the United States
were hungry for an American-made car of the new kind.</p>
<p>But, as almost everyone outside GM immediately realized, the Saturn
did not compete with the Japanese makes. All its sales came at the
expense of declining—if not dying—GM brands such as Oldsmobile and
Buick. And then GM—and even more so GM’s labor union, the United
Automobile Workers—began to throttle the Saturn. It was denied money for
expansion—that money went instead into futile attempts to “modernize”
Oldsmobile and Buick plants. It was denied money to develop new
models—again that money went into Oldsmobile and Buick redesigns. And
the UAW began to whittle away at the Saturn’s new and successful labor
relations for fear that Saturn’s example in building management-labor
partnerships might spread to GM’s other plants.</p>
<p>Neither Oldsmobile nor Buick has benefited. Both are still going
downhill. But the Saturn has been all but destroyed. And both GM and the
UAW have continued their decline.</p>
<p>Abandonment may take different forms.</p>
<p>In the GM cases, for instance, one possible solution might have been
to do simultaneously two things: (1) kill the dying Oldsmobile and (2)
run with Saturn’s success as hard as possible, give it all the money and
people it needed but set it up as a separate company free to compete
aggressively with all of GM’s old products and for all of GM’s old
customers.</p>
<p>The right answer may even be to do more of the same but to do it
differently.</p>
<p>One example: Every book publisher knows that the bulk of its sales
(some 60 percent)—and practically all of its profits—come from the
“backlist,” that is, from titles that have been out more than a year or
two. But no book publisher puts resources into selling the backlist. All
the efforts are put into selling the new titles. A major publishing firm
had tried for years to get its salespeople to sell the backlist without
any success; and it also did not itself spend a penny on promoting it.
Then one outside director asked: “Would we handle the backlist the way
we do if we went into it now?” And when the answer was a unanimous “no,”
she asked: “What do we do now?” As a result the firm reorganized itself
into two separate units: one buying, editing, promoting and selling the
new titles published in the current year; one promoting and selling the
backlist. Within two years backlist sales had almost tripled—and the
firm’s profits doubled.</p>
<p>How to act on abandonment is thus the second question. It is as
important as the first one. It is actually more controversial and more
difficult. The answer should therefore always be tested on a small scale
or piloted (see a later section of this chapter).</p>
<p>In a period of rapid change the “How?” is likely to become obsolete
faster than the “What?” The change leader must therefore also ask of
every product, service, market or process: “If we were to go into this
now, knowing what we now know, would we go into it the way we are doing
it now?” And this question needs to be asked of the successful product,
service, market and process as regularly—and as seriously—as of the
unsuccessful product, service, market or process.</p>
<p>This applies to all areas of the enterprise. But it applies with
particular force to an area that many enterprises tend to neglect, if
not to ignore: distributors and distribution channels. In a time of
rapid change distributors and distribution channels tend to change
faster than anything else. And it is also on distributors and
distribution channels that the “Information Revolution” is likely to
have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>The terms “distributors” and “distribution channels” are of course
business terms. But every institution has “distributors.” And they are
every institution’s first “customers.”</p>
<p>Here is a nonbusiness example:</p>
<p>The high school placement counselor has been the “distribution
channel” through whom American universities and colleges have
traditionally reached prospective applicants for admission. But
increasingly potential students and their parents look for information
to ratings of colleges and universities published in a number of
magazines, to books describing and rating different colleges and so on.
Several major American universities have substantially increased the
quantity and the quality of their applicants by focusing their
promotional efforts on these new distribution channels—without
necessarily cutting back on “selling” to the high school placement
counselor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the health maintenance organization (HMO) has increasingly
become the “distribution channel” for hospitals, where, only ten years
ago, the hospital distribution channel was the physician. Increasingly,
hospitals are therefore working with HMOs to reach both physician and
patient.</p>
<p>So far, we can only speculate on the impact the Internet will have on
distribution. But it will have impact. One example of what is already
happening, and happening fast, is the American automobile market.</p>
<p>It has been known for a long time that the wife makes the decision
about what cars not to buy. She, in effect, therefore makes the buying
decisions. But the wife, as has also been known for a long time, does
not like to shop at the automobile dealer. Hence, it is the husband who
appears as the buyer when the couple visits the dealer—even though the
actual decision has already been made, and made by the wife. The
Internet enables the woman to do the actual buying—the dealer is rapidly
becoming no more than an “outlet.”</p>
<p>Hence the automobile industry faces the task of making the Internet
its distribution channel—General Motors is known already to work on
this. But does that mean abandoning the traditional automobile
dealer?</p>
<p>“To Abandon What” and “To Abandon How” have to be practiced
systematically. Otherwise they will always be “postponed,” for they are
never “popular” policies.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how successful abandonment policies can be
organized.</p>
<p>In one fairly big company offering outsourcing services in most
developed countries, the first Monday morning of every month is set
aside for an abandonment meeting at every management level from top
management to the supervisors in each area. Each of these sessions
examines one part of the business—one of the services one Monday, one of
the regions in which the company does business a month later, the way
this or that service is organized the Monday morning of the third month
and so on. Within the year, the company this way examines itself
completely, including its personnel policies, for instance. In the
course of a year three to four major decisions are likely to be made on
the “what” of the company’s services and perhaps twice as many decisions
to change the “how.” But also each year three to five ideas for new
things to do come out of these sessions. These decisions to change
anything—whether to abandon something, whether to abandon the way
something is being done or whether to do something new—are reported each
month to all members of management. And twice a year all management
levels report on what has actually happened as a result of their
sessions, what action has been taken and with what results.</p>
<p>Since this company first began organized abandonment eight or nine
years ago, it has grown more than four-fold (adjusted for inflation). It
attributes at least half of this growth to its systematic abandonment
policies.</p>
<p>Organized Improvement</p>
<p>The next policy for the change leader is organized improvement (what
the Japanese call “Kaizen”).</p>
<p>Whatever an enterprise does internally and externally needs to be
improved systematically and continuously: product and service,
production processes, marketing, service, technology, training and
development of people, using information. And it needs to be improved at
a preset annual rate: In most areas, as the Japanese have shown, an
annual improvement rate of 3 percent is realistic and achievable.</p>
<p>However, continuing improvement requires a major decision. What
constitutes “performance” in a given area? If performance is to be
improved—and that is, of course, what continuous improvement aims at—we
need to define clearly what “performance” means.</p>
<p>One example: complex and difficult products in which the rejection
rate is high. To improve a rejection rate of 40 percent of a finished
product to one of 35 percent is quite obviously a substantial
improvement. But in most other areas the decision is by no means that
simple. What is “quality” in a product? To what extent is it defined by
the producer? To what extent can it only be defined by the customer?
Even more difficult very often is the definition of performance in
services.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>A major commercial bank decided that the way to improve performance
in its branches was to offer new and more advanced financial “products,”
for example, selling Treasury bonds or giving advice on handling debt.
It spent a great deal of time and money researching what kinds of
financial products customers might want, developing these products and
training its branch personnel to deliver them. But when the bank
introduced the new products in its branches, it rapidly lost customers.
Only then did the bank find out that to customers, performance of a bank
branch means not having to wait in line for routine transactions. The
additional “products” were valuable, the customers thought, but they
only needed them once in a while.</p>
<p>The bank’s solution was to concentrate the tellers at the branches on
the simple, repetitive, routine services, which require neither skill
nor time. The new financial products were assigned to different groups
of people who were moved to separate tables, with big signs advertising
the products in which each table specialized. As soon as this was done,
business went up sharply, both for the traditional and the new services.
But because there had been no “pilot”—trying out the improvements in one
or two branches would have sufficed—the bank lost almost two years and a
great deal of money.</p>
<p>Continuous improvements in any area eventually transform the
operation. They lead to product innovation. They lead to service
innovation. They lead to new processes. They lead to new businesses.
Eventually continuous improvements lead to fundamental change.</p>
<p>Exploiting Success</p>
<p>The next policy chat the change leader needs to develop is the
exploitation of success.</p>
<p>It is only seventy or eighty years since the “monthly report” was
invented and introduced in most business organizations. By now it is
routine and standard practically everywhere. Almost without exception
this report, on its first page, presents the areas in which results fall
below expectations, or in which expenditures exceed budget. It focuses
on problems. In the monthly operating committee meeting, which also has
become routine and standard in practically all enterprises—and by no
means only in businesses—it is this report on the problems that is being
discussed, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Problems cannot be ignored. And serious problems have to be taken
care of. But to be change leaders, enterprises have to focus on
opportunities. They have to starve problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>This requires a small but fundamental procedural change: an
additional “first page” to the monthly report, and one that should
precede the page that shows the problems. It requires a page that
focuses on where results are better than expected, whether in terms of
sales, revenues, profits or volume. As much time then should be spent on
this new first page as has traditionally been spent on the problem page.
In some organizations that have successfully organized themselves to be
change leaders, the opportunity page is given its own full morning or
its own full day, with a second full morning or full day then devoted to
the problems.</p>
<p>Enterprises that succeed in being change leaders make sure that they
staff the opportunities.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to list the opportunities on one page, and then
to list the organization’s performing and capable people on another
page. Then one allocates the ablest and most performing people to the
top opportunities.</p>
<p>This implies that the first—and usually the best—opportunity for
successful change is to exploit one’s own successes and to build on
them.</p>
<p>The best example, perhaps, is the Japanese company Sony. It has built
itself into one of the world’s leaders in a number of major businesses
by systematically exploiting one success after the other—big or
small.</p>
<p>All of Sony’s consumer electronics—the business in which it is the
world leader and best known—are based on a product that was not even
invented by Sony: the tape recorder. One success of a Sony product based
on the tape recorder is used to design the next product and then another
product based on the success of that product and so on. No step was a
big one. And not all of them were successful. But by exploiting success,
each of these additional new products carried very little risk—so that
even when it did not succeed there was not too much damage. And enough
of them were successful to make Sony into one of the world’s largest,
but also one of the world’s most consistently successful,
enterprises.</p>
<p>Another example is the medical electronics group of the American
General Electric Company. In a highly competitive field it has emerged
as the largest and most successful manufacturer, but also as a change
leader. It has done so apparently by exploiting its successes, and by
building on each success another product—often with only a fairly minor
change, but one that presents a significant improvement for physician or
hospital.</p>
<p>As in a continuous improvement, exploitation will, sooner or later,
lead to genuine innovation. There comes a point when the small steps of
exploitation result in a major, fundamental change, that is, in
something that is genuinely new and different.</p>
<p>II Creating Change</p>
<p>The last policy for the change leader to build into the enterprise is
a systematic policy of INNOVATION, that is, a policy to create
change.</p>
<p>It is the area to which most attention is being given today. It may,
however, not be the most important one—organized abandonment,
improvement, exploiting success may be more productive for a good many
enterprises. And without these policies—abandonment, improvement,
exploitation—no organization can hope to be a successful innovator.</p>
<p>But to be a successful change leader an enterprise has to have a
policy of systematic innovation. And the main reason may not even be
that change leaders need to innovate—though they do. The main reason is
that a policy of systematic innovation produces the mindset for an
organization to be a change leader. It makes the entire organization see
change as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Windows of Opportunity</p>
<p>This requires a systematic policy to look, every six to twelve
months, for changes that might be opportunities—in the areas that I call
“the windows of opportunity”:</p>
<p>• The organization’s own unexpected successes and unexpected
failures, but also the unexpected successes and unexpected failures of
the organization’s competitors.</p>
<p>• Incongruities, especially incongruities in the process, whether of
production or distribution, or incongruities in customer behavior.</p>
<p>• Process needs.</p>
<p>• Changes in industry and market structures.</p>
<p>• Changes in demographics.</p>
<p>• Changes in meaning and perception.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>• New knowledge.*</p>
<p>A change in any one of these areas raises the question: “Is this an
opportunity for us to innovate, that is, to develop different products,
services, processes? Does it indicate new and different markets and/or
customers? New and different technologies? New and different
distribution channels?” Innovation can never be risk-free. But if
innovation is based on exploiting what has already happened—in the
enterprise itself, in its markets, in knowledge, in society, in
demographics and so on—it is far less risky than not to innovate by
exploiting these opportunities.</p>
<p>Innovation is not “flash of genius.” It is hard work. And this work
should be organized as a regular part of every unit within the
enterprise, and of every level of management.</p>
<p>What Not to Do</p>
<p>There are Three Traps to avoid into which change leaders fall again
and again.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first trap is an innovation opportunity that is not in tune with
the strategic realities discussed in Chapter Two of this book.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is most unlikely to work. The only innovation likely to succeed is
one that fits these major realities—of demographics, of the changes in
the distribution of income, of the way the institution itself and its
customers define “performance,” of global competitiveness or of
political and economic realities. But the “misfit” opportunity often
looks very tempting—precisely because it looks truly “innovative.” But
even if not resulting in failure—as it usually does—it always requires
extraordinarily wasteful amounts of effort, money and time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The second trap is to confuse “novelty” with “innovation.” The
test of an innovation is that it creates value. A novelty only creates
amusement. Yet, again and again, managements decide to innovate for no
other reason than that they are bored doing the same thing or making the
same product day in and day out. The test of an innovation—as is also
the test of “quality”—is not: “Do we like it?” It is: “Do customers want
it and will they pay for it?”</p></li>
<li><p>And the third trap: confusing motion with action. Typically when
a product, service or process no longer produces results and should be
abandoned or changed radically, management “reorganizes.” To be sure,
reorganization is often needed. But it comes after the action, that is,
after the “what” and the “how” have been faced up to. By itself
reorganization is just “motion” and no substitute for action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three traps are so attractive that every change leader can
expect to fall into one of them—or into all three—again and again. There
is only one way to avoid them, or to extricate oneself if one has
stumbled into them: to organize the Introduction of Change, that is, to
PILOT.</p>
<p>III Piloting</p>
<p>Enterprises of all kinds increasingly use all kinds of market
research and customer research to limit, if not eliminate, the risks of
change. But one cannot market research the truly new. But also nothing
new is right the first time. Invariably, problems crop up that nobody
even thought of. Invariably, problems that loom very large to the
originator turn out to be trivial or not to exist at all. Above all, the
way to do the job invariably turns out to be different from what is
originally designed. It is almost a “law of nature” that anything that
is truly new, whether product or service or technology, finds its major
market and its major application not where the innovator and
entrepreneur expected, and not for the use for which the innovator or
entrepreneur has designed the product, service or technology. And that,
no market or customer research can possibly discover.</p>
<p>The best example is an early one.</p>
<p>The improved steam engine that James Watt (1736–1819) designed and
patented in 1776 is the event which, for most people, signifies the
advent of the Industrial Revolution. Actually, Watt until his death saw
only one use for the steam engine: to pump water out of coal mines. That
was the use for which he had designed it. And he sold it only to coal
mines. It was his partner Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) who is the real
father of the Industrial Revolution. Boulton saw that the improved steam
engine could be used in what was then England’s premier industry,
textiles, and especially in the spinning and weaving of cotton. Within
ten or fifteen years after Boulton had sold his first steam engine to a
cotton mill, the price of cotton textiles had fallen by 70 percent. And
this created both the first mass market and the first factory—and
together modern capitalism and the modern economy altogether.</p>
<p>Neither studies nor market research nor computer modeling are a
substitute for the test of reality. Everything improved or new needs
therefore first to be tested on a small scale, that is, it needs to be
PILOTED.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to find somebody within the enterprise who
really wants the new. As said before, everything new gets into trouble.
And then it needs a champion. It needs somebody who says: “I am going to
make this succeed,” and who then goes to work on it. And this person
needs to be somebody whom the organization respects. This need not even
be somebody within the organization. A good way to pilot a new product
or new service is often to find a customer who really wants the new, and
who is willing to work with the producer on making truly successful the
new product or the new service.</p>
<p>If the pilot test is successful—if it finds the problems nobody
anticipated but also finds the opportunities that nobody anticipated,
whether in terms of design, of market, of service—the risk of change is
usually quite small. And it is usually also quite clear where to
introduce the change, and how to introduce it, that is, what
entrepreneurial strategy to employ.</p>
<p>The Change Leader’s Two Budgets</p>
<p>Finally, successful change leadership requires appropriate accounting
and budget policies. It requires TWO separate budgets.</p>
<p>In most enterprises—and again not just in businesses—there is only
one budget, and it is adjusted to the business cycle. In good times
expenditures are increased across the board. In bad times expenditures
are cut across the board. This, however, practically guarantees missing
out on the future.</p>
<p>The change leader’s first budget is an operating budget that shows
the expenditures to maintain the present business. This is normally 80
to 90 percent or so of all expenditures.</p>
<p>That budget should always be approached with the question: “What is
the minimum we need to spend to keep operations going?” And in poor
times it should, indeed, be adjusted downward (though in good times most
of it, probably, should not be adjusted upward, and certainly no more
than volume and/or revenues increase).</p>
<p>And then the change leader has a second, separate budget for the
future. This budget remains stable throughout good times and bad times.
It rarely amounts to more than 10 or 12 percent of an enterprise’s total
expenditures—and again this applies to nonbusinesses as well as to
businesses.</p>
<p>Very few of the expenditures for the future produce results unless
maintained at a stable level over substantial periods. This goes for
work on new products, new services and new technologies; for the
development of markets and customers and distribution channels, and
above all, for the development of people.</p>
<p>The future budget should be approached with the question: “What is
the maximum this activity can absorb to produce optimal results?” That
amount should be maintained in good times or bad—unless times are so
catastrophic that maintaining expenditures threatens the survival of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>But the future budget also should include expenditures to exploit
success. The most common, but also the most damaging, practice is to cut
back on expenditures for successes, especially in poor times, so as to
maintain expenditures for ongoing operations, and especially
expenditures to maintain the past. The argument is always: “This
product, service or technology is a success anyhow; it doesn’t need to
have more money put into it.” But the right argument is: “This is a
success, and therefore should be supported to the maximum possible.” And
it should be supported especially in bad times when the competition is
likely to cut spending and therefore likely to create an opening.</p>
<p>We tend to manage according to the reports we receive and see. This
explains why it is important for the change leader to have reports
focusing on the areas in which the enterprise does better than expected,
the areas of unexpected success, and therefore the areas of potential
opportunity. It also explains why it is crucially important for the
change leader to have a budget that embodies the commitment to making
the future and to be ahead of change.</p>
<p>IV Change and Continuity</p>
<p>The traditional institution is designed for continuity. All existing
institutions, whether businesses, universities, hospitals or churches,
therefore have to make special efforts to be receptive to change and to
be able to change. It also explains why existing institutions face
resistance to change. Change for the traditional institution is, so to
speak, a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Change leaders are, however, designed for change. And yet they still
require continuity. People need to know where they stand. They need to
know the people with whom they work. They need to know what they can
expect. They need to know the values and the rules of the organization.
They do not function if the environment is not predictable, not
understandable, not known. But continuity is equally needed outside the
enterprise. In fact, we are learning increasingly the importance of
long-term relationships. To be able to change rapidly, one needs close
and continuous relationships with suppliers and distributors. But the
enterprise also has to have a “personality” that identifies it among its
customers and in its markets—and again this is true as much of
nonbusinesses as of businesses.</p>
<p>Change and continuity are thus poles rather than opposites. The more
an institution is organized to be a change leader, the more it will need
to establish continuity internally and externally, the more it will need
to balance rapid change and continuity.</p>
<p>This balance will predictably be one of the major concerns of
tomorrow’s management—both of the practitioners and of the scholars and
writers on management. But we do know already a good deal about how to
create it. Some institutions already are change leaders and have tackled
the problem—though not always solved it.</p>
<p>One way is to make partnership in change the basis of continuing
relationships. This is what the Japanese “Keiretsu” has done with
respect to the relationship between supplier and manufacturer, and what
is now adopted fast in American business through “Economic-Chain
Accounting” (discussed in the next chapter of this book). We are
developing similar partnerships in change as the basis of continuing
relationships between manufacturer and distributor, for example, between
Procter andandandand Gamble, the world’s largest producer of household
needs, and large retailers such as Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>But relationships within the enterprise (as discussed earlier in
Chapter One) are also increasingly going to be partnerships—with
employees of the organization, with people who work for an outsourcing
firm but who are actually members of the enterprise’s own working teams,
or with outside, independent contractors. And again, these relations
need increasingly to be organized as long-term partnerships in the
process of change.</p>
<p>Balancing change and continuity requires continuous work on
information. Nothing disrupts continuity and corrupts relationships more
than poor or unreliable information (except, perhaps, deliberate
misinformation). It has to become routine for any enterprise to ask at
any change, even the most minor one: “Who needs to be informed of this?”
And this will become more and more important as people no longer
necessarily work next door to one another and see one another half a
dozen times a day. The more enterprises come to rely on people working
together without actually working together—that is, on people using the
new technologies of information—the more important it will become to
make sure that they are fully informed.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will also become more and more important for
these people to get together and actually meet one another and work with
one another on an organized, systematic, scheduled basis. Long-distance
information does not replace face-to-face relationships. It makes them
actually more important. It makes it more important for people to know
what to expect of one another. It makes it more important for people to
know how the other person actually behaves. It makes it more important
to have trust in one another. And this means both systematic
information—and especially information about any change—and organized
face-to-face relationships, that is, opportunities to get to know one
another and to understand one another.</p>
<p>Information is particularly important when the change is not a mere
improvement, but something truly new. It has to be a firm rule in any
enterprise that wants to be successful as a change leader, that there
are no surprises. Above all, there is need for continuity in respect to
the fundamentals of the enterprise: its mission, its values, its
definition of performance and results. Precisely because change is a
constant in the change leader’s enterprise, the foundations have to be
extra strong.</p>
<p>Finally, the balance between change and continuity has to be built
into compensation, recognition and rewards. We long ago learned that an
organization will not innovate unless innovators are properly rewarded.
We long ago learned that a business in which successful innovators do
not make it into senior management, let alone into top management, will
not innovate. We will have to learn, similarly, that an organization
will have to reward continuity—by considering, for instance, people who
deliver continuing improvement to be as valuable to the organization,
and as deserving of recognition and reward, as the genuine
innovator.</p>
<p>V Making the Future</p>
<p>One thing is certain for developed countries—and probably for the
entire world: We face long years of profound changes. The changes are
not primarily economic changes. They are not even primarily
technological changes. They are changes in demo-graphics, in politics,
in society, in philosophy and, above all, in world-view. Economic theory
and economic policy are unlikely to be effective by themselves in such a
period. And there is no social theory for such a period either. Only
when such a period is over, decades later, are theories likely to be
developed to explain what has happened. But a few things are certain in
such a period. It is futile, for instance, to try to ignore the changes
and to pretend that tomorrow will be like yesterday, only more so. This,
however, is the position that existing institutions tend to adopt in
such a period—businesses as well as nonbusinesses. It is, above all, the
policy likely to be adopted by the institutions that were most
successful in the earlier period before the changes. They are most
likely to suffer from the delusion that tomorrow will be like yesterday,
only more so. Thus it can be confidently predicted that a large number
of today’s leaders in all areas, whether business, education or health
care, are unlikely still to be around thirty years hence, and certainly
not in their present form. But to try to anticipate the changes is
equally unlikely to be successful. These changes are not
predictable.</p>
<p>The only policy likely to succeed is to try to make the future.
Changes of course have to fit the Certainties (which this book attempted
to outline in the preceding chapter). Within these restraints, however,
the future is still malleable. It can still be created.</p>
<p>To try to make the future is highly risky. It is less risky, however,
than not to try to make it. A goodly proportion of those attempting to
do what this chapter discusses will surely not succeed. But,
predictably, no one else will.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The New Information Revolution</p>
<p>A new Information Revolution is well under way. It has started in
business enterprise, and with business information. But it will surely
engulf ALL institutions of society. It will radically change the MEANING
of information for both enterprises and individuals. It is not a
revolution in technology, machinery, techniques, software or speed. It
is a revolution in CONCEPTS. It is not happening in Information
Technology (IT), or in Management Information Systems (MIS), and is not
being led by Chief Information Officers (CIOs). It is led by people on
whom the Information Industry tends to look down: accountants. But an
Information Revolution has also been going on in information for the
individual. Again it is not happening in IT or MIS, and is not led by
CIOs. It is a print revolution. And what has triggered these information
revolutions and is driving them is the failure of the “Information
Industry”—the IT people, the MIS people, the CIOs—to provide
INFORMATION.</p>
<p>So far, for fifty years, Information Technology has centered on
DATA—their collection, storage, transmission, presentation. It has
focused on the “T” in “IT.” The new information revolutions focus on the
“I.” They ask, “What is the MEANING of information and its PURPOSE?” And
this is leading rapidly to redefining the tasks to be done with the help
of information and, with it, to redefining the institutions that do
these tasks.</p>
<p>I From the “T” to the “I” in “IT”</p>
<p>A half century ago, around 1950, prevailing opinion over-whelmingly
held that the market for that new “miracle,” the computer, would be in
the military and in scientific calculations, for example, astronomy. A
few of us, however—a very few indeed—argued even then that the computer
would find major applications in business and would have an impact on
it. These few also foresaw—again very much at odds with the prevailing
opinion (even of practically everyone at IBM, just then beginning its
ascent)—that in business the computer would be more than a very fast
adding machine doing clerical chores such as payroll or telephone bills.
On specifics, we dissenters disagreed, of course, as “experts” always
do. But all of us nonconformists agreed on one thing: The computer
would, in short order, revolutionize the work of top management. It
would, we all agreed, have its greatest and earliest impacts on business
policy, business strategy and business decisions.</p>
<p>We could not have been more wrong. The revolutionary impacts so far
have been where none of us then anticipated them: on OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>Not one of us, for instance, could have imagined the truly
revolutionary software now available to architects. At a fraction of
traditional cost and time, it designs the “innards” of large buildings:
their water supply and plumbing; their lighting, heating and
air-conditioning; their elevator specifications and placement—work that
even a few years ago still absorbed some two-thirds of the time and cost
of designing an office building, a large school, a hospital or a
prison.</p>
<p>Not one of us could then have imagined the equally revolutionary
software available to today’s surgical residents. It enables them to do
“virtual operations” whose outcomes include “virtually killing” patients
if the resident makes the wrong surgical move. Until recently, residents
rarely even saw much of an operation before the very end of their
training.</p>
<p>Half a century ago no one could have imagined the software that
enables a major equipment maker such as Caterpillar to organize its
operations, including manufacturing worldwide, around the anticipated
service and replacement needs of its customers. And the computer has had
a similar impact on bank operations, with banking probably the most
computerized industry today.</p>
<p>But the computer and the information technology arising from it have
so far had practically no impact on the decision whether or not to build
a new office building, a school, a hospital or a prison, or on what its
function should or could be. They have had practically no impact on the
decision to perform surgery on a critically sick patient or on what
surgery to perform. They have had no impact on the decision of the
equipment manufacturer concerning which markets to enter and with which
products, or on the decision of a major bank to acquire another major
bank. For top management tasks, information technology so far has been a
producer of data rather than a producer of information—let alone a
producer of new and different questions and new and different
strategies.</p>
<p>The people in Management Information Systems (MIS) and in Information
Technology (IT) tend to blame this failure on what they call the
“reactionary” executives of the “old school.” It is the wrong
explanation. Top executives have not used the new technology because it
has not provided the information they need for their own tasks. The data
available in business enterprise are, for instance, still largely based
on the early-19th-century theorem that lower costs differentiate
businesses and make them compete successfully. MIS has taken the data
based on this theorem and computerized them. They are the data of the
traditional accounting system. Accounting was originally created, at
least five hundred years ago, to provide the data a company needed for
the preservation of its assets and for their distribution if the venture
were liquidated. And the one major addition to accounting since the 15th
century—cost accounting, a child of the 1920s—aimed only at bringing the
accounting system up to 19th-century economics, namely, to provide
information about, and control of, costs. (So does, by the way, the
now-so-popular revision of cost accounting: total quality
management.)</p>
<p>But, as we began to realize around the time of World War II, neither
preservation of assets nor cost control is a top management task. They
are OPERATIONAL TASKS. A serious cost disadvantage may indeed destroy a
business. But business success is based on something totally different,
the creation of value and wealth. This requires risk-taking decisions:
on the theory of the business, on business strategy, on abandoning the
old and innovating the new, on the balance between immediate
profitability and market share. It requires strategic decisions based on
the New Certainties discussed in Chapter Two. These decisions are the
true top management tasks. It was this recognition that underlay, after
World War II, the emergence of management as a discipline, separate and
distinct from what was then called business economics and is now called
microeconomics. But for none of these top management tasks does the
traditional accounting system provide information. Indeed, none of these
tasks is even compatible with the assumptions of the traditional
accounting model. The new information technology, based on the computer,
had no choice but to depend on the accounting system’s data. No others
were available. It collected these data, systematized them, manipulated
them, analyzed them and presented them. On this rested, in large
measure, the tremendous impact the new technology had on what cost
accounting data were designed for: operations. But it also explains
information technology’s near-zero impact on the management of business
itself.</p>
<p>Top management’s frustration with the data that information
technology has so far provided has triggered the new, the next,
Information Revolution. Information technologists, especially chief
information officers in businesses, soon realized that the accounting
data are not what their associates need—which largely explains why MIS
and IT people tend to be contemptuous of accounting and accountants. But
they did not, as a rule, realize that what was needed was not more data,
more technology, more speed. What was needed was to define information;
what was needed was new concepts. And in one enterprise after another,
top management people during the last few years have begun to ask, “What
information concepts do we need for our tasks?” And they have now begun
to demand them of their traditional information providers, the
accounting people.</p>
<p>The new accounting that is evolving as a result of these questions
will be discussed in a later section of this chapter (“The Information
Enterprises Need”). And so is the one new area—and the most important
one—in which we do not as yet have systematic and organized methods for
obtaining information: information on the OUTSIDE of the enterprise.
These new methods are very different in their assumptions and their
origins. Each was developed independently and by different people. But
they all have two things in common. They aim at providing information
rather than data. And they are designed for top management and to
provide information for top management tasks and top management
decisions.</p>
<p>The new Information Revolution began in business and has gone
farthest in it. But it is about to revolutionize education and health
care. Again, the changes in concepts will in the end be at least as
important as the changes in tools and technology. It is generally
accepted now that education technology is due for profound changes and
that with them will come profound changes in structure. Long-distance
learning, for instance, may well make obsolete within twenty-five years
that uniquely American institution, the freestanding undergraduate
college. It is becoming clearer every day that these technical changes
will—indeed must—lead to redefining what is meant by education. One
probable consequence: The center of gravity in higher education (i.e.,
postsecondary teaching and learning) may shift to the continuing
professional education of adults during their entire working lives.
This, in turn, is likely to move learning off campus and into a lot of
new places: the home, the car or the commuter train, the workplace, the
church basement or the school auditorium where small groups can meet
after hours.</p>
<p>In health care a similar conceptual shift is likely to lead from
health care being defined as the fight against disease to being defined
as the maintenance of physical and mental functioning. The fight against
disease remains an important part of medical care, of course, but as
what a logician would call a subset of it. Neither of the traditional
health care providers, the hospital and the general practice physician,
may survive this change, and certainly not in their present form and
function.</p>
<p>In education and health care, the emphasis thus will also shift from
the “T” in IT to the “I,” as it is shifting in business.</p>
<p>The Lessons of History</p>
<p>The current Information Revolution is actually the fourth Information
Revolution in human history. The first one was the invention of writing
five thousand to six thousand years ago in Mesopotamia;
then—independently but several thousand years later—in China; and some
fifteen hundred years later still, by the Maya in Central America. The
second Information Revolution was brought on by the invention of the
written book, first in China, perhaps as early as 1300 B.C., and then,
independently, eight hundred years later, in Greece, when Peisistratos,
the tyrant of Athens, had Homer’s epics—only recited until then—copied
into books. The third Information Revolution was set off by Gutenberg’s
invention of the printing press and of movable type between 1450 and
1455, and by the contemporaneous invention of engraving. We have almost
no documents on the first two of these revolutions, though we know that
the impact of the written book was enormous in Greece and Rome as well
as in China. In fact, China’s entire civilization and system of
government still rest on it. But on the third Information Revolution,
printing and engraving, we have abundant material. Is there anything we
can learn today from what happened five hundred years ago?</p>
<p>The first thing to learn is a little humility.</p>
<p>Everybody today believes that the present Information Revolution is
unprecedented in reducing the cost of, and in the spreading of,
information—whether measured by the cost of a “byte” or by computer
ownership—and in the speed and sweep of its impact. These beliefs are
simply nonsense.</p>
<p>At the time Gutenberg introduced the press, there was a substantial
information industry in Europe. It was probably Europe’s biggest
employer. It consisted of hundreds of monasteries, many of which housed
large numbers of highly skilled monks. Each monk labored from dawn to
dusk, six days a week, copying books by hand. An industrious,
well-trained monk could do four pages a day, or twenty-five pages during
a six-day week, for an annual output of twelve hundred to thirteen
hundred handwritten pages.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, by 1500, the monks had become unemployed. These
monks (some estimates go well above ten thousand for all of Europe) had
been replaced by a very small number of lay craftsmen, the new
“printers,” totaling perhaps one thousand, but spread over all of Europe
(though only beginning to establish themselves in Scandinavia). To
produce a printed book required coordinated teamwork by up to twenty
such craftsmen, beginning with one highly skilled cutter of type, to a
much larger number, maybe ten or more, of much less skilled bookbinders.
Such a team produced each year about twenty-five titles, with an average
of two hundred pages per title, or five thousand pages ready to be
printed. By 1505, print runs of one thousand copies became possible.
This meant that a printing team could produce annually at least 5
million printed pages, bound into 25,000 books ready to be sold—or
250,000 pages per team member as against the twelve hundred or thirteen
hundred the individual monk had produced only fifty years earlier.</p>
<p>Prices fell dramatically. As late as the mid-1400s—just before
Gutenberg’s invention—books were such a luxury that only the wealthy and
educated could afford them. But when Martin Luther’s German Bible came
out in 1522 (a book of well over one thousand pages), its price was so
low that even the poorest peasant family could buy one.</p>
<p>The cost and price reductions of the third Information Revolution
were at least as great as those of the present, the fourth Information
Revolution. And so were the speed and the extent of its spread.</p>
<p>This has been just as true of every other major technological
revolution. Though cotton was by far the most desirable of all textile
fibers—it is easily washable and can be worked up into an infinite
variety of different cloths—it required a time- and labor-expensive
process. It took twelve to fourteen man-days to produce a pound of
cotton yarn by hand, as against one to two man-days for wool, two to
five for linen and six for silk. Between 1764, when machine tools to
work cotton were first introduced—triggering the Industrial
Revolution—and 1784, the time needed to produce a pound of cotton yarn
fell to a few hours. (This interval, incidentally, is exactly the same
as that between the ENIAC and IBM’s 360.) The price dropped by 70
percent and production rose twenty-five-fold. Yet this was still before
Eli Whitney’s cotton gin (1793), which produced a further fall in the
price of cotton yarn of 90 percent-plus and ultimately to about a
thousandth of what it had been before the Industrial Revolution of fifty
or sixty years earlier.</p>
<p>Just as important as the reduction in costs and the speed of the new
printing technology was its impact on what information meant. The first
printed books, beginning with Gutenberg’s Bible, were in Latin and still
had the same topics as the books that the monks had earlier written out
by hand: religious and philosophical treatises and whatever texts had
survived from Latin antiquity. But only twenty years after Gutenberg’s
invention, books by contemporary authors began to emerge, though they
still appeared in Latin. Another ten years and books were printed not
only in Greek and Hebrew but also, increasingly, in the vernacular
(first in English, then in the other European tongues). And in 1476,
only twenty years after Gutenberg, the English printer William Caxton
(1422–1491) published a book on so worldly a subject as chess. By 1500,
popular literature no longer meant verse—epics, especially—that lent
themselves to oral transmission, but prose, that is, the printed
book.</p>
<p>In no time at all, the printing revolution also changed institutions,
including the educational system. In the decades that followed,
university after university was founded throughout Europe, but unlike
the earlier ones, they weren’t designed for the clergy or for the study
of theology. They were built around disciplines for the laity: law,
medicine, mathematics, natural philosophy (science). And
eventually—though it took two hundred years—the printed book created
universal education and the present school.</p>
<p>Printing’s greatest impact, however, was on the core of pre-Gutenberg
Europe: the church. Printing made the Protestant Reformation possible.
Its predecessors, the reformations of John Wycliffe in England
(1330–1384) and of Jan Hus in Bohemia (1372–1415), had met with an
equally enthusiastic popular response. But those revolts could not
travel farther or faster than the spoken word and could thus be
localized and suppressed. This was not the case when Luther, on October
31, 1517, nailed his ninety-five theses on a church door in an obscure
German town. He had intended only to initiate a traditional theological
debate within the church. But without Luther’s consent (and probably
without his knowledge), the theses were immediately printed and
distributed gratis all over Germany, and then all over Europe. These
printed leaflets ignited the religious firestorm that turned into the
Reformation.</p>
<p>Would there have been an age of discovery, beginning in the second
half of the 15th century, without the printing press? Printing
publicized every single advance the Portuguese seafarers made along the
west coast of Africa in their search for a sea route to the Indies.
Printing provided Columbus with the first (though totally wrong) maps of
the fabled lands beyond the western horizon, such as Marco Polo’s China
and the legendary Japan. Printing made it possible to record the results
of every single voyage immediately and to create new, more reliable
maps.</p>
<p>Noneconomic changes cannot be quantified. But the impact on society,
education, culture—let alone on religion—of the printing revolution was
easily as great and surely as fast as the impact of the present
Information Revolution, if not faster.</p>
<p>History’s Lesson for the Technologists</p>
<p>The last Information Revolution, the printed book, may also have a
lesson for today’s information technologists, the IT and MIS people and
the CIOs: They will not disappear. But they may be about to become
“Supporting Cast” rather than the “Superstars” they have been the last
forty years.</p>
<p>The printing revolution immediately created a new class of
information technologists, just as the most recent Information
Revolution has created any number of information businesses, MIS and IT
specialists, software designers and chief information officers. The IT
people of the printing revolution were the early printers.
Nonexistent—and indeed not even imaginable—in 1455, they had become
stars twenty-five years later. These virtuosi of the printing press were
known and revered all over Europe, just as the names of the leading
computer and software firms are recognized and admired worldwide today.
Printers were courted by kings, princes, the Pope and rich merchant
cities and were showered with money and honors.</p>
<p>The first of these tycoons was the famous Venetian printer Aldus
Manutius (1449–1515). He realized that the new printing press could make
a large number of impressions from the same plate—a thousand by the year
1505. He created the low-cost, mass-produced book. Aldus Manutius
created the printing industry: He was the first to extend printing to
languages other than Latin and also the first to do books by
contemporary authors. Altogether his press turned out well over one
thousand titles.</p>
<p>The last of these great printing technologists, and also the last of
the printing princes, was Christophe Plantin (1520–1589) of Antwerp.
Starting as a humble apprentice binder, he built Europe’s biggest and
most famous printing firm. By marrying the two new technologies,
printing and engraving, he created the illustrated book. He became
Antwerp’s leading patrician (Antwerp was then one of the richest cities
in Europe, if not the world), and he became so wealthy that he was able
to build himself a magnificent palace, still preserved today as a
printing museum. But Plantin and his printing house began to decline
well before his death and soon faded into insignificance.</p>
<p>By 1580 or so, the printers, with their focus on technology, had
become ordinary craftsmen, respectable tradesmen to be sure, but
definitely no longer of the upper class. And they had also ceased both
to be more profitable than other trades and to attract investment
capital. Their place was soon taken by what we now call publishers
(though the term wasn’t coined until much later), people and firms whose
focus was no longer on the “T” in IT but on the “I.”</p>
<p>This shift got under way the moment the new technology began to have
an impact on the MEANING of information, and with it, on the meaning and
function of the 15th century’s key institutions such as the church and
the universities. It thus began at the same juncture at which we now
find ourselves in the present Information Revolution. Is this where
Information Technology and Information Technologists are now?</p>
<p>The New Print Revolution</p>
<p>There is actually no reason to believe that the new Information
Revolution has to be “high-tech” at all. For we did have a real
“Information Revolution” these last fifty years, from 1950 on. But it is
not based on computers and electronics. The real boom—and it has been a
veritable boom—has been in that old “no-tech” medium, PRINT.</p>
<p>In 1950 when television first swept the country, it was widely
believed that it would be the end of the printed book. U.S. population
since has grown by two-thirds. The number of college and university
students—the most concentrated group of users and buyers of books—has
increased five-fold. But the number of printed books published and
bought in the U.S. has grown at least fifteen-fold, and probably closer
to twenty-fold.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the leading “high-tech” companies—IBM
in the sixties and seventies, Microsoft since 1980—have been the
fastest-growing businesses in the post-World War II period. But the
world’s two leading print companies have grown at least as fast. One is
the German-based Bertelsmann Group. A small publisher of Protestant
prayer books before Hitler, Bertelsmann was suppressed by the Nazis. It
was revived after World War II by the founder’s grandson, Reinhard Mohn.
Still privately held, Bertelsmann publishes no sales or profit figures.
But it is now the world’s number one publisher and distributor of
printed materials (other than daily papers) in most countries of the
world (except in China and Russia), through its ownership of publishing
firms (e.g., of Random House in the United States), of book clubs and of
magazines (e.g., of France’s leading business magazine Capital). Equally
fast has been the growth of the empire of the Australian-born Rupert
Murdoch. Starting as publisher of two small provincial Australian daily
papers, Murdoch now owns newspapers throughout the English-speaking
world, leading English-language book publishers and magazines—but also a
large company in another precomputer “information medium,” the
movies.</p>
<p>Even faster than the growth of these BOOK publishers has been the
growth of another PRINT medium: the “specialty mass magazine.” A good
many of the huge-circulation “general magazines” that dominated 1920s
and 1930s America, Life, for instance, or The Saturday Evening Post,
have disappeared. They did indeed fall victim to television. But there
are in the United States now several THOUSAND—one estimate is more than
THREE THOUSAND—specialty mass magazines, each with a circulation between
fifty thousand and a million, and most highly profitable.</p>
<p>The most visible examples are magazines that cover business or the
economy. The three leading American magazines of this type, Business
Week (a weekly), Fortune (a biweekly), and Forbes (a monthly), each have
a circulation approaching 1 million. Before World War II the
London-based Economist—the world’s only magazine that systematically
reports every week on economics, politics and business all the world
over—was practically unknown outside the UK, and even there its
circulation was quite small, well below one hundred thousand copies. Now
its U.S. circulation alone exceeds three hundred thousand copies a
week.</p>
<p>But there are similar specialty mass-circulation magazines in every
field and for every interest—in health care and in running symphony
orchestras, in psychology and in foreign affairs, in architecture and
home maintenance and computers and, above all, for every single
profession, every single trade, every single industry. One of the most
successful—and one of the earliest ones—is Scientific American, a U.S.
monthly founded (or rather refounded) in the late 1940s, in which
distinguished scientists explain their own specialized scientific area
to the “scientific laity,” that is, to scientists in other
specialties.</p>
<p>And what explains the success of the PRINT media?</p>
<p>College students probably account for the largest single share of the
growth of printed books in the United States. It is growth in college
texts and in books assigned by college teachers. But the second largest
group are books that did not exist before the 1950s, at least not in any
quantity. There is no English word for them. But the German publisher
who first saw their potential and first founded a publishing house
expressly to publish such books, the late E. B. von Wehrenalp (who
founded Econ Verlag in Dusseldorf—still my German publisher), called it
the Sachbuch—a book written by an expert for nonexperts. And when asked
to explain the Sachbuch Wehrenalp said: “It has to be enjoyable reading.
It has to be educational. But its purpose is neither entertainment nor
education. Its purpose is INFORMATION.”</p>
<p>This is just as true of the specialty mass magazines—whether written
for the layman who wants to know about medicine or for the plumber who
wants to know what goes on in the plumbing business. THEY INFORM. And
above all, they inform about the OUTSIDE. The specialty mass magazine
tells the reader in a profession, a trade, an industry what goes on
outside his or her own business, shop or office—about the competition,
about new products and new technology, about developments in other
countries and above all, about people in the profession, the trade, the
industry (and gossip has always had the highest information—or
misinformation—quotient of all communication).</p>
<p>And now the printed media are taking over the electronic channels.
The fastest-growing book seller since Aldus Manutius five hundred years
ago has been Amazon.com, which sells printed books over the Internet. In
a few very short years it may have become the Internet’s largest retail
merchant. And Bertelsmann, in the fall of 1998, bought a controlling 50
percent in Barnes andandandand Noble, Amazon’s main competitor. More and
more of the specialty mass magazines now publish an “on-line”
edition—delivered over the Internet to be printed out by the subscriber.
Instead of IT replacing print, print is taking over the electronic
technology as a distribution channel for PRINTED INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The new distribution channel will surely change the printed book. New
distribution channels always do change what they distribute. But however
delivered or stored, it will remain a printed product. And it will still
provide information.</p>
<p>The market for information exists, in other words. And, though still
disorganized, so does the supply. In the next few years—surely not much
more than a decade or two—the two will converge. And that will be the
REAL NEW INFORMA-TION REVOLUTION—led not by IT people, but by
accountants and publishers. And then both enterprises and individuals
will have to learn what information they need and how to get it. THEY
WILL HAVE TO LEARN TO ORGANIZE INFORMATION AS THEIR KEY RESOURCE.</p>
<p>II The Information Enterprises Need</p>
<p>We are just beginning to understand how to use information as a tool.
But we already can outline the major parts of the information system
enterprises need. In turn, we can begin to understand the concepts
likely to underlie the enterprise that executives will have to manage
tomorrow.</p>
<p>From Cost Accounting to Result Control</p>
<p>We may have gone furthest in redesigning both enterprise and
information in the most traditional of our information systems:
accounting. In fact, many businesses have already shifted from
traditional cost accounting to activity-based costing. It was first
developed for manufacturing where it is now in wide use. But it is
rapidly spreading to service businesses and even to nonbusinesses, for
example, universities. Activity-based costing represents both a
different concept of the business process and different ways of
measuring.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting, first developed by General Motors
seventy years ago, postulates that total manufacturing cost is the sum
of the costs of individual operations. Yet the cost that matters for
competitiveness and profitability is the cost of the total process, and
that is what the new activity-based costing records and makes
manageable. Its basic premise is that business is an integrated process
that starts when supplies, materials and parts arrive at the plant’s
loading dock and continues even after the finished product reaches the
end-user. Service is still a cost of the product, and so is
installation, even if the customer pays.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting measures what it costs to do something,
for example, to cut a screw thread. Activity-based costing also records
the cost of not doing, such as the cost of machine downtime, the cost of
waiting for a needed part or tool, the cost of inventory waiting to be
shipped and the cost of reworking or scrapping a defective part. The
costs of not doing, which traditional cost accounting cannot and does
not record, often equal and sometimes even exceed the cost of doing.
Activity-based costing therefore gives not only much better cost
control; increasingly, it gives result control.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting assumes that a certain operation—for
example, heat treating—has to be done and that it has to be done where
it is being done now. Activity-based costing asks, “Does it have to be
done? If so, where is it best done?” Activity-based costing integrates
what were once several procedures—value analysis, process analysis,
quality management and costing—into one analysis.</p>
<p>Using that approach, activity-based costing can substantially lower
manufacturing costs—in some instances by a full third. Its greatest
impact, however, is likely to be in services. In most manufacturing
companies, cost accounting is inadequate. But service industries—banks,
retail stores, hospitals, schools, news-papers and radio and television
stations—have practically no cost information at all. Activity-based
costing shows why traditional cost accounting has not worked for service
companies. It is not because the techniques are wrong. It is because
traditional cost accounting makes the wrong assumptions. Service
companies cannot start with the cost of individual operations, as
manufacturing companies have done with traditional cost accounting. They
must start with the assumption that there is only one cost: that of the
total system. And it is a fixed cost over any given time period. The
famous distinction between fixed and variable costs, on which
traditional cost accounting is based, does not make sense in services.
Neither does another basic assumption of traditional cost accounting:
that capital can be substituted for labor. In fact, in knowledge-based
work especially, additional capital investment is likely to require more
rather than less labor. A hospital that buys a new diagnostic tool will
not lay off anybody as a result. But it will have to add four or five
people to run the new equipment. Other knowledge-based organizations
have had to learn the same lesson. But that all costs are fixed over a
given time period and that resources cannot be substituted for each
other are precisely the assumptions with which activity-based costing
starts. By applying them to services, we are beginning for the first
time to get cost information and control.</p>
<p>Banks, for instance, have been trying for several decades to apply
conventional cost-accounting techniques to their business—that is, to
figure the costs of individual operations and services—with almost
negligible results. Now they are beginning to ask, “Which one activity
is at the center of costs and of results?” One answer: the customer. The
cost per customer in any major area of banking is a fixed cost. Thus it
is the yield per customer—both the volume of services a customer uses
and the mix of those services—that determines costs and profitability.
Retail discounters, especially those in Western Europe, have known that
for some time. They assume that once shelf space is installed, its cost
is fixed, and management consists of maximizing the yield on the space
over a given time span. This focus on result control has enabled these
discounters to increase profitability despite their low prices and low
margins.</p>
<p>In some areas, such as research labs, where productivity is difficult
to measure, we may always have to rely on assessment and judgment rather
than on costing. But for most knowledge-based and service work, we
should, within ten years, have developed reliable tools to measure and
manage costs and to relate those costs to results.</p>
<p>Thinking more clearly about costing in services should yield new
insights into the costs of getting and keeping customers in businesses
of all kinds.</p>
<p>If GM, Ford and Chrysler in the United States had used activity-based
costing, for example, they would have realized early on the utter
futility of their competitive “blitzes” of the past twenty years, which
offered new-car buyers spectacular discounts and hefty cash rewards.
Those promotions actually cost the Big Three automakers enormous amounts
of money and, worse, enormous numbers of customers. In fact, every one
resulted in a nasty drop in market standing. But neither the costs of
the special deals nor their negative yields appeared in the companies’
conventional cost-accounting figures, so management never saw the
damage.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese used a form of activity-based costing—though a
fairly primitive one—Toyota, Nissan and Honda knew better than to
compete with the U.S. automakers through discount blitzes, and thus
maintained both their market share and their profits.</p>
<p>From Legal Fiction to Economic Reality</p>
<p>Knowing the cost of operations, however, is not enough. To compete
successfully in an increasingly competitive global market, a company has
to know the costs of its entire economic chain and has to work with
other members of the chain to manage costs and maximize yield. Companies
are therefore beginning to shift from costing only what goes on inside
their own organizations to costing the entire economic process, in which
even the biggest company is just one link.</p>
<p>The legal entity, the company, is a reality for shareholders, for
creditors, for employees, and for tax collectors. But economically, it
is fiction.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago the Coca-Cola Company was a franchiser all over the
world. Independent bottlers manufactured the product. Now the company
owns most of its bottling operations in the United States. But Coke
drinkers—even those few who know that fact—could not care less.</p>
<p>What matters in the marketplace is the economic reality, the costs of
the entire process, regardless of who owns what.</p>
<p>Again and again in business history, an unknown company has come from
nowhere and in a few short years has overtaken the established leaders
without apparently even breathing hard. The explanation always given is
superior strategy, superior technology, superior marketing, or lean
manufacturing. But in every single case, the newcomer also enjoys a
tremendous cost advantage, usually about 30 percent. The reason is
always the same: the new company knows and manages the costs of the
entire economic chain rather than its costs alone.</p>
<p>Toyota is perhaps the best-publicized example of a company that knows
and manages the costs of its suppliers and distributors; they are all,
of course, members of its Keiretsu. Through that network, Toyota manages
the total cost of making, distributing and servicing its cars as one
cost stream, putting work where it costs the least and yields the most.
(On the history of the Keiretsu see Chapter One.)</p>
<p>Economists have known the importance of costing the entire economic
chain since Alfred Marshall wrote about it in the late 1890s. But most
business people still consider it theoretical abstraction. Increasingly,
however, managing the economic cost chain will become a necessity.
Indeed, executives need to organize and manage not only the cost chain
but also everything else—especially corporate strategy and product
planning—as one economic whole, regardless of the legal boundaries of
individual companies.</p>
<p>A powerful force driving companies toward economic chain costing will
be the shift from cost-led pricing to price-led costing. Traditionally,
Western companies have started with costs, put a desired profit margin
on top, and arrived at a price. They practiced cost-led pricing. Sears
and Marks andandandand Spencer long ago switched to price-led costing,
in which the price the customer is willing to pay determines allowable
costs, beginning with the design stage. Until recently, those companies
were the exceptions. Now price-led costing is becoming the rule.</p>
<p>The same ideas apply to outsourcing, alliances and joint
ventures—indeed, to any structure that is built on partnership rather
than control. And such entities, rather than the traditional model of a
parent company with wholly owned subsidiaries, are increasingly becoming
the models for growth, especially in the global economy. (On this see
Chapter One.)</p>
<p>For many businesses it will be painful to switch to economic-chain
costing. Doing so requires uniform or at least compatible accounting
systems of all companies along the entire chain. Yet each one does its
accounting in its own way, and each is convinced that its system is the
only possible one. Moreover, economic-chain costing requires information
sharing across companies; yet even within the same company, people tend
to resist information sharing.</p>
<p>Whatever the obstacles, economic-chain costing is going to be done.
Otherwise, even the most efficient company will suffer from an
increasing cost disadvantage.</p>
<p>Information for Wealth Creation</p>
<p>Enterprises are paid to create wealth, not to control costs. But that
obvious fact is not reflected in traditional measurements. First-year
accounting students are taught that the balance sheet portrays the
liquidation value of the enterprise and provides creditors with
worst-case information. But enterprises are not normally run to be
liquidated. They have to be managed as going concerns, that is, for
wealth creation.</p>
<p>To do that requires four sets of diagnostic tools: foundation
information, productivity information, competence information, and
resource allocation information. Together they constitute the
executive’s tool kit for managing the current business.</p>
<p>Foundation Information</p>
<p>The oldest and most widely used set of diagnostic management tools
are cash-flow and liquidity projections and such standard measurements
as the ratio between dealers’ inventories and sales of new cars, the
earnings coverage for interest payments on a bond issue, and the ratios
between receivables outstanding more than six months, total receivables,
and sales. Those may be likened to the measurements a doctor takes at a
routine physical: weight, pulse, temperature, blood pressure and
urinalysis. If those readings are normal, they do not tell us much. If
they are abnormal, they indicate a problem that needs to be identified
and treated. Those measurements might be called foundation
information.</p>
<p>Productivity Information</p>
<p>The second set of tools for business diagnosis deals with the
productivity of key resources. The oldest of them—of World War II
vintage—measures the productivity of manual labor. Now we are slowly
developing measurements though still quite primitive ones, for the
productivity of knowledge-based and service work (see Chapter Five).
However, measuring only the productivity of workers, whether blue- or
white-collar, no longer gives us adequate information about
productivity. We need data on total-factor productivity.</p>
<p>That explains the growing popularity of Economic Value-Added Analysis
(EVA). It is based on something we have known for a long time: What we
generally call profits, the money left to service equity, is not profit
at all and may be mostly a genuine cost. Until a business returns a
profit that is greater than its cost of capital, it operates at a loss.
Never mind that it pays taxes as if it had a genuine profit. The
enterprise still returns less to the economy than it uses up in
resources. It does not cover its full costs unless the reported profit
exceeds the cost of capital. Until then, it does not create wealth; it
destroys it. By that measurement, incidentally, few U.S. businesses have
been profitable since World War II.</p>
<p>By measuring the value added over all costs, including the cost of
capital, EVA measures, in effect, the productivity of all factors of
production. It does not, by itself, tell us why a certain product or a
certain service does not add value or what to do about it. But it shows
us what we need to find out and that we need to take action. EVA should
also be used to find out what works. It does show which products,
services, operations or activities have unusually high productivity and
add unusually high value. Then we should ask ourselves, “What can we
learn from these successes?”</p>
<p>The most recent of the tools used to obtain productivity information
is benchmarking—comparing one’s performance with the best performance in
the industry or, better yet, with the best anywhere in the world.
Benchmarking assumes correctly that what one organization does, any
other organization can do as well. It assumes correctly that any
business has to be globally competitive (see Chapter Two). It assumes,
also correctly, that being at least as good as the leader is a
prerequisite to being competitive. Together, EVA and benchmarking
provide the diagnostic tools to measure total-factor productivity and to
manage it.</p>
<p>Competence Information</p>
<p>A third set of tools deals with competences. Leadership rests on
being able to do something others cannot do at all or find difficult to
do even poorly. It rests on core competencies that meld market or
customer value with a special ability of the producer or supplier.</p>
<p>Some examples: the ability of the Japanese to miniaturize electronic
components, which is based on their three-hundred-year-old artistic
tradition of putting landscape paintings on a tiny lacquered box, called
an inro, and of carving a whole zoo of animals on the even tinier
button, called a netsuke, that holds the box on the wearer’s belt; or
the almost unique ability GM has had for eighty years to make successful
acquisitions; or Marks andandandand Spencer’s also unique ability to
design packaged and ready-to-eat gourmet meals for middle-class purses.
But how does one identify both the core competencies one has already and
those the business needs to take and maintain a leadership position? How
does one find out whether one’s core competence is improving or
weakening? Or whether it is still the right core competence and what
changes it might need?</p>
<p>So far the discussion of core competencies has been largely
anecdotal. But a number of highly specialized, midsized companies—a
Swedish pharmaceutical producer and a U.S. producer of specialty tools,
to name two—are developing the methodology to measure and manage core
competencies.</p>
<p>The first step is to keep careful track of one’s own and one’s
competitors’ performance, looking especially for unexpected successes
and for unexpected poor performance in areas where one should have done
well. The successes demonstrate what the market values and will pay for.
They indicate where the business enjoys a leadership advantage. The
nonsuccesses should be viewed as the first indication either that the
market is changing or that the company’s competencies are weakening.</p>
<p>This analysis allows for the early recognition of opportunities.</p>
<p>By carefully tracking unexpected successes, a U.S. tool-maker found,
for example, that small Japanese machine shops were buying its
high-tech, high-priced tools, even though it had not designed the tools
with them in mind or ever offered these tools to them. That allowed the
company to recognize a new core competence: its products were easy to
maintain and to repair despite their technical complexity. When that
insight was applied to designing products, the company gained leadership
in the small-plant and machine-shop markets in the United States and
Western Europe, huge markets where it had done practically no business
before.</p>
<p>Core competencies are different for every organization; they are, so
to speak, part of an organization’s personality. But every
organization—not just businesses—needs one core competence: innovation.
And every organization needs a way to record and appraise its innovative
performance. In organizations already doing that—among them several
topflight pharmaceutical manufacturers—the starting point is not the
company’s own performance. It is a careful record of the innovations in
the entire field during a given period. Which of them were truly
successful? How many of them were ours? Is our performance commensurate
with our objectives? With the direction of the market? With our market
standing? With our research spending? Are our successful innovations in
the areas of greatest growth and opportunity? How many of the truly
important innovation opportunities did we miss? Why? Because we did not
see them? Or because we saw them but dismissed them? Or because we
botched them? And how well do we do in converting an innovation into a
commercial product? A good deal of that, admittedly, is assessment
rather than measurement. It raises rather than answers questions, but it
raises the right questions.</p>
<p>Resource Allocation Information</p>
<p>The last area in which diagnostic information is needed to manage the
current business for wealth creation is the allocation of scarce
resources: capital and performing people. Those two convert into action
all the information that a management has about its business. They
determine whether the enterprise will do well or poorly.</p>
<p>GM developed the first systematic capital-appropriations process
about seventy years ago. Today practically every business has a
capital-appropriations process, but few use it correctly. Companies
typically measure their proposed capital appropriations by only one or
two of the following yard-sticks: return on investment, payback period,
cash flow, or discounted present value. But we have known for a long
time—since the early 1930s—that none of those is the right method. To
understand a proposed investment, a company needs to look to all four.
Sixty years ago that would have required endless number-crunching. Now a
laptop computer can provide the data within a few minutes. We also have
known for sixty years that managers should never look at just one
proposed capital appropriation in isolation but should instead choose
the projects that show the best ratio between opportunity and risks.
That requires a capital-appropriations budget to display the
choices—again, something far too many businesses do not do.</p>
<p>Most serious, however, is that most capital-appropriations processes
do not even ask for two vital pieces of information:</p>
<p>• What will happen if the proposed investment fails to produce the
promised results, as do three out of every five? Would it seriously hurt
the company, or would it be just a fleabite?</p>
<p>• If the investment is successful—and especially if it is more
successful than we expect—what will it commit us to?</p>
<p>In addition, a capital-appropriations request requires specific
deadlines: When should we expect what results? Then the
results—successes, near successes, near failures, and failures—need to
be reported and analyzed. There is no better way to improve an
organization’s performance than to measure the results of capital
spending against the promises and expectations that led to its
authorization. How much better off would the United States be today had
such feedback on government programs been standard practice for the past
fifty years?</p>
<p>Capital, however, is only one key resource of the organization, and
it is by no means the scarcest one. The scarcest resources in any
organization are performing people.</p>
<p>Since World War II, the U.S. military—and so far no one else—has
learned to test its placement decisions. It now thinks through what it
expects of senior officers before it puts them into key commands. It
then appraises their performance against those expectations. And it
constantly appraises its own process for selecting senior commanders
against the successes and failures of its appointments.</p>
<p>In business—but in universities, hospitals and government agencies as
well—placement with specific expectations as to what the appointee
should achieve and systematic appraisal of the outcome are virtually
unknown. In the effort to create wealth, managers need to allocate human
resources as purposefully and as thoughtfully as they do capital. And
the outcomes of those decisions ought to be recorded and studied as
carefully.</p>
<p>Where the Results Are</p>
<p>Those four kinds of information tell us only about the current
business. They inform and direct tactics. For strategy, we need
organized information about the environment. Strategy has to be based on
information about markets, customers and noncustomers; about technology
in one’s own industry and others; about worldwide finance, and about the
changing world economy. For that is where the results are. Inside an
organization there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a
customer whose check has not bounced.</p>
<p>Major changes always start outside an organization. A retailer may
know a great deal about the people who shop at its stores. But no matter
how successful, no retailer ever has more than a small fraction of the
market as its customers; the great majority are noncustomers. It is
always with noncustomers that basic changes begin and become
significant. At least half the important new technologies that have
transformed an industry in the past fifty years came from outside the
industry itself. Commercial paper, which has revolutionized finance in
the United States, did not originate with the banks. Molecular biology
and genetic engineering were not developed by the pharmaceutical
industry. Though the great majority of businesses will continue to
operate only locally or regionally, they all face, at least potentially,
global competition from places they have never even heard of before.</p>
<p>Not all of the needed information about the outside is available, to
be sure, despite the specialty mass magazines. There is no
information—not even unreliable information—on economic conditions in
most of China, for instance, or on legal conditions in the successor
states to the Soviet empire. But even where information is readily
available, many businesses are oblivious to it. Many U.S. companies went
into Europe in the 1960s without even asking about labor legislation.
European companies have been just as blind and ill-informed in their
ventures into the United States. A major cause of the Japanese real
estate investment debacle in California during the 1990s was the failure
to find out elementary facts about zoning and taxes.</p>
<p>A serious cause of business failure is the common assumption that
conditions—taxes, social legislation, market preferences, distribution
channels, intellectual property rights and many others—must be what we
think they are or at least what we think they should be.</p>
<p>An adequate information system has to include information that makes
executives question that assumption. It must lead them to ask the right
questions, not just feed them the information they expect. That
presupposes first that executives know what information they need. It
demands further that they obtain that information on a regular basis. It
finally requires that they systematically integrate the information into
their decision making.</p>
<p>These are beginnings. These are first attempts to organize “Business
Intelligence,” that is, information about actual and potential
competitors worldwide. A few multinationals—Unilever, Coca-Cola, Nestlé,
some Japanese trading companies, and a few big construction
companies—have been working hard on building systems to gather and
organize outside information. But in general, the majority of
enterprises have yet to start the job. It is fast becoming the major
information challenge for all enterprises.</p>
<p>III The Information Executives Need for Their Work</p>
<p>A great deal of the new technology has been data processing equipment
for the individual. But as far as information goes, the attention has
been mainly on information for the enterprise—as it has been so far in
this chapter. But information for executives—and indeed, for all
knowledge workers—for their own work may be a great deal more important.
For the knowledge worker in general, and especially for executives,
information is their key resource. Information increasingly creates the
link to their fellow workers and to the organization, and their
“network.” It is information, in other words, that enables knowledge
workers to do their job.</p>
<p>By now it is clear that no one can provide the information that
knowledge workers and especially executives need, except knowledge
workers and executives themselves. But few executives so far have made
much of an effort to decide what they need, and even less, how to
organize it. They have tended to rely on the producers of data—IT people
and accountants—to make these decisions for them. But the producers of
data cannot possibly know what data the users need so that they become
information. Only individual knowledge workers, and especially
individual executives, can convert data into information. And only
individual knowledge workers, and especially individual executives, can
decide how to organize their information so that it becomes their key to
effective action.</p>
<p>To produce the information executives need for their work, they have
to begin with two questions:</p>
<p>“What information do I owe to the people with whom I work and on whom
I depend? In what form? And in what time frame?”</p>
<p>“What information do I need myself? From whom? In what form? And in
what time frame?”</p>
<p>These two questions are closely connected. But they are different.
What I owe comes first because it establishes communications. And unless
that has been established, there will be no information flow back to the
executive.</p>
<p>We have known this since Chester I. Barnard (1886–1961) published his
pioneering book The Functions of the Executive, in 1938, over sixty
years ago. Yet, while Barnard’s book is universally praised, it has had
little practical impact. Communication for Barnard was vague and
general. It was human relationships, and personal. However, what makes
communications effective at the workplace is that they are focused on
something outside the person. They have to be focused on a common task
and on a common challenge. They have to be focused on the work.</p>
<p>And by asking: “To whom do I owe information, so that they can do
their work?” communications are being focused on the common task and the
common work. They become effective. The first question therefore (as in
any effective relationship), is not: “What do I want and need?” It is:
“What do other people need from me?” and “Who are these other people?”
Only then can the question be asked: “What information do I need? From
whom? In what form? In what time frame?”</p>
<p>Executives who ask these questions will soon find that little of the
information they need comes out of their own company’s information
system. Some comes out of accounting—though in many cases the accounting
data has to be rethought, reformulated, rearranged to apply to the
executive’s own work. But a good deal of the information executives need
for their own work will come, as said already, from the outside and will
have to be organized quite separately and distinctly from the inside
information system.</p>
<p>The only one who can answer the question: “What do I owe by way of
information? To whom? In what form?” is the other person. The first step
in obtaining the information that executives need for their own work is,
therefore, to go to everyone with whom they work, everyone on whom they
depend, everyone who needs to know what they themselves are doing, and
ask them. But before one asks, one has to be prepared to answer. For the
other person will—and should—come back and ask: “And what information do
you need from me?” Hence, executives need first to think through both
questions—but then they start out by going to the other people and ask
them first to tell them: “What do I owe you?”</p>
<p>Both questions, “What do I owe?” and “What do I need?” sound
deceptively simple. But everyone who has asked them has soon found out
that it takes a lot of thought, a lot of experimentation, a lot of hard
work, to answer them. And the answers are not forever. In fact, these
questions have to be asked again, every eighteen months or so. They also
have to be asked every time there is a real change, for example, a
change in the enterprise’s theory of the business, in the individual’s
own job and assignment, or in the jobs and assignments of the other
people.</p>
<p>But if individuals ask these questions seriously, they will soon come
to understand both what they need and what they owe. And then they can
set about organizing both.</p>
<p>Organizing Information</p>
<p>Unless organized, information is still data. To be meaningful it has
to be organized. It is, however, not clear at all in what form certain
kinds of information are meaningful, and especially in what form of
organization they are meaningful for one’s own job. And the same
information may have to be organized in different ways for different
purposes.</p>
<p>Here is one example. Since Jack Welch took over as CEO in 1981, the
General Electric Company (GE) has created more wealth than any other
company in the world. One of the main factors in this success was that
GE organized the same information about the performance of every one of
its business units differently for different purposes. It kept
traditional financial and marketing reporting, the way most companies
appraise their businesses every year or so. But the same data were also
organized for long-range strategy, that is, to show unexpected successes
and unexpected failures, but also to show where actual events differed
substantially from what was expected. A third way to organize the same
data was to focus on the innovative performance of the business—which
became a major factor in determining compensation and bonuses of the
general manager and of the senior management people of a business unit.
Finally, the same data were organized to show how the business unit and
its management treated and developed people—which then became a key
factor in deciding on the promotion of an executive, and especially of
the general manager of a business unit.</p>
<p>No two executives, in my experience, organize the same information
the same way. And information has to be organized the way individual
executives work. But there are some basic methodologies to organize
information.</p>
<p>One is the Key Event. Which events—for it is usually more than
one—are the “hinges” on which the rest of my performance primarily
depends? The key event may be technological—the success of a research
project. It may have to do with people and their development. It may
have to do with establishing a new product or a new service with certain
key customers. It may be to obtain new customers. What is a key event is
very much the executive’s individual decision. It is, however, a
decision that needs to be discussed with the people on whom the
executive depends. It is perhaps the most important thing anybody in an
organization has to get across to the people with whom one works, and
especially to one’s own superior.</p>
<p>Another key methodological concept comes out of modern Probability
Theory—it is the concept on which, for instance, Total Quality
Management is based. It is the difference between normal fluctuations
within the range of normal probability distribution and the exceptional
event. As long as fluctuations stay within the normal distribution of
probability for a given type of event (e.g., for quality in a
manufacturing process), no action is taken. Such fluctuations are data
and not information. But the exception, which falls outside the accepted
probability distribution, is information. It calls for action.</p>
<p>Another basic methodology for organizing information comes out of the
theory of the Threshold Phenomenon—the theory that underlies Perception
Psychology. It was a German physicist, Gustav Fechner (1801–1887), who
first realized that we do not feel a sensation—for example, a
pinprick—until it reaches a certain intensity, that is, until it passes
a perception threshold. A great many phenomena follow the same law. They
are not actually “phenomena.” They are data until they reach a certain
intensity, and pass the perception threshold.</p>
<p>For many events, both in one’s work and in one’s personal life, this
theory applies and enables one to organize data into information. When
we speak of a “recession” in the economy, we speak of a threshold
phenomenon—a down-turn in sales and profits is a recession when it
passes a certain threshold, for example, when it continues beyond a
certain length of time. Similarly, a disease becomes an “epidemic” when,
in a certain population, it passes and exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
<p>This concept is particularly useful to organize information about
personnel events. Such events as accidents, turnover, grievances, and so
on become significant when they pass a certain threshold. But the same
is true of innovative performance in a company—except that there the
perception threshold is the point below which a drop in innovative
performance becomes relevant and calls for action. The threshold concept
is altogether one of the most useful concepts to determine when a
sequence of events becomes a “trend,” and requires attention and
probably action, and when events, even though they may look spectacular,
are by themselves not particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>Finally, a good many executives have found that the one way of
organizing information effectively is simply to organize one’s being
informed about the unusual.</p>
<p>One example is the “manager’s letter.” The people who work with a
manager write a monthly letter to him or her, reporting on anything
unusual and unexpected within their own sphere of work and action. Most
of these “unusual” things can safely be disregarded. But again, and
again, there is an “exceptional” event, one that is outside the normal
range of probability distribution. Again and again, there is a
concatenation of events—insignificant in each reporter’s area, but
significant if added together. Again and again, the management letters
bring out a pattern to which to pay attention. Again and again, they
convey information.</p>
<p>No Surprises</p>
<p>No system designed by knowledge workers, and especially by
executives, to give them the information they need for their work will
ever be perfect. But, over the years, they steadily improve. And the
ultimate test of an information system is that there are no surprises.
Before events become significant, executives have already adjusted to
them, analyzed them, understood them and taken appropriate action.</p>
<p>One example are the three or four—very few indeed—American financial
institutions that, in the late 1990s, were not surprised by the collapse
of mainland Asia. They had thought through what “information” means in
respect to Asian economies and Asian currencies. They had gradually
eliminated all the information they got from within their own
subsidiaries and affiliates in these countries—these, they had begun to
realize, were just “data.” Instead, they had begun to organize their
information about such things as the ratio between fixed investment and
portfolio investment in these countries, and the ratio between portfolio
investment (i.e., short-term borrowing) and the country’s balance of
payments and with it the amount available to service foreign short-term
debt. Long before these ratios turned so unfavorable as to make a panic
in mainland Asia inevitable, these executives had realized that it was
coming. They realized that they had to decide whether to pull out of
these countries for short-term growth, or to stay for very long-term—and
very risky—strategies. They had, in other words, realized what economic
data are meaningful in respect to emerging countries, had organized
them, had analyzed them and had interpreted them. They had turned the
data into information—and had decided what action to take long before
that action became necessary.</p>
<p>By contrast, the overwhelming majority of American, European and
Asian companies doing business on mainland Asia and/or investing in it
relied on what their own people in these countries reported to them.
This turned out not to be information at all—in fact it turned out to be
misinformation. But only those executives who had spent several years
asking the question “What information is meaningful in respect to our
doing business in Thailand or Indonesia?” were prepared.</p>
<p>And far too often the mere quantity of data is taken to mean
information—as if the heft of a big-city telephone book were to make it
unnecessary to know whom one wants to reach, what his or her name or
business is, and why one wants to talk to the person. Executives have to
learn two things: to ELIMINATE data that do not pertain to the
information they need; and to organize the data, to analyze, to
interpret—and then to focus the resulting information on ACTION. For the
purpose of information is not knowledge. It is being able to take the
right action.</p>
<p>Going Outside</p>
<p>The example of the companies from the developed countries being
surprised by the collapse of the emerging economies of mainland Asia
underline the importance of obtaining meaningful outside
information.</p>
<p>For the executive there is, in the end, only one way to get it: that
is to go, personally, on the outside. No matter how good the reports, no
matter how good the economic or financial theory underlying them,
nothing beats personal, direct observation, and in a form in which it is
truly outside observation.</p>
<p>English supermarket chains have again and again tried to establish
themselves in neighboring Ireland—with very little success. The leading
supermarket chain in Ireland is Super-Quinn, started and run by Fergal
Quinn. His secret is not better merchandise or lower prices. His secret
is that he and all of his company’s executives have to spend two days a
week outside their offices. One day is spent actually doing a job in a
supermarket, for example, by serving at a checkout counter or as manager
for perishable foods. And one day is spent in competitors’ stores
watching, listening, talking to the competitors’ employees and the
competitors’ customers.</p>
<p>The largest hospital supply company in the United States was built by
a chief executive officer who himself spent four weeks a year—two weeks
twice a year—taking the place of a salesman on vacation. He demanded
that all the company’s senior executives do the same. When the regular
salesman came back, the customer—for example, the nun who purchases
supplies for the Catholic hospital—always said, “What dumb cluck took
your place? He always asked why I buy things from other suppliers rather
than from you. He never was particularly interested in getting an order
for what you sell.” But this was precisely the point of the
exercise.</p>
<p>And it is a very old observation that few things improve the
performance of a physician as much as being a hospital patient for two
weeks.</p>
<p>Market research, focus groups and the like are highly valued, and
rightfully so. But still, they always focus on the company’s products.
They never focus on what the customer buys and is interested in. Only by
being a customer oneself, a salesman oneself, a patient oneself, can one
get true information about the outside. And even that information is of
course still limited to one’s customers and one’s noncustomers. What
other information about the outside do executives need, however, to do
their work? And how can they get it?</p>
<p>This is one reason, by the way, why being a volunteer in a nonprofit
agency—as discussed in Chapter Six—is important not only for preparing
oneself for the second half of one’s life. It is equally important as a
way to get outside information—which is information on how other people,
with other jobs, other backgrounds, other knowledges, other values and
other points of view see the world, act and react, and make their
decisions. For this reason also, the continuing education of already
successful adults will be increasingly important. For in that university
course, the forty-five-year-old, successful knowledge worker—business
executive, lawyer, university president, minister of a church and so
on—is forced to work with people of different backgrounds, and different
values. It is one way not only to update one’s knowledge but to obtain
what executives need: information about the outside.</p>
<p>In the long run, information about the outside may be the most
important information executives need to do their work. At the same
time, it is the one that still has to be organized. This information is
not only the foundation for right action. It is equally the foundation
for the challenges discussed in the next two chapters: the challenge of
Knowledge-Worker Productivity and the challenge of Managing Oneself.
Both rely heavily on the executives knowing what information they need
for their work and what information they owe to others, and on
systematically developing the methods that turn the chaos of data in the
universe into organized and focused information for the executive’s own
work and job.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The most important, and indeed the truly unique, contribution of
management in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the
productivity of the MANUAL WORKER in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st
century is similarly to increase the productivity of KNOWLEDGE WORK and
the KNOWLEDGE WORKER.</p>
<p>The most valuable assets of a 20th-century company were its
production equipment. The most valuable asset of a 21st-century
institution, whether business or nonbusiness, will be its knowledge
workers and their productivity.</p>
<p>I The Productivity of the Manual Worker</p>
<p>FIRST: a look where we are.</p>
<p>It was only a little over a hundred years ago that for the first time
an educated person actually looked at manual work and manual worker, and
then began to study both. Great poets, the Greek Hesiod (6th century
B.C.) and, five hundred years later, the Roman Virgil (at the end of the
first century B.C.), sang about the work of the farmer. Theirs are still
among the finest poems in any language. But neither the work they sang
about nor their farmers bear even the most remote resemblance to reality
or were meant to have any. Neither Hesiod nor Virgil ever held a sickle
in his hands, ever herded sheep or even looked at the people who did,
either. And when, nineteen hundred years after Virgil, Karl Marx
(1818–1883) came to write about manual work and manual workers, he too
never looked at either, nor had he ever as much as touched a machine.
The first man to do both, that is, to work as a manual worker and then
to study manual work, was Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915).</p>
<p>Throughout recorded history—and actually well before any history was
recorded—there have been, of course, steady advances in what we today
call “productivity” (the term itself is barely fifty years old). But
they were the result of new tools, of new methods, of new technology;
they were advances in what the economist calls “Capital.” There were few
advances throughout the ages in what the economist calls “Labor,” that
is, in the productivity of the worker. It was axiomatic through-out
history that workers could produce more only by working harder or by
working longer hours. The 19th-century economists disagreed as much
about most things as economists do today. But they all agreed—from David
Ricardo (1772–1823) through Karl Marx—that there are enormous
differences in skill between workers, but there are none in respect to
productivity other than between hard workers and lazy ones, or between
physically strong workers and weak ones. Productivity did not exist. It
still is an “extraneous factor” and not part of the equation in most
contemporary economic theory, for example, in Keynes, but also in that
of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>Within a decade after Taylor first looked at work and studied it, the
productivity of the manual worker began its unprecedented rise. Since
then it has been going up steadily at the rate of 3½ percent per annum
compound—which means it has been risen fifty-fold since Taylor. On this
achievement rests all the economic and social gains of the 20th century.
The productivity of the manual worker has created what we now call
“developed” economies. Before Taylor there was no such thing—all
economies were equally “underdeveloped.” An underdeveloped economy
today—or even an “emerging” one—is one that has not—or at least has not
yet—made the manual worker productive.</p>
<p>The Principles of Manual-Work Productivity</p>
<p>Taylor’s principles sound deceptively simple.</p>
<p>The first step in making the manual worker productive is to look at
the task and to analyze its constituent motions. The next step is to
record each motion, the physical effort it takes and the time it takes.
Then motions that are not needed can be eliminated—and whenever we have
looked at manual work we found that a great many of the traditionally
most hallowed procedures turn out to be waste and do not add anything.
Then each of the motions that remain as essential to obtaining the
finished product is set up so as to be done the simplest way, the
easiest way, the way that puts the least physical and mental strain on
the operator, the way it requires the least time. Then these motions are
put together again into a “job” that is in a logical sequence. Finally
the tools needed to do the motions are being redesigned. And whenever we
have looked at any job—no matter for how many thousands of years it has
been performed—we have found that the traditional tools are totally
wrong for the task. This was the case, for instance, with the shovel
used to carry sand in a foundry—the first task Taylor studied. It was
the wrong shape, it was the wrong size and it had the wrong handle. But
we found it to be equally true of the surgeon’s traditional tools.</p>
<p>Taylor’s principles sound obvious—effective methods always do. But it
took Taylor twenty years of experimentation to work them out.</p>
<p>Over these last hundred years there have been countless further
changes, revisions and refinements. The name by which the methodology
goes has changed too over the century. Taylor himself first called his
method “Task Analysis” or “Task Management.” Twenty years later it was
rechristened “Scientific Management.” Another twenty years later, after
the First World War, it came to be knows as “Industrial Engineering” in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and as
“Rationalization” in Germany.</p>
<p>To proclaim that one’s method “rejects” Taylor or “replaces” him is
almost standard “Public Relations.” For what made Taylor and his method
so powerful has also made them unpopular. What Taylor saw when he
actually looked at work violated everything poets and philosophers had
said about work from Hesiod and Virgil to Karl Marx. They all celebrated
“skill.” Taylor showed that in manual work there is no such thing. There
are only simple, repetitive motions. What makes them productive is
knowledge, that is, the way the simple, unskilled motions are put
together, organized and executed. In fact, Taylor was the first person
to apply knowledge to work.*</p>
<p>This also earned Taylor the undying enmity of the labor unions of his
time, all of which were craft unions and based on the mystique of craft
skill and their monopoly on it. Moreover, Taylor advocated—and this is
still anathema to a labor union—that workers be paid according to their
productivity, that is, for their output, rather than for their input,
for example, for hours worked. But Taylor’s definition of work as a
series of operations also largely explains his rejection by the people
who themselves do not do any manual work: the descendants of the poets
and philosophers of old, the Literati and Intellectuals. Taylor
destroyed the romance of work. Instead of a “noble skill” it becomes a
series of simple motions.</p>
<p>And yet every method during these last hundred years that has had the
slightest success in raising the productivity of manual workers—and with
it their real wages—has been based on Taylor’s principles, no matter how
loudly its protagonists proclaimed their differences with Taylor. This
is true of “work enlargement,” “work enrichment” and “job rotation”—all
of which use Taylor’s methods to lessen the worker’s fatigue and thereby
to increase the worker’s productivity. It is true of such extensions of
Taylor’s principles of task analysis and industrial engineering to the
entire manual work process as Henry Ford’s assembly line (developed
after 1914, when Taylor himself was already sick, old and retired). It
is just as true of the Japanese “Quality Circle,” of “Continuous
Improvement” (“Kaizen”), and of “Just-In-Time Delivery.”</p>
<p>The best example, however, is W. Edwards Deming’s (1900–1993) “Total
Quality Management.” What Deming did—and what makes Total Quality
Management effective—is to analyze and organize the job exactly the way
Taylor did. But then he added, around 1940, Quality Control based on a
statistical theory that was only developed ten years after Taylor’s
death. Finally, in the 1970s, Deming substituted closed-circuit
television and computer simulation for Taylor’s stop-watch and motion
photos. But Deming’s Quality Control Analysts are the spit and image of
Taylor’s Efficiency Engineers and function the same way.</p>
<p>Whatever his limitations and shortcomings—and he had many—no other
American, not even Henry Ford (1863–1947), has had anything like
Taylor’s impact. “Scientific Management” (and its successor, “Industrial
Engineering”) is the one American philosophy that has swept the
world—more so even than the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. In
the last century there has been only one worldwide philosophy that could
compete with Taylor’s: Marxism. And in the end, Taylor has triumphed
over Marx.</p>
<p>In the First World War Scientific Management swept through the United
States—together with Ford’s Taylor-based assembly line. In the twenties
Scientific Management swept through Western Europe and began to be
adopted in Japan.</p>
<p>In World War II both the German achievement and the American
achievement were squarely based on applying Taylor’s principles to
Training. The German General Staff, after having lost the First World
War, applied “Rationalization,” that is, Taylor’s Scientific Management,
to the job of the soldier and to military training. This enabled Hitler
to create a superb fighting machine in the six short years between his
coming to power and 1939. In the United States, the same principles were
applied to the training of an industrial workforce, first tentatively in
the First World War, and then, with full power, in WWII. This enabled
the Americans to outproduce the Germans, even though a larger proportion
of the U.S. than of the German male population was in uniform and thus
not in industrial production. And then training-based Scientific
Management gave the U.S. civilian workforce more than twice—if not three
times—the productivity of the workers in Hitler’s Germany and in
Hitler-dominated Europe. Scientific Management thus gave the United
States the capacity to outnumber both Germans and Japanese on the
battle-field and yet to outproduce both by several orders of
magnitude.</p>
<p>Economic development outside the Western world since 1950 has largely
been based on copying what the United States did in World War II, that
is, on applying Scientific Management to making the manual worker
productive. All earlier economic development had been based on
technological innovation—first in France in the 18th century, then in
Great Britain from 1760 until 1850 and finally in the new economic Great
Powers, Germany and the United States, in the second half of the 19th
century. The non-Western countries that developed after the Second World
War, beginning with Japan, eschewed technological innovation. Instead,
they imported the training that the United States had developed during
the Second World War based on Taylor’s principles, and used it to make
highly productive, almost overnight, a still largely unskilled and
preindustrial workforce. (In Japan, for instance, almost two-thirds of
the working population were still, in 1950, living on the land and
unskilled in any work except cultivating rice.) But, while highly
productive, this new workforce was still—for a decade or more—paid
preindustrial wages so that these countries—first Japan, then Korea,
then Taiwan and Singapore—could produce the same manufactured products
as the developed countries, but at a fraction of their labor costs.</p>
<p>The Future of Manual-Worker Productivity</p>
<p>Taylor’s approach was designed for manual work in manufacturing, and
at first applied only to it. But even within these traditional
limitations, it still has enormous scope. It is still going to be the
organizing principle in countries in which manual work, and especially
manual work in manufacturing, is the growth sector of society and
economy, that is, “Third World” countries with very large and still
growing numbers of young people with little education and little
skill.</p>
<p>But, as will be discussed a little later in this chapter, there is a
tremendous amount of knowledge work—including work requiring highly
advanced and thoroughly theoretical knowledge—that includes manual
operations. And the productivity of these operations also requires
Industrial Engineering.</p>
<p>Still, in developed countries, the central challenge is no longer to
make manual work productive—we know, after all, how to do it. The
central challenge will be to make knowledge workers productive.
Knowledge workers are rapidly becoming the largest single group in the
workforce of every developed country. They may already comprise
two-fifths of the U.S. workforce—and a still smaller but rapidly growing
proportion of the workforce of all other developed countries. It is on
their productivity, above all, that the future prosperity and indeed the
future survival of the developed economies will increasingly depend.</p>
<p>II What We Know About Knowledge-Worker Productivity</p>
<p>Work on the productivity of the knowledge worker has barely begun. In
terms of actual work on knowledge-worker productivity we are, in the
year 2000, roughly where we were in the year 1900, a century ago, in
terms of the productivity of the manual worker. But we already know
infinitely more about the productivity of the knowledge worker than we
did then about that of the manual worker. We even know a good many of
the answers. But we also know the challenges to which we do not yet know
the answers, and on which we need to go to work.</p>
<p>SIX major factors determine knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Knowledge-worker productivity demands that we ask the question:
“What is the task?”</p></li>
<li><p>It demands that we impose the responsibility for their
productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge
workers have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and
the responsibility of knowledge workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the
knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the
knowledge worker.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity of the knowledge worker is not—at least not
primarily—a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as
important.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, knowledge-worker productivity requires that the
knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an “asset” rather than a
“cost.” It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the
organization in preference to all other opportunities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these requirements—except perhaps the last one—is almost the
exact opposite of what is needed to increase the productivity of the
manual worker.</p>
<p>In manual work quality also matters. But lack of quality is a
restraint. There has to be a certain minimum quality standard. The
achievement of Total Quality Management, that is, of the application of
20th-century Statistical Theory to manual work, is the ability to cut
(though not entirely to eliminate) production that falls below this
minimum standard.</p>
<p>But in most knowledge work, quality is not a minimum and a restraint.
Quality is the essence of the output. In judging the performance of a
teacher, we do not ask how many students there can be in his or her
class. We ask how many students learn anything—and that’s a quality
question. In appraising the performance of a medical laboratory, the
question of how many tests it can run through its machines is quite
secondary to the question of how many test results are valid and
reliable. And this is true even for the work of the file clerk.</p>
<p>Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at
obtaining quality—and not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum
quality. Only then can one ask: “What is the volume, the quantity of
work?”</p>
<p>This not only means that we approach the task of making productive
the knowledge worker from the quality of the work rather than the
quantity. It also means that we will have to learn to define
quality.</p>
<p>What Is the Task?</p>
<p>But the crucial question in knowledge-worker productivity is the
first one: WHAT IS THE TASK? It is also the one most at odds with
manual-worker productivity. In manual work the Key Question is always:
HOW SHOULD THE WORK BE DONE? In manual work the task is always given.
None of the people who work on manual-worker productivity ever asked:
“What is the manual worker supposed to do?’” Their only question was:
“How does the manual worker best do the job?”</p>
<p>This was just as true of Frederick W. Taylor’s Scientific Management
as it was true of the people at Sears Roebuck or the Ford Motor Company
who first designed the assembly line, and of W. Edwards Deming’s Total
Quality Control.</p>
<p>But in knowledge work the key question is: “What is the task?”</p>
<p>One reason for this is that knowledge work, unlike manual work, does
not program the worker. The worker on the auto-mobile assembly line who
puts on a wheel is programmed by the simultaneous arrival of the car’s
chassis on one line and of the wheel on the other line. The farmer who
plows a field in preparation for planting does not climb out of his
tractor to take a telephone call, to attend a meeting, or to write a
memo. What is to be done is always obvious in manual work.</p>
<p>But in knowledge work the task does not program the worker.</p>
<p>A major crisis in the hospital, for example, when a patient suddenly
goes into coma, does of course control the nurse’s task and programs
her. But otherwise, it is largely the nurse’s decision whether to spend
time at the patient’s bed or whether to spend time filling out papers.
Engineers are constantly being pulled off their task by having to write
a report or rewrite it, by being asked to attend a meeting and so on.
The job of the salesperson in the department store is to serve the
customer and to provide the merchandise the customer is interested in or
should become interested in. Instead the salesperson spends an enormous
amount of time on paperwork, on checking whether merchandise is in
stock, on checking when and how it can be delivered and so on—all things
that take salespeople away from the customer and do not add anything to
their productivity in doing what salespeople are being paid for, which
is to sell and to satisfy the customer.</p>
<p>The first requirement in tackling knowledge work is to find out what
the task is so as to make it possible to concentrate knowledge workers
on the task and to eliminate everything else—at least as far as it can
possibly be eliminated. But this then requires that the knowledge
workers themselves define what the task is or should be. And only the
knowledge workers themselves can do that.</p>
<p>Work on knowledge-worker productivity therefore begins with asking
the knowledge workers themselves:</p>
<p>What is your task? What should it be? What should you be expected to
contribute? and What hampers you in doing your task and should be
eliminated?</p>
<p>Knowledge workers themselves almost always have thought through these
questions and can answer them. Still, it then usually takes time and
hard work to restructure their jobs so that they can actually make the
contribution they are already being paid for. But asking the questions
and taking action on the answers usually doubles or triples
knowledge-worker productivity, and quite fast.</p>
<p>This was the result of questioning the nurses in a major hospital.
They were actually sharply divided as to what their task was, with one
group saying “patient care” and another one saying “satisfying the
physicians.” But they were in complete agreement on the things that made
them unproductive—they called them “chores”: paperwork, arranging
flowers, answering the phone calls of patients’ relatives, answering the
patients’ bells and so on. And all—or nearly all—of these could be
turned over to a nonnurse floor clerk, paid a fraction of a nurse’s pay.
The productivity of the nurses on the floor immediately more than
doubled, as measured by the time nurses spent at the patients’ beds.
Patient satisfaction more than doubled. And turnover of nurses, which
had been catastrophically high, almost disappeared—all within four
months.</p>
<p>And once the task has been defined, the next requirements can be
tackled—and will be tackled by the knowledge workers themselves.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>1 Knowledge workers’ responsibility for their own contribution—the
knowledge worker’s decision what he or she should be held accountable
for in terms of quality and quantity, in respect to time and in respect
to cost. Knowledge workers have to have autonomy, and that entails
responsibility.</p>
<p>2 Continuous innovation has to be built into the knowledge worker’s
job.</p>
<p>3 Continuous learning and continuous teaching have to be built into
the job.</p>
<p>These needs have already been discussed in Chapter Three. But one
central requirement of knowledge-worker productivity is then still left
to be satisfied. We have to answer the question:</p>
<p>What is quality?</p>
<p>In some knowledge work—and especially in some work requiring a high
degree of knowledge—we already measure quality. Surgeons, for instance,
are routinely measured, especially by their colleagues, by their success
rates in difficult and dangerous procedures, for example, by the
survival rates of their open-heart surgical patients or the full
recovery rates of their orthopedic-surgery patients. But by and large we
have, so far, mainly judgments rather than measures regarding the
quality of a great deal of knowledge work. The main trouble is, however,
not the difficulty of measuring quality. It is the difficulty—and more
particularly the sharp disagreements—in defining what the task is and
what it should be.</p>
<p>The best example I know is the American school. As everyone knows,
public schools in the American inner city have become disaster areas.
But next to them—in the same location and serving the same kind of
children—are private (mostly Christian) schools in which the kids behave
well and learn well. There is endless speculation to explain these
enormous quality differences. But a major reason is surely that the two
kinds of schools define their tasks differently. The typical public
school defines its task as “helping the underprivileged”; the typical
Christian school (and especially the parochial schools of the Catholic
church) define their task as “enabling those who want to learn, to
learn.” One therefore is governed by its scholastic failures, the other
one by its scholastic successes.</p>
<p>But similarly: There are two research departments of major
pharmaceutical companies that have totally different results because
they define their tasks differently. One sees its task as not having
failures, that is, in working steadily on fairly minor but predictable
improvements in existing products and for established markets. The other
one defines its task as producing “breakthroughs” and therefore courts
risks. Both are considered fairly successful—by themselves, by their own
top managements and by outside analysts. But each operates quite
differently and quite differently defines its own productivity and that
of its research scientists.</p>
<p>To define quality in knowledge work and to convert the definition
into knowledge-worker productivity is thus to a large extent a matter of
defining the task. It requires the difficult, risk-taking and always
controversial definition as to what “results” are for a given enterprise
and a given activity. We therefore actually know how to do it. Still,
the question is a totally new one for most organizations, and also for
most knowledge workers. And to answer it requires controversy, requires
dissent.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Worker as Capital Asset</p>
<p>In no other area is the difference greater between manual-worker
productivity and knowledge-worker productivity than in their respective
economics. Economic theory and most business practice sees manual
workers as a cost. To be productive, knowledge workers must be
considered a capital asset.</p>
<p>Costs need to be controlled and reduced. Assets need to be made to
grow.</p>
<p>In managing manual workers we learned fairly early that high
turnover, that is, losing workers, is very costly. The Ford Motor
Company, as is well known, increased the pay of skilled workers from 80
cents a day to a day in January, 1914. It did so because its turnover
had been so excessive as to make its labor costs prohibitively high; it
had to hire sixty thousand people a year to keep ten thousand. Even so,
everybody, including Henry Ford himself (who had at first been bitterly
opposed to this increase) was convinced that the higher wages would
greatly reduce the company’s profits. Instead, in the very first year,
profits almost doubled. Paid a day, practically no workers left—in fact,
the Ford Motor Company soon had a waiting list.</p>
<p>But, short of the costs of turnover, rehiring or retraining and so
on, the manual worker is still being seen as a cost. This is true even
in Japan, despite the emphasis on lifetime employment and on building a
“loyal,” permanent workforce. And short of the cost of turnover, the
management of people at work, based on millennia of work being almost
totally manual work, still assumes that with the exception of a few
highly skilled people one manual worker is like any other manual
worker.</p>
<p>This is definitely not true for knowledge work.</p>
<p>Employees who do manual work do not own the means of production. They
may, and often do, have a lot of valuable experience. But that
experience is valuable only at the place where they work. It is not
portable.</p>
<p>But knowledge workers own the means of production. It is the
knowledge between their ears. And it is a totally portable and enormous
capital asset. Because knowledge workers own their means of production,
they are mobile. Manual workers need the job much more than the job
needs them. It may still not be true for all knowledge workers that the
organization needs them more than they need the organization. But for
most of them it is a symbiotic relationship in which they need each
other in equal measure.</p>
<p>Management’s duty is to preserve the assets of the institution in its
care. What does this mean when the knowledge of the individual knowledge
worker becomes an asset and, in more and more cases, the main asset of
an institution? What does this mean for personnel policy? What is needed
to attract and to hold the highest-producing knowledge workers? What is
needed to increase their productivity and to convert their increased
productivity into performance capacity for the organization?</p>
<p>III The Technologists</p>
<p>So far we have discussed the productivity of knowledge workers doing
knowledge work. But a very large number of knowledge workers do both
knowledge work and manual work. I call them “technologists.”</p>
<p>This group includes people who apply knowledge of the highest
order.</p>
<p>Surgeons preparing for an operation to correct a brain aneurysm
before it produces a lethal brain hemorrhage spend hours in diagnosis
before they cut—and that requires specialized knowledge of the highest
order. And then again, during the surgery, an unexpected complication
may occur that calls for theoretical knowledge and judgment, both of the
very highest order. But the surgery itself is manual work—and manual
work consisting of repetitive manual operations in which the emphasis is
on speed, accuracy, uniformity. And these operations are studied,
organized, learned and practiced exactly like any manual work, that is,
by the same methods Taylor first developed for factory work.</p>
<p>But the technologist group also contains large numbers of people in
whose work knowledge is relatively subordinate—though it is always
crucial.</p>
<p>The file clerk’s job—and that of her computer-operator
successor—requires knowledge of the alphabet that no experience can
teach. This knowledge is a small part of an otherwise manual task. But
it is the foundation and absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>Technologists may be the single biggest group of knowledge workers.
They may also be the fastest-growing group. They include the great
majority of health care workers: lab technicians; rehabilitation
technicians; technicians in imaging such as X-ray, ultrasound,
magnetic-resonance imaging, and so on. They include dentists and all
dental support people. They include automobile mechanics and all kinds
of repair and installation people. In fact, the technologist may be the
true successor to the 19th- and 20th-century skilled workers.</p>
<p>Technologists are also the one group in which developed countries can
have a true and long-lasting competitive advantage.</p>
<p>When it comes to truly high knowledge, no country can any longer have
much of a lead, the way 19th-century Germany had through its university.
Among theoretical physicists, mathematicians, economic theorists and the
like, there is no “nationality.” And any country can, at fairly low
cost, train a substantial number of high-knowledge people. India, for
instance, despite her poverty, has been training fairly large numbers of
first-rate physicians and first-rate computer programmers. Similarly (as
discussed earlier in this chapter), there is no “nationality” in respect
to the productivity of manual labor. Training based on Scientific
Management has made all countries capable of attaining, overnight, the
manual-worker productivity of the most advanced country, industry or
company. Only in educating technologists can the developed countries
still have a meaningful competitive edge, and for some time to come.</p>
<p>The United States is the only country that has actually developed
this advantage—through its so far unique nationwide systems of community
colleges. The community college was actually designed (beginning in the
1920s) to educate technologists who have both the needed theoretical
knowledge and the manual skill. On this, I am convinced, rests both the
still huge productivity advantage of the American economy and the—so far
unique—American ability to create, almost overnight, new and different
industries.</p>
<p>Nothing quite like the American community college exists anywhere
else so far. The famous Japanese school system produces either people
prepared only for manual work or people prepared only for knowledge
work. Only in the year 2003 is the first Japanese institution devoted to
training technologists supposed to get started. Even more famous is the
German apprenticeship system. Started in the 1830s, it was one of the
main factors in Germany’s becoming the world’s leading manufacturer. But
it focused—and still focuses—primarily on manual skills and slights
theoretical knowledge. It is thus in danger of becoming rapidly
obsolete.</p>
<p>But these other developed countries should be expected to catch up
with the United States fairly fast. Other countries—“emerging ones” or
“Third World” ones—are, however, likely to be decades behind—in part
because educating technologists is expensive, in part because in these
countries people of knowledge still look down with disdain, if not with
contempt, on working with one’s hands. “That’s what we have servants
for,” is still their prevailing attitude. In developed countries,
however—and again foremost in the United States—more and more manual
workers are going to be technologists. In increasing knowledge-worker
productivity, increasing the productivity of the technologists therefore
deserves to be given high priority.</p>
<p>The job was actually done—more than seventy years ago—by the American
Telephone Company (ATandandandandT) for its technologists, the people
who install, maintain, replace telephones, whether in the home or in the
office.</p>
<p>By the early 1920s the technologists working outside the telephone
office and at the customer’s location had become a major cost center—and
at the same time a major cause of customer unhappiness and
dissatisfaction. It took about five years or so, from 1920 until 1925,
for ATandandandandT—which had by that time acquired a near monopoly on
providing telephone service in the United States and in parts of
Canada—to realize that the task was not installing, maintaining,
repairing and replacing telephones and telephone connections. The task
was to create a satisfied customer. It became fairly easy to organize
the job. It meant, first, that the technicians themselves had to define
what “satisfaction” meant. The results were standards that established
that every order for a new telephone or an additional telephone
connection would have to be satisfied within at most forty-eight hours,
and that every request for repair would have to be satisfied the same
day if made before noon, or by noon the following day. Then it became
clear that the individual service people—in those days all men, of
course—would have to be active participants in such decisions as whether
to have one person installing and replacing telephones, and another one
maintaining and repairing them, or whether the same people had to be
able to do all jobs—which in the end turned out to be the right answer.
These people had to be taught a very substantial amount of theoretical
knowledge—and in those days few of them had more than six years of
schooling. They had to understand how a telephone works. They had to
understand how a switch-board works. They had to understand how the
telephone system works. These people were not qualified engineers or
skilled craftsmen. But they had to know enough electronics to diagnose
unexpected problems and to be able to cope with them. Then they were
trained in the repetitive manual operation or in the “one right way,”
that is, through the methods of Scientific Management. And they made the
decisions, for example, where and how to connect the individual
telephone to the system, and what particular kind of telephone and
service would be the most suitable for a given home or a given office.
They had to become salesmen in addition to being servicemen.</p>
<p>Finally, the telephone company faced the problem of how to define
quality. The technologist had to work by himself. He could not be
supervised. He, therefore, had to define quality and had to deliver it.
It took several more years before that was answered. At first the
telephone company thought that this meant a sample check that had
supervisors go out and look at a sample—maybe every twentieth or
thirtieth job done by an individual service person—and check it for
quality. This very soon turned out to be the wrong way of doing the job,
annoying both servicemen and customers alike. Then the telephone company
defined quality as “no complaints”—and soon found out that only
extremely unhappy customers complained. It then had to redefine quality
as “positive customer satisfaction.” And this then meant in the end that
the serviceman himself controlled quality—for example, by calling up a
week or ten days after he had done a job and asking the customer whether
the work was satisfactory and whether there was anything more the
technician could possibly do to give the customer the best possible and
most satisfactory service.</p>
<p>I have intentionally gone into considerable detail in describing this
early example because it exemplifies the three elements for making
effective the worker who is both a knowledge worker and a manual
worker.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is, first, the answer to the question: “What is the
task?”—the key question in making every knowledge worker productive. As
the example of the Bell System shows, this is not an obvious answer. And
as the Bell System people learned, the only people who know the answer
to this are the technologists themselves. In fact, until they asked the
technologists, they floundered. But as soon as the technologists were
asked, the answer came back loud and clear: a satisfied
customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the technologists had to take full responsibility for giving
customer satisfaction, that is, for delivering quality. This then showed
what formal knowledge the technologist needed. And then, only then,
could the manual part of the job be organized for manual-worker
productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Above all, this example shows that technologists have to be
treated as knowledge workers. No matter how important the manual part of
their work—and it may take the bulk of their time, as it did in the case
of the ATandandandandT installers—the focus has to be on making the
technologist knowledgeable, responsible, productive as a knowledge
worker.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>IV KNOWLEDGE WORK AS A SYSTEM</p>
<p>Productivity of the knowledge worker will almost always require that
the work itself be restructured and be made part of a system.</p>
<p>One example is servicing expensive equipment, such as huge and
expensive earth-moving machines. Traditionally, this had been seen as
distinct and separate from the job of making and selling the machines.
But when the U.S. Caterpillar Company, the world’s largest producer of
such equipment, asked “What are we getting paid for?” the answer was,
“We are not getting paid for machinery. We are getting paid for what the
machinery does at the customer’s place of business. That means keeping
the equipment running, since even one hour during which the equipment is
out of operation may cost the customer far more than the equipment
itself.” In other words, the answer to “What is our business?” was
“Service.” This then led to a total restructuring of operations all the
way back to the factory, so that the customer can be guaranteed
continuing operations and immediate repairs or replacements. And the
service representative, usually a technologist, has become the true
“decision maker.”</p>
<p>Another example. A group of about twenty-five orthopedic surgeons in
a Midwestern U.S. city have organized themselves as a “system” to
produce highest-quality work: to use optimally the limited and expensive
resources of operating and recovery rooms; to use optimally the
supporting knowledge people such as anesthesiologists or surgical
nurses; to build in continuous learning and continuous innovation into
the work of the entire group and of every member thereof; and finally,
to minimize costs. Each of the surgeons retains full control of his or
her practice. He or she is fully responsible for obtaining and treating
the individual patient. Traditionally each surgeon schedules surgeries
early in the morning. Hence, operating rooms and recovery rooms are
standing empty most of the time. The group now schedules the use of
operating and recovery rooms for the entire group so that this scarce
and extremely expensive resource is used ten hours a day. The group, as
a group, decides on the standardization of tools and equipment so as to
obtain the highest quality at the lowest cost. Finally, the group has
also built quality control into its system. Every three months three
different surgeons are designated to scrutinize every operation done by
each of the members—the diagnosis, the surgery, the after-treatment.
They then sit down with the individual surgeons and discuss their
performance. They suggest where there is need for improvement. But they
also may recommend that a certain surgeon be asked to leave the group,
as his or her work is not satisfactory. And each year the quality
standards that these supervising committees apply are discussed with the
whole group and are raised, and often substantially. As a result this
group now does almost four times as much work as it did before. It has
cut the costs by 50 percent, half of it by cutting back on the waste of
operating and recovery rooms, half by standardizing tools and equipment.
And in such measurable areas as success rates in knee replacements or
shoulder replacements, or in recovery after sports injuries, it has
greatly improved its results.</p>
<p>What to do about knowledge-worker productivity is thus largely known.
So is how to do it.</p>
<p>But How to Begin?</p>
<p>Making knowledge workers productive requires changes in basic
attitude—whereas making the manual worker more productive only required
telling the worker how to do the job. And making knowledge workers
productive requires changes in attitude, not only on the part of the
individual knowledge worker but on the part of the whole organization.
It therefore has to be “piloted”—as any major change should be (on this
see Chapter Three). The first step is to find an area in the
organization or a group of knowledge workers who are receptive. The
orthopedic surgeons, for instance, first had their new ideas tried out
by four physicians—one an older man, three younger people—who had long
argued for radical changes. Then there is a need to work consistently,
patiently, and for a considerable length of uninterrupted time, in this
small area or with this small group. For the first attempts, even if
greeted with great enthusiasm, will almost certainly run into all kinds
of unexpected problems. It is only after the productivity of this small
group of knowledge workers has been substantially increased that the new
ways of doing the work can be extended to a larger area, if not to the
entire organization. And by then we will also have learned where the
main problems are; where, for example, resistance can be expected (e.g.,
from middle management), or what changes in task, organization,
measurements and attitudes are needed for full effectiveness. To try to
jump the pilot stage—and there is always pressure to do so—only means
that the mistakes become public, while the successes stay hidden. It
only means discrediting the entire enterprise. But if properly piloted,
we can already do a great deal to improve—and
drastically—knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<p>Knowledge-worker productivity is the biggest of the 21st-century
management challenges. In the developed countries it is their first
survival requirement. In no other way can the developed countries hope
to maintain themselves, let alone to maintain their leadership and their
standards of living.</p>
<p>In the last hundred years, that is, in the 20th century, this
leadership very largely depended on making the manual worker productive.
Any country, any industry, any business can do that today—using the
methods that the developed countries have worked out and put into
practice in the 120 years since Frederick Winslow Taylor first looked at
manual work. Anybody today, anyplace, can apply those policies to
training, to the organization of the work and to the productivity of
workers, even if they are barely literate, if not illiterate, and
totally unskilled.</p>
<p>Above all (as discussed in Chapter Two), the supply of young people
available for manual work will be rapidly shrinking in the developed
countries—in the West and in Japan very fast, in the United States
somewhat more slowly—whereas the supply of such people will still grow
fast in the emerging and developing countries, at least for another
thirty or forty years. The only possible advantage developed countries
can hope to have is in the supply of people prepared, educated and
trained for knowledge work. There, for another fifty years, the
developed countries can expect to have substantial advantages, both in
quality and in quantity. But whether this advantage will translate into
performance depends on the ability of the developed countries—and of
every industry in it, of every company in it, of every institution in
it—to raise the productivity of the knowledge worker and to raise it as
fast as the developed countries, in the last hundred years, have raised
the productivity of the manual worker.</p>
<p>The countries and the industries that have emerged as the leaders in
the last hundred years in the world are the countries and the industries
that have led in raising the productivity of the manual worker: the
United States first, Japan and Germany second. Fifty years from now—if
not much sooner—the leadership in the world economy will have moved to
the countries and to the industries that have most systematically and
most successfully raised knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<p>V The Governance of the Corporation</p>
<p>What does the emergence of the knowledge worker and of
knowledge-worker productivity mean for the governance of the
corporation? What do they mean for the future and structure of the
economic system?</p>
<p>In the last ten or fifteen years pension funds and other
institutional investors became the main share owners of the equity
capital of publicly owned companies in all developed countries (as
discussed several times in this book). This has triggered in the United
States a furious debate on the governance of corporations (on this see
also Chapters One and Two). For with the emergence of pension funds and
mutual funds as the owners of publicly owned companies, power has
shifted to these new owners.</p>
<p>Similar shifts in both the definition of the purpose of economic
organizations such as the business corporation, and of their governance,
can be expected to occur in all developed countries.</p>
<p>But within a fairly short period of time, we will face the problem of
the governance of corporations again. We will have to redefine the
purpose of the employing organization and of its management as both,
satisfying the legal owners, such as share-holders, and satisfying the
owners of the human capital that gives the organization its
wealth-producing power, that is, satisfying the knowledge workers. For
increasingly the ability of organizations—and not only of businesses—to
survive will come to depend on their “comparative advantage” in making
the knowledge worker productive. And the ability to attract and hold the
best of the knowledge workers is the first and most fundamental
precondition.</p>
<p>Can this be measured, however? Or is it purely an “intangible”? This
will surely be a central problem—for management, for investors, for
capital markets. What does “Capitalism” mean when Knowledge
governs—rather than Money? And what do “Free Markets” mean when
knowledge workers—and no one else can “own” knowledge—are the true
assets? Knowledge workers can be neither bought nor sold. They do not
come with a merger or an acquisition. In fact, though the greatest
“value,” they have no “market value”—that means, of course, that they
are not an “asset” in any sense of the term.</p>
<p>These questions go far beyond the scope of this book—let alone far
beyond the author’s competence. But it is certain that the emergence of
the knowledge worker and of the knowledge worker’s productivity as key
questions will, within a few decades, bring about fundamental changes in
the very structure and nature of THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>For work in the oldest knowledge profession, that is, in medicine,
Taylor’s close contemporary, William Osler (1849–1919), did what Taylor
did and at the same time—in his 1892 book The Principles and Practice of
Medicine (arguably the best textbook since Euclid’s Geometry in the 3rd
century b.c.). Osler’s work has rightly been called the application of
Scientific Management to Medical Diagnosis. And, like Taylor, Osler
preached that there is no “skill,” there is only method.</li>

<p>What Are My Strengths? • How Do I Perform? • Where Do I Belong? •
What Is My Contribution? • Relationship Responsibility • The Second Half
of Your Life</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>More and more people in the workforce—and most knowledge workers—will
have to MANAGE THEMSELVES. They will have to place themselves where they
can make the greatest contribution; they will have to learn to develop
themselves. They will have to learn to stay young and mentally alive
during a fifty-year working life. They will have to learn how and when
to change what they do, how they do it and when they do it.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers are likely to outlive their employing organization.
Even if knowledge workers postpone entry into the labor force as long as
possible—if, for instance, they stay in school till their late twenties
to get a doctorate—they are likely, with present life expectancies in
the developed countries, to live into their eighties. And they are
likely to have to keep working, if only part-time, until they are around
seventy-five or older. The average working life, in other words, is
likely to be fifty years, especially for knowledge workers. But the
average life expectancy of a successful business is only thirty
years—and in a period of great turbulence such as the one we are living
in, it is unlikely to be even that long. Even organizations that
normally are long-lived if not expected to live forever—schools and
universities, hospitals, government agencies—will see rapid changes in
the period of turbulence we have already entered. Even if they
survive—and a great many surely will not, at least not in their present
form—they will change their structure, the work they are doing, the
knowledges they require and the kind of people they employ.
Increasingly, therefore, workers, and especially knowledge workers, will
outlive any one employer, and will have to be prepared for more than one
job, more than one assignment, more than one career.</p>
<p>So far, this book has dealt with changes in the environment: in
society, economy, politics, technology. This concluding chapter deals
with the new demands on the individual.</p>
<p>The very great achievers, a Napoleon, a Leonardo da Vinci, a Mozart,
have always managed themselves. This in large measure made them great
achievers. But they were the rarest of exceptions. And they were so
unusual, both in their talents and in their achievements, as to be
considered outside the boundaries of normal human existence. Now even
people of modest endowments, that is, average mediocrities, will have to
learn to manage themselves.</p>
<p>Knowledge workers, therefore, face drastically new demands:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They have to ask: Who Am I? What Are My Strengths? HOW Do I
Work?</p></li>
<li><p>They have to ask: Where Do I Belong?</p></li>
<li><p>They have to ask: What Is My Contribution?</p></li>
<li><p>They have to take Relationship Responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p>They have to plan for the Second Half of Their Lives.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I What Are My Strengths?</p>
<p>Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually
wrong. People know what they are not good at more often—and even there
people are more often wrong than right. And yet, one can only perform
with one’s strengths. One cannot build performance on weaknesses, let
alone on something one cannot do at all.</p>
<p>For the great majority of people, to know their strengths was
irrelevant only a few decades ago. One was born into a job and into a
line of work. The peasant’s son became a peasant. If he was not good at
being a peasant, he failed. The artisan’s son was similarly going to be
an artisan, and so on. But now people have choices. They therefore have
to know their strengths so that they can know where they belong.</p>
<p>There is only one way to find out: The Feedback Analysis. Whenever
one makes a key decision, and whenever one does a key action, one writes
down what one expects will happen. And nine months or twelve months
later one then feeds back from results to expectations. I have been
doing this for some fifteen to twenty years now. And every time I do it
I am surprised. And so is everyone who has ever done this.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new method. It was invented sometime in the
14th century, by an otherwise totally obscure German theologian. Some
150 years later Jean Calvin in Geneva (1509–1564), father of Calvinism,
and Ignatius Loyola (1491–1556), the founder of the Jesuit Order, quite
independent of each other, picked up the idea and incorporated it into
their rules for every member of their groups, that is, for the Calvinist
pastor and the Jesuit priest. This explains why these two new
institutions (both founded in the same year, in 1536) had come within
thirty years to dominate Europe: Calvinism the Protestant north; the
Jesuit Order the Catholic south. By that time each group contained so
many thousands of members that most of them had to be ordinary rather
than exceptional. Many of them worked alone, if not in complete
isolation. Many of them had to work underground and in constant fear of
persecution. Yet very few defected. The routine feedback from results to
expectations reaffirmed them in their commitment. It enabled them to
focus on performance and results, and with it, on achievement and
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, this
simple procedure will tell people first where their strengths are—and
this is probably the most important thing to know about oneself. It will
show them what they do or fail to do that deprives them of the full
yield from their strengths. It will show them where they are not
particularly competent. And it will finally show them where they have no
strengths and cannot perform.</p>
<p>Several action conclusions follow from the feedback analysis.</p>
<p>The first, and most important, conclusion: Concentrate on your
strengths. Place yourself where your strengths can produce performance
and results.</p>
<p>Second: Work on improving your strengths. The feedback analysis
rapidly shows where a person needs to improve skills or has to acquire
new knowledge. It will show where skills and knowledge are no longer
adequate and have to be updated. It will also show the gaps in one’s
knowledge.</p>
<p>And one can usually acquire enough of any skill or knowledge not to
be incompetent in it.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are born. But almost everyone can learn trigonometry.
And the same holds for foreign languages or for major disciplines,
whether history or economics or chemistry.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is the third conclusion: the feed-back
analysis soon identifies the areas where intellectual arrogance causes
disabling ignorance. Far too many people—and especially people with high
knowledge in one area—are contemptuous of knowledge in other areas or
believe that being “bright” is a substitute for knowing. And then the
feedback analysis soon shows that a main reason for poor performance is
the result of simply not knowing enough, or the result of being
contemptuous of knowledge outside one’s own specialty.</p>
<p>First-rate engineers tend to take pride in not knowing anything about
people—human beings are much too disorderly for the good engineering
mind. And accountants, too, tend to think it unnecessary to know about
people. Human Resources people, by contrast, often pride themselves of
their ignorance of elementary accounting or of quantitative methods
altogether. Brilliant executives who are being posted abroad often
believe that business skill is sufficient, and dismiss learning about
the history, the arts, the culture, the traditions of the country where
they are now expected to perform—only to find that their brilliant
business skills produce no results.</p>
<p>One important action conclusion from the feedback analysis is thus to
overcome intellectual arrogance and work on acquiring the skills and
knowledge needed to make one’s strengths fully productive.</p>
<p>An equally important action conclusion is to remedy one’s bad
habits—things one does or fails to do that inhibit effectiveness and
performance. They quickly show up in the feedback analysis.</p>
<p>The analysis may show, for instance, that a planner’s beautiful plans
die because he or she does not follow through. Like so many brilliant
people, he or she believes that ideas move mountains. But bulldozers
move mountains; ideas show where the bulldozers have to go to work. The
most brilliant planners far too often stop when the plan is completed.
But that is when the work begins. Then the planner needs to find the
people to carry out the plan, explain the plan to them, teach them,
adapt and change the plan as it moves from planning to doing and,
finally, decide when to stop pushing the plan.</p>
<p>But the analysis may also show that a person fails to obtain results
because he or she lacks manners. Bright people—especially bright young
people—often do not understand that manners are the “lubricating oil” of
an organization.</p>
<p>It is a Law of Nature that two moving bodies in contact with each
other create friction. Two human beings in contact with each other
therefore always create friction. And then manners are the lubricating
oil that enables these two moving bodies to work together, whether they
like each other or not—simple things like saying “please” and “thank
you” and knowing a person’s birthday or name, and remembering to ask
after the person’s family. If the analysis shows that brilliant work
fails again and again as soon as it requires cooperation by others, it
probably indicates a lack of courtesy, that is, of manners.</p>
<p>The next action conclusion from the feedback analysis is what not to
do.</p>
<p>Feeding back from results to expectations soon shows where a person
should not try to do anything at all. It shows the areas in which a
person lacks the minimum endowment needed—and there are always many such
areas for any person. Not enough people have even one first-rate skill
or knowledge area, but all of us have an infinite number of areas in
which we have no talent, no skill and little chance to become even
mediocre. And in these areas a person—and especially a knowledge
worker—should not take on work, jobs, assignments.</p>
<p>The final action conclusion is to waste as little effort as possible
on improving areas of low competence. Concentration should be on areas
of high competence and high skill. It takes far more energy and far more
work to improve from incompetence to low mediocrity than it takes to
improve from first-rate performance to excellence. And yet most
people—and equally most teachers and most organizations—try to
concentrate on making an incompetent person into a low mediocrity. The
energy and resources—and time—should instead go into making a competent
person into a star performer.</p>
<p>How Do I Perform?</p>
<p>How Do I Perform? is as important a question—and especially for
knowledge workers—as What Are My Strengths?</p>
<p>In fact, it may be an even more important question. Amazingly few
people know how they get things done. On the contrary, most of us do not
even know that different people work and perform differently. They
therefore work in ways that are not their ways—and that almost
guarantees nonperformance.</p>
<p>The main reason perhaps that so many people do not know how they
perform is that the schools throughout history insisted out of necessity
on there being only one way for every-body to do his or her schoolwork.
The teacher who ran a classroom of forty youngsters simply did not have
the time to find out how each of the students performed. The teacher, on
the contrary, had to insist that all do the same work, the same way, the
same time. And so historically everybody grew up with one way of doing
the work. Here perhaps is where the new technology may have the greatest
and most beneficial impact. It should enable even the merely competent
teacher to find out how a student learns and then to encourage the
student to do the work the way that fits the individual student.</p>
<p>Like one’s strengths, how one performs is individual. It is
personality. Whether personality be “nature” or “nurture,” it surely is
formed long before the person goes to work. And how a person performs is
a “given,” just as what a person is good at or not good at is a “given.”
It can be modified, but it is unlikely to be changed. And just as people
have results by doing what they are good at, people have results by
performing how they perform.</p>
<p>The feedback analysis may indicate that there is something amiss in
how one performs. But rarely does it identify the cause. It is, however,
normally not too difficult to find out. It takes a few years of work
experience. And then one can ask—and quickly answer—how one performs.
For a few common personality traits usually determine how one achieves
results.</p>
<p>Am I a Reader or a Listener?</p>
<p>The first thing to know about how one performs is whether one is a
reader or a listener. Yet very few people even know that there are
readers and there are listeners, and that very few people are both. Even
fewer know which of the two they themselves are. But a few examples will
show how damaging it is not to know.</p>
<p>When he was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Europe,
General Dwight (Ike) Eisenhower was the darling of the press, and
attendance at one of his press conferences was considered a rare treat.
These conferences were famous for their style, for Eisenhower’s total
command of whatever question was being asked and, equally, for his
ability to describe a situation or to explain a policy in two or three
beautifully polished and elegant sentences. Ten years later, President
Eisenhower was held in open contempt by his former admirers. They
considered him a buffoon. He never, they complained, even addressed
himself to the question asked, but rambled on endlessly about something
else. And he was constantly ridiculed for butchering the King’s English
in his incoherent and ungrammatical answers. Yet Eisenhower had owed his
brilliant earlier career in large measure to a virtuoso performance as a
speechwriter for General MacArthur, one of the most demanding stylists
in American public life.</p>
<p>The explanation: Eisenhower apparently did not know himself that he
was a reader and not a listener. When he was Commander-in-Chief in
Europe, his aides made sure that every question from the press was
handed in in writing at least half an hour before the conference began.
And then Eisenhower was in total command. When he became President he
succeeded two listeners, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Both
men knew this and both enjoyed free-for-all press conferences. Roosevelt
knew himself to be so much of a listener that he insisted that
everything first be read out loud to him—only then did he look at
anything in writing. And when Truman realized, after becoming President,
that he needed to learn about foreign and military affairs—neither of
which he had ever been much interested in before—he arranged for his two
ablest Cabinet members, General Marshall and Dean Acheson, to give him a
daily tutorial in which each delivered a forty-minute spoken
presentation, after which the President asked questions. Eisenhower,
apparently, felt that he had to do what his two famous predecessors had
done. As a result, he never even heard the question the journalists
asked. And he was not even an extreme case of a nonlistener.</p>
<p>A few years later Lyndon Johnson destroyed his Presidency, in large
measure, by not knowing that he—unlike Eisenhower—was a listener. His
predecessor, John Kennedy, who knew that he was a reader, had assembled
as his assistants a brilliant group of writers such as Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr., the historian, and Bill Moyers, a first-rate
journalist. Kennedy made sure that they first wrote to him before
discussing their memos in person. Johnson kept these people as his
staff—and they kept on writing. He never, apparently, got one word of
what they wrote. Yet, as a senator, Johnson, only four years earlier,
had been superb; for parliamentarians have, above all, to be
listeners.</p>
<p>Only a century ago very few people, even in the most highly developed
country, knew whether they were right-handed or left-handed.
Left-handers were suppressed. Few actually became competent
right-handers. Most of them ended up as incompetent no-handers and with
severe emotional damage such as stuttering.</p>
<p>But only one of every ten human beings is left-handed. The ratio of
listeners to readers seems, however, to be close to fifty-fifty. Yet,
just as few left-handers became competent right-handers, few listeners
can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers—and vice
versa.</p>
<p>The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the
fate of Lyndon Johnson, while the reader who tries to be a listener will
suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or
achieve.</p>
<p>How Do I Learn?</p>
<p>The second thing to know about how one performs is to know how one
learns. There things may be even worse than they are in respect to
readers and listeners. For schools everywhere are organized on the
assumption that there is one right way to learn, and that it is the same
way for everybody.</p>
<p>Many first-class writers—Winston Churchill is but one example—do
poorly in school, and they tend to remember their school as pure
torture. Yet few of their classmates have the same memory of the same
school and the same teachers; they may not have enjoyed the school very
much but the worst they suffered was boredom. The explanation is that
first-rate writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading.
They learn by writing. Since this is not the way the school allows them
to learn, they get poor grades. And to be forced to learn the way the
school teaches is sheer hell for them and pure torture.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of different ways in which people learn.</p>
<p>Beethoven left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks. Yet he
himself said that he never looked at a sketchbook when he actually wrote
his compositions. When asked, “Why then, do you keep a sketchbook?” he
is reported to have answered, “If I don’t write it down immediately I
forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook I never forget it,
and I never have to look it up again.”</p>
<p>Alfred Sloan—the man who built General Motors into the world’s
largest, and for sixty years the world’s most successful, manufacturing
company—conducted most of his management business in small and lively
meetings. As soon as a meeting was over, Sloan went to his office and
spent several hours composing a letter to one of the meeting’s
participants, in which he brought out the key questions discussed in the
meeting, the issues the meeting raised, the decisions it reached and the
problems it uncovered but did not solve. When complimented on these
letters, he is reported to have said, “If I do not sit down immediately
after the meeting and think through what it actually was all about, and
then put it down in writing, I will have forgotten it within twenty-four
hours. That’s why I write these letters.”</p>
<p>A chief executive officer who, in the 1950s and 1960s, converted what
was a small and mediocre family firm into the world’s leading company in
its industry, was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into
his office, usually once a week, having them sit in a half-circle around
his desk, and then talking at them for two or three hours. He very
rarely asked these people for their comments or their questions. He
argued with himself. He raised the possibility of a policy
move—acquisition of a small and failing company in the industry that
had, however, some special technology, for instance. He always took
three different positions on every one of these questions: one in favor
of the move, one against the move and one on the conditions under which
such a move might make sense. He needed an audience to hear himself
talk. It was the way he learned. And again, while a fairly extreme case,
he was by no means an unusual one. Successful trial lawyers learn the
same way; so do many medical diagnosticians.</p>
<p>There are probably half a dozen different ways to learn. There are
people who learn by taking copious notes—the way Beethoven did. But
Alfred Sloan never took a note in a meeting, nor did the CEO mentioned
above. There are people who learn by hearing themselves talk. There are
people who learn by writing. There are people who learn by doing. And in
an (informal) survey I once took of professors in American universities
who successfully publish scholarly books of wide appeal, I was told
again and again, “To hear myself talk is the reason why I teach; because
then I can write.”</p>
<p>Actually, of all the important pieces of self-knowledge, this is one
of the easiest to acquire. When I ask people, “How do you learn?” most
of them know it. But when I then ask, “Do you act on this knowledge?”
few do. And yet to act on this knowledge is the key to performance—or
rather not to act on this knowledge is to condemn oneself to
nonperformance.</p>
<p>To ask “How do I perform?” and “How do I learn?” are the most
important first questions to ask. But they are by no means the only
ones. To manage oneself one has to ask: “Do I work well with people, or
am I a loner?” And if one finds out that one works well with people, one
asks: “In what relationship do I work well with people?”</p>
<p>Some people work best as subordinates.</p>
<p>The prime example is the great American military hero of World War
II, General George Patton. He was America’s top troop commander. Yet,
when he was proposed for an independent command, General George
Marshall, the American Chief of Staff—and probably the most successful
picker of men in American history—said: “Patton is the best subordinate
the American Army has ever produced, but he would be the worst
commander.”</p>
<p>Some people work best as team members. Some people work exceedingly
well as coaches and mentors, and some people are simply incompetent to
be mentors.</p>
<p>Another important thing to know about how one performs is whether one
performs well under stress, or whether one needs a highly structured and
predictable environment. Another trait: Does one work best as a minnow
in a big organization, or best as a big fish in a small organization?
Few people work well in both ways. Again and again people who have been
very successful in a large organization—for example, the General
Electric Company or Citibank—flounder miserably when they move into a
small organization. And again and again people who perform brilliantly
in a small organization flounder miserably when they take a job with a
big organization.</p>
<p>Another crucial question: “Do I produce results as a decision maker
or as an adviser?” A great many people perform best as advisers, but
cannot take the burden and pressure of the decision. A good many people,
by contrast, need an adviser to force themselves to think, but then they
can take the decision and act on it with speed, self-confidence and
courage.</p>
<p>This is a reason, by the way, why the number-two person in an
organization often fails when promoted into the top spot. The top spot
requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers in the top spot often
put somebody whom they trust into the number-two spot as their
adviser—and in that position that person is outstanding. But when then
promoted into the number-one spot, the person fails. He or she knows
what the decision should be but cannot take decision-making
responsibility.</p>
<p>The action conclusion: Again, do not try to change yourself—it is
unlikely to be successful. But work, and hard, to improve the way you
perform. And try not to do work of any kind in a way you do not perform
or perform poorly.</p>
<p>What Are My Values?</p>
<p>To be able to manage oneself, one finally has to know: “What are my
values?”</p>
<p>In respect to ethics, the rules are the same for everybody, and the
test is a simple one—I call it the “mirror test.”</p>
<p>As the story goes, the most highly respected diplomatist of all the
Great Powers in the early years of this century was the German
Ambassador in London. He was clearly destined for higher things, at
least to become his country’s Foreign Minister, if not German Federal
Chancellor. Yet, in 1906, he abruptly resigned. King Edward VII had then
been on the British throne for five years, and the diplomatic corps was
going to give him a big dinner. The German ambassador, being the dean of
the diplomatic corps—he had been in London for close to fifteen
years—was to be the chairman of that dinner. King Edward VII was a
notorious womanizer and made it clear what kind of dinner he wanted—at
the end, after the desert had been served, a huge cake was going to
appear, and out of it would jump a dozen or more naked prostitutes as
the lights were dimmed. And the German ambassador resigned rather than
preside over this dinner. “I refuse to see a pimp in the mirror in the
morning, when I shave.”</p>
<p>This is the mirror test. What ethics requires is to ask oneself:
“What kind of person do I want to see when I shave myself in the
morning, or put on my lipstick in the morning?” Ethics, in other words,
are a clear value system. And they do not vary much—what is ethical
behavior in one kind of organization or situation is ethical behavior in
another kind of organization or situation.</p>
<p>But ethics are only a part of the value system and, especially, only
a part of the value system of an organization.</p>
<p>To work in an organization the value system of which is unacceptable
to a person, or incompatible with it, condemns the person both to
frustration and to nonperformance.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of values people have to learn about
themselves.</p>
<p>A brilliant and highly successful executive found herself totally
frustrated after her old company was acquired by a bigger one. She
actually got a big promotion—and a promotion into doing the kind of work
she did best. It was part of her job to select people for important
positions. She deeply believed that one only hired people from the
outside into important positions after having exhausted all inside
possibilities. The company in which she now found herself as a senior
human resources executive believed, however, that in staffing an
important position that had become vacant, one first looked at the
outside, “to bring in fresh blood.” There is something to be said for
either way (though, in my experience, the proper one is to do some of
both). But they are fundamentally incompatible, not as policies but as
values. They bespeak a different view of the relationship between
organization and people; a different view of the responsibility of an
organization to its people and in respect to developing them; a
different view in what is the most important contribution of a person to
an enterprise, and so on. After several years of frustration, the human
resources executive quit, at considerable financial loss to herself. Her
values and the values of the organization simply were not
compatible.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether to try to obtain results in a pharmaceutical
company by making constant, small improvements, or by occasional, highly
expensive and risky “breakthroughs” is not primarily an economic
question. The results of either strategy may be pretty much the same. It
is at bottom a conflict of values—between a value system that sees the
contribution of a pharmaceutical company to help the already successful
physician to do better what he or she already does well, and a value
system that is “science” oriented.</p>
<p>It is similarly a value question whether a business should be run for
short-term results or for “the long run.” Financial analysts believe
that businesses can be run for both, simultaneously. Successful
businessmen know better. To be sure, everyone has to produce short-term
results. But in any conflict between short-term results and long-term
growth, one company decides in favor of long-term growth; another
company decides such a conflict in favor of short-term results. Again,
this is not primarily a disagreement on economics. It is fundamentally a
value conflict regarding the function of a business and the
responsibility of management.</p>
<p>In one of the fastest-growing pastoral churches in the United States,
success is being measured by the number of new parishioners. It is
believed that what matters is how many people join, and become regular
churchgoers, who never before came to church. The Good Lord, this church
believes, will then take care of the spiritual needs of a sufficient
number. Another pastoral, evangelical church believes that what matters
is the spiritual experience of people. It will ease out newcomers who
join the church but who then do not enter into the spiritual life of the
church.</p>
<p>Again, this is not a matter of numbers. At first glance it appears
that the second church grows more slowly. But it retains a far larger
proportion of newcomers than the first one does. Its growth, in other
words, is far more solid. This is also not a theological problem, or
only secondarily so. It is a value problem. One of the two pastors said
in a public debate, “Unless you first come to church you will never find
the Gate to the Kingdom of Heaven.” “No,” answered the other one. “Until
you first look for the Gate to the Kingdom of Heaven, you don’t belong
in church.”</p>
<p>Organizations have to have values. But so do people. To be effective
in an organization, one’s own values must be compatible with the
organization’s values. They do not need to be the same. But they must be
close enough so that they can coexist. Otherwise, the person will be
frustrated, but also the person will not produce results.</p>
<p>What to Do in a Value Conflict?</p>
<p>There rarely is a conflict between a person’s strengths and the way
that person performs. The two are complementary. But there is sometimes
a conflict between a person’s values and the same person’s strengths.
What one does well—even very well—and successfully may not fit with
one’s value system. It may not appear to that person as making a
contribution and as something to which to devote one’s life (or even a
substantial portion thereof).</p>
<p>If I may inject a personal note: I too, many years ago, had to decide
between what I was doing well and successfully, and my values. I was
doing extremely well as a young investment banker in London in the
mid-1930s; it clearly fitted my strengths. Yet I did not see myself
making a contribution as an asset manager of any kind. People, I
realized, were my values. And I saw no point in being the richest man in
the cemetery. I had no money, no job in a deep Depression and no
prospects. But I quit—and it was the right thing.</p>
<p>Values, in other words, are and should be the ultimate test.</p>
<p>II Where Do I Belong?</p>
<p>The answers to the three questions: “What are my strengths? How do I
perform? What are my values?” should enable the individual, and
especially the individual knowledge worker, to decide where he or she
belongs.</p>
<p>This is not a decision that most people can or should make at the
beginning of their careers.</p>
<p>To be sure, a small minority know very early where they belong.
Mathematicians, musicians or cooks, for instance, are usually
mathematicians, musicians or cooks by the time they are four or five
years old. Physicians usually decide in their teens, if not earlier. But
most people, and especially highly gifted people, do not really know
where they belong till they are well past their mid-twenties. By that
time, however, they should know where their strengths are. They should
know how they perform. And they should know what their values are.</p>
<p>And then they can and should decide where they belong. Or rather,
they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who
has learned that he or she does not really perform in a big organization
should have learned to say “no” when offered a position in a big
organization. The person who has learned that he or she is not a
decision maker should have learned to say “no” when offered a
decision-making assignment. A General Patton (who probably himself never
learned it) should have learned to say “no” when offered an independent
command, rather than a position as a high-level subordinate.</p>
<p>But also knowing the answer to these three questions enables people
to say to an opportunity, to an offer, to an assignment: “Yes, I’ll do
that. But this is the way I should be doing it. This is the way it
should be structured. This is the way my relationships should be. These
are the kind of results you should expect from me, and in this time
frame, because this is who I am.”</p>
<p>Successful careers are not “planned.” They are the careers of people
who are prepared for the opportunity because they know their strengths,
the way they work and their values. For knowing where one belongs makes
ordinary people—hardworking, competent but mediocre otherwise—into
outstanding performers.</p>
<p>III What Is My Contribution?</p>
<p>To ask “What is my contribution?” means moving from knowledge to
action. The question is not: “What do I want to contribute?” It is not:
“What am I told to contribute?” It is: “What should I contribute?”</p>
<p>This is a new question in human history. Traditionally, the task was
given. It was given either by the work itself—as was the task of the
peasant or the artisan. Or it was given by a master or a mistress, as
was the task of the domestic servant. And, until very recently, it was
taken for granted that most people were subordinates who did as they
were told.</p>
<p>The advent of the knowledge worker is changing this, and fast. The
first reaction to this change was to look at the employing organization
to give the answer.</p>
<p>“Career Planning” is what the Personnel Department—especially of the
large organization—was supposed to do in the 1950s and 1960s, for the
“Organization Man,” the new knowledge worker employee. In Japan it is
still the way knowledge workers are being managed. But even in Japan the
knowledge worker can increasingly expect to outlive the employing
organization.</p>
<p>Except in Japan, however, the “Organization Man” and the
career-planning Personnel Department have long become history. And with
them disappeared the notion that anyone but oneself can—or should—be the
“career planner.” The reaction in the sixties was for knowledge people
to ask: “What do I want to do?” People were told that “to do one’s own
thing” was the way to contribute. This was, for instance, what the
“student rebellion” of 1968 believed.</p>
<p>We soon found out, however, that it was as wrong an answer as was the
Organization Man. Very few of the people who believed that “doing one’s
own thing” leads to contribution, to self-fulfillment or to success
achieved any of the three.</p>
<p>But still, there is no return to the old answer, that is, to do what
you are being told, or what you are being assigned to. Knowledge
workers, in particular, will have to learn to ask: “What should MY
contribution be?” Only then should they ask: “Does this fit my
strengths? Is this what I want to do?” And “Do I find this rewarding and
stimulating?”</p>
<p>The best example I know of is the way Harry Truman repositioned
himself when he became President of the United States, upon the sudden
death of Franklin D. Roosevelt at the end of World War II. Truman had
been picked for the Vice Presidency because he was totally concerned
with domestic issues. For it was then generally believed that with the
end of the war—and the end was clearly in sight—the U.S. would return to
almost exclusive concern with domestic affairs. Truman had never shown
the slightest interest in foreign affairs, knew nothing about them, and
was kept in total ignorance of them. He was still totally focused on
domestic affairs when, within a few weeks after his ascendancy, he went
to the Potsdam Conference after Germany surrendered. There he sat for a
week, with Churchill on one side and Stalin on the other, and realized,
to his horror, that foreign affairs would dominate, but also that he
knew absolutely nothing about them. He came back from Potsdam convinced
that he had to give up what he wanted to do and instead had to
concentrate on what he had to do, that is, on foreign affairs. He
immediately—as already mentioned—put himself into school with General
Marshall and Dean Acheson as his tutors. Within a few months he was a
master of foreign affairs and he, rather than Churchill or Stalin,
created the postwar world—with his policy of containing Communism and
pushing it back from Iran and Greece; with the Marshall Plan that
rescued Western Europe; with the decision to rebuild Japan; and finally,
with the call for worldwide economic development.</p>
<p>By contrast, Lyndon Johnson lost both the Vietnam War and his
domestic policies because he clung to “What do I want to do?” instead of
asking himself “What should my contribution be?”</p>
<p>Johnson, like Truman, had been entirely focused on domestic affairs.
He too came into the Presidency wanting to complete what the New Deal
had left unfinished. He very soon realized that the Vietnam War was what
he had to concentrate on. But he could not give up what he wanted his
contribution to be. He splintered himself between the Vietnam War and
domestic reforms—and he lost both.</p>
<p>One more question has to be asked to decide “What should I
contribute?”: “Where and how can I have results that make a
difference?”</p>
<p>The answer to this question has to balance a number of things.
Results should be hard to achieve. They should require “stretching,” to
use the present buzzword. But they should be within reach. To aim at
results that cannot be achieved—or can be achieved only under the most
unlikely circumstances—is not being “ambitious.” It is being foolish. At
the same time, results should be meaningful. They should make a
difference. And they should be visible and, if at all possible,
measurable.</p>
<p>Here is one example from a nonprofit institution.</p>
<p>A newly appointed hospital administrator asked himself the question
“What should be my contribution?” The hospital was big and highly
prestigious. But it had been coasting on its reputation for thirty years
and had become mediocre. The new hospital administrator decided that his
contribution should be to establish a standard of excellence in one
important area within two years. And so he decided to concentrate on
turning around the Emergency Room and the Trauma Center—both big,
visible and sloppy. The new hospital administrator thought through what
to demand of an Emergency Room, and how to measure its performance. He
decided that every patient who came into the Emergency Room had to be
seen by a qualified nurse within sixty seconds. Within twelve months
that hospital’s Emergency Room had become a model for the entire United
States. And its turnaround also showed that there can be standards,
discipline, measurements in a hospital—and within another two years the
whole hospital had been transformed.</p>
<p>The decision “What should my contribution be?” thus balances three
elements. First comes the question: “What does the situation require?”
Then comes the question: “How could I make the greatest contribution
with my strengths, my way of performing, my values, to what needs to be
done?” Finally, there is the question: “What results have to be achieved
to make a difference?”</p>
<p>This then leads to the action conclusions: what to do, where to
start, how to start, what goals and deadlines to set.</p>
<p>Throughout history, few people had any choices. The task was imposed
on them either by nature or by a master. And so, in large measure, was
the way in which they were supposed to perform the task. But so also
were the expected results—they were given. To “do one’s own thing” is,
however, not freedom. It is license. It does not have results. It does
not contribute. But to start out with the question “What should I
contribute?” gives freedom. It gives freedom because it gives
responsibility.</p>
<p>IV Relationship Responsibility</p>
<p>Very few people work by themselves and achieve results by
themselves—a few great artists, a few great scientists, a few great
athletes. Most people work with other people and are effective through
other people. That is true whether they are members of an organization
or legally independent. To manage oneself, therefore, requires taking
relationship responsibility.</p>
<p>There are two parts to it.</p>
<p>The first one is to accept the fact that other people are as much
individuals as one is oneself. They insist on behaving like human
beings. This means that they too have their strengths. It means that
they too have their ways of getting things done. It means that they too
have their values. To be effective, one therefore has to know the
strengths, the performance modes and the values of the people one works
with.</p>
<p>This sounds obvious. But few people pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Typical are people who, in their first assignment, worked for a man
who is a reader. They therefore were trained in writing reports. Their
next boss is a listener. But these people keep on writing reports to the
new boss—the way President Johnson’s assistants kept on writing reports
to him because Jack Kennedy, who had hired them, had been a reader.
Invariably, these people have no results. Invariably, their new boss
thinks they are stupid, incompetent, lazy. They become failures. All
that would have been needed to avoid this would have been one look at
the boss and ask the question: “How does he or she perform?”</p>
<p>Bosses are not a title on the organization chart or a “function.”
They are individuals and entitled to do the work the way they do it. And
it is incumbent on the people who work with them to observe them, to
find out how they work and to adapt themselves to the way the bosses are
effective.</p>
<p>There are bosses, for instance, who have to see the figures
first—Alfred Sloan at General Motors was one of them. He himself was not
a financial person but an engineer with strong marketing instincts. But
as an engineer he had been trained to look first at figures.</p>
<p>Three of the ablest younger executives in General Motors did not make
it into the top ranks because they did not look at Sloan—they did not
realize that there was no point writing to him or talking to him until
he first had spent time with the figures. They went in and presented
their reports. Then they left the figures. But by that time they had
lost Sloan.</p>
<p>As said before, readers are unlikely ever to become listeners, and
listeners are unlikely ever to become readers. But everyone can learn to
make a decent oral presentation or to write a decent report. It is
simply the duty of the subordinate to enable the boss to do his or her
work. And that requires looking at the boss and asking “What are his or
her strengths? How does he or she do the work and perform? What are his
or her values?” In fact, this is the secret of “managing” the boss.</p>
<p>One does the same with all the people one works with. Each of them
works his or her way and not my way. And each of them is entitled to
work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform, and what
their values are. How they perform—each is likely to do it differently.
The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people with whom
one works and on whom one depends, and to make use of their strengths,
their ways of working, their values. For working relations are as much
based on the person as they are based on the work.</p>
<p>The second thing to do to manage oneself and to become effective is
to take responsibility for communications. After people have thought
through what their strengths are, how they perform, what their values
are and especially what their contribution should be, they then have to
ask: “Who needs to know this? On whom do I depend? And who depends on
me?” And then one goes and tells all these people—and tells them in the
way in which they receive a message, that is, in a memo if they are
readers, or by talking to them if they are listeners and so on.</p>
<p>Whenever I—or any other consultant—have started to work with an
organization, I am first told of all the “personality conflicts” within
it. Most of them arise from the fact that one person does not know what
the other person does, or does not know how the other person does his or
her work, or does not know what contribution the other person
concentrates on, and what results he or she expects. And the reason that
they do not know is that they do not ask and therefore are not being
told.</p>
<p>This reflects human stupidity less than it reflects human history. It
was unnecessary until very recently to tell any of these things to
anybody. Everybody in a district of the medieval city plied the same
trade—there was a street of goldsmiths, and a street of shoemakers, and
a street of armorers. (In Japan’s Kyoto there are still the streets of
the potters, the streets of the silk weavers, the streets of the lacquer
makers.) One goldsmith knew exactly what every other goldsmith was
doing; one shoemaker knew exactly what every other shoemaker was doing;
one armorer knew exactly what every other armorer was doing. There was
no need to explain anything. The same was true on the land where
everybody in a valley planted the same crop as soon as the frost was out
of the ground. There was no need to tell one’s neighbor that one was
going to plant potatoes—that, after all, was exactly what the neighbor
did too, and at the same time.</p>
<p>And those few people who did things that were not “common,” the few
professionals, for instance, worked alone, and also did not have to tell
anybody what they were doing. Today the great majority of people work
with others who do different things.</p>
<p>As said before, the marketing vice-president may have come out of
sales and knows everything about sales. But she knows nothing about
promotion and pricing and advertising and packaging and sales planning,
and so on—she has never done any of these things. Then it is incumbent
on the people who do these things to make sure that the marketing
vice-president understands what they are trying to do, why they are
trying to do it, how they are going to do it and what results to
expect.</p>
<p>If the marketing vice-president does not understand what these
high-grade knowledge specialists are doing, it is primarily their fault,
and not that of the marketing vice-president. They have not told her.
They have not educated her. Conversely, it is the marketing
vice-president’s responsibility to make sure that every one of the
people she works with understands how she looks on marketing, what her
goals are, how she works and what she expects of herself and of every
one of them.</p>
<p>Even people who understand the importance of relationship
responsibility often do not tell their associates and do not ask them.
They are afraid of being thought presumptuous, inquisitive or stupid.
They are wrong. Whenever anyone goes to his or her associates and says:
“This is what I am good at. This is how I work. These are my values.
This is the contribution I plan to concentrate on and the results I
should be expected to deliver,” the response is always: “This is most
helpful. But why haven’t you told me earlier?”</p>
<p>And one gets the same reaction—without a single exception in my
experience—if one then asks: “And what do I need to know about your
strengths, how you perform, your values and your proposed
contribution?”</p>
<p>In fact, a knowledge worker should request of people with whom he or
she works—whether as subordinates, superiors, colleagues, team
members—that they adjust their behavior to the knowledge worker’s
strengths, and to the way the knowledge worker works. Readers should
request that their associates write to them, listeners should request
that their associates first talk to them and so on. And again, whenever
that is being done, the reaction of the other person will be: “Thanks
for telling me. It’s enormously helpful. But why didn’t you ask me
earlier?”</p>
<p>Organizations are no longer built on force. They are increasingly
built on trust. Trust does not mean that people like one another. It
means that people can trust one another. And this presupposes that
people understand one another. Taking relationship responsibility is
therefore an absolute necessity. It is a duty. Whether one is a member
of the organization, a consultant to it, a supplier to it, a
distributor, one owes relationship responsibility to every one with whom
one works, on whose work one depends; and who in turn depends on one’s
own work.</p>
<p>V The Second Half of Your Life</p>
<p>As said before: For the first time in human history, individuals can
expect to outlive organizations. This creates a totally new challenge:
What to do with the second half of one’s life?</p>
<p>One can no longer expect that the organization for which one works at
age thirty will still be around when one reaches age sixty. But also,
forty or fifty years in the same kind of work is much too long for most
people. They deteriorate, get bored, lose all joy in their work, “retire
on the job” and become a burden to themselves and to everyone around
them.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily true of the very top achievers such as very
great artists. Claude Monet (1840–1926), the greatest Impressionist
painter, was still painting masterpieces in his eighties, and working
twelve hours a day, even though he had lost almost all his eyesight.
Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), perhaps the greatest Post-Impressionist
painter, similarly painted till he died in his nineties—and in his
seventies invented a new style. The greatest musical instrumentalist of
this century, the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals (1876–1973), planned to
perform a new piece of music and practiced it on the very day on which
he died at age ninety-seven. But these are the rarest of exceptions even
among very great achievers. Neither Max Planck (1858–1947) nor Albert
Einstein (1879–1955), the two giants of modern physics, did important
scientific work after their forties. Planck had two more careers. After
1918—aged sixty—he reorganized German science. After being forced into
retirement by the Nazis in 1933, he, in 1945, almost ninety, started
once more to rebuild German science after Hitler’s fall. But Einstein
retired in his forties to become a “famous man.”</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about the “mid-life crisis” of
the executive. It is mostly boredom. At age forty-five most executives
have reached the peak of their business career and know it. After twenty
years of doing very much the same kind of work, they are good at their
jobs. But few are learning anything anymore, few are contributing
anything anymore and few expect the job again to become a challenge and
a satisfaction.</p>
<p>Manual workers who have been working for forty years—in the steel
mill for instance, or in the cab of a locomotive—are physically and
mentally tired long before they reach the end of their normal life
expectancy, that is, well before they reach even traditional retirement
age. They are “finished.” If they survive—and their life expectancy too
has gone up to an average of seventy-five years or so—they are quite
happy spending ten or fifteen years doing nothing, playing golf, going
fishing, engaging in some minor hobby and so on. But knowledge workers
are not “finished.” They are perfectly capable of functioning despite
all kinds of minor complaints. And yet the original work that was so
challenging when the knowledge worker was thirty has become a deadly
bore when the knowledge worker is fifty—and still he or she is likely to
face another fifteen if not another twenty years of work.</p>
<p>To manage oneself, therefore, will increasingly require preparing
oneself for the second half of one’s life. (The best books on this
subject are by Bob Buford—a very successful businessman who himself has
created his own second half of life. They are Half Time [Grand Rapids:
Zondervan, 1994] and Game Plan [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1997].)</p>
<p>There are three answers:</p>
<p>The first is actually to start a second and different career (as Max
Planck did). Often this means only moving from one kind of an
organization to another.</p>
<p>Typical are the middle-level American business executives who in
substantial numbers move to a hospital, a university or some other
nonprofit organization, around age forty-five or forty-eight, when the
children are grown and the retirement pension is vested. In many cases
they stay in the same kind of work. The divisional controller in the big
corporation becomes, for instance, controller in a medium-sized
hospital. But there are also a growing number of people who actually
move into a different line of work. Increasingly, for instance, students
in American Protestant theological seminaries are forty-five—rather than
twenty-five—years old. They made a first career in business or
government—some in medicine—and then, when the children are grown, move
into the ministry. And so did a friend of mine who, after thirty years
as a successful art museum director and curator, entered a seminary at
age 55.</p>
<p>In the United States there is a fairly substantial number of
middle-aged women who have worked for twenty years, in business or in
local government, have risen to a junior management position and now, at
age forty-five and with the children grown, enter law school. Three or
four years later they then establish themselves as small-time lawyers in
their local communities.</p>
<p>We will see much more of such second-career people who have achieved
fair success in their first job. These people have substantial skills,
for example, the divisional controller who moves into the local
community hospital. They know how to work. They need a community—and the
house is empty with the children gone. They need the income, too. But
above all, they need the challenge.</p>
<p>The Parallel Career</p>
<p>The second answer to the question of what to do with the second half
of one’s life is to develop a parallel career.</p>
<p>A large, and rapidly growing number of people—especially people who
are very successful in their first careers—stay in the work they have
been doing for twenty or twenty-five years. Many keep on working forty
or fifty hours a week in their main and paid job. Some move from busy
full-time to being part-time employees or become consultants. But then
they create for themselves a parallel job—usually in a nonprofit
organization—and one that often takes another ten hours of work a week.
They take over the administration of their church, for instance, or the
presidency of the local Girl Scouts Council, they run the battered women
shelter, they work for the local public library as children’s librarian,
they sit on the local school board and so on.</p>
<p>And then, finally, the third answer—there are the “social
entrepreneurs.” These are usually people who have been very successful
in their first profession, as businessmen, as physicians, as
consultants, as university professors. They love their work, but it no
longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have
been doing all along, though they spend less and less of their time on
it. But they start another, and usually a nonprofit, activity.</p>
<p>Here are some examples—beginning with Bob Buford, the author of the
two books, mentioned above, about preparing for the second half of one’s
life. Having built a very successful television and radio business,
Buford still keeps on running it. But he first started and built a
successful nonprofit organization to make the Protestant churches in
America capable of survival; now he is building a second, equally
successful organization to teach other social entrepreneurs how to
manage their own private, nonprofit ventures while still running their
original businesses. But there is also the equally successful
lawyer—legal counsel to a big corporation—who has started a venture to
establish model schools in his state.</p>
<p>People who manage the “second half” may always be a minority only.
The majority may keep doing what they are doing now, that is, to retire
on the job, being bored, keeping on with their routine and counting the
years until retirement. But it will be this minority, the people who see
the long working-life expectancy as an opportunity both for themselves
and for society, who may increasingly become the leaders and the models.
They, increasingly, will be the “success stories.”</p>
<p>There is one requirement for managing the second half of one’s life:
to begin creating it long before one enters it.</p>
<p>When it first became clear thirty years ago that working-life
expectancies were lengthening very fast, many observers (including
myself) believed that retired people would increasingly become
volunteers for American nonprofit institutions. This has not happened.
If one does not begin to volunteer before one is forty or so, one will
not volunteer when past sixty.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the social entrepreneurs I know began to work in their
chosen second enterprise long before they reached their peak in their
original business. The lawyer mentioned above began to do volunteer
legal work for the schools in his state when he was around thirty-five.
He got himself elected to a school board at age forty. When he reached
fifty, and had amassed a substantial fortune, he then started his own
enterprise to build and run model schools. He is, however, still working
near-full-time as the lead counsel in the very big company that, as a
very young lawyer, he had helped found.</p>
<p>There is another reason that managing yourself will increasingly mean
that the knowledge worker develops a second major interest, and develops
it early.</p>
<p>No one can expect to live very long without experiencing a serious
setback in one’s life or in one’s work.</p>
<p>There is the competent engineer who at age forty-two is being passed
over for promotion in the company. There is the competent college
professor who at age forty-two realizes that she will stay forever in
the small college in which she got her first appointment and will never
get the professorship at the big university—even though she may be fully
qualified for it. There are tragedies in one’s personal family life—the
breakup of one’s marriage, the loss of a child.</p>
<p>And then a second major interest—and not just another hobby—may make
all the difference. The competent engineer passed over for promotion now
knows that he has not been very successful in his job. But in his
outside activity—for example, as treasurer in his local church—he has
achieved success and continues to have success. One’s own family may
break up, but in that outside activity there is still a community.</p>
<p>This will be increasingly important in a society in which success has
become important.</p>
<p>Historically there was no such thing. The overwhelming majority of
people did not expect anything but to stay in their “proper station,” as
an old English prayer has it. The only mobility there was downward
mobility. Success was practically unknown.</p>
<p>In a knowledge society we expect everyone to be a “success.” But this
is clearly an impossibility. For a great many people there is, at best,
absence of failure. For where there is success, there has to be failure.
And then it is vitally important for the individual—but equally for the
individual’s family—that there be an area in which the individual
contributes, makes a difference, and is somebody. That means having a
second area, whether a second career, a parallel career, a social
venture, a serious outside interest, all of them offering an opportunity
for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success.</p>
<p>The changes and challenges of Managing Oneself may seem obvious, if
not elementary, compared to the changes and challenges discussed in the
earlier chapters. And the answers may seem to be self-evident to the
point of appearing naïve. To be sure, many topics in the earlier
chapters—for example, Being a Change Leader or some of the Information
Challenges—are far more complex and require more advanced and more
difficult policies, technologies, methodologies. But most of the new
behavior—the new policies, technologies, methodologies—called for in
these earlier chapters can be considered EVOLUTIONS.</p>
<p>Managing Oneself is a REVOLUTION in human affairs. It requires new
and unprecedented things from the individual, and especially from the
knowledge worker. For in effect it demands that each knowledge worker
think and behave as a Chief Executive Officer. It also requires an
almost 180-degree change in the knowledge workers’ thoughts and actions
from what most of us—even of the younger generation—still take for
granted as the way to think and the way to act. Knowledge workers, after
all, first came into being in any substantial numbers a generation ago.
(I coined the term “knowledge worker,” but only thirty years ago, in my
1969 book The Age of Discontinuity.)</p>
<p>But also the shift from manual workers who do as they are being
told—either by the task or by the boss—to knowledge workers who have to
manage themselves profoundly challenges social structure. For every
existing society, even the most “individualist” one, takes two things
for granted, if only subconsciously: Organizations outlive workers, and
most people stay put. Managing Oneself is based on the very opposite
realities: Workers are likely to outlive organizations, and the
knowledge worker has mobility.</p>
<p>In the United States MOBILITY is accepted. But even in the United
States, workers outliving organizations—and with it the need to be
prepared for a Second and Different Half of One’s Life—is a revolution
for which practically no one is prepared. Nor is any existing
institution, for example, the present retirement system. In the rest of
the developed world, however, immobility is expected and accepted. It is
“stability.”</p>
<p>In Germany, for instance, mobility—until very recently—came to an end
with the individual’s reaching age ten or, at the latest, age sixteen.
If a child did not enter Gymnasium at age ten, he or she had lost any
chance ever to go to the university. And the apprenticeship that the
great majority who did not go to the Gymnasium entered at age fifteen or
sixteen as a mechanic, a bank clerk, a cook—irrevocably and
irreversibly—decided what work the person was going to do the rest of
his or her life. Moving from the occupation of one’s apprenticeship into
another occupation was simply not done even when not actually
forbidden.</p>
<p>The developed society that faces the greatest challenge and will have
to make the most difficult changes is the society that has been most
successful in the last fifty years: Japan. Japan’s success—and there is
no precedent for it in history—very largely rested on organized
immobility—the immobility of “lifetime employment.” In lifetime
employment it is the organization that manages the individual. And it
does so, of course, on the assumption that the individual has no choice.
The individual is being managed.</p>
<p>I very much hope that Japan will find a solution that preserves the
social stability, the community—and the social harmony—that lifetime
employment provided, and yet creates the mobility that knowledge work
and knowledge workers must have. Far more is at stake than Japan’s own
society and civic harmony. A Japanese solution would provide a model—for
in every country a functioning society does require cohesion. Still, a
successful Japan will be a very different Japan.</p>
<p>But so will be every other developed country. The emergence of the
knowledge worker who both can and must manage himself or herself is
transforming every society.</p>
<p>This book has intentionally confined itself to MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES.
Even in this last chapter, it has talked about the individual, that is,
the knowledge worker. But the changes discussed in this book go way
beyond management. They go way beyond the individual and his or her
career. What this book actually dealt with is:</p>
