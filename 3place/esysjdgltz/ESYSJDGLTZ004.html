<p>One Cannot Manage Change •Change Policies •Organized Improvement
•Exploiting Success •Creating Change •Windows of Opportunity •What Not
to Do •Piloting •The Change Leader’s Two Budgets •Change and
Continuity</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>One Cannot Manage Change</p>
<p>One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it.</p>
<p>We do not hear much anymore about “overcoming resistance to change,”
which ten or fifteen years ago was one of the most popular topics of
management books and management seminars. Everybody has accepted by now
that “change is unavoidable.” But this still implies that change is like
“death and taxes”: It should be postponed as long as possible, and no
change would be vastly preferable.</p>
<p>But in a period of upheavals, such as the one we are living in,
change is the norm. To be sure, it is painful and risky, and above all
it requires a great deal of very hard work. But unless it is seen as the
task of the organization to lead change, the organization—whether
business, university, hospital and so on—will not survive. In a period
of rapid structural change, the only ones who survive are the Change
Leaders.</p>
<p>It is therefore a central 21st-century challenge for management that
its organization become a change leader. A change leader sees change as
opportunity. A change leader looks for change, knows how to find the
right changes and knows how to make them effective both outside the
organization and inside it. This requires:</p>
<p>1 Policies to make the future.</p>
<p>2 Systematic methods to look for and to anticipate change.</p>
<p>3 The right way to introduce change, both within and outside the
organization.</p>
<p>4 Policies to balance change and continuity.</p>
<p>It is with these four requirements for being a change leader that
this chapter concerns itself.</p>
<p>I Change Policies</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about “the innovative
organization.” But making an organization more receptive to
innovation—even organizing it for innovation—is not nearly enough to be
a change leader. It might even be a distraction. For to be a change
leader requires the willingness and ability to change what is already
being done just as much as to do new and different things. It requires
policies to make the present create the future.</p>
<p>The first policy—and the foundation for all the others—is to abandon
yesterday. The first need is to free resources from being committed to
maintaining what no longer contributes to performance, and no longer
produces results. In fact, it is not possible to create tomorrow unless
one first sloughs off yesterday. To maintain yesterday is always
difficult and extremely time-consuming. To maintain yesterday therefore
always commits the institution’s scarcest and most valuable
resources—and above all, its ablest people—to nonresults. Yet to do
anything different—let alone to innovate—always runs into unexpected
difficulties. It therefore always demands leadership by people of high
and proven ability. And if these people are committed to maintaining
yesterday, they are simply not available to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>The first change policy, therefore, throughout the entire
institution, has to be Organized Abandonment.</p>
<p>The change leader puts every product, every service, every process,
every market, every distribution channel, every customer and end-use, on
trial for its life. And it does so on a regular schedule. The question
has to be asked—and asked seriously—“If we did not do this already,
would we, knowing what we now know, go into it?” If the answer is “no,”
the reaction must not be “Let’s make another study.” The reaction must
be “What do we do now?” The enterprise is committed to change. It is
committed to action.</p>
<p>In three cases the right action is always outright abandonment.</p>
<p>Abandonment is the right action if a product, service, market or
process “still has a few good years of life.” It is these dying
products, services or processes that always demand the greatest care and
the greatest efforts. They tie down the most productive and ablest
people. But also we almost always over-estimate how much “life” there is
still in the old product, service, market or process. Usually they are
not “dying”; they are dead. And as an old medical proverb has it, “There
is nothing as difficult and as expensive, but also nothing as futile, as
to try to keep a corpse from stinking.”</p>
<p>But equally a product, service, market or process should be abandoned
if the only argument for keeping it is: “It’s fully written off.” To
treat assets as being fully written off has its place in tax accounting,
but nowhere else. For management purposes there are no “cost-less
assets.” There are only “sunk costs,” the economist’s term for buildings
and other fixed investments. The question is never: “What have they
cost?” The question is: “What will they produce?” And assets that no
longer produce except in accounting terms, that is, assets which produce
only because they appear not to “cost” anything, are not assets. There
are only sunk costs.</p>
<p>The third case where abandonment is the right policy—and the most
important one—is the old and declining product, service, market or
process for the sake of maintaining which, the new and growing product,
service or process is being stunted or neglected.</p>
<p>One recent example of what not to do is how the future was sacrificed
in the nineties, on the altar of yesterday, by America’s largest
automobile manufacturer, General Motors, and America’s largest union of
factory workers, the United Automobile Workers Union (UAW).</p>
<p>Everybody in the United States knows that the Japanese automobile
makers acquired 30 percent of the U.S. passenger-car market in ten short
years from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties. But few realize that
none of this gain was at the expense of America’s two smaller
manufacturers, Ford and Chrysler—on the contrary, both actually gained
market share. One-third of the Japanese gain was at the expense of
Germany’s Volkswagen, which had a market share of 10 percent in the
seventies but had lost practically all of it ten years later to the
Japanese. Two-thirds of the Japanese gain—a hefty 20 percent of the
American market—was, however, General Motors’ loss; its market share
slumped from 50 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p>For fifteen years General Motors did nothing except fiddle with
prices and discounts—none to any effect. Then, finally, in the late
1980s it decided to counterattack—with a new car called the “Saturn.”
The Saturn is little but a slightly more costly imitation of the
Japanese—in its styling, its manufacturing and marketing, its service
and its labor relations. And GM badly bungled its market introduction.
Still it was a smash hit since a great many people in the United States
were hungry for an American-made car of the new kind.</p>
<p>But, as almost everyone outside GM immediately realized, the Saturn
did not compete with the Japanese makes. All its sales came at the
expense of declining—if not dying—GM brands such as Oldsmobile and
Buick. And then GM—and even more so GM’s labor union, the United
Automobile Workers—began to throttle the Saturn. It was denied money for
expansion—that money went instead into futile attempts to “modernize”
Oldsmobile and Buick plants. It was denied money to develop new
models—again that money went into Oldsmobile and Buick redesigns. And
the UAW began to whittle away at the Saturn’s new and successful labor
relations for fear that Saturn’s example in building management-labor
partnerships might spread to GM’s other plants.</p>
<p>Neither Oldsmobile nor Buick has benefited. Both are still going
downhill. But the Saturn has been all but destroyed. And both GM and the
UAW have continued their decline.</p>
<p>Abandonment may take different forms.</p>
<p>In the GM cases, for instance, one possible solution might have been
to do simultaneously two things: (1) kill the dying Oldsmobile and (2)
run with Saturn’s success as hard as possible, give it all the money and
people it needed but set it up as a separate company free to compete
aggressively with all of GM’s old products and for all of GM’s old
customers.</p>
<p>The right answer may even be to do more of the same but to do it
differently.</p>
<p>One example: Every book publisher knows that the bulk of its sales
(some 60 percent)—and practically all of its profits—come from the
“backlist,” that is, from titles that have been out more than a year or
two. But no book publisher puts resources into selling the backlist. All
the efforts are put into selling the new titles. A major publishing firm
had tried for years to get its salespeople to sell the backlist without
any success; and it also did not itself spend a penny on promoting it.
Then one outside director asked: “Would we handle the backlist the way
we do if we went into it now?” And when the answer was a unanimous “no,”
she asked: “What do we do now?” As a result the firm reorganized itself
into two separate units: one buying, editing, promoting and selling the
new titles published in the current year; one promoting and selling the
backlist. Within two years backlist sales had almost tripled—and the
firm’s profits doubled.</p>
<p>How to act on abandonment is thus the second question. It is as
important as the first one. It is actually more controversial and more
difficult. The answer should therefore always be tested on a small scale
or piloted (see a later section of this chapter).</p>
<p>In a period of rapid change the “How?” is likely to become obsolete
faster than the “What?” The change leader must therefore also ask of
every product, service, market or process: “If we were to go into this
now, knowing what we now know, would we go into it the way we are doing
it now?” And this question needs to be asked of the successful product,
service, market and process as regularly—and as seriously—as of the
unsuccessful product, service, market or process.</p>
<p>This applies to all areas of the enterprise. But it applies with
particular force to an area that many enterprises tend to neglect, if
not to ignore: distributors and distribution channels. In a time of
rapid change distributors and distribution channels tend to change
faster than anything else. And it is also on distributors and
distribution channels that the “Information Revolution” is likely to
have the greatest impact.</p>
<p>The terms “distributors” and “distribution channels” are of course
business terms. But every institution has “distributors.” And they are
every institution’s first “customers.”</p>
<p>Here is a nonbusiness example:</p>
<p>The high school placement counselor has been the “distribution
channel” through whom American universities and colleges have
traditionally reached prospective applicants for admission. But
increasingly potential students and their parents look for information
to ratings of colleges and universities published in a number of
magazines, to books describing and rating different colleges and so on.
Several major American universities have substantially increased the
quantity and the quality of their applicants by focusing their
promotional efforts on these new distribution channels—without
necessarily cutting back on “selling” to the high school placement
counselor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the health maintenance organization (HMO) has increasingly
become the “distribution channel” for hospitals, where, only ten years
ago, the hospital distribution channel was the physician. Increasingly,
hospitals are therefore working with HMOs to reach both physician and
patient.</p>
<p>So far, we can only speculate on the impact the Internet will have on
distribution. But it will have impact. One example of what is already
happening, and happening fast, is the American automobile market.</p>
<p>It has been known for a long time that the wife makes the decision
about what cars not to buy. She, in effect, therefore makes the buying
decisions. But the wife, as has also been known for a long time, does
not like to shop at the automobile dealer. Hence, it is the husband who
appears as the buyer when the couple visits the dealer—even though the
actual decision has already been made, and made by the wife. The
Internet enables the woman to do the actual buying—the dealer is rapidly
becoming no more than an “outlet.”</p>
<p>Hence the automobile industry faces the task of making the Internet
its distribution channel—General Motors is known already to work on
this. But does that mean abandoning the traditional automobile
dealer?</p>
<p>“To Abandon What” and “To Abandon How” have to be practiced
systematically. Otherwise they will always be “postponed,” for they are
never “popular” policies.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how successful abandonment policies can be
organized.</p>
<p>In one fairly big company offering outsourcing services in most
developed countries, the first Monday morning of every month is set
aside for an abandonment meeting at every management level from top
management to the supervisors in each area. Each of these sessions
examines one part of the business—one of the services one Monday, one of
the regions in which the company does business a month later, the way
this or that service is organized the Monday morning of the third month
and so on. Within the year, the company this way examines itself
completely, including its personnel policies, for instance. In the
course of a year three to four major decisions are likely to be made on
the “what” of the company’s services and perhaps twice as many decisions
to change the “how.” But also each year three to five ideas for new
things to do come out of these sessions. These decisions to change
anything—whether to abandon something, whether to abandon the way
something is being done or whether to do something new—are reported each
month to all members of management. And twice a year all management
levels report on what has actually happened as a result of their
sessions, what action has been taken and with what results.</p>
<p>Since this company first began organized abandonment eight or nine
years ago, it has grown more than four-fold (adjusted for inflation). It
attributes at least half of this growth to its systematic abandonment
policies.</p>
<p>Organized Improvement</p>
<p>The next policy for the change leader is organized improvement (what
the Japanese call “Kaizen”).</p>
<p>Whatever an enterprise does internally and externally needs to be
improved systematically and continuously: product and service,
production processes, marketing, service, technology, training and
development of people, using information. And it needs to be improved at
a preset annual rate: In most areas, as the Japanese have shown, an
annual improvement rate of 3 percent is realistic and achievable.</p>
<p>However, continuing improvement requires a major decision. What
constitutes “performance” in a given area? If performance is to be
improved—and that is, of course, what continuous improvement aims at—we
need to define clearly what “performance” means.</p>
<p>One example: complex and difficult products in which the rejection
rate is high. To improve a rejection rate of 40 percent of a finished
product to one of 35 percent is quite obviously a substantial
improvement. But in most other areas the decision is by no means that
simple. What is “quality” in a product? To what extent is it defined by
the producer? To what extent can it only be defined by the customer?
Even more difficult very often is the definition of performance in
services.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>A major commercial bank decided that the way to improve performance
in its branches was to offer new and more advanced financial “products,”
for example, selling Treasury bonds or giving advice on handling debt.
It spent a great deal of time and money researching what kinds of
financial products customers might want, developing these products and
training its branch personnel to deliver them. But when the bank
introduced the new products in its branches, it rapidly lost customers.
Only then did the bank find out that to customers, performance of a bank
branch means not having to wait in line for routine transactions. The
additional “products” were valuable, the customers thought, but they
only needed them once in a while.</p>
<p>The bank’s solution was to concentrate the tellers at the branches on
the simple, repetitive, routine services, which require neither skill
nor time. The new financial products were assigned to different groups
of people who were moved to separate tables, with big signs advertising
the products in which each table specialized. As soon as this was done,
business went up sharply, both for the traditional and the new services.
But because there had been no “pilot”—trying out the improvements in one
or two branches would have sufficed—the bank lost almost two years and a
great deal of money.</p>
<p>Continuous improvements in any area eventually transform the
operation. They lead to product innovation. They lead to service
innovation. They lead to new processes. They lead to new businesses.
Eventually continuous improvements lead to fundamental change.</p>
<p>Exploiting Success</p>
<p>The next policy chat the change leader needs to develop is the
exploitation of success.</p>
<p>It is only seventy or eighty years since the “monthly report” was
invented and introduced in most business organizations. By now it is
routine and standard practically everywhere. Almost without exception
this report, on its first page, presents the areas in which results fall
below expectations, or in which expenditures exceed budget. It focuses
on problems. In the monthly operating committee meeting, which also has
become routine and standard in practically all enterprises—and by no
means only in businesses—it is this report on the problems that is being
discussed, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Problems cannot be ignored. And serious problems have to be taken
care of. But to be change leaders, enterprises have to focus on
opportunities. They have to starve problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>This requires a small but fundamental procedural change: an
additional “first page” to the monthly report, and one that should
precede the page that shows the problems. It requires a page that
focuses on where results are better than expected, whether in terms of
sales, revenues, profits or volume. As much time then should be spent on
this new first page as has traditionally been spent on the problem page.
In some organizations that have successfully organized themselves to be
change leaders, the opportunity page is given its own full morning or
its own full day, with a second full morning or full day then devoted to
the problems.</p>
<p>Enterprises that succeed in being change leaders make sure that they
staff the opportunities.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to list the opportunities on one page, and then
to list the organization’s performing and capable people on another
page. Then one allocates the ablest and most performing people to the
top opportunities.</p>
<p>This implies that the first—and usually the best—opportunity for
successful change is to exploit one’s own successes and to build on
them.</p>
<p>The best example, perhaps, is the Japanese company Sony. It has built
itself into one of the world’s leaders in a number of major businesses
by systematically exploiting one success after the other—big or
small.</p>
<p>All of Sony’s consumer electronics—the business in which it is the
world leader and best known—are based on a product that was not even
invented by Sony: the tape recorder. One success of a Sony product based
on the tape recorder is used to design the next product and then another
product based on the success of that product and so on. No step was a
big one. And not all of them were successful. But by exploiting success,
each of these additional new products carried very little risk—so that
even when it did not succeed there was not too much damage. And enough
of them were successful to make Sony into one of the world’s largest,
but also one of the world’s most consistently successful,
enterprises.</p>
<p>Another example is the medical electronics group of the American
General Electric Company. In a highly competitive field it has emerged
as the largest and most successful manufacturer, but also as a change
leader. It has done so apparently by exploiting its successes, and by
building on each success another product—often with only a fairly minor
change, but one that presents a significant improvement for physician or
hospital.</p>
<p>As in a continuous improvement, exploitation will, sooner or later,
lead to genuine innovation. There comes a point when the small steps of
exploitation result in a major, fundamental change, that is, in
something that is genuinely new and different.</p>
<p>II Creating Change</p>
<p>The last policy for the change leader to build into the enterprise is
a systematic policy of INNOVATION, that is, a policy to create
change.</p>
<p>It is the area to which most attention is being given today. It may,
however, not be the most important one—organized abandonment,
improvement, exploiting success may be more productive for a good many
enterprises. And without these policies—abandonment, improvement,
exploitation—no organization can hope to be a successful innovator.</p>
<p>But to be a successful change leader an enterprise has to have a
policy of systematic innovation. And the main reason may not even be
that change leaders need to innovate—though they do. The main reason is
that a policy of systematic innovation produces the mindset for an
organization to be a change leader. It makes the entire organization see
change as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Windows of Opportunity</p>
<p>This requires a systematic policy to look, every six to twelve
months, for changes that might be opportunities—in the areas that I call
“the windows of opportunity”:</p>
<p>• The organization’s own unexpected successes and unexpected
failures, but also the unexpected successes and unexpected failures of
the organization’s competitors.</p>
<p>• Incongruities, especially incongruities in the process, whether of
production or distribution, or incongruities in customer behavior.</p>
<p>• Process needs.</p>
<p>• Changes in industry and market structures.</p>
<p>• Changes in demographics.</p>
<p>• Changes in meaning and perception.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>• New knowledge.*</p>
<p>A change in any one of these areas raises the question: “Is this an
opportunity for us to innovate, that is, to develop different products,
services, processes? Does it indicate new and different markets and/or
customers? New and different technologies? New and different
distribution channels?” Innovation can never be risk-free. But if
innovation is based on exploiting what has already happened—in the
enterprise itself, in its markets, in knowledge, in society, in
demographics and so on—it is far less risky than not to innovate by
exploiting these opportunities.</p>
<p>Innovation is not “flash of genius.” It is hard work. And this work
should be organized as a regular part of every unit within the
enterprise, and of every level of management.</p>
<p>What Not to Do</p>
<p>There are Three Traps to avoid into which change leaders fall again
and again.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first trap is an innovation opportunity that is not in tune with
the strategic realities discussed in Chapter Two of this book.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is most unlikely to work. The only innovation likely to succeed is
one that fits these major realities—of demographics, of the changes in
the distribution of income, of the way the institution itself and its
customers define “performance,” of global competitiveness or of
political and economic realities. But the “misfit” opportunity often
looks very tempting—precisely because it looks truly “innovative.” But
even if not resulting in failure—as it usually does—it always requires
extraordinarily wasteful amounts of effort, money and time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The second trap is to confuse “novelty” with “innovation.” The
test of an innovation is that it creates value. A novelty only creates
amusement. Yet, again and again, managements decide to innovate for no
other reason than that they are bored doing the same thing or making the
same product day in and day out. The test of an innovation—as is also
the test of “quality”—is not: “Do we like it?” It is: “Do customers want
it and will they pay for it?”</p></li>
<li><p>And the third trap: confusing motion with action. Typically when
a product, service or process no longer produces results and should be
abandoned or changed radically, management “reorganizes.” To be sure,
reorganization is often needed. But it comes after the action, that is,
after the “what” and the “how” have been faced up to. By itself
reorganization is just “motion” and no substitute for action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three traps are so attractive that every change leader can
expect to fall into one of them—or into all three—again and again. There
is only one way to avoid them, or to extricate oneself if one has
stumbled into them: to organize the Introduction of Change, that is, to
PILOT.</p>
<p>III Piloting</p>
<p>Enterprises of all kinds increasingly use all kinds of market
research and customer research to limit, if not eliminate, the risks of
change. But one cannot market research the truly new. But also nothing
new is right the first time. Invariably, problems crop up that nobody
even thought of. Invariably, problems that loom very large to the
originator turn out to be trivial or not to exist at all. Above all, the
way to do the job invariably turns out to be different from what is
originally designed. It is almost a “law of nature” that anything that
is truly new, whether product or service or technology, finds its major
market and its major application not where the innovator and
entrepreneur expected, and not for the use for which the innovator or
entrepreneur has designed the product, service or technology. And that,
no market or customer research can possibly discover.</p>
<p>The best example is an early one.</p>
<p>The improved steam engine that James Watt (1736–1819) designed and
patented in 1776 is the event which, for most people, signifies the
advent of the Industrial Revolution. Actually, Watt until his death saw
only one use for the steam engine: to pump water out of coal mines. That
was the use for which he had designed it. And he sold it only to coal
mines. It was his partner Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) who is the real
father of the Industrial Revolution. Boulton saw that the improved steam
engine could be used in what was then England’s premier industry,
textiles, and especially in the spinning and weaving of cotton. Within
ten or fifteen years after Boulton had sold his first steam engine to a
cotton mill, the price of cotton textiles had fallen by 70 percent. And
this created both the first mass market and the first factory—and
together modern capitalism and the modern economy altogether.</p>
<p>Neither studies nor market research nor computer modeling are a
substitute for the test of reality. Everything improved or new needs
therefore first to be tested on a small scale, that is, it needs to be
PILOTED.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to find somebody within the enterprise who
really wants the new. As said before, everything new gets into trouble.
And then it needs a champion. It needs somebody who says: “I am going to
make this succeed,” and who then goes to work on it. And this person
needs to be somebody whom the organization respects. This need not even
be somebody within the organization. A good way to pilot a new product
or new service is often to find a customer who really wants the new, and
who is willing to work with the producer on making truly successful the
new product or the new service.</p>
<p>If the pilot test is successful—if it finds the problems nobody
anticipated but also finds the opportunities that nobody anticipated,
whether in terms of design, of market, of service—the risk of change is
usually quite small. And it is usually also quite clear where to
introduce the change, and how to introduce it, that is, what
entrepreneurial strategy to employ.</p>
<p>The Change Leader’s Two Budgets</p>
<p>Finally, successful change leadership requires appropriate accounting
and budget policies. It requires TWO separate budgets.</p>
<p>In most enterprises—and again not just in businesses—there is only
one budget, and it is adjusted to the business cycle. In good times
expenditures are increased across the board. In bad times expenditures
are cut across the board. This, however, practically guarantees missing
out on the future.</p>
<p>The change leader’s first budget is an operating budget that shows
the expenditures to maintain the present business. This is normally 80
to 90 percent or so of all expenditures.</p>
<p>That budget should always be approached with the question: “What is
the minimum we need to spend to keep operations going?” And in poor
times it should, indeed, be adjusted downward (though in good times most
of it, probably, should not be adjusted upward, and certainly no more
than volume and/or revenues increase).</p>
<p>And then the change leader has a second, separate budget for the
future. This budget remains stable throughout good times and bad times.
It rarely amounts to more than 10 or 12 percent of an enterprise’s total
expenditures—and again this applies to nonbusinesses as well as to
businesses.</p>
<p>Very few of the expenditures for the future produce results unless
maintained at a stable level over substantial periods. This goes for
work on new products, new services and new technologies; for the
development of markets and customers and distribution channels, and
above all, for the development of people.</p>
<p>The future budget should be approached with the question: “What is
the maximum this activity can absorb to produce optimal results?” That
amount should be maintained in good times or bad—unless times are so
catastrophic that maintaining expenditures threatens the survival of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>But the future budget also should include expenditures to exploit
success. The most common, but also the most damaging, practice is to cut
back on expenditures for successes, especially in poor times, so as to
maintain expenditures for ongoing operations, and especially
expenditures to maintain the past. The argument is always: “This
product, service or technology is a success anyhow; it doesn’t need to
have more money put into it.” But the right argument is: “This is a
success, and therefore should be supported to the maximum possible.” And
it should be supported especially in bad times when the competition is
likely to cut spending and therefore likely to create an opening.</p>
<p>We tend to manage according to the reports we receive and see. This
explains why it is important for the change leader to have reports
focusing on the areas in which the enterprise does better than expected,
the areas of unexpected success, and therefore the areas of potential
opportunity. It also explains why it is crucially important for the
change leader to have a budget that embodies the commitment to making
the future and to be ahead of change.</p>
<p>IV Change and Continuity</p>
<p>The traditional institution is designed for continuity. All existing
institutions, whether businesses, universities, hospitals or churches,
therefore have to make special efforts to be receptive to change and to
be able to change. It also explains why existing institutions face
resistance to change. Change for the traditional institution is, so to
speak, a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Change leaders are, however, designed for change. And yet they still
require continuity. People need to know where they stand. They need to
know the people with whom they work. They need to know what they can
expect. They need to know the values and the rules of the organization.
They do not function if the environment is not predictable, not
understandable, not known. But continuity is equally needed outside the
enterprise. In fact, we are learning increasingly the importance of
long-term relationships. To be able to change rapidly, one needs close
and continuous relationships with suppliers and distributors. But the
enterprise also has to have a “personality” that identifies it among its
customers and in its markets—and again this is true as much of
nonbusinesses as of businesses.</p>
<p>Change and continuity are thus poles rather than opposites. The more
an institution is organized to be a change leader, the more it will need
to establish continuity internally and externally, the more it will need
to balance rapid change and continuity.</p>
<p>This balance will predictably be one of the major concerns of
tomorrow’s management—both of the practitioners and of the scholars and
writers on management. But we do know already a good deal about how to
create it. Some institutions already are change leaders and have tackled
the problem—though not always solved it.</p>
<p>One way is to make partnership in change the basis of continuing
relationships. This is what the Japanese “Keiretsu” has done with
respect to the relationship between supplier and manufacturer, and what
is now adopted fast in American business through “Economic-Chain
Accounting” (discussed in the next chapter of this book). We are
developing similar partnerships in change as the basis of continuing
relationships between manufacturer and distributor, for example, between
Procter andandandand Gamble, the world’s largest producer of household
needs, and large retailers such as Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>But relationships within the enterprise (as discussed earlier in
Chapter One) are also increasingly going to be partnerships—with
employees of the organization, with people who work for an outsourcing
firm but who are actually members of the enterprise’s own working teams,
or with outside, independent contractors. And again, these relations
need increasingly to be organized as long-term partnerships in the
process of change.</p>
<p>Balancing change and continuity requires continuous work on
information. Nothing disrupts continuity and corrupts relationships more
than poor or unreliable information (except, perhaps, deliberate
misinformation). It has to become routine for any enterprise to ask at
any change, even the most minor one: “Who needs to be informed of this?”
And this will become more and more important as people no longer
necessarily work next door to one another and see one another half a
dozen times a day. The more enterprises come to rely on people working
together without actually working together—that is, on people using the
new technologies of information—the more important it will become to
make sure that they are fully informed.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will also become more and more important for
these people to get together and actually meet one another and work with
one another on an organized, systematic, scheduled basis. Long-distance
information does not replace face-to-face relationships. It makes them
actually more important. It makes it more important for people to know
what to expect of one another. It makes it more important for people to
know how the other person actually behaves. It makes it more important
to have trust in one another. And this means both systematic
information—and especially information about any change—and organized
face-to-face relationships, that is, opportunities to get to know one
another and to understand one another.</p>
<p>Information is particularly important when the change is not a mere
improvement, but something truly new. It has to be a firm rule in any
enterprise that wants to be successful as a change leader, that there
are no surprises. Above all, there is need for continuity in respect to
the fundamentals of the enterprise: its mission, its values, its
definition of performance and results. Precisely because change is a
constant in the change leader’s enterprise, the foundations have to be
extra strong.</p>
<p>Finally, the balance between change and continuity has to be built
into compensation, recognition and rewards. We long ago learned that an
organization will not innovate unless innovators are properly rewarded.
We long ago learned that a business in which successful innovators do
not make it into senior management, let alone into top management, will
not innovate. We will have to learn, similarly, that an organization
will have to reward continuity—by considering, for instance, people who
deliver continuing improvement to be as valuable to the organization,
and as deserving of recognition and reward, as the genuine
innovator.</p>
<p>V Making the Future</p>
<p>One thing is certain for developed countries—and probably for the
entire world: We face long years of profound changes. The changes are
not primarily economic changes. They are not even primarily
technological changes. They are changes in demo-graphics, in politics,
in society, in philosophy and, above all, in world-view. Economic theory
and economic policy are unlikely to be effective by themselves in such a
period. And there is no social theory for such a period either. Only
when such a period is over, decades later, are theories likely to be
developed to explain what has happened. But a few things are certain in
such a period. It is futile, for instance, to try to ignore the changes
and to pretend that tomorrow will be like yesterday, only more so. This,
however, is the position that existing institutions tend to adopt in
such a period—businesses as well as nonbusinesses. It is, above all, the
policy likely to be adopted by the institutions that were most
successful in the earlier period before the changes. They are most
likely to suffer from the delusion that tomorrow will be like yesterday,
only more so. Thus it can be confidently predicted that a large number
of today’s leaders in all areas, whether business, education or health
care, are unlikely still to be around thirty years hence, and certainly
not in their present form. But to try to anticipate the changes is
equally unlikely to be successful. These changes are not
predictable.</p>
<p>The only policy likely to succeed is to try to make the future.
Changes of course have to fit the Certainties (which this book attempted
to outline in the preceding chapter). Within these restraints, however,
the future is still malleable. It can still be created.</p>
<p>To try to make the future is highly risky. It is less risky, however,
than not to try to make it. A goodly proportion of those attempting to
do what this chapter discusses will surely not succeed. But,
predictably, no one else will.</p>
