Paradigms</h4>
<p>Why Assumptions Matter •Management Is Business Management •The One
Right Organization •The One Right Way to Manage People •Technologies and
End-Users Are Fixed and Given •Management’s Scope Is Legally Defined
•Management’s Scope Is Politically Defined •The Inside Is Management’s
Domain</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Why Assumptions Matter</p>
<p>BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT REALITY are the PARADIGMS of a social
science, such as management. They are usually held subconsciously by the
scholars, the writers, the teachers, the practitioners in the field. Yet
those assumptions largely determine what the discipline—scholars,
writers, teachers, practitioners—assumes to be REALITY.</p>
<p>The discipline’s basic assumptions about reality determine what it
focuses on. They determine what a discipline considers “facts,” and
indeed what it considers the discipline itself to be all about. The
assumptions also largely determine what is being disregarded in a
discipline or is being pushed aside as an “annoying exception.” They
decide both what in a given discipline is being paid attention to and
what is neglected or ignored.</p>
<p>A good example is what happened to the most insightful of the earlier
management scholars: Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933).* Because her
assumptions did not fit the realities which the budding discipline of
management assumed in the 1930s and 1940s, she became a “nonperson” even
before her death in 1932, with her work practically forgotten for
twenty-five years or more. And yet we now know that her basic
assumptions regarding society, people and management were far closer to
reality than those on which the management people then based
themselves—and still largely base themselves today.</p>
<p>Yet, despite their importance, the assumptions are rarely analyzed,
rarely studied, rarely challenged—indeed rarely even made explicit.</p>
<p>For a social discipline such as management the assumptions are
actually a good deal more important than are the paradigms for a natural
science. The paradigm—that is, the prevailing general theory—has no
impact on the natural universe. Whether the paradigm states that the sun
rotates around the earth or that, on the contrary, the earth rotates
around the sun has no effect on sun and earth. A natural science deals
with the behavior of OBJECTS. But a social discipline such as management
deals with the behavior of PEOPLE and HUMAN INSTITUTIONS. Practitioners
will therefore tend to act and to behave as the discipline’s assumptions
tell them to. Even more important, the reality of a natural science, the
physical universe and its laws, do not change (or if they do only over
eons rather than over centuries, let alone over decades). The social
universe has no “natural laws” of this kind. It is thus subject to
continuous change. And this means that assumptions that were valid
yesterday can become invalid and, indeed, totally misleading in no time
at all.</p>
<p>Everyone these days preaches the team as the “right” organization for
every task. (I myself began to preach teams as early as 1954 and
especially in my 1973 book Management: Tasks, Responsibilities,
Practices.) Underlying the present orthodoxy regarding teams is a basic
assumption held practically by all management theorists and by most
practitioners since the earliest days of thinking about organization,
that is, since Henri Fayol in France and Walter Rathenau in Germany
around 1900: There is—or, at least, there MUST be—ONE right
organization. And what matters most is not whether the team is indeed
“the answer” (so far there is not too much evidence for it), but, as
will be discussed a little later, that the basic assumption of the one
right organization is no longer tenable.</p>
<p>What matters most in a social discipline such as management are
therefore the basic assumptions. And a CHANGE in the basic assumptions
matters even more.</p>
<p>Since the study of management first began—and it truly did not emerge
until the 1930s—TWO SETS of assumptions regarding the REALITIES of
management have been held by most scholars, most writers and most
practitioners:</p>
<p>One set of assumptions underlies the DISCIPLINE of management:</p>
<p>1 Management is Business Management.</p>
<p>2 There is—or there must be—ONE right organization structure.</p>
<p>3 There is—or there must be—ONE right way to manage people.</p>
<p>Another set of assumptions underlies the PRACTICE of Management:</p>
<p>1 Technologies, markets and end-uses are given.</p>
<p>2 Management’s scope is legally defined.</p>
<p>3 Management is internally focused.</p>
<p>4 The economy as defined by national boundaries is the “ecology” of
enterprise and management.</p>
<p>For most of this period—at least until the early 1980s—all but the
first of these assumptions were close enough to reality to be
operational, whether for research, for writing, for teaching or for
practicing management. By now all of them have out-lived their
usefulness. They are close to being caricatures. They are now so far
removed from actual reality that they are becoming obstacles to the
Theory and even more serious obstacles to the Practice of management.
Indeed, reality is fast becoming the very opposite of what these
assumptions claim it to be. It is high time therefore to think through
these assumptions and to try to formulate the NEW ASSUMPTIONS that now
have to inform both the study and the practice of management.</p>
<p>I Management Is Business Management</p>
<p>For most people, inside and outside management, this assumption is
taken as self-evident. Indeed management writers, management
practitioners and the laity do not even hear the word “management”; they
automatically hear BUSINESS MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>This assumption regarding the universe of management is of fairly
recent origin. Before the 1930s the few writers and thinkers, who
concerned themselves with management—beginning with Frederick Winslow
Taylor around the turn of the century and ending with Chester Barnard
just before World War II—all assumed that business management is just a
subspecies of general management and basically no more different from
the management of any other organization than one breed of dogs is from
another breed of dogs.</p>
<p>The first practical application of management theory did not take
place in a business but in nonprofits and government agencies. Frederick
Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), the inventor of “Scientific Management,” in
all probability also coined the terms “Management” and “Consultant” in
their present meaning. On his calling card he identified himself as
“Consultant to Management”—and he explained that he had intentionally
chosen these new and strange terms to shock potential clients into
awareness of his offering something totally new. But Taylor did not cite
a business but the nonprofit Mayo Clinic as the “perfect example” of
“Scientific Management” in his 1912 testimony before the Congress which
first made the United States management-conscious. And the most
publicized application of Taylor’s “Scientific Management” (though
aborted by union pressure) was not in a business but in the
government-owned and government-run Watertown Arsenal of the U.S.
Army.</p>
<p>The first job to which the term “Manager” in its present meaning was
applied was not in business. It was the City Manager—an American
invention of the early years of the century. The first conscious and
systematic application of “management principles” similarly was not in a
business. It was the reorganization of the U.S. Army in 1901 by Elihu
Root (1845–1937), Theodore Roosevelt’s Secretary of War.</p>
<p>The first Management Congress—Prague in 1922—was not organized by
business people but by Herbert Hoover, then U.S. Secretary of Commerce,
and Thomas Masaryk, a world-famous historian and the founding President
of the new Czechoslovak Republic. And Mary Parker Follett, whose work on
Management began at roughly the same time, never differentiated between
business management and nonbusiness management. She talked of the
management of organizations, to all of which the same principles
applied.</p>
<p>What led to the identification of Management with Business Management
was the Great Depression with its hostility to business and its contempt
for business executives. In order not to be tarred with the business
brush, management in the public sector was rechristened “Public
Administration” and proclaimed a separate discipline—with its own
university departments, its own terminology, its own career ladder. At
the same time—and for the same reason—what had begun as a study of
management in the rapidly growing hospital (e.g., by Raymond Sloan, the
younger brother of GM’s Alfred Sloan) was split off as a separate
discipline and christened “Hospital Administration.”</p>
<p>Not to be called “management” was, in other words, “political
correctness” in the Depression years.</p>
<p>In the postwar period, however, the fashion turned. By 1950 BUSINESS
had become a “good word”—largely the result of the performance during
World War II of American business management. And then very soon
“business management” became “politically correct” as a field of study,
above all. And ever since, management has remained identified in the
public mind as well as in academia with “business management.”</p>
<p>Now, however, we are beginning to unmake this sixty-year-old
mistake—as witness the renaming of so many “business schools” into
“schools of management,” the rapidly growing offerings in “nonprofit
management” by these schools, the emergence of “executive management
programs” recruiting both business and nonbusiness executives or the
emergence of Departments of “Pastoral Management” in divinity
schools.</p>
<p>But the assumption that Management is Business Management still
persists. It is therefore important to assert—and to do so loudly—that
Management is NOT Business Management—any more than, say, Medicine is
Obstetrics.</p>
<p>There are, of course, differences in management between different
organizations—Mission defines Strategy, after all, and Strategy defines
Structure. There surely are differences between managing a chain of
retail stores and managing a Catholic diocese (though amazingly fewer
than either chain stores or bishops believe); between managing an air
base, a hospital and a software company. But the greatest differences
are in the terms individual organizations use. Otherwise the differences
are mainly in application rather than in principles. There are not even
tremendous differences in tasks and challenges. The executives of all
these organizations spend, for instance, about the same amount of their
time on people problems—and the people problems are almost always the
same. Ninety percent or so of what each of these organizations is
concerned with is generic. And the differences in respect to the last 10
percent are no greater between businesses and nonbusinesses than they
are between businesses in different industries, for example, between a
multinational bank and a toy manufacturer. In every
organization—business or nonbusiness alike—only the last 10 percent of
management has to be fitted to the organization’s specific mission, its
specific culture, its specific history and its specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>That Management is not Business Management is particularly important
as the growth sector of a developed society in the 21st century is most
unlikely to be business—in fact, business has not even been the growth
sector of the 20th century in developed societies. A far smaller
proportion of the working population in every developed country is now
engaged in economic activity, that is, in “business,” than it was a
hundred years ago. Then virtually everybody in the working population
made his or her living in economic activities (e.g., farming). The
growth sectors in the 20th century in developed countries have been in
“nonbusiness”—in government, in the professions, in health care, in
education. As an employer and a source of livelihood business has been
shrinking steadily for a hundred years (or at least since World War I).
And insofar as we can predict, the growth sector in the 21st century in
developed countries will not be “business,” that is, organized economic
activity. It is likely to be the nonprofit social sector. And that is
also the sector where management is today most needed and where
systematic, principled, theory-based management can yield the greatest
results the fastest.</p>
<p>The first Conclusion of this analysis of the ASSUMPTIONS that must
underlie Management to make productive both its study and its practice
is therefore:</p>
<p>Management is the specific and distinguishing organ of any and all
organizations.</p>
<p>II The One Right Organization</p>
<p>Concern with management and its study began with the sudden emergence
of large organizations—business, governmental civil service, the large
standing army—which was the novelty of late-19th-century society.</p>
<p>And from the very beginning more than a century ago, the study of
organization has rested on one assumption:</p>
<p>There is—or there must be—one right organization.</p>
<p>What is presented as the “one right organization” has changed more
than once. But the search for the one right organization has continued
and continues today.</p>
<p>Organization structure in business was first tackled in France around
the turn of the century, by Henri Fayol (1841– 1925), the head of one of
Europe’s largest but also totally disorganized enterprises, a
coal-mining company. (He did not, however, publish his book until 1916.)
Practitioners were also the first ones concerned with organization in
the United States and at about the same time: John J. Rockefeller, Sr.;
J. P. Morgan, and especially Andrew Carnegie (who still deserves to be
studied and who had the most lasting impact). A little later Elihu Root
applied organization theory to the U.S. Army, as already mentioned—and
it is hardly coincidence that Root had been Carnegie’s legal adviser. At
the same time, Georg Siemens (1839–1901), the founder in 1870 of the
Deutsche Bank, used (around 1895) the organization concepts of his
friend Fayol to save the rapidly floundering Siemens Electric Company
that his cousin Werner Siemens (1816–1892) had founded but had left
leaderless at his death.</p>
<p>Yet the need for organization structure was by no means obvious to
everybody in these early years.</p>
<p>Frederick Winslow Taylor did not see it at all. Until his death he
wrote and talked of “the owners and their helpers.” And it was on this
concept, that is, on a non-structure, that Henry Ford (1863–1947), up to
the time of his death, tried to run what for many years (until the late
1920s) was the world’s largest manufacturing company.</p>
<p>It was World War I that made clear the need for a formal organization
structure. But it was also World War I that showed that Fayol’s (and
Carnegie’s) functional structure was not the one right organization.
Immediately after World War I first Pierre S. Du Pont (1870–1954) and
then Alfred Sloan (1875–1966) developed Decentralization. And now, in
the last few years, we have come to tout the “Team” as the one right
organization for pretty much everything.</p>
<p>By now, however, it should have become clear that there is no such
thing as the one right organization. There are only organizations, each
of which has distinct strengths, distinct limitations and specific
applications. It has become clear that organization is not an absolute.
It is a tool for making people productive in working together. As such,
a given organization structure fits certain tasks in certain conditions
and at certain times.</p>
<p>One hears a great deal today about “the end of hierarchy.” This is
blatant nonsense. In any institution there has to be a final authority,
that is, a “boss”—someone who can make the final decisions and who can
expect them to be obeyed. In a situation of common peril—and every
institution is likely to encounter it sooner or later—survival of all
depends on clear command. If the ship goes down, the captain does not
call a meeting, the captain gives an order. And if the ship is to be
saved, everyone must obey the order, must know exactly where to go and
what to do, and do it without “participation” or argument. “Hierarchy,”
and the unquestioning acceptance of it by everyone in the organization,
is the only hope in a crisis.</p>
<p>Other situations within the same institution require deliberation.
Others still require teamwork—and so on.</p>
<p>Organization Theory assumes that institutions are homogeneous and
that, therefore, the entire enterprise should be organized the same
way.</p>
<p>Fayol assumed a “typical manufacturing enterprise.” Alfred Sloan in
the 1920s organized each of General Motors’ decentralized divisions
exactly the same way. Thirty years later, in the massive reorganization
of the (American) General Electric Company in the early 1950s, it was
still considered “heresy” to organize a small unit of a few dozen
researchers engaged solely on development work for the U.S. Air Force
differently from huge “departments” employing several thousand people
and manufacturing a standard product, for example, a toaster for the
kitchen. The small development group was actually saddled with a
manufacturing manager, a personnel manager, a financial manager, and a
public relations manager.</p>
<p>But in any one enterprise—probably even in Fayol’s “typical
manufacturing company”—there is need for a number of different
organization structures coexisting side by side.</p>
<p>Managing foreign currency exposure is an increasingly critical—and
increasingly difficult—task in a world economy. It requires total
centralization. No one unit of the enterprise can be permitted to handle
its own foreign currency exposures. But in the same enterprise servicing
the customer, especially in high-tech areas, requires almost complete
local autonomy—going way beyond traditional decentralization. Each of
the individual service people has to be the “boss,” with the rest of the
organization taking its direction from them.</p>
<p>Certain forms of research require a strict functional organization
with all specialists “playing their instrument” by themselves. Other
kinds of research, however, especially research that involves decision
making at an early stage (e.g., some pharmaceutical research), require
teamwork from the beginning. And the two kinds of research often occur
side by side and in the same research organization.</p>
<p>The belief that there must be one right organization is closely tied
to the fallacy that Management is Business Management. If earlier
students of management had not been blinkered by this fallacy but had
looked at nonbusinesses, they would soon have found that there are vast
differences in organization structure according to the nature of the
task.</p>
<p>A Catholic diocese is organized very differently from an opera. A
modern army is organized very differently from a hospital. But also,
typically, these institutions have more than one organization structure.
In the Catholic diocese, for instance, the bishop is the absolute
authority in certain areas, a constitutional monarch in others (severely
limited, for instance, in his right to discipline his diocesan clergy)
and virtually powerless in others—he cannot, for instance, visit a
parish in his diocese unless the parish priest invites him to do so. The
bishop appoints the members of the diocesan court—though custom
indicates which of his clerics are eligible for such an appointment. But
once that court is appointed it, rather than the bishop, has exclusive
jurisdiction in a great many areas.</p>
<p>There are indeed some “principles” of organization.</p>
<p>One is surely that organization has to be transparent. People have to
know and have to understand the organization structure they are supposed
to work in. This sounds obvious—but it is far too often violated in most
institutions (even in the military).</p>
<p>Another principle I have already mentioned: Someone in the
organization must have the authority to make the final decision in a
given area. And someone must clearly be in command in a CRISIS. It also
is a sound principle that authority be commensurate with
responsibility.</p>
<p>It is a sound principle that one person in an organization should
have only one “master.” There is wisdom to the old proverb of the Roman
Law that a slave who has three masters is a free man. It is a very old
principle of human relations that no one should be put into a conflict
of loyalties—and having more than one “master” creates such a conflict
(which, by the way, is the reason that the “Jazz Combo” team, so popular
now, is so difficult—every one of its members has two masters, the head
of the specialty function, for example, engineering, and the team
leader). It is a sound, structural principle to have the fewest layers,
that is, to have an organization that is as “flat” as possible—if only
because, as Information Theory tells us, “every relay doubles the noise
and cuts the message in half.”</p>
<p>But these principles do not tell us what to do. They only tell us
what not to do. They do not tell us what will work. They tell us what is
unlikely to work. These principles are not too different from the ones
that inform an architect’s work. They do not tell him what kind of
building to build. They tell him what the restraints are. And this is
pretty much what the various principles of organization structure
do.</p>
<p>One implication: Individuals will have to be able to work at one and
the same time in different organization structures. For one task they
will work in a team. But for another task they will have to work—and at
the same time—in a command and control structure. The same individual
who is a “boss” within his or her own organization is a “partner” in an
alliance, a minority participation, a joint venture and so on.
Organizations, in other words, will have to become part of the
executive’s toolbox.</p>
<p>Even more important: We need to go to work on studying the strengths
and the limitations of different organizations. For what tasks are what
organizations most suitable? For what tasks are what organizations least
suitable? And when, in the performance of a task, should we switch from
one kind of organization to another?</p>
<p>This analysis is perhaps most needed for the currently “politically
correct” organization: the team.</p>
<p>It is generally assumed today that there is only one kind of
team—call it the Jazz Combo—and that it fits every task. Actually there
are at least half a dozen—perhaps a full dozen—very different teams,
each with its own area of application, each with its own limitations and
difficulties, and each requiring different management. The team that is
popular now, the Jazz Combo, is arguably the most difficult one, the one
most difficult to make work and the one with the most severe
limitations. Unless we work out, and fast, what a given team is suited
for, and what a given team is not suited for, teams will become
discredited as “just another fad” within a few short years. Yet teams
are important. Where they do belong and where they do work, they are the
most effective organization.</p>
<p>And surely we will have to study and to use “mixed” structures rather
than only the “pure,” “one right organization,” which organization
theory—and largely also organization practice—still believes in.</p>
<p>One example: the dozen or more highly trained people needed to
perform open-heart surgery such as a heart bypass operation. They can be
seen as a pure—indeed an extreme—example of Fayol’s “functional
organization,” with each member—the lead surgeon, the two assistant
surgeons, the anesthesiologist, the two nurses who prepare the patient
for the operation, the three nurses who assist at the operation, the two
or three nurses and the resident in the recovery room and intensive care
unit, the respiratory technician running the heart-lung machine, the
three or four electronic technicians—each doing ONE, and only one task
and never, never doing anything else. Yet these people look upon
themselves as a “team”—and are seen as a team by everyone in the
hospital. They are indeed a “team” in that each member—immediately and
without anyone’s giving an order or saying one word—changes HOW he or
she is doing the job with the slightest change in the rhythm, the
progress, the flow of the operation.</p>
<p>One area in which research and study are particularly needed is the
ORGANIZATION OF TOP MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>Concern with organization actually began with the first conscious
design of the top management job—the AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. This design
did solve for the first time what had been the oldest organization
problem of political society and one that no earlier political system
could solve: the succession problem. The Constitution made sure that
there would always be a chief executive officer fully legitimate, fully
authorized and (hopefully) prepared for the job—and yet not threatening
the authority of the present incumbent as did the crown princes of yore.
In respect to the structure of top management in nonpolitical
organizations, work also antedates formal organization theory. Georg
Siemens—already mentioned as the founder of the Deutsche Bank and as the
savior, through imposing formal organization structure, of his cousin’s
electric company (and both the Deutsche Bank and the Siemens Electric
Company are still their country’s largest businesses in their respective
industries)—designed what to this day is the legal structure of top
management in Germany (and, with slight variations, in Central and
Northern Europe as well): a team of equal partners, each of whom,
however, is a FUNCTIONAL expert and all but autonomous in his or her
area, with the entire group then electing a “SPEAKER” who is not a
“boss” but a “leader.”</p>
<p>Yet I doubt that anyone would assert that we really know how to
organize the top management job, whether in a business, a university, a
hospital or even a modern church.</p>
<p>One clear sign is the growing disparity between our rhetoric and our
practice: We talk incessantly about “teams”—and every study comes to the
conclusion that the top management job does indeed require a team. Yet
we now practice—and not only in American industry—the most extreme
“personality cult” of CEO supermen. And no one seems to pay the
slightest attention in our present worship of these larger-than-life
CEOs to the question of how and by what process they are to be
succeeded—and yet, succession has always been the ultimate test of any
top management and the ultimate test of any institution.</p>
<p>There is, in other words, an enormous amount of work to be done in
organizational theory and organization practice—even though both are the
oldest areas of organized work and organized practice in management.</p>
<p>The pioneers of management a century ago were right. Organizational
Structure is needed. The modern enterprise—whether business, civil
service, university, hospital, large church or large military—needs
organization just as any biological organization beyond the ameba needs
structure. But the pioneers were wrong in their assumption that there
is—or should be—one right organization. Just as there are a great number
of different structures for biological organizations, so there are a
number of organizations for the social organism that is the modern
institution. Instead of searching for the right organization, management
needs to learn to look for, to develop, to test.</p>
<p>The organization that fits the task.</p>
<p>III The One Right Way to Manage People</p>
<p>In no other area are the basic traditional assumptions held as
firmly—though mostly subconsciously—as in respect to people and their
management. And in no other area are they so totally at odds with
reality and so totally counterproductive.</p>
<p>“There is one right way to manage people—or at least there should
be.” This assumption underlies practically every book or paper on the
management of people.</p>
<p>Its most quoted exposition is Douglas McGregor’s book The Human Side
of Enterprise (1960), which asserted that managements have to choose
between two and only two different ways of managing people, “Theory X”
and “Theory Y,” and which then asserted that Theory Y is the only sound
one. (A little earlier I had said pretty much the same thing in my 1954
book The Practice of Management.) A few years later Abraham H. Maslow
(1908–1970) showed in his Eupsychian Management (1962; new edition 1995
entitled Maslow on Management) that both McGregor and I were dead wrong.
He showed conclusively that different people have to be managed
differently.</p>
<p>I became an immediate convert—Maslow’s evidence is overwhelming. But
to date very few people have paid much attention.</p>
<p>On this fundamental assumption that there is—or at least should
be—one and only one right way to manage people, rest all the other
assumptions about people in organizations and their management.</p>
<p>One of these assumptions is that the people who work for an
organization are employees of the organization, working full-time, and
dependent on the organization for their livelihood and their careers.
Another such assumption is that the people who work for an organization
are subordinates. Indeed, it is assumed that the great majority of these
people have either no skill or low skills and do what they are being
assigned to do.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, when these assumptions were first formulated,
during and at the end of WWI, they conformed close enough to reality to
be considered valid. Today every one of them has become untenable. The
majority of people who work for an organization may still be employees
of the organization. But a very large and steadily growing
minority—though working for the organization—are no longer its
employees, let alone its full-time employees. They work for an
outsourcing contractor, for example, the outsourcing firm that provides
maintenance in a hospital or a manufacturing plant, or the outsourcing
firm that runs the data processing system for a government agency or a
business. They are “temps” or part-timers. Increasingly they are
individual contractors working on a retainer or for a specific
contractual period; this is particularly true of the most knowledgeable
and therefore the most valuable people working for the organization.</p>
<p>Even if employed full-time by the organization, fewer and fewer
people are “subordinates”—even in fairly low-level jobs. Increasingly
they are “knowledge workers.” And knowledge workers are not
subordinates; they are “associates.” For, once beyond the apprentice
stage, knowledge workers must know more about their job than their boss
does—or else they are no good at all. In fact, that they know more about
their job than anybody else in the organization is part of the
definition of knowledge workers.</p>
<p>The engineer servicing a customer does not know more about the
product than the engineering manager does. But he knows more about the
customer—and that may be more important than product knowledge. The
meteorologist on an air base is vastly inferior in rank to the air base
commander. But he is of no use unless he knows infinitely more about
weather forecasting than the air base commander does. The mechanic
servicing an airliner knows far more about the technical condition of
the plane than the airport manager of the airline to whom he reports,
and so on.</p>
<p>Add to this that today’s “superiors” usually have not held the jobs
their “subordinates” hold—as they did only a few short decades ago and
as still is widely assumed they do.</p>
<p>A regimental commander in the army, only a few decades ago, had held
every one of the jobs of his subordinates—battalion commander, company
commander, platoon commander. The only difference in these respective
jobs between the lowly platoon commander and the lordly regimental
commander was in the number of people each commands; the work they did
was exactly alike. To be sure, today’s regimental commanders have
commanded troops earlier in their careers—but often for a short period
only. They also have advanced through captain and major. But for most of
their careers they have held very different assignments—in staff jobs,
in research jobs, in teaching jobs, attached to an embassy abroad and so
on. They simply can no longer assume that they know what their
“subordinate,” the captain in charge of a company, is doing or trying to
do—they have been captains, of course, but they may have never commanded
a company.</p>
<p>Similarly, the vice-president of marketing may have come up the sales
route. He or she knows a great deal about selling. But he or she knows
nothing about market research, pricing, packaging, service, sales
forecasting. The marketing vice-president therefore cannot possibly tell
the experts in the marketing department what they should be doing, and
how. Yet they are supposed to be the marketing vice-president’s
“subordinates”—and the marketing vice-president is definitely
responsible for their performance and for their contribution to the
company’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The same is true for the hospital administrator or the hospital’s
medical director in respect to the trained knowledge workers in the
clinical laboratory or in physical therapy.</p>
<p>To be sure, these associates are “subordinates” in that they depend
on the “boss” when it comes to being hired or fired, promoted, appraised
and so on. But in his or her own job the superior can perform only if
these so-called subordinates take responsibility for educating him or
her, that is, for making the “superior” understand what market research
or physical therapy can do and should be doing, and what “results” are
in their respective areas. In turn, these “subordinates” depend on the
superior for direction. They depend on the superior to tell them what
the “score” is.</p>
<p>Their relationship, in other words, is far more like that between the
conductor of an orchestra and the instrumentalist than it is like the
traditional superior/subordinate relationship. The superior in an
organization employing knowledge workers cannot, as a rule, do the work
of the supposed subordinate any more than the conductor of an orchestra
can play the tuba. In turn, the knowledge worker is dependent on the
superior to give direction and, above all, to define what the “score” is
for the entire organization, that is, what are standards and values,
performance and results. And just as an orchestra can sabotage even the
ablest conductor—and certainly even the most autocratic one—a knowledge
organization can easily sabotage even the ablest, let alone the most
autocratic, superior.</p>
<p>Altogether, an increasing number of people who are full-time
employees have to be managed as if they were volunteers. They are paid,
to be sure. But knowledge workers have mobility. They can leave. They
own their “means of production,” which is their knowledge. (See on this
also Chapter Six.)</p>
<p>We have known for fifty years that money alone does not motivate to
perform. Dissatisfaction with money grossly demotivates. Satisfaction
with money is, however, mainly a “hygiene factor,” as Frederick Herzberg
called it all of forty years ago in his 1959 book The Motivation to
Work. What motivates—and especially what motivates knowledge workers—is
what motivates volunteers. Volunteers, we know, have to get more
satisfaction from their work than paid employees, precisely because they
do not get a paycheck. They need, above all, challenge. They need to
know the organization’s mission and to believe in it. They need
continuous training. They need to see results.</p>
<p>Implicit in this is that different groups in the work population have
to be managed differently, and that the same group in the work
population has to be managed differently at different times.
Increasingly “employees” have to be managed as “partners”—and it is the
definition of a partnership that all partners are equal. It is also the
definition of a partnership that partners cannot be ordered. They have
to be persuaded. Increasingly, therefore, the management of people is a
“marketing job.” And in marketing one does not begin with the question:
“What do we want?” One begins with the question: “What does the other
party want? What are its values? What are its goals? What does it
consider results?” And this is neither “Theory X” nor “Theory Y,” nor
any other specific theory of managing people.</p>
<p>Maybe we will have to redefine the task altogether. It may not be
“managing the work of people.” The starting point both in theory and in
practice may have to be “managing for performance.” The starting point
may be a definition of results—just as the starting points of both the
orchestra conductor and the foot-ball coach are the score.</p>
<p>The productivity of the knowledge worker is likely to become the
center of the management of people, just as the work on the productivity
of the manual worker became the center of managing people a hundred
years ago, that is, since Frederick W. Taylor. This will require, above
all, very different assumptions about people in organizations and their
work:</p>
<p>One does not “manage” people.</p>
<p>The task is to lead people.</p>
<p>And the goal is to make productive the specific strengths and
knowledge of each individual.</p>
<p>IV Technologies and End-Users Are Fixed and Given</p>
<p>Four major assumptions, as said above, have been underlying the
PRACTICE of Management all along—in fact for much longer than there has
been a DISCIPLINE of Management.</p>
<p>The assumptions about technology and end-users to a very large extent
underlie the rise of modern business and of the modern economy
altogether. They go back to the very early days of the Industrial
Revolution.</p>
<p>When the textile industry first developed out of what had been
cottage industries it was assumed—and with complete validity—that the
textile industry had its own unique technology. The same was true in
respect to coal mining, and of any of the other industries that arose in
the late 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. The first
one to understand this and to base a major enterprise on it was also one
of the first men to develop what we would today call a modern business,
the German Werner Siemens (1816–1892). It led him in 1869 to hire the
first university-trained scientist to start a modern research
lab—devoted exclusively to what we would now call electronics, and based
on a clear understanding that electronics (in those days called
“low-voltage”) was distinct and separate from all other industries, and
had its distinct and separate technology.</p>
<p>Out of this insight grew not only Siemens’s own company with its own
research lab, but also the German chemical industry, which assumed
worldwide leadership because it based itself on the assumption that
chemistry—and especially organic chemistry—had its own unique
technology. Out of it then grew all the other major leading companies
the world over, whether the American electrical and chemical companies,
the automobile companies, the telephone companies and so on. Out of this
insight then grew what may well be the most successful invention of the
19th century, the research laboratory—the last one almost a century
after Siemens’s, the 1950 lab of IBM—and at around the same time the
research labs of the major pharmaceutical companies as they emerged as a
worldwide industry after World War II.</p>
<p>By now these assumptions have become untenable. The best example is
of course the pharmaceutical industry, which increasingly has come to
depend on technologies that are fundamentally different from the
technologies on which the pharmaceutical research lab is based:
genetics, for instance, microbiology, molecular biology, medical
electronics and so on.</p>
<p>But the same thing has happened in the automobile industry, which
increasingly has become dependent on electronics, and on the computer.
It has happened to the steel industry, which increasingly has become
dependent on materials sciences of which the original steel companies
were totally ignorant—and largely still are. It has happened to the
paper industry—the list could be continued indefinitely.</p>
<p>In the 19th century and throughout the first half of the 20th
century, it could be taken for granted that technologies outside one’s
own industry had no, or at least only minimal, impact on the industry.
Now the assumption to start with is that the technologies that are
likely to have the greatest impact on a company and an industry are
technologies outside its own field.</p>
<p>The original assumption was of course that one’s own research lab
would and could produce everything the company—or the company’s
industry—needed. And in turn the assumption was that everything that
this research lab produced would be used in and by the industry that it
served.</p>
<p>This, for instance, was the clear foundation of what was probably the
most successful of all the great research labs of the last hundred
years, the Bell Labs of the American telephone system. Founded in the
early 1920s, the Bell Labs until the late 1960s did indeed produce
practically every new knowledge and every new technology the telephone
industry needed. And in turn practically everything the Bell Labs
scientists produced found its main use in the telephone system. This
changed drastically with what was probably the Bell Labs’s greatest
scientific achievement: the transistor. The telephone company itself did
become a heavy user of the transistor. But the main uses of the
transistor were outside the telephone system. This was so unexpected
that the Bell Telephone Company, when the transistor was first
developed, virtually gave it away—it did not see enough use for it
within the telephone system. But it also did not see any use for it
outside it. And so what was the most revolutionary development that came
out of the Bell Labs—and certainly the most valuable one—was sold freely
to all comers for the paltry sum of 5,000. It is on this total failure
of the Bell Labs to understand the significance of its own achievement
that practically all modern electronic companies outside of the
telephone are based.</p>
<p>Conversely, the things that have revolutionized the telephone
system—such as digital switching or the fiberglass cable—did not come
out of the Bell Labs. They came out of technologies that were foreign to
telephone technology. And this has been typical altogether of the last
thirty to fifty years—and it is increasingly becoming more typical of
every industry.</p>
<p>Technologies, unlike the 19th-century technologies, no longer run in
parallel. They constantly crisscross. Constantly, something in a
technology of which people in a given industry have barely heard (just
as the people in the pharmaceutical industry had never heard of
genetics, let alone of medical electronics) revolutionizes an industry
and its technology. Constantly, such outside technologies force an
industry to learn, to acquire, to adapt, to change its very mindset, let
alone its technical knowledge. The basic assumptions of genetics are
alien to a pharmacologist—and yet genetics is rapidly revolutionizing
the pharmaceutical industry. And the mindset of the geneticist is so
different that so far, no major pharmaceutical company has been able to
integrate genetics successfully into its own research program. It can
only get access to genetics by alliances with outsiders, whether through
minority participation in a genetics company or through an agreement
with a university genetics department.</p>
<p>Equally important to the rise of 19th- and early-20th-century
industry and companies was a second assumption: End-uses are fixed and
given. For a certain end-use, for example, to put beer into containers,
there may have been extreme competition between various suppliers of
containers. But all of them, until recently, were glass companies, and
there was only one way of putting beer into containers, a glass
bottle.</p>
<p>Similarly, as soon as steel became available, that is, beginning in
the last decades of the 19th century, rails for railroads were to be
made from steel and from nothing else. As soon as electricity began to
be transmitted over any distance, the wire had to be made from copper.
And the same assumption applied to services. The credit needs of a
business could only be supplied by a commercial loan from a commercial
bank. The post office had a “natural monopoly” on transporting and
delivering written and printed communications. There were two ways of
getting fed: cooking for oneself at home or going out to a
restaurant.</p>
<p>This was accepted as obvious not only by business, industry and the
consumer, but by governments as well. The American regulation of
business rests on the assumptions that to every industry pertains a
unique technology and that to every end-use pertains a specific and
unique product or service. These are the assumptions on which Anti-Trust
was based. And to this day Anti-Trust concerns itself with the
domination of the market in glass bottles and pays little attention to
the fact that beer increasingly is not put into glass bottles but into
cans (or, vice versa, Anti-Trust concerns itself exclusively with the
concentration of supply in respect to metal containers for beer, paying
no attention to the fact that beer is still being put into glass
bottles, but also increasingly into plastic cans). As late as the
mid-twenties the U.S. Supreme Court decided that there were two and only
two mutually exclusive and non-competitive ways for
telecommunication—the spoken word went via telephone and the written
word went via telegraph. And ten years later during the Depression, the
Congress of the United States separated investment banking from
commercial banking, each to be set up in separate institutions and each
having its own exclusive end-use.</p>
<p>But since WWII end-uses are not uniquely tied any more to a certain
product or service. The plastics of course were the first major
exception to the rule. But by now it is clear that it is not just one
material moving in on what was considered the “turf” of another one.
Increasingly the same want is being satisfied by very different means.
It is the want that is unique, and not the means to satisfy it.</p>
<p>As late as the beginning of WWII, news was basically the monopoly of
the newspaper—an 18th-century invention that saw its biggest growth in
the early years of the 20th century. By now there are several competing
ways to deliver news: still the printed newspaper, increasingly the same
newspaper delivered on-line through the Internet, radio, television,
separate news organizations that use only electronics—as is increasingly
the case with economic and business news—and quite a few additional
ones.</p>
<p>The U.S. Glass-Steagall Act of the Depression years not only
attempted to prevent commercial banks from doing business in the
investment market, it also tried to prevent investment bankers from
doing commercial banking business and thus tried to give banks a
monopoly on lending. One paradoxical result was that this act, intended
to establish the monopoly position of the bank in the commercial market,
has given the commercial market to the investment bankers. By a quirk of
American law (a Supreme Court decision of the 1920s) “commercial paper”
(the American equivalent to the European Bill of Exchange) was
classified as a “security.” This then enabled the investment bankers
after 1960 to become the dominant force in the commercial banking
business, that is, to replace increasingly the banks’ commercial loan
with the investment bankers’ “commercial paper.”</p>
<p>But increasingly in all developed countries the fastest-growing
source of commercial credit is neither the commercial bank nor the
investment bank. It is the credit card in its various forms. A still
fairly small but rapidly growing number of credit card customers have
multiple credit cards—some as many as twenty-five or thirty. They use
these cards to obtain and to maintain a level of credit far beyond their
creditworthiness. That the interest rate is very high does not seem to
bother them, since they do not have any intention anyhow of paying off
the loans. They manipulate them by shifting the outstanding balance from
one card to the other so that they are never forced to pay more than
very small, minimum amounts. The credit card has thus become what used
to be called “legal tender.” Nobody knows how big this new form of money
has become—but it is clearly a new form of money. And it has already
become so big as to make almost meaningless the figures for money in
circulation, whether M1 or M2 or M3, on which central banks and
economists base their theories and their forecasts.</p>
<p>And then there is the new “basic resource” information. It differs
radically from all other commodities in that it does not stand under the
scarcity theorem. On the contrary, it stands under an abundance theorem.
If I sell a thing—for example, a book—I no longer have the book. If I
impart information, I still have it. And in fact, information becomes
more valuable the more people have it. What this means for economics is
well beyond the scope of this book—though it is clear that it will force
us radically to revise basic economic theory. But it also means a good
deal for management. Increasingly basic assumptions will have to be
changed. Information does not pertain to any industry or to any
business. Information also does not have any one end-use, nor does any
end-use require a particular kind of information or depend on one
particular kind of information.</p>
<p>Management therefore now has to start out with the assumption that
there is no one technology that pertains to any industry and that, on
the contrary, all technologies are capable—and indeed likely—to be of
major importance to any industry and to have impact on any industry.
Management similarly has to start with the assumption that there is no
one given end-use for any product or service and that, conversely, no
end-use is going to be linked to any one product or service.</p>
<p>Some implications of this are that increasingly the non-customers of
an enterprise—whether a business, a university, a church, a hospital—are
as important as the customers, if not more important.</p>
<p>Even the biggest enterprise (other than a government monopoly) has
many more noncustomers than it has customers. There are very few
institutions that supply as large a percentage of a market as 30
percent. There are therefore few institutions where the noncustomers do
not amount to at least 70 percent of the potential market. And yet very
few institutions know anything about the noncustomers—very few of them
even know that they exist, let alone know who they are. And even fewer
know why they are not customers. Yet it is with the noncustomers that
changes always start.</p>
<p>Another critical implication is that the starting point for
management can no longer be its own product or service, and not even its
known market and its known end-uses for its products and services. The
starting point has to be what customers consider value. The starting
point has to be the assumption—an assumption amply proven by all our
experience—that the customer never buys what the supplier sells. What is
value to the customer is always something quite different from what is
value or quality to the supplier. This applies as much to a business as
to a university or to a hospital.</p>
<p>One example is the pastoral mega-churches that have been growing so
very fast in the United States since 1980, and that are surely the most
important social phenomenon in American society in the last thirty
years. Almost unknown thirty years ago—there were no more than a
thousand churches then that had a congregation exceeding two thousand
people—there are now some twenty thousand of them. And while all the
traditional denominations have steadily declined, the mega-churches have
exploded. They have done so because they asked, “What is value?” to a
nonchurchgoer. And they have found that it is different from what
churches traditionally thought they were supplying. The greatest value
to the thousands who now throng the mega-churches—and do so week-days
and Sundays—is a spiritual experience rather than a ritual, and equally
management, responsibility for volunteer service, whether in the church
itself or, through the church, in the community.</p>
<p>Management, in other words, will increasingly have to be based on the
assumption that neither technology nor end-use is a foundation for
management policy. They are limitations. The foundations have to be
customer values and customer decisions on the distribution of their
disposable income. It is with those that management policy and
management strategy increasingly will have to start.</p>
<p>V Management’s Scope Is Legally Defined</p>
<p>Management, both in theory and in practice, deals with the legal
entity, the individual enterprise—whether the business corporation, the
hospital, the university and so on. The scope of management is thus
legally defined. This has been—and still is—the almost universal
assumption.</p>
<p>One reason for this assumption is the traditional concept of
management as being based on command and control. Command and control
are indeed legally defined. The chief executive of a business, the
bishop of a diocese, the administrator of a hospital have no command and
control authority beyond the legal confines of their institution.</p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago it first became clear that the legal
definition was not adequate to manage a major enterprise.</p>
<p>The Japanese are usually credited with the invention of the
“Keiretsu,” the management concept in which the suppliers to an
enterprise are tied together with their main customer, for example,
Toyota, for planning, product development, cost control and so on. But
actually the Keiretsu is much older and an American invention. It goes
back to around 1910 and to the man who first saw the potential of the
automobile to become a major industry, William C. Durant (1861–1947). It
was Durant who created General Motors by buying up small but successful
automobile manufacturers such as Buick and merging them into one big
automobile company. A few years later Durant then realized that he
needed to bring the main suppliers into his corporation. He began to buy
up and merge into General Motors one parts and accessories maker after
the other, finishing in 1920 by buying Fisher Body, the country’s
largest manufacturer of automobile bodies. With this purchase General
Motors had come to own the manufacturers of 70 percent of everything
that went into its automobiles—and had become by far the world’s most
integrated large business. It was this prototype Keiretsu that gave
General Motors the decisive advantage, both in cost and in speed, which
made it within a few short years both the world’s largest and the
world’s most profitable manufacturing company, and the unchallenged
leader in an exceedingly competitive American automobile market. In
fact, for some thirty-odd years, General Motors enjoyed a 30 percent
cost advantage over all its competitors, including Ford and
Chrysler.</p>
<p>But the Durant Keiretsu was still based on the belief that management
means command and control—this was the reason that Durant bought all the
companies that became part of General Motors’ Keiretsu. And this
eventually became the greatest weakness of GM. Durant had carefully
planned to ensure the competitiveness of the GM-owned accessory
suppliers. Each of them (excepting Fisher Body) had to sell 50 percent
of its output outside of GM, that is, to competing automobile
manufacturers, and thus had to maintain competitive costs and
competitive quality. But after WWII the competing automobile
manufacturers disappeared—and with them the check on the competitiveness
of GM’s wholly owned accessory divisions. Also, with the unionization of
the automobile industry in 1936–1937, the high labor costs of automobile
assembly plants were imposed on General Motors’ accessory divisions,
which put them at a cost disadvantage that to this day they have not
been able to overcome. That Durant based his Keiretsu on the assumption
that management means command and control largely explains, in other
words, the decline of General Motors in the last twenty-five years and
the company’s inability to turn itself around.</p>
<p>This was clearly realized in the 1920s and 1930s by the builder of
the next Keiretsu, Sears Roebuck. As Sears became America’s largest
retailer, especially of appliances and hardware, it too realized the
necessity to bring together into one group its main suppliers so as to
make possible joint planning, joint product development and product
design, and cost control across the entire economic chain. But instead
of buying these suppliers, Sears bought small minority stakes in
them—more as a token of its commitment than as an investment—and based
the relationship otherwise on contract. And the next Keiretsu
builder—and probably the most successful one so far (even more
successful than the Japanese)—was Marks andandandand Spencer in England,
which, beginning in the early 1930s, integrated practically all its
suppliers into its own management system, but exclusively through
contracts rather than through ownership stakes or ownership control.</p>
<p>It is the Marks andandandand Spencer model that the Japanese, quite
consciously, copied in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Actually, the share of even the most highly integrated enterprise in
the total costs and the total results of the entire process is quite
small indeed. While General Motors at its peak manufactured 70 percent
of everything that went into the finished automobile, it got only 15
percent of what the ultimate consumer actually paid for a new car. Fifty
percent of the total went for distribution, that is, for costs incurred
after the finished car had left the General Motors assembly plant.
Another 10–15 percent of the total were various taxes. And of the
remaining 35 percent of the total, one-half—another 17 percent—was still
payments to outside suppliers. Yet no manufacturing company in history
has dominated a larger share of the total economic process than did GM
at the period of its greatest success, that is, in the 1950s and 1960s.
The share of the typical manufacturing company in the costs and revenues
of the economic process—that is, what the customer ultimately
pays—rarely amounts to as much as an almost insignificant 10 percent of
the total. Yet if management’s scope is legally defined, this is all the
manufacturer typically has any information on—and all it can even try to
manage.</p>
<p>In every single case, beginning with General Motors, the Keiretsu,
that is, the integration into one management system of enterprises that
are linked economically rather than controlled legally, has given a cost
advantage of at least 25 percent and more often 30 percent. In every
single case it has given dominance in the industry and in the
marketplace.</p>
<p>And yet the Keiretsu is not enough. It is still based on power.
Whether it is General Motors and the small, independent accessory
companies that Durant bought between 1915 and 1920, or Sears Roebuck, or
Marks andandandand Spencer, or Toyota—the central company has
overwhelming economic power. The Keiretsu is not based on a partnership
of equals. It is based on the dependence of the suppliers.</p>
<p>Increasingly, however, the economic chain brings together genuine
partners, that is, institutions in which there is equality of power and
genuine independence. This is true of the partnership between a
pharmaceutical company and the biology faculty of a major research
university. This is true of the joint ventures through which American
industry got into Japan after WWII. This is true of the partnerships
today between chemical and pharmaceutical companies and companies in
genetics, molecular biology or medical electronics. These companies in
the new technologies may be quite small—and very often are—and badly in
need of capital. But they own independent technology. Therefore they are
the senior partners when it comes to technology. They, rather than the
much bigger pharmaceutical or chemical company, have a choice with whom
to ally themselves. The same is largely true in information technology,
and also in finance. And then neither the traditional Keiretsu nor
command and control work.</p>
<p>What is needed, therefore, is a redefinition of the scope of
management. Management has to encompass the entire process. For business
this means by and large the economic process. But the biology department
of the major research university does not see itself as an economic
unit, and cannot be managed as such. In other institutions the process
also has to be defined differently. Where we have gone furthest in
trying to build management of the entire process is American health
care. The HMO (health maintenance organization) is an attempt—a first
and so far a very tentative, very debatable attempt—to bring the entire
process of health care delivery under partnership management.</p>
<p>The new assumption on which management, both as a discipline and as a
practice, will increasingly have to base itself is that the scope of
management is not legal.</p>
<p>It has to be operational. It has to embrace the entire process. It
has to be focused on results and performance across the entire economic
chain.</p>
<p>VI Management’s Scope Is Politically Defined</p>
<p>It is still generally assumed in the discipline of management—and
very largely still taken for granted in the practice of management—that
the domestic economy, as defined by national boundaries, is the ecology
of enterprise and management—and of nonbusinesses as much as of
businesses.</p>
<p>This assumption underlies the traditional “multinational.”</p>
<p>As is well known, before WWI, as large a share of the world’s
production of manufactured goods and of financial services was
multinational as it is now. The 1913 leading company in any industry,
whether in manufacturing or in finance, derived as large a share of its
sales from selling outside its own country as it did by selling inside
its own country. But insofar as it produced outside its own national
boundaries, it produced within the national boundaries of another
country.</p>
<p>One example:</p>
<p>The largest supplier of war matériel to the Italian Army during WWI
was a young but rapidly growing company called Fiat in Turin—it made all
the automobiles and trucks for the Italian Army. The largest supplier of
war matériel to the Austro-Hungarian Army in WWI was also a company
called Fiat—in Vienna. It supplied all the automobiles and trucks to the
Austro-Hungarian Army. It was two to three times the size of its parent
company. For Austria-Hungary was a much larger market than Italy, partly
because it had a much larger population, and partly because it was more
highly developed, especially in its Western parts. Fiat-Austria was
wholly owned by Fiat-Italy. But except for the designs that came from
Italy, Fiat-Austria was a separate company. Everything it used was made
or bought in Austria. All products were sold in Austria. And every
employee up to and including the CEO was an Austrian. When WWI came, and
Austria and Italy became enemies, all the Austrians had to do,
therefore, was to change the bank account of Fiat-Austria—it kept on
working as it had all along.</p>
<p>Even traditional industries like the automotive industry or insurance
are no longer organized that way.</p>
<p>Until recently General Motors’ two European subsidiaries, Opel in
Germany and Vauxhall in the UK, were separate companies, one producing
in Germany and selling on the Continent, one producing and selling in
the UK. Now GM has one European company, designing, producing and
selling in all of Europe and run out of one European headquarters.
GM-Europe also produces in South America and Asia—and also sells in the
United States. GM-Europe increasingly also designs for the rest of
General Motors Worldwide. In turn, General Motors USA increasingly
designs and produces for GM-Europe and GM-Brazil, and so on. The
worldwide insurance companies—the foremost of them today a German one,
Allianz—are increasingly moving major activities, such as settling
claims, and above all investment, into central facilities that do the
work for all the group’s businesses, wherever they are.</p>
<p>Post-WWII industries such as the pharmaceutical industry, or the
information industries, are increasingly not even organized in
“domestic” and “international” units as GM and Allianz still are. They
are run as a worldwide system in which individual tasks, whether
research, design, engineering, development, testing and increasingly
manufacturing and marketing, are each organized “transnationally.”</p>
<p>One large pharmaceutical company has seven labs in seven different
countries, each focusing on one major area (e.g., antibiotics) but all
run as one “research department” and all reporting to the same research
director in headquarters. The same company has manufacturing plants in
eleven countries, each highly specialized and producing one or two major
product groups for worldwide distribution and sale. It has one medical
director who decides in which of five or six countries a new drug is to
be tested. But managing the company’s foreign exchange exposure is
totally centralized in one location for the entire system. The
medical-electronics business of the (American) General Electric Company
has three “headquarters,” one in the United States, one in Japan, one in
France, each in charge worldwide of one major technology area and the
products based on it (e.g., imaging products such as traditional X-ray
machines or the more recent ultrasound machines). And each of the three
manufactures in a dozen or more countries with each plant supplying a
few key parts for all the other plants throughout the world.</p>
<p>In the traditional multinational, economic reality and political
reality were congruent. The country was the “business unit,” to use
today’s term. In today’s transnational—but increasingly, also, in the
old multinationals as they are being forced to transform themselves—the
country is only a “cost center.” It is a complication rather than the
unit for organization and the unit of business, of strategy, of
production and so on. (But see Chapter Two for some of the resulting
problems.)</p>
<p>Management and national boundaries are no longer congruent. The scope
of management can no longer be politically defined. National boundaries
will continue to be important.</p>
<p>But the new assumption has to be:</p>
<p>National boundaries are important primarily as restraints. The
practice of management—and by no means for businesses only—will
increasingly have to be defined operationally rather than
politically.</p>
<p>VII The Inside Is Management’s Domain</p>
<p>All the traditional assumptions led to one conclusion: The inside of
the organization is the domain of management.</p>
<p>This assumption explains the otherwise totally incomprehensible
distinction between management and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In actual practice this distinction makes no sense whatever. An
enterprise, whether a business or any other institution, that does not
innovate and does not engage in entrepreneurship will not survive
long.</p>
<p>The oldest institution in the world is the Roman Catholic church. It
is usually considered the most conservative one—and prides itself on not
being given to rapid changes. Yet, as an old observation has it, any
major change in society produces new and very different religious orders
in the Roman Catholic church—the Benedictines in the 5th century A.D.,
when the Barbarians overran the Roman Empire; the Franciscans and
Dominicans, seven hundred years later, when cities reemerged in the
Middle Ages; the Jesuits in the 16th century as an answer to the
Protestant Reformation, and so on. In Protestantism, as the great church
historian Richard Niebuhr (1894–1962) showed in several books, any major
change in society leads to the emergence of new Protestant
denominations. The emergence of the Knowledge Society today, for
instance, has led on the one hand to the explosive rise of the new,
large, nondenominational, pastoral “mega-churches” that attract the new
knowledge workers, and to equally explosive worldwide growth of
Pentecostalism, attracting largely the less educated and therefore not
upwardly mobile members of modern society.</p>
<p>It should have been obvious from the beginning that management and
entrepreneurship are only two different dimensions of the same task. An
entrepreneur who does not learn how to manage will not last long. A
management that does not learn to innovate will not last long. In fact,
as Chapter Three will argue, business—and every other organization
today—has to be designed for change as the norm and to create change
rather than react to it.</p>
<p>But entrepreneurial activities start with the Outside and are focused
on the Outside. They therefore do not fit within the traditional
assumptions of management’s domain—which explains why they have come so
commonly to be regarded as different, if not incompatible. Any
organization, however, which actually believes that management and
entrepreneurship are different, let alone incompatible, will soon find
itself out of business.</p>
<p>The inward focus of management has been greatly aggravated in the
last decades by the rise of Information Technology. Information
Technology so far may actually have done more damage to management than
it has helped, as discussed in greater depth in Chapter Four.</p>
<p>The traditional assumption that the inside of the organization is the
domain of management means that management is assumed to concern itself
with efforts, if not with costs only. For effort is the only thing that
exists within an organization. And, similarly, everything inside an
organization is a cost center.</p>
<p>But results of any institution exist only on the outside.</p>
<p>It is understandable that management began as a concern for the
inside of the organization. When the large organizations first
arose—with the business enterprise, around 1870, the first and by far
the most visible one—managing the inside was the new challenge. Nobody
had ever done it before. But while the assumption that management’s
domain is the inside of the organization originally made sense—or at
least can be explained—its continuation makes no sense whatever. It is a
contradiction of the very function and nature of organization.</p>
<p>Management must focus on the results and performance of the
organization. Indeed, the first task of management is to define what
results and performance are in a given organization—and this, as anyone
who has worked on it can testify, is in itself one of the most
difficult, one of the most controversial, but also one of the most
important tasks. It is therefore the specific function of management to
organize the resources of the organization for results outside the
organization.</p>
<p>The new assumption—and the basis for the new paradigm on which
management, both as a discipline and as a practice has to be based—is
therefore:</p>
<p>Management exists for the sake of the institution’s results. It has
to start with the intended results and has to organize the resources of
the institution to attain these results. It is the organ to make the
institution, whether business, church, university, hospital or a
battered women’s shelter, capable of producing results outside of
itself.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This chapter has not tried to give answers—intentionally so. It has
tried to raise questions. But underlying all of these is one insight.
The center of a modern society, economy and community is not technology.
It is not information. It is not productivity. It is the managed
institution as the organ of society to produce results. And management
is the specific tool, the specific function, the specific instrument to
make institutions capable of producing results. This, however, requires
a FINAL new management paradigm:</p>
<p>Management’s concern and management’s responsibility are everything
that affects the performance of the institution and its results—whether
inside or outside, whether under the institution’s control or totally
beyond it.</p>
