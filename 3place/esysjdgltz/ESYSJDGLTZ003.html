New Certainties</h4>
<p>Why Strategy? •The Collapsing Birthrate •The Distribution of Income
•The Present Growth Industries •Defining Performance •Global
Competitiveness •The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Reality and
Political Reality</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Why Strategy?</p>
<p>Every organization operates on a Theory of the Business,* that is, a
set of assumptions as to what its business is, what its objectives are,
how it defines results, who its customers are, what the customers value
and pay for.</p>
<p>Strategy converts this Theory of the Business into performance. Its
purpose is to enable an organization to achieve its desired results in
an unpredictable environment. For strategy allows an organization to be
purposefully opportunistic.</p>
<p>Strategy is also the test of the Theory of the Business. Failure of
the strategy to produce the expected results is usually the first
serious indication that the Theory of the Business needs to be thought
through again. And unexpected successes are often also the first
indications that the Theory of the Business needs to be rethought.
Indeed, what is an “opportunity” can only be decided if there is a
strategy. Otherwise, there is no way to tell what genuinely advances the
organization toward its desired results, and what is diversion and
splintering of resources.</p>
<p>But what can strategy be based on in a period of rapid change and
total uncertainty, such as the world is facing at the turn of the 21st
century? Are there any assumptions on which to base the strategies of an
organization and especially of a business? Are there any
certainties?</p>
<p>There are indeed FIVE phenomena that can be considered certainties.
They are, however, different from anything present strategies consider.
Above all, they are not, essentially, economic. They are primarily
social and political.</p>
<p>These five certainties are:</p>
<p>1 The Collapsing Birthrate in the Developed World.</p>
<p>2 Shifts in the Distribution of Disposable Income.</p>
<p>3 Defining Performance.</p>
<p>4 Global Competitiveness.</p>
<p>5 The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Globalization and
Political Splintering.</p>
<p>I The Collapsing Birthrate</p>
<p>The most important single new certainty—if only because there is no
precedent for it in all of history—is the collapsing birthrate in the
developed world. In Western and Central Europe and in Japan, the
birthrate has already fallen well below the rate needed to reproduce the
population. That is, below 2.1 live births for women of reproductive
age. In some of Italy’s richest regions, for example, in Bologna, the
birthrate by the year 1999 had fallen to 0.8; in Japan to 1.3. In fact,
Japan and all of Southern Europe—Portugal, Spain, Southern France,
Italy, Greece—are drifting toward collective national suicide by the end
of the 21st century. By then Italy’s population, for instance—now 60
million—might be down to 20 or 22 million; Japan’s population—now 125
million—might be down to 50 or 55 million. But even in Western and
Northern Europe the birthrates are down to 1.5 and falling.</p>
<p>But in the United States, too, the birthrate is now below 2 and going
down steadily. And it is as high as it is only because of the large
number of recent immigrants who still, for the first generation, tend to
retain the high birthrates of their country of origin, for example,
Mexico.</p>
<p>In Japan and in Southern Europe, population is already peaking as it
is in Germany. In the United States it will still grow for another
twenty to twenty-five years, though the entire growth after the year
2015 will be in people fifty-five years and older.</p>
<p>But more important than absolute numbers is the age distribution
within the population. Of those 20-odd million Italians by the year
2080, a very small number will be under fifteen, and a very large
number—at least one-third of the population—well above sixty. In Japan
the disproportion between younger people and people above any
traditional retirement age will be equally great if not greater. In the
United States, the young population is already growing much more slowly
than the older population, past traditional retirement. Still, up to the
year 2015 or so, the number of young people will still be growing in
absolute numbers in the United States. But then it is likely to go down
and quite rapidly.</p>
<p>Birthrates can change, and can do so quite fast, as the American
experience after World War II proved. But even if the birthrates in the
developed world were to turn up drastically, it would take twenty years
or so before these new babies would reach the age at which they join the
labor force. There is nothing—except unprecedentedly massive
immigration—that can prevent a sharp drop in the labor force of
traditional age (i.e., below sixty or sixty-five) in the developed
world—in the United States after 2025 or so, in the rest of the
developed world much earlier.</p>
<p>There is no precedent for this. The birthrate within part of the
Roman Empire may have been falling after A.D. 200 or 250 but, of course,
there are no figures. Above all, there is no precedent for a population
structure in which old people past any traditional retirement age
outnumber young people as they already do in parts of Europe and as they
will do in all developed countries well before the middle of the 21st
century.</p>
<p>For at least two hundred years, all institutions of the modern world
and especially all businesses have assumed a steadily growing
population. In the West the population has been growing since 1400. And
from 1700 on the growth has been very fast—until well after World War
II. Population growth in Japan began around 1600 or so, that is, after
the end of the Civil Wars. It speeded up around 1800 and has continued
until well after World War II. But increasingly, in all developed
countries, the strategy of all institutions will have to be based, from
now on, on the totally different assumption of a shrinking population,
and especially of a shrinking young population.</p>
<p>An aging population—the demographic phenomenon that now preoccupies
economists, politicians and the public in all developed countries—is
nothing new. Life expectancies have been growing in the developed world
since the 18th and certainly since the 19th century. They have not even
been growing very much faster the last fifty years than they did in the
last hundred and fifty years. And we also know how to deal with the
problem. It will be difficult, painful, turbulent and terribly
unpopular, to be sure. But within the next twenty to thirty years the
retirement age in all developed countries will have to move up to around
seventy-nine or so—seventy-nine being the age that, in terms of both
life and health expectancies, corresponds to age sixty-five in 1936,
when the United States, the last Western country to do so, adopted a
national retirement plan (Social Security).</p>
<p>Similarly, there is nothing particularly new in the growth of the
population in the Third World. It largely parallels the growth of
population in the developed countries a hundred years earlier—it is not
even significantly faster. And the population growth in most of the
Third World is slowing down so fast that one can predict with near
certainty that population in the Third World—excepting perhaps only
India—will level off well before it reaches a crisis point. We know that
in terms of food and raw materials there is going to be no major crisis.
We know that clean water and clean air will present tremendous
problems—and that altogether population and environment will have to be
brought into balance. But that too is not as new a problem as most
people believe. In some places in Europe (e.g., the German Ruhr) the
problem was faced early in the 20th century and was solved then, and
quite satisfactorily.</p>
<p>What is, to repeat, totally unprecedented is the collapse of the
birthrate in the developed world.</p>
<p>Some of the implications are clear.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For the next twenty or thirty years demographics will dominate the
politics of all developed countries. And they will inevitably be
politics of great turbulence. No country is prepared for the issues.
Indeed, in no country are political factions and political parties
aligned around the issues that demographics pose. Is extending
retirement age “right” or “left”? Is encouraging older people to keep on
working past age sixty by exempting from taxes part or all of their
earned income “progressive” or “reactionary,” “Liberal” or
“Conservative”?</li>
</ol>
<p>But equally upsetting—perhaps even more so—will be the political
issue of immigration. The population decline in the developed and rich
countries is accompanied by population growth in most of the neighboring
and poor countries of the Third World—in the case of the United States,
in Central America and the Caribbean; in the case of Southern Europe, in
North Africa; in the case of Germany, a Third World Russia; in the case
of Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia and mainland Southeast Asia. To
prevent immigration pressure is, however, very much like preventing the
law of gravity. Yet there is no more inflammatory issue than large-scale
immigration, especially from countries of different cultures and
religions. And the turbulence will, in all likelihood, be most severe in
Japan, in part because it still has the lowest retirement age, in part
because its labor market is totally inflexible, but also because Japan
has never before—at least not in her recorded history—allowed any
immigration whatsoever. Conversely, the problems are likely to be least
severe in the United States both because it is, after all, a country of
immigrants and because it has the most flexible labor markets. But even
in the United States the demographic changes are bound to create
enormous political emotions and to bring about totally new—and
unpredictable—political shifts.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>For the next twenty or thirty years no developed country is
likely, therefore, to have stable politics or a strong government.
Government instability is going to be the norm.</p></li>
<li><p>“Retirement” may come to mean two different things. It is quite
likely that the trend toward “early retirement” will continue. But it
will no longer mean that a person stops working. It will come to mean
that a person stops working full-time or as an employee for an
organization for the entire year rather than a few months at a time.
Employment relations—traditionally among the most rigid and most uniform
relationships—are likely to become increasingly heterogeneous and
increasingly flexible, at least for older people (on this see also
Chapters One and Six). This will increasingly be the case as the center
of gravity in the older population shifts from manual workers to people
who have never worked with their hands, and especially to knowledge
workers—a shift that will begin in the United States around the year
2010 when the babies of the “baby boom” which began in 1948 reach
traditional retirement age. For these babies were the first age cohort
in human history, a majority of which did not go into manual work but
increasingly into knowledge work. They are therefore also the first age
cohort in human history who, after thirty or forty years of full-time
work, are not physically worn out by hard manual labor but still, in the
great majority, perfectly capable to function and to work, both
physically and mentally.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Major innovations in work and employment are therefore already needed
in Europe and Japan. In the United States there may still be enough
young people to postpone radical changes until around 2010. Yet in all
likelihood the new employment relations are likely to be developed first
in the United States, again because it has the most flexible and least
restrictive labor markets and a tradition of experimentation by
individual employers as well as by individual employees.</p>
<p>In the United States, therefore, employing organizations—and by no
means only businesses—should start as soon as possible to experiment
with new work relationships with older people and especially with older
knowledge workers. The organization that first succeeds in attracting
and holding knowledge workers past traditional retirement age, and makes
them fully productive, will have a tremendous competitive advantage. In
any event the strategy of any organization should be based on the
assumption that twenty or thirty years hence, a large and growing part
of the work—including some of the organization’s most important
work—will be done by people who are past traditional working age; who
are not and should be neither “executives” nor “subordinates,” but have
no rank; who, above all, are not “employees” in the traditional sense
and certainly not full-timers coming to work in a corporate office every
day.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The final implication is that in all developed countries the
productivity of all workers—whether full-time or part-time—and
especially of all knowledge workers, will have to increase very rapidly
(on this see Chapter Five). Otherwise the country—and every organization
in it—will lose position and become steadily poorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what are the implications for the individual company in a
developed country?</p>
<p>The first question is whether the steady growth in the number of
older people will continue to provide market opportunities—and for how
long? In all developed countries older people have become the most
prosperous group in the society, with their postretirement incomes in
many cases substantially higher than their preretirement incomes. Their
numbers will continue to increase. But will their income stay high or go
down? And will they continue to spend as freely as they have been doing?
And—the biggest question mark—will they continue to want to be “young”
and spend accordingly? The answer to these questions will very largely
shape the consumer market in the developed countries and with it the
economy altogether.</p>
<p>And what does the shrinkage in the number of young people—and
especially of people under eighteen, that is, babies, children and
teenagers—mean for the economy and for the individual business? Is it
only a threat? Or may it also be an opportunity for a particular
institution?</p>
<p>That there will be fewer children might be seen as a tremendous
opportunity for upgrading schools everywhere. So far, Japan is the only
country that even understands that the crucial element in a country’s
ability to perform is the education of the small child, and that
therefore the elementary school teacher is the truly important part of
the educational establishment, and needs to be treated, to be respected
and to be paid as such.</p>
<p>But even for a business that makes its living making goods for small
children, the collapsing birthrate may be an opportunity. It is
conceivable that having fewer children means that the child becomes more
and more precious and that a larger share of the disposable income is
spent on it.</p>
<p>This apparently has already happened in the one country that has had
a shrinking birthrate as a national goal: China. The Chinese policy that
restricts a family to one child has been quite effective in the large
cities of China, where a majority of families have only one child. And
there many families, despite their poverty, apparently spend more on the
single child than they used to spend on three or four children. There
are signs in Germany, but also in Italy, of similar developments. And
even in the United States the middle-class family—where the birthrate is
already way down—is clearly spending a good deal more on its fewer
children. That it realized and exploited this underlay the tremendous
success of the Mattel Company with its expensive Barbie dolls.</p>
<p>The birthrate collapse has tremendous political and social
implications that we cannot even guess at today. But it surely will also
have tremendous economic and business implications—and some of those can
already be explored, some of them can already be tested. Above all, any
strategy, that is, any commitment of present resources to future
expectations—and this, to repeat, is what a strategy means—has to start
out with demo-graphics and, above all, with the collapsing birthrate in
the developed world. Of all developments, it is the most spectacular,
the most unexpected and one that has no precedent whatever.</p>
<p>II The Distribution of Income</p>
<p>Shifts in the shares of disposable income are just as important as
shifts in population, but usually even less attention is paid to them.
And they are likely—indeed all but certain—to be as dramatic as the
demographic changes during the first decades of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Businesses and industries have become highly conscious of their
market standing. They all keep figures on their sales and know whether
their sales go up or down. All of them know whether they grow in volume
or not. But practically none knows the truly important figure: the share
of the disposable income of their customers—whether other institutions
and businesses or ultimate consumers—that is being spent on the products
or services that they produce and sell. And practically no one knows
whether the share goes up or down.</p>
<p>Shares in disposable income are the foundation of all economic
information. In the first place, of all the outside information needed
by a business (see on this Chapter Four), it is usually the most easily
obtainable. It is usually also the most reliable foundation for
strategy. For as a rule, trends in the distribution of disposable income
that go to a certain product category or service category tend, once
established, to persist for long periods of time. They are usually
impervious even to the business cycle.</p>
<p>But for that reason, there are few more important changes for an
institution than a change in the trend. And equally important is a
change within the trend, that is, a switch from one kind of product or
service within a category to another product or service within the same
category.</p>
<p>And within the first decades of the 21st century there will be both
changes in the trends and changes within the trend. Yet neither
executives nor economists pay much attention to the distribution of the
shares of disposable income. In fact, most are totally ignorant of
them.</p>
<p>Practically all economists and the great majority of business
executives believe, for instance, that the great economic expansion of
the 20th century was driven by economic forces. It was not; on the
contrary, the share of disposable income allocated to economic
satisfaction has steadily dropped during this century in all developed
countries.</p>
<p>The four growth sectors during the 20th century were,
respectively:</p>
<p>• Government</p>
<p>• Health Care</p>
<p>• Education</p>
<p>• Leisure</p>
<p>with Leisure probably taking as much of the enormous expansion of
economic productivity and output as the other three together.</p>
<p>In 1900 the great majority of people in the developed countries still
worked at least sixty hours a week, fifty-one weeks a year—with about
eight holidays a year—and six days a week. By the end of the century the
great majority works fewer than forty hours a week—thirty-four or
thirty-five in Germany—and at most (in the United States) forty-seven
weeks a year (i.e., with about twelve holidays per year) and five days a
week—a drop from more than 3,000 hours a year to fewer than 1,500 hours
in Germany and to 1,850 hours in the hardest-working developed country,
the United States.</p>
<p>Of these four 20th-century growth sectors, Government probably has
the greatest impact on the distribution of disposable income. Not
because it is a major buyer or user of products and services; except in
wartime even the biggest government is only a marginal consumer. But the
main economic function of government in a developed country is to
redistribute between 30 and 50 percent of the country’s national income.
Nothing else has therefore as great an impact on the distribution of
shares of national income as changes in government policy.</p>
<p>The other three—Health Care, Education, Leisure—are all major users
of products and services, that is, of material goods. But none of them
provides material, and that means “economic,” satisfactions.</p>
<p>And all four are not in the “Free Market,” do not behave according to
the economist’s rules of supply and demand, are not particularly “price
sensitive” and altogether do not fit the economist’s model or behave
according to the economist’s theories.</p>
<p>And yet, together, they are well over half of a developed economy,
even of the most “capitalist” one.</p>
<p>The trends of these four sectors are therefore the first thing
strategy has to consider. And all four are certain to change greatly in
the next decades.</p>
<p>Government in its traditional form, that is, as collector and
redistributor of national income, is supposed to have stopped growing
(though the figures so far, especially in the United States and the UK,
do not support this belief). But governments in all developed
countries—despite all “privatization”—are rapidly acquiring new and very
powerful tools to influence—if not to control—the distribution of
disposable income: new regulations that control and direct economic
resources to new goals, for example, the environment. Strategy,
therefore, has to consider government the first concern in industry or
company strategy.</p>
<p>Leisure, by contrast, is “mature” and may be “declining.” In the
developed countries we are probably at the end of the steady cutting of
weekly hours. Indeed, these are signs that work hours are going up
again—especially in the United States and the UK. The leisure
market—next to armaments the 20th century’s fastest-growing
market—already shows the signs of a declining market: rapidly increasing
competition for time, that is, for the leisure market’s “purchasing
power”; sharply declining profit margins; and less and less true product
differentiation, for example, between going to the movies or looking at
a VCR on one’s own TV at home.</p>
<p>Both health care and education should continue to be major “growth
sectors”—demographics make reasonably sure of this. But both are certain
to undergo major shifts within the sector, for example, the shift,
discussed earlier, from schooling the young to the continued education
of highly schooled adult knowledge workers. And, probably, the shifts in
health care ahead of us—in every developed country—are going to be even
more radical and may happen even faster.</p>
<p>What do these developments in the 20th century’s growth sectors mean
for the 21st century’s strategy of an industry and of a particular
institution within it, whether a business, a university, a hospital, a
church?</p>
<p>The answer to this question first requires defining what makes an
industry a “growth” industry, a “mature” industry or a “declining”
industry. A growth industry is one in which the demand for its products,
whether goods or services, grows faster than national income and/or
population. An industry in which the demand for its products or services
grows as fast as national income and/or population is a “mature”
industry. And an industry in which the demand for its products or
services grows less fast than national income and/or population is a
“declining” industry, even if its absolute sales volume still continues
to grow.</p>
<p>The passenger-automobile industry of the world, for instance, has
been a declining industry for the last thirty or forty years. It was a
growth industry until 1960 or perhaps 1970. By that time Europe and
Japan had become fully motorized. Total sales of passenger cars the
world over are still growing worldwide, though only slowly. But they are
growing much less fast than either national income or population.</p>
<p>Similarly, since the First World War—and probably since 1900—the
share of disposable income in the developed countries, but altogether in
the world economy, that is being spent on commodities of all kinds has
been going down steadily at the rate of one-half of one percent per
annum compound—wartimes excepted. This has held true for both food and
industrial raw materials. This has meant that since 1900, the prices of
all commodities have trended downward over any period of time.</p>
<p>And the trend is still downward.</p>
<p>Mature or declining industries may turn around and again become
growth industries.</p>
<p>This may be the case of industries that produce transportation
materials, for example, locomotives or road-building equipment. In the
developed countries the existing transportation infrastructure has been
grossly undermaintained. In emerging and Third World countries it is
decades behind the needs of the economy and of the population—with
China, perhaps, the outstanding example. Will this lead to another
transportation boom such as fueled the economic expansion of the
mid-19th century? There are few signs of this so far—but it is one of
the trends to be watched.</p>
<p>For, to repeat, few things are as important for a strategy—both as
threat and as opportunity—as a change in the trend of the shares of
disposable income that such an upturn would represent.</p>
<p>The Present Growth Industries</p>
<p>But what are the present growth industries—and what can we learn from
them?</p>
<p>The world’s fastest-growing and most prosperous industry in the
closing thirty years of the 20th century has not been Information. It
has been Financial Services—but Financial Services the like of which did
not exist at any earlier time, that is, retail services to provide an
affluent, aging population in the developed countries with financial
products to provide retirement income. And the demographic changes
discussed earlier in this chapter largely underlie these new financial
services.</p>
<p>Increasingly in the developed countries the newly affluent
middle-class people, and especially those who do not work with their
hands but work as service or knowledge workers, realize when they reach
age forty-five or fifty that the existing retirement provisions are
unlikely to be adequate should they survive into old age. And thus,
beginning with age forty-five or fifty these people begin to look for
investments that will promise them financial security thirty years
hence.</p>
<p>This new growth industry is, however, quite different from the
traditional financial industry such as the “corporate banker,” a J. P.
Morgan for instance, a Citibank or a Goldman Sachs. The new investors
are not primarily interested in “making money” or in “deals.” Their main
concern is to maintain what little money they have as a cushion for
their retirement years. The institutions that understand this—mutual
funds, pension-fund managers and a few, mostly new, brokerage
houses—have prospered mightily, first in the United States, then in the
UK, and increasingly in Continental Europe and in the Japanese
markets.</p>
<p>Most of the traditional financial “giants” did not, how-ever,
understand that the very meaning of “financial services” has changed.
They only saw that “finance” takes a larger—a much larger—share of the
disposable income in the developed countries. They therefore rapidly
expanded their traditional “corporate” services. But actually the share
of these traditional financial services—major corporate loans or major
public offerings of corporate securities—is not growing. In all
likelihood it is shrinking, and quite fast. For this is primarily a
market of big companies. The growth sector in every developed
country—even Japan—in the last twenty years has, however, been mid-sized
businesses, with the share of big business going down steadily. And
mid-sized businesses typically are not customers for traditional
“corporate” financial services.</p>
<p>As a result the traditional financial giants have greatly
overexpanded worldwide. And as their legitimate corporate business
became less and less profitable—in part because there was increasingly
less of it, in part because competition for the pieces of the shrinking
pie has become fiercer and fiercer, driving down profits to the
vanishing point—these corporate-banking giants, American, British,
Japanese, German, French, Swiss, have increasingly resorted to “trading
for their own account,” that is, to outright speculation, so as to
support their swollen overheads. This, however, as centuries of
financial history teach (beginning with the Medici in 15th-century
Europe), has only one—but an absolutely certain—outcome: catastrophic
losses. And it is these losses resulting from a misreading of the trend
toward financial services as a major growth industry which in large
measure triggered the financial crisis that began in Asia in the
mid-nineties and is threatening to engulf the entire world economy.</p>
<p>The actual trend, that is, the growth of the new “retail finance” and
of the new investors, is, however, likely to continue despite the
crisis. At least it is likely to continue until developed societies have
adapted their retirement systems to the new demo-graphic realities
discussed earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p>Here is another example—and another lesson.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that what we call “information”—and what might be
more aptly called “Access to the World”—has been a major growth
industry, growing much faster in every developed or developing
country—and even in totally under-developed Third World countries—than
either national income or population. All of us hear “Electronics” or
“Computers” when we hear “Information.” But the number of printed books
published and sold in every developed country has gone up in the last
thirty or forty years as fast as the sales of the new electronics (on
this see Chapter Four). The world’s leading book publishing companies
may not have grown as fast as some of the top electronic companies such
as Intel and Microsoft in the United States or SAP in Germany, but they
have grown faster than the electronic-information industry in its
totality—and are arguably more profitable. And yet, though the United
States has been the world’s biggest and fastest-growing printed-book
market, no U.S. publisher saw this. As a result many American book
publishers are now owned by non-Americans (with Bertelsmann, Holtzbrinck
and Murdoch in the lead). And these firms increasingly dominate the
printed-book market in the rest of the world—and it is growing there
just as fast as in the United States, in Japan or in Europe (e.g.,
Bertelsmann’s book clubs in China).</p>
<p>Industries, whether businesses or nonbusinesses, have to be managed
differently depending on whether they are growth industries, mature
industries or declining industries. A growth industry that can count on
demand for its products or services growing faster than economy or
population manages to create the future. It needs to take the lead in
innovation and needs to be willing to take risks. A mature industry
needs to be managed to have a leadership position in a few, a very few,
but crucial areas, and especially in areas where the demand can be
satisfied at substantially lower cost by advanced technology or advanced
quality. And it needs to be managed for flexibility and rapid change. A
mature industry shifts from one way of satisfying wants to another. A
mature industry therefore needs to be managed for alliances,
partnerships and joint ventures to adapt rapidly to such shifts.</p>
<p>One example is the pharmaceutical industry. Until very recently—since
the invention of the sulfa drugs and the antibiotics just before World
War II—it was a leading growth industry. In the 1990s it became a mature
industry. This means with high probability that there will be fast and
sudden shifts to new ways of satisfying the old demands, for example,
from chemical drugs to genetics, molecular biology, medical electronics,
or even to “alternative medicine.”</p>
<p>In a declining industry one has to manage, above all, for steady,
systematic, purposeful cost reduction and for steady improvement in
quality and service, that is, for strengthening the company’s position
within the industry, rather than for growth in volume—which one can only
take away from somebody else. For in a declining industry it is more and
more difficult to establish meaningful product differentiation. Products
in a declining industry tend to become “commodities”—as is rapidly
happening with passenger automobiles (except so far for a few luxury
cars).</p>
<p>In conclusion, institutions—businesses as well as non-businesses—will
have to learn to base their strategy on their knowledge of, and
adaptation to, the trends in the distribution of disposable income and,
above all, to any shifts in this distribution. And they need both
quantitative information and qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>III Defining Performance</p>
<p>James Harrington (1611–1677), the Father of the English political
philosophy out of which grew Locke, Hume, Burke, and The Federalist
Papers, laid down in his book Oceania that “Power Follows Property.” It
was the shift in property from the great nobles to the country squires,
he argued, that explained the English Revolution of the 1640s, the
overthrow of absolute government and its replacement by the
parliamentary government of the new property owners, the local
gentry.</p>
<p>Demographics have, within the last fifty years, shifted property in
all developed countries. We now are beginning to see the resultant
shifts in power. Two developments—the emergence of an affluent (though
by no means rich) middle class of nonmanual workers, and the extension
of life expectancy—have led to the development of institutions such as
the pension funds and the mutual funds. And these are now the legal
“owners” of the key property in a modern, developed society, that is, of
the publicly owned corporations.</p>
<p>The development began in the United States (it was first described in
my 1975 book, The Unseen Revolution, reissued in 1993 as The Pension
Fund Revolution). As a result, institutions representing the future
pensioners now own at least 40 percent of American publicly listed
corporations, and probably more than 60 percent of the big ones. They
similarly own British business. And they are beginning to be the owners
of business in all other developed countries, Germany, France, Japan and
so on. And with that shift in property, we are seeing a shift in
power.</p>
<p>This underlies the present debate about the Governance of
Corporations, which is basically a debate concerning for whose benefit
businesses should be run. It underlies the dramatic shift to the
predominance of the “shareholder interest.” And a similar debate is
beginning to emerge in all other developed countries.</p>
<p>Till now it has not been the prevailing theorem in any country that a
business, and especially a large business, should be run exclusively—or
even primarily—in the interest of the shareholders. In the United
States, since the late 1920s, the prevailing theorem, however fuzzy,
held that the business should be run for a balance of
interests—customers, employees, share-holders and so on—which in fact
meant that it should not be accountable to anyone. Britain more or less
followed the same path. In Japan, Germany and Scandinavia, large
enterprises have been seen—and are still being seen—as being run
primarily to create and to maintain social harmony, which in effect
means that they are to be run in the interest of manual workers.</p>
<p>These traditional views are now obsolescent. But the emerging
American theorem that businesses should be run exclusively for the
short-term interest of the shareholders is also not tenable, and will
certainly have to be revised.</p>
<p>The future economic security of more and more people—that is, of the
people who can expect to live into old age—is increasingly dependent on
their economic investments—that is, on their income as owners. The
emphasis on performance as that which most benefits the shareholders
will therefore not go away. Immediate gains, whether in earnings or in
share price, are, however, not what they need. They need economic
returns twenty or thirty years hence. But at the same time, as Chapter
Five on the productivity of the knowledge worker explains, businesses
will increasingly have to satisfy the interests of their knowledge work
employees—or at least put these interests high enough to attract and to
hold the knowledge workers they need, and to make them productive.</p>
<p>Consequently, the employee for whose sake the traditional German or
Japanese company is supposed to be run, that is, the manual worker, will
increasingly be less and less important—and with it the traditional
emphasis on “social harmony” as the performance objective of business
enterprise, and especially of large enterprise.</p>
<p>The present debate about the Governance of Corporations is therefore
only a first skirmish. We will have to learn to establish new
definitions of what “performance” means in a given enterprise, and
especially in the large, publicly owned enterprise. We will have to
learn how to balance short-term results—which is what the present
emphasis on “shareholder value” amounts to—with the long-range
prosperity and survival of the enterprise. Even in purely financial
terms, we face something totally new: the need for an enterprise to
survive thirty or forty years, that is, to survive until its investors
are reaching pensionable age. This is a formidable goal—and so far quite
Utopian. The average life span of business enterprise, at least as a
successful organization, has never in the past been more than thirty
years. We will therefore have to learn to develop new concepts of what
“performance” means in an enterprise. We will have to develop new
measurements and so on. But at the same time performance will have to be
defined nonfinancially so as to be meaningful to the knowledge workers
and to generate “commitment” from them. And that is a nonfinancial, a
“value” return.</p>
<p>All institutions will therefore have to think through what
performance means. This used to be obvious and simple. It no longer is.
And strategy increasingly will have to be based on new definitions of
performance.</p>
<p>IV Global Competitiveness</p>
<p>All institutions have to make global competitiveness a strategic
goal. No institution, whether a business, a university or a hospital,
can hope to survive, let alone to succeed, unless it measures up to the
standards set by the leaders in its field, anyplace in the world.</p>
<p>One implication: It is no longer possible to base a business or a
country’s economic development on cheap labor. However low its wages, a
business—except for the smallest and most purely local one, for example,
a local restaurant—is unlikely to survive, let alone to prosper, unless
its workforce rapidly attains the productivity of the leaders of the
industry anyplace in the world. This is true particularly in
manufacturing. For in most manufacturing industries of the developed
world the cost of manual labor is rapidly becoming a smaller and smaller
factor—one-eighth of total costs or less. Low labor productivity
endangers a company’s survival. But low labor costs no longer give
enough of a cost advantage to offset low labor productivity.</p>
<p>This (as already said in Chapter One) also means that the economic
development model of the 20th century—the model first developed by Japan
after 1955 and then successfully copied by South Korea and Thailand—no
longer works. Despite their enormous surplus of young people qualified
only for unskilled manual work, emerging countries from now on will have
to base growth either on technological leadership (as did the United
States and Germany in the second half of the 19th century), or on
productivity equal to that of the world leaders in a given industry, if
not on themselves becoming the world’s productivity leaders.</p>
<p>The same is true for all areas: Design, Marketing, Finance,
Innovation—that is, for management altogether. Performance below the
world’s highest standards stunts, even if the costs are very low and
even if government subsidies are very high. And “Protection” no longer
protects, no matter how high the custom duties or how low the import
quotas.</p>
<p>Still, in all likelihood, we face a protectionist wave throughout the
world in the next few decades. For the first reaction to a period of
turbulence is to try to build a wall that shields one’s own garden from
the cold winds outside. But such walls no longer protect
institutions—and especially businesses—that do not perform up to world
standards. It will only make them more vulnerable.</p>
<p>The best example is Mexico, which for fifty years from 1929 on had a
deliberate policy of building its domestic economy independent of the
outside world. It did this not only by building high walls of
protectionism to keep foreign competition out. It did it—and this was
uniquely Mexican in the 20th-century world—by practically forbidding its
own companies to export. This attempt to create a modern but purely
Mexican economy failed dismally. Mexico actually became increasingly
dependent on imports, both of food and of manufactured products, from
the outside world. It was finally forced to open itself to the outside
world, since it simply could no longer pay for the needed imports. And
then Mexico found that a good deal of its industry could not
survive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Japanese tried to protect the bulk of their business
and industry by keeping the foreigners out while creating a small but
exceedingly competitive number of export industries—and then providing
these industries with capital at very low or no cost, thus giving them a
tremendous competitive advantage. That policy too has failed. The
present (1999) crisis in Japan is in large part the result of the
failure to make the bulk of Japanese business and industry (and
especially its financial industries) globally competitive.</p>
<p>Strategy, therefore, has to accept a new fundamental. Any
institution—and not just businesses—has to measure itself against the
standards set by each industry’s leaders anyplace in the world.</p>
<p>V The Growing Incongruence Between Economic Reality and Political
Reality</p>
<p>The final fundamental on which to base strategy in the period of
worldwide structural change and uncertainty is the growing incongruence
between economic reality and political reality.</p>
<p>The world economy is increasingly becoming global. National
boundaries are impediments and cost centers. As discussed in the first
chapter of this book, business—and increasingly many other institutions
as well—can no longer define their scope in terms of national economies
and national boundaries. They have to define their scope in terms of
industries and services worldwide.</p>
<p>But at the same time, political boundaries are not going to go away.
In fact, it is doubtful that even the new regional economic units, the
European Economic Community, the North American Free Trade Zone (NAFTA)
or Mercosur, the proposed economic community in South America, will
actually weaken political boundaries, let alone overcome them.</p>
<p>There has been talk about the “end of sovereignty” since well before
1918. But nothing has emerged yet to take the place of national
government and national sovereignty in political affairs. In fact, since
1914, the trend has been toward increasing splintering. Gone are the
empires that politically unified the largest areas of the world before
1914—Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire; the British, the French,
the Dutch; the Portuguese and the Belgian Empires; the Eurasian Empire
of Tsars and Communists. At the same time, small political units have
become economically viable because money and information have become
“transnational” (which actually means that they have no nationality
whatever). Since 1950 one mini-state after the other has come into
being, each with its own government, its own military, its own
diplomatic service, its own tax and fiscal policy and so on. So far
there are no signs yet of any global institutions, not even in the
economic sphere, for example, a global Central Bank controlling the
totally reckless flows of money worldwide, let alone a global
institution controlling tax and monetary policies worldwide.</p>
<p>Even within transnational economic units, national politics still
overrule economic rationality. Despite the European Economic Community,
for instance, it has proven all but politically impossible to close a
totally redundant plant in Belgium and shift the work to a French plant
of the same company only thirty miles away, but on the other side of a
national border.</p>
<p>We have in fact three overlapping spheres. There is a true global
economy of money and information. There are regional economies in which
goods circulate freely and in which impediments to the movement of
services and of people are being cut back, though by no means
eliminated. And then increasingly there are national and local
realities, which are both economic, but above all political. And all
three are growing fast. And businesses—and other institutions, for
example, universities—have no choice. They have to live and perform in
all spheres, and at the same time. This is the reality on which strategy
has to be based. But no management anyplace knows yet what this reality
actually means. They are all still groping.</p>
<p>Many—perhaps most—large multinationals in manufacturing, in finance,
in insurance have organized themselves into worldwide “business units”
across national boundaries. The leasing business of a financial services
company is, for example, run as one business, whether in Spain or in
Hong Kong. And it is run separately from any other business of the same
financial services company in Spain or in Hong Kong, for example, the
company’s foreign exchange business. But company after company has
learned that for the local government or the local labor union—or any
other local political agency—the “business unit” is a meaningless
fiction. For them Spain or Hong Kong are the only meaningful reality and
the Spanish or Hong Kong businesses of the company are therefore the
only units they perceive and accept and are willing to deal with. No
company I know has yet been able to figure out in advance what decision
and action can actually be handled as a decision or action of the
“business unit” and which will have to be handled as a “national”
one—let alone how to work out in advance how to make an action or a
decision fit both realities, the economic reality of the transnational
business unit and the political reality of Spanish or Hong Kong
“sovereignty.”</p>
<p>But some implications are already clear. First, it is clear what not
to do—that is, to be willing to be bribed to subordinate economic
decisions to local politics. Because the political unit is becoming
increasingly less powerful economically, it is increasingly tempted to
offer all kinds of bribes—exemption from taxes, for instance;
special-tariff protection; a guaranteed monopoly; all kinds of
subsidies, and so on—to obtain an economic advantage. A typical example
is the lavish subsidies given to European and Japanese automobile
companies by some Southeastern U.S. states to bribe the companies into
putting their new U.S. plants into the state. But of course there are
hundreds—and probably thousands—of additional examples.</p>
<p>And a good many of them are much worse examples. The European and
Japanese automobile companies had good economic reasons (at least they
thought so) to build plants in the United States. In many other
cases—for instance the bribes offered by small countries—the bribe is
the only reason for a company to go into a certain country or to bail
out a local company in trouble. It is absolutely predictable, however,
that a decision motivated by such a bribe rather than by economic
reality will turn into a disaster.</p>
<p>This is what happened, for instance, to every single manufacturing
plant put by a U.S. company in the 1960s and 1970s into a small Latin
American country, because that country’s government promised to give the
company a monopoly in the national market.</p>
<p>“There ain’t no bargains” is old folk wisdom. The first rule for a
business in managing the incongruence between economic reality and
political reality is therefore NOT to do anything that does not satisfy
economic reality. The first question has to be: “If we didn’t get the
bribe, would we do this as part of our business strategy?” If the answer
is “no,” don’t do it however tempting the bribe. It will be a costly
failure. But even if the answer is “yes,” it is almost certainly wise to
say “no” to the proffered bribe. All experience—and there is plenty of
it—indicates that, in the end, one pays and pays heavily for accepting
such bribes.</p>
<p>Closely related is another “Don’t.” Do not expand or grow globally by
going into businesses—especially not by acquisition—unless they fit into
the company’s Theory of the Business and its overall strategy.</p>
<p>In different regions or different countries, different products
and/or services will behave differently. In France, for instance, the
Coca-Cola Company does far better selling fruit juices than it does
selling carbonated Cokes. In Japan one of its major products is coffee
dispensed in vending machines. But both fruit juices and prepared coffee
fit Coca-Cola’s Theory of the Business and its strategy. Physically they
are different from the original Coke. In every other aspect, that is, as
businesses, they are exactly the same.</p>
<p>To repeat something said earlier in this chapter: A strategy enables
an institution to be purposefully opportunistic. If what looks like an
opportunity does not advance the strategic goal of the institution, it
is not an opportunity. It is a distraction. Even if it fits—or seems to
fit—a particular national, that is, political, reality, it is still a
distraction and is to be left alone. Otherwise it is practically bound
to end in failure.</p>
<p>So much for the “Don’ts.” And now the two “Do’s” we already know.</p>
<p>Business growth and business expansion in different parts of the
world will increasingly not be based on mergers and acquisitions or even
on starting new, wholly owned businesses there. They will increasingly
have to be based on alliances, partnerships, joint ventures and all
kinds of relations with organizations located in other political
jurisdictions. They will, in other words, increasingly have to be based
on structures that are economic units and not legal—and therefore not
political—units.</p>
<p>There are many other reasons—some of them discussed earlier—that
growth henceforth will be based on partnerships of all sorts rather than
on outright ownership and command and control. But in all likelihood one
of the most compelling ones will be the need to operate in both a global
world economy and a splintered world polity. A partnership is by no
means a perfect solution to this problem. In fact, partnerships have
enormous problems of their own. But at least the conflict between
economic reality and legal reality is greatly lessened if the economic
unit is not also a legal unit, but is a partnership, an alliance, a
joint venture that is a relationship in which political and legal
appearance can be separated from economic reality.</p>
<p>The final implication: All businesses will have to learn to manage
their currency exposure. Every business, even a purely local one, is in
the world economy today. As such, it is subject to currency fluctuations
even if it does not sell outside its own country, or does not buy
outside it.</p>
<p>Even the most provincial and most local Mexican company was severely
hit by the sudden collapse of the Mexican peso a few years ago. Even the
most purely local Indonesian company was severely hit by the sudden
collapse of the Indonesian currency in 1998.</p>
<p>There is no country today that is immune to sudden currency
fluctuations—for the simple reason that the world is awash in “virtual
money,” that is, in liquidity for which there is no profitable
investment. Every country, therefore, is awash in money that is not
invested in property, in businesses, in manufacturing or in service
enterprises, but kept in liquid and volatile “portfolio” investment. And
very few countries have enough of a surplus in their balance of payments
to service the interest on this “portfolio investment,” let alone to pay
it out should it take flight. Every country’s currency, in other words,
is at the mercy of short-term movements of money for which there may not
be any economic rationale whatever.</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of what was expected in 1973 when
President Nixon cut the dollar loose from any fixed value and made it
“float.” The idea then was that this would limit currency fluctuations
to minor adjustments. But because governments—beginning with the
American government—grossly abused this new “freedom,” currencies have
become extremely unstable. They can be expected to continue to remain
unstable. There is practically no reason to expect that the political
units, that is, the various nations, will subordinate their fiscal,
monetary and credit policies to any but their own political authority.
It is to be hoped that the new European Bank will be able to maintain
the Euro stable as a regional currency. But it is much too much to hope
that the individual countries within the European unions will then
subordinate their domestic policies to the stability of the Euro.</p>
<p>In other words, strategy has to be based on the assumption that
currencies will continue to be volatile and unstable. One implication of
this is that every management will have to learn what so far few
managements can do: manage their foreign exchange exposure.</p>
<p>The realities discussed in this chapter do not tell an institution
what to do, let alone how to do it. They raise the questions to which
strategy has to find the answers for the individual institution. And
there are questions that strategy so far has rarely, if ever,
considered. But unless an institution starts out by considering these
new realities, it will not have a strategy. It will not be prepared for
the challenges that the next few years, if not the next few decades, are
certain to raise. Unless these challenges can be met successfully, no
enterprise can expect to succeed, let alone to prosper, in a period of
turbulence, of structural change and of economic, social, political and
technological transformation.</p>
