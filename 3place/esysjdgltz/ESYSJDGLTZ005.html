<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The New Information Revolution</p>
<p>A new Information Revolution is well under way. It has started in
business enterprise, and with business information. But it will surely
engulf ALL institutions of society. It will radically change the MEANING
of information for both enterprises and individuals. It is not a
revolution in technology, machinery, techniques, software or speed. It
is a revolution in CONCEPTS. It is not happening in Information
Technology (IT), or in Management Information Systems (MIS), and is not
being led by Chief Information Officers (CIOs). It is led by people on
whom the Information Industry tends to look down: accountants. But an
Information Revolution has also been going on in information for the
individual. Again it is not happening in IT or MIS, and is not led by
CIOs. It is a print revolution. And what has triggered these information
revolutions and is driving them is the failure of the “Information
Industry”—the IT people, the MIS people, the CIOs—to provide
INFORMATION.</p>
<p>So far, for fifty years, Information Technology has centered on
DATA—their collection, storage, transmission, presentation. It has
focused on the “T” in “IT.” The new information revolutions focus on the
“I.” They ask, “What is the MEANING of information and its PURPOSE?” And
this is leading rapidly to redefining the tasks to be done with the help
of information and, with it, to redefining the institutions that do
these tasks.</p>
<p>I From the “T” to the “I” in “IT”</p>
<p>A half century ago, around 1950, prevailing opinion over-whelmingly
held that the market for that new “miracle,” the computer, would be in
the military and in scientific calculations, for example, astronomy. A
few of us, however—a very few indeed—argued even then that the computer
would find major applications in business and would have an impact on
it. These few also foresaw—again very much at odds with the prevailing
opinion (even of practically everyone at IBM, just then beginning its
ascent)—that in business the computer would be more than a very fast
adding machine doing clerical chores such as payroll or telephone bills.
On specifics, we dissenters disagreed, of course, as “experts” always
do. But all of us nonconformists agreed on one thing: The computer
would, in short order, revolutionize the work of top management. It
would, we all agreed, have its greatest and earliest impacts on business
policy, business strategy and business decisions.</p>
<p>We could not have been more wrong. The revolutionary impacts so far
have been where none of us then anticipated them: on OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>Not one of us, for instance, could have imagined the truly
revolutionary software now available to architects. At a fraction of
traditional cost and time, it designs the “innards” of large buildings:
their water supply and plumbing; their lighting, heating and
air-conditioning; their elevator specifications and placement—work that
even a few years ago still absorbed some two-thirds of the time and cost
of designing an office building, a large school, a hospital or a
prison.</p>
<p>Not one of us could then have imagined the equally revolutionary
software available to today’s surgical residents. It enables them to do
“virtual operations” whose outcomes include “virtually killing” patients
if the resident makes the wrong surgical move. Until recently, residents
rarely even saw much of an operation before the very end of their
training.</p>
<p>Half a century ago no one could have imagined the software that
enables a major equipment maker such as Caterpillar to organize its
operations, including manufacturing worldwide, around the anticipated
service and replacement needs of its customers. And the computer has had
a similar impact on bank operations, with banking probably the most
computerized industry today.</p>
<p>But the computer and the information technology arising from it have
so far had practically no impact on the decision whether or not to build
a new office building, a school, a hospital or a prison, or on what its
function should or could be. They have had practically no impact on the
decision to perform surgery on a critically sick patient or on what
surgery to perform. They have had no impact on the decision of the
equipment manufacturer concerning which markets to enter and with which
products, or on the decision of a major bank to acquire another major
bank. For top management tasks, information technology so far has been a
producer of data rather than a producer of information—let alone a
producer of new and different questions and new and different
strategies.</p>
<p>The people in Management Information Systems (MIS) and in Information
Technology (IT) tend to blame this failure on what they call the
“reactionary” executives of the “old school.” It is the wrong
explanation. Top executives have not used the new technology because it
has not provided the information they need for their own tasks. The data
available in business enterprise are, for instance, still largely based
on the early-19th-century theorem that lower costs differentiate
businesses and make them compete successfully. MIS has taken the data
based on this theorem and computerized them. They are the data of the
traditional accounting system. Accounting was originally created, at
least five hundred years ago, to provide the data a company needed for
the preservation of its assets and for their distribution if the venture
were liquidated. And the one major addition to accounting since the 15th
century—cost accounting, a child of the 1920s—aimed only at bringing the
accounting system up to 19th-century economics, namely, to provide
information about, and control of, costs. (So does, by the way, the
now-so-popular revision of cost accounting: total quality
management.)</p>
<p>But, as we began to realize around the time of World War II, neither
preservation of assets nor cost control is a top management task. They
are OPERATIONAL TASKS. A serious cost disadvantage may indeed destroy a
business. But business success is based on something totally different,
the creation of value and wealth. This requires risk-taking decisions:
on the theory of the business, on business strategy, on abandoning the
old and innovating the new, on the balance between immediate
profitability and market share. It requires strategic decisions based on
the New Certainties discussed in Chapter Two. These decisions are the
true top management tasks. It was this recognition that underlay, after
World War II, the emergence of management as a discipline, separate and
distinct from what was then called business economics and is now called
microeconomics. But for none of these top management tasks does the
traditional accounting system provide information. Indeed, none of these
tasks is even compatible with the assumptions of the traditional
accounting model. The new information technology, based on the computer,
had no choice but to depend on the accounting system’s data. No others
were available. It collected these data, systematized them, manipulated
them, analyzed them and presented them. On this rested, in large
measure, the tremendous impact the new technology had on what cost
accounting data were designed for: operations. But it also explains
information technology’s near-zero impact on the management of business
itself.</p>
<p>Top management’s frustration with the data that information
technology has so far provided has triggered the new, the next,
Information Revolution. Information technologists, especially chief
information officers in businesses, soon realized that the accounting
data are not what their associates need—which largely explains why MIS
and IT people tend to be contemptuous of accounting and accountants. But
they did not, as a rule, realize that what was needed was not more data,
more technology, more speed. What was needed was to define information;
what was needed was new concepts. And in one enterprise after another,
top management people during the last few years have begun to ask, “What
information concepts do we need for our tasks?” And they have now begun
to demand them of their traditional information providers, the
accounting people.</p>
<p>The new accounting that is evolving as a result of these questions
will be discussed in a later section of this chapter (“The Information
Enterprises Need”). And so is the one new area—and the most important
one—in which we do not as yet have systematic and organized methods for
obtaining information: information on the OUTSIDE of the enterprise.
These new methods are very different in their assumptions and their
origins. Each was developed independently and by different people. But
they all have two things in common. They aim at providing information
rather than data. And they are designed for top management and to
provide information for top management tasks and top management
decisions.</p>
<p>The new Information Revolution began in business and has gone
farthest in it. But it is about to revolutionize education and health
care. Again, the changes in concepts will in the end be at least as
important as the changes in tools and technology. It is generally
accepted now that education technology is due for profound changes and
that with them will come profound changes in structure. Long-distance
learning, for instance, may well make obsolete within twenty-five years
that uniquely American institution, the freestanding undergraduate
college. It is becoming clearer every day that these technical changes
will—indeed must—lead to redefining what is meant by education. One
probable consequence: The center of gravity in higher education (i.e.,
postsecondary teaching and learning) may shift to the continuing
professional education of adults during their entire working lives.
This, in turn, is likely to move learning off campus and into a lot of
new places: the home, the car or the commuter train, the workplace, the
church basement or the school auditorium where small groups can meet
after hours.</p>
<p>In health care a similar conceptual shift is likely to lead from
health care being defined as the fight against disease to being defined
as the maintenance of physical and mental functioning. The fight against
disease remains an important part of medical care, of course, but as
what a logician would call a subset of it. Neither of the traditional
health care providers, the hospital and the general practice physician,
may survive this change, and certainly not in their present form and
function.</p>
<p>In education and health care, the emphasis thus will also shift from
the “T” in IT to the “I,” as it is shifting in business.</p>
<p>The Lessons of History</p>
<p>The current Information Revolution is actually the fourth Information
Revolution in human history. The first one was the invention of writing
five thousand to six thousand years ago in Mesopotamia;
then—independently but several thousand years later—in China; and some
fifteen hundred years later still, by the Maya in Central America. The
second Information Revolution was brought on by the invention of the
written book, first in China, perhaps as early as 1300 B.C., and then,
independently, eight hundred years later, in Greece, when Peisistratos,
the tyrant of Athens, had Homer’s epics—only recited until then—copied
into books. The third Information Revolution was set off by Gutenberg’s
invention of the printing press and of movable type between 1450 and
1455, and by the contemporaneous invention of engraving. We have almost
no documents on the first two of these revolutions, though we know that
the impact of the written book was enormous in Greece and Rome as well
as in China. In fact, China’s entire civilization and system of
government still rest on it. But on the third Information Revolution,
printing and engraving, we have abundant material. Is there anything we
can learn today from what happened five hundred years ago?</p>
<p>The first thing to learn is a little humility.</p>
<p>Everybody today believes that the present Information Revolution is
unprecedented in reducing the cost of, and in the spreading of,
information—whether measured by the cost of a “byte” or by computer
ownership—and in the speed and sweep of its impact. These beliefs are
simply nonsense.</p>
<p>At the time Gutenberg introduced the press, there was a substantial
information industry in Europe. It was probably Europe’s biggest
employer. It consisted of hundreds of monasteries, many of which housed
large numbers of highly skilled monks. Each monk labored from dawn to
dusk, six days a week, copying books by hand. An industrious,
well-trained monk could do four pages a day, or twenty-five pages during
a six-day week, for an annual output of twelve hundred to thirteen
hundred handwritten pages.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, by 1500, the monks had become unemployed. These
monks (some estimates go well above ten thousand for all of Europe) had
been replaced by a very small number of lay craftsmen, the new
“printers,” totaling perhaps one thousand, but spread over all of Europe
(though only beginning to establish themselves in Scandinavia). To
produce a printed book required coordinated teamwork by up to twenty
such craftsmen, beginning with one highly skilled cutter of type, to a
much larger number, maybe ten or more, of much less skilled bookbinders.
Such a team produced each year about twenty-five titles, with an average
of two hundred pages per title, or five thousand pages ready to be
printed. By 1505, print runs of one thousand copies became possible.
This meant that a printing team could produce annually at least 5
million printed pages, bound into 25,000 books ready to be sold—or
250,000 pages per team member as against the twelve hundred or thirteen
hundred the individual monk had produced only fifty years earlier.</p>
<p>Prices fell dramatically. As late as the mid-1400s—just before
Gutenberg’s invention—books were such a luxury that only the wealthy and
educated could afford them. But when Martin Luther’s German Bible came
out in 1522 (a book of well over one thousand pages), its price was so
low that even the poorest peasant family could buy one.</p>
<p>The cost and price reductions of the third Information Revolution
were at least as great as those of the present, the fourth Information
Revolution. And so were the speed and the extent of its spread.</p>
<p>This has been just as true of every other major technological
revolution. Though cotton was by far the most desirable of all textile
fibers—it is easily washable and can be worked up into an infinite
variety of different cloths—it required a time- and labor-expensive
process. It took twelve to fourteen man-days to produce a pound of
cotton yarn by hand, as against one to two man-days for wool, two to
five for linen and six for silk. Between 1764, when machine tools to
work cotton were first introduced—triggering the Industrial
Revolution—and 1784, the time needed to produce a pound of cotton yarn
fell to a few hours. (This interval, incidentally, is exactly the same
as that between the ENIAC and IBM’s 360.) The price dropped by 70
percent and production rose twenty-five-fold. Yet this was still before
Eli Whitney’s cotton gin (1793), which produced a further fall in the
price of cotton yarn of 90 percent-plus and ultimately to about a
thousandth of what it had been before the Industrial Revolution of fifty
or sixty years earlier.</p>
<p>Just as important as the reduction in costs and the speed of the new
printing technology was its impact on what information meant. The first
printed books, beginning with Gutenberg’s Bible, were in Latin and still
had the same topics as the books that the monks had earlier written out
by hand: religious and philosophical treatises and whatever texts had
survived from Latin antiquity. But only twenty years after Gutenberg’s
invention, books by contemporary authors began to emerge, though they
still appeared in Latin. Another ten years and books were printed not
only in Greek and Hebrew but also, increasingly, in the vernacular
(first in English, then in the other European tongues). And in 1476,
only twenty years after Gutenberg, the English printer William Caxton
(1422–1491) published a book on so worldly a subject as chess. By 1500,
popular literature no longer meant verse—epics, especially—that lent
themselves to oral transmission, but prose, that is, the printed
book.</p>
<p>In no time at all, the printing revolution also changed institutions,
including the educational system. In the decades that followed,
university after university was founded throughout Europe, but unlike
the earlier ones, they weren’t designed for the clergy or for the study
of theology. They were built around disciplines for the laity: law,
medicine, mathematics, natural philosophy (science). And
eventually—though it took two hundred years—the printed book created
universal education and the present school.</p>
<p>Printing’s greatest impact, however, was on the core of pre-Gutenberg
Europe: the church. Printing made the Protestant Reformation possible.
Its predecessors, the reformations of John Wycliffe in England
(1330–1384) and of Jan Hus in Bohemia (1372–1415), had met with an
equally enthusiastic popular response. But those revolts could not
travel farther or faster than the spoken word and could thus be
localized and suppressed. This was not the case when Luther, on October
31, 1517, nailed his ninety-five theses on a church door in an obscure
German town. He had intended only to initiate a traditional theological
debate within the church. But without Luther’s consent (and probably
without his knowledge), the theses were immediately printed and
distributed gratis all over Germany, and then all over Europe. These
printed leaflets ignited the religious firestorm that turned into the
Reformation.</p>
<p>Would there have been an age of discovery, beginning in the second
half of the 15th century, without the printing press? Printing
publicized every single advance the Portuguese seafarers made along the
west coast of Africa in their search for a sea route to the Indies.
Printing provided Columbus with the first (though totally wrong) maps of
the fabled lands beyond the western horizon, such as Marco Polo’s China
and the legendary Japan. Printing made it possible to record the results
of every single voyage immediately and to create new, more reliable
maps.</p>
<p>Noneconomic changes cannot be quantified. But the impact on society,
education, culture—let alone on religion—of the printing revolution was
easily as great and surely as fast as the impact of the present
Information Revolution, if not faster.</p>
<p>History’s Lesson for the Technologists</p>
<p>The last Information Revolution, the printed book, may also have a
lesson for today’s information technologists, the IT and MIS people and
the CIOs: They will not disappear. But they may be about to become
“Supporting Cast” rather than the “Superstars” they have been the last
forty years.</p>
<p>The printing revolution immediately created a new class of
information technologists, just as the most recent Information
Revolution has created any number of information businesses, MIS and IT
specialists, software designers and chief information officers. The IT
people of the printing revolution were the early printers.
Nonexistent—and indeed not even imaginable—in 1455, they had become
stars twenty-five years later. These virtuosi of the printing press were
known and revered all over Europe, just as the names of the leading
computer and software firms are recognized and admired worldwide today.
Printers were courted by kings, princes, the Pope and rich merchant
cities and were showered with money and honors.</p>
<p>The first of these tycoons was the famous Venetian printer Aldus
Manutius (1449–1515). He realized that the new printing press could make
a large number of impressions from the same plate—a thousand by the year
1505. He created the low-cost, mass-produced book. Aldus Manutius
created the printing industry: He was the first to extend printing to
languages other than Latin and also the first to do books by
contemporary authors. Altogether his press turned out well over one
thousand titles.</p>
<p>The last of these great printing technologists, and also the last of
the printing princes, was Christophe Plantin (1520–1589) of Antwerp.
Starting as a humble apprentice binder, he built Europe’s biggest and
most famous printing firm. By marrying the two new technologies,
printing and engraving, he created the illustrated book. He became
Antwerp’s leading patrician (Antwerp was then one of the richest cities
in Europe, if not the world), and he became so wealthy that he was able
to build himself a magnificent palace, still preserved today as a
printing museum. But Plantin and his printing house began to decline
well before his death and soon faded into insignificance.</p>
<p>By 1580 or so, the printers, with their focus on technology, had
become ordinary craftsmen, respectable tradesmen to be sure, but
definitely no longer of the upper class. And they had also ceased both
to be more profitable than other trades and to attract investment
capital. Their place was soon taken by what we now call publishers
(though the term wasn’t coined until much later), people and firms whose
focus was no longer on the “T” in IT but on the “I.”</p>
<p>This shift got under way the moment the new technology began to have
an impact on the MEANING of information, and with it, on the meaning and
function of the 15th century’s key institutions such as the church and
the universities. It thus began at the same juncture at which we now
find ourselves in the present Information Revolution. Is this where
Information Technology and Information Technologists are now?</p>
<p>The New Print Revolution</p>
<p>There is actually no reason to believe that the new Information
Revolution has to be “high-tech” at all. For we did have a real
“Information Revolution” these last fifty years, from 1950 on. But it is
not based on computers and electronics. The real boom—and it has been a
veritable boom—has been in that old “no-tech” medium, PRINT.</p>
<p>In 1950 when television first swept the country, it was widely
believed that it would be the end of the printed book. U.S. population
since has grown by two-thirds. The number of college and university
students—the most concentrated group of users and buyers of books—has
increased five-fold. But the number of printed books published and
bought in the U.S. has grown at least fifteen-fold, and probably closer
to twenty-fold.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the leading “high-tech” companies—IBM
in the sixties and seventies, Microsoft since 1980—have been the
fastest-growing businesses in the post-World War II period. But the
world’s two leading print companies have grown at least as fast. One is
the German-based Bertelsmann Group. A small publisher of Protestant
prayer books before Hitler, Bertelsmann was suppressed by the Nazis. It
was revived after World War II by the founder’s grandson, Reinhard Mohn.
Still privately held, Bertelsmann publishes no sales or profit figures.
But it is now the world’s number one publisher and distributor of
printed materials (other than daily papers) in most countries of the
world (except in China and Russia), through its ownership of publishing
firms (e.g., of Random House in the United States), of book clubs and of
magazines (e.g., of France’s leading business magazine Capital). Equally
fast has been the growth of the empire of the Australian-born Rupert
Murdoch. Starting as publisher of two small provincial Australian daily
papers, Murdoch now owns newspapers throughout the English-speaking
world, leading English-language book publishers and magazines—but also a
large company in another precomputer “information medium,” the
movies.</p>
<p>Even faster than the growth of these BOOK publishers has been the
growth of another PRINT medium: the “specialty mass magazine.” A good
many of the huge-circulation “general magazines” that dominated 1920s
and 1930s America, Life, for instance, or The Saturday Evening Post,
have disappeared. They did indeed fall victim to television. But there
are in the United States now several THOUSAND—one estimate is more than
THREE THOUSAND—specialty mass magazines, each with a circulation between
fifty thousand and a million, and most highly profitable.</p>
<p>The most visible examples are magazines that cover business or the
economy. The three leading American magazines of this type, Business
Week (a weekly), Fortune (a biweekly), and Forbes (a monthly), each have
a circulation approaching 1 million. Before World War II the
London-based Economist—the world’s only magazine that systematically
reports every week on economics, politics and business all the world
over—was practically unknown outside the UK, and even there its
circulation was quite small, well below one hundred thousand copies. Now
its U.S. circulation alone exceeds three hundred thousand copies a
week.</p>
<p>But there are similar specialty mass-circulation magazines in every
field and for every interest—in health care and in running symphony
orchestras, in psychology and in foreign affairs, in architecture and
home maintenance and computers and, above all, for every single
profession, every single trade, every single industry. One of the most
successful—and one of the earliest ones—is Scientific American, a U.S.
monthly founded (or rather refounded) in the late 1940s, in which
distinguished scientists explain their own specialized scientific area
to the “scientific laity,” that is, to scientists in other
specialties.</p>
<p>And what explains the success of the PRINT media?</p>
<p>College students probably account for the largest single share of the
growth of printed books in the United States. It is growth in college
texts and in books assigned by college teachers. But the second largest
group are books that did not exist before the 1950s, at least not in any
quantity. There is no English word for them. But the German publisher
who first saw their potential and first founded a publishing house
expressly to publish such books, the late E. B. von Wehrenalp (who
founded Econ Verlag in Dusseldorf—still my German publisher), called it
the Sachbuch—a book written by an expert for nonexperts. And when asked
to explain the Sachbuch Wehrenalp said: “It has to be enjoyable reading.
It has to be educational. But its purpose is neither entertainment nor
education. Its purpose is INFORMATION.”</p>
<p>This is just as true of the specialty mass magazines—whether written
for the layman who wants to know about medicine or for the plumber who
wants to know what goes on in the plumbing business. THEY INFORM. And
above all, they inform about the OUTSIDE. The specialty mass magazine
tells the reader in a profession, a trade, an industry what goes on
outside his or her own business, shop or office—about the competition,
about new products and new technology, about developments in other
countries and above all, about people in the profession, the trade, the
industry (and gossip has always had the highest information—or
misinformation—quotient of all communication).</p>
<p>And now the printed media are taking over the electronic channels.
The fastest-growing book seller since Aldus Manutius five hundred years
ago has been Amazon.com, which sells printed books over the Internet. In
a few very short years it may have become the Internet’s largest retail
merchant. And Bertelsmann, in the fall of 1998, bought a controlling 50
percent in Barnes andandandand Noble, Amazon’s main competitor. More and
more of the specialty mass magazines now publish an “on-line”
edition—delivered over the Internet to be printed out by the subscriber.
Instead of IT replacing print, print is taking over the electronic
technology as a distribution channel for PRINTED INFORMATION.</p>
<p>The new distribution channel will surely change the printed book. New
distribution channels always do change what they distribute. But however
delivered or stored, it will remain a printed product. And it will still
provide information.</p>
<p>The market for information exists, in other words. And, though still
disorganized, so does the supply. In the next few years—surely not much
more than a decade or two—the two will converge. And that will be the
REAL NEW INFORMA-TION REVOLUTION—led not by IT people, but by
accountants and publishers. And then both enterprises and individuals
will have to learn what information they need and how to get it. THEY
WILL HAVE TO LEARN TO ORGANIZE INFORMATION AS THEIR KEY RESOURCE.</p>
<p>II The Information Enterprises Need</p>
<p>We are just beginning to understand how to use information as a tool.
But we already can outline the major parts of the information system
enterprises need. In turn, we can begin to understand the concepts
likely to underlie the enterprise that executives will have to manage
tomorrow.</p>
<p>From Cost Accounting to Result Control</p>
<p>We may have gone furthest in redesigning both enterprise and
information in the most traditional of our information systems:
accounting. In fact, many businesses have already shifted from
traditional cost accounting to activity-based costing. It was first
developed for manufacturing where it is now in wide use. But it is
rapidly spreading to service businesses and even to nonbusinesses, for
example, universities. Activity-based costing represents both a
different concept of the business process and different ways of
measuring.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting, first developed by General Motors
seventy years ago, postulates that total manufacturing cost is the sum
of the costs of individual operations. Yet the cost that matters for
competitiveness and profitability is the cost of the total process, and
that is what the new activity-based costing records and makes
manageable. Its basic premise is that business is an integrated process
that starts when supplies, materials and parts arrive at the plant’s
loading dock and continues even after the finished product reaches the
end-user. Service is still a cost of the product, and so is
installation, even if the customer pays.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting measures what it costs to do something,
for example, to cut a screw thread. Activity-based costing also records
the cost of not doing, such as the cost of machine downtime, the cost of
waiting for a needed part or tool, the cost of inventory waiting to be
shipped and the cost of reworking or scrapping a defective part. The
costs of not doing, which traditional cost accounting cannot and does
not record, often equal and sometimes even exceed the cost of doing.
Activity-based costing therefore gives not only much better cost
control; increasingly, it gives result control.</p>
<p>Traditional cost accounting assumes that a certain operation—for
example, heat treating—has to be done and that it has to be done where
it is being done now. Activity-based costing asks, “Does it have to be
done? If so, where is it best done?” Activity-based costing integrates
what were once several procedures—value analysis, process analysis,
quality management and costing—into one analysis.</p>
<p>Using that approach, activity-based costing can substantially lower
manufacturing costs—in some instances by a full third. Its greatest
impact, however, is likely to be in services. In most manufacturing
companies, cost accounting is inadequate. But service industries—banks,
retail stores, hospitals, schools, news-papers and radio and television
stations—have practically no cost information at all. Activity-based
costing shows why traditional cost accounting has not worked for service
companies. It is not because the techniques are wrong. It is because
traditional cost accounting makes the wrong assumptions. Service
companies cannot start with the cost of individual operations, as
manufacturing companies have done with traditional cost accounting. They
must start with the assumption that there is only one cost: that of the
total system. And it is a fixed cost over any given time period. The
famous distinction between fixed and variable costs, on which
traditional cost accounting is based, does not make sense in services.
Neither does another basic assumption of traditional cost accounting:
that capital can be substituted for labor. In fact, in knowledge-based
work especially, additional capital investment is likely to require more
rather than less labor. A hospital that buys a new diagnostic tool will
not lay off anybody as a result. But it will have to add four or five
people to run the new equipment. Other knowledge-based organizations
have had to learn the same lesson. But that all costs are fixed over a
given time period and that resources cannot be substituted for each
other are precisely the assumptions with which activity-based costing
starts. By applying them to services, we are beginning for the first
time to get cost information and control.</p>
<p>Banks, for instance, have been trying for several decades to apply
conventional cost-accounting techniques to their business—that is, to
figure the costs of individual operations and services—with almost
negligible results. Now they are beginning to ask, “Which one activity
is at the center of costs and of results?” One answer: the customer. The
cost per customer in any major area of banking is a fixed cost. Thus it
is the yield per customer—both the volume of services a customer uses
and the mix of those services—that determines costs and profitability.
Retail discounters, especially those in Western Europe, have known that
for some time. They assume that once shelf space is installed, its cost
is fixed, and management consists of maximizing the yield on the space
over a given time span. This focus on result control has enabled these
discounters to increase profitability despite their low prices and low
margins.</p>
<p>In some areas, such as research labs, where productivity is difficult
to measure, we may always have to rely on assessment and judgment rather
than on costing. But for most knowledge-based and service work, we
should, within ten years, have developed reliable tools to measure and
manage costs and to relate those costs to results.</p>
<p>Thinking more clearly about costing in services should yield new
insights into the costs of getting and keeping customers in businesses
of all kinds.</p>
<p>If GM, Ford and Chrysler in the United States had used activity-based
costing, for example, they would have realized early on the utter
futility of their competitive “blitzes” of the past twenty years, which
offered new-car buyers spectacular discounts and hefty cash rewards.
Those promotions actually cost the Big Three automakers enormous amounts
of money and, worse, enormous numbers of customers. In fact, every one
resulted in a nasty drop in market standing. But neither the costs of
the special deals nor their negative yields appeared in the companies’
conventional cost-accounting figures, so management never saw the
damage.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese used a form of activity-based costing—though a
fairly primitive one—Toyota, Nissan and Honda knew better than to
compete with the U.S. automakers through discount blitzes, and thus
maintained both their market share and their profits.</p>
<p>From Legal Fiction to Economic Reality</p>
<p>Knowing the cost of operations, however, is not enough. To compete
successfully in an increasingly competitive global market, a company has
to know the costs of its entire economic chain and has to work with
other members of the chain to manage costs and maximize yield. Companies
are therefore beginning to shift from costing only what goes on inside
their own organizations to costing the entire economic process, in which
even the biggest company is just one link.</p>
<p>The legal entity, the company, is a reality for shareholders, for
creditors, for employees, and for tax collectors. But economically, it
is fiction.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago the Coca-Cola Company was a franchiser all over the
world. Independent bottlers manufactured the product. Now the company
owns most of its bottling operations in the United States. But Coke
drinkers—even those few who know that fact—could not care less.</p>
<p>What matters in the marketplace is the economic reality, the costs of
the entire process, regardless of who owns what.</p>
<p>Again and again in business history, an unknown company has come from
nowhere and in a few short years has overtaken the established leaders
without apparently even breathing hard. The explanation always given is
superior strategy, superior technology, superior marketing, or lean
manufacturing. But in every single case, the newcomer also enjoys a
tremendous cost advantage, usually about 30 percent. The reason is
always the same: the new company knows and manages the costs of the
entire economic chain rather than its costs alone.</p>
<p>Toyota is perhaps the best-publicized example of a company that knows
and manages the costs of its suppliers and distributors; they are all,
of course, members of its Keiretsu. Through that network, Toyota manages
the total cost of making, distributing and servicing its cars as one
cost stream, putting work where it costs the least and yields the most.
(On the history of the Keiretsu see Chapter One.)</p>
<p>Economists have known the importance of costing the entire economic
chain since Alfred Marshall wrote about it in the late 1890s. But most
business people still consider it theoretical abstraction. Increasingly,
however, managing the economic cost chain will become a necessity.
Indeed, executives need to organize and manage not only the cost chain
but also everything else—especially corporate strategy and product
planning—as one economic whole, regardless of the legal boundaries of
individual companies.</p>
<p>A powerful force driving companies toward economic chain costing will
be the shift from cost-led pricing to price-led costing. Traditionally,
Western companies have started with costs, put a desired profit margin
on top, and arrived at a price. They practiced cost-led pricing. Sears
and Marks andandandand Spencer long ago switched to price-led costing,
in which the price the customer is willing to pay determines allowable
costs, beginning with the design stage. Until recently, those companies
were the exceptions. Now price-led costing is becoming the rule.</p>
<p>The same ideas apply to outsourcing, alliances and joint
ventures—indeed, to any structure that is built on partnership rather
than control. And such entities, rather than the traditional model of a
parent company with wholly owned subsidiaries, are increasingly becoming
the models for growth, especially in the global economy. (On this see
Chapter One.)</p>
<p>For many businesses it will be painful to switch to economic-chain
costing. Doing so requires uniform or at least compatible accounting
systems of all companies along the entire chain. Yet each one does its
accounting in its own way, and each is convinced that its system is the
only possible one. Moreover, economic-chain costing requires information
sharing across companies; yet even within the same company, people tend
to resist information sharing.</p>
<p>Whatever the obstacles, economic-chain costing is going to be done.
Otherwise, even the most efficient company will suffer from an
increasing cost disadvantage.</p>
<p>Information for Wealth Creation</p>
<p>Enterprises are paid to create wealth, not to control costs. But that
obvious fact is not reflected in traditional measurements. First-year
accounting students are taught that the balance sheet portrays the
liquidation value of the enterprise and provides creditors with
worst-case information. But enterprises are not normally run to be
liquidated. They have to be managed as going concerns, that is, for
wealth creation.</p>
<p>To do that requires four sets of diagnostic tools: foundation
information, productivity information, competence information, and
resource allocation information. Together they constitute the
executive’s tool kit for managing the current business.</p>
<p>Foundation Information</p>
<p>The oldest and most widely used set of diagnostic management tools
are cash-flow and liquidity projections and such standard measurements
as the ratio between dealers’ inventories and sales of new cars, the
earnings coverage for interest payments on a bond issue, and the ratios
between receivables outstanding more than six months, total receivables,
and sales. Those may be likened to the measurements a doctor takes at a
routine physical: weight, pulse, temperature, blood pressure and
urinalysis. If those readings are normal, they do not tell us much. If
they are abnormal, they indicate a problem that needs to be identified
and treated. Those measurements might be called foundation
information.</p>
<p>Productivity Information</p>
<p>The second set of tools for business diagnosis deals with the
productivity of key resources. The oldest of them—of World War II
vintage—measures the productivity of manual labor. Now we are slowly
developing measurements though still quite primitive ones, for the
productivity of knowledge-based and service work (see Chapter Five).
However, measuring only the productivity of workers, whether blue- or
white-collar, no longer gives us adequate information about
productivity. We need data on total-factor productivity.</p>
<p>That explains the growing popularity of Economic Value-Added Analysis
(EVA). It is based on something we have known for a long time: What we
generally call profits, the money left to service equity, is not profit
at all and may be mostly a genuine cost. Until a business returns a
profit that is greater than its cost of capital, it operates at a loss.
Never mind that it pays taxes as if it had a genuine profit. The
enterprise still returns less to the economy than it uses up in
resources. It does not cover its full costs unless the reported profit
exceeds the cost of capital. Until then, it does not create wealth; it
destroys it. By that measurement, incidentally, few U.S. businesses have
been profitable since World War II.</p>
<p>By measuring the value added over all costs, including the cost of
capital, EVA measures, in effect, the productivity of all factors of
production. It does not, by itself, tell us why a certain product or a
certain service does not add value or what to do about it. But it shows
us what we need to find out and that we need to take action. EVA should
also be used to find out what works. It does show which products,
services, operations or activities have unusually high productivity and
add unusually high value. Then we should ask ourselves, “What can we
learn from these successes?”</p>
<p>The most recent of the tools used to obtain productivity information
is benchmarking—comparing one’s performance with the best performance in
the industry or, better yet, with the best anywhere in the world.
Benchmarking assumes correctly that what one organization does, any
other organization can do as well. It assumes correctly that any
business has to be globally competitive (see Chapter Two). It assumes,
also correctly, that being at least as good as the leader is a
prerequisite to being competitive. Together, EVA and benchmarking
provide the diagnostic tools to measure total-factor productivity and to
manage it.</p>
<p>Competence Information</p>
<p>A third set of tools deals with competences. Leadership rests on
being able to do something others cannot do at all or find difficult to
do even poorly. It rests on core competencies that meld market or
customer value with a special ability of the producer or supplier.</p>
<p>Some examples: the ability of the Japanese to miniaturize electronic
components, which is based on their three-hundred-year-old artistic
tradition of putting landscape paintings on a tiny lacquered box, called
an inro, and of carving a whole zoo of animals on the even tinier
button, called a netsuke, that holds the box on the wearer’s belt; or
the almost unique ability GM has had for eighty years to make successful
acquisitions; or Marks andandandand Spencer’s also unique ability to
design packaged and ready-to-eat gourmet meals for middle-class purses.
But how does one identify both the core competencies one has already and
those the business needs to take and maintain a leadership position? How
does one find out whether one’s core competence is improving or
weakening? Or whether it is still the right core competence and what
changes it might need?</p>
<p>So far the discussion of core competencies has been largely
anecdotal. But a number of highly specialized, midsized companies—a
Swedish pharmaceutical producer and a U.S. producer of specialty tools,
to name two—are developing the methodology to measure and manage core
competencies.</p>
<p>The first step is to keep careful track of one’s own and one’s
competitors’ performance, looking especially for unexpected successes
and for unexpected poor performance in areas where one should have done
well. The successes demonstrate what the market values and will pay for.
They indicate where the business enjoys a leadership advantage. The
nonsuccesses should be viewed as the first indication either that the
market is changing or that the company’s competencies are weakening.</p>
<p>This analysis allows for the early recognition of opportunities.</p>
<p>By carefully tracking unexpected successes, a U.S. tool-maker found,
for example, that small Japanese machine shops were buying its
high-tech, high-priced tools, even though it had not designed the tools
with them in mind or ever offered these tools to them. That allowed the
company to recognize a new core competence: its products were easy to
maintain and to repair despite their technical complexity. When that
insight was applied to designing products, the company gained leadership
in the small-plant and machine-shop markets in the United States and
Western Europe, huge markets where it had done practically no business
before.</p>
<p>Core competencies are different for every organization; they are, so
to speak, part of an organization’s personality. But every
organization—not just businesses—needs one core competence: innovation.
And every organization needs a way to record and appraise its innovative
performance. In organizations already doing that—among them several
topflight pharmaceutical manufacturers—the starting point is not the
company’s own performance. It is a careful record of the innovations in
the entire field during a given period. Which of them were truly
successful? How many of them were ours? Is our performance commensurate
with our objectives? With the direction of the market? With our market
standing? With our research spending? Are our successful innovations in
the areas of greatest growth and opportunity? How many of the truly
important innovation opportunities did we miss? Why? Because we did not
see them? Or because we saw them but dismissed them? Or because we
botched them? And how well do we do in converting an innovation into a
commercial product? A good deal of that, admittedly, is assessment
rather than measurement. It raises rather than answers questions, but it
raises the right questions.</p>
<p>Resource Allocation Information</p>
<p>The last area in which diagnostic information is needed to manage the
current business for wealth creation is the allocation of scarce
resources: capital and performing people. Those two convert into action
all the information that a management has about its business. They
determine whether the enterprise will do well or poorly.</p>
<p>GM developed the first systematic capital-appropriations process
about seventy years ago. Today practically every business has a
capital-appropriations process, but few use it correctly. Companies
typically measure their proposed capital appropriations by only one or
two of the following yard-sticks: return on investment, payback period,
cash flow, or discounted present value. But we have known for a long
time—since the early 1930s—that none of those is the right method. To
understand a proposed investment, a company needs to look to all four.
Sixty years ago that would have required endless number-crunching. Now a
laptop computer can provide the data within a few minutes. We also have
known for sixty years that managers should never look at just one
proposed capital appropriation in isolation but should instead choose
the projects that show the best ratio between opportunity and risks.
That requires a capital-appropriations budget to display the
choices—again, something far too many businesses do not do.</p>
<p>Most serious, however, is that most capital-appropriations processes
do not even ask for two vital pieces of information:</p>
<p>• What will happen if the proposed investment fails to produce the
promised results, as do three out of every five? Would it seriously hurt
the company, or would it be just a fleabite?</p>
<p>• If the investment is successful—and especially if it is more
successful than we expect—what will it commit us to?</p>
<p>In addition, a capital-appropriations request requires specific
deadlines: When should we expect what results? Then the
results—successes, near successes, near failures, and failures—need to
be reported and analyzed. There is no better way to improve an
organization’s performance than to measure the results of capital
spending against the promises and expectations that led to its
authorization. How much better off would the United States be today had
such feedback on government programs been standard practice for the past
fifty years?</p>
<p>Capital, however, is only one key resource of the organization, and
it is by no means the scarcest one. The scarcest resources in any
organization are performing people.</p>
<p>Since World War II, the U.S. military—and so far no one else—has
learned to test its placement decisions. It now thinks through what it
expects of senior officers before it puts them into key commands. It
then appraises their performance against those expectations. And it
constantly appraises its own process for selecting senior commanders
against the successes and failures of its appointments.</p>
<p>In business—but in universities, hospitals and government agencies as
well—placement with specific expectations as to what the appointee
should achieve and systematic appraisal of the outcome are virtually
unknown. In the effort to create wealth, managers need to allocate human
resources as purposefully and as thoughtfully as they do capital. And
the outcomes of those decisions ought to be recorded and studied as
carefully.</p>
<p>Where the Results Are</p>
<p>Those four kinds of information tell us only about the current
business. They inform and direct tactics. For strategy, we need
organized information about the environment. Strategy has to be based on
information about markets, customers and noncustomers; about technology
in one’s own industry and others; about worldwide finance, and about the
changing world economy. For that is where the results are. Inside an
organization there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a
customer whose check has not bounced.</p>
<p>Major changes always start outside an organization. A retailer may
know a great deal about the people who shop at its stores. But no matter
how successful, no retailer ever has more than a small fraction of the
market as its customers; the great majority are noncustomers. It is
always with noncustomers that basic changes begin and become
significant. At least half the important new technologies that have
transformed an industry in the past fifty years came from outside the
industry itself. Commercial paper, which has revolutionized finance in
the United States, did not originate with the banks. Molecular biology
and genetic engineering were not developed by the pharmaceutical
industry. Though the great majority of businesses will continue to
operate only locally or regionally, they all face, at least potentially,
global competition from places they have never even heard of before.</p>
<p>Not all of the needed information about the outside is available, to
be sure, despite the specialty mass magazines. There is no
information—not even unreliable information—on economic conditions in
most of China, for instance, or on legal conditions in the successor
states to the Soviet empire. But even where information is readily
available, many businesses are oblivious to it. Many U.S. companies went
into Europe in the 1960s without even asking about labor legislation.
European companies have been just as blind and ill-informed in their
ventures into the United States. A major cause of the Japanese real
estate investment debacle in California during the 1990s was the failure
to find out elementary facts about zoning and taxes.</p>
<p>A serious cause of business failure is the common assumption that
conditions—taxes, social legislation, market preferences, distribution
channels, intellectual property rights and many others—must be what we
think they are or at least what we think they should be.</p>
<p>An adequate information system has to include information that makes
executives question that assumption. It must lead them to ask the right
questions, not just feed them the information they expect. That
presupposes first that executives know what information they need. It
demands further that they obtain that information on a regular basis. It
finally requires that they systematically integrate the information into
their decision making.</p>
<p>These are beginnings. These are first attempts to organize “Business
Intelligence,” that is, information about actual and potential
competitors worldwide. A few multinationals—Unilever, Coca-Cola, Nestlé,
some Japanese trading companies, and a few big construction
companies—have been working hard on building systems to gather and
organize outside information. But in general, the majority of
enterprises have yet to start the job. It is fast becoming the major
information challenge for all enterprises.</p>
<p>III The Information Executives Need for Their Work</p>
<p>A great deal of the new technology has been data processing equipment
for the individual. But as far as information goes, the attention has
been mainly on information for the enterprise—as it has been so far in
this chapter. But information for executives—and indeed, for all
knowledge workers—for their own work may be a great deal more important.
For the knowledge worker in general, and especially for executives,
information is their key resource. Information increasingly creates the
link to their fellow workers and to the organization, and their
“network.” It is information, in other words, that enables knowledge
workers to do their job.</p>
<p>By now it is clear that no one can provide the information that
knowledge workers and especially executives need, except knowledge
workers and executives themselves. But few executives so far have made
much of an effort to decide what they need, and even less, how to
organize it. They have tended to rely on the producers of data—IT people
and accountants—to make these decisions for them. But the producers of
data cannot possibly know what data the users need so that they become
information. Only individual knowledge workers, and especially
individual executives, can convert data into information. And only
individual knowledge workers, and especially individual executives, can
decide how to organize their information so that it becomes their key to
effective action.</p>
<p>To produce the information executives need for their work, they have
to begin with two questions:</p>
<p>“What information do I owe to the people with whom I work and on whom
I depend? In what form? And in what time frame?”</p>
<p>“What information do I need myself? From whom? In what form? And in
what time frame?”</p>
<p>These two questions are closely connected. But they are different.
What I owe comes first because it establishes communications. And unless
that has been established, there will be no information flow back to the
executive.</p>
<p>We have known this since Chester I. Barnard (1886–1961) published his
pioneering book The Functions of the Executive, in 1938, over sixty
years ago. Yet, while Barnard’s book is universally praised, it has had
little practical impact. Communication for Barnard was vague and
general. It was human relationships, and personal. However, what makes
communications effective at the workplace is that they are focused on
something outside the person. They have to be focused on a common task
and on a common challenge. They have to be focused on the work.</p>
<p>And by asking: “To whom do I owe information, so that they can do
their work?” communications are being focused on the common task and the
common work. They become effective. The first question therefore (as in
any effective relationship), is not: “What do I want and need?” It is:
“What do other people need from me?” and “Who are these other people?”
Only then can the question be asked: “What information do I need? From
whom? In what form? In what time frame?”</p>
<p>Executives who ask these questions will soon find that little of the
information they need comes out of their own company’s information
system. Some comes out of accounting—though in many cases the accounting
data has to be rethought, reformulated, rearranged to apply to the
executive’s own work. But a good deal of the information executives need
for their own work will come, as said already, from the outside and will
have to be organized quite separately and distinctly from the inside
information system.</p>
<p>The only one who can answer the question: “What do I owe by way of
information? To whom? In what form?” is the other person. The first step
in obtaining the information that executives need for their own work is,
therefore, to go to everyone with whom they work, everyone on whom they
depend, everyone who needs to know what they themselves are doing, and
ask them. But before one asks, one has to be prepared to answer. For the
other person will—and should—come back and ask: “And what information do
you need from me?” Hence, executives need first to think through both
questions—but then they start out by going to the other people and ask
them first to tell them: “What do I owe you?”</p>
<p>Both questions, “What do I owe?” and “What do I need?” sound
deceptively simple. But everyone who has asked them has soon found out
that it takes a lot of thought, a lot of experimentation, a lot of hard
work, to answer them. And the answers are not forever. In fact, these
questions have to be asked again, every eighteen months or so. They also
have to be asked every time there is a real change, for example, a
change in the enterprise’s theory of the business, in the individual’s
own job and assignment, or in the jobs and assignments of the other
people.</p>
<p>But if individuals ask these questions seriously, they will soon come
to understand both what they need and what they owe. And then they can
set about organizing both.</p>
<p>Organizing Information</p>
<p>Unless organized, information is still data. To be meaningful it has
to be organized. It is, however, not clear at all in what form certain
kinds of information are meaningful, and especially in what form of
organization they are meaningful for one’s own job. And the same
information may have to be organized in different ways for different
purposes.</p>
<p>Here is one example. Since Jack Welch took over as CEO in 1981, the
General Electric Company (GE) has created more wealth than any other
company in the world. One of the main factors in this success was that
GE organized the same information about the performance of every one of
its business units differently for different purposes. It kept
traditional financial and marketing reporting, the way most companies
appraise their businesses every year or so. But the same data were also
organized for long-range strategy, that is, to show unexpected successes
and unexpected failures, but also to show where actual events differed
substantially from what was expected. A third way to organize the same
data was to focus on the innovative performance of the business—which
became a major factor in determining compensation and bonuses of the
general manager and of the senior management people of a business unit.
Finally, the same data were organized to show how the business unit and
its management treated and developed people—which then became a key
factor in deciding on the promotion of an executive, and especially of
the general manager of a business unit.</p>
<p>No two executives, in my experience, organize the same information
the same way. And information has to be organized the way individual
executives work. But there are some basic methodologies to organize
information.</p>
<p>One is the Key Event. Which events—for it is usually more than
one—are the “hinges” on which the rest of my performance primarily
depends? The key event may be technological—the success of a research
project. It may have to do with people and their development. It may
have to do with establishing a new product or a new service with certain
key customers. It may be to obtain new customers. What is a key event is
very much the executive’s individual decision. It is, however, a
decision that needs to be discussed with the people on whom the
executive depends. It is perhaps the most important thing anybody in an
organization has to get across to the people with whom one works, and
especially to one’s own superior.</p>
<p>Another key methodological concept comes out of modern Probability
Theory—it is the concept on which, for instance, Total Quality
Management is based. It is the difference between normal fluctuations
within the range of normal probability distribution and the exceptional
event. As long as fluctuations stay within the normal distribution of
probability for a given type of event (e.g., for quality in a
manufacturing process), no action is taken. Such fluctuations are data
and not information. But the exception, which falls outside the accepted
probability distribution, is information. It calls for action.</p>
<p>Another basic methodology for organizing information comes out of the
theory of the Threshold Phenomenon—the theory that underlies Perception
Psychology. It was a German physicist, Gustav Fechner (1801–1887), who
first realized that we do not feel a sensation—for example, a
pinprick—until it reaches a certain intensity, that is, until it passes
a perception threshold. A great many phenomena follow the same law. They
are not actually “phenomena.” They are data until they reach a certain
intensity, and pass the perception threshold.</p>
<p>For many events, both in one’s work and in one’s personal life, this
theory applies and enables one to organize data into information. When
we speak of a “recession” in the economy, we speak of a threshold
phenomenon—a down-turn in sales and profits is a recession when it
passes a certain threshold, for example, when it continues beyond a
certain length of time. Similarly, a disease becomes an “epidemic” when,
in a certain population, it passes and exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
<p>This concept is particularly useful to organize information about
personnel events. Such events as accidents, turnover, grievances, and so
on become significant when they pass a certain threshold. But the same
is true of innovative performance in a company—except that there the
perception threshold is the point below which a drop in innovative
performance becomes relevant and calls for action. The threshold concept
is altogether one of the most useful concepts to determine when a
sequence of events becomes a “trend,” and requires attention and
probably action, and when events, even though they may look spectacular,
are by themselves not particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>Finally, a good many executives have found that the one way of
organizing information effectively is simply to organize one’s being
informed about the unusual.</p>
<p>One example is the “manager’s letter.” The people who work with a
manager write a monthly letter to him or her, reporting on anything
unusual and unexpected within their own sphere of work and action. Most
of these “unusual” things can safely be disregarded. But again, and
again, there is an “exceptional” event, one that is outside the normal
range of probability distribution. Again and again, there is a
concatenation of events—insignificant in each reporter’s area, but
significant if added together. Again and again, the management letters
bring out a pattern to which to pay attention. Again and again, they
convey information.</p>
<p>No Surprises</p>
<p>No system designed by knowledge workers, and especially by
executives, to give them the information they need for their work will
ever be perfect. But, over the years, they steadily improve. And the
ultimate test of an information system is that there are no surprises.
Before events become significant, executives have already adjusted to
them, analyzed them, understood them and taken appropriate action.</p>
<p>One example are the three or four—very few indeed—American financial
institutions that, in the late 1990s, were not surprised by the collapse
of mainland Asia. They had thought through what “information” means in
respect to Asian economies and Asian currencies. They had gradually
eliminated all the information they got from within their own
subsidiaries and affiliates in these countries—these, they had begun to
realize, were just “data.” Instead, they had begun to organize their
information about such things as the ratio between fixed investment and
portfolio investment in these countries, and the ratio between portfolio
investment (i.e., short-term borrowing) and the country’s balance of
payments and with it the amount available to service foreign short-term
debt. Long before these ratios turned so unfavorable as to make a panic
in mainland Asia inevitable, these executives had realized that it was
coming. They realized that they had to decide whether to pull out of
these countries for short-term growth, or to stay for very long-term—and
very risky—strategies. They had, in other words, realized what economic
data are meaningful in respect to emerging countries, had organized
them, had analyzed them and had interpreted them. They had turned the
data into information—and had decided what action to take long before
that action became necessary.</p>
<p>By contrast, the overwhelming majority of American, European and
Asian companies doing business on mainland Asia and/or investing in it
relied on what their own people in these countries reported to them.
This turned out not to be information at all—in fact it turned out to be
misinformation. But only those executives who had spent several years
asking the question “What information is meaningful in respect to our
doing business in Thailand or Indonesia?” were prepared.</p>
<p>And far too often the mere quantity of data is taken to mean
information—as if the heft of a big-city telephone book were to make it
unnecessary to know whom one wants to reach, what his or her name or
business is, and why one wants to talk to the person. Executives have to
learn two things: to ELIMINATE data that do not pertain to the
information they need; and to organize the data, to analyze, to
interpret—and then to focus the resulting information on ACTION. For the
purpose of information is not knowledge. It is being able to take the
right action.</p>
<p>Going Outside</p>
<p>The example of the companies from the developed countries being
surprised by the collapse of the emerging economies of mainland Asia
underline the importance of obtaining meaningful outside
information.</p>
<p>For the executive there is, in the end, only one way to get it: that
is to go, personally, on the outside. No matter how good the reports, no
matter how good the economic or financial theory underlying them,
nothing beats personal, direct observation, and in a form in which it is
truly outside observation.</p>
<p>English supermarket chains have again and again tried to establish
themselves in neighboring Ireland—with very little success. The leading
supermarket chain in Ireland is Super-Quinn, started and run by Fergal
Quinn. His secret is not better merchandise or lower prices. His secret
is that he and all of his company’s executives have to spend two days a
week outside their offices. One day is spent actually doing a job in a
supermarket, for example, by serving at a checkout counter or as manager
for perishable foods. And one day is spent in competitors’ stores
watching, listening, talking to the competitors’ employees and the
competitors’ customers.</p>
<p>The largest hospital supply company in the United States was built by
a chief executive officer who himself spent four weeks a year—two weeks
twice a year—taking the place of a salesman on vacation. He demanded
that all the company’s senior executives do the same. When the regular
salesman came back, the customer—for example, the nun who purchases
supplies for the Catholic hospital—always said, “What dumb cluck took
your place? He always asked why I buy things from other suppliers rather
than from you. He never was particularly interested in getting an order
for what you sell.” But this was precisely the point of the
exercise.</p>
<p>And it is a very old observation that few things improve the
performance of a physician as much as being a hospital patient for two
weeks.</p>
<p>Market research, focus groups and the like are highly valued, and
rightfully so. But still, they always focus on the company’s products.
They never focus on what the customer buys and is interested in. Only by
being a customer oneself, a salesman oneself, a patient oneself, can one
get true information about the outside. And even that information is of
course still limited to one’s customers and one’s noncustomers. What
other information about the outside do executives need, however, to do
their work? And how can they get it?</p>
<p>This is one reason, by the way, why being a volunteer in a nonprofit
agency—as discussed in Chapter Six—is important not only for preparing
oneself for the second half of one’s life. It is equally important as a
way to get outside information—which is information on how other people,
with other jobs, other backgrounds, other knowledges, other values and
other points of view see the world, act and react, and make their
decisions. For this reason also, the continuing education of already
successful adults will be increasingly important. For in that university
course, the forty-five-year-old, successful knowledge worker—business
executive, lawyer, university president, minister of a church and so
on—is forced to work with people of different backgrounds, and different
values. It is one way not only to update one’s knowledge but to obtain
what executives need: information about the outside.</p>
<p>In the long run, information about the outside may be the most
important information executives need to do their work. At the same
time, it is the one that still has to be organized. This information is
not only the foundation for right action. It is equally the foundation
for the challenges discussed in the next two chapters: the challenge of
Knowledge-Worker Productivity and the challenge of Managing Oneself.
Both rely heavily on the executives knowing what information they need
for their work and what information they owe to others, and on
systematically developing the methods that turn the chaos of data in the
universe into organized and focused information for the executive’s own
work and job.</p>
