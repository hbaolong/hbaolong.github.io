<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The most important, and indeed the truly unique, contribution of
management in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the
productivity of the MANUAL WORKER in manufacturing.</p>
<p>The most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st
century is similarly to increase the productivity of KNOWLEDGE WORK and
the KNOWLEDGE WORKER.</p>
<p>The most valuable assets of a 20th-century company were its
production equipment. The most valuable asset of a 21st-century
institution, whether business or nonbusiness, will be its knowledge
workers and their productivity.</p>
<p>I The Productivity of the Manual Worker</p>
<p>FIRST: a look where we are.</p>
<p>It was only a little over a hundred years ago that for the first time
an educated person actually looked at manual work and manual worker, and
then began to study both. Great poets, the Greek Hesiod (6th century
B.C.) and, five hundred years later, the Roman Virgil (at the end of the
first century B.C.), sang about the work of the farmer. Theirs are still
among the finest poems in any language. But neither the work they sang
about nor their farmers bear even the most remote resemblance to reality
or were meant to have any. Neither Hesiod nor Virgil ever held a sickle
in his hands, ever herded sheep or even looked at the people who did,
either. And when, nineteen hundred years after Virgil, Karl Marx
(1818–1883) came to write about manual work and manual workers, he too
never looked at either, nor had he ever as much as touched a machine.
The first man to do both, that is, to work as a manual worker and then
to study manual work, was Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915).</p>
<p>Throughout recorded history—and actually well before any history was
recorded—there have been, of course, steady advances in what we today
call “productivity” (the term itself is barely fifty years old). But
they were the result of new tools, of new methods, of new technology;
they were advances in what the economist calls “Capital.” There were few
advances throughout the ages in what the economist calls “Labor,” that
is, in the productivity of the worker. It was axiomatic through-out
history that workers could produce more only by working harder or by
working longer hours. The 19th-century economists disagreed as much
about most things as economists do today. But they all agreed—from David
Ricardo (1772–1823) through Karl Marx—that there are enormous
differences in skill between workers, but there are none in respect to
productivity other than between hard workers and lazy ones, or between
physically strong workers and weak ones. Productivity did not exist. It
still is an “extraneous factor” and not part of the equation in most
contemporary economic theory, for example, in Keynes, but also in that
of the Austrian School.</p>
<p>Within a decade after Taylor first looked at work and studied it, the
productivity of the manual worker began its unprecedented rise. Since
then it has been going up steadily at the rate of 3½ percent per annum
compound—which means it has been risen fifty-fold since Taylor. On this
achievement rests all the economic and social gains of the 20th century.
The productivity of the manual worker has created what we now call
“developed” economies. Before Taylor there was no such thing—all
economies were equally “underdeveloped.” An underdeveloped economy
today—or even an “emerging” one—is one that has not—or at least has not
yet—made the manual worker productive.</p>
<p>The Principles of Manual-Work Productivity</p>
<p>Taylor’s principles sound deceptively simple.</p>
<p>The first step in making the manual worker productive is to look at
the task and to analyze its constituent motions. The next step is to
record each motion, the physical effort it takes and the time it takes.
Then motions that are not needed can be eliminated—and whenever we have
looked at manual work we found that a great many of the traditionally
most hallowed procedures turn out to be waste and do not add anything.
Then each of the motions that remain as essential to obtaining the
finished product is set up so as to be done the simplest way, the
easiest way, the way that puts the least physical and mental strain on
the operator, the way it requires the least time. Then these motions are
put together again into a “job” that is in a logical sequence. Finally
the tools needed to do the motions are being redesigned. And whenever we
have looked at any job—no matter for how many thousands of years it has
been performed—we have found that the traditional tools are totally
wrong for the task. This was the case, for instance, with the shovel
used to carry sand in a foundry—the first task Taylor studied. It was
the wrong shape, it was the wrong size and it had the wrong handle. But
we found it to be equally true of the surgeon’s traditional tools.</p>
<p>Taylor’s principles sound obvious—effective methods always do. But it
took Taylor twenty years of experimentation to work them out.</p>
<p>Over these last hundred years there have been countless further
changes, revisions and refinements. The name by which the methodology
goes has changed too over the century. Taylor himself first called his
method “Task Analysis” or “Task Management.” Twenty years later it was
rechristened “Scientific Management.” Another twenty years later, after
the First World War, it came to be knows as “Industrial Engineering” in
the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan, and as
“Rationalization” in Germany.</p>
<p>To proclaim that one’s method “rejects” Taylor or “replaces” him is
almost standard “Public Relations.” For what made Taylor and his method
so powerful has also made them unpopular. What Taylor saw when he
actually looked at work violated everything poets and philosophers had
said about work from Hesiod and Virgil to Karl Marx. They all celebrated
“skill.” Taylor showed that in manual work there is no such thing. There
are only simple, repetitive motions. What makes them productive is
knowledge, that is, the way the simple, unskilled motions are put
together, organized and executed. In fact, Taylor was the first person
to apply knowledge to work.*</p>
<p>This also earned Taylor the undying enmity of the labor unions of his
time, all of which were craft unions and based on the mystique of craft
skill and their monopoly on it. Moreover, Taylor advocated—and this is
still anathema to a labor union—that workers be paid according to their
productivity, that is, for their output, rather than for their input,
for example, for hours worked. But Taylor’s definition of work as a
series of operations also largely explains his rejection by the people
who themselves do not do any manual work: the descendants of the poets
and philosophers of old, the Literati and Intellectuals. Taylor
destroyed the romance of work. Instead of a “noble skill” it becomes a
series of simple motions.</p>
<p>And yet every method during these last hundred years that has had the
slightest success in raising the productivity of manual workers—and with
it their real wages—has been based on Taylor’s principles, no matter how
loudly its protagonists proclaimed their differences with Taylor. This
is true of “work enlargement,” “work enrichment” and “job rotation”—all
of which use Taylor’s methods to lessen the worker’s fatigue and thereby
to increase the worker’s productivity. It is true of such extensions of
Taylor’s principles of task analysis and industrial engineering to the
entire manual work process as Henry Ford’s assembly line (developed
after 1914, when Taylor himself was already sick, old and retired). It
is just as true of the Japanese “Quality Circle,” of “Continuous
Improvement” (“Kaizen”), and of “Just-In-Time Delivery.”</p>
<p>The best example, however, is W. Edwards Deming’s (1900–1993) “Total
Quality Management.” What Deming did—and what makes Total Quality
Management effective—is to analyze and organize the job exactly the way
Taylor did. But then he added, around 1940, Quality Control based on a
statistical theory that was only developed ten years after Taylor’s
death. Finally, in the 1970s, Deming substituted closed-circuit
television and computer simulation for Taylor’s stop-watch and motion
photos. But Deming’s Quality Control Analysts are the spit and image of
Taylor’s Efficiency Engineers and function the same way.</p>
<p>Whatever his limitations and shortcomings—and he had many—no other
American, not even Henry Ford (1863–1947), has had anything like
Taylor’s impact. “Scientific Management” (and its successor, “Industrial
Engineering”) is the one American philosophy that has swept the
world—more so even than the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. In
the last century there has been only one worldwide philosophy that could
compete with Taylor’s: Marxism. And in the end, Taylor has triumphed
over Marx.</p>
<p>In the First World War Scientific Management swept through the United
States—together with Ford’s Taylor-based assembly line. In the twenties
Scientific Management swept through Western Europe and began to be
adopted in Japan.</p>
<p>In World War II both the German achievement and the American
achievement were squarely based on applying Taylor’s principles to
Training. The German General Staff, after having lost the First World
War, applied “Rationalization,” that is, Taylor’s Scientific Management,
to the job of the soldier and to military training. This enabled Hitler
to create a superb fighting machine in the six short years between his
coming to power and 1939. In the United States, the same principles were
applied to the training of an industrial workforce, first tentatively in
the First World War, and then, with full power, in WWII. This enabled
the Americans to outproduce the Germans, even though a larger proportion
of the U.S. than of the German male population was in uniform and thus
not in industrial production. And then training-based Scientific
Management gave the U.S. civilian workforce more than twice—if not three
times—the productivity of the workers in Hitler’s Germany and in
Hitler-dominated Europe. Scientific Management thus gave the United
States the capacity to outnumber both Germans and Japanese on the
battle-field and yet to outproduce both by several orders of
magnitude.</p>
<p>Economic development outside the Western world since 1950 has largely
been based on copying what the United States did in World War II, that
is, on applying Scientific Management to making the manual worker
productive. All earlier economic development had been based on
technological innovation—first in France in the 18th century, then in
Great Britain from 1760 until 1850 and finally in the new economic Great
Powers, Germany and the United States, in the second half of the 19th
century. The non-Western countries that developed after the Second World
War, beginning with Japan, eschewed technological innovation. Instead,
they imported the training that the United States had developed during
the Second World War based on Taylor’s principles, and used it to make
highly productive, almost overnight, a still largely unskilled and
preindustrial workforce. (In Japan, for instance, almost two-thirds of
the working population were still, in 1950, living on the land and
unskilled in any work except cultivating rice.) But, while highly
productive, this new workforce was still—for a decade or more—paid
preindustrial wages so that these countries—first Japan, then Korea,
then Taiwan and Singapore—could produce the same manufactured products
as the developed countries, but at a fraction of their labor costs.</p>
<p>The Future of Manual-Worker Productivity</p>
<p>Taylor’s approach was designed for manual work in manufacturing, and
at first applied only to it. But even within these traditional
limitations, it still has enormous scope. It is still going to be the
organizing principle in countries in which manual work, and especially
manual work in manufacturing, is the growth sector of society and
economy, that is, “Third World” countries with very large and still
growing numbers of young people with little education and little
skill.</p>
<p>But, as will be discussed a little later in this chapter, there is a
tremendous amount of knowledge work—including work requiring highly
advanced and thoroughly theoretical knowledge—that includes manual
operations. And the productivity of these operations also requires
Industrial Engineering.</p>
<p>Still, in developed countries, the central challenge is no longer to
make manual work productive—we know, after all, how to do it. The
central challenge will be to make knowledge workers productive.
Knowledge workers are rapidly becoming the largest single group in the
workforce of every developed country. They may already comprise
two-fifths of the U.S. workforce—and a still smaller but rapidly growing
proportion of the workforce of all other developed countries. It is on
their productivity, above all, that the future prosperity and indeed the
future survival of the developed economies will increasingly depend.</p>
<p>II What We Know About Knowledge-Worker Productivity</p>
<p>Work on the productivity of the knowledge worker has barely begun. In
terms of actual work on knowledge-worker productivity we are, in the
year 2000, roughly where we were in the year 1900, a century ago, in
terms of the productivity of the manual worker. But we already know
infinitely more about the productivity of the knowledge worker than we
did then about that of the manual worker. We even know a good many of
the answers. But we also know the challenges to which we do not yet know
the answers, and on which we need to go to work.</p>
<p>SIX major factors determine knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Knowledge-worker productivity demands that we ask the question:
“What is the task?”</p></li>
<li><p>It demands that we impose the responsibility for their
productivity on the individual knowledge workers themselves. Knowledge
workers have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task and
the responsibility of knowledge workers.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the
knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of the
knowledge worker.</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity of the knowledge worker is not—at least not
primarily—a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least as
important.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, knowledge-worker productivity requires that the
knowledge worker is both seen and treated as an “asset” rather than a
“cost.” It requires that knowledge workers want to work for the
organization in preference to all other opportunities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these requirements—except perhaps the last one—is almost the
exact opposite of what is needed to increase the productivity of the
manual worker.</p>
<p>In manual work quality also matters. But lack of quality is a
restraint. There has to be a certain minimum quality standard. The
achievement of Total Quality Management, that is, of the application of
20th-century Statistical Theory to manual work, is the ability to cut
(though not entirely to eliminate) production that falls below this
minimum standard.</p>
<p>But in most knowledge work, quality is not a minimum and a restraint.
Quality is the essence of the output. In judging the performance of a
teacher, we do not ask how many students there can be in his or her
class. We ask how many students learn anything—and that’s a quality
question. In appraising the performance of a medical laboratory, the
question of how many tests it can run through its machines is quite
secondary to the question of how many test results are valid and
reliable. And this is true even for the work of the file clerk.</p>
<p>Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at
obtaining quality—and not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum
quality. Only then can one ask: “What is the volume, the quantity of
work?”</p>
<p>This not only means that we approach the task of making productive
the knowledge worker from the quality of the work rather than the
quantity. It also means that we will have to learn to define
quality.</p>
<p>What Is the Task?</p>
<p>But the crucial question in knowledge-worker productivity is the
first one: WHAT IS THE TASK? It is also the one most at odds with
manual-worker productivity. In manual work the Key Question is always:
HOW SHOULD THE WORK BE DONE? In manual work the task is always given.
None of the people who work on manual-worker productivity ever asked:
“What is the manual worker supposed to do?’” Their only question was:
“How does the manual worker best do the job?”</p>
<p>This was just as true of Frederick W. Taylor’s Scientific Management
as it was true of the people at Sears Roebuck or the Ford Motor Company
who first designed the assembly line, and of W. Edwards Deming’s Total
Quality Control.</p>
<p>But in knowledge work the key question is: “What is the task?”</p>
<p>One reason for this is that knowledge work, unlike manual work, does
not program the worker. The worker on the auto-mobile assembly line who
puts on a wheel is programmed by the simultaneous arrival of the car’s
chassis on one line and of the wheel on the other line. The farmer who
plows a field in preparation for planting does not climb out of his
tractor to take a telephone call, to attend a meeting, or to write a
memo. What is to be done is always obvious in manual work.</p>
<p>But in knowledge work the task does not program the worker.</p>
<p>A major crisis in the hospital, for example, when a patient suddenly
goes into coma, does of course control the nurse’s task and programs
her. But otherwise, it is largely the nurse’s decision whether to spend
time at the patient’s bed or whether to spend time filling out papers.
Engineers are constantly being pulled off their task by having to write
a report or rewrite it, by being asked to attend a meeting and so on.
The job of the salesperson in the department store is to serve the
customer and to provide the merchandise the customer is interested in or
should become interested in. Instead the salesperson spends an enormous
amount of time on paperwork, on checking whether merchandise is in
stock, on checking when and how it can be delivered and so on—all things
that take salespeople away from the customer and do not add anything to
their productivity in doing what salespeople are being paid for, which
is to sell and to satisfy the customer.</p>
<p>The first requirement in tackling knowledge work is to find out what
the task is so as to make it possible to concentrate knowledge workers
on the task and to eliminate everything else—at least as far as it can
possibly be eliminated. But this then requires that the knowledge
workers themselves define what the task is or should be. And only the
knowledge workers themselves can do that.</p>
<p>Work on knowledge-worker productivity therefore begins with asking
the knowledge workers themselves:</p>
<p>What is your task? What should it be? What should you be expected to
contribute? and What hampers you in doing your task and should be
eliminated?</p>
<p>Knowledge workers themselves almost always have thought through these
questions and can answer them. Still, it then usually takes time and
hard work to restructure their jobs so that they can actually make the
contribution they are already being paid for. But asking the questions
and taking action on the answers usually doubles or triples
knowledge-worker productivity, and quite fast.</p>
<p>This was the result of questioning the nurses in a major hospital.
They were actually sharply divided as to what their task was, with one
group saying “patient care” and another one saying “satisfying the
physicians.” But they were in complete agreement on the things that made
them unproductive—they called them “chores”: paperwork, arranging
flowers, answering the phone calls of patients’ relatives, answering the
patients’ bells and so on. And all—or nearly all—of these could be
turned over to a nonnurse floor clerk, paid a fraction of a nurse’s pay.
The productivity of the nurses on the floor immediately more than
doubled, as measured by the time nurses spent at the patients’ beds.
Patient satisfaction more than doubled. And turnover of nurses, which
had been catastrophically high, almost disappeared—all within four
months.</p>
<p>And once the task has been defined, the next requirements can be
tackled—and will be tackled by the knowledge workers themselves.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>1 Knowledge workers’ responsibility for their own contribution—the
knowledge worker’s decision what he or she should be held accountable
for in terms of quality and quantity, in respect to time and in respect
to cost. Knowledge workers have to have autonomy, and that entails
responsibility.</p>
<p>2 Continuous innovation has to be built into the knowledge worker’s
job.</p>
<p>3 Continuous learning and continuous teaching have to be built into
the job.</p>
<p>These needs have already been discussed in Chapter Three. But one
central requirement of knowledge-worker productivity is then still left
to be satisfied. We have to answer the question:</p>
<p>What is quality?</p>
<p>In some knowledge work—and especially in some work requiring a high
degree of knowledge—we already measure quality. Surgeons, for instance,
are routinely measured, especially by their colleagues, by their success
rates in difficult and dangerous procedures, for example, by the
survival rates of their open-heart surgical patients or the full
recovery rates of their orthopedic-surgery patients. But by and large we
have, so far, mainly judgments rather than measures regarding the
quality of a great deal of knowledge work. The main trouble is, however,
not the difficulty of measuring quality. It is the difficulty—and more
particularly the sharp disagreements—in defining what the task is and
what it should be.</p>
<p>The best example I know is the American school. As everyone knows,
public schools in the American inner city have become disaster areas.
But next to them—in the same location and serving the same kind of
children—are private (mostly Christian) schools in which the kids behave
well and learn well. There is endless speculation to explain these
enormous quality differences. But a major reason is surely that the two
kinds of schools define their tasks differently. The typical public
school defines its task as “helping the underprivileged”; the typical
Christian school (and especially the parochial schools of the Catholic
church) define their task as “enabling those who want to learn, to
learn.” One therefore is governed by its scholastic failures, the other
one by its scholastic successes.</p>
<p>But similarly: There are two research departments of major
pharmaceutical companies that have totally different results because
they define their tasks differently. One sees its task as not having
failures, that is, in working steadily on fairly minor but predictable
improvements in existing products and for established markets. The other
one defines its task as producing “breakthroughs” and therefore courts
risks. Both are considered fairly successful—by themselves, by their own
top managements and by outside analysts. But each operates quite
differently and quite differently defines its own productivity and that
of its research scientists.</p>
<p>To define quality in knowledge work and to convert the definition
into knowledge-worker productivity is thus to a large extent a matter of
defining the task. It requires the difficult, risk-taking and always
controversial definition as to what “results” are for a given enterprise
and a given activity. We therefore actually know how to do it. Still,
the question is a totally new one for most organizations, and also for
most knowledge workers. And to answer it requires controversy, requires
dissent.</p>
<p>The Knowledge Worker as Capital Asset</p>
<p>In no other area is the difference greater between manual-worker
productivity and knowledge-worker productivity than in their respective
economics. Economic theory and most business practice sees manual
workers as a cost. To be productive, knowledge workers must be
considered a capital asset.</p>
<p>Costs need to be controlled and reduced. Assets need to be made to
grow.</p>
<p>In managing manual workers we learned fairly early that high
turnover, that is, losing workers, is very costly. The Ford Motor
Company, as is well known, increased the pay of skilled workers from 80
cents a day to a day in January, 1914. It did so because its turnover
had been so excessive as to make its labor costs prohibitively high; it
had to hire sixty thousand people a year to keep ten thousand. Even so,
everybody, including Henry Ford himself (who had at first been bitterly
opposed to this increase) was convinced that the higher wages would
greatly reduce the company’s profits. Instead, in the very first year,
profits almost doubled. Paid a day, practically no workers left—in fact,
the Ford Motor Company soon had a waiting list.</p>
<p>But, short of the costs of turnover, rehiring or retraining and so
on, the manual worker is still being seen as a cost. This is true even
in Japan, despite the emphasis on lifetime employment and on building a
“loyal,” permanent workforce. And short of the cost of turnover, the
management of people at work, based on millennia of work being almost
totally manual work, still assumes that with the exception of a few
highly skilled people one manual worker is like any other manual
worker.</p>
<p>This is definitely not true for knowledge work.</p>
<p>Employees who do manual work do not own the means of production. They
may, and often do, have a lot of valuable experience. But that
experience is valuable only at the place where they work. It is not
portable.</p>
<p>But knowledge workers own the means of production. It is the
knowledge between their ears. And it is a totally portable and enormous
capital asset. Because knowledge workers own their means of production,
they are mobile. Manual workers need the job much more than the job
needs them. It may still not be true for all knowledge workers that the
organization needs them more than they need the organization. But for
most of them it is a symbiotic relationship in which they need each
other in equal measure.</p>
<p>Management’s duty is to preserve the assets of the institution in its
care. What does this mean when the knowledge of the individual knowledge
worker becomes an asset and, in more and more cases, the main asset of
an institution? What does this mean for personnel policy? What is needed
to attract and to hold the highest-producing knowledge workers? What is
needed to increase their productivity and to convert their increased
productivity into performance capacity for the organization?</p>
<p>III The Technologists</p>
<p>So far we have discussed the productivity of knowledge workers doing
knowledge work. But a very large number of knowledge workers do both
knowledge work and manual work. I call them “technologists.”</p>
<p>This group includes people who apply knowledge of the highest
order.</p>
<p>Surgeons preparing for an operation to correct a brain aneurysm
before it produces a lethal brain hemorrhage spend hours in diagnosis
before they cut—and that requires specialized knowledge of the highest
order. And then again, during the surgery, an unexpected complication
may occur that calls for theoretical knowledge and judgment, both of the
very highest order. But the surgery itself is manual work—and manual
work consisting of repetitive manual operations in which the emphasis is
on speed, accuracy, uniformity. And these operations are studied,
organized, learned and practiced exactly like any manual work, that is,
by the same methods Taylor first developed for factory work.</p>
<p>But the technologist group also contains large numbers of people in
whose work knowledge is relatively subordinate—though it is always
crucial.</p>
<p>The file clerk’s job—and that of her computer-operator
successor—requires knowledge of the alphabet that no experience can
teach. This knowledge is a small part of an otherwise manual task. But
it is the foundation and absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>Technologists may be the single biggest group of knowledge workers.
They may also be the fastest-growing group. They include the great
majority of health care workers: lab technicians; rehabilitation
technicians; technicians in imaging such as X-ray, ultrasound,
magnetic-resonance imaging, and so on. They include dentists and all
dental support people. They include automobile mechanics and all kinds
of repair and installation people. In fact, the technologist may be the
true successor to the 19th- and 20th-century skilled workers.</p>
<p>Technologists are also the one group in which developed countries can
have a true and long-lasting competitive advantage.</p>
<p>When it comes to truly high knowledge, no country can any longer have
much of a lead, the way 19th-century Germany had through its university.
Among theoretical physicists, mathematicians, economic theorists and the
like, there is no “nationality.” And any country can, at fairly low
cost, train a substantial number of high-knowledge people. India, for
instance, despite her poverty, has been training fairly large numbers of
first-rate physicians and first-rate computer programmers. Similarly (as
discussed earlier in this chapter), there is no “nationality” in respect
to the productivity of manual labor. Training based on Scientific
Management has made all countries capable of attaining, overnight, the
manual-worker productivity of the most advanced country, industry or
company. Only in educating technologists can the developed countries
still have a meaningful competitive edge, and for some time to come.</p>
<p>The United States is the only country that has actually developed
this advantage—through its so far unique nationwide systems of community
colleges. The community college was actually designed (beginning in the
1920s) to educate technologists who have both the needed theoretical
knowledge and the manual skill. On this, I am convinced, rests both the
still huge productivity advantage of the American economy and the—so far
unique—American ability to create, almost overnight, new and different
industries.</p>
<p>Nothing quite like the American community college exists anywhere
else so far. The famous Japanese school system produces either people
prepared only for manual work or people prepared only for knowledge
work. Only in the year 2003 is the first Japanese institution devoted to
training technologists supposed to get started. Even more famous is the
German apprenticeship system. Started in the 1830s, it was one of the
main factors in Germany’s becoming the world’s leading manufacturer. But
it focused—and still focuses—primarily on manual skills and slights
theoretical knowledge. It is thus in danger of becoming rapidly
obsolete.</p>
<p>But these other developed countries should be expected to catch up
with the United States fairly fast. Other countries—“emerging ones” or
“Third World” ones—are, however, likely to be decades behind—in part
because educating technologists is expensive, in part because in these
countries people of knowledge still look down with disdain, if not with
contempt, on working with one’s hands. “That’s what we have servants
for,” is still their prevailing attitude. In developed countries,
however—and again foremost in the United States—more and more manual
workers are going to be technologists. In increasing knowledge-worker
productivity, increasing the productivity of the technologists therefore
deserves to be given high priority.</p>
<p>The job was actually done—more than seventy years ago—by the American
Telephone Company (ATandandandandT) for its technologists, the people
who install, maintain, replace telephones, whether in the home or in the
office.</p>
<p>By the early 1920s the technologists working outside the telephone
office and at the customer’s location had become a major cost center—and
at the same time a major cause of customer unhappiness and
dissatisfaction. It took about five years or so, from 1920 until 1925,
for ATandandandandT—which had by that time acquired a near monopoly on
providing telephone service in the United States and in parts of
Canada—to realize that the task was not installing, maintaining,
repairing and replacing telephones and telephone connections. The task
was to create a satisfied customer. It became fairly easy to organize
the job. It meant, first, that the technicians themselves had to define
what “satisfaction” meant. The results were standards that established
that every order for a new telephone or an additional telephone
connection would have to be satisfied within at most forty-eight hours,
and that every request for repair would have to be satisfied the same
day if made before noon, or by noon the following day. Then it became
clear that the individual service people—in those days all men, of
course—would have to be active participants in such decisions as whether
to have one person installing and replacing telephones, and another one
maintaining and repairing them, or whether the same people had to be
able to do all jobs—which in the end turned out to be the right answer.
These people had to be taught a very substantial amount of theoretical
knowledge—and in those days few of them had more than six years of
schooling. They had to understand how a telephone works. They had to
understand how a switch-board works. They had to understand how the
telephone system works. These people were not qualified engineers or
skilled craftsmen. But they had to know enough electronics to diagnose
unexpected problems and to be able to cope with them. Then they were
trained in the repetitive manual operation or in the “one right way,”
that is, through the methods of Scientific Management. And they made the
decisions, for example, where and how to connect the individual
telephone to the system, and what particular kind of telephone and
service would be the most suitable for a given home or a given office.
They had to become salesmen in addition to being servicemen.</p>
<p>Finally, the telephone company faced the problem of how to define
quality. The technologist had to work by himself. He could not be
supervised. He, therefore, had to define quality and had to deliver it.
It took several more years before that was answered. At first the
telephone company thought that this meant a sample check that had
supervisors go out and look at a sample—maybe every twentieth or
thirtieth job done by an individual service person—and check it for
quality. This very soon turned out to be the wrong way of doing the job,
annoying both servicemen and customers alike. Then the telephone company
defined quality as “no complaints”—and soon found out that only
extremely unhappy customers complained. It then had to redefine quality
as “positive customer satisfaction.” And this then meant in the end that
the serviceman himself controlled quality—for example, by calling up a
week or ten days after he had done a job and asking the customer whether
the work was satisfactory and whether there was anything more the
technician could possibly do to give the customer the best possible and
most satisfactory service.</p>
<p>I have intentionally gone into considerable detail in describing this
early example because it exemplifies the three elements for making
effective the worker who is both a knowledge worker and a manual
worker.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is, first, the answer to the question: “What is the
task?”—the key question in making every knowledge worker productive. As
the example of the Bell System shows, this is not an obvious answer. And
as the Bell System people learned, the only people who know the answer
to this are the technologists themselves. In fact, until they asked the
technologists, they floundered. But as soon as the technologists were
asked, the answer came back loud and clear: a satisfied
customer.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the technologists had to take full responsibility for giving
customer satisfaction, that is, for delivering quality. This then showed
what formal knowledge the technologist needed. And then, only then,
could the manual part of the job be organized for manual-worker
productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Above all, this example shows that technologists have to be
treated as knowledge workers. No matter how important the manual part of
their work—and it may take the bulk of their time, as it did in the case
of the ATandandandandT installers—the focus has to be on making the
technologist knowledgeable, responsible, productive as a knowledge
worker.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>IV KNOWLEDGE WORK AS A SYSTEM</p>
<p>Productivity of the knowledge worker will almost always require that
the work itself be restructured and be made part of a system.</p>
<p>One example is servicing expensive equipment, such as huge and
expensive earth-moving machines. Traditionally, this had been seen as
distinct and separate from the job of making and selling the machines.
But when the U.S. Caterpillar Company, the world’s largest producer of
such equipment, asked “What are we getting paid for?” the answer was,
“We are not getting paid for machinery. We are getting paid for what the
machinery does at the customer’s place of business. That means keeping
the equipment running, since even one hour during which the equipment is
out of operation may cost the customer far more than the equipment
itself.” In other words, the answer to “What is our business?” was
“Service.” This then led to a total restructuring of operations all the
way back to the factory, so that the customer can be guaranteed
continuing operations and immediate repairs or replacements. And the
service representative, usually a technologist, has become the true
“decision maker.”</p>
<p>Another example. A group of about twenty-five orthopedic surgeons in
a Midwestern U.S. city have organized themselves as a “system” to
produce highest-quality work: to use optimally the limited and expensive
resources of operating and recovery rooms; to use optimally the
supporting knowledge people such as anesthesiologists or surgical
nurses; to build in continuous learning and continuous innovation into
the work of the entire group and of every member thereof; and finally,
to minimize costs. Each of the surgeons retains full control of his or
her practice. He or she is fully responsible for obtaining and treating
the individual patient. Traditionally each surgeon schedules surgeries
early in the morning. Hence, operating rooms and recovery rooms are
standing empty most of the time. The group now schedules the use of
operating and recovery rooms for the entire group so that this scarce
and extremely expensive resource is used ten hours a day. The group, as
a group, decides on the standardization of tools and equipment so as to
obtain the highest quality at the lowest cost. Finally, the group has
also built quality control into its system. Every three months three
different surgeons are designated to scrutinize every operation done by
each of the members—the diagnosis, the surgery, the after-treatment.
They then sit down with the individual surgeons and discuss their
performance. They suggest where there is need for improvement. But they
also may recommend that a certain surgeon be asked to leave the group,
as his or her work is not satisfactory. And each year the quality
standards that these supervising committees apply are discussed with the
whole group and are raised, and often substantially. As a result this
group now does almost four times as much work as it did before. It has
cut the costs by 50 percent, half of it by cutting back on the waste of
operating and recovery rooms, half by standardizing tools and equipment.
And in such measurable areas as success rates in knee replacements or
shoulder replacements, or in recovery after sports injuries, it has
greatly improved its results.</p>
<p>What to do about knowledge-worker productivity is thus largely known.
So is how to do it.</p>
<p>But How to Begin?</p>
<p>Making knowledge workers productive requires changes in basic
attitude—whereas making the manual worker more productive only required
telling the worker how to do the job. And making knowledge workers
productive requires changes in attitude, not only on the part of the
individual knowledge worker but on the part of the whole organization.
It therefore has to be “piloted”—as any major change should be (on this
see Chapter Three). The first step is to find an area in the
organization or a group of knowledge workers who are receptive. The
orthopedic surgeons, for instance, first had their new ideas tried out
by four physicians—one an older man, three younger people—who had long
argued for radical changes. Then there is a need to work consistently,
patiently, and for a considerable length of uninterrupted time, in this
small area or with this small group. For the first attempts, even if
greeted with great enthusiasm, will almost certainly run into all kinds
of unexpected problems. It is only after the productivity of this small
group of knowledge workers has been substantially increased that the new
ways of doing the work can be extended to a larger area, if not to the
entire organization. And by then we will also have learned where the
main problems are; where, for example, resistance can be expected (e.g.,
from middle management), or what changes in task, organization,
measurements and attitudes are needed for full effectiveness. To try to
jump the pilot stage—and there is always pressure to do so—only means
that the mistakes become public, while the successes stay hidden. It
only means discrediting the entire enterprise. But if properly piloted,
we can already do a great deal to improve—and
drastically—knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<p>Knowledge-worker productivity is the biggest of the 21st-century
management challenges. In the developed countries it is their first
survival requirement. In no other way can the developed countries hope
to maintain themselves, let alone to maintain their leadership and their
standards of living.</p>
<p>In the last hundred years, that is, in the 20th century, this
leadership very largely depended on making the manual worker productive.
Any country, any industry, any business can do that today—using the
methods that the developed countries have worked out and put into
practice in the 120 years since Frederick Winslow Taylor first looked at
manual work. Anybody today, anyplace, can apply those policies to
training, to the organization of the work and to the productivity of
workers, even if they are barely literate, if not illiterate, and
totally unskilled.</p>
<p>Above all (as discussed in Chapter Two), the supply of young people
available for manual work will be rapidly shrinking in the developed
countries—in the West and in Japan very fast, in the United States
somewhat more slowly—whereas the supply of such people will still grow
fast in the emerging and developing countries, at least for another
thirty or forty years. The only possible advantage developed countries
can hope to have is in the supply of people prepared, educated and
trained for knowledge work. There, for another fifty years, the
developed countries can expect to have substantial advantages, both in
quality and in quantity. But whether this advantage will translate into
performance depends on the ability of the developed countries—and of
every industry in it, of every company in it, of every institution in
it—to raise the productivity of the knowledge worker and to raise it as
fast as the developed countries, in the last hundred years, have raised
the productivity of the manual worker.</p>
<p>The countries and the industries that have emerged as the leaders in
the last hundred years in the world are the countries and the industries
that have led in raising the productivity of the manual worker: the
United States first, Japan and Germany second. Fifty years from now—if
not much sooner—the leadership in the world economy will have moved to
the countries and to the industries that have most systematically and
most successfully raised knowledge-worker productivity.</p>
<p>V The Governance of the Corporation</p>
<p>What does the emergence of the knowledge worker and of
knowledge-worker productivity mean for the governance of the
corporation? What do they mean for the future and structure of the
economic system?</p>
<p>In the last ten or fifteen years pension funds and other
institutional investors became the main share owners of the equity
capital of publicly owned companies in all developed countries (as
discussed several times in this book). This has triggered in the United
States a furious debate on the governance of corporations (on this see
also Chapters One and Two). For with the emergence of pension funds and
mutual funds as the owners of publicly owned companies, power has
shifted to these new owners.</p>
<p>Similar shifts in both the definition of the purpose of economic
organizations such as the business corporation, and of their governance,
can be expected to occur in all developed countries.</p>
<p>But within a fairly short period of time, we will face the problem of
the governance of corporations again. We will have to redefine the
purpose of the employing organization and of its management as both,
satisfying the legal owners, such as share-holders, and satisfying the
owners of the human capital that gives the organization its
wealth-producing power, that is, satisfying the knowledge workers. For
increasingly the ability of organizations—and not only of businesses—to
survive will come to depend on their “comparative advantage” in making
the knowledge worker productive. And the ability to attract and hold the
best of the knowledge workers is the first and most fundamental
precondition.</p>
<p>Can this be measured, however? Or is it purely an “intangible”? This
will surely be a central problem—for management, for investors, for
capital markets. What does “Capitalism” mean when Knowledge
governs—rather than Money? And what do “Free Markets” mean when
knowledge workers—and no one else can “own” knowledge—are the true
assets? Knowledge workers can be neither bought nor sold. They do not
come with a merger or an acquisition. In fact, though the greatest
“value,” they have no “market value”—that means, of course, that they
are not an “asset” in any sense of the term.</p>
<p>These questions go far beyond the scope of this book—let alone far
beyond the author’s competence. But it is certain that the emergence of
the knowledge worker and of the knowledge worker’s productivity as key
questions will, within a few decades, bring about fundamental changes in
the very structure and nature of THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>For work in the oldest knowledge profession, that is, in medicine,
Taylor’s close contemporary, William Osler (1849–1919), did what Taylor
did and at the same time—in his 1892 book The Principles and Practice of
Medicine (arguably the best textbook since Euclid’s Geometry in the 3rd
century b.c.). Osler’s work has rightly been called the application of
Scientific Management to Medical Diagnosis. And, like Taylor, Osler
preached that there is no “skill,” there is only method.</li>
