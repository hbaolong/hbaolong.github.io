<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<p>By Will HuttonLinda Holbeche</p>
<p>PETER FERDINAND DRUCKER – IDEAS, IMPACT AND LEGACY</p>
<p>Peter Drucker is one of the greats. His sustained creativity over
nearly fifty years of reflection on management, organization and the
wider economy and society is almost unmatched. There is scarcely a
contemporary idea—whether the idea of the voluntary knowledge worker to
the importance of management itself—that was not prefigured in his
writing. Sometimes his enthusiasm ran away with him (we are not
strangers to that ourselves): it is not obvious that knowledge, for
example, is quite so short lived as he once declared (redundant in ten
minutes) and the belief that all the world’s problems can be reduced to
managerial solutions is surely overdoing it. But his overall legacy is
so outstanding that you have to pay homage—and acknowledge the extent of
one’s own personal debt.</p>
<p>He was the Enlightenment thinker par excellence. Drucker’s breadth of
vision is reflected in his many fields of inquiry: international law,
history, organizations, politics, ethics, aesthetics and the human
condition. His wide range of publications reflected his belief that
management is central to life, not just to business. He was a true
Renaissance man.</p>
<p>His prolific written output included three-dozen books (fifteen on
management) and hundreds of articles, carrying on writing into his 90s.
He launched his reputation as a management guru with The Practice of
Management (1954) which he reinforced by Managing for Results (1964),
both hugely influential texts. His writings divide almost equally
between management theory and technique and works of economic, political
and social analysis, such as The Age of Discontinuity (1969) which
pointed to the decline of Britain’s manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The free spirit</p>
<p>Drucker refused to play the academic game, declining to publish in
obscure journals. He was one of the first thinkers to write for
management audiences, translating theory into practice. He pioneered
courses on leadership in the 1950s and coined the term “followership”.
He argued that leaders should spend less time asking “what do I want?”
than “what is needed?” He also stated: “you cannot manage other people
unless you have learned to manage yourself”.</p>
<p>Consequently he was accused by academia of being a wilful generalist
and was never offered major roles in prestigious business schools or
universities. Instead he preferred to work for smaller universities less
hide-bound by academic dogma. Indeed, though he was Clarke Professor of
Social Science and Management at the independent Claremont Graduate
University his critique of much business school education would do
little to endear him to academic colleagues. He argued (in 2001) that
most management education, even at Claremont, is basically the same as
65 years ago and that what is needed is a rethink of the curriculum so
that students can relate themselves more fully to the universe of
knowledge such as psychology, economics etc. and that social skills in
particular are missing. He stated “we do a very poor job of teaching
writing, speaking and listening, the communication tools on which all
effectiveness in an organization depends” (BizEd, Nov/Dec 2001).</p>
<p>Major universities and funding bodies still have much to learn from
Drucker’s broader definition of what constitutes knowledge, especially
that which can be translated into valuable practice.</p>
<p>His scepticism about the role of business schools was reflected in
many of his later predictions about how work would develop. The heart of
business success would increasingly be via creativity and innovation,
and it was wrong to suggest that the right approach could be codified in
any business school course; thus the context for the slightly outlandish
claim that knowledge makes itself obsolete every ten minutes. Creativity
is always a response to the challenge of a particular circumstance—and
requires a degree of personal responsibility and willingness to
experiment. Too many business school graduates took refuge in the notion
of a predictable career delivered by the practice of acquired and never
changing competences and skills. That was organizational death. Rather
every manager had to possess an entrepreneurial understanding; the trick
of the leader was to find ways of inculcating such a culture and
motivating managers to flower within it—even when there might not be
immediate promotion opportunities.</p>
<p>The thought leader</p>
<p>Many of Drucker’s books have become classics of management
literature. Where Drucker led, others followed. The Age of Discontinuity
prefigured later books in the 1980s and 1990s on managing chaos and
disruptive change, anticipating in particular works by Handy (The Age of
Unreason), Pascale, Peters, Naisbitt (Megatrends) and others.</p>
<p>Throughout his management writing, Drucker’s emphasis was on the
effectiveness of managers—particularly in making good use of their human
resources—as the key to a productive and profitable organization. His
five basic principles of management have stood the test of time:</p>
<p>• Setting objectives (set out in Management: Tasks, Responsibilities,
Practices (1973)) which defines every aspect of managerial skills and is
regarded as a DIY business school course.</p>
<p>• Organizing.</p>
<p>• Motivating and communicating (though he has sometimes been
criticized for neglecting theories of motivation).</p>
<p>• Establishing measurements of performance.</p>
<p>• Developing people, including self.</p>
<p>He created some of the leading management theories of the 20th
century, including:</p>
<p>• Management by objectives (and by self-control). MBO emerged out of
Drucker’s work as consultant with General Electric and was later
developed further by Humble.</p>
<p>• Putting the customer first and ‘Stick to the knitting’ (later taken
up by Tom Peters).</p>
<p>• The role of the chief executive in corporate strategy.</p>
<p>• Structure follows strategy (Hammer and Champy’s approach to
re-engineering owes its roots to early work by Drucker).</p>
<p>Similarly, he identified 7 key elements of post-war management
development which continue to influence thinking and practice in
organizations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Scientific management of work as the key to
productivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Decentralization as a basic principle of organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel management as the orderly way of fitting people into
organization structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Manager development to provide for the needs of
tomorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Managerial accounting—use of analysis and information as the
foundation for firm decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-range planning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>He challenged conventional wisdom. One of the key ideas throughout
his writing is not to make assumptions about technology or markets, but
to “look at the world upside down” and “build organized abandonment into
your system”.</p>
<p>The soothsayer</p>
<p>Drucker’s ability to foresee and interpret trends was legendary. He
had remarkable prescience, anticipating by decades some of the major
changes in world economics and the impact of technology on the
workplace. In The Age of Discontinuity (1969) for instance he introduced
the concepts of the coming information economy and the “knowledge
worker”. We are both directors of The Work Foundation where we continue
to build on Drucker’s ideas in our multi-phased research into the nature
and effects of the Knowledge Economy.</p>
<p>His book The New Realities (1989) anticipated global changes
including the development of the transnational economy, the
democratization of the Soviet Republics, the changing ethos of the US
and the demands of the post-industrial, post-business society. He
believed that the imperative for growth inevitably pushes organizations
beyond their national borders in search of new markets and that the
world becomes interconnected by a series of cross-cutting trade
relationships in which the interests of managers outweigh the interests
of politicians.</p>
<p>In Post-Capitalist Society (1992) he examined the division of society
into knowledge and service workers and the economic and social
challenges involved. He recognized that workers would need to master
self-management, a discipline which he considered to be both challenging
and little researched. In his later writings he recognized the growing
power of pension funds and the narrow focus of other institutional
investors in late twentieth century capitalism.</p>
<p>Similarly, he recognized that (re-)privatization was likely to be a
feature of developed economies as the public becomes disillusioned with
governments’ inability to produce miracles. He advocated privatization
of all institutions, including universities, on the grounds that the
role of government was to govern, not to “do” and that the two roles
were incompatible. The insight was valuable, but limited; there remains
a quality of “publicness” about institutions that deliver public
services that has to be retained, even while they need more autonomy,
freedom and capacity to devise their own creative responsiveness to
citizen users demands rather than carry out centralized diktats and
targets. Simple privatization was and is never enough. At The Work
Foundation we are developing a programme investigating public value that
aims to combine Drucker’s insistence that public sector organizations
need to be more decentralized and have more autonomy with their ongoing
need to create public value. Drucker, we hope, would have approved.</p>
<p>Many of Drucker’s later writings were about the lessons to be learnt
from the way voluntary bodies are run. Another of his later concerns was
about what society should do about the fact that people are living
longer and retiring earlier. In other words, in the post-industrial
economy we are still treating retirement like we did in the mid-20th
century, resulting in bored, underutilized talented people who want to
still be active in their 70s and resentful younger workers whose taxes
support them. One answer, he argued, is to get away from a
promotion-oriented career to one where lifelong opportunities to develop
personal interests and skills are an important aspect of reward.</p>
<p>The importance of purpose</p>
<p>But perhaps some of the most profound and perspicacious of his ideas
relate to the purpose of work itself. To Drucker, the business
organization should be “a human, a social, indeed a moral phenomenon”;
that customer service rather than profit should dominate management
thinking and that profit should be invested in ongoing innovation and
improvement. In People and Performance (1973) he defined his view of
management as “to fulfil the specific purpose and mission of the
organization; to make work productive and the worker achieving; and to
manage social impacts and social responsibility”.</p>
<p>He argued that, as power in the workplace shifted from bosses to
knowledge workers, they effectively become volunteers, who join and stay
with the organization because they believe in what the organization
stands for; therefore it is of critical importance to articulate and
maintain a strong sense of purpose that keeps them there.</p>
<p>As a visionary and profound humanitarian, he advocated organizational
approaches which help people to grow, organizations to flourish and work
made more rewarding. There is no higher purpose. Indeed, it is Peter
Drucker’s influence and vision which has helped shape the purpose and
mission of The Work Foundation which is to inspire “good work for all”
in the twenty-first century. It is an inspirational legacy.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>This book grew out of a suggestion by my long-time American editor,
Cass Canfield, Jr., of HarperCollins. It is, however, a very different
book from the one Mr. Canfield and I originally envisaged. We thought of
a book that would bring together in one volume the best from the
management books I have written and published for more than fifty
years—a kind of “Drucker Retrospective.” But as I began to work on the
book Mr. Canfield suggested, it became increasingly clear to both of us
that what was appropriate was not a book looking backward. It was one
that looks AHEAD. As a result, this book contains NOTHING that is an
excerpt from earlier management books of mine. It supplements them by
LOOKING AHEAD. And all the time, while working on this book, I have
had—as I have had for many, many years—the benefit of Mr. Canfield’s
advice, suggestions, comments—they have greatly improved this book.</p>
<p>But this book also celebrates SIXTY years of close association with
my UK publisher, Butterworth-Heinemann. Since the firm—then Wm.
Heinemann—published my first book, The End of Economic Man, in 1939, I
have had no other publisher in the UK and in the countries of the
Commonwealth. It is an association I greatly treasure. I am delighted
that this book of mine will again appear under the Heinemann
imprint.</p>
<p>As readers see in Chapter Three, I preach piloting the new, that is,
testing it on a small scale. And, for once, I practice what I preach. I
pilot-test a new book. One way is to distribute early drafts and copies
to a few friends—mostly longtime clients—and ask for their candid
reaction. Again and again I have changed something, rewritten a section,
clarified an issue, as a result of their comments and criticism. But the
best pilot-test for my writings, I have found, is to prepublish sections
of a forthcoming book in magazines. This does TWO things. I get
reactions from readers—and they tell me both what might need changing
and where I need to explain or clarify. I owe a great debt to the
people—mostly strangers—who write in, comment on or criticize one of
these prepublished pieces, and especially to those who—often
loudly—dissent. My thanks to them all. But, above all, prepublishing in
a magazine gives me the inestimable benefit of being EDITED. I cannot
even begin to do justice to what I owe the editors of these
magazines—for their questions, their guidance, their cutting,
rephrasing, repositioning. Especially thanks are due to Jim Michaels and
Rich Karlgaard of Forbes magazine (which prepublished sections of
Chapter One and the first part of Chapter Four), to Gunders Strads of
the California Management Review (which prepublished an abridged version
of Chapter Five), and to Nan Stone of the Harvard Business Review (which
prepublished sections of Chapter Four and Chapter Six). They greatly
helped to make this a better book.</p>
<p>Introduction: Tomorrow’s “Hot” Issues</p>
<p>Where, readers may ask, is the discussion of COMPETITIVE STRATEGY, of
LEADERSHIP, of CREATIVITY, of TEAMWORK, of TECHNOLOGY in a book on
MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES? Where are the “HOT” ISSUES OF TODAY? But this is
the very reason why they are not in this book. It deals exclusively with
TOMORROW’S “Hot” Issues—the crucial, central, life-and-death issues that
are certain to be the major challenges of tomorrow.</p>
<p>CERTAIN? Yes. For this is not a book of PREDICTIONS, not a book about
the FUTURE. The challenges and issues discussed in it are already with
us in every one of the developed countries and in most of the emerging
ones (e.g., Korea or Turkey). They can already be identified, discussed,
analyzed and prescribed for. Some people, someplace, are already working
on them. But so far very few organizations do, and very few executives.
Those who do work on these challenges today, and thus prepare themselves
and their institutions for the new challenges, will be the leaders and
dominate tomorrow. Those who wait until these challenges have indeed
become “hot” issues are likely to fall behind, perhaps never to
recover.</p>
<p>This book is thus a Call for Action.</p>
<p>These challenges are not arising out of today. THEY ARE DIFFERENT. In
most cases they are at odds and incompatible with what is accepted and
successful today. We live in a period of PROFOUND TRANSITION—and the
changes are more radical perhaps than even those that ushered in the
“Second Industrial Revolution” of the middle of the 19th century, or the
structural changes triggered by the Great Depression and the Second
World War. READING this book will upset and disturb a good many people,
as WRITING it disturbed me. For in many cases—for example, in the
challenges inherent in the DISAPPEARING BIRTHRATE in the developed
countries, or in the challenges to the individual, and to the employing
organization, discussed in the final chapter on MANAGING ONESELF—the new
realities and their demands require a REVERSAL of policies that have
worked well for the last century and, even more, a change in the MINDSET
of organizations as well as of individuals.</p>
<p>This is a MANAGEMENT BOOK. It intentionally leaves out BUSINESS
CHALLENGES—even very important ones such as the question of whether the
EURO will displace the U.S. dollar as the world’s key currency, or what
will SUCCEED the 19th century’s most successful economic inventions, the
commercial bank and the investment bank. It intentionally does not
concern itself with ECONOMICS—even though the basic MANAGEMENT changes
(e.g., the emergence of knowledge as the economy’s key resource) will
certainly necessitate radically new economic theory and equally
radically new economic policy. The book does not concern itself with
politics—not even with such crucial questions as whether Russia can and
will recover as a political, military and economic power. It sticks with
MANAGEMENT ISSUES. There are good reasons for this. The issues this book
discusses, the new social, demographic and economic REALITIES, are not
issues that GOVERNMENT can successfully deal with. They are issues that
will have profound impact on politics; but they are not political
issues. They are not issues the Free Market can deal with. They are also
not issues of ECONOMIC THEORY or even of ECONOMIC POLICY. They are
issues that only MANAGEMENT and the INDIVIDUAL knowledge worker,
professional or executive can tackle and resolve. They are surely going
to be debated in the domestic politics of every developed and every
emerging country. But their resolution will have to take place within
the individual organization and will have to be worked out by the
individual organization’s MANAGEMENT—and by every single individual
knowledge worker (and especially by every single executive) within the
organization.</p>
<p>A great many of these organizations will, of course, be businesses.
And a great many of the individual knowledge workers affected by these
challenges will be employees of business or working with business. Yet
this is a MANAGEMENT book rather than a BUSINESS management book. The
challenges it presents affect ALL organizations of today’s society. In
fact, some of them will affect nonbusinesses even more, if only because
a good many nonbusiness organizations—the university, for instance, or
the hospital, let alone the government agency—are more rigid and less
flexible than businesses are, and far more deeply rooted in the
concepts, the assumptions, the policies of yesterday or even, as are
universities, in the assumptions of the day before yesterday (i.e., of
the 19th century).</p>
<p>How to use the book? I suggest you read a chapter at a time—they are
long chapters. And then first ask: “What do these issues, these
challenges MEAN for our organization and for me as a knowledge worker, a
professional, an executive?” Once you have thought this through, ask:
“What ACTION should our organization and I, the individual knowledge
worker and/or executive, take to make the challenges of this chapter
into OPPORTUNITIES for our organization and me?”</p>
<p>AND THEN GO TO WORK!</p>
