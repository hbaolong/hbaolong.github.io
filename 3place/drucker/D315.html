<p>所谓成长，也就是脱几层皮</p>
<p>昨晚和一个朋友聊天，她说自己这两年来活跃的群换了好几个，从<strong><em>到</em></strong>又到***，我说，这很正常</p>
<p>呀，如果你现在活跃的还是2年前的群，那才奇怪呢。</p>
<p>每天早上起来，我们都会照照镜子，一方面，我们会正衣冠，看看我们的样子是不是我们满意的；另</p>
<p>一方面我们也是看看我们自己的却缺点，看看自己的昨天有没有什么不满意的，自己今天可以改进一</p>
<p>点。</p>
<p>很多人会在出门的地方放一个镜子，不要小看这一个小小的镜子，每次出门那一撇，就会让你略微整</p>
<p>理一下衣领，或者抹一把头发，或者正一正眼镜，这点变化虽然不起眼，却会些许地改变你，几个月</p>
<p>后，几年后，十几年后，你会成为更加被自己喜欢和认可的那么一个人。</p>
<p>其实，在洗漱的时候，在你照镜子的时候，你可以多“一念”，这“一念”去想一下你对自己的一点点不</p>
<p>满，然后想着你改一下，或者不用去改。只要那么一想就好。</p>
<p>每天这“一念”，几个月后，几年后，十几年后，你会发现，自己越来越活出自己喜欢的那个样子。</p>
<p>就像蛇一样，隔一段时间蜕一层皮，每次蜕皮看起来都没什么变化，几次下来，就成了一个完美的大</p>
<p>蛇了。</p>
<p>人生的成长也无外乎如此。</p>
<p>幡然悔悟，醍醐灌顶，立地成佛，这些人生的境遇你不一定会遇到，“听君一席话，胜读十年书”，这</p>
<p>样的人生大起，我们当然期待。</p>
<p>吃一颗仙丹，增加一甲子功力；吃一个蛤蟆，从此百毒不侵，这样的神话我们也非常向往。</p>
<p>可是，这些都是可遇而不可求的，对于普通的我们来说，我们的成长就是一步步都走出来，一个台阶</p>
<p>一个台阶地迈上去，“一念”接着“一念”地修正我们细小的瑕疵。</p>
<p>在不经意间，我们完成了一次又一次的蜕皮，等我们某天再次看着镜子的时候，我们会发现，我们最</p>
<p>期待的那个人出现了，而那个人的美好，只是因为我们每天的那“一念”。</p>
<p>是呀，人生的成长无外乎如此，每天通过镜子前的那“一念”修正自己，积累到一定程度后就蜕去那层</p>
<p>皮，形成新的自己；然后继续修正自己，继续蜕皮。最后成为一条完美的大蛇，或者成就为自己喜欢</p>
<p>的那个人。</p>
<p>或许，从明天开始，我在每天早上看镜子的时候，在检测自己的胡子时候干净的时候，也会顺便检测</p>
<p>一下自己的其他瑕疵，或许只是“想”一下，或许想去修正，或者不去修正，都没关系。</p>
<p>这“一念”，会随着我的一天，陪我慢慢地改正我的一些缺点，随着时间的推移，我也会蜕出一层一层</p>
<p>的皮，在蜕完这些皮后，或许会迎来一个更加完美的自己。</p>
<p>你说呢？</p>
<p>人生，也不过如此。</p>

<p>How to Abandon</p>
<p>Abandonment must be practiced systematically.</p>
<p>“To abandon what?” and “To abandon how?” have to be practiced
systematically.</p>
<p>Otherwise they will always be “postponed,” for they are never
“popular” policies.</p>
<p>postponed：</p>

<p>In one fairly big company offering outsourcing services in most
developed countries, the first</p>
<p>Monday of every month is set aside for an abandonment meeting at
every management level from</p>
<p>top management to the supervisors in each area.</p>
<p>Each of these sessions examines one part of the business—one of the
services one Monday, one of</p>
<p>the regions in which the company does business a month later, the way
this or that service is</p>
<p>organized the Monday morning of the third month, and so on.</p>

<p>Within the year, the company this way examines itself completely,

<p>In the course of a year, three to four major decisions are likely to
be made on the “what” of the</p>
<p>company’s services and perhaps twice as many decisions to change the
“how.”</p>
<p>But also each year, three to five ideas for new things to do come out
of these sessions.</p>
<p>These decisions to change anything—whether to abandon something,
whether to abandon the way</p>
<p>something is being done, or whether to do something new—are reported
each month to all</p>
<p>members of management.</p>

<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>One Cannot Manage Change</p>
<p>One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it.</p>
<p>We do not hear much anymore about “overcoming resistance to change,”
which ten or fifteen years ago was one</p>
<p>of the most popular topics of management books and management
seminars. Everybody has accepted by now</p>
<p>that “change is unavoidable.” But this still implies that change is
like “death and taxes”: It</p>
<p>should be postponed as long as possible, and no change would be
vastly preferable.</p>
<p>But in a period of upheavals, such as the one we are living in,
change is the norm. To be sure, it is painful and</p>
<p>risky, and above all it requires a great deal of very hard work. But
unless it is seen</p>
<p>as the task of the organization to lead change, the organization—
whether business, university, hospital and so</p>
<p>on—will not sur- vive. In a period of rapid structural change, the
only ones who survive are the</p>
<p>Change Leaders.</p>
<p>It is therefore a central 21st-century challenge for manage- ment
that its organization become a change leader.</p>
<p>A change leader sees change as opportunity. A change leader looks for
change, knows how to find the right</p>
<p>changes and knows how to make them effective both outside the
organization and inside it. This requires:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Policies to make the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Systematic methods to look for and to anticipate change.</p></li>
<li><p>The right way to introduce change, both within and out- side the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Policies to balance change and continuity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is with these four requirements for being a change leader that
this chapter concerns itself.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Change Policies</p>
<p>There is a great deal of talk today about “the innovative organi-
zation.” But making an organization more</p>
<p>receptive to innova- tion—even organizing it for innovation—is not
nearly enough to be a change leader. It</p>
<p>might even be a distraction. For to be a change leader requires the
willingness and ability to change what is</p>
<p>already being done just as much as to do new and different things. It
requires policies to make the present create</p>
<p>the future.</p>
<p>The first policy—and the foundation for all the others—is to abandon
yesterday. The first need is to free</p>
<p>resources from being committed to maintaining what no longer
contributes to perfor- mance, and no longer</p>
<p>produces results. In fact, it is not possible to create tomorrow
unless one first sloughs off yesterday. To maintain</p>
<p>yesterday is always difficult and extremely time-con- suming. To
maintain yesterday therefore always commits</p>
<p>the institution’s scarcest and most valuable resources—and above all,
its ablest people—</p>
<p>to nonresults. Yet to do anything different—let alone to
innovate—always runs into unexpected difficulties. It</p>
<p>therefore always demands leadership by people of high and proven
ability. And if these people are committed to</p>
<p>maintaining yesterday, they are simply not available to create
tomorrow.</p>
<p>The first change policy, therefore, throughout the entire insti-
tution, has to be Organized Abandonment.</p>
<p>The change leader puts every product, every service, every</p>
<p>process, every market, every distribution channel, every customer and
enduse, on trial for its life. And it does so on a regular sched- ule.
The question has to be asked—and asked</p>
<p>seriously—”If we did not do this already, would we, knowing what we
now know, go into it?” If the answer is</p>
<p>“no,” the reaction must not be “Let’s make another study.” The
reaction must be “What do we do now?” The</p>
<p>enterprise is committed to change. It is committed to action.</p>
<p>In three cases the right action is always outright abandon- ment.</p>
<p>Abandonment is the right action if a product, service,</p>
<p>market or process “still has a few good years of life.” It is these
dying products, services or processes that</p>
<p>always demand the greatest care and the greatest efforts. They tie
down the most productive and ablest people.</p>
<p>But also we almost always overestimate how much “life” there is
still</p>
<p>in the old product, service, market or process. Usually they are not
“dying”; they are dead. And as an old</p>
<p>medical proverb has it, “There is nothing as difficult and as expen-
sive, but also nothing as futile, as to try to</p>
<p>keep a corpse from stinking.”</p>
<p>But equally a product, service, market or process should be abandoned
if the only argument for keeping it is:</p>
<p>“It’s fully written off.” To treat assets as being fully writ- ten
off has its place in tax accounting, but nowhere</p>
<p>else. For management purposes there are no “cost-less assets.” There
are only “sunk costs,” the economist’s</p>
<p>term for buildings and other fixed investments. The question is
never: “What have they cost?” The question is:</p>
<p>“What will they produce?” And assets that no longer produce except in
accounting terms, that is, assets which</p>
<p>produce only because they appear not to “cost” anything, are not
assets. There are only sunk costs.</p>
<p>The third case where abandonment is the right policy—and the most
important one—is the old and declining</p>
<p>product, ser- vice, market or process for the sake of maintaining
which, the new and growing product, service or</p>
<p>process is being stunted or neglected.</p>
<p>One recent example of what not to do is how the future was sacrificed
in the nineties, on the altar of yesterday,</p>
<p>by America’s largest automobile manufacturer, General Motors, and
America’s largest union of factory</p>
<p>workers, the United Automobile Workers Union (UAW).</p>
<p>Everybody in the United States knows that the Japanese automobile
makers acquired 30 percent of the</p>
<p>U.S. passenger-car market in ten short years from the mid- seventies
to the mid-eighties. But few realize that</p>
<p>none of</p>
<p>this gain was at the expense of America’s two smaller man-
ufacturers, Ford and Chrysler—on the contrary,</p>
<p>both actu- ally gained market share. One-third of the Japanese gain
was at the expense of Germany’s</p>
<p>Volkswagen, which had a market share of 10 percent in the seventies
but had lost practically all of it ten years</p>
<p>later to the Japanese. Two- thirds of the Japanese gain—a hefty 20
percent of the American market—was,</p>
<p>however, General Motors’ loss; its market share slumped from 50
percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p>For fifteen years General Motors did nothing except fiddle with
prices and discounts—none to any effect. Then,</p>
<p>finally, in the late 1980s it decided to counterattack—with a new car
called the “Saturn.” The Saturn is little but</p>
<p>a slightly more costly imitation of the Japanese—in its</p>
<p>styling, its manufacturing and marketing, its service and its labor
relations. And GM badly bungled its market</p>
<p>intro- duction. Still it was a smash hit since a great many people in
the United States were hungry for an</p>
<p>American-made car of the new kind.</p>
<p>But, as almost everyone outside GM immediately real- ized, the Saturn
did not compete with the Japanese</p>
<p>makes. All its sales came at the expense of declining—if not dying—GM
brands such as Oldsmobile and</p>
<p>Buick. And then GM—and even more so GM’s labor union, the United
Automobile Workers—began to throttle</p>
<p>the Saturn. It was denied money for expansion—that money went instead
into futile attempts to “modernize”</p>
<p>Oldsmobile and Buick plants. It was denied money to develop new
models— again that money went into</p>
<p>Oldsmobile and Buick redesigns. And the UAW began to whittle away at
the Saturn’s new and successful labor</p>
<p>relations for fear that Saturn’s example in building management-labor
partner- ships might spread to GM’s</p>
<p>other plants.</p>
<p>Neither Oldsmobile nor Buick has benefited. Both are still going
downhill. But the Saturn has been all but</p>
<p>destroyed. And both GM and the UAW have continued their decline.</p>
<p>Abandonment may take different forms.</p>
<p>In the GM cases, for instance, one possible solution might have been
to do simultaneously two things: (1) kill</p>
<p>the dying Oldsmobile and (2) run with Saturn’s success as hard as
possible, give it all the money and people it</p>
<p>need- ed but set it up as a separate company free to compete
aggressively with all of GM’s old products and for</p>
<p>all of GM’s old customers.</p>
<p>The right answer may even be to do more of the same but to do it
differently.</p>
<p>One example: Every book publisher knows that the bulk of its sales
(some 60 percent)—and practically all of</p>
<p>its prof- its—come from the “backlist,” that is, from titles that
have been out more than a year or two. But no</p>
<p>book publisher puts resources into selling the backlist. All the
efforts are</p>
<p>put into selling the new titles. A major publishing firm had tried
for years to get its salespeople to sell the</p>
<p>backlist without any success; and it also did not itself spend a
penny on promoting it. Then one outside director</p>
<p>asked: “Would we handle the backlist the way we do if we went</p>
<p>into it now?” And when the answer was a unanimous “no,”</p>
<p>she asked: “What do we do now?” As a result the firm reor- ganized
itself into two separate units: one buying,</p>
<p>editing, promoting and selling the new titles published in the cur-
rent year; one promoting and selling the</p>
<p>backlist. Within two years backlist sales had almost tripled—and the
firm’s profits doubled.</p>
<p>How to act on abandonment is thus the second question. It is as
important as the first one. It is actually more</p>
<p>controversial and more difficult. The answer should therefore always
be tested on a small scale or piloted (see a</p>
<p>later section of this chapter).</p>
<p>In a period of rapid change the “How?” is likely to become</p>
<p>obsolete faster than the “What?” The change leader must there- fore
also ask of every product, service, market</p>
<p>or process: “If we were to go into this now, knowing what we now
know, would we go into it the way we are</p>
<p>doing it now?” And this question needs to be asked of the successful
product, service, market and process as</p>
<p>regularly—and as seriously—as of the unsuccessful product, service,
market or process.</p>
<p>This applies to all areas of the enterprise. But it applies with
particular force to an area that many enterprises</p>
<p>tend to neglect, if not to ignore: distributors and distribution
channels. In a time of rapid change distributors and</p>
<p>distribution channels tend to change faster than anything else. And
it is also on distributors and distribution</p>
<p>channels that the “Information Revolution” is likely to have the
greatest impact.</p>
<p>The terms “distributors” and “distribution channels” are of course
business terms. But every institution has</p>
<p>“distributors.” And they are every institution’s first
“customers.”</p>
<p>Here is a nonbusiness example:</p>
<p>The high school placement counselor has been the “distri- bution
channel” through whom American</p>
<p>universities and colleges have traditionally reached prospective
applicants</p>
<p>for admission. But increasingly potential students and their</p>
<p>parents look for information to ratings of colleges and uni-
versities published in a number of magazines, to</p>
<p>books describing and rating different colleges and so on. Several
major American universities have</p>
<p>substantially increased the quantity and the quality of their
applicants by focusing their promotional efforts on</p>
<p>these new distribution chan- nels—without necessarily cutting back on
“selling” to the high school</p>
<p>placement counselor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the health maintenance organization (HMO) has increasingly
become the “distribution channel” for</p>
<p>hospitals, where, only ten years ago, the hospital distribution
channel was the physician. Increasingly, hospitals</p>
<p>are therefore working with HMOs to reach both physician and
patient.</p>
<p>So far, we can only speculate on the impact the Internet will</p>
<p>have on distribution. But it will have impact. One example of what is
already happening, and happening fast, is</p>
<p>the American automobile market.</p>
<p>It has been known for a long time that the wife makes the decision
about what cars not to buy. She, in effect,</p>
<p>there- fore makes the buying decisions. But the wife, as has also
been known for a long time, does not like to</p>
<p>shop at the automobile dealer. Hence, it is the husband who appears
as the buyer when the couple visits the</p>
<p>dealer—even though the actual decision has already been made, and
made by the wife. The Internet enables the</p>
<p>woman to do the actual buying—the dealer is rapidly becoming no more
than an “outlet.”</p>
<p>Hence the automobile industry faces the task of making the Internet
its distribution channel—General Motors is</p>
<p>known already to work on this. But does that mean abandoning the tra-
ditional automobile dealer?</p>
<p>“To Abandon What” and “To Abandon How” have to be prac- ticed
systematically. Otherwise they will always</p>
<p>be “postponed,” for they are never “popular” policies.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how successful abandonment policies can be
organized.</p>
<p>In one fairly big company offering outsourcing services in most
developed countries, the first Monday morning</p>
<p>of every month is set aside for an abandonment meeting at every
management level from top management to</p>
<p>the supervisors in each area. Each of these sessions examines one
part of the business—one of the services one</p>
<p>Monday, one of the regions in which the company does business a month
later, the way this or that service is</p>
<p>organized the Monday morning of the third month and so on. Within the
year, the company this way examines</p>
<p>itself completely, including its personnel policies, for instance. In
the course</p>
<p>of a year three to four major decisions are likely to be made</p>
<p>on the “what” of the company’s services and perhaps twice</p>
<p>as many decisions to change the “how.” But also each year three to
five ideas for new things to do come out of</p>
<p>these sessions. These decisions to change anything—whether to abandon
something, whether to abandon the</p>
<p>way some- thing is being done or whether to do something new—are
reported each month to all members of</p>
<p>management. And twice a year all management levels report on what has
actually happened as a result of their</p>
<p>session, what action has been taken and with what results.</p>
<p>Since this company first began organized abandonment eight or nine
years ago, it has grown more than fourfold (adjusted for inflation). It
attributes at least half of this growth to its systemat- ic abandonment
policies.</p>
<p>Organized Improvement</p>
<p>The next policy for the change leader is organized improvement</p>
<p>(what the Japanese call “Kaizen”)</p>
<p>Whatever an enterprise does internally and externally needs to be
improved systematically and continuously:</p>
<p>product and ser- vice, production processes, marketing, service,
technology, train- ing and development of</p>
<p>people, using information. And it needs to be improved at a preset
annual rate: In most areas, as the</p>
<p>Japanese have shown, an annual improvement rate of 3 percent is
realistic and achievable.</p>
<p>However, continuing improvement requires a major decision. What
constitutes “performance” in a given area?</p>
<p>If performance is to be improved—and that is, of course, what
continuous improvement aims at—we need to</p>
<p>define clearly what “perfor- mance” means.</p>
<p>One example: complex and difficult products in which the</p>
<p>rejection rate is high. To improve a rejection rate of 40 per- cent
of a finished product to one of 35 percent is</p>
<p>quite obviously a substantial improvement. But in most other</p>
<p>areas the decision is by no means that simple. What is “quality” in a
product? To what extent is it defined by the</p>
<p>producer? To what extent can it only be defined by the cus- tomer?
Even more difficult very often is the</p>
<p>definition of performance in services.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p>A major commercial bank decided that the way to improve performance
in its branches was to offer new and</p>
<p>more advanced financial “products,” for example, selling Treasury
bonds or giving advice on handling debt. It</p>
<p>spent a great deal of time and money researching what kinds of</p>
<p>financial products customers might want, developing these products
and training its branch personnel to deliver</p>
<p>them. But when the bank introduced the new products in its branches,
it rapidly lost customers. Only then did</p>
<p>the bank find out that to customers, performance of a bank branch
means not having to wait in line for routine</p>
<p>transactions. The additional “products” were valuable, the customers
thought, but they only needed them once</p>
<p>in a while.</p>
<p>The bank’s solution was to concentrate the tellers at the</p>
<p>branches on the simple, repetitive, routine services, which require
neither skill nor time. The new financial</p>
<p>products were assigned to different groups of people who were moved
to separate tables, with big signs</p>
<p>advertising the products in which each table specialized. As soon as
this was done, business went up sharply, both for the traditional and
the new services. But</p>
<p>because there had been no “pilot”—trying out the improvements in one
or two branches would have sufficed—</p>
<p>the bank lost almost two years and a great deal of money.</p>
<p>Continuous improvements in any area eventually transform the
operation. They lead to product innovation.</p>
<p>They lead to ser- vice innovation. They lead to new processes. They
lead to new businesses. Eventually</p>
<p>continuous improvements lead to funda- mental change.</p>
<p>Exploiting Success</p>
<p>The next policy that the change leader needs to develop is the</p>
<p>exploitation of success.</p>
<p>It is only seventy or eighty years since the “monthly report” was
invented and introduced in most business organizations. By now it is
routine and standard practically everywhere. Almost without exception
this report, on its</p>
<p>first page, presents the areas in which results fall below
expectations, or in which expenditures exceed budget.</p>
<p>It focuses on problems. In the monthly operating committee meeting,
which also has become routine and</p>
<p>standard in practically all enterprises—and by no means only in busi-
nesses—it is this report on the problems</p>
<p>that is being dis- cussed, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Problems cannot be ignored. And serious problems have to be taken
care of. But to be change leaders,</p>
<p>enterprises have to focus on opportunities. They have to starve
problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>This requires a small but fundamental procedural change: an
additional “first page” to the monthly report, and</p>
<p>one that should precede the page that shows the problems. It requires
a page that focuses on where results are</p>
<p>better than expect- ed, whether in terms of sales, revenues, profits
or volume. As much time then should be</p>
<p>spent on this new first page as has traditionally been spent on the
problem page. In some organizations that</p>
<p>have successfully organized themselves to be change leaders, the
opportunity page is given its own full</p>
<p>morning or its own full day, with a second full morning or full day
then devoted to the problems.</p>
<p>Enterprises that succeed in being change leaders make sure that they
staff the opportunities.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to list the opportunities on one page, and then
to list the organization’s performing and</p>
<p>capa-</p>
<p>ble people on another page. Then one allocates the ablest and most
performing people to the top opportunities.</p>
<p>This implies that the first—and usually the best—opportunity for
successful change is to exploit one’s own</p>
<p>successes and to build on them.</p>
<p>The best example, perhaps, is the Japanese company Sony. It has built
itself into one of the world’s leaders in a</p>
<p>number of major businesses by systematically exploiting one success
after the other—big or small.</p>
<p>All of Sony’s consumer electronics—the business in which it is the
world leader and best known—are based on</p>
<p>a product that was not even invented by Sony: the tape recorder. One
success of a Sony product based on the</p>
<p>tape recorder is used to design the next product and then anoth- er
product based on the success of that product</p>
<p>and so on. No step was a big one. And not all of them were
successful. But by exploiting success, each of these additional new
products carried very little risk—so that even when</p>
<p>it did not succeed there was not too much damage. And enough of them
were successful to make Sony into one</p>
<p>of the world’s largest, but also one of the world’s most consis-
tently successful, enterprises.</p>
<p>Another example is the medical electronics group of the American
General Electric Company. In a highly</p>
<p>competitive field it has emerged as the largest and most successful
manufac- turer, but also as a change leader.</p>
<p>It has done so apparently by exploiting its successes, and by
building on each success another product—</p>
<p>often with only a fairly minor change, but one that pre- sents a
significant improvement for physician</p>
<p>or hospital.</p>
<p>As in a continuous improvement, exploitation will, sooner or later,
lead to genuine innovation. There comes a</p>
<p>point when the small steps of exploitation result in a major,
fundamental change, that is, in something that is</p>
<p>genuinely new and different.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Creating Change</p>
<p>The last policy for the change leader to build into the enterprise is
a systematic policy of INNOVATION, that is,</p>
<p>a policy to cre- ate change.</p>
<p>It is the area to which most attention is being given today. It may,
however, not be the most important one—</p>
<p>organized aban- donment, improvement, exploiting success may be more
produc- tive for a good many</p>
<p>enterprises. And without these policies— abandonment, improvement,
exploitation—no organization can hope</p>
<p>to be a successful innovator.</p>
<p>But to be a successful change leader an enterprise has to have a
policy of systematic innovation. And the main</p>
<p>reason may not even be that change leaders need to innovate—though
they do. The main reason is that a policy</p>
<p>of systematic innovation pro- duces the mindset for an organization
to be a change leader. It makes the entire</p>
<p>organization see change as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Windows of Opportunity</p>
<p>This requires a systematic policy to look, every six to twelve
months, for changes that might be opportunities—</p>
<p>in the areas that I call “the windows of opportunity”:</p>
<p>• The organization’s own unexpected successes and unex- pected
failures, but also the unexpected successes</p>
<p>and unexpected failures of the organization’s competitors.</p>
<p>• Incongruities, especially incongruities in the process, whether of
production or distribution, or incongruities in</p>
<p>customer behavior.</p>
<p>• Process needs.</p>
<p>• Changes in industry and market structures.</p>
<p>• Changes in demographics.</p>
<p>• Changes in meaning and perception.</p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p>• New knowledge.*</p>
<p>A change in any one of these areas raises the question: “Is this an
opportunity for us to innovate, that is, to</p>
<p>develop different products, services, processes? Does it indicate new
and different</p>
<p>markets and/or customers? New and different technologies? New and
different distribution channels?”</p>
<p>Innovation can never be risk-free. But if innovation is based on
exploiting what has already happened—in the</p>
<p>enterprise itself, in its markets, in knowledge, in society, in
demographics and so on—it is far less risky than not</p>
<p>to innovate by exploiting these opportunities.</p>
<p>Innovation is not “flash of genius.” It is hard work. And this work
should be organized as a regular part of</p>
<p>every unit within the enterprise, and of every level of
management.</p>
<p>What Not to Do</p>
<p>There are Three Traps to avoid into which change leaders fall again
and again.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first trap is an innovation opportunity that is not in tune with
the strategic realities discussed in Chapter</li>
</ol>
<p>Two of this book.</p>
<p>It is most unlikely to work. The only innovation likely to succeed is
one that fits these major realities— of</p>
<p>demo</p>
<p>*These windows are described in considerable detail and with
numerous</p>
<p>examples in my 1985 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship (New York:
HarperCollins; Oxford: Butterworth/Heinemann).</p>
<p>graphics, of the changes in the distribution of income, of the way
the institution itself and its customers define</p>
<p>“performance,” of global competitiveness or of political and economic
realities. But the “misfit” opportunity</p>
<p>often looks very tempting—precisely because it looks truly
“innovative.” But even if not resulting in failure—</p>
<p>as it usually does—it always requires extraordinarily wasteful
amounts of effort, money and time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second trap is to confuse “novelty” with “innovation.” The test
of an innovation is that it creates value.</li>
</ol>
<p>A novel- ty only creates amusement. Yet, again and again, managements
decide to innovate for no other reason than that they are bored doing
the same thing or making the same</p>
<p>prod- uct day in and day out. The test of an innovation—as is also
the test of “quality”—is not: “Do we like it”?</p>
<p>It is: “Do customers want it and will they pay for it?”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>And the third trap: confusing motion with action. Typically when a
product, service or process no longer</li>
</ol>
<p>produces results and should be abandoned or changed radically,
management “reorganizes.” To be sure,</p>
<p>reorganization is often needed. But it comes after the action, that
is, after the</p>
<p>“what” and the “how” have been faced up to. By itself reor-
ganization is just “motion” and no substitute</p>
<p>for action.</p>
<p>These three traps are so attractive that every change leader can
expect to fall into one of them—or into all three</p>
<p>—again and again. There is only one way to avoid them, or to
extricate oneself if one has stumbled into them: to organize the
Introduction of Change, that is, to PILOT.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Piloting</p>
<p>Enterprises of all kinds increasingly use all kinds of market</p>
<p>research and customer research to limit, if not eliminate, the
risks</p>
<p>of change. But one cannot market research the truly new. But also</p>
<p>nothing new is right the first time. Invariably, problems crop up
that nobody even thought of. Invariably,</p>
<p>problems that loom very large to the originator turn out to be
trivial or not to exist at all. Above all, the way to</p>
<p>do the job invariably turns out to be differ- ent from what is
originally designed. It is almost a “law of</p>
<p>nature” that anything that is truly new, whether product or service
or technology, finds its major market and its</p>
<p>major application not where the innovator and entrepreneur expected,
and not for the use for which the</p>
<p>innovator or entrepreneur has designed the product, service or
technology. And that, no market or customer</p>
<p>research can possibly discover.</p>
<p>The best example is an early one.</p>
<p>The improved steam engine that James Watt (1736–1819)</p>
<p>designed and patented in 1776 is the event which, for most people,
signifies the advent of the Industrial</p>
<p>Revolution. Actually, Watt until his death saw only one use for the
steam engine: to pump water out of coal</p>
<p>mines. That was the use for which he had designed it. And he sold it
only to coal mines. It was his partner</p>
<p>Matthew Boulton (1728–1809) who is the real father of the Industrial
Revolution. Boulton saw that the</p>
<p>improved steam engine could be used in what was then England’s
premier indus- try, textiles, and especially in</p>
<p>the spinning and weaving of cotton. Within ten or fifteen years after
Boulton had sold his first steam engine to a</p>
<p>cotton mill, the price of cotton textiles had fallen by 70 percent.
And this created both the first mass market and</p>
<p>the first factory—and together mod- ern capitalism and the modern
economy altogether.</p>
<p>Neither studies nor market research nor computer modeling</p>
<p>are a substitute for the test of reality. Everything improved or new
needs therefore first to be tested on a small</p>
<p>scale, that is, it needs to be PILOTED.</p>
<p>The way to do this is to find somebody within the enter- prise who
really wants the new. As said before,</p>
<p>everything new gets into trouble. And then it needs a champion.
It</p>
<p>needs somebody who says: “I am going to make this suc- ceed,” and who
then goes to work on it. And this</p>
<p>person needs to be somebody whom the organization respects. This need
not even be somebody within the</p>
<p>organization. A good way to pilot a new product or new service is
often to find a customer who really wants the</p>
<p>new, and who is willing to work with the producer on making truly
suc- cessful the new product or the new</p>
<p>service.</p>
<p>If the pilot test is successful—if it finds the problems nobody</p>
<p>anticipated but also finds the opportunities that nobody anticipat-
ed, whether in terms of design, of market, of</p>
<p>service—the risk of change is usually quite small. And it is usually
also quite clear where to introduce the</p>
<p>change, and how to introduce it, that is, what entrepreneurial
strategy to employ.</p>
<p>The Change Leader’s Two Budgets</p>
<p>Finally, successful change leadership requires appropriate accounting
and budget policies. It requires TWO</p>
<p>separate bud- gets.</p>
<p>In most enterprises—and again not just in businesses—there is only
one budget, and it is adjusted to the</p>
<p>business cycle. In good times expenditures are increased across the
board. In bad times expenditures are cut</p>
<p>across the board. This, however, prac- tically guarantees missing out
on the future.</p>
<p>The change leader’s first budget is an operating budget that shows
the expenditures to maintain the present</p>
<p>business. This is normally 80 to 90 percent or so of all
expenditures.</p>
<p>That budget should always be approached with the question: “What is
the minimum we need to spend to keep oper- ations going?” And in poor
times it should, indeed,</p>
<p>be adjusted downward (though in good times most of it, probably,
should not be adjusted upward, and certainly no more than volume and/or
revenues increase).</p>
<p>And then the change leader has a second, separate budget for</p>
<p>the future. This budget remains stable throughout good times and bad
times. It rarely amounts to more than 10</p>
<p>or 12 percent of an enterprise’s total expenditures—and again this
applies to non- businesses as well as</p>
<p>to businesses.</p>
<p>Very few of the expenditures for the future produce results</p>
<p>unless maintained at a stable level over substantial periods.</p>
<p>This goes for work on new products, new services and new
technologies; for the development of markets and</p>
<p>cus- tomers and distribution channels, and above all, for the
development of people.</p>
<p>The future budget should be approached with the question: “What is
the maximum this activity can absorb to</p>
<p>produce opti- mal results?” That amount should be maintained in good
times or bad—unless times are so</p>
<p>catastrophic that maintaining expendi- tures threatens the survival
of the enterprise.</p>
<p>But the future budget also should include expenditures to exploit
success. The most common, but also the most</p>
<p>damaging, practice is to cut back on expenditures for successes,
especially in poor times, so as to maintain</p>
<p>expenditures for ongoing opera- tions, and especially expenditures to
maintain the past. The argu- ment is</p>
<p>always: “This product, service or technology is a success anyhow; it
doesn’t need to have more money put into</p>
<p>it.” But the right argument is: “This is a success, and therefore
should be sup- ported to the maximum possible.”</p>
<p>And it should be supported especially in bad times when the
competition is likely to cut spending and therefore</p>
<p>likely to create an opening.</p>
<p>We tend to manage according to the reports we receive and see. This
explains why it is important for the change</p>
<p>leader to have reports focusing on the areas in which the enterprise
does better than expected, the areas of</p>
<p>unexpected success, and there- fore the areas of potential
opportunity. It also explains why it is crucially</p>
<p>important for the change leader to have a budget that embodies the
commitment to making the future and to be</p>
<p>ahead of change.</p>
<p>90 Management Challenges for the 21st Century</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Change and Continuity</p>
<p>The traditional institution is designed for continuity. All
existing</p>
<p>institutions, whether businesses, universities, hospitals or church-
es, therefore have to make special efforts to</p>
<p>be receptive to change and to be able to change. It also explains why
existing institutions face resistance to</p>
<p>change. Change for the traditional institution is, so to speak, a
contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Change leaders are, however, designed for change. And yet they still
require continuity. People need to know</p>
<p>where they stand. They need to know the people with whom they work.
They need to know what they can</p>
<p>expect. They need to know the val- ues and the rules of the
organization. They do not function if the</p>
<p>environment is not predictable, not understandable, not known. But
continuity is equally needed outside the</p>
<p>enterprise. In fact, we are learning increasingly the importance of
long-term rela- tionships. To be able to</p>
<p>change rapidly, one needs close and con- tinuous relationships with
suppliers and distributors. But the</p>
<p>enterprise also has to have a “personality” that identifies it among
its customers and in its markets—and again</p>
<p>this is true as much of nonbusinesses as of businesses.</p>
<p>Change and continuity are thus poles rather than opposites. The more
an institution is organized to be a change</p>
<p>leader, the more it will need to establish continuity internally and
externally, the more it will need to balance</p>
<p>rapid change and continuity.</p>
<p>This balance will predictably be one of the major concerns of
tomorrow’s management—both of the</p>
<p>practitioners and of the scholars and writers on management. But we
do know already a good deal about how to</p>
<p>create it. Some institutions already are change leaders and have
tackled the problem—though not always</p>
<p>solved it.</p>
<p>One way is to make partnership in change the basis of contin- uing
relationships. This is what the Japanese</p>
<p>“Keiretsu” has done with respect to the relationship between supplier
and manufactur- er, and what is now</p>
<p>adopted fast in American business through “Economic-Chain Accounting”
(discussed in the next chapter of this</p>
<p>book). We are developing similar partnerships in change as</p>
<p>the basis of continuing relationships between manufacturer and
distributor, for example, between Procter &amp;</p>
<p>Gamble, the world’s largest producer of household needs, and large
retailers such as Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>But relationships within the enterprise (as discussed earlier in
Chapter One) are also increasingly going to be</p>
<p>partnerships— with employees of the organization, with people who
work for an out-sourcing firm but who are</p>
<p>actually members of the enter- prise’s own working teams, or with
outside, independent contractors. And again, these relations need
increasingly to be organized as long-term partnerships in the
process</p>
<p>of change.</p>
<p>Balancing change and continuity requires continuous work on
information. Nothing disrupts continuity and</p>
<p>corrupts relation- ships more than poor or unreliable information
(except, perhaps, deliberate misinformation).</p>
<p>It has to become routine for any enterprise to ask at any change,
even the most minor one: “Who needs to be</p>
<p>informed of this?” And this will become more and</p>
<p>more important as people no longer necessarily work next door to one
another and see one another half a dozen</p>
<p>times a day. The more enterprises come to rely on people working
together with- out actually working together</p>
<p>—that is, on people using the new technologies of information—the
more important it will become to make</p>
<p>sure that they are fully informed.</p>
<p>At the same time, it will also become more and more important for
these people to get together and actually</p>
<p>meet one another and work with one another on an orga- nized,
systematic, scheduled basis. Long-distance</p>
<p>infor- mation does not replace face-to-face relationships. It makes
them actually more important. It makes it</p>
<p>more important for people to know what to expect of one anoth- er. It
makes it more important for people to</p>
<p>know how the other person actually behaves. It makes it more
important to have trust in one another. And this</p>
<p>means both system- atic information—and especially information about
any change—and organized face-toface relationships, that is,
opportunities to get to know one another and to understand one
another.</p>
<p>92 Management Challenges for the 21st Century</p>
<p>Information is particularly important when the change is not a</p>
<p>mere improvement, but something truly new. It has to be a firm rule
in any enterprise that wants to be</p>
<p>successful as a change leader, that there are no surprises. Above
all, there is need for continuity in respect to the</p>
<p>fundamentals of the enterprise: its mission, its values, its
definition of performance and results. Precisely</p>
<p>because change is a constant in the change leader’s enterprise, the
foundations have to be extra strong.</p>
<p>Finally, the balance between change and continuity has to be built
into compensation, recognition and rewards.</p>
<p>We long ago learned that an organization will not innovate unless
innovators are properly rewarded. We long</p>
<p>ago learned that a business in which successful innovators do not
make it into senior management, let alone into</p>
<p>top management, will not innovate. We will have to learn, similarly,
that an organization will have to reward</p>
<p>continu- ity—by considering, for instance, people who deliver
continuing improvement to be as valuable to the</p>
<p>organization, and as deserv- ing of recognition and reward, as the
genuine innovator.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>Making the Future</p>
<p>One thing is certain for developed countries—and probably for the
entire world: We face long years of</p>
<p>profound changes. The changes are not primarily economic changes.
They are not even</p>
<p>primarily technological changes. They are changes in demograph- ics,
in politics, in society, in philosophy and,</p>
<p>above all, in world- view. Economic theory and economic policy are
unlikely to be effective by themselves in</p>
<p>such a period. And there is no social theory for such a period
either. Only when such a period is over, decades</p>
<p>later, are theories likely to be developed to explain what has
happened. But a few things are certain in such a</p>
<p>period. It is futile, for instance, to try to ignore the changes and
to pretend that tomorrow will be like yesterday,</p>
<p>only more so. This, however, is the position that existing
institutions tend to adopt in such a peri- od—</p>
<p>businesses as well as nonbusinesses. It is, above all, the</p>
<p>policy likely to be adopted by the institutions that were most suc-
cessful in the earlier period before the</p>
<p>changes. They are most likely to suffer from the delusion that
tomorrow will be like yes- terday, only more so.</p>
<p>Thus it can be confidently predicted that a large number of today’s
leaders in all areas, whether business,</p>
<p>education or health care, are unlikely still to be around thirty
years hence, and certainly not in their present</p>
<p>form. But to try to anticipate the changes is equally unlikely to be
successful. These changes are</p>
<p>not predictable.</p>
<p>The only policy likely to succeed is to try to make the future.
Changes of course have to fit the Certainties</p>
<p>(which this book attempted to outline in the preceding chapter).
Within these</p>
<p>restraints, however, the future is still malleable. It can still be
cre- ated.</p>
<p>To try to make the future is highly risky. It is less risky, how-
ever, than not to try to make it. A goodly</p>
<p>proportion of those attempting to do what this chapter discusses will
surely not suc- ceed. But, predictably, no</p>
<p>one else will.</p>

or-</p>
<p>ganized the Monday morning of the third month, and so on. Within the
year,</p>
<p>the company this way examines itself completely, including its
per-sonnel</p>
<p>policies, for instance. In the course of a year, three to four major
de-cisions</p>
<p>are likely to be made on the “what” of the company’s services and
perhaps</p>
<p>twice as many decisions to change the “how.” But also each year,
three to five</p>
<p>ideas for new things to do come out of these sessions. These
de-cisions to</p>
<p>change anything—whether to abandon something, whether to abandon
the</p>
<p>way something is being done, or whether to do something new—are
reported</p>
<p>each month to all members of management. And twice a year all
management</p>
<p>levels report on what has actually happened as a re-sult of their
sessions, what</p>
<p>action has been taken and with what results.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-1">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Implement a process of systematic abandonment, such as</p>
<p>setting aside the first Monday of every month for an abandonment</p>
<p>meeting.</p>
