<h2 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h2>
<p>郭靖和吕文焕</p>
<p>今天群里一个大佬说，他觉得郭靖之所以成为郭大侠，还有一个人功不可没。我本来以为他要说“黄</p>
<p>蓉”，结果他说了“吕文焕”。</p>
<p>即使对于金庸迷来书，这个名字也不算太熟。因为这个人在金庸的神雕侠侣里至少一个配角，虽然出</p>
<p>场很多次，台词却很少，而且大多是负面的台词，一语带过，更多是为了情节的推动而设置的。</p>
<p>当这个大佬说出这个名字时，我一下子就震惊了。是呀，郭靖之所以成为郭大侠，这个人太重要的，</p>
<p>甚至是最重要的，因为他是郭靖的领导。而且是直接领导。而且事实上，也是他真正成就了郭大侠。</p>
<p>这个成就不是反语，而是正面的肯定。</p>
<p>吕文焕是镇守襄阳的安抚使，是襄阳军政的第一长官，是襄阳事实上的负责人。当郭靖分析出襄阳对</p>
<p>蒙古军队重要的战略位置后，随即带领众多武林人士奔赴襄阳，这时襄阳的守将就是吕文焕。</p>
<p>吕文焕也是久闻郭靖大名，听说郭靖来帮他守襄阳，非常开心，就给了郭靖军事大权。不过，郭靖却</p>
<p>没有职位，既没有政府的职位，也没有军队的职位。</p>
<p>郭靖只有一个职责，就是带着吕文焕的军队以及丐帮弟子以及武林人士还有襄阳的百姓一起守护襄</p>
<p>阳。</p>
<p>郭靖武功很强，有丐帮的支持，有妻子黄蓉的智囊，还有众多武林人士的支持。不过，他仍然是吕文</p>
<p>焕的下属，他的权力来自于吕文焕。吕文焕仍然是襄阳正式的守将，襄阳最高的指挥官。</p>
<p>吕文焕需要对枢密副使负责，需要对皇帝负责，毕竟，这是战争年代，作为前线指挥官的吕文焕需要</p>
<p>对最高统帅负责，也就是枢密副使吕文德以及皇帝本人。</p>
<p>吕文焕还需要对全城的百姓负责。在宋朝，安抚使是父母官，负有一方百姓的安危。作为襄阳的安抚</p>
<p>使，吕文焕自然要对襄阳的百姓负责。至少表面如此。</p>
<p>吕文焕还需要对自己的那些士兵负责，对郭靖负责。毕竟，要指着这些士兵打战，要指着郭靖打战。</p>
<p>吕文焕的军事才能普通，当面临蒙古军队大军压境时，自己也非常惊慌。所以，当他看到郭靖的到</p>
<p>来，当他了解了郭靖的过往后，他果断地把军事权力授权给了郭靖。</p>
<p>郭靖也没有辜负吕文焕的期望，接手军事后，随即抵制住了蒙古军队的多次攻击，形成了胶着状态，</p>
<p>为守卫襄阳争夺了机会。</p>
<p>郭靖是一个直性子，是一个以百姓为唯一思考的人。只要（只有）对百姓有益，他就回去做。哪怕死</p>
<p>亡。</p>
<p>还好，有黄蓉，黄蓉是一个玲珑剔透的人，她是可以在很短时间分别出轻重的人。她很快就判断出襄</p>
<p>阳的安危一方面取决了郭靖的守护能力，另一方面取决了吕文焕的守护决心。更主要的是，取决了吕</p>
<p>文焕和郭靖的上下级关系。</p>
<p>这才是襄阳安危的关键。</p>
<p>吕文焕有自己的诉求，郭靖有自己的诉求。而作为下属的郭靖，必须满足吕文焕的诉求，才可以完成</p>
<p>自己的诉求。</p>
<p>那么吕文焕的诉求是什么呢？首先肯定是让皇帝和枢密副使放心。因为，如果皇帝不放心，就会撤换</p>
<p>吕文焕。什么？皇帝不会撤换？没人撤换？你去看看成都王惟忠将军的下场。</p>
<p>其次，就是守住襄阳，守住襄阳，才有吕将军。襄阳没有，吕将军要么降，要么死。</p>
<p>再有，就在自己的安全。不管前线如何打，自己一定要安全，自己的夫人一定要安全，自己的孩子一</p>
<p>定要安全，自己的小妾一定要安全。不然还不如投降呢，投降后虽然屈辱，自己大概率是安全的。</p>
<p>最后，但也是非常重要的，就是老百姓要觉得自己很厉害。至于道理，你懂得。</p>
<p>这些就是吕文焕的诉求，这些诉求郭靖不一定知道，但黄蓉很清楚，然后郭靖就知道了。</p>
<p>还有，郭靖一定不能在公众面前抢吕文焕的风头，所以，吕文焕一直没有给郭靖任何正式职位。这一</p>
<p>点郭靖也非常清楚。所以，只要有公开场合，吕文焕都是在最显眼的地方。</p>
<p>当然，吕文焕的诉求得到了满足，郭靖的诉求也就得到了满足。在长达38年里，郭靖在吕文焕的支持</p>
<p>下，一直坚守着襄阳，守卫者襄阳的百姓，守卫着襄阳以南的百姓，守护着大宋的半壁江山。在这份</p>
<p>守护中，郭靖也成长成为了郭大侠。</p>
<p>后来襄阳城破。郭靖殉城，而吕文焕则带着家属投降元军。</p>
<p>哎。</p>

<p>There are keys to success in managing bosses.</p>
<p>First, put down on a piece of paper a “boss list,” everyone to whom
you are accountable,</p>
<p>everyone who appraises you and your work, everyone on whom you depend

their manager how well</p>
<p>they have been doing their job; the system of holding such meetings
（上司对雇员的）工</p>
<p>作鉴定会；工作表现评估</p>
<p>Next, go to each of the people on the boss list at least once a year
and ask, “What do I</p>
<p>do and what do my people do that helps you do your job?” And, “What
do we do that</p>
<p>hampers you and makes life more difficult for you?”</p>
<p>It is your job to enable each of your bosses to perform as unique
individuals according to</p>
<p>their working styles.</p>
<p>Your bosses should feel comfortable that you are playing to their
strengths and</p>
<p>safeguarding them from their limitations and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Make a “boss list.” Ask the questions listed in this reading to each

<p>The Effective Executive</p>
<p>Managing the Boss (Corpedia Online Program)</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>How Do I Manage My Boss?</p>
<p>Above all, the effective executive tries to make fully productive the
strengths of his</p>
<p>own superior.</p>
<p>I have yet to find a manager, whether in business, in government, or
in any other</p>
<p>institution, who did not say: “I have no great trouble managing my
subordinates. But how</p>
<p>do I manage my boss?” It is actually remarkably easy— but only
effective executives know</p>
<p>that. The secret is that effective executives make the strengths of
the boss productive.</p>
<p>■ This should be elementary prudence. Contrary to popular legend,</p>
<p>subordinates do not, as a rule, rise to position and prominence over
the prostrate bodies</p>
<p>of incompetent bosses. If their boss is not promoted,</p>
<p>they will tend to be bottled up behind him. And if their boss is
relieved for incompetence</p>
<p>or failure, the successor is rarely the bright, young man next in
line. He usually is brought</p>
<p>in from the outside and brings</p>
<p>with him his own bright, young men. Conversely, there is nothing
quite</p>
<p>as conducive to success as a successful and rapidly promoted
superior.</p>
<p>But way beyond prudence, making the strength of the boss productive
is a key to the</p>
<p>subordinate’s own effectiveness. It enables him to focus his own</p>
<p>contribution in such a way that it finds receptivity upstairs and
will be put to use.</p>
<p>It enables him to achieve and accomplish the things he himself
believes in.</p>
<p>One does not make the strengths of the boss productive by toadying to
him.</p>
<p>One does it by starting out with what is right and presenting it in a
form which is</p>
<p>accessible to the superior.</p>
<p>The effective executive accepts that the boss is human (something
that intelligent young</p>
<p>subordinates often find hard). Because the superior is human,</p>
<p>he has his strengths; but he also has limitations. To build on his
strengths, that is,</p>
<p>to enable him to do what he can do, will make him effective—and will
make the</p>
<p>subordinate effective. To try to build on his weaknesses will be as
frustrating and</p>
<p>as stultifying as to try to build on the weaknesses of a subordinate.
The effective</p>
<p>executive, therefore, asks: “What can my boss do really well?” “What
has he</p>
<p>done really well?” “What does he need to know to use his strength?”
“What does</p>
<p>he need to get from me to perform?” He does not worry too much over
what the boss</p>
<p>cannot do.</p>
<p>■ Subordinates typically want to “reform” the boss. The able senior
civil servant is</p>
<p>inclined to see himself as the tutor to the newly appointed political
head of his agency. He</p>
<p>tries to get his boss to overcome his limitations. The effective ones
ask instead: “What</p>
<p>can the new boss do?” And if the answer is: “He is good at
relationships</p>
<p>with Congress, the White House, and the public,” then the civil
servant works at making it</p>
<p>possible for his minister to use these abilities. For the best
administration and the best</p>
<p>policy decisions are futile unless there is also political skill in
representing them. Once the</p>
<p>politician knows that the civil servant supports him, he will soon
enough listen to him on</p>
<p>policy and on administration.</p>
<p>The effective executive also knows that the boss, being human, has
his own ways of</p>
<p>being effective. He looks for these ways. They may be only manners
and habits, but they</p>
<p>are facts.</p>
<p>It is, I submit, fairly obvious to anyone who has ever looked that
people are</p>
<p>either “readers” or “listeners” (excepting only the very small group
who get their</p>
<p>information through talking, and by watching with a form of psychic
radar the reactions of</p>
<p>the people they talk to; both President Franklin Roosevelt and
President Lyndon Johnson</p>
<p>belong in this category, as apparently did Winston Churchill). People
who are both</p>
<p>readers and listeners—trial lawyers have to be both, as a rule—</p>
<p>are exceptions. It is generally a waste of time to talk to a reader.
He only listens after he</p>
<p>has read. It is equally a waste of time to submit a</p>
<p>voluminous report to a listener. He can only grasp what it is all
about through the</p>
<p>spoken word.</p>
<p>Some people need to have things summed up for them in one page.
(President</p>
<p>Eisenhower needed this to be able to act.) Others need to be able to
follow the thought</p>
<p>processes of the man who makes the recommendation and therefore
require a big report</p>
<p>before anything becomes meaningful to them. Some superiors want to
see sixty pages of</p>
<p>figures on everything. Some want to be in at the early stages so that
they can prepare</p>
<p>themselves for the eventual decision. Others do not want even to hear
about the matter</p>
<p>until it is “ripe,” and so on.</p>
<p>The adaptation needed to think through the strengths of the boss and
to try to make the</p>
<p>m productive always affects the “how” rather than the “what.” It
concerns the order in</p>
<p>which different areas, all of them</p>
<p>relevant, are presented, rather than what is important or right. If
the superior’s strength lie</p>
<p>s in his political ability in a job in which political ability is
truly relevant, then one presents t</p>
<p>o him first the political aspect of a situation. This enables him to
grasp what the issue is al</p>
<p>l about and to put his strength effectively behind a new policy. All
of us are “experts” on o</p>
<p>ther people and see them much more clearly than they see themselves.
To make the boss</p>
<p>effective is therefore usually fairly</p>
<p>easy. But it requires focus on his strengths and on what he can do.
It requires building on</p>
<p>strength to make weaknesses irrelevant. Few things make an executive
as effective as</p>
<p>building on the strengths of his superior.</p>
