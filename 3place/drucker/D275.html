<p>我要做出自己的极致PPT</p>
<p>书友会成立了一个PPT小组，是艳红说要成立的。艳红听了隗洁的一次分享后，就决定成立这个PPT小</p>
<p>组。</p>
<p>PPT，本来是一种文件格式，是微软的PowerPoint的文件格式，后来成了一个代名词，就像PS代表修</p>
<p>图一样，PPT代表的是演示，通过演示来表达自己。</p>
<p>我接触PPT非常早，早到可以暴露自己的年龄了。好吧，我是1995年接触PPT，当时在上海的一个学</p>
<p>校里给小孩子们讲PPT，而我做助教。</p>
<p>再后来，微软把word、excel、ppt组成了一个小分队，PPT也就成了办公组件中的一个小角色了。毕</p>
<p>竟，对于办公室来说，word和excel才是主流。办公自动化考的就是word和excel么。（什么？你没听</p>
<p>过办公自动化？恭喜你，你应该很小）。</p>
<p>我是一个码农，在公司，在身边，电脑出什么问题都会有人来找我。这应该是所有码农的经历吧。不</p>
<p>过，有一个事别人肯定不会来找码农，就是word、excel不会用了。</p>
<p>很久很久前就传说，在公司里，最不会用word和excel的就是码农。而最会用excel的是谁的？</p>
<p>对，是会计。</p>
<p>所以，我一直“会”用word，后来有了excel后，觉得excel和word有啥区别呀，不就多了一些表格么？</p>
<p>word也可以做表格呀。</p>
<p>再有来，又有了PowerPoint，这是什么鬼东西？给别人讲时播放的？讲不是用嘴么？播放啥？</p>
<p>不过，我还是用上了PPT。因为年龄大了，年龄大了后，经常有人让讲一些东西。每次讲东西前，别人</p>
<p>都会问我的PPT，我也就只好准备一个PPT了。</p>
<p>通常我的PPT也就5-10页，首页是演讲的主题和我的名字，尾页是谢谢，中间是提纲。所以，我每次</p>
<p>准备PPT也就是几分钟，最多十几分钟。毕竟，自己要将什么自己心里很清楚，随便写一下就好了，现</p>
<p>场讲的时候再发挥。</p>
<p>就这么着，我也分享过很多次各种稀奇古怪的内容。</p>
<p>这几年，随着乔布斯PPT的狂热，国内的很多企业也开始关注PPT了，比如比较有名的乐视，据说就是</p>
<p>靠PPT来争取一轮一轮的融资。还有锤子的罗永浩，混沌的李善友等等等等，都通过优秀的PPT演示获</p>
<p>得了巨大的行业机会。</p>
<p>甚至还有一个叫做秋叶的人，凭借PPT教学获得了不错的江湖地位（不止是收入哦）。</p>
<p>后来，我认识了一个叫做XX的人（各种原因，就不说他的名字了），他是做保险了，他和别的做保险</p>
<p>业务的人有一点不同，他有一个PPT，他的PPT很长，大约有上百页，而且很大，据他自己说有1G多，</p>
<p>里面内置了一些视频、数据，以及和保险相关的演示。</p>
<p>他把他对保险的理解，对客户的理解，都放在了一个PPT里，这个PPT他已经写了2年了。随着两年来</p>
<p>他对保险的理解，对自己的理解，对客户的理解，对生活的理解，这个PPT也越来越大，越来越精致，</p>
<p>越来越完美。</p>
<p>他的工作也越来越顺畅。</p>
<p>保险和PPT其实离得挺远。我听说大多数保险业务员都是精于填写表格，而这位，却用一份PPT陪伴自</p>
<p>己成长。</p>
<p>我这几天也做了不少PPT，是讲技术的，讲如何可以协同设计，如何可以组织讨论，讲实现这些功能需</p>
<p>要的设备以及设备的网络拓扑架构。</p>
<p>其实这样的PPT我以前做过很多，每次做的时候，还是要从头做。想到那个陪伴保险业务员共同成长的</p>
<p>PPT，我在想，我是不是也应该做一个很棒很棒的PPT，让这个PPT陪着自己成长？自己在成长，它也</p>
<p>在成长。三年后，它会成长成什么样呢？</p>
<p>同样，对于其他的岗位也是一样，比如销售，售前技术，中、高层管理，投资人，甚至工人。</p>
<p>我们用word来记录、来书写；我们用excel来计算，来统计；最后，我们用PPT来梳理，来表达。如果</p>
<p>我们有了用PPT来梳理自己，梳理自己的职业、工作、人生时，随着时间的推移，或者一年，或者三</p>
<p>年，或者更久，我们就会得到一个精致的PPT，一个可以反应我们人生的PPT，一位可以协助我们更好</p>
<p>地工作、学习、生活的PPT，也会让我们和自己想出的更加和谐。成就更好的自己。</p>
<p>这或许是我这个朋友的PPT的价值，这也是他可以在两年内在保险行业做到一定成绩的一个助力吧。</p>
<p>所以，当艳红说想做一个PPT小组时，我想到的就是，我要在这个小组里学会一些表达的技巧，以帮助</p>
<p>我在未来的一年或者三年或者更久，结合我的专业知识，形成我自己的PPT，这个PPT或协助我成长，</p>
<p>我会每天修正这个PPT，这个PPT也会每天修正我，让我和它互相成就。</p>
<p>最后，我会得到一个极致的PPT，也会得到一个期待的自己。</p>
<p>这或许是我对这个PPT小组的期待吧。</p>
<p>如果你也有真个想法，有兴趣加入这个兴趣小组，加dtsxiaobao微信，和小宝私信你的职业，他会邀</p>
<p>请你进群，和其他同学们共同成长，做出属于自己的极致PPT。</p>

<p>“The Gods can see them.”</p>
<p>quest, hunting</p>
<p>The greatest sculptor of ancient Greece, Phidias, around 440 BC made
the statues that to this day,</p>
<p>2,400 years later, still stand on the roof of the Parthenon in
Athens.</p>
<p>When Phidias submitted his bill, the city accountant of Athens
refused to pay it.</p>
<p>“These statues stand on the roof of the temple, and on the highest
hill in Athens. Nobody can see</p>
<p>anything but their fronts. Yet, you have charged us for sculpturing
them in the round, that is, for</p>
<p>doing their backsides, which nobody can see.”</p>
<p>“You are wrong,” Phidias retorted. “The Gods can see them.”</p>
<p>Whenever people ask me which of my books I consider the best, I smile
and say, “The next.”</p>
<p>I do not, however, mean it as a joke.</p>
<p>I mean it the way Verdi meant it when he talked of writing an opera
at eighty in the pursuit of a</p>
<p>perfection that had always eluded him.</p>
<p>Though I am older now than Verdi was when he wrote Falstaff, I am
still thinking and working on</p>
<p>two additional books, each of which, I hope, will be better than any
of my earlier ones, will be more</p>
<p>important, and will come a little closer to exce-lence.</p>

<p>Drucker on Asia</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>Drucker’s seven experiences</p>
<p>I was not yet eighteen when, having finished high school, I left my
native Vienna in Austria, and</p>
<p>went to Hamburg in Germany, as a trainee in a cotton–export firm.</p>
<p>My father was not very happy. Ours had been a family of civil
servants, professors, lawyers and</p>
<p>physicians, for a very long time.</p>
<p>He therefore wanted me to be a fulltime university student, but I was
tired of being a school boy,</p>
<p>and wanted to go to work.</p>
<p>To appease my father, but without any serious intention, I enrolled
at Hamburg University in the</p>
<p>Law faculty.</p>
<p>In those remote days, the year 1927, one did not have to attend
classes in Austria or Germany to be</p>
<p>a perfectly proper university student.</p>
<p>All one had to do was to obtain signatures of the professors in the
registration book.</p>
<p>For this, one did not even have to go to class.</p>
<p>All one had to do was to give a small tip to the faculty messenger
who then went and sought the</p>
<p>professors’ signatures.</p>
<p>There were no classes offered in the evening, and I worked during the
day.</p>
<p>During my entire year and a half in Hamburg, I therefore did not
attend a single class at the</p>
<p>university.</p>
<p>And yet, I was considered a university student in good standing.</p>
<p>This sounds strange to modern ears, but it was not at least unusual
in those more relaxed days.</p>
<p>As I have recounted earlier, anyone with a high school diploma was
automatically admitted to any</p>
<p>university.</p>
<p>All one then had to do to obtain a university degree was to pay a
small annual fee and show</p>
<p>up for an exam at the end of four years.</p>
<p>Work as a trainee in an export firm The work as a trainee was
terribly boring, and I learned very</p>
<p>little.</p>
<p>It began at seven–thirty in the morning, and was over at</p>
<p>four in the afternoon, and at twelve on Saturday. So I had</p>
<p>lots of free time. On weekends, two other trainees – also</p>
<p>from Austria, but working in other firms – and I usually went</p>
<p>hiking in the beautiful countryside outside of Hamburg,</p>
<p>spending the night in a youth hostel where, being officially</p>
<p>students, we could obtain free lodging. I had five week–day</p>
<p>evenings all to myself in Hamburg’s famous City Library,</p>
<p>which was almost next door to my office. University students</p>
<p>were encouraged to borrow as many books as they wanted.</p>
<p>For fifteen months, I read, and read, and read, in German</p>
<p>and English and French.</p>
<p>The first experience – taught by Verdi</p>
<p>And then, once a week, I went to the opera. The Hamburg</p>
<p>Opera was then, as it still is, one of the world’s foremost</p>
<p>opera houses. I had very little money as trainees were not</p>
<p>paid, but for university students, the opera was free. All one</p>
<p>had to do was to go there one hour before the performance.</p>
<p>Ten minutes before the performance began, cheap seats remaining</p>
<p>unsold were given out free to university students.</p>
<p>On one of these evenings I went to hear an opera by the</p>
<p>great nineteenth century Italian composer, Giuseppe Verdi –</p>
<p>the last opera he wrote in 1893, the title is Falstaff. It has
now</p>
<p>become one of Verdi’s most popular operas, but sixty five</p>
<p>years ago it was rarely performed. Both singers and audiences</p>
<p>thought it too difficult. I was totally overwhelmed by</p>
<p>it. I had a good musical education as a boy as the Vienna of</p>
<p>my youth was an extremely musical city. Although I had heard</p>
<p>a great many operas, I had never heard anything like this. I</p>
<p>have never forgotten the impression that evening made on</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>‘Striving for perfection’ – goal and vision</p>
<p>When I made a study, I found, to my great surprise, that this</p>
<p>opera, with its gaiety, its zest for life, and its incredible
vitality,</p>
<p>was written by a man aged eighty! To me, then just eighteen,</p>
<p>eighty was an incredible age. I doubt that I even knew</p>
<p>anyone that old. It was not a common age when life expectancies,</p>
<p>even among healthy people, were around fifty or so.</p>
<p>Then I read what Verdi himself had written, when he was</p>
<p>asked why, at his age, a famous man and, considered one of</p>
<p>the nineteenth century’s foremost opera composers, he had</p>
<p>taken on the hard work of writing one more opera, and an</p>
<p>exceedingly demanding one. ‘All my life as a musician,’ he</p>
<p>wrote, T have striven for perfection. It has always eluded</p>
<p>me. I surely had an obligation to make one more try.’</p>
<p>I have never forgotten these words – they made an indelible</p>
<p>impression on me. Verdi, when he was my age, that was</p>
<p>eighteen, was of course already a seasoned musician. I had</p>
<p>no idea what I would become, except that I knew by that</p>
<p>time that I was unlikely to be a success exporting cotton
textiles.</p>
<p>At eighteen, I was as immature, as callow, as naive as</p>
<p>an eighteen–year–old can be. It was not until fifteen years</p>
<p>later, when I was in my early thirties, that I really knew what</p>
<p>I am good at and where I belong. But I then resolved that,whatever my
life’s work would be, Verdi’s</p>
<p>words would be</p>
<p>my lodestar. I then resolved that if I ever reached an advanced</p>
<p>age, I would not give up, but would keep on. In the</p>
<p>meantime, I would strive for perfection even though, as I</p>
<p>well knew, it would surely, always elude me.</p>
<p>The second experience – taught by Phidias</p>
<p>It was at about the same time, and also in Hamburg during</p>
<p>my stay as a trainee, that I then read a story which conveyed</p>
<p>to me what ‘perfection’ means. It is a story of the greatest</p>
<p>sculptor of ancient Greece, Phidias. He was commissioned</p>
<p>around 440BC to make the statues which to this day, 2400</p>
<p>years later, still stand on the roof of the Parthenon in Athens.</p>
<p>To this day, they are considered among the greatest sculptures</p>
<p>of the Western tradition. The statues were universally</p>
<p>admired, but when Phidias submitted his bill, the City Accountant</p>
<p>of Athens refused to pay it. ‘These statues,’ the</p>
<p>accountant said, ’stand on the roof of the temple, and on the</p>
<p>highest hill in Athens. Nobody can see anything but their</p>
<p>fronts. Yet, you have charged us for sculpturing them in the</p>
<p>round, that is, for doing their backsides, which nobody can</p>
<p>see/</p>
<p>‘The Gods can see them’</p>
<p>‘You are wrong,’ Phidias retorted. ‘The Gods can see them.’</p>
<p>I read this, as I remember, shortly after I had listened to
Falstaff,</p>
<p>and it hit me hard. I have not always lived up to it. I have</p>
<p>done many things which I hope the Gods will not notice, but</p>
<p>I have always known that one has to strive for perfection</p>
<p>even if only ‘the Gods’ notice.</p>
<p>Whenever people ask me which of my books I consider the</p>
<p>best, I smile and say, ‘The next.’ I do not however mean it as</p>
<p>a joke. I mean it the way Verdi meant when he talked of</p>
<p>writing an opera at eighty in the pursuit of a perfection that</p>
<p>had always eluded him. Though I am older now than Verdi</p>
<p>was when he wrote Falstaff, I am still thinking and working</p>
<p>on two additional books each of which, I hope, will be better</p>
<p>than any of my earlier ones, will be more important, and will</p>
<p>come a little closer to excellence.</p>
<p>Work as a journalist</p>
<p>A few years later, I moved to Frankfurt in Germany. I worked</p>
<p>first as a trainee in a brokerage firm. Then after the New York</p>
<p>Stock Market crash in October 1929, when the brokerage firm</p>
<p>went bankrupt, I was hired on my twentieth birthday by</p>
<p>Frankfurt’s largest newspaper, as a financial and foreign affairs</p>
<p>writer. I continued to be enrolled as a law student at the</p>
<p>university because in those days one could easily transfer</p>
<p>from one European university to any other. I still was not</p>
<p>interested in the law, but I remembered the lessons of Verdi</p>
<p>and of Phidias. A journalist has to write about many subjects</p>
<p>so I decided that I had to know something about many subjects</p>
<p>to be at least a competent journalist.</p>
<p>The third experience – developing own method of</p>
<p>studying</p>
<p>The newspaper I worked for came out in the afternoon. We</p>
<p>began work at six in the morning and finished by a quarter–</p>
<p>past–two in the afternoon, when the last edition went to press.</p>
<p>So I began to force myself to study afternoons and evenings:</p>
<p>international relations and international law; the history of</p>
<p>social and legal institutions; history in the round; finance,</p>
<p>and so on. Gradually, I developed a system. I still adhere to</p>
<p>it. Every three or four years I pick a new subject. It may be</p>
<p>statistics, it may be medieval history, it may be Japanese art,</p>
<p>it may be economics. Three years of study are by no means</p>
<p>enough to master a subject, but they are enough to understand</p>
<p>it. So, for more than sixty years, I have kept on studying</p>
<p>one subject at a time. This has not only given me a substantial</p>
<p>fund of knowledge. It has also forced me to be open</p>
<p>to new disciplines and new approaches and new methods –</p>
<p>for every one of the subjects I have studied, makes different</p>
<p>assumptions and employs a different methodology.</p>
<p>The fourth experience – taught by the editor–in–chief</p>
<p>The next experience to report in this long story of keeping</p>
<p>myself intellectually alive and growing is what was taught by</p>
<p>the editor–in–chief, one of Europe’s leading newspapermen.</p>
<p>The editorial staff consisted of very young people. At age</p>
<p>twenty two, I became one of three assistant managing editors.</p>
<p>The reason was not that I was particularly good. In fact,</p>
<p>I never became a first–rate daily journalist. But, in those years</p>
<p>around 1930, the people who should have held this kind of</p>
<p>position – people aged thirty five or so – were not available in</p>
<p>Europe. They had been killed in World War I. Even highly–</p>
<p>responsible positions had to be filled by young people such</p>
<p>as me. This situation was not too different from what I found</p>
<p>in Japan when I first went there ten years after the end of the</p>
<p>Pacific War, in the mid– and late fifties.</p>
<p>The editor–in–chief, then around fifty, took infinite pains to</p>
<p>train and to discipline his young crew. He discussed with</p>
<p>each of us every week the work we had done. Twice a year,</p>
<p>right after New Year and then again before summer vacations</p>
<p>began in June, we would spend a Saturday afternoon and all</p>
<p>of Sunday to discuss our work over the preceding six months.</p>
<p>The editor would always start out with the things we had</p>
<p>done well. Then he would proceed to the things we had tried</p>
<p>to do well. Next he reviewed the things where we had not</p>
<p>tried hard enough. And finally, he would subject us to a</p>
<p>scathing critique of the things we had done badly or had</p>
<p>failed to do. The last two hours of that session we would</p>
<p>then project our work for the next six months: What are the</p>
<p>things on which we should concentrate? What are the things</p>
<p>we should improve? What are the things each of us needs to</p>
<p>learn? And a week later each of us was expected to submit to</p>
<p>the editor–in–chief our new program of work and learning for</p>
<p>the next six months.</p>
<p>I tremendously enjoyed the sessions, but I forgot them as</p>
<p>soon as I left the paper.</p>
<p>Reviewing the preceding year</p>
<p>Almost ten years later, and already in the US, I remembered</p>
<p>them. It was then in the early 1940s that I became a senior</p>
<p>professor in a major faculty, started my own consulting practice</p>
<p>and began to publish major books. Then I remembered</p>
<p>what the Frankfurt editor–in–chief had taught. Since then, I</p>
<p>have set aside two weeks every summer in which to review</p>
<p>my work during the preceding year, beginning with the things</p>
<p>I did well, but could or should have done better, down to the</p>
<p>things I did poorly and the things I should have done but did</p>
<p>not do. I decide what my priorities should be in my consulting</p>
<p>work, in my writing, in my teaching.</p>
<p>I have never once truly lived up to the plan I make each</p>
<p>August, but it has forced me to live up to Verdi’s injunction</p>
<p>‘to strive for perfection’ even though ’it has always eluded</p>
<p>me’ and still does.</p>
<p>The fifth experience – taught by the senior partner</p>
<p>My next learning experience came a few years later. From</p>
<p>Frankfurt in Germany I moved to London in England in 1933,</p>
<p>first as a securities analyst in a large insurance company and</p>
<p>then, a year later, to a small but fast–growing private bank as</p>
<p>the firm’s economist and executive secretary to the three senior</p>
<p>partners – one, the founder, a man in his seventies, two</p>
<p>others in their mid–thirties. At first I worked exclusively with</p>
<p>the two younger men, but after I had been at the firm some</p>
<p>three months or so, the founder called me into his office and</p>
<p>said: ’I didn’t think much of you when you came in here and</p>
<p>still don’t think much of you, but you are even more stupid</p>
<p>than I thought you would be, and much more stupid than</p>
<p>you have any right to be.’ Since the two younger partners</p>
<p>had been praising me to the skies each day, I was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>What is necessary to be effective in a new assignment</p>
<p>And then, the old gentleman said, ’I understand you did</p>
<p>very good securities analysis at the insurance company. But</p>
<p>if we had wanted you to do securities analysis work, we would</p>
<p>have left you where you were. You are now the executive</p>
<p>secretary to the partners yet you continue to do securities</p>
<p>analysis. What should you be doing now, to be effective in</p>
<p>your new job?’ I was furious, but still I realized that the old</p>
<p>man was right. I totally changed my behavior and my work.</p>
<p>Since then, when I have a new assignment, I ask myself the</p>
<p>question, ’What do I need to do now that I have a new assignment,</p>
<p>to be effective?’ Every time it is something different.</p>
<p>I have been a consultant, now, for fifty years. I have worked</p>
<p>with many organizations and in many countries. The greatest</p>
<p>waste of human resources in all the organizations I have</p>
<p>seen is the failed promotion. Of able people who are being</p>
<p>promoted and put into a new assignment, not many become</p>
<p>true successes. Quite a few are outright failures. A very much</p>
<p>larger number are neither successes nor failures, they become</p>
<p>mediocrities. A handful only are successes.</p>
<p>The reason for sudden incompetence</p>
<p>Why should people who, for ten or fifteen years have been</p>
<p>competent, suddenly become incompetent? The reason in</p>
<p>practically all cases I have seen, is that people do what I did,</p>
<p>sixty years ago in that London bank. They continue in their</p>
<p>new assignment to do what made them successful in the old</p>
<p>assignment and what earned them the promotion. Then they</p>
<p>turn incompetent, not because they have become incompetent,</p>
<p>but because they are doing the wrong things.</p>
<p>Requirement for success</p>
<p>For many years, I have made it my practice to ask those of</p>
<p>my clients who are truly effective people – and especially</p>
<p>those who are truly effective executives in large organizations</p>
<p>– to what they attribute their effectiveness. Practically</p>
<p>always, I am being told that they owe their success, as I do,</p>
<p>to a long–dead boss, who did what the old gentleman in London</p>
<p>did for me: force me to think through what the new</p>
<p>assignment requires. No–one, at least not within my experience,</p>
<p>discovers this for himself. You need someone to teach</p>
<p>you. Once one has learned that, one does not forget it, and</p>
<p>then – almost without exception – one is successful in the</p>
<p>new assignment. What it requires is not superior knowledge</p>
<p>or superior talent. It requires concentration on the things that</p>
<p>the new assignment requires, the things that are crucial to</p>
<p>the new challenge, the new job, the new task.</p>
<p>The sixth experience – taught by the Jesuits and the</p>
<p>Calvinists</p>
<p>Quite a few years later, around 1945, and after I had moved</p>
<p>from England to the US in 1937, I picked for my three–year</p>
<p>study subject early modern European history, and especially</p>
<p>the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There I found that two</p>
<p>European institutions had become the dominant forces in Europe:</p>
<p>The Jesuit Order in the Catholic South and the Calvin–</p>
<p>ist Church in the Protestant North. Both owed their success</p>
<p>to the same method. Both were founded independently, in</p>
<ol start="1536" type="1">
<li>Both from the very beginning adopted the same learning</li>
</ol>
<p>discipline.</p>
<p>Importance of writing down</p>
<p>Whenever a Jesuit priest or a Calvinist pastor does anything</p>
<p>of significance, for instance, making a key decision, he is</p>
<p>expected to write down what results he anticipates. Nine</p>
<p>months later, he then feeds back from the actual results to</p>
<p>these anticipations.</p>
<p>This very soon shows him what he did well and what his strengths are.
It also shows him what he</p>
<p>has to learn and what habits he has to change. Finally it shows</p>
<p>him what he is not gifted for and cannot do well. I have</p>
<p>followed this method for myself now for fifty years. It brings</p>
<p>out what one’s strengths are – and this is the most important</p>
<p>thing an individual can know about himself or herself. It brings</p>
<p>out where improvement is needed and what kind of improvement</p>
<p>is needed. Finally, it brings out what an individual cannot</p>
<p>do and therefore should not even try to do. To know</p>
<p>one’s strengths, to know how to improve them, and to know</p>
<p>what one cannot do – they are the keys to continuous learning.</p>
<p>The seventh experience – taught by Schumpeter</p>
<p>One more experience, and then I am through with the story</p>
<p>of my personal development. At Christmas 1949 – I had just</p>
<p>begun to teach management at New York University – my</p>
<p>father, then seventy three years old, came to visit us from</p>
<p>California, where he had retired a few years earlier. Right</p>
<p>after the New Year, on January 3, 1950, he and I went to visit</p>
<p>an old friend of his, the famous economist Joseph Schumpeter.</p>
<p>My father had already retired, but Schumpeter, then sixty six</p>
<p>and world–famous, was still teaching at Harvard and very</p>
<p>active as President of the American Economic Association.</p>
<p>In 1902 my father was a young civil servant in the Austrian</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance, but also did some teaching in economics</p>
<p>at the university. He had come to know Schumpeter, then at</p>
<p>age nineteen, the most brilliant of the young students. Two</p>
<p>more different people are hard to imagine: Schumpeter was</p>
<p>flamboyant, arrogant, abrasive, and vain; my father, quiet,</p>
<p>the soul of courtesy and modest to the point of being self–</p>
<p>effacing. Still the two became fast friends and remained fast</p>
<p>friends.</p>
<p>By 1949, Schumpeter had become a very different person.</p>
<p>Sixty six years old and in his last year of teaching at Harvard,</p>
<p>he was at the peak of his fame. The two old men had a wonderful</p>
<p>time together reminiscing about the old days. Both</p>
<p>had grown up and had worked in Austria, and both had</p>
<p>eventually come to America, Schumpeter in 1932 and my father,</p>
<p>four years later. Suddenly, my father asked with a</p>
<p>chuckle: ’Joseph, do you still talk about what you want to be</p>
<p>remembered for?’ Schumpeter broke out in loud laughter,</p>
<p>and even I laughed. For Schumpeter was notorious for hav–</p>
<p>ing said, when he was thirty or so and had published the first</p>
<p>two of his great economic books, that what he really wanted</p>
<p>to be remembered for was to have been ’Europe’s greatest</p>
<p>lover of beautiful women, and Europe’s greatest horseman –</p>
<p>and perhaps also as the world’s greatest economist.’</p>
<p>Schumpeter said, ’Yes, this question is still important to me,</p>
<p>but I now answer it differently. I want to be remembered as</p>
<p>having been the teacher who converted half a dozen brilliant</p>
<p>students into first–rate economists.</p>
<p>He must have seen an amazed look on my father’s face because</p>
<p>he continued,, ’You know, Adolph, I have now reached</p>
<p>the age where I know that being remembered for books and</p>
<p>theories is not enough. One does not make a difference unless</p>
<p>it is a difference in the lives of people.’ One reason my</p>
<p>father had gone to see Schumpeter was that it was known</p>
<p>that he was very sick and would not live long. Schumpeter</p>
<p>died five days after we had visited him.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten that conversation. I have learned from</p>
<p>it three things. First, one has to ask oneself what one wants</p>
<p>to be remembered for. Secondly, that should change as one</p>
<p>gets older. It should change both with one’s own maturity</p>
<p>and with the changes in the world. Finally, one thing worth</p>
<p>being remembered for is the difference one makes in the lives</p>
<p>of people.</p>
<p>The same things are learned by successful people</p>
<p>I am telling this long story for a simple reason. All the people</p>
<p>I know who have managed to remain effective during a long</p>
<p>life, have learned pretty much the same things I learned.</p>
<p>This applies to effective business executives and to scholars;</p>
<p>to top–ranking military people and to first–rate physicians; to</p>
<p>teachers and to artists. Whenever I work with a person, and</p>
<p>as a consultant I have been working of course with a great</p>
<p>many, in businesses, in governments, in universities, in
hospitals,</p>
<p>in opera houses, in symphony orchestras, in museums,</p>
<p>and so on I sooner or later try to find out to what the</p>
<p>individual attributes his or her success. I am invariably told</p>
<p>stories that are remarkably like mine.</p>
<p>Doing a few simple things</p>
<p>And so, to answer to the question, ’How can the individual,</p>
<p>and especially the individual in knowledge work maintainhis or her
effectiveness?’ would be: ’By</p>
<p>doing a few fairly simple things.’</p>
<p>The first one is to have the kind of goal or vision which</p>
<p>Verdi’s Falstaff gave me. To keep on striving means that one</p>
<p>matures but one does not age.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have found that the people who maintain their</p>
<p>effectiveness take the view Phidias took of his own work: the</p>
<p>Gods see it. They are not willing to do work that is only</p>
<p>average. They have respect for the integrity of their work. In</p>
<p>fact, they have self–respect.</p>
<p>The third thing these people all have in common: they build</p>
<p>continuous learning into the way they live. They may not do</p>
<p>what I have been doing for more than sixty years now, that</p>
<p>is, to become a student of a new discipline every three or</p>
<p>four years. They experiment. They are not satisfied with doing</p>
<p>what they did yesterday. The very least they demand of</p>
<p>themselves is that they do better, whatever they do, and more</p>
<p>often, they demand of themselves that they do it differently.</p>
<p>The people who keep themselves alive and growing also</p>
<p>build a review of their performance into their work. An
increasing</p>
<p>number, I have found, do what the Jesuits and Cal–</p>
<p>vinists of the sixteenth century first thought of. They keep a</p>
<p>record of the results of their actions and decisions, and compare</p>
<p>them with their expectations. Then they soon know what</p>
<p>their strengths are, but they also know ’what they have to</p>
<p>improve, to change, to learn. Finally they know what they</p>
<p>are not good at, and what they therefore should let other</p>
<p>people do.</p>
<p>Again and again, when I ask one of these effective people to</p>
<p>tell me the experiences that explains their success, I hear that</p>
<p>a long–dead teacher or a boss challenged them and taught</p>
<p>them that whenever one changes one’s work, one’s position,</p>
<p>one’s assignment, one thinks through what the new job, the</p>
<p>new position, the new assignment requires. Always it requires</p>
<p>something different from what the preceding job or</p>
<p>the preceding assignment required.</p>
<p>his or her effectiveness?’ would be: ’By doing a few fairly</p>
<p>simple things.’</p>
<p>The first one is to have the kind of goal or vision which</p>
<p>Verdi’s Falstaff gave me. To keep on striving means that one</p>
<p>matures but one does not age.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have found that the people who maintain their</p>
<p>effectiveness take the view Phidias took of his own work: the</p>

<p>their strengths are, but they also know ’what they have to</p>
<p>improve, to change, to learn. Finally they know what they</p>
<p>are not good at, and what they therefore should let other</p>
<p>people do.</p>
<p>Again and again, when I ask one of these effective people to</p>
<p>tell me the experiences that explains their success, I hear that</p>
<p>a long–dead teacher or a boss challenged them and taught</p>
<p>them that whenever one changes one’s work, one’s position,</p>
<p>one’s assignment, one thinks through what the new job, the</p>
<p>new position, the new assignment requires. Always it requires</p>
<p>something different from what the preceding job or</p>
<p>the preceding assignment required.</p>
<p>on growing and changing, take responsibility for their
development</p>
<p>and their placement.</p>
<p>This may be the most novel conclusion. And it may be the</p>
<p>one which is most difficult to apply in Japan. Today’s
organization,</p>
<p>whether it is a business, or a government agency, is</p>
<p>still based on the assumption that the organization is
responsible</p>
<p>for placing the individual and for providing the experiences</p>
<p>and challenges that the individual needs. The best example</p>
<p>of this I know is the personnel department in the typical,</p>
<p>large Japanese company, or the prototype on which it</p>
<p>has been modelled, or the personnel department in a traditional</p>
<p>army. I know no more responsible group of people</p>
<p>than those in the typical Japanese personnel department. Yet</p>
<p>they will, I think, have to learn to change. Instead of being</p>
<p>decision–makers they will have to become teachers, guides,</p>
<p>counselors, advisors. The responsibility for the development</p>
<p>of the individual knowledge worker, and for his or her placement,</p>
<p>will, I am convinced, have to be taken by the individual.</p>
<p>It will have to become very much the responsibility of</p>
<p>the individual to ask: What kind of assignment do I now</p>
<p>need? What kind of assignment am I now qualified for? What</p>
<p>kind of experience and what kind of knowledge and skill do</p>
<p>I now need to acquire? The decision of course, cannot be that</p>
<p>of the individual alone. It has to be made in contemplation of</p>
<p>the needs of the organization. It also has to be made on the</p>
<p>basis of an outside appraisal of the strengths, the competencies,</p>
<p>the performance of the individual.</p>
<p>Responsibility for development of the individual has to become</p>
<p>responsibility for self–development. Responsibility for</p>
<p>placing the individual has to become the responsibility for</p>
<p>self–placement. Otherwise, it is unlikely that knowledge people</p>
<p>can continue to remain effective and productive and capable</p>
<p>of growth over the long span of working–life we can</p>
<p>now expect.</p>

<h3 id="pursuing-perfection">Pursuing Perfection</h3>
<p>“The Gods can see them.”</p>
<p>The greatest sculptor of ancient Greece, Phidias, around 440 BC made
the</p>
<p>statues that to this day, 2,400 years later, still stand on the roof
of the Parthenon in</p>
<p>Athens. When Phidias submitted his bill, the city ac-</p>
<p>countant of Athens refused to pay it. “These statues stand on the
roof of</p>
<p>the temple, and on the highest hill in Athens. Nobody can see
anything</p>
<p>but their fronts. Yet, you have charged us for sculpturing them in
the</p>
<p>round, that is, for doing their backsides, which nobody can see.”
“You are</p>
<p>wrong,” Phidias retorted. “The Gods can see them.”</p>
<p>Whenever people ask me which of my books I consider the best, I</p>
<p>smile and say, “The next.” I do not, however, mean it as a joke. I
mean it</p>
<p>the way Verdi meant it when he talked of writing an opera at eighty
in the</p>
<p>pursuit of a perfection that had always eluded him. Though I am
older</p>
<p>now than Verdi was when he wrote Falstaff, I am still thinking
and</p>
<p>working on two additional books, each of which, I hope, will be
better</p>
<p>than any of my ear-lier ones, will be more important, and will
come</p>
<p>Alittle closer to excel-lence.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-1">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Pursue perfection in your work, however elusive.</p>
