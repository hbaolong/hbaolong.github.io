<p>你为什么找不到男朋友</p>
<p>我有一个群，群里人不多，有男有女，有已婚的，有未婚的，未婚的大多没有男朋友。</p>
<p>这里群里讨论的话题很飘逸，每天都在各个话题之间切换。只是有一个特色：很多话题都会以单身女</p>
<p>生的世纪之问结尾：我为什么找不到男朋友。</p>
<p>这确实是一个世纪之问，我们每一次线下活动，只好进入开放交流阶段，不管是讨论宏观经济，还是</p>
<p>讨论健身、美食，最后都会不由自主地进入一个话题：为什么那么多女生单身。</p>
<p>是呀，为什么那么多女生单身呢？按国家宏观数据，同龄的男生比女生多，按这个逻辑，应该是大把</p>
<p>的男生找不到女朋友才对呀。为什么身边什么乱七八糟的男生都不缺女朋友，而很多即使很优秀的女</p>
<p>生也是孑孑茕立、形影相吊？</p>
<p>是他们经济条件好了，不愿意找么？好像也不是，有些女生甚至会花一些钱去相亲网站去找对象，也</p>
<p>会让朋友介绍，也会接受朋友的介绍。</p>
<p>可是，现实就是，她们还是单着，而且，看起来会一直单下去。</p>
<p>为什么呢？</p>
<p>有一次我问一个女生，女生是81年的，容颜姣好，我见犹怜。我问她：“你要找什么样的男朋友呀？”</p>
<p>这个女生回答说：“男的，活的”。</p>
<p>太模糊了，我又追问：“说具体点，这样的人太多了！”</p>
<p>然后她脱口而出：“活的有男人样的”。</p>
<p>我看了看她，沉默了。</p>
<p>有一个91年的女生，有一次和我聊一个事情。聊完后，她突然和我讲她的故事，她在世纪佳缘上的故</p>
<p>事。她在讲故事时一副委屈的样子。她说，我已经设置了很严格的过滤条件呀，世纪佳缘老给我推荐</p>
<p>一些很垃圾的男人，我觉得他们就想骗我的钱。</p>
<p>我说，你都设置了什么条件呀。她说，有年龄、学历、收入、身高等等等。</p>
<p>我问她：“有性别么？”</p>
<p>她瞪了我一眼，走了。</p>
<p>很早以前，我也会用QQ聊天，QQ聊天可以搜陌生人，我们搜模式人时，可以用一些过滤条件：城</p>
<p>市、性别、是否有摄像头、年龄等等等等。男生喜欢的一个游戏，就是通过这些过滤条件加一些人，</p>
<p>然后聊天。据说，这样可以很快交到朋友。</p>
<p>之后的社交软件也基本是这样一个套路：通过一堆条件来过滤，最后选出“最适合你的朋友”，让你们</p>
<p>去交朋友。</p>
<p>这时一个大数据时代，微信的日活已经超过10亿了，各种社交软件也都是上亿的数据，作为一个女</p>
<p>生，作为一个随时可以访问上亿社交数据的女生，作为一个可以随时通过过滤条件选出几百万人的一</p>
<p>个女生，居然找不到合适的人。</p>
<p>这些女生，每每刷半天这种社交（婚恋）软件后，就扔到一边，找个地方去抱怨自己的单身，自己的</p>
<p>孤独。</p>
<p>好像那个日活10亿的微信都没法给自己提供一个自己理想的男朋友。</p>
<p>这是为什么呢？</p>
<p>男朋友，指的是有恋爱关系的男性朋友，通常是对女生讲的。正常来说，对于一个女生，只要是男</p>
<p>生，就可以做男朋友。在没有大数据之前，我们通过肉眼来判断：这个人还不错。</p>
<p>在接触中，我们会逐渐发现，原来他还是个大学生，原来他还是一个学霸，原来他抽烟，原来他英语</p>
<p>很好，他生在海边居然不会游泳……</p>
<p>在一天天接触中，我们逐渐了解，然后两个人或者结婚，或者分手，至少谈了一次恋爱。</p>
<p>现在有了大数据，我们可以在几万、几十万、几百万、几千万、几亿人中选择一个人，这时，你就会</p>
<p>设置一些条件：不抽烟、不喝酒、身高不低于180、硕士以上学历、985等等等等。</p>
<p>女生的每一个条件都有很多道理，问题时，这些条件真的有意义么？</p>
<p>这些条件真的有意义么？</p>
<p>抽烟影响你婚姻的幸福么？</p>
<p>身高会影响你婚姻的幸福么？</p>
<p>985毕业，会影响你婚姻的幸福么？</p>
<p>这些条件有意义的可能性有多大？</p>
<p>“我不希望我的孩子太矮，所以我要求对方要高一些”</p>
<p>“我希望对方可以教孩子一些学科，所以希望对方985学校毕业”</p>
<p>这些和爱情、婚姻都无关地铁条件，真的是你想要的么？</p>
<p>大数据可以轻松为我们选择出任何条件的人，而真正的问题是，当你提出哪些无意义的问题时，你其</p>
<p>实在心中种下了一个不可能。</p>
<p>你需要的其实只是恋爱、结婚，如果你的目的是这样的，那么你应该做的是，看到那个你喜欢的男</p>
<p>生，走过去，然后说：“你好，我可以坐在你身边么？”</p>
<p>然后慢慢了解他。 而不是相反。</p>

<p>Controls, Control, and Management</p>
<p>The probability of an event’s being meaningful is a much more
important datum than the event</p>
<p>itself.</p>
<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business and in other social</p>
<p>institutions, based on a great improvement in techniques, especially
the ability to process and</p>
<p>analyze large masses of data very fast. What does this mean for
“control”? Especially, what are the</p>
<p>requirements for these greatly improved controls to give better
control to management? For, in the</p>
<p>task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end; the end is
control. If we deal with a</p>
<p>human being in a social insti-tution, controls must become personal
motivation that leads to</p>
<p>control. A translation is required before the information yielded by
the controls can become</p>
<p>grounds for action—the translation of one kind of information into
another, which we call</p>
<p>perception. In the social institution there is a second complexity, a
second “uncertainty principle.” It</p>
<p>is almost impossi-ble to prefigure the responses appropriate to a
certain event in a social situation.</p>
<p>But a control-reading “profits are falling” does not indicate, with
any de-gree of probability, the</p>
<p>response “raise prices,” let alone by how much; the control-reading
“sales are falling” does not</p>
<p>indicate the response “cut prices,” and so on. The event itself may
not even be meaningful. But</p>
<p>even if it is, it is by no means certain what it means.</p>

<p>Controls, Control, and Management</p>
<p>Controls and Control—The Characteristics of Controls—Controls Are
Goal-Setting and Value-Setting—Controls</p>
<p>Needed for Measurable and for Nonmeasurable Events—The Specification
for Controls—Economy—Meaning—</p>
<p>Controls Follow
Strategy—Appropriateness—Congruence—Timeliness—Simplicity—Controls Must
Be Operational—</p>
<p>The Ultimate Control of Organizations—Controls and the Spirit of an
Organization</p>
<p>N THE DICTIONARY OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, the word “controls” is not
the plural of the word “control.” Not only do</p>
<p>more controls not necessarily give more con- trol, the two words, in
the context of social institutions, have different</p>
<p>meanings alto- gether. The synonyms for controls are measurement and
information. The synonym for control is</p>
<p>direction. Controls pertain to means, control to an end. Controls
deal with facts, that is, with events of the past.</p>
<p>Control deals with expectations, that is, with the future. Controls
are analytical, concerned with what was and is.</p>
<p>Control is normative and concerned with what ought to be.</p>
<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business and in other so- cial institutions, based on a</p>
<p>great improvement in techniques, especially in the application of
logical and mathematical tools to events in a social</p>
<p>institution, and in the ability to process and analyze large masses
of data very fast. What does this mean for control?</p>
<p>Spe- cifically, what are the requirements for these greatly improved
controls to give better con- trol to management?</p>
<p>For, in the task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end;
the end is control.</p>
<p>Ordinary language and its use make abundantly clear that here is a
problem. The man in a business who is charged</p>
<p>with producing the controls is the controller. But most, if not all
executives, including most controllers themselves,</p>
<p>would consider it gross misuse and abuse of controllership were this
controller to use his controls to exercise control</p>
<p>in the business. This, they would argue, would actually make the
business be “out of control” altogether.</p>
<p>The reasons for this apparent paradox lie in the complexity both of
human beings and of the social task.</p>
<p>If we deal with a human being in a social institution, controls must
become personal motivation that leads to control.</p>
<p>Instead of a mechanical system, the control system in a human-social
situation is a volitional system. That we know</p>
<p>very little about the will is not even the central point. A
translation is required before the information yielded by the</p>
<p>controls can become grounds for action—the translation of one kind of
information into another, which we call</p>
<p>perception.</p>
<p>In the social institution there is a second complexity, a second
“uncertainty principle.” It is almost impossible to</p>
<p>prefigure the responses appropriate to a certain event in a social
situation.</p>
<p>We can, and do, build controls into a machine which slow down the
turning speed whenever it exceeds a certain figure.</p>
<p>And we can do this either by mechanical means or by instrumentation
which shows a human operator what the turning</p>
<p>speed is, and which gives him the specific, unambiguous instruction
to turn the speed down when the indicator</p>
<p>reaches a certain point. But a control-reading “profits are falling”
does not indicate, with any degree of probability, the</p>
<p>response “raise prices,” let alone by how much; the control- reading
“sales are falling” does not indicate the response</p>
<p>“cut prices,” and so on. There is not only a large number of other
equally probable responses—so large that it is usually</p>
<p>not even possible to identify them in advance—there is also no
indication in the event itself which of these responses</p>
<p>is even possible, let alone appropriate, not to mention its being
right. The event itself may not even be meaningful. But</p>
<p>even if it is, it is by no means certain what it means. And the
probability of its being meaningful is a much more</p>
<p>important datum than the event itself and one which is almost never
to be discerned by analyzing the event.</p>
<p>Social situations require a decision based on assumptions—and
essentially assump- tions not with respect to the</p>
<p>recorded event but to the future, that is, expectations which know no
probability but can only be judged according to</p>
<p>plausibility. For there are no “facts” regarding the future in a
social universe in which periodicity—at least on our minuscule time
scale—cannot be assumed, must indeed be considered quite unlikely.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Controls</p>
<p>There are three major characteristics of controls in business
enterprise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Controls can be neither objective nor neutral. When we measure the
rate of fall of a stone, we are totally outside the</li>
</ol>
<p>event itself. By measuring we do not change the event; and measuring
the event does not change us, the observers.</p>
<p>Measuring physical phenom- ena is both objective and neutral.</p>
<p>In a perceptual situation of complexity, that is, in any social
situation of the kind we deal with in business enterprise,</p>
<p>the act of measurement is, however, neither objective nor neutral. It
is subjective and of necessity biased. It changes</p>
<p>both the event and the ob- server. For it changes the perception of
the observer—if it does not altogether create his</p>
<p>perception. Events in the social situation acquire value by the fact
that they are being sin- gled out for the attention of</p>
<p>being measured. No matter how “scientific” we are, the fact that this
or that set of phenomena is singled out for being</p>
<p>“controlled,” signals that it is being considered to be
important.</p>
<p>Everybody who ever watched the introduction of a budget system has
seen this hap- pen. For a long time—in some</p>
<p>companies forever—realizing the budget figures becomes more important
than what the budget is supposed to</p>
<p>measure, namely economic perform- ance. Managers, upon first being
exposed to</p>
<p>a budget system, often deliberately hold back sales and cut back
profits rather than be guilty of “not making the</p>
<p>budget.” It takes years of experience and a very intelligent budget
director to restore the balance. And there are any</p>
<p>number of otherwise perfectly normal research directors who act on
the conviction that it is a greater crime to get</p>
<p>research results for less than the budgeted amount than not getting
any research results at all while spending all the</p>
<p>“proper” budget money.</p>
<p>Controls in a social institution such as a business are goal-setting
and value-setting. They are not “objective.” They are</p>
<p>of necessity moral. The only way to avoid this is to flood the
executive with so many controls that the entire system</p>
<p>becomes meaningless, becomes mere “noise.”</p>
<p>From that point of view maybe the gross abuse of our new
data-processing capacity, namely as a tool for grinding out</p>
<p>huge quantities of totally meaningless data—an abuse of which every
early computer user is guilty—may be a blessing</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>But to render controls harmless by rendering them meaningless is
hardly the right way to use our capacity to provide</p>
<p>controls. This must start out with the realization that con- trols
create vision. They change both the events measured</p>
<p>and the observer. They endow</p>
<p>events not only with meaning but with value. And this means that the
basic question is not “How do we control?” but</p>
<p>“What do we measure in our control system?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls need to focus on results. Business (and every other social
institution) ex- ists to contribute to society,</li>
</ol>
<p>economy, and individual. In consequence results in business exist
only on the outside—in economy, in society, and with</p>
<p>the customer. It is the cus- tomer only who creates a “profit.”
Everything inside a business—manufacturing, marketing, research, and so
on—creates only costs, is only a “cost center.”</p>
<p>In other words, the managerial area is concerned with costs alone.
But results are en- trepreneurial.</p>
<p>Yet we do not have adequate, let alone reliable, information
regarding the “outside.” It is not only by far the hardest to</p>
<p>get—to the point where no organization for the acquisi- tion and
collection of meaningful outside information could</p>
<p>really be set up—the job is much too big. Above all we still lack
necessary entrepreneurial concepts. The job itself has</p>
<p>never been thought through—at least not so far. And the century of
patient analysis of managerial, inside phenomena,</p>
<p>events and data, the century of patient, skillful work on the
individual operations and tasks within the business, has no</p>
<p>counterpart with respect to the entrepreneurial job.</p>
<p>We can easily record and therefore quantify efficiency, that is,
efforts. We have very few instruments to record and</p>
<p>quantify effects, that is, the outside. But even the most effi- cient
buggywhip manufacturer would no longer be in business. It is of little
value to have</p>
<p>the most efficient engineering department if it designs the wrong
product. The Cuban sub- sidiaries of U.S. companies</p>
<p>were by far the best run and, apparently, the most profit- able—let
alone the least “troublesome”—of all U.S.</p>
<p>operations in Latin America. This was, however, irrelevant to their
expropriation. And it mattered little, I daresay, during</p>
<p>the period of IBM’s great expansion in the fifties and sixties how
“efficient” its operations were; its basic</p>
<p>entrepreneurial idea was the right, the effective one.</p>
<p>The outside, the area of results, is much less accessible than the
inside. The central problem of the executive in the</p>
<p>large organization is his—necessary—insulation from the outside. This
applies to the president of the United States as</p>
<p>well as to the president of United States Steel. What today’s
organization therefore needs are synthetic sense</p>
<p>organs for the outside. If modern controls are to make a
contribution, it would be, above all, here.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls are needed for measurable and non-measurable events.
Business, like any other institution, has important</li>
</ol>
<p>results that are incapable of being measured. Any experi- enced
executive knows companies or industries which are</p>
<p>bound for extinction because</p>
<p>they cannot attract or hold able people. This, every experienced
executive also knows, is a more important fact about</p>
<p>a company or an industry than last year’s profit statement. Any
logical positivist who were to tell an executive that this</p>
<p>statement, being incapable of un- ambiguous definition, is a
“non-statement” dealing with a “non-problem,” would be</p>
<p>quickly—and correctly—dismissed as an ass. Yet the statement cannot
be defined clearly let alone “quantified.” It is</p>
<p>anything but “intangible”; it is very “tangible” indeed (as any- one
ever having to do with such a business quickly finds</p>
<p>out). It is just non-measurable. And measurable results will not show
up for a decade.</p>
<p>But business also has measurable and quantifiable results of true
meaning and signifi- cance. These are all those that</p>
<p>have to do with past economic performance. For these can be expressed
in terms of the very peculiar measurement of</p>
<p>the economic sphere, money.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these are “tangibles.” Indeed most of the
things we can meas- ure by money are so totally</p>
<p>“intangible”—take depreciation for instance—that they outdo any
Platonic Idea in that nothing corresponds to them in</p>
<p>any reality whatever. But they are measurable.</p>
<p>To this comes the fact that the measurable results are things that
happened; they are in the past. There are no facts</p>
<p>about the future. To this comes, second, the fact that the measurable
events are primarily inside events rather than</p>
<p>outside events. The important developments on the outside, the things
which determine that the buggy-whip industry</p>
<p>disappears and that IBM becomes a big business—let alone that Cuban
subsidiaries of American companies are</p>
<p>confiscated—are not measurable until it is too late to have con-
trol.</p>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the non-measurable is therefore
a central and constant problem of</p>
<p>management and a true decision area.</p>
<p>Measurements which do not spell out the assumptions with respect to
the non- measurable statements that are being</p>
<p>made—at least as parameters or as restraints— misdirect therefore.
They actually misinform. Yet the more we can</p>
<p>quantify the truly measurable areas, the greater the temptation to
put all-out emphasis on those—the greater,</p>
<p>therefore, the danger that what looks like better controls will
actually mean less control if not a business out of</p>
<p>control altogether.</p>
<p>Specifications for Controls</p>
<p>To give the manager control, controls must satisfy seven
specifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Control is a principle of economy. The less effort needed to gain
control, the better the control design. The fewer</li>
</ol>
<p>controls needed, the more effective they will be. Indeed, adding more
controls does not give better control. All it does</p>
<p>is create confusion.</p>
<p>The first question the manager therefore needs to ask in designing or
in using a system of controls is “What is the mini</p>
<p>mum information I need to know to have control?”</p>
<p>The answer may vary for different managers. The company’s treasurer
needs only to know the total amount invested in</p>
<p>inventories and whether it is going up or down. The sales manager
needs to know the half a dozen products and</p>
<p>product lines which together account for 70 percent of inventory, and
those in considerable detail. But total inventory</p>
<p>amount is not of primary importance to him. And both the treasurer
and the sales manager do not, as a rule, need</p>
<p>complete inventory figures except once or twice a year; a fairly
small sample should give them all the information they</p>
<p>need in between. But the ware- house clerk needs daily figures—and in
detail.</p>
<p>The capacity of the computer to spew out huge masses of data does not
make for bet- ter controls. On the contrary,</p>
<p>what gives control is first the question “What is the smallest number
of reports and statistics needed to understand a</p>
<p>phenomenon and to be able to anticipate it?” And then one asks, “And
what is the minimum of data regarding this phenomenon that gives a
reasonably reliable picture?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Controls must be meaningful. That means that the events to be
measured must be significant either in themselves,</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g., market standing, or they must be symptoms of at least
potentially significant developments, e.g., a sudden sharp</p>
<p>rise in labor turnover or absenteeism.</p>
<p>Trivia should never be measured. One has control by controlling a few
developments</p>
<p>which can have significant impact on performance and results. One
loses control by trying to control the infinity of</p>
<p>events which are marginal to performance and results.</p>
<p>Controls should always be related to the key objectives and to the
priorities within them, to “key activities” and to</p>
<p>“conscience areas” (see Chapter 42). Controls should, in other words,
be based on a company’s definition of what our</p>
<p>business is, what it will be, and what it should be.</p>
<p>Controls Follow Strategy</p>
<p>Whatever is not essential to the attainment of a company’s objectives
should be measured infrequently and only to</p>
<p>prevent deterioration. It should be strictly controlled by “excep-
tion,” that is, a standard should be set, measurement</p>
<p>should be periodical and on a sample basis; and only significant
shortfalls below the established standard should even</p>
<p>be re- ported, let alone paid attention to.</p>
<p>That we can quantify something is no reason for measuring it. The
question is “Is this</p>
<p>what a manager should consider important?” “Is this what a manager’s
attention should be focused on?” “Is this a true</p>
<p>statement of the basic realities of the enterprise?” “Is this the
proper focus for control, that is, for effective direction</p>
<p>with maximum economy of ef- fort?”</p>
<p>If these questions are not being asked in designing controls, we will
end up by making business essentially</p>
<p>uncontrolled—for then we will simply have no remedy except to pro-
liferate control information to the point where it</p>
<p>does not register at all.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be appropriate to the character and nature of the
phenomena measured. This may well be the most</li>
</ol>
<p>important specification; yet it is least observed in the actual
design of controls.</p>
<p>Because controls have such an impact it is not only important that we
select the right ones. To enable controls to give</p>
<p>right vision and to become the ground for effective ac- tion, the
measurement must also be appropriate. That is, it</p>
<p>must present the events meas- ured in structurally true form. Formal
validity is not enough.</p>
<p>Formal complaints, that is, grievances, coming out of a work force
are commonly re- ported as “five grievances per</p>
<p>thousand employees per month.” This is formally valid. But is it
structurally valid? Or is it misdirection? The impression</p>
<p>this report conveys is, first, that grievances are distributed
throughout the work force in a random manner. They follow,</p>
<p>the report seems to say, a U-shaped Gaussian distribution. And
second—a conclu- sion from the first impression—they</p>
<p>are a minor problem, especially if we deal with five grievances per
thousand employees per month. This, while formally</p>
<p>valid, completely misrepresents and misinforms, let alone
misdirects.</p>
<p>Grievances are a social event. Physical nature knows no such
phenomena. And social events are almost never</p>
<p>distributed in the “normal distribution” we find in the physical
world. The normal distribution of social events is almost</p>
<p>always exponential—with the</p>
<p>hyperbola the typical curve. In other words, the great majority of
departments in the plant, employing 95 percent of</p>
<p>the work force, normally does not have even a single grievance during
one year. But in one department, employing</p>
<p>only a handful of men, we have a heavy incidence of grievances—</p>
<p>so that the “five per thousand” may well mean (and in the actual
example from which I took these figures, did mean) a</p>
<p>major grievance per man per year. If this department is then the
final assembly through which all the production has to</p>
<p>pass, and if the workers in this department go out on strike when
their grievances are being neglected by a management which has been
misled by its own controls, the impact can be shattering. It</p>
<p>bankrupted the company, which is no longer in existence.</p>
<p>Similarly, 90 percent of the volume of a business is usually
represented by 2 to 5 per cent of the number of its</p>
<p>products. But 90 percent of the orders by number cover, typi- cally,
only 4 or 5 percent of the volume—but account for</p>
<p>90 percent and more of the costs. A modern strategic bomber may have
a million parts. But 90 percent of its cost is</p>
<p>represented by a very small number of parts, maybe fifty or so—and so
is 90 percent of the upkeep it needs, though,</p>
<p>unfortunately, the 90 percent of the dollars and the 90 per- cent of
the upkeep needs rarely comprise the same parts.</p>
<p>Practically all the innovations in a research laboratory, no matter
how large, come out of the work of a very small</p>
<p>percentage of the research people. And invariably, 80 percent of a
company’s distributors move, at best, 20 percent of</p>
<p>its output, while 10 percent or fewer of the distributors move
two-thirds to three-quarters of total sales.</p>
<p>Most measurements of sales performance, whether of the entire sales
force or of the individual salesman, report sales</p>
<p>in total dollars. But in many businesses this is an inap- propriate
figure. The same dollar volume of sales may mean a</p>
<p>substantial profit, no profit at all, or a sizable loss—dependent on
the product mix sold. An absolute sales figure</p>
<p>not related to product mix, therefore, gives no control
whatever—neither to the individual salesman, nor to the sales</p>
<p>manager, nor to top management.</p>
<p>These are elementary things. Yet few managers seem to know them. The
traditional information systems, especially</p>
<p>accounting, conceal appropriateness rather than highlight it. (In
particular the allocation of overhead tends to obscure</p>
<p>the true distribution of eco- nomic and social phenomena.)</p>
<p>Without controls that bring out clearly what the real structure of
events is, the manager not only lacks knowledge. He</p>
<p>will tend to do the wrong things. For all the weight of the daily
work pushes him toward allocating energies and</p>
<p>resources in proportion to the num- ber of events. There is a
constant drift toward putting energies and resources</p>
<p>where they can have the least results, that is, on the vast number of
phenomena which, together, ac- count for</p>
<p>practically no effects.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Measurements have to be congruent with the events measured. Alfred
North Whitehead (1851-1947), the</li>
</ol>
<p>distinguished logician and philosopher, used to warn against the
“danger of the false concreteness.” A measurement</p>
<p>does not become more “accurate” by being worked out to the sixth
decimal when the phenomenon measured is at</p>
<p>best capa- ble of being verified within a range of, say, 50 to 70
percent (and that, presumably, with an error of plus or</p>
<p>minus 20 percent). This is “false concreteness,” gross inaccuracy in
reality, and misleading.</p>
<p>It is an important piece of information that this or that phenomenon
cannot be meas- ured with precision but can be</p>
<p>described only within a range or as a magnitude. To say “we have 26
percent of the market” sounds reassuringly</p>
<p>precise. But it is usually so inac- curate a statement as to be
virtually meaningless. What it really means, as a rule, is</p>
<p>“we are not the dominant factor in the market, but we are not
marginal either.” And even then the statement is no more</p>
<p>reliable than the definition of the market which underlies it.</p>
<p>It is up to the manager to think through what kind of measurement is
congruent to the phenomenon it is meant to</p>
<p>measure. He has to know when “approximate” is more accu- rate than a
firmlooking figure worked out in great detai1. He has to know when a
range is more accurate than even an approximate</p>
<p>single figure. He has to know that “larger” and “smaller,” “earlier”
and “later,” “up” and “down” are quantitative terms</p>
<p>and often more accurate, indeed more rigorous, than any specific
figures or range of figures.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Controls have to be timely. The time dimension of controls is very
similar to their congruence. Again frequent</li>
</ol>
<p>measurements and very rapid “reporting back” do not neces- sarily
give better control. Indeed they may frustrate</p>
<p>control. The time dimension of con- trols has to correspond to the
time span of the event measured.</p>
<p>It has lately become fashionable to talk of “real time” controls,
that is, of controls that inform instantaneously and</p>
<p>continuously. There are events where “real time” controls are highly
desirable. If a batch of antibiotics in the</p>
<p>fermentation tank spoils as soon as tem- perature or pressure deviate
from a very narrow range for more than a</p>
<p>moment or two, “real time” monitoring on a continuous basis is
obviously needed. But few events need such controls.</p>
<p>And most cannot be controlled at all by them. “Real time” is the
wrong time span for real control.</p>
<p>Children planting a garden are so impatient, it is said, that they
tend to pull out the radishes as soon as their leaves</p>
<p>show, to see whether the root is forming. This is “real time”
control—misapplied.</p>
<p>When a new product is being first introduced, the product manager may
want and need daily reports from the test</p>
<p>markets, and as close to “real time” as possible. Six months later,
when he has worked out his promotion and selling</p>
<p>strategy, daily reports in “real time” can only lead him into
“pulling up the radish to see whether the root is form-</p>
<p>ing.” He then needs to think through at what periods of time and in
what areas he has to attain what results to be able</p>
<p>to achieve his objectives. And then he has to pay the greatest
attention to the measurement of results at their crucial</p>
<p>moments in time. If he, however, worries about “real time” daily
measurements, he is almost bound to confuse himself</p>
<p>and his associates and to muddle even the best strategy. Similarly,
the attempt to measure re- search progress all the</p>
<p>time is likely to confound research results. The proper time span for
research is a fairly long one. Once every two or</p>
<p>three years research progress and re- search results should be
rigorously appraised. In between an experienced</p>
<p>manager keeps in touch. He watches for any indication of major
unexpected trouble, and, even more, for any sign of</p>
<p>unexpected breakthroughs. But to monitor research in “real time”—as
some research labs have been trying to do—is</p>
<p>pulling up the radishes.</p>
<p>However, there is also the opposite danger—that of not measuring
often enough. It is particularly great with</p>
<p>developments that (a) take a fairly long time to have results,
and</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>have to come together at a point in the future to produce the
desired end result.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Controls need to be simple. Every major New York commercial bank
worked in the sixties on developing internal</li>
</ol>
<p>controls, especially of costs and of allocation of efforts. Everyone
spent a great deal of time and money on the task</p>
<p>and came up with voluminous control manuals. In only one of the banks
are the manuals being used, to the best of my</p>
<p>knowledge. When the executive in that bank was asked how he explained
this, he did not (as his interviewer expected</p>
<p>him to) credit a massive training program or talk about his
“philosophy.” He said instead, “I have two teen-age</p>
<p>daughters. They know nothing about banking and are not terribly good
at figures. But they are bright. Whenever I had</p>
<p>worked out an approach to controlling an activity, I took my intended
procedure home in draft form and asked my girls</p>
<p>to let me explain it to them. And only when I had it so simple that
they could explain back to me what the procedure</p>
<p>intended to accomplish and how, did I go ahead. Only then was it
simple enough.”</p>
<p>Complicated controls do not work. They confuse. They misdirect from
what is to be controlled toward attention on the</p>
<p>mechanics and methodology of the control. But if the user has to know
how the control works before he can apply it,</p>
<p>he has no control at all. And if he has to sit down and figure out
what a measurement means, he has no control either.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bank executive’s method is a pretty good one. Training
sessions in using a new control rarely accomplish</p>
<p>much. Ask the intended user to explain its purpose and its use. And
when he stumbles over complexities, ambiguities,</p>
<p>or subtleties, redesign for simplicity.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, controls must be operational. They must be focused on
action. Action rather than information is their purpose.</p>
<p>The action may be only study and analysis. In other words, a
measurement may say, “What goes on we don’t</p>
<p>understand; but something</p>
<p>goes on that needs to be understood.” But it should never just say,
“Here is something you might find interesting.”</p>
<p>This then means that controls—whether reports, studies, or
figures—must always reach the person who is capable of</p>
<p>taking controlling action. Whether they should reach anyone else—and
especially someone higher up—is debatable.</p>
<p>But their prime addressee is the manager or professional who can take
action by virtue of his position in the flow of</p>
<p>work and in the decision structure. And this further means that the
measurement must be in a form that is suitable for</p>
<p>the recipient and tailored to his needs.</p>
<p>Workers and first-line supervisors should, as said earlier (Chapter
18) receive meas- urements and control information</p>
<p>that enable them to direct their own immediate efforts toward results
they can control. Instead, typically, the first-line</p>
<p>supervisor receives each month a statement of the quality control
results for the entire plant—and the worker</p>
<p>re- ceives nothing.</p>
<p>And top management usually receives the information and measurements
operating middle managers need and can</p>
<p>use, and little or nothing of pertinence to their own top- management
job.</p>
<p>The reason for this is largely a confusion between control as
domination of others and control as rational behavior.</p>
<p>Unless controls are means toward the latter, and this means toward
self-control, they lead to wrong action. They are</p>
<p>“mis-control.”</p>
<p>The Ultimate Control of Organizations</p>
<p>There is one more important thing to be said. There is a fundamental,
incurable, basic limitation to controls in a social</p>
<p>institution. This lies in the fact that a social institution is both
a true entity and a fiction. As an entity it has purposes of</p>
<p>its own, a performance of its own, results of its own—and survival
and death of its own. These are the areas of which</p>
<p>we have been speaking so far. But a social institution is comprised
of persons, each with his own purpose, his own</p>
<p>ambitions, his own ideas, his own needs. No matter how authoritarian
the institution, it has to satisfy the ambitions and</p>
<p>needs of its members, and do so in their capacity as individuals but
through institutional rewards and punishments,</p>
<p>incentives, and deterrents. The expression of this may be
quantifiable—such as a raise in salary. But the system itself</p>
<p>is not quantitative in character and cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>Yet here is the real control of the institution, that is, the ground
of behavior and the cause of action. People act as they</p>
<p>are being rewarded or punished. For this, to them, rightly (as said
earlier in Chapter 36), is the true expression of the</p>
<p>values of the institution and of its true, as against its professed,
purpose and role.</p>
<p>A system of controls which is not in conformity with this true, this
only effective, this</p>
<p>ultimate control of the organization which lies in its people
decisions will therefore at best be ineffectual. At worst it</p>
<p>will cause never-ending conflict and will push the organization out
of control.</p>
<p>In designing controls for an organization one has to understand and
analyze the actual control of the business, its</p>
<p>people decisions. Otherwise one designs a system of controls</p>
<p>which does not lead to control. One has to realize that even the most
powerful “instrument board” complete with</p>
<p>computers, operations research, and simulation, is secondary to the
invisible, qualitative control of any human</p>
<p>organization, its systems of rewards and pun- ishments, of values and
taboos.</p>

<h3 id="controls-control-and-management">Controls, Control, and
Management</h3>
<p>The probability of an event’s being meaningful</p>
<p>is a much more important datum than the event itself.</p>
<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business</p>
<p>and in other social institutions, based on a great improvement in
techniques,</p>
<p>especially the ability to process and analyze large masses of data
very fast.</p>
<p>What does this mean for “control”? Especially, what are the
requirements for</p>
<p>these greatly improved controls to give better control to management?
For, in</p>
<p>the task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end; the end
is</p>
<p>control. If we deal with a human being in a social insti-tution,
controls must</p>
<p>become personal motivation that leads to control. A translation is
required</p>
<p>before the information yielded by the controls can become grounds for
action</p>
<p>—the translation of one kind of information into another, which we
call</p>
<p>perception. In the social institution there is a second complexity, a
second</p>
<p>“uncertainty principle.” It is almost impossi-ble to prefigure the
responses</p>
<p>appropriate to a certain event in a social situ-</p>
<p>ation.</p>
<p>But a control-reading “profits are falling” does not indicate, with
any</p>
<p>de-gree of probability, the response “raise prices,” let alone by how
much;</p>
<p>the control-reading “sales are falling” does not indicate the
response “cut</p>
<p>prices,” and so on. The event itself may not even be meaningful. But
even</p>
<p>if it is, it is by no means certain what it means.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-1">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Review each of the performance measures you use to</p>
<p>manage your organization. Eliminate each of those measures that is
not</p>
<p>meaningful to the results of the organization.</p>
