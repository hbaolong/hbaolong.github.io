<p>我有个朋友是开餐馆的，重庆人，餐馆开的普普通通，不算好也不算坏，拖拖延延，也开了近10年</p>
<p>了。有一次和他聊饭店，他和我说了几个和我常识都不同的感悟。</p>
<p>首先是，一定要开在饭店多的地方，哪怕在火锅店边上开火锅店也比在周围没有饭店的地方开饭店</p>
<p>好。他的理由是，只有有祖国多的饭店，才会吸引大家下意识地过来，如果只有你一家饭店，那么，</p>
<p>你就需要做的足够的好，让大家愿意为你而过来。</p>
<p>第二个感悟就是，如果一个地方连续两家饭店都经营不好，那么你不要接手做第三家。因为，不管那</p>
<p>个地方多么适合做餐饮，既然有连续两个（批）人做砸了，那就说明它一定有做砸的理由。虽然我们</p>
<p>不一定能看出来，不过，既然做这个生意要用自己钱，还是躲开点，不要用钱去验证这个问题。</p>
<p>很久很久以前，我们行业（网络）里有一个公司叫做Fortinet，这个公司刚进中国。我朋友有机会成为</p>
<p>了他们的销售总监。我朋友是一个很优秀的销售总监，在几个同业大公司有过经历，而且有丰富的渠</p>
<p>道资源，这是这个行业必备的。</p>
<p>结果，没几个月，我朋友就被辞退了。辞退的一个主要原因就是渠道管理混乱，产品被各种倾销，价</p>
<p>格完全失控。</p>
<p>新的销售总监上台了就着手解决这个问题，没几个月又被辞退了。因为价格仍然失控。</p>
<p>就这样，在一年时间了，Fortinet先后更换了6个销售总监，这些销售总监都有良好的教育、工作背</p>
<p>景，以及良好的过往职业经历。然而，在这个职位上都失利了。</p>
<p>后来，Fortinet调整了公司的运营战略，不再要求集成商压货了。而且找了一个资金雄厚的经销商解决</p>
<p>压货的问题。各个集成商手里都没有了设备，价格也就控制住了。</p>
<p>有趣的事，我那个朋友拿着辞退的违约金玩了两个月后，再次被Fortinet公司招入，任新的销售总监。</p>
<p>这次任期长了很多。</p>
<p>这种职位，这种在企业大战略，或者各种综合因素下互为悖论的职位，不管什么人坐在那里，大概率</p>
<p>都会滑铁卢。这种职位被称为“寡妇制造者”，对于这种职位来说，如果不改变职位的底层逻辑，谁来</p>
<p>都不好使。</p>

<p>“Widow-Maker” Positions</p>
<p>widow-maker position is a job that defeats two competent people in a
row.</p>
<p>“Widow-maker” is the term that nineteenth-century New England
shipbuilders used to describe a</p>
<p>well-built new ship that still managed to have two fatal accidents in
a row.</p>
<p>Instead of attempting to fix the problems with the ship, they
immediately broke it up to prevent</p>
<p>another accident from occurring.</p>
<p>In organizations, a widow-maker is a job that defeats two competent
people in a row.</p>
<p>It will almost certainly defeat a third one, no matter how
competent.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is to abolish the widow-maker position and
restructure the work.</p>
<p>Widow-makers typically appear when an organization experiences rapid
growth or rapid change.</p>
<p>I have since seen this phenomenon in a lot of organizations—for
example, in a university that within</p>
<p>ten years had moved from being primarily an under-graduate teaching
institution to becoming a</p>
<p>major research university.</p>
<p>That killed off two excellent people who took on the presidency as it
had been structured the old</p>
<p>way, and by the way, any number of deans—again, these positions could
be filled successfully only</p>
<p>after the university had re-structured itself thoroughly.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident.</p>
<p>One person who somehow combined temperamental characteristics that
are not usu-ally found in</p>
<p>one person created the job and acquitted himself or herself well. In
other words, what looked like a</p>
<p>logical job was an accident of per-sonality rather than the result of
a genuine function. But one</p>
<p>cannot re-place personality.</p>
<h3

POINT: Is there a “widow-maker” position in your organization? Either

<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Importance of Age Balance</p>
<p>Another important reason why jobs and a job structure focused on
rapid promotion are to be</p>
<p>avoided is that they result in an unbalanced age structure. Both an
age structure that is</p>
<p>overbalanced on the side of youth and one overbalanced on the side of
age create serious</p>
<p>organizational turbulence.</p>
<p>The management structure needs continuity and self-renewal. There
must be continu- ity so that</p>
<p>the organization does not have to replace all of a sudden a large
number of ex- perienced but old</p>
<p>managers with new and untried men. And there has to be enough</p>
<p>“managerial metabolism” so that new ideas and new faces can assert
themselves. A management</p>
<p>group that is of the same age is a management group headed for
crisis. Yet the</p>
<p>management group that is uniformly old may be preferable to the one
that is uniformly too young.</p>
<p>At least, the crisis comes sooner and is over faster.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Worse even than the job that is too small is the job that is not
really a job, the job of the typical</li>
</ol>
<p>“assistant to.”</p>
<p>The managerial job must have specific objectives and a specific
purpose and function. A manager</p>
<p>must be able to make a contribution which can be identified. He must
be ac- countable.</p>
<p>But the typical assistant does not have a job that can make a
contribution. He cannot be held</p>
<p>accountable and his function, purpose, and objectives cannot be
identified. He is a “helper” who</p>
<p>does whatever the boss thinks he needs done or whatever the assistant
can “sell” to the boss.</p>
<p>Such a job corrupts. The holder becomes either a wire-puller who
abuses his intimacy with an</p>
<p>important executive or a toady who tries to make his career by
licking his boss’s boots. The</p>
<p>assistant position also corrupts the organization. No one ever knows
what the role, authority, and</p>
<p>actual power of the assistant are. As a rule, other managers will
flatter him, use him, and exploit his</p>
<p>insecurity of tenure.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the title “assistant” has to be eschewed—the
reality should be avoided.</p>
<p>Also, a specific, detailed assignment for a young manager may be
excellent training. But,</p>
<p>preferably, it should be limited in time; after finishing one such
special assignment a man should</p>
<p>normally go back to a regular managerial job.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Managing is work. But it is not, by itself, full-time work. The way
to design a</li>
</ol>
<p>managerial job is to combine “managing” with “working,” that is,
responsibility for a spe- cific</p>
<p>function or job of one’s own. As a rule, the manager should be both a
manager and an individual</p>
<p>career professional.</p>
<p>A manager should have enough to do—otherwise he is likely to try to
do his subordi- nates’ work</p>
<p>for them. The common complaint that managers do not “delegate”
usually means that managers</p>
<p>do not have enough to do and therefore take on the job the subordi-
nate should be doing. But</p>
<p>also, it is rather frustrating not to have work ot one’s own—
especially for people who have grown</p>
<p>up in the habit of work. And it is not particularly desirable for a
man not to have a job of his own. He</p>
<p>soon loses the sense of workmanship and the respect for hard work
without which, however, a</p>
<p>manager is likely to do more harm than good. A manager should be a
“working boss” rather than a</p>
<p>“coordinator.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>As far as possible, a manager’s job should be designed so that it can
be done by one man working</p>
<p>by himself and with the people in the unit which he manages. It is a
mistake to design a job so that</p>
<p>it requires continuous meetings, continuous “cooperation” and “co-
ordination.” There is no need,</p>
<p>especially not in managerial jobs, to provide for more</p>
<p>“human relations.” The job by its very nature requires far more human
relations than most people</p>
<p>are capable of. And one can either work or meet. One cannot do both
at the same time.</p>
<p>Another mistake that is fairly common—and usually unnecessary—is to
design a job in which the</p>
<p>incumbent has to spend a great deal of time traveling. Just as one
cannot meet and work at the</p>
<p>same time, one cannot travel and work at the same time. Person-to-
person and face-to-face</p>
<p>meetings with colleagues, associates, subordinates, customers, and
superiors are absolutely</p>
<p>essential. There is no substitute. But it is far better to spend a
substantial amount of time once</p>
<p>every two years with the managers and the main custom- ers of a
subsidiary company than to</p>
<p>“commute”—that is, leave New York on Tuesday, spend Wednesday in
Paris, and be back on the job</p>
<p>in New York on Thursday. This means only that no work gets done for
four days: one needs, after</p>
<p>all, at least one day to recover from this futile attempt to be in
two places at once.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Titles should never be used as rewards, let alone to cover up lack
of function. Titles</li>
</ol>
<p>“in lieu of a raise” are not nearly as bad, nor as common, as titles
“in lieu of a job.”</p>
<p>An example is the large commercial bank, both in the United States
and in Germany. In the United</p>
<p>States everybody has to be a vice-president or at least an officer.
In Germany everybody has to be a Herr Direktor. There are reasons for
this. The customer of a bank, say,</p>
<p>the head of a small business, will not discuss his financial problems
with any- body but an officer.</p>
<p>But this also deforms. It makes those who do not get the title,
for</p>
<p>instance because their job does not entail close customer contact,
exceedingly dissatisfied. It adds</p>
<p>greatly to the dissatisfaction of people who reach the exalted title
of vice-president at an early age</p>
<p>and then find that they are locked into the same humdrum routine for
the rest of their working lives.</p>
<p>One reason for the misuse of title has been discussed irr Chapter 30:
the tradition in business (but</p>
<p>also in government) to use the identification of function (e.g.,
manager of market research) as</p>
<p>indicator of rank. Another common reason is the narrowness of salary
ranges under many wage</p>
<p>and salary plans; in order to give a man the raise he has earned by
performance it is necessary</p>
<p>under these plan to pretend that he has been promoted to a different
and bigger job. Finally, the</p>
<p>traditional limitation of career opportunities in busi- ness to
managerial positions often leads to</p>
<p>inventing a fancy and managerial-sounding title (e.g., Coordinator of
Materials Planning for a senior</p>
<p>purchasing clerk) for an experi- enced and accomplished specialist,
who continues, of course, to</p>
<p>do precisely what he has been doing all along.</p>
<p>The rule should be: for first-rate work we pay—and pay well. But we
change title only</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Finally, jobs that are “widow-makers” should be rethought and
restructured. In the heyday of the</li>
</ol>
<p>great sailing sltips, around 1850, just before the coming of steam,
every shipping company had a</p>
<p>“widow-maker” on its hands once in a while. This was a ship which,
for reasons nobody could</p>
<p>figure out, tended to get out of control and kill people. After it
had done this a few times a prudent</p>
<p>shipowner pulled the ship out of service and broke it up, no matter
how much money he had</p>
<p>invested in it. Otherwise, he soon found himself without captains or
mates.</p>
<p>In many companies there are jobs which manage to defeat one good man
after the other—without</p>
<p>any clear reason why. These jobs seem to be logical, seem to be well
con- structed, seem to be</p>
<p>do-able—yet nobody seems to be able to do them. If a job has de-
feated, in a row, two men who in</p>
<p>their previous assignments have done well, it should</p>
<p>be restructured. It then usually becomes clear, though ony by
hindsight, what was wrong with the</p>
<p>job in the first place.</p>
<p>A typical “widow-maker” has been the job of international
vice-president in a large American</p>
<p>company. Nobody seems to know why the job should not work, but in the
great majority of cases</p>
<p>one good man after the other fails in it. The reason is usually that
the</p>
<p>company has outgrown the volume of business which justifies treating
“international” as a</p>
<p>stepchild. (On this, see Chapter 59, “The Multinational
Corporation.”) But this becomes clear only</p>
<p>in retrospect, after one has restructured the job and has found the
man—or men—who can do</p>
<p>the work.</p>
<p>In a good many consumer-goods companies—Procter &amp; Gamble is an
example—there is a top</p>
<p>marketing manager and a top promotion and advertising manager, both
members of the company’s</p>
<p>top management. Logically this should be one position since promotion
and advertising are part of</p>
<p>marketing. These companies have learned, however, that com- bining
these two functions into one</p>
<p>job usually means frustrating and defeating a good man. The reason,
as one consumer-goods</p>
<p>executive once put it, is that “marketing aims at moving goods,
promotion aims at moving people.”</p>
<p>These two aims require men of differ-</p>
<p>*I would exempt from the rule “honorifics” that primarily bespeak
seniority such as “junior” and</p>
<p>“senior,” especially for individual career professionals but would
then strongly insist that such titles</p>
<p>be used only to denote seniority—more or less in the fashion in which
the title monsignor in the</p>
<p>Catholic Church (at least in the U.S.) is almost automatically
bestowed on any man who has served</p>
<p>twenty-five years in the priesthood and stayed out of trouble.</p>
<p>ent temperament who look at their work differently and apply
different measurements</p>
<p>of performance to themselves and to their units.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One man who
somehow combined in</p>
<p>himself temperamental characteristics which are not usually found in
one person, created the job</p>
<p>and acquitted himself well. In other words, what looked like a
logical job was an accident of</p>
<p>personality rather than the result of a genuine function. But one
cannot replace personality.</p>
<p>Job Structure and Personality</p>
<p>The abuse of titles and the “widow-maker” job relate closely to one
of the most hotly de- bated</p>
<p>issues with respect to managerial jobs and managerial structure:
Should the organi- zation be</p>
<p>structured so that jobs fit people? Or should the organization be
“functional,” with people fitted to</p>
<p>jobs?</p>
<p>As commonly propounded, this is a pseudo-problem. Quite obviously,
people have to fill the jobs,</p>
<p>and therefore jobs have to fit people. We will indeed have to design
jobs that really fit people,</p>
<p>answer their needs, and fulfill their expectations. We will,
increasingly, see “organization planning”</p>
<p>in large companies, that is, attempts to make jobs fit people and
serve them.</p>
<p>There is also no doubt that organization structure has to be
impersonal and task- focused.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is impossible to have continuity and to have people
succeed each other. If the job is</p>
<p>designed for an individual rather than for a task, it has to be
restruc- tured every time there is a</p>
<p>change in the incumbent. And, as experienced managers know, one
cannot restructure one job.</p>
<p>There is a true “domino effect,” a true chain reaction. Re-
structuring a job usually means</p>
<p>restructuring a score of jobs, moving people around, and upsetting
everybody.</p>
<p>There is one exception: the exceedingly rare, truly exceptional man
for whose sake the rule should</p>
<p>be broken.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., the architect of General Motors, was adamant
that jobs had to be impersonal</p>
<p>and task-focused.* But he made one exception fo accommodate one of
the great inventors of our</p>
<p>century, Charles F. Kettering. Kettering was an exceedingly diffi-
cult man, and also a man who</p>
<p>disregarded every single organizational rule. Yet his inven- tions,
from the self-starter to the</p>
<p>redesign of the diesel engine, were of major importance. Sloan
offered to set up Kettering as an</p>
<p>independent researcher. But Kettering wanted to be vice-president and
a “big businessman.” Sloan</p>
<p>gave in, but the moment Kettering re- tired, the job was
redesigned—from “resident genius” to</p>
<p>manager of a large research laboratory.</p>
<p>The design of a job has to start out with the task, but it also has
to be a design that</p>
<p>can accommodate people with different temperaments, habits, and
behavior patterns. This is</p>
<p>a major reason why managerial jobs ought to be designed big rather
than small. A job has to be big</p>
<p>enough so that a good man can find within it his own satisfaction and
achieve- ment, his own way</p>
<p>and method of working.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church offers an instructive lesson. The basic manager
within the Catho- lic Church is</p>
<p>the bishop. It has long been the custom to rotate temperaments in
filling a bishop’s See. If the</p>
<p>incumbent is a pastor, concerned primarily with the care of souls, he
may be succeeded by a</p>
<p>theologian or by an administrator. In turn, a first-rate administra-
tor is likely to be succeeded by a</p>
<p>man whose main emphasis is on his priestly function, and so on. The
Catholic Church learned long</p>
<p>ago that the three qualifications—those of pastor, theologian, and
administrator—are unlikely fo be</p>
<p>found in one person. Yet all three are needed to keep a diocese
alive. Hence the bishop’s job is</p>
<p>designed very big in- deed—big enough for a good man to make of it
what suits him. And the</p>
<p>standard of accomplishment is set by rotating the temperaments that
occupy the See in succession.</p>
<p>*See Sloan’s book, My Years with General Motors.</p>
<p>“A job should be small enough so that a good man can get his arms
around it” is a</p>
<p>common saying. It is the wrong rule. “A job should be specific enough
so that a good man</p>
<p>can go to work on it, but so big that he can’t get his arms around
it” is the right rule.</p>
<p>“Style” should never be a consideration, either in designing a
managerial job or in fill- ing it. The</p>
<p>only requirement of a managerial job, and the only test of the
incumbent, is performance. Every</p>
<p>organization needs a clear understanding of the kind of behavior that
is not acceptable. There must</p>
<p>be a clear definition of the nonpermissible action, especially toward
people, whether inside the</p>
<p>business, i.e., employees, or outside, i,e., suppliers and customers.
But within these limits a man</p>
<p>should have the fullest freedom to do the job the way it best suits
his temperament and personality.</p>
<p>“Style” is packaging. The only substance is performance.</p>
<p>Job Structure and Personality</p>
<p>The abuse of titles and the “widow-maker” job relate closely to one
of the most hotly de- bated</p>
<p>issues with respect to managerial jobs and managerial structure:
Should the organi- zation be</p>
<p>structured so that jobs fit people? Or should the organization be
“functional,” with people fitted to</p>
<p>jobs?</p>

<h3 id="widow-maker-positions">“Widow-Maker” Positions</h3>
<p>A.widow-maker position is a job that defeats</p>
<p>two competent people in a row.</p>
<p>“Widow-maker” is the term that nineteenth-century New England</p>
<p>shipbuilders used to describe a well-built new ship that still
man-aged to have</p>
<p>two fatal accidents in a row. Instead of attempting to fix the</p>
<p>problems with the ship, they immediately broke it up to prevent
another</p>
<p>ac-cident from occurring. In organizations, a widow-maker is a job
that</p>
<p>defeats two competent people in a row. It will almost certainly
defeat</p>
<p>Athird one, no matter how competent. The only thing to do is to
abolish the</p>
<p>widow-maker position and restructure the work. Widow-makers
typically</p>
<p>appear when an organization experiences rapid growth or rapid change.
I</p>
<p>have since seen this phenomenon in a lot of organizations—for
example,</p>
<p>in a university that within ten years had moved from being primarily
an</p>
<p>under-graduate teaching institution to becoming a major research</p>
<p>university. That killed off two excellent people who took on the</p>
<p>presidency as it had been structured the old way, and by the way,
any</p>
<p>number of deans—again, these positions could be filled successfully
only</p>
<p>after the university had re-structured itself thoroughly.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One
person</p>
<p>who somehow combined temperamental characteristics that are not
usu-</p>
<p>ally found in one person created the job and acquitted himself or
herself</p>
<p>well. In other words, what looked like a logical job was an accident
of</p>
<p>per-sonality rather than the result of a genuine function. But one
cannot</p>
<p>re-place personality.</p>
