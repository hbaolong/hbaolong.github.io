<h2 id="透过金庸读懂德鲁克">透过金庸读懂德鲁克</h2>
<p>程心、罗辑和维德</p>
<p>罗辑是第一任执剑人。执剑人是一个变态的职位，它的全称是引力波威慑系统控制者。执剑人拥有启</p>
<p>动引力波广播毁灭两个世界的能力，意义是保持两个世界的战略平衡。</p>
<p>执剑人是面壁者计划的产物，所以执剑人又被称为“面壁者的幽灵”。</p>
<p>执剑人并不是地球政权体系的一部分，不过，地球以及三体人的任何决策都绕不开执剑人。所以，在</p>
<p>有了执剑人体系了，地球以及三体人的任何决策都会交给执剑人审核，执剑人同意后才可以得到有效</p>
<p>的实施。</p>
<p>所以，执剑人是一个事实上的独裁者。</p>
<p>这时的人类社会在经历了危机后，形成了空前民主和尊重人权，而执剑人的存在又让人类处于独裁者</p>
<p>的阴影之下。人类非常厌恶独裁者，也就厌恶执剑人。</p>
<p>随着年龄的增长，罗辑的身体也开始变差，人类决定更换执剑人。</p>
<p>当人类决定更换执剑人后，有很多候选人报名了执剑人的参选，这些人里有毕云峰、曹彬、伊万•安东</p>
<p>诺夫、A•J•霍普金斯，还有一位韩国的外交部副部长，还有一位律师，还有维德。</p>
<p>维德曾经是程心的上司，是PIA的负责人，他主导的阶梯计划事实上改变了人类和三体的关系。</p>
<p>维德是一个只知道目标而不择手段的人。他著名的口头禅就是：“前进！前进！！不择手段地前</p>
<p>进！！！”</p>
<p>罗辑本来是一个玩世不恭的花花公子，几十年的面壁者生涯让他成长出了对人类的责任，不过，他本</p>
<p>身还是一个玩世不恭的人。他当然希望保护人类，也希望保护三体人。不过，在面对决策时，丰富的</p>
<p>阅历和对黑暗森林法则的理解，让他可以迅速做出正确的决策。</p>
<p>维德本身就是一个对黑暗森林理解很深刻的人，而且是一个不择手段的人。他对人类的斗争史也非常</p>
<p>了解。</p>
<p>至于毕云峰、曹彬、伊万•安东诺夫、A•J•霍普金斯等，都是以前的老男人，他们也都具备一些男人的</p>
<p>控制欲和破坏性。</p>
<p>不过，这是一个极度尊重民主和人权的时代，这个时代的人对独裁也暴力非常厌恶和恐惧了。他们期</p>
<p>待和平的生活。他们认为最理想的执剑人是这样的：让三体世界害怕，同时却要让人类，也就是自己</p>
<p>不害怕。这样的人当然不存在，所以他们就倾向于让自己不害怕的。这时的人类对罗辑是害怕的，对</p>
<p>维德、是害怕的，甚至对毕云峰、曹彬等人也是害怕的。</p>
<p>他们喜欢程心这样的人。他们觉得，执剑人的威慑只是在那个系统。人只是一个符号。</p>
<p>所以，当罗辑卸任后，人类不再愿意选一个让“人”害怕的执剑人了。这时，程心就成为了最佳人选。</p>
<p>不过，执剑人毕竟是一个职业，就像总统、清洁工、保险业务员那样。</p>
<p>只要是职业，就有工作，只有有工作，就有绩效；只要有绩效，就有一个考核标准，也就有一个适应</p>
<p>的问题。</p>
<p>那么，程心或者维德，他们在面对执剑人的绩效时，会如何表现呢？</p>
<p>执剑人这个职位，其实只做一件事：当发生三体人对人类进攻，执剑人按下发射引力波的按钮。启动</p>
<p>双毁机制。</p>
<p>这个工作是不是很简单？</p>
<p>那么问题来了，罗辑、程心、维德，这三个人谁适合这个职位呢？当绩效考核时，谁可以得到一个要</p>
<p>的业绩呢？</p>
<p>最后，程心成了了第二任执剑人，也是最后一任执剑人。在程心继任执剑人10分钟后，水滴摧毁了引</p>
<p>力波系统，黑暗森林威慑终止。</p>
<p>黑暗森林威慑终止后，三体的代言人智子又找程心对了一下话，这次，智子已经非常强硬了。不过，</p>
<p>智子还是对程心说出了他对人类的几个候选人的绩效判断：</p>
<p>“知道吗？在我们的人格分析系统中，你的威慑度在百分之十上下波动，像一条爬行的小蚯蚓；罗辑的</p>
<p>威慑度曲线像一条凶猛的眼镜蛇，在百分之九十高度波动；而维德……他根本没有曲线，在所有外部环</p>
<p>境参数下，他的威慑度全顶在百分之一百，那个魔鬼！如果他成为执剑者，这一切都不会发生，和平</p>
<p>将继续，我们已经等了六十二年，都不得不继续等下去，也许再等半个世纪或更长。那时，三体世界</p>
<p>只能同在实力上已经势均力敌的地球文明战斗，或妥协……但我们知道，人们肯定会选择你的。”</p>
<p>是的，人类选择了程心。其实我们工作中也经常会选那些10%左右的人。你在工作中遇到过么？</p>

<p>Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices</p>
<p>【原书原文】</p>
<p>The Danger of Safe Mediocrity</p>
<p>The constant temptation of every organization is safe mediocrity. The
first requirement of</p>
<p>organizational health is a high demand on performance. Indeed, one of
the major reasons</p>
<p>for demanding that management be by objectives and that it focus on
the objective requirements</p>
<p>of the task is the need to have managers set high standards of
performance for</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>This requires that performance be understood properly. Performance is
not hitting the</p>
<p>bull’s-eye with every shot—that is a circus act that can be
maintained only over a few</p>
<p>minutes. Performance is rather the consistent ability to produce
results over prolonged</p>
<p>periods of time and in a variety of assignments. A performance record
must include mistakes.</p>
<p>It must include failures. It must reveal a man’s limitations as well
as his strengths.</p>
<p>And there are as many different kinds of performance as there are
different human beings.</p>
<p>One man will consistently do well, rarely falling far below a
respectable standard, but also</p>
<p>rarely excel through brilliance or virtuosity. Another man will
perform only adequately</p>
<p>under normal circumstances but will rise to the demands of a crisis
or a major challenge</p>
<p>and then perform like a true “star.” Both are “performers.” Both need
to be recognized.</p>
<p>But their performances will look quite different.</p>
<p>The one man to distrust, however, is the man who never makes a
mistake, never commits</p>
<p>a blunder never fails in what he tries to do. He is either a phony,
or he stays with the</p>
<p>safe, the tried, and the trivial.</p>
<p>A management which does not define performance as a batting average
is a management</p>
<p>that mistakes conformity for achievement, and absence of weaknesses
for strengths.</p>
<p>It is a management that discourages and demoralizes its organization.
The better a man is,</p>
<p>the more mistakes he will make—for the more new things he will
try.</p>
<p>The man who consistently renders poor or mediocre performance should
be removed</p>
<p>from his job for his own good. People who find themselves in a job
that exceeds their</p>
<p>capacities are frustrated, harassed, anxiety-ridden people. One does
not do a man a service</p>
<p>by leaving him in a job he is not equal to. Not to face up to man’s
failure in a job is</p>
<p>cowardice rather than compassion.</p>
<p>One also owes it to the man’s subordinates who have a right to be
managed with competence,</p>
<p>dedication, and achievement. Subordinates have a right to a boss who
performs,</p>
<p>for otherwise they themselves cannot perform.</p>
<p>One owes it finally to all the people in the organization not to put
up with a manager</p>
<p>who fails to perform. The entire organization is diminished by the
manager or career professional</p>
<p>who performs poorly or not at all. It is enriched by the man who
performs superbly.</p>
<p>At first sight the Japanese seem to violate this rule. For few, if
any, people ever get</p>
<p>fired for nonperformance in the Japanese organization. In actuality
the Japanese organization</p>
<p>may be as demanding and even as competitive as any in the West. The
poor or mediocre</p>
<p>performer is not fired; but he is quickly sidetracked and assigned
the activities</p>
<p>which are in effect “made work.” And both he and the organization
know it. Moreover,</p>
<p>while everyone advances in pay and title according to seniority,
there is a day of reckoning</p>
<p>at or around age forty-five when the very few who will become company
directors;</p>
<p>that is, top management, are chosen from the many others who will,
ten years later, retire</p>
<p>as section managers or department directors.</p>
<p>The only thing that is proven by a man’s not performing in a given
assignment is that</p>
<p>management has made a mistake by putting him in. It is a mistake that
no manager can</p>
<p>avoid, no matter how carefully he works on the placement of people.
The fact that a man</p>
<p>who has performed in earlier assignments does not perform in a new
one proves nothing</p>
<p>except that he should not have been put in the job in the first
place.</p>
<p>“Failure” in such a case may mean only that a first-rate career
professional has been</p>
<p>miscast as a manager. It may mean that a man excellent at running an
existing operation</p>
<p>has been miscast as an innovator and entrepreneur. Or it may mean the
opposite: that a</p>
<p>man whose strength lies in doing new and different things has been
miscast to head a continuing,</p>
<p>well-established, and highly routinized operation.</p>
<p>Failure to perform on the part of a man who has a record of proven
performance is a</p>
<p>signal to think hard about the man and the job. And sometimes, of
course (see the discussion</p>
<p>of the “widow-maker” job in Chapter 32) it is the job rather than the
man that is at</p>
<p>fault.</p>
<p>George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in World War II,
was an uncompromising</p>
<p>and exacting boss who refused to tolerate mediocrity, let alone
failure. “I have</p>
<p>a duty to the soldiers, their parents, and the country, to remove
immediately any commander</p>
<p>who does net satisfy the highest performance demands,” Marshall said
again and</p>
<p>again. But he always asserted, “It was my mistake to have put this or
that man in a command</p>
<p>that was not the right command for him. It is therefore my job to
think through</p>
<p>where he belongs.” Many of the men who emerged in World War II as
highly successful</p>
<p>commanders in the U.S. Army were once in the course of their careers
removed by Marshall</p>
<p>from an early assignment. But then Marshall thought through the
mistake he had</p>
<p>made—and tried, to figure out where that man belonged. And this
explains, an large</p>
<p>measure, why the American Army, which had gone into World War II
without a single</p>
<p>one of its future general officers yet in a command position (these
were all held by men</p>
<p>past retirement age who had to be moved out), produced an outstanding
group of leaders</p>
<p>in a few short years.</p>
