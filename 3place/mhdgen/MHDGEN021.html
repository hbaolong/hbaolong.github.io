December 2002, esp. 4; The depth of British society’s involvement with
slavery, and the significant material benefits that it drew from it, are

<li><p>Rose, The Gregs of Quarry Bank Mill, 15–16, 20. He was, in fact,
as his biographer Mary B. Rose argued, “responding to the growing demand
for cloth”—a demand that he knew of firsthand. See Mary B. Rose, “The
Role of the Family in Providing Capital and Managerial Talent in Samuel
Greg and Company, 1784–1840,” Business History 19, no. 1 (1977):
37–53.</p></li>

Currency,” University of Wyoming, accessed January 9, 2013,
http://www.uwyo.edu/numimage/currency.htm. Indeed, between 1801 and
1804, 59 percent of Greg’s production went to the United States; see
Rose, The Gregs of Quarry Bank Mill, 24, 28, 30 33. For interest rates

Maddison, The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective (Paris:
Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2001), 27. Even someone who emphasizes the slowness of the
acceleration of economic growth in the Industrial Revolution like
Nicholas Crafts still sees it as a watershed to “faster TFP growth.” See
Nicholas Crafts, “The First Industrial Revolution: Resolving the Slow
Growth/Rapid Industrialization Paradox,” Journal of the European
Economic Association 3, no. 2/3 (May 2005): 525–39, here 533. But see
Peter Temin, “Two Views of the Industrial Revolution,” Journal of
Economic History 57 (March 1997): 63–82, for a restatement of the impact
of the Industrial Revolution on the British economy as a whole. There
are nearly as many explanations for the Industrial Revolution as there
are books on it. For a good overview see Inikori, Africans and the
Industrial Revolution in England, chapter 2. But long-term and slow
cultural or institutional change cannot explain the rather rapid
divergence of Britain from other parts of the world.</p></li>

<li><p>Broadberry and Gupta, “Cotton Textiles and the Great Divergence,”
27. Robert C. Allen rightly emphasizes the importance of the demand for
more efficient machinery as a core driver for the Industrial Revolution.
However, that demand for machines ultimately derived from the existence
of vast markets for cotton goods and the ability of British capitalists
to serve them. See Robert C. Allen, The British Industrial Revolution in
Global Perspective (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009), for
example p. 137.</p></li>

mill” in the greater Manchester area was the Shudehill Mill, built
around 1782. It was two hundred feet in length, thirty feet wide, and
five stories high. See Williams and Farnie, Cotton Mills in Greater

<li><p>To amplify: Institutions, as many observers have remarked, matter
a great deal. The problem, however, is to define these institutions and
root their emergence in a particular historical process. Institutions
are not a question of the “will” of historical actors; they are instead
the result of the confluence of a number of factors, and, most important
of all, of particular balances of social power. As we will see in later
chapters, the social and political configurations of many parts of the
world did not lend themselves to such an embrace of industrial
capitalism, or the institutions that usually go with it. The report of
the French commission is cited in Henry Brooke Parnell, On Financial
Reform, 3rd ed. (London: John Murray, 1832), 84; William J. Ashworth,
“The Ghost of Rostow: Science, Culture and the British Industrial
Revolution,” History of Science 156 (2008): 261.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Royal Navy, see O’Brien and Engerman, “Exports and the
Growth of the British Economy,” 189–90. I agree here with the more
recent literature that emphasizes the crucial importance of
institutions. The argument has been made most persuasively by Daron
Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power,
Prosperity, and Poverty (New York: Crown Business, 2012). However, in
Acemoglu and Robinson’s account, these institutions remain somewhat
amorphous and their own histories (and with it their roots in war
capitalism) remain unspecified. For an insistence on the importance of
institutions see also Niall Ferguson, Civilization: The Six Killer Apps
of Western Power (London: Penguin, 2012).</p></li>

Rise of Europe.”</p></li>
