Industrial Capitalism Takes Wing</h4>
<p>The Industrial Revolution in Alsace (illustration credit 6.1)</p>
<p>In 1835, John Masterson Burke, a twenty-three-year-old business
manager at the iron foundry of James P. Alair in New York City, set sail
for southern Mexico. His destination was the small colonial town of
Valladolid. There, Don Pedro Baranda, the onetime governor of Yucatán,
and John L. MacGregor, a Scot, had opened Mexico’s first steam-powered
cotton manufacturing enterprise, a factory that Burke was to direct.
They cited the “spontaneous growth of cotton around Valladolid” as the
incentive for this venture, but stories of cotton profits from
Lancashire to Lowell must have encouraged Baranda and MacGregor as
well.1</p>
<p>Building a cotton factory in Valladolid, far from shipping facilities
and technical expertise, was no small undertaking. Although a New Yorker
who passed through in 1842 described the factory as “remarkable for its
neat, compact, and business-like appearance,” setting up production in
Yucatán had been a struggle. To get the Aurora Yucateca started, Burke
had brought with him from New York not only the machinery (including the
carts required to move these machines from the port to Valladolid) but
also four engineers, two of whom promptly died of malaria. With no
architect, the entrepreneurs designed the factory themselves and “twice
the arches gave way, and the whole building came down.” Nonetheless,
Baranda, MacGregor, and Burke eventually got the mill up and running.
Drawing on 117 local workers, along with Mayan families who supplied the
wood to fire the steam engines and who planted cotton on their maize
fields, they churned out 395,000 yards of cloth in the nine years before
1844. Though modest by the standards of Lancashire, this was a
spectacular achievement.2</p>
<p>That a cotton mill arose in the middle of the tropical wilderness of
the Yucatán Peninsula, several days’ ride away from the port town of
Mérida, and remote from sources of capital, testifies to the powerful
attraction that cotton had for entrepreneurs across the globe. After the
spread of water-powered spinning machines in Great Britain during the
1780s, mechanized cotton manufacturing spread around the world, at first
slowly and then at breakneck speed, from Britain to continental Europe
and to the United States, then on to Latin America, to northern Africa,
and eventually to India and beyond.</p>
<p>Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such stories could be told. Take the
Wiesental in what is today Germany. Reaching from the highest peaks of
the Black Forest in the Duchy of Baden to the Rhine near the Swiss city
of Basel, this valley had been a vibrant center for the hand spinning
and weaving of cotton since the eighteenth century. Flush with Swiss
capital, cheap labor, and a broad network of middlemen, enterprising
Basel merchants mobilized thousands of peasants to spin cotton in their
homes, workers who came from local farm families unable to find land for
their offspring and who were outside the guild restrictions that limited
the expansion of production in cities such as Basel. Some of these
merchants began to employ very large numbers of these workers, helped by
government stipulations that forced children and young adults to spin:
In 1795 putting-out merchant Meinrad Montfort from Zell in the Black
Forest paid wages to about twenty-five hundred households in which one
or more family members spun or wove. Montfort and other such putting-out
merchants received the raw cotton from Basel and returned the finished
cloth to its merchants, who in turn delivered the goods to the
burgeoning cotton printing factories located in Mulhouse, an independent
city-state just across the Rhine. So massive was Swiss investment that
one historian has called the attendant economic restructuring of the
area the “colonialization of the Wiesental.”3</p>
<p>Already in the eighteenth century, these Swiss entrepreneurs and
their Baden subcontractors had put some spinners and weavers to work in
nonmechanized workshops in order to better supervise production.
Montfort himself had created as early as 1774 a bleaching workshop in
nearby Staufen. Once workers left their homes to labor in workshops, it
was only a question of time when mechanical devices for the spinning of
cotton, recently invented in England, would come to the Wiesental.
Indeed, in 1794—only ten years after Greg’s venture in
Styal—entrepreneurs erected the first mechanized spinning mill, although
government agents forced its closure soon thereafter for fear that
mechanization would lead to unemployment, misery, and social upheaval.
But this government intervention against industry was a rare exception,
and by 1810 modern water frames and mules returned to the valley,
invited by a government more favorably inclined to mechanization.
Drawing their power from the plentiful streams cascading down the
mountainsides of the Black Forest, these mills destroyed hand spinning
in short order. The greater availability of yarn, however, resulted in a
boom in hand weaving, which for a short period allowed peasants to
remain within their farm households. As elsewhere, rising demand and
ready capital eventually moved weaving into factories as well.
Mulhousian entrepreneur Peter Koechlin, to name but one, created
hand-weaving factories in the Wiesental towns of Steinen (in 1816),
Schönau (1820), and Zell (1826). With manufacturing moving from their
households into factories, peasants in ever greater numbers gave up
raising cattle as well as making cheese. By 1860, the Wiesental counted
160,000 mechanized spindles and 8,000 looms, nearly all of them located
in factories. Once a remote outpost of subsistence farming, the valley
had become yet another dot on the map of the Industrial Revolution. Like
the Yucatecan town of Valladolid, it had fallen into the vortex of a
globe-spanning capitalist economy linking peasants in the Black Forest
and on the Yucatán Peninsula, slaves on the banks of the Mississippi
and, as we will see, consumers on the shores of the Río de la
Plata.4</p>
<p>Hitched behind a well-matched team of entrepreneurs hungry for
profits and rulers lusting for power, the mechanized cotton industry
successfully colonized the Wiesental, Valladolid, and an ever-larger
swath of the world. In 1771, the spinning jenny came to the French city
of Rouen, only six years after it had been introduced in the United
Kingdom. In 1783, Johann Gottfried Brügelmann, a putting-out merchant in
Ratingen near Düsseldorf, did not have enough yarn for his weavers, a
problem that would have been impossible to solve just a few years
earlier; now he invested 25,000 reichstaler, gathered about eighty
workers, and with the help of a British expert created the first
spinning factory in the German-speaking lands. Two years later, the
first mechanical spinning machine arrived in Barcelona, a city with such
ancient cotton traditions that one of its narrow streets to this day
carries the name Carrer del Cotoners. In 1789, Providence merchant Moses
Brown hired a skilled British cotton worker, Samuel Slater, and built
the first successful spinning factory in America. In 1792, Belgian
entrepreneur Lieven Bauwens followed suit and started the first
mechanized spinning mill in Twente. A year later, such machines for the
first time began twisting yarn in Russia, when the Russian Treasury
sponsored Michael Ossovski to start a cotton spinning mill. In 1798, a
citizen of the Saxon city of Chemnitz, Christian Friedrich Kreissig,
bought twenty-five spinning jennies and started a cotton factory. By
1801, local merchants in St. Gallen in Switzerland had sponsored
Marc-Antoine Pellis’s creation of the country’s first spinning mill, the
Spinnerei Aktiengesellschaft. Seven years later, spindles turned in the
Lombardian town of Intra on the shores of Lake Maggiore. By 1818, the
first mechanized cotton spinning mill began operations in Egypt on
orders of Muhammad Ali, and in the mid-1830s, Don Pedro Baranda built
the first steam-powered cotton spinning factory in Mexico.5</p>
<p>British tinkerers’ revolutionary methods for the production of cotton
yarn spread rapidly, probably more rapidly than any previous
manufacturing technology. It certainly helped that travelers, journals,
newspapers, and learned societies trumpeted these wondrous advances. But
even more influential must have been the influx of British traders
carrying yarn and finished cotton cloth at unbeatable prices. European
and North American consumers, introduced to the wonderful properties of
cotton through relatively expensive goods made in India, responded
swiftly and enthusiastically, as did consumers in regions of the world
that had produced their own cotton fabrics for centuries or millennia.
As more people bought cheap cottons, entrepreneurs in more countries
became convinced that they could produce the same goods. With equal
enthusiasm skilled artisans, adventurers, state bureaucrats, and budding
entrepreneurs embraced the new machines and techniques. By 1800, as we
have seen, the first mechanized spinning mills had sprung up in Britain,
France, the German lands, the United States, Russia, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, and Belgium. Twenty years later, new mills churned out yarn
and cloth in the Habsburg Empire, Denmark, Italy, Egypt, and Spain. And
by 1860, mills could be found throughout Europe, North America, India,
Mexico, and Brazil. While that year the United Kingdom still controlled
67.4 percent of the world’s mechanical spindles, cotton spinning by
machines had effectively replaced older ways of doing things in large
areas of the world.6</p>
<p>The world’s mechanized cotton industry was remarkable not only for
its rapid global dispersion but also for its feverish rate of growth.
Each new spinning mill served as an example to entrepreneurial neighbors
that profits awaited those who could master the new world of cotton
manufacturing. Belgian industrialization, without precedent in
continental Europe in the first decade of the nineteenth century, was an
example of this growth: In Ghent alone, its center, there had been only
227 cotton spinners in 1802, but six years later there were already
2,000 such workers, with an additional 1,000 laboring in the surrounding
countryside.7 The number of spindles in the German lands increased from
22,000 in 1800 to 2 million in 1860. Catalonia saw an exponential growth
of its cotton industry as well, so much so that it became known as the
“little England in the heart of Spain,” with nearly 800,000 spindles
turning in 1861. By 1828, nine spinning mills had opened in Russia, and
by the middle of the nineteenth century Russia had become
self-sufficient in cotton textiles. In Mexico, 25,000 spindles and 2,600
looms worked in its fifty-eight mills by 1843. Switzerland counted 1.35
million spindles in 1857. Nearby Alsace housed more than 500,000
mechanical spindles in 1828, and 859,300 in 1846. In the United States,
cotton mills opened in Rhode Island (1790), New Jersey (1791), Delaware
(1795), New Hampshire (1803), New York (1803), Connecticut (1804), and
Maryland (1810). In 1810, according to the U.S. census, there were 269
cotton establishments in the United States with a total of 87,000
spindles. By 1860, there would be 5 million spindles, making cotton
textiles the United States’ most important manufacturing industry in
terms of capital invested, workers employed, and net value of its
product.8</p>
<p>The rapid spread and exponential growth of mechanized cotton yarn
production in so many parts of the world evinces the compelling nature
of this new social system. Most obviously, mechanized spinning led to
enormous productivity gains; those with sufficient capital to afford the
new technology immediately enjoyed a competitive advantage over hand
spinners. Once entrepreneurs installed spinning mules in Switzerland,
productivity per worker increased by as much as a factor of a hundred.9
It is not surprising that the history of cotton after 1780 had a
definite direction: Ever-more productive machines substituted for human
labor, turning the world’s most important manufacturing industry upside
down.</p>
<p>Cotton’s dramatic decline in price: average price of 100 kilograms of
cotton yarn in Mulhouse, 1811–1860 (illustration credit 6.2)</p>
<p>Yet if this new way of spinning cotton yarn was so compelling, should
it not have spread more evenly throughout the globe? Why did it take ten
or more years to travel a few hundred miles to continental Europe,
twenty or more years to cross the Atlantic to the United States, fifty
or more years to reach Mexico and Egypt, and a hundred or more years to
reach India, Japan, China, Argentina, and most of Africa? The spread of
cotton industrialization is puzzling. Clearly it was a vastly more
productive way to satisfy a basic human need for cloth. Cotton growing
needed appropriate climates and soil, but cotton manufacturing, as the
British example had shown, needed neither. In fact, the spread of
mechanized cotton manufacturing seemed to follow a universal law of
efficiency—yet with surprisingly particular results.</p>
<p>If we compare mechanized cotton production to the spread of a virus
or an invasive species, then figuring out the underlying causes requires
us to differentiate the vulnerable populations from the resistant ones.
And indeed, even a cursory glance around the edges of these newfangled
machines in the countries and regions that adopted them first reveals a
host of characteristic economic, social, and political relations—the
embryonic features of industrial capitalism. As we have seen in Britain,
this industrial capitalism was a radical departure from the life of
centuries prior. It was one thing for British tinkerers and putting-out
merchants to stumble upon a new way of spinning cotton in the last
decades of the eighteenth century. But it was an entirely different
thing to scale that model by several orders of magnitude and forge it
into a new social order. It was the capacity of a newly emerging type of
state, as we will see, that was decisive.</p>
<p>To understand the seemingly peculiar patterns of the spread of
mechanized cotton manufacturing around the world, and with it
industrialization as such, let us chart what the places that followed
the British had in common. First and foremost, these early adopters all
had a prior history of textile manufacturing. While no guarantee of
success, such prior experience was all but required for cotton
industrialization. Spinning mills almost always arose in areas that had
already sustained vibrant textile industries—no matter if in woolens,
flax, or cottons, urban or rural, home-based or in workshops. In the
area around Ghent, for example, a long tradition of flax spinning and
weaving had trained labor to cotton manufacturing. In the Mexican city
of Puebla, mechanical cotton spinning built upon a centuries-long
history of cotton spinning and weaving so established that its workers
had a cotton producers’ guild, and indeed large workshops had emerged
even before the advent of mechanization. The situation in the German
lands was no different: One economist found that “the modern cotton
industry nearly everywhere is building on older home industries.” In
Russia, the cotton manufacturing industry emerged from
eighteenth-century linen and woolen manufacturing; in the United States,
New England’s textile mills arose in areas in which women especially had
a long tradition of spinning yarn and weaving textiles; in Alsace, the
history of textile production stretched back to the fifteenth century;
and in Switzerland’s cotton manufacturing areas, the long and
distinguished history of people making cotton fabrics in their homes had
resulted in the accumulation of skills and capital. This small-scale
work was often the first victim of industry’s rise, but it provided the
usurpers with skills and labor essential to modern manufacturing.10</p>
<p>The focus of the old manufacturing base also shaped the avenues each
region followed to industrialization. In some areas of the world, cotton
industrialization unfolded from basic spinning, with the weaving and
printing of textiles being secondary. In the United States, for example,
as in England itself, industrialization was led by basic manufacturing,
namely spinning, moving next into weaving and, later, printing, the
application of colorful designs on cotton cloth imported from elsewhere.
In many other parts of the world, among them Belgium, Russia, and
Alsace, however, cotton industrialization emerged from a thriving
printing industry.11</p>
<p>The Spread of Industrial Capitalism, 1780–1860</p>
<p>Whether led by spinning or printing, in all of these regions rural
people had spun and woven in their cottages, farmhouses, and huts and
had done so under the direction of merchants. In Saxony, cotton spinning
and weaving extended back to the fifteenth century, with peasants first
producing yarn and cloth for their own use. By the eighteenth century,
merchants had built a complex putting-out system, advancing raw cotton
to farmers to later retrieve finished yarn and cloth from them.
Eventually some of these peasants became full-time spinners. By 1799, in
and around Chemnitz as many as fifteen thousand people spun cotton in
their homes. As workers honed their skills, merchants accumulated
capital and marketing expertise.12</p>
<p>The Swiss story unfolded similarly. Tens of thousands of people had
been busy manufacturing cotton textiles long before machines arrived.
Merchants, just like in Saxony, gradually organized this production.
When inexpensive British yarn began flooding the Swiss market, many
spinners became weavers, continuing to work in their homes. Some of the
putting-out merchants, however, saw an opportunity to produce yarn
domestically, and they brought workers into factories to work for wages
on new English-made machines. At first, industrialization did not
eliminate manufacturing in the countryside and in homes, but over time
its insatiable hunger for capital and ever greater mechanization shifted
power to those merchants most capable of building large factories
employing wage workers.13</p>
<p>In Italy as well, Lombardian putting-out systems paved the way for
the emergence of factory production in the early decades of the
nineteenth century. A few hundred miles to the west, in Catalonia,
earlier manufacturing in both the countryside as well as in the city of
Barcelona had smoothed the path toward factory production, fueled in
part by the new accumulation of capital and in part by the creation of a
rural group of wage earners who could be moved into factories. Holland’s
mechanized cotton industry was also built upon and embedded within its
putting-out networks, as was Mexico’s.14</p>
<p>Such a system of home spinning could, at least at first, easily adapt
to a more mechanized way of doing things. In the late eighteenth
century, for example, some spinners began using jennies in their homes
or small workshops, as they had done in Britain a few decades earlier.
Eventually, however, merchants nearly everywhere would concentrate
production in factories, where it could be better supervised,
standardized, and accelerated by the use of water and steam power.15</p>
<p>This early manufacturing often, though not always, also provided
access to that other ingredient essential for industrial production:
capital. Without access to capital, the new ways of producing cotton
were impossible: buildings had to be erected, streams diverted, machines
built, workers hired, raw materials secured, and expertise recruited,
often from long distances and across national boundaries. The merchants’
most common strategy was reinvesting capital accumulated in the
organization of household production of cotton yarn and cloth into small
factories. In Switzerland, for example, former putting-out merchants
financed the wave of mechanized spinning mills built after 1806. They
began with small factories of a few mules and slowly enlarged them. In
Catalonia, by the late eighteenth century, artisan producers had
accumulated capital in the nonmechanized and household-based textile
industry and then used it to expand and mechanize production. In Alsace,
the industry drew its capital and entrepreneurial skills from the older
merchant and artisanal elites of the city of Mulhouse. In Russia, the
Prokhorov family, cotton manufacturers from Sergiyev Posad, a small city
fifty miles from Moscow, followed a similar trajectory. Serfs
emancipated by Catherine II, they became small-scale merchants, and
then, in 1843, focused on calico printing. Shortly thereafter, they
started a small spinning mill and their firm grew rapidly. As the age’s
most dynamic industry, cotton manufacturing provided ample opportunities
for social mobility. Swiss cotton manufacturer Heinrich Kunz started out
as a wage worker, but at the time of his death in 1859 he owned eight
spinning mills with 150,000 spindles, employing two thousand
workers.16</p>
<p>Mill owners in the United States also often rose from the ranks of
small merchants and skilled artisans. Rhode Island’s Samuel Slater had
apprenticed himself in England, oversaw other factories, and then
migrated to the United States in 1789. Once there, he entered into a
partnership with Providence merchant Moses Brown, who was rich from the
West Indian provisioning trade and was trying to introduce mechanical
spinning in the Browns’ Pawtucket factory. Slater proceeded to build
British-designed machines from memory, and in December 1790 the factory
produced its first yarn. The energetic Slater soon expanded operations,
built additional mills, and eventually accumulated sufficient wealth to
create his own company in 1799. By 1806 the Rhode Island countryside was
graced by the village of Slatersville.17</p>
<p>Such successes inspired others: When in 1813 William Holmes, whose
“object is to get business for myself,” wrote to his brother John that
they should build a cotton factory, he reviewed what a nearby factory
had cost and concluded from such observations that putting up a factory
large enough to eventually accommodate a thousand spindles would cost
about 0,000. He was “ready to join andandandand put in 1000 dollars. A
spinner who is a workman can be obtained who will put in 500 more
andandandand I can get more subscriptions from this quarter if
necessary.” Once started, these humble investors could “so increase the
machinery from the profits of the 200 spindles.”18</p>
<p>As the example of the Holmes brothers shows, capital requirements in
early cotton factories could be quite modest, so modest that even in
areas in which the availability of capital was limited, such as Saxony,
cotton factories might still flourish in a fashion, despite being small,
outdated, and reliant on cheap labor and cheap waterpower. Don Baranda,
just as modestly, had invested a total of 40,000 pesos, the equivalent
of the annual wages of approximately two hundred skilled workers, in his
Valladolid factory in 1835. Even in areas with a greater capital
availability, expenditures were measured and conservative. In the French
department of Bas-Rhin, part of the cotton complex centered in Mulhouse,
a cotton spinning factory only required an average capitalization of
16,216 francs in 1801, allowing the thirty-seven factories that existed
to employ an average of eighty-one workers. A weaving factory required
more—35,714 francs on average, but this was still a modest amount
compared to the 150,000 francs needed for a carriage maker, and the 1.4
million francs that an arms manufacturing establishment required. Later,
factories would of course grow: during the first half of the nineteenth
century, a mechanized spinning mill might cost between 200,000 and
600,000 francs, an integrated factory with spinning, weaving, and
printing operations perhaps as much as 1.5 million francs.19</p>
<p>Reinvestments of capital accumulated in the putting-out industry and
small artisan workshops combined with tentative investment from large
fortunes accumulated in the sometimes fickle world of trade. In some
exceptional instances, indeed, huge fortunes were invested in cotton
manufacturing as merchant capital attached itself to industrial
production. The most dramatic such move was undertaken by a group of
Boston merchants looking for new outlets for capital suddenly and
ruinously idled due to the American trade embargo against Britain and
France from 1807 to 1812. In 1810 Francis Cabot Lowell traveled to the
United Kingdom to acquire the blueprints for a cotton mill. Upon his
return, he and a group of wealthy Boston merchants had signed the
“Articles of Agreement between the Associates of the Boston
Manufacturing Company,” which created a huge integrated spinning and
weaving mill in Waltham near Boston, initially capitalized at 00,000, or
a bit more than 2 million francs. The mill focused on inexpensive coarse
cotton goods, some of which were sold to clothe slaves, replacing Indian
manufactured cloth. (So common did Lowell cloth become among slaves that
“Lowell” became the generic term slaves used to describe coarse
cottons.) The venture proved hugely profitable, with dividends in most
years above 10 percent on the paid-in capital. In 1817, the mills paid
peak dividends of 17 percent. By 1823, the Boston Associates expanded
further, building more mills in Lowell, about twenty-five miles north of
Boston, and creating the largest integrated mills anywhere in the world.
This move of American merchant capital into manufacturing marked another
tight connection between slavery and industry. Early cotton
industrialists such as the Cabot, Brown, and Lowell families all had
ties to the slave trade, the West Indian provision trade, and the trade
in agricultural commodities grown by slaves. The “lords of the lash” and
the “lords of the loom” were, yet again, tightly linked.20</p>
<p>The Boston Associates were unusual in the size of their investment,
but they were not the only large merchants moving capital into
industrial production. Swiss merchants by the early nineteenth century
began to invest into the Alsatian cotton industry, and also into the
emerging cotton complex of Lombardy. Barcelona merchants followed suit.
In Mexico as well, the larger share of the capital invested in cotton
manufacturing did not come out of the textile industry itself, but
instead from fortunes accumulated in trade. Of the forty-one capitalists
who opened cotton factories in Puebla between 1830 and 1849, nineteen
had been merchants, five landowners, and only three had previously been
involved in textiles.21</p>
<p>Wealthy merchants, many of them foreign, also played a central role
in the development of the Russian cotton textile industry, none more
emblematically than Ludwig Knoop. Born into a middling Bremen merchant
family, Knoop had come to Russia in 1839 as an assistant representative
of a Manchester merchant firm, de Jersey, importing yarn. He was only
eighteen years old but already quite familiar with cotton manufacturing
technology and in thrall to its promise. When, four years later, Britain
lifted its ban on textile machine exports, a ban that had from 1786 to
1843 outlawed the export of such things as the spinning mule (or
blueprints thereof), Knoop began to bring these machines to Russia,
along with English engineers and mechanics; he also imported
American-grown cotton and secured credits abroad for Russian
manufacturers. He built eight spinning mills between 1843 and 1847,
eventually selling those factories to Russian entrepreneurs. Riding
cotton’s meteoric global rise, Knoop became Russia’s most prominent
industrialist.22</p>
<p>Such mobilizations of capital were almost always embedded within
kinship networks, the Boston Associates, for example, drew on relatives
for investments; so did the Fränkel family of Upper Silesia, who built a
large spinning, weaving, and finishing empire in and around Lodz,
effectively pooling family capital and management skills. The best
example of the importance of family to the emerging cotton industry,
however, was Alsace, where a handful of families came to dominate a huge
local industry for many generations: the Dollfuses, Koechlins, and
Schlumbergers among them. These families intermarried. Pierre
Schlumberger, one of Mulhouse’s major cotton entrepreneurs, whose
spinning mills and printing workshops were valued at 1.3 million francs
when he died, had twenty-two children and grandchildren who entered
adulthood between 1830 and 1870. Nineteen of them married, fourteen into
the Alsatian bourgeoisie, and three into the bourgeoisie of the cotton
port of Le Havre. The textile bourgeoisie of Mulhouse thus was
extraordinarily cohesive, capable of organizing (in 1826, they founded
the Société Industrielle de Mulhouse), and of exerting its power to
create a political, social, and economic environment that was conducive
to their interests. One descendant, André Koechlin, was aptly dubbed the
“Sultan of Mulhouse.”23</p>
<p>Access to capital and a history in textile production thus were
essential to embarking upon the great adventure of manufacturing yarn
and cloth with machines, but the catalyst that turned these
preconditions into full-fledged cotton industrialization was pressure:
namely, the competition from British imports. Indeed, throughout the
world, the embrace of mechanized cotton manufacturing was motivated by
the need to substitute domestic production for foreign—usually
British—imports, just as England had fought so hard to replace a
reliance on Indian imports with its own domestic products. By 1800,
Britain was flooding world markets, exporting huge quantities of cotton
yarn and a smaller proportion of cloth: the value of exports to Europe
increased by more than twenty times between 1780 and 1805.24</p>

<p>At first British manufacturers themselves were important agents in
the spread of industrial capitalism. Wright Armitage, for example, a
Manchester cotton manufacturer, sent his brother Enoch to the United
States to sell his factory’s products. In similar ways, McConnel
andandandand Kennedy, the Manchester spinners, drew on agents as far
away as Hamburg, Switzerland, France, and, in 1825, Leipzig, Belfast,
St. Gallen, Thessaloniki, Frankfurt, Calcutta, France, Genoa, and Geneva
to sell their yarn. Their business records testify to the ever greater
variety of foreign markets they served. While in the 1790s the firm had
corresponded nearly exclusively with customers in the United Kingdom, by
1805 it corresponded with business partners in Germany, Portugal, and
the United States, and by 1825 with partners in Egypt, France, India,
Italy, Poland, and Switzerland. In that year, 30 percent of the firm’s
letters went to places outside the United Kingdom, testifying to the
global scope of their sales. John Rylands, Manchester’s first
multimillionaire and the builder of an “industrial and commercial
empire,” started his career as a weaver, turned himself into a
manufacturer, and by the 1820s became a wholesale trader, with huge
warehouses in Manchester and by 1849 also in London, that supplied the
markets of the world.25</p>
<p>Eventually, however, mill owners focused on manufacturing only and
left the selling to a burgeoning group of merchants. Already in 1815 the
city of Manchester had fifteen hundred cotton showrooms that made a
panoply of goods available to customers. Foreign-born merchants flocked
there. Nathan Rothschild, for example, arrived from Germany in 1798 to
acquire textiles for his father’s house back in Frankfurt, the first of
many German Jews who settled in Manchester. After 1840, a large number
of Greeks joined them to serve the needs of the Ottoman Empire and
beyond. Merchants located in foreign ports, drawing on the credit of
wealthy British merchants and bankers, became further conduits for the
sale of British textiles. In Buenos Aires, for example, a rapidly
growing group of British merchants sold British yarn and cloth from the
earliest years of the nineteenth century, exporting at the same time
hides and other meat products. Hugo (Hugh) Dallas, for example, imported
such yarn and cloth on commission, and sent “information respecting
Colours, Assortments, qualities andandandand prices” to British
manufacturers so they could adopt their production to a remote market,
where letters could take six months to arrive.26</p>
<p>Capturing the world market: John Rylands, Manchester, 1869
(illustration credit 6.5)</p>
<p>And Buenos Aires was not the only place in South America where
British merchants traded in cotton. Already by the mid-1820s it has been
estimated that ten British merchant houses were active in Montevideo,
twenty in Lima, fourteen in Mexico City, four in Cartagena, sixty in
Rio, twenty in Bahia, and sixteen in Pernambuco.27 This tidal wave of
exports flooded the world’s nonmechanized cotton industries.
Switzerland, one of Europe’s earliest industrializers, witnessed
significant imports of British machine-spun yarn starting in the
mid-1790s. As a result, wages in spinning fell dramatically: if a Swiss
spinner was able to buy a five-pound loaf of bread in 1780 with one
day’s spinning labor, it took between two and two-and-a-half days in
1798. As early as 1802, representatives of British spinning mills
traveled to Switzerland to sell their wares in even higher volumes, and
by the early 1820s no hand spinners were left in the Swiss countryside.
Similar incursions happened in Catalonia, in northwestern Europe, and in
the German lands, challenging budding capitalists, rulers, and
bureaucrats to embrace mechanized manufacturing. Failure to do so, in
effect, meant giving up on cotton, and forgoing what had become a
significant source of wealth and, increasingly, a precondition for being
“modern.” Yet rulers and capitalists in many parts of the world, as we
will see, were unable to respond.28</p>
<p>British competition was a strong incentive to embark upon something
radically new, but no manufacturer could do so without British
technology. Though the British government tried to hold on to its
monopoly, that technology spread rapidly due to active programs of
private and government-directed industrial espionage as well as the
unstoppable outflow of skilled British workers and cotton capitalists
eager to make their fortunes in new lands. Between the invention of new
machines in Britain and their spread elsewhere there was typically only
a ten-year lag. In Holland and northwestern Germany, jennies and water
frames arrived from England in 1780, while Belgian frames came from
France, where jennies had been introduced in 1771. The water frame
arrived in Lyon in 1782, after being set up in England in 1769. Samuel
Crompton’s mule came to Amiens in 1788, just nine years after its
invention. Arkwright’s machinery, one sociologist remarks, was a
“considerable technological breakthrough” but one that nonetheless could
be “easily defused.”29</p>
<p>Indeed, in the wake of the Industrial Revolution in Britain,
entrepreneurs, rulers, bureaucrats, and scientists from many parts of
the world carefully studied the progress of the British cotton industry.
They traveled to Britain to acquire blueprints, models, and machines. If
machines could not be had openly, entrepreneurs and spies committed the
secrets of this new technology to memory, or persuaded skilled British
artisans to travel despite the restrictive emigration laws in place up
to 1825. Industrial espionage was the order of the day. Between 1798 and
1799, Lieven Bauwens, for example, who brought mechanized cotton
spinning to Belgium, traveled to England thirty-two times to study the
new ways to spin cotton, sometimes bringing skilled workers along with
him. Thomas Somers, who had been sent to Britain by a group of Baltimore
manufacturers in 1785, returned with small-scale models of spinning
machines. Because knowledge of the early machines remained mostly in the
heads of artisans, their movements made this diffusion possible. It has
been estimated that more than two thousand British artisans worked in
continental Europe, taking with them the beating heart of the English
textile industry’s know-how.30</p>
<p>Everywhere, British entrepreneurs, British expertise, and British
artisans played a crucial role. In Normandy, one of the centers of the
French cotton industry, brothers Thomas and Frederic Waddington were
instrumental in establishing mechanized spinning factories in
Saint-Rémy-sur-Avre and Rouen. In 1818, Mulhousian cotton entrepreneur
Nicholas Schlumberger hired engineer Job Dixon from England to build
spinning machines for him. In 1831, Camille Koechlin traveled to England
to investigate cotton techniques there and returned with a number of
“Cahier des notes faites en Angleterre,” providing a detailed survey of
manufacturing techniques, especially as they related to the dyeing of
fabrics.31</p>
<p>From France, the new machines migrated to adjacent Switzerland. As
the Swiss cotton industry suffered mightily from machine-made yarn from
Britain, in 1800 the Swiss consul in Bordeaux, Marc Antoine Pellis,
approached the government of the Swiss Confederation to import
French-made copies of English spinning mules. They were eventually put
up in a nationalized monastery in 1801 and their 204 spindles put to
work. A year later, some Winterthur merchants brought forty-four of
Arkwright’s spinning machines to a factory in Wülflingen.32</p>
<p>Locations much farther from Lancashire also benefited from the spread
of ideas, machines, and people. Mexico drew on British and eventually
also American experts, technology, and machines. The U.S. cotton
industry itself relied on British technology and on industrial
espionage, easily camouflaged by ceaseless trade and immigration. In
1787, Alexander Hamilton (two years before he became secretary of the
Treasury) and Tench Coxe sent Andrew Mitchell to Britain to acquire
models and drawings of Arkwright’s machinery, a project that failed only
when Mitchell was caught. Most famously, Francis Cabot Lowell ventured
to Britain in 1810, allegedly for “health reasons,” and came back with
blueprints for his factory at Watertown. The combination of migration
and espionage meant knowledge traveled fast: Arkwright’s carding engine
found its way across the Atlantic in eight short years, Hargreaves’s
spinning jenny took ten; Arkwright’s water frame took twenty-two years,
and Crompton’s mule only eleven. After 1843, when the export of textile
machines from Great Britain was finally made legal, “market seeking by
British engineering firms” became an important additional factor in the
further spread of textile manufacturing technology.33</p>
<p>Once these technologies spread, indigenous machine makers quickly
mastered them and adapted them to new purposes and conditions. Saxon
entrepreneurs started building simplified versions of British machines
as early as 1801, and Swiss artisans followed in 1806. France developed
a strong machine-building industry alongside its cotton industry, and
that technology in turn was exported all over Europe. German skilled
artisans in turn played an important role in the early history of the
Russian cotton industry. Barcelona artisans manufactured spinning
jennies as early as 1789, Arkwright’s water frame in 1793, and
Crompton’s mule in 1806. Alsatian manufacturers were about fifteen years
ahead of their British counterparts in developing dyes and chemicals to
fix color to cloth, technology that eventually allowed for the emergence
of the huge chemical and pharmaceutical industry around Basel. And in
1831 the American John Thorp invented ring spinning, which proved to be
easier to operate and faster, creating more thread per worker. It soon
spread to Mexico, Great Britain, and, most significantly, by the end of
the century, Japan. The idea of relentless technical innovation, a core
characteristic of industrial capitalism, spread beyond the borders of
Great Britain—a sign that industrial capitalism had grown wings.34</p>
<p>Having access to spinning and weaving technology indeed was just as
necessary as access to capital, a prior history of putting-out networks,
the pressures of British competition, and a history of some kind with
textile manufacturing more generally. Regions such as Papua New Guinea,
the Congo Basin, or the interior of the North American continent lacked
these conditions, and were thus unlikely to follow the British road. But
vast areas of the world saw no industrialization in cottons even though
they fulfilled these conditions, Kano in present-day Nigeria, Osaka in
Japan, and Ahmedabad in India among them. To be sure, most of Asia’s and
Africa’s cotton industry was still outside the realm of British
competition and thus under considerably less pressure to embrace the new
manufacturing techniques. Yet some parts of Asia—including India, China,
and the Ottoman Empire—did not mechanize despite devastating pressures
from British yarn imports. When so many regions did industrialize, what
explains their seeming twins that did not? We need to search for an
answer elsewhere.</p>
<p>One easy explanation for the uneven development is the salutary
effect of war capitalism on European economies. The British case, after
all, reveals how important colonial expropriation and slavery and the
violent insertion into global networks had been for the radical
recasting of the local cotton industry. If industrial capitalism was
built on the wages of war capitalism, then perhaps it was the ability to
embrace war capitalism that was the fundamental precondition for cotton
industrialization. Not only British, but also French, Dutch, and Spanish
capitalists could and did draw on colonial raw materials and colonial
markets. Still, this is too facile a link. After all, one of war
capitalism’s most significant contributions to the unfolding of
industrial capitalism had been the provision of huge quantities of raw
cotton at falling prices. But in many ways that benefit was easily
generalized—anyone could travel to Liverpool or, for that matter, New
Orleans to purchase cotton and thus benefit from the enormous pressure
placed upon the slaves and indigenous peoples of North America. And what
about the spread of cotton industrialization in the German lands? Or
Switzerland? To be sure, some of their merchants gained riches in the
slave trade, and they benefited from the accessibility of slave-grown
cotton, but still, these important areas of European industrialization
were bereft of colonies.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the prevailing economic model—war capitalism—provided
the resources needed, especially raw cotton, for industrialization and
many important institutional legacies, the example of Great Britain had
shown that war capitalism itself was ill-suited for the next step: the
mass production of cotton textiles. Another way of organizing economic
activity had to be forged—and transferring that model turned out to be
much more challenging than moving machines or mobilizing capital.</p>
<p>What the British example also shows is the importance of the state’s
capacity to forge conditions conducive to industrialization. Without a
powerful state capable of legally, bureaucratically, infrastructurally,
and militarily penetrating its own territory, industrialization was all
but impossible. Forging markets, protecting domestic industry, creating
tools to raise revenues, policing borders, and fostering changes that
allowed for the mobilization of wage workers were crucial. Indeed, the
capacity of states to foster a domestic cotton industry turns out to be
the key division between places that industrialized and those that did
not. The map of modern states corresponds almost perfectly to the map of
regions that saw early cotton industrialization.</p>
<p>On the most superficial level, states mattered because they made the
project of cotton industrialization explicitly their own by engaging in
a range of measures to secure the construction of spinning mills. The
French revolutionary government, for example, provided loans to Belgian
cotton pioneer Bauwens. When Johannn Gottfried Brügelmann started the
first cotton mill in the German-speaking lands, he received an exclusive
privilege and monopoly from the Duchy of Berg. In Saxony, when Karl
Friedrich Bernhard and Conrad Wöhler opened the first cotton factories
in 1799 with the help of English engineers, they successfully appealed
to the local government for direct subsidies and a temporary monopoly.
In Russia cotton entrepreneur Michael Ossovski received government loans
and a five-year monopoly to start Russia’s first mechanized spinning
mill in 1798. In Denmark the government heavily subsidized the emerging
textile industry and brought skilled workers from abroad. In 1779 it
even created the Royal Privileged Cotton Manufacture, known as the
“Manchester Factory.” Similarly, in the United States, Alexander
Hamilton in his “Report on the Subject of Manufactures” in 1791 had
strongly advocated a policy of government support for industrial
development. And the state proved important, as when in 1786 the
Massachusetts legislature sponsored two Scots—Robert and Alexander
Barr—to emigrate to East Bridgewater to build a cotton spinning factory.
In a similar vein, in 1789 a group of Boston merchants, aided by a 00
grant by the state of Massachusetts, incorporated the Beverly Cotton
Manufactory. In Mexico the federal government created the Banco de Avío
para Fomento de la Industria Nacional in 1830, to make loans for the
building of factories and organized the acquisition of foreign machines
and the hiring of foreign technical experts, and in 1826, the government
of the state of Puebla supported the travel of mechanics to the United
States and Europe to study the techniques of cotton production and to
buy machines.35</p>
<p>Yet monopolies, subsidies, and the provision of expertise all proved
to be fairly minor interventions, sufficient to allow the building of
one factory or another, but not enough to embark upon the creation of a
significant domestic cotton industry. Indeed, without the novel and
powerful state in the heart of industrial capitalism, as we will see
later, these efforts could easily fizzle. Much more important was a
state’s ability to isolate its domestic manufacturing efforts from
competition, especially from Britain. But only a few states in the early
nineteenth century enjoyed the capacity to police their external
borders. Tellingly, the first wave of mechanized cotton spinning came to
continental Europe as a direct result of the ability of the expanding
French revolutionary republic to keep British manufactured goods from
the continent. The blockade of British trade, from November 1806 to
April 1814, provided the single most important impetus for continental
European cotton industrialization, protecting feeble beginnings so that
they could become a full-fledged industry. Just at the moment when the
continental cotton industry struggled to emerge, Napoleon’s policy
isolated it from the devastating competition of English manufacturers;
French spinning and weaving operations soon took off. Saxony was
similarly affected: In 1806, the cotton industry of Saxony, with
Chemnitz at its center, counted 13,200 mechanical spindles, but by 1813,
toward the blockade’s end, that number had multiplied an extraordinary
seventeen times.36</p>
<p>The effects of the blockade rippled through other parts of Europe as
well. While the first Swiss mechanized cotton mill opened its gates in
1801, the real expansion of the Swiss cotton industry occurred only
after 1806, during the continental blockade, when the industry was now
able to serve markets formerly served by the British. With the end of
the blockade, the Swiss industry experienced a grave crisis, as the
continent was again swamped with British wares. The Swiss were compelled
to look elsewhere for markets, which they found increasingly in the
Americas and the Far East. In Belgium as well, before the continental
blockade, many of Ghent’s printing workshops still worked with Indian
cloths. An 1806 report observed that “in this Department two
manufacturers only make the cloths known as calicoes, suitable for
printing. Were there an embargo placed on textile imports from India,
the Department would soon be able to produce sufficient to satisfy the
needs of the numerous printing works of this and other Departments
because of the abundance of weavers in the area and because the spinning
mills could produce all that is needed.” Napoleon unintentionally
fulfilled this wish, and huge new opportunities emerged for local
manufacturers. Just a year later, Prefect Faipoult was able to report
that “no industrial progress has ever taken place more rapidly.” In
Holland, the Habsburg Empire, and Denmark the stories were quite
similar.37</p>
<p>A similar impetus was at play in the United States during its
periodic conflicts with England. There, the wars of the early nineteenth
century proved beneficial to cotton manufacturing enterprises. With
Jefferson’s Embargo Act of 1807, which blocked the shipment of goods
between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, British
textile imports largely disappeared from the market, providing new
opportunities to American spinners and weavers: The number of mechanical
spindles in the United States increased from 8,000 in 1807 to 130,000 in
1815. There were fifteen cotton mills in 1806, and sixty-two in 1809,
with another twenty-five under construction. This astonishing and highly
profitable increase encouraged merchants, including Francis Cabot Lowell
in Boston, to shift ever more capital into cotton manufacturing.38</p>
<p>Napoleon’s continental blockade gave a boost to the cotton industry
of Europe and the Americas at a crucial moment in its development. By
1815, however, the protective effects of war and revolutionary upheaval
in Europe had ended. When peace came to Europe after Napoleon’s defeat,
British cotton manufacturer Wright Armitage remarked with relief that “a
sudden transition from War to Peace has had a great effect on Commerce….
I think we are now beginning to feel something of our own superiority
over other Nations, in driving them out of the market as
Manufacturers.”39</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, however, the cotton industry had grown so
substantially during the years of upheaval that manufacturers had gained
sufficient political clout to pressure their governments to protect the
emerging industry from being “driven out” and provided states with an
interest in and an ability to further develop industries. Wright
Armitage was partly wrong. In the United States, a new tariff provided
the cotton industry with some protection as early as 1816. Other parts
of the world followed suit. In France, “prohibitive tariffs” followed
the end of the continental blockade. Prussia and Austria imposed import
duties on cotton goods in 1818, Russia in 1820, France in 1822, Italy in
1824, and Bavaria and Württemberg in 1826. France went so far that in
1842 it prohibited the importation of all cotton goods onto its national
territory. Protectionism, once seen as a wartime cataclysm, now became a
permanent feature of newly industrializing states—who in this respect
followed the British example, as Britain had protected its home market
from Indian competition just as furiously.40</p>
<p>Cotton manufacturers themselves were at the forefront of demanding
such protection. Even as late as 1846, far beyond the industry’s
infancy, Alsatian entrepreneurs created the Comité Mulhousien de
l’Association pour la Défense du Travail National, with cotton
manufacturers Emile Dollfus and J. A. Schlumberger at the helm,
advocating strong protectionist policies. Across the Rhine in Baden,
cotton spinners had pressured for tariffs since 1820. Spinners in Saxony
also agitated for protective tariffs. When Saxony became part of the
Zollverein customs union on January 1, 1834, these spinners gained a
much greater domestic market, and additional tariff protection. In
negotiating these tariffs among the very states that constituted the
Zollverein, Friedrich List, who attended the meetings for Württemberg in
1846, believed, like Alexander Hamilton across the Atlantic, that the
“value of manufactures [must] be estimated from a political point of
view.” Industry, among other things, he argued, mattered for the ability
of nations to mobilize for war. This “political point of view,” was
shared by Catalonian, Habsburg, Russian, Italian, and French rulers who
protected their emerging cotton industry by various tariffs and
prohibitions, and whose cotton industrialists all clamored for higher
import duties.41</p>
<p>Even in places farther away from England, domestic cotton
industrialization rested on the ability of governments to protect their
domestic industries in times of peace as well as war. In the United
States, Massachusetts elites, and especially Waltham mill founder
Francis Cabot Lowell, influenced the federal government’s decision in
1816 to put a protective tariff on low-grade cotton goods, in effect
continuing to allow the import of high-quality British textiles, while
cornering the market for cheap cottons. Coarse Indian goods, the kind
Lowell and his colleagues competed with (and which they indeed had spent
much of their previous career importing from India), were effectively
subject to duty payments of between 60 and 84 percent of their value
until 1846, when the industry had developed to such an extent that it
could withstand such competition with lower tariffs.42</p>
<p>Mexico’s industry, like that of the United States, was a child of
protectionism. Since their independence from Spain in 1821, political
elites had pursued industrialization. Mexico had had a long-established
and thriving nonmechanized textile industry but that industry had come
under pressure from cheaply manufactured yarn and cloth imports from
Britain and the United States. The newly independent Mexican state tried
to address this problem by raising tariffs, or even prohibiting the
import of cotton textiles and yarn. Independence meant that Mexico
escaped the massive wave of deindustrialization sweeping other parts of
the world. The first mechanized cotton mill in Mexico that would last
(unlike the Aurora Yucateca) opened in 1835 in Puebla, founded and
managed by Esteban de Antuñano, and indeed it was Antuñano himself who
most forcefully demanded that the country protect itself from cotton
imports. Like Tench Coxe in the United States and Friedrich List in
Germany, Antuñano advocated import-substituting industrialization as a
path toward wealth and political stability. Responding to pressure from
industrialists, as well as to the fear of social unrest, such as the
riots in the textile-manufacturing city of Puebla in 1828, the Mexican
government passed new tariffs by May 1829 that prohibited the import of
coarse cotton clothing, exactly the kind that could be manufactured in
Mexico itself. The new tariffs proved successful, and by 1831 new
spinning workshops had opened their doors. Antuñano continued to be an
eloquent supporter of tariffs, and he warned that lowering tariffs would
destroy “in one stroke” all that had been achieved. His own factory, he
indeed argued, only existed because of the prohibition to import yarn of
grades below Number 21, relatively coarse yarns. Protectionism continued
unabated: the new tariff of 1837 again banning the import of cheap
cotton yarn and cloth. By 1843, the prohibition of cotton textile
imports was written into the Mexican constitution. As a result, the
number of cotton mills in Mexico increased from four in 1837 to more
than fifty in 1847.43</p>
<p>Mexico’s independent state, subject to the pressure of deeply
entrenched, well-organized, and consciously, programmatically
industrialist businessmen who not only could make their interests
central to state policies, but in fact often dominated the state, was
essential for its move toward industrial capitalism. In Mexico, unlike,
for example, Brazil, promoting domestic industry was very much an issue
close to the heart of nationalist politicians: As one historian of
Mexico observed, “The prosperity of manufacturers depended almost
exclusively on the willingness and the capacity of the state to police
the marketplace.” The independence of Mexico thus mattered a great deal.
By 1870, domestic textile producers, most of them in cottons, still
supplied 60 percent of the domestic market, compared to just 35–42
percent in India and 11–38 percent in the Ottoman Empire. Mexico’s
unusually consistent and forceful political commitments to import
substitution thus created a position unlike any of its peers in the
global South.44</p>
<p>The successful forging of industrial capitalism thus rested as much
on the capacity of states to create a framework in which manufacturing
could thrive as on entrepreneurial initiative. Beyond protectionism,
states also played a crucial role in market making by removing internal
duties. The Catalonian industry benefited from the removal of internal
tariff barriers in the Spanish market, as did the industry in the German
lands after the creation of the Zollverein in 1834, which removed the
myriad border crossings and tariff payments that had characterized trade
in that part of the world. Sometimes the state also became an important
customer, as for example in Russia, mostly to equip their militaries.
But most important of all was the road building, canal digging, and
railway construction that characterized assertive states in the first
half of the nineteenth century. These infrastructure projects greatly
facilitated the circulation of goods, people, and information, and thus
allowed for the emergence of larger and much more integrated
markets.45</p>
<p>As firsthand witnesses to England’s early triumphs, competing states
and cotton capitalists also clearly saw a national interest in
conquering foreign, often colonial, markets and did what they could to
follow suit. Britain itself, of course, relied on imperial expansion to
capture markets, in part to sidestep the protectionist policies of
continental Europe and the United States. So did the Catalonian
industry, which benefited greatly from sales overseas, so much so that
the Americas, according to one historian, constituted “the most dynamic
market for the producers of the Principality since the late 1770s.” And
it was a nearly perfect complementarity: Cotton textiles flowed out of
Catalonia’s cotton industry, while raw cotton, with the encouragement of
the Spanish state, came in increasing amounts from the New World to the
port of Barcelona.46 As elsewhere, new forms of integrating colonial
territories and industrialization emerged.47</p>
<p>As a result, growth rates of the Catalan industry were about equal to
those of the British industry—but only until the 1810s, when Spanish
holdings in Latin America shrunk drastically. Though Spain had once
possessed one of Europe’s fastest-growing cotton industries, Spanish
producers increasingly found themselves at a disadvantage; without the
benefit of colonial markets, merchants could not compete with cheaper
British goods, either in former Spanish territories or elsewhere in the
Americas. With the declining prospects of the industry, merchant capital
divested, showing the importance of the state-sponsored creation of
cloth markets.48</p>

<p>The French and Dutch industries benefited from colonial markets just
as much and for much longer. French manufacturers found significant
markets within their colonial empire in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Holland regained Java in 1816, and by 1829, 68 percent of cotton imports
to Java originated from the Netherlands. This was not least the result
of King William’s 1824 Textile Ordinance, a protectionist law that tried
to force British manufacturers out of Java. William also created the
Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, a semigovernmental firm, with the
king as a major investor, buying Dutch cottons and selling them in Java
to bring Javanese goods back to Holland. Thus supported, colonial
markets were central to Dutch success. Twente’s cotton industry in fact
became completely dependent on the Javanese market.49</p>
<p>When Belgium became part of the Dutch Republic in 1815 as a result of
the Congress of Vienna, it profited immediately and tremendously from
new access to the Dutch Asian markets. These markets became so important
that Belgium’s gaining independence in 1830 and losing access to Dutch
colonial markets precipitated a severe crisis. Some Belgian firms even
packed up and moved to Holland in order to continue to export into the
colonies, such as those of Thomas Wilson and Jean Baptiste Theodore
Prévinaire, who both moved to Haarlem in 1834.50</p>
<p>Even manufacturers in countries without colonies benefited from other
states’ colonial expansion. Swiss manufacturers, like their British
counterparts, responded to the increasing protectionism around them by
investing in the Italian and German cotton industry, and by looking for
markets farther afield. In the 1850s and 1860s, the production of batiks
for Southeast Asia and cotton head shawls for the Islamic world was
important to Swiss manufacturers, with the Winterthur merchant house
Gebrüder Volkart, for example, selling Swiss cotton goods to India, the
eastern Mediterranean, and East Asia.51</p>
<p>The ability to shape nearby and distant territories into markets was
a capacity that emerged much later, if ever, in much of Africa, Asia,
and South America. While skills, markets, capital, and technology were
available in many different parts of the world, a state that could
protect domestic markets, forge access to remote markets, and create an
infrastructure that facilitated manufacturing was the distinctive
feature of early industrial leaders. And these increasingly powerful
states also forged the institutions necessary to underpin industrial
capitalism—from markets for wage labor (enabled by the undermining of
precapitalist dependencies in the countryside and alternative means of
gaining access to subsistence) to property rights created by laws and
administrative infrastructures.</p>
<p>As a result, industrial capitalism, the most revolutionary invention
of all, traveled only in very particular ways. The capitalists who
managed to follow the British example usually worked within states that
embraced the industrialization project and saw national manufacturing as
a way to strengthen the state, forging in the process a new relationship
between economic activity and national territory. In these states,
rulers, bureaucrats, and capitalists could penetrate bounded territories
legally, bureaucratically, infrastructurally, and militarily to create
conditions that allowed for long-term capital investments, the
mobilization of labor, expanding domestic and foreign markets, and
protection for national industries from the uncertainties of the global
economy. For statesmen in burgeoning nation-states, the calculations
about whether to build an industrial society on the British model were
straightforward: Industry was a source of wealth, and also of vastly
superior tools of warfare. To survive in a competitive state system,
prosperity was imperative, and embracing industrial capitalism seemed
like a sure way to reach it. For some capitalists, in turn, investing in
manufacturing seemed a promising avenue toward wealth—and they pressured
their governments to the best of their ability to help forge industrial
capitalism, often against the interests and inclinations of competing,
often landed elites. Their success was the ultimate key to membership in
the cotton industrialization club, and at the center of the “great
divergence” in global economic history. And this industrial capitalism,
as we will see, would eventually grow strong enough to lessen its
dependence on war capitalism during its grand crisis in the 1860s.52</p>
<p>Cotton industrialization was thus not only a project of capitalists,
as we know, but equally a project of governments. Most miraculously, the
emergence of a set of states determined and able to protect domestic
cotton manufacturing did not devastate the export-dependent British
industry. To the contrary, British cotton manufacturing continued to
expand at a rapid clip after 1815. In the first half of the nineteenth
century, British production increased by 5 percent annually, and its
exports by 6.3 percent. By 1820, British entrepreneurs operated 7
million spindles, and by 1850 21 million. By the 1830s, weaving was also
increasingly mechanized, and with the spread of power looms, weavers
moved into factories as well. By 1835 there were roughly fifteen hundred
cotton manufacturers (some of whom owned multiple mills), and by 1860,
four thousand manufacturers owned cotton mills in the British Isles. So
important did cotton become to Britain that by 1856 the Manchester
Chamber of Commerce accurately described the industry as one “neither
surpassed in extent nor in usefulness by any other manufacturing
pursuit.”53</p>
<p>The secrets of British success in the face of protectionism elsewhere
were twofold. For one, British manufacturers focused on higher-quality
yarn and cloth, since they lacked competition from technologically less
advanced manufacturers elsewhere. And Britain increasingly depended on
markets in colonial or semicolonial areas of the world. Into the 1850s,
more than half of all cottons produced in the United Kingdom were
exported. Between 1820 and 1850, Asia and Latin America constituted the
most rapidly growing export markets, and Asia’s share in particular
increased quickly. The British cotton trade avoided the stronger states
that could protect their own emerging industries, gravitating instead
toward markets that were unable to politically resist the British
onslaught.54</p>
<p>The tremendous rapacity and unbalanced consequences of war capitalism
left in its wake a great diversity: Some states were strengthened, while
others were weakened and unable to invest in infrastructure,
administrative capacity, and protections of industry. Some states had
astounding capacities to manufacture goods on a mass scale; others
remained embedded in preindustrial, housebound production. On the one
hand, slavery, land expropriations, militarized trade, and colonial
expansion had opened up vast new territories and labor pools for cotton
growing and created new markets of tremendous vitality. They had helped
limit competition in global markets, radically stimulating the
international flow of goods, and thus making the project of
industrialization the possession of a few privileged parts of the world.
They were also at the root of a vast strengthening of states that
enabled a few of them to forge the institutions of industrial
capitalism. Indeed, the imperial extension of European state power over
the globe and its intensification within Europe itself were mutually
constitutive for a short but decisive moment.55 On the other hand,
colonial expansion, the slave trade, and slavery itself undermined state
capacity in other parts of the world and in so doing limited the
likelihood that the newfangled machines, and with them industrial
capitalism, would take root there as well.</p>
<p>No place illuminates the double impact of war capitalism on the
cotton industry better than Egypt. This North African country, long
exceptional in multiple ways, seemed at first to break with its
continent and follow the trajectory of Europe. Egypt had within itself
many of the preconditions for successful cotton textile
industrialization. It had access to raw cotton, grown in ever larger
quantities on its own soil. It had a long history of textile production,
and cotton was the most important craft industry of its major cities
before the Industrial Revolution; in the eighteenth century Egypt was
already exporting textiles to France.56 It had, as we will see, access
to British technology. And Egyptians were able to mobilize sufficient
amounts of capital. But by 1850 Egypt had not joined the small number of
countries experiencing Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>It all started quite promisingly. Influenced by mercantilist thought,
Egypt’s ruler, Muhammad Ali, was bent on setting up manufacturing
enterprises. Industrialization, he hoped, would strengthen, among other
things, Egypt’s military power and independence. Ali began an
import-substitution project not unlike those of his continental European
counterparts. In the early nineteenth century, Egypt had exported
significant quantities of grain to Europe, which British merchants paid
for with imported textiles that hurt Egyptian textile workshops. In
response, Ali put an embargo on these British goods and encouraged
Syrian Christians, who historically had dominated the textile trade, to
set up factories. In 1815, the first cotton weaving workshop opened with
a government-granted monopoly. Three years later, in 1818, the first
mechanized cotton spinning mill began operations, rapidly followed by
others.57</p>
<p>The technology for such industrialization in Egypt, as elsewhere,
came directly or indirectly from Britain. At first, Ali imported
spinning machines from there and had them set up by British mechanics,
but later he brought French engineers to start a domestic machinery
industry.58 So far, cotton industrialization in Egypt followed along the
lines of continental Europe, the United States, and Mexico.</p>
<p>The peak of this industrialization effort was reached in the
mid-1830s. By 1835 between fifteen thousand and twenty thousand workers
labored in thirty cotton factories operating approximately four hundred
thousand spindles. Most of the products of these factories served the
domestic market, but other fabrics were exported—throughout the Middle
East, to places such as Syria and Anatolia, but also into Sudanese and
Indian markets. As the German paper Ausland remarked in 1831 after
reviewing the Egyptian cotton industry, “It is interesting that a
barbarian has achieved within a few years what Napoleon and the entire
continent were unable to accomplish since the beginning of the century,
despite all possible efforts, i.e., to successfully compete with the
British in the production of cotton.” Such an assessment was only a
slight exaggeration: One expert estimated that by the 1830s Egypt was
fifth in the world regarding cotton spindles per capita, when it counted
about 80 mechanized spindles per one thousand population compared to 588
in Great Britain, 265 in Switzerland, 97 in the United States, 90 in
France, and 17 in Mexico.59</p>
<p>Marrying war, capitalism, and industrialization: Muhammad Ali Pasha
(illustration credit 6.9)</p>
<p>Tellingly, British government officials began to worry about losing
markets to such a “barbarian.” Sir John Bowring, a onetime member of the
British Parliament who was later governor of Hong Kong, observed in 1837
during his travels through Egypt that British cotton textiles, “formerly
so much used, are now scarcely at all sent to Egypt since muslins have
been woven in the new factories.” And such concerns were also raised in
regard to other markets: The Bombay Asiatic Journal reported in 1831
that “an Arab ship…from the Red Sea has brought 250 bales of cotton
yarn, the manufacture of Ali Pasha at his spinning mill near Cairo. It
is reported that he has sent 500 bales to Surat, 1,000 to Calcutta, and
that he intends next season to send long cloths, machapollams, etc. What
will the mercantile community say to this new competitor?”60</p>
<p>British merchants in India complained. In June 1831 they reported on
Egyptian imports into Calcutta, “This twist is of superior quality, even
surpassing that imported here from England…. Considering these facts, it
may be apprehended that the manufactures of Egypt are likely to
interfere with similar productions imported into this country from Great
Britain.” Further examination of Egyptian cotton imports having
convinced them that “thread is remarkably strong,” they concluded that
“considering the advantages the pasha possesses and his vicinity, we
conceive the British manufacturer is entitled to greater protection than
the above duty, and it is the intention of the agents here to address
government on this subject.”61</p>
<p>What they saw in Egypt impressed other observers as well. When in
1843 French textile manufacturer Jules Poulain studied the cotton mills
of Egypt and provided Ali with a detailed report on his observations, he
encouraged further efforts at industrialization. According to Poulain,
“It is industry that makes the wealth of nations.” Poulain, along with
Ali, believed that it was “natural [to] manufacture the product of one’s
agriculture.” Indeed, the fact that Egypt grew its own cotton would be a
comparative advantage vis-à-vis France and the United Kingdom. If the
French succeeded in the Indian town of Pondicherry (where they had just
opened a small spinning mill), Poulain believed, the Egyptians could
succeed in Egypt as well, not least because an “immense advantage” comes
from the fact that labor in Egypt was much cheaper.62</p>
<p>And here, at the labor question, Egypt’s story began to diverge. Much
more than European states, Ali followed the war capitalism model in
Egypt itself. Workers were forced to work in the factories. When the
first cotton textile workshops opened in the Khurunfish quarter of Cairo
sometime between 1816 and 1818, their skilled workers and machines came
from Europe, but the one thousand to two thousand rank-and-file workers
were Sudanese slaves and Egyptians coerced to work for minimal wages,
tightly supervised by the army. These workers were frequently abused. In
some ways, this system was not so different from elsewhere—with
government inducements for industrialization and orphans being forced to
work in factories—but still, coercion was more extreme in Egypt and wage
labor remained marginal. In some ways, Egypt’s rulers chose the
tried-and-true mechanisms of the global plantation complex as its path
into the world of the factory. Indeed, Ali demonstrated that war
capitalism could, at least in Egypt, and for a short time, give birth to
industrialization.63</p>
<p>War capitalism may have brought cotton industries to Egypt by
herculean determination, but the progeny did not last for long. By the
1850s, Egypt’s cotton industry had essentially disappeared, its
countryside littered with factory ruins. Egypt was never able to build
the institutional framework that would have enabled a full transition to
industrial capitalism; even something so basic as wage labor did not
take hold. Its reliance on war capitalism, both in the cotton fields and
in the cotton factories, ultimately limited the growth of domestic
markets. Egypt was, moreover, in the end unable to protect its domestic
market. British merchants worked hard to open Egyptian markets for their
goods, as Egypt weakened vis-à-vis European powers. The value of British
cotton goods exports to Egypt increased by an estimated factor of ten
between the second half of the 1820s and the second half of the 1830s.
When in 1838 the Anglo-Ottoman Tariff Treaty went into force, setting
import duties at only 8 percent ad valorem (that is, a percentage on the
value of the product), and in effect forcing free trade upon Egypt, it
“destroyed its first mechanized textile industry.” Combined with the
state’s difficulties running cotton mills and the problem of securing
sufficient fuel for steam-powered production, a system of “free trade”
dominated by Britain made it practically impossible for Egypt to
industrialize. Egypt’s cotton industry was devastated from two sides:
its domestic embrace of war capitalism and its ultimate subjugation to
British imperialism. The Egyptian state was powerful domestically, but
weak when it came to defining Egypt’s position within the global
economy, no match for British interests and designs.64</p>
<p>The negative impact of war capitalism on industrialization can be
seen in one other example: Brazil. At first glance, Brazil was a lot
like Egypt. It had a long history of cotton production, and Brazil grew
ample quantities of high-quality cotton. An oscillating colonial policy
in the eighteenth century had at times encouraged manufacturing in the
country’s new workshops, yet a 1785 royal decree had disallowed all
manufacturing, except for coarse cotton goods, because colonial
authorities were concerned that cotton factories competed with the labor
requirements of mining. But despite such laws, cotton manufacturing
emerged. And when the Portuguese royal family moved to Rio in 1808,
these decrees were revoked and a few cotton mills built. These mills
remained small and marginal; the São Paulo mill closed in the 1820s
because of its lack of access to skilled labor and inability to compete
with British textiles. When in 1844 the Alves Branco tariff raised
duties to 30 percent on most foreign manufactures, it encouraged the
development of a few new mills, but that tariff, and along with it the
industry, were short-lived. As a result, as late as 1865 there were just
nine cotton factories in Brazil with just 13,977 spindles—about
one-twentieth of those found in Egypt at the height of its cotton
industrialization, or one-tenth the number in Mexico.65</p>
<p>Brazil, unlike Mexico and, for a while, Egypt, thus failed to develop
its own mechanized cotton industry, despite its access to cotton,
capital, and technology. Indeed, Brazilian cotton industrialization had
to wait until the 1880s.66 This failure to industrialize was the direct
result of the peculiar political economy forged by politically
influential slaveholders. These powerful sugar and cotton planters
envisioned Brazil’s place in the global economy as the provider of
agricultural commodities produced by slave labor, a vision that ran
counter to a project of domestic industrialization.</p>
<p>In the important sugar-growing state of Bahia, merchants dealing in
agricultural commodities, for example, explicitly “opposed industrial
development and attempted to thwart it by denying it essential
government support”—despite Bahia’s access to coal, capital,
transportation infrastructure, and raw cotton, all of which made it ripe
for industrialization. Instead, the Bahian elite wanted the government
to invest in infrastructure to better move goods in and out of the world
market and favored allocating labor to agriculture. Most important to
them, however, slavery demanded low tariffs to facilitate the flow of
sugar and coffee from Brazil into global markets and thus precluded the
kind of protectionism that had enabled European, North American, and for
a time Egyptian industrialization: The Bahian Commercial Association, a
group of merchants, resisted tariffs as vocally and successfully as the
planters, as they remained firmly in thrall to the planters’
domination.67</p>
<p>Brazil’s budding cotton entrepreneurs faced other problems as well.
As capital was bound up in the production and trade in agricultural
commodities produced by slave labor and in the slave trade itself,
industrial enterprises often lacked access to credit. Moreover, labor
recruitment remained a problem. Because of the prevalence of slavery,
little wage labor was available for industrial employment, since
Europeans, unwilling to compete with slave labor, preferred to migrate
to other parts of the continent, such as Argentina. As a result, mills
drew on a mixture of wage and slave labor. But generally, labor was
concentrated in agriculture, and merchants saw “industry and
agriculture…as rivals for available labor.”68</p>
<p>Plantation slavery’s imperatives, the case of Brazil shows, could be
detrimental to industrialization. Not that slave labor as such was
incompatible with manufacturing—to the contrary, slaves could be
employed in cotton factories. However, a society dominated by slavery
was not conducive to cotton industrialization. Early industrialization
depended, globally, on war capitalism, but in regions of the globe in
which war capitalism took on its most violent edge cotton
industrialization never resulted. Cuba, for example, relied on a massive
number of enslaved workers, and yet did not have a single cotton mill
during the entire nineteenth century.69 The state of war between private
parties at the heart of war capitalism contradicted the emerging
imperatives of industrial capitalism. It was thus not just the capacity
of states that explains the spread of cotton manufacturing, but also the
distribution of power within them. Slave states were notoriously late
and feeble in supporting the political and economic interests of
domestic industrializers.</p>
<p>This was also the case in the slave territories within the United
States, the only country in the world divided between war and industrial
capitalism, a unique characteristic that would eventually spark an
unprecedentedly destructive civil war. In the southern United States,
one of the world’s most dynamic slave economies, there was little cotton
industrialization before the 1880s. To be sure, during and after the
Revolutionary War some mechanized cotton manufacturing emerged in the
southern states, and during the 1830s and thereafter a few textile mills
opened their doors. But as late as 1850, southern cotton mills only
consumed seventy-eight thousand bales of cotton, or one-sixth of the
cotton consumption of New England. Further expansion of manufacturing,
just as in Brazil, was hampered by the thriving slave economy that
concentrated capital, labor, and entrepreneurial talent on plantations,
limited the size of markets, made the region unattractive to European
immigrants, and did not force white yeoman farmers into wage work
(unlike, say, in New England and the Black Forest).70</p>
<p>War capitalism, in different ways, also limited opportunities for
industrialization elsewhere. The great premodern cotton power of India
did not just fail to leap forward via mechanization, but experienced the
world’s most rapid and cataclysmic deindustrialization ever. Faced with
huge imports of ever cheaper cotton yarns and fabrics from its colonial
ruler, and denied the services of its own government, India’s cotton
industry was decimated—first its production for export, and then its
domestic spinning. In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, as we have
seen, India lost its once central position in the global cotton industry
and, in a great historical irony, eventually became the world’s largest
market for British cotton exports.</p>
<p>Colonialism, by undermining the state capacity of colonized
territories and making them subservient to the interests of the
colonizers, was decisive. Huge domestic demand in India, unlike in
continental Europe, did not lead to state investment or
protection—despite access to cotton, capital, and abundant skill. To be
sure, there were some early efforts under French colonial auspices, and
indeed, the first mechanized spinning mill on the Indian subcontinent
was built in the French colony of Pondicherry in the 1830s, producing
guinée cloth for French West African markets. This Indian cotton mill
was, as it were, an infertile offspring of European capital,
intercolonial trade, and European states. Indian cotton
industrialization did not reappear until 1856 when the Parsi merchant
Cowasji Nanabhoy Davar opened the first modern cotton mill in Bombay.
The true takeoff of India’s cotton manufacturing, however, had to wait
until the 1870s, when the profits accumulated in the cotton trade during
the U.S. Civil War were reinvested into manufacturing.71</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century, many other parts of the
world with a vibrant cotton sector did not evolve to mechanized
production; all of these cases show that a whole range of factors had to
come together to jolt bureaucrats and capitalists into this new world of
industrial wealth creation. Even in the Yucatecan city of Valladolid,
the promising cotton venture of the Aurora Yucateca came to an end
during the late 1840s. Despite Don Pedro Baranda’s enormous
entrepreneurial energies, his mill eventually faltered. Constant
competition from British yarn smuggled in via the weakly guarded border
with British Honduras, yarn that was about 40 percent cheaper than the
goods produced in his factory, coupled with his inability to access the
highly protected Mexican markets thanks to Yucatecan efforts to be
independent of Mexico, brought an end to the venture. In 1847, Mayan
insurgents captured the city of Valladolid in the War of the Castes,
destroying the factory. The local state was too weak to protect its
borders, to subdue rebellion, or to create a unified market, showing
once again how important the state was to the lasting success of cotton
industrialization.72</p>
<p>Colonialism, the embrace of slavery, the expropriation of lands—war
capitalism, in short—had enabled the rise of industrial capitalism in
some parts of the world, while at the same time making its emergence
much less likely everywhere else. Industrial capitalism rested, as we
have seen, on a combination of capital and state power—creating markets
and mobilizing capital and labor in novel ways. The emergence of
industrial capitalism in the first half of the nineteenth century in
turn created the conditions for ever greater
territorialization—including the greater territorialization of capital,
that is, its attachment to particular nation-states.73</p>
<p>Crucial to this phase in the history of capitalism was the very
diversity of its forms. Capitalism rested on the coexistence of war
capitalism, with its violent expropriation of land and labor, its
peculiar state, and the uncoordinated and unrestrained initiatives of
its leading capitalists, with industrial capitalism, with its
administratively, infrastructurally, legally and militarily powerful
states channeling private initiative. The simultaneity of such different
but mutually dependent forms of capitalism might have been the true
innovation of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It was
not global integration by itself but the diversity of forms within that
global integration that explained the dramatic but also the wildly
different rates of cotton industrialization during these decades.</p>
<p>Capitalism, however, was not static. Enabled by war capitalism,
industrial capitalism created powerful new institutions and structures.
After the 1780s, a growing number of states built industrial capitalism,
eventually allowing for the emergence of new forms of integration of
labor, territory, markets, and capital in parts of the world that were,
in the mid-nineteenth century, still subject to some of the harshest
regimes of war capitalism ever invented. New ways of raising capital,
new ways of inserting capital into production, new forms of labor
mobilization, new forms of market making, and, last but not least, new
forms of the incorporation of land and people into the global capitalist
economy would emerge from this fertile yet often violent, even barbaric
intersection of war and industrial capitalism. From the 1860s on,
capital backed by state power rather than masters backed by
expropriation and private physical coercion, would colonize territories
and people.</p>
<p>The spread of cotton industrialization in the first half of the
nineteenth century, to continental Europe and a few places beyond,
showed that slavery and colonial exploitation were not essential to
capitalism.74 Capitalism reinvented itself ongoingly, and the lessons
and capabilities of one moment were subsumed in the next. The
connections between the global and the local, and among different
places, changed constantly. To be sure, the demise of war capitalism
stretched out for a century—from the Haitian revolution to the slow
decline of slavery in the Americas. But industrial capitalism’s
institutional innovations facilitated war capitalism’s death due to its
own contradictions, as strong states, which would spread to more regions
of the world, would enable labor mobilization in the global countryside
after the end of slavery. The modern world, indeed, has been shaped just
as much by war capitalism’s death as by its birth.</p>
<p>One of the greatest institutional innovations brought about by
capitalists’ and statesmen’s embrace of industrial capitalism, however,
was the invention of new forms of labor mobilization. While capitalism’s
vast labor in the Americas had been accomplished by enslaved Africans,
the huge labor needs of manufacturing industries were met by creating a
powerful new system of wage labor. Though wage labor was not free of
extralegal coercion, it was a new way to mobilize massive amounts of
labor. It put laborers and labor on an entirely different legal, social,
and institutional basis—and the ability to do so was the next factor
that set some parts of the world apart from others.</p>
