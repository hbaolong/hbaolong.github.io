<p>Cotton merchants in India. (illustration credit 11.1)</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of industrial capitalism after 1865, as we have
seen, transformed even more of the global countryside. Manufacturers in
the industrial heartlands of cotton’s empire demanded raw material,
labor, and markets, and their voracity was felt by the majority of
humanity who lived far from the urban centers of Europe and North
America. With the abolition of slavery in the United States, cultivators
in India, Egypt, the American South, Brazil, and, a few decades later,
West Africa and Central Asia found themselves drawn into new systems of
labor, producing vast and increasing quantities of cotton. Thanks to
their backbreaking and ill-remunerated labor, well into the twentieth
century trade in cotton and cotton goods “was still by far the largest
single trade” in both the Atlantic world and Asia. Even as late as the
1930s, the Japanese cotton traders of Toyo Menka Kaisha asserted that
“cotton is indisputably the prime commodity in the international trade
of the world.”1</p>
<p>In more general terms, the emergence of new systems of labor and the
stunning increase in raw cotton output pointed to one of the most
revolutionary projects of industrial capitalism, the creation of a new
relationship between manufacturing centers and the countryside. By the
1870s, as we have seen, capitalists had done what a few decades earlier
seemed impossible: fully integrated an ever larger swath of the global
countryside into serving the needs of industrial production without
drawing on the institution of slavery. The reason for this success was
clear: Powerful imperial states—which had come about not least thanks to
merchants’ and manufacturers’ persistent agitation—now possessed the
means to reach deeply into once remote parts of the world. The agents of
industrial capitalism rode railways that penetrated Berar, sent cotton
prices over telegraph cables that crossed the Atlantic, and followed
behind military expeditions that “pacified” Tashkent and Tanganyika.</p>
<p>These cotton kings riding on the coattails of a strengthened state
furthered a double process of creative destruction. They pushed
metropolitan capital closer to cotton producers outside the world’s
slave areas, in the process often destroying older merchant networks
that had moved cotton from field to factory prior to the 1860s. And they
undermined hand spinning and handloom weaving, effecting the world’s
most significant wave of deindustrialization ever. Millions of people,
especially women, gave up their spinning and weaving, work that had
structured their societies for centuries or even millennia.</p>
<p>In the last third of the nineteenth century, metropolitan capital and
manufactured goods moved into ever greater areas of the world’s
countryside. The success of European merchants was most remarkable in a
huge area in which they had traditionally been the weakest: Asia. It was
there that they managed to move closer to the actual producers and
consumers of cotton. By the 1870s, for example, Berar’s central market
town, Khamgaon, hosted merchants from Britain, Germany, France, Italy,
Switzerland, and the Habsburg Empire, all focused on acquiring raw
cotton. These merchants sent Indian agents into the nearby growing areas
to purchase the material raw, then they had it cleaned and pressed
before shipping it to the port of Bombay. They had now truly gained
control of the cotton trade, replacing a world they had inherited from
previous generations in which “the trade was entirely in the hands of
the local dealers.”2</p>
<p>It had been the terminal crisis of slave labor that pushed European
and later also Japanese merchants inland beyond the port cities of
India, Egypt, western Africa, and elsewhere. Already upon the first sign
of disintegration of slavery in 1861, manufacturers in the Manchester
Cotton Supply Association had hoped that Europeans could be
“induce[d]…to take up their position in the interior of India and
superintend the trade among Natives.” A year later, the India Office in
London had conveyed to the governor in council in Bombay that it
supported the “establishment of Agencies in these districts, for the
purpose of purchasing cotton direct from the cultivating classes,
instead of through middlemen.” Doing this in India was not so easy,
however, because Indian cotton dealers were deeply rooted in both the
local cotton trade and the social structure of cotton-producing
villages—in fact, without revolutionizing the Indian social structure it
was hard to imagine that European capitalists would ever be able to
replace their Indian counterparts. But they did, not least thanks to the
support they received from an increasingly powerful imperial state, and
by 1878 a British colonial administrator observed that “the [cotton]
trade [of Berar]…has fallen almost entirely into the hands of European
merchants.”3</p>
<p>Among the European capitalists who came to dominate cotton production
in a remote hinterland of industrial capitalism such as Berar’s Khamgaon
was the firm of Volkart Brothers. Headquartered in the quaint town of
Winterthur near the shores of Lake Constance, these Swiss merchants had
been active in the Indian cotton trade since 1851, relying on the
services of Indian brokers to purchase cotton for European markets. In
the last third of the nineteenth century, however, they had moved their
capital ever closer to the actual cotton growers, creating purchasing
agencies in cotton-growing regions of India, including Khamgaon, and
erecting cotton gins and presses. Agents in the employ of Volkart would
purchase cotton from local dealers, have it processed in the firm’s own
gins, then press it at “Volkart’s Press” and send it by rail to Bombay,
where it was branded by Volkart agents to be shipped to Liverpool, Le
Havre, or Bremen to be sold to mill owners who put great trust in the
“VB” stamped on the bales. While the old system had relied on many
intermediary merchants, Volkart now single-handedly connected cotton
growers to cotton manufacturers.4</p>
<p>European capital moves into the Indian countryside: Volkart Brothers

<p>By 1883, sixteen Volkart presses dotted the Berar countryside and by
1920 Volkart would be the largest shipper of Indian-grown cotton,
selling more than 180,000 bales, or one-quarter of the total exports.
And the Volkarts were not alone. They worked side by side the agencies,
gins, and presses of other European merchants, including the Rallis,
Knoops, and Siegfrieds. In the early twentieth century, Japanese cotton
trading firms joined in: Toyo Menka Kaisha alone counted 156 Indian
subagencies by 1926, and most of the firm’s profits derived from such
hinterland trading activities.5</p>
<p>As European and Japanese exporters moved into once remote
cotton-producing towns, rural cultivators were able to sell their
products to global markets. To be sure, smaller dealers and moneylenders
who connected the growers to European and Japanese merchants persisted,
providing Indian peasants with the capital they needed to acquire seeds,
pay their taxes, and tide them over to the next harvest, almost always
at ruinous rates of interest. These sowkars were deeply rooted in the
villages and European dealers depended on them—just as the locals needed
the access to the markets and capital provided by European traders.6</p>
<p>Despite the persistence of sowkars, however, long-dominant Indian
cotton merchants who, as late as the 1850s, had played a major role in
the export of cotton, were pushed to the margins of the trade. Despite
the riches that they had accumulated during the American Civil War, many
went under during the rapid fall in cotton prices in its aftermath.
Moreover, the changes in transportation infrastructure and the advent of
the telegraphic connection to Liverpool and with it the trade in futures
on Indian cotton squeezed the speculative profits of merchants who sold
on consignment. Major European merchants responded by vertically
integrating their businesses—connecting growers and manufacturers—as the
Volkarts had done with spectacular success, a move that Indian
merchants, who lacked the ability to establish a presence close to
European manufacturers, could not replicate. As a result, Indian
merchants were increasingly under pressure, especially in the overseas
trade. In 1861, they still exported 67 percent of all cotton from
Bombay, but by 1875 their share had fallen to just 28 percent, and it
kept declining. Unable to compete in the overseas cotton trade, some of
these merchants would invest their capital in fledgling Indian cotton
mills.7</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, the infusion of capital into cotton
production evolved in similar ways. In Egypt, for one, “merchants sent
agents out into the villages to buy small lots,” either from local
traders or from the cultivators directly, replacing the once total
monopoly of the Egyptian viceroy. Many of these merchants were Greeks
who had come to Egypt in the wake of the cotton boom of the Civil War,
and almost all were part of family or place-of-origin networks that
stretched not just into Greece but also to Trieste, Marseille, London,
and Manchester.8</p>
<p>In the Çukurova in western Anatolia, things followed a similar
pattern with Greek and Christian Arab merchants taking on that role, at
first in interaction with Armenian traders who connected their
transmediterranean networks to the rural cultivators themselves. By the
1880s, however, foreign banks and trading companies had moved in,
muscling aside local capitalists. In 1906, the German Cotton Society of
the Levant began its operations, in 1909 the Deutsche Orient Bank opened
a branch in Mersin, and a year later Deutsche Bank began investing
heavily in irrigation schemes. In exceptional cases, the capitalization
of the countryside went even one step further, with foreign investors
owning entire cotton plantations. In La Laguna, Mexico, British
investors operated the huge cotton-growing hacienda Compañía Agricola,
Industrial y Colonizadora del Tlahualilo; in Mississippi, the British
Spinners Ltd. owned the Delta and Pine Land Company with its
thirty-seven thousand acres of cotton lands.9</p>

and manufacturers, 1925: purchasing and sales organization (illustration

<p>Even in the cotton states of North America, long subject to vast
infusions of European capital, the relationship between merchants and
cotton growers increasingly evolved toward the imperial model pioneered
in India and Egypt, which worked to marginalize cotton growers. Before
the Civil War, the United States had been exceptional as the only major
cotton-growing area in the world dependent on and receptive to European
capital. But in the United States, unlike, for instance, India,
merchants had played a relatively subordinate role vis-à-vis the
powerful growers of cotton—the planters. That changed in the late
nineteenth century, as merchants gained new powers and capital entered
the southern countryside in new ways.10</p>
<p>The slow disappearance of factors was at the core of the recasting of
the cotton trade in the United States. Where factors had typically
advanced capital to planters, sold their crops, and provided them with
supplies, now they were displaced by merchants who settled in interior
towns. As transportation and communication access to the southern
hinterland improved dramatically in the wake of the Civil War, and as
the empire of cotton moved farther into the West, growers sold their
cotton directly to merchants or mill agents, or even to foreign buyers,
instead of entrusting it for sale to a factor in a distant port. As a
result, interior Texas cities such as Dallas, far away from the ocean,
became important cotton-trading places in their own right. As early as
1880, Dallas counted thirty-three such cotton buyers, many of them
agents of giant European and American firms, such as Alexander Sprunt of
Wilmington, North Carolina, or Frank and Monroe Anderson, who, along
with Will Clayton, organized Anderson, Clayton andandandand Co. to
become the largest cotton dealers in the world.11</p>
<p>Jean D. Zerbini: Greek cotton merchant in Egypt (illustration credit
11.4)</p>
<p>With the purchasing of cotton moving into American hinterland towns,
cotton presses and gins were built there as well, and experts, such as
cotton classifiers, moved in, paralleling developments in India, Egypt,
and elsewhere. Local merchants began purchasing the crop, as the
telegraph communicated Liverpool and New York prices rapidly to the
remotest southern towns, just as it did to Khamgaon. At the same time,
the railroads increasingly brought a panoply of goods to small rural
stores, further undermining the former role of the factor as supplier of
plantations. And these merchants increasingly provided credit to
growers, usurping yet another function of antebellum factors. The old
factors responded to this new situation by becoming interior buyers
themselves, another blow to the old system of factorage. As a result,
“cotton marketing moved inland,” and by the early 1870s representatives
of Manchester spinners purchased cotton directly in towns such as
Memphis. Alexander Sprunt and Son, for example, ran purchasing agencies
all over the southern states and selling agencies in Bremen, Liverpool,
New England, and Japan, paralleling in many ways Volkart’s operations in
India.12</p>
<p>In India, Egypt, the United States, and elsewhere metropolitan
capital gained new powers over cotton growers, marginalizing both local
control over the trade as well as the formerly powerful cotton planters
of the American South now defeated in war. Yet ironically, under
manufacturers’ pressure to deliver the cheapest possible cotton, the
commission-intensive business of importers, brokers, and factors were
increasingly squeezed as well, and eventually replaced by a much
simpler—and much less expensive—system of trade. In fact, so successful
had merchants become in connecting distant growers and manufacturers to
one another that their own labor had become less and less important.</p>
<p>Pressured by manufacturers who sought to cut transaction costs, the
myriad intermediaries who had moved cotton from the plantation to the
factory before the 1860s consolidated, to be replaced by a few
vertically integrated cotton dealers. New characters now strode onto the
cotton empire’s stage, people who would connect growers directly to
manufacturers. The old-style importers and brokers declined. Some, such
as the Browns, in a savvy move, had already mostly exited the cotton
business before the Civil War. Others, such as the Rathbones,
accumulated huge losses after the war, and then retreated from the
trade. Lower transaction costs meant lower profits for people invested
in the cotton trade, giving a premium to those able to secure a vastly
increased quantity of goods. One of the nineteenth century’s greatest
authorities on the global cotton trade, Thomas Ellison, estimated that
between 1870 and 1886 transaction costs, as a percentage of the value of
the traded cotton, fell by 2.5 percent.13</p>
<p>The role of merchants also changed because, as the result of the
state-driven transformation of the countryside, connecting growers and
producers of raw cotton had become much simpler. As we have seen, states
projected themselves into the world’s countryside, using contract law,
new forms of property rights in land, railroads, and the imperial
control of territory, giving manufacturers a more direct and immediate
access to the world’s countryside and its increasingly marginalized
cotton growers.</p>
<p>The importance of old-fashioned importers, brokers, and factors
within the empire of cotton declined even more as the global cotton
trade was increasingly dominated by a small number of cotton exchanges.
Trades on these exchanges no longer rested on trust networks forged by
religious, kin, or place-of-origin solidarities. Instead, these
institutions were impersonal marketplaces in which anyone at any time
could trade in any quantity and quality of cotton for immediate or
future delivery, or could speculate on the future price movements of
cotton that had not been shipped, or perhaps not even grown. Such cotton
exchanges spread rapidly across the globe: In 1869, the New York Cotton
Exchange opened, followed by the New Orleans Cotton Exchange in 1871,
and further exchanges in Le Havre, Bremen, Osaka, Shanghai, São Paulo,
Bombay, and Alexandria. These exchanges specialized in the trading of
contracts on the future delivery of cotton. Such “to arrive” trading, as
we have seen, had already emerged in a sporadic way before the 1860s,
but now “futures” took off to become the dominant mode of the global
cotton trade, made possible by the accelerated speed at which
information traveled around the globe, facilitated, most crucially, by
the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866.14</p>
<p>These emerging commodity markets were sophisticated institutions.
They would have been unrecognizable to the Holts and Drinkwaters, and
their counterparts, who hurried around the port of Liverpool in the
1810s inspecting sacks of cotton arriving from the Americas. Now trade
was highly abstracted from the actual physical cotton and highly
standardized, the great variety of nature molded through conventions and
contracts into categories that corresponded to the abstractions capital
required to make it commensurable.</p>
<p>Most important was the standardization of cotton itself. The huge
natural variety of cotton, for the purposes of trades in futures, was
impossible to handle and thus was fictitiously reduced to just
one—“middling upland”—and contracts were standardized to specific lot
sizes of this quality. These standards, as we have seen, had been
defined in the years before the American Civil War by the Liverpool
Cotton Brokers’ Association. In the 1870s its successor organization,
the Liverpool Cotton Association, took over this definition of quality
and the implementation of standards—a direct consequence of the city’s
central position in the global cotton empire. Detailed rules for the
classification of cottons, and mechanisms for the arbitration of
disputes between sellers and buyers, made both the knowledge and the
trust networks of previous generations of merchants much less central.
As historian Kenneth Lipartito notes, the “speculation in futures helped
to impose worldwide supply and demand conditions on local markets, thus
moving the entire cotton trade towards the ideal of a single market with
a single, internationally determined price for each grade of
cotton.”15</p>
<p>A dockworker weighing cotton in the Port of Liverpool (illustration
credit 11.5)</p>
<p>As a result of this restructuring of the global cotton market,
business grew rapidly. While the New York Cotton Exchange traded
contracts for the future delivery of 5 million bales in 1871–72
(slightly more than the actual harvest), it traded contracts on 32
million bales ten years later—an amount seven and a half times the
actual cotton harvest. The global cotton trade now took place not in
securing actual cotton, but in speculating on future price movements of
the commodity. That speculation was made possible by the exchanges’
ability to create one “world price” for cotton, a price available at any
minute of the day in all cotton-growing and -manufacturing centers.16 No
longer was the trade in cotton shaped by the leisurely pace of
importers, factors, and brokers walking the streets of port towns
throughout the empire of cotton—now the rhythms of industrial capital
and, increasingly, of finance dominated the cotton trade.</p>
<p>The New York Cotton Exchange, 1923 (illustration credit 11.6)</p>
<p>The role of merchants diminished not least because many of their core
functions were usurped by states. Even the all-important standards on
which contracts increasingly rested, based as we have seen on private
contractual arrangements of merchants and enforced by the Liverpool
Cotton Association, were after the turn of the century increasingly
defined and enforced by state classifiers in the United States. The
shift of the all-important power of definition from private associations
such as the Liverpool Cotton Association to the state, from England to
the United States, was the result of the growing U.S. influence on the
global economy, and also the political pressure of cotton producers in
the United States, who felt disadvantaged by Liverpool’s rules. In 1914,
the “Official Cotton Standards of the United States” were created, their
use required for all futures transactions. In 1923, the Cotton Standards
Act made it illegal to use any other standards for American cotton in
interstate or foreign commerce, and as a result these standards also
guided transactions on European cotton exchanges. With government
classifiers in government classing rooms housed in cotton exchanges, the
state had entrenched itself in the very heart of the global cotton
trade.17</p>
<p>Moreover, the state also became an important supplier of statistics
that made the market more legible, rendering much less central the
sophisticated networks of information gathering and exchange that
merchants had forged through huge investments in time and treasure.
Beginning in July 1863, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued
monthly reports on cotton production. In 1894 it launched the annual
Agricultural Yearbook, a huge compendium of statistics, and by 1900 it
was issuing crop reports collected by “41 full-time, paid statistic
agents and their 7,500 assistants. 2,400 volunteer county correspondents
and their 6,800 assistants and 40,000 volunteer township or district
correspondents.” Two years later, the Census Bureau was charged by
Congress to collect annually “the statistics of the cotton production of
the country as returned by ginners.” By 1905, there was even an
International Institute of Agriculture with its own statistics bureau,
created by none other than the king of Italy. The state, centrally
concerned with the reliable flow of inexpensive raw materials into the
vortex of manufacturing enterprises, now quite literally made the
market.18</p>
<p>Not content with marginalizing both cotton growers and older merchant
networks, imperial statesmen, manufacturers, and new kinds of commodity
dealers also worked diligently on their long-term project of destroying
the older worlds of cotton that still persisted in many regions. They
drove a complex dynamic of deindustrialization in the now global
countryside. Each spinner and weaver who gave up her or his handicraft
created a potential new market for European and North American
manufacturers, who, as we have seen, had already ousted Indian textiles
from world markets earlier in the century. But now, in the last third of
the nineteenth century, statesmen, manufacturers, and dealers broke
through local barriers to foreign cotton consumption in the former
heartlands of the worlds of cotton. Rural cultivators and former
spinners and weavers in many parts of the world became first-time buyers
of European, North American, and eventually Japanese yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>No market was more important than the ancient home of the world’s
cotton industry. Asia’s cotton markets were vast, and winning them was
the grand prize that British, French, Dutch, Spanish, and American
imperialism bestowed, not just on Lancashire manufacturers, but on some
continental European, North American, and Japanese manufacturers as
well.19 India in particular became a huge market—already in 1843 it was
for British manufacturers their most important customer, and it remained
central for about a century thereafter. By 1900, 78 percent of the total
production of the British cotton industry was exported, much of it to
India.20</p>
<p>European manufacturers’ success was the more remarkable in light of
their earlier failures. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,
high transportation costs had made inland markets in Asia as well as
Africa largely inaccessible, and even in markets open to European
merchants, selling European cotton goods was difficult. A typical story
of these early years suggests the reasons why: British merchant Richard
Kay, who traded cotton with India and China, went to Calcutta to sell
yarn. There he was overwhelmed by the difficulties he encountered,
annoyed by the “tribe of native merchants.” He suffered from the heat,
and became sick on his travels to outlying villages. When he went to
Allahabad, he complained about being “pestered with all sorts of
dealers, viz cloth merchants.” In the vast Indian subcontinent, the
Asiatic Journal reported, “Nearly the whole inland trade in European
goods is in [local merchants’] hands, and they furnish at present the
principal medium for procuring an extended circulation for our
broadcloths, cotton, copper, iron, andandandand c.” As a result,
“British manufactured goods have as yet displaced, but to a very limited
extent, the Native cotton cloth manufactures of Western India, and it is
impossible for them to do so until improved means of transit and
communication enable the respective manufacturers to compete on more
equal terms.”21</p>
<p>Yet already by the 1830s, in a great reversal of one of the world’s
oldest trade patterns, larger quantities of British-manufactured cottons
began to flow into places where for centuries and even millennia hand
spinning and weaving had flourished, to be followed by French, Swiss,
and other products. When “free trade” was imposed upon the Ottoman
Empire in 1838 and British cloth “flooded the market in Izmir,” local
cotton workers lost their ability to maintain their old production
regime. In coastal southeastern Africa, cotton yarn and cloth imports
also began to devastate the local cotton textile industry. In Mexico,
European cotton imports had a serious impact on local
manufacturing—before tariffs enabled Mexican industrialization,
Guadalajara’s industry had been, as one historian found, “virtually
eliminated.” In Oaxaca, 450 out of 500 looms ceased operating. In China,
the 1842 Treaty of Nanking forced the opening of markets, and the
subsequent influx of European and North American yarn and cloth had a
“devastating” effect, especially on China’s hand spinners.22</p>
<p>Capturing the Asian market: British cloth exports to India and China,
in millions of yards, 1820–1920 (illustration credit 11.7)</p>
<p>India was the grandest market of them all. By 1832, the great house
of Baring, never one to miss a chance for profit, partnered with a local
merchant house in Calcutta, Gisborne and Company, to export British
yarn. It also financed the yarn and cloth trade to China and Egypt.
Thanks to the efforts of merchants like Gisborne, increasing quantities
of British cottons flowed into the Indian market, “to an extent that
might have been previously considered impossible,” according to the
Bombay Chamber of Commerce in 1853. Tellingly, Manchester manufacturers
McConnel andandandand Kennedy, who had earlier in the century found most
of their yarn customers in continental Europe, by the 1860s were
corresponding mostly with customers in Calcutta, Alexandria, and
similarly distant parts of the world, while Fielden Brothers expanded
production so rapidly that they began to think about sending cloth for
the “mass of poor people” to Calcutta. Machine production demanded ever
more markets to remain profitable.23 Yet despite these efforts, in the
first half of the nineteenth century the older centers of the world of
cotton still retained significant handicraft production. By 1850,
Britain’s market share in India, it has been estimated, was only 11.5
percent.24</p>
<p>Capturing these ancient markets took many decades, the final
breakthrough only occurring on the backs of imperial states. Indeed,
creating markets for metropolitan manufacturers was a conscious project
of colonial administrations. The global South was to be a market for
metropolitan industry, not a competitor, and a supplier of raw materials
and labor, and both required the destruction of indigenous
manufacturing. Colonial governments created systems of tariffs and
excise duties that discriminated against indigenous producers. They also
prioritized the construction of new infrastructures tailored not to
local needs but to global market access. They also devoted significant
time and money to the study of foreign cloth markets to help their
manufacturers compete in distant places. The Bombay Chamber of Commerce
had urged in 1853 “to ascertain, if possible, what are the principal
seats of consumption for each particular description of goods, and what
the route by which such goods arrive at their respective ultimate
destination…. It is a matter of great interest, both to the Merchants of
Bombay and to Manufacturers at home, to know more definitely to what
extent and in what direction the import trade of Western Indies is being
extended.” Twenty years later, in 1873, J. Forbes Watson’s Collection of
Specimens and Illustrations of the Textile Manufacturers of India
(Second Series), a beautiful four-volume set of books, contained
hundreds of samples of Indian cloth, including detailed descriptions,
with length, width, weight, and place of origin. Some samples even list
their price per yard—all to enable European manufacturers to compete in
Indian markets by copying these fabrics. And in 1906 “the secretary of
state deputed an India office official to examine the products of the
handlooms of India with a view to ascertaining whether any of the
Indian-made goods could not be profitably supplied by the power-loom
industry of Great Britain.”25</p>
<p>Agents of deindustrialization: K. Astardjan, cotton merchants of

and elsewhere, presenting samples of Manchester cloth to customers in

<p>Selling cotton yarn to India: Volkart Brothers markets to local
tastes. (illustration credit 11.9)</p>
<p>China’s markets were just as tempting. In 1887, a British bureaucrat
stationed in Ning-po issued a “Report on the Native Cotton Manufacturers
of the District of Ning-Po” to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in
which he “furnish[ed] samples of the cotton cloths…in common wear here.”
The British consul in China years earlier had already forwarded two
boxes of “ordinary clothing worn by the labouring population of several
districts of China, to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, including
accounts of the costs of these.” It was exhibited in Manchester at the
Chamber of Commerce for two days and “received many visitors.” And the
efforts of manufacturers and imperial governments were successful.
Britain’s market share in India increased to about 60 percent in 1880.
Bengali merchants protested against the wave of British imports, but to
no avail.26</p>
<p>As cotton yarn and cloth from the heartlands of the world’s cotton
industry flowed into the world’s cotton-growing areas newly constituted
as backwaters, they brought with them a tsunami of deindustrialization.
“The importation of cheap machine-made piece goods has in many parts
driven the native spinners and weavers altogether out of the market, and
many have had to take to working on the roads, or have been engaged as
farm-labourers,” observed Berar cotton commissioner Harry Rivett-Carnac
in 1869.</p>
<p>Clothing the colonial and neocolonial world: cotton cloth exports
from the UK, 1820–1920, by destination (illustration credit 11.10)</p>
<p>In the middle of the nineteenth century, millions of people still
spun and wove by hand, as they had done for centuries. Competition from
industrially produced yarn and cloth had begun to undermine that
production in the first half of the century, especially in Europe and
North America, and it had effectively destroyed cloth production for
export in India. In the centers of the old worlds of cotton, however,
where people produced yarn and cloth within households for local
consumption, these changes still seemed remote. But now in the last
third of the nineteenth century this was about to change. Usually these
changes unfolded slowly and were at first hardly noticeable—a new
railroad line opened bringing in yarns from faraway factories, for
example—but sometimes they could also occur quite suddenly. In India the
American Civil War was such an event. During that war, many spinners
found themselves unable to compete with the market price for their
crucial raw material. The Madras Chamber of Commerce in its 1863 report
observed that “the enhanced price of Cotton has rendered the position of
the Cotton Weavers of this Presidency one of great difficulty.” As a
result, the number of weavers decreased by as much as 50 percent during
the American war, with former weavers moving into agricultural labor.
Thus in a large swath of India, integration into the world market went
hand in hand with widespread “peasantization,” not, as one might expect,
proletarianization.27</p>
<p>As former craft workers were drawn into cotton cultivation,
deindustrialization swept over their world in the following decades. In
Berar, “The manufacture of home made cloth has been undermined by the
importation of English Piece Goods, and many of the weaver class have
become ordinary labourers,” remarked the assistant commissioner in
charge of cotton of the government of India in 1874. With less cloth
manufactured at home, reported Berar’s cotton commissioner, “The
home-made cloths affect not at all the supply of raw materials which
England confidently expects from the Berars.”28</p>
<p>For European cotton manufacturers this was reason to celebrate. When
Edmund Potter spoke at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce he was cheered
by “hear, hear” calls from the otherwise staid audience:</p>
<p>The great expenditure in our military operations; the great outlay in
making public works…and the increasing consumption by this country…of
the agricultural products of India; all these things have circulated
money among and raised in some degree the social condition of the ryots
[cultivators] of that country, so that their consumption of manufactured
goods has increased. One letter informs me that in some districts the
weavers are leaving their ill-paid operations in that handicraft, and
are resuming the occupation we wish them to follow, namely, agricultural
operations—(“Hear, hear”)—because there is no question the real interest
of India would be best promoted by developing the agricultural products
of its fertile soil. (“Hear”)29</p>
<p>“Dacca” calicoes, now manufactured in Britain: Gidlow Mills in Wigan,
as seen in 1908 (illustration credit 11.11)</p>
<p>For British cotton merchants and manufacturers, news of the
deindustrialization of India was so welcome that it allowed for a slight
relaxation of decorum.</p>
<p>By the end of the century, that decline had brought with it social
catastrophe. In Bengal “from every district it is reported that owing to
the widespread use of European piece-goods, which are cheaper and finer,
though not always more durable, Indian manufactured goods have gradually
disappeared.” One district, Parganas, testified that “weavers have been
largely driven from their hereditary calling to agriculture.” When
famine struck the Bombay Presidency in 1896–97 the final report of the
Revenue Department stated that weavers suffered “not only from the
failure of crops and high prices but from the absence of demand for
their products.” Such stories can be told about many regions of the
world.30</p>
<p>Yet despite these pessimistic reports, domestic production did not
disappear. In the Ottoman Empire weavers took advantage of access to
cheaper (imported) yarn, and catered successfully to highly
differentiated local markets, doing fairly well throughout the
nineteenth century. Historians of China have observed that while hand
spinning diminished rapidly (by 1913 only 25 percent of all yarn used in
China was spun at home), weaving remained, and during the 1930s 70
percent of cloth was still produced in homes, indeed well into the
socialist period home manufacturing survived. In Latin America, the
home-based production of cottons persisted as well, especially among
indigenous communities. Historians of African manufacturing also observe
that “contemporary statements as to the complete hegemony of import
cottons have no validity outside fairly restricted zones”—basically
places near European settlements. Even in India, as the British colonial
Department of Commerce and Industry reported in 1906, “The weaving of
cloth by hand is not, however, by any means extinct, after agriculture
it is still the most important occupation of the native of India, and is
pursued, in some parts, as an independent means of livelihood or in
order to supplement the earnings derived from agriculture, and in
others, as a purely domestic occupation.”31</p>
<p>As the world shifted under their feet, and without the power to
respond politically to these shifts, local cotton producers adapted as
well as they could. At first, faced with the loss of their export
markets, they retooled to supply domestic consumers, by producing
coarser goods. They also focused, often successfully, on market niches
not supplied by European manufacturers, and on producing more durable
cloth. The Commerce and Industries Department reported with some regret
of “the difficulty of penetrating too many of the up-country markets,
the effects of custom, of caste, of religious beliefs, of the barter
system, and so on, has prevented the process from proceeding with the
rapidity which it would otherwise have attained.” As late as 1920, there
were still about 2.5 million handloom weavers remaining in India. Even
Mahatma Gandhi, who made the devastating impact of colonialism on
domestic industry a key aspect of his political campaigns, admitted in
1930 that “next to agriculture, hand-weaving is still the largest and
most widespread industry throughout the whole of India”—not least
because despite all the rapid advances, the capitalist reorganization of
the countryside remained far from complete in the early twentieth
century.32</p>
<p>If these adjustments did not suffice, weavers tried to reduce the
costs of their product by moving production farther into the countryside
and giving female household members a more prominent role in production.
In the Ottoman Empire, cotton textile production increasingly moved away
from male, guild-based labor toward female and child labor, often in the
countryside. Deindustrialization, as often as not, shaped gender
inequalities as it undermined household economies. Indeed, the ability
of local manufacturing to survive was often rooted in the gendered
social structure of the countryside, where workers, often women, were
idle during parts of the year, and families perceived the “cost” of
continuing to produce textiles for family consumption or even sale as
extremely low. “In Assam and Burma,” tellingly reported the Department
of Industry and Commerce, “weaving forms part of a girl’s education and
woman’s ordinary household duties. The family…is supplied in this
manner, and the articles turned out are seldom offered for sale; when
the surplus production is disposed of in the local market, the cost of
the labour spent in the domestic occupation practiced during leisure
hours is not taken into consideration in calculating the price.” The
incomplete transition to capitalism, in fact, enabled the
super-exploitation of members of households who could labor for less
than the cost of their subsistence.33</p>
<p>Spinners and weavers also tried collectively to resist the
destruction of their ancient industries—from the Black Forest to China
to India—but their movements confronted the ever more concentrated power
of imperial states allied closely with manufacturers. In the early
nineteenth century, spinners in the Black Forest had set machinery
ablaze. In 1860, spinners rioted in Guangzhou in response to waves of
European imports.34 But states did not take kindly to such rebellions. A
group of Indian weavers reported on tax collectors resorting to torture
to force them to pay their taxes</p>
<p>by Binding up with chords and wood cut out for the purpose, the most
delicate and private places, by placing stone on their head and backs;
By making them to stand in the sun, by pinching the thighs and the ears,
by pulling the whiskers, by tying the locks of one man to that of one
another, by sealing the doors of Houses, by selling at Auction the
Property of others which they obtained by force of arms, by the
confinement of some of us, without allowing them to go to their means;
by abusing and striking some, and abusing others and making use of
violent and coercive means.35</p>
<p>Unrestrained violence did not just characterize the world of the
slave plantation. Weavers understood the logic of this new political
economy well, though they lacked the power to alter it: “Those who come
to India from Europe…after having collected large fortunes, take the
same to Europe, all which is obtained from our Labour, but we ourselves
are left without means of support.”36</p>
<p>Despite individual resistance and collective protest, the overall
trend was unwavering and ultimately devastating: around the globe
millions of household cotton spinners and weavers lost their ability to
spin and weave. In India alone, historian Tirthankar Roy concluded,
“There is undeniable empirical evidence that the community of
hand-spinners gave up spinning on a large scale, and this factor alone
may account for a loss of industrial employment to the extent of 4–5
million persons.” Other historians have suggested that the loss of
manufacturing between 1830 and 1860 amounted to between 2 and 6 million
full-time jobs in India alone. The vast expansion of cotton
manufacturing in Europe and the increasing orientation of large swaths
of the global countryside toward the growing of cotton for export
destabilized and even destroyed ancient cotton manufacturing—with
devastating consequences for spinners, weavers, and rural cultivators
alike.37</p>
<p>Life in much of the world’s cotton-growing countryside had always
been difficult at best. A focus on growing cotton for export could, both
theoretically and in fact, be beneficial to rural cultivators. Many
peasants, as we have seen, profited from rising cotton prices during the
American Civil War. Yet the radical recasting of ever larger swaths of
the world’s countryside also had less positive consequences. Most
crucially, it undermined food security. During the American Civil War,
British officials in Ahmedabad, Haira, and Surat had reported that “the
increasing area of land devoted to cultivation of Articles of Export,
such as Cotton…[has led to a] proportionate decrease in cultivation of
articles of food.” As a result, food prices rose between 1861 and 1865
by more than 325 percent, and even Sir Charles Trevelyan had to admit
that “at the present high prices of food, the body of the people, in
several parts of India, are barely able to subsist.” In Egypt, the
situation was quite similar. Once a grain-exporting country, it became
dependent on imports of food crops as the result of its greater
dedication to cotton during the American Civil War. When in the summer
of 1863 disease killed nearly all of Egypt’s cattle, a food crisis
emerged in which tens of thousands of felaheen perished.38</p>
<p>The increasing world market orientation of cotton cultivators also
had significant effects on social structures. Throughout western India’s
Maharashtra, for example, British efforts to increase revenue and
encourage peasants to participate in distant markets led to the
undermining of the collective nature of villages, making individual
peasants instead of villages as a whole responsible for taxes, and
handing judicial power to distant courts instead of village-based and
peasant-dominated tribunals. The market now increasingly subsumed all
aspects of society, not just in Lancashire or Alsace, but in Berar and
Lower Egypt as well. In Anatolia, “a large-scale transition to a
cash-crop economy” took place in response to the cotton boom, with
cotton replacing food crops, the abolition of feudal social relations in
the countryside, and the financing of the crop by local merchants who
charged peasants interest rates between 33 and 50 percent. In Egypt as
well, the booming cotton export industry, according to historian Alan
Richards, “destroyed the old quasi-communal forms of land tenure, broke
up the protective web of village social relations, replaced them with
private property in land and individual tax responsibility, and helped
create four classes: large landowners…, rich peasants…, small peasant
landowners, and a landless class.” As early as the 1840s, the government
had begun compelling peasants to grow specific crops, including cotton,
and to “deliver them to government warehouses.” Peasants had responded
to this pressure by leaving the land in droves, which the government
took as a reason to deny any claims to the land by those who had
“deserted” it. By 1862, anyone who left the land for more than two
months lost his claim to the property. In 1863, when Isma’il, Egypt’s
new ruler, took power, he focused his efforts on creating large estates,
giving land to relatives and officials in his government, and forcing
peasants to work on infrastructure projects and on his own plantations.
Resistance to such measures was violently repressed.39</p>
<p>The most serious impact on cotton farmers, however, emerged after the
American Civil War. Once world market prices declined after the onset of
the global depression of 1873, Indian, Egyptian, Brazilian, and American
rural cultivators had a hard time making up for lost income, as falling
prices made it ever more difficult to repay loans and make tax payments.
The price for Surat cotton delivered in Liverpool between 1873 and 1876
fell by 38 percent. Cotton growers in Brazil, Egypt, India, the United
States, and elsewhere, often highly indebted to local moneylenders, now
faced plummeting returns on their cash crops. In India and Brazil, the
problems were compounded by severe droughts that led to a rapid increase
in food prices. Though historians disagree as to how much the fall in
world market prices affected cotton growers, at the very least world
market integration increased the economic uncertainty faced by people in
remote corners of the world. Their incomes, and quite literally their
survival, were now linked to global price fluctuations over which they
had no control. All too often, the only response open to farmers with
little control over the land was to grow more cotton to make up for lost
income due to falling prices—which resulted in a glut of cotton that
depressed prices even further.</p>
<p>What wage workers, tenants, and sharecroppers had in common was that
they had lost access to subsistence agriculture—basic production and
consumption now depended on global markets. While “cotton [was once] a
subordinate product” and “the ryot [did] not neglect the raising of food
for the sake of cotton, however high its price may be, for in doing so
he runs the risk of starvation,” by the late nineteenth century millions
of rural cultivators became primarily dependent on cotton. Moreover, as
world market integration usually went along with social differentiation,
a growing group of landless tenants and agricultural laborers
periodically faced life-threatening difficulty in accessing food crops.
In Africa, one author found that “cotton and food insecurity went hand
in hand.” In La Laguna, Mexico, an unprecedented percentage of children
suffered from malnutrition. In Argentina, misery characterized small
cotton-growing farms.40</p>
<p>Between 1864 and 1873 the amount of cotton that a tenant or farmer
had to produce to buy a given quantity of Berar’s most important food
grain, jowar, doubled, and then it doubled again by 1878. Perhaps even
more significant, the relative price of grains to cotton changed
dramatically from year to year (changes of 20 percent or even 40 percent
were not exceptional), introducing a new level of uncertainty into
cotton growers’ precarious lives. As one historian of India has
remarked, “Successful participation in markets requires economic
autonomy and the capacity to take risks and sustain losses. Poor and
indebted peasants had neither.” Contemporaries believed that this crisis
was at least partly the result of the diversion of land and labor away
from food crops and toward cotton. As the colonial government of India
observed in 1874, “The more the area’s food stocks is diminished in
favor of fibres, the greater the danger from any failure of the monsoon
becomes, andandandand the greater appears to be the necessity of some
security against the consequences of such failure.” Indeed, cotton
production for export typically produced a quagmire of poverty, debt,
and underdevelopment well into the twentieth century. As H. E. Neguib
Shakour Pasha, the director of the Gharbieh Land Company in Cairo,
reminded his audience during a speech to the Congress of the
International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners’ and Manufacturers’
Associations, “You have only to go to the villages and see the dwellings
our people live in, their very small interest in life, their hard work
from morning till evening without distractions would give you an idea as
to how the Egyptian peasant lives his gloomy and uninteresting
existence.”41</p>
<p>The causes of the uncertainties they faced often remained mysterious
to rural cultivators themselves. The cotton commissioner for Berar,
Harry Rivett-Carnac, reported in 1868 that “the great rise and then the
sudden fall in the price of cotton, and the constant fluctuations in the
market, by which the cultivator, in even the most remote of the
cotton-growing villages is affected, has led some of the less
intelligent to regard cotton not only with distrust, but with a certain
degree of awe.” Traveling into the “more distant parts of the
cotton-growing tracts of the Provinces,” he found people who were
mystified as to why the price of cotton changed rapidly, as they “find
some difficulty in realizing the present state of the trade, and the
fact that, by means of the Electric Telegraph, the throbbings of the
pulse of the Home markets communicate themselves instantly to Hingunghat
and other trade centres throughout the country.” These cotton growers
told Rivett-Carnac that they attributed such volatility to “luck,” “a
war,” the “kindness of a paternal Government,” or that the “the Queen
had given every one in England new clothes” on the occasion of the crown
prince’s wedding.42 These cultivators understood perfectly well that
remote events over which they had no control now determined the most
basic conditions of their existence.</p>
<p>This uncertainty could be life-threatening on a massive scale. In
1877 and again in the late 1890s, Berar, as well as northeastern Brazil,
witnessed the starvation of millions of cultivators as cotton prices
fell while food grain prices rose, putting food out of reach of many
cotton producers. Specializing in cotton could result in disaster, as in
the 1870s famine, which was not caused by a lack of food (indeed, food
grains continued to be exported from Berar), but by the inability of the
poorest agricultural laborers to buy urgently needed food grains. In
India alone, between 6 and 10 million people died in the famines of the
late 1870s. Observed one gazetteer, “Had Berar been an isolated tract
dependent on its own resources, it is possible that in the plain taluks
[British administrative units] there would have been no famine.” High
prices had made food unavailable to many peasants and agricultural
laborers, and during the 1900 famine, another 8.5 percent of the
population of Berar died, with the greatest numbers of deaths occurring
in districts most specialized in cotton production. Landless
agricultural workers and former weavers in particular suffered, “for not
only did they have to pay more for their food, but their wages are
reduced from the competition” of workers from other regions. The British
medical journal The Lancet estimated that famine death during the 1890s
totaled 19 million, with fatalities concentrated in the tracts of India
that had recently been recast to produce cotton for export. In the town
of Risod, a contemporary observed that people “died like flies.”43</p>
<p>Famine victims, probably 1899, India (illustration credit 11.12)</p>
<p>Experiencing a new kind of uncertainty thanks to world market
integration, and squeezed by moneylenders, cotton growers in India,
Brazil, Mexico, and the southern United States took a desperate and
dangerous step: They rebelled. In Egypt, agricultural workers led by
Ahmed al-Shaqi had revolted as early as 1865. In India, the Deccan Riots
of May and June 1875 targeted moneylenders and merchants—figures who
symbolized the recasting of the countryside. During the 1873–74 Quebra
Quilos revolt, Brazilian peasants, many of whom had just a few years
earlier switched to cotton production, destroyed land records and
refused to pay taxes they could no longer afford in the wake of the
global fall of cotton prices. In 1899, widespread grain riots occurred
again, often drawing in hundreds of people even in small villages. At
the same time, cotton farmers in the southern United States also
organized. They formed the Farmers Alliance and launched a political
movement, Populism, demanding that the state relieve them of some of the
economic pressures that had wreaked havoc in their lives, a movement
that reared its head again during the first decade of the twentieth
century when several hundred thousand farmers joined the Southern Cotton
Association and the National Farmers’ Union. Cotton populism spread as
far as Egypt, where Wady E. Medawar in 1900 formulated a program of
agrarian reform much like the one advanced by cotton farmers in the
United States, including cooperative societies, agricultural improvement
associations, mechanisms to provide cheap credit to farmers, and an
organization of rural cultivators that would interweave private and
public initiative. Around the same time, Mexican cotton workers in La
Laguna deployed “insubordination, theft, banditry” and other forms of
collective action to improve their situation. Food shortages led to
grain riots, brutally repressed by private armies backed by federal
troops. Strategies of resistance varied according to political regime,
ranging from creating cooperatives and running for political office in
Texas to murdering moneylenders in India.44</p>
<p>The rebellion of cotton cultivators at times had a significant impact
on national politics, as in the United States, where Populists
influenced the critical presidential election of 1896 and forced a
greater presence of the state in the cotton trade, but also in Mexico,
where they played an important role in the Mexican Revolution of the
1910s. But the integration of many areas of the world into the global
cotton empire also made “cotton nationalism” a major theme in
twentieth-century anticolonial struggles. Most prominently, Indian
nationalists invoked their country’s recast role in the global cotton
economy as one of the most damaging effects of colonialism, and
envisaged a postcolonial economy in which India would become again a
major cotton power.45</p>
<p>In future decades, these movements would revolutionize the empire of
cotton once again. But before this happened, the powerful new
combination of manufacturers and imperial statesmen who had emerged
after the American Civil War furthered the integration of the global
cotton-producing countryside in ever more parts of the world, including
Korea, Central Asia, and Africa. The tentacles of the empire of cotton
spread ever farther. And that imperial expansion, in often surprising
ways, would also come to influence the postcolonial and even
postcapitalist cotton industry, and with it twentieth-century global
capitalism.</p>
