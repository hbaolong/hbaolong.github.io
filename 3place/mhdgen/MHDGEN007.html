Command</h4>
<p>War capitalism at work: marrying slavery and industry in the American
Cotton Planter (1853) (illustration credit 5.1)</p>
<p>As British cotton manufacturing exploded in the 1780s, the pressures
on the global countryside to supply the crucial cotton increased at a
rapid clip. It was in the middle of that decade, in the winter of 1785,
that an American ship sailed into Liverpool harbor. There was nothing
remarkable about such a voyage; thousands of ships had brought the
bounties of North America to the shores of Britain before, filled to the
brim with tobacco, indigo, rice, furs, timber, and other commodities.
This ship, however, was different: In its hold, among other goods, were
a number of bags of cotton. Such freight seemed suspicious, and
Liverpool customs officials immediately impounded the cotton, arguing
that it had to be contraband West Indian produce. When the Liverpool
merchants Peel, Yates andandandand Co., who had imported the cotton,
petitioned the Board of Trade in London a few days later to permit
entry, they were told that it “cannot be imported from thence it not
being the Produce of the American States.”1</p>
<p>Indeed, to Europeans in the 1780s, cotton was the product of the West
Indies, of Brazil, of the Ottoman Empire, and of India—but not of North
America. It was all but unimaginable to Liverpool customs officials that
cotton could be imported from the United States. That the United States
would ever produce significant amounts of cotton seemed even more
preposterous. Though cotton was indigenous to the southern parts of the
new nation, and though many settlers in South Carolina and Georgia grew
small amounts of the fiber for domestic use, it had never been planted
primarily for commercial purposes nor exported in significant
quantities. As the customs officials undoubtedly knew, American planters
used their plentiful land and abundant slave labor to grow tobacco,
rice, indigo, and some sugar, but not cotton.2</p>
<p>The Revolution of Slavery: European Cotton Industrialization
Transforms the Countryside in the Americas, 1780–1865</p>
<p>This was, of course, a spectacular misjudgment. The United States was
superbly suited for cotton production. The climate and soil of a wide
swath of the American South met the conditions under which the cotton
plant thrived, with the right amount of rain, the right patterns of
rainfall, and the right number of days without frost. Perceptive
observers noticed that potential: In a bout of optimism, James Madison
had predicted as early as 1786, only a year after the unexpected
American cotton sailed into Liverpool harbor, that the United States
would turn into a major cotton-growing country, while George Washington
believed that “the increase of that new material (cotton)…must be of
almost infinite consequence to the prosperity of the United States.”
Philadelphian Tench Coxe, himself a substantial landowner in the South,
made a more subtle but nonetheless powerful case for America’s
cotton-growing potential. In 1794, observing the rapid expansion of
cotton manufacturers in Great Britain and rising prices of West Indian
cotton in the wake of the uprising in Saint-Domingue, he urged that
“this article must be worth the attention of the southern planters.” He
was encouraged by British industrialists such as Stockport cotton
manufacturer John Milne, who embarked in the late 1780s on the long
journey across the Atlantic to persuade North Americans to grow
cotton.3</p>
<p>As predicted by these self-interested observers, cotton production
would soon dominate vast swaths of the United States. Indeed, the crop
would become so intrinsic to American enterprise that the earlier
reality—the dominance of cotton from the Ottoman Empire, the West
Indies, and Brazil—has largely been lost. It turned out that Peel, Yates
andandandand Co. had anticipated one of the nineteenth century’s most
consequential dynamics.4</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of cotton in the United States was partly
possible because planters used the experience that their colonial
ancestors had accumulated in the cultivation of the white gold. As early
as 1607, settlers in Jamestown had grown cotton; by the end of the
seventeenth century, travelers had introduced cottonseeds from Cyprus
and Izmir to American soil. Throughout the eighteenth century, farmers
continued to gather knowledge about cotton cultivation from the West
Indies and the Mediterranean and planted cottonseeds from these regions,
primarily for domestic consumption. During the upheavals of the American
struggle for independence, planters grew larger quantities to substitute
for the now absent imports of cloth from Britain, and to keep at work
slaves whose usual crops—namely tobacco and rice—suddenly lacked a
market. South Carolinian planter Ralph Izard, for example, eagerly gave
orders in 1775 “for a considerable quantity of cotton to be planted for
clothing my negroes.”5</p>
<p>Quick expansion was made easier because substantial similarities
existed between the growing of tobacco and cotton; knowledge accumulated
in the cultivation of the former could be used to grow the latter.
Moreover, some of the infrastructure that had facilitated the moving of
tobacco to world markets could be rededicated to cotton. And during the
revolutionary upheavals of the eighteenth century, planters and slaves
moved back and forth between the West Indies and North America, bringing
with them further knowledge about cotton planting. In 1788, for example,
the owners of a slave from Saint Croix advertised him for sale in the
United States as “well acquainted with the culture of cotton.” The
slave-cotton paradigm invented in the West Indies now spread to the
North American mainland.6</p>
<p>In 1786, American planters also began to notice the rising prices for
cotton engendered by the rapid expansion of mechanized cotton textile
production in the United Kingdom. That year, planters grew the first
long-staple Sea Island cotton, named after the location of their
plantations on islands just off the coast of Georgia, with seeds they
had brought from the Bahamas. Unlike the local cottons, this cotton had
a long, silky fiber, which made it exceedingly well suited for finer
yarns and cloths, much in demand by Manchester manufacturers. Though
accounts vary, it is possible that a Frank Levett was the first to take
this momentous step. Levett, a native of the great cotton mart of Izmir,
had left the rebelling American colonies for the Bahamas, but eventually
returned to Georgia, retook possession of his land, and then began a
major effort at cotton growing. Others followed his model and the
planting of Sea Island cotton spread up and down the coast of South
Carolina and Georgia. Exports from South Carolina, for example,
ballooned from less than 10,000 pounds in 1790 to 6.4 million pounds in
1800.7</p>
<p>Production received a decisive boost in 1791 when rebellion
eliminated cotton rival Saint-Domingue, Europe’s most important source
of cotton, sending prices upward and scattering the entire class of
French cotton planters: Some went to Cuba and other islands; many came
to the United States. Jean Montalet, for example, one of many of
Saint-Domingue’s former cotton planters, sought refuge on the mainland,
and upon his arrival in South Carolina converted a rice plantation to
the growing of cotton. Revolution thus in one stroke both brought needed
growing expertise to the United States and increased the financial
incentive for American planters to grow cotton. But the slaves’ uprising
on the plantations of Saint-Domingue also ingrained a sense among
manufacturers, planters, and statesmen of the inherent instability of
the system of cotton slavery and land expropriations that they were
about to expand in North America.8</p>
<p>While Sea Island cotton production expanded rapidly, it soon reached
its limit, as the variety failed at any substantial distance from the
coast. Farther inland, a different strain of cotton thrived, so-called
upland cotton, shorter in staple length, with the fiber tightly attached
to its seed. It was difficult to remove the seeds with the help of
existing gins, but with demand increasing and prices high, planters had
their slaves work it up in a slow and tedious process by roller gins
modeled after Indian churkas.9</p>
<p>Yet even with slave labor, the result was not adequate. Planters
yearned for a device that would more quickly separate seed from fiber.
In 1793, Eli Whitney, only a few months after arriving in Savannah from
his college days at Yale, built the first working model of a new kind of
cotton gin that was able to rapidly remove the seeds of upland cotton.
Overnight, his machine increased ginning productivity by a factor of
fifty. News of the innovation spread quickly; farmers everywhere built
copies of the gin. Like the jenny and the water frame, Eli’s gin
overcame yet another bottleneck in the production of cotton textiles. As
a result, in what can only be described as a “cotton rush,” land on
which cotton grew allegedly trebled in price after the invention of the
gin, and “the annual income of those who plant it is double to what it
was before the introduction of cotton.”10</p>
<p>Armed with this new technology, cotton production spread rapidly
after 1793 into the interior of South Carolina and Georgia. As a result,
in 1795 significant amounts of U.S. cotton arrived in Liverpool for the
first time; none, as best we know, was seized by customs. As settlers
streamed into the region, many of them migrants from the upper South,
the countryside was turned upside down—from a thinly inhabited region of
native people and farmers who focused on subsistence crops and tobacco
to one in the thrall of cotton.11</p>
<p>To enable such expanded production, planters brought with them
thousands of slaves. In the 1790s, the slave population of the state of
Georgia nearly doubled, to sixty thousand. In South Carolina, the number
of slaves in the upcountry cotton growing districts grew from twenty-one
thousand in 1790 to seventy thousand twenty years later, including
fifteen thousand slaves newly brought from Africa. As cotton plantations
spread, the proportion of slaves in four typical South Carolina
upcountry counties increased from 18.4 percent in 1790 to 39.5 percent
in 1820 and to 61.1 percent in 1860. All the way to the Civil War,
cotton and slavery would expand in lockstep, as Great Britain and the
United States had become the twin hubs of the emerging empire of
cotton.12</p>
<p>The only substantial problem was the land, as the same patch could
not be used for more than a few years without either planting legumes on
it or applying expensive guano to it. As one Putnam County, Georgia,
planter lamented, “We appear to have but one rule—that is, to make as
much cotton as we can, and wear out as much land as we can…lands that
once produced one thousand pounds of cotton to the acre, will not now
bring more than four hundred pounds.” Yet even soil exhaustion did not
slow the cotton barons; they simply moved farther west and farther
south. Newly emptied lands, portable slave labor, and the new ginning
technology allowed cotton to be easily transferred to new territories.
After 1815, cotton planters moved westward into the rich lands of upland
South Carolina and Georgia. Their migration to Alabama and Louisiana,
and eventually to Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas, was choreographed to
the movement of cotton prices. While the price of cotton gradually
declined over the first half of the nineteenth century, sharp price
upswings—such as in the first half of the 1810s, between 1832 and 1837,
and again after the mid-1840s—produced expansionist bursts. In 1811,
one-sixteenth of all cotton grown in the United States came from states
and territories west of South Carolina and Georgia, by 1820 that share
had reached one-third, and in 1860 three-fourths. New cotton fields
sprouted in the sediment-rich lands along the banks of the Mississippi,
the upcountry of Alabama, and the black prairie of Arkansas. So rapid
was this move westward that by the end of the 1830s, Mississippi already
produced more cotton than any other southern state.13</p>
<p>Moving westward: Production of cotton by U.S. states, 1790–1860
(illustration credit 5.2)</p>
<p>The entry of the United States into the empire of cotton was so
forceful that cotton cultivation in the American South quickly began to
reshape the global cotton market. In 1790, three years before Whitney’s
invention, the United States had produced 1.5 million pounds of cotton;
in 1800 that number grew to 36.5 million pounds, and in 1820 to 167.5
million pounds. Exports to Great Britain increased by a factor of
ninety-three between 1791 and 1800, only to multiply another seven times
by 1820. By 1802 the United States was already the single most important
supplier of cotton to the British market, and by 1857 it would produce
about as much cotton as China. American upland cotton, which Whitney’s
gin worked up so efficiently, was exceedingly well suited to the
requirements of British manufacturers: While the gin damaged the fiber,
the cotton remained suitable for the production of cheaper, coarser
yarns and fabrics in high demand among the lower classes in Europe and
elsewhere. But for American supplies, the miracle of the mass production
of yarn and cloth, and the ability of new consumers to buy these cheap
goods, would have foundered on old realities of the traditional cotton
market. The much-vaunted consumer revolution in textiles stemmed from a
dramatic transformation in the structure of plantation slavery.14</p>
<p>The rise of the United States to dominance in world cotton markets
was a radical reversal of fortunes. But why did it happen? As Tench Coxe
pointed out in 1817, climate and soil alone did not explain the
cotton-producing potential of the United States, because, as he put it,
the white gold “can be cultivated in an immense district of the
productive zones of the earth.”15 What distinguished the United States
from virtually every other cotton-growing area in the world was
planters’ command of nearly unlimited supplies of land, labor, and
capital, and their unparalleled political power. In the Ottoman Empire
and India, as we know, powerful indigenous rulers controlled the land,
and deeply entrenched social groups struggled over its use. In the West
Indies and Brazil, sugar planters competed for land, labor, and power.
The United States, and its plentiful land, faced no such
encumbrances.</p>
<p>Ever since the first European settlers stepped off their boats, they
had pushed inland. The land’s native inhabitants had to reckon with what
these boats brought—first germs, later steel. In the late eighteenth
century, Native Americans still controlled substantial territories only
a few hundred miles inland from the coastal provinces, yet they were
unable to stop the white settlers’ steady encroachment. The settlers
eventually won a bloody and centuries-long war, succeeding in turning
the land of Native Americans into land that was legally “empty.” This
was a land whose social structures had been catastrophically weakened or
eliminated, a land without most of its people and thus without the
entanglements of history. In terms of unencumbered land, the South had
no rival in the cotton-growing world.</p>
<p>With the support of southern politicians, the federal government
aggressively secured new territories by acquiring land from foreign
powers and from forced cessions by Native Americans. In 1803, the
Louisiana Purchase nearly doubled the territory of the United States, in
1819 the United States acquired Florida from Spain, and in 1845 it
annexed Texas. All of these acquisitions contained lands superbly suited
to cotton agriculture. Indeed, by 1850, 67 percent of U.S. cotton grew
on land that had not been part of the United States half a century
earlier. The fledging U.S. government had inaugurated the
military-cotton complex.</p>
<p>Cotton production in the United States, in millions of pounds,
1790–1859 (illustration credit 5.3)</p>
<p>That territorial expansion, the “great land rush” as geographer John
C. Weaver has called this moment more broadly, was tightly linked to the
territorial ambitions of planting, manufacturing, and finance
capitalists. Cotton planters constantly pushed the boundaries, seeking
fresh lands to grow cotton, often moving ahead of the federal
government. The frontier space they created was characterized by the
near absence of government oversight: The state’s monopoly on violence
was still a distant dream.16 But these frontier planters at the rough
edges of the empire of cotton had well-dressed and well-spoken company.
British banker Thomas Baring, one of the world’s greatest cotton
merchants, for example, was instrumental in the expansion of the empire
of cotton when he financed the purchase of the Louisiana lands,
negotiating and selling the bonds that sealed the deal with the French
government. Before doing so, Baring asked for approval from the British
government for such a vast expansion of the United States, through Henry
Addington, the British prime minister. So important was the meeting to
Baring that he scribbled in small letters in his notepad:</p>
<p>Sunday, June 19: saw Mr. Addington at Richmond Park, communicated to
him the particulars of the business, andandandand answered every
question. I asked distinctly if he approved the treaty andandandand our
conduct. He said that he thought it would have been wise for this
country to pay a million sterling for the transfer of Louisiana from
France to America, andandandand that he saw nothing in our conduct but
to approve. He appears to consider Louisiana in the hands of America as
an additional means for the vent of our manufacturers andandandand
Co. in preference to France, besides other motives which we did not
discuss, directly of a political nature.17</p>
<p>The thrust south and west was far more than just planters searching
for fresh land. Expansion served many interests: of a rapidly
consolidating state, of western farmers hoping for an outlet to the sea,
of manufacturers’ need for raw materials, and of British economic and
political desires. As industrial capitalism expanded, the zone of war
capitalism continued to push outward.</p>
<p>But international treaties alone were not sufficient. To make the
land useful to planters, this newly consolidated territory needed to be
removed from the control of its native inhabitants. Already in the early
1800s, the Creeks, under duress, had given up claims to land in Georgia
that was then converted into cotton farms. A decade later the Creeks
suffered further defeats and were forced to sign the Treaty of Fort
Jackson, ceding 23 million acres of land in what is today Alabama and
Georgia. In the years after 1814, the federal government signed further
treaties with the Creeks, Chickasaw, and Choctaws, gaining control over
millions of acres of land in the South, including Andrew Jackson’s 1818
treaty with the Chickasaw nation that opened western Tennessee to cotton
cultivation and the 1819 treaty with the Choctaw nation that gave 5
million acres of land in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta to the United
States in exchange for vastly inferior lands in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Alabama congressman David Hubbard invited the New York and Mississippi
Land Company in 1835 to purchase lands from which the Chickasaw had been
expelled, which were then turned into cotton lands: “If on my return I
should meet with any thing from you in the shape of a distinct
proposition to take hold of the public lands in the Chickasaw Nation, I
shall then be ready to act immediately, according to the magnitude of
your scheme andandandand shall shape my course so as to meet fully the
views of your capitalists in my future operation.” The company bought
approximately twenty-five thousand acres. In 1838, federal troops began
removing the Cherokee nation from their ancestral homeland in Georgia,
which was to be turned into cotton plantations. Farther south, in
Florida, extraordinarily rich cotton lands were expropriated from the
Seminoles between 1835 and 1842, the longest war in U.S. history until
the Vietnam War. It is no wonder that Mississippi planters, argues one
historian, had “an obsessive concern with well-organized and trained
militias, adequate weaponry, and a responsive federal army.”18</p>
<p>Native Americans understood the underlying foundations of the
expanding military-cotton complex: Upon removal in 1836, the chief of
the Cherokees, John Ross, in a letter to Congress decried that “our
property may be plundered before our eyes; violence may be committed on
our persons; even our lives may be taken away, and there is none to
regard our complaints. We are denationalized; we are disenfranchised. We
are deprived of membership in the human family!” The coercion and
violence required to mobilize slave labor was matched only by the
demands of an expansionist war against indigenous people. Nothing of
this kind had even been dreamed of in Anatolia or Gujarat.19</p>
<p>If the project of continental consolidation provided access to new
cotton lands, it also secured major rivers needed to carry the cotton.
America’s remarkably cheap transportation costs were not preordained,
but the direct result of the expansion of its national territory. Most
significant here was the Mississippi, whose surge of cotton freight
turned New Orleans, at the river’s mouth, into the key American cotton
port. But other rivers—the Red River in Louisiana and the Tombigbee and
Mobile in Alabama—mattered as well. The first steamboats appeared on the
Mississippi in 1817, reducing transport costs, and by the 1830s,
railroads connected the new hinterland to river and seaports. The most
modern technologies thus made the most brutal exploitation of human
labor possible.20</p>
<p>The insatiable demand of cotton planters dominated the politics of
the new nation, not just because of their reliance on the state to
secure and empty new land, but also because of their need for coerced
labor. Planters in the United States, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed access
to large supplies of cheap labor—what the American Cotton Planter would
call “the cheapest and most available labor in the world.” Cotton, until
the advent of mechanized harvesting during the 1940s, was a
labor-intensive crop. Even more than the hours required to spin and
weave, the shortage of workers to harvest was the most constraining
factor in its production. “The true limitation upon the production of
cotton,” argued the southern journal De Bow’s Review, “is labor.” In the
complex agricultural structures of Mughal India and the Ottoman Empire,
rural cultivators had to first secure subsistence crops for their own
use, thus limiting what they harvested for the market. Indeed, as we
have seen, the shortage of labor had been one of the principal
constraints on production in western Anatolia and had frustrated efforts
to create cotton plantations in India. In Brazil, where slave labor was
available, cotton competed poorly with the even greater labor
requirements of sugar plantations. And with the British abolition of the
slave trade in 1807 it became difficult for West Indian planters to
recruit labor.21</p>
<p>In the United States, however, nearly any shortage could be fixed,
with the right amount of money. The slave markets in New Orleans and
elsewhere boomed as cotton did. And as significant, hundreds of
thousands of slaves were available to grow cotton because tobacco
production in the states of the upper South became less profitable after
the American Revolution, encouraging slave owners there to sell their
human property. As one British observer remarked perceptively in 1811,
“The cultivation of tobacco in Virginia and Maryland, has been less of
late an object of attention; and the gangs of negroes formerly engaged
in it, have been sent into the southern states, where the American
cotton planter, thus reinforced, is enabled to commence his operations
with increasing vigour.” Indeed, by 1830 fully 1 million people (or one
in thirteen Americans) grew cotton in the United States—most of them
slaves.22</p>
<p>The expansion of cotton production, as a result, reinvigorated
slavery and led to an enormous shift of slave labor from the upper to
the lower South. In the thirty years after the invention of the gin
alone (between 1790 and 1820), a quarter million slaves were forcefully
relocated, while between 1783 and the closing of the international slave
trade in 1808, traders imported an estimated 170,000 slaves into the
United States—or one-third of all slaves imported into North America
since 1619. Altogether, the internal slave trade moved up to a million
slaves forcefully to the Deep South, most to grow cotton.23</p>
<p>To be sure, not all cotton in the United States was grown by slaves
on large plantations. Small farmers in the southern upcountry produced
cotton as well, and they did so because it provided ready cash and its
cultivation, unlike the growing of sugar or rice, did not require
significant capital investments. Yet despite their efforts, in aggregate
they produced only a small share of the total crop. As we have seen the
world over, small farmers focused on securing subsistence crops before
growing marketable commodities. Indeed, 85 percent of all cotton picked
in the South in 1860 was grown on units larger than a hundred acres; the
planters who owned those farms owned 91.2 percent of all slaves. The
larger the farm, the better the planter was able to take advantage of
the economies of scale inherent in slave-based cotton production. Larger
farms could afford the gins to remove seeds and presses to compress
loose cotton into tightly pressed bales to lower shipping costs, they
could engage in agricultural experiments to wrest more nutrients from
cleared soil, and they could buy more slaves to avoid any labor
constraints.24 Cotton demanded quite literally a hunt for labor and a
perpetual struggle for its control. Slave traders, slave pens, slave
auctions, and the attendant physical and psychological violence of
holding millions in bondage were of central importance to the expansion
of cotton production in the United States and of the Industrial
Revolution in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Better than anyone else, slaves understood the violent foundation of
cotton’s success. If given an opportunity, they testified in vivid
detail to its brutality. John Brown, a fugitive slave, remembered in
1854 how he was “flogged…with the cow-hide,” and how overseers “hunt[ed]
‘stray niggers.’ ” “When the price [of cotton] rises in the English
market,” he remembered, “the poor slaves immediately feel the effects,
for they are harder driven, and the whip is kept more constantly going.”
Henry Bibb, another slave, remembered the fearful violence: “At the
sound of the overseer’s horn, all the slaves came forward and witnessed
my punishment. My clothing was stripped off and I was compelled to lie
down on the ground with my face to the earth. Four stakes were driven in
the ground, to which my hands and feet were tied. Then the overseer
stood over me with the lash.”25</p>
<p>The expansion of cotton manufacturing in Great Britain depended on
violence across the Atlantic. Cotton, emptied lands, and slavery indeed
became so closely connected to one another that Liverpool cotton
merchant William Rathbone VI, on a trip to the United States in 1849,
reported to his father that “negroes andandandand everything here
fluctuates with Cotton.” So crucial was slave labor that the Liverpool
Chronicle and European Times warned that if slaves ever should be
emancipated, cotton cloth prices might double or triple, with
devastating consequences for Britain. While brutal coercion weighed like
a nightmare upon millions of American slaves, the potential end of such
violence was a nightmare to those who gathered the fabulous profits of
the empire of cotton.26</p>

<p>To make such a nightmare less likely, planters in the United States
also drew on the third advantage that turned them into the world’s
leading cotton growers: political power. Southern slaveholders had
enshrined the basis of their power into the Constitution with its
three-fifths clause. A whole series of slaveholding presidents, Supreme
Court judges, and strong representation in both houses of Congress
guaranteed seemingly never-ending political support for the institution
of slavery. Such power on the national level was enabled and also
supplemented by the absence of competing elites in the slaveholding
states themselves, and the enormous power slaveholders enjoyed over
state governments. These state governments, in the end, also allowed
North American cotton planters to amplify their good fortune of
navigable rivers near their plantations by building railroads deeper and
deeper into the hinterland. In contrast, Brazilian cotton farmers,
competing with the interests of the country’s powerful sugar growers,
were unable to command infrastructure improvements to facilitate cotton
exports. Transporting cotton over long distances on mules or horses
remained expensive; transporting cotton from the São Francisco River
region to the port of Salvador, for example, almost doubled the price of
cotton. In India, transportation infrastructure remained similarly poor
(it was said that transporting cotton to the port added about 50 percent
to its cost in India, but as little as 3 percent in the United States),
as cotton merchants and growers in India lacked the capital and power to
effect its rapid improvement. The political influence of slaveholders in
the American Republic was also decisive because it allowed them to
expand the institution of slavery into the newly acquired territories of
the South and Southwest, while successfully committing the federal
government to a policy of expropriating Native Americans.27</p>
<p>In a roundabout way, American independence had turned out to be a
blessing for the European, especially the British, cotton industry.
Bowing to a century of abolitionist persuasion, Britain in 1834 outlawed
slavery within its empire. Some American revolutionaries envisioned a
similar extinction of slavery as their own nation evolved, only to see
the institution become the engine of the most important cotton-growing
region of the world. And independence removed restraints from
expropriating Native Americans as well, with the relationship between
white settlers and North American Indians now removed from the complex
negotiations of European politics. The disjunction of political from
economic spaces in fact proved to be crucial for the world’s most
dynamic industry—with cotton-growing slave owners dominating regional
governments and exerting significant influence on the national
government, their interests and the policies of the state could be
aligned to a stunning degree, an impossibility for slaveholders within
the British Empire.</p>
<p>A cotton carrier, Brazil, 1816 (illustration credit 5.5)</p>
<p>How these factors came together can be seen, for example, in the
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta. Here, in an area of approximately seven
thousand square miles, the mighty Mississippi had unloaded its rich
sediments for millennia, becoming the seedbed of the world’s most
productive cotton land. In 1859, as many as sixty thousand Delta slaves
produced a staggering 66 million pounds of cotton, nearly ten times as
much as was exported from Saint-Domingue to France during the height of
its production in the early 1790s.28</p>
<p>For the Delta to become the chief grower of the industrial world’s
most important commodity—a kind of Saudi Arabia of the early nineteenth
century—its land had to be taken from its original inhabitants and
labor, capital, knowledge, and state power had to be mobilized. Between
1820 and 1832 a series of treaties backed by skirmishes and armed
confrontations transferred much of the land from the Choctaws—its native
inhabitants—to white settlers. Using wagons, rafts, and flatboats,
hopeful cotton planters brought slaves from elsewhere in the South to
clear that land of its “jungle-like” vegetation, and later to hoe the
soil, sow seeds, prune the young plants, and then harvest the cotton.
The news that the Delta was “the most certain cotton planting area in
the world” spread through the South; planters who were able to draw on
sufficient capital (mostly in the form of labor) and expertise moved in.
The plantations they built became substantial businesses: By 1840,
Washington County, in the heart of the Delta, counted more than ten
slaves for every white inhabitant. By 1850, each and every white family
in the county held on average more than eighty slaves. The largest Delta
planter, Stephen Duncan, owned 1,036 slaves and the value of his
property by the late 1850s was estimated at .3 million. While not
typical cotton farms, plantations in the Delta were highly capitalized
businesses, indeed among the very largest in North America, and the
investments necessary would have been beyond the reach of nearly every
northern industrialist. Wealth, as viewed from the front porches of the
lavish and elegantly furnished mansions in the Delta, appeared to flow
out of the soil, the result of a strange alchemy that combined emptied
lands, slave labor, and, as we will see, the never-ending flow of
European capital.29</p>
<p>The growing domination of global cotton markets by planters in fact
fed upon itself. As cotton cultivation expanded in the southern United
States and as British and eventually continental European consumers
became more and more dependent on that supply, institutional links
between the South and Europe deepened. European import merchants sent
agents to Charleston, Memphis, and New Orleans. They corresponded with
business partners across the Atlantic on a regular basis. These
merchants built a dense network of shipping connections and integrated
the trade in cotton with their other businesses. People engaged in the
cotton trade crossed the North Atlantic frequently, forging close
business connections, friendships, and even marriages. Such networks, in
turn, made transatlantic trade more secure and more predictable, thus
lowering costs and giving the United States another decisive advantage
over its potential competitors, such as India or Brazil.</p>
<p>At the core of all of these networks was the flow of cotton from the
United States to Europe and of capital in the opposite direction. This
capital more often than not was secured by mortgages on slaves, giving
the owners of these mortgages the right to a particular slave should the
debtor default. As historian Bonnie Martin has shown, in Louisiana 88
percent of loans secured by mortgages used slaves as (partial)
collateral; in South Carolina it was 82 percent. In total, she estimates
that hundreds of millions of dollars of capital was secured by property
in humans. Slavery thus allowed not just for the rapid allocation of
labor, but also for a swift allocation of capital.30</p>
<p>With enormous riches gained from expropriated land and labor,
planters invested in agricultural improvements, another illustration of
how success begot further success. They experimented, for example, with
various cotton hybrids drawing on Indian, Ottoman, Central American,
West Indian, and other seeds, creating cotton strains adapted to
particular local climates and soils, eventually crafting hundreds upon
hundreds of different kinds of cotton. Most significantly, in 1806 a
Natchez planter, Walter Burling, brought cottonseeds from Mexico, which
had larger bolls that could be more easily picked and, according to
experts, “possessed better fiber quality, especially fiber length, and
was resistant to ‘rot.’ ” This type of cotton had been cultivated by
Native Americans in the central Mexican highlands for centuries, and
once brought into the United States it was appropriated by American
planters, becoming the “basic germplasm for all subsequent upland cotton
cultivars in the United States and around the world.” The new cotton
could be picked three to four times as fast as the then common Georgia
Green Seed cotton. The cruel irony was that Amerindians’ ability to
develop a strain of cotton well suited for the American environment gave
considerable impetus to the expropriation of their lands, and made slave
labor on those lands much more productive.31</p>
<p>Such innovations in labor control and agriculture were increasingly
institutionalized by the construction of dense but distinctly regional
networks for the dispersal of knowledge. Books, agricultural institutes,
journals such as De Bow’s Review and the American Cotton Planter, along
with regional agricultural conventions, all spread information about how
to select seeds, how to organize a labor force, how to read the market,
how to hoe and plant, and where to invest—in short, how to perfect a
“Practical Plantation Economy.”32</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution in Europe also actively influenced the
evolution of slavery in the American South. Gang labor, by no means new
but never so prevalent as on cotton plantations, exemplified the new
rhythm of industrial labor, or what one author has called “military
agriculture.” The systematic mobilization of slave women and children on
cotton farms further expanded their output. As a result, cotton
production in the United States increased much faster than the number of
slaves employed on farms. Some of that increase was related to the
embrace of different cotton plants, but there was also a systematic
intensification of exploitation. Plantation slavery in the
nineteenth-century United States allowed for an organization of labor
unlike what was possible in the world’s newly emerging industrial
heartland. Because plantations were frequently larger than factories and
required more substantial capital investments, and because aside from
the spike in innovation around the invention of Eli Whitney’s gin in the
1790s technological progress in cotton agriculture was limited,
productivity gains on plantations could only result from a
reorganization of labor. Slave owners secured these productivity gains
by taking almost total control of the work process—a direct result of
the violent domination of their workers. Nothing of that sort was
possible in the world’s emerging textile mills, where workers succeeded
in maintaining some of the rhythms of the farms, small workshops, and
craft guilds from whence they came.33 The all-encompassing control of
workers—a core characteristic of capitalism—experienced its first great
success on the cotton plantations of the American South.</p>
<p>Because planters dominated labor in ways radically different from
English merchants’ connection to agricultural cultivators in India, or
Ottoman landowners in Anatolia, they could drive their slaves ever
harder, as they came up with increasingly brutal methods of disciplining
their workforce. Indeed, torture, according to historian Edward Baptist,
was at the root of the ability of American planters to produce ever more
cotton. Innovative ways of labor accounting further helped planters
squeeze more labor out of their workers. As management scholar Rob Cooke
has argued, “There is no real question nowadays…that it [the plantation]
was a site of early development of industrial discipline.” And with
rising productivity on cotton plantations, prices fell, allowing British
manufacturers to become even more competitive in the markets of the
world, a move that, among many other things, would eventually undermine
manufacturing in India and elsewhere and make the later integration of
that countryside into the global cotton empire much easier.34</p>
<p>The rhythm of industrial production also entered the plantation in
other ways. Since the expansion of cotton agriculture depended on the
advance of credit, sometimes secured by mortgages on slaves, most of
which derived from the London money market, its patterns now followed
the competitive logic of markets rather than the whimsy of personal
aspiration and regional circumstance—capital moved to wherever cotton
could be produced in the greatest quantities and at the cheapest cost.
To the great lament of southern planters, the factor—a merchant who
would sell a planter’s cotton, supply him with goods, and provide
credit—and with him the London money market, was a decisive source of
their wealth and power. But the London money market and the Lancashire
manufacturers depended just as much on the local experts in the violent
expropriation of land and labor. The old paternalism of East Coast
planters, shielded partially by the mercantilist logic of mutually
beneficial and protected exchange between motherland and colony of the
greater British imperial economy, had given way to a freer, more
competitive, and fluid social order mediated by merchant capital. The
voracious appetite for accumulation sped the “social metabolism” of
cotton production. The logic of war capitalism in fact now emanated from
its industrial (wage labor) center in Lancashire. While in the
eighteenth century, slavery had enabled industrial takeoff, it now
became integral to its continued expansion.35</p>
<p>Rationalizing labor control with the whip: Thomas Affleck markets his
cotton plantation account book (illustration credit 5.6)</p>
<p>The peculiar combination of expropriated lands, slave labor, and the
domination of a state that gave enormous latitude to slave owners over
their labor was fabulously profitable for those positioned to embrace
it: As early as 1807 a Mississippi cotton plantation was said to return
22.5 percent annually on its investment. Many thousands of planters
moved along with the cotton frontier to capture some of these profits.
Cotton’s profitability is also revealed by the dramatic increase in the
price of slaves: A young adult male slave in New Orleans cost about 00
in 1800, but as much as ,800 before the Civil War. Consider the story of
a young Georgia planter, Joseph Clay. He had bought Royal Vale, a rice
plantation in Chatham County, Georgia, in 1782. He grew rice until 1793.
That year, hearing of Whitney’s gin, he obtained a loan of 2,000, used
that money to buy additional slaves, had them convert some of the land
to cotton fields, and installed a number of gins. So profitable was the
undertaking that a mere seven years later he was able to repay his debt,
lavishly redecorate his mansion, and buy additional slaves and gins.
When Clay died in 1804, his estate was valued at 76,000.36</p>
<p>The wages of slavery: indexed cotton prices, American middling, at
Liverpool (1860 = 100) (illustration credit 5.7)</p>
<p>In similar ways, South Carolina indigo planter Peter Gaillard saw his
fortunes revive thanks to the cotton boom. By 1790 Gaillard’s indigo
business had all but collapsed owing to the disappearance of British
markets, and he had resorted to growing food for his family on his
plantation. As a friend of his reported, “The disastrous ten years which
preceded the introduction of cotton as a market crop involved him, as it
did others, in debt and distress.” In 1796, however, he began growing
cotton—“a brilliant prospect now opened to the eyes of the desponding
planters”—a crop so profitable that four years later he had paid back
all his debts and in 1803 constructed a new mansion on his property.
Coerced labor meant rapid profits; by 1824 he owned five hundred slaves.
South Carolinian Wade Hampton I followed suit. His first cotton crop in
1799 allegedly netted a profit of 5,000, and by 1810 he drew 50,000
annually from his cotton plantations. His son would eventually use some
of the profits to relocate to the Mississippi Delta in the mid-1840s.
Prospective cotton planter Daniel W. Jordan, surveying the opportunities
for cotton growing in Mississippi, saw “a field to operate in and here I
can make money…. I can in this State make as much money in 5 years as a
man should want.”37</p>
<p>Fortified by their wealth, confident of their slave-aided ability to
squeeze ever more cotton from the land, American cotton planters came to
dominate British markets by 1802. By the 1830s they had also captured
newly emerging continental European and North American markets. As a
result, earlier producers, especially those in the West Indies,
suffered: “The Competition, if left perfectly free and unrestricted,
cannot be long maintained by the Colonialists [in the West Indies]; as
the same price that yields a liberal profit to the American Cultivator,
is not adequate to defray the charges of cultivation to the colonist,”
observed an anonymous letter writer in 1812. Other potential
competitors, such as farmers in India, planted cotton on just as much
land as North Americans as late as 1850, but their presence on world
markets remained marginal.38</p>
<p>As this cotton boom violently transformed huge swaths of the North
American countryside, it catapulted the United States to a pivotal role
in the empire of cotton. In 1791, capital invested in cotton production
in Brazil, as estimated by the U.S. Treasury, was still more than ten
times greater than in the United States. By 1801, only ten years later,
60 percent more capital was invested in the cotton industry of the
United States than that of Brazil. Cotton, even more so than in the
Caribbean and Brazil, infused land and slaves alike with unprecedented
value, and promised slaveholders spectacular opportunities for profits
and power. Already by 1820, cotton constituted 32 percent of all U.S.
exports, compared to a minuscule 2.2 percent in 1796. Indeed, more than
half of all American exports between 1815 and 1860 consisted of cotton.
Cotton so dominated the U.S. economy that cotton production statistics
“became an increasingly vital unit in assessing the American economy.”
It was on the back of cotton, and thus on the backs of slaves, that the
U.S. economy ascended in the world.39</p>
<p>So important had American cotton become to the Western world that a
German economist remarked that “a disappearance of the American North or
West would be of less significance to the world, than the elimination of
the South.” Southern planters, convinced of their central role in the
global economy, gleefully announced that they held “THE LEVER THAT
WIELDS THE DESTINY OF MODERN CIVILIZATION.” As the American Cotton
Planter put it in 1853, “The slave-labor of the United States, has
hitherto conferred and is still conferring inappreciable blessings on
mankind. If these blessings continue, slave-labor must also continue,
for it is idle to talk of producing Cotton for the world’s supply with
free labor. It has never yet been successfully grown by voluntary
labor.”40</p>
<p>American cotton farmers had succeeded in turning themselves into the
world’s most important growers of the industrial age’s most important
commodity. Their “gigantic plantations,” observed a British merchant in
Tellicherry, India, “now supply the materials for clothing half the
civilized world.” And with slave-grown cotton pouring in from the United
States, the cost of finished cotton declined, making clothes and sheets
affordable for a rapidly expanding market. As the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce put it in 1825, “We are firmly persuaded that it is in great
measure owing to the very low price of the raw material that this
manufacture has been of late years so rapidly increased.” In 1845, South
Carolina’s cotton planters agreed: “Nearly one half of the population of
Europe…have not now the comfort of a cotton shirt,” constituting an
“untried market…opening more and more to our enterprize.” The world of
cotton, which before 1780 had consisted mostly of scattered regional and
local networks, now increasingly became one global matrix with a single
nexus. And slavery in the United States was its foundation.41</p>
<p>War capitalism recasts the global cotton industry: world’s cotton
crop, 1791–1831 (rough estimate) (illustration credit 5.8)</p>
<p>Despite its undeniable success, the dependence of Europe’s cotton
manufacturers on one country and on one peculiar system of labor
disquieted some consumers of raw cotton. As early as the 1810s, British
manufacturers in particular began to worry that they had become too
dependent on a single supplier for their valuable raw materials. In
1838, the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures shrilly warned of
the “alarming fact that Britain is almost entirely dependant on foreign
supply for this article, which is now scarcely less necessary than
bread.” Six years later, “A Cotton Spinner” looked with “great
apprehension” at the dependence of the United Kingdom on cotton supplies
from the United States. This relationship had become important just as
the North American colonies embarked upon their slow and painful move
away from the empire, showing that connections across the Atlantic could
be severed by political and military action. Cotton manufacturers
understood that their prosperity was entirely dependent on the labor of
slaves and they “dreaded the severity of the revulsion which must
sooner, or later arrive.” By 1850, one British observer estimated that
3.5 million people in the United Kingdom were employed by the country’s
cotton industry—all subject to the whims of American planters and their
tenuous hold on their nation’s politics.42</p>
<p>Cotton imports into Great Britain, annual averages, in percent, by
country of origin (illustration credit 5.9)</p>
<p>Cotton manufacturers’ concerns about dependence on U.S. cotton
focused on three issues. First, they feared that the United States would
siphon off ever-increasing amounts of its own cotton in its own
factories, which had begun to emerge in significant numbers in the
1810s, making less cotton available to European consumers. Second,
British manufacturers in particular were concerned that continental
producers would acquire a rising percentage of the world’s cotton,
competing for American supplies. Third, and most important was “the
increasing uncertainty of the continuance of the system of slavery.”
Drawing on “the blood-stained produce” constituted a “suicidal
dependence” on the “crime of American slavery.”43</p>
<p>In 1835, Thomas Baring carefully observed the United States,
expecting that “the further agitation of the Slave question might
materially alter the result, acting of course, favourably on prices.”
How secure, after all, would slave property be in an industrializing
America with increasing abolitionist sympathies? Would the political
economy of southern planters collide with that of northern economic
elites? And could the increasingly expansionist designs of wealthy and
powerful slaveholders in the American South and their proto-nationalist
project be contained within an industrializing United States? Southern
planters, the “lords of the lash,” emboldened by their wealth, began to
lament their subordinate role within the global economy; their fledgling
designs to revolutionize their own position within it were yet another
threat to the system as a whole. To the “lords of the loom,” raw
material producers had to be politically subordinate to the will and
direction of industrial capital.44</p>
<p>On the plantation itself, another terror was lurking. A visit to the
industrial cotton fields of the “black belt” impressed on many observers
that slavery was unstable because the war between slaves and their
masters could turn at any point. “A Cotton Spinner” warned in 1844 that
“the safety of this country depends upon our obtaining an improved
supply of Cotton from British India,” since in America “on the first
opportunity…these slave-gangs will naturally disperse, the improvident
negroes will cease to grow cotton, and there being no white men to
supply their places; Cotton cultivation in America will terminate.” He
feared an “exterminating war of races—a prospect too horrible to dwell
upon.” Emancipation, he worried, might shake “our country…to [its] very
foundations.” Talk of runaways, refusals to work, and even outright
rebellion kept planters and European cotton manufacturers on their toes.
Merchant Francis Carnac Brown warned in 1848 of “a race of discontented
slaves, ruled by tyranny, and threatening daily some ruinous outbreak,
which it is known must one day come.” Americans tried to explain to
their European customers that slavery in the United States, unlike in
Saint-Domingue, was safe—not least, as Tench Coxe put it, because of the
presence of a powerful white militia and because slaves have “no
artillery nor arms. Tho they are numerous they are much separated by
rivers, Bayos and tracts thickly peopled with whites.” But concerns
remained.45</p>
<p>During these moments of anxiety, European cotton manufacturers looked
to other regions of the world for an increased supply of cotton, to
places such as Africa and India. French officials eyed Senegal in the
1810s and 1820s as a potential alternative source of cotton, but despite
their concerted efforts, little cotton came. In Britain, hopes for
non-American cotton focused squarely on India, whose long history of
cotton exports seemed to make it superbly suited to supply British
factories, not least because manufacturers believed the country had
“overflowing supplies of various descriptions of cotton.” And India
might point toward ways to build a cotton industry not dependent on the
inherent instabilities and exigencies of slavery and expropriations. The
possibilities of Indian cotton were enumerated and analyzed in literally
dozens of books, many with fantastically ambitious titles like Scinde
andandandand The Punjab: The Gems of India in Respect to Their Past and
Unparalleled Capabilities of Supplanting the Slave States of America in
the Cotton Markets of the World. Some of these books were not mere
pamphlets; John Chapman, a former manufacturer of supplies for the
textile industry and railroad promoter in Western India, for example,
published in 1851 The Cotton and Commerce of India, Considered in
Relation to the Interests of Great Britain, with over four hundred pages
of detailed accounts of the soil, agricultural practices, land ownership
patterns, transportation infrastructure, and trade relations of various
parts of India, supported by a vast array of statistical information.
Like him, most writers concluded that “the soil and climate” of India
was “favourable to the growth of” cotton.46</p>
<p>By the 1830s, these individual voices found collective expression. In
1836, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce mentioned Indian cotton for the
first time in its Annual Report. Four years later, they held a special
meeting to pressure the East India Company to do something about cotton
production in India, and in 1847 they sent a petition to the House of
Commons to similar effect. In 1845 the Manchester Commercial
Association, a rival body of local entrepreneurs, even sent a deputation
to the directors of the East India Company to urge them to promote
cotton growing in India, a subject “of paramount importance to the
interests of this district.”47</p>
<p>Some forward-looking manufacturers began to understand that there
might be a deeper, and enduringly profitable, relationship between India
as a market for their goods and India as a provider of raw materials.
They imagined a world in which Indian peasants would export their cotton
and in turn purchase Manchester piece goods: “Nothing can be more
natural than that the inhabitants, deprived of a market for their
cloths, should be encouraged to cultivate the raw material.”48</p>
<p>The agitation for Indian cotton reached its height during the 1850s,
when prices for U.S. cotton rose once more. To be sure, Manchester
cotton interests were still divided on the merits of state intervention
to secure Indian cotton, with some believing that things should be left
to the market.49 But by 1857 the “adequate supply of cotton being
obtained to sustain the industry of this district” had become a major
topic of discussion at the Chamber’s annual meetings. Cotton
manufacturer, Chamber of Commerce president, and member of Parliament
Thomas Bazley believed that “the supply of…cotton is altogether
inadequate” and demanded that more needed to be done to secure cotton
from India, Africa, Australia, and other places, “precisely because the
British government does possess that soil.” Calling upon spinners to
organize to expand cotton production in colonial territories, he was the
prime mover behind the creation of the Manchester Cotton Supply
Association in 1857 “with a view to having a more abundant and universal
supply.” Concerned about the increasing volatility of American politics
in the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Dred Scott decision, the
association literally went to the ends of the earth delivering cotton
gins, giving advice, and distributing seeds and implements to farmers,
while collecting information on various kinds of cotton and various ways
of growing it. The association’s work was a microcosm of the grand
project of cotton capitalists: to transform the global countryside into
a cotton-growing complex.50</p>
<p>For cotton manufacturers, India beckoned for the obvious reason that
it remained one of the world’s greatest growers of the white gold. They
believed that India produced more cotton than the United States;
notoriously imprecise estimates spoke of up to 750 million pounds of
cotton consumed annually within India, in addition to its annual exports
of 150 million pounds and more. This compared favorably with total U.S.
production, in 1839, of 756 million pounds. Traditionally, much of this
cotton was used for domestic production, and even cotton that went into
long-distance trade usually remained within India. Central Indian cotton
had been traded to Madras in the south and Bengal in the east, but with
the decline of the Indian cotton cloth export industry, it was
increasingly brought to Bombay and from there exported to China and, in
limited quantities, to Britain.51</p>
<p>The British East India Company had halfheartedly supported efforts to
increase such exports since 1788, but the quantities involved were
small, not least because of high transport costs. Indeed, until the
1830s, much more cotton was exported to China than to Europe (it paid
for the company’s purchases of tea), and increases in exports to Europe
usually went hand in hand with decreasing exports to China. Thus Indian
cotton agriculture did not significantly become more
export-oriented.52</p>
<p>Yet Manchester manufacturers wanted more. They pressured the British
East India Company, the British government, and, later, the British
colonial administration to develop a multitude of activities to
encourage the growth and export of Indian cotton. Private initiative was
insufficient to change India’s cotton-growing countryside, as “private
companies do not answer” and thus government needed to step in.
Infrastructure improvements were first and foremost on their mind, “a
bridge [needed to be] built, or a railway made, or canals dug, or cotton
cultivated, or machines introduced.” In 1810, the company sent out
American cottonseed to be used in India. In 1816, the Board of Directors
shipped Whitney gins to Bombay. In 1818, four experimental cotton farms
were started. In 1829, further experimental farms were established and
land was given to Europeans “to grow the approved kind of cotton.” In
1831, the Bombay government created an agency to purchase raw cotton in
Southern Mahratta County. In 1839, discussions emerged within the East
India Company on more investments in infrastructure, experimental farms,
and the shifting of capital out of opium production into cotton. Their
cause was aided by legal changes: Starting in 1829, the Bombay
government punished with up to seven years in prison people who
fraudulently packaged and sold cotton. In 1851, another “Act for the
Better Suppression of Frauds” came into effect, with similar goals.
Numerous initiatives sought to increase and improve Indian cotton
exports. And in 1853, as the British acquired Berar, a territory about
300 miles northeast of Bombay, Lord Dalhousie, governor-general of
India, bragged that this “secured the finest cotton tracts which are
known to exist in all the continent of India; and thus…opened up a great
additional channel of supply, through which to make good a felt
deficiency in the staple of one great branch of its manufacturing
industry.”53</p>
<p>As important were schemes to collect, appropriate, and disperse
knowledge. Efforts to survey the state of Indian cotton agriculture
proliferated. In 1830, the administration commissioned detailed reports
on cotton cultivation in India. In 1848 the government of India surveyed
virtually the entire subcontinent, investigating the potential of each
and every region for the increased production of cotton for export.
Indeed, as elsewhere, the statistical and informational penetration of
territory usually came before the incorporation into the global economy,
and at midcentury, Europeans’ knowledge about the climate, soil,
agricultural diseases, labor supplies, and social structures in many
parts of India was still tentative. Simultaneously, exotic seeds,
especially of U.S. origin, were introduced into India, new gins
delivered, and experimental farms established in Gujarat, in Coimbatore,
and elsewhere.54</p>
<p>The most significant of these efforts occurred in the 1840s, when the
East India Company supported the creation of experimental farms run by
U.S.-born cotton planters as a step toward supplanting U.S.-grown cotton
with that from India. Several Americans had offered their services “to
go to Hindustan.” One W. W. Wood, who was “born and bred on Cotton
plantations,” wrote from New Orleans in June 1842 that he had been
“entertaining the Idea for some time of going to India to cultivate the
Cotton plant on my own account but would much prefer patronage and
support” of the East India Company. He received that support and went,
along with nine other planters, to Bombay with seed, gins, and
implements brought from the United States. The planters traveled to
various parts of India, where they were given land, a house, and a
cotton press to grow exotic cotton varieties, mostly from American seed.
They hired workers and contracted for the growing of cotton with
peasants working on their own account. At first things looked good and
the Asiatic Journal reported on the “zeal and diligence” of the American
planters.55</p>
<p>However, despite their best efforts, the farms failed rapidly.
Rainfall patterns frustrated plans to use American farming practices.
Limitations of infrastructure made transport difficult. There was a
growing realization that American practices were too capital-intensive
for the conditions in which Indian cotton cultivators found themselves.
Indians also opposed the use of so-called waste lands for experimental
farms because traditionally “they have been able to feed their cattle
without expense upon the wastelands.” Moreover, farms failed because
peasants paid less attention to the fields on which they worked for hire
than their own fields. And then there was outright resistance. One of
the American farmers, “Mr. Mercer, a few weeks ago, had his bungalow
burnt down, and the estate and works, together with his whole property,
destroyed, except the suit of clothes he had on him.” At such moments,
it certainly did not help that the Americans were “perfect strangers to
the habits and Language of the country.” As a result, Mercer reported in
1845 that the “the experimental farms were only a useless expense to
Government; that the American system of cultivation was not adapted to
India, that the Natives of India were, from their knowledge of the
climate and capabilities of the soil, able to cultivate better and much
more economically than any European, and requested that the farms be
abolished…”56</p>
<p>Indian cultivators, in effect, resisted giving up so-called waste
lands, and they did not easily come to be persuaded to work for wages on
farms, making a “plantation revolution” along the lines of the one
occurring in the Americas unlikely. Indeed, they actively opposed the
impositions of colonial officials. The American cotton farmers in India
complained that they were “obliged to give way to [their workers’]
prejudices.” They complained of the “laziness” of Indian cotton pickers,
of cotton stolen from their farms, that workers went on strike, forcing
them to give in to demands for higher wages, and that capital was
lacking, soils were poor, and they “did not succeed in obtaining labor.”
Eventually they decided that wage labor did not work, with one of the
planters stating categorically that “cultivation by paid labor could,
under no circumstances, be profitably applied to Cotton in that part of
the country.”57</p>
<p>The experiences in India indeed seemed to confirm cotton’s dependence
on coercion. Yet slavery, manufacturers began to understand, could not
be completely trusted. And since manufacturers’ own capital and their
own institutions were insufficient to create alternative systems, they
turned to the state: They demanded new laws regarding land tenure to
secure investments in cotton. They demanded even more investment in
experimental farms and the accumulation of agricultural knowledge, more
state investment in infrastructure, and a tax on the cultivators that
would not discourage cotton growers from investing and improving the
quantity and quality of their crops. Cotton capitalists in Britain and
India understood that capital had to be infused in the countryside, but
they found the conditions there too risky. As the Bombay Chamber of
Commerce argued, “An Extension of production, so great as to reach many
million of pounds annually, and an improvement in processes so radical
as to involve a change in the customs and habits of a whole people,
cannot be produced by measures of petty detail, but can only be looked
for from the operation of causes and principles of commensurate extent
and force.”58</p>
<p>The British East India Company defended itself vigorously against
charges by cotton manufacturers and merchants that it did not
sufficiently encourage cotton cultivation in India. By 1836, the East
India Company had already published a book in its defense, Reports and
Documents Connected with the Proceedings of the East-India Company in
Regard to the Culture and Manufacture of Cotton-Wool, Raw Silk, and
Indigo in India, in which it listed in great detail the myriad of
activities it had undertaken. The company accused the merchants instead,
demanding from them more vigilance when acquiring cotton in India and a
willingness to purchase only clean, well-ginned cotton. As it happened,
European cotton merchants and colonial officials would spend the next
fifteen years accusing one another of being responsible for the inferior
state and insufficient quantities of Indian export cotton.59</p>
<p>Yet despite all the bickering and all of these efforts, Indian cotton
continued to play only a very minor role on world markets and posed no
threat whatsoever to the supremacy of American-grown cotton. To be sure,
more Indian cotton came to the United Kingdom, not least because former
exports to China were redirected toward Europe. But despite that
redirecting of Indian cotton, its market share in the U.K. remained
low—ranging from 7.2 percent during the 1830s to 9.9 percent during the
1850s. “The success which has attended the cultivation of this article
has not been so great as could be wished,” admitted the Revenue
Department in 1839. More categorically, for the Bombay Chamber of
Commerce, the efforts to improve and expand cotton exports “resulted in
signal failure.”60</p>
<p>As the failed experimental farms had suggested, one important reason
was the problematic transportation infrastructure. Cotton was usually
brought to market on bullocks and carts, an extremely slow and expensive
way to transport the raw material. As late as 1854, there were only
thirty-four miles of railroad in India. One expert indeed argued that
American cotton was so much more competitive than Indian cotton because
of the vastly better system of railroads, and, one should add, a vastly
superior system of rivers. There was a disjuncture between the
industrial rhythm of Lancashire and the rhythms of economic life in
India’s cotton-growing countryside. War capitalism had succeeded in
bridging this gap by resorting to bodily coercion elsewhere, but not in
India.61</p>
<p>Perhaps more important than the lack of adequate infrastructure was
that the pattern of production of Indian cultivators did not articulate
well with the needs of production for export. Indian peasants were still
deeply embedded in a cotton economy separate from the cotton upstarts in
Europe. They produced cotton for domestic consumption, and more often
than not produced their own clothing. What Britain saw as a “failure” is
more usefully viewed as evidence for the vast differences in the
possibilities and the priorities of cotton production. The monocultural
production of cotton, so prevalent in the American South, was unknown.
Indian cultivators gave preference to subsistence crops, because they
feared they would starve if their market crop did not succeed—one
observer described “the cultivators growing Cotton andandandand Grains
in their respective fields together, and indiscriminately as their
inclinations or interests dictate.” Local peasants grew cotton only “as
a secondary crop,” lamented a British collector.62</p>
<p>Moreover, Indians were reluctant to embrace new methods of
cultivation and new ways of preparing cotton for market. They resisted
the use of exotic seeds. They continued to gin their cotton by
footroller or churka. This resistance to different ways of growing and
processing cotton, so maddening to the British colonialists, was
entirely rational from the standpoint of Indian cultivators. After all,
the technologies they employed were well adapted to local social and
environmental conditions, and so were the indigenous seeds. Moreover,
the peasants’ biggest customers were indigenous spinners, so they grew
cotton that they knew would appeal to the local markets. Under
conditions of extreme capital scarcity, it made sense to focus on
subsistence crops, proven technology, and established markets. And since
capital was not forthcoming, neither from European merchants nor from
Indian traders, the revolutionizing of production was difficult if not
impossible. Creating a rural proletariat, potentially another strategy
to gain control over production, proved just as impossible without
clear-cut private property in land, which could be fashioned only with
massive expropriations and a powerful presence of the state.63</p>
<p>Just as peasants retained control over land, their labor, and the way
they produced cotton, indigenous merchants remained powerful in the
circuits of exchange, effectively limiting Western encroachment and,
with it, the revolutionizing of the countryside. Trade in cotton was
until the 1860s still largely dominated by Indian agents, brokers,
middlemen, merchants, and even exporters. Despite “strenuous
efforts…made by British interests to adapt the marketing of cotton to
the needs of the export economy,” they largely failed. In 1842 the
Bombay Chamber of Commerce took up a perpetual question: “Why is British
capital, so powerful everywhere else, and from which so much was
expected to be done for India, here so wholly inoperative?” They listed
numerous disadvantages to European capitalists: They were few in number,
with only forty European merchants in Bombay dealing in cotton. They had
to adapt “to a pre-existing state of commerce.” They lamented “the
opposition and imposition that must inevitably be encountered.” And they
had to compete with local spinners.64</p>
<p>Even when Western merchants operated in the cotton-growing districts,
they met opposition at every point: “The cultivators were taught to
distrust them, in consequence of their being Europeans, to demand for
their Cotton a price far beyond what they accepted from Native dealers.
A similar imposition was attempted in every thing—the price of labour,
the hire of carts, the rent of warehouses, and the rates of churka men.”
As a result, the idea of “the maintenance of Establishments in the
interior” for European merchants was quite unthinkable and English
merchants limited themselves “to the purchase of Cotton when brought
here [Bombay] to market.” Even though they knew of the need for
“Mercantile Agency in the interior of the country” as a precondition for
the recasting of cotton production, they were not likely “to risk in a
place so remote from their control the large amount of capital requisite
to erect the buildings, and furnish the advances to the cultivators,
which would be necessary to keep up permanent establishments in
Guzerat.” In Berar as late as 1848, “the Cotton is usually purchased in
small quantities by itinerant Dealers at the Villages where it is
produced,” with much of the cotton spun by the farmers themselves, and
“with no Capitalist in the Country who could make advances to any great
extent worth mentioning.” Unlike in the United States, they were not yet
capable of what a British parliamentary committee in 1847–48 deemed
might be necessary: “for European capitalists to place themselves in
direct communication with the cultivators of the soil.”65</p>
<p>In short, Europeans had only very superficially penetrated India’s
cotton growing. Western merchants had no impact whatsoever on how cotton
was produced in the Indian countryside. They had just as little impact
on the ways cotton moved from its producers to the traders on the coast.
British efforts to grow cotton on large farms with wage labor failed
spectacularly, not least because labor could not be mobilized. One
superintendent of such a cotton farm wrote that “these people all refuse
to come to the Farm when the villagers require their services, and some
who have been paid by Government by the month went away saying they were
sick and unable to work in the Morning, and in the evening I found them
working for the villagers.”66</p>
<p>Given such troubles, coerced labor seemed an attractive option.
Indeed, the example of the great slave-based American system of cotton
growing led one commercial resident to ask in 1831 if it might not be
better if the company would engage in “a little gentle coercion.”
Another writer similarly suggested that Europeans should employ
“apprentices from the Orphan Schools,” while others favored the use of
prison and convict labor. All these came to naught—and with them
European-run cotton plantations. Instead, the East India Company had to
engage constantly with local rulers, local power structures, local
property ownership patterns, and local ways of producing things. British
difficulties in India clarify the decisive difference from the United
States. Though settler conflicts with Native Americans were costly, both
in lives and treasure, the result left settlers in full control of the
land and its resources. Indigenous ways of doing things were no longer.
The local was simply obliterated.67</p>
<p>Indian peasants, like their counterparts in Anatolia, western Africa,
and elsewhere, had shaped a world in which they could resist the
onslaught of European merchant capital. Since Europeans were unable to
transfer bodily coercion and all-encompassing expropriation of land to
these regions of the world, and since they lacked the power to force
some other alternative system of raw material production, much to their
lament, their dependence on the United States deepened. As Mr. Dunbar,
commissioner of Dhaka, concluded in 1848, “In this ancient and populous
Country where land is valuable and rents high, where agricultural
Service is almost unknown and the want of skill, energy and enterprise
of the agricultural population is proverbial, where the produce is so
inferior and the Cost of transportation necessarily so high, competition
with America seems a hopeless task.”68</p>
<p>In contrast to India, Egypt contained the possibility for coercion,
expropriation, and even slavery. Cotton as a major export staple came
late to Egypt, during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha in the 1820s. As
part of Ali’s effort to create a vibrant domestic cotton industry, in
the late 1810s he brought Louis Alexis Jumel, a French textile engineer
long since removed to New York City. Jumel chanced across a cotton bush
in a Cairo garden with unusually long and strong fiber. With the support
of Ali, he developed the strain further, and by 1821 was already
harvesting substantial amounts of what came to be called Jumel cotton,
finding ready markets in Europe.69</p>
<p>Ali understood the potential of this new export crop and ordered it
grown throughout the country. Coercion was integral to this project from
the beginning. Peasants were forced to cultivate cotton on state-owned
lands for their yearly corvée duty, a forced-labor tax. On their own
lands they were also forced to plant cotton in specific ways, to sell
their crop to the state, and to work without pay. The government set
prices for the cotton and controlled all aspects of its transport and
sale to foreign merchants in Alexandria, who were explicitly disallowed
to directly purchase cotton from Egyptian growers. Workers were also
forced to dig canals to water the crop and to build roads that
crisscrossed Lower Egypt to move it to market. As Merchants’ Magazine
and Commercial Review observed in New York in 1843, “Cotton is not
willingly cultivated by the fellah, and would probably be scarcely
produced at all but through the despotic interference of the pasha.” In
Egypt, unlike the United States where force was exerted by private
individuals, violent coercion descended upon rural cultivators from a
premodern state.70</p>
<p>The Egyptian state also dominated the cotton trade itself. Until the
1850s, in contrast to indebted American planters, Egyptian rulers
succeeded in limiting the influence of foreign merchants on the domestic
trade in cotton, despite their centrality in organizing the export trade
from the Mediteranean port city of Alexandria. The government purchased
the cotton at fixed prices, collected it at central warehouses, and then
shipped it to Alexandria, where Ali was the only seller of the raw
material to foreign merchants. In the 1820s and 1830s, between 10 and 25
percent of the revenues of the Egyptian state derived from this sale of
cotton.71</p>
<p>Egyptian cotton came to play a significant role in supplying European
manufacturers.72 British factory owners noted in 1825 that such exports
had “materially checked the advances which lately occurred in the prices
of all other Cottons.” But the prime value of Egyptian cotton, they
argued, was that it could substitute for American long-staple Sea Island
cotton, which they considered important “in the event of any political
event depriving us altogether of the Cotton of the United States.”73</p>
<p>Cotton exports from Egypt, in millions of pounds, 1821–1859
(illustration credit 5.10)</p>
<p>The cataclysmic event did not materialize. Not yet. Instead, cotton
flowed ever more cheaply out of the American South. Slavery and the
expropriation of native lands, fueled by European capital, combined to
feed raw materials relentlessly into Europe’s core industry. The massive
infusion of European capital transformed the American countryside; land
became wealth, and linked across great distances slaves and wage
workers, planters and manufacturers, plantations and factories. In the
wake of the Industrial Revolution, slavery had become central to the
Western world’s new political economy. But this capitalism, based on
territorial expansion and violent domination of labor, was also
inherently unstable: As the Bremer Handelsblatt put it in 1853, “the
material prosperity of Europe hangs on a thread of cotton. Would slavery
suddenly be abolished, cotton production would fall at one stroke by
⅚th, and all cotton industries would be ruined.”74</p>
<p>Relief for cotton-hungry manufacturers, ironically, came from
unexpected quarters, for unexpected reasons: from the slow but steady
collapse of competing circuits of cotton manufacturing in Asia.
Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, local cotton craft
networks remained a powerful presence in the world. In Africa, Latin
America, and throughout Asia, the growing of cotton for household use or
local markets remained important; indeed, it is entirely possible that
as late as midcentury more cotton entered such limited circulation than
entered industrial production. In large parts of Africa, observed Thomas
Ellison as late as 1886, “indigenous Cotton has from time immemorial
been both grown and manufactured, and the natives are for the most part
clothed in fabrics of their own production.”75</p>
<p>In China as well, using traditional methods of production, spinners
and weavers, working mostly in their houses and drawing on the labor of
their dependents, continued to serve their very large domestic market.
Most of the cotton they consumed came from their own or their neighbors’
fields, while others bought cotton from the large cotton merchants of
Shanghai and elsewhere. “Early in the fine autumnal mornings,” observed
a British traveler in 1845, “the roads leading into Shanghae are crowded
with bands of coolies from the cotton farms,” testifying to a world of
cotton distant from the circuits of growing, production, and consumption
dominated by Europeans. Japan too had a flourishing domestic trade in
locally grown cotton, and produced large amounts of cotton goods in
homes and workshops. And Bengal, despite the beginning decline of its
export manufacturing industry, still imported huge quantities of raw
cotton in the first years of the nineteenth century: In 1802, it was
said that Bengal grew a little more than 7 million pounds of cotton, but
imported more than 43 million pounds, principally from western India,
competing with China and Lancashire for the raw material of its core
industry. Despite British designs to the contrary, India continued to be
the most prominent example for such alternative circuits of
cotton.76</p>
<p>Yet while local and regional networks persisted, they would never
again flourish. These smaller networks, defined by custom, convenience,
and profit, were undermined by the ever-widening veins of European
capital and state power. Indeed, the cheapness of cottons enabled by
slavery in the United States would help undermine local manufacturing
everywhere. Many times over, indeed, the empire of cotton would advance
what historian Kären Wigen has called the “making of a periphery.” Tench
Coxe understood that process already in 1818: The export of British
piece goods to India, he perceptively observed, would force Indians “to
turn to raising cotton instead of making piece goods they cannot sell.”
Across the nineteenth century, Europeans gambled on the efficacy of war
capitalism again and again; each time they succeeded in planting new
fields, in coercing more slaves, in finding additional capital, they
enabled the production of more cotton fabrics at cheaper prices, and
they pushed their cotton rivals to the periphery. The destruction of
each of these alternative circuits of cotton, in turn, would further tip
the balance of power in many parts of the world’s countryside, making
more territory and more labor vulnerable to the encroachment of the
global economy. The great irony of this rapacious cycle of war
capitalism, as we will see, is that its success laid the foundation for
its own demise.77</p>
<p>But any hint of demise was distant. In the first half of the
nineteenth century, war capitalism seemed a vast and impenetrable
machine, a painfully efficient mechanism for profit and power. As
Britain’s power grew, capitalists in other regions of the world saw the
possibilities inherent in the marriage of new technologies and bodily
coercion. Certainly, many observers were anxious about the warlike
expropriation of native peoples, the violence on the plantation, and the
social turmoil in England’s industrial cities. Yet wealth and power
beckoned to those able to embrace that new world. Throughout France, the
German lands, Switzerland, the United States, Lombardy, and elsewhere,
capitalists tried to follow the path laid down by Manchester.</p>
