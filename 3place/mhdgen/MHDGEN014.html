New Cotton Imperialism</h4>
<p>New frontiers: Cotton expedition to Togo. Members of the expedition
that introduced American cotton-growing methods into Togo, including
technical experts from Tuskegee Institute, celebrate their first harvest
by posing with three bales of cotton, 1901. From left to right are the
chief of Gyeasekang; unidentified; Akpanya von Boem, a chief; John
Robinson (from Tuskegee); Lieutenant Smend; Waldermeer Horn, the vice
governor of Togo; unidentified; James N. Calloway (from Tuskegee); and
Allen Burks (from Tuskegee). (illustration credit 12.1)</p>
<p>In 1902, Sako Tsuneaki, the director of agricultural affairs in the
Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, whiled away the time on a steamer
journey from China to Korea with Wakamatsu Tosaburo, a Japanese
government official newly transferred from Shashi, China, to Mokpo,
Korea. As they traveled across the Yellow Sea, the two discussed the
prospects of expanding cotton agriculture in eastern Asia in order to
feed the factories mushrooming around Osaka and elsewhere. In 1893,
Japan had imported about 125 million pounds of raw cotton. By 1902
imports, mostly from India and the United States, had increased to 446
million pounds; by 1920, they would rise to more than 1 billion pounds.
Perhaps, agricultural bureaucrat Sako suggested, Korean rural
cultivators could be made to produce more cotton for Japanese factories.
Wakamatsu concurred, observing that in Shashi, where he had just spent
some years, a vibrant cotton-growing industry had emerged. Upon landing
in Korea the two resolved to investigate local cotton-growing practices
and to find ways to increase production.1</p>
<p>Informed by his earlier observations in China, Wakamatsu began to
experiment with various cotton strains on small model farms. Two years
later, in 1904, members of the Japanese Imperial Diet (the parliament)
and the House of Peers, as well as cotton manufacturers, created the
Association for the Cultivation of Cotton in Korea, “following the
example of the British Cotton Growing Association,” which had been
created just two years earlier. The association systematized and
expanded Wakamatsu’s efforts, focusing especially on the introduction of
American cotton strains, building a cotton gin, and eventually
presenting a report to the government of Korea with recommendations to
increase cotton production. By 1906, Japanese spinners had established
the Korean Cotton Corporation in Osaka with a branch office in Mokpo,
providing loans to Korean rural cultivators who mortgaged their cotton
crops to the company. Expanding their activities rapidly, the Japanese
spinners gained “control over much of the raw cotton produced in the
peninsula’s southern cotton belt.” They were aided in this project by
the many agents sent into the Korean countryside by Japanese cotton
merchants to purchase the white gold.2</p>
<p>When Japan began its occupation of Korea in 1910, the new colonial
government took steps to further expand cotton production. In March
1912, “the Governor-General issued…an instruction to the Provincial
Governments of the southern part…concerning encouragement of the
planting of upland cotton.” Both Japanese cotton capitalists and
imperial administrators worried that Japan’s dependence on cotton
imports might endanger the growth of its manufacturing industry. They
especially hoped to disentangle themselves from the British Empire,
given that by 1909, 62 percent of Japanese cotton imports arrived from
India.3</p>
<p>Cotton from colonial Korea, and from Japan’s other colonial
possessions, Manchuria and Taiwan, was one potential solution. Korean
farmers had traditionally produced cotton alongside other crops such as
beans and vegetables on their smallholdings, often in the same fields.
Most of the fiber was consumed in the domestic manufacture of cloth.
Japanese colonialists hoped to recast this indigenous cotton industry
just like their British peers had done in India: by cultivating new
lands, persuading farmers to convert more of their existing fields to
cotton growing, conducting agricultural experiments to improve yields
and quality, and providing state supervision of the selling of the crop.
They drew upon the experiences of rival cotton powers: The Japanese
Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce had indeed investigated the
cotton-growing efforts of the Germans in Togo, the French in French
Soudan (modern-day Mali), and the British in the Sudan. Both the
Association for the Cultivation of Cotton in Korea, founded in 1904, and
the Cotton Cultivation Expansion Plan of 1912 borrowed significant
elements from these foreign models.4</p>
<p>These efforts bore fruit. Korean cotton exports to Japan increased
from an annual average of 37 million pounds between 1904 and 1908 to 165
million pounds between 1916 and 1920. Cotton exports from
Japanese-controlled Kwantung province in China provided another 4.1
million pounds. The production of cotton from American seeds increased
at a particularly rapid rate. By 1915, 263,069 Korean cultivators grew
37 million pounds. Thanks to the efforts of the colonial state, the
Japanese cotton industry had domesticated a small but growing colonial
cotton complex.5</p>

<p>Stories like this could be told about many parts of the world. As
states took on an ever more important role in constituting the new
systems of labor that came to characterize the cotton-growing
countryside after 1865, they also secured vast new territories on which
cotton could be grown, dominating them militarily, politically, and
bureaucratically. Sovereignty over labor, they all understood, became
linked to territorial control. By the late nineteenth century
contemporary observers treated as commonplace that the transition to
cotton production for world markets rested most fundamentally on that
domination of territory by newly empowered imperial states. Having lived
through the grand defeat of slavery in the American South and
experiencing often insurmountable hurdles to transform the global
countryside, cotton manufacturers in particular, concerned with
continuous access to inexpensive cotton and markets, pressured their
governments to exert more control over ever more extensive
cotton-growing lands.</p>
<p>The consolidation of states in the United States, Egypt, the Ottoman
Empire, and elsewhere, as well as the expansion of imperial control over
colonial territories in Korea, western Africa, and Central Asia,
significantly extended the reach of the cotton empire in the decades
after the American Civil War. Conquest and control, however, did not by
itself produce cotton. Expansion demanded incorporation strategies, and
state bureaucrats and capitalists systematically applied lessons learned
from the mobilization of cotton-growing workers in the United States
after emancipation. In some cases, they removed native populations to
make land available for cotton-growing settlers, as in eastern Africa.
But more typically in the period after the American Civil War, they
folded their new subjects into the global cotton-growing complex by
constructing infrastructure, creating new labor regimes, and recasting
local social structures. This happened in western Anatolia, Central
Asia, and western as well as central Africa. This metamorphosis
frequently rested on coercion and violence, but not on enslavement. And
its particular pace and extent varied with the particular ways these
societies had been organized before incorporation and with the relative
capacity of colonizing states. Indeed, integration into the global
economy sometimes failed or bogged down when imperial subjects
successfully retained control of their land and their labor.6</p>
<p>These exceptions, however, prove the rule: In most cases,
emancipation and the emergence of a new imperialism went hand in hand.
Slavery became free labor, local sovereignties gave way to nation-states
and empires, mule and camel trails to railroads, and war capitalism to
scientific agricultural reform, carried out by eager colonial agents
drawing on the lessons learned from industrial capitalism. States
brought military domination and pacification, infrastructure and
property rights in land. And as these states constituted new
far-reaching global networks, global networks in turn fostered the
strengthening of states.</p>
<p>In the wake of the nineteenth century’s great struggles for
emancipation, European cotton-consuming countries, the United States,
and Japan moved decisively to control and exploit territories where
cotton could be grown. This “cotton rush” of sorts reached its zenith at
the turn of the century, when new imperial powers embraced it with as
much zeal as the older colonial states had done during the Civil War.
The reasons were straightforward: While the ability of cotton
capitalists to return African-American workers to the growing of cotton
for world markets by the 1870s had taken some pressure off the world’s
countryside, long-established concerns among cotton manufacturers and
statesmen about secure and inexpensive cotton supplies were amplified by
the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>As cotton prices rose for the first time in a quarter century—between
1898 and 1913 by 121 percent—European and Japanese manufacturers
expressed concerns that the United States would consume increasing
percentages of the cotton harvested on its fields in its own factories,
leading to shortages and even higher prices. These concerns were further
amplified by the temporarily successful efforts by some speculators to
“corner” the market and force higher prices by manipulating future and
spot transactions on the newly established cotton exchanges. Once these
corners failed, a wave of “cotton populism” swept the southern
countryside of the United States, with cotton growers determined to
collectively enable higher prices for their crops. The boll weevil, an
agricultural pest that had begun to spread on American cotton farms in
1892, also seemed to threaten cotton production, and there were
pressures on demand as well with cotton factories spreading to new areas
of the world. British manufacturers, for example, observed that
continental Europeans now consumed one-third of the entire U.S. cotton
harvest, which was more than British factories. “One shudders,” warned
British author Edmund D. Morel, “to contemplate the consequences which
would ensue if anything should again prevent Lancashire from obtaining
her share of the cotton crop of America.” Rising prices, reported an
association of German industrialists, meant a huge sacrifice for the
hundreds of thousands of workers employed in German cotton factories. So
great was the concern for world cotton supplies at the turn of the
century that some modern-day scholars have called this moment a “second
cotton famine.”7</p>
<p>At the same time, the general notion of “raw material independence”
became an increasingly important political goal for policy makers and
capitalists in Europe and Japan. The idea of securing cotton on lands
controlled by imperial states gained traction. As a result, the global
cotton “commodity frontier” was pushed into even more numerous areas of
the world, intensifying what one historian has so aptly termed “the
great land rush.”8</p>
<p>The expansion of the empire of cotton, as we know, was hardly a new
development. Yet the effort at its more “national” organization was a
true departure, considering how deeply the cotton industry had been
embedded within global trade networks that crossed national and imperial
boundaries, and that rested on the connections crafted by merchants. As
industrial capital, not merchant capital, became ever more important to
states, and as these states became ever more important to national
capitalists, the old merchant-dominated order became less relevant, and
statesmen and manufacturers increasingly perceived it as potentially
threatening to their power, their wealth, and their ability to maintain
social stability.</p>
<p>Perhaps most remarkable for its audacity was Russia’s attempt to
secure “domestic” supplies of the white gold. Since the early 1800s,
farsighted government bureaucrats, along with a group of merchants and
manufacturers, had imagined Transcaucasia and Central Asia as a source
of raw cotton to “prevent all those negative consequences that might
arise due to long factory stoppages,” as manufacturer Aleksandr Shipov
argued. The Russian commander in chief in the Caucasus, Baron G. V.
Rosen, had envisaged as early as 1833 that the cotton growers there
“would be our Negroes.” Yet as late as 1857, such efforts reaped few
rewards—Central Asian cotton supplied only 6.5 percent of the needs of
the Russian industry.9</p>
<p>During the 1860s, however, efforts to promote Central Asian cotton
exploded, as a small group of cotton mill owners, united in the Central
Asian Trading Association, met in Moscow to find ways to grow more
cotton for Russian factories. Encouraged by a tripling of prices during
the U.S. Civil War, cotton exports from Central Asia to Russia increased
nearly fivefold to 24 million pounds between 1861 and 1864. In a key
moment in 1865, Russia captured Tashkent and the Central Asian khanate
of Khokand, which were to become important cotton-growing areas in the
future. Manufacturers began to pressure the Russian government to
further its acquisition of Central Asian territories. In 1869 the
Russian Industrial Society, which brought together a wide variety of
entrepreneurs, published numerous petitions agitating for deepening
Russia’s intervention in Central Asia in order to create a market for
Russian goods and a source for cotton fibers. The government responded
favorably, in part because of its geostrategic desire to counter British
moves in Central Asia, but also because the import of cotton weighed
heavily on its balance of trade. By 1890, raw cotton constituted 20
percent of the value of all Russian imports. The capture of Central
Asian territories only whetted the appetite of Russian entrepreneurs. In
1904, Russian industrialists, among them textile manufacturer Baron
Andrei L’vovich Knoop, the son of Ludwig Knoop, whom we encountered
earlier as a Bremen merchant moving to Russia, created the Commission to
Develop Russian Cotton Growing to investigate further possibilities for
the expansion of cotton agriculture in Central Asia.10</p>
<p>Central Asian cotton, as a result, was launched on a path of rapid
state-backed expansion, similar to what happened simultaneously in
India. After the consolidation of Russian rule over Central Asia in the
1860s and 1870s, the imperial government, at the urging of Russian
cotton capitalists, systematically worked to increase cotton production.
In 1871, Russian colonial bureaucrat Shtaba L. Kostenko commanded that
“the aim of all of our efforts has to be the striving to remove from our
inner markets the American cotton and to replace it with our own,
Central Asian one.” To make this possible, the colonial administration
undertook large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the building of
railroads. In remote areas it had taken up to six months to transport
cotton by camel to the nearest railroad station; now the same journey
took two days. The government sponsored seed plantations and sent
agronomists to help farmers improve agricultural techniques. In
addition, the government began planning large-scale irrigation projects
and sent bureaucrats to the United States to study American cotton
growing. They eventually procured American cottonseeds and distributed
them to local peasants; by the late 1880s more than half of the Central
Asian cotton crop derived from these seeds. At the same time, large
Russian cotton manufacturers erected cotton gins in Turkestan and sent
out agents who advanced credit to local growers on the security of their
future crop.11</p>
<p>As time went on, the colonial state and Russian capitalists
increasingly involved themselves in the production process itself,
something they had previously avoided. Despite persistent conflicts
between the state, which was bent on integrating the territory, and
capitalists, who were set on maximizing profits, such efforts resulted
in a dramatic increase in the area of cotton sown. In Turkestan, for
example, the size of cotton land increased by approximately forty-eight
times in the five decades after 1870. As early as the 1880s, growers in
Turkestan produced a quarter of all cotton used in Russian cotton
factories, and more than half by 1909, enough for one historian to call
the province “the cotton colony of Russian capitalism.” The state
protected its colonial cotton production by levying duties on raw cotton
imports, which by 1905 had risen to about 43 percent of the value of
cotton. In 1902, a British traveler observed that “the growing of
cotton…has now become the main occupation of the inhabitants of all the
Central Asian Khanates.” And by the early 1920s, the Central Asian city
of Khokand, a center of the cotton trade, came to be called
“cottonopolis.” Russia had turned itself into one of the most important
cotton-growing countries in the world, ranking fifth behind the United
States, India, China, and Egypt.12</p>
<p>The radical changes that the Russian state and Russian and Central
Asian capitalists were able to effect led others to look with envy at
their success. In 1902, German economist August Etienne remarked with
genuine admiration that Russia “approaches with rapid steps inexorably
its objective to make the Russian cotton industry independent from
America.” Russia deserved praise, since “with its Asiatic cotton culture
it has shown the rest of Europe, what energetic will and well planned
cooperation between national and private forces can do to solve the
cotton question.” A new cotton imperialism had begun to take
shape.13</p>
<p>Other imperial powers soon embarked upon their own ventures. They had
concluded, with Etienne, that “in the overseas program of the European
peoples, the encouragement of cotton culture must take a leading role,
with the explicit goal to emancipate oneself from America.”14 Invoking
memories of the U.S. Civil War, Etienne employed arguments for the
state’s support of national capitalists that were spreading like
wildfire through European capitals. States, after all, could speed up
the commercialization of potential cotton-growing areas of the world in
ways beyond the reach of individual merchants and masters.15</p>
<p>As a result, cotton and colonial expansion went hand in hand, not
only for Russia and Japan, which desperately tried to catch up in the
grand game of securing raw materials for domestic industries, but also
for expansionist stalwarts like Great Britain, France, and the United
States, as well as marginal imperial powers such as Portugal, Germany,
Belgium, and Italy.16</p>
<p>Everywhere, European manufacturers, at times supported by textile
workers and their unions, were the driving force behind this recasting,
pressuring their governments to draw more cotton out of various colonial
possessions in Asia and Africa. In Britain, such imperial cotton
projects had the longest history—recall the enormous range of activities
that the Manchester Cotton Supply Association had embarked upon. After
the U.S. Civil War, imperial cotton projects continued, although at a
lower level, having become less essential as American cotton rushed back
onto global markets. But the desire for colonial cotton reached again
fever pitch around the turn of the century as manufacturing volume and
prices rose and new competitors emerged. In 1901, the Oldham Textile
Employers’ Association observed that “the importance…[of] the Growth of
Cotton within the limits of the Empire…cannot be over-estimated.” A year
later, British cotton manufacturers founded the British Cotton Growing
Association in the cotton metropolis of Manchester, funded by both
manufacturers and textile workers’ unions. The association believed that
“all the cotton Lancashire requires can be grown within the limits of
the Empire.” The Oldham Master Cotton Spinners’ Association agreed: “an
important commercial nation like our own ought not to be dependent on
other countries for the supply of cotton which might possibly be grown
within the limits of the empire.” By 1916, the Empire Cotton Growing
Association joined in the struggle for colonial cotton—though, unlike
the British Cotton Growing Association, under the auspices of the
government itself. This government institution devoted itself to raising
cotton in the colonies, as “it is essential for the future prosperity of
the country and for the welfare of the Colonies, that cotton growing
should be developed as rapidly as possible in all suitable parts of the
Empire.” As late as 1924, the parliamentary secretary of the British and
Foreign Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, John Harris,
reported that a British government commission was investigating “to see
what steps can be taken to encourage the negroes of the British Empire
to grow cotton in such a volume as to gradually free us from the danger
of short supply.”17</p>
<p>In France, cotton manufacturers led the charge for colonial cotton as
well. These efforts, as elsewhere, had begun during the American Civil
War years, and survived into the postwar decades. In 1867, Mulhouse
cotton manufacturer Frédéric Engel-Dollfus agitated for colonial cotton,
and in 1889 Louis Faidherbe, a French colonial official with extensive
experience in Guadeloupe, Algeria, and Senegal, sounded the same note
that “the culture of cotton is the most powerful element in the success
of colonization.” By the turn of the century, French colonial cotton
projects took on increasing urgency: In 1903 French textile
entrepreneurs founded the Association Cotonnière Coloniale so as to
encourage colonial cotton production and promote “the independence of
our national cotton industry.”18</p>
<p>Cotton manufacturers in other parts of Europe followed suit. Belgian
manufacturers in 1901 created the Association Cotonnière de Belgique,
which by 1903 had begun to push for cotton growing in the Belgian Congo,
including shortly thereafter bringing American cotton planters from
Texas to Central Africa. In 1904, Portuguese bureaucrats and
manufacturers founded a colonial cotton-growing association along the
lines of the British Cotton Growing Association. Italian colonialists,
upon the urging of manufacturers organized in the Italian Colonial
Cotton Association, focused on expanding cotton production in
Italian-controlled Eritrea.</p>
<p>Louis Faidherbe, French colonial official (illustration credit
12.3)</p>
<p>Despite the United States’ domination of cotton export markets, even
there cotton manufacturers pressured for a territorial expansion of
cotton production. Such agitation had a long history, and the connection
between territorial expansion and cotton growing had been an important
strand of discussions among northern economic elites in the antebellum
decades. Massachusetts cotton manufacturer Edward Atkinson, an
enthusiastic believer in what he called “free labor cotton,” had pointed
out during the 1860s the great potential for expanded cotton production
in Texas, called upon the government to remove native peoples from areas
that could be used for cotton agriculture, and pushed for the
construction of railroads to transport cotton to the coast. These
sentiments became ever more prominent after the Civil War. In 1868, New
England manufacturers, including Atkinson, in cooperation with southern
cotton planters, created the National Association of Cotton
Manufacturers and Planters, which sought to promote the expansion of
cotton agriculture, primarily in Mississippi and Texas, a project
strikingly similar to those of Europe’s imperial elites. In the early
twentieth century, the New England Cotton Manufacturers’ Association
continued to press for territorial expansion of cotton agriculture.19 To
make such expansion feasible, they sought the twin elements of
state-sponsored infrastructure projects, such as the building of levees
on the Mississippi, and “the introduction of a working population into
the Cotton States.”20</p>
<p>The first wave of this incorporation focused on the territorial
expansion of cotton growing in parts of the world that already supplied
the white gold to global markets. As we have seen, after the Civil War,
Britain steadily strengthened its colonial control in India. Tellingly,
when the nizam of Hyderabad requested in 1876 that Berar be returned to
his control, the British refused, even though the nizam’s government
communicated clearly to Manchester interests that it was “keenly aware
of the importance of developing the cultivation of cotton in these
dominions, and in the future I shall gladly give my attention to
fostering the increase of this production.” Egypt, deeply enmeshed in
the global cotton economy, by 1882 was transformed into a British
colony, alleviating concerns among manufacturers about the “most
damaging effect” created by the “unfortunate embroglio in Egypt”—that
state’s default on its international debt. Territorial control in Egypt
went hand in hand with the expansion of cotton agriculture. In 1861,
cotton was grown on 259,513 acres, fifty years later on 1,767,678 acres.
The land for this expansion came partly from the rededication of wheat
fields, but also from irrigating formerly unproductive lands now made
accessible to commercial agriculture by the construction of roads and
railways. By 1899 the Egyptian Delta Railways Company transported 245
million pounds of cotton, 40 percent of the entire annual harvest. And
by 1902 the dams at Aswan and Asyut enabled a year-round supply of water
in the cotton-growing areas.21</p>
<p>But by the early twentieth century, new cotton-growing areas of the
world also saw an enormous growth of their output. There was an
extension of cotton agriculture in the Ottoman Empire’s Çukurova, for
example, where land once used by nomadic tribes for the herding of
animals was increasingly turned into cotton farms. By 1908, a quarter of
its cultivatable land was used for cotton. In Brazil, cotton cultivation
had expanded during the cotton boom of the 1860s into Ceará, where
subsistence farmers now became ever more involved in production for
world markets. By 1921–22, 1.4 million acres of land were under cotton
cultivation, and by the 1930s Brazil had become the world’s fourth most
important cotton grower, thanks to state support in the form of
infrastructure construction and institution building, such as the
creation of the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas.22</p>
<p>In other older cotton-growing areas, commercial production ex-panded
as well. In Peru, ever more land was rededicated to cotton agriculture,
and as a result cotton exports increased dramatically, from an annual
average of 0.71 million pounds in the years between 1861 and 1865 to an
annual average of 59 million pounds between 1916 and 1920. A few
thousand miles to the South, in Argentina, the government made great
efforts to enable the industrializing nation to become self-sufficient
in raw cotton, part of a larger program of import-substitution
growth.23</p>
<p>Of the greatest magnitude, however, in terms of additional output of
cotton was the further extension of the U.S. cotton complex. Its
expansion had been in some ways comparable to that of Russia—state
agents and military units had captured contiguous territory and
sponsored the construction of new infrastructures to make it accessible.
As in Russia, the state would later drain wastelands, contain waterways,
and build irrigation infrastructures. Yet while Russia mobilized Central
Asian cultivators and forcefully settled nomads to grow cotton (as had
also been the case in the Ottoman Empire’s Çukurova), the United States
removed most indigenous inhabitants from cotton-growing soils as it
encouraged citizens from farther east to move in, combining, as
historian John C. Weaver has put it, “defiant private initiative” with
“the ordered, state-backed certainties of property rights.”24</p>
<p>Capturing and incorporating new territories as a strategy to increase
cotton production for world markets was thus not just significant in the
context of European colonial expansion. The U.S. cotton empire expanded
at a rapid clip and entered entirely new territories. Before the Civil
War, in 1860, 5,386,897 bales of cotton had been produced in the United
States, but in 1920 production had increased two and a half times, to
13,429,000 bales, and the territory used for cotton grew rapidly.
Twenty-two million acres of additional land was plowed under, or a
little more than the total area of the state of South Carolina, or that
of the nation of Portugal.25</p>
<p>In the United States, the expansion of land under cotton occurred in
two distinct ways. Cotton production expanded into the remoter
hinterlands of older American cotton states such as Georgia and the
Carolinas, now made accessible by railroads, where white upcountry
farmers began growing much larger quantities. In the South Atlantic
states, annual production, for example, increased by a factor of 3.1
between 1860 and 1920. In Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi, by
contrast, annual cotton production stayed level until the end of the
century, and declined by about 25 percent in 1920, due to the exhaustion
of cotton soils and the emergence of more productive cotton-growing
areas farther west. Yet even despite the tired soil, cotton production
dramatically expanded in some areas, such as in the Yazoo-Mississippi
Delta, where large numbers of African Americans cultivated cotton,
enabled by new railroads, canals, and levees. As a result, by 1900, “one
of the most highly specialized cotton producing areas in the world”
emerged. The most dramatic expansion of cotton agriculture, however,
occurred farther to the west. In Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and
Texas, the production of cotton exploded from 1,576,594 bales in 1860 to
7,283,000 bales in 1920—a factor of 4.6 in the half century after the
U.S. Civil War. By far the most important expansion took place in Texas,
a state whose farmers had only produced 431,463 bales of cotton in 1860,
but produced ten times as many, 4,345,000 bales, in 1920. Indeed, the
cotton growth of 1920 in Texas alone equaled about 80 percent of that of
the entire South in 1860. And by the late 1910s and early 1920s, vast
investments in irrigation infrastructure by the federal government
enabled a further extension of cotton agriculture into the arid lands of
Arizona and California.26</p>
<p>Territorial expansion—“the great land rush”—was thus crucial to the
position of the United States within the empire of cotton, paralleling
developments in other parts of the world. Most of these new
cotton-growing territories had been captured from Mexico in 1848, and
without their acquisition, Mexico, not the United States, might have
been the world’s premier cotton producer by the early twentieth
century.</p>
<p>The incorporation of these territories relied as much on
infrastructure advances as it did on land grabs. As with India and
Africa, cotton bloomed alongside the railroad. There were no railroads
in Oklahoma before the mid-1880s, but by 1919, 6,534 miles of railroad
crisscrossed the state. In Texas, there were 711 miles of railroad in
1870, but 16,113 miles in 1919, including into the fertile lands of the
blackland prairie, which the Houston and Texas Central had connected to
Dallas in 1872. Once it had done so, cotton production exploded: Dallas
County cultivators grew 3,834 bales of cotton in 1870 but 21,649 bales
in 1880—an increase of 465 percent in only one decade.27</p>
<p>The arrival of cotton growers in most cases displaced the indigenous
inhabitants. In the antebellum decades, native peoples who had inhabited
the cotton-growing territories of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi had
been pushed farther west. Now pressure resumed. In October 1865, the
Kiowa and Comanche were forced to give up land in central Texas, west
Kansas, and eastern New Mexico—land that was turned, among other things,
into cotton plantations. Shortly thereafter, many of the Texas plains
Indians were pushed into reservations in Oklahoma, and so were the last
southwestern Indians during the Red River War of 1874 and 1875, thereby
freeing up further land for cotton growing.28</p>
<p>Yet Oklahoma ultimately provided little protection for these Native
Americans. By the 1880s, the old Oklahoma and Indian territories came
under pressure from white settlers who hoped to displace the native
population from the most fertile lands. In 1889 the U.S. government gave
in and paid the Creeks and Seminoles to surrender claims to land in the
center of Oklahoma. Over the next few years, further “land runs” in
various parts of Oklahoma put ever more pressure on native people. Many
white settlers began to grow cotton, as Oklahoma’s fertile soil and its
infrastructural opening to the world market, thanks to railroad
construction, made such expansion a profitable proposition. By 1907,
when Oklahoma became a state, cotton was grown on more than 2 million
acres and production had reached 862,000 bales, compared to 425 bales
grown on 1,109 acres in 1890. Cleveland County, to cite just one
example, produced thirty-nine bales of cotton in 1890, but 11,554 bales
in 1909, on land that was once the home of the Quapaw. Creek and
Seminole Indians later lived there, tribes that had been forced to leave
the southeastern parts of the United States during the late 1820s and
1830s where their lands once before had been turned into cotton
plantations. Cotton planters chased America’s native peoples from their
land, though eventually they hired some of them to work on cotton
plantations. In Oklahoma, as elsewhere, the dispossession of America’s
native people and the expansion of cotton-growing territories went hand
in hand—state coercion, indeed, was central to the further expansion of
the empire of cotton.29</p>
<p>The territorial expansion of the empire of cotton in the United
States, Central Asia, Egypt, and Korea, among other places, was vast.
Yet statesmen and capitalists pushed the cotton frontier ever further,
and Africa, in particular, became the focus of European efforts. These
European efforts in fact were directly related to the United States’ and
Russia’s successful expansion of their respective cotton empires, and
focused on the goal of emancipating themselves from the United States’
cotton supply. Africa, in other words, was to be the “South” and “West”
of Europe—a supplier of raw materials, labor, and agricultural
commodities that were deemed necessary to confront the global challenge
of a rising United States with its seemingly limitless supplies of
industrial raw materials, and also of a Russia whose very territorial
extent embodied a rising “threat.”30 Imperial efforts at cotton growing
in Africa were the cutting edge of the cotton empire’s new “national”
constitution.</p>
<p>Take Germany, for example. In the last decade of the nineteenth
century this latecomer to colonialism engaged in frantic efforts to
secure cotton from its African possessions. This was not surprising
considering that by 1900 the German cotton industry was the most
significant on the European continent and, indeed, the third largest in
the world. Despite significant productivity increases, the number of
workers directly engaged in cotton spinning and weaving had increased to
nearly four hundred thousand, with an estimated one in eight German
industrial workers so employed by 1913, making the “healthy development
of our cotton industry a vital question for our national economy.” The
value of their output was the most considerable of all domestic
industries and constituted the nation’s most important export product.
In 1897, the German cotton industry produced goods valued at 1 billion
marks, or about 36 percent more than those of the next largest industry,
coal, and 45 percent more than the industry that symbolized Germany’s
economic miracle and all too often overshadows our historical
imagination, the male-dominated iron and steel industry. And no other
German industry was so reliant on other countries for its crucial raw
material. Because all raw cotton came from abroad, it amounted to
Germany’s costliest import. A full 1 billion pounds of cotton were
imported into Germany in 1902. “King Cotton has become the most powerful
ruler,” observed cotton manufacturer Karl E. Supf, “he has deeply
affected the social conditions, yes, even entirely rearranged
them.”31</p>
<p>Considering the size of the industry, German cotton industrialists
understandably expressed a desire to secure an ample, regular, and
inexpensive supply of raw cotton. From the beginnings of a German
mechanized cotton industry that supply had largely come from the United
States. However, the cotton shortages of the 1860s had indelibly etched
in the minds of cotton industrialists and statesmen the danger of
depending on the United States for raw cotton. Indian and Egyptian
cotton did gain market share during the crisis, but by the 1880s and
1890s the United States again supplied—depending on the years—between 50
and 90 percent of cotton to the German industry.32 Such overwhelming
market dominance worried cotton interests. By late century, these
concerns sharpened as German cotton importers realized that new,
competing low-cost manufacturers were emerging in places such as Japan,
the southern United States, and Mexico.</p>
<p>German manufacturers and statesmen could do little to alter this
situation before their creation of a colonial empire in the 1880s. Once
Germany acquired colonies in Africa and the South Seas, however, new
ways of solving the “cotton question” emerged. Interest in African
cotton reached fever pitch at the turn of the century, when cotton
industrialists spoke of a global “Baumwollkulturkampf”—a “cotton-growing
struggle.” Following these concerns, in 1896 these manufacturers created
the Colonial Economic Committee (Kolonial-Wirtschaftliches Komitee), an
organization devoted to utilizing colonies as a source of raw materials
for home industries. More than four hundred German cotton industrialists
contributed funds to its operation.33</p>
<p>Four factors spurred cotton industrialists’ interest in raw cotton
production in German colonies. They were deeply concerned about the rise
in cotton prices at century’s end, which more than doubled between 1898
and 1904. German industrialists argued that the ever greater use of
cotton by the two major growing countries, the United States and India,
was the root cause of such increases, which they saw as permanent. Most
dramatically, the United States had used only about 20 percent of its
home-grown cotton in its own factories before the Civil War, yet by the
1870s that proportion had grown to around 33 percent and to nearly 50
percent after 1900. Moreover, like many American industrialists and
landowners, German manufacturers feared that the United States lacked
sufficient cheap labor to plant, prune, and harvest all the additional
cotton now required on global markets. Labor shortages, they argued,
would eventually limit the expansion of American cotton agriculture. The
cotton market remained volatile, and these price fluctuations made it
difficult to plan profitable production. Colonial cotton, in contrast,
promised to ensure stable and low prices, and as an added benefit could
prevent a repeat of the market disruption they had experienced during
the cotton famine of the 1860s.34</p>
<p>With that scarcity in mind, manufacturers feared that demand for U.S.
cotton by newly emerging manufacturing nations, especially Japan, would
further diminish their supplies. And in a strategic move meant to secure
broad political support for their agenda, cotton manufacturers argued
that a prosperous cotton industry was essential to combatting
working-class upheaval. Karl Supf invoked the terrible social effects of
the American Civil War, and concluded that “it [was] obvious that a
crisis…in the cotton industry would include a social danger whose
results are unpredictable.” Even the generally anticolonial Social
Democrats expressed their hope that colonial cotton would break the
“cotton monopoly” of the United States. The fantastic plan of these
cotton industrialists was to grow cotton for German manufacturers on
German-controlled soil under German supervision—in fact, to become more
like their American and Russian competitors.35</p>
<p>With these arguments, cotton industrialists moved boldly into
Germany’s public arena. Their interests intersected with those of
powerful statesmen and bureaucrats who argued that securing colonial
cotton was of great geostrategic importance. As the scholar, engineer,
and Africa expert Ernst K. Henrici observed in 1899, “In the great
economic competition among peoples, mass production and mass consumption
are becoming central. Our colonies, if they should be of real benefit to
the mother country, need to aspire towards delivering great quantities
of raw materials, so that they can in turn purchase great quantities of
the industrial products of the motherland.” Only colonial cotton
production, argued economist Karl Helfferich, could break the “economic
rule of America over the European cotton industry.” Colonial cotton, in
short, was the only way to resist “American rape.”36</p>
<p>Colonial cotton symbolized the new symbiosis of a powerful
nation-state with powerful national industries. This symbiosis in fact
characterized a new form of global capitalism centered on the
strengthening of national capital in rival capitalist nations.37</p>
<p>Cotton growing was important to European expansion in Africa from its
very beginning, just as Africa had provided much of the labor that had
enabled cotton industrialization since the 1780s. For example, in
1888—only four years after its African explorations had begun—Germany
embarked upon its first systematic trials of growing cotton for world
markets on the African continent. In May 1890, a Samoan cotton planter,
Ferdinand Goldberg, arrived in the German colony of Togo to investigate
the possibilities of cotton growing there. While his experiment failed,
in 1900, as we will see, the German imperial government made another
effort, recruiting cotton farmers from Alabama to go to Togo and expand
its cotton agriculture. At the same time, colonial bureaucrats and
cotton manufacturers built huge cotton plantations in German East
Africa. In 1907, German textile industrialists Heinrich and Fritz Otto
opened a cotton farm in Kilossa; three years later, about a thousand
workers cultivated cotton on a full 37,065 acres. Soon the Ottos were
joined by the Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei and by manufacturer Hermann
Schubert from Zittau in Saxony.38</p>
<p>French cotton manufacturers and colonial bureaucrats made similar
efforts. In the French Soudan, in Côte d’Ivoire, and in French
Equatorial Africa, colonial penetration went hand in hand with an effort
to secure cotton—the French minister of colonies studied the prospects
for colonial cotton in great detail. African cotton exports to France at
first only supplied a very small percentage of the cotton used by the
French industry, but they increased rapidly. Côte d’Ivoire, for example,
supplied next to no cotton in 1912, but more than 4.4 million pounds in
1925. In other colonies, similar developments occurred. Portuguese
colonialists in Mozambique began their first cotton-growing experiments
in 1901, an effort that produced 6 million pounds by 1928. The Belgians
had begun their first tentative cotton-growing efforts in the Congo
territory in 1890, yet production only exploded in the 1920s, and at a
cost of tremendous violence. In 1920, rural cultivators produced 3.4
million pounds of cotton in the Belgian Congo, 98.8 million pounds in
1931, and 312 million pounds in 1941. This was a respectable amount,
equaling about 15 percent of the production of the United States before
the Civil War, when King Cotton reigned supreme.39</p>
<p>The British, however, undertook the most significant effort to grow
cotton in Africa. By 1913, 74 percent of all cotton exported from Africa
to Europe came out of British colonies. In the eyes of the British
Cotton Growing Association, no other part of the world had “larger
latent possibilities than our West African possessions,” with plenty of
land and labor available. As Africa’s people could no longer be sold to
the Americas, Europeans concluded that they might profitably be
encouraged or compelled to grow agricultural commodities for world
markets at home. Altogether, Africa exported more than 2.315 billion
pounds of cotton in 1930, a little more than the United States in the
year before the Civil War.40</p>
<p>Taken together, between 1860 and 1920, 55 million acres of land in
Africa, Asia, and the Americas, at the very least, were newly planted
with cotton for world markets—an area larger than that of Massachusetts,
Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New York
combined. Approximately 80 percent of all that new cotton-growing land
was situated in territories that had not grown cotton in 1860, the vast
majority of which had come under the effective control of colonial
powers only during those years. Indeed, by 1905, cotton experts
estimated, a full 15 million people, or about 1 percent of the world’s
population, were engaged in the growing of cotton. Imperial expansion
and the production of ever more cotton for world markets were
inextricably linked.41</p>
<p>With the territorial scope of the cotton empire spreading on the
wings of powerful imperial states, the struggles over labor mobilization
spread as well. Territory alone never sufficed. Indeed, the core
question that continued to face these states was the same as it had been
in 1865, upon the emancipation of cotton workers in the United States:
how to motivate rural cultivators to grow cotton for world markets—that
is, how to effect the transformation of the countryside. As the French
Association Cotonnière Coloniale put it, it was easy to secure land, but
that land “needs arms, labor.”42</p>
<p>No colonial ruler followed the example of the United States, which
had made cotton-growing territories available by removing the native
peoples who had dwelled on those lands for centuries. Native peoples in
places such as the Çukurova, Central Asia, Egypt, and East Africa were
certainly also forced to abandon their use of the land to make space for
cotton—a wave of expropriation that accompanied the geographic spread of
cotton agriculture in particular, and capitalism in general. Yet
colonial governments and strengthening nation-states usually tried to
integrate these rural cultivators into the cotton-growing complex.
Instead of displacing them, colonizers drew upon their labor in three
distinct ways. In some settings, such as India, Central Asia, and
western Africa, cotton continued to be produced by indigenous farmers
and sold to Western merchants. In other parts of the world, labor was
mobilized by settling formerly nomadic people. This was the case, as we
will see, in Central Asia, and in the Çukurova, where nomadic groups who
for centuries had herded their animals on these plains were settled so
as to make space for Anatolia’s most significant cotton-growing complex.
In yet other areas, settlers from elsewhere came to organize cotton
growing by indigenous people on plantations, such as in Algeria and
German East Africa, but also in parts of Mexico and Argentina.43</p>
<p>No matter which strategy colonial bureaucrats and capitalists
employed, eventually the push toward commercial cotton agriculture, as
we have seen elsewhere in the cotton countryside, permanently recast
social structures. Russian Central Asia provides one example for such a
shift. Before Russian occupation, Central Asians grew cotton, spun yarn,
and wove cloth, using some for their own needs and exporting the rest to
distant markets. Indeed, throughout Central Asia, cotton and cotton
products were the most significant industry. Caravans of up to five
thousand camels traversed the steppes between the Central Asian khanates
and Russia carrying cotton cloth and yarn. The raw cotton for this
thriving industry was harvested on small family farms as one crop among
many, often sharing the same field with rows of wheat. Most of the
cotton grown by family labor was used for the production of textiles
within the household, while local merchants bought small quantities to
be worked up for trade in more distant markets.44</p>
<p>Central Asia was thus a source of manufactured cotton textiles for
Russia. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, however, after
Russia captured these territories, it became, as we have seen, a
supplier of raw cotton for the factories in Moscow and Saint Petersburg,
and a market for Russian cotton cloth. To effect that transition,
Russian entrepreneurs and colonial bureaucrats rapidly and radically
reshaped the cotton-growing countryside. At first, as elsewhere in the
empire of cotton, metropolitan merchants and agents of Russian textile
firms arrived, purchasing cotton from small farmers and providing them
with credit, enabling them to specialize in a nonedible crop. Once
cotton exports expanded, these firms increasingly specialized in
exporting the crop to metropolitan Russia, and an indigenous capitalist
class emerged to deal with the myriad peasant producers, a development
roughly parallel to what was unfolding in the southern United States and
in India. They provided essential working capital to small farmers,
typically charging interest of between 40 and 60 percent annually,
though rates of more than 100 percent were not unknown. Such exorbitant
interest rates, combined with one or two poor harvests or a price
downturn, usually sufficed to make peasants entirely dependent on these
advancing merchants even when they did not lose outright control over
the land.45</p>
<p>By the 1880s, Russian entrepreneurs set out to create large cotton
plantations to supplement the cotton grown by small farmers. These
plantations, however, quickly failed due to labor shortages. As
elsewhere, rural cultivators were reluctant to work for wages and
instead preferred to work their own or rented land. As one German
observer remarked, “There are only a few propertyless, who can be
considered for this kind of work. Landless natives prefer to cultivate
on their own account small rented fields. For these reasons, the sowing
of cotton on large plantations occurs too late in the season….
Entrepreneurs, who own large plantations, find themselves forced to rent
them in small units to the natives, under the condition that all cotton
grown is to be delivered to the landlord.”46</p>
<p>As a result of both the inability to mobilize sufficient numbers of
workers for large cotton plantations and the tenuous situation of
owner-occupiers, a system of sharecropping increasingly emerged, akin to
the one prevailing in the U.S. South. The German consul in Saint
Petersburg remarked on these changing social relations in 1909, noting
that “more and more of the land of long-settled planters is being
absorbed by capital-rich merchants; the former owners of the soil in
many cases continue to work their former properties as renters of the
purchasers of the land.” As a result of the crisis of owner-occupiers,
middlemen acquired large tracts of land, while the refusal of these
landless rural cultivators to work for wages on plantations forced
landowners to employ them as sharecroppers. The class structure of this
portion of the cotton zone, as elsewhere, changed significantly in the
course of a few decades, with the emergence of a large group of indebted
farmers and landless agricultural workers.47</p>
<p>Sharecropping, however, was often just a way station on a path toward
wage labor. An ever larger number of cultivators eventually became hired
laborers, despite their preferences, as a result of a large wave of
expropriation that swept the cotton-growing countryside. Small farmers,
highly indebted, lost access to the land and thus were left with few
options but to sell their labor. In the cotton district of Fergana,
there were approximately two hundred thousand landless workers by 1910.
By 1914, 25 to 30 percent of the Fergana population was landless, as the
Central Asian countryside, thanks to the determined actions of the
Russian state and its cotton capitalists, came to resemble that of the
American South. In addition, many of the nomads of Turkestan, losing
land and access to fodder crops for their animals, were now forced to
settle and make themselves available as agricultural laborers.
Globalization once more fixed people to particular places, particularly
those places that were not their own, while divorcing them from control
over agricultural resources.48</p>
<p>“The second hilling of cotton with native hoes”: Central Asian cotton
growers, 1913 (illustration credit 12.4)</p>
<p>This drastic recasting of Central Asian economies opened up new
markets for Russian cotton manufacturers, and by 1889 a British traveler
observed that “money…is being taken from the pockets of Bombay and
Manchester, and transferred to the pockets of Nijni Novgorod and
Moscow.” This escalating focus on cotton growing, as elsewhere, had a
grave impact on food security. Like other cotton-growing areas of the
world, Central Asia now became dependent on food imports, while at the
same time peasants’ income became “highly vulnerable to fluctuations in”
the cotton market. By World War I, the recast class structure, along
with a huge deficit in food crops thanks to the reorientation of local
agriculture toward cash crops, produced terrible famines, resulting in
significant depopulation. In Turkestan, for example, the population fell
by 1.3 million people, or 18.5 percent, between 1914 and 1921.49</p>
<p>As states’ efforts to control territories by administrative,
infrastructural, legal, and military means sharpened along with their
capabilities and resources, the question of how precisely to mobilize
cotton-growing labor remained prominent. Expertise was in high demand.
The surprising, even unlikely story, of how a small group of African
Americans, the descendants of slaves, came to play an important role in
the efforts by German colonists to recast cotton agriculture in Togo
illustrates both the efforts to access colonial sources of cotton for
national industries and the ongoing struggle to find cotton-growing
labor.</p>
<p>It was a stormy November morning in 1900 when the Graf Waldersee
steamed out of the port of New York for its journey across the Atlantic
to the German city of Hamburg. Among the more than two thousand
travelers who glanced one last time at the receding steeples of Trinity
Church, the towering Manhattan Life Insurance Building, and the Statue
of Liberty, four passengers stood out: James N. Calloway, John Robinson,
Allen Burks, and Shepard Harris. All were the sons of slaves, from
Alabama, and connected to Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Industrial and
Normal Institute. Calloway was a teacher, and Robinson, Burks, and
Harris were students or recent graduates. Perhaps even more remarkable
was their mission: They had boarded the Graf Waldersee that morning as
part of a journey that was to bring them to new jobs in a faraway
land—the German colony of Togo, a sliver of West Africa that the Germans
had acquired in 1884. In the ancient homeland of the Ewe, these African
Americans were to instruct the German colonialists and their subjects on
how to grow cotton for export, “to determine the possibility of a
rational cotton culture as a native culture, and…to show the
marketability of the product for German industry.50</p>
<p>For the next eight years, these Tuskegee experts advised German
colonialists on how to extract more cotton for export from African rural
cultivators. They built experimental cotton farms, introduced new
strains of cotton, opened a “cotton school,” expanded the local
infrastructure, and used increasingly coercive measures to force local
cultivators to grow cotton for world markets. And indeed, between 1900
and 1913, cotton exports from Togo increased by a factor of
thirty-five.51</p>
<p>Bereft of experience in cotton growing, German colonial bureaucrats
and textile industrialists had looked to the United States for expertise
in such matters and immediately had settled on the possibilities of
recruiting African Americans to their colonial cotton venue, assuming,
like most of their imperial counterparts, that “cotton culture since
time immemorial [is] the Negro’s favorite culture.” To do so, in the
summer of 1900 a German aristocrat and agricultural attaché at the
German embassy in Washington, D.C., Beno von Herman auf Wain, traveled
to Roslindale, Massachusetts, to meet African-American activist and
Tuskegee leader Booker T. Washington, asking him for help in recruiting
cotton planters and a mechanic “to teach the Negroes there [in Togo] how
to plant and harvest cotton in a rational and scientific way.” By late
September, Washington was able to confirm that he had selected four men
who were ready to go. James Calloway, forty, director of the cotton
section of Tuskegee, was to direct the mission and supervise its younger
members. He had been in charge of Tuskegee’s eight-hundred-acre farm and
spoke some German. He was to be joined by John Winfrey Robinson, an 1897
Tuskegee graduate; Allen Burks, a 1900 Tuskegee graduate; and Shepard
Harris, who had entered Tuskegee in 1886 and had learned the carpentry
trade there. They were all the sons of slaves, and according to
Washington, the ancestors of two of these experts “came from this part
of Africa.” Washington insisted to von Herman that “I should very much
hope that your Company will not make the same mistake that has been made
in the South among our people, that is, teach them to raise nothing but
cotton. I find that they make much better progress financially and
otherwise where they are taught to raise something to eat at the same
time they are raising cotton.”52</p>
<p>Once Calloway, Robinson, Burks, and Harris arrived in Togo, their
operations unfolded in grand style. On land once controlled by the king
of Tove, they ventured to build a cotton farm much like the ones they
had left behind in the United States. With the help of two hundred local
men they cleared the high grass and trees, while local women and
children collected the remaining roots to burn them. As a result of such
and other exertions, by May they had planted about twenty-five of these
acres in cotton and by July about one hundred acres. Starting
systematically and virtually ignoring the accumulated experience of the
people of Tove, Calloway and his colleagues planted fields with
different kinds of cotton at various times to investigate what cotton
would grow best and when it should be sown. By April, Calloway reported
proudly to Booker T. Washington that “our work looks quite promising…and
we believe that we will make cotton.”53</p>
<p>Despite these energetic beginnings the Tuskegee experts soon
encountered numerous difficulties. For the African-American planters,
for example, it was unimaginable to run a successful cotton farm without
draft animals, but the rural cultivators around Tove, reported John
Robinson in astonishment, “were as afraid of a horse or cow as a common
American youth is of a ‘mad dog.’ ” Not only were they unfamiliar with
using draft animals, but the animals themselves did not survive long in
the local disease environment. Unanticipated patterns of rainfall also
created problems. When the rains started in July, the cotton that the
Tuskegee experts had planted right after their arrival rotted. They
could have learned as much from local cultivators, but their firm belief
in the superiority of their own methods and their inability to
communicate in the local language precluded such lessons. The Tuskegee
experts also faced nearly insurmountable problems relating to the lack
of infrastructure. In order to get their ginning equipment from the
beach near Lomé, where they had left it upon arrival a few months
earlier, to Tove, they first had to widen the road to make it passable
for their wagons. They then needed to hire thirty people to draw the
carts, and they still took more than two weeks to return with the
equipment. Such reliance on human muscle power also hindered the ginning
process.54</p>
<p>Despite these frustrations, Calloway, Robinson, Burks, and Harris
harvested one bale of Egyptian cotton and four bales of American cotton
on their experimental farm in the early summer and five more bales of
American cotton in November and December. Considering the enormous input
of labor, land, and expertise, this was a meager harvest, but both
Calloway and the Colonial Economic Committee considered it a success.
The committee concluded that the local climate was indeed, as expected,
favorable for the growing of high-quality cotton, that the indigenous
population was willing to embrace the crop, and that plenty of land was
available to grow cotton, perhaps as much as in Egypt. Calloway
concurred, suggesting that production could be expanded further by
creating markets where indigenous people could bring their cotton for
sale, and by educating rural producers in agricultural techniques,
especially the use of plows and draft animals. If these reforms were
embraced, Calloway expected that “in a few years we shall be able to
export many thousands bales of cotton from this colony. This will not
have an effect on the market of the world; it will nevertheless be of
great advantage to Germany and especially to the 2½ millions of natives
of this colony.”55</p>
<p>The amount of cotton grown by the Tuskegee experts during their first
year in Togo may have been exceedingly small, but the goal of the
Colonial Economic Committee had never been to make Calloway and his
colleagues into major cotton growers. What German industrialists instead
had hoped for was to learn from these experienced cotton farmers and to
then transfer that knowledge to local growers. Their goal from the
beginning was to make cotton production in Togo a “Volkskultur,” a
people’s culture, and not, as elsewhere in the German colonial empire, a
“Plantagenkultur,” a plantation culture.56</p>
<p>This choice was partly based on the tremendous problems German cotton
interests had encountered with the mobilization of labor for their
plantations in German East Africa. These plantations, many of them run
by German textile industrialists, had had trouble securing a sufficient
number of African laborers, who by and large were not willing to work
there. Though local German planters had tried to persuade the colonial
administration to raise taxes in order to force rural producers to work
for wages, the government had been reluctant to do so, fearing open
rebellion.57</p>
<p>Such German experiences paralleled those of other colonial powers. In
British East Africa it was clearly understood by experts that “the
dearth of labour is the most serious difficulty…. Coolies must be
brought from a distance, as the inhabitants, who get four crops a year
off the land without putting themselves to any inconvenience whatever,
cannot be got to see that there is any reason why they should work for
hire.” Wage labor, in fact, was extremely difficult to institutionalize.
In British Uganda as well, growing cotton had “consistently been opposed
by the peasant growers who are its principal intended beneficiaries.” As
a result, British colonialists came to believe that “the native will do
better work when farming on his own account than when working for wages
on a plantation owned by Europeans.”58</p>
<p>German cotton policy, like that of other colonial powers, was
influenced by its encounter with the region’s inhabitants, the Ewe, and
their old and thriving indigenous cotton industry. For centuries, rural
cultivators had interspersed their fields with cotton plants, which
local women spun into yarn and men wove into cloth. Throughout the
nineteenth century, some of this cotton had also been traded across
substantial distances. During the American Civil War, some had even
entered world markets, as local rulers had created cotton plantations
that they worked with slave laborers, allegedly exporting twenty to
forty bales of cotton a month to Liverpool. As late as 1908, the German
colonial government reported that manufactured European textiles had not
yet destroyed the indigenous spinning and weaving industry. Such a
thriving cotton textile industry indeed could be found throughout most
of Africa, despite European imports of cloth.59</p>
<p>It was this thriving domestic industry that the German colonialists
hoped to recast when they expanded their influence into the Togolese
hinterland during the 1890s. They hoped that they would be able to
change its internal orientation to an external one, just like the
British had been able to do in India, and the Russians in Central Asia.
Thanks to the exposure to “scientific” agriculture, infrastructure
improvements, and incentives provided by “free” markets, indigenous
farmers were to grow more cotton of a uniform quality and then sell it
to German merchants—just like former slaves had done in the United
States. This “Eingeborenenkultur”—native culture—was another attempt,
after sharecropping, to solve the vexing question of labor that had been
at the core of the world cotton industry since the emancipation of
slaves in the United States thirty-five years earlier.60</p>
<p>Unable to mobilize labor for colonial cotton growing on plantations,
and inspired by the expansion of “free labor” cotton in the United
States as well as the seemingly successful transmission of these
experiences to Togo by the Tuskegee experts, German cotton interests
hoped to set up a small number of model farms that would serve as
examples to the Ewe. Moreover, the German colonial administration, along
with the Tuskegee experts, developed a number of policies to promote
their common goals: to encourage Ewe cotton growers to produce more
well-ginned and -packed cotton and move it speedily to market. First, to
improve the quality of cotton, the Colonial Economic Committee, along
with private German investors such as the Deutsche Togogesellschaft, set
up gins throughout the cotton-growing areas of Togo. Growers thus did
not need to gin the cotton themselves nor to transport the much heavier
raw cotton over long distances. Purchasers, in turn, gained control of
the cotton much earlier in the production process. Second, the colonial
government tried to make the cotton more uniform in appearance by
distributing seeds to growers. Here, the studies of the Tuskegee experts
mattered a great deal, as they had experimented with Egyptian, American,
Peruvian, and Brazilian seeds and had also cataloged existing seeds in
Togo. After 1911, an American variety, mixed with Togo strains, was
marketed under the name “Togo Sea-Island” and was the only strain
distributed by the German authorities. Third, to encourage rural
cultivators to grow more cotton, the colonial government set minimum
prices for the purchase of cotton, presumably making it less risky for
growers to plant cotton. Fourth, to export this cotton, Tuskegee
experts, colonial authorities, and the committee concentrated on gaining
control of the cotton market, at the beginning mainly by sending members
of the cotton expedition, including Calloway and Robinson, to remote
areas to purchase cotton from growers. Indeed, by 1902, the Tuskegeans
had fanned out over a large area of Togo, running various experimental
farms and purchasing cotton whenever there was an opportunity to do so.
They had also participated in the building and supervising of cotton
collecting stations in various towns.61</p>
<p>Price guarantees, ginning facilities, seed selection, and control
over markets were critical measures to make more cotton available to
German merchants, but even more crucial was the rapid development of an
infrastructure to move cotton to the coast. When Calloway and his
colleagues first arrived in Togo, it took fifteen days to go to Lomé and
return, in wagons pulled by local workers. By 1907, when a railroad
connected the most important cotton areas to the coast, transportation
time had been cut to a few hours.62</p>
<p>In all of these measures, the colonial state played a central role.
Indeed, prices, markets, and infrastructure were creations of the
colonial administration. And the colonial state’s role went further: By
taxing rural cultivators and making these taxes payable in labor, the
state coerced them to, among other things, carry cotton from Tove to the
coast, to build railroads, and even to clear land for cotton.63 By
recasting the context in which rural cultivators came to make their
decisions, they hoped to bend their inclinations toward embracing world
market production of cotton.</p>
<p>Taken together, the efforts of the Tuskegee experts and the colonial
government were spectacularly effective. Cotton exports from Togo rose
from 31,863 pounds in 1902 to 238,472 pounds in 1904, and 1,125,993
pounds in 1909. This was only a minuscule part of German cotton imports
(indeed, Germany never got more than half a percent of its cotton supply
from its colonies), but the rate of expansion (increasing by a factor of
thirty-five in seven years) suggested that colonial cotton would have a
bright future.64</p>
<p>Yet despite such a promising beginning, after 1909, further increases
in cotton exports eluded the Tuskegee experts, the Colonial Economic
Committee, and the German colonial administration. In 1913, the last
full year of German colonial rule in Togo, cotton exports were slightly
lower than they had been in 1909. The limits to such an expansion were
largely rooted in the ways cotton fitted into the agricultural schemes
of local producers. Ewe cultivators, after all, had their own ideas
about commodity production, ideas that did not necessarily correspond
with those of the Tuskegee experts or the German colonialists.</p>
<p>As elsewhere in the global countryside, cultivators desired to
maintain economic and social patterns that gave them control over their
work, subsistence, and lives. Traditionally, women had interspersed
their corn and yam fields with cotton plants. This provided them with an
additional crop that did not require much additional labor, as the land
had to be hoed and weeded in any case. At first the production and
eventual export of cotton was not necessarily disruptive of these
agricultural patterns. The fact that cotton occupied such a definite
place within traditional work patterns and a long-standing gendered
division of labor, however, placed severe limits on how much this
culture could be extended. To the chagrin of German colonial
authorities, it meant, among other things, that Togolese peasants
refused to engage in the monocultural production of cotton, which
according to a German report was much disliked because it was much more
labor-intensive and not necessarily more profitable. Corn and yams,
moreover, provided cultivators with food, no matter what the price of
cotton. The prices German colonial administrators and merchants offered
for raw cotton were too low to persuade peasants to risk abandoning
their subsistence crops and to engage only in the backbreaking work of
cotton monoculture. Indeed, even colonial cotton enthusiast August
Etienne recognized dryly that an exclusive focus on the growing of
cotton “entails some risk for peasant economies.”65</p>
<p>Removing cotton from the hinterland: a train loaded with cotton bales
in the German colony of Togo, 1905 (illustration credit 12.5)</p>
<p>Moreover, cotton exports were limited by keen competition from
indigenous spinners for the white gold. Hans Gruner, the head of the
German administrative post Misahöhe Station, reported in December 1901,
“As in other things the native artisans spoil the price of the raw
material, as they receive for the products of their skill unusually high
prices.” These spinners and weavers, said Gruner, though few in numbers,
were willing to pay 50 pfennige for a pound of clean
cotton—significantly more than the 25 to 30 pfennigs the German
colonialists offered.66</p>
<p>Cotton spinning in Togo (illustration credit 12.6)</p>
<p>Such price discrepancies show that a market in cotton never
developed; indeed German merchants who wanted to purchase cotton in Togo
had to formally guarantee that they would not pay more than the price
stipulated by the colonial administration. Throughout Africa, colonial
authorities created such highly regulated and supervised markets, which
became increasingly coercive to break peasants’ preference to sell
cotton to the thriving and more profitable local cotton industry.67</p>
<p>European colonialists competed with African purchasers of raw cotton
and the continued strength of the domestic cotton industry. They
understood clearly, as British economist William Allan McPhee argued in
1926, that “part of the problem, then, is to divert the supply of cotton
from the Nigerian hand-looms to the power-looms of Lancashire.” The goal
was to replace indigenous cloth with imported cloth, to set people free
to grow cotton to export it to Europe, a lesson that European cotton
kings had learned in India first. Frederick John D. Lugard, a British
colonial official in Nigeria, hoped for the decline of cotton
manufacturing in the old weaving city of Kano (“Africa’s Manchester”) to
facilitate greater exports, since “the cotton of Zaria will then cease
to come to the looms of Kano.” To destroy that industry, a “better class
of English cloth than that now imported is required, which will
supersede the native, and so bring the raw cotton on to the market.”
Best of all, “The industries of spinning thread, weaving and dyeing
afford…occupation to many thousands who may possibly become additional
producers of raw cotton.” Deindustrialization, in his eyes, was the
prerequisite for incorporating this African territory and its people
into the orbit of Manchester.68</p>
<p>Last but not least, the very fact that most African cultivators
remained far removed from world markets and experienced little if any
commercialization of their lives meant that they felt little economic
pressure to produce cash crops, unlike, for example, upcountry farmers
in the United States. Thus the Ewe could back up their preference for
mixed farming with their ability to maintain it. In precolonial Togo,
the Ewe had bought and sold some goods on markets and engaged in
long-distance trade. But even after the arrival of the Germans,
capitalist social relations had only very marginally penetrated Togo;
rural cultivators resisted the logic of long-distance markets in favor
of long-established local exchanges and safeguarding their own
subsistence production. German colonial officials bemoaned that “unlike
America, the peasant here is not dependent on cotton growing for his
subsistence. The latter always has access to other crops, and his needs
are so low, that he can live without any cash income for extended
periods of time.” The “dread of starving” that British abolitionists had
hoped would replace the “dread of being flogged” as a motivation for
colonial people to produce crops for world markets failed in Togo in the
face of plentiful alternatives. Such resistance to the global
marketplace, moreover, had astonishing staying power, because the
Germans were unable to institute systems of exploitive credit
relations.69</p>
<p>Even before Togo’s cotton cultivation stagnated, German colonial
authorities understood these forces well. They began to look to
experiences elsewhere so as to learn how rural producers could be
pressured to increase their production of cotton. Colonial Economic
Committee member Karl Supf, aware of the tensions between subsistence
and world market production, suggested that the goal of colonial policy
should be “to bring the Natives into economic dependence upon us.” One
way to do so, he suggested, was to increase local taxes and make them
payable in cotton. Alternatively, the governor of Togo suggested in
December 1903 that small sums of money, secured by future cotton
harvests, be advanced to peasants to enable them to focus on cotton, as
“an emphatic influence of the governmental agencies on the natives at
least for a number of years is essential.” He thought the government
should explicitly look for ways to “pressure those natives, who took on
responsibilities by voluntarily accepting seeds, credit or advances or
other support for cotton growing.” Yet despite their willingness to
force cultivators, the Germans found old habits difficult to break,
especially because the relatively weak presence of the German colonial
state left the resilient social structure of rural producers, predicated
on the continued access to plentiful land, largely untouched. Railroads,
markets, and price guarantees were not sufficient to persuade growers to
abandon subsistence agriculture.70</p>
<p>With efforts to involve rural cultivators in debt schemes faltering,
and outright expropriation of land beyond the power of the colonial
administration, other forms of coercion became more appealing. While
cotton manufacturer Karl Supf recommended “slight pressure,” local
colonial administrator Georg A. Schmidt suggested the need for “strong
pressure” as the best way to increase cotton production. Colonialists
systematically undermined markets by setting fixed prices that were
completely detached from the world market price, compelling cultivators
to bring their cotton to market in ways exactly prescribed by the
colonial administration, eliminating middlemen, forcing certain cotton
strains on producers, and, last but not least, extracting labor from
peasants by force. Not only were roads, railways, and cotton gins built
by forced labor, but colonial authorities also asserted ever tighter
control over cotton production and the trade of raw cotton. Local
government officials supervised the planting of cotton, tried to make
sure that fields were regularly weeded, and secured a timely harvest. By
1911, for example, the German administration had created forty-seven
authorized buying stations throughout the cotton-growing areas to make
sure the sale of cotton occurred only under the watchful eyes of the
government; at times, soldiers took on the task of purchasing cotton. A
year later, in January 1912, the administration further ordered that
every ginning or mercantile company send only government-licensed
purchasers to markets. They also stipulated that sellers had to separate
good- and poor-quality cotton at all times. By 1914, rules as to how
cotton had to be treated were honed further and now included corporal
punishment for indigenous growers who violated them. As time went by,
force, violence, and coercion became ever more central to German
policy.71</p>
<p>Such emphasis on coercion increasingly brought conflicts between the
Tuskegee teachers and the German colonists. Most pointedly, Robinson
believed in the importance of growing subsistence crops along with
cotton. He advocated the joint development of cotton and food crops in
“harmonious ways,” and his teachings reflected Washington’s concern that
rural African Americans focused too much on the growing of cotton and
too little on providing their own subsistence. In fact Robinson brought
with him the memory of the defeated struggles of freedpeople in the
United States. In an exceptionally wide-ranging letter, Robinson opined
that “the source and life of all governments are its people, and the
first duty of the government is to maintain this life and source.
Consequently, the people are its first and Chief Concern. For that same
reason we wish to teach the people cotton culture, because it is good
for them, they will gain wealth thereby and the Colony grow richer.”
“But,” Robinson continued, “the people cannot live by Cotton alone.
Therefore we should begin now to teach them. Where they grow only maize
we will teach them to grow more maize and better maize, and also Cotton.
Where they grow now Yams and Cotton they must be shown how to grow
larger Yams and finer Cotton.” To effect such a slow transition,
Robinson believed, it was important not to coerce peasants and instead
to involve them with “as little excitement and inconvenience” as
possible. Robinson and his colleagues from Alabama, however, were
increasingly ignored by the German colonial administration.72</p>
<p>Throughout Africa, indeed, coercion became an ever more powerful
means of extracting cotton. In Côte d’Ivoire, peasants were forced to
grow cotton in specially designated fields under the supervision of
local colonial officials. In the Belgian Congo, by 1917 cotton
production was made a “culture obligatoire” in which peasants were
forced to grow certain amounts and to sell them at below market prices.
Those who did not produce sufficient quantities were penalized. If work
was not done according to expectations, severe punishments were meted
out, including whippings. In the French Soudan, peasants were similarly
forced to grow cotton. Peasants in Mozambique faced “sexual degradation
and beatings…by which the government agent compelled people to produce
cotton.” The regime of violence was so terrifying that as late as the
1970s, the word “cotton” still evoked, according to two historians, “an
almost automatic response: suffering.”73</p>
<p>Yet in Togo, all these efforts yielded minimal results. After the
peak year of 1909, Togo never produced more cotton while under German
rule. The experiences of other colonial powers in many other parts of
Africa were similar. Meanwhile, the German colonial authorities watched
with envy the great expansion of cotton production in Central Asia and
western India, where Russian and British colonialists had virtually
recast local social structures to make them conducive to cash-crop
production. To reorient an economy toward the world market in the
absence of clear-cut economic incentives, social relations in the
countryside had to be drastically recast—a process that usually took
either several decades, as in India, or severe violence, as in the
slavery-dominated societies of the American South, the West Indies, and
Brazil. To be sure, Africans adapted rapidly to a new set of incentives,
as (in a very different context) the pioneering efforts of Gold Coast
peasants in the 1890s and 1900s to produce cocoa for world markets
demonstrate. But in the absence of such incentives, the Germans in Togo
could not wait long enough, nor did they have the administrative,
economic, or military capacity to shorten the process. It was only
during the 1920s, when France got to govern much of the territory of
Togo, that world market production of cotton expanded
significantly—three times between 1913 and 1938. But, tellingly, cotton
production only truly took off after independence, and today Togo
exports 84 million pounds of cotton, or seventy-five times as much as
under German rule. Togo is still one of the world’s poorest
countries.74</p>
<p>Forced cotton cultivation by peasants in the Belgian Congo,
c. 1920</p>
<p>The venture of a small group of Tuskegee cotton experts in Togo
speaks to a story much larger than itself. The encounter between African
Americans one generation removed from slavery, German colonial
authorities, and Togolese rural cultivators illuminates a vast recasting
of the empire of cotton—and with it global capitalism—in the early
twentieth century. Imperial states had taken on unprecedented importance
in structuring global raw cotton markets: They secured huge swaths of
territory on which cotton could be grown and they used their accumulated
bureaucratic, infrastructural, and military might to mobilize
cotton-growing labor. And such commitments were only one facet of
policies that also included import duties, imperial preferences, and
powerful national industrial policies. Within the empire of cotton,
global networks had spread their geographic reach and intensified
significantly. States shaped these networks, demonstrating how state
formation and globalization were part and parcel of the same processes.
States captured territories, facilitated their infrastructural
incorporation, and mobilized workers to labor on this new land. Wherever
we look—in the colonial world, in Russia, in the United States—the
control of the cotton-growing countryside depended ever more on powerful
nation-states and empires.</p>
<p>To be sure, imperial powers competed with one another over the
control of territory, but in their search for ways to make potential
cotton-growing lands serve the interests of metropolitan industries,
people from all over the empire of cotton also tried to learn from each
other’s experiences. French, Japanese, and British cotton interests, for
example, observed the German activities in Togo closely; they sent
delegates to meet with John Robinson. J. Arthur Hutton, the chairman of
the British Cotton Growing Association, even saw German efforts in Togo
as a model for African cotton growing. The French government now
monitored cotton harvests globally and its consulate in Saint Petersburg
reported in great detail on developments in Central Asian cotton, as did
the German consulate. Though all these efforts were fundamentally about
isolating national industries from the vagaries of the world market,
they themselves formed part of a new global conversation on cotton.
Cotton manufacturers’ shared interests in the transformation of the
global countryside transcended national boundaries, resulting in the
formation of an incipient transnational bourgeoisie during the period
before World War I as manufacturers from a wide variety of countries met
not just to discuss how to make rural cultivators in Egypt, India, or
elsewhere grow more cotton, but also to take pleasure rides on the Nile
or dance in the concert halls of Vienna.75</p>
<p>The lessons learned from the imperial recasting of the global
cotton-growing countryside eventually spread, during the twentieth
century, to the most unlikely places: the Soviet Union, independent
India, and then to the People’s Republic of China. It was the Indian
Central Cotton Committee, largely under Indian control, that finally
succeeded in recasting Indian cotton agriculture to better suit the
needs of its mills in the 1920s and beyond. Just as tellingly, in 1923
the cotton experts of the German Colonial Economic Committee, with the
support of some of Germany’s major banks and cotton industrialists,
became involved in Soviet Central Asia’s cotton industry. After having
lost the German colonial empire, the object of their work, in World War
I they hoped to find yet another source of cotton for German industry,
while their Soviet partners eagerly read the publications that the
Germans had produced before the war on colonial cotton and hoped to make
use of German expertise. The orders that the Soviet cotton committee
received in 1923 from the Council of Work and Defense in Moscow were
almost identical to the many documents that colonial cotton bureaucrats
had produced in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere.76</p>
<p>The revolutionary vanguard II: Azerbaijan, Soviet cotton production,
1937 (illustration credit 12.7)</p>
<p>One of the effects of this new political economy of strengthened
imperial nation-states was the marginalization of areas once central to
regional or even global networks of exchange and power.77 Nation-states
everywhere now focused on their industrial cores and their attendant
political economies, leaving little if any space for the political
demands of the producers of agricultural commodities such as the
planters in the American South had enjoyed before 1865. After the
American Civil War, in fact, cotton growers throughout the world had
become politically and economically marginalized—a new global periphery
had emerged in which millions of farmers, sharecroppers, peasants, and
agricultural laborers toiled to keep up industrial capitalism’s
awe-inspiring advances, while themselves not sharing in them. The
particular ways in which regions, countries, and even entire continents
were integrated into this new industrial capitalism drastically
sharpened global inequalities and cemented them through much of the
twentieth century.</p>
<p>Yet despite the enormously more important role of nation-states and
empires—a direct result of the overcoming of war capitalism—the cotton
empire remained as global as ever. By 1910, for example, it included
Indian merchants selling Ugandan cotton to Japan. Former American slaves
advised German colonialists in Togo. An Indian from Madras, who had
apprenticed in a German textile mill, now directed a cotton plantation
in German East Africa. Texas farmers walked the Congolese countryside
along with Egyptian agricultural experts to advise their Belgian hosts
how to expand cotton production. Russian agricultural experts scouted
the Indian, Egyptian, and U.S. countryside to study irrigation schemes.
And Japanese agricultural bureaucrats carefully observed cotton
agriculture in German West Africa. By 1913, E. R. Bartley Denniss,
member of Parliament for the British cotton manufacturing town of
Oldham, had concluded, quite perceptively, that the question of cotton
supply had become “a world question. The cotton industry of the world is
one which makes nations dependent upon one another more than any other
industry that exists.”78</p>
<p>This new geography of global capitalism, so decisively constructed by
European and North American states and capitalists, ironically would
also bring to an end the more than one-hundred-year dominance of Europe
and North America, the twin hubs of the empire of cotton. As the vast
expansion of cotton agriculture fed the factories spreading throughout
the world, the number of spindles that dotted the global countryside
exploded. In 1865, 57 million spindles turned worldwide. By 1920 that
number had increased to 155 million.79 Yet increasingly, these spindles
and looms did not twist yarn and weave fabrics in the cities and
countryside of western Europe and the northern United States, but in
those of the global South.</p>
