Capitalism</h4>
<p>Capturing global cotton networks: the British East India Company
“factory” in Cossimbazar, West Bengal, c. 1795 (illustration credit
2.1)</p>
<p>Though impressive, the emergence of cotton production in
twelfth-century northern Italy, and later in fifteenth-century southern
Germany, did not seem world-altering. In each instance, boom was
followed by bust. And the larger cotton industry, already well
established on three continents, continued to hum along as it had for
centuries. World production still centered on India and China, and
intercontinental trade was still dominated by the products of Indian
weavers. No significant technological or organizational departures
characterized the European industry: Asian producers remained at the
cutting edge of textile technology. To be sure, Europe’s new
manufacturing endeavors produced an unprecedented quantity of cotton
cloth for that continent, spread a taste for cotton fabrics, and
established widespread knowledge about the principles of cotton
manufacturing—all factors that eventually became exceedingly important.
But for now those small shifts were irrelevant to the global cotton
industry, because Europeans lacked the ability to compete in
transoceanic markets, not least because the quality of their output was
much inferior to that of India. Unlike Indian or Chinese producers,
moreover, Europeans depended on the import of raw cotton from distant
regions of the world—regions over which they enjoyed little control. And
in 1600, most Europeans continued to clothe themselves in linens and
woolens.</p>
<p>Over the next two hundred years, however, all that was to change. The
change was slow, at first hardly perceptible, but the momentum built,
faster and faster and then exponentially. The ultimate result was a
radical reorganization of the world’s leading manufacturing industry: an
explosion in how and where cotton was grown and manufactured, and a
shocking vision of how the crop could yoke the world together. This
recasting of cotton did not at first derive from technical advances, nor
from organizational advantages, but instead from a far simpler source:
the ability and willingness to project capital and power across vast
oceans. With increasing frequency, Europeans inserted themselves, often
violently, into the global networks of the cotton trade—within Asia as
well as between Asia and the rest of the world—before using that same
power to create entirely novel networks between Africa, the Americas,
and Europe.1 Europe’s first incursion into the world of cotton had
collapsed in the face of superior power; new generations of European
capitalists and statesmen took heed and built a comparative advantage
with a willingness and ability to use force to extend their interests.
Europeans became important to the worlds of cotton not because of new
inventions or superior technologies, but because of their ability to
reshape and then dominate global cotton networks.</p>
<p>European capitalists and rulers altered global networks through
multiple means. The muscle of armed trade enabled the creation of a
complex, Eurocentric maritime trade web; the forging of a
military-fiscal state allowed for the projection of power into the
far-flung corners of the world; the invention of financial
instruments—from marine insurance to bills of lading—allowed for the
transfer of capital and goods over long distances; the development of a
legal system gave a modicum of security to global investments; the
construction of alliances with distant capitalists and rulers provided
access to local weavers and cotton growers; the expropriation of land
and the deportation of Africans created flourishing plantations.
Unbeknownst to contemporaries, these alterations were the first steps
toward the Industrial Revolution. Centuries before the “great
divergence” of per capita economic output between Europe and East Asia,
a small group of Europeans seized control of the heretofore episodic and
gradual process of forging global economic connections, with dramatic
consequences not only for the cotton industry but for human societies
across the globe. The “great divergence” was at first a divergence of
state power as well as a peculiar relationship between these states and
capital owners. In the process, the many worlds of cotton became a
European-centered empire of cotton.</p>
<p>Christopher Columbus’s landing in the Americas in 1492 marked the
first momentous event in this recasting of global connections. That
journey set off the world’s greatest land grab, with Hernán Cortés
attacking the Aztec Empire in 1518 and establishing vast territorial
claims for the Spaniards in America, spreading into South America and
also farther north. By the mid-sixteenth century, Portugal had followed
suit and acquired what is today Brazil. The French set out to the
Americas in 1605 and acquired Quebec; parts of the modern-day midwestern
and southern United States, which were grouped into a French
administrative unit called Louisiana; and a number of Caribbean islands,
including, in 1695, Saint-Domingue, the western third of Hispaniola.
England established its first successful American settlement in
Jamestown, which became a part of the colony of Virginia, in 1607, soon
to be expanded with further colonies in North America and also the
Caribbean. Eventually, as we will see, controlling huge territories in
the Americas allowed, among other things, the monocultural growing of
large quantities of cotton.</p>
<p>The second momentous event in the history of cotton came five years
later, in 1497, when Vasco da Gama sailed triumphantly into the port of
Calicut, having pioneered a sea route from Europe to India around the
Cape of Good Hope. Now Europeans could for the first time access the
products of Indian weavers—the world’s dominant producers—without having
to rely on the numerous middlemen who had transported Indian cloth by
ship across the Indian Ocean, by camel across Arabia, and then by boat
to European ports. Europeans began establishing formal trade relations
on the Indian subcontinent when da Gama obtained permission from local
rulers to trade in Calicut in 1498. By the early sixteenth century, the
Portuguese had established a series of trading outposts on India’s west
coast, most enduringly in Goa. At the end of the sixteenth century, the
Netherlands and Great Britain began to challenge Portugal’s monopoly on
trade with Asia by chartering joint-stock companies, hoping to catch a
share of the highly profitable spice trade. After a series of
Anglo-Dutch wars, the Dutch and the British agreed to divide their
spheres of interest in Asia, with the Indian textile trade falling
mostly into British hands.</p>
<p>That expansion into South Asia, at first, was the most momentous
intervention of European merchants and statesmen into the networks of
the global cotton industry. With it, Europeans began to play a role in
the transoceanic trade of Indian textiles, pioneered by the Portuguese,
who brought large quantities of such cloth to Europe. They also tried to
assert their dominance over the important trade between Gujarat and both
the Arabian Peninsula and eastern Africa—first by violently restricting
the access of Gujarati merchants to those traditional markets (with
mixed success), and in the second half of the sixteenth century by
regulating the trade. Other European merchants later joined in: In 1600,
merchants established the British East India Company, in 1602 the Dutch
Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, and in 1616 the Danish Dansk
Ostindiske Kompagni. By the early seventeenth century, the Dutch and
British were replacing the Portuguese in violently regulating the trade
in Gujarati textiles, seizing Gujarati ships, and limiting local
merchants’ access to the markets of Arabia and, increasingly, Southeast
Asia, which were supplied from factories in southern India, along the
Coromandel coast, with Madras at its center.2 France was the last of the
great European powers to launch trade with the East. In 1664, French
traders founded the Compagnie des Indes Française and brought the first
of what the French called indiennes—colorfully printed cotton cloth—into
France. These companies tried to assert monopoly rights in certain
areas, but facing each other as well as competing independent merchants,
their project never succeeded completely.3</p>
<p>What all these European trading companies had in common was that they
purchased cotton textiles in India, to trade for spices in Southeast
Asia, and also to bring to Europe, whence they might be consumed
domestically or shipped to Africa to pay for slaves to work the
plantations just beginning to take root in the New World. Cotton
textiles, for the first time ever, became entangled in a
three-continent-spanning trading system; the consequences of Columbus’s
and da Gama’s momentous journeys fed on one another. European consumers
and African traders hungered for the beautiful chintzes, muslins, and
calicoes, or the simpler but useful plain cloths, spun and woven by
South Asian householders and artisans.</p>
<p>As a result, cotton textiles became central to European expansion
into Asia. Already by the early seventeenth century, European traders
and merchants played an important role in the trade at the Bengali port
of Dhaka, which for centuries had been the source of some of the world’s
highest-quality cottons. The East India Company as early as 1621
imported an estimated fifty thousand pieces of cotton goods into
Britain. Forty years later, this number had increased by a factor of
five. Cotton cloths, in fact, became the company’s most important
trading good; by 1766 that cloth constituted more than 75 percent of the
East India Company’s total exports. As a result, according to English
writer Daniel Defoe—no friend of the imports—cotton “crept into our
Houses, our Closets and Bed Chambers, Curtains, Cushions, Chairs, and at
last Beds themselves were nothing but Calicoes or Indian stuffs.”4</p>
<p>Armed European merchants inserted themselves successfully into the
transoceanic trade of Indian cotton textiles. In India itself, however,
European power was limited. It basically found its end at the outskirts
of port cities, or the walls of the forts that these soldier-traders
increasingly constructed along the coast. To secure the very large
quantities of Indian textiles they exported, European merchants depended
on local traders, banias, who guarded their crucial relationships with
the inland farmers and weavers who grew, spun, and wove these
increasingly valuable goods. Europeans set up warehouses—so-called
factories—along the coast of India, in cities such as Madras, Surat,
Dhaka, Cossimbazar, and Calicut, where their agents placed orders with
banias for cloth and received the wares ready for shipment. Hundreds of
leather-bound books, many of which are still extant, recorded each one
of these transactions.5</p>
<p>In 1676, the factory of the British East India Company in Dhaka
detailed the mechanisms through which cloth was purchased, testifying to
its dependence on indigenous traders. The English merchants
subcontracted the task of securing cloth to a number of banias eight to
ten months before the trading ships arrived, specifying the qualities,
designs, prices, and delivery dates they desired. African and European
consumers of cotton textiles demanded very particular goods at
particular prices. Banias then advanced cash to various middlemen, who
would travel from village to village to advance funds and contract for
finished cloth with individual weavers.6 Eventually the cloth traveled
the same chain back to the English factory in Dhaka, where merchants
graded and prepared it for shipment.</p>
<p>In this system of production, the weavers themselves had control over
the rhythm and organization of their work, owned their tools, just as
they had for centuries, and even retained the right to sell their
products to whomever they pleased. As European demand grew, weavers were
able to increase production and raise prices, which was clearly
beneficial to them. In fact, the arrival of European traders in the
Gujarati town of Broach, just as much as in Orissa and Dhaka, gave a new
impetus to the regional cotton industry. Weavers were still poor, yet
they could take advantage of competition for their cloth, as did
indigenous banias and even Indian rulers, who quickly established taxes
and duties on the production and export of cotton cloth.7 The power of
European merchants in India was hence significant, but far from
all-encompassing: The English complained that the system was frequently
disrupted by “Arabians and Moguls who trade in Dacca cloth carrying
yearly very considerable quantities of the same overland some so far as
the great Turks Dominions,” as well as by the “contest, trouble and
Charge” of the weavers and local banias.8</p>
<p>This “factory” system, with its continuing dependence on local
traders and local capital, persisted for roughly two centuries. As late
as 1800, the British East India Company agreed to purchase piece goods
from Pestonjee Jemsatjee and Sorabje Jevangee, two merchants in Bombay,
for more than 1 million rupees, while the Surat bania Dadabo Monackjee
entered into contracts with weavers north of the city to deliver cloth
for the British. Indeed, at first, Portuguese, English, Dutch, and
French traders were merely the latest arrivals to an old and vibrant
market, taking their place alongside hundreds of merchants from all over
South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. In Dhaka, as late as the 1700s,
European traders acquired only about one-third of all the cloth traded.
And the trading capacity of Europeans in India remained dependent on
South Asian bankers and merchants who financed cotton growing and
manufacturing.9</p>
<p>The insertion of armed European merchants into the Asian trade,
however, slowly marginalized these older networks, as they muscled the
once dominant Indian and Arab traders out of many intercontinental
markets. In 1670, one British observer could still note that Middle
Eastern merchants “carried off five times as many calicoes as the
English and the Dutch.” Yet with bigger, faster, and more reliable
boats, and more damaging firepower, “the old pattern of the
Indian-Levant trade as the principal artery for world exchange underwent
a complete structural change,” one historian concludes, with “the
Ottoman Empire…the chief loser.” Gujarati merchants trading with East
Africa also began facing European competition. Just as European
merchants became increasingly common in India, they also established
themselves in the East African markets; as a result, on both sides of
the Indian Ocean, Europe’s dominance grew. With the eighteenth-century
decline of Surat and the rise of British Bombay, merchants in western
India became even more dependent on British power.10</p>
<p>The growing influence of European merchants and their sponsoring
states in India eventually began to have important repercussions in
Europe itself. As much larger quantities of Indian cottons traveled to
Europe, new markets and fashions emerged. Beautiful chintzes and muslins
attracted the attention of the growing class of Europeans who had the
money to purchase them and the desire to flaunt their social status by
wearing them. As Indian cottons became ever more fashionable in the
eighteenth century, the desire to replace these imports was a powerful
incentive to ramping up cotton production in England and eventually to
revolutionize it.11</p>
<p>Moreover, domination in Asia dovetailed with expansion into the
Americas. As Spanish, Portuguese, French, English, and Dutch powers
captured huge territories in the Americas, they took away the
continent’s movable wealth: gold and silver. It was indeed some of these
stolen precious metals that had funded the purchase of cotton fabrics in
India in the first place.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, European settlers in the Americas could not
discover sufficient gold and silver and they invented a new road to
wealth: plantations growing tropical and semitropical crops, sugar in
particular, but also rice, tobacco, and indigo. Such plantations needed
large numbers of workers, and to secure these workers, Europeans
deported at first thousands and then millions of Africans to the
Americas. European merchants built fortified trading stations along the
western coast of Africa—Goree in present-day Senegal, Elmina in
present-day Ghana, Ouidah in present-day Benin. They paid African rulers
to go on a hunt for labor, exchanging captives for the products of
Indian weavers. In the three centuries after 1500, more than 8 million
slaves were transported from Africa to the Americas, first mostly by
Spanish and Portuguese traders, to be joined in the seventeenth century
by the British, French, Dutch, Danish, and others. During the eighteenth
century alone, they deported more than 5 million people, mostly from
west-central Africa, the Bight of Benin, the Gold Coast, and the Bight
of Biafra.12 Slaves arrived almost daily on Caribbean islands, as well
as along the coasts of both Americas.</p>
<p>Such trade increased the demand for cotton fabrics, since African
rulers and merchants almost always demanded cotton cloth in exchange for
slaves. Although it is often imagined that the slave trade was animated
by simple exchanges of guns and gewgaws for human export, slaves were
more frequently traded for a far more banal commodity: cotton textiles.
One study of 1,308 barters of British merchant Richard Miles between
1772 and 1780 for 2,218 Gold Coast slaves found that textiles
constituted over half of the value of all traded goods. Portuguese
imports to Luanda in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
tell a similar story: Woven goods constituted nearly 60 percent of
imports.13</p>
<p>African consumers became notorious for their discerning and dynamic
tastes, much to the consternation of European merchants. Indeed, one
European traveler observed that African consumer tastes were “most
varied and capricious,” and that “scarcely two villages concur in their
canons of taste.” When the slave ship Diligent sailed from its French
port in 1731, it carried in its hold a careful assortment of Indian
textiles to cater to the particular demands at the Guinea coast. In the
same way, Richard Miles sent very specific instructions on what colors
and types of textiles were currently in demand on the Gold Coast to his
British suppliers, down to the very manufacturers that should be
utilized. “Mr Kershaw’s [manufactures] are by no means equal to
[Knipe’s],” he told a British contact in one 1779 letter, “at least not
in the eyes of the Black traders here, andandandand it is them that are
to be pleased.”14</p>
<p>European trade in cotton textiles tied together Asia, the Americas,
Africa, and Europe in a complex commercial web. Never before in the four
millennia of the history of cotton had such a globe-spanning system been
invented. Never before had the products of Indian weavers paid for
slaves in Africa to work on the plantations in the Americas to produce
agricultural commodities for European consumers. This was an
awe-inspiring system, speaking clearly to the transformative powers of a
union of capital and state power. What was the most radical was not the
particulars of these trades, but the system in which they were embedded
and how different parts of the system fed upon one another: Europeans
had invented a new way of organizing economic activity.</p>
<p>This expansion of European trade networks into Asia, Africa, and the
Americas did not rest primarily on offering superior goods at good
prices, but on the military subjugation of competitors and a coercive
European mercantile presence in many regions of the world. Depending on
the relative balance of social power in particular places, there were
variations on this central theme. In Asia and Africa, Europeans settled
coastal enclaves and dominated transoceanic commerce, without at first
much involvement in cultivation and manufacturing. In other parts of the
world, most prominently the Americas, local populations were
expropriated and often displaced or killed. Europeans invented the world
anew by embarking upon plantation agriculture on a massive scale. Once
Europeans became involved in production, they fastened their economic
fortunes to slavery. These three moves—imperial expansion,
expropriation, and slavery—became central to the forging of a new global
economic order and eventually the emergence of capitalism.</p>
<p>They combined with one other feature of this new world: states that
backed these merchant and settler ventures, but that only weakly
asserted their sovereignty over the places and peoples in distant
territories. Instead, private capitalists, often organized in chartered
companies (such as the British East India Company) asserted sovereignty
over land and people, and structured connections to local rulers.
Heavily armed privateering capitalists became the symbol of this new
world of European domination, as their cannon-filled boats and their
soldier-traders, armed private militias, and settlers captured land and
labor and blew competitors, quite literally, out of the water.
Privatized violence was one of their core competencies. While European
states had envisioned, encouraged, and enabled the creation of vast
colonial empires, they remained weak and thin on the ground, providing
private actors the space and leeway to forge new modes of trade and
production. Not secure property rights but a wave of expropriation of
labor and land characterized this moment, testifying to capitalism’s
illiberal origins.</p>
<p>The beating heart of this new system was slavery. The deportation of
many millions of Africans to the Americas intensified connections to
India because it increased pressure to secure more cotton cloth. It was
that trade that established a more significant European mercantile
presence in Africa. And it was that trade that made it possible to give
economic value to the vast territories captured in the Americas, and
thus to overcome Europe’s own resource constraints. This multifaceted
system certainly showed variation and changed over time, but it was
sufficiently different from the world that came before and the world
that would emerge from it in the nineteenth century that it deserves its
own name: war capitalism.</p>
<p>War capitalism relied on the capacity of rich and powerful Europeans
to divide the world into an “inside” and an “outside.” The “inside”
encompassed the laws, institutions, and customs of the mother country,
where state-enforced order ruled. The “outside,” by contrast, was
characterized by imperial domination, the expropriation of vast
territories, decimation of indigenous peoples, theft of their resources,
enslavement, and the domination of vast tracts of land by private
capitalists with little effective oversight by distant European states.
In these imperial dependencies, the rules of the inside did not apply.
There, masters trumped states, violence defied the law, and bold
physical coercion by private actors remade markets. While, as Adam Smith
argued, such territories advanced “more rapidly to wealth and greatness
than any other human society,” they did so via a social tabula rasa,
which, perhaps ironically, provided the foundation for the emergence of
very different societies and states on war capitalism’s “inside.”15</p>
<p>War capitalism had an unprecedented transformative potential. At the
root of the emergence of the modern world of sustained economic growth,
it created unfathomable suffering, but also a consequential
transformation of the organization of economic space: A multipolar world
increasingly became unipolar. Power long spread across multiple
continents and through numerous networks increasingly became centralized
through a single node, dominated by European capitalists and European
states. At the core of this change stood cotton, as the multiple and
diverse worlds of the production and distribution of this commodity
increasingly lost ground to a hierarchical empire organized on a global
scale.</p>
<p>Within Europe itself, this reorganization of economic space had
continent-wide repercussions. “Atlantic” powers such as the Netherlands,
Great Britain, and France replaced the erstwhile economic powerhouses
such as Venice and its northern Italian hinterland. As Atlantic trade
superseded Mediterranean trade and as the New World became an important
producer of raw materials, cities with links to the Atlantic also rose
in prominence in the manufacturing of cotton textiles. Indeed, as early
as the sixteenth century, expanded cotton manufacturing in Europe was
contingent on a link to the rapidly expanding markets throughout the
Atlantic world—from the cloth markets in Africa to the newly emerging
sources of raw cotton in the Americas. In Flemish cities such as Bruges
(starting in 1513) and Leiden (starting in 1574), cotton manufacturing
burgeoned, as Antwerp began to carry a significant trade in raw cotton
and overseas expansion that gave access to huge new markets. French
manufacturers, for identical reasons, also embarked upon new cotton
spinning and weaving ventures in the late sixteenth century.16</p>
<p>Amid these seismic geographic shifts, the most significant in the
long run was cotton manufacturing’s arrival in England. By 1600, Flemish
religious refugees began weaving cotton cloth in English towns. The
earliest reference to cotton dates to 1601, “when the name of George
Arnould, fustian weaver of Bolton, appears in the records of quarter
sessions.” The industry grew, and by 1620 British cotton manufacturers
exported their wares to France, Spain, Holland, and Germany. Cotton
manufacturing thrived especially in the northern English county of
Lancashire, where both the lack of guild control and the proximity to
Liverpool, an important slaving port, became key to producers who
supplied the African trade in slaves and plantations in the
Americas.17</p>
<p>This slowly emerging English cotton industry drew on earlier
experiences with the production of linen and woolens. As on the
continent, cottons were at first manufactured in the countryside.
Merchants, many of them Puritans and other dissenters, advanced raw
cotton to peasants, who employed family labor seasonally to spin and
weave, before returning the cloth to the merchants who sold it. As
cotton cloth demand exploded, spinning and weaving became ever more
important to smallholding peasants, and some of them eventually gave up
their traditional crops and became entirely dependent on the industry.
Some of the merchants who organized domestic cotton production turned
into substantial businessmen. As they accumulated capital, they expanded
production by providing ever more credit to ever more spinners and
weavers, encouraging an “extensification” of production—its geographic
dispersal throughout ever larger areas of the countryside. This was the
classic putting-out system, quite similar to its incarnations across
Asia centuries earlier, or to the British woolens industry. The
countryside became ever more industrial and its inhabitants ever more
dependent on putting-out work for distant merchants.18</p>
<p>Unlike Indian cotton spinners and weavers, the growing class of
English cotton workers had no independent access to raw materials or to
markets. They were entirely subordinated to the merchants—indeed, they
enjoyed less independence and power than their Indian counterparts.19
British putting-out merchants, as a result, had far more power than
Indian banias. The British cotton men were part of a rising global power
whose navy increasingly dominated the world’s oceans, whose territorial
possessions in the Americas and in Asia—India foremost among them—grew
rapidly, and whose slavers created a plantation complex that rested in
various ways on the manufacturing capacity of spinners and weavers
thousands of miles away in the remote uplands of Lancashire and the
plains of Bengal.</p>
<p>Despite these beginnings, their significance emerged only in
retrospect. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
Europe’s cotton industry was not particularly prominent. In England, but
also elsewhere in Europe, the “manufacture of cotton remained almost
stationary.” Even after 1697, it grew only slowly; for example, it took
sixty-seven years for the amount of raw cotton worked up into thread and
cloth to approximately double, to 3.87 million pounds. That was the
amount of cotton used in an entire year. By 1858, in contrast, the
United States would export this amount of cotton on average on a single
day. France was similar, and, outside Britain and France, European
cotton demand was even less significant.20</p>
<p>One reason for the relatively slow growth of European cotton
manufacturing was the difficulty of accessing raw cotton. As cotton was
not grown in Europe itself, the industry’s essential raw material had to
be brought from distant locations. The modest demand for raw cotton
among European manufacturers of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, before the heyday of the new machines that would by 1780
revolutionize cotton manufacturing, was largely met through established
and diversified trade channels, in which cotton remained one commodity
among many. In 1753, twenty-six ships arrived in the port of Liverpool
from Jamaica with cotton, of which twenty-four had less than fifty bags
of the fiber on board.21 There were neither merchants nor ports nor
regions of the world that specialized in cotton production for
export.</p>
<p>Since the twelfth century the most important source of cotton imports
to Europe, as we have seen, was the Ottoman Empire, especially western
Anatolia and Macedonia. Throughout the seventeenth century, cotton from
Izmir and Thessaloniki (Ottoman Salonica) continued to dominate local
markets, arriving in London and Marseille alongside other products of
the East, such as silk and mohair yarn. As European demand for raw
cotton slowly expanded in the eighteenth century, Ottoman cotton still
filled a significant share: one-quarter of all British imports between
1700 and 1745, and a similar quantity shipped to Marseille.22</p>
<p>Small quantities of raw cotton also arrived from other regions of the
world, such as the Indian cotton that found its way to London in the
1690s, courtesy of the East India Company. Similarly, in the 1720s, the
Royal African Company reported selling “At Their House in
Leaden-Hall-Street by the Candle, on Thursday the 12th Day of September
1723, at Ten of the Clock in the Forenoon…. Cotton from Gambia.” A year
later, they offered “Casks of Fine Silk Cotton…from Whyday,” and the
subsequent year “Bags of Guinea Cotton.” But such minor sales paled in
comparison to these merchants’ more important trade items like elephant
tusks.23</p>
<p>More important, however, was a new source of cotton: the West Indies.
Though cotton remained a marginal crop compared to sugar on these
islands, a number of small farmers, with fewer resources to invest than
the sugar lords, did grow the “white gold.” The production of these
petits blancs, as they were called on the French islands, remained
rather static until 1760. Yet for the British and French cotton
industries, even this small amount of West Indian cotton supplied a
significant share of their needs. And more important, as we will see,
its way of production pointed to the future.24</p>
<p>Before 1770, therefore, European merchants secured the valuable fiber
through well-established trade networks from a wide variety of
locations. With the exception of the West Indies, their influence did
not go much beyond the port cities themselves, as they had neither the
power to tinker with how cotton was cultivated in the hinterland nor the
inclination to advance capital for additional cotton growing. Cotton
came to them thanks to the prices they were willing to pay, but they had
no influence on how the cotton came into being. Local growers and
merchants remained powerful actors within this global raw cotton nexus,
not least because they neither specialized in cotton production for
export nor in northern European markets.25</p>
<p>Cotton imports into the UK, 1702–1780, by source, in millions of
pounds, five-year trailing averages (illustration credit 2.2)</p>
<p>As small quantities of raw cotton came to Europe to feed the
expanding but in global terms still puny European cotton industry,
demand for cotton cloth grew in Europe, as well as in Africa and on the
slave plantations of the Americas. Yet European production was
insufficient to meet it. In response, English, French, Dutch, Danish,
and Portuguese traders, all with a similar feverish energy, tried to
secure greater quantities of cotton textiles in India under ever more
favorable conditions. While in 1614 British merchants had exported
12,500 untailored pieces of cotton cloth, between 1699 and 1701 that
number spiked to 877,789 pieces annually. Exports of cloth by the
British had increased by a factor of seventy in less than a hundred
years.26</p>
<p>To obtain these fabulous quantities of textiles from India at
favorable prices, representatives for the European East India companies
began to insert themselves even more into the production process within
India itself. For decades, representatives of the chartered European
East India companies had complained about the ability of Indian weavers
to sell their goods to competing European companies, competing Indian
banias, traders from other regions of the world, or even to private
European merchants who operated independently of the companies, creating
competition that raised prices. Profitability could be increased only if
Europeans could force weavers to work for their respective company
alone. Monopolizing the market became the way to drive down weavers’
incomes and drive up the selling price of particular goods.27</p>
<p>European traders were helped in securing cotton cloth in the quantity
and quality they needed, and at the price they desired, because their
business practices were reinforced with political control of
increasingly extensive Indian territories. They came not just as
traders, but increasingly as rulers. By the 1730s, the Dhaka factory,
for example, hosted a contingent of military personnel and arms to
protect the company’s interests. Most dramatically, by 1765 the British
East India Company—a group of merchants—ruled Bengal, and in the decades
thereafter expanded its control over other South Asian territories. Such
territorial dreams were furthered by British merchants’ increasing
investment in the raw cotton trade between India and China by the late
eighteenth century, which made them hope for the integration of western
Indian cotton tracts into East India Company territories as well. This
assertion of private political power by a state-chartered company over
distant territories was a revolutionary reconceptualization of economic
might. States shared sovereignty over territory and people with private
entrepreneurs.28</p>
<p>Among many other things, this new combination of economic and
political power enabled European merchants to gain greater control over
textile manufacturing, especially by increasing control over weavers.29
Along the Coromandel coast the influential Indian merchants who acted as
brokers between Indian weavers and European exporters increasingly were
replaced by agents who were under much greater control of the European
companies already in the seventeenth century. In Surat, which, like
Bengal, would fall under company rule in 1765, the Board of Trade of the
governor-general expressed in 1795 its dissatisfaction with</p>
<p>the system in practice hitherto of having a Contractor who has not
himself any immediate connection with the manufacturers or weavers, but
engages in subordinate contracts with a large number of the Native
Merchants of little property or probity and though bound in
responsibility, are not competent to pay a penalty if forfeited, and
that in fact the goods never came into their possession, and apprehend
that the difficulties now existing, will not be removed but with its
abolition or very material alteration.30</p>
<p>Removing the Indian middlemen promised the foreign merchants better
control over production and the ability to secure a greater quantity of
piece goods. To that end, the East India Company tried to bypass the
independent Indian banias who had historically connected them to the
weavers by giving that responsibility to Indian “agents” whom they put
on their own payroll. The Board of Trade in London instructed the
governor-general in great detail how to recast the system of purchasing
cotton cloth, hoping thereby to “recover to the Company that genuine
knowledge of the business,” and thus acquire more cloth at cheaper
prices by implementing the “grand Fundamental principle of the Agency
System.” Through its Indian agents the company now made direct advances
to weavers, something the British had not done in earlier years, which
was greatly aided by territorial control and the attendant political
authority. While weavers had always depended on credit, the novel
insertion of Europeans into these credit networks along with the efforts
of European merchants to monopolize economic control of particular parts
of India made them ever more dependent on the company. Already by the
middle of the eighteenth century, European companies sent these agents
deep into the manufacturing centers in the countryside near Dhaka,
agents who increasingly set the terms of production and thus succeeded
in lowering prices. In the 1790s the East India Company even encouraged
weavers to relocate to Bombay and produce cloth there—all with the goal
of being able to supervise them better “without being extorted by the
Servants of the Rajah of Travancore.”31</p>
<p>The encroachment of British power on the subcontinent meant that
weavers increasingly lost their ability to set prices for cloth.
According to the historian Sinnappah Arasaratnam “they could not produce
for any customer they chose; they had to accept part of their payment in
cotton yarn; they were subject to a strict supervision of the process of
manufacture by the Company’s servants who were located in the village.”
Weavers were now often compelled to take advances from particular
merchants. The ultimate aim, never fully realized, was to make weavers
into wage workers—along the lines of what contemporary merchants
succeeded in implementing in the English countryside itself.32</p>
<p>To further their goal, the company now also employed its coercive
powers toward the weavers directly. The company hired large numbers of
Indians to supervise and implement new rules and regulations, in effect
bureaucratizing the cloth market. Extensive new regulations attached
weavers legally to the company, making them unable to sell their cloth
on the open market. Company agents now inspected cloth on the loom, and
endeavored to ensure that the cloth was, as promised, sold to the
company. A new system of taxation penalized those weavers who produced
for others.33</p>
<p>The company also increasingly resorted to violence, including
corporal punishment. When a company agent complained that a weaver was
working illegally for a private merchant, “the Company’s Gumashta seized
him and his son, flogged him severely, painted his face black and white,
tied his hands behind his back and marched him through the town escorted
by seapoys [sic] [Indian soldiers in the employ of the English],
announcing ‘any weaver found working for private merchants should
receive similar punishment.’ ” Such policies produced their intended
results: Indian weavers’ income fell. In the late seventeenth century,
up to one-third of the price of cloth might have gone to a weaver. By
the late eighteenth century, according to historian Om Prakash, the
producer’s share had fallen to about 6 percent. As income and living
standards declined, a lullaby sung by Saliya weavers spoke longingly of
a mystical time when their looms contained a silver plank. By 1795, the
company itself observed an “unprecedented mortality among the
Weavers.”34</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, weavers resisted the coercive encroachment of
European capital in the production process. Some packed up and moved
away from territories controlled by Europeans. Others secretly produced
for competitors, but the need to avoid detection made them vulnerable to
pressures for lower prices. At times, groups of weavers collectively
approached the East India Company to complain about the company’s
interference with free trade.35</p>
<p>Such resistance sometimes reduced the power of European capitalists.
Thus despite its wish to eliminate Indian middlemen, the East India
Company understood that “it is impossible to do without the subordinate
Contractors,” whose much denser social networks into weaving villages
could never be completely replaced by company agents. The interests of
independent European merchants also often worked against the company, as
they offered weavers more money for cloth, thus giving weavers an
incentive to undermine company policies.36</p>
<p>Despite such constraints, aggressive policies succeeded in getting
ever more cotton cloth into the stores of European traders. European
cloth exports from India amounted to an estimated 30 million yards in
1727, but increased to some 80 million yards annually by the 1790s.
British merchants in particular, but also their French counterparts,
controlled the acquisition and export of huge quantities of cottons
woven for export: In 1776, the district of Dhaka alone counted roughly
eighty thousand spinners and twenty-five thousand weavers, while in 1795
the East India Company estimated that the city of Surat alone contained
over fifteen thousand looms. And there was pressure for more. A 1765
dispatch from the East India Company office in London to its
counterparts in Bombay, reflecting on the possibilities of the peace
following the Seven Years War, beautifully summarizes what was at the
core of the revolutionary reconceptualization of the global
economy.37</p>
<p>Since the Peace the Slaving Trade to the Coast of Africa has greatly
encreased, in course the Demand for Goods proper for that Market is very
large; andandandand as We are very desirous of contributing so far as
lyes in Our Powers to the Encouragement of a Trade on which the
well-being of the British plantations in the West Indies so much
depends, andandandand considering the same therefore in a National View,
We expect andandandand positively direct that you conform as near as
possible can, not only to the Provision in general of the several
Articles ordered in the abovementioned List of Investment [i.e., cloth],
but those marked A which are more immediately for that Trade.38</p>
<p>As this message makes clear, cotton from India, slaves from Africa,
and sugar from the Caribbean moved across the planet in a complex
commercial dance. The huge demand for slaves in the Americas created
pressure to secure more cotton cloth from India. Not surprisingly,
Francis Baring of the East India Company concluded in 1793 that from
Bengal an “astonishing Mass of Wealth has flowed…into the Lap of Great
Britain.”39</p>
<p>European merchants’ increasing control over the production process in
India would seem to threaten Europe’s own not particularly important or
dynamic infant cotton industry. How could the English, French, Dutch,
and other producers possibly compete against India’s fabrics, which were
both superior in quality and cheaper? And yet it appears that the
European industry expanded even as India exported more cloth.
Ironically, imports from India helped the European cotton textile
industry by creating new markets for cotton fabrics and by continuing
Europe’s appropriation of relevant technologies from Asia. In the long
run, moreover, imports from India influenced Europe’s political
priorities. As we will see, Great Britain, France, and others emerged as
newly powerful states, with a vocal group of capitalists; for states and
individuals alike, replacing Indian cotton cloth imports with
domestically manufactured cloth became an important, albeit
difficult-to-realize priority.</p>
<p>Protectionism played a key role in this process, testifying again to
the enormous importance of the state to the “great divergence.” By the
late seventeenth century, with both cotton imports and domestic cotton
manufacturing expanding, Europe’s woolen and linen manufacturers
pressured their respective governments to protect them from upstart
cotton manufacturers in general and Indian imports in particular.
Textiles were Europe’s most important manufacturing industry:
Dislocation of the sector by cotton imports and manufacturing seemed to
endanger profits and threaten social stability.40</p>
<p>As early as 1621, only a little more than two decades after the
creation of the East India Company, London wool merchants protested
against the growing importation of cotton cloth. Two years later, in
1623, Parliament debated Indian textile imports, calling them “injurious
to the national interests.” Indeed, agitation against cotton imports
became a constant feature of the English political landscape in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A 1678 pamphlet, “The Ancient
Trades Decayed and Repaired Again,” warned that the woolen trade was
“very much hindered by our own people, who do wear many foreign
commodities instead of our own.” In 1708, Defoe’s Review printed a
bitter editorial that looked “into the real Decay of our Manufactures,”
ascribing the decline to the import of ever increasing quantities of
“Chints and painted Callicoes” by the East India Company. The result was
that “the Bread taken out of [the people’s] Mouths, and the East-India
Trade carry away the whole Employment of their People.” Usually it was
woolen and linen manufacturers who agitated against Indian imports, but
sometimes cotton manufacturers chimed in as well: In 1779, calico
printers, fearful that the East India Company would ruin their business,
wrote to the Treasury that “if there is not a Prohibition put to the
East India Company’s going on with their printing Manufactory in the
East Indies a great many more must also leave off this Branch of
Business.”41</p>
<p>Such agitation led to protectionist measures. In 1685, England
imposed a 10 percent duty on “all calicoes and other Indian linen and
all wrought silks which are manufactures of India.” In 1690, the tariff
was doubled. In 1701, Parliament outlawed the import of printed cottons,
leading to the importation of plain calicoes for further processing in
England, giving a huge boost to British calico printing. A 1721 law went
so far as to ban people from wearing printed calicoes if the white
calicoes themselves originated from India, a measure that gave an
impetus to calico fabrication in Britain. Selling Indian cottons was
eventually criminalized altogether: In 1772 Robert Gardiner of London
rented an apartment to one W. Blair, who “brought illegal goods into his
house,” namely Indian muslins. He was sent to jail. In 1774, Parliament
decreed that cotton cloth for sale in England had to be made exclusively
of cotton spun and woven in England. Only goods destined for reexport
were permitted from the East Indies. The Indian cotton goods not subject
to these bans, such as plain chintz and muslins, were subject to heavy
tariffs. In the end, all of these protectionist measures did not help
the domestic woolen and linen industry, but did spur domestic cotton
manufacture.42</p>
<p>Like Britain, France took pains to outlaw the import of Indian
cottons. In 1686, in response to pressure from silk and wool
industrialists, it outlawed the manufacture, use, and sale of cottons.
Over the next seventy years, no fewer than two royal edicts and eighty
rulings of the king’s council attempted to repress cottons. Penalties
were made ever more severe, with imprisonment and, starting in 1726,
even the death penalty awaiting offenders. In 1755, France again
outlawed the import of Indian printed textiles for consumption in
France, and in 1785 the king reconfirmed the prohibitions in order to
protect a “national industry.” Twenty thousand guards worked on
enforcing these laws, sending as many as 50,000 violators to forced
labor on French galleys. Explicitly excluded from the long list of
prohibited Indian textiles, however, were those destined for Guinée,
that is, textiles used in the slave trade. Slaves, after all, could only
be gotten by exchanging them for the cottons from India.43</p>
<p>Other European countries followed suit: Venice disallowed the import
of Indian cottons in 1700, as did Flanders. In Prussia, a 1721 edict of
King Friedrich Wilhelm outlawed the wearing of printed or painted chintz
and cottons. Spain outlawed the import of Indian textiles in 1717. And
in the late eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire under Sultan
Abdulhamid I prohibited subjects from wearing certain Indian
cloths.44</p>
<p>What began as a policy to protect domestic wool, linen, and silk
makers evolved toward an explicit program of encouraging the domestic
production of cotton textiles. “The prohibition that the industrial
nations imposed on printed textiles in order to encourage their own
national production,” the French traveler François-Xavier Legoux de
Flaix argued in 1807, provided European manufacturers who could not yet
freely compete with Indian weavers with a sense of how promising the
market for cottons would be. Domestic as well as export markets were
potentially huge and extremely elastic. And just as protectionist
measures limited access to European textile markets for Indian
producers, European states and merchants increasingly dominated global
networks that allowed them to capture markets for cotton textiles in
other parts of the world. These markets, in fact, provided an outlet for
cottons secured in India as well as for domestic producers. Thus
Europeans could both increase cloth purchases in India and protect their
own uncompetitive national industries—a miraculous feat possible only
because war capitalism had allowed Europeans to dominate global cotton
networks while at the same time constructing new kinds of ever more
powerful states whose constant warfare demanded ever greater resources
and thus embraced domestic industry.45</p>
<p>Imperial expansion and the increasing dominance of Europeans in the
global cotton trade allowed, furthermore, for an increasing transfer of
Asian knowledge to Europe. Manufacturers in Europe felt more and more
pressure to appropriate these technologies in order to compete both on
price and on quality with Indian producers. Europe’s movement toward
manufacturing cotton textiles was based, in fact, on what might be
considered one of history’s most dramatic instances of industrial
espionage.</p>
<p>One reason that Indian textiles were so popular among European and
African consumers was their superior design and brilliant colors. In
order to match the fabulous qualities of their Indian competitors,
European manufacturers, supported by their various national governments,
collected and shared knowledge about Indian production techniques.
French cotton manufacturers, for example, devoted great effort to
copying Indian techniques by closely observing Indian ways of
manufacturing. In 1678, Georges Roques, who worked for the French East
India Company, wrote what quickly became an invaluable report on Indian
woodblock printing techniques, based on his observations in Ahmedabad.
Forty years later, in 1718, Le Père Turpin followed suit, and in 1731
Georges de Beaulieu, the second lieutenant on a French East India
Company ship, reached Pondicherry to investigate how Indian artisans
produced chintz. As a result of these and other efforts, by 1743 French
manufacturers were capable of copying all but the very finest Indian
textiles. Yet despite this rapid appropriation of Indian techniques,
even in the late eighteenth century cloth from the subcontinent still
defined quality. Legoux de Flaix admired in 1807 the qualities of Indian
yarn and cloth (“a degree of perfection far beyond what we are familiar
with in Europe”) and once again reported in minute detail on Indian
manufacturing techniques, in the hopes of enabling French artisans to
copy them: “All the weaving combs in France should be made according to
the model used in Bengal,” he advised, among other things. “Then we will
succeed in equaling the Indians in the manufacture of their
muslin.”46</p>
<p>Other European manufacturers followed suit. In the late eighteenth
century, Danish travelers ventured to India to understand and
appropriate Indian technology. And throughout the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, English cotton printers collected and then copied
Indian designs using Indian cotton printing expertise. Publications such
as the “Account of the Manufactures carried on at Bangalore, and the
Processes employed by the Natives in Dyeing Silk and Cotton,” or the
similarly oriented “The Genuine Oriental Process for giving to Cotton
Yarn, or Stuffs, the fast or ingrained Colour, known by the Name of
Turkey or Adrianople-Red,” exemplified a persistent interest in
technology transfer. Just as was the case with the spinning wheel and
the horizontal treadle loom in the centuries prior, Asia from the
sixteenth through the eighteenth century remained the most important
source of cotton manufacturing and, especially, printing technology. As
European domination of the global networks of cotton quickened, so too
did the pace of European assimilation of Indian technology.47</p>
<p>Replacing Indian cotton cloth with domestic production, both for
export markets and for local consumption, became a goal to aspire to.
Glasgow cotton manufacturers pressured the government to help them gain
access to export markets in 1780, since there was “a surplus of Goods
which the Home Consumption cannot exhaust: and therefore a foreign Sale
to a much greater extent becomes indispensably necessary, in order to
occupy the Machinery (which must otherwise be lost) and also to keep
alive the Industry of the People, who have been trained to this
business.”48 Imperial expansion, moreover, had acquainted European, and
especially British, merchants with global cotton markets. By 1770, it
had become clear that markets for cotton textiles in Europe, but even
more so in Africa, the Americas, and, of course, Asia, were huge—and the
opportunities for profit to anyone able to produce for these markets on
a competitive basis virtually limitless. Knowledge of the elasticity and
profitability of these markets derived directly from merchants’
experience in the world’s long-distance cotton trade networks.49</p>
<p>Indeed, export markets eventually became central to Europe’s cotton
textile manufacturers—markets that had been captured, at first, through
the export of fabrics from India. “It is of very great importance to our
Investment,” the London Commercial Department wrote to its counterparts
in Bombay, “that we should be enabled to bring regularly to Sale a
considerable amount of Surat Goods for the supply of the African Trade
in particular.” West Africans turned into principal customers for cotton
cloth secured by the French from Pondicherry not least because imports
into France itself were illegal. As Legoux de Flaix observed in the late
eighteenth century, “It was the establishment of colonies [in the West
Indies] and the slave trade which gave birth to this branch of commerce
with Indoustan…. But if the colonies of the Antilles cease to buy
slaves, one can say without doubt, that this article will decline more
and more.”50</p>
<p>English manufacturers and merchants had relied early on exports of
domestic and Indian fabrics to Africa. This reliance on overseas markets
became pronounced after 1750. As historian Joseph E. Inikori has shown,
in 1760, Britain exported about one-third of its cotton cloth
production. By the end of the eighteenth century the share going abroad
had expanded to about two-thirds. Africa and the Americas were the most
important markets. By mid-century, 94 percent of all cotton cloth
exports from Britain went there. The sheer scale of this market meant
that those able to compete there could reap fortunes. Adam Smith saw
this clearly when he wrote in 1776 that by “opening a new and
inexhaustible market to all the commodities of Europe, it gave occasion
to new divisions of labour and improvements of art, which, in the narrow
circle of the ancient commerce, could never have taken place for want of
a market to take off the greater part of their produce.”51</p>
<p>Africans’ appreciation for these cottons was grounded in their own
cotton industry and their much earlier exposure to Indian textiles.
European slave merchants at first struggled to deliver exactly the type
of cloth for which African demand already existed, especially indigo
blue and white cottons. Around 1730 the East India Company remarked that
a shortage of Indian cottons had “put people upon making goods in
imitation of them here” in England—and European traders even exported
cloth under their Indian names, because Africans usually preferred cloth
“made in India.” In a memorandum for the Board of Trade, Elias Barnes
hoped that British weavers could successfully copy Indian cottons. The
potential market for such cloth, he believed, was immense: “Besides what
is consumed in our Own Dominions, the whole World will be our customer.”
As late as 1791 the Commercial Department of the East India Company
urged Bombay to regularly ship cottons to England “for the supply of the
African trade in particular.”52</p>
<p>Imperial expansion, slavery, and land expropriations—war
capitalism—laid the foundations for the still small and technologically
backward domestic cotton industry in Europe. It provided dynamic markets
and access to technology and to essential raw materials. It also became
a significant engine of capital formation. Mercantile cities such as
Liverpool, which derived their wealth largely from slavery, became
important sources of capital for the emerging cotton industry, and
cotton merchants in Liverpool provided ever more credit to manufacturers
to enable them to work up the cotton. London merchants, in turn, who
sold the yarn and cloth coming from British producers advanced credit to
Lancashire manufacturers. In fact, they provided the very important and
very significant working capital, as profits from trade were redirected
toward manufacturing, “a flow of capital inwards from commerce.”
Moreover, as these merchants gained wealth in long-distance trade, they
could demand political protections from a government increasingly
dependent on extracting revenue from them.53</p>
<p>Last but not least, war capitalism also nourished the emerging
secondary sectors of the economy such as insurance, finance, and
shipping, sectors that would become exceedingly important to the
emergence of the British cotton industry, but also public institutions
such as government credit, money itself, and national defense. These
institutions originated in the world of war capitalism “as advanced
industrial techniques and commercial practices” migrated from export
businesses into the domestic economy.54</p>
<p>European—and especially British—merchants, with the willing
partnership of the British state, had inserted themselves in unique ways
into the global networks of cotton production, between growers and
spinners, between spinners and weavers, between producers and consumers.
Long before the advent of new cotton-producing technologies, they had in
fact already rearranged the global cotton industry and global cotton
networks. These networks were dominated by the joint venture of private
capital and increasingly robust states. Together their commitment to
armed trade, industrial espionage, prohibitions, restrictive trade
regulations, domination of territories, capturing of labor, removal of
indigenous inhabitants, and the state-sponsored creation of territories
that were then left to the far-reaching domination of capitalists had
created a new economic order.55</p>
<p>From these abundant exertions by merchants, manufacturers, and
government bureaucrats alike, Europe by the eighteenth century enjoyed a
fundamentally new place in the global networks of cotton. Most of the
world’s cotton production was still located in Asia, and vibrant cotton
industries remained throughout Africa and the Americas, but Europeans
now decisively dominated its transoceanic trade. In the New World, they
had built a regime for the production of agricultural commodities based
on slave labor, a system of production that would ultimately make more
and more Europeans into cotton growers, even though little cotton grew
on European soil. Strong European states had simultaneously created
barriers to the import of foreign textiles just as they built a system
for the appropriation of foreign technology. By orchestrating economic
processes in Asia, Africa, and the Americas as well as in Europe,
Europeans gained the paradoxical ability to direct the global trade in
Indian textiles while at the same time keeping Asian cloth increasingly
out of Europe, instead trading the products in Africa and elsewhere
beyond Europe’s shores. A globalized textile industry had emerged and
Europeans, for the first time, had grasped the vast scope of the global
demand for cotton goods.</p>
<p>What set European statesmen and capitalists apart from their
counterparts elsewhere was their ability to dominate these global
networks. Whereas trade in Africa, Asia, and the Americas had been
characterized by networks fueled by the mutually advantageous exchange
of goods, Europeans built transcontinental production systems that
exploded existing social relations on their continent and elsewhere. The
significance of this early history of global interaction was not global
trade as such (which remained of limited quantitative importance to all
economies), but instead the reshaping of how things were produced, both
in time and in space, and the social and political ramifications of that
production.56 India and China, or, for that matter, the Aztec and Inca
empires, had not even come close to such global dominance, and even less
so to reinventing how people produced things in the far-flung corners of
the globe. And yet starting in the sixteenth century, armed European
capitalists and capital-rich European states reorganized the world’s
cotton industry. It was this early embrace of war capitalism that was
the precondition for the Industrial Revolution that eventually created
an enormous further push toward global economic integration and
continues to shape and reshape our world today.</p>
<p>What happened was a swift transition from the older world of
cotton—discontinuous, multifocal, horizontal—to an integrated,
centralized, and hierarchical empire of cotton. As late as the
mid-eighteenth century, it would have seemed unlikely to contemporary
observers that Europe, and especially Britain, would very soon turn into
the world’s most important cotton manufacturer. Indeed, even in 1860,
James A. Mann, a fellow at the Statistical Society of London and a
Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, could still remember:</p>
<p>Our own condition, at a period very recent, would but ill-compare
with the then inhabitants of the New World or of India; our moral
condition with all the advantages of climate, was absolutely below the
latter, and the position of the manufacturing art in America, at the
date of its discovery, or in India, surpassed even that of our woolen
manufacture; and to this day, with all our appliances, we cannot surpass
in fineness the muslins of the East, or the solidity and elegance of the
Hamaca’s, the Brazilians and Carribees were wont to weave. When our
people were in primeval darkness, East and West were in comparative
light.</p>
<p>India…is the source whence we received indirectly our ideas of trade;
it was the manufactures of that country, as of China, that inspired the
minds of our forefathers with the wish for luxuries according to the
received notions of the times. The period in which the manufacture was
carried on in India, formed comparatively speaking, the dawning of our
day; the sun was then traveling from another and past era in the world’s
commerce. The Indian manufacture was the forecast of that light, which,
intensifying on its road hither, gained the needful warmth to dispel the
early mists of morn, and develop the embryo state; and strengthened by
the energy of the European, it has given rise to a new era of commercial
splendour never before witnessed.57</p>
<p>As the sun was made to rise over a small part of Europe, as
enterprising Europeans sucked the discontinuous, multifocal, and
horizontal worlds of cotton slowly into their orbit, they invented tools
and methods that enabled them to mobilize land, labor, and markets in
the service of a newly and boldly imagined empire. By creating this vast
sphere of war capitalism that followed rules so different from the ones
in Europe itself, they created not just the conditions for the “great
divergence” and the Industrial Revolution but also for a further
strengthening of states at home that would in turn become crucial to the
creation of the empire of cotton. By 1780, Europe in general, and
Britain in particular, had become a hub of the world’s cotton
networks.</p>
