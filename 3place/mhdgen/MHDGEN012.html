Reconstruction</h4>
<p>Indian cultivators delivering cotton to an upcountry Volkart Brothers
agency. Probably Khamgaon, 1870s. (illustration credit 10.1)</p>
<p>In the fall of 1865, Captain William Hickens of the British Royal
Engineers traveled through the states of the defeated Confederacy.
Dispatched by the Foreign Office to evaluate the prospects of cotton
growing, Hickens met with planters, brokers, “and other individuals
connected with cotton.” In his report to the British secretary of state,
the Earl of Clarendon, he expressed great pessimism about the
possibility of the American South again producing large quantities of
cotton at prices comparable to those of the antebellum years. For 1866,
he expected at most 1 million bales of cotton to come from southern
plantations and farms, one-quarter of the last prewar harvest. The
reason for his dismal assessment was straightforward: There was not
enough labor in the South to plow, seed, prune, and harvest all that
cotton. “So completely has the system of labour been disorganized by the
emancipation of the slaves,” he lamented, that cotton harvests for the
foreseeable future would be vastly reduced. Planters in Louisiana had
told Hickens that “there is the greatest difficulty in getting a fair
day’s work out of the negroes,” as the freedpeople have “no idea of the
sanctity of a contract, and will…evade the performance of [their] part
of it.” The solution, Hickens concluded, was the growing of cotton by
white settlers, who would eventually be able to grow a crop “as large
each year as before the war,” but never again as cheaply as “in the old
days.”1</p>
<p>In April 1865, the question that was first and foremost on the minds
of cotton capitalists and statesmen was if and when the cotton planters
of the American South would resume their position within the empire of
cotton. This question, virtually all observers agreed with Hickens,
boiled down to just one issue: labor. Manchester cotton manufacturer
Edmund Ashworth was all but certain that “the blacks who had once worked
by the whip would be slow to work for wages.” Liverpool cotton broker
Maurice Williams put the issue succinctly: “Now as the power to force
this labor is for ever taken away and that it was mainly owing to this
power that the Southern States were enabled to raise such enormous Crops
of Cotton as previously to supply four fifths the Consumption of the
world it may naturally be expected that free laborers toiling mainly for
themselves cannot for years until their number be materially increased
be expected to produce any large quantity compared with former
crops.”2</p>
<p>Just as slaves had revolutionized the cotton empire, emancipation
forced cotton capitalists toward their own revolution—a frantic search
for new ways to organize the cotton-growing labor of the world.
Reconciling the emancipation of America’s cotton growers with the need
for ever more raw cotton was not easily accomplished. Yet cotton
manufacturers’ insatiable demand for inexpensive cotton made sure that
the “cotton question” remained high on the agenda. Raw cotton imports
were so voluminous that they were generally the most costly item in the
trade of the industrialized nations of Europe, and cotton exports were
at the very top of the list of goods brought from there to foreign
markets. With hundreds of thousands of workers finding employment in
textile mills, these supplies and outlets were crucial to securing the
social stability of European and North American societies. To maintain
an industry so important required a global reconstruction of the empire
of cotton; a search for innovative combinations of land, labor, capital,
and state power.3</p>
<p>The continued rapid growth of the industry over the next half century
amplified this need: Global cotton consumption doubled from 1860 to
1890, and then by 1920 doubled once more. “Among the larger industrial
changes of the last thirty years few exceed, in importance and interest,
the marvelous growth of the manufacture of cotton by machinery,”
reported economist Elijah Helm in 1903. British spinners remained the
world’s most important consumers of raw cotton, but their needs expanded
at a slower rate than before 1860. In the 1840s, their cotton
consumption had increased by 4.8 percent annually, but by the 1870s and
1880s that rate of increase had dropped to 1.4 percent. Britain’s
spinning slowdown, however, was more than made up by the demand from
spinners in the rapidly growing cotton industries of western and eastern
Europe, North America, and, by the early twentieth century, Brazil,
Mexico, India, China, and Japan. In the years between 1860 and 1920
mechanical spindles in the world’s cotton industry tripled, as
entrepreneurs and workers set another 100 million spindles in
motion—half of them in the forty years before 1900, and the other half
in the first two decades of the twentieth century. The spread of power
looms was dramatic as well. In 1860 there were 650,000 power looms; the
number reached 3.2 million by 1929. Continental Europe slowly increased
its share of global cotton spindles between 1860 and 1900 rising from a
quarter of the total in 1860 to 30 percent at the turn of the century.
America also increased its share at the expense of Britain, rising from
a 10 percent share in 1860 to around 20 percent in 1900.4 The primary
effect of this shift was to give a much larger number of states and
capitalists an interest in cheap cotton, and thus in the transformation
of the global countryside, hoping to draw an ever wider swath of the
world’s hinterland into the circuits of metropolitan capital
accumulation.5</p>
<p>The Cotton Empire After Slavery, 1865–1920</p>
<p>That the demand for raw cotton exploded just when the traditional way
of organizing its production—slavery—had collapsed gave increased
urgency to capitalists’ and government bureaucrats’ efforts to mobilize
cotton-growing workers. As we have seen, most cultivators had a strong
preference for producing for their families and communities, not for the
world market. While small growers from India to Alabama to West Africa
were not averse to participating in markets, even long-distance markets,
and did take advantage of opportunities for profit that availed
themselves, their strategies were almost always embedded within a world
of family subsistence, ties of mutual obligation, political
arrangements, rights, and customary practices that made production for
the market secondary. They were reluctant to give up household-focused
production, and, in certain regions, collectively strong enough to
resist the encroachments of European and North American capitalists and
imperial administrators. Moreover, agricultural wages were too low and
too insecure to entice rural cultivators to give up subsistence
production, as much greater risks were not balanced by the possibility
of higher rewards.6</p>
<p>Number of factory spindles, United Kingdom and world without United
Kingdom, 1800–1920 (illustration credit 10.2)</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the empire of cotton, at its core, required the
diligent effort of cotton industrialists, merchants, landowners, and
state bureaucrats to undermine such preferences, drawing, in the
process, on the powers of newly consolidating nation-states, and
sanctioning legal—and often illegal—coercion to make rural farmers into
the cultivators and eventually consumers of commodities. They sought to
revolutionize the countryside by spreading capitalist social relations,
including credit, private ownership in land, and contract law. They
sought—and eventually found—what French colonial officials aptly called
“a new mode of exploitation.”7 The transformation of the countryside
they furthered was most intimately linked to the globalized nature of
industrial production. Earlier forms of global trade had been based on
the exchange of goods produced in all kinds of distinctly noncapitalist
ways—by serfs and within households, for example. Now the wealth and
coercive might of globalizing entrepreneurs and imperial statesmen was
transforming the production regimes of people around the globe by
commodifying both their labor and their land—as they had done in
previous centuries in the Americas, albeit in different forms. In Asia
and Africa the “great transformation” reached, for the first time, into
areas remote from port cities. The logic of industrial capitalism in
effect brought about a new form of global economic integration. The
rising power of manufacturers, and the particular form of capital they
controlled, created a new relationship between capital and territory as
well as the people who dwelled on it, and allowed for new ways to
mobilize their labor.</p>
<p>New forms of labor—including new forms of coercion, violence, and
expropriation—spread over ever larger areas of the cotton-growing parts
of the globe. Domination now rested not so much on the authority of the
master but on the purportedly impersonal but far from impartial social
mechanisms of the market, the law, and the state. The new systems of
labor that emerged from these sometimes violent but almost always
asymmetrical struggles between industrialists, merchants, agricultural
producers, workers, rulers, and bureaucrats became the mainspring of the
production of cotton until the advent of commercially viable mechanical
harvesting in the United States during the 1940s, and of a new global
political economy.8</p>
<p>Even though contemporaries were uncertain if and when American
growers would return to dominating world market production of cotton, no
one doubted that the labor of formerly enslaved cotton growers would be
the foundation of any possible resurgence of American cotton exports,
and with it the revival and continued expansion of the world’s cotton
industry. In 1865, merchants, journalists, and diplomats, many from
Europe, pored over maps and tables and sent scouts to the southern
countryside to discover information on what labor system might replace
slavery.9 The core question, they quickly learned, was whether or not
freedpeople would return to the cotton fields. Many wondered if former
slaves could be kept working on the land that they had tilled for more
than half a century, and if they could be made to continue growing
cotton now that outright bodily coercion had become illegal. Certainly
some optimistic voices could be heard: Boston cotton manufacturer Edward
Atkinson upheld his fervent belief in the superior productivity of free
labor, including in the production of cotton. Others believed that the
“pinchings of want” would “correct” the “prevailing indolence of the
colored people,” forcing them back to the cotton fields.10</p>
<p>Yet most were considerably more pessimistic: “The cultivation of the
hitherto great Southern staples, will of necessity be abandoned,”
predicted the Southern Cultivator. Cotton merchant J. R. Busk, William
Rathbone’s U.S. agent, while hoping that “the pacification of the South
will not be indefinitely postponed by radical measures,” advised that
“negro labour could not be depended on for next year.” George McHenry
from London went even further and argued in his The Cotton Supply of the
United States of America, that only reenslavement would bring forth
cotton: “Cotton can only be cultivated extensively in the Southern
States by negro labour, and negro labour can only be controlled under
the semi-patriarchal system called slavery.” Cotton experts in India
concurred, with some self-interest, as the Bombay cotton commissioner G.
F. Forbes predicted that former slaves would spend their time “sleeping
under the nearest tree.”11</p>
<p>Throughout Europe and the United States, economic and political
elites agreed that former slaves must continue to grow cotton. And they
also agreed that the question of cotton boiled down to labor. As lawyer
and Union general Francis C. Barlow put it to his friend Henry Lee
Higginson, a wealthy Bostonian who hoped in 1865 to purchase a cotton
plantation in the South, “Making money there is a simple question of
being able to make the darkies work.” The question of “negro labor”
agitated the minds of landowners, bureaucrats, former slaves, and
self-appointed experts on such matters from around the globe. As the
Southern Cultivator summarized that discussion, “The all absorbing
subject, [is] what kind of labor is best for us.” And indeed, the
question of how “to manage negro labor successfully” filled the pages of
the journal. Many “experts” feared that freedpeople, as they had in the
West Indies a generation earlier, would engage in subsistence
agriculture. To prevent such “evil consequences,” some advocated the
payment of monetary wages, others a system of sharecropping, while again
others preferred an effort to maintain gang labor. A subscriber from
South Carolina remarked that “the negro [is] the proper, legitimate and
divinely ordained laborer of the South…[who] has become wild in the
exuberance of his freedom…and will be trained to work as a free man. He
cannot be permitted to become what he is in St. Domingo.” The Macon
Telegraph of Georgia put it more succinctly in the spring of 1865: “the
great question now before our people is how to appropriate all the
African labor of the country.”12</p>
<p>Some of the answers to the question of “how to appropriate all the
African labor of the country” had already been found during the war,
when Union generals and northern investors tried to resurrect cotton
production in areas of the South captured by Union troops. Most
prominent were the efforts on the Sea Islands off the coast of South
Carolina and Georgia—an important cotton-growing area for many
decades—where northerners such as Edward Atkinson bought cotton
plantations and tried to implement their vision of “free labor.” They
foresaw a world in which freedpeople would continue to grow export crops
for wages, a project they embraced with infectious enthusiasm. Because
freedpeople often had a different idea as to what freedom
entailed—namely, land ownership and control over their labor—there, as
elsewhere, the Union army obliged freed slaves to work for wages on
plantations. Such measures did not bode well for the freed slaves’ hopes
and aspirations.13</p>
<p>It took a multiyear struggle on plantations, in local courthouses, in
state capitols, and in Washington to determine the outlines of a new
system of labor in the cotton-growing regions of the United States. That
struggle began the moment the fighting ended, when plantation owners,
devastated by the economic and political effects of defeat in war,
sought to restore a plantation world as close to slavery as possible. To
be sure, contracts now had to be made and wages paid—the Macon Telegraph
advised its readers in May 1865 with some regret that “remuneration for
labor will hereafter be necessary”—but beyond that, life was to go on as
before. Former slaves, living in the hovels they had inhabited before
emancipation, were to hoe, plant, weed, and harvest under the
supervision of overseers. Money or, more typically, a share of the crop,
would compensate them for their efforts.14</p>
<p>An early 1866 contract of cotton planter Alonzo T. Mial of Wake
County, North Carolina, with twenty-seven freedpeople stipulated work
from sunrise to sunset, with some additional activities after sunset,
and a commitment to “attend to the plantation on Sundays.” There was no
pay for sick time or leaves. The workers received in return ten dollars
a month, and an additional fifteen pounds of bacon and one bushel of
meal. Similarly, in the southwestern corner of Georgia, a prime
cotton-growing area, upon emancipation planters hired their former
slaves as wage workers, unilaterally imposing restrictive conditions and
minimal pay—so little that it amounted to no more than “life’s
necessities” plus one-tenth of the corn crop (and none of the cotton).
The situation was nearly the same in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta,
perhaps the world’s most important cotton-growing region, where
landlords paid wages, but also tried to limit freedpeople’s mobility and
to force them to remain on plantations and plant cotton. Since most
freedmen and -women possessed hardly anything, landlords imposed these
conditions unilaterally, forcing yearlong contracts on their workers,
binding them to the plantation until after harvest time.15</p>
<p>Left to their own devices, planters imagined a reconstruction of the
empire of cotton based on some form of wage labor, leaving the structure
of land ownership, the rhythm of work, and the pattern of plantation
life largely unchanged. They had powerful allies among the economic and
political elites of Europe whose single-minded focus was on getting more
cotton from the United States.</p>
<p>Planters, however, were not left to their own devices. They
encountered freedpeople determined to create a world radically different
from slavery—indeed, a world in which the production of commodities for
international markets would no longer be their prime concern. Freed
people believed, for good reasons, that only access to land would secure
their newfound freedom, and they argued that their support for the Union
war effort and their unpaid labor under slavery had given them the right
to such lands. Many believed that upon Union victory, forty acres and a
mule would await them. A group of freedmen in Virginia, for example, had
a very clear and completely accurate idea as to why “we have a divine
right to the land.” They recalled that “our wives, our children, our
husbands, has been sold over and over again to purchase the lands we now
locates upon…. And den didn’t we clear the land, and raise the crops of
corn, ob tobacco, ob rice, ob sugar, ob ebery ting. And den didn’t dem
large cities in de North grow up on de cotton and de sugars and de rice
dat we made?” Slavery amounted to the theft of the just rewards of their
labor—a theft now to be compensated by the redistribution of land.16</p>
<p>Yet freedpeople’s hope of turning themselves into landowning
subsistence peasants was short-lived. Much of the land confiscated
during the war was returned to its original owners as early as the fall
of 1865. Without access to land, it was difficult for freedpeople to
exert much control over their labor. With President Andrew Johnson’s
lenient Reconstruction policy, moreover, former slave owners regained
much of their political influence, and they used their restored local
and regional political power to deploy the machinery of the state to
limit the claims of freedpeople to economic resources and power. One of
the first things these “reconstructed” state governments did was to try
to enforce labor discipline and keep workers on plantations. So-called
black codes, passed as early as November 1865 in Mississippi, required
freedpeople to sign labor contracts that defined mobility as “vagrancy.”
And although the federal government, via the Freedmen’s Bureau,
corrected some of the most flagrant violations of “free labor,” many in
the U.S. government also believed that the coercive power of the state
was needed to transform freedpeople into wage workers. An assistant
commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau for Louisiana argued in July 1865,
for example, that it was necessary “that freedmen everywhere be enjoined
to work, and in doing so, they will, in all cases, enter into free and
voluntary contracts.” The irony of being freely enjoined escaped this
commissioner, and many others. Indeed, freedpeople not employed were
threatened with compulsory labor.17 Northerners legitimized these
“compulsory contracts,” as historian Amy Dru Stanley has called them, as
a measure to help guide freedpeople into freedom. At the same time,
alternative ways of gaining access to subsistence, such as allowing
animals to graze on public lands, hunting, fishing, and gathering fruits
and nuts were increasingly restricted.18</p>
<p>Cotton capitalists generally welcomed such measures, with the
Commercial and Financial Chronicle, speaking for New York’s business
community, expressing its hope that freedpeople’s mobility “cannot be
deemed anything more than a temporary state of affairs, to be corrected
by the joint influence of the vagrancy laws and the necessity of the
vagrants.” In the face of such powerful opposition, many freedpeople
felt that they “shall be forever made hewers of wood and drawers of
water”—and, we might add, cultivators of cotton. Divorced from access to
alternative means of subsistence—a situation radically different from
rural cultivators in India or Africa—freedpeople seemed comparatively
easy to convert into agricultural proletarians.19</p>
<p>Yet the defeat of freedpeople’s aspirations was not the end of the
story. So blatant was the attempt by white southern elites to reimpose a
system of labor akin to slavery, and so flagrant was their effort to
ignore their defeat in war, that northerners began to mobilize against
the Reconstruction policies of President Johnson. Thanks to the efforts
of former slaves and their northern allies, freedpeople in 1866 gained
citizenship rights, and in 1867 the right to vote, which allowed them to
use their growing political power to improve their situation on
plantations. By 1867, Congress had reestablished military authority over
southern states. Northern support and the political mobilization of
freedpeople in turn made black workers more able to articulate their
demands on plantations themselves, and by 1867 “freedpeople walked out
of the fields and off their jobs.” They were helped by a shortage of
labor, the result of men working fewer hours than they had under slavery
and many women and children retreating from field labor altogether.
Consequently, slaves managed to negotiate somewhat better contracts.
Contracts in the Delta, for example, paid higher wages and offered
better conditions than those of the previous year. Moreover, freedwomen,
who had an increasingly difficult time finding a place for themselves
and their children in a plantation world that favored physically strong
men, struggled and mobilized for their own inclusion into the world of
labor contracts. Such were the “weapons of the weak.”20</p>
<p>Even more important, freedpeople demanded to work independently, in
family units, and with access to subsistence crops. Planters were now
unable to unilaterally dominate work arrangements. Freedpeople, in turn,
were still unable to own land. By 1867, neither was able to impose their
will entirely on the other. Consequently, a social compromise emerged,
in which African-American families worked particular plots of land
without day-to-day supervision, received supplies from landlords, and
would then be paid with a share of the crop they had grown. Such
sharecropping arrangements spread like wildfire through the
cotton-growing regions of the United States, with gang labor, the
prevalent system during slavery, nearly disappearing. As the Southern
Cultivator observed in November 1867, the “first change that must
occur…is the subdivision of landed estates.” By 1868, even the
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta saw widespread sharecropping, and by 1900 more
than three-quarters of all black farmers in Arkansas, South Carolina,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia were sharecroppers,
retaining a share of the crop, or renters, who paid a fixed sum to the
landowner but retained the crop.21</p>
<p>Alonzo T. Mial now discarded signed wage contracts with his liberated
former slaves and subdivided his plantation into plots for
sharecropping. As elsewhere in the South, the precise character of these
arrangements varied—sometimes Mial agreed to a division of the crop,
sometimes he rented land for fixed quantities of certain crops or even
for outright money payments. In a typical sharecropping contract, Mial
gave access to thirty to thirty-five acres of land to a sharecropper,
along with farming implements. In turn, he received half of the harvest.
Mial’s tenants were contractually obliged to build fences, repair
bridges, clean stables, dig ditches—all of which was “to be done to my
satisfaction, and must be done over until I am satisfied that it is done
as it should be.” In short, he concluded, “All must work under my
direction.” For Mial, sharecropping reduced supervision costs, while
still giving him the power to direct tenants and to decide which crops
to grow.22</p>
<p>The spread of sharecropping as the dominant system of labor in the
cotton-growing regions of the United States testified to the collective
strength of freedpeople, allowing them to escape a far worse system of
gang labor for wages on plantations. Sharecropping gave freedmen and
-women a modicum of control over their own labor, allowed them to evade
day-to-day supervision so reminiscent of slavery, and permitted
families—instead of individuals—to contract with landowners and to
decide on the allocation of the labor of men, women, and children.</p>
<p>Yet in many ways, theirs was a hollow victory. The emerging patterns
of land ownership, systems of labor, and the mechanism of credit supply
made all but certain that farmers in the American South would have to
grow cotton, and that growing cotton would create poverty. When planters
and merchants provided croppers with the supplies they needed, they
charged exorbitant interest. Consequently, the crop was barely
sufficient to pay creditors at the end of the harvest season. On the
Runnymede Plantation in Leflore County in the Mississippi Delta, for
example, croppers paid 25 percent interest to purchase food and 35
percent to purchase clothing. High debts to merchants and landlords in
turn forced sharecroppers to grow ever more cotton, the only crop that
could always be made into money, even though its proceeds per bale
diminished. Operating in an environment of expensive credit, a marginal
position in the nation’s political economy, and falling prices, rural
cultivators watched their incomes deteriorate, a fate they shared with
most farmers across the globe who now produced for world markets.23</p>
<p>The measure of their defeat became especially clear after 1873, as
the economic and political environment shifted drastically. That year
marked the onset of the greatest international economic crisis of the
nineteenth century to date. The rate of growth of demand for cotton
plunged below its antebellum averages, just when many new producers
turned out ever more cotton. With world market prices for cotton
declining, profits for growers diminished. At the same time, the
structure of tenancy, debt, and the marketing of the crop in the
postbellum South continued to create enormous pressure on farmers to
produce ever more cotton, despite—or even because of—falling prices.
While it was perfectly rational for each farmer to embrace cotton, such
a concentration was self-defeating for the region as a whole.24</p>
<p>As the economic situation of cotton growers deteriorated, and as
northern willingness to intervene on behalf of the freedpeople waned,
their political strength diminished as well. Landowners violently
repressed black collective action, increasingly reasserting their own
political power. They captured control of state legislatures, and these
newly constituted “redeemer” legislatures proceeded to disenfranchise
black cotton growers, ensured that their children would be crippled by
poor-quality schooling, and refused them access to legal protection.
Landowners backed up their return to political dominance over the
governmental institutions of the South with an unprecedented campaign of
violence expressly designed to curtail cotton growers’ political
activities: Lynchings in the Mississippi Delta alone numbered a hundred
between 1888 and 1930. For cotton merchants in Europe the planters’
return to political power was welcome news, Baring Brothers London
receiving a telegram on September 16, 1874, from the New Orleans firm
Forstall and Sons, “State government overturned by people conservative
officers in power.”</p>
<p>As landowners secured more political power, they moved quickly to
control African-American labor. When post-Reconstruction redeemer
legislatures altered lien laws to give landlords a primary claim on the
cotton crop, indebted freedpeople sank to a state of dependency without
even the little bargaining power their sharehold had once provided.
Another blow came when legislators modified “criminal law to make
plantation workers susceptible to arrest, conviction, and prison
sentence [for indebtedness], stripping sharecroppers of rights to
growing crops, thereby reducing them to the legal equivalent of wage
workers, and curtailing customary rights to the bounty of nature.” In
1872, the Georgia state supreme court went so far as “den[ying] croppers
decision-making prerogatives and legal rights to their growing crops.”
Indeed, increasingly the courts defined sharecroppers not so much as
tenants but as wage workers. Simultaneously, landowners used the
machinery of the state to limit the mobility of labor. In 1904, for
example, the Mississippi state legislature enacted a new vagrancy law
aimed at driving “negro loafers to the field.” The relationship between
landlords and rural cultivators might have been fundamentally different
from what it had been during slavery, but by the turn of the century,
cotton growers still lived in grinding poverty with few rights and no
political voice.25</p>

<p>Ironically, at the same time that landlords consolidated their
regional power, they themselves experienced what historian Steven Hahn
describes as a “rather dramatic and irreversible decline in power”
within the national economy. Bound to worsening cotton prices, faced
with protectionist tariffs for products they consumed, and plagued by
the scarcity and high cost of capital, they became junior partners in
the political economy of domestic industrialization that had emerged
during the Civil War. Globally, this group of cotton growers was never
as powerful as the merchants, but prior to the Civil War they had
enjoyed regional political control and very significant national
political influence. But now power decisively moved away from raw
material providers such as them. Though they did not know it at the
time, the Civil War had disempowered the world’s last politically
powerful group of cotton growers. From the vantage point of cotton
manufacturers, this marginalization stabilized the empire of cotton,
making the recurrence of the kind of upheaval that had emerged in
defense of slavery quite unlikely.26</p>
<p>If slaves-turned-sharecroppers produced ever more cotton for world
markets, so did the white yeoman farmers of the upcountry South. During
slavery, little cotton had been produced by white yeoman farmers, who
typically grew subsistence crops. Yet after the war the situation
changed: In areas where cotton production had once been marginal, and in
which households relied on subsistence crops and household manufacturing
for their livelihood, growing cotton became the order of the day. In the
majority white farms of the Georgia upcountry, for example, the amount
of cotton produced per thousand bushels of corn—a subsistence
crop—tripled between 1860 and 1880.27</p>
<p>What explains this expansion of cotton production by yeoman farmers?
In the wake of the war, transportation, communications, and selling
facilities spread rapidly into formerly isolated areas of the South.
Railroad mileage in Georgia had, for instance, tripled during the 1870s.
The infrastructural penetration of new cotton-growing territories
transformed the countryside. With the railroads came stores and
merchants, as well as ginning and pressing facilities. Yeoman farmers,
devastated by the war, now raised cotton to gain access to cash. As
merchants moved into even the smallest hinterland towns, yeoman farmers
could easily sell that cotton, while at the same time enjoying broader
access to manufactured goods, fertilizers, and, importantly, credit.
“Such credit was important to recover from the effects of the war,”
observed a German social scientist in 1906, “but once enmeshed in the
credit system, farmers were also forced to grow ever more cotton,
because merchants would only place liens against a crop that could be
easily sold.” Many white farmers lost their farms as a result, and by
1880 one-third of them rented the land they worked on. In effect, the
capitalist transformation of yeoman farmers made them more like their
black sharecropping brethren: Increasingly these whites lost control of
the only things they owned—their land and their subsistence crops. Yet
their shift in crops was exceedingly important to the global cotton
economy. White yeoman farmers had produced at most 17 percent of all
U.S. cotton before the Civil War; by 1880 their share had increased to
44 percent.28</p>
<p>Cotton production by white farmers increased dramatically:

‘An I don’t make him pick; he picked some last year.’ Has about 20
pounds in his bag. Comanche County, Oklahoma.” (illustration credit

<p>While white yeoman farmers and former slaves grew the vast majority
of southern cotton, they were not alone. A scattered group of planters
appealed “to see German and Chinese Immigrants” brought to the South and
in the early twentieth century, efforts were made to bring Italian
immigrants to the Mississippi Delta. A few immigrant workers did end up
working for wages on Louisiana cotton plantations, but they never became
a major part of the workforce, as much more lucrative opportunities
beckoned immigrants in other parts of the Americas. More important as a
source of labor were leased convicts. James Monroe Smith’s
twenty-thousand-acre plantation in Oglethorpe County, Georgia, for
example, which produced annually three thousand bales of cotton by 1904,
counted many convicts among its more than one thousand workers.
Previously, Smith’s constant problem had been labor recruitment and in
1879 he had found a solution by investing in the Penitentiary Company
Three, set up to rent convicts throughout the state. As a one-quarter
owner of that company, Smith had access to one-quarter of its convicts.
In addition, Smith employed convicts from local jails. These workers
were treated with great violence, shot dead if they tried to escape. So
harsh was the treatment that Smith was eventually the subject of a state
inquiry and an 1886 letter writer to the Cartersville Courant accused
him of severely whipping convicts, noting that some prisoners received
as many as 225 lashes—a charge he denied.29</p>
<p>As Smith’s example shows, the mobilization of labor for cotton
growing in the United States went hand in hand with coercion. The degree
of violence was in some ways surprising, considering that freedpeople’s
transition to proletarian agricultural labor was much easier to effect
than that of Indian or African rural cultivators, who enjoyed a greater
degree of control over land and their labor. Yet the violence descending
upon the countryside of the U.S. South testified in an indirect way to
the enormously powerful desire of freedpeople for a different way of
life and was as much a sign of the weakness of landowners as their
strength. It took the determined initiative of landowners in alliance
with the state to guarantee that rural cultivators’ efforts at building
subsistence-oriented economies were undermined and their labor deployed
for the production of agricultural commodities for world markets. Few
observers in 1865 had expected such a spectacularly successful
transition away from slavery and toward new systems of labor—a
transition that filled with hope the hearts of imperial statesmen and
metropolitan cotton manufacturers the world over.30</p>

<p>As struggles on plantations, in statehouses, and in the halls of
power in Washington, D.C., determined labor regimes in the
cotton-growing regions of the South, Reconstruction resulted in a rapid,
vast, and permanent increase in the production of cotton for world
markets in the United States. American rural cultivators recovered,
despite all predictions to the contrary, their position as the world’s
leading producers of raw cotton. By 1870 their total production had
surpassed their previous high, set in 1860. By 1877 they had regained
their prewar market share in Great Britain. By 1880 they exported more
cotton than they had in 1860. And by 1891 sharecroppers, family farmers,
and plantation owners in the United States grew twice as much cotton as
in 1861 and supplied 81 percent of the British, 66 percent of the
French, and 61 percent of the German market. So successful was the
reconstruction of cotton growing in the United States that it came to be
seen by imperial bureaucrats and capitalists everywhere as a model.
Imperialists of all stripes and colors, from Great Britain to Germany to
Japan, studied the United States to draw lessons for their own
cotton-growing projects, and American cotton growers became sought-after
experts, advising colonial governments on the transition to commercial
cotton production.31</p>
<p>The emergence of new forms of cotton-growing labor in the United
States was, in the wake of the emancipation of the world’s preeminent
cotton growers, the single most important change within the empire of
cotton. Yet in other parts of the world, partly encouraged by the crisis
of cotton production in the United States, manufacturers, merchants, and
bureaucrats accelerated the transformation of the countryside that had
already begun during the Civil War, though by varied methods and with
divergent results. Thanks to their activities, between 1865 and 1920
several million sharecroppers, wage workers, and peasant operators in
Asia, Africa, and the Americas began to grow the white gold for the
spinning mills of Europe and North America, and by the turn of the
century, for factories in Japan, India, Brazil, and China as well.</p>
<p>In the last decades of the nineteenth century it was India that
experienced the most dramatic expansion of cotton production for world
markets. Indeed, at the end of the Civil War in the United States, the
Bombay Chamber of Commerce had already observed that the “emancipation
of American slaves [was] a matter of paramount importance” for the
future of India’s cotton industry, signifying a permanent change in the
social structure of a large swath of the Indian countryside and in the
trade of India. While Indian rural producers were not able to hold on to
their dominant position in world cotton markets after the war
(especially after 1876), their production for export still rose rapidly,
expanding from 260 million pounds in 1858 to nearly 1.2 billion pounds
in 1914. Export merchants, however, no longer sold most of this much
larger crop to manufacturers in India’s two traditional markets—Great
Britain and China—but instead found buyers in continental Europe and,
after the turn of the century, among Japanese spinners. By 1910, only 6
percent of Indian cotton exports went to Great Britain, while Japan
consumed 38 percent, and continental Europe 50 percent. Continental and
Japanese manufacturers, in contrast to their British counterparts, had
adjusted their machines to work up the shorter Indian staple,
successfully mixing Indian with American cotton, producing coarser
cloth. As a result, in the thirty years after 1860, continental European
consumption of Indian cotton increased sixty-two-fold, “a substantial
help,” as the Bremen Chamber of Commerce put it in 1913. To supply these
needs, cotton acreage in India expanded, and by the late 1880s in some
areas of India (such as Berar) one-third of all land was under cotton.
This expansion of export occurred simultaneously with an explosion in
the number of mechanized spindles in India itself. Indeed, by 1894, less
than 50 percent of the Indian cotton harvest was exported, as Indian
cotton mills consumed about 518 million pounds of cotton and an
additional 224 to 336 million pounds were used in hand spinning.32</p>
<p>While Indian cotton played an important role in the coarse goods
market, Brazilian cotton matched the quality of the U.S. crop much
better. As a result, in Brazil cotton exports expanded in the last third
of the nineteenth century. During the 1850s they had averaged 32.4
million pounds per year. During the following three decades, Brazil
exported an average of 66.7 million pounds of cotton annually—despite
the simultaneous growth of domestic cotton manufacturing by a factor of
fifty-three. In 1920, Brazil produced 220 million pounds of cotton, of
which it exported one-quarter.33</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Egypt, fellaheen had quintupled their cotton production
between 1860 and 1865 from 50.1 million to 250.7 million pounds. To be
sure, Egyptian cotton was of much higher quality than much of the U.S.
crop; it was, as Roger Seyrig, a French cotton manufacturer observed,
“an article of luxury.” After the U.S. Civil War, its production at
first fell significantly to about 125 million pounds, but by 1872
merchants shipped again more than 200 million pounds from the port of
Alexandria to European destinations. Even during the post–Civil War
trough of cotton production, Egypt’s output was still two and a half
times as large as it had been before the Civil War. And by 1920, it
produced 598 million pounds of cotton, or twelve times as much as in
1860. A full 40 percent of all land in Lower Egypt was planted in
cotton. To some, Egypt now seemed like a giant cotton plantation.34</p>
<p>By the last third of the nineteenth century, Egyptian, Brazilian, and
Indian cotton had become a significant new presence on world markets. In
1883, cotton from these regions had captured a full 31 percent of the
(now much larger) continental European market, or a little more than
twice as much as in 1860.35</p>
<p>The expansion of cotton growing on multiple continents was all the
more remarkable because it happened without slavery. The problem that
had vexed cotton capitalists since the 1820s, namely how to make
nonenslaved rural cultivators into growers of cotton for world markets,
moved toward a resolution that seemed to please the interests of
European and North American cotton manufacturers and statesmen. Yet, as
in the American South, which in many ways came to serve as a model of
how such a transition could be effected, the precise ways in which rural
cultivators became growers of cotton for world markets varied widely and
were the outcome of drawn-out conflicts among labor, landowners,
providers of capital, and imperial bureaucrats.</p>
<p>What all these struggles to recast the global countryside had in
common was that states now played an important role. New forms of
coercion, instituted and carried out by the state, replaced the outright
physical violence of masters that had been so important to slave labor.
This does not mean that physical violence was absent, but it was
secondary compared to the pressures that came from contracts, the law,
and taxation. As states developed new sovereignty over territory they
also extended their sovereignty over labor, testifying to the new
institutional strength of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>Khamgaon was a small city, a town really, in Berar, the center of the
large western Indian district that had long been renowned for the
quality of its cottons. Decades before the arrival of the British, some
of this cotton had been exported on bullock carts to Mirzapore on the
Ganges and then shipped to Calcutta, but farmers never specialized
exclusively in the fiber and grew many other things as well, while also
engaging in spinning and weaving. Indeed, the trade in “raw thread” spun
locally had dwarfed the trade in raw cotton. Things began to change by
1825 with the rise of an export market in raw cotton, when the Parsi
merchants Messrs. Pestanji and Company brought the first cotton on “pack
oxen” to Bombay. Dissatisfied with the slow expansion of that trade,
Britain assumed political control over Berar in 1853—a position that
served Lancashire manufacturers well when during the American Civil War
Berar became “one of the very finest cotton fields in India.”36</p>
<p>As the British colonial administration and Lancashire manufacturers
saw the potential of Berar as a major cotton-growing area, and upon the
urgings of British manufacturers, the colonial state completed in 1870 a
railroad to Khamgaon (paid for by Berar’s “surplus revenue”), which now
had an estimated nine thousand inhabitants. “The last obstacle has been
removed, and for the future direct communication by steam exists between
this the largest emporium of cotton in Western India and the ports of
Europe, which will take every bale that can be brought into its market,”
celebrated Mr. C. B. Saunders, the British resident at Hyderabad. When
the railroad arrived in Khamgaon, none other than the viceroy himself
spoke at the opening celebration, a day on which “the Court House, the
Factories, the Cotton Market, and every prominent point were gaily
decked with flags.” He reminded his listeners, many of whom were cotton
merchants, that “we all know that the cotton famine in America had a
great deal to do in stimulating the development and production of cotton
in this country.” Such new production for world markets, he argued, not
only benefited the development of India itself, but was also “conferring
vast benefits on a class which at a very recent period, in a time of
great suffering and distress, displayed almost heroic qualities”—the
operatives in the cotton manufacturing districts of Lancashire.
Symbolizing the centrality of cotton to the colonial project in Berar,
the viceroy eventually “drove to the cotton market, in which a monster
triumphal arch, composed chiefly of cotton bales, had been erected” in
his and the new railroad’s honor.37</p>
<p>With the railroad came the telegraph. Now a Liverpool merchant could
wire an order for cotton to Berar and receive it on the docks of the
Mersey just six weeks later, the journey on a steamer from Bombay to
Liverpool accomplished in twenty-one days thanks to the newly opened
Suez Canal.38 The impact of such infrastructure projects was staggering,
with Berar cotton commissioner Harry Rivett-Carnac expecting that
soon</p>
<p>the cotton grown around Khamgaon, purchased at the market there, and
pressed at the adjoining factories, may not have to leave the rails,
from the time that it is rolled from the press-house into the wagon,
until its arrival on the wharf at Bombay; and it will not be difficult
to calculate the time that will be necessary, with the assistance of the
telegraph which joins Khamgaon and Liverpool, the complete railway
communication between the market and the port of shipment, and with,
perhaps, the Suez Canal to assist still further in the transport of our
cotton, to execute an order sent from Liverpool and to land the required
number of Khamgaon bales in Lancashire.39</p>
<p>British India might indeed be considered the archetype for the
flexible pragmatism by which states helped capitalists gain access to
cotton-growing labor, and how capitalists then found ways to mobilize
that labor. Pushed by Lancashire manufacturers and cotton merchants from
Liverpool to Bombay, the British colonial government in India continued
its project, which had accelerated significantly during the U.S. Civil
War, of promoting the transformation of the cotton-growing countryside.
The impact was swift: As late as 1853, Berar had remained largely
removed from world markets, with a village-oriented economy with a
substantial household manufacturing sector. By the 1870s, however, much
of Berar’s economic activity focused on the production of raw cotton for
world markets. A British colonial official observed by the middle of
that decade that in Berar, “Cotton is grown almost entirely for export.
The manufacture of home cloth has been undermined by the importation of
English Piece Goods, and many of the weaver class have become ordinary
labourers.” This reorientation of the local economy also pushed people
into agricultural labor, as for example the banjaras (traditional owners
of carts who had transported cotton), and weavers as well as spinners,
found themselves out of employment and increasingly dependent on
agricultural pursuits. Indeed, forty years later a gazetteer could
report that Berar’s once thriving cotton manufacturing industry had all
but disappeared “since the advent of the railway.”40 As Rivett-Carnac
explained in 1869,</p>
<p>Now it is not too much to hope, that, with a branch railway to this
tract, European piece goods might be imported so as to undersell the
native cloth. And the effect would be, that, not only would a larger
supply of the raw material be obtained,—for what is now worked up into
yarn would be exported,—but the larger population now employed in
spinning and weaving would be made available for agricultural labour,
and thus the jungle land might be broken up and the cultivation
extended.</p>
<p>For Secretary of State for India Charles Wood, such changes to the
Indian social structure produced a sense of déjà vu: “The conclusions
drawn from the Cotton papers are on the whole satisfactory. The Native
weavers are exactly the class of people whom I remember in my early days
on the Moor Edges in the West Riding. Every small farmer had 20 to 50
acres of land, and two or three looms in his house. The factories and
mills destroyed all weaving of this kind, and now they are exclusively
agriculturalists. Your Indian hybrids [that is, people who combined
farming with household manufacturing] will end in the same way.”
Contemporaries like Wood understood that they were part of a grand move
to transform the world’s countryside into the producer of raw materials
and consumer of manufactured goods (as well as, eventually, a supplier
of labor to factories), and they took pride in their role.41</p>
<p>Altogether, Berar became one of the world’s most significant
laboratories for the reconstruction of the empire of cotton. Its
diversified agricultural economy was turned into ever greater
specialization on cotton crops. As The Asiatic reflected in 1872, “A
pressure unknown before was put upon the people to grow cotton.” While
in 1861 cotton was harvested on 629,000 acres of land in Berar, that
acreage had nearly doubled by 1865, and then doubled once more by the
1880s. By the early twentieth century, Berar alone produced one-quarter
of the Indian cotton harvest—a harvest larger than that of all of Egypt.
As one observer put it, Berar had “become a perfect garden of
cotton.”42</p>
<p>In Egypt, as in India and the United States, the expansion of cotton
agriculture was a direct result of the powerful interventions of the
state. A redefinition of property rights in the last third of the
nineteenth century made possible a massive redistribution of land away
from villages and nomadic peoples to the well-connected owners of huge
estates. Before that transformation, property in Egypt provided the
right to shares of the revenue of the land, which meant that ownership
claims to particular pieces of land were usually shared among various
individuals, communities, religious authorities, and the state.43 Such
multifaceted claims effectively hindered the purchase and sale of land;
by the later decades of the nineteenth century such property rights
stood in the way of a further commercialization of agriculture.</p>
<p>As a result, the Egyptian government, motivated by its desire to
extract more taxes to pay for the expansion of the nation’s
infrastructure and the mushrooming service on its enormous debt, as well
as its desire to better control its people, moved toward conferring
property rights in very large estates to well-placed individuals. At
first these estates were merely “tax responsibilities” of their owners,
but by the 1870s they became their outright private property, much of
which consisted of land taken, usually forcibly, from villages. Now that
the cotton-growing estates increasingly were held as the outright
property of large landowners, the villagers who once had controlled some
of the revenue of the land, and some rights of settlement, fell entirely
on the mercy of these landowners. These new estate owners could force
peasants to live in special “private villages” that controlled most
aspects of their lives. Those cultivators who did not do what was asked
of them were expelled, joining the ever-growing ranks of the landless
agricultural proletariat.44</p>
<p>The rights of the new owners were far-reaching, including their
ability to “imprison, expel, starve, exploit, and exercise many other
forms of arbitrary, exceptional, and, if necessary, violent powers.” As
a result, these estates represented a “system of supervision and
coercion that succeeded for the first time in fixing cultivators
permanently on the land.” To make land into the exclusive possession of
single individuals had required what political scientist Timothy
Mitchell has described as the “violence of property making.” These new
property rights spread rapidly: In 1863, estate owners controlled
one-seventh of the cultivated land area of Egypt, by 1875 almost twice
as much, and by 1901 a full 50 percent.45 In 1895, just 11,788
individuals held nearly half of all lands in Egypt, while the other half
was held by 727,047 proprietors. Some of these estates were huge;
Ibrahim Mourad, for example, controlled thirteen thousand acres in
Toukh, worked by twenty thousand cultivators, dwarfed only by the
mammoth estates that Egypt’s ruler, Isma’il Pasha, had personally
seized.46</p>
<p>As elsewhere, the transformation of the Egyptian cotton-growing
countryside rested on a vast pyramid of credit. At the bottom, workers
on cotton estates were almost always in debt to moneylenders and
landowners, constantly threatened by debt bondage. Landowners, in turn,
received credit from local merchants, many of them foreigners. The
largest landowner of all, Isma’il, accumulated such debts that in 1878,
in the wake of falling cotton prices, he signed over his estates to his
creditors, the Rothschilds. At the same time, the Egyptian state took
out massive loans to finance the digging of irrigation canals (largely
by resorting to forced labor), the building of railroads, and the import
of steam pumps. So staggering were the amounts borrowed that the state
eventually went bankrupt, despite ever greater pressure on the Egyptian
people to produce for export markets. That debt brought Egypt as a whole
into the arms of the British: With diminishing proceeds from cotton,
Egypt could not service its debt, lost sovereign control, and was
eventually taken over by the British government in 1882.47</p>
<p>As the examples of Egypt and India show, by the last third of the
nineteenth century, rulers and bureaucrats played a critical role in the
effort to further cotton growing for world markets. They did so partly
because their own power rested on access to resources and was made more
stable by the relative social peace that came from humming mills. But
they also acted at the behest of powerful capitalists—either because
rulers and capitalists were largely the same group of elites, as in the
case of Egypt, or because statesmen were subject to concerted lobbying
and political pressure, such as in the case of Britain and France and,
as we will see, Germany.</p>
<p>States’ desire to mobilize cotton-growing labor now led to
unprecedented claims upon their subjects, as states increasingly defined
and enforced the rules of the market. From Berar to the Nile Delta to
Minas Gerais, governments and courts undermined older collective claims
to resources such as grazing and hunting rights, forcing peasants to
dedicate themselves single-mindedly to the production of cotton. Berar’s
natural landscape, for example, was turned upside down by a vast British
effort to survey the land, followed by the encouragement of the British
to turn so called “waste lands” into cotton farms. “Waste lands” once
had been open to the collective use of farmers, but now increasingly
were turned into private property. In the process, extensive forests
that traditionally had been the source of firewood and wild foods were
logged, and grasslands put under the plow that had in earlier times
served as communal grazing lands. Logging further reduced the forests to
feed the steam presses of Western merchants in the major Berar cotton
towns. In some parts of the world, such deforestation led to
significantly altered patterns of rainfall, undermining the very
colonial cotton craze that had incited deforestation in the first
place.48</p>
<p>Court-enforced lien laws, moreover, gave creditors another means to
undermine peasants’ claims to the land and enmesh them further in a
quagmire of debt, which forced them to grow ever more cotton. The
systems of mutual dependence and personal domination that had
characterized the countryside of Berar, the American South, and
elsewhere before the U.S. Civil War gave way to a world in which
creditors backed by the state turned rural cultivators into producers
and consumers of commodities. As an anonymous British writer on Indian
cotton explained, “Where there is no intelligent population to lead the
way, a Government must do what in more civilized countries can safely be
left to private enterprise.”49</p>
<p>The creation of private property in land became yet another state-led
project, in India and elsewhere. British cotton manufactures, demanding
that the colonial government “set its colonial house in order,” called
for new forms of land tenure, as they perceived the old system of
communal ownership as “obstructive to the rights of individual
ownership, and to its effective cultivation.” They saw private property
in land as a precondition for increasing production of cotton.
Individuals were to gain clear title in land that then could be bought,
sold, rented, or mortgaged. These new property rights were quite a
departure: In precolonial Berar, for example, relations between various
social groups had been characterized by a “master-servant relationship
of social status in the caste hierarchy” in which “the produce of the
soil…was divided according to social ranking.” Individuals did not
control particular pieces of land, but instead enjoyed rights to a share
of the harvest. A British colonial official perceptively compared that
“system, if system it may be called,” to “medieval Europe.” Once the
British arrived on the scene, however, the land was surveyed, boundaries
between various landowners clearly demarcated, and taxes on each parcel
set. A class of khatedars was created who controlled the land, and in
turn were made responsible for tax payments. By 1870, a British colonial
official was able to report that the revolution was succeeding. In Berar
“the occupant of land is its absolute proprietor.” Because the khatedars
owned land, but no capital, they were dependent on moneylenders, to whom
they now were able to mortgage the land they controlled. To work the
land, these khatedars brought in sharecroppers, who in turn received
their working capital from moneylenders. There and elsewhere in India,
it was the large landowners, and moneylenders, who drew significant
profit from the extension of cotton culture for export, unlike the vast
majority of small landholders or landless peasants, who entered a morass
of debt and poverty.50</p>
<p>With private property in land spreading throughout the global
countryside, landowners could now also be made responsible for the
payment of taxes, to be paid in cash, which in turn encouraged the
production of cash crops. In the Indian province of Maharashtra, as in
Berar, British efforts to increase revenue and encourage peasants to
produce for distant markets led to the weakening of the collective
nature of villages. Individual peasants, instead of villages as a whole,
were now responsible for taxes. Moneylenders thereby gained new power
over peasants’ land and labor, as rural cultivators became dependent on
advances to pay their taxes. In similar ways, in the Çukurova, the
Ottoman state increasingly taxed local populations, and as a result,
people had to engage in wage labor, or were forced to work on
infrastructure projects. Cotton production benefited from their need for
cash—just like in the United States—because “cotton is the one article,”
observed the Cotton Department in Bombay in 1877, “that always commands
the readiest and best sales.”51</p>
<p>While Indian cotton growers usually held on to their land, unlike
freedpeople in the United States, they had to draw on advances not just
for tax payments, but also to purchase implements, cottonseeds, and even
grains to hold them over until harvest time. New contract laws allowed
these same moneylenders to enjoy a modest security when making advances
to peasants. New property rights in fact favored the commercialization
of agriculture not just because they made for easier land transactions,
but also because they allowed for the infusion of capital, for which the
land itself could now serve as collateral. Cultivators paid exorbitant
rates of interest on these loans (30 percent annually was not unusual),
and in turn they signed over their cotton crop to moneylenders, usually
many months before the harvest—creating what one historian has called
“debt bondage.”52</p>
<p>Moneylenders—sowkars—had been deeply rooted in villages and had
advanced credit to peasants for a long time before the arrival of the
British. However, they had been embedded within a moral economy that had
forced them to support peasants in years of poor harvests, a lifeline
that increasingly disappeared in the more commercialized economy that
British colonialism was building. While moneylenders could acquire
modest wealth, and large landowners could benefit from the availability
of capital (allowing them to focus on a cash crop with hired labor),
small landholders, sharecroppers, and especially landless agricultural
wage workers were most at risk. As prices for cotton continued to fall
for nearly thirty years after the Civil War, this mass of “modernizing”
farmers were thrust into more and more desperate circumstances; many of
them would eventually perish in famines that swept the cotton-growing
districts of India during the 1890s.53</p>
<p>New infrastructures, new laws, and new property rights invaded the
global countryside on the trails of strengthening and expanding states,
making the kind of transformations possible that still had been
unimaginable a few decades earlier. State involvement in cotton was
furthered in many other ways. Perhaps the most comprehensive endeavor
was the systematic effort to collect and disseminate information about
all aspects of cotton agriculture. Huge compilations about climate and
soil conditions, production trends, patterns of land ownership, seed
qualities, and labor systems increasingly filled governmental office
files, much of the same information that in previous decades merchants
had laboriously gathered and transmitted via letters or circulars. In
part this was a straightforward effort to systematize and appropriate
indigenous knowledge. Observing Indian peasants’ efforts to grow cotton
could yield useful information about best practices under specific
environmental conditions, which could then be transferred to Africa or
elsewhere. Similarly, specific strains of cotton could be collected and
then sent to other parts of the world—indeed, governments enabled a
vastly accelerated circulation of biological matter throughout the
world. But more important than either of these two tasks was a very
simple effort to take stock—to observe what was there in the social and
natural world, to translate that information into numbers, force it into
tables, compile it, and then send it out throughout the empire of
cotton. These numbers clarified the “potential” of certain places and
suggested certain policies to actualize that potential.54</p>
<p>Throughout the cotton-growing world, governments embarked on such
efforts. In 1866, the colonial government of India created the “Cotton
Commissioner for the Central Provinces and the Berars,” a colonial
bureaucrat who collected scrupulously detailed information on
cotton-growing regions. Harry Rivett-Carnac, an intrepid agent of the
cotton empire’s expansion, came to fill this position, traveling up and
down Berar, living in a railroad carriage “with an attached horse box,
so that I could, whenever necessary, ride off to some important point in
the district where my presence was required,” all to “extend and improve
the cultivation in order to increase the supply; then to undertake all
necessary measures to assist the trade in getting these supplies to the
coast in good order and without delay.” The revolutionary transformation
of the world’s countryside rested on the shoulders of such government
bureaucrats. By 1873, the Indian government expanded these activities
and centralized them by creating a Fibres and Silk Branch that studied
the production of cotton, among other fibers, throughout India in
exacting detail.55</p>
<p>Other countries followed suit. The United States in 1862 established
a Department of Agriculture, which soon began to work on cotton. The
department first collected statistical information, but soon broadened
its activities by studying diseases affecting the cotton plant, trying
to identify cotton strains particularly suited for particular
environmental conditions, and breeding improved cotton strains. The
department also applied itself to the pressing question of how cotton
could be grown in western states such as Arizona. In 1897, Russia
created an Administration of Agriculture and State Domains in its newly
acquired Central Asian possessions, whose focus was cotton. In Egypt,
the government provided detailed information about agricultural best
practices to cotton farmers and by 1919 created a ministry of
agriculture to expand on these efforts—a model later studied and
appropriated by the Belgian colonial authorities in the Congo.56</p>
<p>The collection of information went hand in hand with governmental
efforts to recast cotton agriculture directly: British colonial
officials distributed American cottonseeds to Indian peasants, worked on
changing Indian cotton strains, and encouraged peasants to use new
agricultural methods. The Egyptian Société Royale d’Agriculture
experimented with model farms. Local peasants often resisted such
projects, for not only was the planting of new cotton strains more
labor-intensive, but it was also riskier because they had not been
proven in the local climate. Few projects provided increased
remuneration to offset these burdens, and it took powerful pressures to
make them succeed.57</p>
<p>Despite working in concert, powerful governments and capital-rich
merchants and landowners did not always accomplish their grand projects.
Government records are replete with efforts of rural cultivators to
delay, or even halt, the reordering of their economies. In Dhawar in
western India, for example, peasants retained a strong preference for
growing indigenous varieties of cotton, and also for privileging food
crops, despite sustained efforts by British colonial officials to
introduce American varieties. Local varieties were much better adapted
to the local climate, commanded a ready local market, and fit better
into the household economies because they could be ginned locally.58
Sudanese peasants, as the Austrian consul general reported from Khartoum
in 1877, refused to grow increasing amounts of cotton because “the
native searches and finds his means of subsistence in much easier ways
and in less taxing occupations than the difficult and relatively
unprofitable cultivation of the soil.” In Iraq, a German observer
remarked in 1919 that “the awakening of a greater willingness to labor
is prevented by the presence of cultures in the country which provide
the laborer effortlessly everything he needs for nourishment and for all
other necessities”—an argument made by colonial officials the world
over. In Burma, a British bureaucrat regretfully observed “the
indifference shown to cotton-growing as a paying industry by the Burmese
peasantry themselves, who look upon it as of very secondary importance
and are not likely to take much interest in cotton while they can make,
with much less trouble, handsome profits in their paddy crops.”59</p>
<p>The significance of these struggles can perhaps best be seen in an
area where production failed, despite decisive efforts: Australia.
Starting in the early twentieth century, the British colonial
administration made efforts to grow cotton in a continent with virtually
unlimited supplies of land perfectly suited for cotton agriculture.
Despite these efforts, cotton production expanded only slowly. The
Adelaide Advertiser understood the reasons well: While abundant land was
suitable for the growing of cotton, what was missing was cheap labor to
plant, hoe, and harvest the crop. The chief difficulty facing any sort
of expansion, reported the Advisory Committee of Science and Industry,
“is the high cost of picking by hand.” Because of the shortage of cheap
labor, and because white settlers had options far better than cotton,
the committee observed in 1918 that “cotton growing in Australia is now
practically extinct.” Theo Price, president of the New York
Price-Campbell Cotton Picker Corporation, advising the government of
Australia on such matters in 1917, understood the reasons perfectly:
“Cotton culture is largely a matter of labor. Unless you can be assured
of an abundant supply of labor, it is going to be difficult to cultivate
cotton on anything like a large scale. I do not know what your
immigration laws in Australia are but if you can bring the Chinese in….
I think [it may] be practicable to develop cotton growing rapidly.”
“Labor conditions,” concluded the Sydney Evening News in 1920, “are not
conducive to the establishment of the cotton industry on an economic
basis.” Without access to abundant cheap labor, the cotton market could
not be satiated.60</p>
<p>Yet despite such setbacks, cotton capitalists sought labor, and ever
more of it. In the cotton-growing regions of India, Brazil, and Egypt,
as in the United States, the empire of cotton expanded as landowners,
colonial bureaucrats, merchants, and local political elites such as the
landlords of the American South were able to turn rural cultivators into
producers and consumers of commodities.61 The precise arrangements found
to mobilize their labor differed from place to place because they
depended on the relative local, regional, or colonial distribution of
social power.62 Industrial capitalism’s great strength derived exactly
from its continued ability to connect to different systems of labor, and
especially to draw on the extraordinary cheapness of production made
possible by the incomplete transformation of the world of rural
cultivators, a world in which family labor often remained uncompensated
and subsistence was to some extent still produced within households.
Local and regional circumstances encrusted in traditions and the
distribution of social power shaped the emerging labor arrangements. It
mattered, for example, that cotton growers in the United States enjoyed
access to the franchise for a little more than two decades (limiting the
political power of landowners), just as it mattered that economies in
Africa remained vibrant and largely independent of European capital. As
a result, some rural cultivators turned into sharecroppers, others into
renters, and again others into wage workers. Even as their power and
traditional way of life was steadily stripped away, they still
maintained some influence—indeed, they still had more sway over their
daily lives than the millions of unskilled workers laboring in spinning
and weaving mills.63</p>
<p>Rural cultivators, landowners, merchants, and bureaucrats struggled
over the shape of the new empire of cotton and the forms of labor within
it, constrained by the startling imbalances of power in particular
locales and the unequal relationship between various parts of the world.
By the end of the nineteenth century, sharecropping and tenant farming
had become the dominant mode of mobilizing labor for similar reasons
that they dominated in the United States: Rural cultivators preferred
the autonomy of working without day-to-day supervision, and they
generally resisted being turned into wage workers. In Berar,
sharecropping tenants worked the land of khatedar landowners, receiving
their working capital from moneylenders. In Egypt, most of the crop was
grown not by “hired labor,” but instead by “small occupiers themselves,”
some sharecroppers, some owners, all of whom were able to draw upon the
labor of their families; indeed, most cotton in Egypt was picked by
children. In Brazil, sharecropping, along with small family farms,
spread. On large estates tenant families “paid” for their land rent by
giving a share of the crop to the owners. In Peru, landowners rented
their land to cultivators in response to the closing of the trade in
Chinese indentured workers in 1874 and their inability to attract
peasants to work for wages. In the Çukurova, which had been largely
unsettled before the advent of cotton agriculture toward the end of the
nineteenth century, large-scale landholdings were in need of labor, and
most of that labor was recruited through sharecropping arrangements
along with some migrant wage laborers.64</p>
<p>Wherever sharecropping prevailed, tenant farmers as well as small
owner-operators became dependent on outside capital. In Sind, India, for
example, peasants sold the crop to moneylenders as soon as they had sown
it, to pay for loans they had received to enable them to focus on cotton
in the first place, “in part being hard cash, part grain, and cotton
seed, cloth, bajri, flour andandandand c. for the family and workmen.”
Moneylending merchants, there and elsewhere, often determined the
farming decisions of peasants, since they were the ones who advanced
seeds and implements. Interest rates between 12 and 24 percent were
typical, but could skyrocket to as much as 150 percent annually. In the
Çukurova sharecroppers drew on credit from landowners and merchants, who
charged interest rates of 15 to 20 percent, and as a result, “Merchant
capital, despite the limitations of labor scarcity, gained control over
the land and the production process.”65</p>
<p>Thus by the end of the nineteenth century most of the world’s cotton
would be grown by cultivators who worked their own or rented land with
family labor, but instead of subsistence or local production, these
cultivators would be drawn into the global cotton market by a novel
infusion of metropolitan capital. Sharecropping, crop liens, and
powerful local merchants in control of capital would quickly become the
new normal, shaping a countryside of laborers who were not enslaved, but
not quite free either. These cotton farmers, the world over, would be
deeply enmeshed in debt, vulnerable to world market fluctuations,
generally poor, and subject to newly created vagrancy statutes and labor
contracts designed to keep them on the land. They would be politically
marginalized. And they would often be subject to extraeconomic coercion.
Such a system was not without precedent. But now, supercharged with
private capital and the state’s legal, administrative, and
infrastructure advances, it began to structure the global cotton-growing
countryside to an unprecedented extent.66</p>
<p>A small but growing number of rural cultivators, however, turned into
poorly paid wage workers in the world’s cotton fields. They were the
least powerful. Often their descent into wage work had been the result
of their worsening situation as highly indebted sharecroppers, tenants,
or owners of small farms. Becoming a wage worker was a measure of their
defeat. In Egypt, by 1907, nearly 40 percent of all agriculturalists had
become landless laborers. In India as well, the number of wage workers
on cotton lands tended to increase across the nineteenth century: In
Khandesh, the greater orientation toward cotton agriculture and the
attendant legal and social changes resulted in an ever-increasing
percentage of land devoted to the white gold and a wave of
proletarianization, so that by 1872 one in four adult men worked for
wages.67</p>
<p>In northern Mexico too, proletarianization swept the cotton fields.
After 1884, landowners in La Laguna made use of new railroads and a new
irrigation infrastructure to build a huge cotton-growing complex,
“making it Mexico’s most important commercial agricultural area.” Tens
of thousands of workers populated the fields, some residing on
plantations and others hired by the week or month, as the rural
population, many of them migrants from elsewhere in Mexico, increased
from twenty thousand to two hundred thousand between 1880 and 1910, with
an additional forty thousand migrant workers arriving during harvest
time. As a result, the cotton farms expanded at breakneck speed,
increasing production by a factor of five in the ten years before 1890,
and then doubling in the next decade. Some of these haciendas were
extremely large. The Luján family, for example, owned forty-five
thousand hectares. These industrial outposts were often highly
mechanized, sporting presses, gins, and cotton oil mills.68</p>
<p>La Laguna cotton workers were as completely proletarianized as any in
the world. Some plantations maintained a force of semiskilled workers,
organized into gangs of eight to twelve, led by a foreman who took
responsibility for cultivating specific lots. Some large haciendas had
recruited several thousand such workers, who worked twelve hours a day
six days a week. These workers joined the agricultural proletariat
because they had lost their erstwhile communal access to the resources
of the land due to the concentration of landownership. Many of these
workers eventually arrived in La Laguna on private rail lines, packed
like cattle in boxcars. Since there was no land available for these
migrants, there was no possibility of engaging in subsistence
agriculture.69</p>
<p>Instead, “The landlord’s rule was law,” observes one historian, as
haciendas enforced labor discipline with the help of uniformed private
police forces, jails, and the “physical punishment” of workers. Some
plantations even built a cepo de campaña—a specially made “cage…to
punish troublesome workers.” Migrant workers were often supervised by
armed guards stationed in the fields. The state helped to enforce labor
discipline, with towns enacting “strict vagrancy laws to keep [those
workers] outside the central area when they were not working.” This
resort to physical coercion was widespread in the world’s cotton-growing
areas and was important in the United States, Peru, Egypt, and
elsewhere. Capitalism’s awe-inspiring advances continued to rest not
just on a great variety of labor regimes, but on a staggering degree of
violence.70</p>
<p>Controlling labor: Armed guards secure cotton-picking labor in La
Laguna, Mexico. (illustration credit 10.6)</p>
<p>Within that reconstructed empire of cotton, the newly empowered
states of Europe and North America were everywhere. After all, the
capitalists’ project of accumulation by securing labor and the
bureaucrats’ project of state formation by controlling populations
evolved hand in hand.71 In their struggles at home, in the heartlands of
industrial capitalism, cotton capitalists had learned that to transform
the countryside, to transform society, they must reinforce their wealth
with state power. Enabled by the new bureaucratic, legal, military, and
infrastructural capacity of states, a capacity that had directly grown
from the wages of war capitalism, manufacturers and merchants
incorporated ever more people and ever more areas of the world into the
global economy in general, and in the production of cotton for world
markets in particular.</p>
<p>By the late nineteenth century, the dynamics of industrial capitalism
had accelerated to such an extent that capitalists and statesmen made a
concerted effort to speed up the collapse of noncapitalist social
formations, or at the very least to connect them to the capitalist world
market. To break the reluctance of people to embrace these new and
revolutionary arrangements of work and social relations, they at times
embraced coercion. They were unwilling to wait, as cotton manufacturer
Henry Ashworth had put it so well in front of the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce in 1863, “until price has done it.” For labor to be turned into
a commodity, workers had to be “liberated” from the matrix of mutual
obligations that had historically sustained them. They believed, at the
same time, that land had to be “liberated” from noneconomic ties and
made into a freely marketable commodity. This “liberation” rested
ideologically on the naturalizing of certain historically specific ways
of organizing production, and was thus enabled by economic, social,
cultural, and even racial hierarchies it had helped to produce.
Capitalists were the age’s true revolutionaries.72</p>
<p>Rulers and bureaucrats supported this project because securing access
to raw materials, including extracting cotton, became increasingly a
touchstone of national politics. As they consolidated their states, the
rearrangement of global economic connections in fact became a project
they deliberately embarked upon—indeed, the late-nineteenth-century
acceleration of global economic integration went hand in hand with a
strengthening and consolidation of nation-states themselves. Powerful
states, rulers, and bureaucrats depended on strong national industries,
which in turn depended on raw materials and markets—for such industries
produced wealth that could be taxed, and provided employment for
millions, all of which in turn increased social stability and further
strengthened the state.73</p>
<p>The construction of markets, including global markets, was thus a
political process. As more and more states competed for access to raw
materials, labor, and markets, this political process was ever more
framed by nation-states. National economies, empires, and national
capitalists became increasingly the basic building blocks of the new
global political economy. As the colonial world became an important
supplier of raw materials and a significant market for some industries
(up to 60 percent of British cotton goods exports, for example, went to
India and the Far East), industrial capitalism took on a new cast, with
states securing political control over territories that provided raw
materials and markets. One-quarter of the globe “was distributed or
redistributed as colonies” between 1876 and 1915, testifying to the
rapidly growing importance of bounded territory. Statesmen and
capitalists in effect fused their respective goals of power and
accumulation, and in the process forged an entirely new form of
capitalist globalization. The methods of industrial capitalism,
developed in the world of factory production in England and elsewhere,
now went global, increasingly replacing the true-and-tried methods of
war capitalism.74</p>
<p>Ironically, the project to strengthen newly consolidating
nation-states and “national” economies increasingly also became an
international project, best symbolized by the international cotton
congresses that met regularly starting after 1905, bringing together
merchants, manufacturers, planters, and bureaucrats in places such as
Manchester, Vienna, Paris, Brussels, Milan, London, Stockholm, and
Alexandria. By 1927, seventeen countries participated. They discussed
cotton-growing conditions in various parts of the world, and tried to
identify best practices. They also reviewed exemplary efforts to
increase cotton production, discussing, for example, in great detail the
German experiences with cotton agriculture in colonial Togo. The
congresses were part and parcel of a global discourse among capitalists
and bureaucrats on how to reconcile the needs of metropolitan economies
for cheap and plentiful agricultural commodities from the periphery with
new forms of labor. In Paris, the experts at the Ministry of Colonies
constituted a commission aptly named the “Commission du Régime du
Travail aux Colonies,” in Berlin and Chicago budding social scientists
explored the possibilities of “free labor” regimes in securing access to
agricultural commodities, and the Spanish ambassador to Paris asked the
French minister of the colonies to report on the French experience with
emancipation and its effect on labor supply. The British colonial
authorities in Bombay inquired into the mobilization of labor in Russian
Central Asia. And in the 1910s, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and
Commerce, set on expanding cotton production in colonial Korea,
investigated the efforts of European nations to use “free labor” for the
growing of cotton in their colonial possession. Postcolonial and
postcapitalist regimes, as we will see, were just as eager to learn from
these experiences, and often implemented these lessons with an eager
radicalism that overshadowed even their teachers’ revolutionary designs.
As competitive nation-states strengthened in a few regions of the world,
they shared a burning wish to reconstruct the global countryside, and
embedded their policies in strategies transcending any particular
nation-state. Again, state formation and globalization unfolded hand in
glove.75</p>
<p>And while the dilemmas of “free labor” would remain central to global
conversations, by the 1870s, from the perspective of cotton capitalists,
the crisis of the empire of cotton that had emerged from the
emancipation of cotton growing workers had been resolved. The newfound
ability of capitalists and states to transform the global cotton-growing
countryside with the tools of industrial capitalism allowed for ever
more cotton to arrive at ever cheaper prices in the ports of Liverpool,
Bremen, Le Havre, Osaka, and Boston. So successful was the recombination
of labor, land, capital, and state power that cotton prices in Liverpool
not only returned to pre–Civil War levels, but fell further. In 1870, a
pound of cotton in the United States had cost 24 cents; in 1894, that
price had fallen to just 7 cents—below its cost before the Civil War
(when it was about 11 cents.) In response, the Manchester Cotton Supply
Association, which had been at the forefront of much of the push to make
peasants the world over into cotton growers for export, disbanded in
1872. The defeat of the economic and political aspirations of
freedpeople in the American South and the successful inventions of new
systems of labor there and elsewhere had inspired confidence that the
revolutionary activities of capital would continue to succeed in
recasting the global countryside.76</p>
