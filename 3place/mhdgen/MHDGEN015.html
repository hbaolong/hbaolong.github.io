Thirteen The Return of the Global South</h4>
<p>The rise of the South: cotton mill near Petropolis, Brazil, c. 1922
(illustration credit 13.1)</p>
<p>Sprawling along the shores of the river Sabarmati near India’s
western coast, Ahmedabad today is a bustling metropolis of 6 million
people. It is Gujarat’s most important city. But just a century and a
half ago, it was still essentially a medieval town with “its old
institutions…flourishing; the sarafs and mahajans…dominat[ing] trade and
industry; the ancient crafts…the basis of its prosperity; and its
imports and exports mov[ing] on pack animals along the narrow unpaved
lanes, flanked by high, unpainted wooden houses, and through the guarded
gates in its walls.” All that changed, however, with the unprecedented
profits and productivity of a new wave of Indian cotton manufacturing.
On May 30, 1861, Ranchhodlal Chhotalal ordered steam-powered spinning
machines into motion for the first time in the city’s history. A few
years earlier, the youthful Chhotalal had floated the idea of creating a
spinning mill while working as a clerk in a government office. Inspired
by the opening of cotton mills in Bombay, he understood that the new
technology might radically recast India’s industry. Not discouraged by a
general lack of enthusiasm among Ahmedabad’s commercial classes, he
eventually found some merchants and bankers to back his venture. The
novel machinery was ordered from Great Britain, complete with a team of
British mechanics; after several months Chhotalal’s spinning machines
arrived in a lurching processional of bullock carts.1</p>
<p>In May 1861, sixty-five Shapur Mill workers set twenty-five hundred
spindles in motion. While this was but a hobby shop in size, even by
contemporary Bombay standards, one fact made it a lighthouse of future
investment: The factory was profitable right from the beginning. By
early 1865 Chhotalal had hired an additional 235 workers and expanded
the mill to ten thousand spindles, and also added one hundred power
looms.2</p>
<p>Ahmedabad’s spectacular rise as one of the world’s prime cotton
manufacturing locales was only partly due to these cutting-edge British
machines. The new enterprises drew deeply from Ahmedabad’s long history
in cottons. Local merchants, organized in guilds, had for many centuries
engaged in the long-distance trade in cottons. Some had accumulated
significant amounts of capital in the process, and when the British took
over the city from the Marathas in 1818, those merchants continued to
play a prominent role in local and long-distance trade. Even after
British cotton yarns began to arrive in large quantities by the 1830s,
displacing local handicraft manufacturers, many of these merchants
incorporated foreign-made yarn into their operations, continuing to
finance the domestic weaving sector.3</p>
<p>Despite Chhotalal’s early success and the region’s cotton history,
most of the merchants and traditional business classes of Ahmedabad
remained reluctant to invest in further mills, content for the time
being with high rates of return on moneylending. The transformative wave
of cotton mill construction hit those shores only in the 1870s. By then,
the deepening crisis in the export-dependent countryside made
moneylending less certain, and capital-rich Ahmedadians turned to cotton
manufacturing. The Jain merchants Masukhbhai and Jamnabhai Bhagubhai
were the first members of Ahmedabad’s merchant class to take the plunge.
In 1877, they opened the Gujarat Spinning and Weaving Company with
11,561 spindles and 209 looms. In quick order, other merchant families,
increasingly shut out of transoceanic trade, followed suit. As in Europe
a few decades earlier, old commercial capital was now reinvested in
textile manufacturing, soon accounting for the vast majority of
investments. And as in the Alsatian city of Mulhouse and elsewhere,
these investors were tightly linked to one another. Vaishnav Vanias and
Jains dominated the industry. Members of these castes institutionalized
their social connections through organizations such as the Jain
Conference and the Gujarat Vaishya Sabha, among whose leaders were the
city’s mill owners.4 Thanks to the entrepreneurial capital of
Ahmedabad’s merchants, by 1918, fifty-one cotton mills dotted the banks
of the Sabarmati and thirty-five thousand laborers streamed each morning
through their gates and toiled relentlessly to turn these investments
into profits.</p>
<p>Soon the world was full of such Manchesters, as the growth of the
cotton empire went along with its continued movement. The spatial
arrangements of the global cotton industry—and with it, of
capitalism—were in constant flux. Not only was cotton being grown in new
parts of the world, but increasingly it was being spun, woven, and
finished in new parts of the world as well. The days of a cotton empire
led by the North Atlantic countries were numbered.</p>
<p>Most precipitous was the declining importance of cotton manufacturing
in the United Kingdom. In 1860, 61 percent of the world’s mechanical
spindles had turned there, but by 1900 that percentage had declined to
43 percent and by 1930 to 34 percent. Thanks to workers’ struggles for
better working conditions, British machines also operated for fewer
hours than machines elsewhere. They were also generally older, and thus
their share of global output was even smaller, just 11 percent by 1932.
The interwar years in particular were an “almost unmitigated disaster”
for the British industry, once the workshop of the world, with cotton
textiles its leading export. Shipments to Asia, Britain’s most important
market, collapsed after World War I, with exports to India declining by
46 percent from prewar years, to the Dutch East Indies by 55 percent,
and to China by 59 percent. As a result, the British industry began its
painful dissolution not simply in relative terms in a growing world
economy, but eventually in real losses: 43 percent of all British looms
disappeared between 1919 and 1939, along with 41 percent of its mule
spindles between 1926 and 1938, and the number of cotton workers fell by
45 percent between 1920 and 1939.5</p>
<p>As Britain’s industry began to lose its global predominance,
continental Europe and the United States retained until 1930 their
global share of cotton spindles, at 30 and 20 percent respectively. Yet
the reign of these North Atlantic countries in the cotton empire would
eventually be cut short by the slower but inexorable rise of the
mechanized cotton industry in the vast global South. Indeed, by the
1920s the cotton factories of New England “experienced a collapse…even
more thorough-going” then the ones of old England. Among the usurpers,
Japan was by far the most impressive. In 1880 the country had a mere
eight thousand cotton spindles. By 1930, Japan put 7 million spindles in
motion, at which point its share of spindles globally was 4.3 percent,
just behind Germany (6.7 percent), France (6.2 percent), and Russia (4.6
percent). Japan by 1920 counted only 6.7 percent as many spindles as
Great Britain, but by 1937 that number had skyrocketed to 32 percent. It
was also the largest investor in cotton production in China, where the
industry expanded rapidly from just under a million spindles in 1908 to
nearly 4 million in 1930. India was in a similar position, although it
started from a slightly stronger base: from 1.6 million spindles in
1877, rising to nearly 9 million in 1930. By the twentieth century, the
Asian cotton industry had turned into the world’s fastest-growing, as
the world’s cotton industry returned to where it had largely
originated.6</p>
<p>Cotton, while becoming clearly less important to the global economy
in an age of vast steel mills, chemical plants, and electrical machinery
industries, went through a significant geographic shift, foreshadowing,
as it had a century before, the next phase of global capitalism. While
many mid-nineteenth-century Europeans had persuaded themselves that the
wonders of modern industry were reserved to them because of such
unchangeable factors as the local climate and geography, their superior
religious beliefs and “culture,” or even their “racial” characteristics,
the geographic shifts of the world’s first modern industry showed anyone
willing to see that essentializing the particular global geography of a
particular moment in the history of capitalism was nothing but a
self-serving justification for global inequality. The history of the
empire of cotton, in fact, proved them wrong.</p>
<p>This rise of cotton manufacturers in the global South resulted from a
shift in the balance of social power in both the heartland of industrial
capitalism and its periphery. Industrial capitalism had altered class
structures not only in Europe and North America, but also in the global
South, which witnessed the rise of new inequalities in state strength
and wealth. Two groups played a decisive role in this century-long
story: workers in Europe and the northeastern United States, and
aspiring cotton capitalists in the global South. They contributed
independently to a pair of mutually reinforcing processes: nationalizing
social conflicts and strengthening states. As workers organized across
the United States and Europe, their collective action increased labor
costs. This made low-wage producers elsewhere competitive on global
markets, even though those operations were often less efficient. At the
same time, capitalists in the global South supported state policies
conducive to their own project of domestic industrialization. They could
also draw on a pool of low-wage workers, many of whom had been displaced
by the rapid transformation of the countryside. This combination of huge
wage differentials and the construction of activist states shifted the
geography of global cotton manufacturing more rapidly than most
observers thought possible. In short, assertive northern workers and
politically sophisticated southern capitalists changed the shape of the
empire of cotton, foreshadowing the new global division of labor so
familiar today.7</p>

<p>As collective action of cotton workers in Europe and New England
began to affect the global geography of cotton manufacturing, their
efforts mirrored an equally profound shift of the nineteenth century:
the individual and collective action of slaves and freedpeople, whose
struggles had shifted the geography of cotton growing. Of course, cotton
manufacturing workers had acted collectively before the 1860s. But in
the late nineteenth century and thereafter, strikes, unions, and
working-class political parties mushroomed under the increasingly warm
light of the nation-state, and succeeded in creating much-improved
conditions for workers.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts city of Fall River, one of the United States’ most
important cotton manufacturing centers, is but one of many examples.
Early in the nineteenth century, easy access to waterpower had attracted
the attention of entrepreneurs to the region. In 1813, Dexter Wheeler
and his cousin David Anthony opened the “Fall River Manufactory,”
followed by numerous similar ventures. By 1837, the city boasted ten
cotton mills feeding on a workforce of sons and daughters from the local
countryside. Helped by easy shipping access to New York markets, Fall
River soon rose to become the nation’s leading producer of printed
cotton cloth. From 1865 to 1880, the number of factories in Fall River
increased fivefold; at the industry’s peak, around 1920, the city
counted 111 mills, one-eighth of the United States’ total spinning
capacity, and a textile workforce of some thirty thousand people, nearly
as many as in Ahmedabad.8</p>
<p>Workers in Fall River consistently organized to improve their wages
and working conditions. Thirteen major strikes occurred between 1848 and
1904. Some, like the 1865 mule spinners’ strike, involved only one
craft’s struggle for higher wages; others, like the 1904 strike, shut
down almost every mill in the city for months. In fact, Fall River
workers’ mounting militancy eventually impelled the Massachusetts Bureau
of Statistics of Labor to launch a formal investigation into the
question posed by an 1881 letter from a Massachusetts state
representative: “Why is it that the working people of Fall River are in
constant turmoil?”9</p>
<p>Workers’ militancy was in part driven by the conditions in which they
worked and lived. Cotton mills, just as in Ellen Hootton’s time a
century earlier, remained noisy, polluted, and dangerous places.
Factories, now often powered by steam instead of water, had increased in
size and often combined spinning and weaving operations. The movements
of bobbins and shuttles, power transmission belts, and metal parts
assaulted the ears of children, women, and men, cotton dust filled the
air and their lungs, and all too often pieces of clothing, hair, or
limbs got stuck in machines, grotesquely injuring workers. The workday
was harshly regimented and seemingly unending, providing spinners and
weavers with little time off. The effects of such work regimes continued
to be profound: Among the textile workers of the German city of Aachen,
for example, an estimated half of all children died before celebrating
their first birthday, an unusually high rate of child mortality. Even
during relatively prosperous times, workers suffered subsistence wages
and wretched, congested housing. An 1875 Massachusetts Bureau of
Statistics of Labor investigation, for example, found one unskilled
laborer in Fall River with a family of seven living on a yearly salary
of 95.20—below subsistence levels—supplemented by the wages of his
twelve-year-old daughter who worked beside him in the mill. His family
lived in an “out of repair” five-room tenement “in the worst part of the
city.” They were in debt, and the only ray of hope was that the next
summer would see another child coming of age to send into the mills
alongside father and daughter.10</p>
<p>In response, Fall River’s cotton workers organized. Bolstered by the
transplanted cultures of working-class solidarity and militancy brought
across the Atlantic by British workers, their often militant strikes
allowed them to score a number of pathbreaking victories. In 1866, the
mule spinners’ union led a successful citywide drive for a ten-hour
workday. In 1886, that same union secured a wide-ranging agreement to
set the wages of New Bedford, Fall River, and Lawrence spinners on a
“sliding scale” based on the price of cotton measured against the
selling price of print cloth. In the fallout of the citywide 1904
strike, Fall River mills also accepted the demands of weavers’ unions
for a sliding scale wage agreement. As early as the 1890s, the city’s
skilled textile workers began taking an interest in national union
organization, and over the next half a century Fall River workers joined
or created various regional labor organizations.11</p>
<p>Moreover, Fall River’s cotton workers along with their New England
counterparts succeeded in improving their wages and working conditions,
at least in part because as citizens of the United States they enjoyed
political influence. Most important, they translated their right to vote
into improvements in the workplace. In Fall River and elsewhere, unions
and strikes became factors in politics, as it was all but impossible for
the government to ignore the demands of enfranchised and mobilized
workers.</p>
<p>And Fall River’s story was far from exceptional. In France during the
early twentieth century, the number of strikes among its approximately
165,000 cotton workers increased rapidly. In 1909, for example, a
particularly strike-prone year, there were 198 such strikes with more
than thirty thousand participants. Unions also became a growing force in
French politics.12</p>

<p>In the German industry cotton workers as early as the 1840s had
organized collectively. By the early twentieth century, about 25 percent
of them were unionized, and in some areas, such as Saxony, the
percentage was even higher. These workers were unusually political—in
Saxony’s cotton industry, for example, “the socialists rule almost
unchallenged.” One of German social democracy’s greatest figures, August
Bebel, was elected to the Reichstag with the votes of the weavers of
Glauchau-Meerane, and the 1869 founding of the Sozialdemokratische
Arbeiterpartei (SPD) had strong support in the textile areas of Saxony
and Thuringia.13</p>
<p>In Russia, nearly half a million cotton textile workers came to play
a key political role as well, especially during the revolutionary
upheavals of 1905 and 1918–19, building on many decades of union
activities and strikes. The first major strike occurred in the Russian
cotton industry in May 1870 at the Nevsky spinning mill in Saint
Petersburg, when eight hundred workers left their machines. Two years
later, five thousand workers walked out of the Kreenholm cotton mill.
Between 1870 and 1894, a total of eighty-five strikes occurred in the
cotton textile industry, with 53,341 workers participating; between 1895
and 1900, 139,154 workers participated in 188 such strikes. During the
huge 1905 strike wave, workers took part in 1,008 walkouts, succeeding
in improving working conditions, shortening the workday, and gaining
higher wages. Further waves of cotton workers’ strikes hit the Russian
industry in 1912 with 135,000 cotton workers, in 1913 with 180,000
workers, and 1914 with 233,000 workers participating, with some of these
strikes taking on overtly political tones. When cotton workers’ strikes
broke out again in 1917, they became a central part of the revolutionary
turmoil of that year.14</p>
<p>In Switzerland, cotton workers mobilized, albeit less dramatically
than in Russia, in the late nineteenth century. In 1908 they created the
national Schweizerische Textilarbeiterverband (STAV), the Swiss union of
textile workers, which fought for improved working conditions and higher
wages and embraced socialist ideas. In Catalonia, socialists and
anarchists dominated many mills, with the cotton industry rocked by
frequent confrontations between owners and well-organized workers, with
massive strikes in 1890 for shorter hours, with bombings of mill owners’
houses, and, in 1909, during the Setmana Tràgica, with violent
insurrection in Barcelona. In the Dutch industry, many strikes occurred
around the turn of the century, and in its center, Twente, 60 percent of
cotton workers had organized in unions by 1929.15</p>
<p>Lancashire, the heartland of the global cotton industry, witnessed
the influence and national scope of unions earlier than anywhere else,
and served as an inspiration and a source of organizers for cotton
workers in other parts of the world, including Fall River. Unions had
created national organizations in spinning by 1870 (the Amalgamated
Spinners Association), and in 1884, in weaving (the Amalgamated Weavers
Association). The Trade Union Congress, bringing British unions together
in all sectors of the economy, had been created two years earlier. The
spinners’ union, which organized the most highly skilled workers in
spinning mills, had by the 1880s organized almost 90 percent of all
workers, making it perhaps “the most powerful union in the world.” They
succeeded in raising wages, improving working conditions, and managing
technological development. The Spinners were among the “best organized
and best-financed workers’ organizations in Britain,” and they extracted
premium wages and captured a large portion of the increasing
productivity of the industry from the 1880s to the 1920s. The Cardroom
Workers and Weavers, larger, more diffuse, and less committed to
exclusive craft practices, also won significant gains for workers.
According to a study of data from 1890, the union wage premium for
skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers in cotton textiles was
around 12 percent, a significant margin, providing material rewards for
the unionized workers of the cotton districts. The working conditions
were still hot and humid and the hours long and hard, but militant,
massive, and disciplined collective action from the cotton workers
managed to force employers into sharing the profits from increasing
industrial productivity.16</p>
<p>The mobilization of cotton workers did not in all cases succeed in
improving local working and living conditions, but collectively, workers
of these North Atlantic nations reduced their hours of work, improved
working conditions, increased their wages, and won political
influence—often with the tacit support of strengthening states that were
above all concerned with social stability and under pressure from
politically mobilized and at times enfranchised workers. This trend was
magnified by the tendency of wages to roughly converge within national
economies, which allowed even less well organized cotton workers to
benefit from the collective mobilizations of other groups of
workers.17</p>
<p>As a result, workers in western and northern Europe and the
northeastern parts of the United States spent less and less time at
work. Cotton workers in the Saxon town of Crimmitschau demanded in 1903,
“An hour for us! An hour for our family! An hour to live!” And even if
all too often their demands were unsuccessful, over the years they
managed to decrease their working hours from an annual average of 3,190
hours in 1865 to 2,475 hours in 1913. In France, labor legislation in
1892 restricted women to the eleven-hour workday, to be reduced further
in subsequent years. In January 1919 the Spanish government gave cotton
workers the eight-hour day.18</p>
<p>As hours declined, wages increased. In Germany, spinners in 1865 had
been paid an average of 390 marks per year. In 1913 they made 860 marks
annually, or, in real terms, 53 percent more. In Alsace, there was also
a “remarkable” increase of wages between 1870 and 1913. Mulhousian mule
spinners had made between 40 and 48 francs every two weeks in 1870, but
took home 65 to 75 francs in 1910, which in real terms equaled a
doubling of their wages. In Rhode Island, hourly wages of male weavers
climbed from 13.5 cents an hour in 1890 to 59.8 cents by 1920; for
loom-fixers, wages rose from 18.4 cents an hour in 1890 to 79.1 in 1920.
Even doffers, unskilled laborers generally excluded from formal labor
organization, saw their wages rise. In 1890, the average male doffer
might expect a daily wage of 135 cents; by 1920, their wages had shot up
to 484 cents, an inflation-adjusted 50 percent rise, while the more
skilled loom-fixers saw a near doubling of their real wages.19</p>
<p>Workers not only improved their wages and working conditions through
collective action at the workplace, but they also succeeded in getting
newly strengthened nation-states to pass legislation that improved their
welfare. Germany enacted a whole slew of worker-friendly legislation:
When compulsory schooling came about after 1871, children under twelve
years could no longer work in factories, and the effective work time of
children under fourteen was thereby limited. Laws in 1910 stipulated
that women could not work more than ten hours on weekdays and eight
hours on Saturdays, while children under thirteen were now not allowed
to work at all. Massachusetts passed its first labor laws in 1836,
factory safety rules in 1877, and by 1898 outlawed night work for women
and minors, in effect closing factories at night. In Switzerland, as
elsewhere, labor laws increased labor costs, as already in 1877 the
maximum number of hours for textile workers was limited to eleven, night
work for women was outlawed, and child labor for workers under fourteen
was declared illegal.20</p>
<p>After World War I taxes on employers also surged, demonstrating that
the administrative, judicial, and military capacity of the state, so
vital for industrial capitalism, came at a rising cost. Indeed, the
tensions that led to war in the first place had emerged from the
tightening connections between national capital, nation-states, and
national territories. The competition between increasingly powerful
states rested on the mobilization of their citizens into mass armies and
the marshaling of taxes to fund those armies and produce war materials.
Under such pressures to extract money and people, states were forced to
legitimize themselves democratically.</p>
<p>For European and North American capitalists, this dependence on
powerful states—the principal source of their strength—was now also
their single greatest weakness, because these states in effect enabled
working-class power on the shop floor and in politics. From the
perspective of capitalists, indeed, the state was Janus-faced. It
enabled the emergence of industrial capitalism, including the
mobilization of labor in the global countryside, but it also “trapped”
capitalists, as workers would use access to national politics to better
their working conditions and wages. As a result, social conflicts that
had once been primarily global (as when the mobilization of slaves in
Saint-Domingue affected the interests of cotton manufacturers in
Britain), or local (as when Indian peasants refused to labor on British
cotton plantations), now increasingly became national.</p>
<p>Rising production costs in the core areas of the Industrial
Revolution in Britain, continental Europe, and North America, along with
unrelenting price competition, in turn dimmed the once blazing
profitability of cotton manufacturing. From 1890, northern manufacturers
in the United States complained about falling profits. One author
reports that dividend payments in German cotton spinning corporations
hovered between just 4 and 6 percent between 1900 and 1911, a far cry
from the profits that British entrepreneurs had depended on a century
earlier. In the Oldham and Rochdale spinning industry, the very heart of
Lancashire, average return on capital was low: 3.85 percent from 1886 to
1892, 3.92 percent from 1893 to 1903, rising to 7.89 percent from 1904
to 1910. British cotton capitalists, spoiled by decades of enormous
profits, experienced during the 1920s a “rapid fall in spinning company
profits.”21</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, manufacturers responded to rising wages
by investing in improved production techniques. New spinning machines
and looms allowed for greater output per worker, and in Germany, for
example, productivity in spinning more than tripled between 1865 and
1913, and in weaving increased by a factor of six. Such productivity
advances meant that wages formed a diminishing portion of total
production costs. In German spinning, the share of wages fell from 78
percent of total costs in 1800 to 39 percent in 1913, and in weaving,
less dramatically, from 77 to 57 percent.</p>
<p>But in the face of manufacturers’ inability to manipulate the price
of other inputs, especially raw cotton, wage costs continued to remain
important, and thus had a significant impact on profitability. After
all, as of 1910, Chinese wages were just 10.8 percent of those in Great
Britain and 6.1 percent of those prevalent in the United States, while
Chinese workers also labored nearly twice as many hours as their New
England counterparts—5,302 hours versus 3,000 hours. Such low-wage
competition was found in even more places and it mattered. By the 1920s,
for example, competition from Czech and Russian producers proved to be a
threat to the German cotton industry. In the long run, cotton
manufacturing became a “race to the bottom.”22</p>
<p>Manufacturers tried to respond to such pressures by using their
access to ever more powerful governments to insulate their respective
national industries from global competition. Germany’s cotton industry
depended on an intricate tariff regime catering to the very specific
needs of very specific sectors of its cotton industry. As manufacturers
organized (in 1870, for example, the Verein Süddeutscher
Baumwollindustrieller was founded), they successfully lobbied the state
to support their interests, with the Deutsche Volkswirthschaftliche
Correspondenz arguing that tariff protections were the only means by
which the German industry could survive the pressures of imports—a
benefit not available to Indian, Chinese, or Egyptian manufacturers.
Such tariff protections were important elsewhere too. Italy effectively
protected its home market with tariffs on cotton goods passed in 1878
and 1888. In France, at the behest of its cotton manufacturers,
increasingly protectionist tariffs had fueled cotton industry profits
since the 1880s, especially since 1892 with the passing of the Méline
Tariff.23 The United States also saw the strengthening of its
protectionist regime in the last half of the nineteenth century. In
1861, the Morrill Tariff increased duties on imported cotton goods, and
while the Tariff Act of 1883 lowered tariffs on cheaper cottons
(qualities that American manufacturers could easily produce), it
increased them on higher qualities, a trend that continued with the
Tariff Act of 1890.</p>
<p>Imperial markets also became ever more important as the new
imperialism that had arisen out of the ashes of the nineteenth-century
“second slavery” now paid dividends—for some. It paid, for a while, for
Catalan manufacturers, who gained in the 1880s more protected access to
the remaining Spanish colonies, including a monopoly in the Cuban
market. It supported the interests of Russian cotton industrialists in
gaining access to the Central Asian territories. It protected British
manufacturers from Indian competition. Even in the United States,
following the demands of cotton manufacturers such as Edward Atkinson,
the government aggressively helped manufacturers gain access to markets
abroad, especially in Latin America, the destination of half of U.S.
cotton exports.24</p>
<p>Despite the frantic efforts of European and New England cotton
manufacturers to secure their exalted position within the global empire
of cotton, rising labor costs were a powerful countervailing force. The
result of the opportunities and constraints created by the
nationalization of both labor and capital, rising labor costs opened up
new possibilities for manufacturing in those parts of the world in which
labor was cheaper and less constrained by state regulations.</p>
<p>As a result, the global South welcomed back home the world’s cotton
industry in the twentieth century, reversing a century-long departure.
At first that move was hardly perceptible, and as late as 1900 was not
much more than a flicker on the horizon, but by the 1920s it was the
object of widespread debate—a debate, especially in Great Britain and
New England, with alarmist undertones.25 To take but one example, the
Times of London reported in 1927 on</p>
<p>the worst spell of bad trade [Lancashire’s industry] has encountered
since the appalling cotton famine of the sixties, which was caused by
the American Civil War…. The chief factor in this alarming decline has
been the falling off of the great markets of the Far East—India, China,
andandandandc…. Whereas in 1913 the Far East absorbed 61.6 per cent of
our total exports of piece goods, the percentage had fallen in 1925 to
41.8…. Both in India and in China there has been a very large increase
in home production, and in both countries the rapidly expanding Japanese
industry—which has so far been working on the two-shift basis with a
120-hour week, as opposed to Lancashire’s maximum of 48—has tended to
displace imports from Great Britain.26</p>
<p>At about the same time, the governor of Massachusetts, James Michael
Curley, forecasted accurately the complete destruction of the New
England cotton industry in the absence of massive federal intervention.
As local industry representatives concocted in 1935 a “Buy American-Made
Goods” campaign to undercut the threat of Japanese imports, Curley met
with cotton manufacturers presenting plans to slash wages in
Massachusetts in an effort to narrow the gaping wage differential
between the American North and South. Despite such protests, the North
Atlantic moment in cottons was over, its vaunted productivity and state
sponsors no match for the precipitous wage differentials and the
burgeoning nation-states of the global South.27</p>
<p>The move of cotton manufacturing into the global South began, as had
so many of the industry’s disruptions, in the United States. Unlike
Europe, its working class was never nationalized to the same degree.
Labor markets in the United States were highly segmented, with huge
differences in wages in its own national territory. As a result of the
peculiar settlement between the expropriated slave owners and industrial
capitalism after the Civil War, the United States had a global South
within its own territory. And the United States also had its own class
of global South capitalists who had, just like their Indian
counterparts, accumulated wealth in the trade of raw cotton, ready to
move some of it into manufacturing enterprises. The exceptional
combination of extensive territory and limited political, economic, and
social integration between North and South was the envy of European
capitalists—and the first harbinger of the global fate of European
cotton manufactures as well.28</p>
<p>The empire strikes back: Mahatma Gandhi visits Lancashire, chatting
with British cotton workers, 1931.</p>
<p>By 1910, the cotton manufacturing industry of the U.S. South was the
world’s third largest, after that of Great Britain and the northern
states of the Union. This was an amazing departure. At the end of the
Civil War there had been hardly any significant cotton manufacturing in
the states of the former Confederacy, and as late as 1879 there were
seventeen times as many spindles in the North than in the South. Then,
however, growth rates in the South skyrocketed—during the 1880s, to an
annual 17.6 percent, during the 1890s to 19.1 percent, and to 14.3
percent during the 1900s. To be sure, the cotton industry in the
northern states of the Union continued to grow as well, but it did so at
a distinctly slower rate of around 4 percent per year. By the 1920s, the
northern industry, for the first time, actually shrunk, and by 1925 the
U.S. South had more spindles than the North. By 1965, the ratio was 24
to 1, a radical reversal of fortunes.29</p>
<p>The massive relocation into the southern United States had begun,
decades earlier, at the Atlanta International Cotton Exposition of 1881.
There, cotton machinery was sold to the “Exposition Cotton Mills,” which
became in fact a functioning mill. Endowed with huge supplies of cheap
labor and supportive local and regional governments, budding local
manufacturers opened additional mills in short order. Lax labor laws,
low taxes, low wages, and the absence of trade unions made the South
alluring to cotton manufacturers, a region of the United States,
according to an industry publication, “where the labor agitator is not
such a power, and where the manufacturers are not constantly harassed by
new and nagging restrictions.” As a result, the period from 1922 to 1933
saw the closing of some ninety-three Massachusetts cotton mills; in the
six years after 1922 alone, Massachusetts would come to shed some 40
percent of its total textile workforce. In Fall River, in the decade
after 1920, half of the city’s mills disappeared.30</p>
<p>It was not the proximity to cotton fields that explains this sudden
expansion of cotton manufacturing in the U.S. South. Indeed, the
slightly lower costs in accessing cotton were offset by the cost of
shipping finished goods to northern markets. The secret of success was
plentiful and cheap labor. The destruction of slavery and the attendant
transformation of the countryside had created a large and malleable pool
of low-wage workers for the cotton factories, at first mostly white
rural workers, who had once been tenant farmers, and later African
American workers, most of them former sharecroppers. As one contemporary
observed, southern cotton growers left the farms “like rats leaving a
sinking ship.” As a result, a 1922 study by the Massachusetts Department
of Labor and Industries revealed that whereas the average hourly wage of
a Massachusetts mill worker was 41 cents, the going rate was 29 cents in
North Carolina, 24 cents in Georgia, 23 cents in South Carolina, and a
mere 21 cents in Alabama.31</p>
<p>The low wages paid to these workers were even lower because cotton
mills could draw on a large number of very young and very cheap
workers—a direct result of the low level of national integration of the
American working class. In 1905, 23 percent of all workers in southern
cotton mills were younger than sixteen, compared to only 6 percent in
the northern states. Thanks to the absence of national standards, people
also worked longer hours in the South—sixty-four hours per week, even
seventy-five hours, was not uncommon. In fact, cotton industrialists’
influence over southern state governments—and the disenfranchisement of
large segments of the local working class that began during the
1880s—allowed for much laxer labor laws than in other states of the
Union, a defining characteristic of emerging cotton industries
throughout the global South. Cotton industrialization, moreover, had
strong backing from state governments, whose legislators and governors
were vulnerable to the enormous influence and power of organized
industrialists.32</p>
<p>Aware of their own rising costs and declining profits, cotton
capitalists in Europe also sought to relocate to places with lower wage
costs. But none were able to follow directly the U.S. model, because no
other industrial country contained within itself such uneven regional
conditions or the legacy of slavery. Still, there were some tentative
British investments, such as in India. Other British firms invested in
manufacturing in the Ottoman Empire, especially around Izmir and
Istanbul, and in Portugal and Russia. In China, foreign-owned mills
became important, especially Japanese investments, but also a few
operated by English and German investors. In Egypt, British
entrepreneurs created in 1894 the Egyptian Cotton Manufacturing Company,
followed in 1899 by the Alexandria Anglo-Egyptian Spinning and Weaving
Company and then, a year later, the Cairo Egyptian Cotton Mills Limited.
French investments became important in the Mexican cotton industry. In
Brazil during the first decades of the twentieth century, British,
Belgian, and Dutch entrepreneurs opened mills. German textile
manufacturers as well invested in low-wage regions. One of the major
outlets for German cotton capital was Poland, especially the area around
Lodz that the chamber of commerce of the Saxon city of Leipzig called an
“offshoot of our German, especially Saxon, textile industry.” This
“Manchester of the East” experienced a huge boom between 1870 and 1914,
seeing the emergence of gigantic factories, such as Carl Scheibler’s
mill, with seventy-five hundred workers on its payroll.33</p>
<p>The global South, North Carolina, early twentieth century: “One of
the spinners in Whitnel Cotton Mill. She was 51 inches high. Has been in
the mill one year. Sometimes works at night…. When asked how old she
was, she hesitated, then said, ‘I don’t remember.’ ” (illustration

<p>Cotton industrialists in the former core manufacturing areas of
Europe and North America staggered, and then fell, under the combined
weight of the twin pressures of mobilized workers and democratic states.
They also, as capitalists, felt the pull of new investment opportunities
in new industries. Owners of capital in the global South, conversely,
awoke to the profit potential of industrial capitalism, and realized the
opportunity in their own backyards, their low-cost labor. These
entrepreneurs often found themselves surrounded by workers experienced
in textile production, had access to modern textile technology, and were
master manipulators of their home markets, having often sold imported
cotton wares for decades. Like the entrepreneurs of Ahmedabad, they
understood that to be profitable, industrial capitalism needed strong
states to build infrastructures, protect markets, enforce property
rights, and maintain an advantageous labor market. They encountered in
their state-building projects more and more activists who, with the rise
of national independence movements, appreciated the power latent in a
vibrant industrial economy. The model of industrial capitalism so
successfully forged in Europe and North America during the first decades
of the nineteenth century now took wing in the global South—tantalizing
the imagination of capitalists and state builders, and reshaping the
geography of the global economy.34</p>

(illustration credit 13.5)</p>
<p>Ideas about industrial capitalism, inspired by the British example,
had reached the far corners of the world already by the early nineteenth
century. During the cotton revolutions of Germany, Egypt, the United
States, and Mexico, forethinking statesmen and capitalists in each
country, including Friedrich List, Muhammad Ali, Tench Coxe, and Esteban
de Antuñano, had engaged in these discussions and drawn political
conclusions from them. By the late nineteenth century, others beyond
Europe took note as well. Faced by the pressures from imported cotton
wares on domestic handicraft industries and desiring to build an
industrial economy, Brazilian, Japanese, Chinese, and other statesmen
and capitalists searched for ways to replace imports with domestic
production, this time mixing a unique blend of state-building and
capital accumulation efforts.</p>
<p>The debate on how to withstand European imperialism and how to take
advantage of the new ways toward profit by building manufacturing
capacity spread around the world. As early as 1862, Chenk Kuan-ying, a
Chinese merchant, had published Sheng-shih wei-yen (Warnings to a
Seemingly Prosperous Age), advocating industrialization. Thirty-five
years later, entrepreneur Zhang Jian followed in his footsteps.
Concerned with huge imports of cotton yarn and cloth, and especially
with the stipulations of the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that allowed for
the establishment of foreign-owned cotton mills, he advocated domestic
industrialization, and, following words with deeds, built a spinning
factory in his native district of Nantong. “People,” he argued, “all say
that foreign nations maintain themselves through commerce. This is a
superficial view. They do not know that the foreign nations’ riches and
strength is industry…. Therefore we must concentrate with single purpose
to promote industry…. Factories should be set up to produce items of
foreign goods which have the greatest sale in China.”35</p>
<p>Zhang was part of a school of thinkers throughout the global South,
among them also Ch’en Chih and Hsueh Fu-ch’eng in China, who tried to
reenvision their nations’ roles in the global economy. They focused on
regaining domestic markets, undoing the process of deindustrialization,
introducing Western technology, and, like List, Ali, Coxe, and Antuñano,
coaxing the state into supporting industrialization. Arguing that
industrial progress equaled national progress, they wanted local
industries protected against imports. “The local production of coarse
cottons,” observed the Brazilian Associação Industrial in 1881, “is
being warred upon by foreign competitors and if legislative measures do
not come to the industry’s aid, all the effort and capital employed to
date will be wasted.” Referring explicitly to the protectionism of
Germany and the United States, they called upon the state to support
manufacturing in “young lands.” Cotton mills were no less than a
“patriotic undertaking.”36 Similarly, Inoue Shozo of Japan’s Industrial
Development Bureau concluded from a study trip to Germany in 1870
that</p>
<p>I want to make our country equal of Europe and America…. After having
read something of world history and geography in my search for the
source of wealth, the military power, the civilization, and the
enlightenment of present-day Western nations, I realized that the source
must lie in technology, industry, commerce, and foreign trade. In order
to apply these precepts and make the nation rich and strong, we must
first of all instruct the people about industry. Then we can manufacture
a variety of goods and export them, import those articles we lack, and
accumulate wealth from abroad.37</p>
<p>Zhang Jian, advocate of Chinese industrialization (illustration
credit 13.6)</p>
<p>Such ideas became a mainstay of anti-imperialist conversations, from
Japan to India, from West Africa to Southeast Asia. Strong
nation-states, these thinkers hoped, might one day protect domestic
manufacturers, build infrastructure, mobilize labor, and help
manufacturers capture export markets. There was no little irony in the
fact that anticolonial nationalism as often as not drew on the lessons
of colonialism itself.38</p>
<p>Yet putting such ideas into practice remained difficult. First,
budding industrialists had to gain control of the levers of state power,
overcoming competing elites. In the U.S. South, for example, cotton
manufacturers could dominate state governments only because of the loss
of power of slaveholding elites. In Brazil, Japan, and elsewhere, the
struggle against rival agrarian elites was far more protracted.</p>
<p>Brazil’s cotton industry, for example, unlike the region’s poster
child, Mexico, was weak until the 1890s, despite a significant market
for cotton goods, significant local capital accumulation, and large
foreign imports. In 1866, Brazil counted as few as nine spinning mills,
with a negligible 15,000 spindles as most textiles were either imported
or produced on plantations. The number of mills increased very slowly in
the following decades, but then it virtually exploded. By 1921, the
industry had 242 cotton mills with 1,521,300 spindles and 57,208 looms,
employing 108,960 workers. The industry continued to grow, and by 1927,
on the eve of the Depression, it consisted of 354 mills.39</p>
<p>The three decades after 1892 have been called the golden age of
Brazilian cotton manufacturing. It was in the wake of the abolition of
slavery in 1888 that manufacturing elites gained greater influence over
the government and managed to create policies conducive to their
interests, especially tariffs. In 1860, the tariff on cotton had been at
a low 30 percent of the value of imports, by 1880 it had doubled to
around 60 percent, and after drawn-out battles it increased to as much
as 100 percent in 1885. It rose further in 1886, 1889, and 1900. The
protectionist 1900 tariffs then remained in effect for three decades,
creating a protected market hugely profitable to manufacturers. As a
result, by 1920, 75 to 85 percent of all cotton goods used in Brazil
were spun and woven domestically. As an Englishman put it in 1921 with
some regret, “Twenty-five years ago Brazil was an excellent market for
Manchester…. First the grays dropped out, and now all these goods are
being manufactured in the country and only the very finest qualities
remain to be imported.”40</p>
<p>By the 1890s, Brazilian manufacturers had helped shape the state in
ways congenial to their interests. At the same time, unlike their
European and New England competitors, they retained access to extremely
cheap labor. The vast majority of workers came “from local orphanages,
foundling homes, and poorhouses, and from the unemployed urban classes
of the cities.” Children as young as ten, along with women, populated
the shop floors. As late as 1920, when the minimum legal age for
employment in mills had been raised to fourteen, children much younger
were found laboring in the mills and in some instances women and
children would work fourteen or even seventeen hours per day. As a
cynical contemporary observer saw it, Brazilian children gave a “few
years of their labor, at an age when character is forming and regular
habits of industry can be acquired.”41</p>
<p>After emancipation, Brazil’s cotton industry takes off: number of
spindles, 1866–1934. (illustration credit 13.7)</p>
<p>Cheap labor and tariffs combined with more dynamic markets. Slavery
had suppressed internal markets, as many plantations engaged in
production of rough textiles, and free-labor immigration had stagnated
because of competition from slave labor. Now huge numbers of immigrants
came into Brazil, and they, along with newly emancipated agricultural
workers, began to purchase textiles in domestic markets. As a result,
Brazil finally joined the region’s leading cotton producer, Mexico
(whose industry continued to expand in no small part due to a national
policy of protectionism), on the road to cotton industrialization. From
Brazil, the model spread to neighboring Argentina, which saw the opening
of its first cotton mill in 1906. There too, the promotion of cotton
industrialization became a deliberate project of the state.42</p>
<p>Japan experienced an even greater boom in cotton manufacturing.
Indeed, it was of such magnitude that Japan became in the course of just
a few decades the world’s dominant cotton manufacturing power.43 Japan’s
history shares some features with Brazil in the late nineteenth century:
Neither of these countries was subject to direct colonial rule, but they
were vulnerable to significant influences from abroad. They faced huge
cotton textile imports. Their economic elites were rooted in a political
economy radically different from that of domestic industrialization, but
those elites saw new elements emerging that altered the sources of their
income and the policy predilections of their class. At the turn of the
twentieth century, they were poised for a revolutionary transformation
of the state, made no less revolutionary by sharp differences in
outcomes.</p>
<p>Japan’s history of mechanical cotton production came later than
Brazil’s, but with equally inauspicious beginnings. In 1867, in
Kagoshima City in Kyushu, local rulers of the domain of Satsuma imported
six thousand spindles from England. Two other small factories opened
around the same time, one in Sakai and the other near Tokyo. Confronted
by a flood of imported yarn thanks to the forced opening of the Japanese
market by the Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858, none of these
pioneering projects succeeded commercially.44</p>
<p>Faced with these failures and an ever-rising tide of imported cotton
goods that had captured a third of the Japanese market, the government
began to take a more active role in promoting cotton industrialization.
The 1868 Meiji Restoration had brought a more centralized and
modernizing regime to power, concentrating the once dispersed powers
from the feudal domains of the Tokugawa samurai, whose system of
vandalage had dominated Japan for 270 years. From the 1870s, the new
nation-state began to pursue a more active policy to promote
industry—and cottons were foremost on the new rulers’ minds. A member of
the Diet, the Japanese parliament, explained: “Because Japanese are
clever and can work for cheap wages, they must buy simple goods from
abroad, add manual labor, and ship them abroad”—a project for which
cotton was superbly suited. The pressure of Western imperialism, as
elsewhere, had inspired manufacturing as a nationalist project.45</p>
<p>From 1879 to the mid-1880s, the minister of home affairs, Ito
Hirobumi, expanded domestic spinning capacity by organizing ten spinning
mills with two thousand spindles each, importing them from Great
Britain, and giving them on favorable terms to local entrepreneurs.
These mills failed as commercial enterprises because their scale of
production was too small to make them profitable. But unlike their
predecessors they introduced new policies that turned into the key
factors for the success of Japan’s industrialization: a switch to much
cheaper Chinese cotton (in lieu of domestically grown cotton);
experimental labor systems that would structure Japanese textile
industrialization long into the future (such as the day and night shift
system, which gave cost advantages over Indian competitors); and
encouragement of government managers to become entrepreneurs themselves.
These mills, moreover, created the “ideological roots” of low-wage,
harsh-labor regimes, drawing on women whose pay was below subsistence
levels, combined with a powerful rhetorical commitment to paternal care,
and a transfer of power from samurai and merchants to managers and
factory owners.46</p>
<p>Easing the shock of such rapid industrialization was Japan’s long
history in cotton textiles. For centuries, Japanese farmers had grown,
spun, and woven cotton in their households for domestic consumption and
local markets. By the nineteenth century a thriving putting-out industry
had emerged in the countryside, an industry that at first received an
enormous boost from the importation of cheap yarns in the wake of the
forced opening of Japan’s ports.47</p>
<p>By 1880, with the possibilities of mechanized cotton spinning
demonstrated by government-organized mills, merchants created more—and
much more substantial—factories, supported by a state committed to
domestic industrialization. That year, the head of the (private) First
National Bank, Shibusawa Eiichi, backed the Osaka Spinning Co., which
would start operations in 1883 with 10,500 spindles. It was profitable
from the beginning. Encouraged, others followed suit, opening several
mills of similar size. Using English-trained Japanese engineers, these
mills were all incorporated and tapped capital from nobles and wealthy
merchants. These new factories were able to outperform British imports
in price and even quality. Indeed, as early as 1890, Japan’s mill owners
were able to dominate their home market, and by 1895 hand spinning had
almost completely disappeared. Such successful spinning
industrialization, in turn, allowed for the further expansion of weaving
in the countryside.48</p>
<p>This industrial capitalism forged in Japan, however, was not solely
the offspring of nationalist politicians: Emerging industrial interests
had applied tremendous pressures on the state and had organized early on
for political coordination. The Japanese Spinners’ Association had
formed itself as a leading lobby in 1882, pressuring the government for
policies favorable to cotton industrialization, most importantly the
discontinuation of the import tax on raw cotton (which was meant to
protect Japanese cotton farmers) and an end to export fees on yarn. The
Greater Japan Cotton Spinners’ Association followed suit in 1888. In
fact, industrialists helped build the very state that supported their
interests. Capitalists and rulers were able to implement these lessons
because they defeated the visions of rival elites but faced no
significant democratic mass movements to contest their control over the
state.49</p>
<p>A strong state dedicated to the political economy of domestic
industrialization mattered tremendously to Japan, but in ways quite
different from Brazil. Tariffs at first played no role in Japan’s
industrialization because the international treaties that had been
forced on the nation by Western powers precluded protectionism, and
there was indeed no tariff protection before 1911. The state, however,
played a key role in importing the new technology, and, perhaps more
importantly, helped Japanese capitalists gain access to foreign markets
that could be served competitively because of Japan’s extremely low
labor costs. Prefectural author ities set up “industrial laboratories”
that investigated the special needs of foreign markets and provided
weaving companies with blueprints as to what kind of cloth would sell
where—just as the French and British governments had done in the
eighteenth century. The Japanese state also collected market
information, which included consular commercial reports, industrial
exhibitions, trade missions, “the dispatch of specific students to
foreign countries in order to conduct research on specific industries,
and commodity exhibition centres abroad…, export cartels from 1906,
trade commissioners from 1910, and world tours and business missions
undertaken by exporters.” The government, moreover, stood as the
ultimate guarantor for all kinds of debts that were essential for the
success of the industry.50</p>

(illustration credit 13.8)</p>
<p>The Japanese government acquired the ability to support local cotton
industrialists in part because of the spoils of war. Indeed, the
Japanese story once more demonstrates the tight link between colonial
expansion and industrial capitalism—the one, in effect, enabling the
other. Reparations gained from the 1894–95 Sino-Japanese War—essentially
a land grab—were used to subsidize the nation’s shipping industry, thus
helping cotton exports, and fueled the government’s ability to provide
credit to the country’s trading firms and forgo the revenue generated by
duties on raw cotton imports, which were removed in 1896, cheapening the
industry’s essential raw material.51</p>
<p>The Rise of the Global South in the Empire of Cotton, 1880–1940</p>
<p>In one of its most decisive effects, the war also provided new
markets, which would soon become supremely important to Japan’s
industrialization. China turned into Japan’s most important buyer of
yarn and cloth, until 1929, when it gained itself the ability to impose
tariffs. By 1894 China consumed 92 percent of all Japanese exports, and
by 1897–98, exports of cotton yarn, especially to China, constituted 28
percent of total Japanese spinning output. During World War I, with
British manufacturers sidelined, Japan made its deepest penetration to
date of the Chinese market. When exports of yarn declined, those of
cotton cloth expanded. Between 1903 and 1929, indeed, more than half of
all Japanese cotton cloth exports went to China.52</p>
<p>During the 1920s, the percentage share of cotton cloth exports to
India increased as well, from about 12 percent in 1926 to about 50
percent in 1932. And, again, a state committed to industrialization
mattered greatly: The Japanese government exerted political pressure on
the British colonial government in India to facilitate their entry into
that market. As India’s cotton growers became dependent on the Japanese
export market, the Japanese government was able to negotiate low tariff
barriers for the import of manufactured cottons into India, despite
objections from Lancashire manufacturers. When in 1930 the Indian
government began discriminating against such imports from Japan in
response to pressures from Lancashire, Japanese cotton manufacturers
decided to boycott raw cotton from India. That created a problem for
India, because remittances to London were paid from these exports. In
the Indo-Japanese trade negotiations of 1933 these differences were
reconciled, allowing for a freer flow of goods to India from Japan and
vice versa. In 1913–14, Japan had exported 7 million yards of cotton
piece goods to India; in 1933 it exported 579 million yards.53</p>
<p>Low-cost labor was as important as state support to Japan’s success.
Japanese cotton manufacturers, like manufacturers elsewhere, spent much
time thinking about the “problem of labor.” Labor costs in Japanese
mills were even lower than in India and about one-eighth of those in
Lancashire. Initially, mills recruited their workers from their
immediate surroundings, but as time went on they increasingly relied on
labor recruiters who brought workers from more distant locations,
literally scouring the countryside in search of poor farming
families.54</p>
<p>Women especially were pushed out of the countryside and into
factories. In 1897, 79 percent of workers in Japanese cotton factories
were female. Most of these women were very young, between fifteen and
twenty-five years old, and 15 percent were below age fourteen. Typically
they would start working at age thirteen and retire at age twenty, upon
marriage. For women workers themselves, employment in factories was a
particular moment in their life cycle, related to their preindustrial
spinning and weaving within the household, and often motivated by an
effort to accumulate savings for a dowry. This massive wave of very
young women moving into factories was facilitated by Japanese
manufacturers’ early embrace of ring spinning, which required mostly
unskilled labor.55</p>
<p>These young women were subject to extreme exploitation. Away from the
protection that their families might have provided, most lived in
dormitories next to the mills—company boarding houses that were places
of surveillance and disciplinary action. (In this way conditions were
quite similar to those in Lowell, Massachusetts, nearly a century
earlier.) One 1911 study found that workers often shared beds, and had
as little as twenty-seven square feet of space. To stem high rates of
labor turnover, companies embraced a rhetoric of paternalism, and at
times also more substantive paternalist policies. For the companies,
short commutes and total control over the workforce allowed them to
exploit their labor to the utmost, operating under a two-shift system,
each lasting twelve hours, making perfect use of capital expenses by
continuously running the machines.56</p>
<p>The state had made possible such low-wage competitiveness by
resisting any protective legislation for factory workers in the cotton
industry. The Factory Act of 1911 was only extended to cover women and
children in the textile industry in 1920. The collective action of
Japanese mill owners had postponed the passage of protective labor
legislation for forty years—undoubtedly helped by a franchise restricted
to propertied men.57</p>
<p>Women’s principal strategy of resistance to such conditions was
absconding, the same tactic Ellen Hootton had employed a century earlier
at Eccles’ Mill in Lancashire. Turnover, indeed, was tremendous—in 1897,
40 percent of all workers left the factories within six months of taking
up employment. In 1900, fewer than half of all spinning workers in
Kwansai had worked for their employer for more than a year. Employers
responded by locking boarding houses at night, forbidding women to leave
them during their free time, and retaining part of their wages until
they had served out their employment contracts.58</p>
<p>Thanks to this availability of extraordinarily cheap and
disenfranchised labor, Japan’s cotton industry continued its rapid
expansion.59 By 1902, domestic production had largely replaced imports.
By 1909, Japanese spinning factories were the fifth largest consumers of
raw cotton in the world. With spinning concentrated in large factories,
weaving, including handloom weaving, continued to thrive in the
countryside, with multiple small entrepreneurs organizing labor, and
eventually, by the 1910s and 1920s, the introduction of power looms in
their often very small shops. The value of the cotton industry’s output
continued to increase thereafter from 19 million yen in 1903 to 405
million yen in 1919. The years between 1920 and 1937 were a golden age
for the Japanese cotton industry. In 1933, Japan for the first time
exported more cotton cloth than Great Britain, France, and Germany, and
was the world’s third cotton power after the United Kingdom and the
United States. By 1937, Japan had captured 37 percent of the globally
traded cotton cloth market, compared to just 27 percent for England.
Thanks to this explosion of cotton manufacturing in Japan, Asia as a
whole had become again a net exporter of cottons, after a hiatus of
about a century and a half.60</p>
<p>In the U.S. South, Brazil, and Japan, budding manufacturers overcame
competing elites and won the support of the state for domestic
industrialization only with considerable difficulty. Yet their
difficulties paled in comparison to those in the global South who
confronted powerful colonial overlords. Those capitalists fought not
just competing elites domestically, or other social groups, but also
powerful imperial states and their economic elites, who were determined
to preserve their access to colonial markets and who opposed alternative
projects of industrialization. To sustain that struggle, they were
forced far beyond the other cotton upstarts to cultivate a mass ideology
of nationalism, and to work in concert with other social groups. For
them, colonial dependency on the global scene translated into often
devastating weakness domestically.</p>
<p>Asian industrialists turn the tables: cotton yarn imports and
exports, Japan (in thousands of tons), 1868–1918 (illustration credit

<p>Take Egypt, for example. One of the world’s premier cotton-growing
countries and one of the earliest cotton industrializers, it failed in
its efforts to build a thriving cottage industry until the 1930s. The
failure was not for lack of trying. In 1895 a number of capitalists
formed the Société Anonyme Egyptienne pour la Filature et le Tissage du
Cotton in Cairo, and four years later two additional mills opened their
doors. Never very profitable, these mills expired under the weight of an
8 percent tax on the value of their yarn and cloth production and
competition from textile imports, especially after Egypt became
essentially a free-trade appendage of the British Empire. One-quarter to
one-third of all imports into Egypt between 1880 and 1914 consisted of
cotton textiles—profitably spun and woven in Britain. There and
elsewhere, the colonial state subordinated the project of local
industrialization to its efforts to secure export markets for European
manufacturers.61</p>
<p>Things began to change slowly during World War I, and the newly
created Filature Nationale d’Egypte blossomed for a short while. It
expanded further in anticipation of tariff reforms in 1930, promoted by
an increasingly strident nationalist movement. That tariff reform
increased import duties substantially, and soon made domestic
industrialization possible, especially in cottons. Most prominently, the
ardently nationalist economist and entrepreneur Tal’at Harb, who had
created Bank Misr in 1920, drawing on the capital of wealthy landowners,
created the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company in the early 1930s, which
was well capitalized and expanded rapidly. By 1945, 25,000 of the
117,272 Egyptian textile workers spun and wove cottons in this mill.
Tariffs, in effect, had been a gift of the state to its “nascent
bourgeoisie.”62</p>
<p>Stories like Egypt’s indicated to capital owners throughout the
global South that they needed to create a state supportive of their
project of domestic industrialization, and that under conditions of
colonialism such a state could not be forged. India, more than any other
country, exemplifies this history. On the face of it, India enjoyed all
the preconditions for successful cotton industrialization—markets,
access to technology, skilled labor, low wages, and capital-rich
merchants. There was even a powerful state lording over India.
Overcoming competing elites also proved not to be overwhelmingly
difficult. Still, dominated by a foreign colonial power, Indian
industrialists faced insurmountable hurdles to molding the kind of state
they so urgently wanted—hurdles that eventually would draw them into an
anticolonial struggle that, while successful, would also weaken their
dominance over workers and peasants.</p>
<p>Anticolonialism reshapes global capitalism: Tal’at Harb, nationalist
economist and builder of one of the world’s largest cotton mills in
Mahalla al-Kubra, Egypt</p>
<p>India’s cotton industry emerged, as we have seen, principally in the
cities of Bombay and Ahmedabad in the wake of the American Civil War. To
be sure, the Bombay Spinning and Weaving Company had commenced
production as early as 1854, and by 1861 there were 12 spinning mills in
India. Yet the true expansion occurred only after 1865, drawing on the
profits Indian merchants had accumulated during the years of very high
raw cotton prices. Indian capitalists, increasingly pushed out of the
raw cotton trade by European dealers such as the Volkarts, redirected
their capital into cotton mills. By 1875, they had opened 27 mills. In
1897, there were 102 mills in the Bombay Presidency alone. The number of
spindles exploded, from 1.5 million in 1879 to nearly 9 million in 1929.
Cotton manufacturing would come to dominate the Indian manufacturing
economy.63</p>
<p>India’s dynamic entrepreneurial class drew to the best of their
ability upon the British colonial state. Export markets within the
colonial empire, for example, became highly prized, with much of the
industry’s markets to be found within the British sphere of influence—by
the 1890s, 80 percent of the yarn exported from Bombay went to China.64
This state also created infrastructures, laws, regulations, and rules
within which economic life was increasingly embedded. As the state
pushed for a massive commercialization of the countryside, more dynamic
markets for manufactured goods emerged, which benefited Indian cotton
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Indian cotton industrialists initially also drew on the colonial
state for the mobilization of labor—after all, changes within the
countryside drove huge numbers of workers into cities and into cotton
mills. During 1896, an estimated 146,000 workers labored in Indian
cotton mills, and 625,000 in 1940, a significant figure for a country
that hardly saw any other factory production. As elsewhere, the first
generation of mill workers remained in touch with the villages from
which they hailed. For many families, sending one member into the city
to work in a factory was a strategy to retain access to land. But unlike
elsewhere in the empire of cotton, most of these workers were men. The
roots of India’s proletariat, like its bourgeoisie, were to be found in
cottons. Indeed, “cheap labor” was widely seen as India’s most
distinctive competitive advantage—a proletariat created by, among other
factors, the decisive actions of a powerful colonial state.65</p>
<p>But while no doubt crucial to many aspects of cotton
industrialization, the colonial state in India was peculiar and often
destructive of local industrial dreams—it was, after all, subject to the
pressures of statesmen and capitalists in England, not in India. This
peculiarity showed with regard to labor. As elsewhere, working
conditions in the Indian cotton textile mills were terrible. Days lasted
thirteen to fourteen hours during summer, and ten to twelve hours in
winter. Temperatures in mills often exceeded 90 degrees. Mill owners
justified these conditions, in the words of the Bombay Millowners’
Association in 1910, by arguing that their workers were “mere machines
of blind industrialism, having no initiative of their own and with no
great consideration for the future,” words that would have sounded
strangely familiar to European manufacturers a century earlier. Yet
unlike in Japan, and in a sign that Indian capitalists enjoyed
significantly less sway over the state than their Japanese counterparts,
working conditions improved and labor costs increased thanks to
government intervention. The Indian Factory Act of 1891, passed at the
behest of Lancashire cotton manufacturers concerned with Indian
competition, limited the number of hours children were allowed to work
in mills. Labor legislation in 1891 and 1911 further regulated child
labor, women’s work, and hours. While working conditions and wages
remained abysmal, Indian mill owners still opposed these acts,
complaining about the low productivity of their workers and arguing that
“any restrictive legislation sought to be imposed on us at the
insistence of our friends of Lancashire will have to be resisted in a
strenuous manner.” Yet confronted with British textile workers’
self-serving protests against “the excessive working hours in the Bombay
mills and the employment of children” and with Lancashire mill owners
fearing for their export markets, they failed. Subduing labor under
conditions of colonialism proved difficult.66</p>
<p>Most striking, however, was the exceptional character of the colonial
state in India when it came to the question of market access. Its
greatest success, in many ways, was to facilitate the vast influx of
British cotton goods, making India into Lancashire’s most important
market, and severely damaging its handicraft industry.67
Industrialization and deindustrialization thus intersected on the Indian
subcontinent—and it was the Janus-faced nature of the Indian state,
strong but beholden to foreign interests, that delayed and stunted
Indian cotton industrialization. Indian capitalists had to share the
spoils of the British-initiated transformation of the subcontinent with
a powerful group of foreign capitalists and statesmen.68</p>
<p>Capital-rich elites in the global South from Ahmedabad to Rowan
County, North Carolina, from Petropolis to Osaka, from Mahalla-al-Kubra
to Veracruz tried to jump on the cotton industrialization bandwagon, and
in doing so they learned about the importance of strong states to
industrialization. If they were unusually perceptive, they recognized
the emerging weaknesses of European and North American cotton capital
rooted in that same tight link to the nation-state. Their experiences
were quite different. While in Brazil, the southern United States, and
Japan they succeeded by gaining power over competing elites and then by
forging a state responsive to their needs, in Egypt and India the
project of domestic industrialization encountered a powerful hurdle—the
colonial state itself. But wherever global South capitalists succeeded
in carving out a niche for themselves in the global cotton industry,
they did so because two processes emerged simultaneously: the
nationalization of social conflict in the core countries of the first
Industrial Revolution, which increased labor costs, and the construction
of states favoring a project of domestic industrialization and keeping
down labor costs in the global South. It was in China that these stories
came together.</p>
<p>Cotton industrialization came to China later than to the U.S. South,
Japan, India, or Brazil. This was not for lack of experience in cotton
manufacturing, difficulty obtaining raw cotton, the absence of markets
or capital, or lack of access to modern manufacturing technology. As we
know, China had one of the world’s oldest and largest cotton
manufacturing complexes, and indeed until the mid-nineteenth century
Chinese peasants were the single most significant growers of cotton
globally, nearly all of which was manufactured into yarn and cloth
domestically. In turn, the spinning and weaving of cotton were China’s
most important manufacturing activities.69</p>
<p>Despite such ideal preconditions for cotton industrialization,
mechanization only began at the end of the nineteenth century. To some
extent the very vibrancy of Chinese traditional cotton manufacturing
made industrialization more difficult. As with much of the cotton belt
prior to the nineteenth century, millions of peasants in China’s
countryside produced cottons for their own use or for nearby markets,
with little pressure to do otherwise. As late as midcentury, 45 percent
of peasant households may have produced cloth. Moreover, Western
imperialists began to put pressure on China’s port cities, deluging the
country in the second half of the nineteenth century with yarn and
cloth. European merchants and European governments (along with those
from the United States) pressured the Chinese state for market access,
with the 1877 Chefoo convention, for example, stipulating further access
to deep-sea as well as Yangtze ports, and the abolition of internal
duties. “The foreign merchant has waited long and patiently for the
attainment of these objects,” argued one such Western merchant in 1877.
“In his opinion they are essential for the successful development of his
trade with China.” Indeed, market penetration was a clearly articulated
political goal of all imperial powers. As a result, the import of cotton
goods into China increased tremendously, yarn by a factor of
twenty-four, while cloth imports doubled between the 1880s and 1910s. By
1916 the U.S. Department of Commerce called China “the largest market
for cotton yarns in the world,” including for U.S. manufacturers. At
first, the vast majority of cotton yarn and cloth imports into China
originated from the United Kingdom and the United States. After 1900,
imports came mostly from Japanese manufacturers.70</p>
<p>Such market opening rested on the uses of imperial power, that is,
strong North Atlantic states committed to providing market access to
their own industrialists. In 1882, for example, the United States sent a
gunboat to Shanghai to support its cotton interests. Four years earlier,
Peng Ruzong had founded a cotton company—the Shanghai Cotton Cloth
Mill—which received a ten-year monopoly in 1882. When William S.
Wetmore, head of the American merchant firm Frazer and Co., began
acquiring Chinese investors for a competing mill, the Shanghai Cotton
Cloth Mill immediately entreated the Chinese government to defend its
interests. Trumped‑up arrest warrants were issued for the American
firm’s two principal Chinese investors, forcing both into hiding. The
newly appointed U.S. minister to China decided it was time “to impress
upon the Chinese the fact that we were a government, with power to
maintain our rights under the treaties.” The U.S. corvette Ashuelot was
promptly stationed in Shanghai for the winter, on orders approved by
President Chester A. Arthur himself.71</p>
<p>Faced with a flood of imports, the tantalizing prospects of profiting
from mechanized cotton production, and the desire to strengthen the
Chinese state vis-à-vis Western imperial powers, modernizing elites,
both within the state bureaucracy and among capitalists, began to favor
a project of domestic industrialization. As unlikely allies in that
project, they teamed up with foreign entrepreneurs, especially from
Japan, who in their search for ever cheaper labor invested heavily in
the Chinese cotton industry. Together they created one of the most
rapidly growing cotton industries in the world.</p>
<p>The first modern Chinese cotton mill, the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Mill,
as we have seen, began operations in the early 1880s. At first the
industry grew slowly. By 1896 there were only 12 mills with 412,000
spindles. Two decades later, the number had risen to 31 mills with
somewhat more than 1 million spindles. Then came World War I, which
played a similar role for Chinese cotton industrialization, and Asia’s
more generally, as the Napoleonic Wars had done for continental Europe
125 years earlier. Its protectionist effects created a mill building
boom, and by 1925 there were 118 mills with more than 3 million
spindles, employing 252,031 workers, half of them in Shanghai alone. The
growth of cotton manufacturing in China after 1914 was indeed the
fastest in the world. Globally, the number of spindles increased by 14
percent between 1913 and 1931—but in China it skyrocketed by 297
percent, or twenty times as fast. Taking 1913 as the base year, by 1931
the number of China’s spindles increased to 397, Japan’s to 313, India’s
to 150, the United States’ to 106, while Russia’s declined to 99, Great
Britain’s to 99, and Germany’s to 97. The same was the case with
mechanical looms: The number of such looms more than tripled in China
between 1913 and 1925, nearly tripled in Japan, but slightly declined in
Great Britain.72</p>
<p>By the early 1920s, Chinese cotton yarn manufacturing had gained a
dominant position in the domestic market, and by 1925 China was able to
export more cotton manufactures than it imported. By 1937, it was once
again self-sufficient in cotton yarn and goods: As recently as 1875,
98.1 percent of all yarn in China had still been spun by hand, but by
1931 only 16.3 percent of all yarn was so manufactured, while nearly all
the rest came out of domestic factories. Cotton had become China’s most
important factory industry; according to writer Chong Su, “Shanghai is
fast becoming the Manchester of the Far East.”73</p>
<p>This industry drew, as elsewhere, on cheap labor; indeed, labor in
China was cheaper than anywhere else in the world, including Japan. When
the U.S. Department of Commerce reported in 1916 on the situation in
Chinese cotton mills, it found tens of thousands of workers laboring day
and night on twelve-hour shifts, with the only break for twelve hours on
Sundays. Their pay amounted to about 10 U.S. cents a day. With working
hours “longer than in any other country in the world” and no child labor
laws on the books, China was the world’s lowest-cost producer. Even
owners of cotton mills in Bombay feared Chinese competition, not least
because, unlike them, China’s industry “enjoys perfect immunity from
restrictive factory legislation.”74</p>
<p>Even in a context of low-cost labor, Chinese manufacturers showed a
clear preference for the very cheapest workers—children and women. By
1897, 79 percent of workers in these spinning factories were female, and
15 percent boys and girls younger than fourteen years old. If earlier in
the nineteenth century women could not be moved into factories, as
mentioned, by the 1890s changes within the countryside, not least
occasioned by low-cost imports of cotton yarn, had made women’s labor
available. Female or male, rural migrants became the core of the
workforce, often hired directly in the countryside under conditions
involving significant coercion. Privileged male workers within the
factories, so called “Number Ones,” engaged them in return for “gifts.”
Workers, especially women, were often traded, as very poor families sold
their daughters into mill labor, with their wages controlled at least in
part by others, a status that closely resembled bonded labor and was
very difficult to escape.75</p>
<p>Another decisive factor in the rise of the Chinese cotton industry
was government support. State bureaucrats believed that China needed
cotton mills to withstand foreign pressures and they used their albeit
limited state capacity to provide strategic support to these
enterprises. Just like in Japan and elsewhere, they did so partly under
pressure from ever better organized and mobilized urban economic elites.
The Chinese state helped keep labor costs down by repressing workers’
collective action with a strong police or even army presence in cotton
mills. During the 1920s, Shanghai mill owners, with the support of
Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, went along with the murder of
thousands of left-leaning labor leaders. But the state mattered in other
ways as well. At times it granted monopoly rights to certain enterprises
to attract capital, and on occasion the state provided what one author
has called “bureaucratic capital” to enable the start up of a mill.
Provincial governments promised low taxes and other supports, along with
loans and even machines. But the financial means, and indeed the power,
of the government was quite limited, especially after the defeat in the
1895 war against Japan, which saddled China with indemnity payments. It
was only in the 1920s and 1930s, when Chinese nationalists called for a
boycott of Japanese goods, and after 1929, when China regained the
capacity to create tariff barriers, an ability that it had lost in 1842,
that Chinese industrialists could begin to compete effectively.76</p>
<p>Unlike the situation in Japan, or, for that matter, other parts of
the world, Chinese investments in cotton mills were rapidly combined
with, and eventually superseded by, international investments. The
reason for this unusual deep penetration by foreign capital was the very
weakness of the Chinese state: The 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended
the Sino-Japanese War, as mentioned, explicitly allowed for the
establishment of foreign-owned mills in China. Two years later, the
first foreign-owned mill opened, and by 1898 there were already four
such mills in Shanghai. Many followed. Some of these mills drew on
British and German capital and expertise, but the vast majority were of
Japanese origin.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Japanese cotton industry created its own low-wage
production complex across the East China Sea, just as the Germans would
do in Poland and the manufacturers of New England in the states of the
U.S. South. The first Japanese-owned mill opened in 1902 in Shanghai,
drawn by labor costs only half of what they had been in Japan. Chinese
workers lacked any of the paternalist welfare benefits increasingly
enjoyed by Japanese workers. Such investments made Japanese-owned mills
the fastest-growing segment of the Chinese cotton industry, and by 1925
nearly half of Chinese spinning capacity was foreign-owned,
overwhelmingly by the Japanese.77</p>
<p>Considering the importance of states to industrial capitalism’s
political economy, and the onslaught of an ever larger number of
imperial powers such as the United States and Germany, it is not
surprising that economic elites throughout the global South aspired to
forge such states as well. European and North American statesmen and
capitalists resisted them in this project, however, and in turn became
even more dependent on their respective states, states strengthened by
the colonial project and whose tasks now included containing ever more
vibrant anticolonial movements. The ensuing struggle was fierce and
violent, creating for budding manufacturers in the global South
conditions fundamentally different from the ones their counterparts had
faced a hundred years earlier in western Europe and the United States.
Because their opponents—mighty North Atlantic states tightly linked to
wealthy capitalists—were so powerful, the new entrepreneurs were forced
to build coalitions with increasingly mobilized and nationalized groups
of workers and peasants within their own societies. As they were unable
to fight on both foreign and popular fronts, their dependence on
subordinate social groups in the process of state making distinguished
their trajectory toward industrialization from Europe’s or North
America’s. The legacy of colonialism would remain a powerful influence
long after independence even while decolonialization became perhaps the
single most significant event in the history of twentieth-century
capitalism.</p>

(illustration credit 13.10)</p>
<p>As capital-rich merchants and bankers along with their rulers in the
global South worked to create conditions conducive to cotton
industrialization, and industrialization more broadly, they developed a
devastating critique of colonialism. Entrepreneurs in Shanghai, Mahalla
al-Kubra, Ahmedabad, and elsewhere saw the urgent need for a state
responsive to their interests—a goal that brought them into open
opposition to foreign powers.78 Indian cotton capitalists were among the
most eloquent, as they vocally accused the colonial state of being
beholden to the interests of Lancashire. British colonialism, they
argued, had failed to allow Indian capitalists the benefit of protected
markets, as the tariff policy of the colonial government was guided by
the principle of allowing for the massive importation of English yarn
and cloth.</p>
<p>In response to such discrimination, Indian capitalists mobilized
politically. In Bombay, they formed the Millowners’ Association to
articulate their demands. Ahmedabad’s Gujarati counterparts followed
suit and organized the Gujarat Industrial Association, advocating for
protectionism. One of their first struggles began in the 1890s against
the excise tax that they were forced to pay on their products to make up
for modest import duties, a tax they found to be “not fair on any
principle”—“an altogether unnecessary and indefensible sop to
Lancashire.” This struggle carried into the new century, with mill owner
and activist Ambalal Sakarlal Desai complaining at the Indian National
Congress meeting in Ahmedabad in 1902 that the “heavy duties imposed on
the textile industry are unjustly borne by every householder of
Ahmedabad.”79</p>
<p>In this conflict, the mill owners encountered Indian nationalists,
who focused a significant share of their agitation on the ill effects of
British colonialism on Indian cotton industrialization. The Mahratta,
published in Poona by militant nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak,
consistently expressed opposition to colonial tariff policies. It
favored mass protests against the cotton duties bill and accused the
colonial government of “sacrificing” India for Lancashire through the
“cotton duties crime.” A year later, the colonial government sent Tilak
to jail for sedition. Even Gopal Krishna Gokhale, founder of the
Servants of India Society and a leader of the Indian National Congress,
who could not agree on much with Tilak, was opposed to the tariff
policies of the British in regard to cotton. When the Imperial
Legislative Council was enlarged in India in 1911, mill owner Ratanji
Dadabhoy Tata demanded abolition of the excise duties, supported by
fifteen of the sixteen Indian members. For freedom fighter Mahatma
Gandhi, these duties were “an instance of fiscal injustice…unparalleled
in any civilized country of modern times.” Indeed, the struggle over the
excise duty on cotton goods was one of the first great flare-ups of the
anticolonial struggle, as the political interests of cotton
manufacturers became important to Indian anticolonialism more
broadly.80</p>
<p>Narottam Morarjee, cotton manufacturer and chairman of the Bombay
Millowners’ Association, 1894</p>
<p>Cotton capitalists not only sought relief from excise taxes and
protection; they also wanted the state to be more supportive in their
efforts to capture export markets. Indian mill owners, like their
British counterparts, recognized the promise of distant markets—in
Africa, for example—and went so far as to produce cloth specifically
designed for the tastes of East Africans. But they bemoaned that “there
really exists no official organization for the supply to Indian
merchants and manufacturers of the trade intelligence so indispensable
to their enterprise which the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade
purvey to the British trader.” Such market information, gathered by
governments, had become increasingly important to manufacturers. To
access foreign markets they needed the support of the state, support
that the colonial government, unlike, for example, the contemporary
Japanese government, was not likely to provide.81</p>
<p>One of the strategies that Indian nationalists increasingly advocated
in opposition to the British presence in India was to encourage
consumption of domestically manufactured textiles. The first Indian
Industrial Conference meeting in 1905, bringing together industrialists
from all over India, decided to “foster and extend the use of such
manufactures in India in preference to foreign goods.” That demand
intersected with the emerging Swadeshi movement, which advocated Indian
self-sufficiency, especially in cottons, and symbolized the confluence
of cotton entrepreneurs and the emerging nationalist political elites.
Tilak was “glad to find that associations and leagues have been formed
in various places to advocate the necessity of using native cloth and
thus ousting Lancashire and Manchester from the Indian market,” and the
increasingly influential Indian National Congress, founded in 1885,
supported the Swadeshi movement. Indian entrepreneurs agreed: Ahmedabad
textile pioneer Ranchhodlal Chhotalal, along with others, created the
Swadeshi Udhyam Vardhak Mandli (Organization for the Promotion of
Indigenous Industry); Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata named one of his mills
the Swadeshi Mill; and Ambalal Sakarlal Desai, of the Ahmedabad
Merchants Spinning Company, strongly supported Swadeshi. As the Chairman
of the Bombay Millowners’ Association, Vithaldas Damodar Thackersey
remarked at the annual meeting in 1907, he was “glad to see…the
increased interest which the public take in indigenous industries under
the impulse of the Swadeshi movement.” Hopes ran high that domestic
industrialization would restore India’s former importance to the global
economy. Symbolizing the great significance of cotton to nationalism and
anticolonialism, a few years later Gandhi not only wrote a history of
cotton in India, but also publicly spun cotton on a spinning wheel, the
same mechanism that the Indian National Congress chose in 1930 as the
centerpiece for its flag.82</p>
<p>Gandhi was nostalgic about homespun cotton, but Indian industrialists
had a realpolitik appreciation of decolonialization. They agreed with
Gandhi that the radical spatial recasting of the global cotton industry
in the nineteenth century was one of the most damaging effects of
colonialism—but they also had a significant interest in furthering the
colonial project of turning rural cotton spinners and weavers into the
producers and consumers of commodities, with Sir Purshotamdas Thakurdas,
mill owner and president of the East India Cotton Association, urging in
1919 that “measures must be taken to protect the quality of Indian
cotton.” Indian mill owners fought just as strenuously for recasting the
Indian countryside as their British counterparts had done. Tata himself
suggested that longer-staple cotton be grown in India in order to enable
domestic manufacturers. When a group of Surat cotton merchants met in
April 1919 they discussed measures to maintain the quality of local
cottons. And Purshotamdas Thakurdas saw an urgent need to improve Indian
cotton, as otherwise it would “militate considerably against the Weaving
Industry of India.” Indian capitalists now became deeply immersed in
questions of cotton supply: Vithaldas Damodar Thackersey of the Bombay
Millowners’ Association demanded government support for the cultivation
of long-staple cottons to “revolutionize the whole industry.” By 1910,
the association went so far as to laud the efforts of the British Cotton
Growing Association to improve cotton growing in India: “We cannot but
deplore the absence of legislation against the adulteration of cotton in
this country.”83 Eventually, cotton nationalism did not lead to a return
to the preindustrial world of cotton symbolized by Gandhi’s spinning
wheel, but instead to a massive wave of state-sponsored
industrialization that radically recast the empire of cotton once more,
drawing millions of displaced rural cultivators into cotton factories,
to work for wages only a fraction of the ones paid in Lancashire, in
Lowell, or in the valleys of the Black Forest.84</p>

<p>More so than perhaps anywhere else in the world, cotton and
nationalism became intertwined in India. Textile industrialists became
supporters of the independence movement, and its leaders in turn made
domestic cotton industrialization a prime goal. As Gandhi, who enjoyed
close connections to Ahmedabad’s mill owners, put it in 1930, “The
cotton textile industry is a valuable national asset giving employment
to a large number of people, effecting the prosperity of the people of
India, and its safety and progress must continue to receive attention of
her capitalists, labour leaders, politicians and economists.” For many
Indian nationalists, independence would, among other things, make
possible the development of a home market and import-substitution
industrialization—the “reconstruction of her entire political and
economic life,” according to a 1934 book by scholar and engineer
Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. Creating a state conducive to domestic
industrialization threw Indian cotton industrialists, like their
Egyptian, Chinese, and eventually African and Southeast Asian
counterparts, into skirmishes with the colonial state, as a global
social conflict came to focus increasingly on the control of the
state.85</p>

<p>Despite unprecedented differences in wealth as well as state
strength, and despite a thick bulwark of racism that pinned much of
humanity to subordinate roles, the struggle to break out of the imperial
system succeeded, across the globe, by the second half of the twentieth
century. Sometimes small victories came even before the great wave of
decolonialization, such as in India, when tariffs began to protect the
Indian industry against Japanese competition, and when the hated excise
duty was repealed in 1926.86 Such victories—and even more so
decolonialization itself—came not as a result of the political strength
of global South capitalists alone, but because nationalist movements
were able to draw on large numbers of newly mobilized peasants and
workers. Indeed, decolonialization almost always rested on mass
mobilization, and thus the construction of nation-states in the formerly
colonial world looked drastically different from their constitution in
Europe and North America a century and a half earlier.</p>
<p>Capitalists’ dependence on workers and peasants in their struggle to
create a state conducive to the interests of national capital, however,
weakened those same capitalists in the long run. Not surprisingly,
global South cotton capitalists remained quite ambivalent about popular
anticolonial mobilizations. Indeed, at times fear drove them into the
arms of the colonizing power. In Korea, the Japanese colonialists
observed in 1919 that “wealthy Koreans have recently grown extremely
fearful of the radicalization of popular sentiment.” Indian
industrialists were generally on the moderate side of agitation as well,
not least because they feared the militancy of their workers; “the
truculence of the mill-hands needs to be checkmated in time,” said the
Bombay Millowners’ Association, reporting after a round of rioting in
1909 that they “have lost their hold over them.” Industrialist Ratanji
Tata supported the Servants of India Society for similar reasons,
embracing the nationalist call for a program of “industrial development
of the country,” but also hoping that the society would retain its
moderate positions. Manufacturer Purshotamdas Thakurdas pushed strongly
against Gandhi and the non-cooperation movement, and tried to draw on
the support of Indian capitalists for his position. The need to forge a
state dedicated to the interests of national capital, in a colonial
setting such as India, in effect brought national capitalists into an
uneasy alliance with politically mobilizing workers and peasants. In the
wake of the depression of 1929, Indian industrialists saw little
alternative but to hitch their political fortunes to a Congress Party
whose mass base increasingly was to be found among India’s peasants.
When they started planning for a postindependence economy, they
acknowledged in the 1944 Bombay Plan the centrality of government
planning, with a “supreme economic council” coordinating most sectors of
the economy—laying the groundwork for India’s first five-year plan in
1950. Five-year plans of the kind that spread from Russia to China to
India had decisively not been on the minds of Lancashire, Alsatian, or
New England manufacturers a century earlier.87</p>
<p>Throughout the global South, indeed, cotton workers played key roles
in the struggles for national independence, in addition to joining
unions and engaging in vast strike movements. Social and national
struggles merged more often than not. Some of the twenty-five thousand
workers at Egypt’s huge Misr Spinning and Weaving Company in Mahalla
al-Kubra, for example, played a key role in the struggle for Egyptian
independence. There and elsewhere, tens of thousands of cotton workers
went on strike in 1946 and 1947 to demand better conditions of
employment—and the removal of British troops from Egypt.88</p>
<p>Chinese textile workers mobilized just as much, and—eventually—would
come to play an important role in the struggle against Western powers,
and in the 1949 revolution. They struck frequently, 209 times between
1918 and 1929. When workers walked out of the Japanese-owned Naigai Wata
Kaisha mill in May 1925, they provoked “the famous May 30 incident,” a
day of rallies culminating in the killing of thirteen Chinese protesters
by the police. This incident fueled a wave of popular discontent and the
growth of Chinese trade unionism. Cotton workers at times also joined
the Communist Party and took on an important role in the revolutionary
struggle between 1946 and 1949.89</p>
<p>In India as well, the struggle for higher wages and better working
conditions merged with the anticolonial struggle. Indian cotton workers
had mobilized collectively since the late nineteenth century; indeed,
the first strike had occurred in 1874, followed by many more during the
1880s. In 1895 workers rioted for better working conditions, and in 1918
Gandhi himself played a leading but conciliatory role in an Ahmedabad
textile workers’ strike. Narayan Malhar Joshi’s Bombay Textile Labor
Union was founded in 1925, in the context of a general strike against
the mill owners’ effort to cut wages by 10 percent. By 1927 that union
had approximately one hundred thousand members, and four hundred
thousand by 1938, a powerful group of workers in conflicts with their
employers, yet also an important pillar in the struggle for national
independence.90</p>
<p>As cotton workers assumed an important role in anticolonial
struggles, they would eventually translate their role into further
social and economic gains. In China, just a few years after the
revolution, the cotton industry was nationalized and set on an enormous
trajectory of expansion (albeit one that brought little benefit to
China’s rural masses). In India, protectionism and state investments
channeled by five-year plans led to the growth of the cotton industry,
while postindependence labor activism led to significant wage gains.
Wages for Indian cotton workers increased by 65 percent between 1950 and
1963, even as the price of output only rose 18 percent. In Egypt,
independence at first brought significant new protective labor
legislation and, especially, an important role for the state in the
mediation of labor conflict. Eventually, independence brought
significant changes to the Egyptian economy, as raw cotton exports—the
staple export of the Egyptian economy for more than a hundred
years—stagnated as more and more cotton was used in domestic
manufacturing. “Arab socialism” brought improvements to workers, but
also the repression of independent trade union activities. During the
1960s, under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the cotton industry was nationalized.
The strength and political importance of the working class had in effect
resulted in the expropriation of local cotton capitalists, coupled with
the belief that industrialization was necessary for the defense of the
state itself. Capitalists’ dependence on workers (and peasants) in the
struggle against the colonial state had now translated into diminished
powers.91</p>

<p>Not only was the balance of social power between workers and
capitalists different in these postcolonial societies; the state’s
relationship to society was different as well. As these latecomers to
cotton industrialization faced a world unlike that confronted by the
first wave of industrializers in England, continental Europe, and North
America, they believed that they needed to make the transition to
industrial capitalism more swiftly, including the mobilization of labor,
territory, markets, and raw materials. As industrial capitalism rested
on the state, such “Great Leaps Forward” led as often as not to extreme
statist outcomes in the postcolonial world—with postcolonial or even
postcapitalist regimes now deploying the tools of the colonial
integration of territory, resources, and especially labor with much
greater radicalism.92 Industrial capitalism had become central to the
survival of the state itself, a state that often now prioritized the
industrial in industrial capitalism. In fact, capitalism at times seemed
to stand in the way of industrialization.</p>
<p>Yet even though Soviet Russia, Communist China, and independent India
and Egypt represented variations of the most radical merger of the state
and capital, of industrialization and political consolidation, capital
by the 1950s had been hedged in by nation-states more generally. It was
only after the 1970s, as we shall see, that industrialists began to
emancipate themselves from their age-old dependence on particular
states. Capitalists, so long dependent on strong states to pursue their
project of industrial capitalism, now began overcoming their greatest
weakness—the territorialization of capital. It was at this point that
the empire of cotton took on the shape of today.</p>
