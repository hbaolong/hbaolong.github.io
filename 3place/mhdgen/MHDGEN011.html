War Reverberates Around the World</h4>
<p>Viewed from abroad, cotton was central to the American struggle:
Punch comments on the American Civil War. (illustration credit 9.1)</p>
<p>A crisis illuminates best the foundations of the global empire of
cotton. The American Civil War was such a crisis. By the time shots were
fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861, cotton was the core ingredient of
the world’s most important manufacturing industry. The manufacture of
cotton yarn and cloth had grown into “the greatest industry that ever
had or could by possibility have ever existed in any age or country,”
according to the self-congratulatory but essentially accurate account of
British cotton merchant John Benjamin Smith. By multiple measures—the
sheer numbers employed, the value of output, profitability—the cotton
empire had no parallel. One author boldly estimated that in 1862, fully
20 million people worldwide—one out of every sixty-five people
alive—were involved in the cultivation of cotton or the production of
cotton cloth. In England alone, which still counted two-thirds of the
world’s mechanical spindles in its factories, the livelihood of between
one-fifth and one-fourth of the population was based on the industry;
one-tenth of all British capital was invested in it, and close to
one-half of all exports consisted of cotton yarn and cloth. Whole
regions of Europe and the United States had come to depend on a
predictable supply of cheap cotton. Except for wheat, no “raw product,”
so the Journal of the Statistical Society of London declared, had “so
complete a hold upon the wants of the race.”1</p>
<p>The industry that brought great wealth to European manufacturers and
merchants, and bleak employment to hundreds of thousands of mill
workers, had also catapulted the United States onto center stage of the
world economy, building “the most successful agricultural industry in
the States of America which has been ever contemplated or realized.”
Cotton exports alone put the United States on the world economic map. On
the eve of the Civil War, raw cotton constituted 61 percent of the value
of all U.S. products shipped abroad. Before the beginnings of the cotton
boom in the 1780s, North America had been a promising but marginal
player in the global economy. Now, in 1861, the flagship of global
capitalism, Great Britain, found itself dangerously dependent on the
white gold shipped out of New York, New Orleans, Charleston, and other
American ports. By the late 1850s, cotton grown in the United States
accounted for 77 percent of the 800 million pounds of cotton consumed in
Britain. It also accounted for 90 percent of the 192 million pounds used
in France, 60 percent of the 115 million pounds spun in the Zollverein,
and 92 percent of the 102 million pounds manufactured in Russia.2</p>
<p>The reason for America’s quick ascent to market dominance was simple.
The United States more than any other country had elastic supplies of
the three crucial ingredients that went into the production of raw
cotton: labor, land, and credit. As The Economist put it in 1861, the
United States had become so successful in the world’s cotton markets
because the planters’ “soil is marvelously fertile and costs him
nothing; his labour has hitherto been abundant, unremitting and on the
increase; the arrangements and mercantile organizations for cleaning and
forwarding the cotton are all there.”3 By midcentury, cotton had become
central to the prosperity of the Atlantic world. Poet John Greenleaf
Whittier called it the “Haschish of the West,” a drug that was creating
powerful hallucinatory dreams of territorial expansion, of judges who
decide that “right is wrong,” of heaven as “a snug plantation” with
“angel negro overseers.”4</p>
<p>Slavery stood at the center of the most dynamic and far-reaching
production complex in human history. Herman Merivale, British colonial
bureaucrat, noted that Manchester’s and Liverpool’s “opulence is as
really owing to the toil and suffering of the negro, as if his hands had
excavated their docks and fabricated their steam-engines.” Capital
accumulation in peripheral commodity production, according to Merivale,
was necessary for metropolitan economic expansion, and access to labor,
if necessary by coercion, was a precondition for turning abundant lands
into productive suppliers of raw materials.5</p>
<p>Whether celebrating the material advances generated from slavery or
calling for slavery’s abolition, many contemporaries agreed by the 1850s
that global economic development required physical coercion. Karl Marx
sharpened the arguments made all around him by concluding in 1853 that
“bourgeois civilization” and “barbarity” were joined at the hip. But
such an argument was simply common sense in elite circles. French
geographer Élisée Reclus, writing in the Revue des Deux Mondes, for
example, came to essentially the same conclusion: “The industrial
prosperity of England appears to be intimately tied to the progress of
slavery.” Southern planters agreed passionately: Cotton, and thus
slavery, were indispensable to the modern world, the very foundation of
the United States’ and Europe’s astonishing material advances. As South
Carolina senator and cotton planter James Henry Hammond put it famously
on the floor of the Senate, “England would topple headlong and carry the
whole civilized world with her” if the system of slave-powered cotton
growing would be threatened. “No power on earth dares to make war upon
it. Cotton is king.”6</p>
<p>Slavery enabled the stunning advances of industry, and the
accompanying profit. Contemporaries, however, worried that this vast and
sparkling machine was merely a façade, amplifying the long-standing
European worries about the political stability of the United States that
we have encountered earlier. As “an industry tributary to foreign
countries,” observed British political economist Leone Levi, the
European cotton industry was potentially vulnerable, even though its
well-being, according to a French observer, had “become a question of
life or death for tens of thousands of workers, a question of prosperity
or misery for all the developed industrial countries.”7</p>
<p>Most important, slavery itself seemed potentially hazardous to
stability—a “treacherous foundation,” as the Manchester Cotton Supply
Association put it—not just because of the sectional tensions it
generated in the United States, but also because slaves could resist and
even rebel: “The system of slave labour was not to be safely trusted,”
the association declared in 1861. “The dread of slave insurrection and
civil discord,” the Cotton Supply Reporter complained, was ever present.
Even the London money market reflected these concerns, as bonds for
southern railroads carried higher interest than those for northern
roads. “This mistrust arises,” reported the Westminster Review in 1850
“from a shrewd calculation of the dangers, in both a moral and physical
sense, which hang over a state of society whose foundations are laid in
injustice and violence.”8</p>
<p>American slavery had begun to threaten the very prosperity it
produced, as the distinctive political economy of the cotton South
collided with the incipient political economy of free labor and domestic
industrialization of the North. In addition, the violent expansion of
both these economies westward brought crisis after crisis to their
nascent national institutions.9 Ample supplies of fertile land and
bonded labor had made the South into Lancashire’s plantation, but by
1860 large numbers of Americans, especially in the northern states,
protested such semicolonial dependence. They, in time, sparked a second
American revolution. Fearing for the security of their human property,
southern slave owners struck out on their own, gambling that their
European partners would intervene to preserve the world economy and with
it their own exceptionally profitable role. Southern planters understood
that their cotton kingdom rested not only on plentiful land and labor,
but also upon their political ability to preserve the institution of
slavery and to project it into the new cotton lands of the American
West. Continued territorial expansion of slavery was vital to secure
both its economic, and even more so its political viability, which was
threatened as never before by an alarmingly sectional Republican Party.
Slave owners understood the challenge to their power over human chattel
represented by the new party’s project of strengthening the claims of
power between the national state and its citizens—an equally necessary
condition for its free labor and free soil ideology.</p>
<p>Yet from a global perspective, the outbreak of war between the
Confederacy and the Union in April 1861 was a struggle not only over
American territorial integrity and the future of its “peculiar
institution,” but also over global capitalism’s dependence on slave
labor across the world. The Civil War in the United States was an acid
test for the entire industrial order: Could it adapt to the even
temporary loss of its providential partner—the expansive, slave-powered
antebellum United States—before social chaos and economic collapse
brought their empire to ruins? As John Marshman, editor of the Baptist
missionary newspaper Friend of India, observed in March 1863, “It may be
said that the prosperity of the South has been based on the gigantic
crime of holding three or four millions of human beings in a state of
slavery, and it is difficult to divest the mind of the conviction that
the day of reckoning from the throne of the Eternal has come.”10</p>
<p>The day of reckoning arrived on April 12, 1861. On that spring day,
Confederate troops fired on the federal garrison at Fort Sumter, South
Carolina. It was a quintessentially local event, a small crack in the
world’s core production and trade system, but the resulting crisis
illuminated brilliantly the underlying foundations of the global cotton
industry and with it of capitalism. Columbia University political
scientist Francis Lieber predicted “neither cotton nor slavery will come
forth from this war as they went into it.” With its shocking duration
and destructiveness, the American struggle marked the world’s first
truly global raw materials crisis, and proved midwife to the emergence
of new global networks of labor, capital, and state power. Thus one of
the most important chapters in the history of global capital and labor
unfolded on the battlefields of provincial North America.11</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Civil War severed in one stroke the relationships
that had underpinned the worldwide web of cotton production and global
capitalism since the 1780s. In an effort to force British diplomatic
recognition, the Confederate government banned all cotton exports. By
the time the Confederacy realized this policy was doomed, a northern
blockade effectively kept most cotton from leaving the South. Though
smuggling persisted, and most smugglers’ runs succeeded, the blockade’s
deterrent effects removed most cotton-carrying ships from the southern
trade. Consequently, exports to Europe fell from 3.8 million bales in
1860 to virtually nothing in 1862. The effects of the resulting “cotton
famine,” as it came to be known, quickly rippled outward, reshaping
industry—and the larger society—in places ranging from Manchester to
Alexandria. With only slight hyperbole, the Chamber of Commerce in the
Saxon cotton manufacturing city of Chemnitz reported in 1865 that “never
in the history of trade have there been such grand and consequential
movements as in the past four years.”12</p>
<p>A mad scramble ensued. The effort was all the more desperate as no
one could predict when the war would end and when, if ever, cotton
production would revive in the American South. “What are we to do,”
asked the editors of the Liverpool Mercury in January 1861, if “this
most precarious source of supply should suddenly fail us?” Once it did
fail, this question was foremost on the minds of policy makers,
merchants, manufacturers, workers, and peasants around the globe.13</p>
<p>At first, the panic of European cotton manufacturers was allayed by
the fact that cotton imports in the previous few years had been
extremely high, leaving sufficient stocks in major ports and factories
for the coming months or even a year. Yarn and cloth markets from Buenos
Aires to Calcutta, moreover, were glutted. With initial expectations
that the war would be short, cuts in cotton exports from the American
South meant rising prices for the stock at hand, which holders of cotton
and cotton goods welcomed. Looking back at the early months of the war,
Moskva, the voice of Moscow’s industrialists, reported that the conflict
at first helped “rid us of our own crisis in the cotton industry, which
was about to erupt” due to overproduction.14</p>
<p>Eventually, however, dwindling supplies and rising prices began to
paralyze production. In the late summer of 1861, Charles Francis Adams,
the U.S. ambassador to England, wrote to his son Henry that “this cotton
question is beginning to pinch.” By early 1862, as total imports of
cotton into Britain fell by a little over 50 percent compared to the
previous year, and imports from the United States by 96 percent, mills
began shutting down for a few days each week, or entirely. Cotton prices
had quadrupled from their prewar levels and, consequently, manufacturers
closed shops and tens of thousands of operatives found themselves out of
work. As early as November 1861, Lancashire manufacturers had shut 6
percent of their factories and introduced shorter shifts in two-thirds
of them. By early 1863, a quarter of the inhabitants of Lancashire—more
than half a million individuals—were out of work, receiving some form of
public or private assistance. Weaver John O’Neil, who lived in Low Moor
Mill in Lancashire, described his plight in his diary: “Sad and
weary…and can hardly keep myself living.” In response to such misery
“Unemployed Operatives” sent memorials to the Home Office, demanding
relief.15</p>
<p>By 1863, unemployed workers rioted in the streets of several British
cotton towns, underscoring the explosive social consequences of the
cotton famine. The home secretary received requests from town
authorities for information on “how the military are to be obtained if
required in any future Emergency.” Troops were soon stationed. Even
cotton merchant William Rathbone reported to his son in the spring of
1862 that “the distress among the Poor here and in the Manufacturing
districts is great, and I fear on the increase.” So serious was the
crisis that thousands of miles from Europe the merchants of the Bombay
Chamber of Commerce collected funds “in aid of the distressed mill hands
of Lancashire.” “Anxiety” and “apprehension” began to spread.16</p>
<p>Similar crises unfolded on the European continent. In France,
manufacturers closed mills because they could not afford high cotton
prices as imports of U.S. cotton fell from more than 600,000 bales in
1860 to 4,169 in 1863. The effect was especially severe on manufacturers
of coarse cottons, such as the ones in Normandy, for whom the price of
cotton determined much of the total price of production. By 1863,
three-fifths of the looms in Normandy were idle, while in the districts
of Colmar and Belfort, where higher-quality cottons were produced, 35
percent of all spindles and 41 percent of all looms remained unused.
That same year, a French national relief committee estimated that a
quarter million textile workers were unemployed. In the textile towns of
Alsace posters went up proclaiming, “Du pain ou la mort” (Bread or
death).17</p>
<p>Lesser cotton centers also experienced severe distress: In the German
lands of the Zollverein, imports of raw cotton fell by about 50 percent
between 1861 and 1864 and hundreds of factory owners sent their workers
home. Of the approximately three hundred thousand people engaged in the
cotton industry in Saxony alone, one-third had lost their jobs by the
fall of 1863, while the rest worked much shorter hours. In the northern
part of the United States, removed from battle itself but not its
consequences, tens of thousands of cotton workers lost employment, but
the social effects were less severe because many found employment in the
booming woolen mills that produced clothing for the Union army, or
enlisted. In Moscow, however, 75 percent of all cotton spinning
operations had shut down by 1863. Workers and manufacturers would have
agreed with the U.S. consul in the German city of Stettin that “this war
and its consequences stands before the whole civilized world as an
interposing fate, which no nation however insignificant its direct
relations to the field of contest may be, can entirely avoid.”18</p>
<p>While manufacturers closed mills and spinners and weavers suffered,
cotton merchants lived—for a brief time—through a golden age. Rising
prices for cotton led to a frenzy with “doctors, parsons, lawyers, wives
and widows, and tradesmen speculating in it.” Cotton shipments changed
hands many times between speculators before being delivered to
factories; with each exchange a small profit could be made. Baring
Brothers, confirmed in the summer of 1863 that the “amount of money made
and still making in this article is almost fabulous; for three years or
more not a bale has arrived from India but has paid profit and mostly a
large one.” Liverpool cotton brokers gained as well from the presence of
many speculators in the market (resulting in many transactions), and
also rising prices (their commissions were a percentage of the value).
In 1861, the total value of cotton imports had been £39.7 million and in
1864 it had reached £84 million, despite a much-reduced volume.19</p>
<p>As price volatility and speculation spread, so too did traders’
efforts to institutionalize speculative market transactions, especially
forward selling. By 1863, the Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association had
created a standard form that could be used by merchants making contracts
about the future delivery of cotton, and Liverpool newspapers began
reporting forward prices of Indian cotton. That year, “time bargains”
had even begun to be established in Bombay, providing new opportunities
for “men afflicted with a passion for gambling.” The war, in fact,
resulted “in a revolutionary modernization of trade” in which the
establishment of a formal futures market was perhaps the most important
element.20</p>
<p>While merchants and speculators benefited from the global scramble
for cotton, manufacturers loudly and frantically demanded the opening of
new sources of the fiber. In France, factory owners from different
cotton manufacturing regions continuously pressured the imperial
government. “It is therefore urgently necessary to develop…new fields of
production,” wrote the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Rouen. In 1862
a group of cotton manufacturers from Senones in the Vosges appealed to
Napoleon III to bring Chinese workers to Algeria to grow cotton there.
That year, cotton manufacturer Jacques Siegfried presented a “memoir” to
the Société Industrielle de Mulhouse to advocate cotton growing in
Algeria, supported by the Chamber of Commerce in Mulhouse: “No
colonization for cotton, cotton for colonization.” When Antoine Herzog,
a wealthy Alsatian cotton manufacturer, sat down in 1864 to pen a book
on L’Algérie et la crise cotonnière, he hoped that France would
recognize that it was “at the mercy of the political vicissitudes of a
single people,” and therefore needed to “develop…by all possible means
the cotton culture of countries that are capable of producing [it], and,
in a special way, in our colonies.” Herzog personally pleaded with
Napoleon for an audience to have him support colonial cotton-growing
efforts and even traveled to Algeria to investigate the opportunities
for cotton production there.21</p>
<p>Pressured by manufacturers and concerned about the suffering and
mobilization of cotton workers, government bureaucrats expressed
concerns as well. Cotton, after all, was central to their national
economies and ultimately to the maintenance of social peace. Some
European officials advocated recognition of the Confederacy and breaking
the Union blockade to secure that urgently needed cotton. Others hoped
for new sources of cotton from places outside the United
States—especially the two European powers that had both substantial
cotton industries and large colonial holdings, Britain and France. Even
before the outbreak of the war, British foreign secretary Lord John
Russell had hastened to assure the cotton manufacturers of Manchester
that his government would do all in its power to secure cotton from
sources outside the United States. Yet in July 1862 the American consul
to the Egyptian city of Alexandria, William Thayer, reported that
“statesmen are almost paralyzed with terror at the hopelessness of
relief for the evils in prospect.” The Prussian minister to Washington,
Freiherr von Gerolt, along with his British and French counterparts,
repeated many times in his meetings with U.S. secretary of state William
Seward how important cotton was to their countries’ economic well-being.
On numerous occasions, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the
French Senate debated the “cotton question.”22</p>
<p>This intense public concern with securing access to cheaply priced
raw materials essential to national industries was a clear departure
from the past. Since the 1780s, raw cotton markets had been decisively
dominated by merchants, but now cotton had become a matter of state, a
state empowered not least by decades of merchant political mobilization.
Heavy investments in industrial production, a novelty in human history,
demanded a constant supply of land, labor, and money. As political
leaders grappled with the cotton famine, they saw that the emergence of
industrial capitalism had made them just as dependent on a predictable
supply of cheap raw materials as the manufacturers themselves. Lord
Palmerston warned in October 1861 that England must have cotton because
“we cannot allow millions of our People to perish.” The French Ministry
of Colonies commissioned reports on cotton growing prospects in such
diverse places as Guyana, Siam, Algeria, Egypt, and Senegal. The
outlines of a new kind of imperialism began to emerge.23</p>
<p>Responding to the urgent demand for cotton, forty-six hundred miles
to the east of Liverpool and ninety-two hundred miles from Antietam,
Indian merchants and cultivators, British colonial bureaucrats, and
Manchester manufacturers embarked on a frantic race to grow cotton for
world markets. As we have seen, Britain had tried to cultivate India as
a reliable source of cotton since the 1820s, yet the effort had been,
according to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, “a signal failure.” Indeed,
as The Economist noted before the outbreak of the Civil War, “As long as
there were negroes in the Southern States, and those negroes could be
kept to work, it would have been venturesome, not enterprising” to grow
cotton for world markets in India.24</p>
<p>The bombardment of Fort Sumter, however, announced that India’s hour
had come. For cotton merchants, manufacturers, and statesmen, no place
seemed more promising a source of cotton than India. Indeed, it was “the
only remedy for the misery that appeared to be hanging over us,”
according to Edmund Potter of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. During
the American Civil War, British cotton capitalists and colonial
bureaucrats worked feverishly to increase India’s cotton output and move
it to market. “Cotton,” as one observer wrote from Nagpore in July 1861,
“appears to me to be the leading topic of the day,” and the
English-language press of India was filled with hundreds if not
thousands of stories about cotton. Manchester manufacturers shipped
cottonseed to Bombay to be distributed to growers; they moved cotton
gins and cotton presses into the countryside; and they talked about
investing in railroads to remove cotton to the coast. They ran afoul,
however, of India’s well-known obstacles. In 1862, when the Manchester
Cotton Supply Association sent cotton gins and presses to India, they
planned to unload them in the newly constructed port of Sedashegur,
close to areas in which cotton was grown. Yet when the ships arrived,
they found that the port had not been finished. Eventually they moved
the gins and presses to another port, which did have facilities for
unloading, but the road linking this port to the cotton-growing areas
was not complete and the machinery could not be moved.25</p>
<p>Confronted with such problems, British cotton manufacturers,
especially through the channels of two organizations they dominated, the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the Manchester Cotton Supply
Association, redoubled their efforts to transform the Indian
countryside. After all, asked Manchester Chamber of Commerce member
Henry Ashworth, “what is the value of our possessions if we do not use
them?” Ashworth and others pressed a newly receptive British government
for massive infrastructure investments, changes in criminal codes to
make the adulteration of cotton a crime, and new property laws to create
clearly defined and easily marketable property in land.26</p>
<p>Such pressures by manufacturers and merchants to bring the state in
did not fall on deaf ears. Already in September 1861, the finance
minister of India, Samuel Laing, met with representatives of cotton
interests in Manchester to discuss ways to improve Indian cotton
production, meetings that would continue in Manchester, London, and
Bombay throughout the war. Charles Wood, the British foreign secretary
for India, saw the urgency as well, recommending “to get as much as
possible from India.” British colonial officials wrote dozens of reports
to investigate the cotton-growing potential of this or that area of
India.27</p>
<p>The British government and manufacturers agreed that the
administrative, legal, and infrastructural capacity of the imperial
state needed to be pushed into the Indian countryside. Perhaps most
important was manufacturers’ pressure to create a new kind of legal
environment in order to facilitate European investment in and domination
of cotton production. Cotton capitalists wanted to change Indian
contract law to make “penal the breach of contract where advances have
been made,” giving “the advancer an absolute lien upon the crop he
advances upon to the extent of his advances,” allowing for penalties
including prison at hard labor. If merchants could secure such an
absolute claim on cotton grown with the support of their capital,
investment would be encouraged, and it would help overcome “the
difficulty of enforcing the observance of legal Contracts with the
agricultural Population of India.” Such a system would permit
cultivators to devote their efforts entirely to cash crops, since
advances would allow them to purchase food grains before their own
cotton crop ripened. Eventually this pressure succeeded; new contract
laws were imposed. In 1863, moreover, criminal laws were enacted that
made the adulteration of cotton a crime punishable by imprisonment at
hard labor.28</p>
<p>Such market making went hand in hand with physical infrastructure
projects serving both the interests of the “Manchester people” and the
colonial state, especially the construction of railroads, which, as
Charles Wood remarked, would not only move cotton to ports but also
allow for the quick movement of troops to subdue rebellions. During the
first year of the war alone, government expenditures on infrastructure
projects in India nearly doubled. When in 1864 the British government
for India allocated £7 million to “Public Works,” the Times of India
commented that the “budget…may be considered as devoted to the express
object of opening up readier access from the field to the market.” Wood
himself, concerned about the pressures from Manchester, wrote in March
1863 to Sir Charles Trevelyan, India’s finance minister, to urge him to
spend more aggressively on infrastructure improvements, as not to do so
would be a “suicidal act.” “These roads,” warned Wood, “we must make.”
Moreover, the colonial government reduced the cotton-goods import duty
from 10 to 5 percent, a reduction that British manufacturers strongly
favored since they believed the duties gave “a fictitious encouragement
to…mechanically produced manufactures,” thereby “diverting the capital
and labour of India from the cultivation of the varied productions which
the soil would yield in great abundance.” India’s future, they agreed,
was not in manufacturing, but in the provision of raw cotton to European
industry.29</p>
<p>Yet despite such far-reaching interventions, manufacturers remained
dissatisfied with the British government. Their decades-old calls for
more state intervention now took on nearly hysterical tones, hastening
the emergence of an even tighter relationship between merchants,
manufacturers, and the imperial state, a relationship that became the
hallmark of the empire of cotton during the last third of the nineteenth
century and beyond.</p>
<p>The Manchester Chamber of Commerce consistently complained about the
government’s lack of commitment to cotton. Frustrated manufacturers
tried to increase pressure by taking their cause to Parliament. In June
1862 members of Parliament from cotton-consuming districts demanded
greater government commitment to infrastructure improvements in India to
facilitate the movement of cotton to world markets. “The supply of
cotton,” argued Stockport MP John Benjamin Smith on the occasion of this
debate, “is not a mere Lancashire question—it is a question of great
national importance.” These sentiments became so strong that Lancashire
manufacturers eventually complained publicly about Charles Wood, and
members of the Cotton Supply Association demanded nothing less than “the
impeachment of the incompetent Minister.” The British government replied
in kind, with Wood regularly expressing his annoyance with “the
Manchester people.” The manufacturers’ and the government’s interests
never entirely converged, because Charles Wood and other British
government officials were acutely aware of the dangers of upsetting
India’s fragile social order in the wake of the Rebellion of 1857, which
had severely challenged British rule in India. They understood, unlike
many manufacturers, that the transformation of the Indian countryside
was a gigantic project that entailed great risks.30</p>
<p>Yet like no other crisis before it, the cotton famine opened new
vistas on colonial raw material production. Even The Economist, the
world’s leading publicist for the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism,
eventually endorsed state involvement in securing cotton, especially
from India. It was hard to justify these steps in terms of the “laws of
supply and demand,” but eventually The Economist—and with it many
others—found a way: “The answer, at least a great part of the answer is,
that there appears to exist in many important parts of Indian society
very peculiar difficulties, which to some extent impede and counteract
the action of the primary motives upon which political economy depends
for its efficacy.” In India, it continued, “The primitive prerequisites
of common political economy…are not satisfied. You have a good-demanding
Englishman, but, in plain English, not a good-supplying Indian.” For
that reason, “There is no relaxation of the rules of political economy
in the interference of Government in a state of facts like this.
Government does not interfere to prevent the effect and operation of
‘supply and demand,’ but to create that operation to ensure that
effect…. There is no greater anomaly in recommending an unusual policy
for a State destitute of the ordinary economical capacities, than in
recommending an unusual method of education for a child both blind and
deaf.”31</p>
<p>Unlikely champions joined in this clamor for state intervention in
the global cotton-growing countryside. Cotton manufacturer, member of
Parliament, and free trade advocate Richard Cobden, for example, agreed
that Adam Smith’s ideas were not applicable when it came to India. Along
the same lines, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce called a special
meeting in July 1862 regarding the supply of cotton from India,
demanding “that public aid be given for this object by forwarding such
public works as will facilitate the production and transport of cotton
to the port of shipment, such as works of irrigation, roads, or
railways, and by amending and perfecting the Laws of Contract and Land
Tenure.” Manufacturers and colonial bureaucrats, faced with the cotton
famine, became increasingly impatient with the workings of the market.
As the superintendent of the Cotton Gin Factory in the Dharwar
Collectorate reported in May 1862, while “we are strongly impressed with
the belief, that, as a general rule, it is not judicious to interfere by
legislative enactments in matters connected with trade, but looking to
the circumstances of the present case,…to the immense importance of the
questions at the present time affecting not only local, but national,
interests, and to the apparent inefficiency of the present law, we are
forced to the conviction that exceptional and more stringent legislation
is necessary.” Wood, too, had come to believe that the operation of the
“laws of supply and demand” would not suffice to bring more cotton from
India to Britain, despite his fractious relations with the louder
elements of the cotton interests. Indian cultivators, so he believed,
preferred leisure to accumulation, resulting in lower production when
prices were high. India needed state reform and coercion if it hoped to
replace the American South in the cotton economy. The crisis of slavery
forced the imperial states to insert themselves in new ways into the
global cotton-growing countryside.32</p>
<p>The effectiveness of government interventions was furthered by
rapidly rising prices that lubricated the often balky transition to
world market production. The value of Indian cotton more than quadrupled
during the first two years of the war. As a result, Indian cultivators
began planting cotton on newly cleared land as well as on land once
devoted to food crops. This unprecedented dedication to export
agriculture, according to the U.S. consul in Calcutta, created “supplies
of unanticipated magnitude.” It paid handsomely during the war years and
helped European cotton manufacturers secure some of the raw material
they needed to keep their factories running. Whereas India had only
contributed 16 percent of Britain’s supply of raw cotton in 1860, and
1.1 percent of France’s in 1857, it contributed 75 percent in 1862 in
Britain and as much as 70 percent in France. Some of this cotton had
been diverted from domestic use and competing foreign markets
(especially China), while the rest was the result of a 50 percent
increase in production.33</p>
<p>Rural producers in western India in general and the province of
Berar—which the British had only acquired in 1853—in particular were
most responsible for this increase in output. The explosive growth of
Bombay can indeed be traced to the Civil War years, as Indian cotton
left its old channels of trade into Bengal and moved toward the great
European entrepôt. By 1863, ships burdened with cotton even sailed out
of Bombay harbor to New York. European merchants and manufacturers
complained about the poor quality of Indian cotton—it was less clean, of
shorter staple, and required the adjustment of machines—but Indian
cotton prevented the total collapse of the European cotton industries.
“The American slaveholders have done more to promote the development of
the resources of India by British capital,” observed the Cotton Supply
Reporter, “than British capitalists would ever have done without their
interference.” The crisis of American slavery in effect forced and
enabled the reconfiguration of the cotton-growing countryside
elsewhere.34</p>
<p>The wave of activity that transformed parts of India also rippled
through Egypt’s lower Nile Delta. In response to the desperate search by
cotton manufacturers for new sources of raw cotton, the Ottoman viceroy
Muhammad Sa’id Pasha quickly set about converting his own large
landholdings into vast cotton farms. According to Massachusetts cotton
manufacturer Edward Atkinson, Muhammad Sa’id became at a stroke “the
largest and best cultivator of cotton in the world,” but unbeknownst to
Atkinson, he did so in the context of an enormous wave of coercion and
violence descending on the Egyptian countryside, including the
importation of additional slaves from the Sudan.35</p>
<p>From the viceroy’s vantage point, his long-term project of
modernizing Egypt through the sale of cotton on world markets, a
project, as we have seen, begun about four decades earlier under Pasha
Muhammad Ali, now seemed closer than ever to fruition. New railroads,
new canals, new cotton gins, and new cotton presses were built. By 1864,
40 percent of all fertile land in Lower Egypt had been converted to
cotton farms. Egyptian rural cultivators, the fellaheen, quintupled
their cotton production between 1860 and 1865 from 50.1 million to 250.7
million pounds, marking a permanent economic change of such significance
that historians of Egypt rank the American Civil War among the most
crucial events in that country’s nineteenth-century history. The
fourteenfold increase in the value of cotton exports was “an economic
revolution.” And it was not surprising that when the viceroy traveled to
Manchester in 1862 in the midst of the American Civil War, he was given
a hero’s welcome.36</p>
<p>The effects of the Civil War also reached the northeastern coast of
Brazil. Decades earlier, subsistence farmers had occupied land belonging
to large estate owners in and around Pernambuco. Over time these
peasants began to cultivate small amounts of cotton to obtain cash for
necessities and taxes. When prices for cotton surged during the war and
British credit flooded the countryside, farmers abandoned their
subsistence crops to plant cotton for the world market. Collectively,
these cultivators more than doubled Brazilian cotton exports between
1860 and 1865.37</p>
<p>Cotton exports, 1860–66, in million pounds (illustration credit
9.2)</p>
<p>Rural cultivators in other regions of the world also responded to the
cotton famine. Western Anatolia, for example, saw its exports more than
triple to 31.5 million pounds by 1863, thanks to a coordinated effort by
private British cotton capitalists and the Imperial Command in Istanbul,
which created special privileges for cotton growers, distributed
American cottonseed, and extended railroads into the hinterland to
facilitate the transport of cotton to the coast. French colonial
officials in Algeria labored to increase cotton production during the
Civil War, pressured by manufacturers and the Société Industrielle de
Mulhouse, and supported by a number of private companies that raised
capital and set up operations there. In Argentina “the experiments to
spread the cultivation of cotton were started several times, especially
during the period of 1862–1865…when the export of cotton from the United
States declined as a result of the Civil War.” In Mexico, a future
cotton power, cotton planting increased to serve the Union market, and
the value of cotton exports skyrocketed by a factor of eight between
1861 and 1865. The Peruvian cotton industry’s exports quadrupled.
Similarly, one of the world’s largest crops, Chinese cotton, broke over
the steep banks of its broad domestic market and poured into world
markets. Transcaucasian and Central Asian cotton made its presence felt
in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. West African cotton, thanks to the joint
efforts of African merchants and French colonialists, found eager buyers
in Alsace and Normandy. And along the Atlantic coast of Africa, in the
future German colony of Togo, African merchants employed their slaves in
the production of cotton for shipment to Liverpool.38</p>
<p>The cotton rush indeed sparked even more fanciful scenarios among
political economists, manufacturers, and merchants who hoped that this
or that region of the world would fill the gap left by the war,
testifying to the chaotic and experimental nature of this response to
the Civil War. The Manchester Guardian repeatedly trumpeted the cotton
prospects of various parts of Africa, India, Australia, and the Middle
East. “L’Afrique est le vrai pays du coton,” pronounced one French
observer optimistically in 1864. “Queensland,” argued the Australian
Queensland Guardian in 1861, “must be cottonized.” To the chagrin of
cotton manufacturers and gullible investors, not all such plans worked
out during the war years. The quantity of African, Argentinean, and
Central Asian cotton sold on the world market remained small and the
obstacles in those regions remained too great for private capital, even
in concert with desperate European governments, to overcome.39</p>
<p>Nonetheless, during the American Civil War, merchants, manufacturers,
and statesmen glimpsed the future shape of the empire of cotton. They
engaged, as Samuel B. Ruggles explained to the New York Chamber of
Commerce, in a “great effort for the commercial emancipation of the
civilized nations of the earth.”40 Because of them, Indian, Egyptian,
and Brazilian cotton became a major presence on Western markets. Their
experience during the cotton famine, moreover, had opened bold new
vistas of colonial adventure and state involvement in commodity markets.
While private investment and lobbying of the state had characterized the
antebellum efforts of cotton merchants and manufacturers, the cotton
famine sharply raised the dependence of these cotton capitalists on the
state and on their own political sophistication. Colonialism had become
a matter of urgent self-interest, as capitalists grasped how vulnerable
their global networks and huge capital investments were to local
disruption and how unstable slavery had become.</p>
<p>Yet the question of the future role of American cotton in the global
economy remained. Would it return to market? And if so, would slaves
still be growing it?</p>
<p>“The biggest commercial catastrophe in the world.” French engineer
Charles Joseph Minard maps the impact of the Civil War on the global
cotton industry. (illustration credit 9.3)</p>
<p>Some cotton manufacturers and merchants in Europe went as far as to
hope for a permanent separation of the Union to enable the continued
growing of cotton by slaves in an internationally recognized
Confederacy. They believed that the cotton empire depended for the
foreseeable future on slavery. In France, the procureur général reported
widespread sentiments among mill owners in the textile region of Alsace
that “from a commercial point of view, the separation would be a boon
for us due to the ease that the South was willing to give the European
Trade.” The procureur général of Colmar observed in 1862 that public
opinion more and more favors the “prompt recognition of the
Confederacy.” Le Havre merchants were nearly as vocal in their support
for the cause of the Confederacy, the Courier du Havre being at the
forefront of such sentiments. Many of the propertied in Great Britain
similarly opposed the northern cause, motivated by antidemocratic
attitudes and a preference for a divided and weakened power in North
America, yet concerns about cotton certainly came into their
calculations as well: When John Arthur Roebuck advocated in the House of
Commons for the recognition of the Confederacy, he did not tire of
mentioning the fate of Lancashire textile workers and their need for
cotton. Tellingly, Liverpool, the world’s largest cotton port, was the
most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.
Liverpool merchants helped bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the
Union navy, built warships for the Confederacy, and supplied the South
with military equipment and credit. The Liverpool Southern Club, as well
as the Central Association for the Recognition of the Confederate
States, agitated for permanent separation. Even the Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce entertained the benefits of an independent Confederacy.
Liverpool’s mercantile community believed, as the Browns’ Liverpool
partner Francis Alexander Hamilton wrote in August 1861, that “no
earthly power could reunite the two sections,” and that a Union victory
was “an utter impossibility.”41</p>
<p>Liverpool was not alone. In Manchester, the Southern Club and the
Manchester Southern Independence Association agitated for the South. In
1862, thousands of participants, some of them workers, staged rallies in
British cotton towns, demanding government recognition of the
Confederacy. Even though many workers supported the Union as its
struggle became increasingly identified with the struggle for free
labor, elite sentiment tended to favor the Confederacy with the
president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce expressing his
expectation that “permanent secession of the Southern States was
inevitable.”42</p>
<p>“Well, yes! it is certain that ‘Cotton’ is more useful to me than
‘Wool!!’ ” Northerners fear that Britain will abandon its neutrality to
secure cotton, 1862 or 1863. (illustration credit 9.4)</p>
<p>Such sentiments, while not universal among cotton manufacturers and
merchants, had the potential to influence the position of governments,
especially of Britain and France, toward the American war. The Union,
which had an overwhelming interest in maintaining the neutrality of
European governments, took the threat seriously. The Confederacy, for
its part, saw gaining international recognition as its single most
important foreign policy goal. Of course there were good reasons not to
intervene: Britain had to consider the fate of its Canadian provinces,
and its growing dependence on wheat and corn imports from the northern
United States, while continental powers such as France, Russia, and
Prussia had an interest in maintaining a strong United States to balance
British economic and military power. But European mediation of the
conflict and even European recognition of the Confederacy always
remained a possibility, its advocates almost invariably touting the
advantages of an independent Confederacy as a source of cotton.43</p>
<p>Social upheaval, including demonstrations, riots, and strikes (more
than fifty in France alone) in the cotton manufacturing regions
increased the anxiety of state bureaucrats and capitalists. Before
becoming prime minister of Great Britain, William Gladstone, among
others, cited this fear of social upheaval in Lancashire as a reason for
European intervention in the American conflict. In 1862, in a public
speech, Gladstone drew a dire picture of the social and financial impact
of the cotton famine, though lauding the patience of England’s workers,
comparing the importance of the cotton famine to the other two
calamities that had befallen the British Empire, the Irish famine and
the Indian mutiny.44</p>
<p>Cotton interests constantly pressured the Lincoln administration to
keep the needs of European cotton consumers in mind. The diplomatic
correspondence between the British Foreign Office and the British
embassy in Washington, D.C., suggests that Foreign Minister Earl Russell
along with the French government exerted considerable pressure on the
Union administration. “I went to the State department on the 25th [of
July 1863] and spoke to Mr. Seward about the cotton,” reported the
British ambassador to Washington, Lord Lyons, to London. “I told him
that we had waited with the greatest patience while the military
operations were going on upon the Mississippi, but that now the River
was open, and the time has come at which we had been promised an ample
supply. What was he prepared to do to redeem his promises?” Lincoln was
well aware of the importance of cotton in the conflict. In his first
annual message on December 3, 1861, he argued that “the principal lever
relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility
against us…is the embarrassment of commerce.” And by mid-1862, as the
cabinet discussed Lincoln’s plan for emancipation of slaves in rebel
states, Seward argued successfully against such “immediate promulgation”
and “strongly in favor of cotton and foreign governments.” Seward feared
that announcement of emancipation would lead to European recognition of
the Confederacy. His ears close to the ground, he recognized the
potentially revolutionary implications of the American struggle to
global capitalism and urged caution.45</p>
<p>American diplomats too were frequently reminded of Europe’s urgent
need for cotton. When William Thayer, the American consul to Alexandria,
Egypt, traveled to London in the summer of 1862, he reported to Seward
that recognition was very much on the mind of British policy elites.
That same year, the American minister to Brussels, Henry Sanford, was
confronted by the French secretary of state, who cautioned that “We are
nearly out of cotton, and cotton we must have.” When in the spring of
1862 Louis Napoleon conversed with William L. Dayton, the U.S. minister
in Paris, he hoped “that something will be done by your government to
relieve the difficulties here, growing out of the want of cotton.”
Pressured by widespread demands among cotton industrialists, the French
government engaged in diplomatic efforts to end the American conflict,
so that, as Mulhouse cotton manufacturer Gustave Imbert-Koechlin
pronounced, “peace may reign between the two American states.”
Confederate diplomats in Europe, encouraged by such complaints, knew
that Europe’s need for southern cotton was the strongest arrow in their
diplomatic arsenal and launched it with increasing desperation as the
tide of war turned against the South.46</p>

cotton: Lord Lyons, as photographed by Mathew Brady (illustration credit
9.5)</p>
<p>Union diplomats desperately tried to counteract such sentiments by
making concerted efforts to communicate to the European public directly.
Charles Francis Adams advised his son in 1861 that it would be useful if
he would author a pamphlet about the cotton question. “Two things are
necessary to the production of cotton—an abundance of labor and a cotton
soil,” he wrote. “Look into the question of soil first,” he advised,
arguing that a whole range of places around the globe had the necessary
environmental conditions to grow cotton. In some parts of the world, he
added, labor was abundant as well, such as in India and Egypt, while in
other parts of the world “there is no labor and here the cooly question
rises.” Adams saw an opportunity in the war to allow other cotton
producers to emerge, and to undo permanently the South’s near monopoly.
“The importance of this struggle [for the blockade and for new sources
of cotton] cannot be overestimated.” On “the consequent cotton pressure
throughout the world hangs the destruction of American slavery.”47</p>
<p>Indeed, the best way to make the war against the Confederacy
palatable to powerful cotton interests in Europe was to demonstrate that
inexpensive cotton could be secured elsewhere. And the U.S. government
indeed did its best to encourage production in other parts of the world,
for example by moving vast quantities of cottonseed abroad. Washington,
wrote Seward in April 1862, had “an obvious duty…to examine the
capacities of other countries for cotton culture and stimulate it as
much as possible, and thus to counteract the destructive designs of the
factious monopolists at home.” Egypt, with its long-staple crop, was of
particular importance in these calculations since it could replace
American exports with a high-quality substitute, unlike Indian cotton.
Throughout the war years, Thayer met regularly with the viceroy to
discuss cotton production and eventually hired a confidant of the
viceroy, Ayoub Bey Trabulsi, to examine “the cottons of Egypt.” Thanks
to such contacts, Thayer was able to report by November 1862 that “the
Vice Roy has exerted his influence to aid in the increased
cultivation…he has…advised all the large proprietors hereafter to sow
one fourth of their land with cotton. As the advice of His Highness is
practically equivalent to a command, the proprietors have commenced…to
expedite the great agricultural revolution now in progress.”48</p>
<p>Seward projected confidence that such efforts would succeed and
especially emphasized the unforeseen effects of global cotton production
on the South’s bid for independence. “The insurrectionary cotton States
will be blind to their own welfare if they do not see how their
prosperity and all their hopes are passing away, when they find Egypt,
Asia Minor and India supplying the world with cotton, and California
furnishing the gold for its purchase.”49</p>
<p>And indeed, these overtures of American policy makers did help to
defuse tensions between Washington and European capitals. In the spring
of 1862, Baring Brothers Liverpool expressed the view that war between
the United States and Great Britain was less likely “provided we get a
large import from India.” Charles Wood argued in August 1862 that “our
only domestic trouble,…the distress in Lancashire,…may be much
mitigated, if any reasonable quantity worth speaking of can come from
India beyond what she sent last year.” By 1863, widespread cotton
imports from India had alleviated the cotton crisis in France. Indeed by
early 1864 the procureurs généraux of various cotton manufacturing
districts could report that cotton imports from India and Egypt had
relieved pressure on manufacturers, as factories started slowly to
produce again and, as a result, “the struggle…lost a great deal of
interest in our département.”50 As Seward put it a few years after the
war, in 1872, when he came to the Indian city of Agra—the site of the
Taj Mahal—to visit a cotton gin there, “From the tomb of the Mogul
monarch Of India, Akbar, we passed to the tomb of the pretended monarch
of America, King Cotton.”51</p>
<p>Once significant amounts of cotton arrived from sources other than
the United States, the political pressure on European governments from
cotton interests declined. Edward Atkinson, the Boston cotton
manufacturer, was relieved that the “supposed dependence of Europe upon
the Cotton States has proved to be an utter fallacy,” and thought it
possible that soon “Europe will become absolutely independent of this
country for her supply.” By 1863, even those whose livelihood depended
on cotton, and who had once been advocates of the cause of the southern
states, began to envision a diverse supply network of raw cotton without
reliance on slaves.52</p>
<p>Some even began to see the obstinacy of the South, in its demands for
independence and its attachment to slavery, as the real cause of
disruption to the world economy. After all, cotton merchants and
manufacturers, unlike southern planters and their government, were not
invested in a particular source of cotton—the American South—nor in a
particular system of labor to produce it—slavery. All they required was
a secure and predictable supply of inexpensive cotton in the qualities
they desired.</p>
<p>Yet it was one thing to respond to short-term supply disruptions
resulting from a blockade, and another to imagine an empire of cotton
without slavery. Based on their readings of the history of the cotton
empire during the previous eighty years, many merchants and
manufacturers feared that the potential disruption of the “deep
relationship between slavery and cotton production” might, as the Bremer
Handelsblatt put it, “destroy one of the essential conditions of the
mass production” of cotton textiles.53</p>
<p>As early as 1861, when Union general John C. Frémont emancipated
slaves in Missouri, The Economist worried that such a “fearful measure”
might spread to other slaveholding states, “inflict[ing] utter ruin and
universal desolation on those fertile territories.” The Cotton Supply
Reporter went as far as to evoke “the horrors of a second St. Domingue,”
should the war become a war for emancipation, and predicted that in such
a case the United States’ “marvelous cotton-producing industry must
suddenly collapse.” It was not surprising that people with such beliefs
would come to see the fall of Richmond as of such consequence, according
to the hyperventilating Bremer Handelsblatt, that even the “richest
imagination was too poor to envisage its implications.”54</p>
<p>Considering these fears, it was the more remarkable that 4 million
slaves in the United States—among them the world’s most important cotton
growers—gained their freedom during or immediately after the war.
Encouraged by their perception of their masters’ weakness in the face of
a national government bent on subduing the rebels, slaves embarked upon
an agrarian insurrection. By deserting plantations, withdrawing their
labor power, giving intelligence to federal troops, and eventually
taking up arms as Union soldiers, American slaves pressed to make a
sectional war into a war of emancipation. And they succeeded. Never
before and never thereafter did cotton growers revolt with similar
success, their strength fortuitously amplified by a deep and
irreconcilable split within the nation’s elite.55</p>
<p>The Impact of the American Civil War on the Global Cotton Industry,
1861–1865</p>
<p>With slavery unlikely to be resurrected in face of such unprecedented
revolt, cotton capitalists searched for new ways to mobilize
cotton-growing labor. They could not find much reassurance in past
cotton-growing experiences in other regions of the world. At prevailing
antebellum world market prices, few cultivators in India, Brazil, or
Africa, had produced much cotton for European markets, despite the best
efforts of some manufacturers. Peasants had tenaciously clung to
subsistence farming, and the fraction who did cultivate cotton for
markets sold it to nearby spinners, not to Liverpool or Le Havre
merchants. Even in the United States itself, as slaves gained their
freedom during the war, many of them quickly abandoned the industrial
rhythm of the plantation and instead tried to focus on subsistence
agriculture.56</p>
<p>Moreover, the experience of earlier emancipations in the Caribbean,
in Saint-Domingue above all, had deflated the hopes of merchants and
manufacturers about cash-crop production by former slaves. As early as
1841, Herman Merivale had observed that it was difficult to compel “the
negroes to perform hired labour while they have their own provision
grounds, and other resources, at their disposal.” The (British) Select
Committee investigating “the existing relations between Employers and
Labourers” in the West Indies had similarly noted in 1842 that the
production of agricultural commodities had diminished in the wake of
emancipation because “the labourers are enabled to live in comfort and
to acquire wealth without, for the most part, labouring on the estates
of the Planters for more than three or four days in a week.” As The
Economist put it, “in the tropics Nature has given man the benefit, or
the curse, of a perpetual poor law, a prodigality of food which of
itself established a minimum of wages.”57</p>
<p>For British colonial official W. H. Holmes the dilemma was clear:
“When the slave became a free man…his first desire was also to become
independent; to be completely his own master.” In Guyana, which he
studied carefully, “a trifling amount of labour procures the few
luxuries, which a most fertile soil fails to place within reach,” making
it unlikely that farmers would grow export crops for wages. Vegetables,
fish, and fruit were available for the asking, a situation that, “in my
opinion, [has] been fraught with evil consequences.” French colonial
bureaucrats had come to essentially the same conclusion: Once “free…the
Black…returns to the hut of the savage.” Freedpeople’s retreat into
subsistence agriculture, envisioned by so many former slaves as a true
foundation for their new freedom, was the worst nightmare of cotton
merchants and manufacturers the world over.58 European observers’
concerns about freedpeople were further amplified by developments in the
Caribbean, such as the 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica, when a
group of black Jamaicans revolted against the harsh punishment the
colonial administration had inflicted on a group of squatters, a
rebellion that was suppressed by an orgy of violence by British
troops.</p>
<p>Landowners, manufacturers, merchants, and statesmen concluded from
this reading of past experiences that emancipation was potentially
threatening to the well-being of the world’s mechanized cotton industry.
Consequently, they worked zealously to find ways to reconstruct durably
the worldwide web of cotton production, to transform the global
countryside without resorting to slavery. Already during the war itself,
in articles and books, speeches and letters, they belabored the question
of if and where cotton could be grown by nonslave labor. Edward
Atkinson, for example, contributed to this debate as early as 1861 with
his Cheap Cotton by Free Labor, and one year later, William Holmes’s
Free Cotton: How and Where to Grow It extended the discussion. An
anonymous French author added his voice the same year with Les blancs et
les noirs en Amérique et le coton dans les deux mondes.59</p>
<p>Soon such treatises were informed by lessons drawn from the Civil War
experiences. The sudden turn to nonslave cotton during the Civil War
years in Egypt, Brazil, and India as well as in Union-controlled zones
of the American South represented, after all, a global experiment: What
would a world with cotton but without slaves look like?</p>
<p>These rehearsals—for a new postwar, postslavery cotton
empire—nurtured two somewhat contradictory faiths. Few observers
reckoned that enough cotton could be procured to permit cotton
manufacturing to continue its dramatic expansion even without slavery.
This was, for example, the judgment of the English Ladies’ Free Grown
Cotton movement, a loose association of women who committed themselves
to purchasing only cloth produced with free labor cotton. And, perhaps
most optimistically, it was embraced by Republicans in the United States
such as Edward Atkinson, who believed that cotton production in the
American South could be expanded dramatically through the use of “free
labor”—that is, as long as freedpeople did not remain content with
subsistence agriculture. Atkinson, impressed by his own successes in
staffing his cotton mills with wage workers, fervently believed that the
future of the United States’—and the world’s—cotton supply depended on
the ability of southern landowners and the southern states to motivate
freed slaves to produce cotton.60</p>
<p>Yet the Civil War experience also had shown that nonslave cotton had
entered world markets only under conditions of unsustainably high
prices; after all, the price of Indian cotton had more than quadrupled
and earlier efforts to bring Indian cotton to market at lower prices had
largely failed. Moreover, from the perspective of 1864 and 1865,
emancipation was accompanied by considerable social turmoil in the
American South. Cotton capitalists’ widespread belief that freedom would
bring a permanent reduction in the supplies of raw cotton was thus
reasonable and was expressed most directly in the fact that postbellum
cotton prices remained well above their prewar level. Breathless reports
came into Liverpool, such as the one received by the Rathbones which
predicted that “negro labour could not be depended on for next year.”
The Barings, in turn, asserted that “few appear to think that labour can
be sufficiently reorganized in the South to plant and pick a crop next
season exceeding 1½ million bales.” (In 1860, the cotton crop had been
5.4 million bales.)61</p>
<p>As fears of permanently reduced cotton harvests spread through cotton
circles, pressure for a reconstruction of plantation agriculture in the
American South after the defeat of the Confederacy mounted, especially
the orderly return of cotton cultivators to the fields. The Bremer
Handelsblatt called for a policy of forgiveness toward the defeated
planter elite. In the spring of 1865, the British minister to
Washington, Sir Frederick William Adolphus Bruce, reported back to
London on the status of Reconstruction, severely critiquing the
“ultra-Republicans,” and reminding President Andrew Johnson to take into
account the urgent need to revive cotton production. The question of if
and how freedpeople would work occupied him; he feared that “the
emancipation of the Negroes will be a great blow to the material
prosperity of the cotton and sugar growing States.” Concerned about
upheavals in the South and critical of efforts to extend suffrage rights
to freedpeople, he approvingly reported in May 1865 that “everywhere
measures are being taken to force the Negroes to work, and to teach them
that freedom means working for wages instead of masters.”62</p>
<p>Yet cotton capitalists and government bureaucrats also had learned
much broader lessons during the war. Most important, they understood
that labor, not land, constrained the production of cotton. Members of
the Manchester Cotton Supply Association, the world’s leading experts on
such matters, understood that land and climate of a “quality equal and
in many cases superior to that” of America was available in many
different parts of the globe. But these experts on global cotton found
that “the very first requisite, which was labor” was more difficult to
find. As the British finance minister for India, Samuel Laing, remarked,
“The question of the abolition of slavery over the world, depends
probably upon the question whether cotton produced by free labor in
India can undersell cotton the produce of slavery in America.”63</p>
<p>But where should this labor come from? During the Civil War, as we
have seen, the efforts of cotton interests focused squarely on accessing
labor in regions that formerly had not grown significant amounts of
cotton for European markets. The president of the Cotton Supply
Association summarized this strategy succinctly: “We are now opening up
the interior.” This strategy had a long history; the Civil War, however,
had focused the energies of capitalists and statesmen in unprecedented
ways.64</p>
<p>This rapid geographic expansion of the global web of cotton
production was deeply entangled with efforts to find new ways to
motivate rural cultivators to grow the white gold and move it to market.
How could rulers make peasants grow crops that, as political scientist
Timothy Mitchell put it so well, “they could not eat, or process to
serve local needs”? Or how could, as the French observer M. J. Mathieu
asked far less delicately in 1861, “black workers be disciplined and
stimulated”?65</p>
<p>Throughout the empire of cotton, bureaucrats and capitalists agonized
over the question of whether “the negroe will from now on be a
industrious worker.”66 In an unusually long article, The Economist took
the occasion of the end of the Civil War to engage in an extended
deliberation on the issue, arguing:</p>
<p>There is probably no one point of politics which involves economic
results so wide or so permanent as the relation between the white and
the dark races of the world…. It is probably the destiny, it is even now
the function, it is certainly the interest of the European, and more
particularly of the English family of mankind, to guide and urge and
control the industrial enterprises of all Asia, of all Africa, and of
those portions of America settled by African, Asiatic, or hybrid races.
Those enterprises are very large indeed…. The one necessity essential to
the development of these new sources of prosperity is the arrangement of
some industrial system under which very large bodies of dark labourers
will work willingly under a very few European supervisors. It is not
only individual labour which is required, but organized labour, labour
so scientifically arranged that the maximum of result shall be obtained
at a minimum of cost, that immense sudden efforts, such as are required
in tunnel cutting, cotton picking and many other operations, shall be
possible without strikes or quarrels, and that, above all, there shall
be no unnatural addition to the price of labour in the shape of bribes
to the workmen to obey orders naturally repulsive to their
prejudices.</p>
<p>To be sure, The Economist argued, “All these ends were secured, it
must freely be acknowledged, by slavery. For the mere execution of great
works cheaply no organization could be equal to that which placed the
skilled European at the top, and made him despotic master of the
half-skilled black or copper-coloured labourer below…” But slavery had
also “moral and social consequences which are not beneficial.” And for
that reason, “A new organization therefore must be commenced, and the
only one as yet found to work effectively is…one based upon perfect
freedom and mutual self-interest…. If, however, complete freedom is to
be the principle adopted, it is clear that the dark races must in some
way or other be induced to obey white men willingly.”67</p>
<p>But how would “the dark races…be induced to obey white men
willingly”? The Civil War had unintentionally transformed the
possibilities for where and how cotton might be grown, overturning in
one stroke the balance between coerced and free labor in the global web
of cotton production. The determined efforts of slaves themselves and
the advance of the Union army bolstered by newly freed men and women had
destroyed the system of chattel slavery that for 250 years had fueled
both war capitalism and the Industrial Revolution. But the newly
emerging order in the world’s cotton fields was still up for
grabs.68</p>
<p>The outlines of what this reconstruction would look like were only
glimpsed here and there during the Civil War itself. Yet by century’s
end, the world of cotton would look dramatically different. The speed
and flexibility with which merchants, manufacturers, and agricultural
producers responded to the crisis revealed their adaptability and, not
least, their capacity for marshaling new, indirect, but far-reaching
forms of state power to secure labor in place of direct ownership of
human beings. “The emancipation of the enslaved races and the
regeneration of the people of the East,” observed the Revue de Deux
Mondes perceptively, “were intimately connected.”69</p>
<p>When the guns fell silent on the North American continent in April
1865, the greatest turmoil in the eighty-five-year history of a
European-dominated cotton industry came to an end. New systems for the
mobilization of labor had been tested around the world—from coolie
workers to sharecropping to wage labor—and while it was still uncertain
if cotton production would return to antebellum levels, belief in the
possibility of “free labor” cotton had become nearly universal. As
former slaves throughout the United States celebrated their freedom,
manufacturers and workers looked forward to factories running again at
capacity, fueled by newly plentiful cotton supplies.</p>
<p>Merchants, however, had little to celebrate. “The peace rumor caused
almost a panic,” reported Baring Brothers Liverpool to their
counterparts in London in February 1865. When the Indian Daily News, in
an “extraordinary” issue, reported in early March of the capture of
Charleston by Union forces, it observed, “Panic in Liverpool. Cotton
down to one shilling,” a panic that rapidly spread to Bombay itself.
Boston ice merchant Calvin W. Smith reported from Bombay that “I am
sorry to say such long faces I never saw on any set of mortals as the
English andandandand Parsees put on here. Our success at home is their
ruination. Let that war end in one year, and there will be more failures
in this town, than in any one place anywhere. Such wild speculation as
has been going on here for the last four years, never was heard of
before.” In Liverpool panic prevailed as well. Liverpool cotton merchant
Samuel Smith remembered, “It was pitiable to see men who had bought fine
mansions and costly picture galleries, hanging about ‘the flags,’
watching the chance of borrowing a guinea from an old friend.”70</p>
<p>This global panic illuminated to peasants, workers, manufacturers,
and merchants how closely intertwined developments all over the world
had become. Battles fought in rural Virginia reverberated in small
villages in Berar and Lower Egypt, a farmer’s crop choice in Brazil
rested on his reading of the Liverpool market, and real estate prices
collapsed in Bombay as soon as news of the Union’s destruction of
Richmond reached India’s shores. A British observer was amazed at these
new global links that the Civil War had brought to the fore. “We have
seen how potent and how quick,” he wrote, “the effects of ‘price’ was in
the most distant parts of the globe.”71</p>
<p>The world indeed had become smaller, and the way cotton held parts of
it together had changed significantly. If the Civil War was a moment of
crisis for the empire of cotton, it was also a rehearsal for its
reconstruction. Cotton capitalists were confident from their triumphs in
recasting industrial production at home. As they surveyed the ashes of
the South, they saw promising new levers that might move the mountain of
free labor into cotton cultivation with new lands, new labor relations,
and new connections between them. But perhaps most important, cotton
capitalists had learned that the lucrative global trade networks they
had spun could only be protected and maintained by unprecedented state
activism. Meanwhile, statesmen understood that these networks had become
essential to the social order of their nations and hence a crucial
bulwark of political legitimacy, resources, and power. Thus the French
observer was correct when he predicted in 1863, “The empire of cotton is
ensured; King Cotton is not dethroned.”72</p>
