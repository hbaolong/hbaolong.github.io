Mobilizing Industrial Labor</h4>
<p>Cotton workers in England (illustration credit 7.1)</p>
<p>In 1935, while living in Danish exile, a young German writer sat down
to consider how the modern world had come into being. Bertolt Brecht
channeled his thoughts through the voice of an imaginary “Worker Who
Reads.” That worker asked many questions, including:</p>
<p>Who built Thebes of the seven gates?</p>
<p>In the books you will find the name of kings.</p>
<p>Did the kings haul up the lumps of rock?</p>
<p>And Babylon, many times demolished.</p>
<p>Who raised it up so many times? In what houses</p>
<p>Of gold-glittering Lima did the builders live?1</p>
<p>Brecht might as well have been talking about a very different empire,
that of cotton. By his time, the legend of cotton was well documented;
history books were filled with the stories of those who harnessed the
plant’s unique gifts, Richard Arkwright and John Rylands, Francis Cabot
Lowell and Eli Whitney. But as with any industry, the empire itself was
sustained by millions of unnamed workers, who labored on cotton
plantations and farms, and in spinning and weaving mills throughout the
world, including in Brecht’s hometown of Augsburg. Indeed, it was in
Augsburg, as we have seen, that Hans Fugger had accumulated his riches
in the nonmechanized production of cottons more than half a millennium
earlier.</p>
<p>Like Brecht’s haulers and builders, few cotton workers have entered
our history books. Most left not even a trace; too often they were
illiterate, and almost always their waking hours were occupied with
holding body and soul together, leaving little time to write letters or
diaries, as their social betters did, and thus few ways for us to piece
their lives together. One of the saddest sights to this day is
St. Michael’s Flags in Manchester, a small park where allegedly forty
thousand people, most of them cotton workers, lie buried in unmarked
graves, one on top of the other, “an almost industrial process of
burying the dead.” Ellen Hootton was one of these rare exceptions.
Unlike millions of others, she entered the historical record when in
June 1833 she was called before His Majesty’s Factory Inquiry
Commission, which was charged with investigating child labor in British
textile mills. Though only ten when she appeared before the committee
and frightened, she was already a seasoned worker, a two-year veteran of
the cotton mill. Ellen had drawn public attention because a group of
middle-class Manchester activists concerned with labor conditions in the
factories sprouting in and around their city had sought to use her case
to highlight the abuse of children. They asserted that she was a child
slave, forced to work not just in metaphorical chains, but in real ones,
penalized by a brutal overseer.2</p>
<p>The commission, determined to show that the girl was a “notorious
liar” who could not be trusted, questioned Ellen, her mother, Mary, and
her overseer William Swanton, as well as factory manager John Finch. Yet
despite their efforts to whitewash the case, the accusations proved to
be essentially true: Ellen was the only child of Mary Hootton, a single
mother, who was herself a handloom weaver barely able to make a living.
Until she turned seven, Ellen had received some child support from her
father, also a weaver, but once that expired her mother brought her down
to a nearby factory to add to the family’s meager income. After as many
as five months of unpaid labor (it was said that she had to learn the
trade first), she became one of the many children working at Eccles’
Spinning Mill. When asked about her workday, Ellen said it began at
five-thirty in the morning and ended at eight in the evening, with two
breaks, one for breakfast and one for lunch. The overseer, Mr. Swanton,
explained that Ellen worked in a room with twenty-five others, three
adults, the rest children. She was, in her own words, a “piecer at
throstles”—a tedious job that entailed repairing and reknotting broken
threads as they were pulled onto the bobbin of the mule. With constant
breakage, often several times a minute, she only had a few seconds to
finish her task.</p>
<p>It was all but impossible to keep up with the speed of the machine as
it moved back and forth, so she sometimes had “her ends down”—that is,
she had not attached the loose and broken ends of the thread fast
enough. Such errors were costly. Ellen reported being beaten by Swanton
“twice a week” until her “head was sore with his hands.” Swanton denied
the frequency of the beatings, but admitted using “a strap” to
discipline the girl. Her mother, who called her daughter “a naughty,
stupid girl,” testified that she approved of such corporal punishment,
and had even asked Swanton to be more severe to put an end to her habit
of running away. Life was hard for Mary Hootton, she desperately needed
the girl’s wages, and she begged Swanton repeatedly to keep on the girl,
despite all the troubles. As Mary said, “I cries many a times.”</p>
<p>The beatings, however, were not the worst treatment Ellen experienced
at Swanton’s hands. One day, when she arrived late to work, Swanton
penalized her even more severely: He hung an iron weight around her neck
(there was no agreement about whether it weighed sixteen or twenty
pounds) and made her walk up and down the factory floor. The other
children heckled her, and as a result, “she fell down several times
while fighting with the other hands. She fought them with the stick.”
Even today, nearly two hundred years later, the pain of the girl’s life,
from the tedium of her work to the violence of her abuse, is hard to
fathom.</p>
<p>While the city of Manchester sports a Rylands Library, Harvard
University a Lowell student dormitory, and while every grade-school
student learns about Richard Arkwright and Eli Whitney, there is of
course no library or school named for Ellen Hootton. No one but a
handful of historians knows anything about her life. Yet when we think
about the world of cotton manufacturing, we should think of Ellen
Hootton. Without her labor and that of millions of children, women, and
men, the empire of cotton would have never been built. Neither Rylands
nor Lowell would have accumulated their riches, and Arkwright’s and
Eli’s inventions would have collected dust in the corner of a barn.
Ellen’s story highlights the physical violence of punishment, but as
important, the more banal violence of economic desperation, which
brought ever larger numbers of people into factories, where they spent
their lives, quite literally, in the service of the empire of
cotton.</p>
<p>Like Ellen Hootton, thousands and, by the 1850s, millions of workers
streamed into the world’s newly built factories to operate the machines
that produced cotton thread and cloth.3 The ability to mobilize so many
women, children, and men to work in factories was awe-inspiring. Many a
contemporary was overwhelmed by the sight of hundreds or even thousands
of workers walking to and from their places of toil. Every morning
before sunrise, thousands of workers walked down narrow paths in the
Vosges to the factories in the valley, crawled out of dormitory beds
just up the hill from Quarry Bank Mill, left their struggling farms
above the Llobregat River, and made their way through crowded Manchester
streets to one of the dozens of mills lining its putrid canals. At night
they returned to sparse dormitories where they slept several to a bed,
or to cold and drafty cottages, or to densely populated and poorly
constructed working-class neighborhoods in Barcelona, Chemnitz, or
Lowell.</p>
<p>The world had seen extreme poverty and labor exploitation for
centuries, but it had never seen a sea of humanity organizing every
aspect of their lives around the rhythms of machine production. For at
least twelve hours a day, six days a week, women, children, and men fed
machines, operated machines, repaired machines, and supervised machines.
They opened tightly packed bales of raw cotton, fed piles of cotton into
carding machines, they moved the huge carriages of mules back and forth,
they tied together broken yarn ends (as did Ellen Hootton), they removed
yarn from filled spindles, they supplied necessary roving to the
spinning machines, or they simply carried cotton through the factory.
Discipline was maintained through petty fines and forced forfeiture of
contracts: A list of dismissal cases from one early-nineteenth-century
mill had official justifications ranging from banal disciplinary issues,
such as “using ill language,” to idiosyncratic charges, like “Terrifying
S. Pearson with her ugly face.” Maintaining a disciplined labor force
would prove consistently difficult. In one English mill, of the 780
apprentices recruited in the two decades after 1786, 119 ran away, 65
died, and another 96 had to return to overseers or parents who had
originally lent them out. It was, after all, the beginning of the era of
William Blake’s “dark satanic mill.”4</p>
<p>Winter or summer, rain or shine, workers ventured into buildings
rising several stories high, usually made of brick, and labored in vast
rooms, often hot, and almost always humid, dusty, and deafeningly noisy.
They worked hard, lived in poverty, and died young. As political
economist Leone Levi put it in 1863, “Enter for a moment one of those
numerous factories; behold the ranks of thousands of operatives all
steadily working; behold how every minute of time, every yard of space,
every practiced eye, every dexterous finger, every inventive mind, is at
high-pressure service.”5</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the importance and revolutionary nature
of this new organization of human labor. Today we take this system for
granted: Most of us make a living by selling our labor for a certain
number of hours a day; with the result—our paycheck—we purchase the
things we need. And we also take for granted that machines set the pace
of human activity. Not so in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries: If
we look at the world as a whole, the number of people who would exchange
their labor power for wages, especially wages in manufacturing, was
tiny. The rhythm of work was determined by many things—by the climate,
by custom, by the cycles of nature—but not by machines. People worked
because they were compelled to do so as slaves, or because they were the
feudal dependents of worldly or ecclesial authorities, or because they
produced their own subsistence with tools they owned on land to which
they had some rights. The new world of making yarn and cloth, as one of
the innumerable cogs in the empire of cotton, was utterly, fundamentally
different. Cotton manufacturing rested on the ability to persuade or
entice or force people to give up the activities that had organized
human life for centuries and join the newly emerging factory
proletariat. Though the machines themselves were stunning and
world-altering, this shift in the rhythm of work would be even more
consequential. They may not have known it, but as Ellen Hootton and
untold others streamed into the factory, they were looking at the
future, the very industrial capitalism that their labor was
building.</p>
<p>The ability to move workers into factories became key to the cotton
empire’s triumph. As a result, a chasm opened around the world between
statesmen and capitalists able to mobilize labor and those who failed.
Convincing thousands of people to give up the only way of life they had
known was no less complex than installing new machines. Both required,
as we have seen, certain legal, social, and political conditions. The
transition to the factory was at first concentrated in a few places, and
even there encountered tremendous opposition. Success required a
lopsided distribution of power that allowed statesmen and capitalists to
dominate the lives of individuals and families in ways that still eluded
elites in much of Asia and Africa. The power of the state did not just
need to be extensive, as it was in many parts of the world, but
intensive, focused, and penetrating all realms of life. As a result, in
areas of the world in which rulers could not easily subdue alternative
means of gaining access to subsistence, it was all but impossible to
transition to factory production. Ironically, factory production itself
would slowly undermine such alternative ways of organizing economic
activity.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Industrial Revolution was mostly about labor-saving
technology—as we have seen, productivity in spinning, for example,
increased by as much as a hundred times. Still, these labor-saving
machines required labor to operate them; as markets for cotton goods
expanded explosively in response to falling prices, a rapidly growing
cotton industry demanded at first thousands, then tens of thousands,
and, in some parts of the world, hundreds of thousands of workers. In
Britain, by 1861 there were 446,000 people working in the cotton
industry. It has been estimated that in 1800 about 59,700 workers
labored in the German cotton industry, a number that increased to
250,300 in 1860. The French industry drew on approximately 200,000
workers, the Swiss cotton industry in 1827 employed 62,400 workers.
While the U.S. cotton industry only counted 10,000 wage earners in 1810,
that number rose to 122,000 in 1860. Russia in 1814 employed 40,000
cotton workers, and about 150,000 in 1860. Spain in 1867 counted about
105,000 workers in its cotton industry. The global cotton industry
rested on proletarianized labor; at the same time it was one of the
greatest proletarianizing agents itself.6</p>
<p>Before the factory had become a way of life, capital owners had only
one model for how to mobilize vast amounts of labor: the plantation
economy of the Americas, built on the enslavement of millions of
Africans. Many a cotton entrepreneur was intimately familiar with this
system; Samuel Greg of Quarry Bank Mill, as we have seen, owned slave
plantations on Dominica, and he was far from alone. But such
possibilities had been forestalled in Europe because of the new
sensibilities about economic man spurred by the Enlightenment and the
resulting legal prohibitions against slavery in Europe. Bringing African
slaves to Manchester, Barcelona, or Mulhouse was out of the question;
enslaving the local population was also impossible. Moreover, slave
labor had significant economic disadvantages—it was difficult to
motivate workers under conditions of servitude, and supervision costs
were high. Slave labor, moreover, incurred costs year round, sometimes
for the life of the worker, and was not easily adjusted to the vexing
boom-and-bust cycles of industrial capitalism. The model of the
plantation, in other words, did not serve the needs of the factory.</p>
<p>Yet access to labor was crucial to manufacturers the world over.
After all, an entrepreneur’s significant investment in machines could
only be profitable with the promise of a predictable stream of labor to
operate those machines. The labor power of women and men, girls and
boys, was thus transformed into a commodity.7 Turning people into
factory workers meant turning them into wage workers as well. For most
people in Europe and elsewhere, however, wages had not been central to
their livelihood. Many who lived off the land or made artisan crafts,
not surprisingly, had little incentive to become factory workers. A
farmer grew his own sustenance; an artisan created goods he could sell
or barter. A factory worker, by contrast, possessed nothing but the
power of labor.</p>
<p>Budding capitalists and statesmen thus had to invent new ways to
mobilize labor on a massive scale—that “fresh race of beings” that a
rural magistrate observed in Lancashire in 1808. If they had envisaged
the millions of workers they eventually needed to hire, the problem
might have seemed overwhelming—and indeed, sometimes concerns about
insufficient labor supply were on their minds. From his home in the West
Midlands, a Shrewsbury mill owner complained, for example, in 1803 that
the greatest problem in starting his mill was to attract a sufficient
number of workers.8</p>
<p>These hopeful employers had help, however, especially from the
transformation of the countryside that was already decades—and in some
places, centuries—in the making. Bonds of mutual obligation between
lords and peasants had begun to break down. In Europe, landowners had
enclosed huge areas of land, making independent farming less accessible
to peasants, and the wave of proto-industrial work had already made
manufacturing, and even wage payments, a normal part of many peasants’
subsistence.9</p>
<p>Moreover, the bureaucratic, military, ideological, and social
penetration of a bounded territory by newly consolidating states aided
mill owners. Coercion had almost always been a central element in
getting people to perform labor for others, a staple for feudal lords
and colonial masters alike. Yet one of industrial capitalism’s signal
features was that coercion would now be increasingly accomplished by the
state, its bureaucrats and judges, and not by lords and masters. Many
capitalists throughout the world in need of workers feared the decline
of personal dependencies such as serfdom, slavery, and apprenticeships,
expecting idleness and even anarchy as a result. But in some areas the
state had gained sufficient strength to create conditions that secured
reliable flows of women, children, and men into factories. Throughout
much of Europe, the rights of landowners and capitalists to control
labor as personal dependents had been severely curtailed, but at the
same time the state had increasingly taken on the role of legally
compelling people to work (such as paupers, so-called vagrants, and
children). Moreover, by the enclosure of the commons the state had made
alternative possibilities of gaining a livelihood increasingly
inaccessible, in fact increasing economic pressures on those without
property. As legal historian Robert Steinfeld has put it, even “economic
coercion is an artifact of the law,” that is, of the state.10</p>
<p>The state thus created a legal framework for wage labor that made it
more fathomable to rising manufacturers. They appreciated that wage
labor retained significant nonpecuniary coercive elements—bodily
coercion—even in the centers of the new industrial capitalism. Indeed,
employers in Britain, the United States, France, Prussia, and Belgium
“required and strictly enforced labor agreements in wage labor” and
“were using forms of legal compulsion to tie workers to jobs.” The 1823
Master and Servant Act, for example, explicitly allowed “English
employers to have their workmen sent to the house of correction and held
at hard labor for up to three months for breaches of their labor
agreements.” Between 1857 and 1875, in England and Wales alone, about
ten thousand workers annually were prosecuted for “breach of contract,”
many of them sentenced to prison; cotton workers were frequently among
them. In Prussia throughout the nineteenth century, workers could be
fined and imprisoned for leaving their job: “Journeymen, helpers, and
factory workers, who leave work without permission and without legal
justification, or are guilty of shirking or gross disobedience, are to
be punished with a fine of twenty Thalers or prison up to fourteen
days,” determined the Prussian Gewerbeordnung of 1845.11</p>
<p>Despite powerful state support, recruiting workers remained a huge
challenge for budding manufacturers, testifying to the fact that workers
themselves, as long as they still had access to other means of
subsisting, tried to escape the world of the factory. When apothecary
Joan Baptista Sires, for example, opened a cotton factory in the Raval
neighborhood of Barcelona in 1770 with twenty-four looms and nineteen
printing tables (places for the application of colors on cotton
fabrics), one of his most difficult challenges was recruiting the 60 to
150 women and men he needed to keep up production. Turnover was huge, as
most workers stayed only for a few months. Sires tried to solve this
problem by replicating some elements of the artisan workshop in his
factory, providing skilled male workers with the best-paid positions,
but also allowing their wives and children to work in the factory, thus
increasing the family wage while at the same time saving on their
discounted labor. To try to enmesh workers at his factory, Sires allowed
some families to live in the buildings, replicating a pattern long
typical for artisan workshops throughout Europe.12</p>
<p>Fifty years later, in the United States, the problem of labor
recruitment had not changed much. The Dover Manufacturing Company in
Dover, New Hampshire, had to employ a total of 342 workers in the period
from August 1823 to October 1824 just to maintain an average workforce
of approximately 140.13 Workers came and left frequently, as they
desperately tried to retain access to a livelihood outside the factory.
Entering the factory for a few weeks, they would leave once they had
made enough money to hold them over to the selling of their crops or
when their labor was needed on the farm.</p>
<p>These patterns of labor recruitment were typical of regions
undergoing cotton industrialization. In every case,
proto-industrialization and proletarianization intersected. The spread
of machine-made yarn, and later cloth, undermined hand spinning and
handloom weaving on the farm, creating pressures on textile workers to
find income elsewhere. For many, the only other viable solution was the
very factory that had undermined their prior source of income. Barcelona
entrepreneur Sires, in fact, usually hired workers from the farming
areas surrounding the Catalan capital. In Saxony, earlier difficulties
in recruiting labor were overcome when cheap yarns pouring out of the
first cotton factories outcompeted hand spinners, who were then forced
to work in the expanding factories. In Switzerland, the tens of
thousands of workers that putting-out merchants kept busy in the vast
countryside as far away as the Black Forest provided a huge potential
labor reservoir, and indeed many of them eventually moved into factory
production. With the rapid expansion of the Alsatian cotton industry and
its significant labor needs, entrepreneurs looked to the mountainous
areas of the Vosges and the Black Forest for that labor. There, the
survival of families still rested on agricultural pursuits and continued
to do so even after the onset of factory production: Nearly all workers
in the spinning and weaving mills of Wesserling, for example, a small
town high above the city of Mulhouse, still owned their own land and
supplemented their income by farming as late as 1858. In the search for
spinners and weavers, capital moved ever deeper into the countryside,
allowing manufacturers to pay extremely low wages because workers could
still draw on the unpaid reproductive labor of family members—child
rearing and the growing of food among them. Here, as elsewhere, the
unfolding of capitalism depended on noncapitalist forms of production
and labor.14</p>

(illustration credit 7.2)</p>
<p>More often than not, though, workers lost access to land and, faced
with the decline of household manufacturing, moved from the countryside
into cities. Indeed, cotton industrialization led to huge migrations,
often across national borders. In 1815, among the fifteen hundred
workers of the Guebwiller firm of Ziegler, Greuter et Cie, 750 were
Alsatians, but the rest were migrants from Switzerland and Germany. U.S.
textile mills drew on such migrants as well. Thousands of workers moved
from the marginal agricultural soils of New England to the newly
emerging textile towns, and many workers crossed the Atlantic, such as
Irish women and men escaping the potato famine. The Dutch, Belgian,
Catalonian, and French cotton industries drew on migrants from the
surrounding countryside as well.15</p>
<p>These rural workers, abandoning their agricultural pursuits and
home-based manufacturing activities, flowed down the mountains and
sometimes across the seas into the textile factories of the Black
Forest, Switzerland, the Vosges, Catalonia, Saxony, and New England.
There they met a population of essentially artisanal workers. Those
workers, mostly male, took on the most skilled positions, often with
experience from older artisanal workshops, not farm fields. When Neuhaus
andandandand Huber created a weaving mill in Biel, Switzerland, in 1830
next to their spinning enterprise, they drew on newly unemployed but
highly skilled handloom weavers who had for decades prospered around the
town. Skilled workers too migrated over great distances: The cotton
cloth factory Schwarz, in the Russian town of Narva, employed in 1822
thirty-five Germans, a French dyer, and a person from Holland. Ludwig
Knoop’s Kreenholm factory employed in 1857 many British skilled workers.
Indeed, French, Mexican, American, and other manufacturers frequently
recruited highly skilled workers from abroad.16</p>
<p>The vast majority of workers, however, were not skilled and were not
recruited; rather, they were driven into factories by changing
conditions within the countryside, and especially by the decline of
goods made at home that could no longer compete with those made in
factories. Perhaps most dramatic was the moment when power looms
replaced hand weaving beginning in the 1820s. As a huge wave of misery
passed over large parts of Europe, unemployed home-based weavers were
ready to move into factories. In response to such conditions, factory
employment often became a family strategy to maintain a household’s
ability to stay on the land, either by sending one member of the family
to work at a mill full-time or by sending various members of the family
for short stints. That was the case among the workers in Lowell,
Massachusetts, where (unmarried) women’s factory wages often enabled
their families to remain on the land. Migrating into factory labor could
give marginal agricultural pursuits another lease on life.17</p>
<p>The survival of detailed pay records allows us to take a closer look
at one such early cotton mill, the Dover Manufacturing Company,
mentioned above: In the sixty-three weeks following August 9, 1823, a
total of 305 women, most of them young and unmarried, labored at one
point or another in the factory, constituting 89 percent of the
workforce. They worked on average for 25.93 weeks, or 41 percent of the
total time possible. Indeed, many women entered the factory on a
seasonal basis, working for a few months, then returning to other
pursuits. To pick just one example, in mid-October forty-three women, or
32 percent of the workforce, took the week off from mill work, to return
the following week.</p>

or B (illustration credit 7.3)</p>
<p>The rhythms of agricultural work thus persisted into the factory, and
factory work could help families stay on the land. In New Hampshire it
was common that one member of the family worked essentially full-time in
the mill, while others did so only for a short time, such as the Badge
family: While Mary worked full-time, Abigail and Sally only joined her
for short stints.</p>

<p>But even at the Dover Manufacturing Company in the 1820s, there were
already families who were fully proletarianized, whose many members
stayed for long periods at the mill. The Perkins family exemplified this
pattern; its members, including two men, worked essentially full-time,
making it extremely unlikely that they still grew any crops or raised
animals. Whatever the precise pattern, it was not the attractiveness of
factory labor itself that drew millions of people into the vortex of the
cotton mills.18</p>

<p>One way manufacturers tried to circumvent the problem of attracting
large numbers of people to work in factories was by recruiting the
weakest members of society first, those with the fewest resources to
resist. To do so, they built upon long-established relationships of
power within households, especially a long history of paternalism that
allowed the male head of household to deploy the labor of his wife and
children as he saw fit. The emergence of industrial capitalism in fact
built upon such older social hierarchies and relations of power and used
these as a tool to revolutionize society more broadly. Employers
understood that the “cheapness” of their labor rested on the persistence
of noncapitalist ways of securing subsistence—a lesson that would
eventually also inform the transition to world market production in the
cotton-growing countryside in India and elsewhere. The capitalist
revolution succeeded because it remained incomplete.</p>
<p>Consequently, children were often the first to enter factory
employment, Ellen Hootton among them. Up to half of cotton workers were
children, coerced by their parents, who in turn were coerced by the new
economic reality. Children were cheap—their wages amounted to between
one-third and one-fourth of those paid to adults—relatively obedient,
and unlikely to object to extremely repetitive and dull tasks, and if
they did, they could be more easily punished than adults. For parents
with few resources, children were often the sole source of additional
income. McConnel andandandand Kennedy, for example, the Manchester
manufacturers we encountered earlier as spinners of fine Sea Island
cotton, employed large numbers of children. In 1816, among the 568
workers on their payroll, 257 were sixteen or younger, or 45 percent of
the total.19</p>
<p>At Quarry Bank Mill, Samuel Greg’s pioneering factory near
Manchester, many pauper children labored as so-called apprentices.
Drawing on parish poorhouses, Greg recruited children as more than half
of all his workers between 1784 and 1840. He housed them in dormitories
and had them labor for him for seven years. While Greg styled himself as
a considerate and paternalist employer, he locked his child worker
Esther Price into a specially constructed cell for “disobedience,” and
made other children work overtime to penalize them for the “crime” of
having taken an apple. Again, Greg was far from unusual. Samuel Oldknow,
for example, also tapped a thriving market for “apprentices”; in 1796,
the parish of Clerkenwell advertised thirty-five boys and thirty-five
girls, inviting Oldknow to choose whatever number he would like to take.
The Edinburgh Review asserted in 1835 that factories “have been
[children’s] best and most important academies.” Turning them loose on
the street would be much worse, they asserted, as spinning mills take
“the children out of harm’s way.”20</p>

(illustration credit 7.5)</p>
<p>Amid social acceptance of child labor and urgent need, large numbers
of children worked in all aspects of cotton manufacturing. In 1833, 36
percent of all workers in Lancashire cotton factories were younger than
sixteen. In 1846 in Belgium, 27 percent of all cotton workers were under
sixteen. At a Siegerland spinning factory, of its three hundred workers
in 1800, half of them were children between eight and fourteen. And when
in 1798 the Russian Treasury allowed Michael Ossovski to build the first
mechanical cotton spinning factory, he “received” three hundred children
from a Saint Petersburg orphanage. From Saxony to Puebla to the Habsburg
Empire, the situation was similar. Catalonian manufacturers located
their factories in the foothills of the Pyrenees, home to many
struggling farmers, not least because that gave them access to child
labor. In Puebla, where most cotton workers were former peasants, debt
peons, and textile artisans, children constituted an important part of
the workforce, beginning to work at age ten, and sometimes earlier. As
late as 1837, a commission of the Société Industrielle de Mulhouse
reported that children were engaged in “forced labor” and that they
“contributed involuntarily.” To improve conditions, the commission
recommended that children age eight to ten be limited to ten hours of
work per day; twelve hours for children ten to fourteen; and thirteen
hours per day for children fourteen to sixteen years of age. Night
shifts should only be permitted for children older than fourteen. Once
enforced, they hoped such halfhearted measures would improve children’s
lives. Yet the Alsatian cotton industry continued to rely to such an
extent on child labor that its entrepreneurs vigorously opposed the
passage of a law in 1841 limiting such practices. In fact, the invention
of childhood that took place among the families of the Mulhousian
bourgeoisie, like their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and the United
States, rested on the extreme exploitation of child labor in the
factories surrounding them. Children from English poorhouses, Danish
Bornehus, Swedish Barnhus, and Russian priiut dlia sirot all ended up in
textile factories.21</p>

<p>Aside from children, women, especially the young and the unmarried,
constituted the cotton workforce. Indeed, cotton manufacturing became
the most female-dominated manufacturing industry to emerge in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In New Hampshire’s Dover mill in
the mid-1820s, as mentioned, 89 percent of all workers were women. In
Catalonia’s cotton industry, up to 70 percent of workers were female.
Women dominated the cotton textile workforces throughout Europe and the
United States, although male workers dominated in Mexico and Egypt. Such
preponderance of women workers resulted all too often in the
invisibility of the cotton industry, overshadowed by the male-dominated
coal-mining, iron-making, and railroading industries.22</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, most of these women came from the countryside.
Partly this was the result of families’ strategies to retain access to
the land by supplementing dwindling agricultural incomes through wage
work. Women in much of Europe and North America had been in charge of
spinning and weaving for centuries; that trend continued, even as the
work itself moved from home to factory, from hand to machine. In 1841,
when the young William Rathbone traveled to the United States, he was
struck by this prevalence of women workers: At a Paterson, New Jersey,
mill, which he found “the most romantically situated mill in the world,”
he found the “women employed in them are rather sickly looking but very
pretty.” A few days later, when he looked at the Lowell mills, he
observed that the “factory girls are neat and many pretty. They are
generally I believe well educated being the daughters of farmers and
sometimes even clergymen who go there for a few years without their
families to get something as a marriage position.” Rathbone, like some
of his contemporaries, had a hopelessly romanticized view of women’s
cotton work.23</p>
<p>Thanks to long-standing biases, women’s labor was much cheaper.
Historians found that “women often earned as little as 45 to 50 percent
of males’ wages under fixed wage structures.” Yet women were not just
cheaper workers, they also were less rooted in older work cultures that
often regulated the work of male artisan textile workers, work cultures
that could and did become the basis of resistance against factory
owners. Women’s work patterns, along with those of their children, were
more easily molded to fit the ceaseless rhythm of machine
production.24</p>
<p>The availability of women was crucial to the early cotton
manufacturers. And it was also what distinguished large parts of Europe
(and eventually also Japan) from many other areas of the world. Not that
women elsewhere did not work in textile production—they did—but in
Europe and North America, unlike in Africa and Asia, women could
eventually move out of households and into factories, a critical
condition for textile industrialization. In China, for example, the
situation was quite different. As historian Kenneth Pomeranz notes, “The
Chinese family system did not allow much migration by single women,
either to cities or to peripheries, until twentieth-century factories
with tightly supervised dormitories made this seem possible within the
bounds of respectability.” Sociologist Jack Goldstone even argues that
the different roles of women explain why Europe industrialized and China
did not. In Europe and the United States, women married relatively later
and were therefore able to join the factory proletariat before
marriage.25</p>
<p>Yet favorable legacies of patriarchy and the transformation of the
countryside had almost always to be supplemented with more overt forms
of coercion. Though the coercion employed by the “lords of the loom” was
quite different from that of the “lords of the lash,” using force to
mobilize labor, to discipline it within factories, and to keep workers
from leaving once they had entered factory employment was nearly
universal. With their investments in factories at stake, manufacturers
embraced coercion and even physical violence, sometimes privately, but
more and more often also sanctioned by the state. Orphaned children, as
we have seen, frequently had no choice but to work under oppressive
conditions in cotton mills. Belgian entrepreneur Lieven Bauwens used
“the inmates of the prison of which he was warden” as weavers. In
Russia, efforts to staff textile factories with wage workers failed at
first, and instead entrepreneurs resorted to coercing people to work,
drawing upon “prostitutes, criminals, beggars, and others—some of whom
were sentenced to work for life in industry.” In the United States,
prisoners in Maryland, Louisiana, and Rhode Island spent their days
weaving cotton. Even cotton workers who agreed to a wage labor contract
often were tied to factories through “some manner of bondage.” The
management in Knoop’s huge Krenholm factory was described by a local
Estonian paper as taking “no more care of the people than does a
slave-owner of his Negro slaves.” The factory not only had its own
police force, but also regularly brutalized workers by corporal
punishment. In Puebla, Mexico, workers were just as much subject to
severe supervision: If they lived in factory compounds, they were
sometimes not allowed to have friends or relatives visit, and sometimes
even the reading of newspapers was outlawed. And in the Habsburg Empire,
cotton mills were akin to military barracks; workers were locked into
factories and only allowed to leave on Sundays.26</p>
<p>In areas of the world in which slavery prevailed, bodily coercion
played an even more important role. In the Americas in particular, the
world’s center of plantation slavery, significant coerced labor went
into cotton manufacturing. In Brazil, native peoples and slaves were
forced to work in textile factories. In the southern United States as
well, slaves worked in cotton textile production—a system that one
historian has aptly termed “coerced proto-industrialization.” Thus in
the slave zones of the world, slavery fueled industrial production as
well.27</p>
<p>Compared to cotton growing, the global cotton manufacturing industry
as a whole, however, used physical coercion to a much lesser extent in
the mobilization of labor. Even in Russia, where before the 1861
emancipation serfs were at times forced to work in textile factories,
such coerced workers never constituted more than 3.3 percent of the
cotton workforce. New yet sophisticated methods of labor control had
emerged instead that did not rest on the enslavement of workers.</p>
<p>Yet lessons learned on large slave plantations still inspired
industrialists. Cotton manufacturer Samuel Oldknow, for example, in the
mid-1790s tried to gain greater authority over his workers. Unlike the
putting-out system that Oldknow knew so well, the factory was
unchartered territory to him, and thus he struggled mightily to control
his workers. In a first step, he created an attendance book to take
systematic note of his workers’ presence in the factory. He divided this
small book by the rooms in his mill and listed each of the workers in
each of the rooms. He divided the day into four quarters and listed
during which quarters workers were actually present. In March 1796, for
example, the book lists “Mary Lewis 1,2,3,4; Thomas Lewis 1,2,3,4; Peggy
Woodale 1; Martha Woodale 1; Samuel Ardern 3,4,” and so on. In our
perpetually monitored world, such recordkeeping seems quaint, but just
like the switch from seasonal work to machine work, so too this notion
of keeping track of time was new, and while it was most fully elaborated
on slave plantations, it slowly migrated into the world of the factory
as well. Mobilizing huge numbers of workers by paying them wages and
then supervising their work and assuring that they applied their skills
and energy was a work in progress, and new dilemmas continually emerged.
Outside the factory—in workers’ homes and neighborhoods—employers’
authority was even more distant. Instilling discipline proved difficult,
with tracking attendance in account books often not sufficient, and so
employers frequently also resorted to beating, fining, and firing
workers. The rhythm of work and its tight supervision reminded many
contemporary observers of the only other large work setting they
knew—the slave plantation—even though that made them miss the truly
revolutionary nature of what was unfolding in front of their eyes.28</p>
<p>Discipline was difficult to enforce and workers difficult to recruit
not least because working conditions were often appalling—so much so
that slave owners the world over compared the conditions of slave labor
in favorable terms to those of industrial workers. In the German cotton
industry, for example fourteen- to sixteen-hour workdays, six days a
week, were the rule. In Puebla in 1841, hours per day averaged 14.8,
including a one-hour lunch break. In France during the Second Empire,
workdays averaged twelve hours, though employers could make their
workers work as long as they chose to, and until 1873, working hours in
textile mills in Barcelona were just as long. Production everywhere was
dangerous and the machines deafeningly noisy.29</p>
<p>Such conditions had a dramatic impact on workers’ health: When the
Saxon government sought to recruit soldiers in the 1850s, only 16
percent of spinners and 18 percent of weavers were deemed healthy enough
to serve. For many decades, the standard of living of these new cotton
factory workers symbolized to contemporaries everything that was wrong
with industrialization. “I regret to have to add that the distress of
the Laboring poor but most particularly the weaver is great beyond
almost description,” reported J. Norris to the British secretary of
state Robert Peel in 1826. Indeed, a recent analysis of the life
expectancy and heights of workers determined that “no increase in food
consumption, no increase in longevity or nutritional status, and no
improvement in housing” resulted from the Industrial Revolution. The
author concluded that “the infant mortality results presented here for
the sample parishes in the heartland of the Industrial Revolution
provide support for the view that clear evidence of significant
improvement in the daily lives of English workers and their families is
lacking before the middle of the century” and might have actually had to
wait until the 1870s. “I calculate that consumption per capita, adjusted
for changes in leisure, remained essentially unchanged between 1760 and
1830.” As American labor activist Seth Luther reported in 1833, “The
consequence of this excess of toil is, that the growth of the body is
checked, and the limbs become weak, and sometimes horribly
distorted.”30</p>
<p>Considering such conditions, it is not surprising that farmers and
artisans often resisted being turned into factory workers. With living
standards and live expectancy falling, it was entirely rational to fear
the factory. Resistance was both individual and collective, and made
proletarianization an even more drawn out, often violent process. During
the French revolutionary upheavals of the 1780s and 1790s, workers
destroyed machines that modernized the cotton manufacturing process, and
threatened factory owners associated with the modernization of
production. In 1789, for example, hundreds of workers attacked cotton
factories in Normandy, the center of the French cotton industry,
destroying seven hundred spinning jennies and other machinery. Troops
and militias, there and elsewhere, fought such upheavals, but with mixed
success. This resistance continued in the 1820s, when French workers
opposed the introduction of power looms. So effective was this wave of
resistance, and so relatively limited the inexperienced state’s ability
and willingness to protect its modernizing entrepreneurs, that some
capitalists concluded that the path of least resistance was to limit the
employment of new machines and instead focus on the production, however
labor-intensive, of high-quality goods. The fear of popular uprising
became a guiding star in the universe of French entrepreneurs.31</p>
<p>Such resistance also characterized the industrialization process in
England. Already in the 1740s there had been riots against Kay’s flying
shuttle, in 1753 there were attacks on “cotton reel” machines; in
1768–69 workers in Lancashire rioted against the introduction of the
spinning jenny, and in 1779 Lancashire workers smashed various kinds of
machinery. But machine breaking only became truly prevalent in the
1810s, a moment when the state was able and willing to use massive force
to repress it. In 1811 and 1812, “steam looms [were] attacked in
Stockport and elsewhere,” with another wave of machine attacks in
1826.32</p>
<p>Workers in other parts of the world also rebelled. In Puebla,
weavers’ guilds were “extremely hostile” to machine production of cotton
yarn. Factory owners adamant about introducing new machines hid
innovators and their machines in a “secret place” to be safe from guild
hostility. That fear was also prevalent in Veracruz. In Switzerland,
weavers revolted in the 1820s, demanding that power looms be outlawed,
burning down a factory in Oberuster in 1832. In the Dutch city of
Tilburg in 1827, workers objecting to the introduction of steam engines
smashed the windows of factory owner Pieter van Dooren.33</p>
<p>The expansion of the world’s mechanized cotton industry thus not only
rested on the deployment of new technologies and access to capital and
markets, but also on the ability of capitalists to turn thousands and
eventually millions of people into proletarians—and, importantly, to
break resistance to the imposition of a radically new way of living and
working. As a contemporary observed in England in 1795, “The several
modes of accelerating labour have been always stoutly resisted by the
labouring class, when the different machinery was first introduced.”34
This was, as one historian has remarked in regard to the Black Forest’s
Wiesental, a process of “inner colonializations”—the colonialization and
domination by capital of ever more territories and social relations. Yet
in the face of weakened feudal elites, such a transition was
possible—and consolidating states played a key role enabling it.</p>
<p>Indeed, the state became exceedingly important in the repression of
working-class collective action, demonstrating once more how decisive
state capacity was to industrial capitalism. States passed laws
outlawing everything from trade unions, to strikes, to public
assemblies, to labor-oriented political parties. States criminalized
workers’ efforts to improve their working conditions. When machine
breaking spread throughout the empire of cotton, as we have seen, states
responded. As Luddites in Britain (and also in France) destroyed
hundreds of spinning machines in 1811–12, Parliament passed a law in
February 1812 that made machine breaking a capital crime. Thirty
Luddites were hanged in 1812–13, and nineteen more in 1830. Others were
exiled to Australia or imprisoned. And the British state cracked down on
workers’ collective action in other ways as well: Pitt’s Two Acts of
1795 suspended habeas corpus and outlawed gatherings of over fifty
people without prior authorization. The Combination Acts of 1799 and
1800 outlawed trade unions—leading, for example, to John Doherty’s
sentencing to ten years of hard labor in 1818, his crime being
membership in the (illegal) Manchester Cotton-Spinners’ Society. The
British state, not quite trusting the mechanism it had devised to assure
social peace, also prepared for battle with workers—between 1792 and
1815 alone, 155 military barracks were built in industrial areas. As one
historian concludes, “The magnitude of government repression
astonishes.” When workers rebelled, mill owners often came to depend on
the state to suppress such upheaval, making mill owners’ ability to
accumulate capital increasingly reliant on the power of nationalizing
states—states whose own power rested more and more on successful
industrialization.35</p>
<p>The struggle to transform workers into proletarians had made
industrialists even more dependent on the state, a remarkable testimony
to the limits of their power. The territorialization of capital, its
growing attachment to and dependence on nation-states, however, also
enabled workers to organize collectively to improve their working
conditions and wages; eventually it would turn capitalists’ dependence
on the state into labor’s greatest strength. Trade unions and
working-class political movements, despite multipronged efforts to
repress them, created new pressures on capital across the nineteenth
century, pressures that would many decades later radically reshape the
world’s cotton industry.</p>
<p>Workers not only rebelled against machine production, as we have
seen, but also tried to improve their living and working conditions
within a system of mechanized production. These efforts were at first
feeble, but they eventually gained strength and indeed won higher wages,
shorter hours, and better working conditions. In the first half of the
nineteenth century, successes were still few and far between, but the
struggle abounded. Some working-class associations had already emerged
before 1800 among British weavers. In 1792, Stockport and Manchester
mule spinners formed unions. In 1807, handloom weavers collected 130,000
signatures to advocate for what they termed a “legal wage.” In 1826,
riots of cotton workers spread from Manchester, as weavers assembled and
threatened to damage power loom factories. A Fred Foster from Manchester
reported “with much pleasure” to Secretary of State Robert Peel on April
28, 1826, that once workers assembled in the streets, “the riot act was
proclaimed andandandand the principal streets were cleared by
detachments of troops.” In 1844, weavers famously rebelled in Silesia.
In New England, women cotton mill workers walked off their job in
Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1824, making it the first strike by factory
workers in the United States. English mule spinners also brought
collective action strategies with them to the United States, especially
to New England, and in 1858 the Mule Spinners’ Union of Fall River was
born. Spanish cotton workers forged a labor movement during the 1840s
and 1850s, and the year 1854 saw the first general strike among
spinners. In France, textile workers participated in 35 percent of all
strikes recorded between 1830 and 1847. Women sometimes took the lead in
such collective action: In Lowell, Massachusetts, for example, women
workers organized in 1844 the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association,
fighting for better working conditions and a shorter workday. Already by
midcentury, cotton manufacturers responded to the militancy of their
workers by moving their capital elsewhere, with Catalonian entrepreneurs
perhaps the vanguard when they increasingly relocated production to
isolated factory villages along the Llobregat and the Ter Rivers outside
Barcelona to escape their troublesome workers. As in the case of cotton
growing, workers’ collective action and the spatial arrangements of the
world’s cotton industry intersected.36</p>
<p>Yet these incipient efforts at unionization, strikes, and other forms
of collective action directed toward improving wages and the working
conditions of cotton workers demonstrate that once the control and
mobilization of labor were “nationalized” within powerful states, and
indeed became matters of state, workers also gained new opportunities to
improve their situation by appealing to the state itself and mobilizing
within national political spaces. The nonpecuniary penalties for
violation of employment contracts, for example, became increasingly
untenable as a result of workers’ collective action. When in England
large segments of the working class gained the vote in 1867, trade
unions pressured the state to limit allowable remedies for workers’
breach of contract, and succeeded in 1875. In Germany it took until the
revolution of 1918 to end criminal penalties for breach of contract.37
Indeed, “employment at will”—allowing workers to leave their jobs
whenever they decide to do so—was the result of decades of struggle by
workers, not a “natural” outgrowth of the emergence of industrial
capitalism and even less so the precondition for its emergence. From the
factory to the plantation, the expansion of freedom rested on the
organization and collective action of workers. The labor market as
idealized in modern-day economics textbooks as often as not came about
as a result of strikes, unions, and riots.</p>
<p>The empire of cotton from its 1780s beginnings to 1861 in effect
rested on two very different forms of labor, and two very different
forms of the organization of production. On the western shores of the
Atlantic were the vibrant, expanding, and enormously profitable slave
plantations, the latest outgrowth of the dynamic war capitalism that
Europeans had been building since the sixteenth century. In Europe
itself, but also in New England and a few other areas of the world, a
much more novel and more dynamic organization of production had emerged:
industrial capitalism, with its spectacularly productive spinning and
weaving mills based on wage labor. Connected by the mediation of a group
of merchants, these two systems grew side by side, the one feeding the
power of the other. Capital, personified by merchants, facilitated the
rapid expansion of both slave cotton plantations and wage labor cotton
factories, connecting the seemingly opposing legacies of the one to the
other—until the day one of them collapsed. Once that happened, once
slavery within the empire of cotton expired like some distant supernova,
its crucial contribution to the construction of industrial capitalism
could be written out of our collective memory.</p>
