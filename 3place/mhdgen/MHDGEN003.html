of a Global Commodity</h4>
<p>Aztec woman spinning cotton (illustration credit 1.1)</p>
<p>Half a millennium ago, in a dozen small villages along the Pacific
coast of what is today called Mexico, people spent their days growing
maize, beans, squash, and chiles. There, between the Río Santiago to the
north and the Río Balsas to the south, they fished, gathered oysters and
clams, and collected honey and beeswax. Alongside this subsistence
agriculture and the modest crafts they produced by hand—small painted
ceramic vessels decorated with geometric motifs were their most renowned
creation—these men and women also grew a plant that sprouted small
tufted white bolls. The plant was inedible. It was also the most
valuable thing they grew. They called it ichcatl: cotton.</p>
<p>The cotton plant thrived among the maize, and each fall, after they
harvested their food crops, the villagers plucked the soft wads of fiber
from the pyramidally shaped, waist-high plants, gathering the numerous
bolls in baskets or sacks, then carrying them to their mud-and-wattle
huts. There they painstakingly removed the many seeds by hand, then beat
the cotton on a palm mat to make it smooth, before combing out the
fibers into strands several inches long. Using a thin wooden spindle
fitted with a ceramic disk and a spinning bowl to support the spindle as
it twirled, they twisted the strands together into fine white thread.
Then they created cloth on a backstrap loom, a simple tool consisting of
two sticks attached by the warp threads; one stick was hung from a tree,
the other on the weaver herself, who stretched the warp with the weight
of her own body and then wove the contrasting thread (the weft) in and
out between the warps in an unending dance. The result was a cloth as
strong as it was supple. They dyed the cloth with indigo and cochineal,
creating a rich variety of blue-blacks and crimsons. Some of the cloth
they wore themselves, sewn into shirts, skirts, and trousers. The rest
they sent to Teotihuacán as part of an annual tribute owed to their
distant Aztec rulers. In 1518 alone, the people of these twelve coastal
villages provided the emperor Moctezuma II with eight hundred bales of
raw cotton (each weighing 115 pounds), thirty-two hundred colored cotton
cloths, and forty-eight hundred large white cloths, the product of
thousands of hours of backbreaking and highly skilled labor.1</p>
<p>For hundreds of years both before and after, similar scenes unfolded
across vast stretches of the world’s inhabited land. From Gujarat to
Sulawesi, along the banks of the Upper Volta to the Rio Grande, from the
valleys of Nubia to the plains of Yucatán, people on three continents
had grown cotton in their fields, and then manufactured cotton textiles
in the houses next door, just as their ancestors had done for
generations prior. The plant is stubborn, seemingly able to thrive with
little help from farmers, given the right natural conditions. It grows
in a wide range of environments thanks to its “morphological
plasticity,” that is, in the words of plant scientists, its ability to
“adapt to diverse growing conditions by shortening, lengthening, or even
interrupting its effective bloom period.”2</p>
<p>The many peoples who grew cotton remained for thousands of years
unaware that their efforts were being replicated by other peoples around
the globe, all of whom lived in a geographic band roughly from 32–35
degrees south to 37 degrees north. These areas offered a climate
suitable for the growing of cotton. As a subtropical plant, it needs
temperatures not dipping below 50 degrees Fahrenheit during its growth
period and usually remaining above 60 degrees. Cotton, we now know,
thrives in areas in which no frost occurs for around 200 days, and in
which it rains from twenty to twenty-five inches a year, concentrated in
the middle of the growing period, a common climate zone that explains
its abundance across multiple continents. Seeds are put in trenches
about three feet apart and then covered with soil. It takes from 160 to
200 days for the cotton to mature.3</p>
<p>By themselves or through encounters with other peoples, each of these
cotton cultivators had discovered that the fluffy white fiber that
quelled out of the cotton boll was superbly suited to the production of
thread. This thread in turn could be woven into a cloth that was easy to
wash, pleasant against the skin, and effective as protection from the
sun’s burning rays—and to some degree from the cold. As early as a
thousand years ago, the production of cotton textiles in Asia, Africa,
and the Americas was the world’s largest manufacturing industry;
sophisticated trade networks, mostly local but a few regional, connected
growers, spinners, weavers, and consumers.</p>
<p>The history of clothing is difficult to reconstruct, because most
cloth has not survived the ravages of time. We know that ever since Homo
sapiens moved from the African savanna into colder climes, about one
hundred thousand years ago, they had to protect themselves from the
elements. The spotty archaeological record that we have tells us that
humans first used furs and skins to clothe themselves. There is evidence
that they spun and wove flax as early as thirty thousand years ago. Such
cloth production expanded significantly about twelve thousand years ago,
once humans settled down and began to engage in agriculture and animal
husbandry. Then men and women began to experiment more widely with
different fibers to spin and to weave cloth for protection against the
cold and the sun.4</p>
<p>The methods for transforming plants into cloth were invented
independently in various parts of the world. In Europe, people began to
weave various grasses and also linen during the Neolithic Era, starting
about twelve thousand years ago. About eight thousand years later,
during the Bronze Age, they also began to harvest wool from animals. In
the Middle East and North Africa, for seven millennia before the Common
Era, societies spun and wove various kinds of wool and flax as well.
Over the same millennia, Chinese peasants and artisans manufactured
clothing from ramie and silk. As societies became more stratified, cloth
emerged as an important marker of social rank.5</p>
<p>In this world of linen, wool, ramie, and silk, cotton’s importance
gradually grew. About five thousand years ago, on the Indian
subcontinent, people, as far as we know, first discovered the
possibility of making thread out of cotton fibers. Almost
simultaneously, people living on the coast of what today is Peru,
ignorant of developments in South Asia, followed suit. A few thousand
years later, societies in eastern Africa developed techniques for the
spinning and weaving of cotton as well. In each of these regions cotton
quickly became the dominant fiber for the spinning of thread, its
properties for most uses clearly superior to those of flax and ramie and
other fibers. For these first millennia of the plant’s cultivation, the
production of cotton goods rarely expanded beyond cotton’s natural
growing zone, but all who encountered it saw it as a remarkable material
for the production of clothing: soft, durable, and light, easy to dye
and easy to clean.</p>
<p>Evidence of cotton’s essential role in early societies can be found
in the foundational myths and sacred texts of many peoples. In Hindu
scripture, cotton appears frequently and prominently. Vishnu, Hindus
believe, wove “the rays of the sun into a garment for himself.” People
across West Africa attributed their spinning skills to Ananse, a spider
deity. In North America, a Hopi spider goddess was believed to spin and
weave cotton. The Navajo believed that Begochiddy, one of the four sons
of Ray of Sunlight and Daylight, had created and planted cotton after
making the mountains and insects. According to a Navajo belief, “When a
baby girl is born to your tribe you shall go and find a spider web…and
rub it on the baby’s hand and arm. Thus, when she grows up she will
weave, and her fingers and arms will not tire from the weaving.” In
China, according to a 1637 text from the late Ming dynasty, clothing,
including cottons, distinguished humans from beasts, and among humans it
“distinguished between the rulers and the ruled.” Moreover, the idea of
fate as either spun or woven was central to many diverse cultures,
including those, not surprisingly, in which cotton played a dominant
role.6</p>
<p>Modern plant scientists have looked beyond cotton as a gift of the
gods, but are no less impressed. Biologists think cotton plants have
grown on earth for 10 to 20 million years. Four genetically different
species of cotton have developed since—the Mesoamerican G. hirsutum, the
South American G. barbadense, the African G. herbaceum, and the Asian G.
arboretum. These four species, in turn, have sprouted hundreds of
further variations, of which only a few would come to dominate
commercial cotton production. Today, more than 90 percent of the world’s
cotton crop is G. hirsutum cultivars, also known as American upland.
Human domestication has changed the plant even further. Over a
five-thousand-year period, according to one expert, our forebears
transformed it “from undisciplined perennial shrubs and small trees with
small impermeable seeds sparsely covered by coarse, poorly
differentiated seed hairs, to short, compact, annualized plants with
copious amounts of long, white lint borne on large seeds that germinate
readily.” Cotton growers carefully experimented with the plant,
gradually forging it into something that supported their growing need
for cloth. They adapted the plant to particular environmental niches,
transported it over long distances, spread its reach, and increased its
diversity. As with so many other pieces of the natural world, human
cultivation radically accelerated and altered the biological history of
cotton—a capacity that would quicken during the nineteenth century and
become of great importance to the empire of cotton.7</p>
<p>Farmers in the Indus valley were the first to spin and weave cotton.
In 1929, archaeologists recovered fragments of cotton textiles at
Mohenjo-Daro, in what is now Pakistan, dating to between 3250 and 2750
BCE. Cottonseeds found at nearby Mehrgarh have been dated to 5000 BCE.
Literary references further point to the ancient nature of the
subcontinent’s cotton industry. The Vedic scriptures, composed between
1500 and 1200 BCE, allude to cotton spinning and weaving. The very first
reports by foreign travelers to South Asia similarly mention cotton: The
ancient Greek historian Herodotus (484–425 BCE) was familiar with
India’s fine cotton clothing, observing in 445 BCE that in the
subcontinent “wild trees bear fleeces for their fruit surpassing those
of the sheep in beauty and excellence, and the natives clothe themselves
in cloths made therefrom.”8</p>
<p>From the earliest time until well into the nineteenth century—that
is, for several millennia—the people of the Indian subcontinent were the
world’s leading cotton manufacturers. Peasants in what are today India,
Pakistan, and Bangladesh cultivated small quantities of cotton alongside
their food crops. They spun and wove cotton for their own use and for
sale in local and regional markets. Most regions within South Asia
produced all the textiles they consumed well into the nineteenth
century. They harvested the crop by hand, employed a roller gin to
remove the seeds, removed dirt and knots with the help of a bow (a
wooden tool with string attached that vibrates if struck with a piece of
wood), spun the fiber on a distaff (a tool holding the unspun cotton)
and a spindle into thread, and wove this thread into fabric using looms
hung between trees.9</p>
<p>The quality of the top tier of Indian cotton fabrics was legendary:
In the thirteenth century, the European traveler Marco Polo elaborated
on Herotodus’s observations of nearly nine hundred years earlier, noting
on the coast of Coromandel “the finest and most beautiful cottons that
are to be found in any part of the world.” Six hundred years later,
Edward Baines, a newspaper proprietor and cotton expert from Leeds,
reported the best Indian cloth was of “almost incredible perfection….
Some of their muslins might be thought the work of fairies, or of
insects, rather than of men.” They were, in effect, “webs of woven
wind.”10</p>
<p>The subcontinent, however, was far from alone. Cotton was plentiful
and cotton cloth ubiquitous in the Americas, long before Europeans
arrived in the New World. In a four-thousand-mile arc through
Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to South America, cotton was the most
important manufacturing industry. Perhaps the oldest center of cotton
manufacture was located in present-day Peru. There, archaeologists have
excavated cotton fishing nets dated to 2400 BCE and textile fragments
from 1600–1500 BCE. When Francisco Pizarro attacked the Inca Empire in
1532, he marveled at the quality and quantity of cotton fabrics he saw.
At the Incan city of Cajamarca, the conquistadores found stores filled
with huge quantities of cotton textiles “far superior to any they had
seen, for fineness of texture, and the skill with which the various
colors were blended.”11</p>
<p>Several thousand miles to the north and a decade earlier, Europeans
were just as surprised when they penetrated the Aztec Empire and
encountered extraordinary cottons. In addition to gold and other
treasure, Hernán Cortés sent to Charles V cotton cloth brilliantly dyed
with indigo and cochineal. The Mesoamerican cotton industry, like its
South American counterpart, had a long history. Cotton was planted
throughout what is today central Mexico as early as 3400 BCE, and the
earliest thread found in archaeological excavations has been dated to
between 1200 and 1500 BCE. Cotton use by the Mayas has been documented
as early as 632 BCE, and in the lowlands of modern-day Veracruz, a
cotton industry probably emerged between 100 BCE and 300 CE. As the
wearing of cotton spread from elites to commoners, production increased,
especially with the rise of the Aztecs’ military and economic empire
after 1350. And as more people wore cotton, its processing became ever
more important. Techniques in weaving and dying all became more and more
refined, not least to display social difference through distinctive
clothing.12</p>
<p>Indigenous production continued after the conquest of Central America
by Spanish colonists in the sixteenth century. One
late-seventeenth-century colonial Spanish administrator, Don Juan de
Villagutierre Soto-Mayor, praised the Indian women of the former realm
of the Maya who “spin cotton and weave their cloths with energy and
ability, giving them perfect colors.” In addition to clothing, cotton
was used for religious offerings, as gifts, a medium of exchange, for
decorative hangings, for wrapping mummies, as armor, and even for
medicinal uses. An estimated 116 million pounds of cotton were produced
annually in pre-Columbian Mexico, equaling the cotton crop of the United
States in 1816. As the rulers of Teotihuacán expanded the reach of their
power, they drew tribute and trade from cotton-growing and
-manufacturing regions. Places within the Aztec Empire that were
particularly prominent growers of cotton had Nahuatl names that meant
“on the cotton temple,” “in the river of cotton,” and “on the hill of
cotton.”13</p>
<p>Mexico and Peru were the centers of the pre-Columbian cotton
industry, but the production of cotton textiles also spread to other
parts of the continent. In what is today Brazil, cotton fibers gathered
from wild plants were used to manufacture cloth. In what later became
the southwestern United States, Native Americans became avid cotton
producers, especially the Navajos and Hopi, perhaps as early as 300 BCE.
Knowledge about cotton had traveled up the west coast of Mexico from
Central America. When Spanish settlers came into contact with Indians
north of the Rio Grande, they noticed that “the Indians spin cotton and
weave cloth” and that they “wear Campeche-type cotton blankets for they
have large cotton fields.” For some Native Americans, cotton also had
important religious uses: The Hopi utilized it to symbolize clouds in
ceremonies in which they prayed for rain, and placed it over the faces
of the dead “with the idea of making the spiritual body light, like a
cloud.” In the Caribbean, as well, cotton growing was widespread.
Indeed, one of the reasons why Christopher Columbus believed that he had
reached India was that he encountered great quantities of cotton in the
Caribbean; he recounted islands “full of…cotton.”14</p>
<p>Cotton growing and manufacturing also has a long history in Africa.
It was probably first cultivated by Nubians in what today is eastern
Sudan. Some claim that the fiber was cultivated, spun, and woven there
as early as 5000 BCE, though archaeological finds at Meroë, a former
city on the east bank of the Nile, confirm the presence of cotton
textiles only for the years between 500 BCE and 300 CE. From Sudan,
cotton spread north to Egypt. While cotton textiles played no
significant role in ancient Egyptian civilizations, we know that
cottonseed was used as animal fodder as early as 2600–2400 BCE, and
depictions on the Karnak Temple in Luxor show cotton bushes. Yet cotton
cultivation and the manufacturing of cotton textiles only took off in
Egypt between 332 BCE and 395 CE. In 70 CE, Pliny the Elder observed
that “the upper part of Egypt, in the vicinity of Arabia, produces a
shrub, known by some as gossypium. The shrub is small, and bears a fruit
similar in appearance to a nut with a beard, and containing in the
inside a silky substance, the down of which is spun into threads. There
is no tissue known that is superior to those made from this thread,
either for whiteness, softness, or dressing…” After 800 CE, the spread
of cotton, and its attendant production, accelerated further on the
wings of Islam.15</p>
<p>Knowledge about how to grow and process cotton then traveled to
western Africa. How exactly cotton came there is still unclear, but it
is possible that itinerant weavers and merchants brought it from East
Africa sometime around the beginning of the Common Era. With the arrival
of Islam in the eighth century CE, the cotton industry expanded
significantly, as Islamic teachers taught girls to spin and boys to
weave, while advocating a previously unimagined modesty of dress to
peoples whose environmental conditions demanded little clothing.
Excavations have found cotton cloth dated to the tenth century. Literary
sources and archaeological finds testify to cotton spinning and weaving
in West Africa in the late eleventh century, by which time it had spread
as far south as present-day Togo. By the early fifteenth century, Leo
Africanus reported on the “great abundance” of cotton in the “kingdome
of Melli” and the wealth of cotton merchants in the “kingdome of
Tombuto,” meaning the great West African empires of Mali and
Timbuktu.16</p>
<p>The domestication, spinning, and weaving of cotton, to the best of
our knowledge, evolved independently in these three regions of the
world.17 From South Asia, Central America, and eastern Africa, however,
knowledge spread rapidly along existing trade and migration routes—from
Mesoamerica to the north, for example, and from East Africa to the west.
Central to these movements of the cotton industry was India. From there,
cotton growing and manufacturing skills moved west, east, and south,
placing Asia at the center of the global cotton industry, where it would
remain until well into the nineteenth century, and return again in the
late twentieth century. India’s location, and skill with cotton, was
most consequential to the plant’s prominent role in our world, since a
group of Europeans, clothed no doubt in fur, wool, and linen, was most
impressed when they stumbled more than two thousand years ago upon these
wondrous new fabrics arriving from a mythical “East.”</p>
<p>But prior to its discovery by Europeans, cotton was busy altering the
lives of others. Cotton moved westward, from India via Turkestan into
the Middle East and later into the Mediterranean. Even before the Common
Era, we have evidence of cotton being grown in Persia, Mesopotamia, and
Palestine. Cotton clothing dated to around 1100 BCE was found in Nineveh
(in present-day Iraq), and an Assyrian cylinder dated to the seventh
century BCE speaks of a tree that bears wool. A few hundred years later,
during the first centuries of the Common Era, Anatolian peasants had
taken up cotton cultivation. Just as in Africa, the spread of Islam
played a major role in transmitting the skills to grow, spin, and weave
cotton across the Middle East, as religious demands for modesty made
cotton an “ordinary article of clothing.” Ninth- and tenth-century Iran
saw a “cotton boom” to supply urban markets, especially at Baghdad. In
the thirteenth century, Marco Polo encountered cotton and cotton cloth
everywhere from Armenia to Persia, and the “abundance” of cotton across
Asia became a major motif of his reporting.18</p>
<p>Just as cotton cultivation moved farther west, the knowledge of
cotton also spread from India east through Asia, and especially into
China. While China eventually became one of the most significant
producers of cotton and cotton textiles worldwide, and is the center of
the world’s cotton industry today, the plant is not indigenous there.
Indeed, the Chinese word for cotton and cotton fiber is borrowed from
Sanskrit and other Indian languages.19 By 200 BCE, cotton was known in
China, but for the next millennium it did not spread much beyond the
southwestern border regions where it had originally been introduced.</p>
<p>Cotton became a major presence in the Chinese countryside during the
Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). During those years, it effectively replaced
ramie, which, with silk, had traditionally served the Chinese as a fiber
for making cloth. By 1433, Chinese subjects could pay taxes in cotton,
which enabled the state to clothe its soldiers and officials in the
fiber. As we will see, the connection between the crop and taxation was
one of many instances of political authorities taking an interest in the
cotton industry. During the expansionary Ming dynasty (1368–1644),
cotton production spread throughout China’s new conquests. At the end of
the Ming, the Chinese produced an estimated 20 million cotton cloth
bales annually. A geographical division of labor had emerged in which
northern farmers shipped raw cotton south to the lower Yangtze, where
farmers used it, along with their own homegrown cotton, to manufacture
textiles, some of which they sold back to the north. So vibrant was this
interregional trade that cotton cloth accounted for one-fourth of the
empire’s commerce. By the seventeenth century, nearly all Chinese men,
women, and children wore cotton clothing. Not surprisingly, when China’s
population doubled over the course of the eighteenth century, to 400
million people, its cotton industry became the second largest in the
world after India’s, growing an estimated 1.5 billion pounds of cotton
in 1750, roughly equal to U.S. production as its planters ramped up
production in the decade prior to the Civil War.20</p>
<p>Worlds of Cotton: The First 5,000 Years</p>
<p>Indian cotton technology also spread into Southeast Asia. As
production skills advanced, cotton cloth emerged as the region’s most
valuable manufactured product after foodstuffs. Buddhist monks brought
it to Java sometime between the third and fifth centuries CE. Much
later, between 1525 and 1550, cotton cultivation expanded into Japan. By
the seventeenth century it had become an important commercial crop
there, as small farmers grew cotton to earn extra income for tax
payments, often in rotation with rice.21 With cotton’s arrival in Japan,
the original Indian cotton culture had now spread over most of Asia.</p>
<p>Fashioned by African, American, and Asian peasants, spinners,
weavers, and merchants over at least five millennia, this cotton world
was vibrant and expanding. Despite its diversity across three
continents, the centers of this huge manufacturing industry had many
things in common. Most important, cotton growing and manufacturing
almost always remained small-scale and focused on households. While some
growers sold their raw cotton into markets, including long-distance
markets, and many rulers forced cultivators to part with some of their
crop as tribute, no growers depended on their cotton crops alone;
instead they diversified their economic opportunities, hoping to lessen
risk to the best of their ability. In a large swath of Africa, and parts
of South Asia and Central America, such patterns persisted until well
into the twentieth century.</p>
<p>For millennia, then, households planted cotton in a delicate
equilibrium with other crops. Families grew cotton alongside their food
crops, balancing their own and their community’s need for food and fiber
with their rulers’ demands for tribute. In Veracruz, for example, double
cropping of food grains and cotton was common, providing subsistence
both for those who grew cotton and those who spun and wove. In the
Yucatán, Mayan peasants grew cotton in fields that also produced maize
and beans. In West Africa, cotton was “interplanted with food crops,”
such as sorghum, in present-day Ivory Coast, or with yams, as in the
area that is now Togo. In Gujarat, “the [cotton] shrubs are planted
between the rows of rice.” In the cotton-growing areas of Central Asia,
peasants grew the fiber alongside not only rice, but also wheat and
millet, and in Korea alongside beans. No significant cotton monoculture
emerged before the eighteenth century, and yet when that monoculture
appeared so too did the hunger for ever more land and labor.22</p>
<p>Like cotton growing, cotton manufacturing throughout the world began
in households, and, with few exceptions, stayed there until the
nineteenth century. In areas controlled by the Aztecs, for example, all
cotton manufacturing was organized within households. In Africa as well,
“in many cases the production of cotton goods was purely a family
industry, each social unit being entirely self-sufficient.” We have
similar testimony for India, China, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and
the Ottoman Empire. Household production enabled a family to produce the
cloth they needed, but it also allowed production for markets. Since
labor needs in most agricultural societies varied enormously by the
season, and since picked cotton could be stored for months, peasants
could focus on textile production intermittently and seasonally, during
slack times. This was especially the case for women, whose activities
focused on the house, with some of their labor available for the
homebound production of yarn and cloth.23</p>
<p>In every society a definite gender division of labor emerged, with a
particularly strong association between women and textile production.
Indeed, there was a premodern saying in China that “men till the soil
and women weave.” Except among the Navajo, Hopi, and some peoples in
Southeast Asia, women throughout the world have had a virtual monopoly
on spinning. Because spinning can be done intermittently, and enables a
simultaneous commitment to other activities, such as watching young
children and cooking, women’s roles within households usually led them
to be in charge of spinning as well. So close was the association of
women and cloth production that in some cultures women were buried with
their spinning tools. With weaving, on the other hand, no such stark
gender divisions emerged. While men tended to dominate the weaving
industry in places such as India and southeast Africa, there were many
cultures in which women wove as well, such as in Southeast Asia, China,
and North and West Africa. Yet even in societies in which both women and
men wove, they usually specialized in different designs, produced
distinct qualities, and worked on different types of looms. This
gendered division of labor was reproduced in the emerging factory system
as well, making gender relations in the household an important factor in
the emergence of factory production.24</p>
<p>Embedded within households and their particular strategies for
survival, this premodern cotton industry was also characterized by slow
technological change in ginning, spinning, or weaving. As late as the
eighteenth century, a woman in Southeast Asia, for example, needed a
month to spin a pound of cotton and another month to weave a piece of
cloth ten yards long.25 This enormous time requirement was partly the
result of what economists call “low opportunity costs” for the labor
that went into spinning and weaving, and partly of a world in which
rulers taxed their subjects’ production to the maximum extent possible.
Moreover, since many households were self-sufficient in textiles,
markets were of a limited scale, again reducing incentives to improve
production techniques.</p>
<p>Yet slow technological change was also related to constraints on the
supply of raw materials. In most regions of the world, raw cotton could
not be transported efficiently very far. Beasts of burden or humans
sometimes carried raw cotton over relatively short distances. In the
Aztec Empire, raw cotton was transported into highland areas to be
manufactured, at distances of perhaps a hundred miles. More efficient
and common was the waterborne cotton trade. In the second millennium CE,
for example, observers reported hundreds if not thousands of boats
floating cotton down the Yangtze to the region of Jiangnan. Gujarati and
central Indian cotton was similarly shipped on the Ganges and along the
coast to South India and Bengal. Nonetheless, until the nineteenth
century the overwhelming bulk of raw cotton was spun and woven within a
few miles from where it was grown.26</p>
<p>So many people in so many parts of the world grew cotton, spun it,
and wove it into fabrics that it was very likely the world’s most
important manufacturing industry. And while household production for
household consumption would remain until the nineteenth century its most
important sector, there was significant change before the Industrial
Revolution of the 1780s. Most importantly, cotton goods—partly because
they were so labor-intensive to produce—became an important store of
value and a medium of exchange. Rulers everywhere demanded cotton cloth
as tribute or taxes, and indeed it might be said that cotton was present
at the birth of political economy as such. Among the Aztecs, for
example, it was the most important medium for tribute payments. In
China, beginning in the fifteenth century, households were required to
pay some of their taxes in cotton cloth. And in Africa the payment of
tribute in cloth was common. Practical as a means to pay taxes, cotton
cloth was also used as currency in China, throughout Africa, in
Southeast Asia, and in Mesoamerica. Cloth was an ideal medium of
exchange because unlike raw cotton it could be easily transported over
long distances, was not perishable, and was valuable. Nearly everywhere
in the premodern world, a piece of cotton cloth could buy needed things:
food, manufactured goods, even protection.27</p>
<p>Cotton’s use as proto-money illuminates the fact that not all cotton
textiles, with their favorable ratio of value to weight, were used in
the immediate vicinity of their production. Indeed, the cotton centers
that had emerged separately in the Americas, Africa, and Asia all
developed increasingly sophisticated networks of trade, connecting
growers, manufacturers, and consumers over long, eventually even
transcontinental distances. In Iran, the ninth- and tenth-century cotton
industry led to significant urbanization, drawing raw cotton from the
surrounding countryside, spinning, weaving, and tailoring it to sell
into long-distance markets, especially in what is today Iraq. In
precolonial Burkina Faso one author finds that “cotton was at the center
of trade.” Gujarati cotton cloth, as early as the fourth century BCE,
came to play a very significant role in the trade between the various
lands bordered by the Indian Ocean, and large quantities were sold along
the East African coast, to be traded far into the African hinterland. In
all of these exchanges, traders, especially if far removed from the
polities they originated from, had to adjust to local tastes, and had to
offer their products at prices attractive to local consumers.28</p>
<p>In Mesoamerica, cloth was traded over many hundreds of miles,
including to neighboring states, as, for example, when merchants brought
cloth from Teotitlán (in modern-day Oaxaca) to Guatemala. In the
Southwest of what is now the United States, yarn and cloth were also
important trade items. Cotton goods have been found in excavations far
from regions in which cotton could grow. Since the thirteenth century,
Chinese merchants imported cotton yarn and cloth to supplement domestic
production from as far away as Vietnam, Luzon, and Java. In similar
ways, African merchants traded cotton textiles over long distances, as
for example when they exchanged Malinese cotton cloth for salt brought
in by desert nomads. Ottoman cotton textiles found their way to places
as distant as western Europe, while cotton goods were already being
imported into Japan in the thirteenth century.29</p>
<p>India, at the center of this increasingly global reach, traded with
the Roman Empire, Southeast Asia, China, the Arab world, North Africa,
and East Africa. Indian cottons crisscrossed South Asia on the backs of
people and bullocks. They crossed the seas in Arab dhows, traversed the
great Arabian Desert to Aleppo on the backs of camels, moved down the
Nile to the great cotton mart of Cairo, and filled the bottoms of junks
on their way to Java. Already in the sixth century BCE Indian cotton was
traded to Egypt, as merchants brought Indian cotton to Red Sea and
Persian Gulf ports. Greek merchants then took it from Egypt and also
Persia to Europe. Roman merchants eventually participated in this trade
as well, making cotton a coveted luxury good among the imperial elites.
Throughout eastern Africa, Indian cottons were an important presence as
well. And throughout the Arab world and Europe, India remained a major
supplier until the nineteenth century, with Gujarati merchants, among
others, unloading huge quantities of cloth. As an Ottoman official
complained in 1647, “So much cash treasury goes for Indian merchandise
that…the world’s wealth accumulates in India.”30</p>
<p>Indian cloth also traded eastwards into other parts of Asia.
Merchants sold it in the marts of China in very ancient times. Huge
quantities of Indian cloth also found their way to Southeast Asia to
clothe the local elite: Imports to Malacca in the early sixteenth
century, it has been estimated, filled the holds of fifteen ships that
arrived annually from Gujarat, Coromandel, and Bengal. So dominant was
Indian cloth on world markets that around 1503 the Italian merchant
Lodovico de Varthema observed about the Gujarati port town of Cambay,
“This city supplies all Persia, Tartary, Turkey, Syria, Barbary, i.e.,
Arabia Felix, Africa, Ethiopia, India and a multitude of inhabited
islands, with silk and cotton stuff.” The Sanskrit word for cotton goods
(karpasi) entered into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, Armenian,
Malay, Uigur, Mongolian, and Chinese. Even the names of particular
fabrics became global brand names—chintz and jackonet, for example, are
corruptions of terms in Indian languages that eventually came to
describe a particular style throughout the world. Beginning in the
seventeenth century, Indian cottons, in fact, were what historian
Beverly Lemire has called the “first global consumer commodity.”31</p>
<p>As demand grew, cotton took its first tentative steps out of the
home. During the second millennium CE, production in cotton workshops
became more common, especially in Asia. Professional weavers emerged in
India; they focused on supplying the long-distance trade, providing
rulers and wealthy merchants both at home and abroad with cotton cloth.
In Dhaka, weavers labored under tight supervision to produce muslins for
the Mughal court, “forced to work only for the Government which paid
them ill and kept them in a sort of captivity.” Workshops containing
more than one loom are also reported to have been located in Alamkonda,
in modern-day Andhra Pradesh, as early as the fifteenth century. In
contrast to the subsistence weavers, the long-distance tradesmen were
geographically concentrated: Bengal was known for its fine muslins, the
Coromandel coast for its chintzes and calicoes, and Surat for its strong
but inexpensive fabrics of every kind. Though weavers could occupy very
different positions within India’s caste system, in some parts of the
subcontinent they found themselves in the upper reaches of social
hierarchies, prosperous enough to be among the leading donors to local
temples. Groups of full-time cotton manufacturers emerged in other parts
of the world as well: In fourteenth-century Ming China, for example,
higher-quality textiles were worked up in “urban loom houses,” which
collectively employed many thousands of workers. In the Ottoman city of
Tokat, highly skilled weavers produced significant quantities of cotton
textiles. Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra, among other cities in the Islamic
world, had large cotton workshops, and indeed the word muslin for fine
cottons derives from Musil, the Kurdish name for Mosul. In Bamako, the
capital of present-day Mali, up to six hundred weavers plied their
trade, while in Kano, the “Manchester of West Africa,” a large weaving
industry arose, supplying the people of the Sahara with cloth. In
Timbuktu, already in the 1590s twenty-six cotton-producing workshops
plied their trade, each with fifty or more workers. In Osaka as well,
thousands of workers wove cotton textiles; workshops spread throughout
the region employing thirty to forty thousand people by the early
eighteenth century.32</p>
<p>As the workshop became more common, so too did a new type of weaver:
an individual, usually male, who produced specifically for sale in a
market. Yet even as workshops emerged, this specialized production for
markets typically took place in the countryside, not towns, and in
homes, not workshops. What set these rural market producers apart from
those who produced for subsistence only was their reliance on an
emerging force in global commerce: putting-out networks held together by
merchant capital. In these networks, which would form the nuclei of
nineteenth-century mechanized cotton production, spinners and weavers
worked up cotton thread and cloth for urban merchants who would collect
the products of the spinners and weavers and then sell them on distant
markets. The particular ways merchant capitalists and producers related
to one another varied widely. On the Indian subcontinent, for example,
rural weavers relied on merchants for the capital needed to purchase
sufficient yarn, and for the food they needed to subsist while weaving,
yet these weavers generally owned their own tools, worked without
supervision, and enjoyed some control over the disposal of their
products. In other parts of the world, rural weavers enjoyed
considerably less power. In the Ottoman Empire, for example, merchants
advanced cotton and yarn to peasants, who spun and wove it, then
returned the product to the merchants for a small profit. Unlike weavers
in India, they did not have any control over disposal of the product. In
China merchants also enjoyed great control over production. “They bought
up raw cotton, put it out at local markets for peasant women to spin and
to weave, had the cloth dyed and calendared in town or city workshops
and then exported it all over China for sale.” Merchants, in fact,
controlled every stage of production, foreshadowing their central role
in the nineteenth-century construction of a globe-spanning empire of
cotton.33</p>
<p>With expanding markets, cotton technology changed as well. While the
basic principles of cotton processing were quite similar throughout the
world, and productivity was dramatically lower before the invention of
the novel gins, spinning machines, and looms of the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries, there were some significant innovations. In
Mesoamerica, for example, spinning was improved by the introduction of
“specially formed ceramic spindle whorls.” After 1200 CE, Mesoamericans
also used specifically designed spinning bowls, which increased the
productivity of spinners, enabling them, among other things, to feed the
voracious appetite for tribute of their rulers. The center of
technological innovation, however, was Asia: The roller gin (to remove
seeds), the bow (to clean and disentangle ginned cotton), the spinning
wheel, and new kinds of looms, including the upright warper, all
originated in Asia. The spinning wheel, invented in the eleventh
century, was an especially significant innovation as it allowed peasants
to spin cotton much faster. Weavers in the same regions also invented a
novel kind of loom—the treadle loom. While its exact origins are
uncertain, it was introduced into India sometime between 500 BCE and 750
CE, and into China (where it was first used in silk manufacturing) in
the third century CE.34</p>
<p>The greatest innovations occurred in the domestication of the cotton
plant itself, indeed so much so that the cotton picked by slaves in the
nineteenth century would be nearly unrecognizable to Indian farmers of
two thousand years earlier. Human selection made cotton compatible with
highly varied environmental conditions and rendered its fiber ever more
applicable to the production of textiles. Rural cultivators in China,
Japan, Southeast Asia, North and South America, western Africa, and
Anatolia brought cottonseeds from adjacent territories and added cotton
to their crop mix. Through the centuries, this process of domestication
drastically altered the physical properties of cotton, creating plants
that produced longer and brighter fibers (later-day cotton experts would
refer to the length of the fiber as “staple”), ever more plentiful and
easier to remove from the filbertlike shell. Moreover, advances in
irrigation techniques and agronomy allowed for the expansion of
production into new regions. Through seed selection and improved
technology, the cotton plant flourished in drier and colder parts of
Africa, Asia, and the Americas, including the mostly arid soils of the
Islamic world. In Iran, for example, investments in irrigation systems
as early as the ninth century enabled a significant extension of cotton
agriculture. Nonetheless, compared to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century
changes, overall productivity increases in the two thousand years prior
to the Industrial Revolution were small. For much of its history, the
world’s cotton industry expanded primarily because ever-increasing
numbers of people spent ever more time growing, spinning, and weaving
cotton.35</p>
<p>These manufacturing networks connecting rural spinners and weavers
with urban merchant capital, especially in Asia, created a gradual but
significant expansion of output for markets. They did so, however,
largely without exploding older social structures, without altering
production as it had been organized for centuries. The household, and
the technology associated with it, remained at their center. This
premodern world was safe behind two bulkheads: first, the markets for
finished goods, which were growing but, compared to the world after
1780, only at a modest pace, and second, the great obstacles to sourcing
raw cotton across long distances. A great countervailing force would be
needed to break through those ancient constraints.</p>
<p>For a very long time, in this remarkably diverse, fabulously vibrant,
and economically important world of cotton, Europe was nowhere to be
found. Europeans had remained marginal to networks of cotton growing,
manufacturing, and consumption. Even after they began importing small
quantities of cotton cloth during Greek and Roman times, they remained
of little importance to the global cotton industry as a whole. People
dressed, as they had since the Bronze Age, in clothing made from flax
and wool. As Mahatma Gandhi put it, while India supplied Europe with
cottons, Europeans themselves “were submerged in barbarism, ignorance
and a state of wilderness.”36</p>
<p>Cotton, quite simply, was exotic to Europe. The fiber grew in faraway
lands, and many Europeans reportedly imagined cotton as a mixture of a
plant and an animal—a “vegetable lamb.” Stories circulated in medieval
Europe about little sheep growing on plants, and bending down at night
to drink water; other fables told of sheep attached to the ground by low
stems.37</p>
<p>Cotton’s first serious incursion into Europe, as in West Africa, was
the result of the spread of Islam. By 950 CE, cotton was manufactured in
such Islamic cities as Seville, Córdoba, Granada, and Barcelona, as well
as Sicily; some of those textiles were exported to the rest of Europe.
During the twelfth century, the Seville botanist Abu Zacaria Ebn el Awam
published a treatise on agriculture that included a detailed description
of how to cultivate cotton.38 So tight was the association between Islam
and cotton that most western European languages borrowed their words for
the fiber from the Arabic qutun. French coton, English cotton, Spanish
algodón, Portugese algodão, Dutch katoen, and Italian cotone all derive
from the Arabic root. (The German Baumwolle and the Czech
bavlna—translated roughly as “tree wool”—are the exceptions that prove
the rule.) While the Christian Reconquista of Iberia in the first half
of the second millennium seriously contracted the region’s cotton
production, the centuries-long exposure to Arab technology and culture
left behind a familiarity with and appreciation for cotton textiles in
large areas of Europe.</p>
<p>The vegetable lamb: Europeans imagine the cotton plant. (illustration

<p>By the twelfth century, small pockets of Europe—particularly northern
Italy—returned to the world of cotton production, and this time to stay.
While Europe’s climate was largely unsuited for cotton growing, the
Crusaders had extended European power into the Arab world, and thereby
into areas where cotton grew naturally.39 The first endeavors to
manufacture cotton were modest, but the beginning of a trend that would
alter the continent’s history, and the world’s economy.</p>
<p>The first center of a non-Islamic cotton industry in Europe emerged
in northern Italy, in cities such as Milan, Arezzo, Bologna, Venice, and
Verona. The industry grew quickly, starting in the late twelfth century,
and came to play a vital role in these urban economies. In Milan, for
example, by 1450 the cotton industry employed a full six thousand
workers making fustians, fabrics using both cotton and linen.40 These
northern Italians became the dominant producers in Europe, and they
retained their position for about three centuries.41</p>
<p>Cotton manufacturing blossomed in northern Italy for two reasons.
First, these cities looked back on a long history of still vibrant wool
production, which had left them with skilled workers, capital-rich
merchants, and expertise in long-distance trade. Once entrepreneurs
decided to engage in cotton manufacturing, they could draw on those
resources. They advanced raw cotton to women in the surrounding
countryside to have it spun. They contracted with urban artisans,
organized in guilds, to weave the yarn. They branded and standardized
their goods, and drew upon their long-distance trade networks to export
goods to foreign markets throughout the Mediterranean, the Middle East,
Germany, Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary.42</p>
<p>Second, northern Italy had easy access to raw cotton. Indeed, the
northern Italian industry was from the beginning entirely dependent on
eastern Mediterranean cotton from such places as western Anatolia and
what today is Syria. Already in the eleventh century, cotton yarn and
cotton cloth had been imported into the ports of Venice, Genoa, and
Pisa, giving people a taste for cottons. Raw cotton imports followed in
the wake of the Crusades, with the first such trade documented for the
year 1125.43</p>
<p>As improvements in shipping allowed for the cheaper transportation of
bulk commodities, Venice became Europe’s first cotton entrepôt, the
Liverpool of the twelfth century. Some traders became dedicated cotton
merchants, buying low-grade raw cotton from Anatolia, while procuring
better-quality fiber from Syria. This supply was supplemented by
Genovese imports from Anatolia, Sicily, and Egypt. But despite importing
large quantities, European merchants had little if any impact on the
specific ways in which raw cotton was grown in the Levant: They bought
cotton from local merchants, loaded it on their ships, and transported
it across the sea. Nevertheless, Venice’s ability to insert itself into
and eventually dominate Mediterranean trade was crucial to the success
of the northern Italian cotton industry. Moreover, it was a harbinger of
the wedge that European states and capitalists would later drive into
the heart of the ancient cotton centers.44</p>
<p>Not only did the Mediterranean networks give Italian manufacturers
relatively easy access to raw cotton, but they also provided them with
access to “Eastern” technologies. Northern Italian entrepreneurs
appropriated technologies from the Islamic world—some of which had in
turn come from India and China. The twelfth century witnessed a “massive
infusion of outside technology into the European textile industry”—most
importantly the spinning wheel. Before the spinning wheel was introduced
into Europe in the middle of the thirteenth century, Europeans, like
Americans and Africans, had spun with hand spindles. It was a slow
process: A skilled spinner produced about 120 meters of thread per hour.
At that rate, it took about eleven hours to spin enough yarn for one
blouse. The spinning wheel increased the output of European spinners
tremendously, tripling productivity. Thus the availability of a new
material—cotton—led to the embrace of the new manufacturing technique,
which is why in medieval Europe the spinning wheel was also called the
“cotton wheel.” If less dramatic than the spinning wheel, improvement
also came to weaving with the horizontal treadle loom. First used in
Europe in the eleventh century, it enabled the weaver to change the
sheds—the device that separates some of the warp threads to allow the
shuttle to pass through—with his feet, freeing the hands to insert the
weft, and thus allowing for the production of finer-quality textiles. It
came to Europe from India or China via the Islamic world.45</p>
<p>The growth of the northern Italian cotton industry rested principally
on its access to raw cotton and manufacturing technology from the
Islamic world. Yet these linkages and dependencies would become Italy’s
principal vulnerabilities; the industry remained distant from the
sources of raw materials, and lacked control over the growing of cotton.
Northern Italy’s industry eventually suffered both from the
strengthening of the Islamic cotton industry and the marginalization of
its own trade networks with the Islamic world.46</p>
<p>Yet even before the disruption of these crucial networks, the Italian
industry faced another challenge: the rise of nimbler competitors north
of the Alps, in the cities of southern Germany. They drew, like their
Italian counterparts, on cotton from the Levant. But while Italian
manufacturers faced high taxes, high wages, well-organized urban
weavers, and guild restrictions, German producers enjoyed the advantage
of the more tractable German countryside, where they gained access to
cheap labor. By the early fifteenth century, German manufacturers had
used this cost differential not only to capture many of the Italian
export markets, including eastern and northern Europe, Spain, the Baltic
region, the Netherlands, and England, but to make inroads even into the
Italian market itself.47</p>
<p>Horizontal treadle loom, Milan, middle of the fourteenth century
(illustration credit 1.3)</p>
<p>One such enterprising manufacturer arrived in the southern German
town of Augsburg in 1367. The young weaver Hans Fugger at first tried to
sell his father’s cotton fabrics, but in due course set up as a master
weaver himself. In the next decades, he expanded his investments,
eventually employing a hundred weavers in Augsburg to supply the
long-distance trade. By the time of his death, he was among the fifty
wealthiest citizens of Augsburg, and had laid the foundation for the
rise of one of the wealthiest merchant and banking families of medieval
Europe.48</p>
<p>Hans Fugger furthered the rapid establishment of a dynamic cotton
industry in southern Germany in the span of just one generation. Between
1363 and 1383, the output of German weavers effectively supplanted
Lombardy fustians on European markets. Fugger and others like him
succeeded because they had access to skilled textile workers, capital,
and trade networks. With its long history of linen production, southern
Germany had powerful long-distance traders with sufficient capital to
fund a new industry. But these traders also had access to cheap labor,
northern European markets, and the ability to enforce regulations
guaranteeing the quality of their products. As a result, cities such as
Ulm, Augsburg, Memmingen, and Nuremberg became major centers of fustian
production. The industry eventually spread east along the Danube and
south to Switzerland.49</p>
<p>The control of a rural workforce was crucial. In Ulm, for example,
one of the most important manufacturing centers, only about two thousand
people were busy with cotton production in the city itself, while
eighteen thousand workers labored on cottons in the hinterland. Indeed,
most of the weaving was done in the countryside, not the city, as
merchants provided money, raw materials, and even tools to spinners and
weavers—another putting-out network like the ones that characterized the
Indian countryside. This organization of production was much more
flexible than urban production, since no guilds regulated it and since
rural weavers continued to have access to their own land and thus grew
their own food.50</p>
<p>With the emergence of a cotton industry in northern Italy and
southern Germany, small regions of Europe for the first time became a
minor part of the global cotton economy. Yet within Europe, the industry
was not yet particularly prominent. Europeans still largely dressed in
linen and woolens, not cottons. And hardly any European cotton goods
were consumed outside the continent itself. Moreover, after the early
sixteenth century, the Venice-dependent European industry declined, as
the Thirty Years War disrupted the industry and trade shifted away from
the Mediterranean and toward the Atlantic. In the sixteenth century,
indeed, Venice lost control over the Mediterranean trade to a
strengthened Ottoman Empire, which was encouraging domestic industries
and restricted the export of raw cotton. When Ottoman troops
consolidated their hold on the realm in the 1560s, the effects were felt
in distant German cotton textile towns. The rise of the Ottoman Empire,
a powerful state capable of controlling raw and manufactured cotton
flows, ruined the northern Italian and German cotton industries. To make
matters worse for the once dominant Venetians, by the end of the
sixteenth century British ships called ever more frequently in ports
such as Izmir (Ottoman Smyrna); in 1589 the sultan granted the English
merchants far-reaching trading privileges.51</p>
<p>Some shrewd observers surely noted that the first European cotton
producers, both the northern Italians and the southern Germans, failed
at least in part because they had not subjugated those people who
supplied them with cotton. It was a lesson that would not be forgotten.
As the sixteenth century came to a close, an entirely new cotton
industry arose that focused on the Atlantic, not the Mediterranean.
Europeans took for granted that only the projection of state power would
ensure success in these new trade zones.52</p>
