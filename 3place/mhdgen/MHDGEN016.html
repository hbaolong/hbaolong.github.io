Weave and the Weft: An Epilogue</h4>
<p>The empire of cotton I: Walmart, 2013 (illustration credit 14.1)</p>
<p>The empire of cotton II: Bangladesh, April 2013</p>
<p>Europe’s reign over the cotton empire ended with a whimper. It was
the year 1963, the year Liverpool’s most renowned band, the Beatles, was
first heard in the United States, the year the Reverend Martin Luther
King Jr. had “a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi…will be
transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice,” and the year when the
huge Bhakra Dam opened in India, providing water to 2.8 million acres of
land, much of it cotton fields. On a rainy and cold December morning, a
group of Liverpudlians met at the Cotton Exchange Building on Old Hall
Street. They were there not to rule over their empire, but to dismantle
it. The day’s task was to auction off the “valuable club furnishings”
that for the previous century had graced the offices of the Liverpool
Cotton Association. Attendees purchased close to a hundred items,
including a “trader’s Desk in Mahogany,” “Mahogany Quotation Board
frames,” a “Weather Map of the United States in Mahogany Frame,” and S.
A. Hobby’s painting Cotton Plant. The Cotton Exchange Building itself
had been sold a year earlier for lack of business.1</p>
<p>Founded in 1841, for more than a century the association had played a
central role in regulating the global cotton trade. As the buyers of
chairs, desks, lamps, shelves, sofas, and paintings carted their loot
through the streets of this increasingly sad city, it would have been
difficult, if not impossible, for them to imagine that a mere hundred
years earlier, Liverpool was one of the world’s wealthiest cities, a
vital linchpin connecting cotton growers in the Americas, Africa, and
Asia with European manufacturers and customers all across the globe.</p>
<p>But by 1963, Europe’s domination of the empire of cotton was over. By
the late 1960s, the United Kingdom could only claim 2.8 percent of
global cotton cloth exports, a market it had so decisively dominated for
a century and a half. Of the more than six hundred thousand workers who
had once labored in British mills, only thirty thousand remained. Cotton
towns crumbled as workers whose families had labored on mules and looms
for generations found themselves unemployed. The symbolic evidence of
the continent’s fall had come in 1958, when the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce, long an adamant champion of free trade, reversed course and
declared that the British cotton industry needed protection—an
unintended but obvious expression of defeat. Yet while Europe, and
increasingly the United States, had become marginal to this marvelously
productive and frighteningly violent system of production, the empire
itself persisted. Indeed, while today’s cotton industry would be nearly
unrecognizable to the nineteenth-century members of the Liverpool Cotton
Association or the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, the world today
creates and consumes more cotton than ever before.2</p>
<p>Chances are the shirt or pants or socks you are wearing as you read
this are made out of cotton. Those pieces have found their way to you,
just as cotton has clothed your parents and grandparents and
great-grandparents, thanks to the efforts of growers, spinners, weavers,
tailors, and merchants in distant parts of the globe, each inhabiting a
world quite different from one another. Yet while a century ago your
shirt would have likely been sewn in a shop in New York or Chicago,
using fabric spun and woven in New England, from bolls grown in the
American South, today it is probably made of cotton grown in China,
India, Uzbekistan, or Senegal, spun and woven in China, Turkey, or
Pakistan, and then manufactured in a place like Bangladesh or Vietnam.
If any part of the cotton empire, whose rise this book has charted, was
involved in your shirt at all, that unlikely, vestigial element would be
American-grown cotton. Twenty-five thousand highly capitalized cotton
farmers remain in the United States, mostly in Arizona and Texas. The
cotton they grow is so uncompetitive on the world market that they
receive enormous federal subsidies to continue to farm it, subsidies
that in some years equal the GDP of the country of Benin
(coincidentally, another important cotton grower).3</p>
<p>While a small group of American cotton farmers hangs on, the cotton
mills that were once so important to the economies of Europe and North
America alike are nearly gone. If those hulking buildings have not been
torn down, they have been turned into shopping malls, artist studios,
industrial-chic condos, or museums. Indeed, the downfall of the cotton
industry in the global North has created a boom in textile museums. You
can visit the Boots Cotton Mills Museum in Lowell, Massachusetts, Quarry
Bank Mill near Manchester, the former Wesserling mill turned museum just
outside Mulhouse, the Memphis Cotton Museum housed in the former Memphis
Cotton Exchange, the textile museum of Wiesenthal in the Black Forest,
James Henry Hammond’s Redcliffe Plantation in South Carolina, the
twenty-mile-long hiking trail of the Ruta de les Colònies along the
Llobregat River in Spain’s Catalonia with its eighteen abandoned cotton
mills, and dozens, perhaps hundreds of other sites as well. The empire
of cotton, which for a century and a half shaped and reshaped global
capitalism in its image, is now the object of family outings. Parents
and their kids wander the quaint-looking factories in their often
idyllic surroundings; they watch the spinners and weavers in period
costume who demonstrate the workings of the antiquated machines, holding
their ears to block the noise of power looms and staring at photographs
of children—prematurely aged, as if from a different planet—who not too
long ago worked sixty-hour weeks on those same machines. Cotton
plantations, too, have been reshaped for tourists. Here, though, the
horrors of slave labor are downplayed or hidden—often intentionally
overpowered by the sights of magnificent mansions, beautiful vistas, and
well-tended gardens. But none of these historic curiosities can display
the greatest invention of the empire of cotton: the globe-spanning
network that connected growers, manufacturers, and consumers, a network,
that, though radically altered and far from these museums, persists to
this day.</p>
<p>As European and North American tourists gaze at the remnants of the
empire of cotton, and communities and workers from Fall River to Oldham
struggle with the aftereffects of postindustrial devastation, millions
of workers stream into textile mills in China, India, Pakistan, and
elsewhere, while further millions of farmers tend to cotton crops in
Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Thanks to their often ill-paid efforts,
about 98 percent of all garments sold in the United States today are
made abroad. China alone supplies the United States with about 40
percent of all apparel, followed by Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Honduras, Cambodia, Mexico, India, El Salvador, and Pakistan. Fabric and
yarn no longer come primarily from the United Kingdom or even the
American South: China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey spin and weave the
most cotton globally. Today, China’s factories contain nearly half of
the world’s spindles and looms, working up 43 percent of the world’s raw
cotton (Asia’s total is 82.2 percent), while North America uses 4.2
percent and western Europe 0.7 percent of the global cotton harvest.
After more than two hundred years, most global cotton use is once again
concentrated in the pre-1780 heartlands of the cotton industry. As a
managing director of the New York textile firm Olah Inc. put it,
“China’s industry is such a large portion of the global market that,
plainly put, the global industry goes the way of China.” Moreover, it is
less and less likely that the shirt on your back is made of cotton at
all: Beginning in the mid-1990s, production of synthetic fiber began to
outpace cotton textile manufacturing. Today, about 52 million metric
tons of petroleum-based synthetic fiber is produced annually to make,
for instance, the fleece jacket you might be wearing, almost twice the
worldwide figure for cotton.4</p>
<p>The ruins of the empire of cotton: Cal Rosal, Spain, 2013
(illustration credit 14.2)</p>
<p>The centers of growing have shifted in parallel with the shift in
manufacturing. While in 1860 the United States had a near monopoly on
cotton growing for export, today only 14 percent of cotton worldwide is
grown in North America. Instead, China and India lead the way, producing
34 million and 26 million bales of cotton yearly, compared to the United
States’ 17 million bales. Global production has increased by a factor of
seven since 1920, with cotton growing becoming immensely important to
the economies of many countries, particularly in Asia and West Africa.
It has been estimated that 10 million farmers in Central and West Africa
alone depend on cotton. Worldwide, estimates of the number of people
involved in the growing and manufacturing of cotton range from
approximately 110 million households involved in the growing of cotton,
90 million in its transportation, ginning, and warehousing, and another
60 million workers operating spinning and weaving machines and stitching
together clothing, to a total for all branches of that industry of 350
million people. This number, never before reached in one industry,
represents between 3 and 4 percent of the world’s population. More than
35 million hectares of land are dedicated to the growing of cotton, the
equivalent of the surface area of Germany.5</p>
<p>Some nations, just like European colonial powers in Africa a century
earlier, have policies in place to force farmers to produce cotton,
despite its often devastating environmental and financial consequences.
Uzbekistan, for instance, one of the globe’s top ten cotton exporters,
continues to force its farming population to grow cotton despite the
fact that the need to irrigate its dry lands has essentially drained the
Aral Sea and turned much of the country into virtual salt flats. As one
Uzbek cotton farmer told a journalist, “We are destroying ourselves….
Why are we planting cotton, and what are we getting from it?” Moreover,
the emergence of new, genetically modified cotton plants has doubly
amplified the burdens of many farmers. The seeds for these plants are
more expensive to buy and maintain, but they are also far more
productive, thus pushing costs up at the same time that they push cotton
prices down. Many Tajik cotton farmers, for instance, are locked in a
cycle of debt and forced cotton production just like their counterparts
a century ago in India and the American South. Indeed, cotton growers
have remained relatively powerless. In India in 2005, after a season of
weak rains and crop failures, hundreds of heavily indebted farmers of
genetically modified cotton committed suicide by drinking their own
pesticides, a trend that persists to this day. Cotton production
continues to be an often brutal ordeal. For most farmers and workers,
cotton is far from the cuddly “fabric of our lives” touted by marketers
for the American cotton industry.6</p>
<p>Asia as the world center for cotton growing: the global cotton crop,
2012 (illustration credit 14.3)</p>
<p>One of the few geographic consistencies between the beginning of the
twenty-first century and the world before the Industrial Revolution of
the 1780s is the reemergence of Asia in the world of cotton. Both the
growing of cotton and the manufacturing of yarn and cloth continue on
their remigration to Asia, a process that began in the 1920s. We have
seen how budding Asian capitalists and state-building nationalists
studied Europeans’ penetration of territory and mastery over labor and
applied those techniques to their own postcolonial and, eventually, even
postcapitalist hinterlands. These states found novel ways to wed the
methods of industrial capitalism to nationalist development projects;
bureaucrats and statesmen of all stripes dreamed of “great leaps”
forward. In a century, these states redrew the geographic boundaries of
the empire of cotton; the combination of low wages and powerful states
enabled cotton growing and manufacturing to flourish once again in the
corner of the world where cotton was first grown, five thousand years
earlier. So powerful has the rise of Asia been that Asian states, China
first among them, are increasingly eager to set the rules of the global
cotton trade, a privilege once enjoyed by Liverpool merchants and,
later, the American government.7</p>
<p>In the course of that return to Asia, the balance of power between
growers, manufacturers, merchants, and statesmen shifted again, starting
after the 1970s. Consider that today it is commonplace for cotton grown
in Uzbekistan, Togo, or India to make its way through a Hong Kong
textile mill, then to a Vietnamese sewing shop, and finally onto a
clothing rack in Kansas City. It is not the distances that are new;
rather, it is the way the elaborate networks that move the fiber through
its various iterations are held together. Instead of manufacturers, or
cotton or cloth merchants, it is massive retailers like Walmart, Metro,
and Carrefour that have come to dominate the commodity chains linking
contractors, subcontractors, farmers, mills, and sweatshops.
Manufacturers no longer “push” their products upon consumers; instead,
products are “pulled” across oceans by retailers, allowing them to pit
manufacturers, contractors, and workers against one another to ensure
the quickest speed and lowest cost.8</p>
<p>This reemergence of merchants, particularly from the 1990s on, in the
form of retailers and branded apparel sellers as key actors comes as a
surprise. In some ways, of course, their power is reminiscent of the
importance of merchants in the first half of the nineteenth century. Yet
since the 1860s, as we have seen, the central actors in the empire of
cotton had been states in conjunction with manufacturers. States moved
to the forefront in the grand project of transforming the global
cotton-growing countryside, and in the process created a central role
for national manufacturers and, within careful limits, for organized
textile workers as well. These trends further accelerated in the
twentieth century. In the United Kingdom, to cite the most prominent
example, the British government, in response to wartime conditions, took
over the entire cotton market in 1941, including the purchase and
distribution of raw cotton. After the war, government control continued,
and to the great lament of the Liverpool Cotton Association, the
government’s Raw Cotton Commission remained the sole purchaser and
distributor of cotton in Britain. Merchants who had built a
globe-spanning network were reduced to begging the government for some
consideration of their interests. As the New York Times put it in 1946,
“It would be difficult to imagine a more direct blow to the whole system
of free world markets.” Yet the Times editors also registered,
accurately, that “this action with regard to cotton seems to represent a
world-wide bureaucratic distrust of the free market…combined with a
boundless faith in the magic of government ‘planning.’ ” It was only
when a Conservative government came to power and in 1953 passed the
Cotton Bill that the Liverpool market reopened, but even then it
continued to be structured by “subsidies, duties and currency
imbalances.” And it was in response to “the contraction of the merchant
element in the market” that the Liverpool Cotton Association would
eventually reorganize itself in 1963—and sell its furniture.9</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, the government also came to play an ever more
important role in the cotton industry. In response to the devastating
agricultural crisis of the 1920s and the subsequent Great Depression,
the New Deal created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, which
regulated production to match demand and provided subsidies to cotton
farmers—roles that continue to this day with ever increasing
controversy. Cotton growers and manufacturers themselves, cognizant of
the increasing importance of government, founded the National Cotton
Council in 1939 to lobby Washington and promote market and scientific
research on cotton. The Foreign Agricultural Service, an agency within
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was founded in 1953 to open markets
for American cotton all over the world. Its mission continues unabated
today. Throughout this period, tariffs and other protectionist measures
tried to keep America’s increasingly besieged cotton spinning and
weaving industry afloat. Yet in 1965, even in the cotton center of Fall
River, the last cotton mill closed its doors.10 By the 1970s, America’s
cotton complex, as well as the remnants of its British counterpart, was
completely dependent on government policies.</p>
<p>Though cotton merchants had facilitated the rise of the cotton empire
in the nineteenth century, by the middle of the twentieth they could do
little more than watch the state’s ascendancy. On the most extreme edge,
Spain’s Francisco Franco and Argentina’s Juan Perón, among others,
pushed for domestic cotton growing to insulate the nation from the world
market. Yet the power of government projected itself nowhere more than
in postcolonial and postcapitalist states, best exemplified by China’s
“leap forward” and India’s five-year plans. In Communist China and
independent India, state planners envisioned vast expansions in growth
and manufacturing; production skyrocketed. In China, low prices for
seeds, fertilizers, and farm supplies and generous farm credits, along
with the encouragement of the use of fertilizers and insecticides on
consolidated, state-owned land, and the preferential treatment of
high-yield cotton strains, resulted in startling increases in cotton
output. Cotton manufacturing took off as well: In 1952, the People’s
Republic of China produced 656,000 tons of cotton thread, a remarkable
increase from previous decades but still well behind the world’s
leaders. By 1957 China had turned itself into the world’s third largest
manufacturer of cotton yarns, its output two and a half times that of
the United Kingdom. And in 1983 3.27 million tons poured out of its huge
state-owned cotton mills.11 The growth of India’s industry followed
suit.12</p>
<p>The dominance of China, a self-proclaimed peasants’ and workers’
state, would have seemed like a hallucination to the cotton kings of the
early nineteenth century—to the Hammonds of South Carolina, the
Rylandses of Manchester, the Dollfuses of Mulhouse, the Barings of
Liverpool, and the Volkarts of Winterthur. They could not have imagined
that by 2008 a semimilitary unit of the People’s Republic of China, the
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, would grow 1.3 million tons
of cotton, or 5 percent of the world’s total. Yet the coupling of state
building and industrialization was the norm. That marriage would succeed
in other parts of the world as well, such as the Soviet Union, which
further recast cotton agriculture in Central Asia to facilitate a truly
spectacular increase in the output of raw cotton. In 1980 the Soviet
Union produced nearly 6 billion pounds of cotton, making it the world’s
largest producer after China. These stratospheric gains—production
increased by about 70 percent between 1950 and 1966 alone—were only
possible because of massive state investments in irrigation,
fertilizers, and machinery.13</p>

cotton to the state, Wu Shaoyun, 1958 (illustration credit 14.4)</p>
<p>Such recourse to the state in postcolonial and postcapitalist
societies was not a return to the war capitalism of the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries, but a sharpening of the tools and an
enhancing of the methods of industrial capitalism. Even though force
continued to play an important role in mobilizing labor, outright
physical coercion now represented industrial capitalism’s most extreme
edge. While differences between the global South and Europe and North
America were significant, from a long-term perspective what is most
remarkable is the way that over the course of the twentieth century the
trajectory of the empire of cotton converged more and more with the
goals of state-led development.14 State-directed economic planning,
which had claimed its first great victories in Europe’s scattered
imperial possessions, was by the 1950s the globe’s efficient and
seemingly inevitable norm.</p>
<p>Yet the particular form of the state’s reign in the twentieth century
would be as brief as the merchant’s reign in the nineteenth century. As
mentioned, by the 1970s, with the decline of cotton manufacturing in
Europe and the United States, and with the slow dissolution of the
alliance between manufacturers and the state, the empire of cotton saw
the emergence of a new breed of merchant—not the well-connected
individual walking the streets of Liverpool inspecting cotton bales, but
immense corporations that source their branded goods globally to sell
them to consumers worldwide. The growth of this new group was aided
immeasurably by two broader shifts that they had nothing to do with. As
manufacturing, particularly of cotton textiles, became much less
important to European and North American economies, the ability of north
Atlantic states to shape the cotton industry shrank accordingly. But
these merchants also grew more powerful as an unintended result of one
of the state’s great successes. By the mid-twentieth century,
governments had transformed the global countryside; the capitalization
of everyday life had reached an unprecedented level. Most of the world’s
people were now inextricably tied to both commodity production and
consumption. As a result, capitalists no longer needed the state to turn
rural cultivators into cotton growers, a reservoir of factory labor, and
consumers of those textiles. That process was already far advanced,
meaning that these new merchants can now profit from a larger market of
consumers and a larger labor reservoir than has ever existed in human
history.</p>
<p>But their successes were also due to their ability to organize
production globally, and to create branded goods and the sales channels
to offer them for purchase all over the world. Unlike in the nineteenth
century, these modern merchants focus not on the trade in raw cotton,
yarn, and cloth, but on the apparel business. They source cotton, yarn,
cloth, and clothing from the cheapest suppliers they can locate, without
engaging in manufacturing themselves. They then focus their energies on
developing channels to sell those goods, with branding, as in the case
of the American company Gap (“Get together”), Chinese Meters/bonwe (“Be
different”), and German Adidas (“Adidas is all in”), but also with the
development of new forms of retailing, as in the case of Walmart (United
States), Lojas Americanas S.A. (Brazil), and Carrefour (France). To
dominate this global cotton supply chain, these merchants still depend
on state power, but their reliance on any one specific state has
lessened considerably. As a result, they foster competition not just
between manufacturers and growers, but among states. In today’s empire
of cotton, merchants have finally managed to emancipate themselves from
their previous dependence on particular states. As a result, the
protections that strong nation-states offered, to at least some of their
workers, for at least part of the twentieth century, have been gradually
eroded. Workers today are increasingly at the mercy of corporations that
can easily shift all forms of production around the globe. Globalization
is nothing new in the empire of cotton, but the ability of capitalists
to utilize a number of states and thus remain free of the demands of all
of them, is new. The state, the very institution that facilitated
capitalists’ rise to wealth and power in the first place, is now
increasingly desperate for their investments.</p>
<p>Yet the prominence of today’s apparel giants and retailers should not
blind us to ongoing patterns; these cotton capitalists continue to rely
on the state—in many subtle ways, and some not so subtle ways. In the
United States, as mentioned, huge subsidies keep cotton farmers in
business: In 2001, the U.S. government paid a record billion in
subsidies to cotton growers, a cost that exceeded the market value of
the crop by 30 percent. To put it another way, these subsidies amounted
to triple that year’s USAID payments to all of Africa, a part of the
world where production costs for cotton were only about a third of what
they were in the United States. In fact, in 2002, Brazil lodged a
lawsuit against the United States through the World Trade Organization,
alleging that the government’s cotton subsidies violated its own
previous trade commitments. As part of the settlement, the U.S.
government now also supports the Brazilian cotton economy, at a rate of
47.3 million a year. The European Union, in similar ways, produces its
own small cotton harvest, in Spain and Greece, thanks to subsidies
ranging from 160 to 189 percent of the world price for cotton. Highly
subsidized cotton then is dumped onto world markets, depressing prices
for the much more competitive cotton growers in Africa and
elsewhere.15</p>
<p>Elsewhere, states continue their active role in labor mobilization,
making more cotton available for retailers to fashion into ever cheaper
clothes. In Uzbekistan, the government forces children to help out in
the cotton harvest (it has been estimated that up to 2 million children
younger than fifteen are sent to the cotton fields), a “system [that] is
only sustainable under conditions of political repression,” reports the
International Crisis Group.16 In China the repression of independent
trade union activity keeps wages low. The emancipation of capitalists
from the state is thus not complete—the state still matters greatly—but
because cotton capital itself has become fluid and not tied to
particular territories, specific nation-states matter much less. Not
only has the geographic shape of the empire of cotton shifted once more,
but also the balance of power between growers, merchants, manufacturers,
and the state. Capitalism’s endless revolution continues.</p>

<p>Today’s empire of cotton, just as it has for the last 250 years,
connects growers, traders, spinners, weavers, manufacturers, and
consumers over huge geographic distances in ever-changing spatial
arrangements. This fundamental innovation—the connection across
space—was first forged by connecting slavery and wage labor in the
vicious cauldron of war capitalism, and has remained at the core of the
empire of cotton ever since. Yet the geography of these connections has
changed radically. Nodes once central within the empire of
cotton—Lancashire, for example—have been marginalized, while formerly
unimportant nodes, especially China, have become its very core.</p>
<p>The geographical rearrangement of economic relations is not just a
noteworthy element of capitalism or an interesting aspect of its
history; rather the constant shifting recombination of various systems
of labor, and various compositions of capital and polities is the very
essence of capitalism. As capitalists search for ever cheaper labor,
better infrastructure, and greater markets, they combine and recombine
the world’s workers and consumers, and the world’s lands and its raw
materials, in ever new ways.17 In that process, the collective action
(or lack thereof) of workers matters a great deal, as do the policies
(or lack thereof) of states. We have seen that the history of capital
and cotton can only be understood if we consider the history of many
different places and groups of people. Looking at just one part of the
empire leads to vast misunderstandings, for example the characterization
of the past fifty years as a world of deindustrialization (as some
European and North American social scientists have described it), when
exactly the opposite is true, as the greatest wave of industrialization
ever has overtaken the globe.</p>
<p>Capitalists, from the Barings of the eighteenth century to the titans
of today’s global retailers, forged many of the connections that created
the world we recognize today. Exploration of this history, however,
reveals that capitalists and states arose hand in hand, each
facilitating the ascendancy of the other. It is easy to assume, in our
relentlessly branded world, that today’s vast corporations exist
entirely on their own. Yet such a simplification misses the reality
that, historically, capitalists’ greatest source of strength was their
ability to rely on unusually powerful states—and simultaneously, for
much of capitalism’s history, the greatest weakness of these same
capitalists was that dependence on the state. It was this dependence
that gave workers an opening to improve the conditions of their labor.
We now know that the increasing emancipation of capital from particular
nation-states has dramatic consequences for the world’s workers.
Workers’ successes in improving their conditions almost always lead to
the reallocation of capital. For the last several decades, Walmart and
other retail giants have continually moved their production from one
poor country to a slightly poorer one, lured by the promise of workers
even more eager and even more inexpensive. Even Chinese production is
now threatened by lower-wage producers.18 The empire of cotton has
continued to facilitate a giant race to the bottom, limited only by the
spatial constraints of the planet.</p>
<p>The constant reshuffling of the empire of cotton, ranging from its
geography to its systems of labor, points toward an essential element of
capitalism: its ability to constantly adapt. Again and again, a
seemingly insurmountable crisis in one part of the empire generated a
response elsewhere; capitalism both demands and creates a state of
permanent revolution.</p>
<p>This permanent revolution is only possible because of the existence
of places and people whose lives can be turned upside down. These
frontiers of capitalism are often to be found in the world’s
countryside, and the journey through the empire of cotton reveals that
the global countryside should be at the center of our thinking about the
origins of the modern world. Although our historical imaginations are
usually dominated by cities, factories, and industrial workers, we have
seen that much of the emergence of the modern world occurred in the
countryside—by the often violent turning of rural people into the
creators and consumers of commodities made or used elsewhere.</p>
<p>This emphasis on the countryside allows for an equally important
emphasis—the importance of coercion and violence to the history of
capitalism. Slavery, colonialism, and forced labor, among other forms of
violence, were not aberrations in the history of capitalism, but were at
its very core. The violence of market making—forcing people to labor in
certain locations and in certain ways—has been a constant throughout the
history of the empire of cotton.</p>
<p>This emphasis calls into question some of the most ingrained insights
into the history of the modern world—for example, conceptualizing the
nineteenth century, as is so often done, as an age of “bourgeois
civilization,” in contrast with the twentieth century, which historian
Eric Hobsbawm has termed the “age of catastrophe.”19 An assessment such
as this can only be derived from a vision of the world that focuses its
moral judgments on Europe. Looked at from the perspective of much of
Asia, Africa, and the Americas, one can argue just the opposite—that the
nineteenth century was an age of barbarity and catastrophe, as slavery
and imperialism devastated first one pocket of the globe and then
another. It is the twentieth century, by contrast, that saw the
weakening of imperial powers and thus allowed more of the world’s people
to determine their own futures and shake off the shackles of colonial
domination. Without its Eurocentric distortions, decolonialization would
be at the very center of the narrative we tell about the twentieth
century—and this retelling would allow us to see that global capitalism
today is most fundamentally shaped by the struggles for independence.
Either way, our journey through the empire of cotton has shown that
civilization and barbarity are linked at the hip, both in the evolution
of the world’s first global industry and in the many other industries
that have modeled themselves after it.</p>
<p>Violence and coercion, in turn, are as adaptive as the capitalism
they enable, and they continue to play an important role in the empire
of cotton to this day. Cotton growers are still forced to grow the crop;
workers are still held as virtual prisoners in factories. Moreover, the
fruits of their activities continue to be distributed in radically
unequal ways—with cotton growers in Benin, for example, making a dollar
a day or less, while the owners of cotton growing businesses in the
United States have collectively received government subsidies of more
than 5 billion between 1995 and 2010.20 Workers in Bangladesh stitch
together clothing under absurdly dangerous conditions for very low
wages, while consumers in the United States and Europe can purchase
those pieces with abandon, at prices that often seem impossibly low.</p>
<p>Within this larger story of domination and exploitation, however,
sits a parallel story of liberation and creativity. The unfolding of
global capitalism, and its awesome adaptations during the past 250
years, has resulted in enormous advances in productivity. As late as the
1950s, it took sixty days of hard spinning and weaving labor to produce
enough clothing to fulfill the most minimal subsistence needs of a
family of five in northern China. Today, the average American family
(albeit at 2.5 persons also smaller than the Chinese family of the
1950s) spends only 3.4 percent of its household income on much more
ample clothing—that is, the equivalent of approximately eight days of
labor. Agriculture and industry have virtually exploded, as capitalist
social relations have enabled a growth in the churning out of goods that
has never been matched by any other system of production. Tellingly,
today there are expectations that cotton production will triple or
quadruple again by 2050. The human capacity to organize our efforts in
ever more productive ways should give us hope, the hope that our
unprecedented domination over nature will allow us also the wisdom, the
power, and the strength to create a society that serves the needs of all
the world’s people—an empire of cotton that is not only productive, but
also just. Considering the perpetual clashes of power at the center of
cotton’s story, a just world might seem like an idle dream. Yet, as we
have witnessed in the preceding pages, the least powerful members of
cotton’s empire have consistently tried to create such a world and at
times also have succeeded in effecting dramatic changes: A world that
seems stable and permanent in one moment can be radically transformed in
the next. The capitalist revolution, after all, perpetually re-creates
our world, just as the world’s looms perpetually manufacture new
materials.21</p>
