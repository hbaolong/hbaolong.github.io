Wages of War Capitalism</h4>
<p>Spinning mule, Lancashire, 1835 (illustration credit 3.1)</p>
<p>The revolution began in the most unlikely places: a quiet valley in
the low hills that surround Manchester, for example. Today just a short
bus ride away from the city’s bustling international airport, Quarry
Bank Mill attracts tourists as much for its well-kept gardens as for its
industrial history. Visitors stroll along the banks of the Bollin River,
whose waters over the millennia have cut a valley perhaps a hundred feet
deep into the surrounding fields.</p>
<p>Two centuries ago that river inspired a British merchant to launch
one of the most important experiments in human history. In 1784, on the
bank of the stream, Samuel Greg gathered together in a small factory a
few newfangled spinning machines, so-called water frames, a collection
of orphaned children, putting-out workers from surrounding villages, and
a supply of Caribbean cotton. Eschewing the power supply that spinners
had been using for hundreds of years—human—Greg put his yarn-spinning
machines into motion using the weight of falling water. Though modest in
size, Greg’s mill was unlike anything the world had seen. By 1784 here
and on a handful of riverbanks nearby, for the first time in human
history, machines powered by non-animate energy manufactured yarn. Greg
and his manufacturing contemporaries, after decades of tinkering, had
suddenly increased the productivity of one of mankind’s oldest
industries, and with it began to choreograph an unprecedentedly grand
movement of machines and people.</p>
<p>Samuel Greg’s venture was a quintessentially local event. Greg was
born in 1758 in Belfast, but grew up in Manchester, and moved to nearby
Styal soon after realizing the capacities embedded in its sleepy stream.
His workers came from the valleys, hills, and orphanages of Cheshire and
nearby Lancashire. Even his machines had recently been invented in
nearby towns and cities. Like Silicon Valley’s role as the incubator of
the late-twentieth-century computer revolution, the idyllic rolling
hills around Manchester emerged in the late eighteenth century as the
hotbed of that era’s cutting-edge industry—cotton textiles. In an area
forming an arc of about thirty-five miles around Manchester, the
countryside filled with mills, country towns turned into cities, and
tens of thousands of people moved from farms into factories.</p>
<p>What at first glance seems like a local, even provincial event,
however, could not have occurred without the ideas, materials, and
markets provided by the recasting of the worlds of cotton during the
previous three centuries. Greg’s factory was embedded within
globe-spanning networks—and would eventually spark around the world far
greater changes than Greg could comprehend. Greg secured the essential
raw material for production from his merchant relatives in Liverpool,
who had purchased it off boats from places like Jamaica and Brazil. The
very idea of cotton fabrics, and the technologies for finishing them, as
we know, came from Asia, India in particular, and Greg’s desire to
produce them was largely motivated by his hope to replace the products
of Indian spinners and weavers in domestic as well as international
markets. Last but not least, much of Greg’s production would leave the
United Kingdom for destinations elsewhere—feeding the slave trade on the
western coast of Africa, dressing Greg’s very own slaves on the island
of Dominica, and catering to consumers in continental Europe. Samuel
Greg was able to draw upon all of these networks in large part because
British merchants had long dominated them.</p>
<p>The actual material contribution made by Greg and his colleagues
during the heyday of the Industrial Revolution between 1780 and 1815
would still not come close to matching the volume and the quality of
Asian, Latin American, and African spinners and weavers. Yet their mills
were the future. These water-powered (and, soon, steam-powered)machines,
driven by relentless innovation, animated by wage workers, enabled by
significant capital accumulation and the willing encouragement of a new
kind of state, seemed almost magical, and they created the central
pillar of the empire of cotton. From this local spark, England came to
dominate a many-pronged world economy, making one of humanity’s most
important industries its own. From this local spark, industrial
capitalism would emerge and eventually spread its wings across the
globe. From this local spark, the world as most of us know it
emerged.</p>
<p>The changing spatial arrangements between growers, manufacturers, and
consumers of cotton in the world, 2000 BCE–1860 CE. Phase I: Multipolar,
disconnected. Phase II: After 1600, networks focused increasingly on
Europe, but production remained dispersed. Phase III: After the
Industrial Revolution, production networks focused on Europe, and a
multicentric industry became unipolar. (illustration credit 3.2)</p>
<p>“This Land of Long Chimneys”: The Industrial Revolution in the United
Kingdom, 1780–1815</p>
<p>Samuel Greg was important to this story; he and his contemporaries
shaped the future. But like most successful revolutionaries, they relied
on the past, on the networks constructed by British merchants, planters,
and the state during the previous two hundred years. In other words, the
power they harnessed in water was only possible because of the power
harnessed by war capitalism. Slavery, colonial domination, militarized
trade, and land expropriations provided the fertile soil from which a
new kind of capitalism would sprout. Greg’s genius lay in realizing that
risk-taking English entrepreneurs like him could build upon this
material and institutional heritage and generate unprecedented wealth
and power by embracing the heretofore ungentlemanly world of
manufacturing.</p>
<p>Greg had deep roots in war capitalism, its violent appropriation of
territory and slave labor, as well its reliance on the imperial state to
secure new technologies and markets. He had secured his part of the
family fortune through Hillsborough Estate, a profitable sugar
plantation on the Caribbean island of Dominica, where he held hundreds
of enslaved Africans until the final abolition of slavery in British
territories in 1834. Greg’s uncles Robert and Nathaniel Hyde, who had
raised him from age nine and also provided much of the capital for the
building of Quarry Bank Mill, were also textile manufacturers, West
Indian plantation owners, and merchants. Greg’s wife, Hannah Lightbody,
was born into a family involved in the slave trade, while his
sister-in-law’s family had moved from the slave trade into the export of
cloth to Africa.1</p>
<p>Most of Greg’s fellow cotton manufacturers came from considerably
less prosperous circumstances, without Caribbean slave plantations. They
had accumulated only modest amounts of capital, but had a wealth of
tinkering spirit and technical aptitude—as well as a hunger for the huge
profits that might be generated by manufacturing. Yet they, too, drew
their essential raw material—cotton—from slave labor. Even they catered
to markets that had first been opened by the trade in Indian cotton
textiles, textiles that had been kept out of many European markets in
order to protect noncompetitive European producers. And they, too, drew
on Indian technologies captured through British imperial expansion on
that continent. Many, moreover, used capital accumulated via the
Atlantic trade and catered to Atlantic markets—especially in Africa and
in the Americas, economies fueled almost exclusively by slave labor. And
for them, war capitalism had also provided many learning
opportunities—how to organize long-distance trade, for example, how to
run domestic industries; an understanding of the mechanisms to move
capital across oceans—lessons that informed the development of domestic
financial instruments. Even modern labor cost accounting had emerged
from the world of the slave plantation and only later migrated into
modern industry. And British entrepreneurs’ incentive and ability to
reinvent radically the production of cotton textiles was protected by a
powerful imperial state, a state that itself had been the product of war
capitalism.2</p>
<p>Bringing war capitalism home: Hannah Lightbody, Samuel Greg’s wife,
and daughter of a Liverpool merchant family (illustration credit
3.3)</p>
<p>Most crucially, by the second half of the eighteenth century, that
heritage allowed British merchants to assume commanding roles at many
vital nodes of the global cotton industry—even though British workers
produced only a tiny percentage of global output and Britain’s farmers
grew no cotton whatsoever. England’s domination of these global
networks, as we will see, was essential to recast production and become
the unlikely source of the cotton-fueled Industrial Revolution. While
certainly still revolutionary, industrial capitalism was the offspring
of war capitalism, the previous centuries’ great innovation.3</p>
<p>Samuel Greg and his fellow innovators knew that the global reach and
power of the British Empire gave them a tremendous advantage over their
fellow merchants and artisans in Frankfurt, Calcutta, or Rio de Janeiro.
Having started out as a merchant in the employ of his uncles, he had
already organized a large putting-out network of cotton spinners and
weavers in the Lancashire and Cheshire countryside before investing in
his new machines. In addition to the profits and labor from this
putting-out network, Greg had easy access to abundant capital from his
wife’s family. And the Rathbone family, which would become one of the
dominant players in the nineteenth-century cotton trade, stood ready in
1780 to supply raw cotton to Greg. He knew firsthand that the market for
cotton fabrics—in continental Europe, along the coast of Africa, and in
the Americas—was rapidly expanding.4</p>
<p>And while the upside was tremendous, the risks of these first
ventures were modest. In the 1780s, Greg invested at first a fairly
small amount of capital into his Quarry Bank Mill: £3,000, the
equivalent of about half a million U.S. dollars today. Then he recruited
ninety children between the ages of ten and twelve from nearby
poorhouses, attaching them for seven years to his factory as “parish
apprentices.” By 1800 he supplemented these children with 110 adult
workers who received wages. Greg sold his cloth first mostly to Europe
and the West Indies, and, after the 1790s, increasingly to Russia and
the United States. Thanks to those expanding markets, the new factory,
like others, was spectacularly profitable from the beginning, returning
annually 18 percent on his original investment, four times as much as UK
government bonds.5</p>
<p>Contemporary observers as well as modern historians have found many
reasons that explain Greg’s venture, and with it why the much broader
Industrial Revolution, “broke out” in this place, in northern England,
and at this time, in the 1780s. The genius of British inventors, the
size of the British market and its unusually deep integration, the
geography of Britain with its easy access to waterborne transport, the
importance of religious dissenters for thinking outside the box, and the
creation of a state favorable to entrepreneurial initiative have all
been cited.6 While none of these arguments are unimportant, they omit a
core part of the story of the Industrial Revolution: its dependence on
the globe-spanning system of war capitalism.</p>
<p>As a result of all these factors, for the first time ever, a new
character, the manufacturer, strode onto the scene, an individual who
used capital not to enslave labor or conquer territory, though that
remained essential, but to organize workers into great orchestras of
machine-based production. Manufacturers’ efforts to reorganize
production rested on new ways of mobilizing land, labor, and
resources—and called, among other things, for a new connection between
capitalists and the state. It was this nexus of social and political
power that together animated industrial capitalism, the transformational
invention of the Industrial Revolution. It was that innovation that
would, as we will see, eventually take wing and travel to other parts of
the world.</p>
<p>Fueled by the wages of war capitalism, Greg and his contemporaries,
as one observer remarked in the 1920s, “wrested the empire of cotton
from the East within a vigorous generation of invention,” rewriting the
entire geography of global cotton manufacturing. Their work was
revolutionary because it heralded a new institutional form for
organizing economic activity and a world economy in which rapid growth
and ceaseless reinvention of production became the norm, not the
exception. To be sure, important inventions had been made in the past,
and there had been moments of accelerated economic growth in various
regions of the world before the Industrial Revolution. Yet none of them
had created a world in which revolution itself would become a permanent
feature of life, a world in which economic growth would, despite
periodic collapses, seem to fuel its own expansion. There had been no
radical acceleration of economic growth in the thousand years before
1800 in Europe or elsewhere, and any that had occurred had soon
foundered on the shoals of resource constraints, a food crisis, or
disease. Now industrial capitalism was creating an ever-changing world,
and cotton, the world’s most important industry, was the mainspring of
this unprecedented acceleration of human productivity.7</p>
<p>In retrospect, late-eighteenth-century England seemed ripe for a
reinvention of cotton manufacturing. British capitalists looked back on
two centuries of cotton textile production, had access to investable
capital, and employed ever more peasants to spin and weave at home.
Also, British textile producers based in households had withstood the
pressures of imports from India for decades, an experience that schooled
them in the importance of being able to compete with Indian
manufacturers to capture their markets. And last but not least, workers
were available to staff the new factories, workers who did not have the
ability to resist the process of being turned from rural cultivators or
artisans into wage laborers. These factors provided the necessary
conditions for a radical reimagining of production and the institutions
in which it was embedded. Such conditions, however, were hardly unique,
in fact they were shared, if not in all aspects, then at least in many
particulars, from China to India to continental Europe to Africa. They
cannot alone explain why the Industrial Revolution broke out in a small
part of the British Isles in the late eighteenth century.8</p>
<p>British capitalists, however, in contrast to their counterparts
elsewhere, controlled many global cotton networks. They had access to
uniquely dynamic markets, they dominated the transoceanic trade in
cottons, and they had firsthand knowledge of the fabulous potential
wealth that could come from selling cloth. The core problem faced by
British cotton manufacturers was the difficulty of competing with
high-quality yet cheap Indian products. In the course of the eighteenth
century, as we have seen, British producers had largely (though not
entirely) solved the quality problem by appropriating Indian technology.
Expanding output, and lowering costs, proved more difficult: The
putting-out networks that British merchants had built in the countryside
proved largely resistant to higher production. Work was performed
irregularly, additional workers were difficult to mobilize on short
notice, and transportation costs rose with the volume of work. And it
was difficult to enforce homogeneous quality in products spun and woven
on remote farms. With the existing technology and social organization of
production, British outworkers could hardly compete with cotton workers
in other parts of the world. Indeed, they succeeded mostly only in the
protected domestic and colonial markets.9</p>
<p>The main reason for this inability to compete, however, was wage
costs. Wages in the United Kingdom were significantly higher than in
other parts of the world; indeed, in 1770 Lancashire wages were perhaps
as much as six times those in India. Even though by this point improved
machinery meant that productivity per cotton worker in Britain was
already two to three times higher than in India, that multiplier was
still not sufficient to level the playing field. War capitalism had
created a fundamentally new set of opportunities for British cotton
capitalists, but it had no answer to the question of how to enter cotton
cloth markets in a globally significant way. Protectionism had been a
workable answer to a point, and was deployed to great success, but the
tantalizing possibility of global exports could not be preserved by such
prohibitions. What British cotton capitalists needed was a dynamic
combination of new technologies to lower costs, the further growth of
elastic markets that already had begun to expand on the tails of British
expansion, and a supportive state with the ability not just to protect
global empire but to transform society in Britain itself.10</p>
<p>Since labor costs were the primary obstacle to grasping the new
tantalizing opportunities, British merchants, inventors, and budding
manufacturers—practical men all—focused on methods to increase the
productivity of their high-cost labor. In the process, they effected the
most momentous technological change in the history of cotton. Their
first noteworthy innovation came in 1733 with John Kay’s invention of
the flying shuttle. This small wooden tool in the shape of the hull of a
ship allowed weavers to attach the weft thread and then propel it to
“fly” from one side of the loom to the other through the warp threads.
The shuttle doubled the productivity of weavers. At first it spread only
slowly, but its spread was unstoppable: After 1745, despite resistance
from weavers who feared for their livelihoods, it was widely
adopted.11</p>
<p>This tiny piece of wood propelled in novel ways prompted a cascade of
further innovations that would gradually but permanently change cotton
manufacturing. The spread of more productive weaving techniques put huge
pressure on spinning, as ever more spinners were needed to supply one
weaver with sufficient yarn to keep the looms working. Despite more
women in ever more households working longer hours on the spinning
wheel, the supply was insufficient. After Kay’s invention it took four
spinners to supply one weaver. Many artisans tried to find ways to
circumvent this bottleneck, and by the 1760s productivity increases
became possible with James Hargreaves’s invention of the spinning jenny.
The jenny consisted of a hand-operated wheel that would rotate a number
of spindles within a frame, while the spinner would use her other hand
to move a bar back and forth to extend the thread and then to wind it on
the spindles themselves. This machine was at first able to spin eight
separate threads, later sixteen or more, and as early as 1767 it had
tripled a spinner’s speed. It spread rapidly, and by 1786 there were
about twenty thousand in use in Britain.12</p>
<p>As early as 1769, however, spinning was already seeing further
improvements thanks to Richard Arkwright’s water frame, a machine that
anticipated Greg’s mill by relying on falling water. Consisting of four
rollers that drew out the cotton strands before a spindle twisted them
into thread, it allowed for continuous spinning, and unlike the jenny,
which had at first been mostly employed in people’s homes, the water
frame required larger amounts of energy, thus concentrating production
in factories. A decade later, in 1779, Samuel Crompton’s mule was the
capstone of these inventions, combining elements of the jenny with those
of the water frame (hence its name). The mule was a long machine with
two parallel carriages: Bobbins of roving (lightly twisted cotton
fibers) lined one side, and spindles ready to accept spun yarn lined the
other. The exterior carriage, mounted on wheels, was pulled out about
five feet, stretching multiple lengths of roving simultaneously. The
number of rovings spun depended on the number of spindles mounted to the
mule: Although two hundred was the norm in the 1790s, the number would
climb to more than thirteen hundred over the ensuing century. The
stretched roving was then twisted into yarn and wound onto the spindles
as the carriage was pushed back in. Unlike with the water frame, which
operated continuously, yarn was produced in five-foot bursts, but was
stronger and finer than yarn produced on water frames. The mule was
first powered by water (which remained the dominant source of power
until the 1820s), but later mostly by steam engines (which James Watt
patented in 1769).13</p>
<p>With spinning no longer a laggard, pressure shifted back to weaving.
First came a vast expansion of home-based weaving. With new machines and
an abundant supply of thread, this was a golden age for weavers all over
the Lancashire and Cheshire countryside, as tens of thousands of
cottagers spent endless hours on their looms working up the rapidly
increasing output of British spinning factories. While Edmund Cartwright
had patented a water-powered loom as early as 1785, productivity
improvements in weaving at first proved modest, and technical problems
with power looms great.14</p>
<p>Britain’s growing class of manufacturers, despite issues with looms,
were acutely aware that these new machines allowed them to increasingly
dominate the one node in the global cotton complex whose control had
eluded them: manufacturing. In eighteenth-century India, spinners
required 50,000 hours to spin a hundred pounds of raw cotton; their
cohorts in 1790 Britain, using a hundred-spindle mule, could spin the
same amount in just 1,000 hours. By 1795 they needed just 300 hours with
the water frame, or, with Roberts’s automated mule after 1825, only 135
hours. In just three decades, productivity had increased 370 times.
Labor costs in England were now much lower than in India.15</p>
<p>Prices for British yarn fell accordingly, and soon were lower than
those manufactured in India. In 1830, British cotton merchant Edward
Baines cited the price of one pound of Number 40 yarn (the number
reflects the quality of the yarn—the higher the number, the finer the
thread) in England as 1 shilling, 2.5 pence, while in India the same
quality and quantity of yarn would cost 3 shillings, 7 pence. Manchester
spinners McConnel andandandand Kennedy reported that the prices for its
high-quality 100-count yarn fell by 50 percent between 1795 and 1811,
and, despite various ups and downs, continued to fall further throughout
the nineteenth century. While yarn prices, especially of fine yarns,
fell the most rapidly, the cost of finished cloth also declined. A piece
of muslin in the early 1780s cost (in deflated prices) 116 shillings per
piece; fifty years later the same piece could be had for 28
shillings.16</p>
<p>The resulting boom in cotton manufacturing was unprecedented. After
nearly two centuries of slow growth in Europe, British cotton
manufacturing expanded by leaps and bounds. Between 1780 and 1800,
output of cotton textiles in Britain grew annually by 10.8 percent, and
exports by 14 percent; already in 1797 there were approximately nine
hundred cotton factories. In 1788, there had been 50,000 mule spindles,
but thirty-three years later that number had increased to 7 million.
While it had been cheaper to produce cotton cloth in India before 1780,
and its quality had been superior, after that year English manufacturers
were able to compete in European and Atlantic markets, and after 1830
they even began to compete with Indian producers in India itself. Once
Indians began using British-manufactured yarn and cloth, it signaled to
all that the world’s cotton industry had been turned on its head.17</p>
<p>As ever larger numbers of cotton factories began to dot northern
England to accommodate the new spinning and weaving machines, it might
come as a surprise that the inventors, who had enabled this departure,
had started in distinctly unspectacular ways. They created a world
radically different from anything ever seen before without recourse to
theoretical science, often even without much education. They were
skilled men in tiny workshops, with little formal education. Among the
inventors, Kay came from the most prosperous family, as his father was a
modestly successful woolens manufacturer. He might have received some
formal education in France. Hargreaves, on the other hand, was a
handloom weaver from Blackburn, who probably never had any formal
schooling—much like Arkwright, the youngest of seven children born to
poor parents, who learned how to read first from his uncles and then
educated himself. Crompton grew up in dire poverty: After his father
died, Crompton began to spin cotton, perhaps as early as age five, while
his mother tried to make ends meet by spinning and weaving. All four
were tinkerers, people who breathed and lived with their machines,
trying to solve practical problems with simple tools and insights that
emerged from their day-to-day efforts to improve production.18</p>
<p>But they were far from local heroes. Their innovations sometimes even
brought down the wrath of their neighbors, who dreaded the job losses
the innovators caused. Fear of mob violence drove Kay and Hargreaves
away from the places they had made their inventions. Neither translated
their inventions into wealth; after losing their efforts to defend their
patents, they lived modestly. When Hargreaves died in Nottingham in
1778, he owned little more than a prize from the Society for the
Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures, and his children were destitute.
Only Arkwright profited from his invention—establishing cotton factories
in numerous locations. Yet a rapidly growing number of British
manufacturers did embrace the new technologies, a British state valued
them so highly that it criminalized their export for nearly half a
century after 1786. From then on, technical progress became a constant:
Profits were made by increasing the productivity of human labor. This
would in fact become a defining feature of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>These new machines, the “macro inventions” celebrated by historians
Joel Mokyr, Patrick O’Brien, and many others, not only accelerated human
productivity, but also altered the nature of the production process
itself: They began to regulate the pace of human labor.19 Dependent on
central energy sources and requiring large spaces, production moved out
of the home and into factories. Along with the machines, workers
assembled in unprecedented numbers in central locations. While
putting-out merchants had traversed the countryside searching for
laborers, now workers sought out manufacturers in search of
employment.</p>
<p>The mechanization of cotton spinning created a novel entity: the
cotton mill. Although mills could vary tremendously in size, they shared
one attribute: a nearby source of running water. To harness its energy,
either a dam was constructed or an inlet was cut from a steep section of
river and diverted through a waterwheel. The waterwheel drove shafts
that ran through the length of the mill, upon which large leather belts
could be engaged or disengaged in order to run the various machines.
Unlike its predecessors, the mill’s primary function was not to simply
aggregate and control labor, but to house a complex array of machinery.
And by the 1780s, some mills were taking on gargantuan proportions; at
two hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, and four to six stories in
height, they dominated the surrounding countryside.20</p>
<p>Yarn production in these mills entailed three basic steps: willowing,
carding, and spinning. The first step had workers, generally women,
spread the raw cotton upon meshed tables and beat it with sticks to
remove any twigs, leaves, and dirt that the ginning had failed to
remove. Since the process pushed so much fire-hazardous cotton dust into
the air, it was often completed in adjoining buildings rather than
within the main mill complex. After the cotton was cleaned, a series of
machines centralized in the bottom floors of the mill would transform
the raw cotton into “roving,” a thin cord of lightly twisted, parallel
fibers ready to be spun. First, the cotton was fed into a carding
engine, a spinning cylinder covered in metal teeth fitted into a
similarly toothed casing. Through carding, a snarled mess of cotton was
turned into an untangled so-called sliver with the fibers running
parallel. The cotton was then fed into a draw frame, a set of rollers
through which the sliver was passed—stretching, twisting, and drawing
it—creating the roving. The cotton strand was then wound into a roving
can, from which it could be placed onto a bobbin. Finally, the cotton
was ready to be spun. Spinning machines were located across the top
floors of the mill, and the machines themselves usually took one of two
forms: Arkwright’s water frame or, increasingly, Crompton’s mule.21</p>
<p>To operate all this machinery and to move the cotton through the
factory, manufacturers hired hundreds of workers, most of them children
and women. And while not all workers arrived at the factory gates
voluntarily and received wages, the majority did. This was, as we will
see later, another important institutional innovation of industrial
capitalism. Outside the slave plantations of the Americas capitalists
for the first time organized, supervised, and dominated the production
process.22</p>
<p>Such domination of labor by capital, embrace of technological
revolution, and social innovation did not happen elsewhere, including in
the heart of the world’s cotton industry, China and India. This was in
some ways surprising, since for centuries manufacturing in these parts
of the world had defined the cutting edge of global cotton production
technology. Way back in 1313, Wang Zhen had written a description of a
“machine for spinning hemp thread” that came quite close to Hargreaves’s
spinning jenny and Arkwright’s water frame. Developing new spinning
machines was certainly within the grasp of Chinese artisans, or, for
that matter, their French or Indian counterparts. Moreover, trade in
cotton and cotton textiles was the most important facet of an increasing
commercialization of the Chinese economy between the fourteenth and
nineteenth centuries.23</p>
<p>Despite these promising preconditions, neither China nor India—nor,
for that matter, England’s closest European competitor in technical
education, Prussia—came close to dominating as many nodes within the
global cotton production complex as Britain. Nor did any other country
embrace war capitalism as effectively. Moreover, in India and China,
peasants were more secure on the land than their British counterparts,
making it more difficult for eager manufacturers to mobilize large
numbers of workers. Because of the different organization of households,
especially limitations on women’s outside activities, female-dominated
spinning had extremely low opportunity costs in India and China, making
the embrace of new technologies less likely. Women’s labor, in the
calculation of peasant households, was inexpensive. In India,
additionally, the chain between the weaver and the final consumer was a
long one, with many intermediaries. “To break out of this traditional
historical institution” proved difficult, as one historian has remarked,
and in the minds of many, of little advantage. Many spinners and weavers
in the English countryside likely felt similarly to their brethren in
India and China; they knew that newer spinning technology would make
their home-based manufacturing unsustainable. And yet with few other
means of earning income, and with their episodic efforts to organize
against the encroachment of technology defeated by a determined state,
they had little choice but to capitulate to industrial capitalism.24</p>

<p>Embracing new technologies, subduing labor without enslaving it, and
finding new ways to organize production emerged in cotton mills first,
and as a result the once modest industry scattered along the rivers of
Lancashire and neighboring Cheshire grew by leaps and bounds—around the
time of Greg’s construction of his first mill in 1784, new mills
blossomed, and in the decades thereafter existing mills expanded,
sometimes quite significantly. Greg himself employed 2,084 workers in
five mills in 1833, and the number of spindles at his Quarry Bank Mill
had quadrupled, to 10,846. In 1795, cotton manufacturer Robert Peel
expanded operations into twenty-three different mills, all owned and
managed by him. In other instances, new producers entered the industry,
often people with little capital but the right kinds of connections.
When Irish merchant William Emerson wanted to help a relative start a
spinning mill, he wrote to his business partners McConnel and Kennedy in
Manchester, informing them in a letter “that a relation of mine has a
desire to acquire a knowledge of Carding and Spinning, and for which
purpose, I wd willingly send him to you for Six Mo and pay you any
reasonable price for his instruction, you d be so good to say if you
could with convenience have him Instructed Either in your own House or
any other and on what terms.”25</p>
<p>As factories multiplied, many remained small and their owners were
often not wealthy by the standards of Liverpool merchants, Somerset
landowners, or London bankers. In 1812, 70 percent of all firms had
fewer than ten thousand spindles and were valued at less than £2,000.
The entrepreneurs who entered the industry came from a variety of
backgrounds. Many had been merchant-manufacturers, others manufacturers
in different industries, while others had started out as well-off
farmers, or even as apprentices with unusual mechanical abilities. There
were certainly examples of extraordinary social mobility, such as
Elkanah Armitage, who began work at a cotton factory at age eight as a
spinner’s helper and fifty-nine years later owned mills that employed
1,650 workers.26</p>
<p>Others, however, started with more substantial resources, such as
Samuel Oldknow, who was born in 1756 in Anderton, Lancashire. His father
already owned a successful muslin manufacturing operation worked
entirely by handlooms. Following his father’s premature death, Oldknow
was apprenticed to his uncle, a draper, before he returned to his
hometown in 1781 to rebuild the family muslin business. It was
auspicious timing. The introduction of the spinning mule in 1779 made
high-quality, mass-produced yarn available on an unprecedented scale,
allowing Oldknow to break into a market previously dominated by Indian
manufacturers. Oldknow also partnered with two London firms to secure
wide access to British and overseas markets. As he put it in a draft of
a 1783 letter, “The prospect is at present very propitious.” By 1786, he
was the most successful muslin manufacturer in Britain. Oldknow
continued to build mills and expand his enterprises, at one point
controlling some twenty-nine mills. By 1790, he was branching out into
spinning with the construction of a steam-powered factory in Stockport;
by 1793, an even larger six-story spinning mill in Mellor began
production.27</p>
<p>Cotton manufacturing, even if engaged in on a small scale, was
astonishingly profitable in the 1780s and 1790s. The firm of Cardwell
andandandand Birle had average annual returns on their capital of 13.1
percent, N. Dugdale 24.8 percent, and McConnel andandandand Kennedy 16
percent. Such profits allowed them to expand without much recourse to
formal capital markets. Indeed, “the favorite source of capital [for
expansion] was retained profits.” Yet such capital was often augmented
by merchants who invested in mills that they did not run themselves,
and, more important, by London and Liverpool merchants’ credit for the
purchase of raw cotton and the sale of yarn and cloth. This additional
working capital was crucial: While in 1834 fixed capital investments in
factories and machines in the British cotton industry may have amounted
to £14.8 million, working capital invested in raw cotton and wages
equaled £7.4 million—a very significant share. Access to such capital
rested often on personal connections, and as the need to secure
significant amounts of circulating capital increased, it became more
difficult for people outside the middle class to join the ranks of
cotton capitalists. High profits from production in turn made
manufacturing an ever more attractive field for further
investments.28</p>
<p>One example of the rapid growth of cotton mills was the Manchester
cotton manufacturers McConnel andandandand Kennedy. They founded their
partnership in 1791, focusing on the production of spinning machines, a
business that came naturally to machine maker James McConnel. One day,
however, McConnel produced two mules that his customer could not pay
for, and this seeming bad luck led him to begin using them himself. His
partner, John Kennedy, and two other investors expanded both the
production of machines and spinning, investing a total capital of £500,
an exceedingly modest sum. Calling themselves “machine makers and
spinners,” they expanded their mills rapidly, focusing on high-quality
yarns. In 1797 they operated 7,464 spindles; by 1810 the number of
spindles had increased to 78,972, while the number of workers they
employed grew from 312 in 1802 to 1,020 in 1816. Like others, they
financed that expansion out of retained profits, which had averaged 26.5
percent annually between 1799 and 1804.29</p>
<p>The growth of cotton manufacturing soon made it the center of the
British economy. In 1770, cotton manufacturing had made up just 2.6
percent of the value added in the economy as a whole. By 1801 it
accounted for 17 percent, and by 1831, 22.4 percent. This compared to
the iron industry’s share of 6.7 percent, coal’s 7 percent, and woolens’
14.1 percent. In Britain, as early as 1795, 340,000 people worked in the
spinning industry. By 1830, one in six workers in Britain labored in
cottons. At the same time, the industry itself became centered on a
small part of the British Isles: Lancashire. Seventy percent of all
British cotton workers would eventually labor there, while 80.3 percent
of all owners of cotton factories originated in that same county.30</p>
<p>The explosion of the cotton industry was not a flash in the pan.
Instead, as we will see, other industries would be made possible by the
rise of cotton: a railroad network, the iron industry, and later in the
nineteenth century a new set of industries that would amount to a second
industrial revolution. But cotton was the vanguard. As historian Fernand
Braudel has argued, the Industrial Revolution in cottons affected the
“entire national economy.”31 As late as the mid-nineteenth century, the
Industrial Revolution was still, numerically, the story of cotton.</p>
<p>The spectacular take off of the British cotton industry allowed
British capitalists—along with the British state—to retain even more of
the wages of war capitalism. With cheaper production costs thanks to the
unprecedented productivity of their new machines and the new
organization of production, with wage workers in large factories,
British manufacturers, as expected, broke into new markets. Domestic
markets expanded as cottons became cheaper and as cotton fabrics became
ever more fashionable as their changing designs mattered increasingly to
the self-presentation of middle-class consumers.32</p>
<p>British cotton manufacturers also moved decisively into the
all-important export market. By the 1780s, they came to sell in markets
that British merchants previously had served with Indian textiles. Fine
muslins that had been the pride of Bengal and “which for some thousands
of years stood unequalled” were henceforth produced in the United
Kingdom. This was clearly decisive, since the British market, with its
8.66 million people, was quite small, and per capita disposable income
grew only modestly. Over the course of the eighteenth century cotton
exports from Britain increased two hundred times—yet 94 percent of that
increase took place in the two decades after 1780, when exports exploded
by a factor greater than sixteen from their 1780 value of £355,060 to
£5,854,057 in 1800. By the last years of the eighteenth century, 61.3
percent of all cotton cloth produced on the British Isles was exported.
After 1815, thanks to these exports, England had indeed pretty much
“eliminated all rivals from the non-European world” in the global trade
of cotton yarn and cloth.33</p>
<p>The true boom of the British cotton industry was thus an export boom.
By 1800 British manufactured cottons had become a major presence on
world markets—and at the same time thousands of spinners and weavers in
newly built factories all over the English countryside, not to mention
hundreds of factory owners and merchants and seamen, were newly
dependent on such foreign markets. As Edward Baines observed in
amazement in 1835, cotton exports “at the present day…are three times as
large as the woolen exports,—having in so short a period outstripped and
distanced a manufacture which has flourished for centuries in England
and which for that length of time all writers on trade had justly
considered as the grand source of commercial wealth to the country.”
Indeed, such record trade in cottons influenced the entire British
economy: 56 percent of all additional British exports from 1784–86 to
1804–6 were in cottons.34</p>
<p>The export explosion: growth of British exports of cotton goods,
1697–1807 (illustration credit 3.5)</p>
<p>British cottons now rapidly replaced Indian cottons on world markets.
While in fiscal year 1800–1801, piece goods valued at £1.4 million were
still exported from Bengal to Britain, by 1809–10, only eight years
later, cloth exports had been reduced to just a bit more than
£330,000—and would continue to fall rapidly thereafter. As a result,
Indian weavers, who had dominated global cotton textile markets for
centuries, went into free fall. In 1800, commercial resident John Taylor
wrote a detailed history of the clothing industry of the Bengali city of
Dhaka and reported that the value of cloth exports there had fallen by
50 percent between 1747 and 1797. Spinners especially had been hurt by
British competition, and as a result a great number, he reported, “died
of famine.” The people of the once thriving manufacturing city had been
“reduced and impoverished,” its houses “ruined and abandoned,” and its
commercial history become “a melancholy retrospect.” The “ancient
celebrity” and “great wealth” of Dhaka were all but gone. By 1806,
another report on Bengali commerce concluded that “the exports of Piece
Goods on the public account, have also very considerably decreased…the
consequences are, that the weavers finding no employment for their
looms, many of them have been necessitated to quit their homes and seek
employment elsewhere; most of them take to the plough, some remain in
their own districts, while others migrate into distant parts of the
country.” One critic of the East India Company, observing that it seemed
the goal of British policy to make India into an importer of cotton
cloth and an exporter of raw cotton, found it “a policy similar to that
which Spain pursued towards the unhappy aborigines of America.”35</p>
<p>British cottons captured the multifaceted export markets formerly
controlled by Indian spinners and weavers, while manufacturers focused
at first on selling to parts of the world subject to war capitalism.
During the last decades of the eighteenth century, the heyday of the
Industrial Revolution, more than two-thirds of British cotton exports
went to such places. Exports flowed, in effect, within the same channels
of the Atlantic economy that Britain had spent two hundred years and
untold treasure building. Slaves on plantations in the Americas, unlike
agricultural producers elsewhere, did not produce their own clothing and
provided a uniquely rich market despite the low level of their masters’
provisioning. In the African trade—mostly in slaves—demand was just as
high (and even increasing, as a result of the cotton planting boom in
the Americas), as African merchants began to accept British-made cloth
as equivalent to Indian cloth in quality and price. After 1806, British
cottons were decisively dominating this market that had for so long
eluded them.36</p>
<p>The ability of merchants and manufacturers to access these markets
pointed to the importance of a peculiar and novel form of state, a state
that would be the crucial ingredient for industrial capitalism and would
eventually travel in quite peculiar patterns around the globe. After
all, cotton exports expanded on the strength of British trade networks
and the institutions in which they were embedded—from a strong navy
creating and protecting market access to bills of lading allowing for
the transfer of capital over large distances. This state was capable of
forging and protecting global markets, policing its borders, regulating
industry, creating and then enforcing private property rights in land,
enforcing contracts over large geographical distances, forging fiscal
tools to tax populations, and building a social, economic, and legal
environment that made the mobilization of labor through wage payments
possible.</p>
<p>As one perceptive French observer argued in the early nineteenth
century, “England has only arrived at the summit of prosperity by
persisting for centuries in the system of protection and prohibition.”37
Indeed, in the end, it was not so much the new machines that
revolutionized the world, impressive and important as they were. The
truly heroic invention was the economic, social, and political
institutions in which these machines were embedded. These institutions
came to further define industrial capitalism and increasingly set it
apart from its parent, war capitalism.38</p>
<p>The creation of such a state at the core of industrial capitalism was
a complicated dance between various interests. A rising group of
manufacturers pressed for a recognition of their interests, while
statesmen and bureaucrats came to understand that their own exalted
position in the world rested on Great Britain’s rapidly expanding
manufacturing capacity. Manufacturers fought competing interests—the
East India Company, for example—and competing elites, such as
aristocratic landowners. And as merchants and manufacturers accumulated
significant resources on which the state came to depend, these
capitalists could translate their growing importance to the national
economy into political influence.39 Cotton mill owners became
increasingly active politically, culminating in the 1832 Reform Act that
extended them the suffrage, allowing many textile entrepreneurs to move
into the House of Commons, where they strenuously lobbied for the
(global) interests of their industry, from the Corn Laws to British
colonial expansion.40 The argument of the manufacturers for policies
conducive to their interests was straightforward and strikingly modern,
as this 1789 petition of 103 cotton goods manufacturers from around
Glasgow to the Treasury shows:</p>
<p>That your Petitioners began early to Manufacture British Muslins, and
of late years have made great Progress in extending and improving this
valuable branch of Trade, as well as the other Articles denominated
Callicoes, and Mixed Goods. That the Power of Machinery applied on this
Manufactory, joined to the new Facilities, which a more extended
Practice has enabled your Petitioners to introduce, occasions a surplus
of Goods which the Home Consumption cannot exhaust: and therefore a
foreign Sale to a much greater extent becomes indispensably necessary,
in order to occupy the Machinery.41</p>
<p>Built by newly empowered manufacturers and a state with vastly
increased capacity, industrial capitalism found a very different answer
to the question of how to mobilize labor, capital, and markets compared
to its parent, war capitalism. Labor, unlike in the Americas, could be
mobilized because changes in the countryside, including legal changes,
had already produced a large group of landless proletarians who were
forced to sell their labor power to survive, and did so without being
physically coerced. Moreover, unlike for the plantation economy of the
Americas, the territorial needs of cotton manufacturing were limited and
focused mostly on accessing waterpower. As markets in land had emerged
centuries before, and property rights in land were relatively secure and
protected by the state, the land grab so typical of war capitalism did
not and could not emerge in Britain itself. At the same time, an
interventionist state was able to promote land uses deemed helpful to
general economic development, for instance by allowing expropriations
for the building of turnpikes and canals. Moreover, a highly centralized
and bureaucratic state regulated and taxed domestic industry.42</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most decisive for this early moment in the
emergence of industrial capitalism, the mechanisms of war capitalism
could be externalized thanks to the state’s imperial expansion, in
effect reducing capitalists’ need to recast the domestic social
structure and their dependence on domestic resources, ranging from labor
to food to raw materials. Some of the problems in the mobilization of
labor, raw materials, territories, and markets had indeed been solved by
war capitalism in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. And it was again a
strong state (a state fortified by the institutional and financial
accumulations of war capitalism) that was the root cause of the ability
to externalize some of the labor, land, and resource mobilization. This
state could in fact enforce different kinds of institutions in different
parts of the world, with slavery and wage labor coexisting, for
example.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, merchants, and statesmen constructed a new form of
capitalism—a capitalism that would dominate much of the world by the
late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The modern state at its core was sometimes less “visible” than
autocratic monarchical rule, and thus seemed “weaker” as its power was
increasingly embedded in impersonal rules, laws, and bureaucratic
mechanisms. Paradoxically, industrial capitalism made state power less
visible as it amplified it. No longer did the personal authority of the
king, the lord, or the master, or age-old custom, regulate the market;
instead the market was made by explicit rules relentlessly enforced by
contracts, laws, and regulations. Weaker states continued to rely on
client networks, the subcontracting of authority, and arbitrary
rule—characteristics that would not provide fertile ground for
industrial capitalism. And as European colonialism spread its tentacles
into ever more areas of the world, it further strengthened the state
capacity of the colonizers, while at the same time undermining political
authority and state capacity among the colonized. Just as state capacity
became ever more important, its distribution around the globe became
more unequal.</p>
<p>Tellingly, even though Edward Baines argued in 1835 that “this
[cotton] trade was not the nursling of government protection,” he
proceeded to list in chronological order all “interferences of the
legislature” that related to the cotton industry, from prohibitions to
tariffs—a list that would fill seven pages, a striking reminder of the
state’s importance to ensuring the “free” market of cotton.43 In Great
Britain and eventually in a few other states, this dependence of
capitalists on the state attached them firmly to one another and
resulted in a kind of territorialization and “nationalization” of
manufacturing capital. Ironically, that link between capitalists and the
state would eventually also empower workers, who could deploy the
state’s dependence on the consent of the governed to mobilize
collectively for higher wages and better working conditions.</p>
<p>It was also because of the awe-inspiring capacity of modern states
(what Hegel would call the “spirit of history”) that war capitalism’s
way of mobilizing land, labor, and markets would be largely irrelevant
within Europe itself. This is in many ways surprising. After all,
large-scale and capital-intensive enterprises, the mobilization of vast
numbers of workers, and the tight managerial supervision of those
workers had all been pioneered to great profit on the plantations of the
Americas and seemed to show the way toward the reorganization of
production. Yet in Britain itself, war capitalism provided only the
foundation, not the nature, of capitalism. To dominate production,
workers were neither enslaved nor populations murdered, for capitalists
were not fulfilling frontier fantasies beyond the reach of the state.
This was revolutionary, but in our world, in which the institutional
foundations of industrial capitalism have become commonplace, it is hard
to appreciate just how revolutionary it was.</p>
<p>And the relationship between the expansion of manufacturing and the
strengthening of the state was mutually reinforcing. Just as the British
state undergirded the economic dynamism of the cotton industry, that
industry’s many progeny became ever more important to the British state.
To fuel the wars of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
that established British hegemony in the Atlantic, according to Edward
Baines, Britain relied heavily on its commerce, and the most important
line of commerce was cotton: “Without the means supplied by her
flourishing manufacturers and trade, the country could not have borne up
under a conflict as prolonged and exhausting.” Cotton goods valued at
£150 million were exported between 1773 and 1815, estimated Baines,
filling the coffers of manufacturers, merchants—and the state. It was
the volume and balance of trade that provided the state the revenues it
needed to invest, for example, in expanded naval power in the first
place. State revenues indeed increased by a factor of sixteen between
the late seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries, as Britain
engaged in these years in a total of fifty-six years of warfare. And
fully one-third of tax revenues in 1800 came from customs. As the
Edinburgh Review remarked in 1835, “How great a degree of our prosperity
and power depend on their [manufacturers’] continued improvement and
extension.” State bureaucrats and rulers understood that manufacturing
was a way to produce revenue for the state, as the state itself now
rested on the industrial world it had helped create.44</p>
<p>The first, lurching stages of this great acceleration, as seen at
Quarry Bank Mill, might still have appeared modest. To modern eyes, the
new technologies seem quaint, the factories small, and the impact of the
cotton industry limited to a few regions in just one small part of the
world, while much of the globe, even much of Great Britain, continued as
before. The productive capacity of the first factories dotting the
English countryside, looked at from a global perspective, was indeed
minuscule. After all, Chinese spinners and weavers processed about 420
times as much cotton in 1750 as their counterparts in Britain in 1800,
and the numbers for India were similar.45 In 1800, two decades after
Greg’s midwifery to the Industrial Revolution, less than one-tenth of 1
percent of global cotton cloth production came from machines invented on
the British Isles. Yet once the social and institutional scaffolding of
industrial capitalism had been invented in a decades-long conflict
between capitalists, aristocrats, the state, workers, and peasants, it
could spread to other industries and other parts of the world. The
territory for further transformations was huge.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution, powered by cotton, was, as historian Eric
Hobsbawm has put it, “the most important event in world history.” It
created a world unlike any that had come before. “This land of long
chimneys,” as cotton manufacturer Thomas Ashton called it in 1837, was
not just different from the centuries-old world of the British
countryside, it was also a vast leap from the world of war capitalism
that merchants, planters, and state officials had forged over the
previous two hundred years. Its spectacle attracted visitors from all
over the world, simultaneously awed and horrified by the sheer scale of
it all: the endless chimneys, the chaotic cities, the spectacular social
transformations. An 1808 English visitor saw in Manchester a town that
was “abominably filthy, the Steam Engine is pestiferous, the Dyehouses
noisesome and offensive, and the water of the river as black as ink.”
Alexis de Tocqueville made that same pilgrimage in 1835 and saw a “sort
of black smoke [that] covers the city. The sun seen through it is a disk
without rays. Under this half daylight 300,000 human beings are
ceaselessly at work. A thousand noises disturb this damp, dark
labyrinth, but they are not at all the ordinary sounds one hears in
great cities.” However, Tocqueville added, it was “from this foul drain
[that] the greatest stream of human industry flows out to fertilise the
whole world. From this filthy sewer pure gold flows. Here humanity
attains its most complete development and its most brutish; here
civilisation works its miracles, and civilised man is turned back almost
into a savage.” Observers from the still pastoral United States were
terrified by this new Old World; Thomas Jefferson wished that his
compatriots would “never…twirl a distaff…let our workshops remain in
Europe.”46</p>
<p>Within Britain, and within two decades, cotton’s evolution was vast.
It began as one of the many spoils of imperial expansion, and became the
driving commodity behind the Industrial Revolution. From tufted white
bolls emerged a new global system: industrial capitalism. There was of
course inventiveness and innovation in other industries, but cotton was
the only one with a global scope, a strong connection to coercive labor,
and a unique level of the state’s imperial attention to capture the
necessary markets across the world.</p>
<p>Although industrial capitalism would eventually dominate the world,
in the immediate aftermath of its birth it helped to expand and sharpen
war capitalism elsewhere. That was because England’s lopsided lead in
the exploitation of industrial capitalism rested in the ability of its
merchants to secure ever more inexpensive and predictable supplies of
cotton for its factories.47 And while British cotton manufacturers quite
suddenly demanded huge new quantities of cotton, the institutional
structures of industrial capitalism were still too immature and
provincial to generate the labor and territory needed to produce all
this cotton. For a terrible ninety years, from about 1770 to 1860, as we
will see, industrial capitalism reinvigorated rather than replaced war

<p>In 1858, the president of the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson
Railroad Company, Richard B. Kimball, visited Manchester. His
observations are startling in their prescience: “As I entered your city,

some irresistible and mysterious force was at work. Need I say it was
the noise of your spindles and your looms, and of the machinery which
drives them?…. And I said to myself, what connection shall there be
between Power in Manchester and Nature in America? What connection shall
