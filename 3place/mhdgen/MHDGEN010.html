Global</h4>
<p>The ship Glad Tidings, loaded with American cotton, enters the port
of Liverpool, 1865. (illustration credit 8.1)</p>
<p>Among the most outstanding phenomena of modern times is undoubtedly
the annually progressing expansion of this gigantic business sector
whose impact on the material and social conditions of both hemispheres
emerges so evidently.…</p>
<p>While on the far side of the ocean significant and until recently
undeveloped tracts of land are transformed into fertile plains, enabling
an increasing population and expanding cultivation, they provide our
native land an inexhaustible source of national welfare, wages and
employment, utilize large capitals, and become the leverage of a
magnificent trade whose products will supply the markets of all the
zones, combining the most diverse activities transforming raw materials
into finished goods.</p>
<p>—Neue Bremer Zeitung, JANUARY 6, 18501</p>
<p>For Walter Benjamin, Paris was the capital of the nineteenth century.
For once and future cotton lords, however, the true center of the world
was Liverpool. Situated in England’s rainy northwest, the city rose from
the banks of the river Mersey and the Irish Sea. There, at one of global
commerce’s most significant crossroads, Liverpool’s merchants had
accumulated unprecedented wealth and influence by connecting a nascent
European manufacturing complex with an ever more martial and expansive
cotton hinterland. It was in Liverpool that industrial capitalism and
war capitalism met, its merchants applying the logic of the former to
the latter, and transforming both in the process. The genius of
Liverpool’s merchants lay in their ability to combine ingredients often
considered antagonistic: wage labor and slavery, industrialization and
deindustrialization, free trade and empire, violence and contract.</p>
<p>Liverpool may have been one of the wonders of the world, but not the
kind appreciated by tourists. Indeed, “hideousness” was the summation of
one early-twentieth-century chronicler. “The chief objects of attraction
in Liverpool are, decidedly, the spacious Docks,” observed a
contemporary dryly. As early as 1832 the docks and harbor walls
stretched for two and a half miles, dotted by quays, warehouses, and a
“forest of masts.” Beyond the Mersey lay the Irish Sea and beyond that
the Atlantic Ocean, and it was on that ocean’s western shores that most
of the world’s cotton was grown. Thousands of ships arrived each year,
burdened by tightly pressed cotton bales. Thousands of workers, many of
them Irish immigrants, unloaded the ships and brought the bales to
warehouses. From there most were shipped by canal boats and, after 1830,
train to the spinning mills in nearby Lancashire, twenty to fifty miles
distant, but some bales also went back on ships to various European
ports where first wagons and later trains fed the increasing number of
spinning mills dotting the European countryside. No technical marvel,
the port was first and foremost a site of perilous, backbreaking labor.
Thousands of workers assembled on the rainy streets of Liverpool each
morning before dawn, hoping to be hired for a day of handling huge bales
of cotton, dangerous work over long hours at low pay.2</p>
<p>Liverpool’s port was the epicenter of a globe-spanning empire. Its
merchants sent ships all over the world, mostly wind-powered, but by the
1850s and 1860s increasingly by steam as well. The captains of those
ships navigated perilous seas, rebellious crews, virulent diseases, and
economic volatility. Every time James Brown, captain of a Liverpool
cotton ship, arrived in the port of New Orleans in the early 1840s, he
wasted weeks in the struggle to find bales of cotton to fill his boat.
Shipping rates changed constantly, as idle boats in the port meant stiff
competition. Market news from Liverpool, as often as not, led to abrupt
changes in the price of cotton, delaying his departure. “Parts of the
crew have run away,” Brown wrote in one of many laments; “hurricanes”
and “reports of privateers” further frayed his nerves.3</p>
<p>While Liverpool’s port was a scene of stupendous muscular labor, the
nervous system of the city was its cotton exchange, whose caretakers
lived and worked in close proximity to one another. Every morning the
city’s merchants would meet to trade “on the flags,” an outdoor space in
the center of town. Cotton broker Samuel Smith remembered that “in all
weathers, cold and wet, winter and summer, we stood outside, sometimes
sheltering under the arches when the rain and cold were unendurable.”
Only after 1809, when a handsome exchange building was erected in the
center of town did the cotton merchants move inside. The sales room
where buyers met sellers in a noisy and seemingly chaotic dance was
striking, as “no place in the world affords so elegant and commodious a
situation as this is for the purposes of a public exchange,” with “sales
to a very considerable amount…effected in a few minutes.”4</p>
<p>Thanks to their all-embracing dispositions, the merchants of the city
became the ringmasters of a globe-spanning network of cotton growing,
crafting, and selling. On Bombay’s Apollo wharf, merchants nervously
awaited news “from Liverpool.” On plantations throughout the American
South, “Liverpool prices” were the single most significant piece of
news, bordering on obsession for many slave masters.5 The southern
agricultural journal De Bow’s Review constantly reported on Liverpool
prices and how U.S. cotton farmers could pocket a greater share of them.
New York’s Merchants’ Magazine and Commercial Review similarly agonized
over Liverpool prices. For Ellen Hootton and hundreds of thousands of
cotton mill workers like her, Liverpool prices would determine if she
would be employed or not. The global preoccupation with Liverpool
reflected the tremendous influence the city’s merchants enjoyed over
large swaths of the earth. When prices rose in Liverpool, planters in
Louisiana might decide to purchase fresh cotton lands, and slave traders
might find it profitable to move young slaves by the thousands into
these new territories. News from Liverpool might on one day help
dislodge Native Americans from their land, on another day encourage
investment in Indian railroads, and on another make a family in
Switzerland, Gujarat, or Michoacán give up spinning and weaving
altogether.6</p>
<p>The financial pulse of the empire of cotton: “Liverpool prices” on an
Alabama cotton plantation, 1842 (illustration credit 8.2)</p>
<p>Liverpool, like no other city, concentrated simultaneously on all the
core functions of the global cotton trade. Its merchants traded raw
cotton, shipped cotton goods, and financed both cotton agriculture and
cotton manufacturing. Other cotton cities were more specialized in their
activities. Merchants in New Orleans, Alexandria, and Bombay, for
example, mastered the export of raw cotton, while Bremen and Le Havre
merchants received their shipments. New York and London merchants
focused on financing the trade. And widely dispersed merchants in cities
from Buenos Aires to Recife, Hamburg to Calcutta received shipments of
yarn and cloth and distributed them through their hinterlands.</p>
<p>None of these cities, however, competed seriously with Liverpool. The
channels through which cotton flowed were not evenly distributed across
the world. They narrowed and widened at certain points, and the volume
and velocity of the flow was a direct expression of the distribution of
influence; the deeper and faster the network, the greater the power.
While Liverpool enjoyed a torrent of trade and information connecting it
to many places, hinterland towns in Mississippi or Buenos Aires saw but
a lazy, gentle flow to and from very few places. To be at the very
beginning or the very end of a “commodity chain” thus was usually a
position of relative weakness. The focus of the cotton network on one
city, Liverpool, led to new hierarchies of power—an innovative
development that replaced older cotton networks and older merchant
groups in cities such as Ahmedabad or Surat or Oaxaca. The rise of
Liverpool’s merchants at the turn to the nineteenth century further
moved a multipolar world of cotton into the direction of becoming
unipolar.</p>
<p>Seen from the cotton exchange at Liverpool, the world beyond its high
windows was essentially a huge cotton production and consumption
complex. The voracious appetite for profit demanded ever more lands for
the commercial production of cotton, the multiplying of cotton mills,
and the opening of cloth markets. This unprecedented and highly
leveraged industrial expansion depended for its survival on the
permanent transformation of the global countryside to mobilize ever more
labor and resources and provide markets. Yet despite the omnipresence of
Liverpool capital and its merchants, the nature of these connected
transformations looked radically different in the Black Forest, Bombay,
or Mississippi.</p>
<p>While Liverpool merchants stood at the heart of this new empire of
cotton, in fact constituted it, they were just one of many groups of
traders engaged in the global cotton trade. Jointly these traders
coordinated the efforts of the hundreds of thousands of slaves,
peasants, and planters growing cotton on farms big and small in many
different parts of the world. Jointly they connected those raw materials
to the thousands of manufacturers who purchased cotton for their
factories, manufacturers who in turn sent yarn and cloth to the markets
and shops that then sold these cotton goods to millions of consumers.
Merchants moved the fiber and cloth from a Mississippi planter or
Gujarati farmer to an Oldham or Zwickau spinner, from Manchester
manufacturers to the bazaar of Istanbul, from the factories of Mulhouse
to the dry goods merchants of New York. Merchants advanced capital to
allow Barbadian planters to grow cotton. They collected cotton from
numerous growers and prepared the bales for shipment. They dispatched
ships across the world’s oceans. They offered cotton to manufacturers
and transmitted market information from the bazaar to the factory, from
the factory to the port, and from the port to the plantation. And they
sold the yarn and fabric that came out of the ever more efficient
factories to ever more consumers all over the world. While sometimes
owners of plantations and factories, merchants were more often
independent intermediaries. They specialized not in growing or making,
but in moving. At great headwaters such as Liverpool, they constituted
the market; they were its visible hand.</p>
<p>The challenges of forging these ties were as vast as the potential
profits. Consider just one chain of links. For a planter in Mississippi
to provide cotton to a Manchester manufacturer, a local Mississippi
merchant, a so-called factor, had to first provide the planter with
credit to acquire slaves, land, and implements. This factor probably
drew on London or New York bankers for these resources. Once the cotton
had ripened, the factor would offer the cotton for sale to exporting
merchants in the port of New Orleans, who would sell it to importing
merchants in Liverpool, who would also provide insurance on the bales
and organize their shipment to Europe. Once in Liverpool, the importing
merchant would ask a selling broker, another type of merchant, to
dispose of the cotton. As soon as a buying broker found the cotton to
his liking, he would forward it to a manufacturer. The manufacturer
would work up the cotton, and then provide it to a merchant who would
organize its shipping to a representative in a distant port, for example
in Calcutta. Once there, the yarn would be sold to Indian merchants, who
would distribute it into the countryside, where it would eventually be
bought by an Indian weaver, who would sell it yet again to other traders
who would deliver it to the retail merchants in villages and towns. Thus
slave-grown Mississippi cotton manufactured into yarn in Lancashire
might be woven into a shirt somewhere in the Indian countryside. The
empire of cotton consisted of tens of thousands of such ties.</p>
<p>Merchants everywhere constituted these webs, built on credit, trade,
information, trust, social connections, and the never-ending search for
profit. The scope of the new cotton networks was unprecedented. Never
before had any industry connected the activities of so many growers,
manufacturers, and consumers across such vast distances. And as a
result, never before were merchants so desperately needed. The scale of
these networks created unprecedented problems of coordination. Neither
peasants nor plantation owners, nor even wealthy manufacturers, could
keep the channels upon which their livelihoods rested clear. The ability
of merchants to organize the radical spatial rearrangement of the
world’s most important manufacturing industry was as much of an
invention as the more corporal machines and novel labor organization
that dotted the globe by the 1850s.7 Their capital, and the
institutional structures of trade they forged, imbued large expanses of
the globe—from the newly industrializing villages and cities of Europe
to the plantations and farms of Mississippi and Gujarat—with the new
rhythms of industrial production. By bridging the seemingly unbridgeable
gap between the slave plantation and the factory staffed by wage
workers, they created modern capitalism.8</p>
<p>These merchants built the trade in cotton and cotton goods into one
of the most substantial of the nineteenth century. Between 1800 and
1860, the quantity of raw cotton traded between the United States and
Great Britain, by far the most important stream, grew by a factor of 38;
the (much smaller) quantity traded between the United States and
continental Europe increased during these same years by a factor of 138.
Egypt exported 14 times as much cotton in 1860 as it had in 1822.
Imports of cotton into France’s most important cotton port, Le Havre,
grew by nearly 13 times between 1815 and 1860. And along with the growth
of the raw cotton trade, the trade in manufactured cottons also
exploded: 350,448 pounds of yarn were exported from Britain in 1794; by
1860 that number had increased by a factor of 563. Other commodity
trades boomed during these years as well, but not in the same way;
coffee exports from Brazil, to cite just one example, increased seven
times between 1820 and 1860. But the major economies of the world
depended on the cotton trade: France’s single most important export
product was textiles, most made of cotton. Between 1800 and 1860, cotton
goods accounted for about 40 to 50 percent of the value of total British
exports. Raw cotton was also by far the most important export good of
the United States: In 1820, the value of U.S. cotton exports was some 2
million; leaf tobacco was valued at million, and wheat at less than
00,000. Cotton constituted about 31 percent of U.S. merchandise exports
by value. By 1860, the value of tobacco exports had doubled, and wheat
exports had increased by a factor of eight—but cotton had mushroomed
nearly nine times to 92 million. It now constituted nearly 60 percent of
the value of all merchandise exports. As merchants built the world’s
first truly global economy, cotton took center stage.9</p>
<p>Merchants, some of them dealers or brokers, and other agents, import
merchants, or factors, accurately judged that there were ample
opportunities for profits in this vast new trade. Distinct groups of
merchants reaped profits from each of the transactions necessary to
bring cotton from the plantation to the consumer.10 Commissions,
interest, and payment for services filled their coffers. Some grew
fabulously rich, the Rathbones in Liverpool, the Barings in London, the
Rallis in London, Bombay, and elsewhere, the Volkarts in Winterthur, the
Siegfrieds in Le Havre, the Wätjens in Bremen, the Forstalls in New
Orleans, the Browns in New York, the Cassavettits in Alexandria, and the
Jejeebhoys in Bombay prominent among them. Cotton underpinned the vast
wealth and power of these families, allowing them to build mansions
staffed by large numbers of servants, collect precious artworks, invest
in other businesses, and travel the world. But thousands upon thousands
of less wealthy cotton merchants, whose names have largely been
forgotten, peopled the trade as well. Collectively, they forged new
spaces of capital.</p>
<p>For the marriage between slavery and industry to succeed, however,
merchants had first to profitably transmit the patterns of machine
production and industrial capitalism into the global countryside. The
world had no shortage of big dreamers before the nineteenth century, but
heretofore no one had been able to realize the potential of the
productive hinterlands and vulnerable consumer markets over such great
expanses. The process through which these merchants did so was
exceedingly complicated—indeed, it rested on a network of actors whose
field of vision was often, though not always, quite provincial, and who
at times did nothing more than move the logic of industrial capitalism
one step closer to rural cotton producers. By merely connecting various
places and stages in the process of cotton manufacturing to one another,
however, the merchants, often unwittingly, created something quite new.
For the first time in history, they drew upon the full diversity of
labor regimes, a hallmark of the emerging capitalism—slaves growing
cotton, wage workers manufacturing yarn, and slaves as well as wage
workers ginning, pressing, loading, and moving cotton bales. In doing
so, they helped Europe overcome its resource constraints. Watching these
merchants in action, in all their mundane and seemingly inconsequential
activities, helps us solve the puzzle of how industrial and war
capitalism came to be connected.</p>
<p>Considering their importance in forging the world of modern
capitalism, the actual work of merchants seems often almost banal. Most
of their time was spent writing letters, talking to suppliers and
customers, traveling, and making calculations. Because the empire of
cotton they created was so vast, merchants soon specialized in specific
aspects of the trade. Some focused on moving cotton from plantations to
ports, others on transoceanic trade; some concentrated on selling raw
cotton to manufacturers, while others speculated in exporting cotton
goods, and others distributed imported cotton goods throughout a
particular country or region. Usually merchants focused their trade on a
particular region, becoming experts on connecting certain parts of the
world to one another. Consequently, they had businesses that could look
surprisingly different from each other. The global system, in effect,
was built not from a central, imperial directive, but rather by myriad
actors with local and diverse connections often solving very local
problems.</p>
<p>The most urgent problem merchants helped solve was how to supply
manufacturers with raw cotton. As the scale and efficiency of the
industry increased, and as cotton did not grow anywhere near the
factories, manufacturers needed help securing ever greater supplies from
the remote reaches of the world. During the 1760s, 1770s, and 1780s,
most purchased this cotton from dealers located in the spinning
districts themselves, dealers who traded on their own accounts and
provided credit to the manufacturers to enable them to purchase it.11 In
1788, the city of Manchester, for example, counted twenty-two such
dealers. The dealers, in turn, bought the cotton from Liverpool
merchants who, in the eighteenth and even early nineteenth centuries,
were still mostly general merchants for whom cotton was only one of a
number of commodities they had on offer.</p>
<p>Yet as the quantity of cotton traded increased dramatically in the
first few decades of the nineteenth century, and as manufacturers’
demands on the quality and price of the cotton they received changed,
cotton manufacturers left this almost quaint world behind. Instead of
purchasing cotton from dealers, they began to use brokers. Brokers, in
contrast to the dealers, did not take possession of cotton; they instead
charged a commission for brokering trades between importing merchants
and manufacturers. As a result, mill owners could purchase not just the
cotton that their dealers happened to own, but any of the cotton
available in the port of Liverpool—getting the quantities and qualities
they desired at the cheapest possible price. Brokers provided a more
direct connection between manufacturers and cotton-importing merchants,
and also organized the market by setting rules and regulations,
distributing information, and providing elaborate arbitration services.
They “brought to Liverpool the technical knowledge of the industry,”
argues one scholar, and “they also brought a new kind of administrative
skill and efficiency to deal with the problems of what was, virtually, a
new trade.” As a result, brokers “became central figure[s] in the
market.” Expert both in the new technical requirements of spinning and
in the bewildering Liverpool market, they helped manufacturers to
navigate the varieties of cotton available in Liverpool and acquire the
cotton qualities they needed for specific manufacturing processes.12</p>
<p>By 1790 four such specialized cotton brokers had emerged in
Liverpool. Many others followed, and by 1860, 322 brokers walked the
streets of that city. They generally operated as small family firms and
came from a variety of backgrounds: some were former dealers, others had
been spinners, and still others had worked as import merchants.
Eventually, brokers specialized even further. Some became buying
brokers, purchasing cotton for manufacturers, and others selling
brokers, selling cotton for importing merchants.13</p>
<p>Thanks to these changes, manufacturers removed themselves from the
inspection of cottons in the market. While early in the century
manufacturers had personally touched the cottons on sale, they now
communicated their needs to brokers who then searched out the cotton
they wanted. Ever more specialized in the production of particular
qualities of yarns and goods, and demanding ever greater varieties of
cotton, manufacturers found going into market to purchase all that
cotton impossible. They depended on a constant flow of the crucial raw
material into their factories, and brokers guaranteed that supply.</p>
<p>As brokers replaced dealers, they also changed the way cotton was
sold. Again, the needs of machine production dictated these changes.
Throughout the eighteenth and well into the first half of the nineteenth
century, cotton had been traded as a physical commodity. Merchants
bought and sold specific sacks of cotton, dealing with a bewildering
variety of different cottons from different parts of the world that had
varying staple lengths, colors, elasticity, and cleanliness. As
merchants sold specific lots in specific sacks, they in effect allowed a
purchaser to trace back each particular parcel of cotton to a particular
producer. The 1814 records of cotton broker George Holt show him selling
“13 Bags (of cotton) waste Guinam,” “6 Bags Barbadoes,” “10 Bags Paras,
15 bags Bahis, 25 bags Dyneraras, 10 bags South Island,” and unspecified
amounts of further varieties such as “Bengal,” “Surat,” “Bourbons,”
“Demarara,” and “Pernam.” As Liverpool cotton broker Thomas Ellison
observed in 1886, “Down to the opening of the present century the usual
practice was for the seller to give to the buyer the marks, ship’s name,
and place of storage of any lot or lots of cotton which he might have
for sale, in order that the buyer might go to the warehouse and examine
the bales for himself.” The enormous natural variety of cotton was thus
preserved in the trade, and all participants in that trade dealt in
cotton that they had seen and touched.14</p>
<p>When the trade in cotton exploded in the first decades of the
nineteenth century, this system came under strain. Brokers hurried
around the port of Liverpool inspecting hundreds of bags and bales,
trying to match specific lots of cotton to the needs of specific
manufacturers—manufacturers who needed particular qualities to produce
particular kinds of yarn. Soon this became all but impossible. Pushed by
manufacturers’ needs, brokers sought new institutional solutions. First,
they moved from physically inspecting each sack of cotton to buying by
sample.15 A small batch of fiber was drawn from each bale and on the
basis of that sample a price was determined and a sale effected. These
samples, unlike the bales themselves, could easily be carried around and
even mailed. In a second step, brokers developed clear standards and a
precise vocabulary for cotton; eventually, manufacturers would acquire
cotton without even inspecting samples. They would, in effect, not order
a particular bale of cotton from a particular place, but a particular
quality. This was a radical recasting of the trade.</p>
<p>Cotton shows enormous variability in grade, staple, and character. As
of 1790, no attempt at grading cottons had been made, even though grades
already existed for other commodities, such as sugar and coffee, for
which categories such as “middling” and “good ordinary” were widely
used. In 1796, in Charleston, “Georgia cotton” and upland cotton were
mentioned for the first time as discrete categories, and in 1799 in
Philadelphia, note was made of “Georgia Tennessee cotton”—categories
that still reflected place of origin. That year, the Dictionnaire
universel de la géographie commerçante still listed diverse cottons only
by where they were grown. In 1804, however, Charleston merchants listed
“common cotton,” a category that by 1805 had become “common upland.” By
1805, Sea Island cotton was graded into prime, good, fair, middling, and
inferior grades. The Tradesman spoke in 1809 of “good middling cotton”;
in 1815 in the New Orleans market the designation “prime” was used, two
years later “first quality” cotton was listed, and another year later
“middling cotton” appeared in Charleston, followed in 1822 by “choice
prime cotton” in New Orleans and “choice fair” in 1823. The London
Magazine mentioned these categories by 1820, a decade during which they
came into widespread use. These categories were still approximations
that could neither be precisely defined nor enforced, but they formed
the foundation upon which later enforceable standards would be built.
Without such standards, such a high-volume long-distance trade of bulk
commodities would have been all but impossible—the vast diversity of
nature had to be distilled and classified to make it correspond to the
imperatives of machine production.16</p>
<p>For standards to work over the long term, purchasers had to be able
to verify the quality of the cotton they had purchased. At first these
rules and regulations were informal, conventions not written down but
personally understood. As trading by sample increased in volume and
expanse, traders in far-flung ports and manufacturers demanded rules
with “some sense of permanence”—standards protected by institutions. In
response, brokers created the Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association in
1841. One of the first things the Association did was to pass a
resolution that all cotton sold by sample was warranted to contain such
quality. By 1844, they had defined standards for “fair” and “middling”
cotton. In 1846, the American Chamber of Commerce in Liverpool, founded
in 1801 by Liverpool merchants trading with the United States, suggested
that the brokers “cause samples of the several classes of American
Cotton to be taken, to be placed at the disposal of the American Chamber
so as to form a standard for reference in all questions as to quality of
cotton.” Increasingly, the cotton market was no spontaneous interaction
of utility-maximizing individuals, but a set of institutions forged
outside the market itself.17</p>
<p>Once standards were formalized, efforts emerged to apply them
internationally. In 1848 the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce wrote to
the American Chamber of Commerce in Liverpool about the “great
inconveniences which have hitherto frequently attended the operations of
the purchasers of Cotton in New Orleans for want of a fixed standard of
quality uniform with that of Liverpool and recognized as such by the
Trade in both ports.” It proposed to create mutual standards for “fair
middling andandandand ordinary cotton, both New Orleans and Alabama.”
These duplicate standards would then be kept in New Orleans and
Liverpool, to adjudicate disputes. The American Chamber of Commerce in
Liverpool obliged and voted to create such standards. A modern cotton
market was now emerging as the result of collectively articulated
conventions, with a private association of Liverpool merchants at its
core. Capital was changing the way the cotton plant itself was seen—it
would soon change the plant itself. In such subtle ways, the unrelenting
pressure of capital-intensive factory production moved closer to the
growing of cotton itself, forcing the logic of capital upon the logic of
nature.18</p>
<p>Cotton standards emerged hand in hand with, and indeed enabled,
another invention: a trade in cotton that had not yet arrived. For a
futures market to work, information and samples had to travel faster
than bulk cotton itself, something that seems to have emerged in the
1810s in Liverpool. By 1812, cotton brokers had begun to trade in cotton
while it was still on the high seas, exchanging so-called “bills of
lading”—documents certifying ownership of certain bales of cotton. Two
years later, on August 13, 1814, George Holt sold to George Johnston
andandandand Co. one hundred bags of cotton “to arrive” from Amelia
Island in ten days. Such trade in the future delivery of cottons
increased throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1858,
the American Chamber of Commerce in Liverpool explicitly regulated such
“to arrive” contracts. This was the moment in which, according to the
Baring house in Liverpool, the “hypothecation of shipping documents”
began. And not just in Liverpool: Such “to arrive” contracts were also
used in the American South by New York merchants before 1860, and in Le
Havre, where merchants created ventes à livrer contracts as early as
1848. But there and elsewhere, these contracts were still exceptional,
and as late as the 1850s cotton broker Samuel Smith observed that
“nearly all the business was bona-fide transfers of cotton in warehouse,
and it was quite an exception to sell a cargo afloat.”19</p>
<p>Moreover, during the first half of the nineteenth century selling
cotton for future delivery was still based on the eventual delivery of a
particular parcel of cotton. George Holt had promised in 1814 to deliver
particular bags of cotton to Johnston, his customer, not just a certain
quality. Yet gradually the connection between a particular contract and
a particular batch of cotton began to weaken. Cotton began to be sold
that had not yet been shipped, indeed that would only come onto the
market in distant months, and might not even have been planted yet.20
This further abstraction of the trade would blossom during the American
Civil War, when true futures dealings came about. The quantifiable,
steady, and ongoing demands of mechanized production encouraged an ever
greater abstraction of its essential raw material inputs, protecting
manufacturers against price fluctuations and enabling them to price
their finished goods across global markets.</p>
<p>The chain from factory to plantation, however, had many more links.
Liverpool’s brokers communicated the needs of manufacturers to another
powerful group of cotton traders: the import merchants. In contrast to
the brokers, these merchants engaged in transoceanic trade of cotton,
handling goods on an incomparably larger scale, with opportunities for
profit proportionally greater. In Liverpool and its French competitor,
Le Havre, merchants specializing in cotton importation had emerged as
early as the late eighteenth century, to be followed in the nineteenth
century by merchants in Bremen. They focused on purchasing cotton abroad
or, more typically, shipping it for a commission (rather than taking
ownership of the cotton) from distant ports to Europe.21 They, more than
any others, directly connected rural producers with the most dynamic
manufacturing sector the world had ever known. At first, they helped
slavery blossom in Louisiana and Brazil, but later they would enable
peasant producers in India to grow cotton for transoceanic markets, and
allow Muhammad Ali’s domination of Egyptian peasants to turn into
profit.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s merchants were far and away the world’s most important
cotton importers. By the mid-1700s they had brought the first cotton to
Liverpool; by 1799, a full 50 percent of all British cotton imports
arrived there (most of the rest went to London), and by the late 1830s
that proportion had grown to 89 percent. Liverpool’s merchants cornered
the global cotton market in ways few merchants ever have. They succeeded
for several reasons. Initially, Liverpool’s central position in the
Atlantic slave trade set it up well for trade in cotton. Cotton
initially arrived, along with sugar, tobacco, and other goods, as return
freight from the West Indies—one of the sides of the triangular trade.
Liverpool may have controlled up to 85 percent of the British slave
trade, and by its 1807 abolition as much as one-quarter of Liverpool
shipping was in slaves; everyone who worked the city’s ports, therefore,
was experienced with long-distance trade, and also with the
cotton-growing regions of the Americas. And, as cotton increasingly came
across the Atlantic rather than the Mediterranean, Liverpool was well
situated to capitalize. The city also benefited from its location near
the spinning districts in and around Manchester, a connection that
rapidly improved thanks to the building of canals, improvements on the
river Mersey, and eventually, in 1830, the arrival of the world’s first
railroads. With such connections in place, Liverpool could benefit from
the institutional innovations created by its traders.22</p>
<p>The most powerful and wealthiest of Liverpool’s merchants engaged in
the cotton trade. A careful study of the Liverpool cotton import trade
has found that in 1820 fully 607 merchants traded cotton. Yet the same
study also established that the number of merchants who imported cotton
regularly (more than six times a year) was small, 120 in 1820, and 87 in
1839. The import trade was therefore composed of a very large number of
merchants who traded small quantities of cotton occasionally, and a few
merchants who regularly traded large numbers of bales. Yet as margins
fell in the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the merchant
community consolidated. In 1820, the leading ten cotton merchants had
imported 24 percent of all cotton into Liverpool, and the top thirty
cotton importers had imported a total of 37 percent. Nineteen years
later, the leading ten traders brought in 36 percent of all cotton and
the leading thirty a full 60 percent. That year, 1839, the largest
importer of cotton into Liverpool sold more than fifty thousand
bales.23</p>
<p>While the majority of traders continued importing small quantities of
cotton along with other commodities, Liverpool’s major cotton traders
reaped tremendous rewards by specializing and intensifying their cotton
trade. The Rathbone family, one of the city’s prime cotton traders, had
moved into the cotton trade in the eighteenth century (they supplied
Samuel Greg when he opened Quarry Bank Mill), at first adding to and
later superseding their older timber, salt, and tobacco trade. Indeed,
they were perhaps the first Liverpool firm to receive U.S.-grown cotton.
They shipped cotton throughout the first decades of the nineteenth
century, and by the 1830s wholly specialized in it. Like many other
merchants, they acquired this cotton through agents in southern ports of
the United States who had purchased it on the Rathbones’ account or who
sent it to them on a commission basis. The profits were large: In the
years from 1849 to 1853, the Rathbones earned £18,185 from the cotton
trade, in the years 1854 to 1858 they made a full £34,983—at a time when
a physician might earn £200 a year. The cotton profits of just five
years could finance the construction of a huge and fully furnished
English country manor; as the nineteenth century wore on, more and more
such stately homes dotted Liverpool’s countryside.24</p>
<p>The Rathbones’ trajectory from their earlier trade in other
commodities into cotton was typical of the major nineteenth-century
transcontinental cotton merchants. But there was another path into the
cotton trade. Those whose wealth or skills did not originate in trade
itself saw cotton as a promising way to diversify. So spectacularly
profitable was the cotton trade that all but a few of the major
capitalists of the era sought to gain a footing—bringing with them
significant amounts of capital. The Baring family, most notably, made
such a move. Along with the Rothschilds, the Barings were Europe’s most
powerful bankers, and just like the Rothschilds, the Barings forged an
important connection to cotton during the first half of the nineteenth
century. They also had a long-standing relationship to the United
States, not least because they had facilitated that expanding slave
power’s purchase of Louisiana from the French.</p>
<p>The Barings had begun investing in the cotton business as early as
1812, when they advanced £6,000 to New Orleans merchant Vincent Nolte to
start a cotton export house. Thanks to this capital influx, Nolte’s
“position in the cotton market now became, step by step, more
influential,” and by the 1820s he traded sixteen thousand to eighteen
thousand bales per season. When Francis Baring visited Nolte in the
early 1820s to check on his investments, he was, according to Nolte,
“evidently gratified when he took his first walk along the so-called
Levee…and saw it strown [sic], from the upper to the lower suburb, with
cotton bales, on which were stamped the marks of my firm.” Nolte failed
in 1826, however, and the Barings in consequence added an American agent
to their operations, Thomas Ward in Boston, to enforce tighter controls
over their American investments.25</p>
<p>Under Ward’s watchful eye, the Barings’ London-based cotton business
grew rapidly, so much so that by 1832 they had opened an office in
Liverpool. Step by step, they built a globe-spanning system of
information collecting and trading whose epicenter was Liverpool. It was
there that they collected information on the globe’s raw cotton
supplies, cotton manufacturing, and cotton goods consumption and then
translated it into orders to Thomas Ward, who then made arrangements
with commission houses in New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah,
Mobile, and New Orleans. The Barings also took shares—that is, they
purchased particular lots of cotton forwarded by other commission
houses. Funds for both advances and purchases were provided by drafts on
Baring Brothers andandandand Company. It was this credit, wielded by
merchants like the Barings, that made the brutality of war capitalism
more and more efficient, and thus made industrial capitalism more and
more profitable.26</p>
<p>Riding this wave of activity, in 1833 the Barings became the fifth
largest importer of cotton, and between 1839 and 1842 they ascended to
the largest, the firm whose “motions are watched” by their competitors.
In fiscal year 1839–40 alone, for example, they imported 104,270 bales
of cotton—the annual labor product of at least seventy thousand
slaves.27</p>
<p>The operations of the Barings, like those of the Rathbones, dwarfed
those of most of their colleagues—not just in Liverpool, but even more
so in Europe’s other emerging cotton ports. Still, important cotton
merchants emerged elsewhere, catering to the needs of other national
cotton industries. On the northern German coast, Bremen rose to
prominence during the first half of the nineteenth century as a cotton
trading center. The first sacks of cotton landed in 1788; by 1829,
Bremen’s port counted six merchants trading in cotton, and by 1845 the
Bechtel, Vietor, Delius, Meier, Hagendorn, Gildemeister, and Fritze
families collectively imported 18,498 bales.28</p>
<p>Bremen, unlike Liverpool, did not have a thriving cotton industry in
its own hinterland, with most of its cotton imports shipped to
manufacturers hundreds of miles away in such places as Saxony and
southern Germany. What Bremen had was human ties to the United States.
Indeed, Bremen’s cotton trade emerged largely as return freight in the
holds of ships that had brought European immigrants to the United
States. The Bremen cotton merchants of D. H. Wätjen andandandand Co. in
January 1852 sent their ship Albers from New Orleans to Bremen loaded
with cotton, brought immigrants to New Orleans in April, then returned
with cotton to Bremen in June. It sailed once more with immigrants to
New Orleans in September, before bringing tobacco to London in November.
The Bremen cotton trade demonstrated the symbiosis between the export of
continental Europe’s surplus labor and the import of agricultural
commodities. Globalization increasingly fed upon itself.29</p>
<p>More significant than the Bremen merchants were their counterparts in
Le Havre. Situated on the Norman coast of northwestern France, it was
continental Europe’s most important cotton port in the first half of the
nineteenth century, and supplier to the French, Swiss, and western
German industries. In 1830 port workers, as underpaid and overworked as
their counterparts in Liverpool, unloaded 153,000 bales, and in 1860,
600,000—accounting for 89 percent of all cotton imports into France.
Cotton became as central to Le Havre as it had become to Liverpool. Le
Havre’s central position in the European cotton trade built, like
Liverpool’s, on its earlier role in the East India and slave trade, and,
like Bremen’s, on its role as a major port of embarkation for European
migrants to the United States.30</p>
<p>As in Liverpool, a growing number of merchants plied the cotton trade
in Le Havre; 279 competed for business in 1835. Like their Liverpool
counterparts, they operated on a global scale. Jules Siegfried, for
example, one of Le Havre’s major traders, was born into a family of
cotton printers in Mulhouse and learned the business not just in his
father’s firm in Le Havre, but also via apprenticeships in Manchester
and Liverpool. In 1859, his brother Jacques opened a cotton house in New
Orleans, eventually turning the firm into the transatlantic Siegfried
Frères, with the partners traveling frequently between France and the
United States. As in Liverpool, Le Havre cotton merchants infused the
trade in raw cotton with the rhythm of machine production.31</p>
<p>Jules Lecesne, another French merchant, was even more globetrotting.
Trained in England, New York, and Boston, he founded his first
cotton-export firm in Mobile, Alabama, in 1840 (a move also made by some
Bremen merchants, who settled temporarily in southern towns to get
access to cotton and expertise). Ten years later, he created a firm in
New Orleans, under the name Jules Lecesne Frères et Cie, in 1851 an
agency in Galveston, in 1854 one in New York, in 1857 one in Paris, and
in 1858 one in Manchester, all linked to a house in Le Havre. Eventually
he had agents working for him in a remarkable range of cities, among
them Galveston, New Orleans, Mobile, New York, Havana, Cork, Glasgow,
Manchester, Liverpool, Paris—and, of course, Le Havre. He became Le
Havre’s major cotton importer and supplier of the Alsatian industry,
bringing in a full 22 percent of that city’s cotton imports in
1860.32</p>
<p>As the nineteenth century progressed, European import merchants—the
people who shipped cotton across oceans—faced competition from what
would have seemed, early in the century, a most unlikely quarter: the
United States of America. In New York, but also in Boston and elsewhere,
cotton traders emerged who would come to play an increasingly important
role both in the transatlantic cotton trade and in the supply of
American cotton mills.</p>
<p>REIMAGINING THE GLOBAL COUNTRYSIDE</p>
<p>Jules Siegfried (illustration credit 8.3)</p>
<p>Francis Baring (illustration credit 8.4)</p>
<p>One American firm, Brown Brothers, would eventually join the ranks of
the world’s most important cotton merchant houses. The Browns were
immigrants from Ireland. Alexander Brown founded a modest linen business
in 1800 in Baltimore, then branched out into the cotton trade. As part
of this diversification, Alexander sent his son William to Liverpool in
1810 to open a house for the importation of American cotton and the
export of cotton goods. He sent his other sons to other port cities.
Most important of all, in 1825 son James went to New York, with the goal
of promoting “the interest of Messrs. William andandandand James Brown
andandandand Co., of Liverpool, and of affording greater facility, and
the choice of markets, to our southern friends who are disposed to
give…us their business.” By the 1820s, Brown Brothers was among the
largest cotton traders between the United States and Liverpool.33</p>
<p>From the 1820s to the 1850s, Brown Brothers involved itself in all
aspects of the southern cotton trade. The firm offered cotton growers
and factors in the South advances on future crops. It arranged shipping
to Liverpool; indeed, the Browns themselves owned a number of ships. It
provided insurance on cotton in transit. It sold huge quantities of
cotton on commission (typically, Brown would advance about two-thirds of
the market value of cotton on these consignments), procured from
factors, including its own agents in the ports of New Orleans, Mobile,
Savannah, and Charleston. Even though the Browns favored the less risky
commission business, at times they bought cotton outright and shipped it
to Liverpool for sale. In addition, and ever more important, the Browns
provided credit and exchange facilities (converting various currencies)
to southerners to enable them to trade crops grown by slaves. In the
1830s they advanced 00,000 to New Orleans cotton traders Martin
Pleasants andandandand Co., and a 00,000 line of credit to the New
Orleans banking house of Yeatman Woods andandandand Co. They also moved
capital into a variety of southern banks, among them the Planters’ and
Merchants’ Bank in Mobile, Alabama, and the Merchants’ and Traders’ Bank
of Mississippi. The Browns made themselves central to the global cotton
economy and so they became rich. In the flush times of the early 1830s,
it has been estimated, Brown Brothers made profits of more than 00,000
per year—enough to buy thirteen one-hundred-foot yachts, or thirteen
hundred carriages.34</p>
<p>These activities allowed the Brown family to capture a significant
share of the global cotton trade, anticipating the rising importance of
American merchants in the late-nineteenth-century empire of cotton.
William Brown’s share of cotton imports into Liverpool amounted to 2.8
percent in 1820, and 7.3 percent in 1839, putting him among the top ten
importers of cotton in the world’s largest cotton port. In 1838, his
brother James in New York handled 178,000 bales of cotton, equaling 15.8
percent of total U.S. cotton exports to the United Kingdom. The Browns
would later channel some of their fabulous wealth into railroads, banks,
and industrial ventures, and cultural institutions including the Museum
of Natural History in New York. Through such diverse investments, the
wages of plantation slavery and land expropriation were inscribed within
economic and cultural institutions that endured well beyond abolition in
1865.35</p>
<p>Whether in New York or Le Havre, Bremen or Liverpool, the vast
majority of the cotton acquired and shipped by these merchants came from
territories conquered by force and cultivated by slave labor—first the
West Indies and Brazil, eventually the southern United States. Indeed,
merchants built particularly dense connections to these apparently
remote, rustic, and thinly developed parts of the world. Strikingly,
territories dominated by slave labor, in contrast to so many
long-settled cotton lands in South Asia and Africa, proved to be
uniquely malleable by European capital and capitalists, and particularly
adaptable to the patterns of machine production.</p>
<p>Merchants’ most significant tool in building these connections was
capital in the form of credit. Credit was the magic wand that allowed
merchants to recast nature, clear lands, remove native inhabitants,
purchase labor, produce crops in definite qualities and quantities, and
meet the voracious appetites of manufacturers and their modern cotton
machinery. For the time being, these essential steps turned out to be
much more difficult, if not impossible, in the absence of slave
labor.</p>
<p>The ultimate success of these merchants came not only from their
ability to organize complex transactions and transport a bulk commodity
over very large distances but from their ability to infuse the rhythms
of industrial production into the countryside. As any perusal of a
plantation account book reveals, European credit was essential to
planters’ ability to purchase ever more land and ever more slaves and
hold them from one harvest season to the next. Less obviously, but more
important, was the way the money market in London insinuated the logic
of industrial capitalism among the planters. This is how New Orleans
cotton merchant W. Nott described the link: When in 1829 Thomas Baring
gave W. Nott andandandand Co. in New Orleans a 0,000 line of credit,
Nott in turn was able to advance money to the “Planters of Tennessee
against their Drafts on their Factors here in anticipation of the
Proceeds of their growing Crops—Drafts which are generally accepted, on
the faith of the Planters promise to ship their Crops, when ready, 8, 10
or even 12 months before the Property comes into the acceptors hands.”
Such a transaction, he continued, was relatively safe because of “the
intimate knowledge possessed by J. W. andandandand Co. of every
Planter’s standing andandandand character, andandandand the constant
residence of at least one of the Planters in Nashville…in advancing the
approximate value of 25 to 30,000 bales of Cotton in a season—as they
are supposed to—their reliance is not on the signature of the Factor who
is perhaps not good for a fiftieth part of the sum, but on the Planters’
punctuality in forwarding his crop to such Factor in time to meet the
Draft.”36</p>
<p>Beyond advancing credit directly to planters, European and New York
merchants also invested in southern state bonds and banks that financed
a further expansion of cotton planting. In 1829, Baring underwrote
Louisiana state bonds issued to finance the Consolidated Association of
the Planters of Louisiana Bank. Although the bank was established by
planters in 1828, foremost among them Baring’s friend Edmond Forstall,
when it turned out to be impossible to raise sufficient capital,
ultimately the State of Louisiana guaranteed the bonds. Once the bonds
were issued, Baring took .666 million worth of them. Two years later, by
April 1830, the bank had outstanding loans to planters of .6 million,
secured by property valued at million. In effect, Baring financed a
great expansion of the Louisiana plantation complex, enabling the
clearing of land and the purchase of slaves, all of which eventually fed
into his own huge cotton import business. Few if any places in the world
drew such concentrated capital investments as the plantation belt of the
United States—and few places were the source of such massive
profits.37</p>
<p>Much of that European and, increasingly, New York and Boston capital
went into the expansion of cotton agriculture via a group of
intermediary merchants who connected cotton merchants with American
cotton planters—the factors. They completed the chain of traders between
factory and plantation. The interaction between the merchants exporting
cotton and the factors who connected to the growers was the fulcrum
through which European capital pushed the southern countryside toward
the rhythms of the machine.</p>
<p>These American middlemen accepted planters’ cotton on commission,
transported it to ports, and then sold it to merchants such as the
Barings and the Browns. This service was of enormous benefit to
planters, as it enabled them to sell their products in large coastal
markets or even in Europe, giving in effect even the remotest of them
access to distant markets. Factors also provided planters with
manufactured goods and food supplies. And they were the most significant
deliverers of capital into the cotton-growing regions of the U.S. South,
channeling credit to planters who used the money to acquire the supplies
they needed to tide themselves over until the next cotton harvest and to
purchase more land and more slaves to expand the production of
cotton.38</p>
<p>Interest on these loans—8 percent and more—secured by future cotton
harvests, was another source of factors’ revenue. Factors drew for
capital on European merchants, and thus “the world’s money markets, like
the world’s commodity markets, became available to the cotton planter
through his factor.” Collecting cotton from slave planters and yeomen
farmers and selling it to exporters did not make them the wealthiest
traders in the empire of cotton, but it did make them the most numerous.
Factors clustered wherever cotton was grown. Embodying coastal capital,
they brought the global norms of capital accumulation and the
manufacturers’ demand for ever cheaper cotton at predictable qualities
to the doorsteps of slave plantations.39</p>
<p>Cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, and Memphis counted within
their confines dozens of factors, who drew huge quantities of cotton to
those ports. Indeed, Samuel Smith, a Liverpool cotton broker, reported
from New Orleans that “the levee or bank of the great Mississippi
river…was lined with a double or triple row of cotton steamers extending
for miles.” So many “cotton bales were piled up on their decks” that
“they looked like floating castles.” But smaller cities attracted
factors, and thus cotton, as well. In the small town of Newport on the
St. Marks River in Florida, for example, Daniel Ladd plied his business.
Born in Augusta, Maine, in 1817 into a family of merchants, shippers,
and textile mill owners, at age sixteen Ladd joined one of his relatives
as a clerk in a commission house in Florida, going into business on his
own shortly afterward. Newport was a fortunate location for such a
business, because the town had emerged by the 1820s as an important port
to export cotton grown in northern Florida and southern Georgia. By
1850, Newport and the neighboring town of St. Marks would ship
forty-five thousand bales of cotton a year, presenting, according to
Ladd’s biographer, an opportunity for “his imaginative mind,” which “was
continually devising ways of turning them into profitable ventures.”
Ladd provided advances to planters, sold cotton for them on commission,
purchased cotton, provided supplies, and offered shipping facilities.
Deeply immersed in the slave economy, Ladd himself owned twenty-seven
slaves by 1860, and also traded in slaves, advertising in 1847 hats,
saddles, and “a field hand and a rough cook.” He held many mortgages
secured by slaves, for example, “For 00 payable on February 15, 1845, R.
H. Crowell pledged a sixteen-year-old Negro girl named Carolyn and 300
bushels of corn.” Ladd’s business, though local by definition, was
connected to the wider world of manufacturing and credit in many
different ways. The cotton that Ladd sold was consigned to Boston,
Savannah, or especially New York City houses, where most of the capital
came from. And agents of Ladd’s went yearly to New York to purchase
supplies, spending more than 0,000 in 1860.40</p>
<p>At bottom, factors like Ladd drew on capital advanced by European
merchants and they advanced that capital to planters to enable them to
purchase land, slaves, and provisions. Those same European merchants
also advanced credit to enable manufacturers to purchase cotton, and
provided capital to cloth traders worldwide, enabling them to acquire
cotton goods to sell to customers. Without credit, the empire of cotton
would have crumbled—indeed, as any foreclosed planter knew only too
well, the empire of cotton was at its heart an empire of credit.</p>
<p>Merchants, in turn, gained access to capital from various sources.
Partly, they generated capital in the trade itself; many a cotton
merchant had begun as a clerk or partner in another merchant’s house and
then used the accumulated profits to go into trade under his own name.
Other merchants, as we have seen, moved their assets from a different
line of trade into the cotton business. The Barings did just that,
transferring capital from their government loan business and East India
engagements into the cotton trade. So did the Browns, who used the
capital accumulated in the linen trade to go into cotton; the Rathbones,
who used the profits from their diversified trade to specialize in
cotton; Nathan Rothschild, who used his father’s profits in banking and
general trade to invest massively in the textile business; and Bombay
merchant Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, who used profits from the opium trade to
get into the cotton export business. Other merchants accumulated riches
in the slave trade—Liverpool merchants sometimes shifted into cotton
after Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807. And then there were the
banks that pooled merchants’ resources in cities such as Liverpool, Le
Havre, and New York, banks willing to advance credit to traders who in
turn could use it to oil the global machinery of cotton
production.41</p>
<p>Much of this credit was secured by the future delivery of commodities
grown by slaves and even by the value of slaves themselves. This link
became most obvious when things went wrong—for example, when planters
could not repay the advances of their factors and factors could not
repay the credit of exporting merchants. In this way, the Browns of New
York, who advanced large sums of money to southern planters, came to own
at least thirteen cotton plantations in the South, along with hundreds
of slaves. In 1842, William and James Brown estimated that the value of
these plantations amounted to 48,000, out of a total investment in the
South of .55 million. James Brown, in fact, sat in his New York office
hiring resident managers for slave plantations.42 The American Chamber
of Commerce in Liverpool understood this relationship when it reported
at its 1843 meeting that</p>
<p>it very often happens that in the course of such transactions
planters or other persons in Slave holding countries become indebted to
British merchants who, with a view to secure themselves from loss, take
security from their debtors by means of mortgage of their plantations
with the Slaves which form an essential part of the value. In the
Commercial transactions between England and the United States of America
which a few years since resulted in so heavy a debt owing to this
Country, British Merchants either directly or through their Agents were
obliged to take securities of this kind to a large amount, many of which
are yet unrealized. The debtors in many cases had nothing else to
offer.43</p>
<p>Not only did individual merchants become slave owners, but more
broadly, the flow of credit between Britain and the United States rested
to a significant degree on slave property. It was exactly for this
reason that in 1843 the American Chamber of Commerce in Liverpool
lobbied against the Slave Act, which, they feared, would make “all
mortgages [secured by slaves] and other Securities made…to accomplish
any object or contract in relation to any object” unlawful. People used
as collateral, not just as laborers, lubricated the flow of capital, and
thus cotton, around the globe with ever greater velocity.44</p>
<p>This system of extending credit was vulnerable to disruptions
precisely because it was so global in scope. Every one of its parts was
related to every other; if people failed in one part of the empire, the
crisis could spread rapidly to every other part. Lancashire
manufacturers were dependent on foreign markets, and the failure of
merchants in these markets to remit payments could create serious
problems at home. “As it is about Eleven months since you purchased from
us the last parcel of Goods, and our engagements are heavy and will be
no doubt pressing this spring, permit us to request from you an early
remittance in Cash or produce,” exhorted the New York merchants Hamlin
and Van Vechten with considerable anxiety. If prices for raw cotton fell
rapidly, as sometimes happened, merchants would hold cotton worth less
than the advances they had made, making it difficult or impossible for
them to pay their debts. The result: the global panics of 1825, 1837,
and 1857.45</p>
<p>Despite periodic collapses, capital for the most part moved with
remarkable ease into the farthest reaches of cotton production in
regions of the world dominated by slave labor. It was much harder for
European buying brokers, selling brokers, importing merchants, and
factors, despite the rapidly growing capital at their command, to
penetrate cotton-growing countrysides dominated by peasant labor. The
rhythms of peasant production, as we have seen, proved stubborn—much to
the voluble frustration of cotton merchants and manufacturers. In fact,
the tools of European war capitalism, so effective in North America, did
not allow for the full incorporation of land and labor in Asia and
Africa into the global cotton nexus. The necessary infrastructure,
physical, administrative, military and legal, simply did not exist.</p>
<p>Not that there was no connection between European merchant capital
and peasant producers, for example in India. However, the quantities of
cotton traded remained limited, and the quality never quite satisfied
European manufacturers. The ways cotton was produced in India never
meshed well with the particular needs of modern European spinning
factories. Indeed, in regions where cotton was grown by peasant labor,
European capital did not reach the producers. Instead, local growers
retained sufficient control over their land and labor to escape the
monocultural production of cotton for global markets, and indigenous
merchants retained control over the internal cotton trade—and even
exports. As late as 1851, Indian merchants such as Cursetjee
Furndoonjee, Cowasji Nanabhoy Davar, and Merwanji Framju Panday exported
more cotton bales from India than did European merchants. If anything,
European firms were more often subordinate agents for Indian cotton
merchants, and borrowers of Indian merchant capital. Indian merchants,
of course, also dominated cotton production within India itself, with
local capital largely financing cotton growing for export.46</p>
<p>The central role of Indian merchants in the trade in raw cotton built
upon their earlier role in the cloth trade. In 1788, the Board of Trade
in India had reported to the governor-general of the East India Company
that the cotton trade “is still very much in the simple inartificial
state of the Natives, the business of it greatly depending on them.” At
first, Indian merchants such as Bombay traders Pestonjee Jemsatjee,
Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, and Sorabje Jevangee were able to translate this
expertise in the cloth trade to the trade in raw cotton as well. As a
result, throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, the
influence of Western merchants in India usually remained limited to
coastal cities, and even there they encountered stiff competition from
Indian merchants. The Bombay Chamber of Commerce, founded in 1836,
counted among its numbers numerous Indian merchants, reflecting their
continued importance. As the chamber observed as late as 1847, “Your
Committee did not think it proper to hold out any hope that Merchants,
as such, could in the present state of European agency and operation in
the country, take up any such position, involving as it would do the
maintenance of Establishments in the interior: and it was thought proper
to add the only support which English Merchants could contemplate
affording, must be limited to the purchase of Cotton when brought here
to market, and which, it was said, they were quite prepared to
do.”47</p>
<p>In the cotton-growing countryside itself, Indian traders advanced
funds to growers, often at exorbitant rates of interest, who in turn
sold the raw cotton to brokers, who then advanced the cotton to coastal
merchants—a system the British considered “evil,” principally because it
eluded their control. As Bombay-based merchant John Richards reported in
1832 to the Barings in London, “The Native Merchants exclusively receive
the produce from the interior, from along the Coast, the Persian Gulf,
the Red Sea, China there are many of them both Hindoos andandandand
Parsees that are wealthy, some even possessing large capital. As yet the
Business is so completely in their hands that Contracts for Cotton which
have been attempted to be entered into with Merchants up the Coast have
failed in the attempt.” This dominance of non-European capital, along
with the continued control over land and labor by local peasants,
resulted, among other things, in cotton production geared to the needs
of local producers, including local manufacturers, rather than the
specifications of distant European mill owners.48</p>
<p>The independence of Indian merchants and producers was hardly
exceptional in the first half of the nineteenth century; European
commercial penetration into the hinterland of cotton-growing areas was
still the exception rather than the rule in most of the world. At
mid-century, most cotton produced was never traded through the books of
European or North American merchants. In China, imported Indian cotton
came under the control of Hong merchants who sold it to dealers in the
hinterland. In western Anatolia, like India, the trade between its port
city, Izmir, and its cotton-producing regions was in the hands of local
merchants. In another part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, the impact of
Western merchants on trade between producers and the port of Alexandria
remained just as limited. Until the late 1840s, Muhammad Ali enforced a
virtual monopoly of acquiring raw cotton from producers and selling it
to coastal merchants, not least by forcing peasants to pay their taxes
in cotton. And some newly industrializing areas avoided dependence on
imported cotton. In Mexico, for example, the Puebla industrialists
either purchased cotton directly from producers or drew on the offers
from Veracruz merchants.49</p>
<p>Remarkably, throughout the first half of the nineteenth century the
penetration of European capital into the global cotton-growing
countryside was largely limited to areas in which cotton was grown by
slave labor—slavery, not peasant production, was the handmaiden of wage
labor at the birth of the Industrial Revolution. Only after slavery
became untenable as a mode of labor mobilization and European states had
gained vastly increased administrative, judicial, military, and
infrastructural capacities thanks to their ability to capture some of
the wealth generated by mechanized manufacturing would European capital
and state power begin to revolutionize the global countryside in India,
Egypt, and, eventually, Central Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Despite its failure to integrate peasant producers into the empire of
cotton, the signal characteristic of the world’s first modern
manufacturing industry was its global nature. This globalization
required globalizers, people who saw the opportunities of the new order
and inspired their business communities and their states to collective
action to secure it. The principal globalizers were neither the planters
nor manufacturers, many intensely local in their mind-set, but instead,
as we have seen, the traders who specialized in creating networks that
connected cultivators, manufacturers, and consumers.</p>
<p>Forging such global networks took courage and imagination. When
Johannes Niederer tendered his services to the Swiss merchant house of
Volkart in 1854, he offered to scout market opportunities in Batavia,
Australia, Macassar, and Mindanao, Japan, China, Rangoon, Ceylon, and
Cape Town. Such globetrotting traders, as one historian has concluded,
“ruled the industry.” Indeed, manufacturers and growers regularly
complained about the power of traders, while many merchants, for their
part, looked down upon manufacturers as provincials and gamblers: Robert
Creighton, a Pennsylvania cotton trader, warned his sons even in his
will against becoming involved in manufacturing, as did Alexander Brown,
reminding his son William in 1819 that all members of the firm are
“unanimously opposed to any interest being taken in the Cotton
Mill.”50</p>
<p>To become such powerful actors in the empire of cotton and to manage
this trade profitably, the Rathbones, Barings, Lecesnes, Wätjens,
Rallis, and others constructed dense networks through which information,
credit, and goods could flow reliably.51 Building such networks was
extraordinarily difficult. The Rathbones, for example, spent astonishing
energy nurturing their links to merchants in New York, Boston, and
various southern ports, especially Charleston and New Orleans. They
corresponded constantly with business partners, trying to get market
updates and gain access to trade opportunities. They also traveled
frequently to the United States, and extended stays in North America
became a rite of passage for young members of the firm.52</p>
<p>Other merchants labored just as hard to create these networks. In
1828, Thomas Baring traveled up the coast of the United States from New
Orleans to Boston, researching local business conditions, establishing
closer connections to merchants in southern towns to recruit more trade,
and granting credit to various southern firms that allowed them to make
advances on cotton shipments. Jules Lecesne followed the same path,
building branch houses in various cotton ports throughout the Atlantic
world, and staffing them with his relatives, who constantly exchanged
information on prices and harvests, and who eventually even published a
French bulletin on cotton shipments in New Orleans. What was needed
above all was reliable information on everything from weather conditions
to the temperaments of brokers.53</p>
<p>The global cotton trade, as we have seen, rested on credit. Credit
rested on trust. Trust, in a global market extended well beyond the kin
of any family or tribe, rested on information. Information was
accordingly at the core of most merchants’ activities. A vast swath of
information was potentially relevant to any merchant, but two strands
were the most valuable: who paid back their debts, and what would happen
to the price of cotton in the coming months. As a result, millions of
letters—now housed in dark corners of libraries and archives—exchanged
between merchants spoke to these subjects. Expectations about future
price movements obviously mattered a great deal, and thus information
about factors that could possibly influence prices—the weather in
cotton-growing areas, the effects of wars, the state of regional
economies—was precious. While institutions such as the Bank of England
began gathering such information as well, most of it was still in
private hands, collected (and hoarded) for private use only.54</p>
<p>Where reliable information was scarce, rumors and gossip filled the
void. Reputation made and unmade firms, and the spread of manipulated
information could move markets. Being able to provide information, not
surprisingly, was a major source of prestige, and a primary way that
both an individual merchant and his firm improved their reputation. When
the Hamburg merchants of Menge andandandand Niemann offered their
services to Phelps, Dodge, a commercial house in New York in 1841, they
introduced themselves and their business, then immediately provided
information on the development of the Hamburg trade, including a price
circular printed under their name, which listed the local prices for a
whole range of commodities, including cotton.55 Doing business with
them, they suggested, would give Phelps, Dodge privileged access to
useful information.</p>
<p>The need both to have information and to be seen to have it was why
at the outset of his career as a Liverpool cotton broker, Samuel Smith
immediately launched his own cotton circular, a step that in retrospect
he judged “aided not a little in establishing my business.” On a grander
scale, in his memoir of his life in the cotton industry, Vincent Nolte,
the Barings agent in New Orleans, claimed he was the first person to
print up a cotton market circular, starting in 1818: “The meteorological
weather tables had given me the idea of getting up one similar to them,
which should exhibit the course and fluctuations of prices, from week to
week, during the shipping period of three successive years, and
designate the difference of exchange, each time, by black, red, and blue
lines.” Such information sharing, he went on to note, had resulted in
much new business.56</p>
<p>Because production was so dispersed and so global, information was
difficult to assemble. In 1845, Frédéric C. Dollfus, a member of one of
the oldest cotton manufacturing families in Mulhouse, arrived in the
port of Singapore. His goal was to understand what kinds of cotton goods
were in demand there, and to inform cotton manufacturers back home what
prices they might fetch. After detailed studies of the local markets in
Singapore, Dollfus proceeded to Macao, Canton, Hong Kong, Manila,
Batavia, and Semarang. Covering some of the most important Asian cotton
marts, he shared his hard-won intelligence with an interested audience
back home. A year later, Dollfus returned home to Mulhouse.57</p>
<p>This trip was just one of many efforts of Mulhouse manufacturers to
gain market information. In one of the era’s greatest
information-gathering ventures, they collected throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries thousands of cloth samples from around the
world and took careful notes as to their provenance and local market
prices, all in an effort to equip local manufacturers to produce for
remote markets. Catalan manufacturers engaged in a very similar though
more modest project.58</p>
<p>Access to information in turn privileged certain locations within the
empire of cotton, as William Rathbone VI realized in 1849, when he
predicted that New York would become “more and more the centre of the
American trade (guided of course by advices from European markets)….
Within 10 days sail from England andandandand within an hour of
information [by the newly invented telegraph] andandandand communication
with New Orleans, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Charleston andandandand a party
is in possession of more information of importance than at any other
point.”59 Rather than proximity to either cotton-growing or
cotton-manufacturing areas, what really counted for the Rathbones and
others was access to information. And New York, a city with neither a
cotton-growing hinterland nor spinning mills, provided exactly
that—although it could not compete with the information, credit, and
trade hub that Liverpool had become.</p>
<p>Such was the necessity of knowledge that merchants invented or
adopted increasingly more formalized ways of collecting and
disseminating information. They created publications dedicated to the
task: The British Packet and Argentine News, published from August 1826
in Buenos Aires, reported on Latin American and global markets,
including cotton yarn and cloth. The Landbote, a journal published in
Winterthur, disseminated after 1840 regular news about the cotton market
of Le Havre. The Bremer Handelsblatt reported regularly on cotton
harvests, cotton markets, and price developments in that city.60</p>
<p>Faster ships meant faster movement of information as well. Already in
1843 the Asiatic Journal was able to announce that “English periodicals
and newspapers arrive in Bombay almost damp from the press.” Bombay,
after all, “is very near us now,—a voyage of only five-and-thirty days
from London Bridge.” When by the 1840s telegraphs began connecting
cotton-growing, -trading, and consumption centers (though not yet across
oceans and continents), merchants had even more immediate access to
crucial information.61</p>
<p>Eventually the desire to formalize access to information became one
of the prime reasons for merchants to organize collectively. Liverpool
brokers had at first individually assembled information on the state of
the cotton trade and dispersed that information to their customers in
private circulars. In 1811, however, the brokers agreed to cooperate on
the gathering of information, though continuing to distribute it
privately to clients. Efforts to create a collective price circular for
cotton began in 1832, and when in 1841 the Liverpool Cotton Brokers’
Association came into being, its ninety members focused principally on
collecting and disseminating market information, especially on the
“visible supply” of cotton in the market. Such information-gathering
bodies emerged everywhere cotton was grown, traded, or made into yarn
and cloth. Chambers of commerce were often at the forefront: Manchester
merchants gathered in the Society of Merchants beginning in 1794, Le
Havre merchants formed a chamber of commerce in 1802, by 1825 there were
already twelve such institutions in the United Kingdom alone, in Bombay
merchants formed the Bombay Chamber of Commerce in 1836, in the 1830s
merchants in Brazil began organizing commercial associations, and by
1858 there were thirty such chambers in the United States. All these
bodies gathered market information, but they were also political lobbies
pleading the case for special attention from the burgeoning imperial
states.62</p>
<p>The dependence of this economic order on reliable information, trust,
and credit led merchants to depend on networks created outside the
market itself. The fashioning of global trade, just like the emergence
of wage labor, rested on social relations that predated the advent of
capitalism. What set merchants apart was not just their ability to
accumulate and deploy capital, or even their privileged access to
information, but their ability to build and draw upon these networks,
networks of trust based on extended family ties, geographical proximity,
and shared religious beliefs, ethnic identities, and origin. In a world
in which trade was extremely risky and the survival of a firm could
depend on the trustworthiness of just one correspondent, reliability was
essential. Reliability, however, came more easily when people who had
ways of enforcing trust embedded in social connections, creating in
effect what one historian has called a “relational capitalism.” The
importance of these networks was such that Olivier Pétré-Grenouilleau,
the leading French historian of merchant communities, concludes that
“the characteristics of Atlantic trade did not depend only on the rules
of the market.” Cotton markets rested more than most on such
extra-market social relations.63</p>
<p>Physical proximity was one way to establish networks of trust. The
global cotton trade concentrated in a relatively small number of trading
hubs not least because proximity allowed such networks and supporting
institutions to flourish. Nicholas Waterhouse, one of the first cotton
brokers in Liverpool, studded his businesses with family members and a
network of local “friends.” Liverpool merchants more broadly nurtured a
code of “strict probity and honour” that regulated their relationships,
as Edward Baines observed in 1835.64</p>
<p>But these networks needed to stretch halfway across the globe as
well. Establishing trust across vast distances was considerably more
difficult and required enormous effort. When William Rathbone VI visited
New York City in 1841 to energize the cotton business, he wrote to his
father of the urgent need to confirm “some valuable friendships.”
Indeed, the Rathbones’ correspondence is full of efforts to create
networks of trust and friendship. When Rathbone partner Adam Hodgson
scouted the U.S. cotton market in the early 1820s, he reported to
Rathbone from New York, “I am so well aware, that our united feeling of
mercantile obligation, andandandand personal friendship will render you
solicitous to avail yourselves of every opportunity of reciprocating the
kindness andandandand confidence which our friends have ever manifested
towards us, that I need not remind you in how great a degree I have been
experiencing both, ever since I landed in this country.” In language
reminiscent of a marriage proposal he reported about one merchant house
that “they are quite friendly andandandand I think true to us
andandandand with the help of an occasional cotton order may be seduced
into consignments.” Other merchant houses proceeded in similar ways:
When the Volkarts wanted to establish themselves in the European cotton
trade, they listed a number of Indian, German, English, and Swiss
merchant houses as “references” that testified to their respectable
character. They appealed to others to “trust” them, and mentioned their
“intimate friend[s].” When the Barings wanted to expand trade with
India, their Bombay agent identified local traders whom he considered
“attentive, intelligent, andandandand very honourable men, in whom you
could place confidence with perfect safety.”65</p>
<p>Family members who did not have to be sought out or specially
cultivated were especially crucial to these networks. When in 1805
William Rathbone had problems selling off the cotton he had purchased
and urgently needed access to cash, his father and brother each gave him
£3,000, helping William to overcome his “considerable anxiety.” When the
Browns sought to expand their network of agents and correspondents in
southern ports, they looked for ties that held. Their Charleston agent,
James Adger, originated from northern Ireland, like the Browns, and was
an old friend of Alexander’s. In Savannah, their agent, John Cumming,
was connected by marriage to the Browns, as were representatives in
other ports. For the Volkarts, family connections were just as
important. Volkart’s father-in-law Eduard Forrer established an agency
in St. Louis. Theodor Reinhart, after having learned the cotton business
in his father’s house, in 1876 married Lily Volkart, daughter of the
owner of Volkart Brothers, thus uniting two merchant firms, a truly
dynastic marriage in the world of cotton.66</p>
<p>Consider too one of the most important cotton trading houses of the
nineteenth century, the Rallis.67 Their world-spanning empire had its
roots on a small Greek island off the Anatolian coast, as most if not
all of the principals of the house of Ralli came from Chios, and indeed,
most were members of the Ralli family themselves. John Ralli and Strati
Ralli, two brothers, had gone to London to start trading there. In 1822
they brought a third brother, Pandia S. Ralli, to London. In 1825 Strati
Ralli opened the office in Manchester to trade in textiles, and in 1827
John Ralli went to Odessa. A fourth brother, living in Istanbul, opened
an office in Persia in 1837, and a fifth, Augustus S. Ralli, opened a
cotton firm in Marseille. By the 1860s, the house of Ralli had
representatives in London (from 1818), Liverpool, Manchester (from
1825), “the Orient” (Constantinople, Odessa), various places within
India, including Calcutta (1851), Karachi (1861) and Bombay (1861), and
the United States.68 Ralli thus was able to purchase cotton in the
United States, ship it to Liverpool, sell it to manufacturers in
Manchester, and then sell the finished goods in Calcutta—all within
their own family.</p>
<p>As the example of the Rallis shows, the Greek diaspora, like
others—Armenian, Parsis, Jews—played an important role in the global
cotton trade. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, Greeks had
become particularly important to networks connecting the Ottoman Empire
to the outside world, and were especially prominent in the Egyptian
cotton trade. Arriving in Egypt in the first half of the nineteenth
century during the first wave of Muhammad Ali’s industrialization
efforts, they became the largest group of foreign merchants. By 1839,
twelve Greek merchant houses, including the Rallis, had captured 33
percent of the Alexandria cotton export market, with the largest Greek
house, Tossizza Frères et Cie, exporting 11 percent of Egypt’s
cotton.69</p>
<p>Other diaspora communities played an important role in the global
cotton trade. Jews assumed a central position in the global trade of
yarn and cotton cloth, partly because earlier discrimination had forced
them to work as itinerant traders, often in textiles. The most famous
example for this important role are the Rothschilds, who upon entering
the textile trade in Manchester mostly found customers among their
coreligionists in Frankfurt for the goods they exported to the European
continent. Nathan Meyer Rothschild’s story can stand in for many others:
Born in 1777 into a distinguished Frankfurt banking and merchant family,
he went to London for a mercantile apprenticeship in 1798 and a year
later moved to Manchester to open his own textile agency, bringing with
him plenty of capital. “The nearer I got to England,” he remembered in
his autobiography, “the cheaper the goods were. As soon as I got to
Manchester, I laid out all my money, things were so cheap; and I made
good profit.” He purchased Manchester goods for the Frankfurt and
continental European market, and advanced credit to manufacturers.
Rothschild’s success in Manchester encouraged other Jewish families from
Frankfurt to start up businesses in Manchester. As a result, by the
early nineteenth century Frankfurt Jewish families played an important
role in the continental trade in English cottons.70</p>
<p>While it was still exceptional, diaspora networks were sometimes
incorporated within firms, gradually lessening the importance of trust
networks. The Rallis were such a case, and so, in a more limited way,
were the Browns. Perhaps furthest ahead of its time, however, was a
Swiss house that incorporated far-flung networks into their firm itself:
Volkart Brothers. Founded in 1851 by Salomon Volkart simultaneously in
the Swiss town of Winterthur—an important center of the cotton
industry—and in Bombay, the firm began by purchasing raw cotton in India
and exporting manufactured wares to India. As they opened more branch
offices, Volkart Brothers increasingly organized the purchasing of
cotton not only in India but also in other parts of the world,
transporting that cotton to various European ports and then selling it
to spinners. By the late 1850s, Volkart Brothers incorporated a whole
range of selling and buying activities.71</p>
<p>The revolutionary vanguard: Salomon Volkart, Winterthur, Switzerland,
transforms peasant agriculture. (illustration credit 8.5)</p>
<p>Yet at midcentury, Volkart was exceptional; most cotton was still
traded between independent houses mediated by networks of trust. In the
whirl of letters, face-to-face conversations, and travel, as these
merchants developed a familiarity with and connection to people in many
different parts of the world, they became in effect a cosmopolitan
community. Unlike planters or manufacturers, merchants often had closer
connections to people far away than to people in their home cities or
immediate hinterlands. In a typical midcentury letter, E. Rathbone
referred to business partners or relatives in such diverse places as
Cairo, Aden, Palestine, Alexandria, and France. In Le Havre, as in
Alexandria, Liverpool, and Bombay, the merchants came from all over the
world—indeed, only a few of the large merchants were members of ancient
families of Le Havre itself. Rathbone and other merchants inhabited a
transnational community, in which they traveled with ease. People in
distant cities and towns engaged in similar lines of business, dressed
in similar ways, lived in houses not unlike those at home, read from a
similar set of books, had similar views of human nature and political
economy, and might have been part of the same family.72</p>
<p>Cohesive as a social class and fortified by the institutions they had
built, these merchants also developed tremendous political clout from
England to France to the United States. They understood early that their
trade was deeply embedded within local, national, and global politics;
they acted as if they understood instinctively that the state does not
intervene in the market, but constitutes it. Their daily experience had
taught them that global trade did not arise in a state of nature, but
only flourished via careful, conscious regulation. As a result,
according to Liverpool cotton broker Samuel Smith, politics was
everywhere: “As our business involved much foreign intercourse, and was
greatly affected by the course of foreign affairs, especially by wars
and the fear of wars, we became as a matter of course keen
politicians.”73</p>
<p>As merchants became “keen politicians” and realized the state’s
importance for their grand project of integrating cotton cultivators,
cotton manufacturers, and cotton consumers, they encountered rulers and
bureaucrats who shared many of their inclinations. European states had
become increasingly dependent for their very existence on the wealth
generated by rapid capital accumulation, including in cottons. Statesmen
were thus solicitous toward capitalists, and often submissive when these
patrons of the state organized collectively. What set European states
apart from other contemporary states such as Japan and China was not
just their capacity, but also their responsiveness to the needs of
industrial capital.74</p>
<p>Though merchants lobbied their governments about anything and
everything, among the most important issues was the infrastructure of
trade. The construction of docks, storage facilities, railways, and
waterways was high on the merchants’ agenda, since they directly
affected the speed at which goods and information moved through the
emerging global economy—and that speed of circulation determined the
speed of accumulation.75</p>
<p>Though it could seem haphazard and unregulated, subject to the whims
of a few men, trade ultimately also depended on a legal infrastructure
devised and enforced by states. Unsurprisingly, merchants spent much of
their political energy on trying to strengthen this legal order and make
it conform to their interests. In the process they increased, both
wittingly and unwittingly, the capacity of the state. Conventions,
although agreed upon by merchants themselves, needed enforceable rules,
and merchants understood that no single actor was as efficient in
enforcing these rules as the state. As New York lawyer Daniel Lord
explained in detail in his 1835 “Law of Agency,” legal rules had allowed
merchants to have agents and factors in distant places, and to act for
them: “It is by this bringing into aid and subordination, the powers of
others…that modern commerce touches at once the extremes of longitude,
and subdues alike the Equator and the Poles; She crosses the oceans,
tracks the African deserts, and conquers the plains of Asia.”76</p>
<p>The “law” became particularly important when it came to the actual
transformation of the global countryside into a supplier of industrial
raw materials and a market for manufactured goods. The more suppliers of
cotton, the more consumers of cotton, the more trade. To make that
transition possible, merchants yearned for a more powerful state
presence, especially in the nonslave areas of the world. One of their
most urgent obsessions was to inject the “law” into this global
cotton-growing countryside, though their ability to do so was often
frustrated in societies dominated by peasant production.</p>
<p>The importance of the law was clearest in colonial settings such as
British India. In Bombay, merchants pressured the British government
constantly for new rules and regulations regarding the Indian cotton
trade. “The cotton legislation was not only chronologically the earliest
economic legislation of British rule, it was also perhaps the most
advanced legislation in the contemporary economic world,” observed one
chronicler of the Indian cotton trade. The rules of the market, and thus
the market itself, emerged at the intersection of merchant collective
action and the state. Yet ironically, the more merchants succeeded in
their project of extending the authority of the state, the less trade
depended on the networks of trust that they had forged over prior
generations.77</p>
<p>As the law increasingly infused the global countryside, and as
state-sponsored infrastructure projects accelerated the movement of
goods, merchants mobilized collectively to use state power to shape
global markets to their benefit in other ways as well. Their industrial
policy, in effect, was global. And it was the most global for British
merchants and manufacturers. At the center of the empire of cotton, they
believed that opening access to foreign markets was a core function of
government. In 1821, for example, the Manchester Chamber of Commerce
wanted the government to pressure Denmark to reduce its import duties on
yarn; in 1822 they demanded freer trade to the East Indies; and later
they agitated for the removal of duties between Britain and Ireland and
debated “Brazil custom Duties,” “Duties on British Goods Imported into
Batavia,” “duties at Monte Video,” trade with Morocco, and “duties at
Shanghai.” Le Havre merchants pressured for the most unencumbered trade
as well.78</p>
<p>While most merchants had a clear ideological commitment to free
trade, which corresponded perfectly with their interest in market access
and cheap labor, they could advocate just as forcefully for creating
novel barriers to trade. In fact, their insistence on free trade was
remarkably inconsistent. As early as 1794, a number of cotton merchants
protested “against the export of cotton twist from England.” The export
of spun cotton, according to them, threatened British prosperity, as the
yarn was woven into fabrics in low-wage Germany, creating unemployment
in Britain. In an eerily modern argument, they argued that “Germany’s
cheaper food enabled them to manufacture by hand cheaper than our
workpeople could, they had first deprived our hand loom weavers of
employment and now were rapidly progressing with the other departments
including spinning.” The Manchester Chamber of Commerce similarly
opposed the emigration of “English Artizans” and “the free exportation
of such Machinery as is employed in our own Manufactories.”79</p>
<p>Merchants appealed to their national governments to protect access to
foreign markets, using both political power and military might. In 1794,
the Manchester Society of Merchants talked about the importance of
having the Royal Navy protect ships going into the Mediterranean with
valuable local manufactures on board. In 1795 they appealed to the
government to protect their trade with Germany, and the continent more
broadly, by military force. In Manchester, merchants asked the
government to protect ships in the Atlantic from pirates, and called for
a “large Naval Force.”80</p>
<p>The merchants’ political vision, like their trade, was truly global,
stretching from “sound dues payable upon cotton twist exported to the
Baltic” to colonial debt laws bent on opening India as a market. In
Britain, India soon emerged as the “chief question.” For cotton mill
owner Henry Ashworth, the Indian market would provide unlimited
opportunities, if opened by the proper governmental interventions: “Now,
although I am as great a stickler perhaps as most here for adhesion to
sound free-trade principles, it does not always follow that in dealing
with people who are not as advanced political economists as ourselves,
that we should delay our movements until they have become converted.
(‘Hear’).” As a dabbling economist, Ashworth understood intuitively that
economic thinking helps “format the economy”—makes possible the formerly
impossible—which is exactly what it would do a few decades later in
India.81</p>
<p>Calling for the state to convert Indian peasants into producers of
cotton for world markets formed one part of merchants’ much larger
project of bringing the state into the global cotton-growing
countryside. They understood that unlike in the slave-dominated
cotton-growing areas of the world, in India and elsewhere they needed
the capacity of the imperial state to effect the transformations they
hoped for. What they did not anticipate was that the more they furthered
the state-building project, the more they were diminishing their own
importance to the empire of cotton.</p>
<p>Henry Ashworth understood more explicitly than many others the way
the world of trade rested on powerful states structuring global markets,
and he unabashedly celebrated the involvement of the British state in
the interests of its merchants and manufacturers. Industrializing states
depended on a flourishing manufacturing economy for their strength and
social stability. Even statesmen of no great vision could grasp the
importance of securing a reliable supply of raw materials for domestic
industry and of creating a market for its products. So fast was their
rate of growth, and so fierce their competition, that European states
sought to transform the global countryside simultaneously into a
supplier of materials for their industrial enterprises and into
consumers for the resulting products. Having transformed their own
countrysides in the search for labor, they sought to deploy that
experience to the rest of the world, making the particular form of that
integration into nothing less than a “law of nature.”</p>
<p>This new, conveniently and divinely ordained mission unintentionally
but no less surely lessened the dependence of industrial capitalism on
some of the earlier mechanisms of war capitalism—especially the
wholesale expropriation of native peoples and the mobilization of labor
through slavery. With a greater capacity to lay down market-directed
infrastructure, and a legal apparatus geared toward infusing European
capital into the global countryside and mobilizing workers, merchants
redoubled their efforts to reorient peasant agriculture toward the
production of cotton for world markets. As states grew stronger,
merchants were able to infuse unprecedented flows of capital, and with
it the logic of industrial production, into heretofore independent
hinterlands. The British merchant house of Baring by the 1840s
diversified the sources of its cotton supply by importing from Bombay.
European capitalists also entered the trade with the Egyptian
cotton-producing fellaheen. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, with the
weakening of the governmental monopoly on the internal cotton trade,
merchants, especially of Greek heritage, penetrated the interior and
began to purchase cotton from peasants directly. But perhaps most
forward-looking was the model developed by Volkart Brothers. Their
Indian cotton traders, riding on the coattails of an expanding imperial
government, moved ever closer to local producers themselves, so that by
1875 the Volkarts and their European colleagues exported more than twice
as much cotton as their once dominant Indian counterparts.82</p>
<p>Before European capital could find its partners in the imperial
states of the late 1800s, however, the cotton empire would be shocked by
the region of the world where slavery and industrial capitalism seemed
most powerfully and profitably conjoined: the United States. Everywhere
else, slavery and industrial capitalism seemed to coexist perfectly
well. But everywhere else, as we know, these two engines of profit were
separated by national boundaries. Not so in North America. For the
United States, unlike any other part of the world, brought war
capitalism and industrial capitalism within the same national territory.
No political union could contain forever the contrary political forces
of both systems.</p>
<p>As the United States found its economic footing, slave owners and
industrial capitalists made increasingly different demands on the state.
American manufacturers and a few of its merchants, like their
counterparts in Britain and elsewhere, gained confidence that the
mechanisms of industrial capitalism could be moved into the global
cotton-growing countryside and could indeed secure sufficient supplies
of the raw material. Boston cotton manufacturer Edward Atkinson became a
fervent believer in wage labor, as he observed his ability to mobilize
and discipline large numbers of workers in his mill. As elsewhere in the
world, American industrialists like Atkinson hitched their political
interests to a strengthening national government.83 Cotton-growing slave
owners, on the other hand, favored the political economy of Atlantic
trade, and depended on the state’s willingness to secure more lands for
plantation agriculture and to enforce and support the institution of
slavery. They feared that any strengthening of the federal government
might interfere with their mastery over labor. Slavery, after all,
required constant violence against potentially rebellious slaves, and
that violence rested on the state’s willingness to condone it. Slave
owners therefore felt an overpowering need to secure control over the
state, or, at the very least, to keep the opponents of slavery out of
the national halls of power.</p>
<p>Yet that control was increasingly elusive. A small but growing group
of Americans who sought to construct a political economy of domestic
industrialization emerged from the dynamic industrial economy of the
northern states. Their political needs, like those of the planters,
required control of state institutions. But unlike southerners, northern
industrial capitalists drew increasing political strength from a
relatively stable political coalition with commercial farmers and even
segments of a rapidly expanding working class. These capitalists drew
encouragement from the fact that a small but growing number of
merchants, so long the planters’ most significant northern allies, were
increasingly embracing the project of domestic industrialization as
well—even though they hesitated to challenge the slave regime in the
South directly. Tellingly, the United States’ most important cotton
traders, the Browns, slowly began to specialize in the foreign exchange
business and to invest in industrial enterprises—railroads, for example,
but also the Novelty Iron Works in New York.84</p>
<p>Such moves made sense because their former commodity trade, with its
low entry costs, was always open to new competitors who were willing to
take on greater risks and operate on narrower margins. Low entry
barriers created a cotton market that included a very large number of
smaller operators, eventually pushing wealthier traders into emerging,
even more profitable lines of business, that had greater capital
requirements. Joining the Browns, foreign capitalists like the Barings
also increasingly diversified, especially into railroads, coal mining,
and manufacturing. They understood better than others that with the
state’s capacity expanding, the role of merchant capital was
diminishing, and that a future beckoned in which industrialists, in
conjunction with the state, would be able to burrow even further into
the global countryside to find still more land and labor for the
production and consumption of cotton. The most forward-looking
manufacturers and merchants discerned that such new forms of domination
would decisively weaken the power of commodity producers, and thus
eliminate one of the most threatening sources of instability in the
empire of cotton, and with it, global capitalism.85</p>
<p>This shifting balance of social power among different business groups
proved momentous. The United States was unique in that the schism
between economic elites was so great that, in a moment of great crisis,
even merchant capitalists aligned with slave owners dropped their old
allies. This was radically different from other slave-owning societies,
such as Brazil, where planters and export merchants formed a unified
political bloc, with agreement that domestic industrialization
constituted a threat to their economic interests and that slave labor
was indispensable.86</p>
<p>The realignment of the economic elites of the United States, along
with the promise of tapping nonslave hinterlands as the Volkarts had
done in India, threw the rising costs and diminishing benefits of
combining slavery and industrial capitalism into high relief. In 1861,
the mix exploded, and the ensuing American Civil War became a turning
point not just for that young republic, but also for the history of
global capitalism.</p>
