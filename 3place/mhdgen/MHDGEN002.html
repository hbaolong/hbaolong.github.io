<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Edgar Degas views the empire of cotton: merchants in New Orleans,
1873. (illustration credit itr.1)</p>
<p>In late January 1860, the members of the Manchester Chamber of
Commerce assembled in that city’s town hall for their annual meeting.
Prominent among the sixty-eight men who gathered in the center of what
was then the most industrialized city in the world were cotton merchants
and manufacturers. In the previous eighty years, these men had
transformed the surrounding countryside into the hub of something never
before seen—a global web of agriculture, commerce, and industrial
production. Merchants bought raw cotton from around the world and took
it to British factories, home to two-thirds of the world’s cotton
spindles. An army of workers spun that cotton into thread and wove it
into finished fabrics; then dealers sent those wares out to the world’s
markets.</p>
<p>The assembled gentlemen were in a celebratory mood. President Edmund
Potter reminded his audience of the “amazing increase” of their industry
and “the general prosperity of the whole country, and more particularly
of this district.” Their discussions were expansive, touching on the
affairs of Manchester, Great Britain, Europe, the United States, China,
India, South America, and Africa. Cotton manufacturer Henry Ashworth
added superlatives of his own, celebrating “a degree of prosperity in
business which has probably been unequalled in any previous time.”1</p>
<p>These self-satisfied cotton manufacturers and merchants had reason to
be smug: They stood at the center of a world-spanning empire—the empire
of cotton. They ruled over factories in which tens of thousands of
workers operated huge spinning machines and noisy power looms. They
acquired cotton from the slave plantations of the Americas and sold the
products of their mills to markets in the most distant corners of the
world. The cotton men debated the affairs of the world with surprising
nonchalance, even though their own occupations were almost banal—making
and hawking cotton thread and cloth. They owned noisy, dirty, crowded,
and decidedly unrefined factories; they lived in cities black with soot
from coal-fueled steam engines; they breathed the stench of human sweat
and human waste. They ran an empire, but hardly seemed like
emperors.</p>
<p>Only a hundred years earlier, the ancestors of these cotton men would
have laughed at the thought of a cotton empire. Cotton was grown in
small batches and worked up by the hearth; the cotton industry played a
marginal role at best in the United Kingdom. To be sure, some Europeans
knew of beautiful Indian muslins, chintzes, and calicoes, what the
French called indiennes, arriving in the ports of London, Barcelona, Le
Havre, Hamburg, and Trieste. Women and men in the European countryside
spun and wove cottons, modest competitors to the finery of the East. In
the Americas, in Africa, and especially in Asia, people sowed cotton
among their yam, corn, and jowar. They spun the fiber and wove it into
the fabrics that their households needed or their rulers demanded. As
they had for centuries, even millennia, people in Dhaka, Kano, and
Teotihuacán, among many other places, made cotton cloth and applied
beautiful colors to it. Some of these fabrics were traded globally. Some
were of such extraordinary fineness that contemporaries called them
“woven wind.”</p>
<p>Instead of women on low stools spinning on small wooden wheels in
their cottages, or using a distaff and spinning bowl in front of their
hut, in 1860 millions of mechanical spindles—powered by steam engines
and operated by wage workers, many of them children—turned for up to
fourteen hours a day, producing millions of pounds of yarn. Instead of
householders growing cotton and turning it into homespun thread and
hand-loomed cloth, millions of slaves labored on plantations in the
Americas, thousands of miles away from the hungry factories they
supplied, factories that in turn were thousands of miles removed from
eventual consumers of the cloth. Instead of caravans carrying West
African cloth across the Sahara on camels, steamships plied the world’s
oceans, loaded with cotton from the American South or with British-made
cotton fabrics. By 1860, the cotton capitalists who assembled to
celebrate their accomplishments took as a fact of nature history’s first
globally integrated cotton manufacturing complex, even though the world
they had helped create was of very recent vintage.</p>
<p>But in 1860, the future was nearly as unimaginable as the past.
Manufacturers and merchants alike would have scoffed if told how
radically the world of cotton would change in the following century. By
1960, most raw cotton came again from Asia, China, the Soviet Union, and
India, as did the bulk of cotton yarn and cloth. In Britain, as well as
in the rest of Europe and New England, few cotton factories remained.
The former centers of cotton manufacturing—Manchester, Mulhouse, Barmen,
and Lowell among them—were littered with abandoned mills and haunted by
unemployed workers. Indeed, in 1963 the Liverpool Cotton Association,
once one of cotton’s most important trade associations, sold its
furniture at auction.2 The empire of cotton, at least the part dominated
by Europe, had come crashing down.</p>
<p>This book is the story of the rise and fall of the European-dominated
empire of cotton. But because of the centrality of cotton, its story is
also the story of the making and remaking of global capitalism and with
it of the modern world. Foregrounding a global scale of analysis we will
learn how, in a remarkably brief period, enterprising entrepreneurs and
powerful statesmen in Europe recast the world’s most significant
manufacturing industry by combining imperial expansion and slave labor
with new machines and wage workers. The very particular organization of
trade, production, and consumption they created exploded the disparate
worlds of cotton that had existed for millennia. They animated cotton,
invested it with world-changing energy, and then used it as a lever to
transform the world. Capturing the biological bounty of an ancient
plant, and the skills and huge markets of an old industry in Asia,
Africa, and the Americas, European entrepreneurs and statesmen built an
empire of cotton of tremendous scope and energy. Ironically, their
shocking success also awakened the very forces that eventually would
marginalize them within the empire they had created.</p>
<p>Along the way, millions of people spent their lives working the acres
of cotton that slowly spread across the world, plucking billions of
bolls from resistant cotton plants, carrying bales of cotton from cart
to boat and from boat to train, and working, often at very young ages,
at “satanic mills” from New England to China. Countries fought wars for
access to these fertile fields, planters put untold numbers of people
into shackles, employers abbreviated the childhoods of their operatives,
the introduction of new machines led to the depopulation of ancient
industrial centers, and workers, both slave and free, struggled for
freedom and a living wage. Men and women who had long sustained
themselves through small plots of land, growing cotton alongside their
food, saw their way of life end. They left behind their agricultural
tools and headed to the factory. In other parts of the world, many who
had worked at their looms and who wore clothing that they themselves had
woven found their products overwhelmed by the ceaseless output of
machines. They left their spinning wheels and moved into the fields, now
trapped in a cycle of endless pressure and endless debt. The empire of
cotton was, from the beginning, a site of constant global struggle
between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and
merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways,
the empire of cotton ushered in the modern world.</p>
<p>Today cotton is so ubiquitous that it is hard to see it for what it
is: one of mankind’s great achievements. As you read this sentence,
chances are you are wearing something woven from cotton. And it is just
as likely that you have never plucked a cotton boll from its stem, seen
a wispy strand of raw cotton fiber, or heard the deafening noise of a
spinning mule and a power loom. Cotton is as familiar as it is unknown.
We take its perpetual presence for granted. We wear it close to our
skin. We sleep under it. We swaddle our newborns in it. Cotton is in the
banknotes we use, the coffee filters that help us awaken in the morning,
the vegetable oil we use for cooking, the soap we wash with, and the
gunpowder that fights our wars (indeed, Alfred Nobel won a British
patent for his invention of “guncotton”). Cotton is even a component of
the book you hold in your hands.</p>
<p>For about nine hundred years, from 1000 to 1900 CE, cotton was the
world’s most important manufacturing industry. Though it now has been
surpassed by other industries, cotton remains important in terms of
employment and global trade. It is so ubiquitous that in 2013 the world
produced at least 123 million cotton bales, each weighing about four
hundred pounds—enough to produce twenty T‑shirts for each living person.
Stacked on top of one another, the bales would create a tower forty
thousand miles high; laid horizontally the bales would circle the globe
one and a half times. Huge cotton plantations dot the earth, from China
to India and the United States, from West Africa to Central Asia. The
raw strands they produce, tightly packed in bales, are still shipped
around the globe, to factories employing hundreds of thousands of
workers. The finished pieces are then sold everywhere, from remote
village stores to Walmart. Indeed, cotton might be one of the very few
human-made goods that is available virtually anywhere, testifying both
to cotton’s utility and to capitalism’s awe-inspiring increases in human
productivity and consumption. As a recent advertising campaign in the
United States announced, quite accurately, “Cotton is the fabric of our
lives.”3</p>
<p>Take a moment and imagine, if you can, a world without cotton. You
wake up in the morning on a bed covered in fur or straw. You dress in
woolens or, depending on the climate and your wealth, in linens or even
silks. Because it is hard to wash your clothes, and because they are
expensive or, if you make your own, labor-intensive, you change them
irregularly. They smell and scratch. They are largely monochromatic,
since, unlike cottons, wool and other natural fibers do not take colors
very well. And you are surrounded by sheep: it would take approximately
7 billion sheep to produce a quantity of wool equivalent to the world’s
current cotton crop. Those 7 billion sheep would need 700 million
hectares of land for grazing, about 1.6 times the surface area of
today’s European Union.4</p>
<p>Hard to imagine. But in a patch of land on the westernmost edge of
the Eurasian landmass, such a world without cotton was long the norm.
That land was Europe. Until the nineteenth century, cotton, while not
unknown, was marginal to European textile production and
consumption.</p>
<p>Why was it that the part of the world that had the least to do with
cotton—Europe—created and came to dominate the empire of cotton? Any
reasonable observer in, say, 1700, would have expected the world’s
cotton production to remain centered in India, or perhaps in China. And
indeed, until 1780 these countries produced vastly more raw cotton and
cotton textiles than Europe and North America. But then things changed.
European capitalists and states, with startling swiftness, moved to the
center of the cotton industry. They used their new position to ignite an
Industrial Revolution. China and India, along with many other parts of
the world, became ever more subservient to the Europe-centered empire of
cotton. These Europeans then used their dynamic cotton industry as a
platform to create other industries; indeed, cotton became the launching
pad for the broader Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Edward Baines, a newspaper proprietor in Leeds, called cotton in 1835
a “spectacle unparalleled in the annals of industry.” He argued that
analyzing this spectacle was “more worthy the pains of the student” than
the study of “wars and dynasties.” I agree. Following cotton, as we
shall see, will lead us to the origins of the modern world,
industrialization, rapid and continuous economic growth, enormous
productivity increase, and staggering social inequality. Historians,
social scientists, policy makers, and ideologues of all stripes have
tried to disentangle these origins. Particularly vexing is the question
of why, after many millennia of slow economic growth, a few strands of
humanity in the late eighteenth century suddenly got much richer.
Scholars now refer to these few decades as the “great divergence”—the
beginning of the vast divides that still structure today’s world, the
divide between those countries that industrialized and those that did
not, between colonizers and colonized, between the global North and the
global South. Grand arguments are easily made, some deeply pessimistic,
some hopeful. In this book, however, I take a global and fundamentally
historical approach to this puzzle: I begin by investigating the
industry that stood at the very beginning of the “great
divergence.”5</p>
<p>A focus on cotton and its very concrete and often brutal development,
casts doubt on several explanations that all too many observers tend to
take for granted: that Europe’s explosive economic development can be
explained by Europeans’ more rational religious beliefs, their
Enlightenment traditions, the climate in which they live, the
continent’s geography, or benign institutions such as the Bank of
England or the rule of law. Such essential and all too often
unchangeable attributes, however, cannot account for the history of the
cotton empire or explain the constantly shifting structure of
capitalism. And they are often also wrong. The first industrial nation,
Great Britain, was hardly a liberal, lean state with dependable but
impartial institutions as it is often portrayed. Instead it was an
imperial nation characterized by enormous military expenditures, a
nearly constant state of war, a powerful and interventionist
bureaucracy, high taxes, skyrocketing government debt, and protectionist
tariffs—and it was certainly not democratic. Accounts of the “great
divergence” that focus exclusively on conflicts between social classes
within particular regions or countries are just as flawed. This book, in
contrast, embraces a global perspective to show how Europeans united the
power of capital and the power of the state to forge, often violently, a
global production complex, and then used the capital, skills, networks,
and institutions of cotton to embark upon the upswing in technology and
wealth that defines the modern world. By looking at capitalism’s past,
this book offers a history of capitalism in action.6</p>
<p>Unlike much of what has been written on the history of capitalism,
Empire of Cotton does not search for explanations in just one part of
the world. It understands capitalism in the only way it can be properly
understood—in a global frame. The movement of capital, people, goods,
and raw materials around the globe and the connections forged between
distant areas of the world are at the very core of the grand
transformation of capitalism and they are at the core of this book.</p>
<p>Such a thorough and rapid re-creation of the world was possible only
because of the emergence of new ways of organizing production, trade,
and consumption. Slavery, the expropriation of indigenous peoples,
imperial expansion, armed trade, and the assertion of sovereignty over
people and land by entrepreneurs were at its core. I call this system
war capitalism.</p>
<p>We usually think of capitalism, at least the globalized,
mass-production type that we recognize today, as emerging around 1780
with the Industrial Revolution. But war capitalism, which began to
develop in the sixteenth century, came long before machines and
factories. War capitalism flourished not in the factory but in the
field; it was not mechanized but land- and labor-intensive, resting on
the violent expropriation of land and labor in Africa and the Americas.
From these expropriations came great wealth and new knowledge, and these
in turn strengthened European institutions and states—all crucial
preconditions for Europe’s extraordinary economic development by the
nineteeth century and beyond.</p>
<p>Many historians have called this the age of “merchant” or
“mercantile” capitalism, but “war capitalism” better expresses its
rawness and violence as well as its intimate connection to European
imperial expansion. War capitalism, a particularly important but often
unrecognized phase in the development of capitalism, unfolded in a
constantly shifting set of places embedded within constantly changing
relationships. In some parts of the world it lasted well into the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>When we think of capitalism, we think of wage workers, yet this prior
phase of capitalism was based not on free labor but on slavery. We
associate industrial capitalism with contracts and markets, but early
capitalism was based as often as not on violence and bodily coercion.
Modern capitalism privileges property rights, but this earlier moment
was characterized just as much by massive expropriations as by secure
ownership. Latter-day capitalism rests upon the rule of law and powerful
institutions backed by the state, but capitalism’s early phase, although
ultimately requiring state power to create world-spanning empires, was
frequently based on the unrestrained actions of private individuals—the
domination of masters over slaves and of frontier capitalists over
indigenous inhabitants. The cumulative result of this highly aggressive,
outwardly oriented capitalism was that Europeans came to dominate the
centuries-old worlds of cotton, merge them into a single empire centered
in Manchester, and invent the global economy we take for granted
today.</p>
<p>War capitalism, then, was the foundation from which evolved the more
familiar industrial capitalism, a capitalism characterized by powerful
states with enormous administrative, military, judicial, and
infrastructural capacities. At first, industrial capitalism remained
tightly linked to slavery and expropriated lands, but as its
institutions—everything from wage labor to property rights—gained
strength, they enabled a new and different form of integration of the
labor, raw materials, markets, and capital in huge swaths of the world.7
These new forms of integration drove the revolutions of capitalism into
ever more corners of the world.</p>
<p>As the modern world came of age, cotton came to dominate world trade.
Cotton factories towered above all other forms of European and North
American manufacturing. Cotton growing dominated the U.S. economy
throughout much of the nineteenth century. It was in cottons that new
modes of manufacturing first came about. The factory itself was an
invention of the cotton industry. So was the connection between slave
agriculture in the Americas and manufacturing across Europe. Because for
many decades cotton was the most important European industry, it was the
source of huge profits that eventually fed into other segments of the
European economy. Cotton also was the cradle of industrialization in
virtually every other part of the world—the United States and Egypt,
Mexico and Brazil, Japan and China. At the same time, Europe’s
domination of the world’s cotton industry resulted in a wave of
deindustrialization throughout much of the rest of the world, enabling a
new and different kind of integration into the global economy.</p>
<p>Yet even as the construction of industrial capitalism, beginning in
the United Kingdom in the 1780s and then spreading to continental Europe
and the United States in the early decades of the nineteenth century,
gave enormous power to the states that embraced it and to capitalists
within them, it planted the seeds of further transformation in the
empire of cotton. As industrial capitalism spread, capital itself became
tied to particular states. And as the state assumed an ever more central
role and emerged as the most durable, powerful, and rapidly expanding
institution of all, labor also grew in size and power. The dependence of
capitalists on the state, and the state’s dependence on its people,
empowered the workers who produced that capital, day in and day out, on
the factory floor. By the second half of the nineteenth century, workers
organized collectively, both in unions and political parties, and
slowly, over multiple decades, improved their wages and working
conditions. This, in turn, increased production costs, creating openings
for lower-cost producers in other parts of the world. By the turn of the
twentieth century, the model of industrial capitalism had traveled to
other countries and was embraced by their modernizing elites. As a
result, the cotton industry left Europe and New England and returned to
it origins in the global South.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why the claims made here for the empire of cotton do
not apply to other commodities. After all, before 1760, Europeans had
traded extensively in many commodities in the tropical and semitropical
areas of the world, including sugar, rice, rubber, and indigo. Unlike
these commodities, cotton, however, has two labor-intensive stages—one
in the fields, the other in factories. Sugar and tobacco did not create
large industrial proletariats in Europe. Cotton did. Tobacco did not
result in the rise of vast new manufacturing enterprises. Cotton did.
Indigo growing and processing did not create huge new markets for
European manufacturers. Cotton did. Rice cultivation in the Americas did
not lead to an explosion of both slavery and wage labor. Cotton did. As
a result, cotton spanned the globe unlike any other industry. Because of
the new ways it wove continents together, cotton provides the key to
understanding the modern world, the great inequalities that characterize
it, the long history of globalization, and the ever-changing political
economy of capitalism.</p>
<p>One reason it is hard to see cotton’s importance is because it has
often been overshadowed in our collective memory by images of coal
mines, railroads, and giant steelworks—industrial capitalism’s more
tangible, more massive manifestations. Too often, we ignore the
countryside to focus on the city and the miracles of modern industry in
Europe and North America while ignoring that very industry’s connection
to raw material producers and markets in all corners of the world. Too
often, we prefer to erase the realities of slavery, expropriation, and
colonialism from the history of capitalism, craving a nobler, cleaner
capitalism. We tend to recall industrial capitalism as male-dominated,
whereas women’s labor largely created the empire of cotton. Capitalism
was in many ways a liberating force, the foundation of much of
contemporary life; we are invested in it, not just economically but
emotionally and ideologically. Uncomfortable truths are sometimes easier
to ignore.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century observers, in contrast, were cognizant of cotton’s
role in reshaping the world. Some celebrated the amazing transformative
power of the new global economy. As a Manchester Cotton Supply Reporter
put it in 1860, rather breathlessly, “Cotton seems to have been destined
to take the lead among the numerous and vast agencies of the present
century, set in motion for human civilization. . . . Cotton with its
commerce has become one of the many modern ‘wonders of the
world.’ ”8</p>
<p>When you look at the cotton plant, it seems an unlikely candidate for
one of the wonders of the world. Humble and unremarkable, it grows in
many shapes and sizes. Prior to Europe’s creation of the empire of
cotton, different peoples in different parts of the world cultivated
plants quite unlike one another. South Americans tended to grow G.
barbadense, a small bushy tree that sprouted yellow flowers and produced
long-staple cotton. In India, by contrast, farmers grew G. arboretum, a
shrub about six feet in height, with yellow or purple flowers, producing
a short-staple fiber, while in Africa the very similar G. herbaceum
thrived. By the mid-nineteenth century, one type dominated the empire of
cotton— G. hirsutum—also known as American upland. Originating in
Central America, this variant, as described by Andrew Ure in 1836,
“rises to the height of two or three feet, and then divaricates into
boughs, which bristle with hairs. The leaves are also hairy on their
inferior surfaces, and are three- or five-lobed. The upper leaves are
entire and heart-shaped; the petioles are velvety. The flowers near the
extremities of the boughs are large, and somewhat dingy in colour. The
capsules are ovate, four-celled, nearly as large as an apple, and yield
a very fine silky cotton wool, much esteemed in commerce.”9</p>
<p>This fluffy white fiber is at the center of this book. The plant
itself does not make history, but if we listen carefully, it will tell
us of people all over the world who spent their lives with cotton:
Indian weavers, slaves in Alabama, Greek merchants in the Nile Delta
towns, highly organized craft workers in Lancashire. The empire of
cotton was built with their labor, imagination, and skills. By 1900
about 1.5 percent of the human population—millions of men, women, and
children—were engaged in the industry, either growing, transporting, or
manufacturing cotton. Edward Atkinson, a mid-nineteenth-century
Massachusetts cotton manufacturer, was essentially correct when he
pointed out that “there is no other product that has had so potent and
malign an influence in the past upon the history and institutions of the
land; and perhaps no other on which its future material welfare may more
depend.” Atkinson was speaking of the United States and its history of
slavery, but his argument could be applied to the world as a
whole.10</p>
<p>This book follows cotton from fields to boats, from merchant houses
to factories, from pickers to spinners to weavers to consumers. It does
not separate the cotton history of Brazil from that of the United
States, Great Britain’s from Togo’s, or Egypt’s from Japan’s. The empire
of cotton, and with it the modern world, is only understood by
connecting, rather than separating, the many places and people who
shaped and were in turn shaped by that empire.11</p>
<p>I am centrally concerned with the unity of the diverse. Cotton, the
nineteenth century’s chief global commodity, brought seeming opposites
together, turning them almost by alchemy into wealth: slavery and free
labor, states and markets, colonialism and free trade, industrialization
and deindustrialization. The cotton empire depended on plantation and
factory, slavery and wage labor, colonizers and colonized, railroads and
steamships—in short, on a global network of land, labor, transport,
manufacture, and sale. The Liverpool Cotton Exchange had an enormous
impact on Mississippi cotton planters, the Alsatian spinning mills were
tightly linked to those of Lancashire, and the future of handloom
weavers in New Hampshire or Dhaka depended on such diverse factors as
the construction of a railroad between Manchester and Liverpool,
investment decisions of Boston merchants, and tariff policies made in
Washington and London. The power of the Ottoman state over its
countryside affected the development of slavery in the West Indies; the
political activities of recently freed slaves in the United States
affected the lives of rural cultivators in India.12</p>
<p>From these volatile opposites, we see how cotton made possible both
the birth of capitalism and its subsequent reinvention. As we explore
the twinned paths of cotton and capitalism across the world, and the
centuries, we are reminded again and again that no state of capitalism
is ever permanent or stable. Each new moment in capitalism’s history
produces new instabilities, and even contradictions, prompting vast
spatial, social, and political rearrangements.</p>
<p>Writing about cotton has a long history. Indeed, cotton might be the
most fully researched of all human industries. Libraries are filled with
accounts of slave plantations in the Americas, the beginnings of cotton
manufacturing in Britain, France, the German lands, and Japan, and the
merchants who connected one to the other. Much less common are efforts
to link these diverse histories; in fact, what is perhaps the most
successful such effort is now nearly two centuries old. When Edward
Baines penned his History of the Cotton Manufacture in Great Britain in
1835, he concluded that “the author may be permitted to express…that his
subject derives interest not merely from the magnitude of the branch of
industry he has attempted to describe, but from the wonderful extent of
intercourse which it has established between this country and every part
of the globe.”13 I share Baines’s enthusiasm and his global perspective,
if not all of his conclusions.</p>
<p>As a Leeds newspaper editor living close to the center of the empire
of cotton, Baines could not help but take a global perspective on these
matters.14 However, when professional historians turned to cotton, they
almost always focused on local, regional, and national aspects of this
history. Yet only a global viewpoint allows us to understand the great
realignment that each of these local stories was part of—the huge global
shifts in labor regimes in agriculture, the spread of
state-strengthening projects by nationalist elites, and the impact of
working-class collective action, among others.</p>
<p>This book draws on the vast literature on cotton, but places it in a
new framework. As a result, it contributes to a vibrant but often
stultifyingly presentist conversation on globalization. Empire of Cotton
challenges excited discoveries of an allegedly new, global phase in the
history of capitalism. It shows that capitalism has been globe-spanning
since its inception and that fluid spatial configurations of the world
economy have been a common feature of the last three hundred years. The
book argues also that for most of capitalism’s history the process of
globalization and the needs of nation-states were not conflicting, as is
often believed, but instead mutually reinforced one another. If our
allegedly new global age is truly a revolutionary departure from the
past, the departure is not the degree of global connection but the fact
that capitalists are for the first time able to emancipate themselves
from particular nation-states, the very institutions that in the past
enabled their rise.</p>
<p>As its subtitle suggests, Empire of Cotton is also part of a larger
conversation among historians trying to rethink history by looking at it
within a transnational, even global, spatial frame. History as a
profession emerged hand in hand with the nation-state, and played an
important part in its constitution. But by assuming national
perspectives, historians have often underemphasized connections that
transcend state borders, settling for explanations that can be drawn
from events, people, and processes within particular national
territories. This book is intended as a contribution to efforts to
balance such “national” perspectives with a broader focus on the
networks, identities, and processes that transcend political
boundaries.15</p>
<p>By focusing on one specific commodity—cotton—and tracing how it was
grown, transported, financed, manufactured, sold, and consumed, we are
able to see connections between peoples and places that would remain on
the margins if we embarked upon a more traditional study bounded by
national borders. Instead of focusing on the history of a particular
event, such as the American Civil War, or place, such as the cotton
factories of Osaka, or group of people, such as West Indian slaves
growing cotton, or process, such as rural cultivators turning into
industrial wage workers, this book uses the biography of one product as
a window into some of the most significant questions we can ask about
the history of our world and to reinterpret a history of huge
consequence: the history of capitalism.16</p>
<p>We are about to embark on a journey through five thousand years of
human history. Throughout this book, we will look at a single, seemingly
inconsequential item—cotton—to solve a vast mystery: Where does the
modern world originate? Let’s begin by traveling to a small farming
village in what is today Mexico, where cotton plants bloom in a world
utterly unlike our own.</p>
