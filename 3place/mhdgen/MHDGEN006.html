Capturing Labor, Conquering Land</h4>
<p>Capturing land: Christopher Columbus arriving on Hispaniola, 1492
(illustration credit 4.1)</p>
<p>We are far remote from the period when men lived, and died, like
plants, in the spot where destiny had produced them…. But of all the
travels originating in curiosity, ambition, or the love of lucre, not
one can be compared in the importance of its results, its extent, or the
influence which it had exerted, to the mere transport of the produce of
a weak shrub,—to the travels which industry has imposed upon the wool of
a cotton-tree, the metamorphoses of which are as innumerable as our
wants and desires.1</p>
<p>—Asiatic Journal, 1826</p>
<p>In 1857, the British economist John T. Danson published his attempt
to disentangle the history of the modern cotton textile industry. On the
mystery of the “connection between American Slavery and the British
Cotton Manufacture,” he noted that “there is not, and never has been,
any considerable source of supply for cotton, excepting the East-Indies,
which is not obviously and exclusively maintained by slave-labour.”
Efforts to cultivate cotton with free labor had largely failed, he
observed, lending support to his conclusion that “as far as yet appears,
[cotton] must continue to be grown, chiefly by slave-labour.” So
ironclad, argued Danson, was the connection between slave labor in the
United States and a prospering European cotton industry that “I cannot
but deem it superfluous to say one word” about “modifying the existing
system.”2</p>
<p>At first glance, Danson seemed correct. The year his essay was
published, a full 68 percent of all cotton arriving in the United
Kingdom came from the United States, and slaves grew most of it. Yet the
reality that seemed so self-evident to Danson and others was only a
recent invention. Indeed, in the five thousand years of the history of
the world’s cotton industry, slavery had never played an important role.
And it was not just slavery that was new. The emerging cotton complex
centered in Europe was also unique because it did not draw on the
production of nearby peasants for its raw materials. As late as 1791,
most of the cotton grown for manufacturing purposes around the world was
produced by small farmers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and
consumed locally.3 When cotton manufacturing exploded in Great Britain,
it was unclear where enough cotton would come from to feed its hungry
factories. Yet despite these challenges, never before had an industry
grown so large so fast. Indeed, it grew as large as it did, as fast as
it did, not despite but because of its peculiar spatial arrangements and
its ability to draw on slave labor.</p>
<p>In the crucible of the late-eighteenth-century cotton revolution,
cotton built its last, but most decisive, link to the newly global,
dynamic, and violent form of capitalism, whose signal feature was the
coercive expropriation of land and labor. Necessitated by the yawning
gap between the imperatives of mechanized manufacturing and the
capacities of premodern agriculture, at its core was slavery.4 Rapidly
expanding factories consumed cotton so fast that only the exigencies of
war capitalism could secure the necessary reallocation of land and
labor. As a result, indigenous people and land-grabbing settlers, slaves
and planters, local artisans and factory owners woke to a new century
clouded by a constant, if one-sided, state of war. As Danson had
understood so well, it was coercion that opened fresh lands and
mobilized new labor, becoming the essential ingredient of the emerging
empire of cotton—and thus an essential ingredient in forging industrial
capitalism. Yet by projecting the world he lived in both backward and
forward, Danson missed both the novelty of slavery’s essential role and
the possibility that it could come to an end.</p>
<p>For millennia, as we have seen, cultivators had grown cotton in Asia,
Africa, and the Americas. But while the cotton plant found a favorable
environment in large stretches of the world’s arable lands, Lancashire,
or anywhere else in the British Isles for that matter, was not among
them. Outside of the greenhouses at the Royal Gardens at Kew (which to
this day showcase the core commodities on which the British Empire
rested), Britain and much of Europe was too cold and wet for cotton.
Among European leaders, only French revolutionaries, with their fervent
belief in inventing the world anew, seriously tried to outwit the local
climate and grow cotton—and even they failed.5</p>
<p>Indeed, British cotton manufacturing—and later, manufacturing across
Europe—seemed a poor bet, for it was the first major industry in human
history that lacked locally procured raw materials. In the United
Kingdom, woolen and linen manufacturers had relied on Scottish sheep and
English flax, the iron industry had used Sheffield iron ore, and the
pottery manufacturers had worked up clay found in Staffordshire. Cotton
spinning and weaving was different, with British manufacturers entirely
dependent upon imports. To flourish, they required not just Asian
technologies and African markets, but also raw material from yet another
continent. Managing to acquire these materials meant building the first
globally integrated manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Yet in 1780, even as mechanical innovations occurred at a remarkable
pace, a key piece of this global integration—the actual supply of
cotton—remained undiscovered. The solution that emerged—slaves in the
southern United States growing cotton on land expropriated from Native
Americans—was far from obvious from the perspective of British cotton
manufacturers and merchants. After all, in 1780 no cotton whatsoever
arrived from North America. Instead, manufacturers drew on a far-flung
network of small-scale suppliers to feed their mills. In the ports of
London and Liverpool, bags of the “white gold” arrived from Izmir and
Thessaloniki in the Ottoman Empire, from Port-au-Prince and Port Royal
in the Caribbean, from Bombay in India and the Gold Coast in Africa. Raw
cotton had traveled comparable routes for many centuries, within Asia,
Africa, and the Americas, as well as between Asia and Europe. Syrian
cotton had been spun and woven in Egypt, Maharashtra cotton in Bengal,
Hainan cotton in Jiangnan, Anatolian cotton in Lucerne, Yucatecan cotton
in Teotihuacán, and Macedonian cotton in Venice.6</p>
<p>By 1780, the surging production speeds of spinning machines in
British factories increasingly strained this traditional nexus. British
manufacturers spun about 5.1 million pounds of cotton in 1781, only
about two and a half times as much as they had spun eighty-four years
earlier. But a mere nine years later in 1790, that figure had multiplied
six times. By 1800, the quantity had nearly doubled again to 56 million
pounds. In France, growth was slower but nonetheless remarkable: In
1789, 4.3 times more cotton was consumed than in 1750, 11 million
pounds. Rapidly falling yarn prices created ever larger groups of
consumers, especially in Europe, where cotton, once a luxury product
only accessible to the rich, could now be consumed by the many, and in
Africa, where it would replace the products of Indian spinners. The
increased consumption of raw cotton, as Leeds writer Edward Baines noted
in 1835, “has been rapid and steady far beyond all precedents in any
other manufacture.”7</p>
<p>As demand for raw cotton rose, so too did prices. In 1781, prices for
cotton in Britain were between two and three times higher than they had
been a decade earlier. Manchester manufacturers were “quite convinced
that unless some new source of supply could be found the progress of the
rising industry would be checked, if not altogether arrested.” As a
result, “From the 1780s they formed a powerful and influential group in
their efforts to acquaint the planters and the British government with
their requirements.”8</p>
<p>This sudden and unprecedented demand for cotton, and the lucrative
prices paid for it, according to a contemporary expert, “occasioned a
most extraordinary Increase of Culture in every Part, wherever the
Climate and Soil could produce it; and, on this Account, every Sinew in
the commercial World was strained to supply our Wants.” Ottoman growers,
who for the past two hundred years had been a major source of raw cotton
for Europe, could not satisfy this exploding demand. Indeed, throughout
the 1780s, exports from Thessaloniki and Izmir remained nearly level. A
severe labor shortage and the tenacity of feudal relations in the
Ottoman countryside limited the supply from Anatolia and Macedonia. The
labor shortage was such that beginning in the 1770s landowners in
western Anatolia brought in thousands of Greek laborers to grow
cotton—an expansion that still did not provide the scale necessary for
the supply of European industry. The largely precapitalist dependencies
that structured the world of rural cultivators, the efforts of peasants
to secure their subsistence, the lack of transportation infrastructure,
and the continued political independence of the Ottoman state
contributed to Europeans’ inability to press for the monocultural
production of cotton. A rapid reallocation of land and labor for cotton
planting proved impossible. Local elites, moreover, remained a powerful
counterweight against the increasingly influential presence of Western
merchants in port cities such as Izmir and Thessaloniki, hampering the
ability of Western capitalists to reform the social structure in the
countryside to produce more cotton for world markets. Western merchants
were also competing for what cotton there was with domestic spinners, a
sizable and relatively prosperous artisan class. As a result, Ottoman
cotton soon became marginal to European markets: while between 1786 and
1790 the Ottoman Empire supplied 20 percent of cotton imports to Great
Britain, twenty years later it supplied only 1.28 percent and another
ten years later a minuscule 0.29 percent. Unable or unwilling to
revolutionize their countryside and trade networks, Ottoman cotton
farmers and merchants exited the emerging European industrial
system.9</p>
<p>With this traditional source of cotton production insufficient to
meet demand, manufacturers desperately looked elsewhere. Cotton merchant
William Rathbone and cotton spinner Richard Arkwright, for example,
embarked upon a failed effort to increase the cotton supply from Africa
by creating the Sierra Leone Company. Manufacturers also cast an
acquisitive eye toward India’s bountiful cotton harvests. Given that the
East India Company enjoyed significant power on the subcontinent and
that India was the ancient home of the world’s cotton industry, many
expected it to become a major source of fiber. The company, however,
reacted warily to Manchester’s appeals. The export of raw cotton, they
argued, would undermine manufacturing in India and therefore its own
profitable export business of cotton cloth. “If the Manufactures of
Bengal were to suffer any material Check,” warned the East India Company
in 1793, “and become considerable decreased, the Revenue of that Country
would fall off, and its Population decline beyond the Power of
Prevention; for it is not to be expected that even any considerable
Encrease in the Cultivation of raw Materials could become an equivalent
for a material Reduction in the Extent and Encouragement of
Manufactures.”10 Moreover, such production for export would make
peasants unduly dependent on purchasing food grains on the market,
“which in an Indifferent Seasin might bring in a scarcity of Grain, nay
even a famine, which would bring desolation on the Country, and an
annihilation of Revenue.”11 Whatever cotton there was available for
export the East India Company shipped to China to finance its purchases
of tea, replacing the need to export bullion there. The resistance of
the East India Company compounded other difficulties: infrastructure
that made moving cotton to the coast often prohibitively expensive, the
quality of Indian cotton, especially its short fiber, and a lack of
labor in the vast interior of the South Asian subcontinent. In short,
Indian cotton exports to Britain proved insufficient to satisfy the
growing demand.12</p>
<p>More promising than in India, Africa, or Anatolia, it seemed, was the
situation in the West Indies and South America. The exploding demand for
cotton was no secret to the region’s white planters, who had grown small
quantities of the fiber since the 1630s. As demand for cotton increased,
West Indian and South American merchants increasingly added cotton
shipments to their regular trade in sugar and other tropical
commodities. They also integrated it with their trade in slaves, as in
the case of Liverpool’s Tarleton Brothers, whose trade in cotton was at
first just a sideline to their trade in human beings.</p>
<p>With fortunes to be made, European merchants in the Caribbean tried
to secure more of the white gold. They drew on Caribbean planters who,
unlike growers in Africa, Anatolia, and India, had nearly two centuries
of experience growing crops for European consumers, most importantly
sugar. The planters also controlled two key elements: land suitable for
cotton growing and long-standing experience in mobilizing labor to
produce for world markets. In the boom years of the 1770s through the
1790s, cotton was especially attractive to two up-and-coming groups of
planters. The first consisted of small growers who lacked the capital
necessary to start a sugar plantation and wanted a crop that would let
them work more marginal lands, with fewer slaves and less investment,
and still make fabulous profits. On Saint-Croix, for example, the
average cotton plantation drew on the labor of less than a fifth as many
slaves as the average sugar plantation. The second group consisted of
planters in newly settled territories who planted cotton as a first crop
for a few seasons to break the soil and would then use the cotton
profits to move into sugar.13</p>
<p>Collectively, hundreds of these planters opened up a new “commodity
frontier”—a new cotton-producing territory—and with it they began a new
chapter in the global history of cotton. As a result of their decisions
and the efforts of their slaves, cotton exports from the Caribbean
exploded. Between 1781 and 1791, cotton imports quadrupled from the
British-controlled islands alone. French planters followed suit,
doubling exports of what French manufacturers called “coton des Isles”
from Saint-Domingue, the Caribbean’s most important cotton island, to
France between 1781 and 1791.14 So rapid was the growth of Caribbean
cotton that by 1800 Bahamian planter Nathan Hall reported in awe that
the cotton “trade has increased amazingly.”15</p>
<p>Caribbean cotton came from various sites. Those islands that had been
at the forefront of cotton production earlier in the century—Jamaica,
Grenada, and Dominica, for example—continued to produce cotton, but
their exports remained nearly constant at around two million pounds
during the 1770s, and then approximately doubled during the course of
the 1780s. The increase in production was (relatively) modest because
cotton had found a stable place in the local economy and because sugar
cultivation, which required a significant financial investment, was
hardly ever given up for cotton.</p>
<p>But on islands with more uncultivated land and fewer sugar
plantations, production boomed. On Barbados between 1768 and 1789,
cotton exports increased by a factor of eleven, from 240,000 pounds to
2.6 million pounds. First, an ant invasion had decimated Barbados’s
traditional crop, sugar. Then in 1780 a massive hurricane destroyed much
of the island’s sugar infrastructure, which could not easily be rebuilt
because of limited access to raw materials from revolution-torn North
America. Transformed essentially into a huge cotton plantation, Barbados
became the most productive cotton island within the British Empire.
Similarly, Tobago planters had exported no cotton in 1770 but shipped a
full 1.5 million pounds in 1780. And planters in the Bahamas, who had
grown virtually no cotton before the 1770s, by 1787 sold nearly half a
million pounds to British merchants.16</p>
<p>Significant amounts of cotton also found their way to Britain from
the French Caribbean islands. There, British merchants profited both
from the slower growth of the French cotton industry and the abundant
imports of slaves to Saint-Domingue above all. In 1770, for example, the
French islands produced an estimated 56 percent of the total Caribbean
cotton crop, compared to 35 percent for the British. Saint-Domingue
alone shipped 36 percent, or more than all the British islands taken
together. Twenty years later the imbalance continued. Of the 14 million
pounds of cotton that the French islands produced in 1789, only about 6
million pounds were consumed in France itself, while an estimated 5.7
million pounds were exported from French mainland ports to Great
Britain.17</p>
<p>The Caribbean cotton revolution: West Indian cotton shipments to the
United Kingdom, 1750–1795, in million of pounds (illustration credit
4.2)</p>
<p>As the dependence on cotton produced on the French-controlled islands
grew among Europe’s cotton manufacturers, Saint-Domingue in particular
took on a central role. In 1791, the island, which counted nearly as
many cotton as sugar plantations, exported 6.8 million pounds of cotton
to France, 58 percent more than eight years earlier, and substantial
amounts to Britain. This rapid expansion of cotton production was fueled
by the importation of a quarter million African slaves between 1784 and
1791. At the height of the cotton boom, in the 1780s, as cotton prices
in France increased by 113 percent over 1770 levels, nearly thirty
thousand slaves were shipped to Saint-Domingue annually. That elasticity
of the labor supply, a hallmark of war capitalism, was unmatched by any
other region of the world. Indeed, as mechanized spinning spread on the
European continent, ever more Africans were put in shackles, forced into
the holds of ships, sold on the auction block in Port-au-Prince,
transported to remote farms, and then forced to clear the land and hoe,
sow, prune, and harvest the white gold.18</p>
<p>Slavery, in other words, was as essential to the new empire of cotton
as proper climate and good soil. It was slavery that allowed these
planters to respond rapidly to rising prices and expanding markets.
Slavery allowed not only for the mobilization of very large numbers of
workers on very short notice, but also for a regime of violent
supervision and virtually ceaseless exploitation that matched the needs
of a crop that was, in the cold language of economists, “effort
intensive.”19 Tellingly, many of the slaves who were doing the
backbreaking labor to grow cotton had been and were still being sold for
cotton cloth that the European East India companies shipped from various
parts of India to western Africa.</p>
<p>Encouraged by their home governments, rising prices, the availability
of labor, and, within bounds, land, Caribbean planters became the
cutting edge of the cotton revolution. From that moment on, ever newer
cotton frontiers replaced one another, motivated by the unrelenting
search for land and labor, as well as soils that had yet to escape the
ecological exhaustion that so often came with cotton growing. The
world’s cotton industry relied upon “restless spatial expansion.”20</p>
<p>Caribbean planters had lengthy experience growing cotton—but so had
Ottoman and Indian farmers. The soil and climate of the Caribbean was
well suited to cotton—but so was the soil of western Anatolia or central
India. Caribbean merchants moved large quantities of cotton easily to
European markets—but so did the merchants of Izmir and Surat. Yet
Caribbean planters, unlike Ottoman and Indian farmers, faced few
constraints on land and labor. With the native population decimated and
slaves arriving on an almost daily basis from West Africa, Caribbean
planters’ ability to respond rapidly to newly emerging markets set them
decisively apart from all other cotton growers. While powerful Ottoman
and Indian landlords also resorted to coercion to force peasants to work
on their cotton estates, plantation slavery, as such, never took root.21
Moreover, the infusion of capital that enabled the rapid reallocation of
resources in the Caribbean was hampered elsewhere by the lack of private
ownership of land and the continued political strength of the Ottoman
and Indian rulers. Fresh land and new labor, capitalized by virtually
unrestrained European merchants, bankers, and planters, precipitated an
explosion of cotton growing.</p>
<p>These factors were supplemented by the support, albeit mild, that
planters received from their government. Already in 1768 the British
Royal Society of the Arts had offered a gold medal “for the best
Specimen of West-India cotton,” which was claimed ten years later by
Andrew Bennet of Tobago, who had spent years studying dozens if not
hundreds of varieties of cotton. In 1780, the British government levied
a tariff on cotton imported on foreign boats, the “proceeds to be
devoted to the encouragement of the growth of cotton in his Majesty’s
Leeward Islands, and for encouraging the import thereof into Great
Britain.” Later, the British Board of Trade asked a Polish botanist,
Anton Pantaleon Hove, to collect cottonseeds in India and forward them
to the Caribbean. And in 1786, Lord Sydney, secretary of state for the
colonies, pressured by manufacturers in Manchester, called upon the
governors of the West Indian colonies to encourage planters to grow
cotton. In response, the governor of Dominica, John Orde, went so far as
to promise free land to individuals interested in planting cotton on the
island. Such state support would have seemed inconsequential viewed from
the vantage point of the late nineteenth century, yet it pointed to a
future in which the state’s involvement in the global securing of
essential raw materials for industrial production would become a
widespread concern.22</p>
<p>But the true importance of the Caribbean planters was not the cotton
that was shipped, though that remained essential, but the institutional
innovation that the Caribbean experiment produced: the re-creation of
the countryside through bodily coercion, something only possible under
war capitalism. Cotton grown by slaves motivated and financed the
unprecedented incorporation of newly depopulated territories into the
world economy. Slavery and land expropriation on a continental scale
created the expansive, and elastic, global cotton supply network
necessary for the Industrial Revolution, and with it the mechanisms
through which the needs and rhythms of industrial life in Europe could
be transferred to the global countryside. In the process, a new kind of
slavery (what historians have called “second slavery”) emerged that was
tightly linked to the intensity and profits of industrial capitalism—a
dynamic that soon drew the African continent into its grasp as well,
where West African economies increasingly found their focus in supplying
sharply rising numbers of workers to the Americas. Approximately half of
all slaves (46 percent, to be precise) sold to the Americas between 1492
and 1888 arrived there in the years after 1780. Slavery’s future was now
firmly attached to the industrial capitalism that it had enabled.23</p>

<p>As the Caribbean cotton explosion shows, war capitalism—exactly
because violence was its fundamental characteristic—was portable. Its
next stop was South America. With cotton exports from the West Indies
rapidly rising but demand spiraling even faster, South American farmers
discovered the newly profitable cotton market. In Guyana, between 1789
and 1802 cotton production skyrocketed by a staggering 862 percent,
fueled by the concurrent import of about twenty thousand slaves into
Surinam and Demerara.24</p>
<p>Even more important was Brazil. The first Brazilian cotton arrived in
England in 1781, supplementing Caribbean production but soon surpassing
it. Cotton was indigenous to many parts of Brazil, and for centuries its
planters had exported small quantities. As part of the process of
economic modernization of its Brazilian colonies in the latter half of
the eighteenth century, Portugal had encouraged the growing of cotton,
especially in the northeastern regions of Pernambuco and Maranhão. When
early efforts paid off, a surge in the importation of slaves caused one
observer to opine that “white cotton turned Maranhão black.” Though
cotton would eventually become a “poor man’s crop,” its first explosive
expansion in Brazil was fueled by larger slave plantations. As in the
West Indies, cotton in Brazil would never challenge sugar and later
coffee, but its share of total exports in Brazil grew to a respectable
11 percent in 1800, and 20 percent in the years between 1821 and
1830.25</p>
<p>Without any constraints on the availability of land, as in the West
Indies, or on labor, as in Anatolia, the volume of Brazilian cotton
expanded sharply. Between 1785 and 1792, Brazil overtook the Ottoman
Empire in cotton shipments to England. By the end of that period, nearly
8 million pounds of Brazilian cotton had landed in Great Britain,
compared to 4.5 million pounds from the Ottoman Empire and 12 million
pounds from the West Indies. In Maranhão—then the most important cotton
region of Brazil—exports doubled between 1770 and 1780, nearly doubled
again by 1790, and nearly tripled once more by 1800. For a few years in
the late 1700s, the period when neither West Indian nor Ottoman cotton
production had expanded sufficiently and before North American cotton
swamped markets, Brazil became a very important supplier to the booming
British cotton textile industry. Not only did Brazilian farmers produce
significant amounts of cotton, but they were also able to grow a
particularly long-staple variety that was better suited to emerging
factory technology.26</p>
<p>By the 1780s, slaves in the West Indies and South America produced
the vast majority of cotton sold on world markets, and this explosive
combination of slavery and conquest fueled the Industrial Revolution all
the way to 1861. John Tarleton, a successful slave trader and Liverpool
cotton merchant, understood that the slave trade, the export of
commodities from plantation economies, and the well-being of the British
shipping industry were all “mutually blended andandandand connected
together.” And the combination was stupendously profitable: Cotton and
slaves made many merchants rich, with Tarleton calculating, for example,
that his “fortune” had tripled between 1770 and 1800.27</p>
<p>The risks and costs entailed in the development of its globe-spanning
system of supply might have seemed an insurmountable brake on the cotton
industry’s development. Yet the cotton manufacturers’ total dependence
on a distant tropical commodity turned out to be their signal
breakthrough. Indeed, their factories would likely never have expanded
as rapidly without the counterintuitive gamble of relying entirely on
faraway land and labor. Already by 1800, Britain alone consumed such
fabulous amounts of cotton that 416,081 acres of land were needed to
cultivate it. If that cotton had been grown in Britain, it would have
taken up 3.7 percent of its arable land, and approximately 90,360
agricultural laborers would have been needed to work these hypothetical
cotton fields. In 1860, with the appetite for cotton even greater, more
than 1 million workers (or half of all British agricultural workers)
would have had to work these fields, which would have taken up 6.3
million acres or 37 percent of all arable land in Great Britain.
Alternatively, if we assume that the woolen industry, instead of the
cotton industry, had been at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution
even more land would have been needed to raise the required number of
sheep: 9 million acres in 1815, and 23 million acres in 1830—or more
than Britain’s entire arable land area. Under both the hypothetical
domestic cotton and the wool scenario, land and labor constraints would
have made all but impossible the sudden expansion of cloth production.
Perhaps even more decisively, such a scenario would have created
unimaginable upheaval in the British and European countryside, whose
social structure, like that of the Ottoman Empire and India, was not
suited for such a massive and quick reallocation of land and labor. The
elasticity of supply so essential to the Industrial Revolution thereby
rested on reliable access to distant land and foreign labor. The ability
of Europe’s states and their capitalists to rearrange global economic
connections and to violently expropriate land and labor were as
important, if not more important, to the ascendency of the West as the
traditional explanations of technical inventiveness, cultural
proclivities, and the geographical and climatic location of a small
group of cotton manufacturers in a remote part of the British
Isles.28</p>
<p>West Indian and South American cotton thus poured into the markets of
Liverpool, London, Le Havre, and Barcelona, in effect allowing for the
rapid expansion of mechanized spinning. But there were limits to this
expansion. As already mentioned, the West Indian islands themselves had
a rather low supply of suitable cotton lands, limiting cotton production
and putting it at a long-term disadvantage with sugar. Sugar plantations
there as well as in land-rich Brazil also competed with cotton
plantations for labor. As a result, beginning in 1790, exports of West
Indian cotton declined absolutely: In 1803 only about half as much
cotton left the West Indies as in 1790, and its market share in Britain
was now reduced to 10 percent. Even preferential treatment at customs,
which British-grown cotton was afforded after 1819, could not reverse
the tide. By the early nineteenth century, the market share of West
Indian cotton was in free fall, “accelerated by the emancipation of the
negroes.” In Brazil, the lack of a massive redeployment of slaves from
sugar into cotton production acted as a brake on the expansion of cotton
production. As cotton expert James A. Mann observed, “If Brazil could
command the needful labour, there is no question but that she would
become a large supplier of our wants.”29</p>
<p>In 1791, revolution rocked the most important cotton island of
all—Saint-Domingue—all but halting production of commodities for world
markets, including cotton. In the largest slave revolt in history,
Saint-Domingue’s enslaved population armed themselves and defeated the
French colonial regime, leading to the creation of the state of Haiti
and the abolition of slavery on the island. War capitalism had its first
major reversal at the hands of its seemingly least powerful actors:
Saint-Domingue’s hundreds of thousands of slaves. Saint-Domingue cotton
production had equaled 24 percent of British cotton imports the year
before the revolution, while four years later, in 1795, it was only 4.5
percent. As one British observer put it, “That Island, which has been
the grand Source of Supply to us, of the Article of Cotton Wool, is,
from these Causes, in a State of Anarchy, Distress, and almost
Dissolution.” Indeed, he predicted that it was unlikely that “the Soil
of the Planters, fertilized by the Thirst and Blood of the Negroes, will
always increase the Store of our Coffers, in order to add to the Excess
of your Wealth, Extravagance and Voluptuousness.” By 1795, cotton
exports to France had fallen by 79 percent, and even ten years after the
beginning of the revolution, exports had recovered to only one-third of
their prerevolutionary level. The French National Assembly compounded
British supply anxieties by disallowing the export of raw cotton from
French ports. The Pennsylvania Gazette in 1792 reported
matter-of-factly, “The cotton and indigo…must have been deeply injured
in 1791, as they were in season during the part of that year when the
disturbances were greatest.”30</p>
<p>The combination of rapidly rising demand for cotton and political
upheaval in the Caribbean led to worrisome price spikes for
manufacturers dependent on capturing new markets for cotton textiles by
competing with Indian production. Throughout 1791 and 1792 John Tarleton
reported to his brother that “Cotton is rising daily.” By 1795 he found
“Cotton up amazingly.” In 1790, prices for West Indian cotton peaked at
21 pence per pound, in 1791 at 30 pence, and prices stayed consistently
high throughout the 1790s. So traumatic was the experience of revolution
for some cotton merchants that as late as 1913 the Rathbone family, one
of Liverpool’s major cotton traders, remembered that the effect of the
upheaval was a doubling of prices for cotton. Once war broke out between
France and Britain in 1793, moreover, the import of French West Indian
cottons into the British Caribbean ports came to an end.31</p>
<p>By the 1790s, therefore, it had become obvious to interested
observers that the gap between the demand for and supply of raw cotton
in Europe would grow rapidly and continuously for the foreseeable
future. As the American writer Tench Coxe put it, “The peculiar fitness
of the staple for the conversion into yarn, cloths, andandandandc. by
machinery…have hitherto made these demands, at home and abroad, very
extensive, steady, and increasing.”32 Traditional techniques of
procuring cotton had clearly been insufficient. In the West Indies and
Brazil, however, building on the experiences of their sugar economies, a
new way of producing cotton had been invented that focused clearly on
plantations and slavery. And while the production growth in these parts
of the world soon reached their limits, or, as in Haiti’s case, was
curtailed by revolution, there was a nearby region that seemed to meet
all conditions for producing an abundant supply of cotton: the newly
born United States of America. It was there that cotton production based
on slavery would reach unprecedented heights.</p>
