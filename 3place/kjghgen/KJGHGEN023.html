“Silicon Valley Has a Harvard Problem,” February 12, 2024), and the
Washington Post (Karp and Zamiska, “New Weapons Will Eclipse Atomic
Bombs,” June 25, 2024).</p>
<p>Chapter One: Lost Valley</p>
<p>This early dependence of Silicon Valley: See Stuart W. Leslie, “The
Biggest ‘Angel’ of Them All: The Military and the Making of Silicon
Valley,” in Understanding Silicon Valley: The Anatomy of an
Entrepreneurial Region, ed. Martin Kenney (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford
University Press, 2000), 49 (noting that, “[m]issing in virtually every
account of freewheeling entrepreneurs and visionary venture capitalists
is the military’s role, intentional and otherwise, in creating and
sustaining Silicon Valley”).</p>

<p>In the 1940s, the federal government: See, for example, Roswell
Quinn, “Rethinking Antibiotic Research and Development: World War II and

Military Research Programs in the Development of U.S. Food and Drug
Administration–Approved Antimalarial Drugs,” Clinical Infectious
Diseases 43, no. 1 (July 2006).</p>

<p>Indeed, Silicon Valley once stood: See also Arthur Herman, Freedom’s
Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II (New York:

industrial production in service of the country’s military aims during
World War II); Walter Isaacson, The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers,
Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution (New York: Simon

<p>For a time after: Thomas Heinrich, “Cold War Armory: Military
Contracting in Silicon Valley,” Enterprise andandandand Society 3, no. 2
(June 2002): 247 (noting that “Santa Clara County…produced all of the
United States Navy’s intercontinental ballistic missiles, the bulk of
its reconnaissance satellites and tracking systems, and a wide range of
microelectronics that became integral components of high-tech weapons
and weapons systems”).</p>

achievements—whether bridges, skyscrapers, or common household
appliances—became the backdrop of everyday life at the same time that
engineers were adopted as symbols of progress and prosperity”).</p>

not succeed in maintaining the requisite level of mass loyalty while the
steering imperatives taken over from the economic system are carried
through”).</p>

<p>When emerging technologies: Habermas explained, “Even if the state
apparatus were to succeed in raising the productivity of labor and in
distributing gains in productivity in such a way that an economic growth
free of crises…were guaranteed, growth would still be achieved in accord
with priorities that take shape as a function, not of generalizable
interests of the population, but of private goals.” Habermas,
Legitimation Crisis, 73.</p>

<p>In this way, the willingness: See also Raymond Plant, “Jürgen
Habermas and the Idea of Legitimation Crisis,” European Journal of
Political Research 10 (1982): 343 (noting that “capitalism has built up
expectations about consumption, and these have increased pressures on
governments to steer the economy to produce more goods”).</p>
