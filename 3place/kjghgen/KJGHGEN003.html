<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This book is the product of a nearly decade-long conversation between
its authors regarding technology, our national project, and the perilous
political and cultural challenges that we collectively face.</p>
<p>A moment of reckoning has arrived for the West. The loss of national
ambition and interest in the potential of science and technology, and
resulting decline of government innovation across sectors, from medicine
to space travel to military software, have created an innovation gap.
The state has retreated from the pursuit of the kind of large-scale
breakthroughs that gave rise to the atomic bomb and the internet, ceding
the challenge of developing the next wave of pathbreaking technologies
to the private sector—a remarkable and near-total placement of faith in
the market. Silicon Valley, meanwhile, turned inward, focusing its
energy on narrow consumer products, rather than projects that speak to
and address our greater security and welfare.</p>
<p>The current digital age has been dominated by online advertising and
shopping, as well as social media and video-sharing platforms. The
grandiose rallying cry of a generation of founders in Silicon Valley was
simply to build. Few asked what needed to be built, and why. For
decades, we have taken this focus—and indeed obsession in many cases—by
the technology industry on consumer culture for granted, hardly
questioning the direction, and we think misdirection, of capital and
talent to the trivial and ephemeral. Much of what passes for innovation
today, of what attracts enormous amounts of talent and funding, will be
forgotten before the decade is out.</p>
<p>The market is a powerful engine of destruction, creative and
otherwise, but it often fails to deliver what is most needed at the
right time. The Silicon Valley giants that dominate the American economy
have made the strategic mistake of casting themselves as existing
essentially outside the country in which they were built. The founders
who created these companies in many cases viewed the United States as a
dying empire, whose slow descent could not be allowed to stand in the
way of their own rise and the new era’s gold rush. Many of them
essentially abandoned any serious attempt to advance society, to ensure
that human civilization kept inching up the hill. The prevailing ethical
framework of the Valley, a techno-utopian view that technology would
solve all of humanity’s problems, has devolved into a narrow and thin
utilitarian approach, one that casts individuals as mere atoms in a
system to be managed and contained. The vital yet messy questions of
what constitutes a good life, which collective endeavors society should
pursue, and what a shared and national identity can make possible have
been set aside as the anachronisms of another age.</p>
<p>We can—we must—do better. The central argument that we advance in the
pages that follow is that the software industry should rebuild its
relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to
constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities
that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively
face. The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative
obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the
articulation of a national project—what is this country, what are our
values, and for what do we stand—and, by extension, to preserve the
enduring yet fragile geopolitical advantage that the United States and
its allies in Europe and elsewhere have retained over their adversaries.
It is, of course, the protection of individual rights against state
encroachment that took its modern shape within “the West”—a concept that
has been discarded by many, almost casually—without which the dizzying
ascent of Silicon Valley would never have been possible.</p>
<p>The rise of artificial intelligence, which for the first time in
history presents a plausible challenge to our species for creative
supremacy in the world, has only heightened the urgency of revisiting
questions of national identity and purpose that many had thought could
be safely cast aside. We might have muddled through for years if not
decades, dodging these more essential matters, if the rise of advanced
AI, from large language models to the coming swarms of autonomous
robots, had not threatened to upend the global order. The moment,
however, to decide who we are and what we aspire to be, as a society and
a civilization, is now.</p>
<p>Others might prefer or advocate for a more careful and deliberate
division between the domains and concerns of the private and the public
sectors. The blending of business and national purpose, of the
discipline that the market can provide with an interest in the
collective good, makes many uneasy. But purity comes at a cost. We
believe that the reluctance of many business leaders to venture into, in
any meaningful way and aside from the occasional and theatrical foray,
the most consequential social and cultural debates of our time—including
those regarding the relationship between the technology sector and the
state—should give us pause. The decisions we collectively face are too
consequential to be left unchallenged and unexamined. Those involved in
constructing the technology that will animate and make possible nearly
every aspect of our waking lives have a responsibility to expose and
defend their views.</p>
<p>Our broader hope is that this book prompts a discussion of the role
Silicon Valley can and should play in the advancement and reinvention of
a national project, both in the United States and abroad—of what, beyond
a firm and uncontroversial commitment to liberalism and its values,
including the advancement of individual rights and fairness, constitutes
our shared vision of the community to which we belong.</p>
<p>We recognize that a political treatise of this nature is an unusual
project for those in the private sector to undertake. But the stakes are
high, and growing. The technology industry’s current reluctance to
engage with these fundamental questions has deprived us of a positive
vision for what this country or any other can and should be in an era of
increasing technological change and risk. We also believe that the
values of the engineering culture that gave rise to Silicon Valley,
including its obsessive focus on outcomes and disinterest in theater and
posturing—while complex and imperfect—will in the end prove vital to our
ability to advance our national security and welfare.</p>
<p>Too many leaders are reluctant to venture into the discussion, to
articulate genuine belief—in an idea, a set of values, or a political
project—for fear that they will be punished in the contemporary public
sphere. A significant subset of our leaders, elected and otherwise, both
teach and are taught that belief itself is the enemy and that a lack of
belief in anything, except oneself perhaps, is the most certain path to
reward. The result is a culture in which those responsible for making
our most consequential decisions—in any number of public domains,
including government, industry, and academia—are often unsure of what
their own beliefs are, or more fundamentally if they have any firm or
authentic beliefs at all.</p>
<p>We hope that this book, including by its very existence, suggests
that a far richer discourse, a more meaningful and nuanced inquiry into
our beliefs as a society, shared and otherwise, is possible—and, indeed,
imperative. Those in the private sector should not cede this terrain to
others in academia and elsewhere out of a perceived lack of authority or
expertise. Palantir itself is an attempt—imperfect, evolving, and
incomplete—at constructing a collective enterprise, the creative output
of which blends theory and action. The company’s deployment of its
software and its work in the world constitute the action. This book
attempts to offer the beginnings of an articulation of the theory.</p>
