<h4 id="chapter-five-the-abandonment-of-belief">Chapter Five The
Abandonment of Belief</h4>
<p>In 1976, Frank Collin, an ambitious leader in the small but resilient
Nazi Party of the United States, planned a march in Skokie, Illinois—an
attempt to raise the profile of his organization and build support for
his cause. The town, many of whose residents were Jewish and had lived
through the war, vehemently opposed the demonstration, and the case went
to the courts. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) came to the
legal defense of Collin and his fellow Nazis on First Amendment
grounds—a move that would be almost unthinkable today. Aryeh Neier, the
national executive director of the ACLU at the time, received thousands
of letters condemning his organization’s decision to defend the free
speech rights of Nazis. Neier was born into a Jewish family in Berlin in
1937 and fled from Germany to England along with his parents as a child.
He later estimated that thirty thousand ACLU members left the
organization as a result of its decision to come to the legal defense of
the Nazi demonstrators.</p>
<p>His interest in protecting Collin’s right to free speech under the
First Amendment was not rooted in an unthinking commitment to liberalism
or its values. He instead held two seemingly contradictory yet deeply
felt and genuine beliefs—in the abhorrence of Collin’s views and in the
importance of defending his right to express them against infringement
by the state. Neier was interested and willing to stand up for an
ideal—something above and beyond his own interests, and one that many
would have been content to applaud him for setting aside. “To defend
myself, I must restrain power with freedom, even if the temporary
beneficiaries are the enemies of freedom,” he later wrote. His beliefs
had a cost, and their defense required putting the credibility of his
organization, and himself, at risk.</p>
<p>A decade before, in September 1963, a similar clash arose in New
Haven, Connecticut, where George Wallace, the governor of Alabama and
vehement opponent of integration, had been invited to speak by the Yale
Political Union, a student organization. Earlier that year, at his
inaugural address in January, Wallace had told a crowd in Montgomery,
Alabama, that integration must be resisted as a form of “communistic
amalgamation,” one that would result in a “mongrel unit of one under a
single all powerful government.” It was in that speech that Wallace said
that he would be drawing a “line in the dust,” calling for “segregation
now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever,” to cries of support
from the crowd.</p>
<p>His potential arrival in New Haven had engulfed the city. Mayor
Richard C. Lee decided to send a telegram to Wallace letting him know
that he was “officially unwelcome”—an attempt to cancel the event, which
many thought would spark violence. Earlier that month, a group of four
members of the Ku Klux Klan had used dynamite to bomb the 16th Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four girls and injuring
nearly two dozen.</p>
<p>Others, however, urged the university not to prevent Wallace from
speaking. Pauli Murray, who was pursuing a doctorate at Yale Law School,
wrote a letter to Kingman Brewster Jr., the university’s president,
asking him to permit Wallace to address students on campus. Murray, born
in Baltimore in 1910, was a civil rights activist who worked for a
period as an attorney at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andandandand
Garrison, the New York law firm, and later taught at the Ghana School of
Law. She founded, along with Betty Friedan and others, the National
Organization for Women in 1966. For Murray, the question of whether
Wallace should be permitted to speak on campus was personal. Her father
had been committed to the Crownsville State Hospital for the Negro
Insane in Maryland, where he was killed in 1922 after “a white guard
taunted him with racist epithets, dragged him to the basement, and beat
him to death with a baseball bat,” according to one account. Murray’s
maternal grandmother was born into slavery in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Her letter to Brewster was nonetheless direct and brimming with
conviction and clarity. She argued that even though she herself had
“suffered from the evils of racial segregation,” a “possibility of
violence is not sufficient reason in law to prevent an individual from
exercising his constitutional right.” Murray anticipated the risk of
allowing for what would later be described as a “heckler’s veto” over
the speech rights of others—the possibility that debate would be
silenced as the result of a fear of the reaction, even a violent one, of
a listener. In the modern era, the veto is, of course, wielded with
frequency by those who profess offense or discomfort when faced with
views other than their own. The Yale Political Union eventually
rescinded its invitation to Wallace under pressure from Brewster.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Both Neier and Murray, in different contexts and different decades,
not only defended the unpopular but risked their reputations, as well as
the disapproval of their peers and the public, to stand up for a sort of
hard belief, one that was not vulnerable to being abandoned and
rationalized away. For Neier and Murray, something more than their own
self-preservation and advancement was at stake. Similar tests have
presented themselves more recently. But our culture has stepped back
from nurturing and encouraging such radical acts of intellectual
courage, leaving us with leaders who are increasingly unsure of
themselves and unwilling, or perhaps unable, to place much at risk.</p>
<p>In 2023, three university presidents, of Harvard, the University of
Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were called
before Congress in response to protests against Israel’s invasion of
Gaza following the killing of more than eleven hundred people in Israel
and the taking of some 250 hostages. The testimony of the university
presidents—two of whom ultimately resigned from their positions—raised
issues similar to those that arose in Skokie and New Haven decades ago,
including the familiar tension between protecting free speech rights and
guarding against attempts to alienate and subjugate the other. Their
cautious responses, attempting to preserve space for free speech,
captured national and international attention. To many, the presidents
were far too tepid in articulating their opposition to overtly hostile
calls and intimidation of students on campus. As Maureen Dowd pointed
out in the New York Times, Elizabeth Magill, president of the University
of Pennsylvania, “offered a chilling bit of legalese” when she was asked
whether calls for the genocide of Jews constituted harassment. Magill
responded, “It is a context-dependent decision.”</p>
<p>The presidents were wholly unaware of the internal contradictions of
their position—contradictions stemming from their commitment to free
speech, on the one hand, but also the eagerness of their institutions in
various other contexts to carefully patrol the use of language for fear
of causing offense. Their halting testimony was marked by cool precision
and calculation—embodying the archetype of the new administrative class,
clinical and careful and above all without feeling.</p>
<p>The testimony exposed a fundamental challenge that we, in the United
States and the West, face. A broad swath of leaders, from academic
administrators and politicians to executives in Silicon Valley, have for
years often been punished mercilessly for publicly mustering anything
approaching an authentic belief. The public arena—and the shallow and
petty assaults against those who dare to do something other than enrich
themselves—has become so unforgiving that the republic is left with a
significant roster of ineffectual, empty vessels whose ambition one
would forgive if there were any genuine belief structure lurking
within.</p>
<p>The unrelenting scrutiny to which contemporary public figures are now
subjected has also had the counterproductive effect of dramatically
reducing the ranks of individuals interested in venturing into politics
and adjacent domains. Advocates of our current system of ruthless
exposure of the private lives of often marginally public figures make
the case that transparency, one of those words that has nearly become
meaningless from overuse, is our best defense against the abuse of
power. But few seem interested in the very real and often perverse
incentives, and disincentives, we have constructed for those engaging in
public life.</p>
<p>The stifling regime of disclosure and punishment for authentic
intellectual risk-taking that we impose on would-be leaders leaves
little room for capable and original thinkers whose principal motivation
is something other than self-promotion, and who often lack a willingness
to subject themselves to the theater and vicissitudes of the modern
public sphere. It is “the proliferation of frenzies and expansion of the
range of personal issues subject to scrutiny,” as one political
scientist who has attempted to measure the fall in quality of political
candidates as a result of increasingly invasive media coverage of public
figures has put it, that “raises the expected cost to good people of
running for public office.” In 1991, Larry Sabato, a professor of
politics at the University of Virginia, joked that we were not far from
the moment at which the press would pounce on a candidate “for using an
express checkout lane when purchasing more than the ten-item limit.”</p>
<p>The expectations of disclosure have increased steadily for more than
half a century and have brought essential information to the voting
public. They have also contorted our relationship with our elected
officials and other leaders, requiring an intimacy that is not always
related to assessing their ability to deliver outcomes. Americans, in
particular, “have overmoralized public office,” as an editorial in Time
magazine warned decades ago in 1969, and “tend to equate public
greatness with private goodness.” The risk is that the political realm,
and the empowerment that one can feel by participating in the democratic
process, becomes more about our own psychological need for
self-expression than actual governance. Those who look to the political
arena to nourish their soul and sense of self, who rely too heavily on
their internal life, finding expression in people they may never meet,
will be left disappointed. We think we want and need to know our
leaders. But what about results? The likability of our elected leaders
is essentially a modern preoccupation and has become a national
obsession, yet at what cost?</p>
<p>In 1952, Richard Nixon, who was then General Dwight Eisenhower’s vice
presidential running mate, gave what would become known as the Checkers
speech, after his black-and-white cocker spaniel, disclosing to the
American public that he owned a home in Whittier, California, at a cost
of 3,000, on which he had an outstanding mortgage of ,000. He had been
accused of improperly using political funds for personal benefit and had
felt the need to try to clear the air. In that moment, the country was
for the first time introduced to a new and striking level of granularity
in the disclosures that it required from its politicians, and perhaps
the beginning of a decline in the quality of those willing to come
forward and submit to the spectacle. His wife reportedly asked Nixon,
affecting a certain naïveté, faux or otherwise, “Why do you have to tell
people how little we have and how much we owe?” Her husband replied that
politicians were destined to “live in a goldfish bowl.” But the
systematic elimination of private spaces, even for our public figures,
has consequences, and ultimately further incentivizes only those given
to theatrics, and who crave a stage, to run for office. The candidates
who remain willing to subject themselves to the glare of public service
are, of course, often interested more in the power of the platform, with
its celebrity and potential to be monetized in other ways, than the
actual work of government.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The current system of disclosure and scrutiny to which we subject our
leaders is not limited to university presidents or elected officials. It
has also permeated the ranks of Silicon Valley and the corporate world.
An entire generation of executives and entrepreneurs that came of age in
recent decades was essentially robbed of an opportunity to form actual
views about the world—both descriptive, what it is, and normative, what
it should be—leaving us with a managerial class whose principal purpose
often seems to be little more than ensuring its own survival and
re-creation.</p>
<p>The atrophying of the mind, and the self-editing that often
accompanies such decay, are corrosive to real thought. The result is
that corporations selling consumer goods feel the need to develop and
indeed broadcast their views on issues affecting our moral or interior
lives, while most software companies with the capacity and, perhaps,
duty to shape our geopolitics remain conspicuously silent.[*1]</p>
<p>Palantir builds software and artificial intelligence capabilities for
defense and intelligence agencies in the United States and its allies
across Europe and around the world. Our work has been controversial, and
not everyone will agree with our decision to build products that enable
offensive weapons systems. But we have made a choice, notwithstanding
its costs and complications.</p>
<p>By contrast, the congressional testimony by the university presidents
exposed the bargain that contemporary elite culture has made to retain
power—that belief itself, in anything other than oneself perhaps, is
dangerous and to be avoided. The Silicon Valley establishment has grown
so suspicious and fearful of an entire category of thought, including
contemplations on culture or national identity, that anything
approaching a worldview is seen as a liability. The shallow and thinly
veiled nihilism of a corporate slogan such as “don’t be evil,” which
Google adopted when the company went public in 2004 and later exchanged
for the similarly banal “do the right thing,” captures the views of a
generation of extraordinarily talented software engineers who were
taught to prize the identification of and resistance to evil over the
more difficult and often messy task of navigating the world in all of
its imperfection. As the French author Pascal Bruckner has written, when
we lack “the power to do anything, sensitivity becomes our main aim,”
and thus “the aim is not so much to do anything, as to be judged.”</p>
<p>The problem is that those who say nothing wrong often say nothing
much at all. An overly timid engagement with the debates of our time
will rob one of the ferocity of feeling that is necessary to move the
world. “If you do not feel it, you will not get it by hunting for it,”
Goethe reminds us in Faust. “You will never touch the hearts of others,
if it does not emerge from your own.”</p>
<p>Our culture has for the most part successfully pounded down any notes
or errant hints of zeal and feeling in many of those leading our most
significant institutions. And what remains beneath the polish is often
unclear. We later learned that WilmerHale, one of the nation’s most
respected law firms, prepared and advised both Claudine Gay of Harvard
and Elizabeth Magill of the University of Pennsylvania for their
testimony before Congress. And both of them lost their jobs. The
clinical approach of the presidents, and their trust in legal
specialists to guide them in what would essentially become a referendum
on their convictions, are reminders of the perils of delegating the
waging of political battle to legal referees at its margins. Others
suggested that the questioning and treatment of the college presidents
was unfair. It might have been. But as Lawrence Summers, the former
president of Harvard, correctly pointed out, even if we acknowledge that
the congressional inquisition of the college presidents was a form of
“performance art,” we should expect more from our leaders on that
significant of a stage.</p>
<p>When we require the systematic elimination of the thorns, barbs, and
flaws that necessarily accompany genuine human contact and confrontation
with the world, we lose something else. The work of Erving Goffman, a
Canadian-born sociologist, on what he described as “total institutions,”
is instructive here. In a collection of essays published in 1961 titled
Asylums, Goffman defined such institutions, which include prisons and
mental hospitals, as places “where a large number of like-situated
individuals, cut off from the wider society for an appreciable period of
time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.”
The same might be said of some of our nation’s most elite universities,
which have nominally and belatedly opened their doors to a far broader
swath of participants but whose internal cultures remain remarkably
cloistered and walled off from the world.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, an earlier generation of university
administrators, including Kingman Brewster Jr. at Yale, took a different
path when it came to confronting and embracing a challenge to entrenched
power and elite privilege. A series of civil rights demonstrations
involving the Black Panthers and others engulfed Yale’s campus in May
1970, and at least two bombs exploded in the school’s ice hockey rink.
There was a willingness, however, by Brewster and others to venture into
the ethical morass of the moment in a way that would ensure a swift and
summary cancellation in the United States today. In April 1970, at a
meeting of hundreds of Yale faculty members in New Haven, Connecticut,
Brewster said that he was “skeptical of the ability of black
revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States,”
according to a report in the Times the following day. He had ventured
into the conflagration, not away from it. Spiro Agnew, the vice
president of the United States, promptly called for Brewster to resign.
He did not, however, and Brewster not only kept his job but ultimately
emerged stronger. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “When you strike at
a king, you must kill him.”</p>
<p>Allan Bloom, who taught at the University of Chicago, more than three
decades ago articulated the challenge that we currently face in his 1987
polemic, The Closing of the American Mind. Our commitment to “openness,”
a vital and uncontroversially necessary good, he wrote, “has driven out
the local deities, leaving only the speechless, meaningless country.”
Bloom continued: “There is no immediate, sensual experience of the
nation’s meaning or its project, which would provide the basis for adult
reflection on regimes and statesmanship. Students now arrive at the
university ignorant and cynical about our political heritage, lacking
the wherewithal to be either inspired by it or seriously critical of
it.” In the late 1980s, Bloom was focused on the interior and
intellectual lives of university students. It is now those students who
are our administrators. And the culture in which those administrators
have been raised has been unforgiving, systematically punishing anything
approaching moral courage and incentivizing its opposite. In this way,
the university presidents are victims of their and our collective focus
on the policing of language and by extension thought, combined with the
enforcement of elaborate yet unpublished codes regarding speech and
behavior—that together deprive individuals of the habit and instinct
required to develop sincerely held and authentic beliefs, as well as the
gall to express them.</p>
<p>Perry Link, the former professor of East Asian studies at Princeton
whose work in the 1990s was vital in exposing the massacre at Tiananmen
Square in Beijing, has noted that the Soviet leadership went to great
lengths to document and detail the proscriptions of the day, even
publishing “periodic handbooks that listed which specific phrases were
out of bounds.”[*2] The means by which the Chinese government patrolled
the boundaries of speech, however, were far more subversive in Link’s
view, and in many ways more closely approximate the contemporary model
of attempts to constrain speech in the United States. Link wrote that
the Chinese government “rejected these more mechanical methods” of
censorship used by the Soviet regime “in favor of an essentially
psychological control system,” in which each individual must assess the
risk of a statement against what Link describes as “a dull,
well-entrenched leeriness” of disapproval by the state.</p>
<p>Amid the campus protests across the United States in 2024 following
Israel’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza, a growing number of student
protesters began concealing their faces with scarves and masks. Their
rationale was that exposure of their identities would jeopardize their
futures, from depriving them of job opportunities to facing criticism on
social media. A student protester at Northwestern, in Evanston,
Illinois, told a reporter in May 2024 that the potential costs were too
great to risk being identified. “If I give my name, I lose my future,”
he said. But is a belief that has no cost really a belief? The
protective veil of anonymity may instead be robbing this generation of
an opportunity to develop an instinct for real ownership over an idea,
of the rewards of victory in the public square as well as the costs of
defeat.</p>
<p>Michael Sandel, a professor at Harvard, anticipated the
contradictions that arise from our fierce commitment in the West to
classical liberalism, and its elevation if not preference for individual
rights at the expense of anything approaching collective purpose or
identity, as well as our cultural reluctance to venture into many of the
most meaningful and significant moral debates of our time. It is this
fundamental abdication of responsibility for articulating a coherent and
rich vision of the world, and of shared purpose—the systematic
dismantling of the West—that has left us unable to confront issues with
moral clarity or true conviction. And the consequences of this inability
or unwillingness to enter into such debates, “where liberals fear to
tread,” as Sandel famously put it, are now being made clear. “Where
political discourse lacks moral resonance, the yearning for a public
life of larger meanings finds undesirable expressions,” he wrote in
Liberalism and the Limits of Justice. As a result, our broader cultural
discourse shrinks down into something small and petty, becoming
“increasingly preoccupied with the scandalous, the sensational, and the
confessional,” Sandel added. His broader critique was that a certain
narrowness of modern liberalism “is too spare to contain the moral
energies of a vital democratic life,” and “thus creates a moral void
that opens the way for the intolerant” and “the trivial.” That void,
haunting and fearsome, is now being revealed.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Appeals to virtue and character, having been excluded for the most
part from the civic and political realms, have migrated, or rather, been
co-opted and appropriated, by the corporate. In 2013, Ram Trucks
produced a television commercial featuring a speech titled “So God Made
a Farmer” from 1978 by Paul Harvey, a radio broadcaster born in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The speech hailed the American farmer, who, among other
things, was “willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt, and watch
it die, and dry his eyes, and say maybe next year.” It was poignant and
powerful—yet all in service of selling a pickup truck. We have, quite
unwittingly, ceded direction over our interior lives, the development of
our moral selves, to the market.</p>
<p>*2 One Soviet directive from the 1920s listed ninety-six categories
of information that were prohibited, including facts and statistics
regarding “sanitary conditions in places of incarceration,” “clashes
between the authorities and peasants during the implementation of tax
and fiscal measures,” as well as “cases of mental derangement caused by
unemployment and hunger.”</p>
