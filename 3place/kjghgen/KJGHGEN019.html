<h4 id="chapter-thirteen-building-a-better-rifle">Chapter Thirteen
Building a Better Rifle</h4>
<p>On September 28, 2011, a group of twenty-four U.S. soldiers were on
patrol in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, supporting special
forces personnel who were attempting to build relationships with village
leaders in the region. The stretch of land in central Asia, at the
precarious intersection of numerous empires over the course of three
millennia, had been the subject of repeated cycles of invasion since at
least Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C., who was himself
ambushed and shot by an Afghan archer with an arrow during a campaign
across the country from the Khyber Pass in the east to Persia in the
west. On that September afternoon, the patrol stopped, and two marines
got out of their vehicles to take a look around, likely searching for
potential signs of roadside bombs that might have been hidden by Afghan
insurgents along their route. Moments later, a bomb detonated, and the
marines, wounded badly, fell to the ground. James Butz, a
twenty-one-year-old army medic from Porter, Indiana, immediately rushed
forward to help—not even sparing a moment to gather his own helmet and
rifle. A second explosion then went off. “Two soldiers were down,” his
father later recalled. “Jimmy didn’t hesitate.” All three men, Butz as
well as the two marines he was running to help, died that day.</p>
<p>The use of roadside bombs, which came to be known as improvised
explosive devices, or IEDs, across Afghanistan against American and
allied forces would expand significantly in the months that followed. By
2012, more than three thousand service members in the U.S. military had
been killed by the handmade bombs that were hidden or buried beneath
roads while insurgents waited out of sight to detonate them. A total of
14,500 IED attacks against U.S. and allied soldiers occurred across the
country in 2012 alone. The bombs, whose explosive material was often
made from widely available crop fertilizers, presented an escalating
crisis for American forces, which had been sent to Afghanistan to build
meaningful relationships and coalitions with local militias, in villages
and towns that were scattered across the region—work that required
constant travel and interaction with civilians. As a U.S. Navy officer
who spent years searching for and defusing the bombs later observed, the
IEDs forced U.S. soldiers to “confine themselves to massive, armored
vehicles and travel at high rates of speed or plow through farmers’
fields to avoid roads entirely.”</p>
<p>The U.S. military spent more than 5 billion from 2006 to 2012 in an
attempt to develop solutions to counter and defend against the crude
explosive devices, which often cost less than 00 to make. The armored
personnel carriers that ferried troops across Afghanistan were
particularly vulnerable; their protective armor was simply too light to
withstand the blasts given off by the roadside bombs that were hidden
across the landscape. The U.S. Army decided to order a new fleet of
vehicles with more substantial and protective ceramic composite material
for armor. By October 2012, more than twenty-four thousand of the
vehicles would be manufactured and sent to the battlefields of
Afghanistan and Iraq. In response, however, insurgents simply began
building bigger bombs, and ones that could be detonated remotely at
greater and therefore safer distances. The more powerful explosive
devices came to be known as buffalo killers by soldiers in the field for
their ability to take out even the larger and more heavily armored
vehicles that the military had ordered to respond to the threat.</p>
<p>By 2011, it had become clear to nearly everyone in the U.S. military
that better intelligence was needed to assess the safety of particular
roads and potential routes across the country, as well as to identify
and capture the bomb makers themselves. The frustration of so many
soldiers and intelligence officers in the field was that they had the
information they needed—the records and locations of prior attacks, the
types of bomb-making materials that had been used, the fingerprint scans
and mobile phone numbers of captured insurgents, and the reports of
confidential informants who had been recruited by American intelligence
agencies, to name only a few of the data sets that were available. The
information was sitting there, in dozens and hundreds of government
systems, for anyone with the right clearance to access. The task of
stitching it all together, however, into something useful—into something
actionable that patrols could use as they planned their next route to
visit a neighboring village, or decided which prisoners to question and
what information they might provide—was often effectively
impossible.</p>
<p>The structural issue was that those designing the army’s software
system at the time, including programmers at Lockheed Martin, in
Bethesda, Maryland, were too far and too disconnected from the actual
users of the software, the soldiers and intelligence analysts, in the
field. The gulf, between user and developer, had grown too wide to
sustain any sort of productive cycle of rapid iteration and development.
The construction of any technology, including military software systems,
requires an intimacy between builder and user—an emotional and often
physical proximity that for many government contractors in the suburbs
of Virginia and Maryland outside Washington, D.C., was as foreign as the
Afghan insurgents American troops were fighting a world away. In another
era, U.S. fighter pilots during World War II would frequently visit the
factory of Grumman Corporation, the predecessor of Northrop Grumman in
Bethpage, New York, on Long Island, to provide suggestions on the design
and construction of the company’s planes, including the F6F Hellcat,
which proved decisive in the air battle over the Pacific, according to
the author Arthur L. Herman. In Afghanistan more than half a century
later, however, that link between soldier and supplier had withered, if
not been severed completely.</p>
<p>With the army’s attempt to build a software system for soldiers in
Afghanistan, the reliance on a tangle of contractors and
subcontractors—and a yearslong procurement process that often involved
more preparation and planning for the construction of software than
actual coding—had deprived Lockheed Martin of any real opportunity to
incorporate feedback from its users into its development plans for the
system. The military’s software project had devolved into a pursuit of
an almost abstract conception of what software should look like, with
far less concern for the actual features and capabilities, the workflows
and interface, that would either make the software valuable to someone
working all night on a laptop in Kandahar to prepare for a special
forces operation the next morning or not.</p>
<p>An intelligence officer in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne filed a
request in November 2011 with a relatively new division within the U.S.
Army, the Rapid Equipping Force, which was located in Fort Belvoir,
Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., and had been established in
2002 as an attempt—one of dozens in recent decades—to expedite the
development of new weapons, equipment, and software platforms for
soldiers on the front lines. The organization’s stated goal had been to
acquire or build what soldiers needed within three to six months—a
radically ambitious timeline in the world of defense contracting, where
new weapons systems often languished in development for years and even
decades. The intelligence officer submitted a formal request to the army
procurement office in Virginia asking for access to Palantir’s software
to help gather and analyze intelligence from the field in Afghanistan in
order to counter the growing threat from IEDs. The stakes were high, and
growing. The officer wrote that the lack of access to Palantir’s
software had led to “operational opportunities missed and unnecessary
risk to the force.”</p>
<p>By early 2012, the requests for access to Palantir from soldiers in
the field in Afghanistan had begun mounting, with some finding ways to
circumvent the layers and bureaucracy of more traditional procurement
channels in favor of sending their requests for laptops and software to
senior military officers directly. In January 2012, for example, an
intelligence officer in Afghanistan sent an email to army procurement
personnel arguing that the army’s data analysis system was “not making
our job easier, while Palantir is giving us an intelligence edge.” The
following month, on February 25, 2012, the same officer repeated his
request for Palantir, emphasizing the rising stakes of attempting to
wage a war without effective software and the growing frustration from
soldiers in the field. “We aren’t going to sit here and struggle with an
ineffective intel system while we’re in the middle of a heavy fight
taking casualties,” the intelligence analyst wrote. A deputy to James
Mattis, who would later become U.S. defense secretary, wrote in an
internal request within the defense department for access to our
software, according to an article in Fortune, “Marines are alive today
because of the capability of this system.”</p>
<p>For many even far from the battlefield, the thought of sending
soldiers halfway around the world to fight a war, only to hesitate when
those same soldiers are telling you they need better equipment in the
field to stay alive, was absurd. The more fundamental issue was that a
broader public disillusionment with American involvement in Afghanistan,
as the years and casualties mounted, began to shape and warp discussions
around what resources soldiers needed to do their jobs. We should,
however, as a country, be capable of continuing a debate about the
appropriateness of military action abroad while remaining unflinching in
our commitment to those we have asked to step into harm’s way. If a U.S.
marine asks for a better rifle, we should build it. And the same goes
for software.</p>
<p>An even more fundamental issue was that the political class setting
the agenda in Afghanistan had itself never flown halfway around the
world to risk one’s life. Over twenty years, nearly 2,500 members of the
U.S. military were killed in Afghanistan, in addition to approximately
70,000 of the country’s civilians. The conflict would end up costing
trillion over two decades, or 00 million every day for twenty years,
according to estimates by a research group at Brown University. It has
been more than fifty years since the United States abandoned mandatory
conscription in 1973, near the end of the Vietnam War. And since then a
generation of political elites has essentially enlisted others to fight
their wars abroad.</p>
<p>Figure 11</p>
<p>Percentage of Members of U.S. Congress Who Have Served in the
Military</p>
<p>As of August 2006, there were only three members of Congress—three
out of our 535 U.S. representatives and senators—who had a child serving
in the American military. Charles Rangel, who represented New York City
in Congress for nearly five decades from 1971 to 2017 and fought in
Korea in the 1950s, has been a lonely proponent of reinstating the
draft. He introduced legislation at least seven times in recent decades
calling for the resurrection of conscription. If a battle abroad “is
truly necessary,” he has said, “we must all come together to support and
defend our nation.” The current model is utterly unsustainable. We
should, as a society, seriously consider moving away from an
all-volunteer force and only fight the next war if everyone shares in
the risk and the cost.</p>
<p>A battle over which software intelligence platform to use in
Afghanistan would continue for years. In the end, it was the individual
soldiers and intelligence analysts who needed a better system, and the
army’s disinterest in adjusting more quickly when faced with criticism
of its own incumbent platform, that began to shift the discussion. In
the American system, imperfect as it may be, “you get things done by
power,” as Patrick Caddell, a political adviser to President Jimmy
Carter, once said, and “you get power from having public support.” The
soldiers knew what they needed, and their voices would end up being
heard. But it was also a little-known federal statute enacted in
response to a prior conflict in another era and a different part of the
world—a law that would essentially go overlooked for two decades—that
helped tip the balance.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, shortly after the U.S. military began its aerial
bombardment of Iraq and sent troops to defend Kuwait, commanders in the
U.S. Air Force identified an urgent, and seemingly unlikely, problem.
The most powerful air force in the world, with the most advanced fighter
jets ever produced and rocket-propelled missiles that could reach across
continents, lacked something far more low-tech and less expensive. The
U.S. Air Force personnel who had flooded into Kuwait in the wake of
Saddam Hussein’s invasion of the country did not have enough two-way
radios, the handheld devices that were essential for fast communication
across the new military bases that the United States was establishing.
The radios, the kinds that are used on construction sites and camping
trips, were readily available at stores across the country and could be
purchased by anyone for less than 0 at a local electronics store.</p>
<p>The solution for the U.S. Air Force seemed simple: buy more. The best
available model at the time was made by Motorola, the American
electronics giant that was founded in 1928 in Schaumburg, Illinois. A
Japanese subsidiary of the company had large quantities in stock of the
radios that the air force needed, and an urgent order for thousands of
them was placed. Motorola, however, hesitated when it received the
request, which was accompanied by a long list of special provisions
inserted by U.S. officials, including what the company believed were
onerous and unnecessary requirements to produce data on the costs
involved in manufacturing the radios. The litany of requirements was a
standard part of the military procurement process at the time; its
ostensible purpose was to ensure that the government received a fair
price for what it bought. Motorola did not have anything to hide. The
issue was that the company did not have the accounting systems in place
that would have enabled it to track its manufacturing costs in the
specific way that the U.S. government required. As a result, the company
could not lawfully sell its radios to the American military.</p>
<p>The air force was in a bind. A war was mounting in Iraq, and the
military did not have sufficient numbers of the most basic of tools—a
working, portable communications device. The result seemed absurd. A
patchwork of regulations that had been intended to protect the U.S.
government against overspending were now preventing that same government
from buying what it needed on the open market in the middle of the most
significant military conflict in a generation. The air force
contemplated attempting to navigate through its own regulations and find
a work-around. But developing an alternative contractual model, one that
would have avoided the cost disclosure requirements mandated by law,
“would have taken some time,” according to Lieutenant Colonel Brad
Orton, who was leading the air force’s effort to acquire the radios,
“time that we didn’t really have.” In the end, Orton and others decided
to circumvent the U.S. government’s own regulatory regime entirely. They
reached out to the Japanese government and arranged for Japan, not the
United States, to purchase six thousand of the handheld radios directly
from Motorola and then for the Japanese government to send them to the
U.S. Air Force in Kuwait.</p>
<p>The episode came to symbolize the extent of internal dysfunction
within the U.S. government procurement process, which had become so
contorted and inefficient that the military, during wartime, was
prevented from buying what any civilian could have purchased from a
local electronics store. The challenge was systemic, and the roots of
the dysfunction ran deep. Senator William Roth, who represented Delaware
for three decades beginning in 1971, would later point out the absurdity
of the fact that the federal government struggled to purchase products
that anyone could “buy at the local Wal-Mart and Kmart.”</p>
<p>The structural issue was that the procurement bureaucracy within the
U.S. government had become so large and so entrenched, wielding enormous
power and influence, that it had grown used to ordering custom-built
versions of whatever it needed instead of shopping for goods, like
everyone else, on the open market. The federal procurement officials
responsible for supplying the U.S. military could direct the efforts of
thousands of subcontractors and suppliers, essentially dictating that
anything they wanted or needed be conjured and created from scratch. The
government did not technically employ the product designers or own the
factories. But it effectively controlled them, and could also pay any
price. At the time, the U.S. government “tended to spend too much
because it had almost everything it bought ‘custom made’ to government
or military specifications,” Al Gore, who worked on procurement reform
during his time as vice president under Bill Clinton, wrote in 1998. The
U.S. Army, for example, at one point in the 1990s drafted more than
seven hundred pages of specifications on how to bake cookies,
specifications that would be sent to its suppliers, instead of simply
working with a major manufacturer whose cookies were already being made
and on grocery store shelves.[*]</p>
<p>The roots of the problem, as well as the increasing public
frustration with wasteful government spending, had been growing for
nearly a century. A commission established by President Theodore
Roosevelt in 1905, for example, had discovered that the U.S. government
was purchasing 278 types of pens, 132 variations of pencils, and
twenty-eight distinct colors of ink. Gifford Pinchot, a close friend of
Roosevelt’s who served on the commission, noted that the government had
become “debased by generations of political control, sunk in the mire of
traditional red tape”—a term that has its roots in the red-colored cloth
tape that various governments, including that of the United States, had
used throughout history to tie and bundle documents.</p>
<p>In the modern age, the constant rotation of personnel through the
government, both in the military and in the civilian branches,
incentivized inaction and complacency. In the early 1980s, a series of
reports regarding the significant sums paid by the U.S. government for
commonplace household items captured national attention, prompting calls
for reform. In 1983, for example, the U.S. Navy reportedly paid 35 for
an “ordinary hammer,” according to a report in the New York Times at the
time, and 00 for a “thumb-sized plastic knob” that was used in the
cockpit of a fighter plane. Some of the prices that captured public
attention were arguably misleadingly high. The hammers, for example, had
been listed on an invoice as costing 35 each, even though that figure
had been calculated by assigning a proportion of the labor and overhead
involved in the production of more than four hundred other spare parts
and pieces of equipment to each individual item delivered on an equal
basis—an accounting method that imperfectly divided overhead costs
across hundreds of items, including the hammers. Still, the public
rightly sensed a system that had grown so large and unwieldy that it was
nearly beyond reform, planting the seeds of discontent that have
resurfaced today, nearly half a century later, about a Washington
establishment focused solely on its own survival at the expense of the
public interest and common sense. In 1984, a journalist described Joseph
Sherick, the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Defense under
President Ronald Reagan who had been charged with policing the federal
procurement bureaucracy at the time, as an “alligator” patrolling “a
‘swamp’ of mismanagement and abuse at the Pentagon.”</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, the reformers had essentially won the argument,
and the public was ready, even eager, to see the size and scale of
federal spending cut back. Bill Clinton, who won the presidency in 1992,
had pitched himself to the American public as a pragmatic reformer—a
Democrat who would trim government, not expand it. He would later say,
in a State of the Union address during his first term, “We know there’s
not a program for every problem.” Clinton cast himself as more closely
aligned with skeptics of the federal bureaucracy, not its advocates. At
a press conference in September 1993, announcing what he had described
as a national performance review, which was intended to overhaul the
federal bureaucracy, Clinton told reporters, “The Government is broken,
and we intend to fix it.” The country was receptive to the message,
which had significant support across party lines. David E. Rosenbaum, a
political correspondent for the Times, wrote the following day, “No one
who has tried to fill out a Medicare claim form, get the Internal
Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration on the telephone,
apply for a Government contract—no one, in short, who has ever been
hogtied by Federal red tape—can disagree with Mr. Clinton’s
description.”</p>
<p>Clinton had been working with members of Congress on both sides of
the aisle for months on a new federal statute aimed at reforming the
federal procurement process. Shortly after 10:00 a.m. on October 26,
1993, Clinton gathered with his vice president, Al Gore, and others in
the Old Executive Office Building at the White House to preview his
planned reforms and announce a series of spending cuts to federal
programs. The struggle by the air force during the Gulf War to purchase
two-way radios from Motorola—and a furtive, last-minute deal with the
Japanese government to avert a crisis—was, for Clinton, a clear example
of why the U.S. Congress needed to move quickly to overhaul the system.
“This should never happen again,” Clinton said. Gore, who was standing
by his side, added, “When the government of another nation has to step
in and buy something for the U.S. military because our procurement
regulations are so crazy, that’s a clear wake up call.”</p>
<p>The draft legislation that Clinton and others had planned was a bill
that would grant the government far more discretion in purchasing
decisions. The prevailing regulatory regime had focused on price and as
a result often led to contracts being awarded to bids that offered the
lowest cost irrespective of whether the contractors making them were
best suited to do the job. The new legislation shifted the focus to
value, as opposed to cost exclusively, providing the government with
much broader discretion to make purchasing decisions that it believed
were in the public interest. In addition, the bill introduced a new
requirement that would essentially remain unused for more than two
decades. The law, which would come to be known as the Federal
Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, required that the government
consider buying commercially available products, whether they were
two-way radios or armored personnel carriers, before attempting to build
something new from scratch.</p>
<p>The legislation attracted little attention at the time; it was the
product of a sort of behind-the-scenes governance, without the promise
of much publicity, that has lost favor in recent years. The bill was
sponsored by John Glenn, the former astronaut and then senator from
Ohio. His legacy was secure, and he had little to prove, to his
constituents or to the world. Glenn was born in 1921 in Cambridge, Ohio,
a small town on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. He served in the
U.S. Marines as a fighter pilot during World War II and later became one
of America’s earliest and most celebrated astronauts. By the time he
began working on the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Glenn was
serving his fourth term as a U.S. senator. He was unencumbered by a need
to prove something to the public, whose affection he had already
secured.</p>
<p>At a Senate hearing on February 24, 1994, in which the draft
legislation was discussed, Glenn made clear that the proposed law
“certainly is not glamorous,” but was rather concerned with what he
described as the “ ‘grunt work’ of government, the stuff that makes
government work day in and day out, and makes it work efficiently.”
Everyone knew that the existing system was broken. But real progress had
proven elusive. As Glenn pointed out, “We have wrestled year-in and
year-out with these same issues, and still have failed to enact any
meaningful reform.” The strategy of public servants, he added, was often
“to just not make waves, to not disturb their careers, to not do
anything unusual that might get them in trouble.” And there are a lot of
people who do not want to get in trouble. Steven Brill, the author and
journalist who founded the American Lawyer in the late 1970s, has
documented the striking scope of the federal procurement machine, which
includes 207,000 federal employees who have been hired to manage
government acquisitions and purchases. “The bloat is undeniable,” Brill
has written.</p>
<p>In October 1994, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act was signed
into law. At the signing ceremony, Clinton joked that he was hesitant to
approve the bill, for fear of depriving late-night comedians of fodder
about government dysfunction. “What will Jay Leno do?” Clinton asked.
“There will be no more 00 hammers, no more 00 toilet seats, no more 0
ashtrays.” The new federal statute, originally codified in Section 2377
of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, required that the U.S. government, “to the
maximum extent practicable,” acquire “commercial items,” when such
products are readily available on the market, as opposed to attempting
to build new products from scratch. The final language of the statute
was broad and seemingly unobjectionable—so broad that some believed it
would not amount to much. The law merely required that the federal
government consider purchasing commercially available products before
ordering or building something new. The stage was now set for a legal
skirmish that would play out two decades later.</p>

<p>In Afghanistan, software made by Palantir had found a committed band
of supporters, particularly in the U.S. Special Forces, with teams where
intelligence, and the ability to quickly navigate across databases and
stitch together context in advance of missions, were critical. But the
army as a whole, with hundreds of thousands of active personnel
scattered around the world, remained resistant to any sort of broader
rollout of Palantir to the force. Its own software program, which the
military had been building for more than a decade, was still under
development. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, more than twenty
years from its passage, with its plain language requiring that federal
agencies consider commercial products before building their own, seemed
to present a path forward.</p>
<p>In 2016, Palantir filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims, in Washington, D.C., arguing that the army had refused to even
consider commercially available alternatives to its own data and
analytical platform. This sort of litigation was rare, if not
nonexistent, because most government contractors were wise enough to
avoid suing the government agencies they were hoping would become their
customers. We saw things differently. A federal statute had simple,
plain language requiring the army to at least consider buying software
products that were on the market before attempting to build its own. The
case came before Marian Blank Horn, who in November 2016 issued a
104-page ruling, concluding that “the Army failed to properly
determine…whether there are commercially available items suitable to
meet the agency’s needs for the procurement at issue,” and that “the
Army acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner” in failing to do so.
In short, we had won.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the U.S. Army announced that it would be selecting one
of two companies, Raytheon and Palantir, to develop its intelligence
platform moving forward. John McCain, a former officer in the U.S. Navy
and then U.S. senator from Arizona, wrote that it was the right
decision, that after billion of investment “it was time to find another
way.” A year later, in March 2019, the army announced that Palantir had
won the entire contract. The U.S. military’s turn toward the technology
sector, and perhaps reluctant embrace of an insurgent startup to take
over construction of the system, was, according to the Washington Post,
“the first time the government had tapped a Silicon Valley software
company, as opposed to a traditional military contractor, to lead a
defense program of record.” The shift marked a pivot by the U.S.
Department of Defense toward software and technology, toward a sector
that had repeatedly turned its own back on America and its military in
favor of its focus on, and indeed seemingly boundless enthusiasm for,
more easily monetized consumer offerings.</p>
<p>In 2011, while we were sending engineers to Kandahar and working on
building a more capable analytical software platform for U.S. and allied
intelligence agencies, the focus of Silicon Valley, with its own armies
of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, was far from the mountain
passes and deserts of Afghanistan. Zynga, the video game maker that had
built a following on the back of FarmVille, a social-networking game in
which players competed to cultivate land and raise livestock, was the
darling of the Valley at the time. In December 2011, the company went
public at a valuation of billion. The enthusiasm from Wall Street, and
focus on monetizing the millions and billions of potential users and
clicks for the taking, was palpable. “This is a revolution,” a brokerage
firm analyst told the Times on the eve of Zynga’s IPO. Afghanistan, and
the lonely and often deadly task of clearing dusty roads of hidden
bombs, could not have felt farther away.</p>
<p>Zynga was anything but alone in its zeal for and interest in the
consumer market. Groupon was another of the year’s most watched IPOs,
the darling of darlings with the venture community. The company provided
discounts to consumers at local retailers. At a valuation of 5 billion,
Groupon was set to become “the largest IPO by a venture-backed company
in history,” an article at the time in Forbes noted. The company, which
is still in business, albeit barely, has plummeted since its IPO and is
today valued at mere pennies for every dollar that it was once worth.
The Zyngas and Groupons had the world’s attention. Palantir, by
contrast, was off on its own adventure, far from the consumer and, as a
result, in the minds of many, the right path. Some employees thought we
were foolish. Others left and went to work for this new generation of
consumer startups. One early engineer quit because he didn’t think our
shares would ever be worth anything and wanted more cash compensation
instead of equity in order to buy a high-end stereo. The market had
spoken. And it was unfashionable to question its wisdom.</p>
<p>The technology sector had turned its back on the military,
disinterested in wrangling with an overgrown bureaucracy and
ambivalence, if not outright opposition, from the public at home. There
were other, more lucrative consumer markets to conquer. It was, however,
a tolerance and perhaps some degree of taste for conflict, and a
stubborn pursuit of something, anything that worked—that engineering
instinct—that gave Palantir a foothold.</p>
