<h4 id="chapter-twelve-the-disapproval-of-the-crowd">Chapter Twelve The
Disapproval of the Crowd</h4>
<p>In 1951, Solomon E. Asch, a professor of psychology at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania, conducted a seemingly straightforward study on
the human inclination to conform when faced with pressure from a
group—an experiment that would prompt a far broader reckoning with the
fragility of the human mind. And it was one of a number of studies in
the early postwar period that captured an essential feature of our
psychology that must be overcome in order to construct a company from
scratch.</p>
<p>Asch was born in Warsaw in 1907, in what was then the Russian Empire.
When he was thirteen years old, his family immigrated to New York, where
he attended City College and later earned his doctorate at Columbia
University. In his conformity experiments, which exposed to a broad
audience the limitations of human willpower to resist the pressure of
the group, Asch arranged for an instructor in a classroom to show
placards with a control line, alongside three additional lines of
varying heights, each of which was numbered, to a group of eight
individuals, only one of whom was a true test subject. The other seven
were confederates of the experimenter. Each of the eight participants
was then asked which of the three numbered lines was the same length as
the control line. In the following example, the correct answer would be
line 2, which matches the length of the unnumbered control line on the
left.</p>
<p>Figure 10</p>
<p>The Asch Conformity Experiment</p>
<p>While the perceptual task was seemingly straightforward, a
significant number of test subjects, when asked after participants who
had been told to answer incorrectly, also themselves gave the wrong
responses, choosing lines that were obviously either longer or shorter
than the one being measured. They knew which answer was correct, but
those around them were disagreeing. It was disconcerting, and for some
the dissonance was overwhelming. As Asch later wrote, the lone subject
of study “faced, possibly for the first time in his life, a situation in
which a group unanimously contradicted the evidence of his senses.” It
was an undoubtedly harrowing and uncomfortable moment for the test
subject, who was well aware of the correct answer but was seated next to
seven individuals who were, often unanimously, making the wrong choice.
For Asch, and many others, the fact that “reasonably intelligent and
well-meaning young people” were “willing to call white black is a matter
of concern,” calling into question the educational systems that our
culture had produced as well as our values as a society.</p>
<p>Asch’s interest in conformity and the power of group pressure from a
psychological perspective was a reflection of questions about human
nature—about the human capacity to inflict harm on others—that had
arisen in the wake of the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the
1930s. A friend and colleague would later recall that when it became
clear that the number of “yielders” in his studies, as they labeled
those who buckled under the pressure of the group, “was disappointingly
large,” they “all had to learn to swallow that result, along with the
lessons of the Nazi successes.” The experiments conducted by Asch, along
with others such as those performed in the following years by Stanley
Milgram at Yale, had put to rest any lingering hope that the American
mind was somehow immune from the pressures of group psychology that had
overwhelmed the German public across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Asch’s experiments marked the beginning of what some would describe
as a golden age of social psychology in the postwar period. The
institutional review boards that today carefully monitor proposed
studies involving human subjects did not exist. The departments
essentially were left to police themselves, and experiments on human
subjects, including ones that required significant levels of deception,
were frequently permitted at the time. While many would later challenge
the ethics of allowing such experiments to proceed, given the extent of
the deceit and manipulation involved, the tests arguably produced some
of the most valuable research into social and group psychology that has
ever been performed.</p>
<p>The obedience experiment conducted in 1961 by Milgram, who had
studied under Asch at Princeton, went even further than the line
comparison tests from a decade before. Milgram, who was an assistant
psychology professor at Yale, designed his experiment on conformity in
order to assess not merely whether test subjects would buckle under the
pressure of a group when faced with a simple perceptual task, such as
assessing the relative lengths of lines, but rather their willingness to
inflict harm on innocent strangers when instructed to do so by an
individual in a position of apparent authority. Milgram was born in 1933
in New York, and his father was a cake baker who had immigrated to the
United States from Hungary. His mother had left Romania as a young
child. Milgram’s experiment involved the recruitment of hundreds of
residents of New Haven, Connecticut, to volunteer for what they had been
told was a psychology experiment involving learning and punishment that
was being conducted by Yale University. An advertisement seeking
volunteers was placed in the local newspaper, and Milgram’s team
followed up by sending letters to randomly selected residents from the
phone book to recruit additional participants. Each of the volunteers
was paid , as well as fifty cents for taxi rides to and from the
laboratory. The test subjects were told that in the experiment they
would play the role of a “teacher,” whose job would be to administer
electric shocks to another individual, known as the “learner,” in order
to assess whether the shocks would assist the learner in memorizing
random pairs of words, such as “blue” and “box,” or “wild” and “duck,”
more accurately.</p>
<p>The electric shock machine was made to look authentic, and almost
menacing, with knobs and lights, a buzzer, and various labels noting the
level of voltage that would be administered by turning the knob to
different positions. At the outset of each session, participants were
even given a mild shock themselves from the machine in order to further
convince the test subjects that they would be administering actual
electrical voltage as part of the experiment. The learner, of course,
was in on the ruse, and played by a forty-seven-year-old accountant. The
electric shock machine emitted sounds and flashed lights, but could not
harm anyone. As the amount of voltage increased throughout each session,
the learner, however, would begin yelling and shouting, asking both the
test subject and the experimenter to halt the experiment. The question
was how far subjects would proceed notwithstanding his increasingly
desperate pleas to stop. Of the dozens of individuals who participated
in the experiment, a striking two-thirds complied with directions to
administer what they had reasonably been led to believe was a harmful
level of electrical voltage to an otherwise innocent test subject. The
results captivated the country and sparked a debate about the human
capacity for inflicting harm at the direction of authority figures.</p>
<p>In one of the most haunting sessions from the experiment, one of the
volunteers, a fifty-year-old man, whom Milgram later described as “a
rather ordinary fellow,” at first protested mildly when asked to
administer the series of increasingly strong shocks to the victim. As
the voltage approached what appeared to be more dangerous levels, and
the purported victim could be heard shouting repeatedly to be let free
and to stop the experiment, the test subject attempted to dissuade the
experimenter from asking that he proceed with the administration of a
180-volt shock.</p>
<p>Subject: I can’t stand it. I’m not going to kill that man in there.
You hear him hollering?</p>
<p>Experimenter: As I told you before, the shocks may be painful,
but—</p>
<p>Subject: But he’s hollering. He can’t stand it. What’s going to
happen to him?</p>
<p>Experimenter (his voice is patient, matter-of-fact): The experiment
requires that you continue, Teacher…. Whether the learner likes it or
not, we must go on.</p>
<p>And go on he did. Over the next several minutes, the test subject
proceeded to administer a series of escalating shocks through shouts of
pain and protests from the victim, who pleaded repeatedly to let him out
of the room and stop the experiment. The transcript of the exchange is
absolutely striking. A certain decorum remained constant throughout the
session, notwithstanding the fact that one man believed that he was
shocking another to death. As Milgram put it, “A tone of courtesy and
deference is meticulously maintained.” For many, the dissonance between
the measured dialogue of the test subject and the experimenter, on the
one hand, and the cries of agony from the victim, on the other,
challenged the view that the capacity to inflict harm on the innocent
was solely the domain of the depraved. “He thinks he is killing
someone,” Milgram later wrote of the subject, “yet he uses the language
of the tea table.” We had collectively perhaps hoped that the
destruction wrought during World War II had been the work of isolated
actors, an aberration from the ordinary capacities of the human mind.
Milgram’s experiment provided a jarring and alternative explanation—that
such a capacity was far more commonplace, and indeed banal, than we had
ever considered.</p>
<p>Not all of Milgram’s subjects, however, were as compliant. One woman,
a medical technician from Germany who had grown up during the rise of
the Nazi Party in the 1930s, stood out. At one point during her session,
as the setting on the shock generator approached 210 volts, she paused,
asking, “Shall I continue?” The investigator leading the session, who
was a thirty-one-year-old biology teacher wearing a gray lab coat,
replied, “The experiment requires that you go on until he has learned
all the word pairs correctly.” He also repeated that the shocks “may be
painful” but were “not dangerous.” The subject then escalated the
interaction somewhat: “Well, I’m sorry, I think when shocks continue
like this, they are dangerous. You ask him if he wants to get out. It’s
his free will.” Her act of defiance almost seemed casual; its steely
resolve both inspiring and unremarkable. Moments later, she told the
experimenter that she would not proceed with shocking the victim at
higher voltages and left. Milgram observed that “the woman’s
straightforward, courteous behavior” and “lack of tension” made her
defiance appear to be “a simple and rational deed.”</p>
<p>The psychological resilience that the woman displayed was what
Milgram had expected would have been the case for most of those tested.
His hopes, however, had been misplaced. Many of those who participated
in the experiment proceeded to administer what they believed were
significant doses of electricity to victims yelling for the experiment
to stop. The prevalence and indeed ease with which so many submitted
were, of course, stark reminders of our shortcomings as a species. But
they also suggested a path forward, or at least exposed the
psychological obstacles around which one must maneuver in business, in
order to have any hope of creating something new.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The instinct toward obedience can be lethal to an attempt to
construct a disruptive organization, from a political movement to an
artistic school to a technology startup. At many of the most successful
technology giants in Silicon Valley, there is a culture of what one
might call constructive disobedience. The creative direction that an
organization’s most senior leaders provide is internalized but often
reshaped, adjusted, and challenged by those charged with executing on
their directives in order to produce something even more consequential.
A certain antagonism within an organization is vital if it is to build
something substantial. An outright dereliction of duty might simply hold
an organization back. But the unquestioning implementation of orders
from higher up is just as dangerous to an institution’s long-term
survival. The challenge for businesses is that executives and managers
far too often select for and reward an unthinking compliance in those
they hire—a simpleminded obedience that is corrosive to building a
business capable of something more than execution on the whims of a
founder.</p>
<p>The group of experiments by Asch, Milgram, and others—now classics in
investigational social psychology—prompted an entire generation of
psychologists and academics to question the ability of individuals to
resist the pressure of authority and delivered something of a somber and
enduring referendum on humanity. Some had hoped that the experience in
Europe had been an aberration—that other nations, if tested, would not
have succumbed and indeed submitted to totalitarian rule without more
fierce resistance. As Howard Gruber, a psychology professor at Columbia
University’s Teachers College who had studied under Asch, would later
recall, the studies conducted by that era’s researchers made clear “that
conformity is international.” America might have been exceptional, but
not in all respects.</p>
<p>Some amount of what might be thought of as a sort of social deafness
may, in this way, be productive in the context of building software. An
unwillingness, or perhaps an inability, to conform to those around us,
to the cues and norms put forth by others, can be an advantage in the
realm of technology. A willingness to withdraw from the world, and to
decline to engage with external views at certain critical moments of an
organization’s evolution, has been vital in the context of building
Palantir over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Other purported disabilities have, in different domains, proven
adaptive. In September 1922, Claude Monet, after months of declining
vision, was diagnosed with a cataract, which, according to his Parisian
eye doctor, had reduced the painter’s vision “to one tenth in the left
eye and to the perception of light with good projection in the right
eye.” He went through periods of seeing the world tinged by an orange
hue, then weeks later a blue cast. A surgery, and the arrival of some
German lenses, eventually helped address the problem. His later works
grew increasingly and viscerally divorced from bare representation,
including a canvas, inflected with hints of teal and crimson, titled
Weeping Willow, whose “gestural lines,” one art critic has noted, “blur
the image until it veers into abstraction.” A retrospective of the
painter’s work alongside that of the American artist Joan Mitchell,
which opened in Paris in 2022, suggested that Monet was responsible for
the rise to dominance of abstract expressionism that would follow in the
decades after his death in 1926.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Ludwig van Beethoven began losing his hearing in his
twenties, he was at first intensely guarded about his diminished
capacity to listen to the very music that he was building a career
composing. In 1801, Beethoven wrote to a violinist friend of his, “I beg
you to treat what I have told you about my hearing as a great secret.”
As news, however, of his hearing loss became more widely known over the
years, the public grew fascinated with his seemingly otherworldly
capacity for musical composition “in spite of this affliction,” as
Beethoven’s nephew wrote to his uncle. The question, of course, is
whether the perceived disability was a disability at all—whether he was
capable of composing such great works in spite of his incapacity or
rather because of it. Some have argued that Beethoven’s hearing loss
merely redirected and perhaps augmented his creative process, forcing
him to rely more heavily on the act of writing out his compositions, and
thereby allowing him to construct “a novel sonic universe,” as one music
critic has written, “because he was being led by his eyes as much as by
his memories of sound.”</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The instinct to conform to the behavior of those around us, to the
norms that others demonstrate, and to prize the abilities that most
around us find second nature, is in the vast majority of cases
extraordinarily adaptive and helpful, for both our individual survival
and that of the human species. Our desire to conform is immense and yet
crippling when it comes to creative output. In Asch’s experiments, there
was a subset of those tested who reliably buckled under the pressure
each and every time they were confronted with blatantly false reports of
the relative lengths of the lines they were shown. Another cohort never
wavered in correctly assessing their lengths notwithstanding the
pressure of others. It is this insensitivity to a certain type of social
calculation, and resistance to conformity, that has been essential to
the rise of Silicon Valley’s engineering culture.</p>
