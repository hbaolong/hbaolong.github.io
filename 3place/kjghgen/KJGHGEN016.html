<h4 id="chapter-ten-the-eck-swarm">Chapter Ten The Eck Swarm</h4>
<p>On June 26, 1951, at around 1:30 p.m., a cluster of honeybees began
to form in a park in Munich, Germany. This small swarm of bees would
eventually help reshape our understanding of the animal mind and its
capacity for undirected cooperation. Martin Lindauer, a researcher at
the University of Munich’s Zoological Institute, was on hand that summer
afternoon to document the swarm as part of a study on the behavior of
the hive and the ability of bees to coordinate among hundreds and even
thousands and tens of thousands of individuals. He was captivated by the
behavior of the species Apis mellifera and was determined to shed light
on the delegation of responsibility among individuals within a single
bee colony, particularly when they began searching for, and deciding
between, new potential nesting sites.</p>
<p>Lindauer was born in 1918 in southern Bavaria. His father, who kept
beehives as well, was a farmer, and the family had fifteen children. As
Hitler rose to power and war engulfed the continent, Lindauer ended up
serving in the German army for three years. His interests, however, lay
elsewhere, and after suffering an injury on the Russian front in 1942,
he was discharged from the military. Thomas D. Seeley, a biology
professor at Cornell University who has written extensively on
Lindauer’s work, has noted that Lindauer once described the scientific
community to which he would return after his time in the army as “a new
world of humanity.” The exploration of the natural world was a reprieve
for Lindauer, who retreated into science after the war.</p>
<p>He was part of a generation of zoologists whose work preceded the
rise and eventual dominance of genetic-based research in the field. For
a time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the best access
that biologists such as Lindauer had into the mind of the animal was
through its outward behavior; a more complete understanding of the power
and inner workings of the gene, as a means of accessing the nature of a
species, was still out of reach. These earlier generations of scientists
of the natural world, including the French psychologist Alfred Binet,
were observers in the field, and keen ones. The mysteries underlying the
behavior of the animals and humans that they were studying, invisible to
most, were there for the taking, at least to anyone who was capable of
looking closely and for a sufficiently long time.</p>
<p>When animals search for a new home, whether geese, leaf-cutter ants,
horses, or sparrows, they often venture out as single individuals, and
sometimes in pairs, in search of suitable accommodation. The practice of
the European honeybee, however, departs significantly from the norm.
Whereas most animals explore their environments independently, in the
case of honeybees “a large community of 20 to 30 thousand individuals
together move into a new nest-site,” Lindauer wrote—a process that
requires immense coordination but without a central queen bee or other
specialized leaders directing the work of the group. The process by
which tens of thousands of individual organisms manage to organize
themselves, canvass potential nesting sites, ultimately select one of a
number of options over the rest, and then together move to their new
home was an absolute puzzle to Lindauer and his contemporaries.</p>
<p>On this particular summer afternoon in 1951, the collection of bees
that Lindauer had been watching was small at first. They had begun
congregating not far from an imposing stone statue of Neptune, holding a
trident and rising from the waters of a nearby fountain. The University
of Munich’s Zoological Institute, which had granted permission to
Lindauer to study the bee colonies that the institute maintained, was
located in a park that had served as the site of a botanical garden
constructed in the early nineteenth century, and there were plenty of
secluded and attractive potential nesting sites nearby among the trees
and foliage. At around three that afternoon, clouds began forming over
the park, at which point Lindauer noted that the bees retreated to a
nearby bush, where they stayed and spent the night. The following day,
after the cloud cover broke and the sun returned, the bees resumed their
work of searching for a place to build a hive.</p>
<p>Such searches were involved affairs. They included dozens and
sometimes hundreds of scouting bees canvassing potential options nearby.
The bees return to the group and perform what has come to be known as
what Karl von Frisch, an Austrian-born zoologist and colleague of
Lindauer’s who would later win a Nobel Prize for his work on the
subject, described as a dance language, or Tanzsprache—a method of
communication by the bees that involved rocking their bodies back and
forth in front of onlookers that would gather to watch. Frisch and
Lindauer had discovered that the distance of this dance, that is,
whether the scouting bee walked for a centimeter or two, for example,
was proportional to the distance of the potential nesting site from
which they had returned, and therefore indicated how far of a flight it
would be to get there. In addition, evidence had begun to accumulate
suggesting that the angle of the walk, relative to the position of the
sun, indicated the direction of the new nest site. Over the course of
the afternoon, scouting bees had returned to the main swarm to report
eight potential nesting sites in the area, including a crack at the
molding on top of a nearby window, a woodpecker hole, and a small hollow
in a tree. It had become evident to Frisch and Lindauer that individual
scouting bees would perform dances in favor of different sites and that
the number of scouts that danced in favor of various locations would
allow the hive to essentially vote as to the best option.</p>
<p>The bees, for Lindauer, represented something different in nature.
The swarm that he was observing was not merely a collection of discrete
individual animals. The precision and extent of their coordination, and
lack of any apparent means of centralized management, made clear that
the bees formed a discrete system, a coherent whole, whose capacity for
assessing and adapting to its surroundings would prompt a reassessment
of what constitutes an organism in the decades to come. Lindauer
narrated the scene with a blend of delicacy and reverence, noting that
while two of the eight sites “had already received somewhat more
popularity,” “naturally there was not yet any talk of an agreement.” On
the following day, he noted that the scout bees had seemingly become
less enthused about the north site, presumably because something had
happened overnight, perhaps a deluge of rainwater that had made the nest
unusable.</p>
<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>Locations of Potential Nesting Sites as Indicated by Honeybee Dances
in the Eck Swarm</p>
<p>The swarm adjusted accordingly, and quickly. A new batch of potential
sites were located by the scouts, some of which, Lindauer wrote, “were
only announced by a single dance and received no attention from the
population at large,” while “others were lavished with more attention.”
Over the next several hours, the bees continued to dance in favor of
their preferred nesting sites—a blur of intensity and movement through
which a collection of thousands of individuals were negotiating and
ultimately voting on their top contender for a new home. A particular
spot three hundred meters away eventually “emerged as the favorite,”
Lindauer reported. The remaining holdouts had relented and given in. The
following morning, at 9:40 a.m., Lindauer observed that the entire swarm
of bees, having negotiated over the options and settled on a preferred
location, “took off and moved into its new home.”</p>
<p>The observations of the Eck Swarm, as it would come to be known,
represented a critical moment in our understanding of the behavior of
honeybees and their capacity for communication.[*] But Lindauer’s work
also suggested something more fundamental about the ways in which
groups, and indeed extraordinarily large groups of individual animals,
have the potential to organize themselves around a particular problem
and respond to changing conditions. As one group of researchers has
noted, writing on the implications of the collective decision making of
honeybees and other animals for human organizations, including nurses
and physicians in the health-care field, the social structure of bees
demonstrates “coordinated behaviour that emerges without central
control.”</p>
<p>The startup, in its ideal form, should become a honeybee swarm. Such
coordination and movement, without an overbearing and unnecessarily
centralized mechanism of control, is in many ways the single most
essential feature of successful startup and engineering cultures in the
American context. The bees that Lindauer and others since have studied
do not incorporate caste-based social hierarchies in order to address
the enormous collective action challenges that they face, but rather
distribute autonomy to as great a degree as possible to the fringes—the
scouts—of their organization. The individuals at the periphery of a
group, who often have the latest and most valuable information regarding
the suitability of potential nesting sites, and can take into account
shifting conditions, are the ones who cast their ballots by dancing for
the group. The swarm organizes itself around the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Other species have demonstrated similar patterns of behavior. Giorgio
Parisi, an Italian physicist, has studied starlings for years in the
hope of understanding the means by which they pass information to one
another so quickly and are thus capable of flying in the whirls of
flocks that seem to move as a single unit. In December 2005, he and his
team set up three cameras on the top of the Palazzo Massimo, a building
in central Rome that houses the National Roman Museum. Each of the
cameras was set to photograph the flocks of starlings that routinely
hovered and whirled above the square, taking a total of ten images every
second. He found that the flocks of birds, which to casual observers are
often thought to be spheres or oddly shaped orbs, are actually more like
disks. With his ten images every second, and a three-dimensional
reconstruction of the birds moving through space, Parisi’s team was able
to map the precise position of each bird in a given flock.</p>
<p>As is the case with the honeybees, the movements of the group of
starlings are most often initiated by birds at the edges of the flock,
those with a best vantage of potential predators and the world
outside—not by preordained leaders or chiefs. Guidance as to which
direction the group will be moving is then passed from bird to bird,
from the edges of the flock to its core, within a fraction of a second,
and shared seamlessly across the entire group of hundreds of
individuals. As Parisi wrote, messages regarding which way to fly among
birds in the flock are shared among them “as if by incredibly rapid word
of mouth.”</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>At most human organizations, from government bureaucracies to large
corporations, an enormous amount of the energy and talent of individuals
is directed at jockeying for position, claiming credit for success, and
often desperately avoiding blame for failure. The vital and scarce
creative output of those involved in an endeavor is far too often
misdirected to crafting self-serving hierarchies and patrolling who
reports to whom. Among the bees, however, there is no mediation of the
information captured by the scouts once they return to the hive. And the
starlings do not have to seek permission from higher-ups before they
signal to their neighbors that the flock is turning. There are no weekly
reports to middle management, no presentations to more senior leaders.
No meetings or conference calls to prepare for other meetings. The bee
swarms and flocks of starlings do not consist of layers upon layers of
vice presidents and deputy vice presidents, directing the work of
subgroups of individuals and managing the perceptions of their
superiors. There is only the flock or the swarm. And it is within those
whirls of motion that a certain type of improvisation, and looseness, is
allowed to take form.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>The names of the swarms under observation in many cases came from
their locations in Munich (e.g., the “fence,” “elm,” and “hedge”
swarms). The German word Eck means “corner” in English.</li>
