<h4 id="chapter-eleven-the-improvisational-startup">Chapter Eleven The
Improvisational Startup</h4>
<p>For years, new employees at Palantir were given a copy of a somewhat
obscure book on improvisational theater published in the late 1970s by
Keith Johnstone, a British director and playwright. Johnstone is
credited with articulating much of the theory underlying improv, as it
has come to be known in the United States—an approach to acting that has
in many ways overtaken the contemporary understanding of humor in film
and television culture. The volume is slim and seemingly unrelated to
computer science or building enterprise software. New employees were
often surprised to receive it.</p>
<p>The parallels, however, between improvisational theater and the
plunge into the abyss that is founding or working at a startup are
numerous. To expose oneself on the stage, and to inhabit a character,
require an embrace of serendipity and a level of psychological
flexibility that are essential in building and navigating the growth of
a company that seeks to serve a new market, and indeed participate in
the creation of that market, rather than merely accommodate the needs
and demands of existing ones. There is a breathless, improvisational
quality to building technology. Jerry Seinfeld has said, “In comedy, you
do anything that you think might work. Anything.” The same is true in
tech. The construction of software and technology is an observational
art and science, not a theoretical one. One needs to constantly abandon
perceived notions of what ought to work in favor of what does work. It
is that sensitivity to the audience, the public, and the customer that
allows us to build.</p>
<p>Johnstone’s book also reveals one of the principal features of modern
corporate culture that arguably inhibits the growth of an engineering
mindset—the essential feature of an insurgent startup. He was born in
1933 in Devon, England, along the country’s southwest coast. His father
was a pharmacist, and the family lived above its drugstore downstairs.
In Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre, which was first published in
1979 and has evolved into something of a cult classic among students of
improvisational comedy, Johnstone blends a discussion of acting and
human psychology as he reviews various exercises that he has used in his
theater workshops with aspiring actors and improvisational comedians.
His discussion of status, by which he meant the relative power
relationship between two individuals in a given context, is particularly
relevant for building flexible engineering cultures that are focused on
outcomes as opposed to merely constructing and inhabiting elaborate and
self-serving hierarchies. One of his central insights is that status,
like other character traits, is in many ways played, and that actors and
improvisational comedians can elevate their craft by acquiring and
refining a sensitivity to what Johnstone refers to as the status
transactions and negotiations that result when two individuals encounter
each other in the world. In the context of a lesson on acting, for
example, he observes that subtle gestures and signals between two people
onstage—such as an aversion to eye contact, a nod of the head, or an
attempted interruption by one actor of the other—are all methods of
negotiating and asserting status relationships relative to one another.
The point is that stature, in the world or on the stage, is anything but
fixed or innate. Rather, it is best thought of as an instrumental
attribute or good—one that can, indeed must, be wielded in service of
something else.</p>
<p>Johnstone’s interest and approach to status, and to exposing the
often invisible pecking orders around us, were influenced by the work of
the Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz, particularly his 1949 book, King
Solomon’s Ring, a collection of observations on the social behavior of
various animals, from jackdaws, a relation of ravens and crows, to
wolves. The most dominant jackdaws, for example, are particularly
dismissive of the bottom rungs of their flocks, Lorenz tells us, so much
so that “very high caste jackdaws are most condescending to those of
lowest degree and consider them merely as the dust beneath their feet.”
The same could be said of the rigidity of internal cultures within a
traditional business, with layers upon layers of hierarchy preventing
ambition and ideas from rising to the top. For Johnstone, “every
inflection and movement implies a status,” and “no action is due to
chance, or really ‘motiveless.’ ” In particular, a bifurcation of the
“status you are and the status you play,” as Johnstone put it, is
essential to maneuver effectively on the stage and in the world—to not
be limited by the attempts of others to constrain one’s freedom of
movement from a business or social perspective, or at a minimum to
become more aware of those attempts at domination and to respond
accordingly. One can also more readily identify pockets of talent and
motivation within an organization once the veil of status, the
constricting gauze through which everything is perceived in corporate
life, is lifted.</p>
<p>The broader difficulty of traditional American corporate cultures is
that they tend to require a union of the status that one is and the
status that one plays, at least with respect to the internal forms of
social organization within the business. The senior executive vice
president at a company, for example, is too often a senior executive
vice president in all contexts and for all purposes internally, and his
or her rank with respect to others requires an unwavering dominance in
areas where such dominance may or may not advance the goals of the
institution. A turn toward more rigidity and structure within American
businesses gathered pace after the end of World War II. By the 1960s,
for example, the electronics manufacturer Philco, which was founded in
1892, had created an ornate internal hierarchy with accompanying rule
books that specified the type of furniture executives were allowed to
have in their offices based on their seniority within the company. This
level of rigidity in internal social structure falls far, of course,
from Lindauer’s swarm.</p>
<p>Along the lines of Johnstone’s Impro, we have, at Palantir, attempted
to foster a culture in which status is seen as an instrumental, not
intrinsic, good—something that can be used and deployed in the world to
accomplish other goals or aims. A significant misconception of not only
the organizational culture of Palantir but many other companies with
roots in Silicon Valley is that such companies have flat or no
hierarchies. Every human institution, including the technology giants of
Silicon Valley, has a means of organizing personnel, and such
organization will often require the elevation of certain individuals
over others. The difference is the rigidity of those structures, that
is, the speed with which they can be dismantled or rearranged, and the
proportion of the creative energy of a workforce that goes into
maintaining such structures and to self-promotion within them.</p>
<p>We undoubtedly have some form of “shadow hierarchy” within the
company, power structures that are not telegraphed explicitly but exist
nonetheless. The lack of organizational legibility comes at a cost,
increasing the price of navigation internally, for employees, as well as
for outside partners, who often simply want to know who is in charge.
But many discount the amount of open space that a de-emphasis on
internal signs and signifiers of status, for thousands of employees, can
create. The benefit of it being somewhat unclear or ambiguous who is
leading commercial sales in Scandinavia, for example, is that maybe that
someone should be you. Or what about outreach to state and local
governments in the American Midwest? The point is only that voids or
perceived voids within an organization in our experience have repeatedly
had more benefits than costs, often being filled by ambitious and
talented leaders who see gaps and want to play a role but might
otherwise have been cowed into submission for fear of venturing onto
somebody else’s turf.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>At many large companies across the United States and Europe, and
around the world, it is now commonplace to routinely hold meetings of
twenty, thirty, even fifty or more people on a weekly basis, and
sometimes multiple times per day. More often than not, however, these
gatherings are merely mechanisms through which corporate elites jockey
internally for stature and resources. The faux presentations and talking
points merely serve to advance the interest of politically talented, but
often substantively less valuable, personnel whose principal
contribution to the output of the corporation can be vanishingly hard to
measure. These lengthy meetings are often preceded by even more internal
pre-meetings, where employees prepare to meet with one another.</p>
<p>The meeting-industrial complex has driven some toward the edge and,
apparently, even self-harm. A group of researchers at Harvard Business
School interviewed 182 executives across industries, from the tech
sector to consulting, and found a widespread feeling of being
overwhelmed, suffocated by the volume and duration of meetings in
contemporary corporate culture. One executive even confided that she had
resorted to “stabbing her leg with a pencil to stop from screaming
during a particularly torturous staff meeting.” Such meetings are
mechanisms by which the ambitious self-promoters within an organization
telegraph their status and power, and many talented but less
manipulative colleagues simply choose to relent, at a significant cost
to the institution.</p>
<p>The principal limitation of contemporary corporate cultures is that
the hierarchies and social organization of companies are far too rigid
to accommodate new and shifting challenges. In January 1988, Peter F.
Drucker, the management theorist whose work gave rise to an entire field
of scholarship on the inner workings of large institutions, from General
Electric to IBM, published an essay in Harvard Business Review that
argued a new model of management would soon come to dominate American
businesses and large organizations. It was prescient. A symphony
orchestra, for example, should, based on the prevailing conceptions of
how organizations ought to be structured, have “several group vice
president conductors and perhaps a half-dozen division VP conductors.”
Orchestras, however, had no such layers. As Drucker explained, “There is
only the conductor-CEO—and every one of the musicians plays directly to
that person without an intermediary. And each is a high-grade
specialist, indeed an artist.” Drucker’s central insight was that a
direct line of contact—and indeed eye contact, in the case of an
orchestra conductor—between a corporate leader and the creative
producers within his or her organization is essential. And in our
experience, the most talented software engineers in the world are
artists, no different from painters or musicians. An unnecessarily
structured organization alienates such talent from the goals of the
institution at an enormous cost.</p>
<p>The flaw, and indeed tragedy, of American corporate life is that the
vast majority of an individual employee’s energy during their working
lives is spent merely on survival, navigating among the internal
politicians at their organizations, steering clear of threats, and
forming alliances with friends, perceived and otherwise. We and other
technology startups are the beneficiaries of the sheer exhaustion that
many young and talented people either experience or can sense from the
American corporate model, which can be an unapologetically extractive
enterprise that too often requires a redirection of scarce intellectual
and creative energy toward internal struggles for power and access to
information.</p>
<p>In this way, the legions who have flocked to Silicon Valley are
cultural exiles, many of whom are extraordinarily privileged and
empowered, but misfits and thus exiles nonetheless. They have
consciously chosen to remove themselves from capitalism’s dominant
corporate form and join an alternative model, imperfect and complex, to
be sure, but one that at its best suggests a new means of human
organization. The challenge, in this country and others, will be to
ensure that the most talented minds of our generation do not splinter
off and form their own subcultures and communities separate and apart
from the nation. The homes that they find must be incorporated into the
whole.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>We have over the past century essentially cast culture aside,
dismissing it as overly specific and exclusionary. But in Silicon
Valley—even as many have neglected national interests—a set of cultural
practices has proven so generative of value, that we ought to take them
seriously, and particularly as ideas that might provide a basis for
rethinking our approach to government, and the provision of public
services. Why should the private sector alone be the one to benefit?
Many seem to be watching the rise of Silicon Valley at almost a
distance, eager, of course, to make use of the contraptions and services
that it has produced and occasionally indignant at the industry’s
concentration of power, but essentially observing from afar. Where is
the desire and urgency to co-opt and incorporate the cultural values
that are the precondition for what the Valley has been able to build?
One of the most significant mistakes made by observers of the technology
industry’s rise is to assume that the software produced by such
companies is the reason for their domination of the modern economy. It
is rather a set of cultural biases and practices and norms that make
possible the production of such software, and thus are the underlying
causes of the industry’s success.</p>
<p>The central insight of Silicon Valley was not merely to hire the best
and brightest but to treat them as such, to allow them the flexibility
and freedom and space to create. The most effective software companies
are artist colonies, filled with temperamental and talented souls. And
it is their unwillingness to conform, to submit to power, that is often
their most valuable instinct.</p>
