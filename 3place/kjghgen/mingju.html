<li><p>] John Adams, the second president of the United States, by one
historian’s account was focused on steering the early republic away from
“unprofitable science, identifiable in its focus on objects of vain
curiosity,” and toward more practical forms of inquiry, including
“applying science to the promotion of agriculture.” The innovators of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were often polymaths whose
interests diverged wildly from the contemporary expectation that depth,
as opposed to breadth, is the most effective means of contributing to a
field. The term “scientist” itself was only coined in 1834, to describe
Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and mathematician; prior to that,
the blending of pursuits across physics and the humanities, for
instance, was so commonplace and natural that a more specialized word
had not been needed. Many had little regard for the boundary lines
between disciplines, ranging from areas of study as seemingly unrelated
as linguistics to chemistry, and zoology to physics. The frontiers and
edges of science were still in that earliest stage of expansion. As of
1481, the library at the Vatican, the largest in Europe, had around
thirty-five hundred books and documents. The limited extent of
humanity’s collective knowledge made possible and encouraged an
interdisciplinary approach that would almost be certain to stall an
academic career today. That cross-pollination, as well as the absence of
a rigid adherence to the boundaries between disciplines, was vital to a
willingness to experiment, and to the confidence of political leaders to
opine on engineering and technical questions that implicated matters of
government.</p></li>
<li><p>We have, in the modern era, crowded out technical minds from
electoral office. There are notable exceptions. Margaret Thatcher, for
example, worked as a chemist at a plastics firm before becoming the
British prime minister, and Angela Merkel earned a doctorate in quantum
chemistry in East Germany prior to serving as chancellor. Yet
contemporary democratic regimes have not placed scientists at their
center. A survey conducted in 2023 found that only 1.3 percent of state
legislators in the United States were either scientists or
engineers.</p></li>

<li><p>2] For years, many were convinced that SpaceX’s reusable rockets
were “a fool’s errand” and that Musk was “flat-out wasting his time,”
according to a 2015 biography of the founder. Any curiosity or genuine
interest in the value of what he has created is essentially dismissed,
or perhaps lurks from beneath a thinly veiled scorn. The irony is that
many of those who profess most strenuously that they oppose the excesses
of capitalism are often the first in line to skewer those who have the
audacity to attempt building something that the market has failed to
provide. More ambition and seriousness of purpose, not less, are needed.
Is the iPhone, for example, our greatest creative if not crowning
achievement as a civilization? The object has changed our lives, but it
may also now be limiting and constraining our sense of the possible. As
Peter Thiel observed in an interview in 2011, the radical and
discontinuous leap forward of the Apollo space program, not the
incremental advances in the capabilities of consumer gadgets, should be
the bar by which we judge ourselves and assess human progress.</p></li>

<li><p>1 Some have argued that U.S. leaders believed, even at the time
in 1945, that the collapse of the Japanese empire would have occurred
without the use of atomic weapons. See, for example, Gar Alperovitz,
“Hiroshima: Historians Reassess,” Foreign Policy, no. 99 (Summer 1995):
15.</p></li>

Theodore Roosevelt—“those cold and timid souls” who know “neither

<li><p>3 The misdirection of our attention and resources to such
endeavors is not the result of some nefarious plot, but rather the
consequence of a failure of will and imagination by those at the helm.
As a nation, we should move to build, for example, a technological peace
corps—an institution through which curious and talented engineering
minds whose efforts might otherwise be co-opted to further refine online
advertising algorithms could instead be directed to addressing glaring
innovation gaps across education, medicine, national defense, and basic
science in the United States and abroad.</p></li>

<li><p>2] The means by which the Chinese government patrolled the
boundaries of speech, however, were far more subversive in Link’s view,
and in many ways more closely approximate the contemporary model of
attempts to constrain speech in the United States. Link wrote that the
Chinese government “rejected these more mechanical methods” of
censorship used by the Soviet regime “in favor of an essentially
psychological control system,” in which each individual must assess the
risk of a statement against what Link describes as “a dull,
well-entrenched leeriness” of disapproval by the state.</p></li>
<li><p>1 Appeals to virtue and character, having been excluded for the
most part from the civic and political realms, have migrated, or rather,
been co-opted and appropriated, by the corporate. In 2013, Ram Trucks
produced a television commercial featuring a speech titled “So God Made
a Farmer” from 1978 by Paul Harvey, a radio broadcaster born in Tulsa,
Oklahoma. The speech hailed the American farmer, who, among other
things, was “willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt, and watch
it die, and dry his eyes, and say maybe next year.” It was poignant and
powerful—yet all in service of selling a pickup truck. We have, quite
unwittingly, ceded direction over our interior lives, the development of
our moral selves, to the market.</p></li>
<li><p>2 One Soviet directive from the 1920s listed ninety-six
categories of information that were prohibited, including facts and
statistics regarding “sanitary conditions in places of incarceration,”
“clashes between the authorities and peasants during the implementation

caused by unemployment and hunger.”</p></li>

<li><p>1] The ubiquitous off-ramps and backup plans among the current
generation, and instinct to burnish the rough edges off of one’s
opinions, stand in opposition to throwing oneself into an endeavor with
the abandon, nearly reckless, that is required to succeed, or at least
fail in a sufficiently substantial way that provokes
development.</p></li>

<li><p>4] In Baltzell’s view, an aristocracy driven by talent is an
essential feature of any republic. The challenge is ensuring that such
aristocracies remain open to new members and do not descend into mere
caste structures, which close their ranks along racial or religious
lines. “If an upper class degenerates into a caste,” Baltzell wrote,
“the traditional authority of an establishment is in grave danger of
disintegrating, while society becomes a field for careerists seeking
success and affluence.” The challenge for any organization, and indeed
nation, is finding ways of empowering a group of leaders without
incentivizing them to spend more effort guarding the trappings and
perquisites of office than advancing the goals of the group. The caste
structures that have formed within countless organizations around the
world—from federal bureaucracies to international agencies to academic
institutions and Silicon Valley technology giants—must be challenged and
dismantled if those institutions have any hope of survival over the long
term.</p></li>
<li><p>5] Such reluctance was born of a desire to accommodate all views
and values. But a tolerance of everything has the tendency to devolve
into support of nothing. The antiseptic nature of modern discourse,
dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it
comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own
reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the
disapproval of the crowd. Yet there is too much that lies “beyond
justice,” in the words of Ágnes Heller, the Hungarian philosopher born
in Budapest in 1929. As Heller writes, “Justice is the skeleton: the
good life is the flesh and blood.” The implications for everything from
technology to art are significant.</p></li>
<li><p>1 Hernán Cortés, the Spanish governor of Cuba in the sixteenth
century, did not in fact burn his ships as is often suggested but rather
likely had his crew run them aground in 1519 on the beach of Veracruz,
on the eastern coast of Mexico. He destroyed at least nine of his ships
in an attempt to deprive his men of the opportunity to mutiny and sail
back to Cuba on their own, providing them with the option to return home
on a lone remaining vessel but only, according to one historian, “to
discover who the cowards and untrustworthy ones were.”</p></li>

<li><p>4 Those who bristle at descriptions of a coastal or transatlantic
elite ought to consider how far we have traveled as a nation since 1937,
when Ferdinand Lundberg published America’s 60 Families, which made the
case that the United States was “owned and dominated” by a first tier of
“its sixty richest families,” including the Astors, Du Ponts, Mellons,
and Vanderbilts, followed by a second, ancillary tier of “ninety
families of lesser wealth.”</p></li>

requirements of justice, as opposed to “the good,” that is, the many and

<li><p>1] But while his frame was certainly reductionist—indeed, its
appeal stemmed from its apparent precision—the wholesale revolt against
Huntington would end up crowding out most serious normative discussions
about the role of culture in shaping everything from international
relations to economic development. Where were the fault lines between
cultures? Which cultures were aligned with the advancement of the
interests of their publics? And what should be the role of the nation in
articulating or defending a sense of national culture? The entire

<li><p>2] Appiah, for example, has argued in favor of abandoning the
“idea of western civilisation,” which for him has been “at best the
source of a great deal of confusion” and “at worst an obstacle to facing
some of the great political challenges of our time.” The West, for
Appiah and many others, became an object of moral scorn, impeding our
understanding of history, burdening the task of interpretation with a
cumbersome narrative architecture that obscured more than it
enlightened. The edifice, they argued, must be torn down.</p></li>

<li><p>3 Some have read Said too expansively and been too aggressive in

of those charged with finding them needed to be exposed in order to have

<li><p>] His insights, however, were often all the more penetrating. In
an essay on human aggression published in 1947, Parsons observed that
many men “will inevitably feel they have been unjustly treated, because
there is in fact much injustice, much of which is very deeply rooted in
the nature of the society, and because many are disposed to be paranoid
and see more injustice than actually exists.” And he went further. The
feeling of being “unjustly treated,” Parsons noted, is “not only a balm
to one’s sense of resentment, it is an alibi for failure.”</p></li>

imperfections and apparent contradictions of the systems and processes
that one is charged with shaping is the source of progress, not its
impediment. A commitment to this sort of pragmatism, or indeed the
engineering mindset that has given rise to the Valley, “discourages
dogmatism,” as Dewey wrote, “arouses and heartens an experimental spirit
which wants to know how systems and theories work before giving complete

of an idea. The first stage, he wrote in 1952, “is characterized by the
feeling of being driven, the experience of rapture, and the conviction
that an outside agent acts through the creator.”</p></li>

leaders drafted into service nearly against their will, is ancient.
Plato, in The Republic, claimed that “good men will not consent to

<li><p>1 One art historian has noted that while the Sirens were
initially conceived of as “birds with the faces of women” in ancient
Greek and Roman artwork of the scene from Homer’s Odyssey, they
eventually became “conflated with mermaids in the Middle Ages.”</p></li>
<li><p>2 The conceit of this era of ethnography was that the peoples who
were the object of study were fixed in time, essentially lacking the
capacity to move or develop through history. Margaret Mead, who was one
of Benedict’s students, was one of a generation of cultural
anthropologists who used what has been described as the “ethnographic
present” in recounting the lives of the young women and others about
whom she wrote in Coming of Age in Samoa, published in 1928. Her
subjects not only existed apart from the world but were also
“grammatically frozen at the moment she had observed them—swims, eats,
tells, knows,” as the author Charles King has noted.</p></li>
<li><p>3 John Rawls contended that an aspiration for political
liberalism to remain “neutral in aim” did not preclude the possibility
that it could “still affirm the superiority of certain forms of moral
character and encourage certain moral virtues.” But his roster of
virtues, including “fair social cooperation,” “civility,” “tolerance,”
and “reasonableness,” has proven limited and modest—a collection of
essentially unobjectionable background requirements for the operation of
civil society that did not allow for any richness or cultural
specificity in public life.</p></li>
