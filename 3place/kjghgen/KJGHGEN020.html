<h4 id="chapter-fourteen-a-cloud-or-a-clock">Chapter Fourteen A Cloud or
a Clock</h4>
<p>The American artist Thomas Hart Benton, who painted murals in the
early part of the twentieth century, declined to jettison his
representational approach even as modernism seemed to be sweeping away
forms of art that could be readily deciphered. He taught at the Art
Students League of New York for years, and his most famous student,
Jackson Pollock, seemed ambivalent about his teacher’s influence; the
two had a long tangle of a friendship. In an interview with Art and
Architecture magazine in 1944, Pollock offered a bit of begrudging
praise for his former instructor, explaining that “it was better to have
worked with him than with a less resistant personality.” Benton
initially thought little of Pollock’s canvases, describing them as
“paint-spilling innovations” and “scorned the idea of their possessing
any long-term value.”</p>
<p>The modern enterprise is often too quick to avoid such friction. We
have today privileged a kind of ease in corporate life, a culture of
agreeableness that can move institutions away, not toward, creative
output. The impulse—indeed rush—to smooth over any hint of conflict
within businesses and government agencies is misguided, leaving many
with the misimpression that a life of ease awaits and rewarding those
whose principal desire is the approval of others. As the comedian John
Mulaney has said, “Likability is a jail.”</p>
<p>The casual and unrelenting pressure to revert to the mean, to do what
has been done before, to eliminate the wrong types of risks from a
business at precisely the wrong times, and to avoid confrontation is
everywhere and often tempting. But the culture’s move to accommodate the
subjective reality of its students and employees has only inflamed the
sense of grievance and affliction that some feel. The rise of trigger
warnings and other forms of acquiescence behind which the left has
zealously rallied for more than a decade has backfired spectacularly, by
fostering a sense of harm that often does not exist. Richard Alan
Friedman, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Weil Cornell Medical
College, said in an interview that, beginning in 2016 or so, he began
seeing an increase in reports of students alleging that they had been
“harmed by things that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable,” and that the
language they used, describing unease upon hearing comments in class,
for example, “seemed inflated relative to the actual harm that could be
done.”</p>
<p>This is a grievance industry, and it is at risk of depriving a
generation of the fierceness and sense of proportion that are essential
to becoming a full participant in this world. A certain psychological
resilience and indeed indifference to the opinion of others are required
if one is to have any hope of building something substantial and
differentiated. The artist and the founder alike are often “the mad
ones,” as Jack Kerouac wrote in On the Road, “the ones who are mad to
live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same
time.” The challenge, of course, is that some of the most compelling and
authentic nonconformists, the artists and iconoclasts, make for
notoriously difficult colleagues.</p>
<p>In the context of a creative endeavor, such as a technology startup
or an artistic movement, the blank slate of human desire poses a
fundamental challenge. We instinctively look to one another for guidance
as to what is desirable, and as a consequence the intentions of others
are often adopted wholesale and without reflection, left to grow within
ourselves. René Girard, the French anthropologist, observed the
conflicts and rivalries between monkeys that arise when one member
within a group selects a single banana out of many, all of which are
identical. “There is nothing special about the disputed banana,” Girard
said in an interview in 1983, “except that the first to choose selected
it, and this initial selection, however casual, triggered a chain
reaction of mimetic desire that made that one banana seem preferable to
all others.”</p>
<p>Our earliest encounters with learning are through mimicry. But at
some point, that mimicry becomes toxic to creativity. Some never make
the transition from a sort of creative infancy. Much of what passes for
innovation in Silicon Valley is, of course, something less—more an
attempt to replicate what has worked or at least was perceived to have
worked in the past. This mimicry can sometimes yield fruit. But more
often than not it is derivative and retrograde. The best investors and
founders are sensitive to this distinction and survive because they have
actively resisted the urge to construct imperfect imitations of prior
successes. The act of rebellion that involves building something from
nothing—whether it is a poem from a blank page, a painting from a
canvas, or software code on a screen—by definition requires a rejection
of what has come before. It involves the bracing conclusion that
something new is necessary. The hubris involved in the act of
creation—that determination that all that has been produced to date, the
sum product of humanity’s output, is not precisely what ought or need be
built at a given moment—is present within every founder or
artist.[*1]</p>
<p>For a startup, or any organization that seeks to challenge an
incumbent, the sort of mindless conformity that dominates modern
commerce—an unwillingness to risk the disapproval of the crowd—can be
lethal. In 1841, Ralph Waldo Emerson published “Self-Reliance,” his
enduring broadside against religious dogmatism, in which he railed
against individual weakness in the face of institutional pressure. “For
nonconformity,” he reminds us, “the world whips you with its
displeasure.” Emerson made clear that the desire to conform not merely
to those around you but to one’s prior views on a subject can be just as
limiting and indeed hobbling. The permanence of our thoughts and writing
on the internet for all time—and the zeal with which the crowd confronts
individuals who dare to venture into public life with perceived
inconsistencies in their prior statements—only risk confining us
further, into a straitjacket of our former selves. But Emerson is right
to ask, “Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict
somewhat you have stated in this or that public place?…Leave your
theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.” We
count ourselves among those who have repeatedly fled, abandoning failed
projects within days of a lack of progress being surfaced and
deconstructing dysfunctional teams. At other times, we certainly have
been more timid, proceeding far too cautiously to reverse prior
judgments and investments, in both particular people and projects. But
the public, investing and otherwise, is often far too unforgiving of
retreats and pivots, of revisions to plans and missteps. Nothing of
consequence is built in a straight line. A voracious pragmatism is
needed, as well as a willingness to bend one’s model of the world to the
evidence at hand, not bend the evidence.</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>When Isaiah Berlin wrote his essay The Hedgehog and the Fox, in 1953,
the computing revolution was still far off. But there is no question
that the ferocity of Silicon Valley’s ascent, and by extension that of
the United States, stems in significant part from the culture of the
small tract of land south of San Francisco, in which an almost ruthless
pragmatism took hold. For Berlin, there was a “great chasm” between the
hedgehogs among us in the world, “who relate everything to a single
central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms
of which they understand, think and feel,” and the foxes, “who pursue
many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all,
only in some de facto way.” Berlin built something rich and enduring
upon the thinnest of foundations—a single line, a fragment of a poem
from the Greek poet Archilochus, who was born on an island in the middle
of the Aegean Sea in the early seventh century B.C. “The fox knows many
things,” Archilochus wrote, “but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” And
Silicon Valley is the consummate fox.</p>
<p>The founders and technologists who have constructed and will continue
to construct the modern world willingly abandoned grand theories and
overarching belief structures to build, indeed often build anything, as
long as it worked. The distinguishing feature of technology, and in
particular software, is that either it runs or it does not. There is no
halfway, no almost, when it comes to software. The programmer is
confronted with failure immediately. No amount of discussion or
posturing can change whether the program performed as it should. Herbert
Hoover, who studied geology at Stanford University, worked in the mining
industry for nearly two decades, first during the gold rush in the 1890s
in Western Australia, then a British colony, and later in Tianjin,
China. He wrote in his memoirs that the “great liability of the engineer
compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the
open where all can see them,” and that the engineer “cannot bury his
mistakes in the grave like the doctors,” or “argue them into thin air or
blame the judge like the lawyers.” It is this sensitivity to results,
and to failure, and perhaps an abandonment of grand theories of how the
world ought to be, or how things ought to work, that is the seed of an
engineering culture.</p>
<p>It is essential that the engineer—whether of the mechanical world,
the digital, or even perhaps the written—descend from his or her tower
of theory into the morass of actual details as they exist, not as they
have been theorized to be. One must, as the American philosopher John
Dewey wrote in his essay “Pragmatic America” in 1922, “get down from
noble aloofness into the muddy stream of concrete things.”[*2] An
emotional and often physical proximity to the mess of imperfections and
apparent contradictions of the systems and processes that one is charged
with shaping is the source of progress, not its impediment. A commitment
to this sort of pragmatism, or indeed the engineering mindset that has
given rise to the Valley, “discourages dogmatism,” as Dewey wrote,
“arouses and heartens an experimental spirit which wants to know how
systems and theories work before giving complete adhesion,” and
“militates against too sweeping and easy generalizations.”</p>
<p>A certain ravenous pragmatism and insensitivity to calculation had
been lost on the current generation. After the end of World War II, U.S.
defense and intelligence agencies launched a massive and secret effort
to recruit Nazi scientists, in order to retain an advantage in the
coming years in developing rockets and jet engines. At least sixteen
hundred German scientists and their families were relocated to the
United States. Some were skeptical about this late embrace of the former
enemy. An officer in the U.S. Air Force urged his commander to set aside
any distaste for recruiting the German scientists to this new cause,
writing in a letter that there was an immense amount to be learned from
this “German-born information,” if only “we are not too proud.”</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>In his book Expert Political Judgment, published in 2005, Philip E.
Tetlock, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania,
recounted being shown a demonstration in the 1970s that “pitted the
predictive abilities of a classroom of Yale undergraduates against those
of a single Norwegian rat.” The challenge was to determine on which side
of a small maze, left or right, a piece of food would be hidden. The
experimenters would place food on the left side of the maze 60 percent
of the time and the right side 40 percent of the time using a randomized
selection process. The Yale students watched the rat attempt to ferret
out the food, puzzling over potential patterns and grander schemes that
might have lurked behind its placement. The rat, however, simply wanted
to eat. And it turns out, the rat, not the undergraduates, was better at
predicting where the food would be.</p>
<p>As Tetlock explained, the human mind was bested by the animal in the
maze study “because we are, deep down, deterministic thinkers with an
aversion to probabilistic strategies that accept the inevitability of
error.” The search for grand theories, for underlying systems and
mechanisms of action in the world, in any other number of domains, from
physics to medicine, has provided us with an enormous advantage, Tetlock
acknowledged. Eugene Wigner, a theoretical physicist who was born in
Budapest in 1902, famously observed the “uncanny usefulness of
mathematical concepts.” But that same drive for systematic theories of
the world, for coherence at the expense of an effective muddle, has also
left us with a persistent blind spot and resistance to embracing the
instruction that the universe provides, even if its internal logic may
be beyond us.</p>
<p>Tetlock’s broader interest and project involved testing the accuracy
of predictions made by political experts when confronted with questions
about developments in global affairs. He and his team solicited and
compiled a total of 27,451 forecasts made by experts starting in the
1980s, covering a range of political questions from the fate of the
Soviet Union, whether South Africa would continue to maintain minority
rule, and if Quebec would secede from Canada. Tetlock was interested in
assessing which experts, among his panel, would be able to “ ‘beat’ the
dart-throwing chimp” in making predictions about future historical
events. It turns out that the 284 experts, that is, the academics and
policy wonks selected to participate in Tetlock’s study over the course
of nearly two decades, did not generally fare better than chance. Some
of the nearly three hundred experts, however, did outperform.</p>
<p>Tetlock had divided his specialists into groups of thinkers—foxes and
hedgehogs—based on their responses to survey questions regarding the way
that they approached intellectual challenges and problem-solving. And
the foxes won.</p>
<p>Figure 12</p>
<p>Accuracy of Predictions Made by “Foxes” and “Hedgehogs” in Philip
Tetlock’s Review of 284 Experts</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to measure what Tetlock described as
“foxiness.” One could simply ask the expert whether he or she identifies
more as a fox or a hedgehog, while explaining Isaiah Berlin’s framework.
And Tetlock did. But he also posed other questions to the experts,
including whether they believed politics was more “cloudlike” or
“clocklike,” in an effort to tease out some of the same types of
instincts. Those who described politics and history as more like a cloud
than a clock, with its mechanistic precision and regularity, turned out
to be significantly better predictors. The “worst performers,” according
to Tetlock, “were hedgehog extremists making long-term predictions in
their domains of expertise.”</p>
<hr />
<p>• • •</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Taiichi Ohno, a senior executive at Toyota Motor
Corporation, published a book describing the Japanese automaker’s
reinvention of industrial manufacturing and articulated an approach to
root-cause analysis that we adopted nearly twenty years ago and continue
to use to this day. The method of inquiry has been essential in our
ability to identify the fundamental, rather than superficial, causes of
issues that inevitably arise across a company. The approach, on its
face, is straightforward: ask why a problem occurred, and then ask why
again four more times. We and others call it, very inventively, of
course, the Five Whys. In the context of an industrial manufacturing
facility, Ohno provided an example of a machine that stopped working
because of an overloaded fuse, which upon further inquiry had been
caused by a broken pump and ultimately worn metal parts.</p>
<p>For Ohno, who was born in 1912 in Manchuria just after the fall of
the Qing dynasty, the method of inquiry focused on identifying the
engineering flaws at the root of a problem. His father worked for the
South Manchuria Railway, which was operated across an outpost of the
Japanese empire in northeast China. Identifying the reasons for the
failure of a system, whether it be an enterprise software platform or an
assembly line for internal combustion engines, necessarily requires a
focus on the inner workings and mechanics of the system at issue.</p>
<p>At Palantir, we build on this method of inquiry to incorporate an
analysis and indeed acknowledgment of the human systems that are
precursors to the software that we are building. Why did an essential
update to an enterprise software platform not ship by a Friday deadline?
Because the team had only two days to review the draft code. Why did the
team have only two days to review? Because it had lost six software
engineers in the budget review cycle late last year. Why did its budget
decrease? Because the head of the group had shifted priorities elsewhere
at the request of another group lead. Why was the request made to shift
priorities? Because a new compensation model had been rolled out
incentivizing growth in certain areas over others. And one can go even
further, of course. Why were certain areas selected at the expense of
others? Because of an ongoing feud at the company between two senior
executives.</p>
<p>In this example, a missed deadline for shipping an update to a
software system was, at its root, caused not by an individual engineer’s
oversight or even the team’s failure to think ahead, but rather by an
ongoing and increasingly adversarial interpersonal conflict at the
highest rungs of the company. This sort of corporate butterfly effect is
anything but new to those whose professions require subjecting oneself
and submitting to the vicissitudes of modern corporate life. But what we
have found is that those who are willing to chase the causal thread, and
really follow it where it leads, can often unravel the knots that hold
organizations back. It takes persistence and a willingness to dig beyond
the first layers of a problem. The psychological dispositions and
decision-making instincts of leaders within the company are often at the
core of the challenge.</p>
<p>The exercise works most effectively if those involved resist the urge
to assign blame to their colleagues and instead focus on the
structural—and indeed often interpersonal—issues that gave rise to the
mistakes at hand. We have conducted thousands of these Five Whys reviews
over the past twenty years and draft detailed written reports that
attempt to document, without assigning blame to individuals, the
systemic and root causes of the problems that arise. The reasons for any
complex system’s failure, human and otherwise, can often feel beyond
reach because of the difficulty, and patience required, of tracing the
multiple and related chains of causation that lead through the labyrinth
of the institutions and incentives we construct. A mistake, such as a
missed deadline or lackluster product launch, often finds its root in
the tangle of human relationships that make up the organization involved
in the endeavor. The approach is an outgrowth of an engineering culture
that at its best is unwaveringly focused on understanding what is
working well and what is not. The challenge is fostering a sufficiently
gentle and forgiving internal culture that encourages the most talented
and high-integrity minds within an organization to come forward and
report problems rather than hide them. Most companies are populated with
people so fearful of losing their jobs that any hint of dysfunction is
quickly covered up. Others are simply trying to make it to their
retirement without being discovered as providing little or no value to
the organization. Many more are monetizing the decline of empires they
had once built.</p>
<p>It is a willingness to respond to the world as it is, not as we wish
it might be, that has been a principal reason that the latest generation
of Silicon Valley behemoths have come as far as they have. As Lucian
Freud, the German-born figurative painter, perhaps the most enduring of
the twentieth century, put it, “I try to paint what is actually there.”
The act of observation, of looking closely while suspending
judgment—taking the facts in and resisting the urge to impose one’s view
on them—sits at the heart of any engineering culture, including ours.
Freud, who was born in Berlin in 1922, was the grandson of Sigmund
Freud, the psychoanalyst whose interrogations of the human mind
transformed our willingness and ability to investigate our own
psychology. The act of penetrating observation was essential to Lucian’s
portraits, which he has described as a sort of negotiation between
artist and subject. They are unsparing and quite intimate, both bracing
and gentle. His gaze, long and patient, sits at the heart of his work.
Martin Gayford, a British art critic, has said that Freud “revived the
figurative tradition” in the last century, a tradition that had fallen
out of favor and was at risk of being eclipsed entirely. The artist once
told an interviewer, “It can be extraordinary how much you can learn
from someone, and perhaps about yourself, by looking very carefully at
them, without judgment.” It is this approach to observation, to looking
closely at the clouds around us, while suspending judgment, that forms
the foundation of the engineering mindset. The challenge we now face, in
rebuilding a technological republic, is directing that engineering
instinct, an indeed ruthless pragmatism, toward the nation’s shared
goals, which can be identified only if we take the risk of defining who
we are or aspire to be.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 For Ernst Kris, the Austrian psychoanalyst, the creation of art
involved two independent processes, the channeling of “impulses and
drives,” often sublimated and beyond the reach of expression, as well as
“work,” the “dedication and concentration” required for the elaboration
of an idea. The first stage, he wrote in 1952, “is characterized by the
feeling of being driven, the experience of rapture, and the conviction
that an outside agent acts through the creator.”</p>
<p>*2 Dewey took pride in the fact that pragmatism, as he wrote, “was
born upon American soil.”</p>
