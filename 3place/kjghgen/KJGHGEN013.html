<h4 id="chapter-eight-flawed-systems">Chapter Eight “Flawed
Systems”</h4>
<p>In January 1970, Time magazine named “the Middle Americans” as person
of the year. It was a departure from the publication’s ordinary practice
of highlighting a specific individual and his or her contributions on
the national or international stage. After the convulsions of the 1960s,
including the decade’s radicalism and challenge to the reigning order,
“the Middle Americans,” a cohort in the metaphorical heartland of the
country, far from its coasts, “feared that they were beginning to lose
their grip on the country,” the magazine wrote. “Others seemed to be
taking over—the liberals, the radicals, the defiant young,” Time
continued. “No one celebrated them; intellectuals dismissed their lore
as banality.”</p>
<p>The same might be said today. By the early 1970s, the divide that
would come to structure contemporary American politics, including the
current fissures in society half a century later, had begun to open. The
division of the country by Time into two parts, core and periphery, was
an oversimplification, at best, and, at worst, a knowing appeal to a
conception of American identity that predated the inclusion of a far
more diverse array of minorities and immigrants. But it also captured an
emerging fault line that would come to dominate American politics for
decades—a divide that has only ever been loosely about policy
disagreements, one that was more fundamentally concerned with culture
and identity. The attacks at the time on conceptions of Western
civilization, and more specifically on the internal contradictions of
the American project—its claim to equality for all yet enforcement of
discriminatory laws across broad swaths of the South—had only heightened
the conflict. And the war in Vietnam, which seemed to have no end, along
with the rise of the civil rights movement, including its direct attack
on institutional complacency, had given rise to a thriving
counterculture and challenge to the American establishment.</p>
<p>It was against this backdrop that the first glimmers of the digital
revolution, of software and personal computing, and indeed artificial
intelligence, took shape. The earliest collaborators and participants in
the development of what would become the personal computer in the 1960s
and 1970s were skeptical of government authority and had largely
constructed their own identities and sense of self in opposition to the
state. Lee Felsenstein, for example, who was born in Philadelphia in
1945 and later moved to Menlo Park, California, where he formed what
would come to be known as the Homebrew Computer Club, one of the early
groups that was focused on building prototypes of smaller computers for
individual use, wrote, “We wanted there to be personal computers so that
we could free ourselves from the constraints of institutions, whether
government or corporate.” The personal computer, as pioneers like
Felsenstein saw it, was a means of liberation and emancipation from
government, not cooperation with it. Stewart Brand, co-founder of the
Whole Earth Catalog, an influential compendium for the counterculture
movement of the 1960s, wrote in a 1995 essay that “the counterculture’s
scorn for centralized authority provided the philosophical foundations
of not only the leaderless Internet but also the entire
personal-computer revolution.”</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the emerging set of technologies that would become the
modern-day personal computer, as well as software more broadly, was
being reinvented as a means of empowerment of the individual against the
state, not a set of tools to be leveraged by the state to advance the
national interest. It was an era of innovation in Silicon Valley that
was driven by a mistrust of national governments, as well as frustration
with their delay in adopting progressive reforms at home and their grand
experiments and military misadventures on the world stage. This was not
the technological revolution of Vannevar Bush or J. Robert Oppenheimer,
who through much of their lives saw the purpose of technology as
extending and enabling the American project. The individual, and later
the consumer more specifically, would emerge as the principal object of
this new industry’s desire and attention.</p>
<p>In 1984, the author and journalist Steven Levy published Hackers:
Heroes of the Computer Revolution, an influential chronicle of that
early period of innovation in software and personal computing. Levy
articulated the ethos of the moment, which was deeply skeptical of
institutional and state power. “Bureaucracies, whether corporate,
government, or university,” he wrote, “are flawed systems, dangerous in
that they cannot accommodate the exploratory impulse of true hackers,”
designed “to consolidate power, and perceive the constructive impulse of
hackers as a threat.” The human systems that government had created were
too inflexible; new systems had to be built based on logic and rules
instead of the capricious dictates of the elected class. The object of
Levy’s critique, as well as that of his confederates at the time, was a
calcifying American corporate culture. Levy described the IBM of the
era, for example, as “a clumsy, hulking company that did not understand
the hacking impulse.” The distaste for the corporate monoliths was
nearly as much aesthetic as it was ethical. He continued: “All you had
to do was look at someone in the IBM world and note the button-down
white shirt, the neatly pinned black tie, the hair carefully held in
place, and the tray of punch cards in hand.” And it was the conformity
of those institutions that was thought to be central to their inability
to drive change. For this emerging generation of hackers, the
corporatism of postwar America and the apparatus of government were
acting in concert to constrain innovation. The software and early
computing devices that Felsenstein and others were building in Silicon
Valley were intended to serve as a challenge to state power, not to
enable it. They were not building software systems for defense and
intelligence agencies, and they were certainly not building bombs.</p>
<p>This revolution, however, like others before it, would ultimately
abandon much of its own idealism. The broader issue was that the “we” or
“us” of America had so thoroughly been challenged and
deconstructed—problematized, in the language of graduate school seminars
today—that an entire generation of technologists turned its attention
elsewhere, to the individual consumer. Steve Jobs, in particular, was a
product of a waning counterculture movement in the United States,
searching for purpose and direction after the conflict and storm of the
1960s began to recede. As an undergraduate at Reed College, Jobs, who
would go on to lead Apple, which by some estimates would become the most
valuable corporate enterprise in the history of civilization, immersed
himself in a calligraphy class, where he recounted to his biographer
Walter Isaacson that he “learned about serif and sans serif typefaces,
about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,
about what makes great typography great.” His immersion in letterforms
was not a detour from his core, animating interests. It was a result of
them. Jobs continued: “It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle
in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.” This
blend of artistry and engineering would become the hallmark of Jobs’s
design sensibility and was, for Isaacson, “yet another example of Jobs
consciously positioning himself at the intersection of the arts and
technology.” To be clear, Jobs was a radical and creative savant who saw
the future and made it real. His ambition was to remake the world, not
tinker at its margins. When attempting to court John Sculley, then
president of PepsiCo, to persuade him to join Apple as chief executive
officer, Jobs reportedly asked him, “Do you want to spend the rest of
your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the
world?”</p>
<p>Jobs’s revolution, however, was essentially intimate and personal.
His principal focus was on constructing the products—including the
mobile phones that now coexist with us on our person throughout our
lives—that would liberate the individual from reliance on a corporate or
governmental superstructure. And he did. His interest was not in
building the means to advance a broader American or national project, or
in enabling a closer collaboration between the technology industry and
the state. Indeed, Apple objected to attempts by the U.S. government,
including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to unlock its iPhones in
connection with investigations in criminal cases. The products that Jobs
and Apple built were focused on the power and creativity of the
individual mind and as a result were extensions, often literally—in the
form of phones, wristwatches, personal computers, and the mouse—of the
self.</p>
<p>For Apple in the early 1980s, the personal computer presented a
challenge to, not an embrace of, the authority of government and the
state. The company’s iconic “1984” advertising campaign featured a
dystopia of conformity, filled with hundreds of gray souls mindlessly
listening to the directives of an Orwellian overlord speaking to the
assembled flock on a large screen. A woman, dressed in bright tangerine
running shorts, sprints through the crowd and throws a sledgehammer at
the screen, smashing it and, for the viewer, suggesting the liberation
of the masses. The television ad, directed by Ridley Scott, pitted the
emancipatory potential of the Macintosh computer against the then
reigning IBM, which had produced the gigantic mainframe computers of an
earlier generation that often literally filled entire rooms.</p>
<p>Those mainframes, hulking and immovable, would only, Apple implicitly
argued, hasten our enslavement by the state. The Macintosh, by contrast,
weighed seventeen pounds and had a handle on the top, so that it could
literally be picked up and carried short distances by a single person.
An initial draft of the advertisement warned ominously that “there are
monster computers lurking in big business and big government that know
everything from what motels you’ve stayed at to how much money you have
in the bank.” The message was clear: the new personal computer of the
era would provide a counterweight to the institutional power of
government and industry, not advance their interests at the expense of
the individual.</p>
<p>Our point is only that the rush of attention and funding dedicated to
the concerns and needs of the modern American, and later global,
consumer was anything but inevitable. It was the product of a set of
proclivities and instincts of those early founders, as well as the
social and cultural milieu in which they came of age. They had ambition,
no doubt. But much of their focus was on the individual, his and her
concerns and needs. And it was a near-obsessive focus on those concerns
and needs—and the sheer brilliance of the contraptions and software
products constructed to address them—that paved the way for another
generation of founders, in the first part of this century, who would
create the consumer internet. The era of online advertising,
photo-sharing apps, and food delivery empires was near. This next
generation of innovators would go even further than the prior,
abandoning even the pretext of claims to a broader political project, to
the liberating potential of technology. They instead entered into a far
more mercenary and straightforward service of the material culture of
the time.</p>
