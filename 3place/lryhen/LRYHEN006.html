<h4 id="fifth-day">Fifth Day</h4>
<p>Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills
you, he thought. Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All
right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table?</p>
<p>“Now!” he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard
of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm
alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the
pivoted weight of his body. Nothing happened. The fish just moved away
slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch. His line was strong
and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so
taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a
slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself
against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to
move slowly off toward the north-west. The fish moved steadily and they
travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the
water but there was nothing to be done.</p>
<p>“I wish I had the boy” the old man said aloud. “I’m being towed by a
fish and I’m the towing bitt. I could make the line fast. But then he
could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must
have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down.”</p>
<p>What I will do if he decides to go down, I don’t know. What I’ll do
if he sounds and dies I don’t know. But I’ll do something. There are
plenty of things I can do. He held the line against his back and watched
its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the north-west.
This will kill him, the old man thought. He can’t do this forever. But
four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing
the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across
his back.</p>
<p>“It was noon when I hooked him,” he said. “And I have never seen
him.”</p>
<p>He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked
the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got
down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as
far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one
hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow.
He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think
but only to endure. Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was
visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on
the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sun sets and
maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn’t maybe he will come up
with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the
sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook
in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth
shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him
only once to know what I have against me. The fish never changed his
course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell
from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old
man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During
the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in
the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so
that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under
the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line
and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was
almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less
intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable. I can do
nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long
as he keeps this up. Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the
skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed
like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his
shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was
not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the
eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the
eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s course held true I must see it
for many more hours. I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand
leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a
radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing.
You must do nothing stupid. Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy.
To help me and to see this.”</p>
<p>No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is
unavoidable. I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order
to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you
must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself. During the
night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling
and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the
male made and the sighing blow of the female.</p>
<p>“They are good,” he said. “They play and make jokes and love one
another. They are our brothers like the flying fish.”</p>
<p>Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is
wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never
have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he
is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But
perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is
how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man
against him, nor that it is an old man. But what a great fish he is and
what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good. He took the bait
like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I
wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am? He
remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin. The male fish
always let the female fish feed first and the hooked fish, the female,
made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon exhausted her,
and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing the line and
circling with her on the surface. He had stayed so close that the old
man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which was sharp as a
scythe and almost of that size and shape. When the old man had gaffed
her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and
dubbing her across the top of her head until her colour turned to a
colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then, with the boy’s aid,
hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat.
Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the
harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside the boat to see
where the female was and then went down deep, his lavender wings, that
were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes
showing. He was beautiful, the old man remembered, and he had stayed.
That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought.
The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her
promptly.</p>
<p>“I wish the boy was here,” he said aloud and settled himself against
the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish
through the line he held across his shoulders moving steadily toward
whatever he had chosen. When once, through my treachery, it had been
necessary to him to make a choice, the old man thought. His choice had
been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps
and treacheries. My choice was to go there to find him beyond all
people. Beyond all people in the world. Now we are joined together and
have been since noon. And no one to help either one of us. Perhaps I
should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing
that I was born for. I must surely remember to eat the tuna after it
gets light.</p>
<p>Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were
behind him. He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out over
the gunwale of the skiff. In the darkness he loosened his sheath knife
and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned
back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale. Then he cut the
other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends of the
reserve coils fast. He worked skillfully with the one hand and put his
foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight. Now he had
six reserve coils of line. There were two from each bait he had severed
and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all
connected. After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the
forty-fathom bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils. I
will have lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan cardel and the hooks
and leaders. That can be replaced. But who replaces this fish if I hook
some fish and it cuts him off? I don’t know what that fish was that took
the bait just now. It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or a
shark. I never felt him. I had to get rid of him too fast. Aloud he
said, “I wish I had the boy.”</p>
<p>But you haven’t got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and
you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the
dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils. So he did it.
It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled
him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down
his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached
his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the
wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came
across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his
shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his
hand the progress of the skiff through the water. I wonder what he made
that lurch for, he thought. The wire must have slipped on the great hill
of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But
he cannot pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now
everything is cleared away that might make trouble and I have a big
reserve of line; all that a man can ask.</p>
