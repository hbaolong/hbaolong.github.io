<h4 id="day">13 Day</h4>
<p>“Come on, galano,” the old man said. “Come in again.”</p>
<p>The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.
He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This
time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in
the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid
down from the fish. The old man watched for him to come again but
neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the surface swimming in
circles. He did not see the fin of the other. I could not expect to kill
them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt them both
badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat
with two hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he
thought. He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him
had been destroyed. The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight
with the sharks.</p>
<p>“It will be dark soon,” he said. “Then I should see the glow of
Havana.. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of
the new beaches.”</p>
<p>I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too
worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he
would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many
others too, he thought. I live in a good town. He could not talk to the
fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly. Then something
came into his head.</p>
<p>“Half fish,” he said. “Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too
far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I,
and ruined many others. How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not
have that spear on your head for nothing.”</p>
<p>He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he
were swimming free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them
with, he thought. But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon.
Then we might have fought them together. What will you do now if they
come in the night? What can you do?</p>
<p>“Fight them,” he said. “I’ll fight them until I die.”</p>
<p>But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the
wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already
dead. He put his two hands together and felt the palms. They were not
dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing
them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead. His
shoulders told him. I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the
fish, he thought. But I am too tired to say them now. I better get the
sack and put it over my shoulders. He lay in the stern and steered and
watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have half of him, he thought.
Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have
some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far
outside.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly,” he said aloud. “And keep awake and steer. You may
have much luck yet.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to buy some if there’s any place they sell it,” he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost
harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?</p>
<p>“You might,” he said. “You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at
sea. They nearly sold it to you too.”</p>
<p>I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in
many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any
form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the
lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish
for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain
he knew he was not dead. He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the
city at what must have been around ten o’clock at night. They were only
perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises.
Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with
the increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that
now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream. Now it is over, he
thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against
them in the dark without a weapon? He was stiff and sore now and his
wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of
the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so
much I do not have to fight again.</p>
<p>But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was
useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the
water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw
themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and
the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately
at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club
and it was gone. He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and
chopped with it, holding it in both hands and driving it down again and
again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the
other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing
below the sea as they turned to come once more. One came, finally,
against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the
tiller across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the
heaviness of the fish’s head which would not tear. He swung it once and
twice and again. He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark
with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he
drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the last
shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat. The
old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his
mouth. It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment.
But there was not much of it. He spat into the ocean and said, “Eat
that, galanos. And make a dream you’ve killed a man.”</p>
<p>He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back
to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the
slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He settled the sack
around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly
now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past
everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port as well and
as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as
someone might pick up crumbs from the table. The old man paid no
attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except
steering. He only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff sailed now
there was no great weight beside her.</p>
<p>She’s good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except
for the tiller. That is easily replaced. He could feel he was inside the
current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the
shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home. The wind
is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes. And the
great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is
my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy
when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what
beat you, he thought.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he said aloud. “I went out too far.”</p>
<p>When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were
out and he knew everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and
was blowing strongly now. It was quiet in the harbour though and he
sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks. There was no
one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he
stepped out and made her fast to a rock.</p>
<p>He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he
shouldered the mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth
of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the
reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up
well behind the skiff’s stern. He saw the white naked line of his
backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all
the nakedness between. He started to climb again and at the top he fell
and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder. He tried to get
up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his
shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going
about its business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the
road. Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up
and put it on his shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down
five times before he reached his shack. Inside the shack he leaned the
mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and took a
drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket over his
shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the
newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up. He
was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was
blowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the
boy had slept late and then come to the old man’s shack as he had come
each morning. The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw
the old man’s hands and he started to cry. He went out very quietly to
go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying.
Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside
it and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the
skeleton with a length of line. The boy did not go down. He had been
there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for
him.</p>
