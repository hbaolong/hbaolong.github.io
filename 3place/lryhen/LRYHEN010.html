<h4 id="nineth-day">Nineth Day</h4>
<p>“He is tiring or he is resting,” the old man said. “Now let me get
through the eating of this dolphin and get some rest and a little
sleep.”</p>
<p>Under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of
one of the dolphin fillets and one of the flying fish, gutted and with
its head cut off.</p>
<p>“What an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked,” he said. “And what
a miserable fish raw. I will never go in a boat again without salt or
limes.”</p>
<p>If I had brains I would have splashed water on the bow all day and
drying, it would have made salt, he thought. But then I did not hook the
dolphin until almost sunset. Still it was a lack of preparation. But I
have chewed it all well and I am not nauseated. The sky was clouding
over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone. It
looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and
the wind had dropped.</p>
<p>“There will be bad weather in three or four days,” he said. “But not
tonight and not tomorrow. Rig now to get some sleep, old man, while the
fish is calm and steady.”</p>
<p>He held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh
against his right hand as he leaned all his weight against the wood of
the bow. Then he passed the line a little lower on his shoulders and
braced his left hand on it. My right hand can hold it as long as it is
braced, he thought If it relaxes in sleep my left hand will wake me as
the line goes out. It is hard on the right hand. But he is used to
punishment Even if I sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good.
He lay forward cramping himself against the line with all of his body,
putting all his weight onto his right band, and he was asleep. He did
not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that
stretched for eight or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating
and they would leap high into the air and return into the same hole they
had made in the water when they leaped. Then he dreamed that he was in
the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very cold and
his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a
pillow. After that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw
the first of the lions come down onto it in the early dark and then the
other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of the bows where
the ship lay anchored with the evening off-shore breeze and he waited to
see if there would be more lions and he was happy. The moon had been up
for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and the
boat moved into the tunnel of clouds. He woke with the jerk of his right
fist coming up against his face and the line burning out through his
right hand. He had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he
could with his right and the line rushed out. Finally his left hand
found the line and he leaned back against the line and now it burned his
back and his left hand, and his left hand was taking all the strain and
cutting badly. He looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding
smoothly. Just then the fish jumped making a great bursting of the ocean
and then a heavy fall. Then he jumped again and again and the boat was
going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was
raising the strain to breaking point and raising it to breaking point
again and again. He had been pulled down tight onto the bow and his face
was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move. This is what we
waited for, he thought. So now let us take it. Make him pay for the
line, he thought. Make him pay for it. He could not see the fish’s jumps
but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy splash as he
fell. The speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had
always known this would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across
the calloused parts and not let the line slip into the palm nor cut the
fingers. If the boy was here he would wet the coils of line, he thought.
Yes. If the boy were here. If the boy were here. The line went out and
out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each
inch of it. Now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of
fish that his cheek had crushed. Then he was on his knees and then he
rose slowly to his feet. He was ceding line but more slowly all he time.
He worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line
that he could not see. There was plenty of line still and now the fish
had to pull the friction of all that new line through the water. Yes, he
thought. And now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the
sacks along his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where I
cannot bring him up. He will start circling soon and then I must work on
him. I wonder what started him so suddenly? Could it have been hunger
that made him desperate, or was he frightened by something in the night?
Maybe he suddenly felt fear. But he was such a calm, strong fish and he
seemed so fearless and so confident. It is strange.</p>
<p>“You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,” he said.
“You’re holding him again but you cannot get line. But soon he has to
circle.”</p>
<p>The old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and
stooped down and scooped up water in his right hand to get the crushed
dolphin flesh off of his face. He was afraid that it might nauseate him
and he would vomit and lose his strength. When his face was cleaned he
washed his right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in
the salt water while he watched the first light come before the sunrise.
He’s headed almost east, he thought. That means he is tired and going
with the current. Soon he will have to circle. Then our true work
begins. After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long
enough he took it out and looked at it.</p>
<p>“It is not bad,” he said. “And pain does not matter to a man.”</p>
<p>He took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of
the fresh line cuts and shifted his weight so that he could put his left
hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff.</p>
<p>“You did not do so badly for something worthless,” he said to his
left hand. “But there was a moment when I could not find you.”</p>
<p>Why was I not born with two good hands? he thought. Perhaps it was my
fault in not training that one properly. But God knows he has had enough
chances to learn. He did not do so badly in the night, though, and he
has only cramped once. If he cramps again let the line cut him off. When
he thought that he knew that he was not being clear-headed and he
thought he should chew some more of the dolphin. But I can’t, he told
himself. It is better to be light-headed than to lose your strength from
nausea. And I know I cannot keep it if I eat it since my face was in it.
I will keep it for an emergency until it goes bad. But it is too late to
try for strength now through nourishment. You’re stupid, he told
himself. Eat the other flying fish. It was there, cleaned and ready, and
he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the bones
carefully and eating all of it down to the tail. It has more nourishment
than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I
need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle
and let the fight come. The sun was rising for the third time since he
had put to sea when the fish started to circle. He could not see by the
slant of the line that the fish was circling. It was too early for that.
He just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he
commenced to pull on it gently with his right hand. It tightened, as
always, but just when he reached the point where it would break, line
began to come in. He slipped his shoulders and head from under the line
and began to pull in line steadily and gently. He used both of his hands
in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as much as he could
with his body and his legs. His old legs and shoulders pivoted with the
swinging of the pulling.</p>
<p>“It is a very big circle,” he said. “But he is circling.” Then the
line would not come in any more and he held it until he saw the drops
jumping from it in the sun. Then it started out and the old man knelt
down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water.</p>
<p>“He is making the far part of his circle now,” he said. I must hold
all I can, he thought. The strain will shorten his circle each time.
Perhaps in an hour I will see him. Now I must convince him and then I
must kill him. But the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was
wet with sweat and tired deep into his bones two hours later. But the
circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he could
tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam. For an hour the old man
had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his
eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead. He was not
afraid of the black spots. They were normal at the tension that he was
pulling on the line. Twice, though, he had felt faint and dizzy and that
had worried him.</p>
<p>“I could not fail myself and die on a fish like this,” he said. “Now
that I have him coming so beautifully, God help me endure. I’ll say a
hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys. But I cannot say them now.
Consider them said, he thought. I’ll say them later. Just then he felt a
sudden banging and jerking on the line he held with his two hands. It
was sharp and hard-feeling and heavy. He is hitting the wire leader with
his spear, he thought. That was bound to come. He had to do that. It may
make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling now. The
jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can
widen the opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.</p>
<p>“Don’t jump, fish,” he said. “Don’t jump.”</p>
