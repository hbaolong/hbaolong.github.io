<h1 id="the-old-man-and-the-sea">The Old Man and the Sea</h1>
<h4 id="first-day">First Day</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>He hasn’t much faith.</p></li>
<li><p>The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had
butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two
planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish
house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to
you?</p></li>
<li><p>No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the
sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he
was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought
that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a
boat.</p></li>
<li><p>nce there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall
but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it
was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.</p></li>
<li><p>Have faith in the Yankees my son.</p></li>
<li><p>One sheet. That’s two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that
from?</p></li>
<li><p>I can always borrow two dollars and a half.</p></li>
<li><p>“The month when the great fish come,” the old man said. “Anyone
can be a fisherman in May.”</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="second-day">Second Day</h4>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held
it there in the evening breeze.</p></li>
<li><p>“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish
without eating while I’m alive.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank
him.”</p></li>
<li><p>I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is
very thoughtful for us.</p></li>
<li><p>Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was
two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy
thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get
him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and
another blanket.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then
I asked you to ask him and you were too timid.</p></li>
<li><p>They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we
are and would understand.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is
only you.</p></li>
<li><p>I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us
wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>I may not be as strong as I think</p></li>
<li><p>I know many tricks and I have resolution.</p></li>
<li><p>You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the
morning.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re my alarm clock</p></li>
<li><p>Age is my alarm clock</p></li>
<li><p>He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great
occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength,
nor of his wife.</p></li>
<li><p>He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders
and said, “I am sorry.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”</p></li>
<li><p>“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when
you were five years old.”</p></li>
<li><p>We have credit here.</p></li>
