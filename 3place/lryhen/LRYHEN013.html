<h4 id="day">12 day</h4>
<p>“You think too much, old man,” he said aloud. But you enjoyed killing
the dentuso, he thought. He lives on the live fish as you do. He is not
a scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is
beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything.</p>
<p>“I killed him in self-defense,” the old man said aloud. “And I killed
him well.”</p>
<p>Besides, he thought, everything kills everything else in some way.
Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive,
he thought. I must not deceive myself too much. He leaned over the side
and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut
him. He chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste. It was firm
and juicy, like meat, but it was not red. There was no stringiness in it
and he knew that it would bring the highest price In the market. But
there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew
that a very had time was coming. The breeze was steady. It had backed a
little further into the north-east and he knew that meant that it would
not fall off. The old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails
nor could he see the hull nor the smoke of any ship. There were only the
flying fish that went up from his bow sailing away to either side and
the yellow patches of Gulf weed. He could not even see a bird.</p>
<p>He had sailed for two hours, resting in the stern and sometimes
chewing a bit of the meat from the marlin, trying to rest and to be
strong, when he saw the first of the two sharks.</p>
<p>“Ay,” he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and
perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily,
feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.</p>
<p>“Galanos,” he said aloud. He had seen the second fin now coming up
behind the first and had identified them as shovel-nosed sharks by the
brown, triangular fin and the sweeping movements of the tail. They had
the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger
they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they
were closing all the time. The old man made the sheet fast and jammed
the tiller. Then he took up the oar with the knife lashed to it. He
lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain.
Then he opened and closed them on it lightly to loosen them. He closed
them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and
watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened,
shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins. They
were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and
when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat.
It was these sharks that would cut the turtles’ legs and flippers off
when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in
the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish
blood nor of fish slime on him.</p>
<p>“Ay,” the old man said. “Galanos. Come on galanos.”</p>
<p>They came. But they did not come as the Mako had come. One turned and
went out of sight under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff
shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish. The other watched the old man
with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle
of jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten. The line
showed clearly on the top of his brown head and back where the brain
joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the oar into
the juncture, withdrew it, and drove it in again into the shark’s yellow
cat-like eyes. The shark let go of the fish and slid down, swallowing
what he had taken as he died. The skiff was still shaking with the
destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old man let go
the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark
out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and
punched at him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely
got the knife in. The blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too.
But the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him
squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came out of
water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and
punched the shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the
fish with his jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye.
The shark still hung there.</p>
<p>“No?” the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae
and the brain. It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever.
The old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark’s jaws
to open them. He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said,
“Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe
it’s your mother.”</p>
<p>The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then
he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her
course.</p>
<p>“They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat,” he said
aloud. “I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I’m
sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong.” He stopped and he did
not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked
the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still
showed.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have gone out so far, fish,” he said. “Neither for you
nor for me. I’m sorry, fish.”</p>
<p>Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if
it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more
to come.</p>
<p>“I wish I had a stone for the knife,” the old man said after he had
checked the lashing on the oar butt. “I should have brought a stone.”
You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring
them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of
what you can do with what there is.</p>
<p>“You give me much good counsel,” he said aloud. “I’m tired of
it.”</p>
<p>He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the
water as the skiff drove forward.</p>
<p>“God knows how much that last one took,” he said.</p>
<p>“But she’s much lighter now.” He did not want to think of the
mutilated under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps
of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail
for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea. He was a fish to
keep a man all winter, he thought Don’t think of that. Just rest and try
to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood
smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water.
Besides they do not bleed much. There is nothing cut that means
anything. The bleeding may keep the left from cramping. What can I think
of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for the
next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows?
It might have turned out well. The next shark that came was a single
shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so
wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the
fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain. But the
shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped. The old
man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark
sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then
tiny. That always fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it
now.</p>
<p>“I have the gaff now,” he said. “But it will do no good. I have the
two oars and the tiller and the short club.”</p>
<p>Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to
death. But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club
and the tiller. He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was
getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the
sky. There was more wind in the sky than there had been, and soon he
hoped that he would see land.</p>
<p>“You’re tired, old man,” he said. “You’re tired inside.”</p>
<p>The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset. The old
man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in
the water. They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed
straight for the skiff swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made
the sheet fast and reached under the stem for the club. It was an oar
handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in
length. He could only use it effectively with one hand because of the
grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand,
flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were both
galanos. I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the
point of the nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought.
The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open
his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the
club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the
shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down.
But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more
hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish. The
other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws
wide. The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling
white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his
jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him
and wrenched the meat loose. The old man swung the club down on him
again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
rubberiness.</p>
