<h4 id="tenth-day">Tenth day</h4>
<p>The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his
head the old man gave up a little line. I must hold his pain where it
is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control mine. But his pain
could drive him mad. After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire
and started circling slowly again. The old man was gaining line steadily
now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea water with his left
hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back of
his neck.</p>
<p>“I have no cramps,” he said. “He’ll be up soon and I can last. You
have to last. Don’t even speak of it.”</p>
<p>He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over
his back again. I’ll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then
stand up and work on him when he comes in, he decided.</p>
<p>It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make
one circle by himself without recovering any line. But when the strain
showed the fish had turned to come toward the boat, the old man rose to
his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought
in all the line he gained. I’m tireder than I have ever been, he
thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But that will be good to take
him in with. I need that badly.</p>
<p>“I’ll rest on the next turn as he goes out,” he said. “I feel much
better. Then in two or three turns more I will have him.”</p>
<p>His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into
the bow with the pull of the line as he felt the fish turn. You work
now, fish, he thought. I’ll take you at the turn. The sea had risen
considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to
get home.</p>
<p>“I’ll just steer south and west,” he said. “A man is never lost at
sea and it is a long island.”</p>
<p>It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first. He saw him first
as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could
not believe its length.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “He can’t be that big.”</p>
<p>But he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the
surface only thirty yards away and the man saw his tail out of water. It
was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender above the
dark blue water. It raked back and as the fish swam just below the
surface the old man could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that
banded him. His dorsal fin was down and his huge pectorals were spread
wide. On this circle the old man could see the fish’s eye and the two
gray sucking fish that swain around him. Sometimes they attached
themselves to him. Sometimes they darted off. Sometimes they would swim
easily in his shadow. They were each over three feet long and when they
swam fast they lashed their whole bodies like eels. The old man was
sweating now but from something else besides the sun. On each calm
placid turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in
two turns more he would have a chance to get the harpoon in.</p>
<p>But I must get him close, close, close, he thought. I mustn’t try for
the head. I must get the heart.</p>
<p>“Be calm and strong, old man,” he said. On the next circle the fish’s
beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat. On the next
circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the
old man was sure that by gaining some more line he could have him
alongside. He had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light
rope was in a round basket and the end was made fast to the bitt in the
bow. The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking
and only his great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he
could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish turned a little on
his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.</p>
<p>“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”</p>
<p>He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain
that he could. I moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him
over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last
for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.</p>
<p>But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the
fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled
part way over and then righted himself and swam away.</p>
<p>“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway.
Do you have to kill me too?”</p>
<p>That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry
to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him
alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes
you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever. On the next turn, he
nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.
You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to.
Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more
noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who
kills who. Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You
must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer
like a man. Or a fish, he thought.</p>
<p>“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear
up.”</p>
<p>Twice more it was the same on the turns. I do not know, the old man
thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do
not know. But I will try it once more. He tried it once more and he felt
himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam
off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air. I’ll try it
again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he
could only see well in flashes. He tried it again and it was the same.
So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try
it once again. He took all his pain and what was left of his strength
and his long gone pride and he put it against the fish’s agony and the
fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side, his bill
almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat,
long, deep, wide, silver and barred with purple and interminable in the
water. The old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted
the harpoon as high as he could and drove it down with all his strength,
and more strength he had just summoned, into the fish’s side just behind
the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the
man’s chest. He felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it
further and then pushed all his weight after it. Then the fish came
alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all
his great length and width and all his power and his beauty. He seemed
to hang in the air above the old man in the skiff. Then he fell into the
water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over all of the
skiff. The old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well. But he
cleared the harpoon line and let it run slowly through his raw hands
and, when he could see, he saw the fish was on his back with his silver
belly up. The shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the
fish’s shoulder and the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood
from his heart. First it was dark as a shoal in the blue water that was
more than a mile deep. Then it spread like a cloud. The fish was silvery
and still and floated with the waves. The old man looked carefully in
the glimpse of vision that he had. Then he took two turns of the harpoon
line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands.</p>
<p>“Keep my head dear,” he said against the wood of the bow. “I am a
tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I
must do the slave work.”</p>
<p>Now I must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside, he
thought. Even if we were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her
out, this skiff would never hold him. I must prepare everything, then
bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home.
He started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could
pass a line through his gills and out his mouth and make his head fast
alongside the bow. I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to
feel him. He is my fortune, he thought. But that is not why I wish to
feel him. I think I felt his heart, he thought. When I pushed on the
harpoon shaft the second time. Bring him in now and make him fast and
get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him
to the skiff.</p>
<p>“Get to work, old man,” he said. He took a very small drink of the
water. “There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is
over.”</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky and then out to his fish. He looked at the
sun carefully. It is not much more than noon, he thought. And the trade
wind is rising. The lines all mean nothing now. The boy and I will
splice them when we are home.</p>
<p>“Come on, fish,” he said. But the fish did not come. Instead he lay
there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon to
him. When he was even with him and had the fish’s head against the bow
he could not believe his size. But he untied the harpoon rope from the
bitt, passed it through the fish’s gills and out his jaws, made a turn
around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill, made
another turn around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it
fast to the bitt in the bow. He cut the rope then and went astern to
noose the tail. The fish had turned silver from his original purple and
silver, and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail.
They were wider than a man’s hand with his fingers spread and the fish’s
eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a saint in a
procession.</p>
<p>“It was the only way to kill him,” the old man said. He was feeling
better since the water and he knew he would not go away and his head was
clear. He’s over fifteen hundred pounds the way he is, he thought. Maybe
much more. If he dresses out two-thirds of that at thirty cents a
pound?</p>
