<h4 id="seventh-day">Seventh Day</h4>
<p>“Light brisa,” he said. “Better weather for me than for you,
fish.”</p>
<p>His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly. I
hate a cramp, he thought. It is a treachery of one’s own body. It is
humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or
to vomit from it. But a cramp, he thought of it as a calambre,
humiliates oneself especially when one is alone. If the boy were here he
could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm, he thought. But
it will loosen up. Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in
the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water. Then,
as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast
against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.</p>
<p>“He’s coming up,” he said. “Come on hand. Please come on.”</p>
<p>The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean
bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly
and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the sun and his head
and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed
wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and
tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and
then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great
scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race
out.</p>
<p>“He is two feet longer than the skiff,” the old man said. The line
was going out fast but steadily and the fish was not panicked. The old
man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside of breaking
strength. He knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady
pressure the fish could take out all the line and break it. He is a
great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him
learn his strength nor what he could do if he made his run. If I were
him I would put in everything now and go until something broke. But,
thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although
they are more noble and more able. The old man had seen many great fish.
He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had
caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out
of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen
and bigger than he had ever heard of, and his left hand was still as
tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.</p>
<p>It will uncramp though, he thought. Surely it will uncramp to help my
right hand. There are three things that are brothers: the fish and my
two hands. It must uncramp. It is unworthy of it to be cramped. The fish
had slowed again and was going at his usual pace. I wonder why he
jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how
big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what
sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think
I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he
thought, with everything he has against only my will and my
intelligence. He settled comfortably against the wood and took his
suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved
slowly through the dark water. There was a small sea rising with the
wind coming up from the east and at noon the old man’s left hand was
uncramped.</p>
<p>“Bad news for you, fish,” he said and shifted the line over the sacks
that covered his shoulders. He was comfortable but suffering, although
he did not admit the suffering at all.</p>
<p>“I am not religious,” he said. “But I will say ten Our Fathers and
ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a
pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him. That is a
promise.”</p>
<p>He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be
so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say
them fast so that they would come automatically. Hail Marys are easier
to say than Our Fathers, he thought.</p>
<p>“Hail Mary full of Grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.” Then he added, “Blessed Virgin, pray for the death of this fish.
Wonderful though he is.”</p>
<p>With his prayers said, and feeling much better, but suffering exactly
as much, and perhaps a little more, he leaned against the wood of the
bow and began, mechanically, to work the fingers of his left hand. The
sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently.</p>
<p>“I had better re-bait that little line out over the stern,” he said.
“If the fish decides to stay another night I will need to eat again and
the water is low in the bottle. I don’t think I can get anything but a
dolphin here. But if I eat him fresh enough he won’t be bad. I wish a
flying fish would come on board tonight. But I have no light to attract
them. A flying fish is excellent to eat raw and I would not have to cut
him up. I must save all my strength now. Christ, I did not know he was
so big.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kill him though,” he said. “In all his greatness and his
glory.”</p>
<p>Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can
do and what a man endures.</p>
<p>“I told the boy I was a strange old man,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now is when I must prove it.”</p>
<p>The thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing. Now he was
proving it again. Each time was a new time and he never thought about
the past when he was doing it. I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and
dream about the lions, he thought. Why are the lions the main thing that
is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently now
against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as
you can. It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved
slowly and steadily. But there was an added drag now from the easterly
breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the hurt of
the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly. Once in the
afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to
swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm
and shoulder and on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of
north. Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming
in the water with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the
great erect tail slicing through the dark. I wonder how much he sees at
that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and a horse, with much
less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees. The sun and his
steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now
completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he
shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the hurt of the cord a
little.</p>
<p>“If you’re not tired, fish,” he said aloud, “you must be very
strange.”</p>
<p>He felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he
tried to think of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him
they were the Gran Ligas, and he knew that the Yankees of New York were
playing the Tigres of Detroit. This is the second day now that I do not
know the result of the juegos, he thought. But I must have confidence
and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all things perfectly
even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he
asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as
painful as the spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I
could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue
to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much beside the great
birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the
darkness of the sea.</p>
<p>“Unless sharks come,” he said aloud. “If sharks come, God pity him
and me.”</p>
<p>Do you believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I
will stay with this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since
he is young and strong. Also his father was a fisherman. But would the
bone spur hurt him too much?</p>
<p>“I do not know,” he said aloud. “I never had a bone spur.”</p>
<p>As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more confidence, the
time in the tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with
the great negro from Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks.
They had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line on
the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight.
Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the table. There
was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the
kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and
at the negro’s face. They changed the referees every four hours after
the first eight so that the referees could sleep. Blood came out from
under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands and they looked
each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors
went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and
watched. The walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the
lamps threw their shadows against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and
it moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps. The odds would
change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted
cigarettes for him. Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a
tremendous effort and once he had the old man, who was not an old man
then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly three inches off balance. But
the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He was sure then
that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten.
And at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw
and the referee was shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and
forced the hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood.
The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended on a Monday morning.
Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go to work
on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company.
Otherwise everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had
finished it anyway and before anyone had to go to work. For a long time
after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had been a
return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it
quite easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from
Cienfuegos in the first match. After that he had a few matches and then
no more. He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly
enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing. He
had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand
had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do
and he did not trust it. The sun will bake it out well now, he thought.
It should not cramp on me again unless it gets too cold in the night. I
wonder what this night will bring. An airplane passed overhead on its
course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of
flying fish.</p>
