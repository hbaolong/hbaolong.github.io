<h4 id="forth-day">Forth Day</h4>
<p>From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the
water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing
filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble
made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and
when same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy
and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and
sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak
can give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and
struck like a whiplash. The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they
were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big
sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the
front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate
them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them
and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them
pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet. He loved
green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their
great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid
loggerheads, yellow in their armour-plating, strange in their
love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their
eyes shut. He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in
turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great
trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most
people are heartless about turtles because a turtle’s heart will beat
for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man
thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs.
He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through
May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish. He
also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the
shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all
fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste. But it was no
worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good
against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes. Now the old
man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.</p>
<p>“He’s found fish,” he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface
and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a
small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the
water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back
into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all
directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait.
They were circling it and driving it. If they don’t travel too fast I
will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school
working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the
bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic.</p>
<p>“The bird is a great help,” the old man said. Just then the stern
line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and
he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tuna’s shivering
pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. The shivering
increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in
the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side
and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet
shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out
against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his
neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and
kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.</p>
<p>“Albacore,” he said aloud. “He’ll make a beautiful bait. He’ll weigh
ten pounds.”</p>
<p>He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he
was by himself. He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and
he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch
in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk
aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When
he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad
weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and
the old man had always considered it so and respected it. But now he
said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they
could annoy.</p>
<p>“If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am
crazy,” he said aloud. “But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the
rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the
baseball.”</p>
<p>Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to
think of only one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big
one around that school, he thought. I picked up only a straggler from
the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast.
Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the
north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather
that I do not know? He could not see the green of the shore now but only
the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were
snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above
them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The
myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it
was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw
now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile
deep. The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna
and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came
to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again. The sun was
hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the
sweat trickle down his back as he rowed. I could just drift, he thought,
and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But today is
eighty-five days and I should fish the day well. Just then, watching his
lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “Yes,” and shipped his oars without bumping the boat.
He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and
forefinger of his right hand. He felt no strain nor weight and he held
the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull,
not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and
the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head
of the small tuna. The old man held the line delicately, and softly,
with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick. Now he could let it run
through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension. This far out,
he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them.
Please eat them.</p>
<p>How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold
water in the dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat
them. He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a
sardine’s head must have been more difficult to break from the hook.
Then there was nothing.</p>
<p>“Come on,” the old man said aloud. “Make another turn. Just smell
them. Aren’t they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna.
Hard and cold and lovely. Don’t be shy, fish. Eat them.”</p>
<p>He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it
and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or
down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch again.</p>
<p>“He’ll take it,” the old man said aloud. “God help him to take
it.”</p>
<p>He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt
nothing.</p>
<p>“He can’t have gone,” he said. “Christ knows he can’t have gone. He’s
making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers
something of it.</p>
<p>Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.</p>
<p>“It was only his turn,” he said. “He’ll take it.”</p>
<p>He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something
hard and unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let
the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two
reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man’s
fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible.</p>
<p>“What a fish,” he said. “He has it sideways in his mouth now and he
is moving off with it.”</p>
<p>Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that
because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He
knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the
darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he
felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight
increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb
and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight
down.</p>
<p>“He’s taken it,” he said. “Now I’ll let him eat it well.”</p>
<p>He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with
his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the
loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he was ready. He had
three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he
was using.</p>
<p>“Eat it a little more,” he said. “Eat it well.”</p>
