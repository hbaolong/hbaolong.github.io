<h4 id="eighth-day">Eighth Day</h4>
<p>“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and
leaned back on the line to see if it was possible to gain any on his
fish. But he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water-drop
shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly and he
watched the airplane until he could no longer see it. It must be very
strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like
from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do
not fly too high. I would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms
high and see the fish from above. In the turtle boats I was in the
cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw much. The
dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their
purple spots and you can see all of the school as they swim. Why is it
that all the fast-moving fish of the dark current have purple backs and
usually purple stripes or spots? The dolphin looks green of course
because he is really golden. But when he comes to feed, truly hungry,
purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin. Can it be anger, or the
greater speed he makes that brings them out? Just before it was dark, as
they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the
light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a
yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first
when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending
and flapping wildly in the air. It jumped again and again in the
acrobatics of its fear and he worked his way back to the stern and
crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and arm, he
pulled the dolphin in with his left hand, stepping on the gained line
each time with his bare left foot. When the fish was at the stem,
plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation, the old man
leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple
spots over the stem. Its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites
against the hook and it pounded the bottom of the skiff with its long
flat body, its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining
golden head until it shivered and was still. The old man unhooked the
fish, re-baited the line with another sardine and tossed it over. Then
he worked his way slowly back to the bow. He washed his left hand and
wiped it on his trousers. Then he shifted the heavy line from his right
hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea while he watched
the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t changed at all,” he said. But watching the movement of the
water against his hand he noted that it was perceptibly slower.</p>
<p>“I’ll lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow
him in the night,” he said. “He’s good for the night and so am I.”</p>
<p>It would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the
blood in the meat, he thought. I can do that a little later and lash the
oars to make a drag at the same time. I had better keep the fish quiet
now and not disturb him too much at sunset. The setting of the sun is a
difficult time for all fish. He let his hand dry in the air then grasped
the line with it and eased himself as much as he could and allowed
himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the
strain as much, or more, than he did. I’m learning how to do it, he
thought. This part of it anyway. Then too, remember he hasn’t eaten
since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food. I have eaten
the whole bonito. Tomorrow I will eat the dolphin. He called it dorado.
Perhaps I should eat some of it when I clean it. It will be harder to
eat than the bonito. But, then, nothing is easy.</p>
<p>“How do you feel, fish?” he asked aloud. “I feel good and my left
hand is better and I have food for a night and a day. Pull the boat,
fish.”</p>
<p>He did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his
back had almost passed pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted.
But I have had worse things than that, he thought. My hand is only cut a
little and the cramp is gone from the other. My legs are all right. Also
now I have gained on him in the question of sustenance. It was dark now
as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in September. He lay
against the worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could. The first
stars were out. He did not know the name of Rigel but he saw it and knew
soon they would all be out and he would have all his distant
friends.</p>
<p>“The fish is my friend too,” he said aloud. “I have never seen or
heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to
try to kill the stars.”</p>
<p>Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The
moon runs away. But imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill
the sun? We were born lucky, he thought. Then he was sorry for the great
fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never
relaxed in his sorrow for him. How many people will he feed, he thought.
But are they worthy to eat him? No, of course not. There is no one
worthy of eating him from the manner of his behaviour and his great
dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good
that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It
is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers. Now, he
thought, I must think about the drag. It has its perils and its merits.
I may lose so much line that I will lose him, if he makes his effort and
the drag made by the oars is in place and the boat loses all her
lightness. Her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety
since he has great speed that he has never yet employed. No matter what
passes I must gut the dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him
to be strong. Now I will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and
steady before I move back to the stern to do the work and make the
decision. In the meantime I can see how he acts and if he shows any
changes. The oars are a good trick; but it has reached the time to play
for safety. He is much fish still and I saw that the hook was in the
corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut. The punishment
of the hook is nothing. The punishment of hunger, and that he is against
something that he does not comprehend, is everything. Rest now, old man,
and let him work until your next duty comes. He rested for what he
believed to be two hours. The moon did not rise now until late and he
had no way of judging the time. Nor was he really resting except
comparatively. He was still bearing the pull of the fish across his
shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow and
confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff
itself. How simple it would be if I could make the line fast, he
thought. But with one small lurch he could break it. I must cushion the
pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line
with both hands.</p>
<p>“But you have not slept yet, old man,” he said aloud. “It is half a
day and a night and now another day and you have not slept. You must
devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and steady. If
you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head.”</p>
<p>I’m clear enough in the head, he thought. Too clear. I am as clear as
the stars that are my brothers. Still I must sleep. They sleep and the
moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps sometimes on certain
days when there is no current and a flat calm. But remember to sleep, he
thought. Make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way about
the lines. Now go back and prepare the dolphin. It is too dangerous to
rig the oars as a drag if you must sleep. I could go without sleeping,
he told himself. But it would be too dangerous.</p>
<p>He started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees,
being careful not to jerk against the fish. He may be half asleep
himself, he thought. But I do not want him to rest. He must pull until
he dies. Back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the
strain of the line across his shoulders and drew his knife from its
sheath with his right hand. The stars were bright now and he saw the
dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and
drew him out from under the stern. He put one of his feet on the fish
and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower jaw. Then
he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand, scooping him
clean and pulling the gills clear. He felt the maw heavy and slippery in
his hands and he slit it open. There were two flying fish inside. They
were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts
and the gills over the stern. They sank leaving a trail of
phosphorescence in the water. The dolphin was cold and a leprous
gray-white now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him
while he held his right foot on the fish’s head. Then he turned him over
and skinned the other side and cut each side off from the head down to
the tail.</p>
<p>He slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any
swirl in the water. But there was only the light of its slow descent. He
turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the two fillets of
fish and putting his knife back in its sheath, he worked his way slowly
back to the bow. His back was bent with the weight of the line across it
and he carried the fish in his right hand. Back in the bow he laid the
two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them.
After that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and
held it again with his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he leaned
over the side and washed the flying fish in the water, noting the speed
of the water against his hand. His hand was phosphorescent from skinning
the fish and he watched the flow of the water against it. The flow was
less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking
of the skiff, particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly
astern.</p>
