<h4 id="day">11 Day</h4>
<p>“I need a pencil for that,” he said. “My head is not that clear. But
I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today. I had no bone
spurs. But the hands and the back hurt truly.” I wonder what a bone spur
is, he thought. Maybe we have them without knowing of it. He made the
fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart. He was so big it
was like lashing a much bigger skiff alongside. He cut a piece of line
and tied the fish’s lower jaw against his bill so his mouth would not
open and they would sail as cleanly as possible. Then he stepped the
mast and, with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged, the
patched sail drew, the boat began to move, and half lying in the stern
he sailed south-west. He did not need a compass to tell him where
southwest was. He only needed the feel of the trade wind and the drawing
of the sail. I better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try
and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not
find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of
yellow Gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the
small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff. There
were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand
fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger
and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny
but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good. The old man still
had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he
had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the
handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the
fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the
stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one
time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps
it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and
hang motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some
great strangeness and he could not believe it.</p>
<p>Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. Now
he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The
hands cure quickly, he thought. I bled them clean and the salt water
will heal them. The dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer
that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands have done
their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight
up and down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a
little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him
in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the
fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no
question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and
the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only
better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm. They sailed
well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to
keep his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus
above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last all night. The
old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true. It was
an hour before the first shark hit him. The shark was not an accident.
He had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood
had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so fast
and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue
water and was in the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up
the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had
taken. Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or
have just a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was
a very big Make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the
sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws. His back was
as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was
smooth and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge
jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface
with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering.
Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth
were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of
most sharks. They were shaped like a man’s fingers when they are crisped
like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and
they had razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built
to feed on all the fishes in the sea, that were so fast and strong and
well armed that they had no other enemy. Now he speeded up as he smelled
the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water. When the old
man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all
and would do exactly what he wished. He prepared the harpoon and made
the rope fast while he watched the shark come on. The rope was short as
it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish. The old man’s head was
clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little hope.
It was too good to last, he thought. He took one look at the great fish
as he watched the shark close in. It might as well have been a dream, he
thought. I cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe I can get him.
Dentuso, he thought. Bad luck to your mother. The shark closed fast
astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his
strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in
the meat just above the tail. The shark’s head was out of water and his
back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and
flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the
shark’s head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with
the line that ran straight back from his nose. There were no such lines.
There was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes and the
clicking, thrusting all-swallowing jaws. But that was the location of
the brain and the old man hit it. He hit it with his blood mushed hands
driving a good harpoon with all his strength. He hit it without hope but
with resolution and complete malignancy. The shark swung over and the
old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once again,
wrapping himself in two loops of the rope. The old man knew that he was
dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his back, with his tail
lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the water as a
speedboat does. The water was white where his tail beat it and
three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope came
taut, shivered, and then snapped. The shark lay quietly for a little
while on the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very
slowly.</p>
<p>“He took about forty pounds,” the old man said aloud. He took my
harpoon too and all the rope, he thought, and now my fish bleeds again
and there will be others. He did not like to look at the fish anymore
since he had been mutilated. When the fish had been hit it was as though
he himself were hit. But I killed the shark that hit my fish, he
thought. And he was the biggest dentuso that I have ever seen. And God
knows that I have seen big ones. It was too good to last, he thought. I
wish it had been a dream now and that I had never hooked the fish and
was alone in bed on the newspapers.</p>
<p>“But man is not made for defeat,” he said. “A man can be destroyed
but not defeated.” I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought.
Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The
dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more
intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only
better armed.</p>
<p>“Don’t think, old man,” he said aloud. “Sail on this course and take
it when it comes. But I must think, he thought. Because it is all I have
left. That and baseball. I wonder how the great DiMaggio would have
liked the way I hit him in the brain? It was no great thing, he thought.
Any man could do it. But do you think my hands were as great a handicap
as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had anything wrong with my
heel except the time the sting ray stung it when I stepped on him when
swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain.</p>
<p>“Think about something cheerful, old man,” he said. “Every minute now
you are closer to home. You sail lighter for the loss of forty
pounds.”</p>
<p>He knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached
the inner part of the current. But there was nothing to be done now.</p>
<p>“Yes there is,” he said aloud. “I can lash my knife to the butt of
one of the oars.”</p>
<p>So he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the
sail under his foot.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said. “I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed.”</p>
<p>The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the
forward part of the fish and some of his hope returned. It is silly not
to hope, he thought. Besides I believe it is a sin. Do not think about
sin, he thought. There are enough problems now without sin. Also I have
no understanding of it. I have no understanding of it and I am not sure
that I believe in it. Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose
it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But
then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late
for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think
about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a
fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since
there was nothing to read and he did not have a radio, he thought much
and he kept on thinking about sin. You did not kill the fish only to
keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride
and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you
loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it
more?</p>
