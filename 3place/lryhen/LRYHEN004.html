<h4 id="third-day">Third Day</h4>
<p>“Good luck old man.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the
oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the
blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbour in the dark.
There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the
old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not
see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak
in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the
oars. <strong>They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the
harbour and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to
find fish.</strong> The old man knew he was going far out and he left
the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning
smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the
water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called
the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms
where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current
made against the steep walls of the floor of the ocean. Here there were
concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in
the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all
the wandering fish fed on them. In the dark the old man could feel the
morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying
fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as
they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as
they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the
birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying
and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a
harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows
when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she
can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly,
dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately
for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people
call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say
bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.
Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their
lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much
money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought
of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours,
and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help
them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. He was rowing
steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional
swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work
and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he
had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did
nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out where the schools of bonito and
albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was
really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One
bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the
third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one
hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank
of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the
projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with
fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they
made a half-garland on the projecting steel. There was no part of the
hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good
tasting. The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores,
which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he
had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but
they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give
them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big
pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch
on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom
coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it
were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of
line. Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of
the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at
their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would
rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the
other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out
across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the
water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes
so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked
down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into
the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that
at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait
waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.
Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. But, he
thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But
who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be
lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to
look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they
showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my
eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look
straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful. Just then he saw a
man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of
him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and
then circled again.</p>

<p>“He’s got something,” the old man said aloud. “He’s not just
looking.”</p>
<p>He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He
did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded
the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though
faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless.
Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the
water and sail desperately over the surface.</p>
<p>“Dolphin,” the old man said aloud. “Big dolphin.”</p>
<p>He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It
had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of
the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring
bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the
shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged
black bird who was working, now, low over the water. As he watched the
bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them
wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man
could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as
they followed the escaping fish. The dolphin were cutting through the
water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at
speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought.
They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has
no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast. He
watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual
movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought.
They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a
stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be
somewhere. The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the
coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The
water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he
looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark
water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to
see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy
to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun
made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and
so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost
out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some
patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple,
formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war
floating dose beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted
itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple
filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.</p>
<p>“Agua mala,” the man said. “You whore.”</p>
