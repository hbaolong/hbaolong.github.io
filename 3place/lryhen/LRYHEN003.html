<h4 id="second-day">Second Day</h4>
<p>“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said. When the boy came back the
old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the
old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair
and over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still
powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the
creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head
fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was
like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the
sun. The old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed
there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and
the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was
barefooted. The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was
still asleep.</p>
<p>“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old
man’s knees. The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming
back from a long way away. Then he smiled.</p>
<p>“What have you got?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Supper,” said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.”</p>
<p>“I’m not very hungry.”</p>
<p>“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”</p>
<p>“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and
folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.</p>
<p>“Keep the blanket around you,” the boy said. “You’ll not fish without
eating while I’m alive.”</p>
<p>“Then live a long time and take care of yourself,” the old man said.
“What are we eating?”</p>
<p>“Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew.”</p>
<p>The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the
Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket
with a paper napkin wrapped around each set.</p>
<p>“Who gave this to you?”</p>
<p>“Martin. The owner.”</p>
<p>“I must thank him.”</p>
<p>“I thanked him already,” the boy said. “You don’t need to thank
him.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give him the belly meat of a big fish,” the old man said. “Has
he done this for us more than once?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>“I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very
thoughtful for us.”</p>
<p>“He sent two beers.”</p>
<p>“I like the beer in cans best.”</p>
<p>“I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the
bottles.”</p>
<p>“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not
wished to open the container until you were ready.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”</p>
<p>Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply was two
streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought,
and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him
another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and
another blanket.</p>
<p>“Your stew is excellent,” the old man said.</p>
<p>“Tell me about the baseball,” the boy asked him.</p>
<p>“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man
said happily.”</p>
<p>“They lost today,” the boy told him.</p>
<p>“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”</p>
<p>“They have other men on the team.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between
Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick
Sisler and those great drives In the old park.”</p>
<p>“There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have
ever seen.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I
asked you to ask him and you were too timid.”</p>
<p>“I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we
would have that for all of our lives.”</p>
<p>“I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing,” the old man said.
“They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and
would understand.”</p>
<p>“The great Sisler’s father was never poor and he, the father, was
playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.”</p>
<p>“When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship
that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the
evening.”</p>
<p>“I know. You told me.”</p>
<p>“Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?”</p>
<p>“Baseball I think,” the boy said. “Tell me about the great John J.
McGraw.” He said Jota for J.</p>
<p>“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But
he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His
mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of
horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of
horses on the telephone.”</p>
<p>“He was a great manager,” the boy said. “My father thinks he was the
greatest.”</p>
<p>“Because he came here the most times,” the old man said. “If Durocher
had continued to come here each year your father would think him the
greatest manager.”</p>
<p>“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”</p>
<p>“I think they are equal.”</p>
<p>“And the best fisherman is you.”</p>
<p>“No. I know others better.”</p>
<p>“Que Va,” the boy said. “There are many good fishermen and some great
ones. But there is only you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so
great that he will prove us wrong.”</p>
<p>“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”</p>
<p>“I may not be as strong as I think,” the old man said. “But I know
many tricks and I have resolution.”</p>
<p>“You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning.
I will take the things back to the Terrace.”</p>
<p>“Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”</p>
<p>“You’re my alarm clock,” the boy said.</p>
<p>“Age is my alarm clock,” the old man said. “Why do old men wake so
early? Is it to have one longer day?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep
late and hard.”</p>
<p>“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.”</p>
<p>“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were
inferior.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Sleep well old man.”</p>
<p>The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the
old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his
trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He
rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that
covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he
dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the
white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the
great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in
his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding
through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he
smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and
wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early
and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see
the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed
of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands. He no
longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of
great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He
only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played
like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He
never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at
the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside
the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering
with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that
soon he would be rowing. The door of the house where the boy lived was
unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The
boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him
clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of
one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at
him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by
the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on. The old man went out
the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put
his arm across his shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”</p>
<p>“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must do.”</p>
<p>They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the
road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their
boats. When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of
line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the
mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Do you want coffee?” the boy asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll put the gear in the boat and then get some.”</p>
<p>They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place
that served fishermen.</p>
<p>“How did you sleep old man?” the boy asked. He was waking up now
although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.</p>
<p>“Very well, Manolin,” the old man said. “I feel confident today.”</p>
<p>“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and
your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to
carry anything.”</p>
<p>“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things when you
were five years old.”</p>
<p>“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee.
We have credit here.”</p>
<p>He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where
the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all
he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long
time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for
the day. The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits
wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff,
feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid
her into the water.</p>
