<h4 id="second-day">Second Day</h4>
<p>“I go now for the sardines,” the boy said. When the boy came back the
old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the
old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair
and over the old man’s shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still
powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the
creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head
fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was
like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the
sun. The old man’s head was very old though and with his eyes closed
there was no life in his face. <strong>The newspaper lay across his
knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening
breeze.</strong> He was barefooted. The boy left him there and when he
came back the old man was still asleep.</p>

<p>“Wake up old man,” the boy said and put his hand on one of the old
man’s knees. The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming
back from a long way away. Then he smiled.</p>
<p>“What have you got?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Supper,” said the boy. “We’re going to have supper.”</p>
<p>“I’m not very hungry.”</p>
<p>“Come on and eat. You can’t fish and not eat.”</p>
<p>“I have,” the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and

bottles.”</p>
<p>“That’s very kind of you,” the old man said. “Should we eat?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been asking you to,” the boy told him gently. “I have not
wished to open the container until you were ready.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready now,” the old man said. “I only needed time to wash.”</p>
<p><strong>Where did you wash? the boy thought. The village water supply
was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy
thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get

another blanket.</strong></p>

<p>“In the American League it is the Yankees as I said,” the old man
said happily.”</p>
<p>“They lost today,” the boy told him.</p>
<p>“That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again.”</p>
<p>“They have other men on the team.”</p>
<p>“Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between

“<strong>They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we
are and would understand.</strong>”</p>
<p>“The great Sisler’s father was never poor and he, the father, was
playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age.”</p>

McGraw.” He said Jota for J.</p>
<p>“He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But

greatest manager.”</p>
<p>“Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”</p>
<p>“I think they are equal.”</p>
<p>“And the best fisherman is you.”</p>
<p>“No. I know others better.”</p>
<p>“Que Va,” the boy said. “<strong>There are many good fishermen and
some great ones. But there is only you.</strong>”</p>
<p>“Thank you. You make me happy. <strong>I hope no fish will come along
so great that he will prove us wrong.</strong>”</p>
<p>“There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say.”</p>
<p>“<strong>I may not be as strong as I think</strong>,” the old man
said. “But <strong>I know many tricks and I have
resolution.</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the
morning.</strong> I will take the things back to the Terrace.”</p>
<p>“Good night then. I will wake you in the morning.”</p>
<p>“<strong>You’re my alarm clock</strong>,” the boy said.</p>
<p>“<strong>Age is my alarm clock</strong>,” the old man said. “Why do
old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the boy said. “All I know is that young boys sleep
late and hard.”</p>
<p>“I can remember it,” the old man said. “I’ll waken you in time.”</p>
<p>“I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were

<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“Sleep well old man.”</p>
<p>The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the
old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his
trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He
rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that
covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he
dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the
white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the
great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in
his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding
through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he
smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and
wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early
and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see
the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed
of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
<strong>He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great
occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength,
nor of his wife.</strong> He only dreamed of places now and of the lions
on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them
as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke,
looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put
them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake
the boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would
shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. The door of the
house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in
quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first
room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in
from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until
the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the
boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed,
pulled them on. The old man went out the door and the boy came after
him. <strong>He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his
shoulders and said, “I am sorry.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Qua Va,” the boy said. “It is what a man must
do.”</strong></p>
<p>They walked down the road to the old man’s shack and all along the
road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their
boats. When they reached the old man’s shack the boy took the rolls of
line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the
mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“So do I,” the boy said. “Now I must get your sardines and mine and
your fresh baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to
carry anything.”</p>
<p><strong>“We’re different,” the old man said. “I let you carry things
when you were five years old.”</strong></p>
<p>“I know it,” the boy said. “I’ll be right back. Have another coffee.
<strong>We have credit here.</strong>”</p>
<p>He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where
the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all
he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long
time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for
the day. The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits
wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff,
feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid
her into the water.</p>
