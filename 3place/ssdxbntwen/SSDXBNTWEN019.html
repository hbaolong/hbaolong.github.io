Building the World’s Already Biggest Software Business</h4>
<p>If we were right about the end of one computing era and the arrival
of the next, we needed answers to important questions: Where would the
value shift in that new environment? Where would the strategic high
ground be? What would dominate customers’ attention (and spending) the
way the PC had during the prior phase?</p>
<p>Certainly networking gear, to keep oceans of digital content moving
at high speed and high bandwidth, would be in high demand. To handle the
explosion in transactions, customers would need increased server and
storage capacity. To design and implement networked solutions, they
would need a range of services.</p>
<p>But the linchpin seemed to be software. I’m not referring to the
software of the prior era—desktop operating systems and productivity
applications sold in shrink-wrapped boxes. The software that would
matter in the future would have a very different set of
characteristics.</p>
<p>For starters, it would have to be based on open standards that every
competitor could use and build on. Why? Because the networked world
would have to connect hundreds of millions, eventually billions, of
devices and systems. Customers would never permit one company’s
technology to control all of those connected elements, even if the
technology were capable of it.</p>
<p>I’m not a technologist, so I’m not going to try to explain the
Internet’s underpinnings. Suffice it to say that the Internet is built
on a set of open technical specifications called protocols. Once
computer systems adhere to those specs, they can connect and become part
of the Net.</p>
<p>This was basically client/server’s utopian promise—seamless
connectivity. Of course, it didn’t work. Now, the Internet offered to
fulfill that promise, and on a global scale.</p>
<p>Diamond in the Rough</p>
<p>In 1993 very few people—even knowledgeable business executives—would
have correctly answered the following question: “What is the biggest
software company in the world?” I suspect nearly all would have answered
“Microsoft.” In fact, IBM sold more software in 1993 than did anyone
else.</p>
<p>Why the misperception? It was due mainly to the fact that IBM never
thought of itself as a software company, did not talk about itself as a
software company, did not have a software strategy, and did not even
have a unified software organization.</p>
<p>Software, to IBM, was simply one part of a hardware-based offering.
Since every computer needs an operating system, and most need databases
and transaction processing capability, IBM built many of these software
assets but never viewed them as a unique business. Rather, they were
buried inside IBM hardware or sold as an add-on feature. And critically,
none of this software worked with computers made by manufacturers other
than IBM.</p>
<p>So, problem number one: We didn’t have a software mentality, much
less a real software business. Problem number two: Most of what we had
was built for the mainframe world at a time when the bulk of the
customer investment was being made in smaller, distributed systems.
Problem number three: a troubled child named OS/2.</p>
<p>My consumer packaged goods background helps me understand the
emotional attachment companies have for their products. But the
situation is different, and far more intense, in the IT industry. I
didn’t fully understand this when I came to IBM, but I learned in a
hurry when I was thrust into our own religious war—the fight for desktop
superiority, pitting IBM’s OS/2 operating system against Microsoft’s
Windows. It was draining tens of millions of dollars, absorbing huge
chunks of senior management’s time, and making a mockery of our image.
And in the finest IBM fashion, we were going to fight to the bitter
end.</p>
<p>IBM had always designed its own operating software to run on its
hardware. However, when the PC came along, IBM’s lack of real commitment
to that market resulted in the company’s asking Microsoft to provide the
operating system for the first IBM Personal Computer. Microsoft seized
that miscalculation and artfully built the most powerful franchise in
computing.</p>
<p>The highest levels of IBM executives were almost obsessed with the
effort to unwind the decisions of the 1980s and take back control of the
operating system from Microsoft (and, to a lesser extent, gain control
of the microprocessor from Intel). From my perspective, it was an
extraordinary gamble for a company to be taking at a time when it was in
such a weak financial state.</p>
<p>The pro-OS/2 argument was based on technical superiority. I can say
without bias that many people outside IBM believed OS/2 was the better
product. The anti-Windows argument was that the legendary Microsoft hype
machine was using clever marketing and wily PR to foist an inferior
product on consumers, take greater control of the industry, and, in the
process, destroy IBM.</p>
<p>What my colleagues seemed unwilling or unable to accept was that the
war was already over and was a resounding defeat—90 percent market share
for Windows to OS/2’s 5 percent or 6 percent.</p>
<p>Not only were we banging our heads against a very hard, unrelenting
wall, but I had to wonder if anyone was paying attention to the
strategic direction we were talking about. If we truly believed that the
reign of the PC was coming to an end, why were we pouring energy,
resources, and our image into yesterday’s war? Desktop leadership might
have been nice to have, but it was no longer strategically vital.
Continuing to chase it was more than an expensive distraction, not to
mention a source of considerable tension with customers. It was counter
to our view of where the world was headed.</p>
<p>The last gasp was the introduction of a product called OS/2 Warp in
1994, but in my mind the exit strategy was a foregone conclusion. All
that remained was to figure out how to withdraw. I asked for
alternatives and was presented with three. The first two would have
involved fairly abrupt terminations of the product line. The third
involved a five- to six-year winding down that would cost us hundreds of
millions of dollars but would provide support to allow customers using
OS/2 to migrate to Windows- or UNIX-based systems in a more manageable
fashion. I think you know the decision a former customer made, and IBM
today is providing support for customers who still depend on OS/2.</p>
<p>The OS/2 decision created immense emotional distress in the company.
Thousands of IBMers of all stripes—technical, marketing, and
strategy—had been engaged in this struggle. They believed in their
product and the cause for which they were fighting. The doomsday
scenario of IBM’s losing its role in the industry because it didn’t make
PC operating systems proved to be little more than an emotional
reaction, but I still get letters from a small number of OS/2
diehards.</p>
<p>A Future After the War</p>
<p>With yesterday’s war behind us, it was easier to start planning for
what lay ahead. As I took inventory of what we had available to us
inside IBM, it was a mixed picture: a software business that was big but
fragmented and unmanaged; a software portfolio that was closed in a
world destined to be open; software built for mainframes, rather than
for smaller and more widely dispersed systems; and a business that,
aside from operating systems tied to the hardware, was losing huge sums
of money.</p>
<p>We needed far more focus. Toward the end of 1994, I decided to pull
together all of IBM’s software assets under a single executive and ask
him to build a distinct, stand-alone software business. John Thompson
had attracted my attention very early as one of the most thoughtful and
capable managers at IBM. He demonstrated a deep understanding of the
technology, had a bright and thoughtful intellect, and, perhaps most
important for me, he was able to translate arcane technology into
business terms.</p>
<p>At the time, John was running our Server Group—the heart of the
company. We were managing a critical technology transition, and he’d
been in his position for only about fourteen months, so he was shocked
when I asked him to take up the task of creating a new business from
scratch. But as he did many other times during my tenure at IBM, he
accepted the challenge and brought his many talents to bear quickly and
effectively.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to exaggerate the enormity of the problem that
John faced as 1995 began. IBM had 4,000 software products, all of which
were branded with separate names (most of which were unmemorable and
un-“rememberable”). They were made in more than thirty different
laboratories around the world. There was no management system, no model
for how a software company should run, and no skills in selling software
as a separate product.</p>
<p>Over the next two years John and his colleagues recruited and trained
5,000 software sales specialists; they became the backbone of a new
sales function in IBM that eventually reached 10,000 by the year
2000.</p>
<p>John reduced the thirty labs to eight and consolidated sixty brands
to six. He built a management team, developed strategies, and created
marketing programs. His team redirected hundreds of millions of dollars
of research expenditures and, in particular, shifted substantial sums of
money into the new marketing and sales functions. IBM salespeople loved
to sell hardware, and why not? That was how they made their quotas and
their money. They had little appetite or skill to go up against Oracle
or Computer Associates salespeople who were trained exclusively to sell
software.</p>
<p>What remained was to find a sense of direction, a focus, a leadership
position that would send a message that IBM was serious about software.
John thought he had the answer.</p>
<p>To set up the software bet we were about to make, think about
software doing its work on three levels:</p>
<p>At the base, there are the operating systems that tell the hardware
what to do.</p>
<p>At the top, there is all the application software, like a
spreadsheet, a program for calculating your income tax, or a graphic
design program. This is what an end user sees on the screen.</p>
<p>In between, there is a collection of software products that connect
the two.</p>
<p>At the base: Microsoft owned the dominant operating system, which,
regardless of the fate of OS/2, we believed would become increasingly
commoditized in a world of open standards.</p>
<p>At the top: Companies like SAP, PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards dominated
the applications software market, while we were an unimportant
player.</p>
<p>In the space between: products like databases, systems management
software, and transaction management programs. It was the complex,
largely invisible layer (aptly named “middleware”) about which only the
most hardcore techies could get excited.</p>
<p>Yet the more we considered what was going to matter if client/server
computing gave way to networked computing, middleware started to look
less like a backwater and more like the key strategic battleground. We
couldn’t see the entire picture at the time, but we could see enough.
More users. More devices. More transactions. And more demand for ways to
integrate applications, processes, systems, users, and institutions. No
operating system was going to be able to tie it all together. But
middleware existed to do exactly that.</p>
<p>To provide this kind of integration, however, middleware was going to
have to work on all of the major vendors’ computer systems that would be
linked together over vast new networks. In the industry’s jargon, the
new middleware would have to work “cross platform,” and this represented
a major obstacle that we would have to overcome. Up until this point in
1995, all of IBM’s software was proprietary and worked only with IBM
hardware and other IBM software.</p>
<p>Thus, we launched a massive, multi-year effort to rewrite all of our
critical software, not only to be network-enabled, but to run on Sun,
HP, Microsoft, and other platforms. It was a hugely expensive and
complicated project and it created many of the same internal tensions
that our services strategy had evoked. Once again we were collaborating
with the enemy!</p>
<p>Acquiring Lotus</p>
<p>In early 1995 John came to me with a bold idea to accomplish two
objectives: fill a hole in our middleware portfolio, and plant a flag
firmly in the world of collaborative, rather than stand-alone,
computing. His idea: to acquire Lotus Development Corporation. He has
told me since then that he did it with great trepidation, because it was
very much out of character for IBM to “buy” technology rather than build
it. Besides that, John and I really didn’t know each other very well,
and he was asking me to sign a very big check.</p>
<p>Lotus had made its name with its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet software.
But what we wanted most, the crown jewel, was an elegant product called
Notes—pioneering software that supported collaboration between large
numbers of computer users.</p>
<p>By May John convinced me that IBM should acquire Lotus. Thus began
the largest software acquisition in the history of the industry. John
had approached Lotus CEO Jim Manzi several times about a possible deal,
but he had been turned down. We decided to launch an unsolicited bid. I
called Manzi on June 5 to inform him that we were initiating a hostile
takeover. I can’t be sure, but I do not believe he was surprised. His
reply was noncommittal, cold but polite—and very brief.</p>
<p>Anyone will tell you that software acquisitions are risky. The asset
you’re acquiring is human. If the critical people decide to walk (and a
lot of them would certainly have the financial wherewithal to do that
once the deal closed), then you’ve spent a lot of money for some
buildings, office equipment, and access to a customer-installed
base.</p>
<p>That part of the deal didn’t scare me. At American Express we’d
acquired First Data Resources, which had a very distinct culture, was
privately owned, and didn’t want any part of being assimilated into a
great big company. I knew it could be managed. But in the case of a
maverick software company, I also had a feeling that the effort to win
over the workforce was a battle that had to be won before the first shot
was fired. We understood that our every move was going to be scrutinized
by the Lotus employees, whose trust we desperately needed to win.</p>
<p>We knew that the Lotus workforce—much more than IBM’s at the time—was
an Internet-centric culture. We mixed the Internet and the IBM home page
for fast, unfiltered delivery of our position direct to Lotus employees
and shareholders. One minute after I’d ended the call to Manzi, our
message, including the letter we’d faxed to Lotus, was live on the Net.
As expected, the Lotus workforce knew where to look. They came and they
read. We had crossed the first hurdle in the merger of two diametrically
opposed corporate cultures.</p>
<p>Privately we were still afraid the deal could take months to
complete. Hostile takeovers often become weighty with drama, complete
with white knights, court battles, and golden parachutes. But our offer
made good strategic sense for everyone, and I think we took all the
right precautions. On Tuesday Manzi called me and we talked over dinner
in Manhattan that night. Our two companies met in small groups over the
next two days to talk about culture, legal issues, employees, and
pricing. In a law office on Friday night, we shook hands over the final
price: .2 billion. By Sunday the boards on both sides had approved the
deal. In one week we had wrapped up the biggest software deal in
history.</p>
<p>This was also the first hostile takeover enacted by IBM—as well as
something of a novelty in the business world. The New York Times said:
“Perhaps the most striking aspect of IBM’s takeover bid, and the one
that says the most about these times, is that it defies the accepted
wisdom on the difficulties of trying to acquire a company whose primary
value isn’t in its machinery or real estate but rather, in that most
mercurial of assets, people.” Fortunately, we were able to keep all of
the key people, including Ray Ozzie, the development genius behind
Notes. (Jim Manzi stayed on for a few months, but he wasn’t the kind of
person who was comfortable in a large, complex enterprise.)</p>
<p>There were approximately 2 million Notes “seats” installed in
customer locations when the deal closed, in July 1995. That grew to 90
million at the end of 2001. And while the Internet has subsequently
obviated much of the need for basic collaborative software, Lotus
remains in the sweet spot of the world of knowledge management and
collaboration.</p>
<p>In the end we gained more than a software company. Culturally we
proved that we could keep some organizational distance and allow a
fast-moving team to thrive. Perhaps most important, the hostile
acquisition sent a clear signal inside and outside IBM that we were out
of survival-mode status and serious about reclaiming a position of
influence in the industry.</p>
<p>About nine months later, and again at the urging of John Thompson, we
made another big software acquisition—Tivoli Systems—that leapfrogged us
into the market for distributed systems management products (more gorpy,
but very critical, middleware). Tivoli was a 0 million company when we
bought it. Its revenues, augmented by some business we transferred from
IBM, are now in excess of billion.</p>
<p>As I write this, IBM’s Software Group is one of the most powerful
software companies in the world and is positioned as the leading
software company in networked computing. With 2001 revenues of 3 billion
(second only to Microsoft) and pre-tax profits of about billion (growing
at a double-digit rate), we are number one or number two in every
segment of the market in which we participate.</p>
<p>The IBM software story is a wonderful microcosm of the overall
turnaround that took place at the company over the past decade.
Incredible technical resources were unleashed to deploy across the
entire industry. The catalyst to drive this transformation was an
external event—the arrival of the Internet. Spurred on by this emerging
opportunity, we rapidly restructured our assets and organization, and
poured resources into acquisitions and development strategies.</p>
