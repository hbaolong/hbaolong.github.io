<h4 id="creating-the-leadership-team">7 Creating the Leadership
Team</h4>
<p>As 1993 drew to a close, I turned my attention increasingly to the
overall IBM team, my top management team, and our Board of
Directors.</p>
<p>If you ask me today what single accomplishment I am most proud of in
all my years at IBM, I would tell you it is this—that as I retire, my
successor is a longtime IBMer, and so are the heads of all our major
business units.</p>
<p>I think it would have been absolutely naïve—as well as dangerous—if I
had come into a company as complex as IBM with a plan to import a band
of outsiders somehow magically to run the place better than the people
who were there in the first place. I’ve entered other companies from the
outside, and based on my experience, you might be able to pull that off
at a small company in a relatively simple industry and under optimal
conditions. It certainly wasn’t going to work at IBM. It was too big and
too complex a structure. More important, the company was brimming with
talented people who had unique expertise. If I didn’t give the players
on the home team a chance, they’d simply take their talent and knowledge
and go somewhere else. I just had to find the teammates who were ready
to try to do things a different way.</p>
<p>We had many big-stakes business decisions to make, so deciding whom I
was going to trust was critically important. There is no easy way to do
this. Building a management team is something you have to do business by
business, person by person, day by day. I read their reports. I watched
them interact with customers. I sat with them in meetings and evaluated
the clarity of their thinking and whether they had the courage of their
convictions or were weathervanes ready to shift direction if I scowled
or raised an eyebrow. I needed to know they were comfortable discussing
their business problems candidly with me.</p>
<p>When I disbanded the Management Committee during my first month, it
was a loud statement that there were going to be major changes in the
managerial culture of IBM. However, I still needed a top-level executive
committee to work with me to run the company, so in September I created
the Corporate Executive Committee, which overnight was widely renamed
“the CEC.” It had eleven members, including myself.</p>
<p>With an eye to the old Management Committee, I also announced what
the CEC would not do: It would not accept delegation of problem solving.
It would not sit through presentations or make decisions for the
business units. Its focus would be solely on policy issues that cut
across multiple units.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before the company’s culture decided that the CEC had
fully replaced the MC as the ultimate honorific the company could
bestow. I have never viewed getting a seat on a committee as something a
successful person should truly value. However, sometimes you have to
work within the existing system. If all the talented IBMers wanted to
work harder in order to get a seat on the CEC, under the circumstances
that was okay with me.</p>
<p>At the same time, I created a Worldwide Management Council (WMC) to
encourage communication among our businesses. The WMC had thirty-five
members and was to meet four or five times a year in two-day sessions to
discuss operating unit results and company-wide initiatives. In my mind,
however, its primary purpose was to get the executive team working
together as a group with common goals—and not to act as some United
Nations of sovereign countries. These meetings represented a chance for
our top executives to grab one another and say “I’ve got a great idea,
but I need your help.”</p>
<p>Building a New Board</p>
<p>One of the most revolutionary, but least noticed, changes in the
early days involved the Board of Directors. When I arrived there were
eighteen directors, including four insiders: John Akers, Jack Kuehler,
John Opel (IBM’s CEO before Akers), and Paul Rizzo. I thought this was
an unwieldy size with too many insiders, particularly given the
dominance of current and former employees on the powerful Executive
Committee.</p>
<p>Clearly the CEO search, the media’s public flogging of the company,
and the sharp, extended criticism at the annual meeting had traumatized
many members of the board. I quietly approached a few of them,
especially Jim Burke and Tom Murphy, for a series of discussions on
corporate governance.</p>
<p>With my encouragement, the Directors’ Committee decided it would
announce that the board should be reduced in size to make it more
manageable. At the same time, we would add new people to bring in some
different perspectives. After the announcement, it didn’t take anyone
more than a minute to realize that meant a significant amount of
retirements would be in order.</p>
<p>I think most of the directors had mixed feelings about sticking
around at that point, and some welcomed the opportunity for a graceful
exit. Burke and Murphy masterfully orchestrated a proposal that every
director offer his or her resignation and that the Directors’ Committee
would sort out the right structure for the ongoing board.</p>
<p>As a result, five directors left in 1993, then four more in 1994.
Murphy and Burke themselves retired, one year earlier than required by
IBM’s retirement rules. Their move was a sign to the others that it was
time to make room for the newcomers. A few were willing to go, but
others found the process distasteful and personally difficult.
Nevertheless, we got it all done. To the amazement of everyone, there
was never so much as a peep in the media.</p>
<p>By the end of 1994 we had a twelve-member board. I was the only
insider. Only eight remained from the eighteen who had made up the board
just a year before.</p>
<p>Starting in 1993 we began introducing newcomers, beginning with Chuck
Knight, the chairman and CEO of Emerson Electric Co. I had known Chuck
as a fellow board member at Caterpillar. He was tough and demanding of
himself, the CEO, and his fellow board members, and I admired that. He
was highly respected as one of the premier CEOs in America, and his
selection was the important first step in the rebuilding of the
board.</p>
<p>In 1994 we added Chuck Vest, president of MIT and Alex Trotman,
chairman and CEO of Ford Motor Company. Cathie Black, president and CEO
of the Newspaper Association of America, and Lou Noto, chairman and CEO
of Mobil Corporation, joined in 1995. They were followed by Juergen
Dormann, chairman of Hoechst AG, in 1996. Minoru Makihara, president of
Mitsubishi Corporation and one of the most senior business executives in
Japan, joined us in 1997; Ken Chenault, president and chief operating
officer (and later chairman and CEO) of American Express in 1998; and
Sidney Taurel, chairman and CEO of Eli Lilly and Company in 2001.</p>
<p>This board has been an important contributor to our success. Strong,
involved, effective, it has consistently practiced corporate governance
in a manner that meets the most rigorous standards. In fact, in 1994 the
California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), whose board
manages one of the world’s largest public pension funds, rated the IBM
board’s governance practices among the very best. Since then there has
been noteworthy recognition from other organizations.</p>
<p>Employee Communications</p>
<p>At the same time we were remaking our board and senior management
system, it was essential to open up a clear and continuous line of
communications with IBM employees. The sine qua non of any successful
corporate transformation is public acknowledgment of the existence of a
crisis. If employees do not believe a crisis exists, they will not make
the sacrifices that are necessary to change. Nobody likes change.
Whether you are a senior executive or an entry-level employee, change
represents uncertainty and, potentially, pain.</p>
<p>So there must be a crisis, and it is the job of the CEO to define and
communicate that crisis, its magnitude, its severity, and its impact.
Just as important, the CEO must also be able to communicate how to end
the crisis—the new strategy, the new company model, the new culture.</p>
<p>All of this takes enormous commitment from the CEO to communicate,
communicate, and communicate some more. No institutional transformation
takes place, I believe, without a multi-year commitment by the CEO to
put himself or herself constantly in front of employees and speak in
plain, simple, compelling language that drives conviction and action
throughout the organization.</p>
<p>For me at IBM this meant, in some respects, seizing the microphone
from the business unit heads, who often felt strongly about controlling
communications with “their people”—to establish their priorities, their
voice, their personal brand. In some companies, at some times, such
action may be appropriate—but not at the Balkanized IBM of the early
1990s. This was a crisis we all faced. We needed to start understanding
ourselves as one enterprise, driven by one coherent idea. The only
person who could communicate that was the CEO—me.</p>
<p>These communications were absolutely critical to me in the early
days. My message was quite simple. I stood before IBM employees all over
the world, looked into their faces and said, “Clearly, what we have been
doing isn’t working. We lost 6 billion in three years. Since 1985, more
than 175,000 employees have lost their jobs. The media and our
competitors are calling us a dinosaur. Our customers are unhappy and
angry. We are not growing like our competitors. Don’t you agree that
something is wrong and that we should try something else?”</p>
<p>I also discovered the power of IBM’s internal messaging system, and
so I began to send employees “Dear Colleague” letters. They were a very
important part of my management system at IBM. I sent the first one six
days after I’d arrived:</p>
<p>April 6, 1993</p>
<p>Office of the Chairman</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM TO: All IBM Colleagues</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Our Company</p>
<p>It wasn’t long after I arrived that I discovered on my office PC that
PROFS mail is an important vehicle of communication within IBM. Thanks
to all who sent greetings, best wishes, suggestions, and advice.</p>
<p>I’m sure you understand that I cannot reply to every message. But I
did want to take this early opportunity to acknowledge some frequent,
serious themes in your correspondence.</p>
<p>I was moved by your intense loyalty to IBM and your very clear desire
to restore IBM—as quickly as possible—to market leadership. This has
been as true of those leaving the company as of those staying here. It
all underscores that our strength is indeed our people and their
commitment to success.</p>
<p>Some of you were hurt and angered by being declared “surplus” after
years of loyalty, and by some reports in the press about performance
ratings.</p>
<p>I am acutely aware that I arrived at a painful time when there is a
lot of downsizing. I know it is painful for everyone, but we all know,
too, that it is necessary. I can only assure you that I will do
everything I can to get this painful period behind us as quickly as
possible, so that we can begin looking to our future and to building our
business.</p>
<p>I want you to know that I do not believe that those who are leaving
IBM are in any way less important, less qualified, or that they made
fewer contributions than others. Rather, we ALL owe those who are
leaving an enormous debt of gratitude and appreciation for their
contributions to IBM.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ve told me that restoring morale is important to any
business plans we develop. I couldn’t agree more. Over the next few
months, I plan to visit as many of our operations and offices as I can.
And whenever possible, I plan to meet with many of you to talk about how
together we can strengthen the company.</p>
<p>Lou Gerstner</p>
<p>The reaction from IBM employees was overwhelmingly positive and, for
me during the dark, early days, a source of comfort, support, and
energy. Said one:</p>
<p>Tears of joy came to my eyes.</p>
<p>Another wrote to me, simply:</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you. Sanity is returning to IBM.</p>
<p>At the same time, IBM employees were never afraid to speak their
minds when it came to expressing feelings of opposition. I got e-mail
messages so frank, so candid, so blunt—well, I’ll just say that when I
was younger, I would never have sent such messages to my boss, much less
the CEO. One employee wrote to me:</p>
<p>GIMME A BREAK. Do some real work. Cut the order cycle time. Get the
new products on the market. Find new markets. Listen to the folks that
are not our current customers but would be if we had products for
them.</p>
<p>Stop this bleeding heart stuff. Do things that will keep you from
having to trash more and more people every 6 months.</p>
<p>Another greeted my arrival this way:</p>
<p>Welcome and don’t worry about not knowing very much about microchips,
just as long as you don’t get them mixed up with chocolate chips.</p>
<p>One employee, even as his employer was burning and sinking to the
delight of our competitors, had the time and inclination to critique my
entire visit to an IBM facility:</p>
<p>There were three areas in which I thought your attitudes and
perspectives could be healthier. You come across as so accessible and
willing to accept feedback that I feel comfortable sharing them with you
in a note.</p>
<p>1—You gave a pecking order of importance for IBMers; first, the
Customer, second IBM, third one’s own unit. This sounds like a McKinsey
hierarchy. I submit a more appropriate number one on the list, and an
IBM tradition, is one’s self—the rest of the list could stay the same.
Respect for the individual is fundamental to health, whether it be the
health of an individual, of an organization, or of a society. (The
McKinsey hierarchy, in which the individual is somewhere after Customer
and company, burns out employees and their families.)</p>
<p>You described the need for us to examine ourselves and the way we’ve
been doing business. I also value self-reflection and suggest the
following as areas in which you may benefit from introspection. (These
are opportunities for you to lead by example.)</p>
<p>2—You seemed to want to compete and placed a great deal of importance
on beating the competition. I recognize this attitude is culturally
endorsed, but I also believe it is unnecessary, unhealthy, and less
productive than other forms of social interactions. For example, the
competitive mindset within IBM (IBMers beating IBMers) is something you
railed against. You also emphasized the need to delight Customers. I
agree with that as a goal and submit that it is a different goal from
“beating the competition.” Processes we craft to reach these goals would
be different. If we aren’t clear about our goal, we will most likely
fail to develop sound processes to achieve it.</p>
<p>A couple of particulars in this area. You mentioned “beating the
stuffing” out of someone and “ripping off their face.” Don’t these sound
like unhealthy attitudes? These “someone’s” are people with friends and
families. They may even be your friends and relatives. Competition, a
structure and attitude in which involved parties try to prevent each
other from reaching their goal is, at its very core, disrespectful of
the individual.</p>
<p>I had sent you an audiotape on this topic (“Cultural Heresy: The Case
Against Competition”) and a short description of the tape. Apparently
the tape and letter were intercepted by an administrative assistant and
never reached you. If you are interested in exploring this topic
further, I can resend you the tape.</p>
<p>You claimed that the most important measurement of our success was
the percentage of the information technology budget we had for each
Customer. This seems to me to be a case of limited thinking. A
percentage is finite and can never get larger than 100. Using this
metric, any gains one company makes has to be at the expense of one or
more other companies. If we think expansively, if we think about how we
can make the pie bigger, then everyone could experience a win. For
instance, if there is more money spent on information technology because
of its increasing value, we could be losing percentage points while
growing and making more money. (I suspect we were losing percentage
points in the early ’80s when we were expanding and making billion a
quarter.) Conversely, how interested are we in achieving 100% of the
market for card readers?</p>
<p>Though I’ve focused on the “areas of improvement” in this note, I
want to re-emphasize that I admire and respect you for the job you’ve
already done and are doing. I’m looking forward to working with you.</p>
<p>[Name deleted]</p>
<p>P.S.—I don’t know if it’s true, but I heard that in preparation for
your visit to the (Raleigh, North Carolina) site, the route you would
take was planned and the halls you would walk down or see had their
walls painted and new carpeting laid. I was wondering if you knew
whether or not this was true and if it was true, what you thought about
it.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had to bite my tongue—almost in half. All I can say is,
it was a good thing for some people that I was too busy to reply to all
my e-mail!</p>
