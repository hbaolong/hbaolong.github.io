<h4 id="the-emergence-of-e-business">18 The Emergence of e-business</h4>
<p>You’ll recall that earlier I said I’ve gotten lucky twice. I
described the first piece of luck as my initial encounter with Dennie
Welsh, the executive who shared my vision for transforming IBM into a
services-led company. Believe it or not, Dennie also played an integral
role in my second bit of luck (more on that in a moment).</p>
<p>Long before my arrival at IBM, one of the most widely discussed
technology trends in business centered on what was called
“convergence”—the melding of telecommunications, computing, and consumer
electronics; or, stated differently, the merger of traditional analog
technologies with their emerging digital kin. Depending on one’s point
of view, this either promised or threatened to transform multiple
industries.</p>
<p>The subject was not foreign to me. In February 1983, in a speech at
the University of Virginia, I made the following observation:</p>
<p>“Computer and telecommunications technologies give us a reach and
flexibility that were beyond imagination just a few years
ago.…Technology has virtually eliminated distance as an obstacle to
doing business. Today, an American Express Cardmember from Dallas can
buy a plane ticket in Kuala Lumpur and have the purchase authorized in
less than six seconds by our computer system in Phoenix, Arizona.”</p>
<p>During my brief tenure on the Board of Directors of AT&amp;T, I had
learned a great deal about the allure of convergence. That company had
bought a computer company, NCR. Some years before that, IBM had bought a
telecommunications equipment company, ROLM. Both had placed bets on
convergence. And they weren’t alone.</p>
<p>If you were a telephone company back then, you were salivating at the
prospect of getting beyond dial tone and voice services, to provide all
kinds of higher-value services—data, entertainment, and commerce—to
homes and businesses.</p>
<p>If you were in the entertainment or media business, convergence
represented the ultimate distribution channel. Not only would you be
able to digitize all your content, you’d be able to deliver it to
devices from personal computers and smart TVs to cell phones and
network-enabled wristwatches!</p>
<p>Consumer electronics companies were dreaming up a panoply of devices
that would allow billions of people to access this world of digital
information and entertainment.</p>
<p>And the information technology industry was gearing up for an
explosion of demand for the hardware and software that would manage,
process, and store the world’s digital content.</p>
<p>So, as I started to probe the strategic thinking inside IBM in 1993,
I wasn’t surprised to find a number of people who were very excited
about this issue. Which brings me back to straight-shooting Dennie
Welsh.</p>
<p>Discovering the Cloud</p>
<p>In August 1992 Dennie had landed IBM’s largest single contract ever,
the outsourcing of all of Sears’ data center operations. As part of that
contract IBM and Sears merged their private data networks into a
joint-venture company called Advantis. It was classic Dennie. He’d been
battling IBM to make our global network part of his services
organization, but he was getting nowhere with colleagues who couldn’t
quite see his vision for making the network a big-time profit center. In
one stroke he not only closed an billion contract with Sears, but he
gained control of more network capacity.</p>
<p>Eventually the joint venture with Sears was dissolved, we took total
ownership, and Advantis became part of what we called the IBM Global
Network. In its day, IGN was one of the world’s most sophisticated
networks. It was also the largest Internet service provider in the
world—truly an asset without equal, a moneymaker and our
stake-in-the-ground in the networking business.</p>
<p>Years later, and as I described in the previous chapter, we divested
ourselves of the Global Network in a billion transaction with AT&amp;T.
What I didn’t mention was that as early as 1993 we knew we’d eventually
sell this business. In one of the first conversations I had with Dennie,
we agreed that in the long term we’d never be able to justify the
massive capital investments required to compete with the telcos. With
their assets and base of capital equipment, they could easily undercut
our prices. What we couldn’t see back then was the Internet, which would
entirely obviate the need for us to own a network.</p>
<p>It had to be in one of these early discussions with Dennie that I was
introduced to “the cloud”—a graphic much loved and used on IBM charts
showing how networks were going to change computing, communications, and
all manner of business and human interaction. The cloud would be shown
in the middle. To one side there would be little icons representing
people using PCs, cell phones, and other kinds of network-connected
devices. On the other side of the cloud were businesses, governments,
universities, and institutions also connected to the network. The idea
was that the cloud—the network—would enable and support incredible
amounts of communications and transactions among people and businesses
and institutions.</p>
<p>If the strategists were right, and the cloud really did become the
locus of all this interaction, it would cause two revolutions—one in
computing and one in business.</p>
<p>It would change computing because it would shift the workloads from
PCs and other so-called client devices to larger enterprise systems
inside companies and to the cloud—the network—itself. This would reverse
the trend that had made the PC the center of innovation and
investment—with all the obvious implications for IT companies that had
made their fortunes on PC technologies.</p>
<p>Far more important, the massive, global connectivity that the cloud
depicted would create a revolution in the interactions among millions of
businesses, schools, governments, and consumers. It would change
commerce, education, health care, government services, and on and on. It
would cause the biggest wave of business transformation since the
introduction of digital data processing in the 1960s.</p>
<p>So it was natural that when I decided to put someone in charge of a
team that would investigate whether we truly believed that convergence
was the future—and if so, what to do about it—Dennie got the call. He
was passionate on the subject, by then he “owned” our network, and yet I
knew Dennie would make sure the team was objective. The team delivered
its answer and a set of detailed recommendations in three months.</p>
<p>A Network Computing Blueprint</p>
<p>Dennie’s group believed zealously—from the standpoints of technical
feasibility and the business opportunity—that this was where the
industry was headed. But again, what they presented was not primarily an
Internet strategy. That’s not surprising, because this was back in the
days when few people outside of universities and government labs had
heard of the Internet. Fewer still believed that the Internet could be a
mass-market communications medium, much less a platform for mainstream
business transactions. (One notable exception inside IBM was a marketing
executive named John Patrick, who had a unique ability to bring the
networked world out of the jargon of technology and into the minds of
everyday people. John became our spokesperson, demonstrating to our
customers and to IBM employees how real-life activities would benefit
from the Net.)</p>
<p>Whether we were thinking of networks in general or the Internet
specifically, the single most important outcome of Dennie’s task force
was a recommendation to commit the resources of the entire company to
lead this next wave of computing—to mobilize on every front.</p>
<p>On its face, and given the success we’d enjoyed based on proprietary
architectures like the System/360, this could have presented a
staggering barrier to success. But in truth this one wasn’t as tough for
us as it would be for some of our mainstream competitors, because we’d
long since made our commitment to open, standards-based computing,
including embracing all the important Internet standards and protocols.
Still, there was plenty to do, much of it described previously.</p>
<p>In software we were fortunate to recognize that middleware would be
the integrating glue of networked applications. We had to step up the
Internet enablement of these products and develop some new ones.</p>
<p>We’d have to build a significant new services business around what
came to be known as Web hosting. And because the networked world was
about helping customers transform their businesses, we had to build
capability in consulting and implementation services associated with
e-business.</p>
<p>In component technology, what began in the early 1990s as a search
for a new revenue stream turned into the foundry of specialized chips
that would be in high demand.</p>
<p>We also had to fill a lot of gaps. In the summer of 1996, IBM and
Lotus announced the Domino Web Server, the first major adaptation of
Notes capability for the networked world. We needed an
industrial-strength commerce server. After at least one false start we
created what is today known as Websphere.</p>
<p>Finally, getting the entire company on board and moving together
would be critical. If I asked one unit, such as Global Services or
Software, to take the lead, there would be inevitable resistance from
the other units. So we decided to form a new group with a pan-IBM
mission, headed by an extraordinary executive named Irving
Wladawsky-Berger. His job was to evangelize our network strategy across
all of IBM’s business units, and to get them to change their R&amp;D and
marketing plans to embrace the Net. (In what represented at least a
minor leap of faith, we called Irving’s group the Internet
Division.)</p>
<p>Irving was the ideal executive to take on this task. He had come up
through the technical side of IBM—through the IBM Research Division and
the high-end computing businesses. So he had rock-solid technical
credentials. But he also had the ability—in his endearing Cuban
accent—to translate very complex technologies into understandable ideas
that got people excited. This was important not only because many people
in the business units did not fully understand our strategy, but also
because Irving would be very effective in influencing people who did not
report to him.</p>
<p>I won’t minimize the challenges we faced in reorienting the portfolio
around the Net. I can say without hesitation, however, that a far bigger
and harder piece of work would center on shaping the debate with
customers and the industry on where the networked world was headed.</p>
<p>Shaping the Conversation</p>
<p>The first time I made public mention about any of this was to a group
of Wall Street analysts in March 1994, several months after my infamous
“vision” remark. This time, however, what I said went pretty much
unnoticed.</p>
<p>I articulated a strategic vision for IBM constructed around six
“imperatives.” One of those imperatives was a commitment to lead in what
I called the emerging “network-centric world.” It was an admittedly
clunky piece of terminology, and I can assure you that the next day’s
news reports were not ringing with anything resembling IBM’s bold foray
into the uncharted world of networked computing. So be it. By the fall
of 1995 my confidence in our strategy had increased to the point where I
decided to make network-centric computing the centerpiece of IBM’s
strategic vision.</p>
<p>In October 1995, Business Week published a cover story headlined
“Gerstner’s Growth Plan: Yes, the CEO does have a vision. It’s called
network-centric computing.” Two weeks later, on November 13, 1995, I
gave my first major, inside-the-industry keynote speech at the huge
Comdex trade show in Las Vegas. At the time Comdex was the world’s
largest PC love fest, and a big part of my message was that something
called network-centric computing was about to end the PC’s reign at the
center of the computing universe.</p>
<p>“I assume that all of you have at least one PC,” I said. “Most of you
probably have several. Unless you’re quietly tapping on your notebook
while I’m over here talking, all of those PCs are sitting idle—in your
briefcase, back in your hotel room, office, in your car, or your home.
Think about all that latent computing power that’s wasted, totally
unused. But in a truly networked world we can share computational power,
combine it, and leverage it. So this world will reshape our notions of
computing and, in particular, our notions of the personal computer. For
fifteen years, the PC has been a wonderful device for individuals. But,
ironically, the personal computer has not been well suited for that most
personal aspect of what people do: We communicate. We work together. We
interact.”</p>
<p>Things started happening fast. Netscape had made its
headline-grabbing IPO. Microsoft had its epiphany and announced it was
committing itself to the Net. There was a buzz building. On the one
hand, this was good for IBM, because more voices were now extolling the
virtues of a networked world. On the other hand, as more voices joined
the conversation and more of our competitors jumped on the networked
world bandwagon, the debates and arguments quickly overshadowed the real
import and promise of the Net. Microsoft and Netscape waged a titanic
battle over browsers. The telcos and new kinds of service providers were
racing to connect people and businesses to the Net. Many companies, both
inside and outside the IT industry, scrambled to own, leverage, and
acquire “content”—news, entertainment, weather, music—thinking that the
connected millions would pay to access all of this online digital
information.</p>
<p>None of this was good for IBM. Although we wanted to be seen as a
leader of this new era, we didn’t have a browser. We were already
planning to sell the Global Network and exit the business of providing
Internet connectivity. We said vocally and proudly that, unlike some of
our competitors who were rushing headlong to launch their own online
magazines and commerce sites, we were not going to compete with our
customers. We weren’t going to become a digital entertainment or media
company, and we weren’t going to get into online banking or stock
trading.</p>
<p>Simply put, we had a very different view of what was really
happening—about what the Net would mean for business and societal
relationships. Terms like “information superhighway” and “e-commerce”
were insufficient to describe what we were talking about. We needed a
vocabulary to help the industry, our customers, and even IBM employees
understand that what we saw transcended access to digital information
and online commerce. It would reshape every important kind of
relationship and interaction among businesses and people. Eventually our
marketing and Internet teams came forward with the term
“e-business.”</p>
<p>Frankly, the first time I heard it, it didn’t do much for me. It
didn’t mean anything. I didn’t think it was particularly memorable.
Still, it had potential, and at least it had business, not technology,
as its core idea. But we couldn’t just plop it into our ads, speeches,
and sales calls. We had to infuse the term with meaning and get others
in the industry to use it. And we had to strike a balance. We wanted to
be seen as the architects of e-business—the agenda setter for this new
era, but we decided not to trademark the term “e-business.” We wouldn’t
make it an exclusive IBM term or idea. It was more important to build an
awareness and an understanding around our point of view. Creating that
environment would require massive investments, both financial and
intellectual.</p>
<p>Our executives first unveiled “e-business” during a Wall Street
briefing in November 1996. It didn’t get a particularly enthusiastic
reception. Many months later our advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp;
Mather, developed a memorable TV advertising campaign featuring
black-and-white office dramas. They worked because they portrayed the
confusion most customers felt about the Internet, and they also
explained the Net’s real value. The commercials were an immediate hit.
This was encouraging.</p>
<p>From there we revamped all of our marketing communications—from our
trade-show presence to direct-mail campaigns. Every senior executive
made e-business a part of his or her presentations and speeches. We
communicated frequently on the subject to our people so that they could
understand and then evangelize.</p>
<p>To date IBM has invested more than billion in e-business marketing
and communications. That’s a lot of money, but the returns paid to our
brand and our market positioning are incalculable. I consider the
e-business campaign to be one of the finest jobs of brand positioning
I’ve seen in my entire career.</p>
<p>In some ways it might have been just a little too successful. In the
process of waking up the world to the idea that the Net was about
business, we might have inadvertently contributed to the spectacular
rise and fall of the dot-coms.</p>
<p>The Emperor’s New Economy</p>
<p>In a way that I found astonishing (though by this time I should have
known better), almost as soon as the marketplace accepted the idea that
the Net was a place where real work would get done, that straightforward
idea morphed into the dot-com mania of the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Somehow the Internet came to be seen as some kind of magic wand. In
the right hands it could overturn everything from basic economics to
customer behavior. It spawned a new class of born-on-the-Net competitors
who were going to destroy existing brands and entire industries
overnight. Remember the New Economy? It would replace old-fashioned
business metrics like profit and free cash flow with “page views,”
“eyeballs,” and “stickiness.”</p>
<p>Based on nothing more than a Web site, companies with no earnings and
no prospects of ever operating in the black were awarded market
valuations that exceeded many of the world’s most respected companies.
If you weren’t a dot-com, prevailing wisdom said you would be
dot-toast.</p>
<p>And so here we were, having first advanced the idea that the Net was
a medium for real business, watching this wild but totally unsustainable
wave of dot-com hysteria crest, then ultimately collapse during 2000.
I’d like to say something appropriately high-minded, like: “The courage
of our convictions prevented us from joining this fool’s-gold rush.” In
hindsight, the truth is that I’m still a little puzzled by just how easy
it was for us to detach ourselves from the dot-com frenzy.</p>
<p>In a speech to Wall Street analysts in the spring of 1999, I had a
little tongue-in-cheek fun with the very serious subject of what was
real and what was simply unreal.</p>
<p>“These are interesting companies, and maybe one or two of them will
be profitable someday. But I think of them as fireflies before the
storm—all stirred up, throwing off sparks. But the storm that’s
arriving—the real disturbance in the force—is when the thousands and
thousands of institutions that exist today seize the power of this
global computing and communications infrastructure and use it to
transform themselves. That’s the real revolution.”</p>
<p>What did we learn? What were the real lessons, after all the meteoric
ascents and equally rapid flameouts?</p>
<p>For customers I think the overriding lesson was that those who didn’t
get distracted and were willing to do the hard work had a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—not just to do things better and faster,
but to do things that, in fact, they’d never been able to do before. As
I write this, customers continue to make major investments to drive
transformation through e-business, and they will continue making those
investments for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For investors as well as customers, the lesson was: no shortcuts. I
think for a lot of people, the “e” in e-business came to stand for
“easy.” Easy money. Easy success. Easy life. When you strip it down to
bare metal, e-business is just business. And real business is serious
work.</p>
<p>For IBM the lesson was about rediscovering something we’d lost. We
found our voice, our confidence, and our ability once again to drive the
industry agenda. Our messaging allowed our customers to see benefits and
value that were not being articulated by our competitors. The concept of
e-business galvanized our workforce and created a coherent context for
our hundreds of products and services. The vast new challenges of
networked computing reenergized IBM research and triggered a new golden
age of technical achievement for the company. Most important, the
investment did what we wanted to do at the outset—reestablish IBM’s
leadership in the industry.1</p>
