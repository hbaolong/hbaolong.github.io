<h4 id="unstacking-the-stack-and-focusing-the-portfolio">17 Unstacking
the Stack and Focusing the Portfolio</h4>
<p>Before you proceed with this chapter, let me make one disclaimer
about the upcoming diagram. I am not going to launch into a primer on
computing topologies. Instead, I want to use this oversimplified picture
of the industry’s structure to illustrate the flip side of our work to
restore IBM’s economic viability. This is about the bone-jarringly
difficult task of forcing the organization to limit its ambition and
focus on markets that made strategic and economic sense.</p>
<p>The diagram is commonly called “the stack,” and people in the
computer industry love to talk about it. The stack shows most of the
major pieces in a typical computing environment. At the base are
components that are assembled into finished hardware products; operating
systems, middleware, and software applications sit above the hardware;
and it’s all topped off by a whole range of services. Of course, it
isn’t anywhere near as simple as this in real life.</p>
<p>By now you know that IBM’s strategy when it birthed the System/360
was to design and make every layer of this stack. But thirty years later
the industry model had changed in two fundamental ways. First, very
small companies were providing pieces inside the stack that IBM had
invented and owned for so long, and customers were purchasing and
integrating these pieces themselves.</p>
<p>Second, and just as threatening, two more stacks emerged. One was
based on the open UNIX operating platform. The second was based on the
closed Intel/Microsoft platform. In the mid 1980s, when IBM had more
than a 30 percent share of the industry, the company could safely ignore
these offshoots. But by the early 1990s, when IBM’s share position was
below 20 percent and still falling fast, it was long past time for a
different strategy.</p>
<p>We had to accept the fact that we simply could not be everything to
everybody. Other companies would make a very good living inside the IBM
stack. More important, just to stay competitive we were going to have to
mount massive technical development efforts. We couldn’t afford not to
participate in the other stacks, where billions of dollars of
opportunity was being created.</p>
<p>I’ve already described the results of our decision to expand into the
UNIX and Wintel markets—reinventing our own hardware platforms at the
same time that we built new businesses in software, services, and
component technologies. Just as important, we had to get serious about
where we were going to stake our long-term claims inside the IBM
stack.</p>
<p>The first and bloodiest decision was the determination that we would
walk away from the OS/2 v. Windows slugfest and build our software
business around middleware. Before the 1990s came to a close, we made
another strategic withdrawal from a software market.</p>
<p>The Stack</p>
<p>Leaving Application Software</p>
<p>For most of its modern history, IBM made and sold hundreds of
business applications, for customers in industries like manufacturing,
financial services, distribution, travel, insurance, and health care.
These were important applications for important customers, yet we were
accomplishing little more than losing our shirts. Jerry York conducted
an audit that showed over the previous twenty years IBM had invested
about 0 billion in application development and acquisition, with a
negative rate of return of around 70 percent!</p>
<p>This was—and is—a very specialized segment of the industry:
everything from small-business payroll packages to software for
automotive design or even the sophisticated software used to simulate
biological and genetic activities. It has always been dominated by
entrepreneurial companies that bring obsessive focus to their
specialties—such as sales force automation or financial services.
Interestingly, nobody has ever succeeded in building a broad
portfolio.</p>
<p>When I questioned why we stayed in this business, I was told that
application software was critical to the total solution (which was true
enough) and that our problems were of execution, and therefore fixable.
So we changed executives, tinkered with the strategy, and studied
whether we should just buy a few of the best firms in the field. The
first candidate was going to be SAP.</p>
<p>Three years, a lot of activity, and a few billion dollars later, we
still weren’t solution leaders, and we weren’t getting anything close to
a decent return on our huge investments.</p>
<p>However, one thing we were doing exceptionally well was irritating
the heck out of the leading application providers—companies like SAP,
PeopleSoft, and JD Edwards. These companies were in a great position to
generate a lot of business for us if they were inclined to have their
applications running on our hardware and supported by our services. Why?
Because customers often bought the application first, then looked to
that software provider to tell them which hardware to run it on. As long
as these companies saw us as a rival, we were driving them into the arms
of competitors like Sun or HP.</p>
<p>One example: The segment of IBM that produced applications for
distribution and manufacturing customers set a stretch goal to increase
sales by 0 million (from a base of about 00 million). It ran ads and
promotions and sales contests, and it hit its target. In the process, it
alienated every software company in that segment of the market. Those
companies, in turn, stopped recommending our hardware and contributed
directly to a billion decline in sales of one of our most popular
products.</p>
<p>By 1999 we were finally ready to admit to ourselves that we could
never be as single-minded as application providers that were in business
to do just one thing—and do it better than anyone else. We exited
application development but saved the very few pieces of software that
IBM had successfully developed and marketed in the past. Thousands of
software engineers were reassigned to other work, laboratories were
closed, and investments were written off or sold.</p>
<p>Important as it was to stop deluding ourselves about our proficiency
in this part of the stack, just as important was the message that we
were prepared to work with the leading application software developers.
What we said to them was: “We are going to leave this market to you; we
are going to be your partner rather than your competitor; we will work
with you to make sure your applications run superbly on our hardware,
and we will support your applications with our services group.”</p>
<p>And rather than just having lunch with them and saying “Let’s be
partners,” we structured detailed commitments, revenue and share
targets, and measurements by which both parties agreed to abide.</p>
<p>The first company we approached was Siebel Systems, which had a
leadership customer relationship management software package. Its CEO,
Tom Siebel, was understandably enthusiastic about the prospect of having
IBM’s worldwide sales force and services organization marketing and
supporting his product. But based on what he’d observed of IBM’s agility
(or lack thereof), Siebel told us he doubted we could structure a deal
on his timetable. He bet the IBM team a bottle of fine wine that the
whole process would break down due to what he called “cultural impedance
mismatch” between Siebel and IBM.</p>
<p>Five days later Tom was picking out a fine Chardonnay. The contract
was signed and we announced the relationship and the new alliance
program. Over the next two years we signed 180 similar partnerships.</p>
<p>In hindsight this looks like a no-brainer, given that it dramatically
improved the economics of our business and was entirely consistent with
our overarching strategy of being the premier integrator. Software
companies that in the early 1990s viewed IBM as a major competitor are
now very important partners. The amount of incremental revenue we
realized is in the billions, and we achieved significant market share
gains in 2000, then again in 2001.</p>
<p>The IBM Network</p>
<p>Some may think that the task of moving data from centralized
computers to distributed computers, or from one manufacturing site to
another, or from one country to another, would be the natural domain of
telecommunications companies that had been providing voice transmission
for nearly a century. However, until very recently telephone companies
had minimal skills in data transmission, and voice services were based
on a totally different technology. Moreover, the industry was
nationalistic, monopolistic, and highly regulated. Global
telecommunications companies did not emerge until the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of “If they need it, we will build it,” IBM in the
1970s and 1980s created multiple data networks to allow its customers to
transfer data around the globe. We filled an important void.</p>
<p>By the early 1990s, however, the telecommunications companies were
shifting their focus dramatically. Driven in part by deregulation, as
well as by the revenue potential of digital services, all of the world’s
major telecommunications companies were seeking ways to create a global
presence, as well as digital capability. In the parlance of both the IT
and telecommunications industries, they were talking about moving up the
value chain. United States companies that had provided telephone service
to customers only in a certain geographic sector of the country were
suddenly investing in Latin American telephone companies. European
telephone companies were joining consortia and building wireless
networks in remote parts of the world.</p>
<p>In a period of about twenty-four months, the CEOs of nearly every
major telecommunications company in the world traveled to Armonk to talk
with me about how their companies and IBM could team up to create
digital services. The proposals presented to us ran the full
spectrum—from modest joint activities to full-blown mergers. However,
affiliating IBM in one way or another with a telephone company made no
sense to me. I saw little to be gained from a partnership with a
regulated company in a different industry. Besides that, we had enough
problems in IBM’s base business. I wasn’t inclined to take on additional
challenges.</p>
<p>What did occur to me was that we had an asset that most of these
companies would be seeking to build over the next five years. And if the
world was moving in the direction we anticipated—toward a glut of many
networks (the Internet wasn’t even an important consideration at the
time)—then the value of our network would never be higher. So we chose
to auction it off to the highest bidder. We thought we’d be doing well
to get .5 billion. But the frenzy eventually produced a bid of billion
from AT&amp;T; that was an extraordinary price for a business that
produced a relatively tiny percentage of IBM’s profits.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean it wasn’t a good transaction for AT&amp;T. It
allowed AT&amp;T to leapfrog its competitors. But for IBM it was a
strategic coup. We got out of a business whose value was going to
deteriorate very quickly, as massive capacity was added around the
globe. We avoided the huge capital investment to maintain the network.
And we exited from another part of the stack that was not strategically
vital.</p>
<p>To say there was heavy resistance inside parts of IBM understates the
point. People argued, passionately, that we were shortchanging our
future. They simply couldn’t see the logic in jettisoning a global data
network when we all believed we were on the brink of a networked world.
Once again there was the “Do it all to be the best” argument. And once
again we opted for focus over breadth.</p>
<p>The PC Dilemma</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult part of the business that needed to be
overhauled during my tenure at IBM was the PC segment of our portfolio.
Over the course of nearly fifteen years, IBM had made little or no money
from PCs. We sold tens of billions of dollars’ worth of PCs during that
time. We’d won awards for technical achievement and ergonomic design
(especially in our ThinkPad line of mobile computers). But at the end of
the day it had been a relatively unprofitable activity. There were times
when we lost money on every PC we sold, and so we were conflicted—if
sales were down, was that bad news or good news?</p>
<p>The single most important factor in our overall performance was that
Intel and Microsoft controlled the key hardware and software
architectures and were able to price accordingly. However, we weren’t
innocent bystanders as they had achieved those dominant positions. We
had entered the business in the 1980s with a lack of enthusiasm for the
product, as I’ve already noted. We had consistently underestimated the
size and importance of the PC market. We had never developed a sustained
leadership position in distribution, vacillating between company-owned
stores at one time, to dealers, to distributors, to telephone sales
systems. Finally, we couldn’t manufacture PCs in a world-class manner in
respect to cost and speed to market.</p>
<p>Despite this unacceptable performance, we were never prepared to get
out. There were many reasons for this, some more applicable in the early
1990s than they are today. But suffice it to say that, at that time, the
PC represented a lot of revenue and critical customer mind-share. In
very real ways, a company’s PC drove the company’s image in the
industry. There were raging internal debates about this, but ultimately
we felt we couldn’t abandon the PC completely and still be the
integrator we needed to be for our customers.</p>
<p>So we adopted a strategy of playing to our strengths, primarily in
mobile computing and in the market for systems that connected other PCs
and helped them function in an integrated way. We waited too long to do
it, but we finally abandoned the more commodity-like segments, ceasing
to sell to consumers through retail stores and shifting more of our
consumer business to direct channels such as ibm.com and telesales.
Later on we turned over the development and manufacturing of most of our
PCs to third parties, lowering our exposure to this segment even
further. Still, it’s a spotty record at best, and I am not terribly
proud of it.</p>
<p>There were many other steps taken to withdraw from parts of the stack
and focus our portfolio. We exited network hardware. Even though we had
invented this business, we simply failed to exploit it over the
subsequent fifteen or twenty years. We exited the DRAM business. As
mentioned earlier, it is a commodity-based, notoriously cyclical market.
Midway through 2002 we agreed to divest our hard-disk-drive business
through an agreement with Hitachi. As I write these words, other
candidates are under active review. This process of selecting markets
and competing on the basis of a distinctive, sustainable competency is
essential to the new IBM, and I know it will be an ongoing
challenge.</p>
<p>Fallacies and Myths and Lessons</p>
<p>As that work proceeds, it is my hope that the company’s new leaders
keep sight of some of the higher-level lessons that resulted from these
decisions.</p>
<p>With os/2-the fallacy that the best technology always wins.</p>
<p>I can understand why this one, in particular, was hard for IBM to
accept. In the early days of the computer industry, systems failed
frequently and the winner was usually the one with the best technology.
So we came to the OS/2 v. Windows conformation with a product that was
technically superior and a cultural inability to understand why we were
getting flogged in the marketplace.</p>
<p>First, the buyers were individual consumers, not senior technology
officers. Consumers didn’t care much about advanced, but arcane,
technical capability. They wanted a PC that was easy to use, with a lot
of handy applications. And, as with any consumer product—from
automobiles to bubble gum to credit cards or cookies—marketing and
merchandising mattered.</p>
<p>Second, Microsoft had all the software developers locked up, so all
the best applications ran on Windows. Microsoft’s terms and conditions
with the PC manufacturers made it impossible for them to do anything but
deliver Windows—ready to go, preloaded on every PC they sold. (Even
IBM’s own PCs came preloaded with OS/2 and Windows!) And in the
mid-1980s, the Windows marketing and PR machine alone had more people
than IBM had working with software partners or distributors. Our
wonderful technology was whipped by a product that was merely okay, but
supported by a company that truly understood what the customer wanted.
For a “solutions” company like IBM, it was a bitter but vital
lesson.</p>
<p>In the case of application software-the myth of “account
control.”</p>
<p>This was a term used by IBM and others to talk about how a company
maintained its hold on customers and their wallets. It suggests that
once customers buy something from a company, then train their people on
that product and get familiar with how to support it, it’s very hard for
them to move to a competitor.</p>
<p>As a former customer, I was always offended and indignant that
information technology companies talked about controlling customers. I
had this quaint view that it was the job of a supplier to serve
customers, not control them!</p>
<p>What IBM has learned from this part of the “unstacking” is that we
can be the premier integrator and, at the same time, partner with many
other companies in delivering an integrated solution. In fact, wearing
my customer hat, I could argue that the role of IT partner, or
integrator, cannot be fulfilled by companies that support only one
technology or one stack. Beware, customers, of suppliers who provide
only UNIX or Wintel answers to your problems. Beware of totally
proprietary vendors who fight new developments like Linux. These vendors
still view the world through the window of their proprietary stack.</p>
<p>At IBM we now focus on a different stack: the customer’s business
processes and how we can bring world-class technology—both our own and
that provided by other leading companies—to improve those processes.</p>
<p>In the case of PCS, there are still unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Why did we make the decision to exit the application software,
network hardware, DRAMs, or the data transmission businesses, but not
PCs? Why did we decide to stay in the hardware end of this business,
even as we folded our hand on OS/2? In hindsight, was this the right
decision? I think it was at the time, but the decision has been painful
and costly for IBM.</p>
<p>If there is one lesson to be extracted from this saga, I think it’s
about staying true to one’s strategic vision. I said in 1993 that the
marketplace would drive every important decision we at IBM made. But
when it came to the PC business, we weren’t paying attention to either
our customers or our competitors.</p>
<p>One competitor in the PC industry was proving that customers were
perfectly willing to buy direct—over the phone, or later via a Web site.
But we were painfully slow to move away from our existing distribution
channels. Why? The incomplete and unsatisfying answer at the time was
that we’d always done it that way.</p>
<p>I’m not saying the shift to lower-cost, direct channels wouldn’t have
involved some pain, and I’m not saying that actually sticking to a
strategic vision is as easy as articulating it. The tendency, especially
in a hyper-competitive marketplace, is to establish a position, hunker
down, and defend it. But if we had focused on the marketplace and done
our homework, there’s no reason the IBM PC business today would be
looking up the leader board at Dell.</p>
<p>Opening up our stack (and our minds) to others had many positive
effects on IBM. It cut our losses and improved our integrated offerings
to customers. And it freed up resources to invest in the future. Huge
sums of money and huge quantities of brainpower have been redeployed
from wall-banging futility to exciting new work in areas such as storage
systems, self-directing computers, bioinformatics, and
nanotechnology.</p>
<p>It is all about focus—a subject I will return to later.</p>
