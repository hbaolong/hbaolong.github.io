<h4 id="the-courtship">1 The Courtship</h4>
<p>On December 14, 1992, I had just returned from one of those always
well-intentioned but rarely stimulating charity dinners that are part of
a New York City CEO’s life, including mine as CEO of RJR Nabisco. I had
not been in my Fifth Avenue apartment more than five minutes when my
phone rang with a call from the concierge desk downstairs. It was nearly
10 P.M. The concierge said, “<strong>Mr. Burke wants to see you as soon
as possible this evening.</strong>”</p>
<p>Startled at such a request so late at night in a building in which
neighbors don’t call neighbors, I asked which Mr. Burke, where is he
now, and does he really want to see me face to face this evening?</p>
<p>The answers were: “Jim Burke. He lives upstairs in the building. And,
yes, he wants very much to speak to you tonight.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know Jim Burke well, but I greatly admired his leadership at
Johnson &amp; Johnson, as well as at Partnership for a Drug-Free
America. His handling of the Tylenol poisoning crisis years earlier had
made him a business legend. I had no idea why he wanted to see me so
urgently. When I called, he said he would come right down.</p>
<p>When he arrived he got straight to the point: “I’ve heard that you
may go back to American Express as CEO, and I don’t want you to do that
because I may have a much bigger challenge for you.” The reference to
American Express was probably prompted by rumors that I was going to
return to the company where I had worked for eleven years. In fact, in
mid-November 1992, three members of the American Express board had met
secretly with me at the Sky Club in New York City to ask that I come
back. It’s hard to say if I was surprised—Wall Street and the media were
humming with speculation that then CEO Jim Robinson was under board
pressure to step down. However, I told the three directors politely that
I had no interest in returning to American Express. I had loved my
tenure there, but I was not going back to fix mistakes I had fought so
hard to avoid. (Robinson left two months later.)</p>
<ul>
<li>tenure,英 [ˈtenjə(r)] 美 [ˈtenjər]
n. （土地的）居住权，保有权；（尤指大学教师的）终身职位，长期聘用；（尤指重要政治职务的）任期，任职
v. 授予……终身职位（尤指教师、讲师职位）</li>
</ul>
<p>I told Burke I wasn’t returning to American Express. He told me that
the top position at IBM might soon be open and he wanted me to consider
taking the job. Needless to say, I was very surprised. While it was
widely known and reported in the media that IBM was having serious
problems, there had been no public signs of an impending change in CEOs.
<strong>I told Burke that, given my lack of technical background, I
couldn’t conceive of running IBM.</strong> He said, “I’m glad you’re not
going back to American Express. And please, <strong>keep an open mind on
IBM.</strong>” That was it. <strong>He went back upstairs, and I went to
bed thinking about our conversation.</strong></p>
<p>The media drumbeat intensified in the following weeks. Business-Week
ran a story titled “IBM’s Board Should Clean Out the Corner Office.”
Fortune published a story, “King John [Akers, the chairman and CEO]
Wears an Uneasy Crown.” <strong>It seemed that everyone had advice about
what to do at IBM, and reading it, I was glad I wasn’t there.</strong>
The media, at least, appeared convinced that IBM’s time had long
passed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Search</li>
</ul>
<p>On January 26, 1993, IBM announced that John Akers had decided to
retire and that a search committee had been formed to consider outside
and internal candidates. The committee was headed by Jim Burke. It
didn’t take long for him to call.</p>
<p>I gave Jim the same answer in January as I had in December: I wasn’t
qualified and I wasn’t interested. He urged me, again: “Keep an open
mind.”</p>
<p>He and his committee then embarked on a rather public sweep of the
top CEOs in America. Names like Jack Welch of General Electric, Larry
Bossidy of Allied Signal, George Fisher of Motorola, and even Bill Gates
of Microsoft surfaced fairly quickly in the press. So did the names of
several IBM executives. The search committee also conducted a series of
meetings with the heads of many technology companies, presumably seeking
advice on who should lead their number one competitor! (Scott McNealy,
CEO of Sun Microsystems, candidly told one reporter that IBM should hire
“someone lousy.”) In what was believed to be a first-of-its-kind
transaction, the search committee hired two recruiting firms in order to
get the services of the two leading recruiters—Tom Neff of Spencer
Stuart Management Consultants N.V., and Gerry Roche of Heidrick &amp;
Struggles International, Inc.</p>
<ul>
<li>committee,英 [kəˈmɪti] 美 [kəˈmɪti]
n. 委员会；<英>受托人，监护人；<美>精神病者监护人</li>
</ul>
<p>In February I met with Burke and his fellow search committee member,
Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities/ABC. Jim made an emphatic, even
passionate pitch that the board was not looking for a technologist, but
rather a broad-based leader and change agent. In fact, Burke’s message
was consistent throughout the whole process. At the time the search
committee was established, he said, “<strong>The committee members and I
are totally open-minded about who the new person will be and where he or
she will come from. What is critically important is the person must be a
proven, effective leader—one who is skilled at generating and managing
change.</strong>”</p>
<p>Once again, I told Burke and Murphy that I really did not feel
qualified for the position and that I did not want to proceed any
further with the process. The discussion ended amicably and they went
off, I presumed, to continue the wide sweep they were carrying out,
simultaneously, with multiple candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li>What the Experts Had to Say</li>
</ul>
<p>I read what the press, Wall Street, and the Silicon Valley computer
visionaries and pundits were saying about IBM at that time. All of it
certainly fueled my skepticism and, I believe, that of many of the other
candidates.</p>
<p>Most prominent were two guys who seemed to pop up everywhere you
looked, in print and on TV—Charles Morris and Charles Ferguson. They had
written a book, Computer Wars, that took a grim view of IBM’s prospects.
They stated: “There is a serious possibility that IBM is finished as a
force in the industry. Bill Gates, the software tycoon whom everybody in
the industry loves to hate, denies having said in an unguarded moment
that IBM ‘will fold in seven years.’ But Gates may be right. IBM is now
an also-ran in almost every major computer technology introduced since
1980.…Traditional big computers are not going to disappear overnight,
but they are old technology, and the realm in which they hold sway is
steadily shrinking. The brontosaurus moved deeper into the swamps when
the mammals took over the forests, but one day it ran out of
swamps.”</p>
<p>Their book concluded that “<strong>the question for the present is
whether IBM can survive. From our analysis thus far, it is clear that we
think its prospects are very bleak.</strong>”</p>
<p>Morris and Ferguson wrote a longer, more technical, and even grimmer
report on IBM and sold it to corporations and institutions for a few
thousand dollars per copy. Among others, it frightened a number of
commercial banks that were lenders to IBM.</p>
<p>Paul Carroll, IBM’s beat reporter at The Wall Street Journal,
published a book that year chronicling IBM’s descent. In it, he said:
“The world will look very different by the time IBM pulls itself
together—assuming it can pull itself together—and IBM will never again
hold sway over the computer industry.”</p>

</ul>
<p>Even The Economist—understated and reliable—over the span of six
weeks, published three major stories and one lengthy editorial on IBM’s
problems. “Two questions still hang over the company,” its editors
wrote. “In an industry driven by rapid technological change and swarming
with smaller, nimbler firms, <strong>can a company of IBM’s size,
however organized, react quickly enough to compete?</strong> And can IBM
earn enough from expanding market segments such as computer services,
software, and consulting to offset the horrifying decline in mainframe
sales, from which it has always made most of its money?</p>
<p>“<strong>The answer to both questions may be no.</strong>”</p>
<p>And, said the usually sober Economist, “IBM’s humiliation is already
being viewed by some as a defeat for America.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The Decision</li>
</ul>
<p>The turning point in my thinking occurred over Presidents’ Day
weekend in February 1993. <strong>I was at my house in Florida, where I
love to walk the beach, clearing and settling my mind.</strong> It’s
very therapeutic for me. During an hour’s walk each day that weekend, I
realized that I had to think differently about the IBM situation. What
prompted my change of heart was what was happening at RJR Nabisco. As I
noted in the Introduction, it had become clear that KKR had given up on
making its leveraged buyout work as planned. There were two reasons for
this. First, as discussed in Bryan Burroughs and John Helyar’s book
Barbarians at the Gate, in the fury and madness of the bidding process
in 1988, KKR overpaid for RJR Nabisco. This meant that despite achieving
all of the restructuring objectives of the LBO, there simply wasn’t
enough operating leverage to produce the projected returns. Second, the
operating returns from the tobacco business were under pressure as a
result of a price war started by Philip Morris soon after the RJR
Nabisco buy out. Philip Morris was simply following the advice of Ray
Kroc, founder of McDonald’s, who’d once said, “When you see your
competitor drowning, grab a fire hose and put it in his mouth.”</p>
<p>KKR obviously was working on an exit strategy. As I walked the beach
that February, I decided I should be doing the same thing. And so, as
much as anything else, the view that I would not be at RJR Nabisco too
much longer was what got me thinking more about the IBM proposal.</p>
<p>I called Vernon Jordan, the Washington attorney who was a longtime
friend as well as a director of RJR Nabisco, and asked his advice. He
confirmed my feeling that KKR was ready to move out of RJR Nabisco and
that this phase of the company’s tumultuous life was coming to an end.
Also, it was clear that Jim Burke had already talked with Vernon,
because Vernon knew I was on the IBM list. His advice was, as usual, to
the point. He said, “<strong>IBM is the job you have been in training
for since you left Harvard Business School. Go for it!</strong>”</p>
<p>I suppose there was a second reason I changed my mind. I have always
been drawn to a challenge. The IBM proposition was daunting and almost
frightening, but it was also intriguing. The same was true of RJR
Nabisco when I’d joined it in 1989. <strong>I think it is fair to say
that from February 15 on, I was prepared to consider taking on IBM and
its problems.</strong> Vernon got word to Jim Burke that I might be in
play after all. I began to organize my questions and concerns for Burke
and his committee.</p>
<p>When Burke called later that week, I told him that I would take a
look at the IBM job. I told him I would need a lot more information,
particularly about the company’s short- and intermediate-term prospects.
The dire predictions of the media and the pundits had me worried. I had
learned a hard lesson at RJR Nabisco: <strong>A company facing too many
challenges can run out of cash very quickly.</strong></p>
<h5

<li>dire,英 [ˈdaɪə(r)] 美 [ˈdaɪər] adj.
极其严重的，极可怕的；<非正式>极糟的，极差的；预示灾难的；紧急的，急迫的</li>
</ul>
<p>I told Burke that I wanted to meet with Paul Rizzo. Paul had been an
executive at IBM in the 1980s. I had met him on several occasions and
admired him greatly. He had retired from IBM in 1987 but had been called
back by the IBM Board of Directors in December 1992 to work with John
Akers to stem the decline of the company. I told Burke during that
February phone call that I wanted to go over the budget and plans for
1993 and 1994 with Rizzo.</p>
<p>Jim moved quickly, and on February 24, at the Park Hyatt hotel in
Washington, D.C., where I was attending a meeting of The Business
Council, I broke away for an hour and a half to meet secretly with Paul
in my hotel room. He had brought me the current financials and budgets
for the company.</p>
<p>The discussion that ensued was very sobering. IBM’s sales and profits
were declining at an alarming rate. More important, its cash position
was getting scary. We went over each product line. A lot of the
information was difficult to evaluate. However, Paul clearly underscored
the make-or-break issue for the company: He said that mainframe revenue
had dropped from 3 billion in 1990 to a projection of less than billion
in 1993, and if it did not level off in the next year or so, all would
be lost. He also confirmed that the reports in the press about IBM
pursuing a strategy of breaking up the company into independent
operating units was true. I thanked Paul for his honesty and insight and
promised to treat the material with total confidentiality.</p>
<ul>
<li>sober,英 [ˈsəʊbə(r)] 美 [ˈsoʊbər] adj.
未喝醉的，清醒的；严肃的，冷静的；素淡的，朴素的 v.

</ul>
<p><strong>When he left the room, I was convinced that, on the basis of
those documents, the odds were no better than one in five that IBM could
be saved and that I should never take the position.</strong> A consumer
products company has long-term brands that go on forever. However, that
was clearly not the case in a technology company in the 1990s. There, a
product could be born, rise, succeed wildly, crash, disappear, and be
forgotten all within a few years. When I woke up the next morning, I was
convinced IBM was not in my future. The company was slipping rapidly,
and whether that decline could be arrested in time—by anyone—was at
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Still, Jim Burke would not give up.</strong> His persistence
may have had more to do with a growing desperation to get anyone to take
this job than it did with a particular conviction that I was the right
candidate. <strong>I wondered at this point if he was just trying to
keep a warm body in play.</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks later I was back in Florida for a brief vacation. Burke and
Murphy insisted on a meeting to pursue the issue one last time. We met
in a new house that headhunter Gerry Roche and his wife had just built
in a community near my own. Roche only played the role of host. In his
new living room, it was Burke, Murphy, and me alone. I remember that it
was a long afternoon.</p>
<p>Burke introduced the most novel recruitment argument I have ever
heard: “<strong>You owe it to America to take the job.</strong>” He said
IBM was such a national treasure that it was my obligation to fix
it.</p>
<ul>
<li>obligation,英 [ˌɒblɪˈɡeɪʃ(ə)n] 美 [ˌɑːblɪˈɡeɪʃn]
n. （法律上或道义上的）义务，责任；恩惠，人情债；（承诺付款等的）合同，契约；必须要做的事情</li>
</ul>
<p>I responded that what he said might be true only if I felt confident
I could do it. However, I remained convinced the job was not doable—at
least not by me.</p>
<p>Burke persisted. <strong>He said he was going to have President Bill
Clinton call me and tell me that I had to take the job.</strong></p>
<p>Tom Murphy, who tended to let Burke do most of the talking in our
previous meetings, spoke up more frequently this time. Murph, as he is
called by his friends, was quite persuasive in arguing that my track
record as a change agent (his term) was exactly what IBM needed and that
he believed there was a reasonable chance that, with the right
leadership, the company could be saved. He reiterated what I’d heard
from Burke, and even Paul Rizzo. The company didn’t lack for smart,
talented people. Its problems weren’t fundamentally technical in nature.
It had file drawers full of winning strategies. Yet, the company was
frozen in place. What it needed was someone to grab hold of it and shake
it back into action. The point Murphy came back to again and again was
that the challenge for the next leader would begin with driving the kind
of strategic and cultural change that had characterized a lot of what
I’d done at American Express and RJR.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of that long afternoon, I was prepared to make the
most important career decision of my life. I said yes.</strong> In
retrospect, it’s almost hard for me to remember why. I suppose it was
some of Jim Burke’s patriotism and some of Tom Murphy’s arguments
playing to my gluttony for world-class challenges. At any rate, we shook
hands and agreed to work out a financial package and announcement.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it’s interesting that both Burke and Murphy were
operating under the assumption provided by the management of IBM that a
strategy of breaking up the company into independent units was the right
one to pursue. What would they have said if they realized that not only
was the company in financial trouble and had lost touch with its
customers, but that it was also barreling toward a strategy of
disaster?</p>
<p>I drove home that afternoon and told my family of my decision. As
usual in my wonderful family, I got a mixed reaction. One of my children
said, “Yes, go for it, Dad!” The other, more conservative child thought
I had lost my mind. <strong>My wife, who had been quite wary of the idea
originally, supported my decision and was excited about it.</strong></p>
