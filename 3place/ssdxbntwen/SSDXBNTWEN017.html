<h4 id="making-the-big-bets">13 Making the Big Bets</h4>
<p>If one were to reduce the story of IBM’s transformation over the past
decade to the bare essentials, the saga would pivot on two big bets: one
on the industry’s direction, and one on IBM’s own strategy. To
understand what we did and why we did it, it’s helpful to dial back in
time and rejoin the discussion of IBM history where it left off in the
previous chapter.</p>
<p>Remember that the 1994 time frame I’m describing falls just prior to
the Internet revolution. There was a growing confidence inside IBM that
the industry was on the cusp of a fundamental shift—the kind of change
to the underlying model of computing that comes along about every ten or
fifteen years. When that kind of a shift occurs, the companies that
seize the moment and lead the movement do exceptionally well—and
everyone else dances to their tune.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the fortunes of the lead horses, in one way or
another, were all related to the PC. Of course, that included the PC
makers like Dell and Compaq. But without question the dominant leaders
were Microsoft, which controlled the desktop operating system, Windows;
and Intel, which made the microprocessors. To illustrate the influence
these companies wielded, the tandem of Microsoft’s Windows and Intel’s
chips became known as the “Wintel duopoly.”</p>
<p>So there was IBM, the company that had led the prior phase of
computing and had invented many of the industry’s most important
technologies, crawling out of bed every morning to find its relevance
marginalized by the darlings of desktop computing. The people who had
built the systems used by multinational corporations, universities, and
world governments were now following the lead of purveyors of word
processors and computer games. The situation was embarrassing and
frustrating. However, no matter how miserable the present seemed, the
future looked even worse.</p>
<p>Their Real Motive</p>
<p>No one believed the PC companies would be content to be king-pins of
the desktop. Their aspirations reached right to the heart of IBM’s
franchise—the large servers, enterprise software and storage systems
that anchored the business computing infrastructure. The very name of
the new computing model they envisioned—“client/server”
computing—revealed their worldview and bias. The “client” referred not
to a person, but to the PC. The “server” described mainframes and other
business systems that would be in service of the client—providing
applications, processing, and storage support for hundreds of millions
of PCs each day.</p>
<p>The PC leaders’ pitch to business customers was simple and
compelling: “You want your employees to make productive use of your
business data, applications, and knowledge, which are tied up on old
back-office systems. Right now those systems and your PCs don’t work
together. Since all of your PCs are already Microsoft and Intel
machines, you should put in back-office systems that use the same
technology.”</p>
<p>It was easy to play out the scenario. The PC leaders would march
relentlessly up from the PC into business computing and displace
IBMproducts, along with those of vendors like Sun, HP, Digital
Equipment, and Oracle. Many of IBM’s traditional competitors threw in
the towel and joined the duopoly team. It would have been easy to follow
HP and UNISYS and all the rest down this path. All of the pundits who
followed the industry saw the dominance of this model as inevitable.</p>
<p>It would also have been easy simply to be stubborn and say that the
changeover wasn’t going to happen, then fight a rear-guard action based
on our historical view of a centralized computing model.</p>
<p>What happened, however, is that we did neither. We saw two forces
emerging in the industry that allowed us to chart a very different
course. At the time, it was fraught with risk. But perhaps because the
other alternatives were so unpalatable, we decided to stake the
company’s future on a totally different view of the industry.</p>
<p>The first force emanated from the customers. I believed very strongly
that customers would grow increasingly impatient with an industry
structure that required them to integrate piece parts from many
different suppliers. This was an integral part of the client/server
model as it emerged in the 1980s. So we made a bet—one that, had we
articulated it loudly at the time, would have left our colleagues in the
industry rolling in the aisles.</p>
<p>Our bet was this: Over the next decade, customers would increasingly
value companies that could provide solutions—solutions that integrated
technology from various suppliers and, more important, integrated
technology into the processes of an enterprise. We bet that the
historical preoccupations with chip speeds, software versions,
proprietary systems, and the like would wane, and that over time the
information technology industry would be services-led, not
technology-led.</p>
<p>The second force we bet on was the emergence of a networked model of
computing that would replace the PC-dominated world of 1994.</p>
<p>Let me briefly describe our thinking at the time.</p>
<p>A Services-Led Model</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, I believed that the industry’s disaggregation
into thousands of niche players would make IT services a huge growth
segment of the industry overall. All of the industry growth analyses and
projections, from our own staffs and from third-party firms, supported
this. For IBM, this clearly suggested that we should grow our services
business, which was a promising part of our portfolio, but which was
still seen as a second-class citizen next to IBM’s hardware business.
Services, it was pretty clear, could be a huge revenue growth engine for
IBM.</p>
<p>However, the more we thought about the long-term implications of this
trend, an even more compelling motivation came into view. If customers
were going to look to an integrator to help them envision, design, and
build end-to-end solutions, then the companies playing that role would
exert tremendous influence over the full range of technology
decisions—from architecture and applications to hardware and software
choices.</p>
<p>This would be a historic shift in customer buying behavior. For the
first time, services companies, not technology firms, would be the tail
wagging the dog. Suddenly, a decision that seemed rational and
straightforward—pursue a growth opportunity—became a strategic
imperative for the entire company. That was our first big bet—to build
not just the largest but the most influential services business in the
industry.</p>
<p>A Networked Model</p>
<p>The second big bet we placed was that stand-alone computing would
give way to networks.</p>
<p>That may not sound like a very big or risky bet today. But, again,
this was in the context of the 1994 time frame, well before the Internet
became mainstream. The first rumblings of change were there. You could
find certain industries, particularly telecommunications, that were
buzzing about the “information superhighway,” a dazzling future of
high-speed broadband connections to the workplace, home, and school. If
this kind of “wired world” came about, it would change the way business
and society functioned.</p>
<p>It would also change the course of computing in profound ways. For
one thing, it was virtually certain that world would be built on open
industry standards. There would be no other way to fulfill the promise
of ubiquitous connections among all the businesses, users, devices, and
systems that would participate in a truly networked world. If that
standards-based world came to pass, it would represent a major shift in
the prevailing competitive landscape.</p>
<p>In any other industry, we assume the existence of common standards.
We take it for granted that unleaded gas will work in all
gasoline-powered cars. We don’t think about plugging in appliances or
screwing in lightbulbs or turning on faucets. Everything of this nature
works because the various manufacturers and service providers in those
industries agreed to common standards long ago.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, that’s not how things have worked in the IT
industry. Based on my experience, it was the only industry on earth
where suppliers built products to be compatible with their own gear but
not with anyone else’s. Once you bought one part of a manufacturer’s
product line, you were locked in to everything else they made. Imagine,
for example, buying a car and discovering you could purchase new tires,
spark plugs, filters, accessories, and even the gasoline only from that
car’s manufacturer.</p>
<p>Of course, I learned that this proprietary model was rooted in IBM’s
runaway success of the 1960s and 1970s. Other companies—most notably
Microsoft—later emulated and perfected this approach and then doggedly
refused to abandon it, for precisely the same reason that IBM initially
resisted the tug of the UNIX marketplace. Open computing represented a
gigantic competitive threat to any company whose business model depended
on its ability to control customers based on “choke points” in the
architecture.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by the 1980s there were pockets of radical thought
inside IBM that were already agitating for the company to join the open
movement. And by the mid-1990s, we’d mounted the massive technical and
cultural effort required to repudiate closed computing at IBM and open
up our products to interoperate with other industry-leading
platforms.</p>
<p>Then along came the networked world. If that interconnected,
standards-based world took hold, Microsoft would be the most vulnerable.
Its insatiable ambitions notwithstanding, not every piece of digital
equipment in the world could be part of one architecture, controlled by
one company.</p>
<p>Implications of a Post-PC World</p>
<p>There were further implications of a networked world. The PC would be
pushed off center stage. Very fast, high-bandwidth networks would allow
many of the PC’s functions to be performed by larger systems inside
companies and the network itself. This system would allow an untold
number of new kinds of devices to attach to networks—intelligent TVs,
game consoles, handheld devices, cell phones, even household appliances
and cars. The PC would be one—but only one—of many network access
devices. And if the world was going to be populated by billions of
different kinds of computing devices, there would be huge demand for
customized chips to power each of these unique devices.</p>
<p>More important for IBM, increasing numbers of people and enterprises
conducting business over networks would drive a corresponding increase
in computing workloads. The difficult task of managing all of that
free-flowing digital information certainly was not going to be done on
desktop computers. Those workloads would have to be handled by
large-scale systems—meaning huge demand for computing infrastructure
products, in addition to networking gear.</p>
<p>Finally, this new landscape would change who made technology buying
decisions. In a PC and client/server world, consumers, end-users, and
small-department heads were in the driver’s seat. But with the action
shifting back to enterprise systems and mainstream business strategies,
the decision makers would once again be chief technology officers and
senior business leaders—people IBM knew and understood.</p>
<p>All of this wasn’t so neat, tidy, and clear to us at the time. But
there were indications that the world of computing was indeed shifting
in ways that, at least in theory, played to IBM’s traditional strengths
and assets.</p>
<p>We would have to do an enormous amount of work and take significant
risks—from continuing to open up all our products, to building the
services business. But even the chance that the game might be thrown
open to a new set of leaders was powerfully motivating. We were going to
take our fate into our own hands. We were going to play offense.</p>
