<h4 id="creating-a-global-enterprise">8 Creating a Global
Enterprise</h4>
<p>What we had done thus far was to put out the fire. Now we needed to
rebuild the fundamental strategy of the company. That strategy, as I had
been saying for six months, was going to revolve around my belief that
the unique opportunity for IBM—our distinctive competence—was an ability
to integrate all the parts for our customers.</p>
<p>However, before I could integrate for our customers, I first had to
integrate IBM! So, as our strategy people worked on fleshing out short-
and long-term plans, I turned my attention to three areas that, if not
fundamentally changed, would disable any hope of a strategy built around
integration: organization, brand image, and compensation.</p>
<p>Remaking the Organization</p>
<p>IBM is arguably the most complex organization anywhere in the world
outside government. It is not just its sheer size (6 billion in 2001
sales), nor its far-flung reach (operating in 160-plus countries). What
drives IBM’s unique complexity is twofold. First, every institution and
almost every individual is an actual or potential customer of IBM. In my
previous occupations, we could always identify a dozen or so key
customers in one or two industries that really defined the marketplace.
Not so at IBM. We had to be prepared to serve every institution, every
industry, every type of government, large and small, around the
globe.</p>
<p>The second complexity factor is the rate and pace of the underlying
technology. Again, in prior incarnations, my management team and I could
identify four or five companies or organizations that had been our
competitors for the past twenty years and would probably continue to be
our competitors for the next twenty. In the information technology
industry, literally thousands of new competitors sprang up every
year—some in garages, some in universities, some in the hearts and minds
of brilliant entrepreneurs. Product cycles that used to run for ten
years dwindled to nine or ten months. New scientific discoveries
overwhelmed planning and economic assumptions on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that in the face of this large
global span and uniquely diverse set of customers and an ever-changing
technological base, organizing IBM was a constant challenge.</p>
<p>One other factor made it particularly interesting—the nature of the
IBM employee base. We are not a company of management and workers. We
are a company of 300,000-plus professionals, all of whom are bright,
inquisitive, and (alas) opinionated. Everybody had his or her view of
what the first priority should be and who should manage it.</p>
<p>As IBM grappled with this recipe for cacophony, the company evolved
over the years in two directions: powerful geographic units that dealt
with IBM’s global reach, and powerful product divisions that dealt with
the underlying technological forces. Missing from this structure was a
customer view. The geographic regions, for the most part, protected
their turf and attempted to own everything that went on in their region.
The technological divisions dealt with what they thought could be built,
or what they wanted to build, with little concern about customer needs
or priorities.</p>
<p>I had experienced this firsthand at American Express and was
determined to see it changed soon. There had been eleven different
currencies in which the American Express Card was issued when I arrived;
there were more than twenty-nine when I left. As we moved the Card
around the world, we needed common systems from IBM, our primary
information technology vendor, and we needed support in every major
country in the world.</p>
<p>I was always flabbergasted to find that when we arrived in a new
country (Malaysia or Singapore or Spain), we had to reestablish our
credentials with the local IBM management. The fact that American
Express was one of IBM’s largest customers in the United States bore no
value to IBM management in other countries. We had to start over each
time, and their focus was on their own country profit and loss, not on
any sense of IBM’s global relationship with American Express.</p>
<p>The same was true of products. Products used in the United States
were not necessarily available in other parts of the world. It was
enormously frustrating, but IBM seemed to be incapable of taking a
global customer view or a technology view driven by customer
requirements.</p>
<p>One of my first priorities was to shift the fundamental power bases
inside IBM. In the United States alone, there was a national
headquarters, eight regional headquarters, multiple area headquarters
under the regions, and, finally, local units called “trading areas.”
Each was run by a profit center boss who sought aggressively to increase
his or her own resources and profits. Say a banking client in Atlanta
wanted a solution involving retail banking. Never mind that the best
banking experts were in New York City or Chicago. The local boss would
often ignore those resources and use his or her own people. (One day I
looked at the financial newswires and was shocked to see that IBM’s
trading area for Alabama and Mississippi had sent to the media its own
earnings news release.)</p>
<p>Staff units abounded at every level. Outside the United States, the
structure was even more rigid, like in Europe, with its 23,000 support
people. Other IBMers practically had to ask permission to enter the
territory of a country manager. Each country had its own independent
system. In Europe alone we had 142 different financial systems. Customer
data could not be tracked across the company. Employees belonged to
their geography first, while IBM took a distant second place.</p>
<p>Breaking Up the Fiefdoms</p>
<p>I declared war on the geographic fiefdoms. I decided we would
organize the company around global industry teams. I had first
encountered the power of this kind of structure when I had been a very
young consultant at McKinsey. We’d conducted a seminal organization
study for what was then Citibank. The result was to transform Citibank
from a geographical organization to a global, customer-oriented
organization, and it became the model for most financial institutions
over the next decade.</p>
<p>With this model in mind, I asked Ned Lautenbach, then head of all
non-United States sales organizations, to build a customer-oriented
organization. It was a painful and sometimes tumultuous process to get
the organization to embrace this new direction, but by mid-1995 we were
ready to implement it. We broke our customer base into twelve groups:
eleven industries (such as banking, government, insurance, distribution,
and manufacturing) and a final category covering small- and medium-size
businesses. We assigned all of the accounts to these industry groups and
announced that the groups would be in charge of all budgets and
personnel. The response from the country managers was swift and
predictable: “It will never work.” And: “You will destroy the
company!”</p>
<p>I’ll never forget one run-in with the head of the powerful Europe,
Middle East, and Africa unit. During a visit to Europe I discovered, by
accident, that European employees were not receiving all of my
company-wide e-mails. After some investigation, we found that the head
of Europe was intercepting messages at the central messaging node. When
asked why, he replied simply, “These messages were inappropriate for my
employees.” And: “They were hard to translate.”</p>
<p>I summoned him to Armonk the next day. I explained that he had no
employees, that all employees belonged to IBM, and that from that day on
he would never interfere with messages sent from my office. He grimaced,
nodded, and sulked as he walked out the door. He never did adapt to the
new global organization, and a few months later he left the company.</p>
<p>Although we implemented the new industry structure in mid-1995, it
was never fully accepted until at least three years later. Regional
heads clung to the old system, sometimes out of mutiny, but more often
out of tradition.</p>
<p>We needed to do a massive shift of resources, systems, and processes
to make the new system work. Building an organizational plan was easy.
It took three years of hard work to implement the plan, and implement it
well.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget one particularly stubborn—and inventive—country
general manager in Europe. He simply refused to recognize that the vast
majority of the people in his country had been reassigned to specialized
units reporting to global leaders.</p>
<p>Anytime one of these new worldwide leaders would pay a visit to meet
with his or her new team, the country general manager, or GM, would
round up a group loyal to the GM, herd them into a room, and tell them,
“Okay, today you’re database specialists. Go talk about databases.” Or
for the next visit: “Today you’re experts on the insurance industry.” We
eventually caught on and ended the charade.</p>
