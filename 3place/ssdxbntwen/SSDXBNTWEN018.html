<h4 id="services-the-key-to-integration">14 Services-the Key to
Integration</h4>
<p>Some people might have been surprised to read in the previous chapter
that IBM placed a big bet on services. I mean, hasn’t IBM always been
known for its doting customer support? Wasn’t superior customer service
one of IBM’s cornerstone beliefs? Wasn’t IBM revered for standing by its
customers no matter what happened, at any hour of the day or night?</p>
<p>As a customer, I always valued IBM’s attentive service. It made up
for certain IBM products that weren’t quite as powerful or
cost-effective as others on the market, and it (almost) justified IBM’s
very high prices.</p>
<p>But that is not the kind of services I’m talking about here. The big
bet we made was on another kind of services—services that would address
customer needs that frankly didn’t exist during the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s, prior to the Big Bang of rampant industry disaggregation.
Traditionally, IBM’s services were completely tied to products—more
specifically, products bearing IBM logos. If an IBM system went down,
IBM fixed it. However, if customers had a problem with a product from
Digital, Compaq, or Amdahl, or if they wanted help installing some other
company’s equipment, they had to fend for themselves. Services was an
adjunct to the main product business.</p>
<p>Enter Dennie Welsh. As with all things in life, luck plays a big
part. I got lucky twice at IBM. The first time was at a meeting in 1993
with Dennie, a long-term IBMer, who was running the services
organization. The second time was the arrival of the Internet and the
big bet we made on the networked world. Coincidentally, Dennie had a
strong hand in that, too (more on that later).</p>
<p>When I arrived at IBM, Dennie was running a wholly owned IBM
subsidiary named the Integrated Systems Services Corporation. ISSC was
our services and network operations unit in the United States—a
promising but minor part of IBM’s portfolio. In fact, it wasn’t even a
stand-alone business in IBM. It was a sub-unit of the sales force.</p>
<p>No one forgets a meeting with Dennie. He’s a big man, friendly, quick
to laugh, but intense. He was a former army pilot and air defense
officer who’d made his IBM career in the unit that built highly
technical systems for United States government projects, including the
Apollo moon program. He was in the control room at Cape Kennedy for Neil
Armstrong’s historic Apollo XI launch to the moon.</p>
<p>It was our first private meeting, but he didn’t waste much time on
small talk. He told me that his vision of a services company was not one
that did just IBM product maintenance and strung together computer codes
for customers. He envisioned a company that would literally take over
and act on behalf of the customers in all aspects of information
technology—from building systems to defining architectures to actually
managing the computers and running them for the customers.</p>
<p>My mind was afire. Not only was he describing something I’d wanted
when I was a customer (for example, I had tried unsuccessfully to
outsource the running of RJR Nabisco’s data centers), but this idea
meshed exactly with our strategy of integration. Here was a man who
understood what customers were willing to spend money on, and he knew
what that meant—not just the business potential for IBM, but the coming
restructuring of the industry around solutions rather than piece
parts.</p>
<p>However, Dennie pointed out, this system was not going to be easy to
implement inside the IBM culture. To be truly successful, we would have
to do things that would shake the place to its roots. For example, the
services unit would need to be able to recommend the products of
Microsoft, HP, Sun, and all other major IBM competitors if that, in
fact, was the best solution for the customer. Of course, we’d have to
maintain and service these products as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, Dennie believed the services unit would have to be
separated from the regular sales force, because our sales force would
never permit an IBM services person inside their account if there was
any chance that the services rep would sell anything other than IBM
products.</p>
<p>Finally he pointed out that the economics of a services business were
very different from those of a product-based business. A major services
contract might last six to twelve years. An outsourcing contract for,
say, seven years might lose money in the first year. All of this was
foreign to the traditional world of product sales and would create
problems for our sales compensation system and the financial management
system.</p>
<p>I left my session with Dennie both thrilled and depressed (a state of
confusion I experienced often in my early days at IBM). I was thrilled
that I had discovered a base from which we could build the integration
capability our customers so desperately needed—and, in so doing, provide
the raison d’être for keeping IBM together. I was depressed to realize
that despite the powerful logic—that this services-led model was IBM’s
unique competitive advantage—the culture of IBM would fight it.</p>
<p>Thus began another major challenge: establishing this powerful new
business, and at the same time integrating this unit into IBM so that it
was viewed, not as a threat, but as a great new ally of our traditional
product units.</p>
<p>I knew this was going to be an exquisitely difficult trick to pull
off. My experience in prior jobs told me that intense rivalries between
units of a large company were a prevalent behavior pattern. The units
that had been the traditional base of a company more often than not
resisted (overtly or silently) the emergence of a new sibling—either
homegrown or an arrival through acquisition.</p>
<p>Building the Organization</p>
<p>Despite Dennie’s view that his unit should be a stand-alone business,
not a subset of the sales team, I did not break it out initially.
Rather, I spent countless hours working with our teams to develop a
sense of mutual dependence between the services and sales people.
Services people had to learn that the sales team could get them in the
door. The sales people had to realize that services specialists could
develop major new avenues of revenue in their accounts.</p>
<p>Still, there were fireworks. Throughout those critical early days, it
seemed there was a crisis a week between services and some other IBM
unit. Many of our brand executives or sales leaders went ballistic every
time the services unit proposed a product solution that incorporated a
competitor’s product. On more than one occasion I found one of these
people in my office, railing against the renegades from services. My
answer was always the same: “You need to invest the resources necessary
to work with the services team to ensure they understand the competitive
advantages of your products. View them as a distribution channel for
your products. Your competitors do!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile we started to pull the services units together on a global
basis. As I said, Dennie ran just a United States services unit. There
were dozens of other such services organizations spread all over the
world. They had totally different processes, pricing, offerings, terms,
and brand names. I asked Dennie to create a unified organization—still
under the wing of the sales force—and introduce outsourcing and network
services globally. This was a Herculean task—common problem solving,
methodologies, nomenclatures, skill definitions, capturing and
disseminating knowledge on a global basis, and hiring and training
thousands of new people every year.</p>
<p>By 1996 I was ready to break the services unit out as a separate
business. We formed IBM Global Services. The change was still traumatic
for some of our managers, but it was eventually accepted as inevitable
by most of our colleagues.</p>
<p>Had the effort to build IBM Global Services failed, IBM—or at least
my vision of IBM—would have failed with it. In 1992 services was a .4
billion business at IBM (excluding maintenance). In 2001 it had risen to
a 0 billion business and accounted for roughly half of our workforce. I
would guess there are few companies that have ever grown a
multibillion-dollar business at this pace.</p>
<p>There were several reasons customers were pouring so much investment
into services. First, skilled IT professionals were in such short supply
that millions of IT jobs went unfilled. Customers simply couldn’t staff
up to do what needed to be done. But the main reason came back to what
Dennie and I had discussed at that first meeting: customers’
overpowering desire for someone to provide integration. At first that
was just the integration of technologies. But as the networked computing
model took hold, it created whole new dimensions around integration,
forcing customers to integrate technologies with core business
processes, and then to integrate processes—like pricing, fulfillment, or
logistics—with one another.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Bet</p>
<p>When I say that we made a big bet on services, let me describe what
we gambled.</p>
<p>I have worked in services companies (McKinsey and American Express)
and product companies (RJR Nabisco and IBM). I will state unequivocally
that services businesses are much more difficult to manage.</p>
<p>The skills required in managing services processes are very different
from those that drive successful product companies. We had no experience
building a labor-based business inside an asset-intensive company. We
were expert at managing factories and developing technologies. We
understood cost of goods and inventory turns and manufacturing. But a
human-intensive services business is entirely different. In services you
don’t make a product and then sell it. You sell a capability. You sell
knowledge. You create it at the same time you deliver it. The business
model is different. The economics are entirely different.</p>
<p>Think for a moment about just the outsourcing business. What you’re
telling the customer is: “Transfer your IT assets—products, facilities,
plus the staff—onto my books. I’ll absorb it all, manage it, guarantee
performance levels, and promise that you’ll always be on or close to the
leading edge of technology. All that, and I’ll charge you less than it’s
costing you now.”</p>
<p>At the same time, you’re telling yourself: “I can do all that and
still make a profit.”</p>
<p>That’s a bet on a couple of things, starting with your willingness to
use your balance sheet. You can’t get into that kind of business without
making the commitment to carry the infrastructure and loss until a
contract that could extend over five or ten years becomes profitable.
There’s no such thing as a toe in the water. When you take this plunge,
it’s full-body immersion.</p>
<p>It’s a bet on your ability to drive economies of scale—to consolidate
lots of customer data centers into megaplexes (what the industry calls
“server farms”) or the ability to do with 750 people what two or three
customers once did with 1,000.</p>
<p>We had to bet that we could build the recruitment, training,
compensation, and HR processes to bring in 1,000 or more people a
month—even though we’d never attempted anything remotely close to that.
In fact, in the mid- to late 1990s, when services was consistently
growing 20-plus-percent a quarter, we knew we could do even better if we
had more people. But we capped our hiring at about these levels simply
because we thought we’d overextend our ability to hire and train
qualified people.</p>
<p>Finally, we had to learn how to be disciplined—how to negotiate
profitable contracts, price our skills, assess risk, and walk away from
bad contracts and bad deals.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, I’ve said repeatedly that this is the kind
of capability you can’t simply acquire (though our competitors keep
trying). The bet you’re really making is on your own commitment to
invest both the years and the capital, then build the experience and
discipline it takes to succeed.</p>
<p>The Future</p>
<p>As I write this chapter in the spring of 2002, the IBM services
business is suffering the same slowdown affecting most of the high-tech
sector. I am confident this performance slump is temporary because I
have never seen a business with such an astounding capacity for
self-renewal. Every time the industry moves in a new direction, the IT
services opportunity is reinvented. Even in an economic downturn, many
services—outsourcing is the leading example—hold strong appeal as
customers look for ways to reduce expenses.</p>
<p>When IBM made its commitment to services, we were playing a bit of a
hunch. Today, when I make the statement that this industry, and our
company, will be services-led for the foreseeable future, that’s no
hunch. Since the financial restructuring of IBM began in 1993, services
generated roughly 80 percent of all the company’s revenue growth—more
than 0 billion of the 5 billion total through 2001.</p>
<p>I can’t finish a chapter on the IBM services business without making
one additional comment. Early on, when Dennie Welsh was first building
his services unit, he went to my predecessor and told him he had to have
IBM’s number-one sales leader, a person with stature and charisma, a
deal-closer extraordinaire. Sam Palmisano, the man who eventually
succeeded me as CEO, was running part of IBM’s Asian operations at the
time. He got the call and became president of ISSC. Not only did Sam
take the business to another level, but he was a strong role model for
many executives who needed to understand that a significant part of our
future was in services.</p>
