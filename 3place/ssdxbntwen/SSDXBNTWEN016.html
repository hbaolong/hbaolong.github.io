<h4 id="a-brief-history-of-ibm">12 A Brief History of IBM</h4>
<p>Before we talk about how the new IBM was built, I think it would be
helpful to understand, in broad brush strokes, how IBM became the great
company most of us revered up until the early 1990s, and what
contributed, at least in my view, to its breathtaking decline.</p>
<p>The company’s origins go back to the early twentieth century, when
Thomas J. Watson, Sr., combined several small companies to form the
International Business Machines Corporation. For the first half of the
century, IBM’s “business machines” embraced a broad and largely
unrelated lineup of commercial products; everything from scales and
cheese slicers to clocks and typewriters. Of prime importance was the
fact that IBM was a pioneer in computation long before most people
talked about computers. The company’s early electromechanical tabulation
and punch-card devices introduced computation to business, academia, and
government. For example, IBM scored a huge win when it was selected by
the United States federal government to help start up and automate the
Social Security System in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Inventing the Mainframe</p>
<p>Like Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie, Thomas
Watson was a powerful, patriarchal leader who left an imprint on every
aspect of his company. His personal philosophies and values—hard work,
decent working conditions, fairness, honesty, respect, impeccable
customer service, jobs for life—defined the IBM culture. The paternalism
engendered by Watson would come to be both an asset and, long past his
lifetime, a challenge for the company. However, there’s no question that
it made IBM highly appealing to a post-depression labor force yearning
for job security and a fair deal.</p>
<p>The history that is much more relevant to IBM’s turnaround begins
with Tom Watson, Jr., who succeeded his father as CEO in 1956 and who
boldly brought IBM—and the world—into the digital computer age.</p>
<p>Much has been written about this period and how Tom “bet the company”
on a revolutionary new product line called the System/360—the original
name of IBM’s wildly successful mainframe family.</p>
<p>To grasp what System/360 did for IBM and its effect on the computing
landscape, one needs to look no further than Microsoft, its Windows
operating system, and the PC revolution. System/360 was the Windows of
its era—an era that IBM led for nearly three decades. In fact, the
comparison between the IBM of the 1960s and 1970s and the Microsoft of
the 1980s and 1990s is most appropriate. Both companies seized upon
major technology shifts and brought to market an entirely new capability
for customers. Both established commanding market positions and
benefited greatly from that leadership.</p>
<p>In IBM’s case, the big technology shift came with the advent of the
integrated circuit—what we now know as the semiconductor chip. Of
course, IBM did not invent the integrated circuit (not any more than
Microsoft invented the personal computer!), but Watson and his
colleagues understood its significance. Before the integrated circuit,
computers were giant, room-size machines, energy inefficient, highly
unreliable, and costly to manufacture. Many of these problems could be
solved by high-density integrated circuits. Instead of building
computers with scores of specialized components, these functions could
be miniaturized and packed onto chips.</p>
<p>The new capability that IBM brought to market was the first family of
fully compatible computers and peripheral devices. While this hardly
sounds revolutionary today, years ago it was a radical concept. Before
System/360, IBM was just one of several companies that made and sold
computers.</p>
<p>Each company’s computers were based on proprietary technology. They
didn’t work with any other computers, even from the same company, and
each computer system had its own peripheral devices like printers and
tape drives. This meant that if customers outgrew a computer or wanted
the advantages of some new technology, they had to discard all of their
hardware and software investments and start over. In today’s parlance,
they had to “rip and replace” everything.</p>
<p>System/360 represented an entirely new approach. First of all, it
would be built with modern, high-performance integrated circuits. This
would make the machines simultaneously more powerful, more reliable, and
less costly than anything on the market. It would consist of a family of
computers—from very small to very large processors—so that customers
could make easy upgrades as their needs grew. Software developed for one
processor would run on any System/360 processor. All peripheral
devices—printers, tape drives, punch-card readers—would work with any
processor in the family. For customers, System/360 would be a godsend.
For IBM’s competitors, it would be a knockout blow.</p>
<p>Of course, envisioning System/360 was one thing. Making it a reality
required the equivalent of a man-on-the-moon program. It cost nearly as
much. Tom Watson’s memoir noted that the investment required— billion
(that’s 1960s dollars!)—was larger than what the Manhattan Project
cost.</p>
<p>Growing Around the Mainframe</p>
<p>Aside from the risk and sheer size of the undertaking, System/360
forced IBM to launch itself into a whole new set of businesses and to
develop entirely new sets of skills and capabilities—all of which, in
one form or another, still existed by the time I arrived.</p>
<p>IBM had to get into the semiconductor business. Why? Because there
was no semiconductor industry yet. IBM had to invest heavily in research
and development to create entirely new technologies required for
System/360. It’s not accidental that this was one of the most
progressive periods for IBM research. During this era, IBM scientists
and engineers invented the memory chip, the relational database,
computer languages such as FORTRAN, and made huge advances in materials
science, chip lithography, and magnetic recording.</p>
<p>How did we end up in 1990 with the world’s largest software business?
Because there would be no usable System/360 without an operating system,
or a database, or a transaction processing system, or software tools and
programming languages.</p>
<p>Even the sales force had to change. System/360 required a very
knowledgeable, consultative sales force that could help customers
transform important business processes like accounting, payroll, and
inventory management. Traditional order takers couldn’t do this job. The
company had to create a product service and maintenance capability and a
customer-training and educational arm.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all of this—hardware, software, sales, services—was
dedicated and tied to System/360. Despite the fact that IBM, then and
now, was regarded as a complex company with thousands of products, I’d
argue that, until the mid-1980s, IBM was a one-product company—a
mainframe company—with an array of multibillion-dollar businesses
attached to that single franchise.</p>
<p>And the franchise was a gold mine. IBM’s share of the computing
market skyrocketed. Competitors reeled; many disappeared. The company’s
revenues grew at a compound growth rate of 14 percent from 1965 to 1985.
Gross profit margins were amazing—consistently around 60 percent. Market
share exceeded an astounding 30 percent, which eventually invited
antitrust scrutiny.</p>
<p>How the Culture Evolved</p>
<p>This decades-long run of uninterrupted success ties in with the other
closely related, and vitally important, aspect of IBM’s recent history.
This is about its corporate culture—specifically, the kind of culture
that arises in an environment without intense competitive pressure or
threats. In IBM’s case, I never believed the problem was as simple as
complacency or entitlement, though there were elements of both present
when I arrived. It wasn’t about tens of thousands of people growing
soft, risk-averse, and slow, though that’s been a convenient way to
characterize the IBM of the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The IBM culture was the product of two predominant forces. One we’ve
just discussed in detail—the runaway success of the System/360. When
there’s little competitive threat, when high profit margins and a
commanding market position are assumed, then the economic and market
forces that other companies have to live or die by simply don’t apply.
In that environment, what would you expect to happen? The company and
its people lose touch with external realities, because what’s happening
in the marketplace is essentially irrelevant to the success of the
company.</p>
<p>What IBM forgot was that all the trappings of its culture—from
behaviors that the company valued and rewarded, to how fast things
happened, to the luxury of creating all kinds of pride-inducing employee
benefits and programs—were a function of the franchise created by the
System/360. It wasn’t really the product of enlightened management or
world-class processes. IBM’s dominant position had created a
self-contained, self-sustaining world for the company. IBM had ridden
one horse, and ridden it well. But that horse could carry it only so far
before it broke down.</p>
<p>The other critical factor—one that is sometimes overlooked—is the
impact of the antitrust suit filed against IBM by the United States
Department of Justice on January 31, 1969, the final day of the Lyndon
B. Johnson administration. The suit was ultimately dropped and
classified “without merit” during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, but for
thirteen years IBM lived under the specter of a federally mandated
breakup. One has to imagine that years of that form of scrutiny changes
business behavior in very real ways.</p>
<p>Just consider the effect on vocabulary—an important element of any
culture, including corporate culture. While IBM was subject to the suit,
terms like “market,” “marketplace,” “market share,” “competitor,”
“competition,” “dominate,” “lead,” “win,” and “beat” were systematically
excised from written materials and banned at internal meetings. Imagine
the dampening effect on a workforce that can’t even talk about selecting
a market or taking share from a competitor. After a while, it goes
beyond what is said to what is thought.</p>
<p>Was the antitrust suit “the” pivotal event that caused the culture of
IBM to break down? No. But did it contribute? Some of my long-term IBM
colleagues believe it did. And if timing is everything, as the adage
says, IBM’s was lousy. At virtually the same time that the suit was
finally lifted in the early 1980s (and after years of having the
fighting spirit drained from the company gene pool), the industry’s
“next big thing” arrived. Whether the company fully understood it at the
time, the downward spiral was about to begin.</p>
<p>The Next Big Thing</p>
<p>That next big thing wasn’t the advent of personal computing, which is
the popular view. The more imminent threat to the mainframe model
started with the rise of UNIX, an “open” operating environment
championed by companies like Sun and HP. UNIX offered customers the
first viable, economically attractive alternative to IBM’s mainframe
products and pricing.</p>
<p>In the open, plug-and-play world of UNIX, many, many companies could
make parts of an overall solution—shattering IBM’s hold on architectural
control. Almost overnight IBM was under attack by an army of the
so-called “pure play” companies like Sun, HP, SGI, Digital, and all the
makers of associated software and peripheral products.</p>
<p>Once you understand that, you begin to comprehend John Akers’s big
bet on a loosely knit confederation of “Baby Blues.” He recognized that
the vertically integrated industry was ending, and he believed this
shift would ultimately take down his vertically integrated company. He
was disaggregating IBM in order to embrace what he thought the new
industry model was going to be. As I described earlier, I didn’t agree
with that path and reversed that direction. But I can understand the
thinking behind it.</p>
<p>After UNIX cracked the foundation, the PC makers came along swinging
wrecking balls. While it’s a gross oversimplification to say that IBM’s
biggest problems stemmed from the failure to lead in PCs, it’s clear
that the company failed to understand fully two things about personal
computing:</p>
<p>PCs would eventually be used by businesses and enterprises, not just
by hobbyists and students. Because of that, we failed to size up the
market properly and did not make it a high corporate priority.</p>
<p>Because we did not think PCs would ever challenge IBM’s core
enterprise computing franchise, we surrendered control of the PC’s
highest-value components: the operating system to Microsoft, and the
microprocessor to Intel. By the time I arrived at IBM, those two
companies had ridden this gift from IBM right to the top of the
industry.</p>
