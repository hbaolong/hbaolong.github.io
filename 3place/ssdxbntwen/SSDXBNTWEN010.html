<h4 id="stop-the-bleeding">6 Stop the Bleeding</h4>
<p>(and Hold the Vision)</p>
<p>By July 1993, the pressure to act—and to act in a comprehensive
manner—was acute. The financials were ominous. Employees wanted their
new leader to do something, anything, to give them a sense of direction.
The media, typically, were losing patience (not that I’ve ever felt the
media had any particularly noteworthy insights into what was going on in
IBM, but given the fragility of the company at that time, their stories,
right or wrong, could have had a devastating impact on customer
attitudes).</p>
<p>On July 14, USA Today celebrated my one hundredth day on the job in a
long cover story. This was the story’s lead:</p>
<p>IBM stockholders and customers might have hoped for miracles in Louis
Gerstner’s first 100 days as IBM’S CEO. But that honeymoon period ended
Friday—with no major organizational overhauls or strategic moves.</p>
<p>“Clearly he is not a miracle worker,” computer analyst Ulric Weil
says.</p>
<p>IBM stock, down 6% since Gerstner took over, “has done nothing
because he’s done nothing,” says computer analyst David Wu at S. G.
Warburg.</p>
<p>Although I thought I had already done a lot, it was clearly time to
make some major decisions and go public with them. And after all the
customer and employee and industry meetings, as well as weekend and air
travel reflection, I was indeed ready to make four critical
decisions:</p>
<p>Keep the company together.</p>
<p>Change our fundamental economic model.</p>
<p>Reengineer how we did business.</p>
<p>Sell underproductive assets in order to raise cash.</p>
<p>And, I decided I would not disclose any of the other strategic
initiatives that were forming in my head during the summer of 1993.</p>
<p>Keep the Company Together</p>
<p>I can’t tell you exactly when I decided to keep IBM together, nor do
I remember a formal announcement. I had always talked about our size and
breadth as a distinct competitive advantage. However, I do know that it
wasn’t a particularly difficult decision for me. Here’s why.</p>
<p>When the computer industry first appeared on the world’s stage, its
model was to deliver to customers a total, integrated package. When a
company bought a computer, it came with all the basic technologies, like
microprocessors and storage, incorporated into a system; all the
software loaded onto the hardware; all the services to install and
maintain the system were bundled into the pricing. The customer
basically purchased a total system and had it installed for a single
price. This was the model created by IBM, and over time, only a handful
of computer competitors, all fully integrated, emerged in the United
States (often described as the BUNCH—Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell). The same model emerged in Japan and, to a lesser
extent, in Europe.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s a new model started to appear. It argued that
vertical integration was no longer the way to go. The new breed of
successful information technology companies would provide a narrow,
horizontal slice of the total package. So companies that sold only
databases began to emerge, as well as companies that sold only operating
systems, that sold only storage devices, and so on. Suddenly the
industry went from a handful of competitors to thousands and then tens
of thousands, many of which sold a single, tiny piece of a computer
solution.</p>
<p>It was in this new environment that IBM faltered, and so it was
logical for many of the visionaries and pundits, both inside and outside
the company, to argue that the solution lay in splitting IBM into
individual segments. This conclusion, however, appeared to me to be a
knee-jerk reaction to what new competitors were doing without
understanding what created fragmentation in the industry.</p>
<p>Two things really drove the customer to support this new, fragmented
supplier environment:</p>
<p>Customers wanted to break IBM’s grip on the economics of the
industry—to rip apart IBM’s pricing umbrella, which allowed it to bundle
prices and achieve significantly high margins.</p>
<p>The customer was increasingly interested in delivering computing
power to individual employees (the term was “distributed computing,” in
contrast to the mainframe’s “centralized computing”).</p>
<p>IBM was slow, very slow, in delivering distributed computing, and
many small companies moved in to fill the gap. These companies were in
no position to deliver an entire integrated solution, so they offered
add-ons to the basic IBM system and built around IBM’s central
processing hub. This is clearly what Microsoft and Intel did when IBM
reluctantly moved into the PC business.</p>
<p>So it really wasn’t that the customer desired a whole bunch of
fragmented suppliers. The broad objective was to bring more competition
into the marketplace and to seek suppliers for a new model of
computing.</p>
<p>And it worked. By the early 1990s there were tens of thousands of
companies in the computer industry, many of which lived for a few months
or years, then disappeared. But the impact of all this dynamism was
lower prices and more choices (with the notable exception of the PC
industry, where Microsoft re-created the IBM choke hold, only this time
around it was in the desktop operating environment rather than in the
mainframe computer).</p>
<p>While there were good consequences to this fundamental reshaping of
the computer industry, there was also one very undesirable outcome. The
customer now had to be the integrator of the technology into a usable
solution to meet his or her business requirements. Before, there was a
general contractor called IBM or Burroughs or Honeywell. Now, in the new
industry structure, the burden was on the customer to make everything
work together.</p>
<p>This was all complicated by the absence of uniform standards
throughout the computer industry. Competitors in the computer industry,
unlike any other industry I know, try to create unique standards that
they “own.” They do not make it easy for other companies in the industry
to connect with or understand these standards without extracting a huge
price. Thus, there is a cacophony of standards and interconnect
requirements that makes the creation of a single solution very
difficult. (I’ll discuss this in more detail later.)</p>
<p>As a big customer of the information technology industry in the early
1990s, I knew firsthand that integration was becoming a gigantic
problem. At American Express, our wallet-sized piece of plastic was
going to be moving data all over the world, a fact which brought with it
enormous technical challenges. All I wanted was an information
technology platform, and a partner, that would allow me to run that
business the way I wanted it to run. So when I arrived at IBM in 1993, I
believed there was a very important role for some company to be able to
integrate all of the pieces and deliver a working solution to the
customer.</p>
<p>Why? Because at the end of the day, in every industry there’s an
integrator. Sure, there are supply chains, and there are enterprises at
various points in the chain that offer only one piece of a finished
product: steelmakers in the auto industry; component makers in consumer
electronics; or providers of a marketing or tax application in financial
services. But before the components reach the consumer, somebody has to
sit at the end of the line and bring it all together in a way that
creates value. In effect, he or she takes responsibility for translating
the pieces into value. I believed that if IBM was uniquely positioned to
do or to be anything, it was to be that company.</p>
<p>Another myth that was playing out at the time was that the
information technology (IT) industry was going to continue to evolve—or
devolve—toward totally distributed computing. Everything was going to
get more local, more self-contained, smaller and cheaper until the point
at which all the information in the world would be running on somebody’s
wristwatch. A lot of people had bought into the value of information
democratization extended to its extreme, and they accepted the
industry’s promise that all the piece parts would work together, or, in
the industry’s term, “interoperate.”</p>
<p>But even before I had crossed the threshold at IBM, I knew that
promise was empty. I’d spent too long a time on the other side. The idea
that all this complicated, difficult-to-integrate, proprietary
collection of technologies was going to be purchased by customers who
would be willing to be their own general contractors made no sense.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in 1993 IBM was rocketing down a path that would have
made it a virtual mirror image of the rest of the industry. The company
was being splintered—you could say it was being destroyed.</p>
<p>Now, I must tell you, I am not sure that in 1993 I or anyone else
would have started out to create an IBM. But, given IBM’s scale and
broad-based capabilities, and the trajectories of the information
technology industry, it would have been insane to destroy its unique
competitive advantage and turn IBM into a group of individual component
suppliers—more minnows in an ocean.</p>
<p>In the big April customer meeting at Chantilly and in my other
customer meetings, CIOs made it very clear that the last thing in the
world they needed was one more disk drive company, one more operating
system company, one more PC company. They also made it clear that our
ability to execute against an integrator strategy was nearly bankrupt
and that much had to be done before IBM could provide a kind of value
that we were not providing at the time—but which they believed only IBM
had a shot at delivering: genuine problem solving, the ability to apply
complex technologies to solve business challenges, and integration.</p>
<p>So keeping IBM together was the first strategic decision, and, I
believe, the most important decision I ever made—not just at IBM, but in
my entire business career. I didn’t know then exactly how we were going
to deliver on the potential of that unified enterprise, but I knew that
if IBM could serve as the foremost integrator of technologies, we’d be
delivering extraordinary value.</p>
<p>As a result, we threw out the investment bankers who were arranging
IPOs of all the pieces of the enterprise. We threw out the accountants
who were creating official financial statements required in order to
sell off the individual components. We threw out the naming consultants
who had decided that the printer division should be called “Pennant” and
the storage division “AdStar.”</p>
<p>We stopped all the internal activities that were creating separate
business processes and systems for each of these units, all of which
were enormous drains of energy and money. For example, even in the midst
of financial chaos, we had managed to hire more than seventy different
advertising agencies in the United States alone (more on this later).
Human resources people were willy-nilly changing benefits programs so
that if an employee left one IBM business unit for another, it was like
entering another country, with different language, currency, and
customs.</p>
<p>I began telling customers and employees that IBM would remain one
unified enterprise. I remember that the response from our executive team
was mixed—great joy from those who saw the company as being saved, and
bitter disappointment from those who saw a breaking apart as their
personal lifeboat to get off the Titanic.</p>
<p>Changing Our Economic Model</p>
<p>The second major decision that summer was to restructure IBM’s
fundamental economics. At the risk of sounding pompously tutorial, a
profit-making business is a relatively simple system. You need to
generate revenue, which comes from selling things at an acceptable
price. You have to achieve a good gross profit on those sales. And you
have to manage your expenses, which are the investments you make in
selling, research and development, building plants and equipment,
maintaining financial controls, developing and running advertising, and
so on. If revenue, gross profit, and expenses are all moving in the
right relationship, the net effect is growing profits and positive cash
flow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in IBM’s case the relationships were all wrong.
Revenue was slowing because the company was so dependent on the
mainframe, and mainframe sales were declining. Gross profit margin was
sinking like a stone because we had to reduce mainframe prices in order
to compete. The only way to stabilize the ship was to ensure that
expenses were going down faster than the decline in gross profit.</p>
<p>Expenses were a major problem. After months of hard work, CFO Jerry
York and his team determined that IBM’s expense-to-revenue ratio—i.e.,
how much expense is required to produce a dollar of revenue—was wildly
out of range with those of our competitors. On average, our competitors
were spending 31 cents to produce of revenue, while we were spending 42
cents for the same end. When we multiplied this inefficiency times the
total revenue of the company, we discovered that we had a billion
expense problem!</p>
<p>Since the repositioning of the mainframe was a long-term challenge
and we had to reduce mainframe prices and thus our gross profit, the
only way to save the company, at least in the short term, was to slash
uncompetitive levels of expenses.</p>
<p>So we made the decision to launch a massive program of expense
reduction—.9 billion in total. Unfortunately, this necessitated, among
other things, reducing our employment by 35,000 people, in addition to
the 45,000 people whom John Akers had already laid off in 1992. That
meant additional pain for everyone, but this was a matter of survival,
not choice.</p>
<p>Reengineer How We Did Business</p>
<p>These early expense cuts were necessary to keep the company alive,
but I knew they were far from sufficient to create a vibrant, ongoing,
successful enterprise. We needed fundamental change in the way we
carried out almost every process at IBM. All of our business processes
were cumbersome and highly expensive. So in 1993 we began what
ultimately became one of the largest, if not the largest, reengineering
projects ever undertaken by a multinational corporation. It would last a
decade and, as it unfolded, change almost every management process
inside IBM.</p>
<p>Reengineering is difficult, boring, and painful. One of my senior
executives at the time said: “Reengineering is like starting a fire on
your head and putting it out with a hammer.” But IBM truly needed a
top-to-bottom overhaul of its basic business operations.</p>
<p>Jerry York led the effort. By addressing some of the obvious
excesses, he had already cut .8 billion from our expenses that year
alone. Beyond the obvious, however, the overall task was enormous and
daunting. We were bloated. We were inefficient. We had piled redundancy
on top of redundancy.</p>
<p>We were running inventory systems, accounting systems, fulfillment
systems, and distribution systems that were all, to a greater or lesser
degree, the mutant offspring of systems built in the early mainframe
days and then adapted and patched together to fit the needs of one of
twenty-four independent business units. Today IBM has one Chief
Information Officer. Back then we had, by actual count, 128 people with
CIO in their titles—all of them managing their own local systems
architectures and funding home-grown applications.</p>
<p>The result was the business equivalent of the railroad systems of the
nineteenth century—different tracks, different gauges, different
specifications for the rolling stock. If we had a financial issue that
required the cooperation of several business units to resolve, we had no
common way of talking about it because we were maintaining 266 different
general ledger systems. At one time our HR systems were so rigid that
you actually had to be fired by one division to be employed by
another.</p>
<p>Rather than approach our reengineering sequentially, we attacked the
entire organization at once. At any given time, more than sixty major
reengineering projects were under way—and hundreds more among individual
units and divisions.</p>
<p>Most of the work centered on eleven areas. The first six we called
the core initiatives, meaning those parts of the business that dealt
most with the outside world: hardware development, software development
(later, these two units were combined into integrated product
development), fulfillment, integrated supply chain, customer
relationship management, and services.</p>
<p>The rest focused on internal processes, called enabling initiatives:
human resources, procurement, finance, real estate, and surprisingly—at
least at first glance—information technology.</p>
<p>When I’d arrived at IBM, I wasn’t taking too much for granted, but I
did expect I’d find the best internal IT systems in the world. This
might have been my greatest shock. We were spending billion a year on
this line item alone, yet we didn’t have the basic information we needed
to run our business. The systems were antiquated and couldn’t
communicate with one another. We had hundreds of data centers and
networks scattered around the world; many of them were largely dormant
or being used inefficiently.</p>
<p>We saved billion in IT expenses by the end of 1995. We went from 155
data centers to 16, and we consolidated 31 internal communications
networks into a single one.</p>
<p>Real estate was an especially big project. The real estate and
construction division in the United States had grown so big that it
could have been a separate company. In the early 1990s it employed 240
people. We had tens of millions of square feet in fancy city-center
office buildings that had been built by IBM in its heyday in the 1970s
and 1980s. You couldn’t walk into a major city in the United States that
did not have a large IBM tower. The same was true overseas. However, by
the 1990s, many properties were underused or being rented out. At the
same time, we were renting an entire floor in a midtown Manhattan office
building mostly for product introductions, for million a year.</p>
<p>We sold 8,000 acres of undeveloped land. We sold first-class real
estate that we didn’t need, like the tallest building in Atlanta. We
hired outside providers and cut full-time staff to 42. Around our
corporate headquarters in Westchester County, New York, we consolidated
twenty-one locations into five.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 1998, the total savings from these reengineering
projects was .5 billion. Since the reengineering work began, we’ve
achieved more than 4 billion in overall savings. Hardware development
was reduced from four years to an average of sixteen months—and for some
products, it’s far faster. We improved on-time product delivery rates
from 30 percent in 1995 to 95 percent in 2001; reduced inventory
carrying costs by 0 million, write-offs by 00 million, delivery costs by
70 million; and avoided materials costs of close to 5 billion.</p>
<p>Sell Unproductive Assets to Raise Cash</p>
<p>The fourth action program that we kicked off that summer represented
a scramble to sell unproductive assets and raise cash. Only a handful of
people understand how precariously close IBM came to running out of cash
in 1993. Whether we would have had to file for bankruptcy, I can’t say.
There were certainly lots of assets that could be sold to make the
company solvent again. The issue was: Could that be done before we
turned down that horrible spiral that companies enter when their cash
flow shrinks and their creditors are no longer willing to stand behind
them?</p>
<p>In July we announced that we would cut our annual dividend to
shareholders from .16 to . That fall, Jerry York and his team went to
work to sell any asset that was not essential to the company. We sold
much of the corporate airplane fleet. We sold the corporate headquarters
in New York City. We had massive investments in expensive training
centers where we housed and fed tens of thousands of people a year. In
1993 we had four such private facilities within an hour’s drive of the
Armonk headquarters, one of which, a former estate of the Guggenheim
family on the Gold Coast of Long Island, was used almost exclusively by
the IBM human resources organization.</p>
<p>Over the prior decade, IBM had amassed a large and important fine-art
collection, most of which was stored in crates out of sight from anyone.
Some of it did show up now and again in a public gallery in the IBM
tower on 57th Street in Manhattan. We had a curator and a staff who
maintained this collection. In 1995 the bulk of it was sold at auction
at Sotheby’s for 1 million. Unfortunately, the sale was condemned by
many people in the art world. For some reason, these people felt that it
was fine for IBM to fire employees and send them home, as long as we
kept some paintings in a gallery in New York City for people to view
occasionally.</p>
<p>The largest sale we made in the first year was IBM’s Federal Systems
Company, which did major projects primarily for the United States
government. We took advantage of the fact that the United States defense
industry was consolidating rapidly at that time and there were buyers
who would pay top dollar to increase their concentration. The unit had
an illustrious history of important technological breakthroughs for
various national security and space programs. However, it was also a
perpetual low-margin business because we never figured out how to fit it
into the overall high-expense model of the commercial side of the
business. Loral Corporation bought it in January 1994 for .5
billion.</p>
<p>The program of selling off unproductive assets continued for many
years. The need to raise cash became less important as we moved into
1995 and 1996. However, as the years went by, we continued to streamline
the company for a different reason: focus. (I will return to this
subject later.)</p>
<p>Hold the Vision</p>
<p>I’ve had a lot of experience turning around troubled companies, and
one of the first things I learned was that whatever hard or painful
things you have to do, do them quickly and make sure everyone knows what
you are doing and why. Whether dwelling on a problem, hiding a problem,
or dribbling out partial solutions to a problem while you wait for a
high tide to raise your boat—dithering and delay almost always compound
a negative situation. I believe in getting the problem behind me quickly
and moving on.</p>
<p>There were so many constituencies involved with a stake in IBM’s
future that we decided the only way to communicate with them all about
our decisions, including expense reductions and additional layoffs, was
through a press conference.</p>
<p>We made the announcement the morning of July 27 at a large meeting
room in a midtown Manhattan hotel. It seemed there were two hot topics
that year that guaranteed big press attendance—jobs and IBM. So when IBM
made an announcement about jobs, it was a full house, with every TV
network and major paper in the world present.</p>
<p>This was basically my coming-out event—my first public discussion of
what I had learned and planned to do at IBM. I worked hard on what I
would say, but given IBM’s longtime image of starchy formality, I
decided to speak without notes or even a podium. No props. Nothing to
lean on. Just me and what I had to say.</p>
<p>I said something at the press conference that turned out to be the
most quotable statement I ever made:</p>
<p>“What I’d like to do now is put these announcements in some sort of
perspective for you. There’s been a lot of speculation as to when I’m
going to deliver a vision of IBM, and what I’d like to say to all of you
is that the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.”</p>
<p>You could almost hear the reporters blink.</p>
<p>I went on: “What IBM needs right now is a series of very
tough-minded, market-driven, highly effective strategies for each of its
businesses—strategies that deliver performance in the marketplace and
shareholder value. And that’s what we’re working on.</p>
<p>“Now, the number-one priority is to restore the company to
profitability. I mean, if you’re going to have a vision for a company,
the first frame of that vision better be that you’re making money and
that the company has got its economics correct.</p>
<p>“And so we are committed to make this company profitable, and that’s
what today’s actions are about.</p>
<p>“The second priority for the company,” I said, “is to win the battle
in the customers’ premises. And we’re going to do a lot of things in
that regard, and again, they’re not visions—they’re people making things
happen to serve customers.”</p>
<p>I continued: “Third, in the marketplace, we are moving to be much
more aggressive in the client/server arena. Now, we do more
client/server solutions than anybody else in the world, but we have been
sort of typecast as the ‘mainframe company.’ Well, we are going to do
even more in client/server.</p>
<p>“Fourth, we are going to continue to be, in fact, the only
full-service provider in the industry, but what our customers are
telling us is they need IBM to be a full-solutions company. And we’re
going to do more and more of that and build the skills to get it
done.</p>
<p>“And lastly, we’re doing a lot of things that I would just call
‘customer responsiveness’—just being more attentive to the customer,
faster cycle time, faster delivery time, and a higher quality of
service.”</p>
<p>The reaction to the expense cuts was, for the most part, supportive.
“This is the most realistic restructuring program IBM’s had,” analyst
David Wu told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Michael Hammer, coauthor of Reengineering the Corporation, told The
New York Times: “Gerstner decided that sooner is better than
perfect—that was anathema to the old IBM. That is the most important
kind of change that can come from the top.”</p>
<p>As for my vision statement, the doom industry had a grand time
nailing my hide to the wall.</p>
<p>The ubiquitous Charles Ferguson, coauthor of Computer Wars, told The
New York Times: “Gerstner can be fabulous at this cost-cutting stuff and
still see IBM all but collapse over the next five years or so. The tough
part will be deciding what strategies it will pursue and to carve out a
profitable niche for IBM in the future.”</p>
<p>Barron’s was blunt: “George Bush would have called it the vision
thing. Others may be calling it the ‘lack-of-vision thing,’ in a pointed
reference to IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner’s assertion that ‘the last
thing IBM needs now is a vision.’ Instead, he told reporters last week,
the company most needs ‘market-driven…strategies in each of its
businesses.’ In other words, a super-duper tool kit.</p>
<p>“In truth, however, IBM’s newish chief does have a solution for the
ailing computer colossus, though it is neither poetic nor grand. Rather,
it is one of corporate anorexia.”</p>
<p>The Economist asked: “But does cost-cutting amount to a strategy for
survival?”</p>
<p>The Economist called my intention to keep IBM together
“shortsighted.” The magazine said: “As PCs become cheaper, more
powerful, and easier to link into networks, the number of customers
prepared to buy everything from IBM will dwindle. Indeed, IBM’s various
businesses would be much stronger competitors if they were not hamstrung
either by Big Blue’s still-vast corporate overheads, or by the need not
to tread on other divisions’ toes. It may take a few more quarters of
leaping losses to convince Mr. Gerstner of the need to break up IBM.
Shareholders, their investment at an eighteen-year low, and their
dividend halved for the second time this year, might wish that their
axeman would turn visionary overnight.”</p>
<p>I don’t know if I was surprised at the reaction—I guess I was. I was
certainly annoyed—and for good reason.</p>
<p>A lot of reporters dropped the words “right now” from my vision
statement when they wrote their stories. And so they had me saying that
“the last thing IBM needs is a vision.” That was inaccurate reporting,
and it changed my message in a big way.</p>
<p>I said we didn’t need a vision right now because I had discovered in
my first ninety days on the job that IBM had file drawers full of vision
statements. We had never missed predicting correctly a major
technological trend in the industry. In fact, we were still inventing
most of the technology that created those changes.</p>
<p>However, what was also clear was that IBM was paralyzed, unable to
act on any predictions, and there were no easy solutions to its
problems. The IBM organization, so full of brilliant, insightful people,
would have loved to receive a bold recipe for success—the more
sophisticated, the more complicated the recipe, the better everyone
would have liked it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t going to work that way. The real issue was going out and
making things happen every day in the marketplace. Our products weren’t
bad; our people were good people; our customers had long, successful
relationships with us. We just weren’t getting the job done. As I said
frequently to IBMers those days, “If you don’t like the pain, the only
answer is to move the pain onto the backs of your competitors. They’re
the ones who have taken your market share. They’re the ones who have
taken away your net worth. They’re the ones who made it more difficult
to send your children and grandchildren to college. The answer is to
shift the pain to them and return IBM to a world of success.”</p>
<p>Fixing IBM was all about execution. We had to stop looking for people
to blame, stop tweaking the internal structure and systems. I wanted no
excuses. I wanted no long-term projects that people could wait for that
would somehow produce a magic turnaround. I wanted—IBM needed—an
enormous sense of urgency.</p>
<p>What the pundits also missed was that we had already made some very
fundamental strategic decisions that were the early elements of a
vision. I did not talk about them in that July meeting—at least, I
didn’t talk about them as forthrightly as I might have—because I did not
want our competitors to see where we were going. The key strategic
decisions that were already made before that eventful day were
extraordinarily significant in the turnaround of IBM. They were:</p>
<p>Keep the company together and not spin off the pieces.</p>
<p>Reinvest in the mainframe.</p>
<p>Remain in the core semiconductor technology business.</p>
<p>Protect the fundamental RandandandandD budget.</p>
<p>Drive all we did from the customer back and turn IBM into a
market-driven rather than an internally focused, process-driven
enterprise.</p>
<p>You could argue that a lot of these decisions represented a return to
IBM’s Watson roots. However, to have announced in July 1993 a strategy
built around past experience would have subjected us to gales of
laughter that would have blown around the world. If the last thing IBM
needed in July 1993 was a vision, the second last thing it needed was
for me to stand up and say that IBM had basically everything right and
we would stand pat but work harder. That would have had a devastating
effect on all our constituents—customers, employees, and
shareholders.</p>
<p>So the truly unique challenge of my first few months at IBM was to
reject the knee-jerk responses that would have destroyed the company,
and to focus on day-to-day execution, stabilizing the company while we
sought growth strategies that would build on our unique position in the
industry. Those were not to come until a year later.</p>
