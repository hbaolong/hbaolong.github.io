<h4 id="reviving-the-brand">9 Reviving the Brand</h4>
<p>All of our efforts to save IBM—through right-sizing and reengineering
and creating strategy and boosting morale and all the rest—would have
been for naught if, while we were hard at work on the other things, the
IBM brand fell apart. I have always believed a successful company must
have a customer/marketplace orientation and a strong marketing
organization. That’s why my second step in creating a global enterprise
had to be to fix and focus IBM’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>IBM won numerous awards in the 1980s for its ingenious Charlie
Chaplin commercials, which had introduced the IBM personal computer. By
the early 1990s, however, the company’s advertising system had fallen
into a state of chaos. As part of the drive toward decentralization, it
seemed that every product manager in just about every part of the
company was hiring his or her own advertising agency. IBM had more than
seventy ad agencies in 1993, each working on its own, without any
central coordination. It was like seventy tiny trumpets all tooting
simultaneously for attention. A single issue of an industry trade
magazine could have up to eighteen different IBM ads, with eighteen
different designs, messages, and even logos.</p>
<p>In June 1993 I hired Abby Kohnstamm as the head of Corporate
Marketing for IBM. She had worked with me for many years at American
Express. What we had to do here was so important and urgent that I
wanted someone who knew me and how I managed, and with whom I could
speak in shorthand.</p>
<p>Abby had an especially tough challenge. There had never been a true
head of marketing in IBM. Few people in the business units understood or
accepted her role, and at first they tried to ignore her. IBM was built
on technology and sales. And, in IBM at that time, the term “marketing”
really meant “sales.” Using the broadest definition, sales is about
fulfilling the demand that marketing generates. When it’s done well,
marketing is a multi-disciplinary function that involves market
segmentation and analysis of both competitors and customer preferences,
corporate and product brand management, advertising, and direct mail.
That’s only a partial listing. While IBM clearly had to sell more of
what it made, it also had to recast its image and reestablish its
relevance to the marketplace. When I arrived at IBM, marketing was not
considered a distinct professional discipline, and it was not being
managed as such. I told Abby to take sixty days to do a situation
analysis.</p>
<p>Her research found that despite our well-chronicled problems, the
overall IBM brand was still strong. Customers believed that if they
bought an IBM product, it would be a good one. As I had expected, our
biggest strength was as a unified brand, and not as each of our parts.
Consequently, the marketing mission would be to articulate why customers
would want to do business with an integrated IBM.</p>
<p>Abby knew she had to end the dissonance. We got there in stages
because, while you can force anything down the throat of an
organization, if people don’t buy into the logic, the change won’t
stick. Stage one was weaning IBM executives off the luxury of having
their own advertising budgets, their personal agencies, and the
discretion to order up an ad anytime they wanted to do so. One month
there’d be no IBM advertising in important industry magazines; the next
month we’d have so many pages that it seemed as if we were sponsoring a
special issue. The latter was especially true in November and December,
when marketing departments wanted to spend leftover dollars in their
budgets.</p>
<p>Abby’s job was to get control of the spending and the messages. I
asked her to present a plan to the newly formed Worldwide Management
Council at our conference center in Palisades, New York. It was a tough
meeting, but she did a very smart thing. When the thirty-five WMC
members walked into the room, they found every wall adorned with the
advertising, packaging, and marketing collateral of all our agencies. It
was a train wreck of brand and product positioning.</p>
<p>After her presentation, I posed one question: “Does anyone doubt we
can do this better?” There was no discussion.</p>
<p>One Voice, One Agency</p>
<p>Abby decided to consolidate all of IBM’s advertising relationships
into a single agency—not just in the United States, but around the
world. At the time, it was the largest advertising consolidation in
history. Few people knew about her plan at first—a handful of people
inside IBM, and only the chief executives of the agencies under
consideration. There was no formal advertising review process. No
creative development. No presentations. Abby narrowed down the list to
four agencies, including just one that was then handling any of the IBM
accounts. Over four weeks, she held a series of two-day meetings in
hotels (with people on both sides using aliases) to gauge chemistry,
thinking, and how each would approach a challenge this big.</p>
<p>She and her small team of IBMers unanimously settled on Ogilvy
andandandand Mather, which had solid worldwide expertise and experience.
That was exactly what IBM needed, since the agency would manage
advertising for all of our products and services, as well as our overall
brand, around the world.</p>
<p>Before we signed off on the deal, I asked Abby to bring the top three
people at OandandandandM to our corporate headquarters. We were about to
bet the IBM brand on these people, so I wanted to make sure we were all
clear about the stakes we were playing for—to look them in the eye and
hear them commit to the success of this effort, no matter what it was
going to take. Interestingly, the meeting revealed that they had a
parallel objective. They were betting a big part of their future on
IBM—and resigning from several of their existing accounts. So, in fact,
we were looking each other in the eye.</p>
<p>Abby had my complete support, but others were a tougher sell, both
inside and outside the company. Many of the product and geographic units
adopted a “this too shall pass” approach—up until the time when we
centralized most of the advertising spending and the media buying and
went to global contracts. The ad community itself was in absolute shock.
Not only was this not done in the advertising world—but by stodgy,
trouble-plagued IBM?</p>
<p>The New York Times covered the consolidation on page one. Advertising
Age called it the “marketing shot heard ’round the world.” But it was a
mostly positive shot. Ad Age went on to say: “Because computer products,
brands, and publications have few geographic boundaries, a world
approach makes sense.…A single agency meshed neatly with Mr. Gerstner’s
strategy to centralize controls and bring independent units like the PC
division back into the fold.”</p>
<p>Always critical, The Wall Street Journal called the decision
“audacious” and “fraught with risk.” The paper warned: “If the agency
doesn’t devise an instantly winning campaign, it could set IBM’s
recovery back for months.”</p>
<p>Far from it. Despite the fierce kicking and screaming of many local
managers, the first campaign debuted in 1994 under the theme “Solutions
for a Small Planet.” The innovative TV spots—featuring an international
cast, from Czech nuns to old Parisians speaking in their native language
with all the dialogue subtitled—were highly acclaimed.</p>
<p>The campaign reaffirmed important messages: IBM was global, and we
were staying together as a world-class integrator. At the same time, it
signaled that we were a very different company—able to change and make
bold decisions, just as we had done with the decision to consolidate;
able to move quickly; able to take risks and do innovative things; and
we were more accessible. The campaign humanized our brand.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the creative work, we completely overhauled our
budgeting and media buying. We knew we’d save money through the
consolidation, and we certainly did. But that wasn’t the reason to do
it. In fact, we immediately doubled our investment in marketing and
advertising, and we’ve sustained that level of investment over the
years.</p>
<p>“Solutions for a Small Planet” was followed by a campaign that coined
the term “e-business” and helped establish IBM as the leader of the most
important trend in the industry at that time (more on that later).</p>
<p>Against all odds, Abby Kohnstamm had made something great and
impactful happen. She had to build the marketing function from scratch
and simultaneously create a unified, global campaign for a company that
had a recent history of dysfunctional, fractious, competing messaging.
All of this rubbed mightily against the historical culture of IBM. Abby
was another hero of the turnaround.</p>
