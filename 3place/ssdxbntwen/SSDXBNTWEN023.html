<h4 id="reflections-on-strategy">19 Reflections on Strategy</h4>
<p>As I look back on the strategic bets we made and how they’ve played
out over the past nine years, I am struck by a conflicting impression.
On one level so much about IBM has changed. On another level very little
is different.</p>
<p>If you were to take a snapshot of IBM’s array of businesses in 1993
and another in 2002, you would at first see very few changes. Ten years
ago we were in servers, software, services, PCs, storage,
semiconductors, printers, and financing. We are still in those
businesses today. Of course, some of those businesses have grown
enormously. Others have been refocused. But we have exited just a few
segments of the industry. And we have not made gigantic acquisitions to
launch us into entirely different industries.</p>
<p>My point is that all of the assets that the company needed to succeed
were in place. But in every case—hardware, technology, software, even
services—all of these capabilities were part of a business model that
had fallen wildly out of step with marketplace realities. There is no
arguing that the System/360 mainframe business model was brilliant and
correct when it was conceived some forty years ago. But by the late
1980s it had become fatally outmoded. It had failed to adapt as
customers, technology, and competitors changed.</p>
<p>What was needed was straightforward but devilishly difficult and
risky to pull off. We had to take our businesses, products, and people
out of a self-contained, self-sustaining world and make them thrive in
the real world.</p>
<p>On a technical level, as I’ve described, this required the nontrivial
task of moving our entire product line—all of our servers, operating
systems, middleware, programming tools, and chip sets—from proprietary
to open architectures. That alone could have killed us. Many IT
companies that have built their businesses on some proprietary product
have tried to leap across that chasm. Few have made it across
successfully.</p>
<p>This is more than a technical decision to adopt and support a bunch
of industry-standard specifications. For IBM, breaking with our
proprietary past meant walking away from all the historic architectural
control points. It meant stepping onto a competitive playing field that
was open to all comers.</p>
<p>The implications of this kind of leap to a company’s economic model
can be devastating. In IBM’s case it meant the collapse of gross profit
margins and the attendant changes we had to engineer to lower our cost
structure without compromising our effectiveness.</p>
<p>Yet the hardest part of these decisions was neither the technological
nor economic transformations required. It was changing the culture—the
mindset and instincts of hundreds of thousands of people who had grown
up in an undeniably successful company, but one that had for decades
been immune to normal competitive and economic forces. The challenge was
making that workforce live, compete, and win in the real world. It was
like taking a lion raised for all of its life in captivity and suddenly
teaching it to survive in the jungle.</p>
<p>This kind of wrenching cultural change doesn’t happen by executive
fiat. As I found, I couldn’t flip a switch and alter behaviors. It was,
by any measure, the hardest part of IBM’s transformation, and at times I
thought it couldn’t be done.</p>
