<h4 id="on-corporate-culture">20 On Corporate Culture</h4>
<p>Back in the early 1990s, when a person saw or heard “IBM,” what words
and images came to mind? “Big computers,” “PC,” and “ThinkPads,” maybe.
But inevitably they would also think “big company,” “conservative,”
“regimented,” “reliable,” and “dark suits and white shirts.”</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that these latter descriptions refer not to
products or services, but to people and a business culture. IBM may be
unique in this regard; the company has been known as much for its
culture as for what it made and sold. Even today if you pause and think
“IBM,” chances are you’ll think of attributes (hopefully, very positive
ones!) of a kind of enterprise and its people rather than of computers
or software.</p>
<p>I have spent more than twenty-five years as a senior executive of
three different corporations—and I peeked into many more as a consultant
in the years before that. Until I came to IBM, I probably would have
told you that culture was just one among several important elements in
any organization’s makeup and success—along with vision, strategy,
marketing, financials, and the like. I might have chronicled the
positive and negative cultural attributes of my companies (“positive”
and “negative” from the point of view of driving marketplace success).
And I could have told you how I went about tapping into—or
changing—those attributes.</p>
<p>The descriptions would have been accurate, but in one important
respect I would have been wrong.</p>
<p>I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect
of the game—it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more
than the collective capacity of its people to create value. Vision,
strategy, marketing, financial management—any management system, in
fact—can set you on the right path and can carry you for a while. But no
enterprise—whether in business, government, education, health care, or
any area of human endeavor—will succeed over the long haul if those
elements aren’t part of its DNA.</p>
<p>You’ve probably found, as I have, that most companies say their
cultures are about the same things—outstanding customer service,
excellence, teamwork, shareholder value, responsible corporate behavior,
and integrity. But, of course, these kinds of values don’t necessarily
translate into the same kind of behavior in all companies—how people
actually go about their work, how they interact with one another, what
motivates them. That’s because, as with national cultures, most of the
really important rules aren’t written down anywhere.</p>
<p>Still, you can quickly figure out, sometimes within hours of being in
a place, what the culture encourages and discourages, rewards and
punishes. Is it a culture that rewards individual achievement or team
play? Does it value risk taking or consensus building?</p>
<p>I have a theory about how culture emerges and evolves in large
institutions: Successful institutions almost always develop strong
cultures that reinforce those elements that make the institution great.
They reflect the environment from which they emerged. When that
environment shifts, it is very hard for the culture to change. In fact,
it becomes an enormous impediment to the institution’s ability to
adapt.</p>
<p>This is doubly true when a company is the creation of a visionary
leader. A company’s initial culture is usually determined by its
founder’s mindset—that person’s values, beliefs, preferences, and also
idiosyncrasies. It’s been said that every institution is nothing but the
extended shadow of one person. In IBM’s case, that was Thomas J. Watson,
Sr.</p>
<p>The Basic Beliefs</p>
<p>The defining ethos of Watson, Sr., was palpable in every aspect of
IBM. It became part of the company’s DNA—from the paternalism to the
stingy stock-option program; from the
no-drinking-at-corporate-gatherings policy to the preference that
employees be married.</p>
<p>Watson’s experience as a self-made man engendered a culture of
respect, hard work, and ethical behavior. IBM was the leader in
diversity for decades, well before governments even spoke of the need to
seek equality in employment, advancement, and compensation. A sense of
integrity, of responsibility, flows through the veins of IBM in a way
I’ve never seen in any other company. IBM people are committed—committed
to their company, and committed to what their company does.</p>
<p>And then there were the more visible, well-known (and, to modern
eyes, almost corny) symbols—from the public rituals that celebrated
achievement, to the company songs, to the dress code. IBM virtually
invented the notion of the company as an all-encompassing context for
its employees’ lives. And it envisioned its customers in that enveloping
way, too.</p>
<p>Of course, enlightened companies and leaders know that an institution
must outlive any one person or any one group of leaders. Watson realized
this and he deliberately and systematically institutionalized the values
that had made IBM under his tenure a very successful company.</p>
<p>He summarized them in what he termed the Basic Beliefs:</p>
<p>Excellence in everything we do.</p>
<p>Superior customer service.</p>
<p>Respect for the individual.</p>
<p>Institutionalizing these beliefs wasn’t just a matter of displaying
signs in every office (although they were everywhere). The Beliefs were
reflected in the compensation and benefits systems, in the management
schools, in employee educational and training programs, in marketing,
and in customer support. It was the doctrine of the company—and very few
companies have extended a doctrine so pervasively.</p>
<p>For a long time it worked. The more successful an enterprise becomes,
the more it wants to codify what makes it great—and that can be a good
thing. It creates institutional learning, effective transfer of
knowledge, and a clear sense of “how we do things.” Inevitably, though,
as the world changes, the rules, guidelines, and customs lose their
connection to what the enterprise is all about.</p>
<p>A perfect example was the IBM dress code. It was well known
throughout business circles that IBM salespeople—or, for that matter,
any IBM employee—wore very formal business attire. Tom Watson
established this rule when IBM was calling on corporate executives
who—guess what—wore dark suits and white shirts! In other words,
Watson’s eminently sensible direction was: Respect your customer, and
dress accordingly.</p>
<p>However, as the years went by, customers changed how they dressed at
work, and few of the technical buyers in corporations showed up in white
and blue. However, Watson’s sensible connection to the customer was
forgotten, and the dress code marched on. When I abolished IBM’s dress
code in 1995, it got an extraordinary amount of attention in the press.
Some thought it was an action of great portent. In fact, it was one of
the easiest decisions I made—or, rather, didn’t make; it wasn’t really a
“decision.” We didn’t replace one dress code with another. I simply
returned to the wisdom of Mr. Watson and decided: Dress according to the
circumstances of your day and recognize who you will be with (customers,
government leaders, or just your colleagues in the labs).</p>
<p>This codification, this rigor mortis that sets in around values and
behaviors, is a problem unique to—and often devastating for—successful
enterprises. I suspect that many successful companies that have fallen
on hard times in the past—including IBM, Sears, General Motors, Kodak,
Xerox, and many others—saw perhaps quite clearly the changes in their
environment. They were probably able to conceptualize and articulate the
need for change and perhaps even develop strategies for it. What I think
hurt the most was their inability to change highly structured,
sophisticated cultures that had been born in a different world.</p>
<p>Take the Basic Beliefs. There is no arguing with these. They should
be the standard tenets of any company in any industry, in any country,
at any period in history. But what the Beliefs had come to mean—or, at
least, the way they were being used—was very different in 1993 than in
1962, when Tom Watson had introduced them.</p>
<p>Consider “superior customer service.” The supplier-customer power
relationship had become so one-sided during IBM’s hegemony that
“customer service” came to mean, essentially, “servicing our machines on
the customers’ premises,” instead of paying real attention to their
changing businesses—and, where appropriate, challenging customers to
expand their thinking (as IBM had famously done during the launch of the
System/360). We basically acted as if what customers needed had been
settled long ago, and our job was to ship them our next system, whenever
it came out. Customer service became largely administrative—like going
through the motions in a marriage that has long since lost its
passion.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to “excellence in everything we do.” The
pursuit of excellence over time became an obsession with perfection. It
resulted in a stultifying culture and a spider’s web of checks,
approvals, and validation that slowed decision making to a crawl. When I
arrived at IBM, new mainframes were announced every four to five years.
Today they are launched, on average, every eighteen months (with
excellent quality, I might add). I can understand the joke that was
going around IBM in the early 1990s: “Products aren’t launched at IBM.
They escape.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most powerful of all the Beliefs—and most corrupted—was
“respect for the individual.” I am treading on the most sacred ground
here, and I do so gingerly. To this day, “respect for the individual” is
the rallying cry for the hardcore faithful—for the True Blue, as they
call themselves.</p>
<p>But I have to say that, to an outsider, “respect for the individual”
had devolved to mean a couple of things Watson certainly did not have in
mind. For one, it helped spawn a culture of entitlement, where “the
individual” didn’t have to do anything to earn respect—he or she
expected rich benefits and lifetime employment simply by virtue of
having been hired.</p>
<p>Or that’s the way it appeared to me at first. Later I came to feel
that the real problem was not that employees felt they were entitled.
They had just become accustomed to immunity from things like recessions,
price wars, and technology changes. And for the most part, they didn’t
even realize that this self-contained, insulated system also worked
against them. I was shocked, for instance, to discover the pay
disparities—particularly in very important technical and sales
professions—of IBM employees when compared to the competition and the
industry in general. Our best people weren’t getting what they
deserved.</p>
<p>“Respect for the individual” also came to mean that an IBMer could do
pretty much anything he or she wanted to do, within the broad HR and
legal rulebooks, with little or no accountability. If you were a poor
performer and we terminated you, we weren’t respecting your
individuality because we hadn’t trained you for whatever it was you were
expected to do. If your boss told you to do something and you didn’t
agree, you could ignore the order.</p>
<p>These were very serious problems. They had become deeply engrained
through years of self-reinforcing experience. And, most challenging of
all, they were almost inextricably interwoven with all that was good,
smart, and creative about the company and its people—all the things it
would have been madness to destroy, or even to tamper with. We couldn’t
throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p>Stepping Up to the Challenge</p>
<p>Frankly, if I could have chosen not to tackle the IBM culture
head-on, I probably wouldn’t have. For one thing, my bias coming in was
toward strategy, analysis, and measurement. I’d already been successful
with those, and like anyone, I was inclined to stick with what had
worked for me earlier in my career. Once I found a handful of smart
people, I knew we could take a fresh look at the business and make good
strategic calls or invest in new businesses or get the cost structure in
shape.</p>
<p>In comparison, changing the attitude and behavior of hundreds of
thousands of people is very, very hard to accomplish. Business schools
don’t teach you how to do it. You can’t lead the revolution from the
splendid isolation of corporate headquarters. You can’t simply give a
couple of speeches or write a new credo for the company and declare that
the new culture has taken hold. You can’t mandate it, can’t engineer
it.</p>
<p>What you can do is create the conditions for transformation. You can
provide incentives. You can define the marketplace realities and goals.
But then you have to trust. In fact, in the end, management doesn’t
change culture. Management invites the workforce itself to change the
culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps the toughest nut of all to crack was getting IBM employees to
accept that invitation. Many used hierarchy as a crutch and were
reluctant to take personal responsibility for outcomes. Instead of
grabbing available resources and authority, they waited for the boss to
tell them what to do; they delegated up. In the end, my deepest
culture-change goal was to induce IBMers to believe in themselves
again—to believe that they had the ability to determine their own fate,
and that they already knew what they needed to know. It was to shake
them out of their depressed stupor, remind them of who they were—you’re
IBM, damn it!—and get them to think and act collaboratively, as hungry,
curious self-starters.</p>
<p>In other words, at the same time I was working to get employees to
listen to me, to understand where we needed to go, to follow me there, I
needed to get them to stop being followers. This wasn’t a logical,
linear challenge. It was counterintuitive, centered around social cues
and emotion rather than reason.</p>
<p>Tough as that was, we had to suck it up and take on the task of
changing the culture, given what was at stake. I knew it would take at
least five years. (In that I underestimated.) And I knew the leader of
the revolution had to be me—I had to commit to thousands of hours of
personal activity to pull off the change. I would have to be up-front
and outspoken about what I was doing. I needed to get my leadership team
to join me. We all had to talk openly and directly about culture,
behavior, and beliefs—we could not be subtle.</p>
