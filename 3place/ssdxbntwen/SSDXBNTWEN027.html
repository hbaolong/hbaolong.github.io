<h4 id="focusyou-have-to-know-and-love-your-business">23 Focus—You Have
to Know (and Love) Your Business</h4>
<p>Few people and few institutions would admit to a lack of focus, even
in an exercise of honest self-evaluation. However, I have learned that
lack of focus is the most common cause of corporate mediocrity. It shows
up in many forms, most notably in the items that follow.</p>
<p>“The grass is greener.”</p>
<p>This is the most pernicious example. In my thirty-five-year business
career I have seen many companies, when the going gets tough in their
base business, decide to try their luck in new industries. It’s a long
list: Xerox going into financial services; Coca-Cola into movies; Kodak
into pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a student at Harvard Business School forty
years ago, a marketing professor argued that the problem with buggy-whip
companies was they thought they were in the buggy-whip business, not the
transportation business. The professor argued that companies often focus
on too narrow a segment and fail to see important changes in their
marketplaces. I cannot argue with the underlying premise here, but I
would argue that it’s very, very hard for a buggy-whip company to become
an airplane manufacturer.</p>
<p>Too many executives don’t want to fight the tough battles of
resurrecting, resuscitating, and strengthening their base business—or
they simply give up on their base business too soon. As IBM made its bet
on the kind of convergence I described in Chapter 18, it diverted its
attention from what it always did well—building large-scale, powerful
computers—and bought a telephone switching company (ROLM). When things
got tough in the charge card and travel business in the 1980s, the
chairman of American Express tried to get into the cable TV,
entertainment, and book publishing businesses. Of course, American
Express brought no skills to any of those businesses. Nabisco, one of
the great food companies in the world, bought a tobacco company in 1985.
Fourteen years later it spun off the tobacco business, and the only true
long-term result was a weakening of the food company.</p>
<p>That’s usually what happens when a company strays from its core
competencies. Its competitors rejoice at, and prosper from, the lack of
focus. And the company ultimately sinks into a deeper hole.</p>
<p>The fact is, in most cases a company has a set of competitive
advantages in its base business. It may be hard—very hard—to redirect or
reenergize an existing enterprise. Believe me, it’s a lot easier than
throwing that enterprise over the fence into a totally new environment
and succeeding. Age-old common sense: Stick to your knitting; dance with
the partner who brought you. History shows that truly great and
successful companies go through constant and sometimes difficult
self-renewal of the base business. They don’t jump into new pools where
they have no sense of the depth or temperature of the water.</p>
<p>“We need to grow, so let’s go acquire somebody.”</p>
<p>Related very much to the ongoing commitment to building a core
business is the ability to say no to acquisition fever. This is a
contagious disease that infects too many executives. When given a choice
of working hard to fix a base business or, instead, completing a
glamorous acquisition and crowing about its promise on the financial TV
stations, too many executives opt for the latter. As I look back on my
IBM life, there is no question that a good portion of our success was
due to all of the deals we didn’t do. A partial list of the companies
that were proposed as acquisition candidates includes: MCI, Nortel,
Compaq, SGI, and Novell and Telecoms galore. Investment bankers with
thick, blue books were always ready to describe a yellow brick road
leading to the wonderful city of Oz. Not one of these deals would have
worked.</p>
<p>I could tell a lot of investment-banker stories, but perhaps the one
that stands out in my mind the most was the proposal from one bank that
IBM acquire Compaq Computer. The summary of the transaction that was
included in the front of the ever-present blue book showed IBM’s stock
price going up forever after completing the transaction. Surprised at
how this tree would grow to heaven, I rummaged through the appendix and
found that IBM’s profits for the next five years (roughly 0 billion
after taxes) would be wiped out by this transaction and we would show
huge losses over that entire period. When I told my CFO to question the
banker about how this could be viewed as positive by the investment
community, the answer came back: “Oh, investors would all see right
through this. It wouldn’t matter.” Ah, if only the elixir peddled by
investment bankers worked, then CEOs would never have to worry or even
work. Hello, golf!</p>
<p>Back in the real world, however, there have been numerous, empirical
studies conducted over the past twenty years showing that the likelihood
of an acquisition’s proving to be a failure far outweighs the chances of
success. That doesn’t mean I think acquisitions have no place in good
corporate strategy. IBM made ninety acquisitions during my tenure as
CEO. The most successful were those that fit neatly into an organic
growth plan. IBM’s purchase of Informix is a great example. We were
neck-and-neck with Oracle in the database business, and Informix,
another database company, had lost its momentum and market leadership.
We didn’t need to buy Informix to get into the database business or to
shore up a weak position. However, we did acquire a set of customers
more quickly and more efficiently than we could have following a
go-it-alone strategy.</p>
<p>The same was true with a number of other acquisitions in which we
basically bought technology that we were going to have to develop
ourselves but were able to accelerate our control of that technology
through a highly focused acquisition. In other words, acquisitions that
fit within an existing strategy have the most likely probability of
success. Those that represent attempts to buy new positions in new
marketplaces or that involve smashing together two very similar
companies are fraught with risk.</p>
<p>Steely-Eyed Strategies</p>
<p>Bottom line: At the end of the day a successful, focused enterprise
is one that has developed a deep understanding of its customers’ needs,
its competitive environment, and its economic realities. This
comprehensive analysis must then form the basis for specific strategies
that are translated into day-to-day execution.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in my experience, not enough
companies really do the analytical work in a truly objective way (hope
usually prevails over reality); even fewer can then translate the
analysis into precise action programs that are tracked month by
month.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, perhaps my most infamous quote dealt with the
subject of vision. During my years at McKinsey, seeing many different
companies, I was always amazed at how many executives thought that
“vision” was the same as “strategy.” It’s very easy to develop visions.
It’s the same thing as Babe Ruth pointing to the fences. How many Babe
Ruths do you think have pointed to the fences in the last twenty years?
How many do you think hit a home run within the next minute?</p>
<p>Vision statements can create a sense of confidence—a sense of
comfort—that is truly dangerous. Vision statements are for the most part
aspirational, and they play a role in creating commitment and excitement
among an institution’s employees. But in and of themselves they are
useless in terms of pointing out how the institution is going to turn an
aspirational goal into a reality.</p>
<p>Again, good strategies start with massive amounts of quantitative
analysis—hard, difficult analysis that is blended with wisdom, insight,
and risk taking. When I first arrived at IBM I asked, “What do our
customers think about us? Let me see our customer satisfaction data.” I
got back reports that were amazingly positive. Basically, customers
loved us.</p>
<p>It was all statistical; it all seemed thorough and accurate. However,
it just didn’t make sense, given that we were losing share in almost
every one of our product lines. It took me a while, but I finally
discovered that the way we measured customer satisfaction was to ask our
sales force to pick some of their customers and ask them to complete a
survey. IBM does not hire dumb salespeople. They obviously picked their
best and happiest customers, and we were getting lots of positive data
and absolutely fooling ourselves every day.</p>
<p>Moreover, every part of IBM was doing its own thing: We were
conducting 339 different satisfaction surveys. Disparate methodologies
made it impossible to get a single view—even if the sample wasn’t biased
by the sales force.</p>
<p>Today we conduct fourteen comprehensive customer surveys,
administered by an independent research firm. Names are sourced from
external lists (not the sales force) and we interview almost 100,000
customers and noncustomers every year. Surveys are conducted in thirty
languages in fifty-five countries, and they compare our performance
against those of all our major competitors. Most important, the data are
incorporated into our tactical and strategic plans on a semiweekly
basis.</p>
<p>Intelligence Wins Wars</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult part of good strategy is hard-nosed
competitive analysis. Almost every institution develops a pride in
itself; it wants to believe it’s the best. And a lot of what we as
managers do is encourage that sense of loyalty and pride. However, this
family feeling often gets in the way of really deep competitive insight.
We want to believe our products are better than our competitors’
products. We want to believe customers value us more than they do our
competitors.</p>
<p>Product managers want their bosses to believe the manager has created
the best products in the industry. But facts are facts, and they’ve got
to be assembled on a continuous, unbiased basis. Products have to be
torn down and examined for cost, features, and functionality. Each
element of the income statement and balance sheet has to be examined
with total objectivity vis-à-vis competitors. What are their
distribution costs? How many salespeople do they have? How are their
salespeople paid? What do distributors think about them v. us? There are
hundreds of questions that need analytical examination and which then
must be pulled together in comprehensive, deep competitive
assessments.</p>
<p>Often a root cause of inadequate competitive analysis is asking the
innkeeper how good the inn is. It’s fairly axiomatic that most managers
are not going to strategize themselves out of business. Most managers
are not going to present to corporate officers an unvarnished, bleak
picture of their stewardship. (Perhaps the only time you really get a
totally objective analysis of a business from a division president is
when he or she first arrives on the scene. Then there’s no
accountability for prior mistakes—it’s the prior incumbent’s
problem!)</p>
<p>Good Strategy: Long on Detail</p>
<p>The most important value-added function of a corporate management
team is to ensure that the strategies developed by the operating units
are steeped in tough-minded analysis, and that they are insightful and
actionable. All of the critical assumptions—things such as pricing and
industry growth rates—need rigorous and tough-minded review.</p>
<p>Why is this all so important to the subject of focus? Because truly
great companies lay out strategies that are believable and executable.
Companies that leap into new businesses and chase acquisitions
willy-nilly are those that really don’t have a conviction about their
existing strategy. They don’t have a clear understanding of the five or
six critical things they need to do in their base business to be
successful. Those five or six things are the prime elements that the
organization should be preoccupied with every day, then measuring,
adjusting, and reallocating resources as necessary.</p>
<p>Again, good strategies are long on detail and short on vision. They
lay out multi-year plans in great quantitative detail: the market
segments the company will pursue, market share numbers that must be
achieved, expense levels that must be managed, and resources that must
be applied. These plans are then reviewed regularly and become, in a
sense, the driving force behind everything the company does.</p>
<p>Consequently, when an acquisition opportunity shows up from your
friendly investment banker, it isn’t his or her analysis that is
examined. Rather, you do a detailed analysis of how the acquisition fits
into the strategy. In fact, if a company hears about an attractive
acquisition candidate first from an investment banker, it almost always
means the company hasn’t done a good job on its strategy. A good
strategy will always identify critical holes, competitive weaknesses,
and the potential to fill them with tactical acquisitions. I have bought
many companies during my business career; I can’t remember one of them
that was a new idea unearthed by an investment banker.</p>
<p>The Hard Part: Allocating Resources</p>
<p>Finally, making sure that resources are applied to the most important
elements of the strategy is perhaps the hardest thing for companies to
do. Too many companies view strategy and operations as two separate
activities. Strategies are completed once a year, reviewed during long
meetings, and approved by some higher authority; then everybody goes off
and continues to run the business in much the same way that they did
before. If, in fact, a strategy does call for a different set of
actions, the very difficult task of taking resources away from some
other activity in the company and reassigning them to the higher
priority is not done well in many businesses.</p>
<p>Let’s return to customer satisfaction at IBM. After we developed
truly effective, independent measurements to ascertain how our customers
viewed us and our competitors, it was clear that one of our biggest
problems was with how easy—or not—it was to do business with us. Our
customers liked our products, liked our breadth of experience, liked our
ability to help them solve problems, but they often found us to be
maddeningly difficult to deal with and/or to get answers from
quickly.</p>
<p>Addressing this issue was not easy. There was not a single silver
bullet we could fire to solve the problem. There was not a single
project we could heap a bundle of money on to make sure the mission got
done. It involved hundreds of projects, cutting across the entire
company from salespeople to lawyers to telephone clerks.</p>
<p>In some companies such a project, mundane in its day-to-day
activities but essential in its strategic context, would die of its own
weight and its lack of connectiveness to the daily grind in a relatively
short period of time. We had to work hard to maintain its vitality,
funding, and focus. It worked, but it was a reminder to me of how
difficult it is to get large organizations to give meaningful resources
and attention to matters that offer little or no benefit to quarterly
results, but which are critical to long-term success.</p>
<p>Survival of the Fattest</p>
<p>Here’s my last observation on focus: The Darwinian concept of
survival of the fittest unfortunately doesn’t work in a lot of
companies. Instead, too often the rule is “survival of the fattest.”
Divisions or product lines that are successful today always want to
redeploy their cash and other resources into existing products and
existing markets. Finding ample resources to fund new growth and new
businesses is one of the hardest tasks of a corporate leader.</p>
<p>While we never reached the level of performance I would have liked at
IBM, we worked very hard at the process of starving the losers and
investing in new big bets. It required a very different process than the
one necessary for developing strategy. It required a rigorous portfolio
review in which we said to the entire company: Investment dollars belong
to Corporate, all of them, not just the discretionary new capital. We
try to start with all of our businesses—successful and not so
successful—as a zero-sum planning process every few years. This allowed
us to kill thousands of research projects, eliminate hundreds of
products, sell large businesses, and redeploy resources into promising
new ventures. Even then we could not be sure we had effectively
redeployed our assets. Those new ventures had to be protected from the
normal budgetary cycle because if things get tight, more often than not,
profit-center managers would be tempted to starve the future-oriented
projects.</p>
<p>This is not the place to explain the many things we did to avoid the
problems and to support new businesses, but it is a very important
aspect of my overall conviction that focus is a critical element of
institutional success. If a management team doesn’t believe that it has
identified and is seriously funding new growth opportunities, then it is
likely to wander off and drink the heady brew of acquisitions and
diversification—and ultimately fail.</p>
