<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<p>I have never said to myself, “Gee, I think I want to write a book.” I
am not a book writer. Until now I haven’t had the time or the
inclination to lean back and reflect on my thirty-five years in
business. I haven’t had the patience it takes to sit down for a long
time and create a book. Throughout my business life I have been wary of
telling others how to manage their enterprises based on my personal
experiences.</p>
<p>And, frankly, I wasn’t sure if anyone would be interested in reading
my thoughts. I read a lot of books, but not many about business.
<strong>After a twelve-hour day at the office, who would want to go home
and read about someone else’s career at the office?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have always believed you cannot run a successful enterprise
from behind a desk.</strong> That’s why, during my nine years as Chief
Executive Officer of International Business Machines Corporation, I have
flown more than I million miles and met with untold thousands of IBM
customers, business partners, and employees. Over the past two years,
after people began speculating that my retirement might be just around
the corner, I thought I’d get a lot of big-picture questions that
outgoing CEOs get about the economy, the world, and the future. Instead,
I have been surprised by how many times—at big meetings and small ones,
and even at private sessions with CEOs and heads of state—I was asked:
“How did you save IBM?” “What was it like when you got there?” “What
were the problems?” “What specific things did you do to bring the
company back to life?” “What did you learn from the experience?”</p>
<p>They wanted to know, many of them said, because their own companies,
organizations, or governments faced some of the same issues IBM had
encountered during its very, very public near collapse in the early
1990s. Businesspeople outside the United States, confronted with the
need to transform tradition-bound enterprises into tough and nimble
players in a world economy, seemed particularly interested in the
subject.</p>
<p>More recently, after I had announced my intention to retire, I was
amused to read an editorial in an American newspaper, USA Today, that
said, in effect, it hoped Gerstner was going to do something more useful
than write a book and play golf. Nice thought, but since the
announcement, I got thousands of letters and e-mails, and the most
frequent sentiment was, again, that I should tell what I had learned
from my tenure at IBM. (I was also invited to appear in a TV commercial
with golf pros Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.) You might say that I
concluded, a little reluctantly, that the easiest way for me to fulfill
all this “popular demand” was to write a book and to hold off on serious
golf for the time being.</p>
<p>So, here I am, ready to tell you the story of the revival of IBM.</p>
<p>Of course, this book would never have appeared without the heroes
among my IBM colleagues who helped me restore IBM to a position of
leadership. In many respects this is their book as much as it is mine.
There were many such leaders, but clearly among the most important were
Dennie Welsh and Sam Palmisano, who built our services company; John
Thompson, who created our Software Group; Abby Kohnstamm, who took a
cacophony of confused messages and melded them into one of the most
powerful brand statements in the world; Nick Donofrio, who was my
translator from the world of high tech to the world of management; Jerry
York, Rick Thoman, and John Joyce, three great financial executives who
instilled a level of productivity, discipline, and probing analysis into
a company that appeared to value these quite lightly when I arrived;
Larry Ricciardi, my colleague of many years, who brought his intellect
and counsel to many of our critical decisions; and, finally, Tom
Bouchard, who as head of Human Resources stood tall and took the heat as
we transformed the IBM culture.</p>
<p>There are many more. In fact, <strong>there are thousands of IBMers
who answered the call, put their shoulders to the wheel, and performed
magnificently as we undertook an exhausting—at times frightening, but
always exhilarating—journey to restore this extraordinary
company.</strong> To all of them, I dedicate this book.</p>
<p><strong>I wrote this book without the aid of a coauthor or a
ghostwriter</strong> (which is why it’s a good bet this is going to be
my last book; I had no idea it would be so hard to do). I am responsible
for any mistakes or confusion the reader may endure. The views expressed
are mine and are not necessarily those of the IBM Corporation or any
other IBMer.</p>
<p>I did have a great deal of help from some longtime IBM colleagues.
They include Jon Iwata, Mark Harris, and Mike Wing, who made substantial
contributions. Michele Andrle managed production of every draft and
redraft deftly and patiently—an unbelievable amount of stitching and
restitching. I want to thank them and everyone else who helped me.</p>
