<h4 id="drinking-from-a-fire-hose">3 Drinking from a Fire Hose</h4>
<p>On April 1, 1993, I began my IBM career (perhaps appropriately, April
Fools’ Day). IBM’s stock stood at 3.1 An op-ed piece in The New York
Times greeted me with yet more advice on how to fix the company:
“<strong>IBM has plenty of brains and button-downs. What it needs is
bravado.</strong>”</p>
<p>An IBM company car picked me up at my home in Connecticut at 6:45
A.M. and drove me not to the headquarters building, in Armonk, but to
another of the many office complexes IBM owned at the time in
Westchester County, New York. Consistent with my message to the senior
management team the previous week, Ned Lautenbach, who then headed all
of sales outside the United States (what IBM called “World Trade”),
invited me to a meeting of all the country general managers that
happened to be scheduled for that morning.</p>
<p>When I arrived at this large and spacious office building (it is now
the headquarters of MasterCard International), I walked up to the front
door and it was locked. A card reader was next to the door, but I had
not yet been issued a badge by IBM security. There I was, the new CEO,
knocking helplessly on the door, hoping to draw someone’s attention to
let me in. After a while a cleaning woman arrived, checked me out rather
skeptically, then opened the door—I suspect more to stop my pounding on
the door than from any sense on her part that I belonged on the inside
rather than the outside of the building.</p>
<p>I wandered around and eventually found the conference room where the
meeting was just about to begin. I’ll never forget my first impression
of an IBM meeting. Arrayed around a long conference room were all the
nobles of IBM’s offshore, geographical fiefdoms. Behind them was a
double row filled with younger executives. All the principals were white
males, but the younger support staff was far more diverse. The meeting
was an operations review, and each of the executives commented on his
business. I noticed the backbenchers were scribbling furiously and
occasionally delivered notes to the people at the table. It looked like
a United States congressional hearing.</p>
<p>During a coffee break, I asked Ned Lautenbach, “Who are all these
people who are clearly watching but not participating?”</p>
<p>He said, “Those are the executives’ AAs.”</p>
<p>And so it was at my first meeting on my first day at IBM that I
encountered its solidly entrenched and highly revered administrative
assistant program. Hundreds, if not thousands, of IBM middle- and
senior-level executives had assistants assigned to them, drawn from the
ranks of the best and brightest of the up-and-coming managers. The tasks
were varied, but from what I could understand, AAs had primarily
administrative duties and even, at times, secretarial chores. For the
most part, AAs organized things, took notes, watched, and, hopefully,
learned. What they didn’t do was interact with customers, learn the guts
of the business, or develop leadership competencies. However, several
such assignments in a career were de rigueur if one wanted to ascend to
IBM senior management.</p>
<p>I broke away from the meeting late that morning and went to Armonk
headquarters to have lunch with Jack Kuehler. Jack was president of the
company, a member of the board, and John Akers’s chief technologist.
Kuehler controlled all key technology decisions made in the company.
Over lunch he was congenial and easygoing and offered his support.
Consistent with my Akers discussion, it was clear that IBM had an
obsessive focus on recapturing the ground lost to Microsoft and Intel in
the PC world. Jack was almost evangelistic in describing the combined
technical strategy behind PowerPC and OS/2—two IBM products that were
developed to regain what had been lost to Intel in microprocessors and
Microsoft in PC software. The technology plan was sweeping and
comprehensive. It sounded exciting, but I had no idea whether it had any
chance of succeeding.</p>
<p>After lunch I raced back to the World Trade executive session to hear
more about the outlook for our business around the world. In general, it
was not good. I then traveled to yet another IBM building to meet with a
group of young executives who were in a training class. I returned once
again to Armonk to tape a video message for employees, then ended the
day with the head of IBM’s human resources department, the legendary
Walt Burdick.</p>
<p>Burdick had announced his decision to retire before the completion of
the CEO search, but I wanted him to stay for at least a short
transitional period. IBM’s HR department had been well recognized for
years for its leadership in many areas, including diversity, recruiting,
training, and executive development. Walt Burdick had been in charge of
that department for thirteen years, and he was arguably the dean of HR
professionals in America.</p>
<p>What perhaps is not as well known is that Burdick was a powerful
force behind the throne, one of IBM’s highest-paid executives for many
years and a major player in creating and enforcing the dominant elements
of IBM’s culture. His primary interests were structure and process. In
fact, after his departure, someone gave me one of the most remarkable
documents I have ever seen. Roughly sixty pages long, it is entitled “On
Being the Administrative Assistant to W. E. Burdick, Vice President,
Personnel, Plans, and Programs.” It was written on March 17, 1975, and
illustrated some of the suffocating extremes one could find all too
easily in the IBM culture. The instructions for an AA in Burdick’s
office included:</p>
<p><strong>White shirt and suit jacket at all times.</strong></p>
<p>Keep a supply of dimes with you. They are helpful when WEB (Burdick)
has to make a call when away from the building.</p>
<p>Surprise birthday parties for WEB staff should be scheduled under the
heading “Miscellaneous” for fifteen minutes. Birthday cakes, forks,
napkins, and cake knife are handled by WEB’s secretary. AA takes seat
closest to the door to answer phones.</p>
<p>WEB has three clocks: one on desk; one on table; one on windowsill
outside your office. All three should be reset daily. Call 9-637-8537
for the correct time.</p>
<p>WEB enjoys Carefree Spearmint sugarless gum. When empty box appears
in out-basket, reserve box should be put in his desk and new reserve box
purchased.</p>
<p>Burdick and I spent nearly all of our time that day discussing two
critical searches that were under way before I had joined IBM: the
search for Burdick’s replacement, and the search for a Chief Financial
Officer (CFO). The prior CFO, Frank Metz, had retired under pressure in
January following the same board meeting that had created the CEO search
committee. Nothing was more important to me on that first day than
filling these jobs. Parachuting into a 5 billion company that was
hemorrhaging cash and trying to turn it around is a daunting enough
task. Trying to do it without a good CFO and HR director is
impossible.</p>
<p>By 6:30 P.M., I finally had the first quiet time of the day. I sat
with my longtime assistant, Isabelle Cummins, whom I had talked into
coming to IBM despite her desire to retire. Isabelle is an extraordinary
person of enormous talents and one of the many heroes of this book. Had
she grown up in a later era, she would have been a senior female
executive in corporate America, and one of the best. However, that was
not the case, and instead she had been my teammate for fifteen years
before I came to IBM. I talked her out of retiring because I knew it
would have been impossible for me to make it through the early IBM
crises—the toughest ones—if she had not been there. At the end of that
first day, we shared our experiences and both of us felt totally
overwhelmed. (Isabelle, who had always worked with me one-on-one,
discovered that nine people, including several AAs and one person
responsible for creating and maintaining organization charts, reported
to her.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>The next two weeks were filled with meetings with my direct reports,
interviews with candidates for the CFO and HR jobs, and visits to key
IBM sites. One of the most important meetings occurred on my second day.
I had asked my brother Dick to come by and talk to me about the company.
Dick had been a fast-rising star at IBM for many years, having joined
the company right out of college. He had served in Europe and, at one
point, had headed up the powerful Asia-Pacific region. My guess is that
he had been on track to become one of the top executives—a member of the
elite and revered Management Committee—but he was tragically cut down by
undetected Lyme disease at the height of his career. He had gone on
medical leave about six months before John Akers had left, but several
executives had asked him to come back and do some consulting for the
company. His most important task was working with Nick Donofrio, then
head of the Large-Scale Systems Division, to figure out what to do with
the mainframe.</p>
<p>Dick (or Rich, as the family has always called him) and I were close
as children, he being the oldest and I always the follower in his
footsteps—not uncommon, I guess, for two relatively successful siblings.
We went our separate ways in adult life, but we always enjoyed each
other’s company at family gatherings. I never felt any sense of rivalry
as each of us climbed the corporate ladder.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it had to be a poignant moment as he came into the
CEO’s office at IBM and saw me sitting where, quite realistically, he
might have sat had health problems not derailed his career. He came
extremely well prepared. In fact, his was the most insightful review
anyone had given me during those early days. In particular, he argued
against the premise that the mainframe was dead and against a seemingly
hysterical preoccupation in the company to allocate all its resources to
winning the PC war. I quote directly from the papers he gave me: “We
have allowed the info industry to endorse the paradigm that the
mainframe is expensive, complex, not responsive, and workstation
solutions are cheap, simple to operate, and responsive to business
needs. While there is no truth to this paradigm, we have allowed
competitors, opinion leaders, and our customers to exaggerate the
differences. The result is a dramatic falloff in S/390 (mainframe)
sales, increased credibility for Amdahl and Hitachi alternatives, loss
of credibility for CIOs (Chief Information Officers) at major
corporations, and loss of confidence that IBM had the customers’ best
interests in mind in its sales organization.</p>
<p>“We should cut the price of hardware ASAP, simplify software pricing,
focus development on simplification, implement a hard-hitting
communication program to reposition the mainframe and workstations, and
underscore that the mainframe is an important part of the CIO’s
information portfolio.”</p>
<p>As I think back on the three or four things that really made a
difference in the turnaround of IBM, one of them was repositioning the
mainframe. And nobody pointed it out sooner or more clearly than my
brother Dick.</p>
<p>He also gave me a few tips that he labeled “brotherly advice”:</p>
<p>Get an office and home PC. Use PROFS (the internal messaging system);
your predecessor didn’t and it showed.</p>
<p>Publicly crucify shortsighted proposals, turf battles, and
backstabbing. This may seem obvious, but these are an art form in
IBM.</p>
<p>Expect everything you say and do to be analyzed and interpreted
inside and outside the company.</p>
<p>Find a private cadre of advisors who have no axes to grind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call your mom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few months I would have liked more advice from Dick,
but there was a very watchful group of people at IBM waiting to see if I
was setting him up as my own force behind the throne. I didn’t want to
do that to him or to me. We talked several times, but briefly, and not
with the impact his first meeting had on me and the company.</p>
<p>On April 13 I interviewed Jerry York at IBM’s office in New York
City. Jerry was then Chief Financial Officer at Chrysler Corporation and
was one of two candidates I was seeing that week for the CFO job. It was
a truly memorable interview. Jerry arrived in a starched white shirt and
a blue suit, everything crisp and perfect—West Point style. He was not
coy and did not pull any punches. He basically said he wanted the job
and then proceeded to outline a series of things that he thought needed
to be done as soon as possible. I was impressed by his frankness, his
lack of guile, and his candor, as well as his analytical capabilities.
It was clear to me that he was tough—very tough—and just what I needed
to get at the cost side of IBM. I spoke to another candidate later that
week, but I decided Jerry was the right person. He joined us on May
10.</p>
<p>I also saw Gerry Czarnecki, a candidate for the HR job. Gerry was an
operations executive at a bank but had been an HR professional years
before. Over the next couple of weeks we met several times, both by
phone and in person. Although I liked Gerry’s energy and his directness,
I wasn’t certain he was prepared to go back into the HR function. He
said, “Probably not anywhere else, but to be part of the turn-around of
IBM, I’m prepared to do it.”</p>
<p>That turned out to be one of the few hirings that didn’t work out as
planned during my early years at IBM. It soon became clear to me that it
was proving very hard for Gerry to go back and lead the professional HR
community. Within four months he appeared to be acting and sounding more
like a vice CEO. It wasn’t that Gerry’s ideas were wrong—in fact, he was
a major proponent of substantial cultural change. However, the
organization wasn’t going to accept from Gerry what it would accept from
me. He burned his bridges with his colleagues very soon and he left IBM
within a year of his hiring.</p>
<p>Of course, my top priority during those first few weeks was meeting
privately with each of the senior executives. A few of them had prepared
the ten-page briefing I had requested; most of them offered a more ad
hoc analysis of their businesses. In all the meetings over those several
weeks, I was sizing up my team, trying to understand the problems they
faced and how they were dealing with them, how clearly they thought, how
well they executed, and what their leadership potential really was.</p>
<p>The person I relied on most during those early days was Paul Rizzo.
As I said earlier, he had been called back from retirement by the board
to help John Akers. Paul had been a senior executive at IBM for
twenty-two years. After retiring, he became dean of the Business School
at the University of North Carolina and was building a new house in that
state. The last thing he needed was to come back to IBM, but he did
because he loved the company and he didn’t want to see it die.</p>
<p>When I arrived, Paul was responsible for the program of
federalism—breaking up the company into individual, autonomous units.
Not that Paul created the strategy, but in the absence of a CFO, he was
basically overseeing the finance function for the board. He was also in
charge of watching all the investment bankers who were scrambling over
most parts of the company, dollar signs in their eyes as they planted
their flags into each business unit. It reminded me of a gold rush. Each
one saw an initial public offering of stock (IPO) for the unit or units
that he or she advised. We were spending tens of millions of dollars on
accountants to create the bookkeeping required for IPOs because IBM’s
financial system did not support stand-alone units. Paul was also deeply
involved in the financing activities that were under way to raise
additional capital.</p>
<p>For me, asking Paul to stay on was an easy decision, and I’m grateful
he did. Over the next year he was a tower of strength, a wise mentor,
and an insightful partner in evaluating strategy and people—another
important hero of the IBM turnaround.</p>
<p>A special moment occurred during those first weeks of April. I walked
out of my home one morning at my usual early hour. However, when I
opened my car door, I suddenly realized there was someone sitting in the
back seat. It was Thomas J. Watson, Jr., former IBM CEO and the son of
IBM’s founder. Tom literally lived across the street and had walked up
my driveway to surprise me and ride to work with me. He was 79 years
old, and he had retired as CEO of IBM in 1971.</p>
<p>He was animated and, perhaps better stated, agitated. He said he was
angry about what had happened to “my company.” He said I needed to shake
it up “from top to bottom” and to take whatever steps were necessary to
get it back on track.</p>
<p>He offered support, urged me to move quickly, reflected on his own
career, and, in particular, the need he had seen over and over again to
take bold action. <strong>At the end of our ride together, I had the
feeling he wished he could take on the assignment himself!</strong></p>
<p>On April 15 I made my first official visit to a nonheadquarters site.
I had chosen it carefully: the company’s research laboratory in Yorktown
Heights, New York. <strong>If there was a soul of IBM, this lab was
it.</strong> Appropriately named the T. J. Watson Research Center, it
contained the intellectual fervor that had led IBM over decades to
invent most of the important developments that had created the computer
industry.</p>
<p>It was my first “public” appearance inside IBM, and it was important
because I knew this was my greatest immediate vulnerability. Would the
researchers reject me as an unacceptable leader? Some in the company
were calling me the “Cookie Monster” because of my previous job at
Nabisco.</p>
<p>I spoke from a stage in an auditorium. The house was full, and my
remarks were broadcast to an overflow of employees in the cafeteria.
Other IBM research facilities around the world picked up the broadcast
as well.</p>
<p>The stereotype of researchers says they are so focused on big ideas
that they are disconnected from the real world. Well, not these
researchers! I saw the pain of IBM’s problems on their faces. I don’t
know if they were curious or apprehensive, but they certainly came to
listen.</p>
<p>I gave what soon became my stump speech on focus, speed, customers,
teamwork, and getting all the pain behind us. I talked about how proud I
was to be at IBM. I underscored the importance of research to IBM’s
future, but I said we probably needed to figure out ways to get our
customers and our researchers closer together so that more of IBM’s
great foundry of innovation would be aimed at helping people solve real,
and pressing, problems.</p>
<p>There was applause, but I wasn’t sure what they were thinking.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shareholders’ Meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most traumatic event of my first month at IBM was the
annual shareholders’ meeting. It had been scheduled, I’m sure, several
years in advance for April 26 in Tampa, Florida. Needless to say, it was
a daunting challenge to chair my first shareholders’ meeting when the
company had such major and visible problems. I had been there for only
three weeks, could barely identify the products, let alone explain what
they did, or, God forbid, describe the technologies inside them.
Moreover, it was clear IBM’s shareholders were angry and out for
blood—perhaps deservedly so. IBM stock had dropped from a high of 3 a
share in 1987 to 2 a share the day of the shareholders’ meeting. That
was less than half its price at the previous year’s meeting.</p>
<p>There were 2,300 shareholders waiting impatiently for the show to
start when I walked out onto the stage at 10 A.M. that day—in the
biggest convention hall I had ever seen. You couldn’t help but notice a
sea of white hair—obviously, a lot of retirees in Florida owned IBM
stock. I made a brief speech in which I asked for some patience, but I
made it clear that I was going to move quickly, make all changes
necessary, and return the company’s focus to the customer.</p>
<p>I got polite applause, and then the fireworks started. Shareholder
after shareholder stood up and blasted the company, and frequently the
Board of Directors, all of whom were sitting in front of me in the first
row of the auditorium. It was a massacre. The directors took direct hit
after direct hit. The shareholders were reasonably kind to me in terms
of not holding me accountable for the problems, but they also showed
little patience for anything other than a fast recovery. It was a long,
exhausting meeting—for everyone, I think.</p>
<p>I remember flying back to New York alone that evening on an IBM
corporate airplane. My thoughts turned to the Board of Directors. It was
clear from the annual meeting that board changes would be necessary—and
sooner rather than later. I turned to the flight attendant and said,
“<strong>This has been a really tough day. I think I’d like to have a
drink.</strong>”</p>
<p>She said, “You don’t mean an alcoholic drink, do you?”</p>
<p>“I certainly do!” I replied. “What kind of vodka do you have?”</p>
<p>“We have no alcohol on IBM airplanes. It is prohibited to serve
alcohol.”</p>
<p>I said, “<strong>Can you think of anyone who could change that
rule?</strong>”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps you could, sir.”</p>
<p>“<strong>It’s changed, effective immediately.</strong>”</p>
