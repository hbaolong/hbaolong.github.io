<h4 id="the-announcement">2 The Announcement</h4>
<p>Over the next ten days we worked out an employment contract. Doing so
was not easy, for several reasons. The big one was the fact that RJR
Nabisco was an LBO, and in an LBO the CEO is expected to align himself
or herself with the owners and have a large equity position in his or
her company. Consequently, at RJR Nabisco I owned 2.4 million shares and
had options for 2.6 million more. In IBM, stock ownership was a de
minimus part of executive compensation. The IBM board and human
resources (HR) bureaucracy apparently did not share the view that
managers should have a significant stake in the company. This was my
first taste of the extraordinary insularity of IBM.</p>
<p>Somehow we worked everything out, and my next task was to tell KKR
and the RJR board of my decision. That weekend, March 20-21, was the
annual Nabisco Dinah Shore Golf Tournament. Nabisco invited all of its
major customers to the event, and it was important for me to attend. I
also knew that Henry Kravis, one of KKR’s senior partners, would be
there, and I decided that I would discuss my decision with him then. My
name had already surfaced in the media as a candidate for the IBM job,
and I knew that KKR and the RJR board were nervous. In meetings with KKR
over the preceding weeks, there was a noticeable tension in the air. So,
on Sunday, March 21, in my hotel room at the Dinah Shore tournament, I
told Henry Kravis I was going to accept the IBM job. He was not happy,
but true to form, he was polite and calm. <strong>He tried to talk me
out of my decision, but I was firm that there was no going
back.</strong> While we never discussed it, what was implicit in that
conversation was the knowledge we shared that both of us were working on
our exits from RJR. I just happened to finish sooner. (KKR started its
exit a year later.)</p>
<p>The next day, Monday, I returned from California for the beginning of
a very eventful week. The IBM board was meeting a week later. It became
obvious that the search committee had begun to shut down its
operations—because, one by one, the other rumored candidates for the IBM
job started to announce or to leak to the media that they were not
interested in the job. On Wednesday The Wall Street Journal reported
that I was the only candidate; the next day, so did every other major
business publication. It was time to get this whole ordeal over with.
Burke and I agreed to announce on that Friday, March 26. That set off a
mad scramble to organize both internal and external messages in the
midst of a firestorm of leaks and headlines.</p>
<p>IBM made the announcement on Friday morning (even though the cover
story of Business Week, published that morning, already stated I had
taken the job). A press conference began at 9:30 A.M. at the Hilton
hotel in New York City. John Akers, Jim Burke, and I spoke. Burke wanted
to explain the search process that had seemed so public and disjointed
for three months. He made these comments during his opening statement:
“<strong>There was only a handful of people in the world who were
capable of handling this job. I want you to know that Lou Gerstner was
on that original list</strong>, but we then did a worldwide search of
well over one hundred twenty-five names, which we processed and kept
reducing…and pretty well got back to the list that we started with. We
gave those people on the list code names in an attempt to keep it out of
the press—a vain attempt, I might add. You might be interested that Lou
Gerstner was the first person I talked to on that list and consequently
had the code name ‘Able.’ I knew all the other candidates—and I knew
them all well. There isn’t another candidate that could do this job any
better than Lou Gerstner will. We made one specific offer for this job
and only one, and that was to Louis Gerstner. While many people felt
that technology was the key to this, there’s a list of the
specifications that we as a committee put together from the beginning.
The fact is, there are fifteen things on the list and only one statement
of the fifteen: ‘Information and high-technology industry experience
[are] highly desirable, but not opposed to considering extraordinary
business leaders.’ All of the others list qualities which are inherent
in Lou Gerstner.”</p>
<p>I knew my life was changing forever when I walked to the podium and
three dozen photographers surged forward, and I had to conduct an entire
press conference through nonstop, blinding camera flashes. As visible as
American Express and RJR had been, this was something altogether
different. <strong>I was now a public figure.</strong> This wasn’t just
any company—even any very big company. IBM was an institution—a global
one—and its every move was scrutinized by the outside world. <strong>I
was taking on a daunting challenge, and I’d be doing it in a
fishbowl.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>I am by nature a private person and, to be frank, I don’t
enjoy dealing with the press.</strong> On top of that, I looked around
the industry, and as far as the eye could see there were (and still are)
senior executives seeking the highest personal profile they could
manage. I felt then, and I feel today, that while that kind of
relentless publicity seeking generates a lot of coverage, and may even
help the company in the short run, in the long run it damages corporate
reputation and customer trust.</p>
<p>So I faced the cameras and lights that morning with mixed emotions. I
was as full of adrenaline as I had ever been in my life. At the same
time, I knew this was the big show and there was no escaping it.</p>
<p>My own remarks were brief. I was just trying to get through the
ordeal without dealing with a lot of specific questions about why I felt
I was qualified for the job and what I was going to do to fix IBM. But
those were exactly the questions I got in a lengthy Q&amp;A following
the formal remarks. Needless to say, I provided little nourishment for
the reporters. I simply had no idea what I would find when I actually
arrived at IBM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting the IBM Team</li>
</ul>
<p>After the press conference came a series of internal IBM meetings. As
I look back at my schedule, I see that the first meeting the IBM human
resources people had set up was a telephone conference call with the
general managers of all the country operations around the world,
underscoring that the power base of the company was the country
leaders.</p>
<p>We then raced from Manhattan by helicopter some thirty miles north to
the company’s worldwide headquarters, in Armonk, New York. While I had
been in some IBM facilities before as a customer, I had never been in
the headquarters building. I will never forget my first impression. It
reminded me of a government office—long, quiet corridor after long,
quiet corridor of closed offices (quiet that was broken only by the
presence of the almost blindingly bright orange carpeting). There was
not a single indication in the artwork or other displays that this was a
computer company. There was no computer in the CEO’s office.</p>
<p>I was ushered into a large conference room to meet with the Corporate
Management Board—roughly the top fifty people in the company. <strong>I
don’t remember what the women wore, but it was very obvious that all the
men in the room were wearing white shirts, except me.</strong> Mine was
blue, a major departure for an IBM executive! (Weeks later at a meeting
of the same group, I showed up in a white shirt and found everyone else
wearing other colors.)</p>
<p>When John Akers had suggested this meeting earlier in the week, he
had assumed it was going to be simply an opportunity for me to meet the
senior members assembled. However, I viewed it as a critical opportunity
to introduce myself and, at least, set an initial agenda for my new
colleagues. I worked hard in advance organizing what I wanted to say to
the group. (In fact, in researching this book, I discovered detailed
notes I had prepared—something I don’t do very often for informal
meetings.)</p>
<p>After John introduced me, the group sat politely, expecting nothing
more than a “<strong>welcome and I’m delighted to be part of the
team</strong>” salutation. Instead, I spoke for forty or forty-five
minutes.</p>
<p>I started out explaining why I took the job—that <strong>I hadn’t
been looking for it, but had been asked to take on a responsibility that
was important to our country’s competitiveness and our economy’s
health.</strong> I didn’t say it at the time, but it was my feeling that
if IBM failed, there would be repercussions beyond the demise of one
company. I indicated that I had no preconceived notions of what needed
to be done and, from what I could tell, neither did the board. I said
that for each of them (and for me!) there would be no special protection
for past successes. But I clearly needed their help.</p>
<p>I then dealt with what I described as my early expectations: “If IBM
is as bureaucratic as people say, let’s eliminate bureaucracy fast.
Let’s decentralize decision making wherever possible, but this is not
always the right approach; we must balance decentralized decision making
with central strategy and common customer focus. If we have too many
people, let’s right-size fast; let’s get it done by the end of the third
quarter.” I explained that what I meant by right-size is
straightforward: “We have to benchmark our costs versus our competitors
and then achieve best-in-class status.” I also remarked that we had to
stop saying that IBM didn’t lay off people. “Our employees must find it
duplicitous and out of touch with what has been going on for the last
year.” (In fact, since 1990, nearly 120,000 IBM employees had left the
company, some voluntarily and some involuntarily, but the company had
continued to cling to the fiction of “no layoffs.”)</p>
<ul>
<li>bureaucratic,英 [ˌbjʊərəˈkrætɪk] 美 [ˌbjʊrəˈkrætɪk] adj.

</ul>
<p>Perhaps the most important comments I made at that meeting regarded
structure and strategy. At the time, the pundits and IBM’s own
leadership were saying that IBM should break itself up into smaller,
independent units. I said, “Maybe that is the right thing to do, but
maybe not. We certainly want decentralized, market-driven decision
making. But is there not some unique strength in our ability to offer
comprehensive solutions, a continuum of support? Can’t we do that and
also sell individual products?” (In hindsight it was clear that, even
before I started, I was skeptical about the strategy of atomizing the
company.)</p>
<p>I then talked about morale. “It is not helpful to feel sorry for
ourselves. I’m sure our employees don’t need any rah-rah speeches. We
need leadership and a sense of direction and momentum, not just from me
but from all of us. I don’t want to see a lot of prophets of doom around
here. I want can-do people looking for short-term victories and
long-term excitement.” I told them there was no time to focus on who
created our problems. I had no interest in that. “We have little time to
spend on problem definition. We must focus our efforts on solutions and
actions.”</p>
<ul>
<li>morale,英 [məˈrɑːl] 美 [məˈræl] n. 士气，精神面貌</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding their own career prospects, I noted that the press was
saying that “the new CEO has to bring a lot of people in from the
outside.” I pointed out that I hoped this would not be the case, that
IBM had always had a rich talent pool—perhaps the best in the world. I
said, “If necessary, I will bring in outsiders, but you will each first
get a chance to prove yourself, and I hope you will give me some time to
prove myself to you. Everyone starts with a clean slate. Neither your
successes nor failures in the past count with me.”</p>
<p>I went on to summarize my management philosophy and practice:</p>
<p><strong>I manage by principle, not procedure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The marketplace dictates everything we should
do.</strong></p>
<p>I’m a big believer in quality, strong competitive strategies and
plans, teamwork, payoff for performance, and ethical responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>I look for people who work to solve problems and help
colleagues.</strong> <strong>I sack politicians.</strong></p>
<p>I am heavily involved in strategy; the rest is yours to implement.
Just keep me informed in an informal way. Don’t hide bad information—I
hate surprises. Don’t try to blow things by me. Solve problems
laterally; don’t keep bringing them up the line.</p>
<p>Move fast. <strong>If we make mistakes, let them be because we are
too fast rather than too slow.</strong></p>
<p>Hierarchy means very little to me. Let’s put together in meetings the
people who can help solve a problem, regardless of position. Reduce
committees and meetings to a minimum. No committee decision making.
Let’s have lots of candid, straightforward communications.</p>
<p>I don’t completely understand the technology. I’ll need to learn it,
but don’t expect me to master it. The unit leaders must be the
translators into business terms for me.</p>
<p>I then proposed that, based on my reading, we had five ninety-day
priorities:</p>
<p>Stop hemorrhaging cash. We were precariously close to running out of
money.</p>
<p>Make sure we would be profitable in 1994 to send a message to the
world—and to the IBM workforce—that we had stabilized the company.</p>
<p>Develop and implement a key customer strategy for 1993 and 1994—one
that would convince customers that we were back serving their interests,
not just pushing “iron” (mainframes) down their throats to ease our
short-term financial pressures.</p>
<p><strong>Finish right-sizing by the beginning of the third
quarter.</strong></p>
<p>Develop an intermediate-term business strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, I laid out an assignment for the next thirty days. I asked
for a ten-page report from each business unit leader covering customer
needs, product line, competitive analysis, technical outlook, economics,
both long- and short-term key issues, and the 1993-94 outlook.</p>
<p>I also asked all attendees to describe for me their view of IBM in
total: What short-term steps could we take to get aggressive on customer
relationships, sales, and competitive attacks? What should we be
thinking about in our long-term and short-term business strategies?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I told everyone to go out and manage the company and
not to talk to the press about our problems, and help me establish a
travel schedule that would take me to customers and employees very
early. “Let me know the meetings you are scheduled to hold over the next
few weeks and recommend whether I should attend or not.”</p>
<p>I asked if there were any questions. There were none. I walked around
and shook everyone’s hand and the meeting ended.</p>
<p>As I look back from the vantage point of nine years’ tenure at IBM,
I’m surprised at how accurate my comments proved to be. Whether it was
the thoroughness of the press coverage, my experience as a customer, or
my own leadership principles, what needed to be done—and what we did—was
nearly all there in that forty-five-minute meeting four days before I
started my IBM career.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Official Election</li>
</ul>
<p>On Tuesday of the following week, March 30, 1993, I attended the
regularly scheduled IBM board meeting. It was at this gathering that I
was elected Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, effective
to begin two days later.</p>
<p>I walked into the meeting with a certain degree of trepidation.
<strong>Jim Burke had told me a week earlier that there were two board
members who were not totally happy with my selection as the new CEO. As
I walked around the room shaking hands and greeting each of the
seventeen directors in attendance (one was missing), I couldn’t help but
wonder who the two doubters were.</strong></p>
<p>There are several things I remember well from that first meeting. The
first was that there was an executive committee. Three of the eight
members were current or former employees. I was taken by the fact that
this board-within-a-board discussed in more detail the financial outlook
for the company than the subsequent discussion held with the full Board
of Directors.</p>
<p>The full board meeting focused on a wide range of subjects. It seemed
to me from the agenda that it was a business-as-usual board meeting.
There was a presentation from the Storage Division, which was being
renamed AdStar as part of the overall corporate strategy to spin off the
operating units. There were reports on business from the heads of
domestic and international sales, discussion of a regulatory filing, and
the approval of a proposed 40 million acquisition. If the directors felt
there was a crisis, they were politely hiding it from me.</p>
<p>The meeting got a bit more animated during a report on financial
affairs. Among the items reported was that the March quarter’s gross
margin on hardware had declined nineteen points from the prior year and
that System/390 mainframe prices had declined 58 percent over the same
period. The projection was for a loss of 50 cents a share for the
quarter ending the next day. The cash situation was deteriorating fast.
A major item of business was to approve a new financing plan authorizing
the company to increase committed lines of bank credit to .7 billion and
to raise billion through the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt and
securitization of United States trade receivables (selling, at a
discount, “IOUS” from customers in order to get cash sooner).</p>
<p>It was clear there was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the
financial projections. The meeting ended. There were polite statements
of “good luck” and “glad you’re here,” and everyone left.</p>
<p>John Akers and I then met to talk about the company. John and I had
served together on the New York Times Company Board of Directors for
several years, saw each other frequently at CEO-level events, and had a
solid personal relationship prior to his departure from IBM. We were as
comfortable as two people could be under the circumstances. We talked
mostly about people. He was surprisingly candid about and critical of
many of his direct reports. In reviewing my notes from the meeting, I
guess I subsequently agreed with 75 percent of his appraisals. What
struck me was why he could be so critical but still keep some of these
executives in place. He had two favorites. One turned out to be one of
my own. The other I let go before a year had passed.</p>
<p>Regarding business issues, John was preoccupied that day with IBM’s
microelectronics business. I learned that the company was deep into
discussions with Motorola to form a joint venture and, in so doing,
secure a partial exit from what John called the “technology business.” I
asked how imminent the decision was, and he said “very.” Somewhat
related to the Motorola deal was a proposal to license manufacturing
rights for Intel microprocessors.</p>
<p>He said the basic research unit was not affordable and needed to be
downsized. He was quite concerned about IBM’s software business,
mainframe business, and midrange products. As I look back at my notes,
it is clear he understood most, if not all, of the business issues we
tackled over the ensuing years. What’s striking from my notes is the
absence of any mention of culture, teamwork, customers, or
leadership—the elements that turned out to be the toughest challenges at
IBM.</p>
<p>John moved that day to an office in Stamford, Connecticut, and as far
as I know, to his credit, he never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>I went home with a deepening sense of fear.</strong> Could I
pull this off? Who was going to help me?</p>
