<h4 id="appendix-a">Appendix A</h4>
<p>The Future of e-business</p>
<p>My original idea for this addendum was that it would be sufficient to
collect a few of the industry keynote speeches I delivered during my
time at IBM, reprint them as a chronology of how our e-business message
evolved, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Then I reread the speeches.</p>
<p>It was like staring into a large and unforgiving mirror. We got a lot
of it right and accurately called more than our fair share of shots. But
with the benefit of several years’ distance from those speeches, it was
just as clear that we missed a few predictions and trends, and some of
what we thought would be important at the time turned out to be nothing
more than the kind of experimentation and trial runs that are always the
harbingers of true, sustained, technology-driven transformation. So be
it. I’ll stand by our record.</p>
<p>Instead of presenting a retrospective, I’ll outline here how I
anticipate e-business (and the progression of information technologies
in general) will evolve. Following that, I’ll present some observations
on the potential impact on institutions, individuals, and all of
society.</p>
<p>I have to ground this forward-looking discussion with a few
statistical points of reference and acknowledge that three, four, or
five years hence what will follow may seem more quaint than
prescient.</p>
<p>There’s a school of thought that says the world has a new mass medium
when a technology is being used by at least 50 million people. Radio hit
that threshold in about thirty years; it took television thirteen years;
it took cable TV ten years. The Internet set a new standard. Less than
five years after the birth of the World Wide Web, some 90 million people
were connected.</p>
<p>By the summer of 2002 that number exceeded 500 million people. More
than half of them were accessing the Web in languages other than
English. While the estimates vary, several organizations that track this
kind of thing said that worldwide Internet commerce would reach trillion
by 2005.</p>
<p>Without overstating the obvious, suffice it to say that the Net is
more than a communications medium or a marketplace. Its exploitation is,
and will be, the single most important driver of change in business,
health care, government, education, and society. It is the
transformational technology of our lifetimes, and that transformation is
in the very early stages. I expect that the application of networking
technologies will lead the agenda for at least another ten years before
being replaced by biological sciences as the dominant technology in the
world.</p>
<p>But let’s remember that this amazing technology wasn’t always seen
that way, which, as I noted in Chapter 18, is what compelled us to
create a new vocabulary around the term “e-business,” in order to
describe the broader, more powerful aspects of this change.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other world-altering technologies, the Net was ushered
in amid a swirl of confusion and misinformation, and a very heavy
concentration on what it was all going to mean for individuals. Perhaps
you recall it: a celebration of the ultimate in the empowerment of every
man, woman, and child with a Web browser accessing online magazines,
downloading movies to their wristwatches, or buying pet food and flowers
with a couple of clicks or keystrokes.</p>
<p>So, of course, when we at IBM said we believed there was something
bigger happening than chat, browsing, or even online retail, a lot of
people had a good time pointing out that, once again, plodding old IBM
just didn’t get it. And given the mood of those heady, early dot-com
days, what we were saying was pretty boring.</p>
<p>We certainly agreed that the Net was going to change the world. But
our perspective started with what was going to have to happen inside all
of the world’s existing institutions—banks, hospitals, universities,
retailers, government agencies—to change the way they work, transform
physical processes into digital processes, and extend their enterprises
to the Net. Only then were individuals going to be able to do things—pay
a bill, move money around, buy a stock, renew a driver’s license—in
fundamentally different ways.</p>
<p>Our message was essentially this: There is a new technology here that
is going to transform every kind of enterprise and every kind of
interaction. But please understand that this technology—like any other
technology—is a tool. It is not a secret weapon or a panacea. It has not
suspended the basics of marketplace economics or consumer behavior. And
the winners will be found among the institutions that skip the shortcuts
and understand that e-business is just business. It is about real,
disciplined, serious work. And for those willing to do the unglamorous
labor of transforming a process, unifying a supply chain, or building a
knowledge-based corporate culture, it will deliver tangible and
sustainable benefits.</p>
<p>In meetings that IBM hosted globally for hundreds of the world’s
leading CEOs, I liked to draw a comparison between e-business and the
advent of electric power. Before people had the ability to generate
electricity, a lot of what got transported in the world was moved by
mules or horses. Then, over time, the activity of transporting things
was taken over by electric-powered machinery. The industries didn’t
change. The basic activity of pulling and lifting didn’t change. But the
people who made the swiftest transition from the old technology
(animals) to the new technology (machines) became the dominant players
inside their industries. It was almost the same proposition with
e-business.</p>
<p>That first experimental and speculative chapter in the evolution of
e-business is fading from view. A second chapter—a far more serious and
pragmatic period—is under way. Leaders in all industries see the
benefits as well as the practical issues of implementation that they
will face as they cross into the networked world, and they are seriously
charting their individual strategic directions.</p>
<p>This coming phase of e-business will be characterized both by the
technical implications, as well as a set of management and leadership
challenges.</p>
<p>Bringing Down Barriers to Access</p>
<p>If you think about the proliferation of information technology, it
took a remarkably brief period of time, less than forty years, for it to
spread from the hands of a select number of centralized technicians—the
high priests of the mainframe era—to tens of millions and then hundreds
of millions of PC users.</p>
<p>The rise of the Net has made terms like “connected world” and
“universal access” permanent additions to the lexicon of the
twenty-first century. Yet the fact remains that more than half of the
world’s people have yet to make a phone call. The half billion Internet
users I mentioned earlier is impressive for a technology that’s still in
its in-fancy, yet that represents less than 10 percent of the people on
the planet. We’re still a long way from the day when even a narrow
majority of the world’s population is firing up a browser and joining
the community of people with access to the infrastructure of computing
and communications. For the immediate future, then, we don’t have to
debate the existence of a digital divide between the world’s information
haves and have-nots. It’s real. Its permanence, however, is another
matter entirely.</p>
<p>Multiple factors contribute to this divide: disparities in education
and literacy, telephone penetration, and access to electricity. In terms
of computing and communications barriers, there are two:
telecommunications rates, and the cost of the access device itself. Both
are coming down, one faster than the other.</p>
<p>Outside the G8 nations, world governments are taking steps to end
monopolistic telecommunications practices, encourage competition, and
open their markets to network operators and service providers. Most
nations, nearly 80 percent, have opened their cellular markets to
competition, though a majority of countries still retain monopolies
(either state-run or privatized) in fixed-line services for local and
long-distance service. Some citizens of the world can make a local
three-minute call for I cent. Others pay fifty times that.</p>
<p>The second barrier—the expense of the access device itself—is rapidly
being reduced. When the one and only access device was a full-blown
personal computer, surfing the Web was an activity for the rich. But the
world’s entire inventory of hundreds of millions of PCs has already been
eclipsed by an explosion of other kinds of low-cost access devices, from
Net-enabled cell phones to personal digital assistants, game consoles,
or even kiosks in marketplaces or government facilities. Within the next
few years there will be billions of mobile devices (not counting
personal computers) connected to the Net.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the price of entry is no longer an insurmountable
barrier. Yet there are plenty of thoughtful people who assert that
information technology will unavoidably and permanently separate the
world into two camps: those with access, and those locked outside
looking in. I do not accept the inevitability of their argument. It
seems just as reasonable to me that with greater telecommunications
competition, continued innovation by the IT industry, and thoughtful
leadership at all levels of society, there is more than a chance—there
is a magnificent opportunity—to shrink this gulf and spread
unprecedented levels of service and information to people regardless of
their social or political standing or personal buying power.</p>
<p>This proliferation of low-cost access devices is one dimension of the
much more pervasive reach of information technology. But it doesn’t stop
there. Besides all the gizmos that people will actually use, the
technology is literally vanishing into the fabric of our lives: the
clothes we wear, the appliances in our homes, the cars we drive, and
even the roads we travel—plus a thousand other things that we’d never
think of as “computers.” It’s easy to envision a day when everything
worth more than a few dollars will be outfitted with tiny chips, some
storage, and communications capability. The applications are
life-enriching, convenient, fun, practical, and powerful.</p>
<p>As just one example, when every product you own is continuously
reporting its location, and “knows” whether or not it’s where it’s
supposed to be, theft becomes a lot harder to pull off. For
manufacturers and retailers, this all points to the next-generation in
market analysis and customer service. Imagine the power of instantaneous
information on every product they have in the marketplace—how it’s being
used, how much it’s being used, and how it’s performing. It’s like
getting Nielsen ratings on anything and everything—without the overnight
wait. And for people and societies, consider the benefits of clothing
that might warn the wearer of environmental hazards; of buildings whose
architectures can adapt in the event of an earthquake; or water supplies
capable of repelling attempts at sabotage.</p>
<p>It’s all scientifically possible. When we’ll see it, I wouldn’t
hazard a guess. Do I doubt that we will see it all, and more? Not for a
second. Just look at what’s already happened.</p>
<p>When I learned to drive, a car was a mode of transportation. Today
some cars are a node on the Net. Many include a feature that reports the
vehicle’s location to emergency services anytime the air bags deploy.
The world’s leading manufacturer of pacemakers now equips them with
Internet addresses that will one day contact your physician if anything
starts to go wrong. If all kinds of appliances and heavy equipment sense
that a part within them is failing, they can “phone home” to dispatch
their own repair technician or to get the appropriate software download
to fix the problem. IBM scientists are researching an “intelligent”
kitchen counter, which would “read” medicine bottles placed side by side
and issue a verbal warning if that combination of drugs could produce an
adverse reaction. One Japanese company is even making pint-size beer
glasses that would alert the bar staff when the mug is empty!</p>
<p>At each of these intersections—of the technology with devices, with
people, and with the routines of everyday life—the role of the
technology in our lives becomes more pervasive, and more invisible. It
fades from view even as our expectations for what it can do
increase.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what’s happening behind the scenes to enable all
these networked applications is dependent on a secure, global computing
infrastructure. At that end of the computing continuum, things are
taking on unprecedented levels of both sophistication and complexity. If
we’re going to keep moving forward—extending the reach and impact of the
technology by making it easy to use—then masking its complexity becomes
paramount.</p>
<p>Uncomplicating Computing</p>
<p>Enterprises of all kinds increasingly recognize the importance of
entering the world of e-business. It’s either that or consign themselves
to the fate of those turn-of-the-century institutions that decided mule
power suited them just fine. But as customers look down the road to
digital nirvana, they see a road littered with potholes.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, the ubiquity of computing becomes more real every day.
Increasing numbers and kinds of devices are generating additional
transactions, increasing data flows and network traffic, and all of it
is happening with much greater unpredictability in usage and volumes. At
the same time, threats to the security of systems and data are
escalating far beyond what was predicted even a few years ago.</p>
<p>Leaders in the public and private sectors, in businesses large and
small all over the world, know that e-business demands a fundamentally
new kind of information infrastructure. It will be more secure, more
capable, and more reliable than what is in place today. The dilemma (for
them and for the people who make and sell the technology) is that the
infrastructure has become almost impossible for customers to implement
or manage.</p>
<p>The traditional remedy—throwing more people at the problem—simply
won’t work, not in the long term. Complexity is spiraling upward faster
than the capability of humans to deal with it. Around the world,
unfilled IT jobs already number in the hundreds of thousands, and demand
is expected to increase more than 100 percent before the end of this
decade. At this rate there simply won’t be enough skilled people to keep
the systems running.</p>
<p>Therefore, the infrastructure itself—from end to end—will have to be
reengineered to have the ability to perform many tasks that require
human intervention today. What is coming is a kind of computing that
will take its cue from the human autonomic nervous system.</p>
<p>IBM’s research scientists draw many parallels between the way the
human body manages itself—everything from heartbeat to the immune
system—and what is needed in computing systems. Think of it as a kind of
self-awareness that will allow systems to defeat viruses, protect
themselves from attack, isolate and repair failed components, see a
breakdown coming and head it off, and reconfigure themselves on the fly
to take full advantage of all of their component parts.</p>
<p>Autonomic computing won’t be invented or created by one company
alone. That’s why IBM’s technical community proposed in 2001 that this
new realm would become the next great technical challenge for the entire
IT industry.</p>
<p>Joining the Grid</p>
<p>So far the Internet and its communications protocols have enabled
computing systems that were once self-standing—whether you’re talking
about PCs or data centers—to share information and conduct transactions.
In effect, the first stage of the Internet revolution allowed computers
to talk to one another. What’s going to happen next (based on yet
another set of gorpy protocols) will allow networks of computers
actually to work with one another—to combine their processing power,
storage capacities, and other resources to solve common problems.</p>
<p>This kind of massive, secure infrastructure of shared resources goes
by the name “grid computing.” Like many of the mainstream commercial
aspects of information technology, such as the Internet itself, grids
are taking off first in the scientific, engineering, and academic
communities in areas such as high-energy physics, life sciences, and
engineering design.</p>
<p>One of IBM’s first grid projects was done with the University of
Pennsylvania. It’s designed to allow breast cancer researchers all over
the world to collaborate on applications that will compare mammograms of
the same woman over many years, leading to much more reliable detection
and diagnosis.</p>
<p>The Next Utility</p>
<p>Put all of this together—the emergence of large-scale computing
grids, the development of autonomic technologies that will allow these
systems to be more self-managing, and the proliferation of computing
devices into the very fabric of life and business—and it suggests one
more major development in the history of the IT industry. This one will
change the way IT companies take their products to market. It will
change who they sell to and who the customer considers its “supplier.”
This development is what some have called “utility” computing.</p>
<p>The essential idea is that very soon enterprises will get their
information technology in much the same way they get water or electric
power. They don’t now own a waterworks or power plant, and soon they’ll
no longer have to buy, house, and maintain any aspect of a traditional
computing environment: The processing, the storage, the applications,
the systems management, and the security will all be provided over the
Net as a service—on demand.</p>
<p>The value proposition to customers is compelling: fewer assets;
converting fixed costs to variable costs; access to unlimited computing
resources on an as-needed basis; and the chance to shed the headaches of
technology cycles, upgrades, maintenance, integration, and
management.</p>
<p>Also, in a post-September 11, 2001, world in which there’s much
greater urgency about the security of information and systems, on-demand
computing would provide access to an ultra-secure infrastructure and the
ability to draw on systems that are dispersed—creating a new level of
immunity from a natural disaster or an event that could wipe out a
traditional, centralized data center.</p>
<p>Where will this take hold first? I think we’re going to see something
very similar to what we saw when customers started to embrace the Net.
Many of the first implementations were for internal, or intranet,
applications. In the case of on-demand computing, the ability to draw on
a lot of existing resources plays directly to customers’ questions about
how to utilize fully all of their existing IT investments. Rather than
rolling in another piece of hardware, buying a bigger database or more
storage, customers could have a new way to leverage their existing
resources.</p>
<p>The Outer Limits</p>
<p>It’s almost always the case that any particular generation of people
will be forced to deal with at least one game-changing technology—to
understand it, apply it, and regulate it responsibly. In the middle of
the last century, nuclear energy was the best example. The current
generation, on the other hand, will deal with not one but two
game-changing scientific developments. Everything I’ve described so far
relates to the first—the implications for institutions and individuals
associated with networking technologies. The second is what is happening
around the marriage of information technologies with molecular
biology.</p>
<p>The watershed event was the mapping of the human genome. That project
created a data set equal to 10 million pages of information. Yet the
really hard work is ahead of us. One researcher described it as having a
book but not understanding the language in which it’s written.
Deciphering it is expected to require analysis of data sets at least
1,000 times larger than the mapping project itself—another 10 billion
pages of information.</p>
<p>It will be worth the effort. What we’ll learn will lead us to better,
more effective, more personalized drugs, new protocols and treatments
(and possibly cures) for the most intractable diseases, and new
generations of more resilient, higher-yielding seeds and crops. The
point is, there is huge potential here to limit human suffering and do
with scourges like heart disease or AIDS what we’ve already done with
polio and smallpox.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago, antibiotics ushered in the last great advance in
the human life span—about twenty additional years over normal life
expectancies in 1920. We’re on the brink of discoveries that could
deliver another twenty-year expansion, so younger readers of this book
just might be looking at having a lot more time on planet Earth than
their parents have had. And who wouldn’t want it, since we’re not
talking about prolonging an existence already diminished by what we know
today as “old age.” We’re talking about twenty more productive, healthy
years.</p>
<p>The Real Issues Are Not Technical</p>
<p>Before we get carried away by what the technologies are making
possible—at the networked level or at the cellular level—let’s not
forget that the potential societal good is always counterbalanced by an
equally important list of societal concerns. And now that we have
created the potential for both, it is my fervent hope that industry,
customers, governments, and policy makers think through the implications
of what is ahead.</p>
<p>It’s already clear that a networked world raises many issues, such as
the confidentiality of medical or financial records, or the freedom of
expression v. protections of personal privacy. Think about the privacy
implications of what’s coming. What happens to personal privacy in a
world of Internet-enabled cars that monitor our movements at all times;
cell phones that continuously report their location; or Net-connected
pacemakers and other medical devices that are gathering real-time data
on our heartbeat or blood pressure, cholesterol level or blood-alcohol
content? Who’s going to have access to that most personal profile of
you—your physician alone? Law enforcement agencies? An insurance
provider? Your employer or a potential employer?</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned the very real chasm that exists between the
information haves and have-nots, and I expressed my hope that we might
actually apply ourselves and these technologies to bridge that digital
divide. As we do that work, however, I wonder if we’re not in the
process of creating a new, potentially unbridgeable genetic divide,
where some people can afford the cost of preventing a birth defect or
avoiding prolonged suffering, and some can’t.</p>
<p>When advances in diagnosis and treatment converge to deliver on the
promise of a longer, healthier life, have we merely created the
priceless luxury of more time for the people and things we love? Or is
there more to the equation? When that’s possible—or well before it’s
possible—shouldn’t we be thinking about the effect on social structures,
the medical establishment, pension systems, and the environmental
implications of having to produce more food and create more shelter?</p>
<p>Finally, after the events of September 11, 2001, we’ve all been
forced to think about the greatest threats to our way of life, wherever
we live in the world. Is it traditional military aggression? A rogue or
state-sponsored terrorist attack? The danger of internal attack from a
disenfranchised fringe element? There’s no longer any need to say a lot
about state-sponsored terrorism. We all view the world through a
different lens now. One by-product of this new world view is a basic
rethinking of the nature of the threats we face—in all their forms.</p>
<p>Even after September 11 law enforcement and security agencies
remained convinced that the greatest threat to people and societies was
still posed not by weapons of mass destruction but by broad-based
information warfare and what they call weapons of mass effect. No one
equates the loss of human life with the loss of some computer equipment.
At issue is the ability of cyber terrorists to cripple increasingly
IT-intensive military infrastructures, national power grids, water
supplies, or telecommunications systems.</p>
<p>The Leadership Challenge</p>
<p>This book has made the point repeatedly that leaders in both
commercial endeavors and the public sector face a closely related set of
strategic decisions about their exploitation of these technologies,
their willingness to break with the status quo, their investment
policies, and the readiness of their own leadership teams to embrace new
ways of thinking and working.</p>
<p>That’s front and center. Those choices are being made today. Tomorrow
the agenda is going to shift to a set of considerations that revolve
around what this networked world means for our existing geopolitical
structures and all their underlying economic assumptions.</p>
<p>A networked world doesn’t respect the fact that we’ve organized the
world into nation-states and have adapted nearly every convention of
life and society to that model. The course and development of a
networked world is not governed by our concepts of national borders,
regional alliances, or political structure. It’s already dissolving many
of the barriers that have historically separated peoples, nations, and
cultures. And I believe it will drive a concomitant set of challenges to
the ability of political institutions to control the most important
thing they have always controlled—their citizens’ access to information,
education, and knowledge. In the process, we may see a shift in the way
democracies behave.</p>
<p>How will governments arrive at workable policy frameworks in this
globally, politically, and culturally connected world? On the issue of
personal privacy, the European Union has a policy framework that’s
different from that of the United States, and both are markedly
different from the Chinese approach.</p>
<p>Now take a step down from that level of global governance, to the way
any individual anywhere in the world might express his or her political
preferences. Not that long ago the thought of buying a book from your
home or the office would have been considered revolutionary. So what
happens if there comes a day when we can vote from the comfort of our
den or the convenience of our workplace? Set aside what this might do to
boost citizen participation in a representative form of government. Why
not envision global referenda that are representative of a global
populace voting without regard for political affiliations or national
allegiances. What might it mean for individual governments when a world
community expresses an opinion on issues like global warming or an
agreement like GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)?</p>
<p>I think that very soon, if we’re not there already, there’s going to
be increasing conflict between what we would define as national
interests and global interests. So we’re going to be in a situation in
which reaching agreement will require a new level of international
cooperation and global public policy. But how?</p>
<p>Once again, our institutions are running well behind the rate of
technological advancement. Some universities are starting to build
e-business into their business management curricula. But what about
political sciences, ethics, or the law schools? The United States
Congress is one of the most powerful law-making bodies on the planet. To
its credit there are a few committees and a handful of task forces
examining issues like cyber-security, export controls, and intellectual
property rights. But, for the most part, there’s a fundamental lack of
understanding about what it’s going to take to build a workable policy
framework for things like an appropriate tax regime for e-commerce.</p>
<p>In the second half of the twentieth century, the nations of the world
came together to create multilateral institutions designed to foster
economic growth, raise living standards, and forestall armed conflict.
The United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank
are examples. I addressed the OECD in 1998. Much of my talk focused on
the following questions: What is the global parallel of those
organizations for the challenges of the Information Age? What global
institutions do we need to create in order to play a similar stabilizing
and enabling role in the twenty-first century?</p>
<p>All this leads me to consider whether we’re looking at the
requirement for what we might view as a new kind of leadership
competency. It won’t render obsolete the traits of successful leaders in
the physical world. The Net is going to change many things, but not
everything. Passion, confidence, and intelligence will always matter. As
I’ve already noted in the discussion of the current crisis on confidence
in business in general, integrity will matter more than ever before.</p>
<p>Yet I think it’s typically the case that people who aren’t forced to
deal with the technology rarely make the effort to understand either its
possibilities or its limitations. In the nuclear era, maybe that was all
right. But for technologies as pervasive as the ones we’re dealing with
today, I believe we’re going to need leaders in government, business,
and policy-making roles who commit themselves to the challenge of
lifelong learning in order to bring society into sync with the
science.</p>
<p>This next generation of leaders—in both the public and private
sectors—will have to expand its thinking around a set of economic,
political, and social considerations. These leaders will be:</p>
<p>Much more able to deal with the relentless, discontinuous change that
this technology is creating.</p>
<p>Much more global in outlook and practice.</p>
<p>Much more able to strike an appropriate balance between the instinct
for cultural preservation and the promise of regional or global
cooperation.</p>
<p>Much more able to embrace the fact that the world is moving to a
model in which the “default” in every endeavor will be openness and
integration, not isolation.</p>
<p>As someone who’s just spent a decade inside the high-tech industry, I
can say with confidence that its technologies are magnificent creations.
But never believe that the technologies themselves come to us as
self-contained answers. They are not mystical solutions to the most
difficult and most important problems—like bias, poverty, intolerance,
and fear—that have been with peoples and societies for all time. Those
problems yield only to the most intensely human solutions—the kind that
are devised by people of free will and self-determination, who possess
the ability to choose and to decide, to think and to reason, and to
apply the tools at their disposal to generate the greatest benefits, for
the greatest number of people.</p>
