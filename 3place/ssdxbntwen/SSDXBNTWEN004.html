<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>This is not my autobiography. I can’t think of anyone other than my
children who might want to read that book (and I’m not 100 percent sure
they would, either). However, in the spirit of trying to provide some
contextual background for my views, what follows is a brief historical
perspective.</p>
<p>I was born on March 1, 1942, in Mineola, New York—the county seat of
Nassau County, Long Island.</p>
<p>My father started work as a milk-truck driver and ultimately became a
dispatcher at the F&amp;M Schaeffer Brewing Company. My mother was a
secretary, sold real estate, and eventually became an administrator at a
community college. Along with three brothers—one older, two younger—I
lived in the same house in Mineola until I left for college, in
1959.</p>
<p>We were a warm, tightly knit, Catholic, middle-class family. Whatever
I have done well in life has been a result of my parents’ influence. My
father was a very private man with a great love of learning and inner
strength that needed no approbation or reinforcement from broader
audiences. My mother was enormously disciplined, hard-working, and
ambitious for all her children. She drove us toward excellence,
accomplishment, and success.</p>
<p>Education was a high priority in the Gerstner household. My parents
remortgaged their house every four years to pay for schooling. I
attended public grade school, then Chaminade, a Catholic high school in
Mineola. I graduated in 1959 and was almost on my way to Notre Dame when
Dartmouth College offered me a substantial scholarship. It was a major
benefit for our family finances, so I packed off for Dartmouth in
September 1959, without ever having set foot on its campus.</p>
<p>Four years later I graduated with a degree in engineering science. I
immediately went to Harvard Business School for two years. (Back then
one could leave undergraduate school and go directly to business school,
a practice that has since, for the most part, been abandoned by business
schools.)</p>
<p><strong>Then, at the tender age of 23, I emerged from Harvard and
went into business.</strong></p>
<p>I joined the management consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Company in
New York City in June 1965. My first assignment was to conduct an
executive compensation study for the Socony Mobil Oil Co. I’ll never
forget my first day on that project. I knew nothing about executive
compensation, and absolutely nothing about the oil industry. Thank
goodness I was the low man on the totem pole, but in the McKinsey world
one was expected to get up to speed in a hurry. Within days I was out
meeting with senior executives decades older than I was.</p>
<p>Over the next nine years I advanced to the level of senior partner at
McKinsey. I was responsible for its finance practice and was a member of
its senior leadership committee. I was the partner in charge of three
major clients, two of which were financial services companies.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing I learned at McKinsey was the
detailed process of understanding the underpinnings of a
company.</strong> McKinsey was obsessive about deep analysis of a
company’s marketplace, its competitive position, and its strategic
direction.</p>
<p>When I reached my early thirties, it became clear to me that I didn’t
want to stay in consulting as a career. Although I enjoyed the
intellectual challenge, the fast pace, and the interaction with
top-ranking senior people, I found myself increasingly frustrated
playing the role of an advisor to the decision makers. I remember saying
to myself, “<strong>I no longer want to be the person who walks into the
room and presents a report to a person sitting at the other end of the
table; I want to be the person sitting in that chair—the one who makes
the decisions and carries out the actions.</strong>”</p>
<p>Like many other successful McKinsey partners, I had gotten a number
of offers to join my clients over the years, but none of the proposals
seemed attractive enough to make me want to leave. In 1977, however, I
received and accepted an offer from American Express, which was my
largest client at that time, to join it as the head of its Travel
Related Services Group (basically, the American Express Card, Traveler’s
Checks, and Travel Office businesses). <strong>I stayed at American
Express for eleven years, and it was a time of great fun and personal
satisfaction.</strong> Our team grew Travel Related Services earnings at
a compounded rate of 17 percent over a decade; expanded the number of
cards issued from 8 million to nearly 31 million, and built whole new
businesses around the Corporate Card, merchandise sales, and credit card
processing industries.</p>
<p>I also learned a great deal. Early on I discovered, to my dismay,
that the open exchange of ideas—in a sense, the free-for-all of problem
solving in the absence of hierarchy that I had learned at
McKinsey—doesn’t work so easily in a large, hierarchical-based
organization. I well remember stumbling in my first months when I
reached out to people whom I considered knowledgeable on a subject
regardless of whether they were two or three levels down from me in the
organization. My team went into semi-revolt! <strong>Thus began a
lifelong process of trying to build organizations that allow for
hierarchy but at the same time bring people together for problem
solving, regardless of where they are positioned within the
organization.</strong></p>
<p>It was also at American Express that I developed a sense of the
strategic value of information technology. Think about what the American
Express Card represents. It is a gigantic e-business, although we never
thought about it in those terms in the 1970s. Millions of people travel
the world with a sliver of plastic, charging goods and services in many
countries. Every month they receive a single bill listing those
transactions, all translated into a single currency. Concurrently
merchants are paid around the globe for transactions completed by
hundreds, if not thousands, of people whom they do not know and may
never see again. All of this is done for the most part electronically,
with massive data processing centers worldwide. The technology
imperative of this business was something I wrestled with for many
years.</p>
<p>This was also when I first discovered the “old IBM.” I’ll never
forget the day one of my division managers called and said that he had
recently installed an Amdahl computer in a large data center that had
historically been 100-percent IBM equipped. He said that his IBM
representative had arrived that morning and told him that IBM was
withdrawing all support for his massive data processing center as a
result of the Amdahl decision. I was flabbergasted. Given that American
Express was at that time one of IBM’s largest customers, I could not
believe that a vendor had reacted with this degree of arrogance. I
placed a call immediately to the office of the chief executive of IBM to
ask if he knew about and condoned this behavior. I was unable to reach
him and was shunted off to an AA (administrative assistant) who took my
message and said he would pass it on. Cooler (or, should I say, smarter)
heads prevailed at IBM and the incident passed. Nevertheless, it did not
go out of my memory.</p>
<p>I left American Express on April 1, 1989, to accept what some in the
media called at the time the “beauty contest” of the decade. RJR
Nabisco, a huge packaged-goods company that had been formed a few years
earlier through the merger of Nabisco and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company, was rated the ninth-most-admired company in America when the
headhunters called me. The organization had just gone through one of the
wildest adventures in modern American business history: an extraordinary
bidding contest among various investment firms to take the company
private through a leveraged buyout (LBO). The winning bid was made by
the venture capital firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR).
Soon afterward, KKR sought me out to become chief executive of the now
private and heavily indebted company.</p>
<p>For the next four years I became immersed in a whole new set of
challenges. While I understood well from my American Express days the
ongoing demands of a consumer products company, I really spent most of
my time at RJR Nabisco managing an extraordinarily complex and
overburdened balance sheet. The LBO bubble of the 1980s burst shortly
after the RJR Nabisco transaction, sending a tidal wave of trouble over
this deal. In hindsight, KKR paid too much for the company, and the next
four years became a race to refinance the balance sheet, while trying to
keep some semblance of order in the many individual businesses of the
company. It was a wild scene. We had to sell 1 billion worth of assets
in the first twelve months. We had debt that paid interest rates as high
as 21 percent a year. We had lender and creditor committees galore and,
of course, the cleanup from the profligate spending of the prior
management. (For example, when I arrived we had thirty-two professional
athletes on our payroll—all part of “Team Nabisco.”)</p>
<p><strong>That was a difficult time for me. I love building businesses,
not disassembling them.</strong> However, we all have an opportunity to
learn in everything we do. I came away from this experience with a
profound appreciation of the importance of cash in corporate
performance—“free cash flow” as the single most important measure of
corporate soundness and performance.</p>
<p>I also came away with a greater sense of the relationship between
management and owners. I had experienced this at McKinsey, which was a
private company owned by its partners. The importance of managers being
aligned with shareholders—not through risk-free instruments like stock
options, but through the process of putting their own money on the line
through direct ownership of the company—became a critical part of the
management philosophy I brought to IBM.</p>
<p>By 1992 it was clear to all that while RJR Nabisco itself was doing
quite well, the LBO was not going to produce the financial returns the
owners had expected. It was clear to me that KKR was headed for the
exit, so it made sense for me to do the same. This book, which starts on
the next page, picks up my story from there.</p>
