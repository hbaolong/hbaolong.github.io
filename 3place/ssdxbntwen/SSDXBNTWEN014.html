<h4 id="resetting-the-corporate-compensation-philosophy">10 Resetting
the Corporate Compensation Philosophy</h4>
<p>The “old” IBM had very fixed views about compensation; much of it, I
suspect, had been derived from the management philosophy of Tom Watson,
Jr., the man who had created the great IBM of the 1960s and 1970s. Since
the company’s performance during that time had been so extraordinary, it
would be foolish to say it was not an effective compensation system.</p>
<p>Let me briefly describe the system I discovered when I arrived.</p>
<p>First, compensation at all levels consisted predominantly of salary.
Relatively little was paid in bonus, stock options, or performance
units.</p>
<p>Second, there was little differentiation in the system.</p>
<p>Annual increases were typically given to all employees except those
rated unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>There was very little variance in the size of the annual increase
between a top-ranked and a lower-ranked employee.</p>
<p>Increase sizes were in a small band around that year’s average. For
example, if there was a 5 percent increase in budget, actual increases
fell between 4 percent and 6 percent.</p>
<p>All employee skill groups (such as software engineers, hardware
engineers, salesmen, and finance professionals) were paid the same
within a salary grade level, regardless of the fact that some skills
were in higher demand externally.</p>
<p>Third, there was a heavy emphasis on benefits. IBM was a very
paternal organization and provided generously for all forms of employee
support. Pensions, medical benefits, employee country clubs, a
commitment to lifelong employment, outstanding educational
opportunities—all were among the best of any United States company.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, there was little benchmarking of IBM’s
practices vis-à-vis other companies. In a sense IBM was the benchmark
and decided on its own what it wanted to do.</p>
<p>Basically it was a family-oriented, protective environment where
equality and sharing were valued over performance-driven
differentiation.</p>
<p>I was well aware of the strong commitment IBM held for its employees
long before I joined the company. However, as good as it might have been
during IBM’s heyday, the old system was collapsing amid the financial
crisis that preceded my arrival. Tens of thousands of people had been
laid off by my predecessor—an action that shocked the very soul of the
IBM culture. The year before I arrived, limits were put in place on
future medical benefits, setting the stage for cost sharing by employees
and retirees—another very difficult break with the past for IBMers.</p>
<p>The old system was not only out of touch with the realities of the
marketplace, but it was unable to satisfy the paternalistic
underpinnings of the historical IBM culture. Consequently, it made
fixing the company very difficult and made employees sad and cynical. We
needed a whole new approach—and we needed it fast.</p>
<p>Pay for Performance</p>
<p>We made four major changes to our compensation system, and I’ll
describe them in a moment. Behind all of them was a fundamentally
different philosophy than what had been followed in the past, best
described in this list:</p>
<p>OLD</p>
<p>NEW</p>
<p>Commonality</p>
<p>Differentiation</p>
<p>Fixed rewards</p>
<p>Variable rewards</p>
<p>Internal benchmarks</p>
<p>External benchmarks</p>
<p>Entitlement</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>This was all about pay for performance, not loyalty or tenure. It was
all about differentiation: Differentiate our overall pay based on the
marketplace; differentiate our increases based on individual performance
and pay in the marketplace; differentiate our bonuses based on business
performance and individual contributions; and differentiate our
stock-option awards based on the critical skills of the individual and
our risk of loss to competition.</p>
<p>Let me comment now on a few of the specific changes we made.</p>
<p>Stock Ownership</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered where the Watson family fortune is? Certainly
Mr. Watson, Sr., who started at the company in 1914, and his son, who
was CEO during the great growth phase of the company (with both of these
tenures added together, they ran the company for fifty-six consecutive
years), had the opportunity to amass a net worth on the order of the
Fords, Hewletts, and Waltons. Surely there could have been a Watson
Foundation as powerful as the Ford Foundation or the Hewlett Foundation.
But there was no such aggregation of wealth!</p>
<p>Why? It appears that both Watsons had strong views that limited their
ownership of IBM stock. Tom, Sr., never owned more than 5 percent of the
company and refused to grant stock options to himself or other
executives. He liked cash compensation and was paid a salary plus a
percentage of the profits of the company.</p>
<p>Tom, Jr., started a stock-option program in 1956, but it was limited
to a very few executives. Regarding his own ownership, in his book,
Father, Son, and Co., he stated that he stopped taking options in 1958
(he was CEO until 1971), believing that his million worth of options at
that time would be worth tens of millions of dollars in the future.
Apparently he felt that was enough.</p>
<p>It appears that for Tom Watson, Jr., stock options were intended
solely to reward executives—and not to link executives to the company’s
shareholders. In fact, in the aforementioned book, he stated that “the
model corporation of the future should be largely owned by the people
who work for it, not by banks or mutual funds, or shareholders who might
have inherited the stock from their parents and done nothing to earn
it.”</p>
<p>While I think Tom Watson and I share a lot of common beliefs (in
particular, our passion for winning), here we part ways.</p>
<p>I wanted IBMers to think and act like long-term shareholders—to feel
the pressure from the marketplace to deploy assets and forge strategies
that create competitive advantage. The market, over time, represents a
brutally honest evaluator of relative performance, and what I needed was
a strong incentive for IBMers to look at their company from the outside
in. In the past, IBM was both the employer and the scorekeeper in the
game. I needed my new colleagues to accept the fact that external
forces—the stock market, competition, the changing demands of
customers—had to drive our agenda, not the wishes and whims of our
team.</p>
<p>However, beyond their role as a connector to the outside world, stock
options played an even more important role in my early days at IBM. I
had made the decision to keep IBM together. Now I had to make that
decision pay off. I just told you about the role that organization and
branding decisions played in supporting this integration strategy.
Nothing, however, was more important to fostering a one-for-all team
environment than a common incentive compensation opportunity for large
numbers of IBMers—an opportunity that was heavily dependent on how the
overall corporation performed. I repeatedly told my team that we don’t
report software profits per share or PC profits per share—only IBM
consolidated profits per share. There was only one financial scoreboard,
and it was the stock price reported every day in the media. People had
to understand that we all benefited when IBM as a whole did well and,
more often than not, lost out when we functioned as a disjointed
operation.</p>
<p>Consequently, we made three big changes to the IBM Stock Options
Program. First, stock options were offered to tens of thousands of
IBMers for the first time. In 1992, only 1,300 IBMers (almost all
high-level executives) received stock options. Nine years later, 72,500
IBMers had received options, and the number of shares going to
nonexecutives was two times the amount executives received.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that the decision to make options widely
available to employees is not a general tenet of my personal management
philosophy. In fact, I am not a fan of corporate plans that promise a
minimal grant of options to every employee in a company. Most employees
view such options as nothing but a delayed form of salary. As soon as
they can, they cash them in.</p>
<p>However, IBM is different—perhaps from any other company in the
world. As I said earlier, it has, for the most part, a single class of
knowledge workers. Second, it does not have multiple businesses. It has
one gigantic, 6 billion business.</p>
<p>Engineers, marketers, designers, and other employees around the globe
had to act in sync if we were going to pull off the integration of IBM.
I had to have all these people thinking as one cohesive unit, and
granting stock options to thousands of them would help focus attention
on a common goal, a common scorecard of performance. I needed to
convince IBMers they were better off working as a singular
enterprise—one team and not separate fiefdoms. If I could not do that,
my entire strategy for turning around the company would fail.</p>
<p>The second decision regarding stock options involved executives, and
it was far more straightforward: We made stock-based compensation the
largest element of executives’ pay, downplaying annual cash compensation
relative to stock appreciation potential. This is part of my management
philosophy. Executives should know they don’t accumulate wealth unless
the long-term shareholders do the same.</p>
<p>The third, and final, decision regarding options was also based on a
view I hold very strongly. Executives at IBM were not going to be
granted stock options unless they concurrently put their own money into
direct ownership of company stock. We established guidelines that
effectively said: “You have to have some skin in the game.” No free
ride.</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES</p>
<p>The value, in U.S. dollars, of the IBM stock you are expected to own
is determined by your position and a multiple of your combined annual
base salary and annual incentive at target:</p>
<p>POSITION MINIMUM MULTIPLE</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer 4</p>
<p>Senior Vice President 3</p>
<p>Other Worldwide Management</p>
<p>Council Member 2</p>
<p>Other Senior Leadership</p>
<p>Group Member 1</p>
<p>Every executive had to be in the same position as a shareholder:
stock up, we’ll feel good; stock down, we’ll feel pain (real pain—not
the loss of a theoretical option gain). I bought stock repeatedly on the
open market in the early days, because I felt it was important to have
my own money at risk.</p>
<p>A Distasteful Necessity</p>
<p>One historical footnote on the subject of stock options: In 1993 I
used options in a way I find personally distasteful, but which was
necessary because of our financial crisis. I realized that I had no
holding power over key technical and managerial talent at IBM and that
our competitors were systematically raiding us to grab our best people.
I knew that at the time it was important to reduce our overall number of
employees, but in a crisis it was even more important to retain our most
promising people.</p>
<p>I looked around for choices, one of which would have been to
introduce new stock options for key people. However, no shares were
available under the existing stock-option plan, and the only way to get
them would have been to call a special shareholders’ meeting. After the
contentious Tampa shareholders’ meeting, imagine my asking IBM
shareholders for yet another meeting solely to approve more stock for
management!</p>
<p>I decided to offer the people we most wanted to retain an opportunity
to turn in their basically worthless existing options for new,
lower-priced options. I loathe doing this because rewriting the rules
halfway through is not the way to play the game, but I was able to
overcome my personal bias by setting very specific terms that I believe,
in light of the dire circumstances, made this a viable and appropriate
program for shareholders at the company at that time. And we excluded
senior executives. They had played a role in creating our problems. They
had to keep their old options at the old prices and work to solve the
problems.</p>
<p>This was a very important and successful program. I can’t give
specific numbers, but I know it helped to retain a lot of important
people who had been tempted to join competitors but are now in
leadership positions at IBM. Also, it sent a message to
everyone—including the executives who were excluded—that we really
intended to tie our performance to share price and that we wanted to
align our interests directly with those of the shareholders. And,
finally, it sent a message, the first of many to follow, that
compensation at IBM was going to be performance-based, not simply
length-of-employment-based.</p>
<p>Other Changes</p>
<p>I’ve described in detail the changes made to the stock-option program
principally because I wanted to underscore my belief that you can’t
transform institutions if the incentive programs are not aligned with
your new strategy. I’ll conclude this chapter with a description of
several other changes we made to bring the compensation system in line
with the new IBM.</p>
<p>Prior to my arrival, bonuses were paid to executives based solely on
the performance of their individual units. In other words, if your
operation did well but the overall corporation did poorly, it didn’t
matter. You still got a good bonus. This encouraged a me-centered
culture that ran counter to what I was trying to create at IBM.</p>
<p>Therefore, beginning in 1994, we instituted a huge change. All
executives would have some portion of their annual bonus determined by
IBM’s overall performance. The most unusual part of this plan involved
the people who reported directly to me—the highest-level executives,
including those who ran all our business units. From then on, their
bonuses were to be based entirely on the company’s overall performance.
In other words, the person running the Services Group or the Hardware
Group, had his or her bonus determined not by how well the unit
performed, but by IBM’s consolidated results. Executives at the next
level down were paid 60 percent based on consolidated IBM results, 40
percent on their business unit results. The system cascaded down from
there.</p>
<p>Of all the changes I made in 1993 and 1994, nothing else had the
impact that this move had in sending a message throughout the company:
“We need to work together as a team. Gerstner’s not kidding. He really
wants us to make integration the centerpiece of our new strategy.”</p>
<p>We made a similarly bold statement to our employees. In the mid-1990s
we introduced “variable pay” globally across IBM. This was our way of
saying to all IBMers that if the company could pull off its turnaround,
each and every one of them would share in the rewards. Over the next six
years, .7 billion was paid out to IBMers worldwide (with a few
exceptions in countries where this program was not permitted by
law).</p>
<p>The variable pay amounts were also tied directly to overall IBM
performance to ensure that everybody knew that if they worked hard at
collaboration with colleagues, doing so would pay off for them.</p>
<p>The final change we made was the least strategic but the most
controversial: paring back the paternalistic benefits structure. We did
not undertake these changes because we thought the highly generous
support system was bad per se. Believe me, I would have loved to
continue the employee country clubs and the no-cost medical plans. We
cut back on these plans because the company could no longer afford the
level of benefits. The high profit margins of the 1970s and 1980s were
gone—forever. We were fighting for our lives. None of our competitors
offered anything close to the IBM benefits package. (Even now, after all
the changes we made, IBM benefits programs are among the most generous
of any United States-based multinational corporation.)</p>
<p>Also, we changed benefits because the old system was geared to the
company’s prior commitment to lifelong employment—for example, the bulk
of pension benefits accrued after thirty years of service. The new IBM
was not a place where jobs could be guaranteed for life (nor was the old
IBM after it got in trouble). So we had to create benefits programs that
were more appropriate to a modern workforce.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits changes created a great furor among a small
group of IBM employees, but the vast majority of IBMers unselfishly
understood that the changes were absolutely necessary for the company to
survive and grow. More important, IBMers at all levels embraced the
overall shift in compensation philosophy—fewer paternal benefits, but a
far larger opportunity for everyone to participate in the rewards of our
success through variable pay programs, stock-purchase and -option plans,
and performance-based salary increases.</p>
<p>Postscript: The First Year Ends</p>
<p>The first year ended on a very sad note: the death of Tom Watson,
Jr., in December 1993. I had seen Tom only one more time after he had
ridden to work with me that morning in April. He expressed his delight
that I had decided to keep the company (he again called it “my company”)
together.</p>
<p>As I sat in my pew at his memorial service, I couldn’t help but
wonder what he might have thought about the massive changes we had made
in only nine months, and the reactions—both positive and negative—to
these changes expressed by employees and outsiders.</p>
<p>I found myself wishing that Tom and I had had a chance to have lunch
or dinner to talk about the “new Blue” that was beginning to emerge but
still had so very far to go. I felt strongly that like most other great
people who built great things, Tom Watson was at heart an agent of
change.</p>
<p>Exhausted but encouraged, I flew to Florida for my annual Christmas
vacation on the beach. I had a lot to think about.</p>
