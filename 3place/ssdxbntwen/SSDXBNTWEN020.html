<h4 id="opening-the-company-store">16 Opening the Company Store</h4>
<p>So far the logic underlying our big strategic bets has been fairly
straightforward. If you’re going to be a company that designs, builds,
and delivers integrated technology solutions, you need a services
capability. If you already develop and sell more software than any other
company does, and if you believe software is going to be the connective
tissue of the networked world, you ought to run your software business
as, well, a business.</p>
<p>But deciding to sell your leading-edge technologies to your own
competitors? Imagine having the following conversations:</p>
<p>You are talking to IBM’s top technical leaders. They are renowned not
only within IBM but throughout their fields. Many have been inducted
into the most prestigious scientific and technical academies and bodies.
Most have devoted their entire careers to seeing one or maybe two
breakthrough innovations come to market inside an IBM product. Now,
explain to them that you plan to sell the fruits of their labors to the
very competitors who are trying to kill IBM in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Imagine having the same conversation with a sales force that’s
clashing daily with the likes of Dell, Sun, HP, or EMC—companies that
would likely be the big purchasers of that technology.</p>
<p>You can appreciate the internal controversy surrounding the decision
to build a business based on selling our technology components—the
so-called merchant market or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
business. It was just as difficult as deciding to provide services for
non-IBM equipment and enabling IBM software to work with competitors’
hardware. And the controversy wasn’t only within IBM.</p>
<p>Now imagine another conversation. This time you are talking to the
senior leaders of companies like Dell, HP, and Sun. On the one hand,
you’re asking them to buy technology from you, i.e., enter into a
business relationship that makes you money—money that you can put into a
war chest and use to compete against them in the marketplace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you’re asking them to trust you to supply them
with vital components that they will need for their own products,
against which you compete. You promise them that if the supply of those
critical parts should ever become tight, they won’t find themselves over
a barrel, or in one. It’s easy to understand the emotion and the mutual
suspicions surrounding this business.</p>
<p>The announcement in April 1994 that we would mount a serious push to
sell our technology on the merchant market was equal parts business
pragmatism and another roll of the dice that we could succeed in a
business that was just as novel for us as IT services was. Selling
components is a vastly different business than selling finished systems.
The competitors and buyers are different. The economics are different.
We had to build an organization from the ground up. But the upside was
compelling.</p>
<p>The IBM Research Division was far more fertile and creative than our
ability to commercialize all of its discoveries. We were under-utilizing
a tremendous asset.</p>
<p>Dispersing our technology more broadly would drive our ability to
influence the definition of the standards and protocols that underlie
the industry’s future development.</p>
<p>Selling our technology would recoup some of our substantial
RandandandandD expenditures and open up a new income stream.</p>
<p>In a post-PC world, there would be high demand for components to
power all the new digital devices that would be created for network
access.</p>
<p>IBM Research</p>
<p>As I said earlier, it has been well known for half a century that IBM
has one of the most prolific and important scientific research
laboratories in the world. IBM has more Nobel laureates than most
countries do, has won every major scientific prize in the world, and has
consistently been the foundry from which much of the information
technology industry has emerged.</p>
<p>However, the Research Division of the early 1990s was a troubled
place. My colleagues there saw the company being broken up into pieces
and wondered where a centrally funded research organization would fit in
an IBM that was being disaggregated. When they heard I had decided to
keep the company together, the collective sigh of relief that emanated
from Yorktown Heights, New York (the headquarters of our Research
organization) was almost audible.</p>
<p>One of the obvious but puzzling causes of IBM’s decline was an
inability to bring its scientific discoveries into the marketplace
effectively. The relational database, network hardware, network
software, UNIX processors, and more—all were invented in IBM’s
laboratories, but they were exploited far more successfully by companies
like Oracle, Sun, Seagate, EMC, and Cisco.</p>
<p>During my first year at IBM I probed frequently and deeply into the
question of why this transfer of technology invention into marketplace
performance had failed so badly. Was it a lack of interest on the part
of IBM researchers to deal with customers and commercial products? It
did not take long to realize that the answer was no.</p>
<p>The major breakdown was on the product side, where IBM was
consistently reluctant to take new discoveries and new technologies and
commercialize them. Why? Because during the 1970s and 1980s that meant
cannibalizing existing IBM products, especially the mainframe, or
working with other industry suppliers to commercialize new
technology.</p>
<p>For example, UNIX was the underpinning of most of the relational
database applications in the 1980s. IBM developed relational databases,
but ours were not made available to the fastest-growing segment of the
market. They remained proprietary to IBM systems.</p>
<p>Getting Started</p>
<p>The easiest step we could take initially was to license technology to
third parties. This process did not involve selling actual components or
pieces of hardware and software, but it did allow other companies access
to our patent portfolio or our process technology. (“Process technology”
is, as the name suggests, the technology required for the IT industry’s
own manufacturing processes—the skills and know-how to build
leading-edge semiconductor and storage components.) This
effort—licensing, patent royalties, and the sale of intellectual
property—was a huge success for us. Income from this source grew from
approximately 00 million in 1994 to .5 billion in 2001. If our
technology team had been a business unto itself, this level of income
would have represented one of the largest and most profitable companies
in the industry!</p>
<p>However, this was just the first step to opening the company
store.</p>
<p>We moved on from simple licensing to actually selling technology
components to other companies. Initially, we sold fairly standard
products that were broadly available in the marketplace but that,
nevertheless, IBM chose to make for itself. Here we were competing with
many other technology suppliers, such as Motorola, Toshiba, and Korean
semiconductor manufacturers. The principal product we offered in the
market was simple memory chips called DRAMs (pronounced D-RAMS).</p>
<p>Selling commodity-like technology components is a feast-or-famine
business driven not so much by customer demand as by capacity decisions
made by the suppliers. Our DRAM business made a gross profit of 00
million in 1995 (the feast), then proceeded to lose 00 million three
years later (the famine).</p>
<p>We were not naïve about the nature of this business; its cyclicality
was well documented. It turned out, however, that the downturn of 1998
proved to be the worst in the history of the industry.</p>
<p>Why were we in the DRAM business? Well, we really didn’t have any
choice. We had to prove to the world that we were serious about selling
technology components. Most of the potential customers for our
technology were worried (quite appropriately) that they might begin to
depend on us and that we would subsequently decide to turn inward
again.</p>
<p>Consequently, riding the DRAM wave was the price of admission for us
to enter the technology component marketplace. We had essentially exited
the DRAM market by 1999, but by then DRAMs had given us an entry point.
Now potential customers worried less about our reliability as a supplier
or whether we had a serious commitment to this business.</p>
<p>We were ready to tackle the emerging opportunity in the components
business: The change in computing that we’ve been talking about was
driving a fundamental shift in the strategic high ground in the chip
industry.</p>
<p>As I’ve discussed, the action was going to be driven by the
proliferation of Internet access devices, exploding data and transaction
volumes, and the continued build-out of communications infrastructure.
All that was driving demand for chips—and, to our great delight, chips
that would have fundamentally different characteristics from the
lookalike processors that powered lookalike personal computers.</p>
<p>In this new model, value would shift to chips that powered the big,
behind-the-scenes processors. At the other end of the spectrum there
would be demand for specially designed chips that would go inside
millions, if not billions, of access devices and digital appliances. And
in between would be chips in the networking and communications gear.</p>
<p>This is the kind of sophisticated development activity that not only
allows great technology companies to shine, but it also generates
margins that support the underlying investment necessary to lead. Over
the next four years, IBM’s Technology Group went from nowhere to number
one in custom-designed microelectronics. I’m happy to say that PowerPC
has experienced its own renaissance here, quietly reemerging as a
simpler, cheaper, more efficient processor used in a wide range of
custom applications, including game consoles. Just consider that IBM’s
contracts with Sony and Nintendo in 2001 hold the potential to produce
more intelligent devices than the entire PC industry produced in
2000.</p>
<p>As a result—and here’s the important point—IBM, for the first time in
its history, is now positioned to benefit from the growth of businesses
outside the computer industry. This diversification does not take us
away from our core skills; we have simply extended them to entirely new
markets.</p>
<p>Our Technology Group is still young and developing. We can’t yet
declare victory in this, the third of our growth strategies. It is a
piece of unfinished business that I leave for my successor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while the economic benefits of our Technology Group
strategy have been uneven, the underpinnings of the strategy are
powerful and potentially huge for IBM. First, if one believes in the
theory of building great institutions around core competencies and
unique strengths, then exploiting IBM’s technological treasure trove is
an extraordinary opportunity for the company.</p>
<p>Second, the evidence to date is fairly clear: The two companies that
have enjoyed the highest market valuation in the IT industry over much
of the last decade have been component manufacturers—Intel and
Microsoft. Certainly one derives enormous benefit from its virtually
monopolistic position. But there is no doubt that a strategy built
around providing fundamental building blocks of the computing
infrastructure has proven to be extremely successful in this
industry.</p>
