<h4 id="out-to-the-field">4 Out to the Field</h4>
<p>It was crucial that I get out into the field. I didn’t want my
understanding of the company to be based on the impressions of
headquarters employees. Moreover, the local IBM princes and barons were
eager to view the new leader. So the day after the annual meeting, I
flew to France to meet with the mightiest of all nobles—IBM Europe,
Middle East, and Africa (we call it “EMEA”). I visited France, Italy,
Germany, and the United Kingdom, all in one week. It was
dawn-to-midnight business reviews with senior executives, employee “town
hall” meetings, and customer visits.</p>
<p>IBM EMEA was a giant organization operating in 44 countries with more
than 90,000 employees. Revenue had peaked at 7 billion in 1990 and had
declined since. Gross profit margin on hardware had dropped from 56
percent in 1990 to 38 percent in 1992. Very important was the fact that
in the face of this huge decline in gross profits, total expenses had
dropped only 00 million. Pretax profit margin had declined from 18
percent in 1990 to 6 percent in 1992.</p>
<p>Wherever I went, the business message was the same: rapidly declining
mainframe sales, much higher prices than those of our competitors, a
lack of participation in the rapidly growing client/server (PC-centric)
segment, and an alarming decline in the company’s image. One of the most
disturbing statements in my advance reading material was: “We estimate
our net cash change at negative 00 million in 1993. We expect to be
self-funding but will not be able for some time to pay dividends to the
corporation.”</p>
<p>While I learned a lot on this trip—the meetings with customers were
particularly useful—perhaps the most important messages were internal.
It was clear that at all levels of the organization there was fear,
uncertainty, and an extraordinary preoccupation with internal processes
as the cause of our problems and, therefore, a belief that tinkering
with the processes would provide the solutions we needed. There were
long discussions of transfer pricing between units, alternative
divisions of authority, and other intramural matters. When EMEA
executives summarized their action program for the company, number one
was: “Use country as prime point of optimization.”</p>
<p>I returned home with a healthy appreciation of what I had been warned
to expect: powerful geographic fiefdoms with duplicate infrastructure in
each country. (Of the 90,000 EMEA employees, 23,000 were in support
functions!)</p>
<p>I also came away with an understanding that these were enormously
talented people, a team as deeply committed and competent as I had ever
seen in any organization. I reached this conclusion repeatedly over the
next few months. On the flight home I asked myself: “How could such
truly talented people allow themselves to get into such a morass?”</p>
<p>The Click Heard Round the World</p>
<p>As Paul Rizzo had said in our secret meeting in Washington, D.C.,
IBM’s sustainability, at least in the short term, depended heavily on
the mainframe. More than 90 percent of the company’s profits came from
these large “servers” and the software that ran on them. It didn’t take
a Harvard MBA or a McKinsey consultant to understand that the fate of
the mainframe was the fate of IBM, and, at the time, both were sinking
like stones.</p>
<p>One of the first meetings I asked for was a briefing on the state of
this business. I remember at least two things about that first meeting
with Nick Donofrio, who was then running the System/390 business. One is
that I drove to his office in Somers, New York, about fifteen miles
north of Armonk, and experienced a repeat of my first day on the job.
Once again, I found myself lacking a badge to open the doors at this
complex, which housed the staffs of all of IBM’s major product groups,
and nobody there knew who I was. I finally persuaded some kind soul to
let me in, found Nick, and we got started. Sort of.</p>
<p>At that time, the standard format of any important IBM meeting was a
presentation using overhead projectors and graphics on transparencies
that IBMers called—and no one remembers why—“foils.” Nick was on his
second foil when I stepped to the table and, as politely as I could in
front of his team, switched off the projector. After a long moment of
awkward silence, I simply said, “Let’s just talk about your
business.”</p>
<p>I mention this episode because it had an unintended, but terribly
powerful ripple effect. By that afternoon an e-mail about my hitting the
Off button on the overhead projector was crisscrossing the world. Talk
about consternation! It was as if the President of the United States had
banned the use of English at White House meetings.</p>
<p>By the way, in the telling of that story, I’m in no way suggesting
that Nick didn’t know his business. In many ways he was the godfather of
the technology that would end up saving the IBM mainframe, and his
strong technical underpinnings, combined with his uncanny ability to
translate technical complexities into common language, were a great
source of reassurance to me in the days ahead. We had a great meeting,
and there is a straight line between what I heard that day and one early
major decision at IBM.</p>
<p>The Mainframe Decision</p>
<p>In a subsequent meeting in the conference room near my office in
Armonk, the mainframe team documented a rapid decline in sales and, more
important, a precipitous drop in market share in the last fifteen
months. I asked why we were losing so much share, and the answer was,
“Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Amdahl are pricing 30 to 40 percent below our
price.”</p>
<p>I asked the obvious: “Why don’t we lower our prices so they don’t
keep beating us like a drum?”</p>
<p>The answer: “We would lose substantial revenues and profits at a time
when we need profits badly.”</p>
<p>I had hoped to follow the advice of all the management gurus and try
to avoid making major decisions in the first ninety days, but that only
happens in guru world. The company was hemorrhaging, and at the heart of
it was the System/390 mainframe. But almost immediately after joining
the company, I had to do something.</p>
<p>It became clear to me at that point that the company, either
consciously or unconsciously, was milking the S/390 and that the
business was on a path to die. I told the team that, effective
immediately, the milking strategy was over and instructed them to get
back to me with an aggressive price reduction plan that we could
announce two weeks later at a major customer conference.</p>
<p>The financial people gulped hard. There was no doubt that a new CEO
could take the alternative strategy: Keep S/390 prices high for a number
of years, since it wasn’t easy for customers to shift to competitive
products in the near future. The revenue—hundreds of millions of
dollars—would have been a powerful short-term underpinning of a
restructuring of the company. But it would also have been painful for
customers and contrary to what they were pleading with us to do, which
was to fix the problem rather than walk away from it. Over the longer
term, we would have destroyed the company’s greatest asset—and perhaps
the company itself. So we made a bet on a dramatic price reduction on
the product that produced virtually all of IBM’s profit.</p>
<p>We made another important decision that day—or, better said, I
reaffirmed an important decision that had been made a number of months
before I’d arrived. The technical team in the 390 division had staked
out a bold move to a totally different technical architecture for the
System/390: to move from what was known as a bipolar to CMOS (pronounced
“C-moss”) technology. If this enormously complex project could be pulled
off, it would permit substantial price reductions in the S/390 without
commensurate loss in gross profit, thus improving dramatically the
competitiveness of the S/390 versus alternative products. If the project
failed, the 390 was dead.</p>
<p>But it didn’t fail! And the technical wizards from labs in Europe and
the United States who pulled it off deserve a place among the heroes of
the new IBM. I have always been thankful (and lucky) that some
insightful people had made that decision before I’d arrived. My job was
simply to reaffirm it and to protect the billion dollars we would spend
on it over the next four years.</p>
<p>I am convinced that had we not made the decision to go with CMOS,
we’d have been out of the mainframe business by 1997. In fact, that
point has been proven more or less by what happened to our principal
competitor at the time, Hitachi. It continued development of bigger and
bigger bipolar systems, but that technology eventually ran out of gas,
and Hitachi is no longer in this business.</p>
<p>The CMOS performance curve was staggering on paper, and it didn’t
disappoint us. We’re building bigger, more powerful systems today than
anyone ever dreamed about with bipolar technology. So if you want to
think about the return on the billion investment we made back in the
early 1990s, I think one fair measure is high-end server revenue from
1997 forward—9 billion through the end of 2001.</p>
<p>The First Strategy Conference</p>
<p>On Sunday, May 16, I convened a two-day internal meeting on corporate
strategy at a conference center in Chantilly, Virginia. There were
twenty-six senior IBM executives present. Dress was casual, but the
presentations were both formal and formidable.</p>
<p>I was totally exhausted at the end. It was truly like drinking from a
fire hose. The technical jargon, the abbreviations, and the arcane
terminology were by themselves enough to wear anyone down. But what was
really draining was the recognition that while the people in the room
were extremely bright, very committed, and, at times, quite convinced of
what needed to be done, there was little true strategic underpinning for
the strategies discussed. Not once was the question of customer
segmentation raised. Rarely did we compare our offerings to those of our
competitors. There was no integration across the various topics that
allowed the group to pull together a total IBM view. I was truly
confused, and that may have been the real low point of my first year at
IBM. I walked out of that room with an awful feeling in the pit of my
stomach that Murphy and Burke had been wrong—IBM needed a technological
wizard to figure out all this stuff!</p>
<p>I didn’t have much time to feel sorry for myself because that evening
we began what may have been the most important meeting of my entire IBM
career: the IBM Customer Forum.</p>
<p>The Customer Meeting at Chantilly</p>
<p>This meeting had been scheduled well before my arrival at the
company. Nearly 175 chief information officers of the largest United
States companies were coming to hear what was new at IBM. They
represented many of the most important customers IBM had—and they could
make or break us.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, I met with several CIOs at dinner, and they shared
the same perspective I had heard in Europe. They were angry at
IBM—perturbed that we had let the myth that “the mainframe was dead”
grow and prosper. The PC bigots had convinced the media that the world’s
great IT infrastructure—the back offices that ran banks, airlines,
utilities, and the like—could somehow be moved to desktop computers.
These CIOs knew this line of thinking wasn’t true, and they were angry
at IBM for not defending their position. They were upset about some
other things, too, like mainframe pricing for both hardware and
software. They were irritated by the bureaucracy at IBM and by how
difficult it was to get integration—integration of a solution or
integration across geographies.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I threw out my prepared speech and decided to
speak extemporaneously. I stood before my most important customers and
started talking from the heart. I began by telling my audience that a
customer was now running IBM; that I had been a customer of the
information technology industry for far longer than I would ever be an
IBM employee; that while I was not a technologist, I was a true believer
that information technology would transform every institution in the
world. Thus, I had a strategic view about information technology, and I
would bring that to IBM and its customers.</p>
<p>I addressed the issue of the mainframe head-on. I said I agreed with
the CIOs that we had failed in our responsibility to define its role in
a PC world, that our prices were high, and that there was no question
that we were bureaucratic. I shared with them some of my bad experiences
with IBM as communicated to me by my CIOs when I was at American Express
and RJR Nabisco.</p>
<p>I laid out my expectations:</p>
<p>We would redefine IBM and its priorties starting with the
customer.</p>
<p>We would give our laboratories free rein and deliver open,
distributed, user-based solutions.</p>
<p>We would recommit to quality, be easier to work with, and reestablish
a leadership position (but not the old dominance) in the industry.</p>
<p>Everything at IBM would begin with listening to our customers and
delivering the performance they expected.</p>
<p>Finally, I made the big mainframe pricing announcement. Our team had
been working hard over the past two weeks and literally was still
putting the proposal together the night before this big meeting. I
didn’t delve into the details—that was done later in the meeting—but I
made it very clear that mainframe prices, both hardware and software,
were coming down, and coming down quickly. The price of a unit of
mainframe processing moved from 3,000 that month to less than ,500 seven
years later, an incredible 96-percent decline. Mainframe software
price/performance improved, on average, 20 percent a year for each of
the next six years.</p>
<p>This program, probably more than any other, save IBM. Over the short
term it raised the risk of insolvency as it drained billions of dollars
of potential revenue and profits from the company. Had the strategy not
worked, I would have been the CEO who had presided over the demise of
the company—Louis the Last. However, the plan did work. IBM mainframe
capacity shipped to customers had declined 15 percent in 1993. By 1994,
it had grown 41 percent, in 1995 it had grown 60 percent, followed by 47
percent in 1996, 29 percent in 1997 63 percent in 1998, 6 percent in
1999, 25 percent in 2000, and 34 percent in 2001. This represented a
staggering turnaround. While pricing was not the only reason IBM
survived, it would not have happened had we not made this risky
move.</p>
