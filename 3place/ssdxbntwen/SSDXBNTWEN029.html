<h4 id="leadership-is-personal">25 Leadership Is Personal</h4>
<p>I deliberately left the subject of personal leadership to last
because it is, in my opinion, the most important element of
institutional transformation. I mentioned in the chapters on culture
that at the end of the day great institutions are the length and shadow
of individuals. Great institutions are not managed; they are led. They
are not administered; they are driven to ever-increasing levels of
accomplishment by individuals who are passionate about winning.</p>
<p>The best leaders create high-performance cultures. They set demanding
goals, measure results, and hold people accountable. They are change
agents, constantly driving their institutions to adapt and advance
faster than their competitors do.</p>
<p>Personal leadership is about visibility—with all members of the
institution. Great CEOs roll up their sleeves and tackle problems
personally. They don’t hide behind staff. They never simply preside over
the work of others. They are visible every day with customers,
suppliers, and business partners.</p>
<p>Personal leadership is about being both strategic and operational.
Show me a business executive who doesn’t completely understand the
financial underpinnings of his or her business and I’ll show you a
company whose stock you ought to sell short.</p>
<p>Personal leadership is about communication, openness, and a
willingness to speak often and honestly, and with respect for the
intelligence of the reader or listener. Leaders don’t hide behind
corporate double-speak. They don’t leave to others the delivery of bad
news. They treat every employee as someone who deserves to understand
what’s going on in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Most of all, personal leadership is about passion. When I think about
all the great CEOs I have known—among them Sam Walton of Wal-Mart, Jack
Welch of General Electric, Juergen Schrempp of DaimlerChrysler, and Andy
Grove of Intel—I know that the common thread among them is that they
were or are all passionate about winning. They want to win every day,
every hour. They urge their colleagues to win. They loathe losing. And
they demand corrections when they don’t win. It’s not a cold, distant,
intellectual exercise. It’s personal. They care a lot about what they
do, what they represent, and how they compete.</p>
<p>Passion. As a student going through Harvard Business School, I would
never have guessed that passion would be the single most important
element of personal leadership. I don’t recall the word ever being
spoken during my classroom time at Harvard.</p>
<p>In fact I know I was not sensitive to its role in leadership because
of an incident that has stuck in my mind for thirty-seven years. I was
interviewing for jobs toward the end of my last year at Harvard. I had
narrowed down my search to two companies: McKinsey and Procter &amp;
Gamble, the consumer packaged-goods company. At that time, consulting
and consumer marketing were considered the two hottest areas in America
for MBAs.</p>
<p>The incident took place during my last interview with a very
high-level executive at P&amp;G’s headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. I
was an impressionable 23-year-old and had probably never met an
executive as senior as this person.</p>
<p>As the interview progressed, I think he sensed my uncertainty
(indeed, I was leaning at that time toward consulting). He said
something I have never forgotten: “Lou, let’s suppose it’s Friday night
and you are about to leave the office when you get the latest Nielsen
report (market-share data for consumer packaged-goods companies). It
indicates that you have lost two-tenths of a point of share in the last
month in Kentucky. Would you cancel all of your activities for the next
day, Saturday, and come to the office to work the problem?”</p>
<p>I remember being startled by the question, and though I didn’t give
him a definitive answer at the time, the response running through my
head was no. I wound up at McKinsey, convincing myself perhaps that I
was better off in an environment where the requirements were more
“intellectual” and that I would perhaps find it hard to get excited
about decimal-point market-share loss of a toothpaste brand.</p>
<p>How wrong I was. As I’ve stated earlier, a decade later I was
frustrated with the detachment and lack of accountability of a
consultant. I longed for the opportunity to be responsible for making
things happen and winning, winning, winning. That senior executive at
Procter &amp; Gamble was describing the passion that drives successful
executives.</p>
<p>Passion Is for Everyone</p>
<p>All great business executives—CEOs and their subordinates—have
passion and show it, live it, and love it. Now, don’t get me wrong. I’m
not talking about superficial rah-rah optimism or backslapping and
glad-handing. Remember my description of personal leadership. It starts
with the hard work of strategy, culture, and communications. It includes
measurement, accountability, visibility, and active participation in all
aspects of the enterprise. Without that, passion is simply a cheerleader
doing flips on the sideline while the team gets crushed, 63-0 (maybe 8-0
for those of you who follow soccer).</p>
<p>The passion exhibited by true leaders is not a substitute for good
thinking or good people or good execution. Rather, it is the electricity
that courses through a well-made machine that makes it run, makes it
hum, makes it want to run harder and better.</p>
<p>Exhibiting this kind of passion is a part of every top-notch
executive’s management style. Who wants to work for a pessimist? Who
wants to work for a manager who always sees the glass as half empty? Who
wants to work for a manager who is always pointing out the weaknesses in
your company or institution? Who wants to work for someone who
criticizes and finds fault much quicker than finding excitement or
promise? We all love to work for winners and be part of winning. I
believe managers at all levels of a company should strive to develop the
emotional side of their leadership skills.</p>
<p>I wrote about and listed IBM’s Leadership Competencies in the section
on culture. One of them was “passion for the business.” When IBM’s Board
of Directors considered who would succeed me, passion was high on their
list of necessary attributes. Sam Palmisano, my successor, is an
extraordinary executive—a man of many talents. However, he would never
have had my recommendation, despite these many talents, if he didn’t
have a deep passion for IBM, for what it stands for, for what it can be,
for what it can do. He has an emotional, 24-hour-a-day attachment to
winning and to achieving ever-increasing levels of success.</p>
<p>WHAT IT TAKES TO RUN IBM</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Enormous personal energy</p>
<p>Stamina</p>
<p>Strong bias for action</p>
<p>Organizational Leadership</p>
<p>Strategic sense</p>
<p>Ability to motivate and energize others</p>
<p>Infectious enthusiasm to maximize the organization’s potential</p>
<p>Builds strong team</p>
<p>Gets the best from others</p>
<p>Marketplace Leadership</p>
<p>Outstanding oral communications</p>
<p>CEO-level presence and participation in the industry and with
customers</p>
<p>Personal Qualities</p>
<p>Smart</p>
<p>Self-confident, but knows what he/she doesn’t know</p>
<p>Listens</p>
<p>Makes hard decisions—in business and with people</p>
<p>Passion that is visible</p>
<p>Maniacal customer focus</p>
<p>Instinctive drive for speed/impact</p>
<p>Integrity</p>
<p>I want to close this chapter on personal leadership with a few
comments about integrity. All of the great leaders I have known may be
tough (in fact, all of them were tough-minded, which is very different
from some people’s description of “tough”). However, all of them were,
at the same time, fair. Fairness or even-handedness is critical for
successful leadership. Playing favorites, excusing some while others
hang for the same offense, destroys the morale and respect of
colleagues.</p>
<p>This concept sounds simple, but is very hard to carry out every day.
I could not begin to count the number of times during my decade at IBM
when an executive would appeal to me for an exception to our principles
or policies. “John didn’t make his numbers this year, but he tried very
hard. I think we should still pay him a good bonus so that he stays
motivated and doesn’t leave.” “Susan got an offer from a competitor and
I know that if we match it we will upset the compensation scheme in the
finance function, but we have to make an exception to keep her.” “I know
it looks like Carl was involved in a sexual-harassment incident and we
have fired others in similar circumstances in the past, but Carl is too
critical to the success of Project X. He’s very apologetic and will
never do it again. So let’s just slap him hard but not fire him.”</p>
<p>In hundreds of such conversations, there were always two sides to the
story; there was always a seemingly good reason to bend the rules and
make exceptions. And, examined one by one, in every case the executive
can talk himself or herself into making an exception.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, however, if an executive demonstrates that exceptions
are part of the game, then his or her leadership will erode as the trust
of colleagues evaporates. Cultures in which it is easier to ask
forgiveness than permission disintegrate over time. Leaders who don’t
demand uniform and fair adherence to good principles and policies lose
their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>This chapter originally ended here. However, with all the news of
corporate malfeasance that has emerged in mid-2002, I need to add a
postscript. My preceding comments deal with the inevitable challenges
that all leaders face to maintain an environment of fairness and
principled judgment. I did not think it was necessary here to deal with
dishonesty and law-breaking, or with lying and stealing.</p>
<p>No one should be entrusted to lead any business or institution unless
he or she has impeccable personal integrity. What’s more, top-rung
executives have to ensure that the organizations they lead are committed
to a strict code of conduct. This is not merely good corporate hygiene.
It requires management discipline and putting in place checks and
balances to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>If any of these allegations about certain executives turns out to be
true, this is simply unacceptable behavior by bad people. I’m ashamed of
them and embarrassed by them. They are, however, a very small subset of
the corporate world. I believe the vast majority of our business leaders
are good, hard-working people who live up to the standards of integrity
that we expect of all those whom we entrust with power and
authority.</p>
