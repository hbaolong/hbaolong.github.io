<h4 id="execution-strategy-goes-only-so-far">24 Execution-Strategy Goes
Only So Far</h4>
<p>Execution—getting the task done, making it happen—is the most
unappreciated skill of an effective business leader. In my years as a
consultant, I participated in the development of many strategies for
many companies. I will let you in on a dirty little secret of
consulting: It is extremely difficult to develop a unique strategy for a
company; and if the strategy is truly different from what others in the
industry are doing, it is probably highly risky. The reason for this is
that industries are defined and bounded by economic models, explicit
customer expectations, and competitive structures that are known to all
and impossible to change in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Thus, it is very hard to develop a unique strategy, and even harder,
should you develop one, to keep it proprietary. Sometimes a company does
have a unique cost advantage or a unique patented position. Brand
position can also be a powerful competitive position—a special advantage
that competitors strive to match. However, these advantages are rarely
permanent barriers to others.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, more often than not, every competitor
basically fights with the same weapons. In most industries five or six
success factors that drive performance can be identified. For example,
everyone knows that product selection, brand image, and real estate
costs are critical in the retailing industry. It is difficult, if not
impossible, to redefine what it takes to be successful in that industry.
Dot-com retailers were a good example of a spectacular failure to
understand that you cannot suspend the fundamentals of an industry.</p>
<p>So, execution is really the critical part of a successful strategy.
Getting it done, getting it done right, getting it done better than the
next person is far more important than dreaming up new visions of the
future.</p>
<p>All of the great companies in the world out-execute their competitors
day in and day out in the marketplace, in their manufacturing plants, in
their logistics, in their inventory turns—in just about everything they
do. Rarely do great companies have a proprietary position that insulates
them from the constant hand-to-hand combat of competition.</p>
<p>People Respect What You Inspect</p>
<p>At McKinsey my colleagues and I were continually frustrated to see
one company after another invest thousands of hours and millions of
dollars to develop solid, effective statements of strategic direction
and then waste all the time and money because the CEO was unwilling to
drive change through the organization. At other times, the CEO thought
change was taking place in the organization but failed to inspect what,
in fact, was going on.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest mistake I’ve seen executives make is to confuse
expectations with inspection. I have sat through hundreds of meetings in
which strategies—good, solid strategies—have been presented and the
business leader has agreed: “Yes, this is what we’re going to do.” I’ve
seen well-written, sometimes brilliant strategy documents promulgated to
the organization. I’ve seen great video, intranet, and face-to-face
messages describing with excitement and passion a new and daring
direction for an enterprise. But, alas, too often the executive does not
understand that people do what you inspect, not what you expect.</p>
<p>Execution is all about translating strategies into action programs
and measuring their results. It’s detailed, it’s complicated, and it
requires a deep understanding of where the institution is today and how
far away it is from where it needs to go. Proper execution involves
building measurable targets and holding people accountable for them.</p>
<p>But, most of all, it usually requires that the organization do
something different, value something more than it has in the past,
acquire skills it doesn’t have, and move more quickly and effectively in
day-to-day relationships with customers, suppliers, and distributors.
All of this spells change, and companies don’t like to change because
individuals don’t like to change.</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned earlier, IBM knew what was going on in the computer
industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had documented numerous
strategies to deal with a changing world. One document described the
environment as “a sea of speedboats surrounding a floundering super
tanker [IBM].” Newspaper accounts in the early 1990s suggested that my
predecessor was exhorting and pressing the company to pursue new
strategies. So what happened? The strategic requirements were clear, the
CEO was demanding their implementation, but the company stood still in
the water.</p>
<p>Execution is the tough, difficult, daily grind of making sure the
machine moves forward meter by meter, kilometer by kilometer, milestone
by milestone. Accountability must be demanded, and when it is not met,
changes must be made quickly. Managers must be asked to report on their
performance and explain their successes and failures. Most important, no
credit can be given for predicting rain—only for building arks.</p>
<p>I believe effective execution is built on three attributes of an
institution: world-class processes, strategic clarity, and a
high-performance culture. Let me touch briefly on each.</p>
<p>World-Class Processes</p>
<p>Earlier in this section I mentioned that in every industry it is
possible to identify the five or six key success factors that drive
leadership performance. The best companies in an industry build
processes that allow them to outperform their competitors vis-à-vis
these success factors. Think about great companies: Wal-Mart has superb
processes in store management, inventory, selection, and pricing. GE is
world-class in cost management and quality. Toyota is best-in-class in
product lifecycle management.</p>
<p>At IBM we know that the product design function—the process by which
we decide what products to build, with what attributes and features, at
what cost, and at what time to be delivered to the marketplace—is
critical in our industry. (This function is also critical, for example,
to the automobile industry but not, say, to the petroleum industry.)</p>
<p>Consequently we worked very hard for five years to build a
world-class process for product design. It involved millions of dollars
of investments, thousands of hours of work, and, eventually, changed the
way tens of thousands of IBMers worked. (We have done the same thing
with six other processes that we consider crucial to competitive
success.)</p>
<p>Great companies cannot be built on processes alone. But believe me,
if your company has antiquated, disconnected, slow-moving
processes—particularly those that drive success in your industry—you
will end up a loser.</p>
<p>Strategic Clarity</p>
<p>Remember the old saying: “If you don’t know where you are going, any
road will get you there.”</p>
<p>No sports team can score if the players don’t know what play is
called. If everyone has to think about what to do before acting, then
confusion and ineptitude are inevitable.</p>
<p>Companies that out-execute their competitors have communicated
crystal-clear messages to all their employees: “This is our mission.”
“This is our strategy.” “This is how you carry out your job.” But
high-caliber execution cannot simply be a matter of exhortation and
message. Execution flows naturally and instinctively at great companies,
not from procedures and rule books. Manuals may play a role in early
training activities, but they have limited value in the heat of
battle.</p>
<p>Superb execution is more about values and commitments. At American
Express we knew we provided the best customer service in the
industry—not because our training manuals said it was important but
because our people on the firing line, those who talked to customers all
day, believed it. They knew it was a critical component of our
success.</p>
<p>The wonderful sales force at The Home Depot who eagerly seek to help
you when you visit their stores have a clear understanding of their role
in making the company successful. Their behavior emanates from
conviction and belief, not from procedures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, too many companies send conflicting signals to
their employees. “We want the highest quality in the industry,” says the
CEO in January. “We need to cut expenses by 15 percent across the
board,” says the CFO in March. How do the people facing the customer in
this enterprise behave the next time a conflict arises over an important
customer need?</p>
<p>Mixed signals can be pervasive and difficult. For example, IBM, I’m
sure, always preached the importance of teamwork, yet everyone’s pay was
based on individual unit performance. We said we value customers above
all else, but no one in the field could make a pricing decision without
a sign-off from the finance staff.</p>
<p>If you want to out-execute your competitors, you must communicate
clear strategies and values, reinforce those values in everything the
company does, and allow people the freedom to act, trusting they will
execute consistent with the values.</p>
<p>High-Performance Culture</p>
<p>Superb execution is not just about doing the right things. It is
about doing the right things faster, better, more often, and more
productively than your competitors do. This is hard work. It calls for a
commitment from employees that goes way beyond the normal
company-employee relationship. It is all about what I call a
high-performance culture.</p>
<p>High-performance cultures are harder to define than to recognize.
Once you enter a successful culture, you feel it immediately. The
company executives are true leaders and self-starters. Employees are
committed to the success of the organization. The products are
first-rate. Everyone cares about quality. Losing to a competitor—whether
it be a big fight or a small one—is a blow that makes people angry.
Mediocrity is not tolerated. Excellence is praised, cherished, and
rewarded.</p>
<p>In short, businesses with high-performance cultures are winners, and
no person of substance would work anywhere else.</p>
