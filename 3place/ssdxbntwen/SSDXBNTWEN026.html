<h4 id="leading-by-principles">22 Leading by Principles</h4>
<p>In an organization in which procedures had become un-tethered from
their origins and intent, and where codification had replaced personal
responsibility, the first task was to eradicate process itself. I had to
send a breath of fresh air through the whole system. So I took a
180-degree turn and insisted there would be few rules, codes, or books
of procedures.</p>
<p>We started with a statement of principles. Why principles? Because I
believe all high-performance companies are led and managed by
principles, not by process. Decisions need to be made by leaders who
understand the key drivers of success in the enterprise and then apply
those principles to a given situation with practical wisdom, skill, and
a sense of relevancy to the current environment.</p>
<p>“But what about the Basic Beliefs?” you may ask. “Couldn’t they have
been revived and turned into the sorts of principles you’re describing?”
The answer is, unfortunately, no. The Basic Beliefs had certainly
functioned that way in Watson’s day, then for many decades after that.
But they had morphed from wonderfully sound principles into something
virtually unrecognizable. At best, they were now homilies. We needed
something more, something prescriptive.</p>
<p>In September 1993 I wrote out eight principles that I thought ought
to be the underpinnings of IBM’s new culture and sent them to all IBM
employees worldwide in a special mailing. In reading them over now, I am
struck by how much of the culture change of the following ten years they
describe.</p>
<p>Here are the principles and an abbreviated version of how I described
each:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The marketplace is the driving force behind everything we do.</li>
</ol>
<p>IBM is too preoccupied with our own notions of what businesses we
should be in and how they should work. In fact, the entire industry
faces this problem. We are all guilty of producing confusing technology
and then making it instantly obsolete. IBM has to focus on serving our
customers and, in the process, beating the competition. Success in a
company comes foremost from success with the customer, nothing else.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>At our core, we are a technology company with an overriding
commitment to quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a lot of debate about what kind of company we are and should
be. No need, because the answer is easy: Technology has always been our
greatest strength. We just need to funnel that knowledge into developing
products that serve our customers’ needs above all else. The benefits
will flow into all other areas of the company, including hardware,
software, and services.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Our primary measures of success are customer satisfaction and
shareholder value.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is another way to emphasize that we need to look outside the
company. During my first year, many people, especially Wall Street
analysts, asked me how they could measure IBM’s success going
forward—operating margins, revenue growth, something else. The best
measure I know is increased shareholder value. And no company is a
success, financially or otherwise, without satisfied customers.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>We operate as an entrepreneurial organization with a minimum of
bureaucracy and a never-ending focus on productivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will be hard for us, but the new, warp-speed marketplace demands
that we change our ways. The best entrepreneurial companies accept
innovation, take prudent risks, and pursue growth, by both expanding old
businesses and finding new ones. That’s exactly the mindset we need. IBM
has to move faster, work more efficiently, and spend wisely.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>We never lose sight of our strategic vision.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every business, if it is to succeed, must have a sense of direction
and mission, so that no matter who you are and what you are doing, you
know how you fit in and that what you are doing is important.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>We think and act with a sense of urgency.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like to call this “constructive impatience.” We are good at
research, studies, committees, and debates. But in this industry, at
this time, it’s often better to be fast than insightful. Not that
planning and analysis are wrong—just not at the expense of getting the
job done now.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Outstanding, dedicated people make it all happen, particularly when
they work together as a team.</li>
</ol>
<p>The best way to put an end to bureaucracy and turf wars is to let
everyone know that we cherish—and will reward—teamwork, especially
teamwork focused on delivering value to our customers.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>We are sensitive to the needs of all employees and to the
communities in which we operate.</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn’t just a warm statement. We want our people to have the room
and the resources to grow. And we want the communities in which we do
business to become better because of our presence.</p>
<p>The eight principles were an important first step—not only in
defining the priorities of the new IBM, but in attacking the whole idea
of management by process. But that first step would be of little value
if we couldn’t find a way to instill these principles into the DNA of
IBM’s people. Obviously, exhortation and analysis wouldn’t be
enough.</p>
<p>What are the levers of motivation? What can a CEO—or, for that
matter, a head of state or university president—do to change the
attitudes, behavior, and thinking of a population? Of course, different
people are motivated by different things. Some by money. Some by
advancement. Some by recognition. For some, the most effective motivator
is fear—or anger. For others that doesn’t work; it’s learning, or the
opportunity to make an impact, to see their efforts produce concrete
results. Most people can be roused by the threat of extinction. And most
can be inspired by a compelling vision of the future.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, I’ve pulled most of those levers.</p>
<p>Waking Up the Leadership Team</p>
<p>In the spring of 1994 I convened my first senior management meeting
at a hotel in Westchester County, New York. We had some 420 people there
from around the world, representing every part of the company (and a few
reporters in the parking lot waiting—in vain—for news). I had one goal
more important than anything else: to motivate this group to focus its
talents and efforts outside the company, not on one another.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of my remarks began with two charts: one for customer
satisfaction, one for market share. The share picture was startling—a
loss of more than half our share since 1985 in an industry that was
expanding rapidly. The customer-satisfaction chart was just as
depressing. We were eleventh in the industry, trailing some companies
that don’t even exist anymore! I summarized those two snapshots of our
collective performance by saying, “We’re getting our butts kicked in the
marketplace. People are taking our business away. So I want us to start
kicking some butts—namely, of our competitors. This is not a game we’re
playing. We’ve got to start getting out in the marketplace and hitting
back hard. I can assure you, our competitors are focused maniacally on
these charts, and they talk us down constantly.”</p>
<p>I showed photos of the CEOs of some of our top competitors. The usual
suspects—Gates, McNealy, Ellison, and the like. I then read direct
quotes from them belittling IBM, gloating over our fall from grace, and
questioning our importance in the industry. For example, this from Larry
Ellison: “IBM? We don’t even think about those guys anymore. They’re not
dead, but they’re irrelevant.”</p>
<p>“What do you think happened to all those points of market share?” I
asked. “These guys ripped them away from us. And I don’t know about you,
but I don’t like it. And it makes me angry to hear people say things
like that about our company. Every time Visa used to run an ad attacking
American Express, I knew what was going to happen the next day. The roof
was going to come off the building. The general counsel would send for
reinforcements to come into the building to keep people from doing
things they shouldn’t do. I didn’t have to pump up the troops. My job
was to keep them from overreacting.</p>
<p>“You know, I have received literally thousands and thousands of
e-mail messages since I’ve been in this company, and I’ve read every
one. I want you to know that I cannot—I cannot—remember a single one
that talked with passion about a competitor. Many thousands of them
talked with passion about other parts of IBM. We’ve got to generate some
collective anger here about what our competitors say about us, about
what they’re doing to us in the marketplace. This competitive focus has
to be visceral, not cerebral. It’s got to be in our guts, not our heads.
They’re coming into our house and taking our children’s and our
grandchildren’s college money. That’s what they’re doing.</p>
<p>“One hundred and twenty-five thousand IBMers are gone. They lost
their jobs. Who did it to them? Was it an act of God? These guys came in
and beat us. They took that market share away and caused this pain in
this company. It wasn’t caused by anybody but people plotting very
carefully to rip away our business.”</p>
<p>I expressed my frustration and my bewilderment about the recurring
failure to execute and the company’s apparently endless tolerance of
it.</p>
<p>“We don’t demand implementation and follow-up. We don’t set
deadlines. Or when they’re missed, we don’t raise some questions. But we
do create task forces; and then they create task forces. We don’t
execute, because, again, we don’t have the perspective that what counts
outside [the company] is more important than what counts inside. Too
many IBMers fight change if it’s not in their personal interest. There’s
a very powerful word in the IBM vocabulary. I’ve never heard it in any
other company. The word is ‘pushback.’ It’s as if decisions are meant to
be suggestions. Since I’ve been here, I’ve discovered people who are
fighting decisions that were made years ago, while our market share
continues to decline.</p>
<p>“When you have market share like that and a customer satisfaction
record like that, there isn’t a lot of time for debate. We’ve got to get
out and start winning in the marketplace,” I said. “This is going to be
a performance-based culture. I am personally involved in filling all the
new key jobs in this company, because I’m looking for people who make
things happen, not who watch and debate things happening.”</p>
<p>I shared my feelings about our opportunities and our prospects. I
said I considered the people in the room to be the finest collection of
talent assembled in any institution in any industry, and that after one
year into the job I was convinced that IBM had virtually unlimited
potential—but only if we were willing to make the changes I’d laid out.
I then outlined the behavioral changes we needed to make in our culture
(see next page).</p>
<p>“There are no ifs in my vernacular,” I said. “We are going to do it.
We’re going to do it together. This is going to be a group of change
agents—people who are imbued with the feeling of empowerment and
opportunity, for ourselves and all our colleagues. Those of you who are
uncomfortable with it, you should think about doing something else.
Those of you who are excited about it, I welcome you to the team,
because I sure can’t do it alone.”</p>

<p>TO</p>

<p>Not Invented Here</p>
<p>Learning Organization</p>
<p>Fund Everything</p>
<p>Prioritize</p>
<p>It was an emotional talk for me, and I hoped my audience received it
that way. I could tell that for many in attendance it had been a good
meeting—certainly for those who wanted to create change. For the others?
Well, everyone at least expressed agreement. But transforming stated
intentions into actual results was another matter.</p>
<p>In fact, in the following weeks and months I heard that while most of
the executives were very supportive, some had simply been shocked. It
wasn’t so much my ideas and messages that startled them. It was my
delivery—my passion, my anger, my directness (“kicking butt,” for
instance, and “ripping away our business”). Very un-IBM. Very
un-CEO-like.</p>
<p>I wasn’t surprised—or sorry. I had made the conscious decision to
jolt the audience. I hadn’t done anything simply for dramatic effect.
Yes, IBM needed a dose of shock therapy and a gut check. But, more
immediately, I needed my executive team to understand who I was and what
I was like—and I knew only a handful would ever have a chance to work
with me face-to-face. For all kinds of reasons that would unveil
themselves in the future, I had to let them see my competitive side.</p>
<p>So I did. Anyone who knows me would tell you that this wasn’t an act.
I like kicking competitors’ butts. And I hate, hate, hate losing.</p>
<p>A New Path for Leaders</p>
<p>Soon after the meeting things started to change. I could sense a
little excitement and hope. Some executives were beginning to exhibit
the sort of personal leadership and commitment to change that I
sought.</p>
<p>I needed, though, to provide support and encouragement for these risk
takers. They were still surrounded by a lot of Bolsheviks who longed for
the old system. The risk takers needed both a symbol and a structure to
validate their behavior.</p>
<p>This was the inception of the Senior Leadership Group (SLG). Formed
in February 1995, its primary purpose was to focus attention on the
topics of leadership and change. We met for several days once every year
to discuss company strategy, but we spent an equal amount of time on
leadership.</p>
<p>Given the group’s symbolic importance—and the need to infuse it
continually with fresh thinking—I decided it was crucial that membership
not be automatic, not based on title or rank. I wanted living, breathing
role models—regardless of their place on the organizational chart or the
number of people underneath them. A great software designer could be a
leader, or a great marketer, or a great product developer, just as well
as a senior vice president.</p>
<p>Size mattered. The 35 or so executives with whom I met regularly was
too few—but the 420 who had attended that first meeting was too many. I
eventually settled on a cap of 300. No one would have tenure. Every year
a triage would take place: My top executive team would meet and
reconstitute the group. Individuals would be proposed for membership and
would have to garner the support of the entire executive team. The
presence of a new SLG member automatically meant that an existing member
had recently retired, or someone would be told he or she was no longer
performing in a manner commensurate with our expectations for SLG
members. Believe it or not, many of the latter, while very disappointed,
stayed on, with our encouragement.</p>
<p>There was high turnover, and that was constructive. Of the original
members of the Senior Leadership Group, there were only seventy-one
remaining at the meeting in March 2002. This lack of stasis at the
top—combined with some early, visible departures of executives who could
not or would not operate as team players—was important in driving home
the imperative of change. Nothing can stop a cultural transformation
quicker than a CEO who permits a high-level executive—even a very
successful one—to disregard the new behavior model.</p>
<p>I made it a high priority to promote and reward executives who
embraced the new culture. It sent a message to all the up-and-coming
managers that the path to success now wound through a different
landscape.</p>
<p>Specifically, people wanted to know how they could make it into the
SLG one day. Our answer was to create a set of common attributes that we
wanted all of our leaders to have, and to formalize them as “IBM
Leadership Competencies.” Just as we had sought to shift from
process-centric management to an approach based on general
principles—permitting individuals to apply those principles in their own
way, as circumstances dictated—similarly, our leadership competencies
described some essential qualities but allowed for a rich, diverse
leadership cadre of styles, personalities, and approaches.</p>
<p>The competencies (see following page) became the basis for evaluating
every executive in the company. It did not take long for people to
realize that this was going to be how you got ahead in the new IBM.</p>
<p>Moreover, all executives, including those reporting directly to me,
had to “go to school” for three days to work with trained counselors to
understand how they were viewed by their colleagues regarding the
competencies and to develop personalized programs to improve their
skills.</p>
<p>Making It Happen</p>
<p>Although I actively promulgated the principles and built our
management training and evaluation around the Leadership Competencies,
the new ways of doing things were much less codified than what they had
replaced. That was how I wanted it to be—and it did produce a marked
change in our leadership’s behavior and focus (not to mention some
valuable attrition among those who found the new ways unbearable).</p>
<p>IBM LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES</p>
<p>Focus to Win</p>
<p>Customer Insight</p>
<p>Breakthrough Thinking</p>
<p>Drive to Achieve</p>
<p>Mobilize to Execute</p>
<p>Team Leadership</p>
<p>Straight Talk</p>
<p>Teamwork</p>
<p>Decisiveness</p>
<p>Sustain Momentum</p>
<p>Building Organizational Capability</p>
<p>Coaching</p>
<p>Personal Dedication</p>
<p>The Core</p>
<p>Passion for the Business</p>
<p>However, after a couple of years I realized that the cultural
transformation was stalling. The problem was not unexpected; it shows up
in most institutional revitalizations. More IBMers were buying into the
new strategies, and they said they liked the cultural behavior we needed
to execute those strategies. But it all remained predominantly an
intellectual exercise. People believed in the new IBM, but they were
measured and compensated—and continued to work—as if they were still in
the old IBM.</p>
<p>I needed to take our new principles and make them come alive for all
IBMers. To do that I needed to make them simpler and bake them into what
people did every day. And since people don’t do what you expect but what
you inspect, I needed to create a way to measure results.</p>
<p>The initial formulation of the need for more simplicity came in late
1994, after a conversation with one of my colleagues. “Over the weekend,
I counted them up, and there are about two dozen things that you want me
to wake up in the morning and focus on,” he said to me. “I can’t do it.
I’m not that good. What do you really want people to do?”</p>
<p>Thinking back to the senior management meeting earlier that year, my
answer was quick: “Win, execute, and team.” Those three words captured
the commitments I had teed up at the meeting—and they summed up the most
important criteria I thought all IBMers needed to apply in setting their
goals. This would, at its most basic level, define our new culture. This
wasn’t empty cheerleading. I had very specific meanings in mind for each
word:</p>
<p>Win: It was vital that all IBMers understand that business is a
competitive activity. There are winners and losers. In the new IBM,
there would be no place for anyone who lacked zeal for the contest. Most
crucially, the opponent is out there, not across the Armonk campus. We
needed to make the marketplace the driving criterion for all of our
actions and all of our behavior.</p>
<p>Execute: This was all about speed and discipline. There would be no
more of the obsessive perfectionism that had caused us to miss market
opportunities and let others capitalize on our discoveries. No more
studying things to death. In the new IBM, successful people would commit
to getting things done—fast and effectively.</p>
<p>Team: This was a commitment to acting as one IBM, plain and
simple.</p>
<p>“Win, Execute, Team” began as a mantra—spread throughout the company
via multiple media—and eventually took the form of a new performance
management system. Every year as part of our annual planning, all IBMers
made these three “Personal Business Commitments” (PBCs), then listed the
actions they were going to take in the upcoming year that would fulfill
the commitments. The specifics varied by job, of course, but the broad
approach was uniform. And the PBC program had teeth. Performance against
those commitments was a key determinant of merit pay and variable
pay.</p>
<p>Of course, in the end, “making it happen” came down to personal
leadership—not just my own but that of hundreds of IBMers who were
delighted to throw off the old rigidities and behavior patterns, and to
forge a new cultural model. Many of them seemingly burst to the surface,
elated to be released from a system that had been stultifying and
political.</p>
<p>One person deserves special mention here. After my first failure at
finding a new head of Human Resources, I hired Tom Bouchard, who had
been the top HR person at U.S. West, Inc., and, before that, at United
Technologies Corporation. “Bulldog” comes to mind when you think about
Tom: a bright, savvy, practical, and hard-working businessman. He was
not a traditional HR type; rather, he was a no-nonsense businessman.
More than anyone else, he drove our cultural transformation and
therefore deserves recognition as one of the heroes of IBM’s
transformation.</p>
<p>Declaring Our Moon Shot</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how the past keeps getting better the further
into the future you go? Someone once said that the only paradises we
have are those that are lost. I think that person must have worked for a
legendary business empire like IBM.</p>
<p>The company’s golden age—much of it reality, but at least part of it
illusion—had such a powerful hold on the imaginations and the hearts of
some IBMers that every change was perceived as a change for the worse.
They wanted time to stop, despite the realities of the marketplace and
societal change.</p>
<p>Our greatest ally in shaking loose the past, as it turned out, was
IBM’s own precipitous collapse. However, I knew the memory of that
wouldn’t last forever. Therefore, rather than go with the usual
corporate impulse to put on a happy face, spin things optimistically,
and declare the turnaround over as soon as possible, I decided to keep
the crisis front and center—not irresponsibly; I didn’t shout fire in a
crowded company. But I didn’t want to lose a sense of urgency
prematurely.</p>
<p>There came a time, however, when it was clear to all that the
company’s life-or-death crisis was over. The prospect of institutional
death had helped IBMers break from the past. What would be the means by
which we could embrace the future? The answer to that came in our
e-business strategy. I have already described it as an integrating
program for the company on a strategic and operational level, and it was
all that. But the appeal of e-business to me was actually even greater
for what it would do internally—for our people.</p>
<p>I decided to declare e-business as our “moon shot,” our galvanizing
mission, an equivalent of the System/360 for a new era. We infused it
into everything—not just our advertising, product planning, research
agendas, and customer meetings, but throughout our communications and
operations—from my e-mails, broadcasts, and town hall visits to the way
in which we measured our internal transformation. It provided a powerful
context for all of our businesses. It gave us both a marketplace-based
mission and a new ground for our own behaviors and operating
practices—in other words, culture.</p>
<p>Most important, it was outward-facing. We were no longer focused on
turning ourselves around. We were focused on setting the industry agenda
again. We shifted the internal discussion from “What do we want to be?”
to “What do we want to do?”</p>
<p>Restless Self-Renewal</p>
<p>I came to realize soon after arriving at IBM that there were—and
are—tremendous strengths in the company’s culture—characteristics no one
would want to lose. If we could excise the bad stuff and reanimate the
good, what resulted would be an unbeatable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>As I write this, the battle is not over. IBM has, in effect,
undergone vast culture change. The “new Blue”—tied to our e-business
strategy and focused on the market’s most promising growth
opportunities—is beginning to take off. IBMers are energized, motivated,
and stimulated as they haven’t been in a long time. IBM the
Leader—though very different from IBM the Leader of an earlier era—is
becoming embedded in the minds of more than 300,000 of the brightest
people on the planet.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? One of two things will happen over the next
five years:</p>
<p>Perhaps we will fall once again into the trap of codification. Win,
Execute, Team will become platitudes, the same fate that befell the
Basic Beliefs. The SLG will become the IBM Management Committee of
yore.</p>
<p>Maybe, on the other hand, we’ll figure out a way to hold on to our
new-found edge and agility. Maybe we can practice continual, restless
self-renewal as a permanent feature of our corporate culture.</p>
<p>This is something that only a handful of institutions ever achieved
over an extended period of time. IBM has forged ahead, through a
combination of circumstances, heritage, hard work—and luck—to a position
where it is now pioneering a new kind of business enterprise—the
counterintuitive corporation. I noted some of its characteristics in my
final Letter to Shareholders in our 2001 Annual Report:</p>
<p>…big but fast; entrepreneurial and disciplined; at once scientific
and market-driven; able to create intellectual capital on a worldwide
scale, and to deliver it to a customer of one. This new breed
continually learns, changes, and renews itself. It is tough and
focused—but open to new ideas. It abhors bureaucracy, dissembling, and
politicking. It rewards results. Above all, it covets talent and passion
for everything it does.</p>
<p>Building on decades of experience, knowledge, maturity, and
character, IBM over the past ten years has begun to develop the ability
to handle a very high level of internal complexity and even apparent
contradiction. Rather than hiding from conflict or suppressing it, we’re
learning how to manage it, even benefit from it. This equilibrium can be
achieved only when an enterprise has a very sure sense of self.</p>
<p>Sustaining that balance will be tough, but I am optimistic. Something
has stirred inside this once sleeping giant. Its people have been
reawakened to who they are, what they are, what they can do. Their pride
has been reinstilled and their hope regenerated.</p>
<p>Besides, the marketplace we’re now living in—the most dynamic,
competitive, global economy (not to mention political, cultural, and
social environment) in recorded history—will help. As long as IBMers
remain focused outward, the world will keep them on their toes.</p>
<h2 id="part-iv-lessons-learned">PART IV Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>What did I learn from my IBM experience? What lessons have I
accumulated during the course of more than three decades in business?
These are questions I get asked a lot these days. And I always preface
my answer with the same concerns and hesitancy: I’ve never been certain
that I can abstract from my experiences a handful of lessons that others
can apply to their own situations.</p>
<p>Beyond that highly pragmatic consideration, I have more than a
sneaking suspicion that what I am prepared to offer here will not
surprise, astonish, or delight the reader who has come in search of
something resembling a secret formula, or a directory of timeless
revelations.</p>
<p>The work-a-day world of business isn’t about fads or miracles. There
are fundamentals that characterize successful enterprises and successful
executives.</p>
<p>They are focused.</p>
<p>They are superb at execution.</p>
<p>They abound with personal leadership.</p>
<p>If not immutable, these three are at least consistent, through the
ups and downs of economic cycles, through changes in the leadership of
any particular institution, and through technical revolutions, the likes
of which we just experienced with the Internet. They apply to
enterprises of all sizes and types: large and small companies, publicly
traded and non-profit organizations, universities and, in part,
governments. At the end of this part of the book, I will address a final
issue that is unique to the largest and most complex institutions: how
to strike the appropriate balance between integration and
decentralization.</p>
