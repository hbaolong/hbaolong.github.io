<h4 id="ibm-a-farewell">27 IBM-a Farewell</h4>
<p>As I take my leave of IBM, I am experiencing a flood of unexpected
feelings.</p>
<p>I left McKinsey at the age of 35, happy with what I’d learned and
raring to go to a new life as an operating executive. Partners
frequently depart McKinsey to join their clients; I was simply following
a path created by others.</p>
<p>I left American Express after eleven years primarily because I
disagreed with the overall corporate strategy being pursued at the time.
Had events been different at American Express, I might have remained
there to this day.</p>
<p>As I have already said, the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco was
doomed from the start, so my leaving there was a well-timed exit, but it
was also a response to the enormously exciting challenge of trying to
lead the turnaround of IBM.</p>
<p>My feelings as I leave IBM are quite different from those earlier
transitions. With all my other moves, I was always looking forward to
the future, to new challenges. While I am excited about the new life I
am constructing for my post-IBM years, I find myself in the final months
of my IBM career looking back—more than I have ever done before.</p>
<p>I came to IBM as an outsider, a force for change. I had to make a lot
of difficult decisions, wrench the company in ways it did not want to
go. Along the way, in my heart I became a “true Blue” IBMer.
Interestingly, this outsider occupied the CEO’s office longer than any
IBM Chief Executive Officer other than the Watsons. Here is the letter I
wrote to my colleagues to announce my retirement:</p>
<p>January 29, 2002</p>
<p>L. V. Gerstner, Jr.</p>
<p>Office of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p>Subject: CEO Transition</p>
<p>Dear Colleague:</p>
<p>When I joined IBM on April 1, 1993, there was no thought about my
retirement date. The Board of Directors asked me to focus on one
short-term objective: save the company. Given my very limited knowledge
of IBM at the time, I quite honestly did not know if that could be done.
I certainly didn’t know how long it might take.</p>
<p>Well, with the support and leadership of thousands of IBMers, we did
turn the company around. That work, and my original mandate, was largely
completed by the mid-nineties. But along the way, something
happened—something that, quite frankly, surprised me. I fell in love
with IBM. I decided, like many of you, that this was the best company in
the world at which to spend my career. IBM is a fascinating, important,
frustrating, exhausting, and fulfilling experience—and I’ve enjoyed
every minute (well, maybe not every minute)!</p>
<p>But here we are nearly nine years later, and now it is time to
address retirement. I have always used these e-mails to speak with you
about the most important developments and our strategic direction. I
want to do that again now. Moments ago, the Board of Directors elected
Sam Palmisano to be Chief Executive Officer of our company, effective
March 1, 2002. Also, John Thompson, Vice Chairman, announced his
intention to retire from the company and the board on September 1, 2002.
I know the entire IBM team joins me in thanking John for thirty-six
stellar years of IBM service—a wonderful career that included building
our software business, and that culminated with focusing the way we
identify and pursue new market opportunities.</p>
<p>At the board’s request, as well as Sam’s, I will remain as chairman
until the end of this year. From March 1 on, Sam is our new leader. My
job will be to help him in whatever ways he seeks my time and
counsel.</p>
<p>Let me say something about the timing of this transition, because
some people believe IBM CEOS are required to step aside at age sixty.
That’s not so. There is no rule or age limit that requires me to do this
now. I am doing it because I am convinced that the time is right. The
company is ready, and so is the new leader. I have never felt more
optimistic and confident about our future. And those are the best
circumstances under which to make this sort of change.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Sam and I have forged a strong partnership
to prepare the company for a transition in leadership. Supported by a
fine Board of Directors, we have undertaken a process that has been
disciplined, transparent, and thorough.</p>
<p>Many of you know Sam. Thousands of you have worked for him. He’s an
exceptional leader, passionate about our business, committed to our
principles and values, and steeped in the disciplines that are critical
to our success. Beyond those critical qualities, Sam bleeds Blue. And
because he does, he understands the character of our company at its
soul, the incredible world-changing things it alone can accomplish—and
how it must continue to change in the years ahead. I know you will give
Sam all the support you so generously provided me over many years.</p>
<p>It has been the privilege of a lifetime working with you these past
nine years. I am so proud of so many things that we have accomplished,
far too many to list in this e-mail. All our hard work has brought IBM
back. Today, our strategies are correct. Our capacity to innovate is
unmatched. Our culture is moving in the right direction. And we have
restored the pride all of us feel in this company. Those were pretty
remote targets back in 1993, when so many had written us off and so few
believed we had the will to survive. But in your gritty, classy,
determined way, you never gave up. Thank you for restoring IBM’s
leadership.</p>
<p>As I said, after March 1, I’ll be available to help Sam and the
entire leadership team in any way I can. And long after I step aside as
chairman, I want you to know that I will be cheering and rooting for
this magnificent company and its extraordinary people. I am an IBMer for
life.</p>
<p>As much as I meant those words, and as much as I treasure the
thousands of wonderful expressions of appreciation I received from IBM
employees, I now realize that I was always—even to the end—an
outsider.</p>
<p>My most senior colleagues—Sam Palmisano, John Thompson, Nick
Donofrio, and others—who worked side by side with me and deserve as much
credit as I do for IBM’s renaissance, share a perspective I will never
have. They have lived their business careers at IBM. They have seen it
all: the glory days, the agony days, the turnaround days. Their roots
are deeper than mine, their experience richer.</p>
<p>For me, IBM pre-April 1, 1993, is a mansion full of many rooms but
without doors. I never entered it. I dreaded going into that house. I
had to drive change, and I knew that all the reasons not to change were
in those rooms. I can recall numerous occasions in the early days when I
would outline a change I thought was necessary, and my team would say:
“Oh, we tried that before and it didn’t work.” I couldn’t explore the
“befores” or I’d learn all the reasons not to change.</p>
<p>Yet on occasion I would hear my colleagues reminisce about special
experiences, both joyous and painful, that shaped their lives or shaped
the company. I recently asked one of my colleagues to tell me about the
CEOs who preceded me—the men who took over from Tom Watson. It was a
fascinating hour for me, and I wish my time at IBM would have allowed me
to make the connections from the old to the new; not the strategic or
the cultural connections, because in a sense we did a lot of that. Our
strategic moves had much to do with returning IBM to its roots as a
research-driven builder of large systems and infrastructure. Our
cultural transformation sought the high-performance culture that
animated IBM under both Watsons.</p>
<p>The connections I could never make were the personal linkages—the
laughs and the tears of joining a great company together, training and
growing together, winning and losing together.</p>
<p>Yes, I was always an outsider. But that was my job. I know Sam
Palmisano has an opportunity to make the connections to the past as I
could never do. His challenge will be to make them without going
backward; to know that the centrifugal forces that drove IBM to be
inward-looking and self-absorbed still lie powerful in the company.
Continuing to drive change while building on the best (and only the
best) of the past is the ultimate description of the job of Chief
Executive Officer, International Business Machines Corporation.</p>
