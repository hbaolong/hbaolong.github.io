<h4 id="elephants-can-dance">26 Elephants Can Dance</h4>
<p>For much of my business career, it has been dogma that small is
beautiful and big is bad. The prevailing wisdom has been that small
companies are fast, entrepreneurial, responsive, and effective. Large
companies are slow, bureaucratic, unresponsive, and ineffective.</p>
<p>This is pure nonsense. I have never seen a small company that did not
want to become a big company. I have never seen a small company that
didn’t look with envy on the research and marketing budgets of larger
competitors or on the size and reach of their sales forces. Of course,
in public, small companies put forth David v. Goliath bravado, but in
private they say, “I wish I could work with the resources those big
*!#<span class="citation" data-cites="*">@*</span> have!”</p>
<p>Big matters. Size can be leveraged. Breadth and depth allow for
greater investment, greater risk taking, and longer patience for future
payoff.</p>
<p>It isn’t a question of whether elephants can prevail over ants. It’s
a question of whether a particular elephant can dance. If it can, the
ants must leave the dance floor.</p>
<p>I don’t intend to describe here all the elements of creating a
nimble, responsive, large enterprise.1 Certainly the matters just
discussed—focus, execution, and leadership—apply to enterprises of all
sizes.</p>
<p>There is one item, however, that I want to comment on, because it was
essential in getting IBM dancing again. This is the issue of
centralization v. decentralization in large enterprises.</p>
<p>A corollary of the “small is good, big is bad” mantra is the popular
notion that, in large enterprises, decentralization is good and
centralization is bad.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s McKinsey built a powerful reputation
promulgating decentralization to corporations all over the world. It
first pushed the idea in the United States, moved into Europe in the
1970s, and eventually went to Japan (where the idea was rejected
emphatically by most Japanese companies).</p>
<p>Decentralization had a powerful intellectual underpinning, and over
the course of a few decades it became the “theory of the case” in almost
every industrial and financial enterprise. The theory was very simple:
“Move decision making closer to the customer to serve that customer
better. Give decentralized managers control over everything they do so
they can make decisions more quickly. Centralization is bad because it
inevitably leads to slower decision making and second-guessing of the
people on the firing line, closest to the customer. Big companies are
inevitably slow and cumbersome; small companies are quick and
responsive. Therefore, break big companies into the smallest pieces
possible.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot to be said about the power of this construct, and it
should, in my opinion, continue to play an important role in
organizational behavior in large enterprises. However, I believe that in
the 1980s and 1990s it was carried to an extreme in many companies, with
unproductive and, in many cases, highly disruptive results. Too often
managers began to express the view that they lost their manhood or
womanhood if they didn’t control everything that touched on their
business. Consequently, every decentralized business had its own data
processing center, human resources group, financial analysis team,
planning organization, and so on. Decision making was, in fact, fast if
the decision touched only on a single decentralized unit. However, when
multiple segments of the enterprise had to be involved, the highly
decentralized model led to turf battles and inadequate customer
responses because of incompatible systems in the bits and pieces of the
enterprise.</p>
<p>Moreover, as long as profit margins were fat, the extra staffing may
have been tolerable, but as we approached the raw-knuckled competition
of the 1990s with capacity excesses in almost every industry, companies
could ill afford duplicating staffs and process development at every
level of the company.</p>
<p>Yet cost and speed are not the only issues. In many large
institutions, the decentralized units were created for a different world
or acquired as pieces of a larger mosaic. Now these companies are trying
to create new value through the combination of historically separate
entities. Examples abound all over the corporate world: financial
services companies striving to create integrated offerings for customers
from historically disparate product units; industrial companies trying
to redefine their value to their customers as something more than a
traditional product—usually a service wraparound; media companies trying
to package advertising opportunities that combine various pieces of
their enterprises; telecommunications companies trying to attract and
hold customers through integrated offerings of voice, data, and
entertainment.</p>
<p>This is not a challenge limited to the corporate world. University
presidents have been struggling for decades to create interdepartmental
programs that integrate various fiefdoms of the academy. Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has been working for years to create
cross-departmental treatment protocols, i.e., an integrated approach to
a particular type of cancer that combines surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiology. Both in universities and medical centers this is hard work,
because the department chairs who run the traditional decentralized
units have enjoyed years of carefully guarded autonomy.</p>
<p>The problem of decentralization exists in government, too. The United
States intelligence community is a hopeless hodgepodge of overlapping
yet ferociously independent organizations. When a new threat arises
(such as domestic terrorism), the task of redirecting the intelligence
assets of the country away from the missions they were originally
designed to carry out to meet the new challenge becomes an integration
task of gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>Too Expensive, Too Slow</p>
<p>I believe that in today’s highly competitive, rapidly changing world,
few if any large enterprises can pursue a strategy of total
decentralization. It is simply too expensive and too slow when
significant changes have to be made in the enterprise. Thus, what every
CEO has to do is decide what is going to be uniquely local
(decentralized) and what is going to be common in his or her enterprise.
Note the absence of the word “centralized.” It is not a question of
centralization v. decentralization. Great institutions balance common
shared activities with highly localized, unique activities.</p>
<p>Shared activities usually fall into three categories. The first and
easiest category involves leveraging the size of the enterprise.
Included here would be unifying functions like data processing, data and
voice networks, purchasing and basic HR systems, and real estate
management. For the most part these are back-office functions that yield
to economies of scale. It is absolutely foolish for a CEO to accept the
whining of a division president who says, “I can’t run my business
successfully without running my own data center, managing my own real
estate, or purchasing my own supplies.” Even a company as diverse as
General Electric effectively exploits its scale economics in back-office
processes.</p>
<p>The second category involves business processes that are more closely
linked to the marketplace and the customer. Here the drive to common
systems can offer powerful benefits but most often involves linkages
among the parts of a business that may or may not make sense.</p>
<p>I’m thinking here of common customer databases, common fulfillment
systems, common parts numbering systems, and common customer
relationship management systems that permit your customer-service people
to provide integrated information about everything a customer does with
your company.</p>
<p>On the surface it would seem that these are logical and powerful
things to do in an enterprise. Nevertheless, they usually require
profit-center managers to do something very hard—relinquish some of the
control they have over how they run their business. Staff executives,
consultants, or reengineering teams cannot do this without active line
management involvement. The CEO and top management have got to be deeply
involved, reach tough-minded conclusions, then ensure that those
decisions are enforced and executed across the enterprise. It takes
guts, it takes time, and it takes superb execution.</p>
<p>A Step Too Far</p>
<p>Having made the point that decentralization has gone too far in many
institutions, I quickly add that there is a ditch on both sides of the
road. My concern is that today many CEOs are seeking utopian levels of
integration. This is the third—and most difficult—area of common
activities, involving a shared approach to winning a marketplace,
usually a new or redefined marketplace. These activities are difficult
because they almost always demand that profit-center managers subjugate
their own objectives for the greater good of the enterprise. As such,
they can be enormously controversial inside a company and lead to bitter
and protracted struggles.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: During my time at American Express I was running
the so-called Travel Related Services business, which included the
American Express Card division. It was the largest and most profitable
segment of American Express. American Express bought a brokerage company
as a step to create a one-stop financial supermarket. In the course of
enticing the brokerage company to join American Express, the deal makers
promised the brokerage that they would have access to the American
Express cardmember list. In other words, they would be allowed to make
cold calls to cardmembers to try to sign them up for brokerage accounts.
When this became known to the card division, there was an open revolt.
Those of us who had built the card division believed it was assembled on
a basis of trust, privacy, and personalized service. Cold calls from
securities brokers did not fit into our definition of customer
service.</p>
<p>The war went on for years, and the integration or synergy that the
CEO had hoped to achieve not only never happened, but it led to the
departure of many senior executives and ill will that contributed to the
eventual disposition of the brokerage business.</p>
<p>It is very easy to conceive of how various units in a company can
work together against a common enemy or seize new ground in a
competitive industry. Think about all the financial supermarkets that
have been constructed (and almost as many deconstructed). Think about
all the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place in the
entertainment and media industries; The New York Times Company buying
cable companies and sports magazines; Disney buying a television
network; the behemoth known as AOL Time Warner.</p>
<p>How many times have we watched two CEOs stand up at a press
conference and make claims about the extraordinary benefits that would
be achieved once they merged their companies to create a unique
combination that would bring new services and new benefits to the
marketplace?</p>
<p>Well, we’ve all seen what happened in almost every one of these
instances. They fail. Why? Because in most cases the CEO must ask people
to do things that are inextricably and inexorably in conflict. Divisions
are asked to compete against their traditional competitors, focusing on
maintaining a leadership position in their individual markets. At the
same time, they’re asked to join with other divisions in their company
in a much broader fight that inevitably involves giving up some
resources or assets that are needed to win in their traditional
market.</p>
<p>There is great risk in asking a decentralized unit of an enterprise
to be good at its traditional mission and, at the same time, fulfill a
shared role in creating value in a new mission. The conflicts—most often
having to do with resource allocations, but also with pricing, branding,
and distribution—will be overwhelming.</p>
<p>I am about to suggest something that will annoy almost all the
world’s management consultants (they make a lot of money defining “new
industry models” and describing “synergy opportunities”): CEOs should
not go to this third level of integration unless it is absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>For most enterprises the case for integration ends with category two.
Category one is a no-brainer; most back-office functions can be combined
with significant economics of scale. Category two (integration of “front
office” functions that touch the marketplace) can produce significant
benefits, but the integration must be executed superbly or the benefits
will be decimated by the parochial interests of individual units.
Category three is very much a bet-the-company proposition.</p>
<p>However, there will be times when a CEO feels it is absolutely
necessary to bet the company on a new model—a truly integrated model (I
recently met on two occasions with CEOs who run media and entertainment
companies, and they said they are agonizing over this decision). If you
decide to go down this path (as I did at IBM), let me outline a few of
the steps that I think are critical to making a successful conversion. I
can’t and won’t belabor this issue here; it would fill another volume.
What follows are only very introductory comments.</p>
<p>Shift the Power</p>
<p>One of the most surprising (and depressing) things I have learned
about large organizations is the extent to which individual parts of an
enterprise behave in an unsupportive and competitive way toward other
parts of the organization. It is not isolated or aberrant behavior. It
exists everywhere—in companies, universities, and certainly in
governments. Individuals and departments (agencies, faculties, whatever
they are called) jealously protect their prerogatives, their autonomy,
and their turf.</p>
<p>Consequently, if a leader wants fundamentally to shift the focus of
an institution, he or she must take power away from the existing
“barons” and bestow it publicly on the new barons. Admonishments of
“play together, children” sometimes work on the playground; they never
work in a large enterprise.</p>
<p>At IBM, to be a truly integrated company, we needed to organize our
resources around customers, not products or geographies. However, the
geographic and product chieftains “owned” all of the resources. Nothing
would have changed (except polite platitudes and timely head nodding) if
we didn’t redirect the levers of power. This meant making changes in who
controlled the budgets, who signed off on employees’ salary increases
and bonuses, and who made the final decisions on pricing and
investments. We virtually ripped this power from the hands of some and
gave it to others.</p>
<p>If a CEO thinks he or she is redirecting or reintegrating an
enterprise but doesn’t distribute the basic levels of power (in effect,
redefining who “calls the shots”), the CEO is trying to push string up a
hill. The media companies are a good example. If a CEO wants to build a
truly integrated platform for digital services in the home, he or she
cannot let the music division or movie division cling to its existing
technology or industry structure—despite the fact that these traditional
approaches maximize short-term profits.</p>
<p>Measure (and Reward) the Future-Not the Past</p>
<p>I have already pointed out that people do what you inspect, not what
you expect. Leaders who are thinking about creating true integration in
their institutions must change the measurement and reward systems to
reinforce this new direction.</p>
<p>I recall one of the senior executives at American Express who was big
on synergy. He spoke about it constantly. Yet, in all the financial
reports the total focus was on the traditional, independent profit
centers. I remember the poor souls who were assigned the task of
creating synergies among the card, Traveler’s Cheque, and travel
divisions. At best they were tolerated; more often they were simply
ignored. The compensation system at American Express did not
help—98-plus percent of a manager’s annual compensation came from the
results of his or her specific unit. “Synergy points” (which became an
exercise in creative writing around bonus time) might add a minuscule
amount to your pay.</p>
<p>I knew we could not get the integration we needed at IBM without
introducing massive changes to the measurement and compensation system.
I’ve already explained that the group executives who ran IBM’s operating
businesses were not paid bonuses based on their unit’s performance. All
their pay was derived from IBM’s total results.</p>
<p>When a CEO tells me that he or she is considering a major
reintegration of his or her company, I try to say, politely, “If you are
not prepared to manage your compensation this way, you probably should
not proceed.”</p>
<p>Measuring financial results is the same issue. We were never able to
move to an integrated customer view, rather than a geographic view,
until we stopped creating P&amp;L statements for the geographic units.
Of course, many of the geographic leaders went ballistic! “We can’t
manage our business without P&amp;L oversight.” “Sorry,” I said, “you no
longer manage a business. You now serve as a critical support function
to our integrated worldwide customer organization.”</p>
<p>Walk the Talk</p>
<p>As with much that I have discussed in this book, CEO leadership is
mandatory before substantial changes become systemic and sustainable:
They require real involvement and not exhortation, delegation, and then
surprise when change doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>It took me more than five years of daily attention to get IBM to
accept a new go-to-market model. It was a tremendous battle. If you
choose to follow a similar path, you must be prepared to make it happen
personally! The assignment cannot be delegated. Who would you delegate
it to? The operating team that hates the loss of autonomy? Staff
executives who will be ambushed and disemboweled by those fated to lose
power? No. It’s a lonely battle, and it explains why, after twenty years
of talking:</p>
<p>There are no true financial supermarkets.</p>
<p>There are no integrated, multi-service telecommunications
companies.</p>
<p>There are no fully integrated entertainment companies.</p>
<p>There are plenty of financial services companies spinning off their
insurance and/or money management businesses.</p>
<p>There are plenty of divestitures of cable systems and wireless assets
by telephone companies.</p>
<p>There is plenty of skepticism about “convergence” in the
entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Much of the press coverage of IBM over the past decades was focused
on our strategic restructuring—as well it should have been, since
without that restructuring there would be no IBM today. However, as I
pointed out earlier, our current strategies will—and should—change as
the industry continues to evolve very rapidly. History determines
legacies, but if I had a vote, the most significant legacy of my tenure
at IBM would be the truly integrated entity that has been created. It
certainly was the most difficult and risky change I made.</p>
