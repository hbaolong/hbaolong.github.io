Dance?</h1>
<h4 id="dedication">dedication</h4>
<h4 id="foreword">Foreword</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>After a twelve-hour day at the office, who would want to go home
and read about someone else’s career at the office?</p></li>
<li><p>I have always believed you cannot run a successful enterprise
from behind a desk.</p></li>
<li><p>there are thousands of IBMers who answered the call, put their
shoulders to the wheel, and performed magnificently as we undertook an
exhausting—at times frightening, but always exhilarating—journey to
restore this extraordinary company.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote this book without the aid of a coauthor or a
ghostwriter</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<h2 id="part-1-grabbing-hold">PART 1 Grabbing Hold</h2>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Then, at the tender age of 23, I emerged from Harvard and went
into business.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important thing I learned at McKinsey was the detailed
process of understanding the underpinnings of a company.</p></li>
<li><p>I no longer want to be the person who walks into the room and
presents a report to a person sitting at the other end of the table; I
want to be the person sitting in that chair—the one who makes the
decisions and carries out the actions.</p></li>
<li><p>I stayed at American Express for eleven years, and it was a time
of great fun and personal satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus began a lifelong process of trying to build organizations
that allow for hierarchy but at the same time bring people together for
problem solving, regardless of where they are positioned within the
organization.</p></li>
<li><p>That was a difficult time for me. I love building businesses, not
disassembling them.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-courtship">1 The Courtship</h4>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Mr. Burke wants to see you as soon as possible this
evening.</p></li>
<li><p>I told Burke that, given my lack of technical background, I
couldn’t conceive of running IBM.</p></li>
<li><p>keep an open mind on IBM.</p></li>
<li><p>He went back upstairs, and I went to bed thinking about our
conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>It seemed that everyone had advice about what to do at IBM, and
reading it, I was glad I wasn’t there.</p></li>
<li><p>The committee members and I are totally open-minded about who the
new person will be and where he or she will come from. What is
critically important is the person must be a proven, effective
leader—one who is skilled at generating and managing change.</p></li>
<li><p>the question for the present is whether IBM can survive. From our
analysis thus far, it is clear that we think its prospects are very
bleak.</p></li>
<li><p>can a company of IBM’s size, however organized, react quickly
enough to compete?</p></li>
<li><p>The answer to both questions may be no.</p></li>
<li><p>I was at my house in Florida, where I love to walk the beach,
clearing and settling my mind.</p></li>
<li><p>IBM is the job you have been in training for since you left
Harvard Business School. Go for it!</p></li>
<li><p>I think it is fair to say that from February 15 on, I was
prepared to consider taking on IBM and its problems.</p></li>
<li><p>A company facing too many challenges can run out of cash very
quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>When he left the room, I was convinced that, on the basis of
those documents, the odds were no better than one in five that IBM could
be saved and that I should never take the position.</p></li>
<li><p>Still, Jim Burke would not give up.</p></li>
<li><p>I wondered at this point if he was just trying to keep a warm
body in play.</p></li>
<li><p>You owe it to America to take the job.</p></li>
<li><p>He said he was going to have President Bill Clinton call me and
tell me that I had to take the job.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of that long afternoon, I was prepared to make the
most important career decision of my life. I said yes.</p></li>
<li><p>My wife, who had been quite wary of the idea originally,
supported my decision and was excited about it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-announcement">2 The Announcement</h4>
<ol start="31" type="1">
<li><p>He tried to talk me out of my decision, but I was firm that there
was no going back.</p></li>
<li><p>There was only a handful of people in the world who were capable
of handling this job. I want you to know that Lou Gerstner was on that
original list</p></li>
<li><p>I was now a public figure.</p></li>
<li><p>I was taking on a daunting challenge, and I’d be doing it in a
fishbowl.</p></li>
<li><p>I am by nature a private person and, to be frank, I don’t enjoy
dealing with the press.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t remember what the women wore, but it was very obvious
that all the men in the room were wearing white shirts, except
me.</p></li>
<li><p>welcome and I’m delighted to be part of the team</p></li>
<li><p>I hadn’t been looking for it, but had been asked to take on a
responsibility that was important to our country’s competitiveness and
our economy’s health.</p></li>
<li><p>I manage by principle, not procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>The marketplace dictates everything we should do.</p></li>
<li><p>I look for people who work to solve problems and help
colleagues.</p></li>
<li><p>I sack politicians.</p></li>
<li><p>If we make mistakes, let them be because we are too fast rather
than too slow.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish right-sizing by the beginning of the third
quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>Jim Burke had told me a week earlier that there were two board
members who were not totally happy with my selection as the new CEO. As
I walked around the room shaking hands and greeting each of the
seventeen directors in attendance (one was missing), I couldn’t help but
wonder who the two doubters were.</p></li>
<li><p>I went home with a deepening sense of fear.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="drinking-from-a-fire-hose">3 Drinking from a Fire Hose</h4>
<ol start="47" type="1">
<li><p>IBM has plenty of brains and button-downs. What it needs is
bravado.</p></li>
<li><p>White shirt and suit jacket at all times.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of our ride together, I had the feeling he wished he
could take on the assignment himself!</p></li>
<li><p>If there was a soul of IBM, this lab was it.</p></li>
<li><p>This has been a really tough day. I think I’d like to have a
drink.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you think of anyone who could change that rule?</p></li>
<li><p>It’s changed, effective immediately.</p></li>
