<h4 id="an-inside-out-world">21 An Inside-Out World</h4>
<p>To someone arriving at IBM from the outside, there was a kind of
hothouse quality to the place. It was like an isolated tropical
ecosystem that had been cut off from the world for too long. As a
result, it had spawned some fairly exotic life-forms that were to be
found nowhere else. And because IBM was so deeply inbred and ingrown, so
preoccupied with its own rules and conflicts, it had lost its
robustness. It had become extremely vulnerable to attack from the
outside.</p>
<p>This hermetically sealed quality—an institutional viewpoint that
anything important started inside the company—was, I believe, the root
cause of many of our problems. To appreciate how widespread the
dysfunction was, I need to describe briefly some of its
manifestations.</p>
<p>They included a general disinterest in customer needs, accompanied by
a preoccupation with internal politics. There was general permission to
stop projects dead in their tracks, a bureaucratic infrastructure that
defended turf instead of promoting collaboration, and a management class
that presided rather than acted. IBM even had a language all its
own.</p>
<p>This isn’t to ridicule IBM culture. Quite the contrary, as I’ve
indicated, it remains one of the company’s unique strengths. But like
any living thing, it was susceptible to disease—and the first step to a
cure was to identify the symptoms.</p>
<p>The Customer Comes Second</p>
<p>I could make the case that during the 1960s and 1970s IBM’s
self-absorption was actually productive. In those years customers didn’t
have a lot of insight into what data processing could do for them. So
IBM invented these powerful and mysterious machines, and customers
looked to us to explain how the technology could be applied to make
their companies more efficient. This worldview was, and still is, common
throughout the information technology industry. “What we could make” was
the starting point, not “what they need.”</p>
<p>But as time progressed, businesspeople began to understand the
importance of information technology and how it related to everything
they wanted to do. I know, because I was one of them. As business
strategy began setting the technology agenda rather than the other way
around, more and more investments that customers made in IT were being
driven by line-of-business managers, not CIOs. Our industry, and IBM in
particular, needed to adjust. We needed to open the window to the
outside world. And IBM now had competition. UNIX systems and the PC
allowed hundreds of competitors to pick away at IBM’s franchise. We
could no longer run our business like the Roman Empire, confident in our
hegemony, certain that those barbarians massing on the borders were no
real threat.</p>
<p>And yet I was shocked to find so little customer and competitive
information when I arrived. There was no disciplined marketing
intelligence capability. What market share data we had was highly
questionable, mostly because IBM defined the market, unsurprisingly, in
its own image.</p>
<p>We may not have known much about customers, but there was one group
to which we paid plenty of attention: ourselves. In the IBM culture, the
organization, and how one fit into the organization, was considered a
very important subject. Kremlinology—whereby you judge who was in and
out and up and down according to the lineup of leaders atop Lenin’s tomb
on May Day—was a fine art. For instance, I noticed early on that in any
presentation, regardless of subject, the first chart (“foil”) invariably
depicted the internal organization, including a box showing where the
speaker fit on the chart (quite close to the CEO most of the time).</p>
<p>Organization announcements were big deals. When you got promoted, you
had a press release, a written internal announcement on our electronic
bulletin board, and your boss had a conference call with all of his or
her direct reports to announce the good news, with you sitting beside
the boss, presumably beaming. Each evening I’d look through my mail and
e-mail and find dozens of seemingly minor and innocuous organization
announcements, like this one:</p>
<p>The following changes have been announced in the corporate
manufacturing and development organization:</p>
<p>Continuing to report to Patrick A. Toole, IBM senior vice president,
manufacturing and development, is Jean-Pierre Briant, IBM director of
manufacturing and logistics. Reporting to Mr. Briant are:</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Briant, (acting) IBM director of manufacturing;</p>
<p>Lars G. Ljungdahl, who has been named IBM director of logistics and
procurement. He was IBM director of logistics processes.</p>
<p>Reporting to Mr. Ljungdahl are:</p>
<p>Lars G. Ljungdahl, (acting) director of IBM order process. His
organization remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Lars G. Ljungdahl, (acting) director of corporate procurement.</p>
<p>The remainder of Mr. Ljungdahl’s organization is unchanged.</p>
<p>I wanted people to focus on customers and the marketplace, not on
internal status. A company fighting for survival doesn’t need a
published caste system with broad readership. So I ended the practice of
having a separate category of “IBM” vice presidents v. plain old vice
presidents and “IBM” directors, and I banned all press releases about
organization.</p>
<p>We had some very enterprising people, however, particularly in our
personal computer company. You could always tell when the PC company was
about to announce a reorganization, because executives would call the
media ahead of time to leak the news and, in the process, make sure
reporters understood how well that executive fared in the
reorganization. One time The Wall Street Journal called and asked that
we tell PC company executives to stop calling to leak reorganizations,
because the flood of calls was overfilling reporters’ telephone
mailboxes.</p>
<p>A Culture of “No”</p>
<p>I think the aspect of IBM’s culture that was the most remarkable to
me was the ability of any individual, any team, any division to block
agreement or action. “Respect for the individual” had devolved into a
pervasive institutional support system for nonaction.</p>
<p>You saw it at the individual level. One of the most extraordinary
manifestations of this “no” culture was IBM’s infamous nonconcur system.
IBMers, when they disagreed with a position taken by their colleagues,
could announce that they were “nonconcurring.”</p>
<p>Think about it: At any level of the organization, even after a
cross-unit team had labored mightily to come up with a companywide
solution, if some executive felt that solution diminished his or her
portion of the company—or ran counter to the executive’s view of the
world—a nonconcur spanner was thrown into the works. The net effect was
unconscionable delay in reaching key decisions; duplicate effort, as
units continued to focus on their pet approaches; and bitter personal
contention, as hours and hours of good work would be jeopardized or
scuttled by lone dissenters. Years later I heard it described as a
culture in which no one would say yes, but everyone could say no.</p>
<p>The situation got even worse, because at least a public nonconsent
has to be defended among one’s peers. More often than not, the nonconcur
was silent. It would appear that a decision had been made, but
individual units, used to the nonconsent philosophy, would simply go
back to their labs or offices and do whatever in the world they
pleased!</p>
<p>Here is an internal memo sent to many IBM people in 1994:</p>
<p>The nonconcur process takes place throughout the year with added
emphasis on the Spring (strategic) and the Fall (commitment) plan
cycles. This note is the official E/ME/A “Kick-Off” of the nonconcur
process for this year.</p>
<p>To insure the success of the process I need to know the name of the
person in your Division/Industry who will be your Nonconcur Coordinator
for the remainder of this year. I will send the detailed Instructions
and Guidelines to your coordinator as soon as you identify him/her, and
their VNET ID, to me. It would be a great help if you could do this by
COB Friday, May 20, 1994.</p>
<p>It is particularly important to be prepared for the issue cycle this
year as we are expecting E/ME/A to issue a large number of Nonconcurs
during the Spring cycle that are NLS related. Please note that your
Product/Industry Managers should be gearing up for issues to reach me,
through your coordinator, for the Spring cycle, by Friday, June 3, 1994.
(FYI, the Spring Plan has been published by M&amp;D.) Note that I
encourage you to get your issues to me prior to the due date, if
possible.</p>
<p>Please note that I will not enter any nonconcur into NCMS (Nonconcur
Management System) unless you have the timely approval of Bill—, Bob—,
or their designee, as applicable. This also means that you must be
prepared to help—/—escalate, if necessary, through the management chain
to Gerstner, if necessary.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and consideration.</p>
<p>This validation of game-stopping disagreement also manifested itself
at the divisional level. Interdivisional rivalries at times seemed more
important, more heated, than the battle with external competitors. Early
in my IBM career I was shocked when an IBM hardware division struck a
deal with Oracle—a company that is an archrival of the IBM software
unit—without even telling our software unit in advance.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for a pragmatic, opportunistic response
to complex market realities. I’ve discussed earlier the need for
“coopetition”—whereby we both cooperate and compete with the same
companies. But to accomplish that, it takes a mature awareness of who
you are as a company, where your deep interests lie, and where they
don’t. This wasn’t that sort of sophisticated ambidextrousness. IBM
product salespeople were legendary for going to customers and
denigrating another IBM product that might serve in equal capacity in a
customer solution. In fact, IBM divisions would bid against one another,
and a customer often got multiple IBM bids.</p>
<p>Research-and-development units would hide projects they were working
on, so other parts of the company would not learn of them and try to
take advantage of their knowledge. It went on and on in a staggering
array of internal competition. Teamwork was not valued, sought, or
rewarded.</p>
<p>This unique brew of rigidity and hostility often landed on my own
doorstep. I discovered that just because I asked someone to do
something, that didn’t mean the task got done. When I discovered this
days or weeks later, I’d ask why. One executive said, “It seemed like a
soft request.” Or: “I didn’t agree with you.”</p>
<p>Ironically, at the same time, some people were handing out orders in
my name: “Lou said that you should…” or “Lou wants you to…” Then they
followed up on the order so often, so persistently, and so loudly that
the tasks actually got done. Unfortunately, many were things I knew
nothing about and sometimes didn’t want done. It got to the point where
I had to hold a special meeting with everyone who had access to me for
the specific purpose of banning “Lou said” orders on any subject.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy That Hurts</p>
<p>The word “bureaucracy” has taken on a negative connotation in most
institutions today. The truth is that no large enterprise can work
without bureaucracy. Bureaucrats, or staff people, provide coordination
among disparate line organizations; establish and enforce corporatewide
strategies that allow the enterprise to avoid duplication, confusion,
and conflict; and provide highly specialized skills that cannot be
duplicated because of cost or simply the shortage of available
resources.</p>
<p>These functions were all critical to an organization like IBM.
Coordination was critical because we had a four-way matrix at IBM:
geography, product, customer, and solutions. We also desperately needed
corporatewide standards for many aspects of the company—e.g.,
commonality of products around the world for customers who operate
globally; and common HR processes so we could move talent quickly and
effectively whenever it was needed. And, given the complexity of a
highly technical, global company, we clearly needed specialized
resources that served the entire company—e.g., branding specialists and
intellectual property lawyers.</p>
<p>The problem at IBM was not the presence of bureaucracy but its size
and how it was used.</p>
<p>In IBM’s culture of “no”—a multiphased conflict in which units
competed with one another, hid things from one another, and wanted to
control access to their territory from other IBMers—the foot soldiers
were IBM staff people. Instead of facilitating coordination, they manned
the barricades and protected the borders.</p>
<p>For example, huge staffs spent countless hours debating and managing
transfer pricing terms between IBM units instead of facilitating a
seamless transfer of products to customers. Staff units were duplicated
at every level of the organization because no managers trusted any
cross-unit colleagues to carry out the work. Meetings to decide issues
that cut across units were attended by throngs of people, because
everyone needed to be present to protect his or her turf.</p>
<p>The net result of all this jockeying for position was a very powerful
bureaucracy working at all levels of the company—tens of thousands
trying to protect the prerogatives, resources, and profits of their
units; and thousands more trying to bestow order and standards on the
mob.</p>
<p>IBM Lingo</p>
<p>I’m a strong believer in the power of language. The way an
organization speaks to its various audiences says a lot about how it
sees itself. Everywhere I’ve worked I’ve devoted a good deal of personal
attention to the organization’s “voice”—to the conversations it
maintains with all of its important constituencies, both inside and
outside the company. And I have chosen my own words—whether in written,
electronic, or face-to-face communications—very carefully.</p>
<p>The truth is, you can learn a great deal about a place simply by
listening to how it talks. Ordinary discourse at IBM in the early 1990s
spoke volumes about the culture’s insularity—volumes that were often
pretty funny, in a rueful sort of way.</p>
<p>There was a special vocabulary inside IBM—words and phrases used only
by IBMers. Also, like the federal government and other bureaucracies, we
just loved creating and using acronyms, like MDQ, FSD, GPD, and SAA.</p>
<p>As a result, in the early days I would sit through meetings and
frequently have no idea what a presenter was talking about. I didn’t
pretend that I did, however. I’d stop the speaker and ask for a
plain-English translation. It was jarring, but people quickly got the
point.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most frequently used and colorful IBMisms I
heard:</p>
<p>CRISP UP, TWEAK, AND SWIZZLE—Things one had to do to improve a foil
presentation</p>
<p>BOIL THE OCEAN—To use all means and options available to get
something done</p>
<p>DOWN-LEVEL—Describes a document that has since been improved (or
tweaked and swizzled); used most frequently with me when I complained
about something: “Lou, you’re working from a down-level version.”</p>
<p>LEVEL-SET—What you do at the beginning of a meeting to get everyone
working from the same facts</p>
<p>TAKE IT OFF-LINE—What two or more people do with an issue that bogs
down a meeting—namely, discuss it after the meeting</p>
<p>HARD STOP—A time at which a meeting must end no matter what (I grew
to like this expression and use it to this day.)</p>
<p>ONE-PERFORMER—An employee with the company’s highest performance
rating</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT-INITIATED SEPARATION—Getting fired; commonly used in
acronym form: “I’ve been MISed.”</p>
<p>LEFT THE BUSINESS—What an employee who was fired has done</p>
<p>MEASURED MILE—Where a manager puts an employee who, within a year,
will most likely leave the business</p>
<p>PUSHBACK—What you run into when someone doesn’t agree with you</p>
<p>NONCONCUR—What people do just before pushback</p>
<p>LOBS—Lines of business, or business units (pronounced like what you
might do with a tennis ball)</p>
<p>I have always been an advocate for use of plain language that one’s
customers easily understand, whether it be for invoices, contracts, or
simple correspondence. So I decided to begin the end of widespread
in-house terms. In an internal memo in 1993, I wrote: “We are also going
to take this opportunity to rename some of our organization units to
make the nomenclature more understandable, or more transparent, to our
customers (call it customer-friendly). Also, we will no longer use the
term ‘LOB.’ Our product units will now be called ‘divisions.’”</p>
<p>Presiders Over Process</p>
<p>Soon after I’d joined the company, I asked one of the most senior
executives to provide me with a detailed analysis of a major
money-losing business at IBM. I did this not only because I wanted the
insight from the analysis but also to test this highly rated
executive.</p>
<p>Three days later I asked him how the work was progressing. He said,
“I’ll check with the team and get back to you.” At the end of the week,
I got the same response: “I’ll check with the team leader and let you
know” (he later did). When this little scene played out a third time, I
finally said, “Why don’t you just give me the name of the person doing
the work, and from now on I’ll speak directly with him or her.”</p>
<p>What I discovered was that senior executives often presided. They
organized work, then waited to review it when it was done. You were a
worker early in your career, but once you climbed to the top, your role
was to preside over a process. Well, my kind of executives dig into the
details, work the problems day to day, and lead by example, not title.
They take personal ownership of and responsibility for the end result.
They see themselves as drivers rather than as a box high on the
organization chart.</p>
<p>When I told this senior executive that I expected him to be a direct
and active participant in the problem-solving work I asked him to
undertake, he was stunned. That was not how he was trained, nor was that
expected corporate behavior at the time. The incident was an eye-opener
for me. I had an enormous team of executives. I would need to develop a
cadre of leaders.</p>
<p>I do not think IBM senior executives would have described their
activities quite the way I did. They were simply acting the roles that
the long-established interior culture asked them to perform. This is how
things were done. It did not mean they were not bright or committed. It
was part of a huge, complicated mosaic that had come to define action
and behavior. This same situation also extended to the ever-present and
powerful administrative assistants, the nonconcur system, and the role
of the “corporate officer.” (IBM had a practice of electing senior
people to the title of “corporate officers.” Once you were so
recognized, this title stayed with you for life, like tenure at a
university. Your performance post-election was not a factor in your
continuation in this role.)</p>
