<h4 id="operation-bear-hug">5 Operation Bear Hug</h4>
<p>In late April we had a meeting of the Corporate Management Board.
This was the group of fifty top executives with whom I had met in March,
the day I was announced as the new CEO.</p>
<p>I shared with them my observations after three weeks on the job. I
started by saying that I saw a lot of positive things going on,
particularly in research, product development, and in the can-do
attitude of a number of people.</p>
<p>However, there were troublesome areas, including:</p>
<p>Loss of customer trust, supported by some disturbing customer ratings
on quality.</p>
<p>The mindless rush for decentralization, with managers leaping forward
saying “make me a subsidiary.”</p>
<p>Cross-unit issues not being resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Major tension in the organization over who controlled marketing and
sales processes.</p>
<p>A confusing and contentious performance measurement system, causing
serious problems when closing sales with customers.</p>
<p>A bewildering array of alliances that didn’t make any sense to
me.</p>
<p>I announced Operation Bear Hug. Each of the fifty members of the
senior management team was to visit a minimum of five of our biggest
customers during the next three months. The executives were to listen,
to show the customer that we cared, and to implement holding action as
appropriate. Each of their direct reports (a total of more than 200
executives) was to do the same. For each Bear Hug visit, I asked that a
one- to two-page report be sent to me and anyone else who could solve
that customer’s problems. I wanted these meetings to be a major step in
reducing the customer perception that dealing with us was difficult. I
also made it clear that there was no reason to stop at five customers.
This was clearly an exam in which extra credit would be awarded.</p>
<p>Bear Hug became a first step in IBM’s cultural change. It was an
important way for me to emphasize that we were going to build a company
from the outside in and that the customer was going to drive everything
we did in the company. It created quite a stir, and when people realized
that I really did read every one of the reports, there was quick
improvement in action and responsiveness.</p>
<p>The Management Committee Dies</p>
<p>That same day in late April, there was a meeting of the Management
Committee (its inside-IBM name was “the MC”). It is important to
understand that a seat on the MC was the ultimate position of power that
every IBM executive aspired to as the apex of his or her career. When
I’d joined the company there were six members, including Akers and
Kuehler. The MC met once or twice a week, usually in formal, all-day
meetings with lots of presentations. Every major decision in the company
was presented to this committee.</p>
<p>Some members of the MC had only recently been appointed. To their
utter—and probably crushing—dismay, I told them that afternoon, at my
first meeting, that it was unlikely this structure would continue. I
wanted to be more deeply involved personally in the decision making of
the company, and I was uncomfortable with committees making decisions.
While it wasn’t officially disbanded until months later, the Management
Committee, a dominant element of IBM’s management system for decades,
died in April 1993.</p>
<p>In some ways, the rise and fall of the Management Committee
symbolized the whole process of rigor mortis that had set in IBM. It
seemed to me an odd way to manage a company—apparently centralized
control, but in a way that ultimately diffused responsibility and
leadership. The MC was part of IBM’s famed contention system, in which
the recommendations of powerful line units were contested by an equally
powerful corporate staff. As I think about the complexity of the
technology industry and the risks associated with important business and
product decisions, this approach may very well have been a brilliant
innovation when it was created. The problem was that over time, IBM
people learned how to exploit the system to promote their own agendas.
So by the early 1990s a system of true contention was apparently
replaced by a system of prearranged consensus. Rather than have
proposals debated, the corporate staff, without executives, worked out a
consensus across the company at the lowest possible level. Consequently,
what the Management Committee most often got to see was a single
proposal that encompassed numerous compromises. Too often the MC’s
mission was a formality—a rubberstamp approval.</p>
<p>I haven’t spent much time unearthing and analyzing IBM’s history, but
I have been told that the administrative assistant network emerged as
the facilitator of this process of compromise. Much like the eunuchs of
the ancient Chinese court, they wielded power beyond their visible
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Meetings with Industry Experts</p>
<p>In the course of everything else during the first weeks of my being
on the job, I scheduled a number of one-on-one meetings with various
leaders in the computer and telecommunications industry. They included
John Malone of TCI, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Andy Grove of Intel, Chuck
Exley of NCR, and Jim Manzi of Lotus. These meetings were very helpful
to me, more for their insights into the industry than for anything said
about IBM. And, as you might expect, many of my visitors arrived with
thinly disguised agendas.</p>
<p>The meeting with Andy Grove was perhaps the most focused. In his
wonderfully direct style, Andy delivered the message that IBM had no
future in the microprocessor business, that we should stop competing
with Intel with our PowerPC chip, and that, unless this happened,
relationship between the two companies were going to be difficult. I
thanked Andy, but, having no real understanding at that point of what we
should do, I tucked the message away.</p>
<p>The meeting with Bill Gates was not significant from the point of
view of content. Basically, he delivered the message that I should stick
to mainframes and get out of the PC business. More memorable are the
incidentals.</p>
<p>We met at 8 A.M. on May 26 at the IBM building on Madison Avenue in
New York City. Coincidentally, I was to meet later that same day with
Jim Manzi, head of Lotus. The IBM security person in the lobby got
confused and called Gates “Mr. Manzi” and gave him Manzi’s security
pass. By the time Bill arrived on the 40th floor, he wasn’t happy.
Nevertheless, we had a useful discussion.</p>
<p>What followed the meeting was more noteworthy. He and I, as well as
our staffs, had agreed there would be no publicity in advance of or
after the meeting. However, the press had the story two hours after he
left the IBM building, and by evening everyone knew about the confusion
over his security badge. He apparently didn’t deduce that I had a
meeting with Manzi that same day. To some, the mix-up seemed to be
further evidence of IBM’s—and perhaps Lou Gerstner’s—ineptitude.</p>
<p>The Financials: Sinking Fast</p>
<p>We announced first-quarter operating results at the end of April, and
they were dismal. Revenue had declined 7 percent. The gross profit
margin had fallen more than 10 points—to 39.5 percent from 50 percent.
The company’s loss before taxes was 00 million. In the first quarter of
the previous year, IBM had had a pretax profit of close to billion.</p>
<p>At the end of May I saw April’s and they were sobering. Profit had
declined another 00 million, for a total decline of 00 million for the
first four months. Mainframe sales had dropped 43 percent during the
same four months. Other large IBM businesses—software, maintenance, and
financing—were all dependent, for the most part, on mainframe sales and,
thus, were declining as well. The only part of the company that was
growing was services, but it was a relatively small segment and not very
profitable. Head count had declined slightly, from 302,000 at the
beginning of the year to 298,000 at the end of April. Several business
units, including application-specific software and our semiconductor
businesses, were struggling.</p>
<p>Almost as frustrating as the bad results was the fact that, while the
corporation could add up its numbers quite well in total, the internal
budgeting and financial management systems were full of holes. There was
not one budget but two or three, because each element of the IBM
organization matrix (e.g., the geographic units versus the product
divisions) insisted on its own budget. As a result, there really wasn’t
single, consolidated budget. Allocations were constantly debated and
changed, and accountability was extremely difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the mainframe was still in free fall and so much
of IBM’s business at that point depended on the mainframe, the outlook
was extremely precarious. We were shoring up the balance sheet as best
we could with financing, but something had to be done to stabilize the
operations.</p>
<p>The Media Early On</p>
<p>There was a very short honeymoon with the media—understandably, given
the nature of the story, but also because it’s impossible to transform a
badly ailing company under the glare of daily press briefings and
publicity. There’s too much work to do inside without having to contend
with a daily progress report in the papers focusing everyone on results
that take months and years, and not hours and days, to achieve. A
reporter from the Associated Press wanted to follow me around all day my
first day. USA Today said it was working on graphics for a daily
progress chart. We said, “No, thank you. We’re going dark for a bit
while we assess the task at hand.” That was not a popular way to answer
reporters who were used to writing daily stories about the problems at
IBM.</p>
<p>I brought with me to IBM from the first day my communications
executive, David Kalis. David had been with me for many years, going
back to American Express in the 1980s. He was, in my opinion, the best
public relations executive in America. He was also the first true PR
professional in IBM’s history to hold the top communications job. For
decades the position had been a rotation slot for sales executives being
groomed for other top jobs.</p>
<p>He inherited a shambles at IBM. There were some talented people, but
the communications department was staffed for the most part with
well-meaning but untrained employees. However, even if they had all been
professionals, it would have been impossible for them to perform, given
the foxhole mentality that permeated the company in 1993. Typically, IBM
executives believed that the only real problem the company had was the
daily beating in was getting in the press. They felt that if we had more
positive stories in the media, IBM would return to profitability and
everything would be normal again.</p>
<p>Although my clear priority was meeting and talking with IBM customers
and employees, I had to make some time for the media as well. Pressure
was almost overwhelming. During the first months, on any given day there
were more than sixty-five standing requests for Gerstner interviews from
the major media. If requests from local newspapers and computer industry
press were factored in, the demand was in the hundreds. If one included
international demand…and so on.</p>
<p>I did what I could on a tight schedule. I conducted individual
interviews with The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
Business-Week, Fortune, USA Today, and the Financial Times. But, the
media let us know, loudly and frequently, that that just wasn’t
enough.</p>
<p>More than anything else, I wanted time, but I knew I didn’t have a
lot of it. Pressure was building—in the media, on the Street, and with
shareholders. A lot had been done, but I knew I would have to go public,
and do it soon, with my plans to fix IBM.</p>
