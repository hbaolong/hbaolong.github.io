<h4 id="back-on-the-beach">11 Back on the Beach</h4>
<p>On a gray morning ten months after I had taken that walk on the beach
in Florida, thinking about my conversations with Jim Burke and deciding
whether or not to parachute into IBM, I found myself back on the same
beach, mulling over the extraordinary events that had transpired since
that time.</p>
<p>I had to admit, I felt pretty good. Few had given us any chance of
saving IBM, but I knew now that the company was going to make it. We’d
stopped the bleeding, reversed the breakup plan, and clarified IBM’s
basic mission. The holes in the hull had been patched. This ship was not
going to sink.</p>
<p>My thoughts turned to what lay ahead. What would Act II look like?
Logic and my own experience dictated a straightforward set of
priorities: Invest in new sources of growth, build a strong cash
position, and do a more rigorous assessment of our competitive
position.</p>
<p>However, doing all of that wasn’t enough. Even if we restored growth,
even if we built up some momentum with customers, and even if we made
the company more efficient and less bureaucratic—that wouldn’t truly
bring IBM back. For IBM’s turnaround to be successful, this company
would have to regain its former position of leadership in the computer
industry and in the broader world of business.</p>
<p>I can’t remember whether I smiled, laughed, or shook my head. But
that question—Could IBM lead again?—gave me pause. Certainly it would be
easy, and expected, for the CEO to declare that the company would lead
again. But as I thought about what it would actually take for that to
happen, all of my original doubts about accepting this job came flooding
back.</p>
<p>First of all, the track record of IT companies that had been pulled
back from the brink was dismal. I thought of Wang, Data General,
Sperry-Burroughs (today’s Unisys), DEC. Even when companies were
rescued, they usually survived as also-rans or found another partner to
merge with or put themselves up for sale.</p>
<p>Most troubling was the computer industry’s trajectory. Basically, it
was moving away from IBM’s traditional strengths. The PC wasn’t an
endgame, and the mainframe wasn’t dead. But it was obvious that in the
emerging computing model—of which the PC had been a harbinger—power was
migrating rapidly away from centralized computing systems and
traditional IT. And this was, in turn, changing the mix of IT customers.
IBM sold to large businesses, governments, and other institutions. But
more and more, IT was being bought by consumers, small businesses, and
department heads inside big companies.</p>
<p>The emerging computer model was also changing what those customers
were buying. We built industrial-strength, behind-the-scenes computers
and software while the world, it seemed, was moving to desktop, laptop,
and palmtop. All of our research and development, engineering, and
rigorous testing ensured that our product never went down. Reliability,
dependability, and security—these were the bedrock of IBM’s brand. But
people didn’t seem to mind rebooting their PCs three times a day.</p>
<p>We sold through a direct sales force—the vaunted, blue-suited IBM
customer representative; part salesperson, part business and technology
consultant. A tremendous asset, but also the most expensive way to sell
any product or service. The market was abandoning that model and going
to retailers and toll-free numbers.</p>
<p>Overall, the tasks we were being asked to take on were spreading
beyond the domain of the CIO and into every corner of business
operations—places where IBM had not, in general, ventured and where we
lacked strong customer relationships. And, most ominously, value and
profit margins were shifting away from hardware, which was becoming more
commoditized, and toward software (and, it was beginning to appear,
toward services).</p>
<p>Then, look at who we were up against! The people running our
competition were, without doubt, the next generation of
hyper-capitalists: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Scott
McNealy. These guys were hungry, and they stayed hungry no matter how
much wealth they accumulated. And it was awe-inspiring the way they ran
their companies, the people they attracted, how they paid them, their
work ethic—young, aggressive, flexible, willing to work around the
clock. The whole Silicon Valley ethos—lightning speed to market with
just-good-enough products—wasn’t simply foreign to IBM, it was an
entirely new game.</p>
<p>Even without considering this formidable competition, our own
strategy raised some daunting implications. What we had done so far to
unify IBM—reorganizing around industries rather than countries,
consolidating our marketing, and changing our compensation plans—had
been relatively easy to accomplish. What lay ahead—devising a strategy
for a fundamentally new world and reinventing an encrusted culture from
the DNA out—that was a challenge of a vastly different order.</p>
<p>I asked myself: “How did I get into this? Is it an impossible task?”
It would be hard to say no with a straight face, even to my closest
colleagues. I could see clearly what the remaining four years of my
contract would look like. We had a chance to grow. Maybe we could take
on and displace a few competitors in some segments. But lead the
industry? That mountain looked too high to climb. And if I set that task
as the goal, I stood a very good chance of failing—very visibly.</p>
<p>I walked more, thought more, and the clouds began to clear. Yes,
those were daunting obstacles, but wasn’t that why I’d come here? Didn’t
this make the challenge that much more intriguing?</p>
<p>And wasn’t it worth the risk? If we didn’t aspire to leadership, one
thing was clear: The company would never really come together, never
really achieve its potential. And that would be a shame.</p>
<p>I recalled the comment Jim Burke had made about IBM’s being a
national treasure. In fact, Burke was just one of several people who had
expressed that phrase to me. Shortly after the announcement of my
appointment, I had run into Joshua Lederberg, a research geneticist and
Nobel laureate on the street in Manhattan. I knew him from the board of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. “You’re going to IBM,” he’d said
to me. I’d said I was. “It’s a national treasure,” he’d said. “Don’t
screw it up.”</p>
<p>At the time, I thought this reverence was a bit over the top. Up to
that point in my career, I had dealt mostly with businesspeople who were
motivated by basically two things: money and power. And we were in the
midst of one of the most swashbuckling eras in the history of commerce.
In contrast, when I got to IBM, I felt as though I had entered a time
warp and gone back to the 1950s.</p>
<p>The fact was, IBM had grown on me. I had come to understand what Jim
Burke and Dr. Lederberg meant. The corporation was important—not only in
what it did for customers and governments and universities, and not only
for what it invented, impressive and meaningful as those accomplishments
were. It was also important for the kind of corporate behavior to which
it aspired. IBMers were battered, bruised, and confused. Many had
retreated into a self-protective shell. But underneath that, they were
still motivated by a genuine love of their company and of doing the
right thing.</p>
<p>You could make fun of IBM all you liked. (Our competitors certainly
did.) But for issues that really mattered—when it was a question of
national defense, or our children’s health, or serious scientific
discovery—IBM was essential. Forgive my hyperbole, but in an industry
increasingly run by mad scientists and pied pipers, we needed to
succeed.</p>
<p>I hadn’t left consulting and gone into management just to be
Mr. Fix-It or simply for the pleasure of getting into the game. More
than anything, I like to win. But the issue here went beyond winning.
For the first time in my career, I was in a position to make a different
kind of mark, to help something truly important live and thrive. I
wasn’t going to walk away from that. As I headed back to our family’s
beach house, I began to feel intense excitement. I told myself: “You
know, we could actually pull this off!”</p>
<p>So the die was cast. I’d concluded it was insufficient—for me
personally and for the institution—to call it a day after battling back
from IBM’s near-death experience. We were going to take our best shot at
making the long climb back to industry leadership.</p>
<p>Heading into IBM, I would have bet large sums of money that these
frenetic early months of decision making and action taking to stabilize
the patient would be the hardest work of my professional career. I would
have bet wrong. It had been difficult, even painful. The issues,
however, were reasonably obvious, the problems were easy to parse, and
the remedial actions were straightforward.</p>
<p>Now, after nearly a decade of subsequent work—and with the benefit of
a little distance from the day-to-day existence of the CEO—I can say
without hesitation that what came next was far more difficult. If
nothing else, those first twelve to eighteen months at least had the
benefit of adrenaline-stoked intensity—many highs, an equal number of
lows, but never time to celebrate one or dwell on the other because we
were literally in a situation in which every minute counted.</p>
<p>What I’d come to realize during this second walk on the beach was
that after all that initial work had been completed, we’d gotten
ourselves only to the starting line. The sprint was over. Our marathon
was about to begin.</p>
<p>While the issue was no longer as stark as the demise or survival of
IBM, the ultimate fate of this “national treasure” was far from settled.
What would happen through the second half of the 1990s would determine
whether IBM was merely going to be one more pleasant, safe,
comfortable—but fairly innocuous—participant in the information
technology industry, or whether we were once again going to be a company
that mattered.</p>
<p>The outcome of that race has been abundantly documented. By 1997 we’d
declared the IBM turnaround complete. Inside the company we were talking
openly about getting back on top and once again setting the agenda for
our industry—aspirations that, when we began, would have seemed
excessively ambitious at best, delusional at worst.</p>
<p>Before I stepped away in March 2002, we were number one in the world
in IT services, hardware, enterprise software (excluding PCs), and
custom-designed, high-performance computer chips (see Chapter 16). The
IBM team had staged comebacks in multiple markets where we’d previously
been getting sand kicked in our faces. We’d revamped and reinvigorated
traditional product lines, launched new growth businesses, and
jettisoned several others that were vestiges of the earlier era.</p>
<p>At a higher level, we had articulated and then led the future
direction of the industry—a future in which business and technology
would not be separate tracks but intertwined; and a future in which the
industry—in a remarkable about-face—would be driven by services, rather
than hardware or software products. We’d coined the term “e-business”
and played a leadership role in defining what was going to matter—and
what wasn’t—in a networked world.</p>
<p>The IBM workforce increased in size by about 100,000 people. Our
stock split twice and increased in value by 800 percent. Our technical
community ushered in a new golden age of IBM research and development
and earned more United States patent awards than any company for nine
years running. We even connected supercomputing with pop culture when a
machine named Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.</p>
<p>In short, once we got back on our feet, shook off the stigma of
squandering a seemingly unassailable leadership position, and decided
that just maybe our best days were yet to come, the IBM team responded
magnificently—just as it had through even the darkest days early in the
transformation.1</p>
<p>What follows in the next part of this book—the Strategy section—is a
change of pace. I could not provide (nor would you want to read) an
event-by-event or month-by-month recounting of all that was done to
effect the strategic redirection of IBM. My intent is to provide a
summary description of the most important strategic changes. Some can be
declared successes; others remain works in progress. In each case, what
I’ve included are the moves that were either such distinct departures
from IBM’s prior direction that they can be considered “bet the company”
changes; or those that were so diametrically opposed to the existing
culture that they were at great risk of being brought down by internal
resistance.</p>
<p>Also, I’ll point out that I leave my successor much unfinished
business. A number of our strategies are not yet fully deployed; others
remain to be defined. More important, the cultural transformation of
IBM’s formerly successful and deeply entrenched culture—our single most
critical and difficult task—will require constant reinforcement or the
company could yet again succumb to the arrogance of success.</p>
