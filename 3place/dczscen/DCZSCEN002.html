<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>RULES TO RULE BY</p>
<p>What remarkable puzzles politics provides. Every day’s headlines
shock and surprise us. Daily we hear of frauds, chicanery, and
double-dealing by corporate executives, new lies, thefts, cruelties, and
even murders perpetrated by government leaders. We cannot help but
wonder what flaws of culture, religion, upbringing, or historical
circumstance explain the rise of these malevolent despots, greedy Wall
Street bankers, and unctuous oil barons. Is it true, as Shakespeare’s
Cassius said, that the fault lies not in the stars but in ourselves? Or,
more particularly, in those who lead us? Most of us are content to
believe that. And yet the truth is far different.</p>
<p>Too often we accept the accounts of historians, journalists, pundits,
and poets without probing beneath the surface to discover deeper truths
that point neither to the stars nor to ourselves. The world of politics
is dictated by rules. Short is the term of any ruler foolish enough to
govern without submitting to these rules to rule by.</p>
<p>Journalists, authors, and academics have endeavored to explain
politics through storytelling. They’ve explored why this or that leader
seized power, or how the population of a far-flung country came to
revolt against their government, or why a specific policy enacted last
year has reversed the fortunes of millions of lives. And in the
explanations of these cases, a journalist or historian can usually tell
us what happened, and to whom, and maybe even why. But beneath the
particulars of the many political stories and histories we read are a
few questions that seem to emerge time after time, some profound, some
seemingly minor, but all nagging and enduring in the back of our minds:
How do tyrants hold on to power for so long? For that matter, why is the
tenure of successful democratic leaders so brief? How can countries with
such misguided and corrupt economic policies survive for so long? Why
are countries that are prone to natural disasters so often unprepared
when they happen? And why do lands rich with natural resources have
populations stricken with poverty?</p>
<p>Equally, we may well wonder: Why are Wall Street executives so
politically tone-deaf that they dole out billions in bonuses while
plunging the global economy into recession? Why is the leadership of a
corporation, on whose shoulders so much responsibility rests, decided by
so few people? Why are failed CEOs retained and paid handsomely even as
their company’s shareholders lose their shirts?</p>
<p>In one form or another, these questions about political behavior pop
up again and again. Each explanation, each story, treats the errant
leader and his or her faulty decision-making as a one-off, one-of-a-kind
situation. But there is nothing unique about political behavior.</p>
<p>These stories of the horrible things politicians or business
executives do are appealing in their own perverse way because they free
us to believe we would behave differently if given the opportunity. They
liberate us to cast blame on the flawed person who somehow,
inexplicably, had the authority to make monumental—and monumentally
bad—decisions. We are confident that we would never act like Libya’s
Muammar al-Qaddafi, who bombed his own people to keep himself in power.
We look at the huge losses suffered under Kenneth Lay’s leadership by
Enron’s employees, retirees, and shareholders and think we aren’t like
Kenneth Lay. We look at each case and conclude they are different,
uncharacteristic anomalies. Yet they are held together by the logic of
politics, the rules ruling rulers.</p>
<p>The pundits of politics and the nabobs of news have left us ignorant
of these rules. They are content to blame evildoers without inquiring
why the worlds of politics and business seem to succor miscreants or
turn good people into scoundrels. That’s why we are still asking the
same old questions. We’re still surprised by the prevalence of
drought-induced food shortages in Africa, 3,500 years after the pharaohs
worked out how to store grain. We’re still shocked by the devastation of
earthquakes and tsunamis in places like Haiti, Iran, Myanmar, and Sri
Lanka, and baffled that such natural disasters seem less intense in
North America and Europe. We’re still troubled by the friendly
handshakes and winks exchanged between democratic leaders and the
tyrants that they somehow justify empowering.</p>
<p>In this book, we’re going to provide a way to make sense of the
miserable behavior that characterizes many—maybe most—leaders, whether
in government or business. Our aim is to explain both good and bad
conduct without resorting to ad hominem claims. At its heart, this will
entail untangling the reasoning and reasons behind how we are governed
and how we organize.</p>
<p>The picture we paint will not be pretty. It will not strengthen hope
for humankind’s benevolence and altruism. But we believe it will be the
truth, and it will point the way to a brighter future. After all, even
if politics is nothing more than a game that leaders play, if only we
learn the rules, it becomes a game we can win.</p>
<p>To improve the world, however, all of us must first suspend faith in
conventional wisdom. Let logic and evidence be the guide and our eyes
will be opened to the reasons why politics works the way it does.
Knowing how and why things are as they are is the first, crucial step
toward learning how to make them better.</p>
<p>BELL’S BOTTOMLESS BLUES</p>
<p>In politics, as in life, we all have desires and contend with
obstacles that keep us from getting what we want. A government’s rules
and laws, for example, limit what we can do. Those in power differ from
the rest of us: they can design rules to their advantage and make it
easier for themselves to get what they want. Understanding what people
want and how they get it can go a long way to clarifying why those in
power often do bad things. In fact, bad behavior is more often than not
good politics. This dictum holds up whether one governs a tiny town, a
mom-and-pop business, a megacorporation, or a global empire.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a tale of a small town’s team of seemingly greedy,
grasping, avaricious louts so that we can appreciate how the world looks
from a leader’s perspective. And yet it’s vital that we remember that
this is a story about politics, not personality. Whether or not we’re
discussing a cabal of corrupt reprobates, what really matters is that
these are people who value power and recognize how to get it and keep
it. Soon enough we will come to appreciate that this small tale of
miserable conduct recurs at every level of politics and corporate
governance, and that there is nothing out of the ordinary in the
extraordinary story of Bell, California.</p>
<p>Robert Rizzo is a former city manager of the small town of Bell
(population about thirty-six thousand). Bell, a suburb of Los Angeles,
is a poor, mostly Hispanic and Latino town. Per capita income is about
6,000, way below both the California and national averages. More than 30
percent of the town’s hardworking people live below the poverty line.
Life is not easy in Bell.</p>
<p>Still, it is a community that takes pride in its accomplishments, its
families, and its prospects. Despite its many challenges, Bell
consistently outperforms other communities in California and the nation
in keeping violent crime and property crime below average. A cursory
glance at Bell’s 2019 website suggests it’s a thriving, happy community
brimming with summer classes, library events, water play, and fun-filled
family trips. And Bell seems to be a civic-minded community too. For
instance, the town is a recipient of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
community grants, to the tune of nearly 00,000 in 2021–2022 aimed at
improving housing.1</p>
<p>Back in 2010, Robert Rizzo had been Bell’s city manager for seventeen
years. That year, Bell’s mayor, Oscar Hernandez (who was later convicted
on corruption charges), said the town had been on the verge of
bankruptcy in 1993 when Rizzo (also later convicted for corruption) was
hired. For fifteen consecutive years of Rizzo’s leadership, up until he
stepped down in 2010, the city’s budget had been balanced. Hernandez
credited Rizzo with making the town solvent and helping to keep it that
way. That, of course, was no mean feat. Surely Rizzo and the town
leaders with whom he worked deserved praise and tangible rewards for
their good service to the people of Bell.</p>
<p>Behind the idyllic facade, however, lies a story that embodies how
politics really works. You see, Robert Rizzo, hired at 2,000 a year in
1993, at the end of his tenure seventeen years later was earning a
staggering 87,000 per year.</p>
<p>Let’s put that in perspective. If his salary had just kept up with
inflation, he would have made 08,000 in 2010. He made seven times more!
During long years of low inflation, his salary went up at an annual,
compounded rate of more than 15 percent, almost exactly the return
Bernie Madoff, the master Ponzi schemer, promised his hapless
investors.</p>
<p>How does Rizzo’s city manager’s pay compare to other responsible
government jobs? The president of the United States is paid 00,000.2 The
governor of California’s salary is just over 00,000. The mayor of Los
Angeles, just a hop, skip, and a jump from Bell, is paid only a bit over
00,000. To be sure, Robert Rizzo was not even close to the highest-paid
public employee in California. That distinction, as in most states, went
to the coach of a university football team: UC Berkeley’s coach earned
about ,850,000 in 2010—but then he probably brought in a lot more
revenue than Mr. Rizzo.3 In 2020, being mindful of the pandemic, the
coach generously took a pay cut, reducing his pay to a bit more than
,725,000. Robert Rizzo, not close to the football coach’s salary, was
indeed credited with doing a good job for Bell, but was it really that
good? It seems that he was the highest-paid city manager in the entire
United States (at least until we discover another Bell).</p>
<p>The natural thought is that somehow Robert Rizzo must have been
stealing money, dipping into the proverbial cookie jar, taking funds
that were not rightfully and legally his, or at least doing something
that was immoral and illegal. The California attorney general (and
Democratic candidate for governor) at the time of the Bell scandal in
the summer of 2010, Jerry Brown, promised an investigation to find out
if any laws had been violated. The implicit message was clear: no one
would voluntarily pay a small-town city manager nearly 00,000 a year.
The truth, however, is quite a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear. Rizzo and all but one city council member were
convicted of and served time for numerous criminal counts having to do
with payments for committee memberships when the committees never met
and for frauds they perpetrated. But none were convicted for receiving
outrageously high salaries.</p>
<p>Being paid well is not a crime. Rizzo’s actual story is one of clever
(and reprehensible) political maneuvering implicitly sanctioned by
Bell’s voters and the city council members who represented them,
supplemented only by a touch of larceny. Cities comparable to Bell pay
their council members little or nothing. But four of Bell’s five council
members received close to 00,000 a year through the simple mechanism of
being paid not only their (minimal) base council salaries but also
nearly ,000 per month to sit on bogus city committees. Only poor
councilman Lorenzo Velez—not charged with any crimes—failed to reap such
rewards. Velez apparently received only ,076 a year as a council member,
approximately equal to what his fellow council members were getting each
month. How can we possibly explain these disparities, let alone the
outrageous salaries and pensions provided not only to Mr. Rizzo but also
to the assistant city manager and Bell’s chief of police (all
subsequently jailed on corruption charges)?</p>
<p>The answers lie in a clever manipulation of election timing. The
city’s leaders ensured that they depended on very few voters to hold on
to power and to set their compensation. To see how a poor community
could so handsomely reward its town leaders, we must start with the 2005
special election to convert Bell from a general city to a charter city.
What, you may well ask between yawns, is the difference between a
general city and a charter city? The answer is day and night: decisions
are made in the open daylight in general cities and often in secret,
behind closed doors, in charter cities. While a general city’s governing
system is dictated by state or federal law, a charter city’s governance
is defined by—well, as you would expect—its own charter.</p>
<p>The California legislature decided in 2005 to limit salaries for city
council members in general cities. No sooner did the state legislature
move to impose limits than creative politicians in Bell—some allege
Robert Rizzo led the way—found a way to insulate themselves from the
“whims” of those sent to California’s state capital, Sacramento. A
special election was called, supported by five council members, to turn
Bell into a charter city. The selling point of the change to charter
city was that it would give Bell greater autonomy and more freedom from
decisions by distant state officials. Local authorities know best what
is right for their community, better than distant politicians who are
not in touch with local circumstances. Or so the leaders of Bell,
California, argued.</p>
<p>Special elections on technical questions—to be a charter city or to
remain a general city—are less than captivating to the general voter. Of
course, if the vote had been held in the context of a major national or
even statewide election, the proposition would likely have been
scrutinized by many prospective voters, but as it happens—surely by
political design—the special election, associated with no other ballot
decisions, attracted fewer than 400 voters (336 in favor, 54 opposed) in
a town of 36,000 people. And so the charter passed, placing within the
control of a handful of people the right to allocate city revenues and
form the city budget—and to do so behind closed doors. As best as we can
tell, the charter changed nothing else of consequence concerning Bell’s
governance. It just provided a means to give vast discretion over taxing
and spending decisions to a tiny group of people who were, as it
happens, also making choices about their own compensation.</p>
<p>Lest one think the council members were stupid as well as venal, it
is worth noting how clever they were in disguising what they had done.
Should anyone have cared to ask about a city council member’s part-time
salary, the council member could say openly and honestly that they were
paid just a few hundred dollars a month, a pittance, for their services.
As we have already seen, the bulk of their pay—the part denied to
Lorenzo Velez—was for participation on city committees. That, as it
turns out, may ultimately have been their Achilles’ heel.</p>
<p>All but Councilman Luis Artega (found not guilty) and Lorenzo Velez
(not charged) among the principal players in Bell’s scandal were charged
and convicted on criminal counts that did not include their lavish
salaries. As reprehensible as these may have been, it seems they were
perfectly legal. No, they were jailed for receiving payments for
meetings that never took place. It seems they collected a lot of money
while overlooking their obligation to actually attend committee
meetings. This is to say that the well-paid managers of Bell may have
ended up falling victim to what one might describe as a legal
technicality. Outrageous salaries were okay, but getting paid for
attending meetings while being absent from them was not. We cannot help
but wonder how many government officials are held to that standard. How
many senators and representatives, for instance, draw their full
salaries while skipping meetings of the Senate or House so that they can
raise campaign funds, give speeches, or participate in boondoggles?</p>
<p>You may well wonder how a little town like Bell could balance its
budget—one of Mr. Rizzo’s significant accomplishments—while paying such
high salaries. (Indeed, now that Bell’s governance is cleaned up, its
spending involves paying off its indebtedness.) Remember, the town’s
leaders got to choose not only how to spend money but also how much tax
to levy. And did they ever tax their constituents. Here’s what the Los
Angeles Times reported about property taxes in Bell:</p>
<p>Bell’s rate is 1.55%—nearly half again as much as those in such
affluent enclaves as Beverly Hills and Palos Verdes Estates and
Manhattan Beach, and significantly higher than just about everywhere
else in Los Angeles County, according to records provided by the county
Auditor-Controller’s Office at the Times request. That means that the
owner of a home in Bell with an assessed value of 00,000 would pay about
,200 in annual property taxes. The owner of the same home in Malibu,
whose rate is 1.10%, would pay just ,400.4</p>
<p>In plain and simple terms, Bell’s property tax was about 50 percent
higher than those of nearby communities. With such high taxes, the city
manager and council members certainly could balance the budget while
enriching themselves and their key cronies.</p>
<p>Now that we have Bell’s story, let’s look at the subtext. In Bell,
city council members are elected, although before 2007 their election
was not contested for many years. That means that council members are
beholden to the voters, or at least the voters whose support was needed
to win office. Before 2007 that was hardly anyone because the elections
were not contested. Since 2007, as it turns out, even with contested
elections, it still takes very few votes to win a council seat. For
instance, Bell had about 9,400 registered voters in 2009, of which only
2,285—that is, 24.3 percent—turned out to vote. Each voter could cast a
ballot for two candidates for city council out of the six candidates
seeking that office. The two winners, Luis Artiga and Teresa Jacobo,
received 1,201 and 1,332 votes respectively, out of 2,285 votes that
were cast, but they didn’t need that many votes to win. Speaking
generously, election was achieved with supportive votes from only about
13 percent of the registered electorate. We say “speaking generously”
because to get elected to the city council in 2009 all that was
necessary was to have one more vote than the third-largest vote-getter
among the candidates. Remember, two were to be elected. The number three
candidate had just 472 votes. So, 473 votes—about 5 percent of the
registered voters, just over 1 percent of the city population, and only
about one-fifth of those who actually turned out to vote—was all that
was needed to win the election. Whatever the reason that the vote was
divided among so many candidates, it is evident that election could have
been achieved with support from only a tiny percentage of Bell’s adult
population. This goes a long way to explaining the city government’s
taxing and spending policies.</p>
<p>One thing we can be sure of: those on the city council could not have
been eager for competing candidates (or even fellow council member
Velez) to get wind of the truth about their compensation package. City
manager Rizzo had to maintain the council’s confidence to keep his job,
and they needed his support to keep theirs. He could have exposed how
deeply they were dipping into the public’s hard-earned money, which
would have sent them packing (as it eventually did). It is in this need
for mutual loyalty that we see the seeds of Bell’s practices and of
politics in general. Rizzo served at the pleasure of the mayor and city
council. They, in turn, served at the pleasure of a tiny group of Bell’s
citizens, the essential supporters among Bell’s considerably larger
prospective electorate. Without the council’s support, Rizzo would have
been out on his ear—albeit with a fabulous pension estimated at 50,000
to 80,000 per year. How best to keep their loyalty? That was easy:
promote the means to transfer great private rewards in the form of
lavish compensation packages to council members.5</p>
<p>Of course, if all were being done in the open, or if Bell had
remained a general city subject to Sacramento’s control over
compensation, Rizzo could not have provided the means to ensure that he
would scratch the city council members’ backs and they his. When a
leader’s hold on power—his or her political survival—depends on a small
coalition of backers (remember the small percentage of voters needed to
actually win a seat on the city council), then providing private rewards
is the path to long tenure in office: Mr. Rizzo kept his job for
seventeen years. Furthermore, when that small coalition is drawn from a
relatively large pool—just five council members, elected under a city
charter ratified by only 336 voters out of a registered voter population
(in 2009) of 9,395—then not only is privately rewarding the small
coalition an efficient way to govern, but so much budgetary and taxing
discretion is created that the folks at the top have ample opportunity
for handsome compensation, an opportunity that the city’s top leadership
did not fail to exploit.</p>
<p>Bell presents a number of lessons for us about the rules to rule by.
First, politics is about getting and keeping political power. It is not
about the general welfare of “we the people.” Second, political survival
is best assured by depending on few people to attain and retain office.
That means dictators, dependent on a few cronies, are in a far better
position to stay in office for decades, often dying in their sleep, than
are democrats. Third, when the small group of cronies knows that there
is a large pool of people waiting on the sidelines, hoping to replace
them in the queue for gorging at the public trough, then the top
leadership has great discretion over how revenue is spent and how much
to tax. All that tax revenue and discretion opens the door to
kleptocracy from many leaders, and public-spirited programs from a very
few. And it means enhanced tenure in power. Fourth, dependence on a
small coalition liberates leaders to tax at high rates, just as Bell’s
leaders did. Taxing at high rates has a propensity to foment the threat
of popular uprisings. That risk was surely there once people found out
what Bell’s government was doing. There was no actual uprising, however,
thanks to the media’s exposés, which brought down Rizzo and Bell’s other
corrupt leaders. Of course, in Bell it was easy for the news media to
end Rizzo’s rule because it had essential freedoms: the rights to free
speech and to a free press. We shall see that how the structure of
government and the economy work explains variation in how many of these
rights people have. This in turn accounts for whether the people take to
the streets and whether they can succeed in orchestrating change, as we
saw in some parts of the Middle East during the brief Arab Spring of
2011, or remain oppressed, as we saw in other parts during and shortly
after the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>We will see that Bell’s story offers a nearly perfect script for how
to govern when the hold on office depends on very few people, especially
when they are selected from among many. The politicians of Bell
intuitively understood the rules of politics. Leaders who follow these
rules faithfully truly can stay on top without ever having to do “the
right thing” for their subjects. The people governing Bell clung to
power for a very long time before probes from outside uncovered their
means of holding on to office. As we will see, what works for those at
the top usually works against those at the bottom; hence the public’s
shock and surprise at headlines about the misdeeds of so many in high
positions. The way places like Bell are governed (which is the way most
places and most businesses are governed) assure the Bell Bottom
Blues.</p>
<p>One important lesson we will learn is that where politics are
concerned, ideology, nationality, and culture don’t matter all that
much. The sooner we learn not to think or utter sentences such as “The
United States should…” or “The American people want…” or “China’s
government ought to…” the better we will understand government,
business, and all other forms of organization. When addressing politics,
we must accustom ourselves to thinking and speaking about the actions
and interests of specific, named leaders rather than thinking and
speaking about fuzzy ideas like the national interest, the common good,
and the general welfare. Once we think about what helps leaders come to
and stay in power, we will also begin to see how to fix politics.
Politics, like all of life, is about individuals, each motivated to do
what is good for them, not what is good for others. And that surely is
the story of Robert Rizzo of Bell, California.</p>
<p>GREAT THINKER CONFUSION</p>
<p>As Robert Rizzo’s story highlights, politics is not terribly
complicated. But by the same measure, history’s most revered political
philosophers haven’t explained it very well. The fact is, people like
Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, James Madison, and Charles-Louis de
Secondat (that is, Montesquieu), not to mention Plato and Aristotle,
thought about government mostly in the narrow context of their
times.</p>
<p>Hobbes sought the best form of government. He was blinded, however,
by his experience of the English civil war, the rise of Cromwell, and
his fear of rule by the masses. Hobbes saw monarchy as the natural path
to order and good governance. Believing in the necessary benevolence of
an absolute leader, the Leviathan, he also concluded that “no king can
be rich, nor glorious, nor secure, whose subjects are either poor, or
contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissension, to maintain a war
against their enemies.”6 Taking a bit of liberty with Hobbes’s more
nuanced philosophy, we must wonder how Robert Rizzo, by Hobbesian
lights, could grow so rich when his subjects, the citizens of Bell, were
so demonstrably poor.</p>
<p>Machiavelli, an unemployed politician/civil servant who hoped to
become a hired hand of the Medici family—that is, perhaps the Robert
Rizzo of his day—wrote The Prince to demonstrate his value as an
adviser. It seems the Medicis were not overly impressed—he didn’t land
the job. But he had, we believe, a better grasp than Hobbes on how
politics can create self-aggrandizing practices such as those carried
out in Bell half a millennium later. Writing in The Discourses,
Machiavelli observed that anyone seeking to establish a government of
liberty and equality will fail, “unless he withdraws from that general
equality a number of the boldest and most ambitious spirits, and makes
gentlemen of them, not merely in name but in fact, by giving them
castles and possessions, as well as money and subjects; so that
surrounded by these he may be able to maintain his power, and that by
his support they may satisfy their ambition.”7</p>
<p>Robert Rizzo might have done well to study Machiavelli as the best
source of his defense against public opprobrium. He maintained his power
for long years by satisfying the ambition for wealth and position of
those loyal to him on Bell’s city council, and they really were the only
people whose support he had to have.</p>
<p>James Madison, a revolutionary trying to bring his brand of politics
into power, was, like Hobbes, looking revolution in the face. Unlike
Hobbes, however, Madison actually liked what he saw. In “Federalist 10,”
Madison contemplated the problem that was to bedevil the citizens of
Bell a quarter of a millennium later: “whether small or extensive
Republics are most favorable to the election of proper guardians of the
public weal: and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter.”8 His
conclusion—not easily reached, because he was fearful about tyranny of
the majority—is close to what we argue is correct, although, as always,
the devil is in the details and Madison, we believe, fell a bit short on
the details of good governance. In describing a republic as large or
small, he failed to distinguish between how many had a say in choosing
leaders and how many were essential to keeping a leader in place. The
two, as we will see, can be radically different.</p>
<p>Madison’s view was at odds with that of Montesquieu, who maintained
that “in a large republic the public good is sacrificed to a thousand
views; it is subordinate to exceptions; and depends on accidents. In a
small one, the interest of the public is easier perceived, better
understood, and more within the reach of every citizen; abuses have a
lesser extent, and of course are less protected.”9 Not so in Bell—and in
Bell we trust.</p>
<p>For Montesquieu, the Enlightenment, the new Cartesian thinking, and
the emerging constitutional monarchy of Britain all combined to
stimulate his insightful ideas about political checks and balances. He
hoped these checks and balances would prevent exactly the corruption of
public welfare that the charter city election in Bell foisted on its
citizens.</p>
<p>Of course, the option of forming a charter city was motivated, in
theory, by a quest for checks on the authority of California’s state
legislature. But the electoral public in the charter city special
election was a meager 390 souls, and even in Bell’s contested elections
before the scandal, fewer than a quarter of registered voters,
themselves only a quarter of the city’s population, bothered to vote.
That’s not enough to prevent the corruption Montesquieu hoped to
avoid.</p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that Montesquieu, Madison, Hobbes, and
Machiavelli were very clever and insightful thinkers (and surely
brighter than us). However, they got an awful lot of politics wrong
simply because they were coping with momentary circumstances. They were
looking at but a small sample of data, the goings-on surrounding them,
and bits and pieces of ancient history. They also lacked modern tools of
analysis (which we, luckily, have at our disposal). Consequently, they
leapt to partially right, but often deeply wrong, conclusions. In all
fairness to these past luminaries, their shortcomings often have to do
with the fact that, besides being bound by their then-present contexts,
these thinkers were also caught up in “the big questions”—what the
highest nature of man ought to be, or what the “right” state of
government really is, or what “justice” truly means in political terms.
This shortsightedness extends not only to history’s legends in political
thought but also to contemporary thinkers like Jürgen Habermas, Michel
Foucault, and John Rawls—thinkers who someday may be viewed in the same
light.</p>
<p>The big questions about how the world ought to be are indeed
important. But they are not our focus. Questions about philosophical
values and metaphorical abstractions—these simply don’t apply to the
view of politics that we’ll present in the pages ahead. We do not start
with a desire to say what we think ought to be. It is hard to imagine
that anyone, including us, cares much about what we think ought to be.
Neither do we exhort others to be better than they are. Not that we do
not hope to find ways to improve the world according to our lights—but
we believe that the world can only be improved if we first understand
how it works and why. Working out what makes people do what they do in
the realm of politics is fundamental to working out how to make it in
their interest to do better things.</p>
<p>The modern vernacular of politics and international relations, from
balances of power and hegemony to partisanship and national interest, is
the stuff of high school civics and nightly news punditry. It has little
to do with real politics. And so, you may be delighted—or
disappointed—to hear, this particular book of politics is not concerned
with any of this. Our account of politics is primarily about what is,
and why what is, is. In this book, we hope to explain the most
fundamental and puzzling questions about politics and, in the process,
give all of us a better way to think about why the worlds of rulers and
subjects, of authorities and rights, of war and peace, and, in no small
way, of life and death all work in the ways that they do. And maybe,
just maybe, from time to time we will see paths to betterment.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>The origins of the ideas developed here came years ago during heated
lunchtime discussions between one of the authors of this book—Bruce
Bueno de Mesquita—and a coauthor of many earlier works, Randolph M.
Siverson (now professor emeritus at the University of California,
Davis). While munching on burritos, Randy Siverson and Bueno de Mesquita
discussed a rather basic question: What are the consequences for leaders
and their regimes when a war is lost?</p>
<p>Oddly, that question had not been much addressed in the copious
research on international affairs, and yet surely any leader would want
to know before getting involved in a risky business like war what was
going to happen to him after it was over. This question hadn’t been
asked because the standard ideas about war and peace were rooted in
notions about states, the international system, and balances of power
and polarity, not in leader interests. From the conventional view of
international relations, the question just didn’t make sense. Even the
term “international relations” presumes that the subject is nations
rather than what Joe Biden or Kim Jong-Un or any other leader wants. We
so easily speak of the United States’ grand strategy or China’s human
rights policy or Russia’s ambitions to once more achieve great power
status, and yet, from our point of view, such statements make little
sense.</p>
<p>States don’t have interests. People do. Amid all the debate about
national interest, what did former president Barack Obama fret about
when formulating his Afghan policy? If he did not announce a timetable
for withdrawal from Afghanistan he would lose support from his
Democratic—not his national, but his Democratic—electoral base.
President Kennedy similarly fretted that if he took no action in what
became the Cuban missile crisis, he would be impeached and the Democrats
would pay a heavy price in the 1962 midterm election.10 National
interest might have been on each of their minds, but their personal
political welfare was front and center.</p>
<p>The prime mover of interests in any state (or corporation for that
matter) is the person at the top—the leader. So we started from this
single point: the self-interested calculations and actions of rulers are
the driving force of all politics.</p>
<p>The calculations and actions that a leader makes and takes constitute
how she governs. And what, for a leader, is the “best” way to govern?
However is necessary first to come to power, then to stay in power, and
to control as much national (or corporate) revenue as possible all along
the way.</p>
<p>Why do leaders do what they do? To come to power, to stay in power
and, to the extent that they can, to keep control over money.</p>
<p>Building on their lunchtime question about leaders and war, Siverson
and Bueno de Mesquita wrote a couple of academic journal articles in
which they looked at international relations as just ordinary politics
in which leaders want, above all else, to survive in power. These
articles caught on quickly. Researchers saw that this was a different
way to think about politics, one tied to real people making real
decisions—in their own interest—rather than metaphors like states,
nations, and systems. (It seems obvious now, but among the dominant
realist school of international relations this is still heresy.) But
Siverson and Bueno de Mesquita also saw that the theory could be
stretched across a bigger canvas. Every type of politics could be
addressed from the point of view of leaders trying to survive.</p>
<p>The idea that the canvas was that big was scary. It meant trying to
recast everything (or nearly everything) we knew or thought we knew
about politics into a single theoretical whole. It was a humbling
moment, and Bueno de Mesquita and Siverson felt in need of help. Enter
James D. Morrow—now a professor at the University of Michigan but back
then a senior research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, where
Bueno de Mesquita was also based—and Alastair Smith. And so a foursome
was born (sometimes affectionately known as BdM2S2). Together we wrote a
thick, dense, technical tome called The Logic of Political Survival as
well as a long list of journal articles.11 These are the foundation for
this book, which presents our ideas in an account that we hope anyone
can follow, argue with, and maybe even come to accept. Today the theory
behind this body of research has inspired many spin-off studies by us
and by other researchers, theoretical expansions and elaborations by us
and by others, and some lively debate—and no shortage of controversy as
well.</p>
<p>Using this foundation, we look at politics, the choices of public
policies, and even decisions about war and peace as lying outside of
conventional thinking about culture and history. We also put ideas of
civic virtue and psychopathology aside as central to understanding what
leaders do and why they do it. Instead, we look at politicians as
self-interested louts, just the sort of people you wouldn’t want to have
over for dinner, but without whom you might not have dinner at all.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is simple. After the essentials of ruling
are outlined in Chapter 1, each subsequent chapter will probe a specific
feature of politics. We’ll assess why taxes are higher in many poor
countries than in rich countries and why leaders can spend a fortune on
the military and yet have a weak and almost useless army when it comes
to the national defense. We will see, encouragingly, that despite recent
challenges, democratic governance—that is, dependence on a large
coalition of essential backers—is robust and maybe even immune to
successful revolution and coups d’état. Together, the chapters will
detail how the logic of political survival—the rules to rule by—connects
dots of political consequence across the widest canvas imaginable,
deepening our understanding of the dynamics of all rulers and their
populations. It is because of this capacity to connect the dots that
many of our students have called our list of rules to rule by “The
Theory of Everything.” We are content to codify it simply as The
Dictator’s Handbook.</p>
<p>We fully admit that our view of politics requires us to step outside
of well-entrenched habits of mind, out of conventional labels and vague
generalities, and into a more precise world of self-interested thinking.
We seek a simpler and, we hope, more compelling way to think about
government. Our perspective, disheartening though it may often seem to
some, offers a way to address other facets of life than just government.
It easily describes businesses, charities, families, and just about any
other organization. (We’re sure many readers will be comforted to have
confirmation that their companies really are run like tyrannical
regimes.) All of this may be sacrilege to some, but we believe that, in
the end, it’s the best way to understand the political world—and the
only way that we can begin to assess how to use the rules to rule by to
rule for the better. If we are going to play the game of politics, and
we all must from time to time, then we ought to learn how to win the
game. We hope and believe that is just what we all can take away from
this book: how to win the game of politics and perhaps even improve the
world a bit as we do so.</p>
