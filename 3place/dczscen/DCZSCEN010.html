<h4 id="chapter-eight-the-people-in-revolt">CHAPTER EIGHT THE PEOPLE IN
REVOLT</h4>
<p>A successful leader always puts the wants of his essential supporters
before the needs of the people.1 Without the support of his coalition a
leader is nothing and is quickly swept away by a rival. But keeping the
coalition content comes at a price when the leader’s control depends on
only a few. More often than not, the coalition’s members get paid at the
cost of the rest of society. Sure, a few autocrats become Hall of Famers
who make their citizens better off. Most don’t. And those who don’t will
spend their time in office running down their nation’s economy for the
benefit of themselves and their coalition. Eventually things get bad
enough that some of the people tire of their burden. Then they, too, can
threaten the survival of their leader.</p>
<p>Although the threat of revolution is not as omnipresent as the threat
posed by the risk of coalition defection, if the people take to the
streets en masse, they may succeed in overwhelming the power of the
state. Working out how to prevent and deal with such revolutionary
threats is therefore a crucial lesson for dictators. It is also crucial
for would-be revolutionaries, who must work out what the right timing is
for an uprising and whether members of the regime’s winning coalition
will support them or the incumbent. We examine these concerns now.</p>
<p>TO PROTEST OR NOT TO PROTEST</p>
<p>In autocracies the people get a raw deal. We now know that their
labor provides tax revenues that leaders lavish on essential core
supporters. Leaders provide them with little beyond the essential,
minimal health care, primary education, and food that they need in order
to work. And if a small-coalition leader is fortunate enough to have
another source of revenue, such as natural resources or a benevolent
foreign donor, then he may even be able to do away with these minimal
provisions. Autocrats certainly don’t provide political freedoms. Life
for people in most small-coalition regimes is solitary, poor, nasty,
brutish, and short. The people, seeing the hopeless path they are on,
invariably want change. They want a government that provides for them
and under which they can live secure, happy, and productive lives.</p>
<p>Why, having suffered long and hard, might they suddenly and often in
multitudes rise up against their government? The answer resides in a
crucial moment, a tipping point, at which life in the future under the
existing government is expected to be sufficiently bad that it is worth
their while to risk the undoubted costs of rebellion. They must believe
that some few who have come forward first in rebellion have a decent
chance of success and a decent chance of making the lives of ordinary
people better.</p>
<p>There is a delicate balance here. If a regime excels at convincing
people that stepping out of line means incredible misery and even death,
it is unlikely to experience rebellion. Yes, life under such a
government is horrendous, but the risk of failure in a revolt and the
costs of that failure are way too high for people to rise up. They might
be killed or imprisoned, and they might lose their job or home, even
their children. That is why the Hitlers, Stalins, and Kim Jong-Uns of
the world manage to avoid revolt. If rule is really harsh, people are
effectively deterred from rising up.</p>
<p>At first, a few especially bold individuals may rise up in revolt.
They proclaim their intention to make their country a democracy. Every
revolution and every mass movement begins with a promise of democratic
reform, of a new government that will lift up the downtrodden and
alleviate their suffering. That is an essential ingredient in getting
the masses to take to the streets. Of course, it doesn’t always
work.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communists, for instance, declared the formation of a
Chinese Soviet Republic on November 7, 1931. They said of their newly
declared state, “It is the state of the suppressed workers, farmers,
soldiers, and working mass. Its flag calls for the downfall of
imperialism, the liquidation of landlords, the overthrow of the warlord
government of the Nationalists. We shall establish a soviet government
over the whole of China; we shall struggle for the interests of
thousands of deprived workers, farmers, and soldiers and other
suppressed masses; and to endeavor for peaceful unification of the whole
of China.”2</p>
<p>Jomo Kenyatta, the leader of Kenya’s independence movement and its
first head of state, likewise declared during a meeting of the Kenya
African Union on July 26, 1952:</p>
<p>If we unite now, each and every one of us, and each tribe to another,
we will cause the implementation in this country of that which the
European calls democracy. True democracy has no colour distinction. It
does not choose between black and white. We are here in this tremendous
gathering under the K.A.U. flag to find which road leads us from
darkness into democracy. In order to find it we Africans must first
achieve the right to elect our own representatives. That is surely the
first principle of democracy. We are the only race in Kenya which does
not elect its own representatives in the Legislature and we are going to
set about to rectify this situation.… It has never been known in history
that a country prospers without equality. We despise bribery and
corruption, those two words that the European repeatedly refers to.
Bribery and corruption is prevalent in this country, but I am not
surprised. As long as a people are held down, corruption is sure to rise
and the only answer to this is a policy of equality.3</p>
<p>Noble words from both Mao Zedong and Jomo Kenyatta. Neither fulfilled
his promises of equality, democracy, and liberty for the average Chinese
or the average Kenyan. Nor did either leader eliminate corruption and
special opportunities for their party faithful. Once most
revolutionaries come to power, their inclination—if they can get away
with it—is to be petty dictators. After all, the democratic institutions
that engender the policies the people want also make it hard for leaders
to survive in office. Leaders won’t acquiesce to the people’s wants
unless the people can compel them. And when can the people compel an old
dictator, seemingly set in his ways, or a recently victorious
revolutionary, newly ensconced in power, to look out for them instead of
for himself? The answer to that question is the answer to when regimes
choose the road to democracy rather than to sustained autocracy.</p>
<p>Before deciding to gamble on the promises of revolutionaries, each
prospective demonstrator must judge the costs and the risks of rebellion
to be tolerable relative to the conditions expected without rebellion
and relative to the gains expected with a successful uprising. Thus it
is that middle-of-the-road dictators, like Cuba’s Fulgencio Batista,
Tunisia’s Ben Ali, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, and the Soviet Union’s
Gorbachev (but not Stalin), are more likely to experience a mass
uprising than their worst fellow autocrats. That is not to say that when
the people rise up they are right in thinking life will be better. They
are taking a calculated risk. They surely understand that revolutionary
success holds the prospect of betterment, but not all revolutionary
movements end in democracy, and not all result in an outpouring of
public goods for the people.</p>
<p>Many revolutions end up simply replacing one autocracy with another.
On some occasions the successor regime can actually be worse than its
predecessor. This might well have been the case with Sergeant Doe’s
deposition of Liberia’s True Whig government or Mao’s success against
Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government in China. But the hope of the
people when they participate is that they will improve their lot, either
by enlarging the winning coalition through democratization or at least
by becoming part of the new coalition.</p>
<p>NIPPING MASS MOVEMENTS IN THE BUD</p>
<p>There are two diametrically opposed ways in which a leader can
respond to the threat of a revolution. He can increase democracy, making
the people so much better off that they no longer want to revolt. He can
also increase dictatorship, making the people even more miserable than
they were before while also depriving them of a credible chance of
success in rising up against their government.</p>
<p>The extent of expected loyalty from the military is one critical
factor that shapes the direction an incumbent takes in responding to a
nascent threat. Leaders know that as isolated individuals the people are
no threat to their government. That is precisely why government leaders
are reluctant to let people freely assemble and organize against them.
If the people find a way to take to the streets en masse, the incumbent
will certainly need very loyal supporters willing to undertake the
decidedly dirty work of suppressing the masses if he is to survive.</p>
<p>We have met many leaders whose backers deserted them at just such key
times. When insurgents challenged Sergeant Doe in 1990, his soldiers
terrorized and stole from the people of Liberia rather than combat the
threat. In 1979, the shah of Iran was deposed when his soldiers joined
the supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini. Similarly, President Ferdinand
Marcos in the Philippines lost power in 1986 because his security forces
defected. Russia’s Czar Nicholas was deposed when the people stormed his
Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in 1917. The army, poorly paid and
facing deployment to the front in World War I, declined to stop them.
Many other crucial events in modern political history, from the French
Revolution to the collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellite states,
also owe their occurrence to the failure of core supporters to suppress
the people at critical moments. The post–Cold War so-called colored
revolutions (Georgia’s Rose Revolution in 2003, Ukraine’s Orange
Revolution in 2004–2005, and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in
2005), the Jasmine revolution in Tunisia, as well as the uprisings in
Egypt are also manifestations of the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>In each case, coalition support evaporated at the key moment because
the leader could no longer promise his or her supporters an adequate
flow of rewards to justify their undertaking the dirty work required to
keep the regime in place. The Russian czar, France’s Louis XVI, and the
Soviet Union were all short of money with which to reward supporters.
The Philippines’ Marcos and Iran’s shah were both known to be terminally
ill. Ben Ali and Mubarak were both elderly and thought to be seriously
ill. New leaders typically reshuffle their coalition, so key backers of
the regime were uncertain whether they would be retained by the
successor. Lacking assurance that they would continue to be rewarded,
they stood aside and allowed the people to rebel.</p>
<p>Revolutionary movements may seem spontaneous, but we really need to
understand that they arise when enough citizens believe they have a
realistic chance of success. That is why successful autocrats make
rebellion truly unattractive. They step in quickly to punish harshly
those who first take to the streets. This is what we saw in Iran
following the June 2009 presidential election. The regime quickly
stepped in, beating, arresting, and killing protesters, until the people
feared continuing to take to the streets.</p>
<p>A prudent dictator nips rebellion in the bud. That is why we have
reiterated the claim that only people willing to engage in really nasty
behavior should contemplate becoming dictators. The softhearted will
find themselves ousted in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>PROTEST IN DEMOCRACY AND AUTOCRACY</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with what a government is doing is an entirely
different matter in democracies than it is in autocracies. In a
democracy, protest is relatively cheap and easy. People have the freedom
and, indeed, the right to assemble. They also have easy means through
which to coordinate and organize. We know from earlier chapters that
governments ruled by a large coalition produce lots of public goods,
including a special set of such goods that fall under the general
heading of freedoms. These include a free press, free speech, and
freedom of assembly. These freedom goods make it much easier for large
numbers of people to exchange information about how they feel about
their government and to express objections to any policies they don’t
like.</p>
<p>These freedoms also make protest easy. But since people like these
freedoms, granting them can also dissipate their desire to bring down
the government. Protests are common in democracies, but revolts
intending to overthrow the institutions of government are not. Democrats
provide the policies people want because otherwise the people will
protest, and when people can freely assemble there is little a leader
can do to stop them except give them what they want. Sometimes, of
course, democratic leaders fail to give the people what they want. Then
people are likely to take to the streets to indicate their dislike of a
particular policy. That’s what generally happens when a democracy goes
to war, for example. Some people favor the decision and others oppose
it. Those who oppose it frequently make their displeasure known by
taking to the streets, and if there are enough of them and if they
protest for a sufficiently sustained time, they can provoke a policy
change. For instance, Lyndon Johnson chose not to seek reelection in the
face of deep dissatisfaction with his Vietnam War policies.</p>
<p>In a democracy, protest is about alerting leaders to the fact that
the people are unhappy and that, if changes in policy are not made,
they’ll throw the rascals out. Yet in an autocracy, protest has a deeper
purpose: to bring down the very institutions of government and change
the way the people are governed.</p>
<p>Autocrats dislike freedoms because they make it easy for people to
learn of their shared misery and to collaborate with each other to rise
up against the government. Given their druthers, autocrats eliminate
freedom of assembly, a free press, and free speech whenever they can,
thereby insulating themselves from the threat of the people.
Unfortunately for autocrats, without the public goods benefits from
these freedoms, people can find it hard to work effectively because they
cannot easily exchange ideas even about how to improve the workplace.
And if the people don’t work effectively, then the leader cannot collect
tax revenues.</p>
<p>Autocrats must find the right balance. Without enough freedom the
people are less productive and do little work, but give them too many
freedoms and they pose a threat to the leader. The degree to which
autocrats rely on taxation to fund the government limits the extent to
which they can oppress the people.</p>
<p>Nations awash with natural resource wealth or lavished with foreign
aid rarely democratize. They are the world’s most oppressive places.
Their leaders have resources to reward their essential supporters
without having to empower the people. In such societies, though the
people really desire change, they cannot act upon these wants. Without
the ability to assemble, coordinating against the government is
difficult. What is more, the people know the leader can afford to pay
the coalition to oppress them. With little chance of success, the people
keep their heads down. Protest is rare, and when it occurs it is
answered with even greater repression.</p>
<p>But what happens if the money dries up?</p>
<p>Take a look back at Figure 7.1 in the previous chapter, where we
graphed Egypt’s foreign aid receipts through 2020. US aid to Egypt has
been dropping as Egypt’s peace with Israel has aged and matured. The
drop in aid has been substantial, and that means Egypt’s former
president, Hosni Mubarak, found himself in a weaker and weaker position
when it came to buying the loyal support of the military. The global
economic slowdown in 2007–2009 compounded the importance of aid for the
Egyptian regime. With money drying up, a chance was created for a
rebellion against Mubarak’s government. And indeed, in early 2011,
Mubarak, facing a poor economy and decreased aid receipts, also faced a
mass rebellion.</p>
<p>When autocrats lack abundant resources, they have a more difficult
time managing the people. First and foremost, leaders must pay their
essential backers or they will be gone. Leaders without adequate
revenues from aid, natural resources, or borrowing must obtain them by
encouraging the people to work and by taxing them. Unfortunately for
leaders, many of the public goods that increase productivity also
improve the people’s ability to coordinate and, therefore, protest.
Further, because the leader needs the tax revenues the workers provide,
such protests are more likely to be met with concessions than in a
resource-rich nation or one with huge cash reserves.</p>
<p>The factors that lead to rebellion are relatively uncomplicated. How
much a leader does to enhance the welfare of the people by providing
public goods determines the desire of the people to rebel. The level of
freedom determines the ease with which they can act upon these desires
by taking to the streets.</p>
<p>Yet, though high levels of both factors are in evidence in a host of
countries around the world, protests remain rare. They require a
spark.</p>
<p>SHOCKS RAISE REVOLTS</p>
<p>Shocks that trigger protest come in many forms. On rare occasions
protests happen spontaneously. But more often an event is needed to
shake up the system and trigger protest. In the collapse of the Soviet
Union and other Communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989, contagion
played a major role. Once one state fell, the people in the surrounding
states realized that their state was perhaps no longer invulnerable.
Free elections in Communist Poland triggered protests in East Germany.
When it became clear that security forces would not obey East German
leader Erich Honecker’s order to break up demonstrations, the protests
grew. Successful protest in Germany spawned demonstrations in
Czechoslovakia, and so on. As each state fell, it provided a yet
stronger signal to the peoples of the remaining Communist states. The
states fell like dominos. And each was suffering from a poorly
performing economy, so the Eastern European dictators could no longer
assure private advantages for their supporters. Quite the contrary, they
had been reduced to a state in which many of their henchmen understood
it was better to abandon the dictator than go down in a blaze of glory
with their failed regimes. Much the same story repeated itself in the
Middle East in 2011. As Tunisia fell, the people of Egypt realized that
their leader might also be vulnerable. So contagious was the belief that
rebellion could succeed that the once rock-steady Middle East quickly
became fertile ground for mass movements. People in Bahrain, Jordan,
Yemen, Syria, Libya, and elsewhere tried their luck.</p>
<p>A massive natural disaster, an unanticipated succession crisis, or a
global economic downturn that drives the autocrat’s local economy to the
brink or beyond the brink of bankruptcy can also provide a rallying cry
for protesters. Most crucially, as the experiences of the shah, Marcos,
and Mobutu remind us, sudden serious illness is a shock that drives the
coalition away from their leader, opening the door to both rebellion and
coups. Still other shocks can be “planned”—that is, events or occasions
chosen by an autocrat who misjudges the risks involved. One common
example is a rigged election.</p>
<p>Dictators seem to like to hold elections. Whether they do so to
satisfy international pressure (and gain more foreign aid), to dispel
domestic unrest, or to gain a misleading sense of legitimacy, their
preference is to rig the vote count. Elections are nice, but winning is
nicer. Still, sometimes the people seize the moment of an election to
shock the incumbent, voting so overwhelmingly for someone else that it
is hard to cover up the true outcome.</p>
<p>Liberia’s Sergeant Doe was foolish enough to hold an election. In
doing so, he provided the impetus for protest that he was lucky to
survive. In 1985, Thomas Quiwonkpa challenged Samuel Doe after it took
weeks for Liberia’s electoral commission to “count” the votes. Perhaps
Quiwonkpa took the commission’s dalliance as a sign of popular support
and equally a sign of the commission’s lack of support for him. As his
insurgency approached the capital, Monrovia, the masses took to the
streets against Doe’s government. Unfortunately for them, Doe’s
essential supporters remained loyal. The costs of protest became very
real. Doe’s soldiers killed hundreds in retribution.</p>
<p>In post-Soviet Eastern Europe, “legitimizing” elections helped to
promote citizen uprisings. Rather than sustaining the regimes in power,
elections created the opportunity to replace them. In 2004, the
incumbent Ukrainian leader, Leonid Kuchma, having served two terms,
decided—perhaps to the surprise of his essential backers—to respect the
two-term limit and retire. His chosen successor was Viktor Yanukovych.
The run-up to the election looked like it came straight out of a John le
Carré spy novel, with the leading opposition candidate, Viktor
Yushchenko, allegedly poisoned with dioxin, which left him horribly
disfigured.</p>
<p>In the first round of the elections in October, each of the leading
candidates received about 39 percent of the vote. This necessitated a
runoff election on November 21, in which the official results differed
greatly from exit polls. Even before the second-round presidential
runoff was complete, Yushchenko called for the people to take to the
streets. The electoral commission declared Yanukovych the winner.
However, protests mounted, and the security forces withdrew. Eventually
the Supreme Court ruled that given the high level of fraud, another
ballot was needed. Yushchenko then won the election handily.</p>
<p>Coalition dynamics play a key role in explaining why the security
forces allowed the people to take to the streets. The president was
changing. Although the retiring incumbent, Kuchma, backed Yanukovych, he
could not assure core supporters within the security forces that they
would be retained after the transition. As we saw with Louis XIV and
many others, newly empowered leaders, even when they have been chosen by
their predecessor, are wise to shake up their coalition, bring in their
own loyalists, and dump many of their predecessor’s erstwhile backers.
The security forces, being uncertain whether they would keep their
long-run privileges, declined to attack the masses, hedging their bets
about who would be more likely to reward them. Without force to control
the masses on the street, Yanukovych’s supporters deserted. The people
brought Yushchenko to power, but an essential factor in their
willingness to take to the streets was the apparent lack of support for
Yanukovych by the security forces.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shocks that spark revolt come as a total surprise.
Natural disasters, while bringing misery to the people, can also empower
them. One frequent consequence of earthquakes, hurricanes, and droughts
is that vast numbers of people are forced from their homes. If they are
permitted to gather in refugee camps, then they have the opportunity to
organize against the government. You see, refugee camps have the
unintended consequence of facilitating free assembly. Earthquakes,
storms, and volcanoes can concentrate large numbers of desperate people
with little to lose. They also can substantially weaken the state’s
capacity to control the people.</p>
<p>On the morning of September 19, 1985, an 8.1 magnitude earthquake
occurred in the Pacific Ocean about 350 kilometers from Mexico City.
Mexico City is geologically vulnerable because it was built on the soft
foundation of the remains of Lake Texcoco. The clay silts and sands that
make up the lake bed plus the soil’s high water content led to
liquefaction (wherein the ground behaves like a liquid) during the
earthquake. The city was also built in the absence of democratic rule,
so few building codes had been enforced. As a result, the distant quake
caused enormous devastation throughout the city. The death toll is
highly disputed but is thought to be between 10,000 and 30,000 people.
An additional 250,000 were made homeless. The government did virtually
nothing. Left to rescue themselves, the people formed crews to dig for
survivors and organized refugee camps.</p>
<p>Born of necessity, these camps became the foundation for an important
political force in Mexico City. Where there had been separate
individuals unhappy with their government, the earthquake formed a
concentrated mass of desperate people. Forced together into crowded
camps, they shared their disillusionment about the government.
Organizing a protest rally was suddenly relatively easy. Ready and
willing participants were on hand and had little to lose. With the
government largely absent, these social groups became important
political forces that rapidly deployed large antigovernment
demonstrations. Unable to oppose these groups, the government sought to
accommodate them. It is widely believed they played a key role in
Mexico’s democratization.4</p>
<p>The story of Anastasio Somoza’s deposition in the Nicaraguan
revolution in 1979 is broadly similar. In 1972, a 6.2 magnitude
earthquake struck the capital of Managua, killing around 5,000 people
and rendering about 250,000 people homeless. Somoza and his cronies
profited from disaster relief but did nothing to resettle the enormous
number of homeless people who had gathered in refugee camps in the
capital. These camps became organizing grounds for the activists who
eventually ended Somoza’s reign.</p>
<p>Not all autocrats make the mistake of ignoring disasters or ignoring
the creation of refugee camps. Consider the case of Myanmar in 2008.
Than Shwe was the military leader of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).
Although he has been described as an unremarkable man, he understood the
essentials of staying in power.5 On May 2, 2008, a massive cyclone named
Nargis swept across the Irrawaddy Delta in southern Burma, causing
havoc. The delta’s residents, mainly poor fishermen and farmers, had
received no advance warning of the storm, which destroyed entire towns
and villages. The official death toll is 138,000, though other estimates
suggest it might be as high as 500,000.</p>
<p>No one can blame Than Shwe for the storm or for the low-lying
villages’ vulnerability to storm surge. However, Myanmar’s military
regime provided no warning before and did nothing to help the survivors
after, and for that they can be blamed. Indeed they did worse than
nothing: they actively prevented help from being delivered. Many people
in Rangoon, a major city in southern Myanmar that was itself heavily
damaged by the storm, attempted to help those in the delta. They were
not allowed. Small businessmen and traders were reduced to smuggling
small amounts of food into what remained of towns and villages.</p>
<p>The international community rallied to offer assistance. As tens or
possibly hundreds of thousands of people died of hunger and thirst in
the aftermath of the storm, ships full of disaster relief supplies sat
off the coast. The military junta refused to allow relief workers in.
Visas were almost impossible to obtain. Information was extremely
scarce. The government requested aid but asked that it be in the form of
bilateral government-to-government assistance. Effectively, Than Shwe
was saying, “Send cash, but you can’t come in.”</p>
<p>About a week after the disaster, the army started entering the larger
towns and villages of the delta. They were not there to help. They were
there to disperse survivors who had congregated in schools and temples.
Even though their numbers rarely exceeded a few hundred, survivors were
expelled from their shelters and told to return home. It mattered little
that, in most cases, their entire village had been destroyed and they
had no food, water, clothing, or shelter to return to. Indeed, one
report observed, “Survivors were loaded onto boats and ferried back to
the destroyed villages they had recently escaped from. In some areas the
clearances happened quickly; as the emergency phase was now officially
over, the authorities wanted people back in their villages by June 2,
when the next school term was scheduled to begin. But survivors had no
idea what they were returning to; was there even anything left at places
they had once called home? And how would they get food and water
there?”6</p>
<p>The government did not even attempt to answer these questions.</p>
<p>In the episode “Eyes of the Storm: Turning Points in Burmese History”
of the PBS documentary series Wide Angle, a senior Burmese general is
seen addressing a group of survivors.7 Starving and destitute, they ask
for a handful of rice. The general tells them that he is here now (but
makes no offer of assistance) and that they must go back to their
village and “work hard.” While the army seized (and sold on the black
market) the few relief supplies allowed in, the people were told they
could eat frogs. Effectively, the government told these survivors to go
away and die quietly: inhumane in the extreme, but good small-coalition
politics. Dead people cannot protest.</p>
<p>ARE DISASTERS ALWAYS DISASTERS FOR GOVERNMENT SURVIVAL?</p>
<p>Earthquakes and other disasters shake up political systems. However,
the nature of the shake-up is very different under different
institutions. Democratic leaders are very sensitive to disaster-related
casualties. Allowing people to die reveals serious policy failure.
Democrats need to deliver good public policy to reward their large
number of backers. When they fail to do so, they are liable to be
removed. Disaster-related deaths result in protest and in the removal of
leaders in democracies.</p>
<p>To illustrate the difference in political responses to poor disaster
relief in nondemocratic and democratic settings, we contrast Cyclone
Nargis with Hurricane Katrina. Katrina struck the US Gulf Coast in
August 2005. This was the most costly natural disaster in US history up
to that time, with damages estimated at 1 billion. The death toll was
1,836.</p>
<p>The government, from President George W. Bush down to New Orleans
mayor Ray Nagin, were accused of mismanagement and lack of leadership.
Nagin delayed the evacuation order for the city until nineteen hours
before the storm struck. As a result, many people became trapped. Then,
once the Superdome football stadium was set up as an emergency center,
it became overwhelmed when thirty thousand rather than the anticipated
eight hundred people showed up. Federal disaster relief was slow in
arriving. Many of the casualties were the sick and elderly who were
overcome by heat and dehydration.</p>
<p>The tenure of US leaders was seriously jeopardized by the disaster.
Many observers think Katrina contributed significantly to the Republican
Party’s midterm electoral losses in 2006 and their significant losses,
including the presidency, in 2008. Yet, while it is clear that the
situation could have been handled much better, it bears no resemblance
to Cyclone Nargis. In contrast, despite having allowed at least 138,000
people to die, Than Shwe felt sufficiently well entrenched to allow a
farcical election in 2010, which the government-backed parties won
easily (at least according to official sources).</p>
<p>As seen in the cases of Mexico and Nicaragua, disasters can serve as
rallying points in autocracies. Disasters can concentrate opponents of
the regime, making it easier for them to coordinate. Yet the death toll
from disasters has relatively little effect on a dictator’s chance of
staying in power. Indeed, if anything, large numbers of people dying in
disasters actually enhances the political survival of autocratic
leaders.</p>
<p>As we know, autocrats don’t buy political support with efficient
public policy. Resources spent saving lives cannot be spent on cronies.
In addition, as we have seen, autocrats are skilled at exploiting the
international community. By letting more people die, they may be able to
extract more relief assistance. The implications of these results are
frightening. Small wonder, then, that far more people die in natural
disasters in autocracies than in democracies.</p>
<p>Letting people die is good governance for autocrats, but it is
disastrous for the tenure of democrats. Although a detailed statistical
analysis of the relationship between disasters, deaths, and leader
tenure is complex,8 we compared what happens in a country when two
hundred or more people die in a magnitude 5+ earthquake to what happens
in the same size earthquake if fewer people die. In particular, we
looked at the effect of such circumstances on the odds of a country’s
leader being removed from office within two years following the
earthquake.</p>
<p>An earthquake alone does not threaten the survival of democrats.
However, if more than two hundred people are killed by the quake, then a
democratic leader is almost certain to be removed from office. Under
normal circumstances, any democrat has a 40 percent chance of being
ousted from office in any two-year period. But for a democrat whose
country suffered two hundred or more deaths in an earthquake, those odds
rise to 91 percent. We believe this is the case because democratic
leaders are supposed to deliver effective public policies, and those
effective policies include ensuring that good building codes are
enforced and excellent rescue and recovery is implemented following a
natural disaster. Many deaths in such a disaster are a signal to
everyone else that the leadership has not done an adequate job of
protecting the people, and so out go the leaders.</p>
<p>Autocrats are less vulnerable to removal than democrats, and
earthquake-related deaths have little effect on their hold on power.
Over a typical two-year period, 22 percent of autocrats lose power. If
their country suffers a magnitude 5 or greater earthquake in the first
year of this two-year window, the dictator’s risk of being removed goes
up to 30 percent. However, the autocrat’s risk of removal rises only to
24 percent if the earthquake killed more than two hundred people.
Earthquakes pose a threat to autocratic leaders when people are forced
into refugee camps and can organize against the regime. People killed in
an earthquake can’t organize and so do not endanger a dictator’s
survival in office. As might be expected, given these facts and the
incentives they suggest, instances of two hundred or more people dying
in earthquakes is much more common in autocracies than democracies.9</p>
<p>Not all disasters are equal in the eyes of autocrats. Dictators are
particularly wary of natural disasters when they occur in politically
and economically important centers. Disaster management in China
emphasizes this point. When an earthquake struck the remote province of
Qinghai in 2010, the Chinese government’s response was, at best,
half-hearted. In contrast, its handling of disaster relief in the wake
of a 2008 earthquake in Sichuan won the approval of much of the
international community. The differences are stark and driven by
politics. The Sichuan quake occurred in an economically and politically
important center where a massed protest could potentially threaten the
government. Qinghai is remote and of little political importance.
Protest there would do little to threaten the government. The government
did much less to assist people who could not threaten them.</p>
<p>RESPONDING TO REVOLUTION OR ITS THREAT</p>
<p>Whether because of an unforeseen earthquake, a succession crisis, or
a financial meltdown, the threat of rebellion can rise and strike a
leader like a lightning bolt. What, then, is the right response to such
a threat? History teaches us that some autocrats crack down hard on
rebels; some succumb to them; and some reform on their own. The rules
governing politics help us understand how different circumstances lead
to different choices among these options.</p>
<p>Successful rebellions, mass movements, and revolutions are not
commonplace, but neither are they extremely rare. Successful rebellions
that turn into sustained democracies are pretty rare. They do happen,
but more commonly revolution replaces one small-coalition system with
another. While many revolutions fail to deliver what their participants
hoped for, the threat of revolution can be an important driver of
political change. Leaders far prefer to rule through a small coalition;
that is the essence of rule one. Yet sometimes the people create a
credible threat because the leader lacks either the funds or sufficient
coalition loyalty to crack enough heads to keep the people off the
street. Under such conditions, leaders decide it is better to reform
than be swept away. Of course, the canny leader will “democratize”
according to the rules to rule by: that is to say, by minimizing the
expansion of the coalition and maximizing the expansion of the
selectorate.</p>
<p>As we write in April 2021, Myanmar is engulfed in protests following
a military coup on February 1. Earlier, we saw the lengths General Than
Shwe went to in order to prevent protests in the wake of Cyclone Nargis
in 2008. However, he was obviously aware of the threat that the people
posed. In 2008, he started talks with opposition leaders including Aung
San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burmese independence leader Aung San, Nobel
Peace Prize winner and leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD)
party. The NLD claimed to have won the 1990 election with 58.7 percent
of the popular vote and 392 out of 492 seats. At that time the military
junta chose to ignore the election results and continue ruling. However,
as we will see, circumstances changed, and by 2008 the junta was
prepared to compromise. Talks led to constitutional reforms and
elections in 2010. The NLD boycotted these elections, and so the Union
Solidarity and Development Party—effectively the military in civilian
clothing—won. However, in the 2015 election the NLD won an overwhelming
victory, taking 235 of 330 available seats in the Lower House; the
remaining 110 seats in this house were military appointments. Aung San
Suu Kyi became Myanmar’s de facto leader. Her official role was state
counselor (a position similar to prime minister). The military included
a constitutional provision that prevented her from becoming president
because her late husband and her children were foreign born. In the
November 2020 election, her party gained an additional three seats.
However, the day before the new parliament was to be sworn in, a
military coup ended (at least for now) Myanmar’s nascent democracy.
Protests and rebellions shape the trajectory of nations, and,
importantly, they do so both as latent threats and actualized
events.</p>
<p>Myanmar’s experience leaves us with a perplexing question. Given Than
Shwe’s demonstrated ability to suppress the people during his time in
power, we need to question why Shwe started the reform process that led
to elections that he and his backers lost. None of us would regard the
2010 elections as free and fair, and the 2008 constitution guaranteed
the army 25 percent of the parliamentary seats. However, institutions
clearly became more inclusive after 2008. On our 0 to 1 scale, by 2020
(the date of the most recent election) Myanmar’s winning coalition had
increased to 0.62: far from accountable governance, but a huge increase
from the coalition size of 0.32 in 2008.</p>
<p>Why would Than Shwe agree to such changes? The answer, we believe,
lies in a growing budget difficulty. As events in September 2007 showed,
the army was perfectly capable of putting down protests, but it needed
to be well compensated. Junta leaders have relatively little budgetary
discretion. Sure, juntas are small-coalition systems, but they are also
small-selectorate systems. Shwe needed to choose his supporters from the
upper ranks of the military, which limited the availability of potential
replacements. With only a small risk of replacement, Shwe’s supporters
expected to be well compensated for their loyalty.</p>
<p>In the late 2000s Myanmar’s natural resource rents declined
precipitously. According to World Bank data, in 2006 natural resource
rents accounted for 13.5 percent of GDP. By 2010 this figure had
declined to 5.9 percent.10 We should treat these numbers with caution
because lots of revenue bypassed official accounts, but the trend was
clear. Shwe had a budgetary, which is to say a political, problem. With
a coalition whose fickle loyalty needed to be bought and much less money
coming in, Shwe needed to find a way to increase revenues and increase
loyalty. Getting the people to work meant giving them more, although
still limited, freedoms. Increasing loyalty meant enlarging the
selectorate. Partial democratization provided Shwe and the military a
way to survive their political problem. Survival came at the cost of an
enlarged winning coalition, and Shwe was forced to step aside in favor
of Thein Sein in 2010. But by securing 25 percent of parliamentary seats
for the military as part of the deal, the junta insiders could hope to
continue to receive at least some of the perks they were accustomed
to.</p>
<p>Than Shwe allowed for limited democracy not because he wanted to
empower and enrich the Burmese people but because he couldn’t afford not
to. Why, then, did the military seize power in 2021? One answer is:
because they could. But as we write, the outcome still remains up in the
air. Despite harsh clampdowns, protests continue. Burmese democracy is
flawed, but the people clearly prefer it to junta rule. The military’s
actions are clearly a gamble, so we need to consider the timing of their
choice. The COVID pandemic plays in the military’s favor. Social
distancing is incompatible with mass protests, especially in military
regimes, and Aung San Suu Kyi and numerous other government officials
were arrested for violating COVID restrictions. Yet coalition dynamics
are probably the most important consideration in the military’s
timing.</p>
<p>The NLD’s increased parliamentary majority meant that they might be
able to push the military out of power completely, perhaps by reforming
the constitution to eliminate the military’s 110 automatic seats. If the
upper brass sat back and allowed themselves to be replaced, then they
would be powerless. If they allowed the new parliament to be sworn in,
they would have been in a considerably weaker position. In 2016 Turkey’s
military attempted a coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. They
did so when they learned that they were about to be shuffled out of the
coalition. But they had waited too long; Erdoğan had already replaced
enough of their numbers. Myanmar’s military rolled the dice because for
them it was probably now or never. Once replaced, they would be
powerless, a few among many in the vastly enlarged selectorate of a
relatively corrupt mass franchise electoral system.</p>
<p>POWER TO THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>A few of history’s revolutionaries stand out for their success not
only in overthrowing a nasty regime but also in creating a
people-friendly government in its place. America’s George Washington,
South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru, and the
Philippines’ Corazon Aquino (at least for a while) are a few cases in
point. Perhaps even more interestingly, a few leaders threatened with
revolution have also democratized as a way to keep themselves in power.
Ghana’s Jerry John “J.J.” Rawlings is a perfect example. Common threads
run through each of these democratizers—common threads that are absent
from revolutions that replaced one dictator with another, such as
occurred under Mao Zedong in China, Fidel Castro in Cuba, Porfirio Díaz
in Mexico, and Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya.</p>
<p>Democratic revolutions are most often fought by people who cannot
count on great natural resource wealth to sustain them once they
overthrow the predecessor regime. These “good” revolutionaries just are
not as lucky as Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro or Kazakhstan’s Nursultan
Nazarbayev. Although economic collapse prompted an extreme threat to
Maduro’s political survival in 2019, his oil wealth, along with
assistance from Russia, allowed him to prevail against a popular
rebellion. He had the money to buy soldiers and keep them loyal,
something his resource-poor Tunisian and Egyptian colleagues did not
have in 2011. They, like good revolutionaries, had to rely on the
productivity of the people to generate the revenues they needed to
reward supporters. To encourage the people to work productively, good
revolutionary leaders needed to increase the people’s freedoms. If the
people can meet and talk, then they can earn more. As a very simple
example, if farmers have access to telephones, newspapers, and radios,
then they can find out about market prices. This allows them to take the
crops to the right markets at the right time. Roads and transport
networks reduce transaction costs. Given the ability to earn more,
farmers work harder and the economy improves. Unfortunately, for a
leader, those same freedoms allow people to organize. The same media,
telecommunications, and roads that increase productivity also make it
much easier for the same farmers to hear about antigovernment
demonstrations and join them. In much the same way that Mexico City’s
1985 earthquake lowered the barriers for coordination and organization,
increasing the public good of freedom makes protest more likely.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev faced a dilemma.
The economy of the Soviet Union was failing. Without additional
resources he could not continue to pay his essential backers. He might
have turned to oil—of which Russia has plenty—to save the day, but oil
prices were depressed in those years. His best shot at keeping rebellion
at bay was to liberalize the Soviet economy, even though that also meant
giving the people more power over their lives. Gorbachev showed himself
willing to take that risk.</p>
<p>Some might suggest that Gorbachev is a better person than Myanmar’s
General Shwe. Probably he is, although we cannot help but notice that he
cracked down on constitutionally protected secessionist movements in
Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. The Soviet military response
to the efforts of the people in those republics to gain their freedom is
hardly the response of an enlightened leader. The Soviet “black beret”
militia killed 14 and injured 150 people in Lithuania.11 A week later, 4
more people were killed and 20 injured when Soviet forces cracked down
on Latvia’s efforts to attain independence.12</p>
<p>Why did the enlightened Gorbachev take these harsh actions? He was
responding to political pressure from within his coalition. Top-ranking
Soviet military officers together with others urged Gorbachev to impose
direct Kremlin rule in breakaway provinces. They wrote in an open letter
that was circulated at the Congress of People’s Deputies, “If
constitutional methods prove ineffective against separatists, criminal
speculators and the paramilitary forces that are continuing to spill the
blood of the people, we suggest instituting a state of emergency and
presidential rule in zones of major conflicts.”13 Gorbachev understood
the political risks of ignoring key military and political figures in
his coalition of essentials.</p>
<p>Gorbachev’s failure to quash the secessionist movements was a
significant contributor to the decision by hard-liners in his government
to launch the coup that overthrew him. He was restored to
power—briefly—when the people, backed by Boris Yeltsin, occupied Red
Square and forced the coup makers to retreat. But for Gorbachev the
damage was done. He returned to power and recognized the independence of
Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, only to find himself unable to sustain
his government or even the existence of the Soviet Union. The Soviet
Union was formally dissolved three months later.</p>
<p>Gorbachev’s policy of perestroika, aimed at restructuring the Soviet
political and economic system, can be understood as his effort to
increase the government’s revenue to forestall just such problems as the
secessionist movements and their political aftermath. It didn’t work out
for him or the Soviet form of government, but that is what it means to
take risks. Sometimes they turn out your way and sometimes they
don’t.</p>
<p>Today Russia is backsliding away from democratization. While under
Boris Yeltsin’s post-Gorbachev government Russia maintained free and
competitive elections, that is no longer true today. Vladimir Putin,
former member of the Soviet secret police (the KGB) and Yeltsin’s
immediate successor, moved the political system sharply back from its
emerging dependence on a large coalition and good governance. He made it
much more difficult for opposition parties to compete by severely
restricting freedom of assembly. He made it much more difficult for
opposition candidates to get their message across by nationalizing
television and much of the print media. He made it much more difficult
for people to articulate their dissatisfaction by making it a crime to
make public arguments that disparaged the government. It seems he had
many of his most effective opponents murdered, even reaching beyond
Russia’s borders to do so. In short, he systematically reduced the
availability of freedoms that compel a democratic government to attend
to the wishes of the people. Why could he do this? As we have noted,
Russia is awash in oil wealth. During Putin’s time, unlike poor
Gorbachev’s, oil prices were at record highs, so he could pay key
backers to help him quash opposition and possibly even have enough extra
money to keep the people happy enough not to rebel against their loss of
freedom. The upshot: he has been in power for more than twenty years and
counting.</p>
<p>The expansion of freedoms is a sure sign of impending
democratization. Economic necessity is one factor that produces such a
concession. Another is coming to power on the back of a large coalition.
This was George Washington’s, Nelson Mandela’s, and Jawaharlal Nehru’s
circumstance. For different reasons, each started out with a big
coalition and was pretty much locked into trying to sustain it, at least
for a while, if their government was to survive.</p>
<p>When Washington became president of the United States, the term
“United States” was treated as a plural noun. Back then people
identified more strongly with their state than with the nation.
Washington headed an army that depended on recruits from thirteen
distinct colonies, each with its own government and each paying for its
military contingent out of its own pocketbook. Washington needed the
support of a broad base of colonists, and so he was stuck with a large
coalition from the get-go. In that circumstance he had to do what large
coalition leaders do—disproportionately deliver public goods rather than
private benefits. First among these public goods was the Bill of Rights,
which guaranteed the very freedoms that are central to democratic,
large-coalition governance. Without these, the colonies would not have
agreed to ratify the Constitution and unite under a single
government.</p>
<p>Nelson Mandela’s story is not much different. His political movement,
the African National Congress (ANC), spent decades fighting the
white-dominated apartheid regimes of South Africa. Despite their efforts
and the protracted use of violence, they were unable to grow strong
enough to overthrow their oppressors through force. Nelson Mandela, who
served twenty-seven years in prison for his antigovernment stance and
who refused early release from prison on the condition of eschewing
violence, eventually saw another way.</p>
<p>Possibly due to the effects of sanctions, the South African economy
went into a sharp decline during the 1980s. In 1980, per capita income
in 2010 constant US dollars was ,722. But by 1993, the year in which F.
W. de Klerk’s apartheid regime passed a new constitution paving the way
for elections for all races, it had fallen to ,518.14 De Klerk and his
long-term predecessor, Pik Botha, were in trouble because with the
economy in decline they did not have sufficient resources to buy the
continued loyalty required to keep the people suppressed. Under those
conditions, more money was needed to sustain the government. That money
could only be gotten from the people, and many of them were already
rebelling against the apartheid government. Faced with very tough
circumstances, the apartheid regime had a choice: fight to the bitter
end or cut a deal with Mandela. They chose the latter course.</p>
<p>The large-coalition compromise deal with Mandela and his ANC meant
allowing all South Africans equal rights. In practice, this meant that
the voting majority was turned over to the very people who were most
discriminated against during the years of apartheid. As a result, the
country became more democratic and its people freer. But, as is so often
true with new democracies, as the incumbent ANC’s interests have come
more and more to dominate the government, democracy has been eroded. We
estimate that South Africa’s coalition size at the time of its first
free election in 1994 was 0.87. Today, more than a quarter century
later, it is down to 0.78. Competitive, democratic governance has faced,
and seems to continue to face, a slow erosion. The reduction in the size
of South Africa’s group of essentials signals the real danger down the
road that, unless the opposition wins office and leadership is swapped
back and forth between different political parties, South Africa could
go the way of Zimbabwe. Like South Africa, Zimbabwe started out on a
positive path to democracy based on a large-coalition deal between
Joshua Nkomo’s ZAPU, Robert Mugabe’s ZANU party, and Ian Smith’s
white-only UDI government. But once Mugabe became sufficiently
entrenched, he, like Putin in Russia, was able to overturn the progress
toward democratization. He plunged Zimbabwe back into the role of a
corrupt, rent-seeking, small-coalition regime that serves the interest
of the few at the expense of the many, Black and white.</p>
<p>The successes of Washington, Mandela, and others were duplicated from
a very different starting place in the case of Ghana. There, revolution
did not lead to democracy so much as the anticipation of revolution
did.</p>
<p>Ghana’s J.J. Rawlings understood well that liberalizing Ghana’s
economy and empowering the people could endanger his hold on power. But
he also recognized that liberalization did not mean that the people
would inevitably end up revolting or that the coalition would turn on
its leader. Rawlings became the poster boy for the IMF and World Bank.
He implemented the economic reforms they prescribed, invigorated the
economy, and instituted democratic reforms, and after serving two terms
as president of Ghana, he stepped down. But that is not how he started
out. And the people were not as happy with him as this rosy picture
would suggest; at least not if you believe what Adu Boahen, a professor
and leading political opponent, had to say.</p>
<p>Boahen recounted Rawlings’s explanation for the seeming passivity of
the Ghanaian people. Here’s his summation of Rawlings’s stance:</p>
<p>The people have faced and continue to face hardship. Naturally,
people will grumble. But the fact that Ghanaians have been able to put
up with shortages, transport difficulties and low salaries, and other
problems without any major protest, is an indication of their confidence
in our integrity, the integrity and good intentions of the PNDC
[Provisional Nations Defense Council] government. Visitors from other
countries have commented that in their countries there would be riots if
conditions were similar to those here. But the people know that they are
not suffering to make a corrupt government rich at all, we are suffering
in order to concentrate all our resources in the building of a just and
prosperous society.</p>
<p>To this, Boahen responded, “I am afraid that I do not agree with
Rawlings’s explanation of the passivity of Ghanaians. We have not
protested or staged riots not because we trust the PNDC but because we
fear the PNDC! We are afraid of being detained, liquidated or dragged
before the CVC or NIC or being subjected to all sorts of molestation.…
They have been [protesting] but in a very subtle and quiet way—hence the
culture of silence.”15 Boahen portrays Ghana in 1989 as permeated by
oppression. Yet by 1989 things were much better than they had been, as
evidenced by the fact that Boahen could make such speeches in the first
place.</p>
<p>Rawlings’s seizure of power on January 11, 1982, is often described
in almost biblical terms. In reference to his initials, “J.J.,” he was
sometimes called “Junior Jesus,” and this was his second coming. He had
been the figurehead for a military revolt in 1979. Rawlings had
movie-star looks and exuded charisma. But charm was not what kept him in
power. Oppression and rich rewards for supporters are the staples of
leadership in small-coalition systems, and Rawlings was no exception. In
the first six months of his rule, 180 people were killed and 1,000 more
were arrested and tortured. His loyal soldiers were renowned for their
thuggish brutality, and Rawlings bought their loyalty through a massive
increase in military spending. J.J. knew whose support he needed, and
despite the economy’s collapse and a complete meltdown of government
finances, he paid them first.</p>
<p>Rawlings had a talent for preventing protest. He stifled any critical
press by restricting the supply of paper. His supporters infiltrated the
trade unions and effectively made strikes impossible for many years. He
avoided free assembly at every turn. Events a year into his rule
demonstrate his considerable organizational talents. In January 1983,
Nigeria announced the expulsion of 1.4 million Ghanaians working in
Nigeria. In a few weeks 10 percent of the population, most of them young
adults, flooded back into a poverty-stricken Ghana. The prospects of
hundreds of thousands of disgruntled and unemployed people milling
around the capital terrified many in the government, some of whom
advocated closing the border to prevent them from arriving. Instead,
Rawlings welcomed them with open arms, but he almost immediately ensured
the returnees were transported back to their home villages. His massive
transport undertaking prevented the formation of the kind of camps that
overwhelmed Mexico and Nicaragua. And it was a much more humane approach
than Shwe’s.</p>
<p>Rawlings’s fundamental problem was that Ghana was broke and the
economy had nearly completely collapsed. Ghana’s food production was the
second lowest in Africa, ahead of only Chad. Rigged exchange rates lay
at the heart of Ghana’s economic problems and its system of political
rewards. The official exchange rate for Ghana’s currency, the cedi, was
much higher than the black market rate. Essential backers were allowed
to exchange money at the official exchange rate and then convert it on
the street. Unfortunately this eroded incentives for farmers. By the
early 1980s, it often cost farmers more to buy fuel to take goods to
markets than they earned by selling them. Seventy percent of the crops
that did make it to market were carried on people’s heads. Smuggling
crops across the border to the Ivory Coast became the norm. The
government responded by making smuggling a capital crime. With little
being produced for export, Ghana had exhausted its capacity to borrow
and was going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Rawlings had a big problem. He had seized power and wanted to pursue
a revolutionary socialist agenda, but he needed money. As Naomi Chazan
phrased it, “The question was no longer where resources were located but
if they existed at all.”16 To start with, Rawlings closed all the
universities and had students help bring in the harvests. But such
measures were not enough. The people were hungry. Ghana had insufficient
funds to pay for food imports and to pay the army. As a good
rule-abiding autocrat, Rawlings knew his priorities: pay the army! Soon
the term Rawlings necklace became a popular euphemism for the protruding
collarbones common among the emaciated people. He approached the Soviet
Union, but they had their own financial problems, and despite his move
to the political left, they declined to support him.</p>
<p>J.J. was between a rock and a hard place. He needed money, and the
only way left to get it was to encourage the people to get back to work.
At the beginning of 1983 he enacted a radical reversal of policy. The
cedi was allowed to devalue. Producer prices paid to farmers were
increased, and subsidies for gas, electricity, and health care were cut.
International financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank were
delighted to have an adherent to their policies, but many of his closest
allies were not as happy. This policy switch was accompanied by a change
in personnel. Rawlings orchestrated a coup and made it a fait accompli
before his targets could organize and retaliate. Overnight his closest
supporters found themselves without influence. Some, such as J. Amartey
Kwei, were executed (allegedly for his part in a notorious murder of
judges). Others, such as the radical student activist Chris Atim, fled
into exile.</p>
<p>It is telling that by 1985, Rawlings was the only remaining member of
the original ruling PNDC council. As a further sign of the direction
Rawlings’s administration was taking, that council swelled from six
members to ten. No leader voluntarily increases the number of people to
whom he is beholden unless he thinks that doing so will help him stay in
power.</p>
<p>As is to be expected, Rawlings was a reluctant democrat. He simply
had few options left. He needed money. To get it, he implemented
policies that empowered the people. Gradually, they could demand more.
“Rawlings was a victim of his own success.” He had given the people a
voice by liberalizing the economy and opening the airwaves. There was
the perception of increased confidence. With the economic crisis
resolved, the people began to feel that they could “do this without
someone telling [them] what to do.”17</p>
<p>As we have seen, by 1989 Boahen felt comfortable openly criticizing
Rawlings. Even he had to admit reforms had improved the economy. The
“Rawlings necklace” had been replaced by the “Rawlings waistcoat” (a fat
belly). Having had to implement policies to keep the masses happy,
Rawlings allowed a gradual expansion of the coalition to accompany the
expansion in public goods. In 1988 and 1989 local elections were
allowed. Rather than provoke mass protest, Rawlings stayed one step
ahead of the people. As a loose affiliation of political interests
coalesced into the People’s Movement for Freedom and Justice and called
for multiparty elections, Rawlings defused their anger by organizing
elections while the opposition was still disorganized. In the 1991
presidential election he decisively defeated Adu Boahen, who ran as the
leader of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). Although there were some
discrepancies, international observers declared the results basically
fair.</p>
<p>Elections have been basically fair ever since. Rawlings and his
National Democratic Congress party won again in 1996, beating John
Kufuor. In 2000, Rawlings stepped down and John Kufuor went on to serve
the constitutional limit of two terms as president. In 2008 the NDC
candidate, Atta Mills, became president. Ghana held highly competitive
elections. The NDC held on to power in 2012, and the NPP won in 2016 and
2020.</p>
<p>Rawlings needed money, and the only way he could get it was to
empower the people. By allowing the people to assemble and communicate
he increased their productivity. But he also made it easier for them to
coordinate and organize against him. He successfully avoided protest and
revolution only by remaining one step ahead of the people in terms of
granting concessions. Yet he could not avoid protest indefinitely. In
1995 between fifty thousand and a hundred thousand people joined Kume
Preko (which literally means “You may as well kill me,” indicating “We
have had enough”) marches through downtown Accra, the capital. Although
the government sought to prevent these marches, the courts overruled
them. An independent judiciary encourages entrepreneurial zeal, but it
also protects the civil liberties of the people.</p>
<p>Today Ghana is an economically vibrant democracy. Its transition from
autocracy to democracy took place under the leadership of the
larger-than-life J.J. Rawlings. Yet it should be remembered that he was
a reluctant democrat. Had he had the necessary resources, he would have
perpetuated his socialist revolution. Ghana recently developed an
offshore oil field. Had these funds been available to J.J., or had the
Soviets had the resources to back him, then it is likely he would still
be in power and Ghana would be a much poorer and more oppressed
land.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Revolutionary moments often arise, as in the cases of Ghana, South
Africa, and the Soviet Union, when an economy is near collapse—so near,
in fact, that the leadership can no longer buy the military’s loyalty.
Such circumstances are practically inevitable in the life of the vast
majority of autocracies. Their rent-seeking, corrupt, inefficient
economic ways assure it.</p>
<p>At such moments the threatened government is more than likely to
blame the international community for its woes. After all, in exchange
for policy concessions, oppressive leaders have been able to borrow on
relatively easy terms from rich foreign governments and the
international banks they control. Now these governments face crushing
debt obligations and no money to pay them. Getting more money becomes
difficult exactly because they are in such danger of defaulting on their
debts. And what do many well-intentioned people cry out for them? Debt
forgiveness.</p>
<p>We must repeat what we said earlier. Financial crises, from an
autocratic leader’s perspective, are political crises. The leader hasn’t
cared a whit about destroying his country’s economy by stealing from the
public. Now that money is in such short supply that he can’t maintain
his coalition’s loyalty, there is a moment of opportunity for political
change. Forgive the debts and the leader will just start borrowing again
to pay his cronies and keep himself in power. Political scientist
Nicolas van de Walle compared the fates of regimes in Benin and Zambia
with those of regimes in Cameroon and the Ivory Coast during crises.18
In the former cases, international financial institutions withdrew
support and the nations democratized. In the latter cases, France
stepped in with financial support and no reform occurred.</p>
<p>So the first policy recommendation for outside observers when a
dictator faces national bankruptcy, and the protests likely to follow,
is this: Don’t save the dictator. Don’t forgive indebtedness unless the
dictator first puts his hold on power at real risk by permitting freedom
of assembly, a free press, freedom to create opposition parties, and
free, competitive elections in which the incumbent’s party is given no
advantages in campaign funds, rallies, or anything else. Only after such
freedoms and real political competition are in place might any debt
forgiveness be considered. Even the least hint of a fraudulent election
or cutbacks in freedom should be met by turning off the flow of
funds.</p>
<p>Foreign aid, as we have seen, is a boon to petty dictators and to
democratic donor citizens and leaders. That makes persuading people to
cut off aid to help promote democratization very difficult indeed. But
if the opportunity arises, it should be seized. Just like debt
forgiveness or new loans, foreign aid should be tied to the actuality of
political reform and not to its promise. When leaders put themselves at
risk of being thrown out by the people, then they show themselves worthy
of aid. When leaders allow their books to be audited and any corruption
to be publicized, then they are good candidates for aid designed to
improve the well-being of their people. Those who refuse to make
politics competitive or to expose and correct corruption will just steal
aid and should not get it if there is not an overwhelming national
security justification for continuing aid.</p>
<p>When a succession in leaders takes place, whether through revolution
or through the unexpected death or retirement of the person in power,
then there is a window of opportunity for real democratic change. We
have seen that the early part of an incumbent’s time in office carries
the highest risk of deposition. This is especially true for autocrats.
Indeed, they have a strong incentive to pretend to be democratic in
their first couple of years exactly because democrats have a better
chance of surviving that first period in office than autocrats. We saw
just such reforms coming out of Cuba, for instance, when Raúl Castro
took over from his brother Fidel. Raúl needed to consolidate his hold on
power and reassure his backers that he could provide for them, and to do
that he had to get Cuba’s economy to grow. Solution: introduce some
economic competition and a few acts of political liberalization. We will
probably see a repeat of such reform now that Raúl has “retired.”</p>
<p>Today Cubans can take greater advantage of private businesses than
was true at any time since the revolution. They can have cell phones and
some access to the internet, expanding their reach for information and
their ability to coordinate with fellow Cubans even when they are not
face to face. But will these reforms outlast Raúl? Will they be expanded
upon? Or will Raúl’s successor, like any newly ensconced autocrat,
consolidate his control over the flow of money and the loyalty of his
key backers and then pull back on reform? Sustained reform is unlikely
unless the international community exploits its brief window of
opportunity. It can do so by tying economic assistance to locking in
political liberalization.</p>
<p>All the methods mentioned above are exactly the tools that liberal
governments can adopt to promote lock-in of democratic reforms. But do
they have the will to do it? That, sadly, is unlikely—and for that
problem we have not yet found a cure.</p>
