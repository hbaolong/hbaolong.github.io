STEAL FROM THE POOR, GIVE TO THE RICH</h4>
<p>Whether you’re taking charge of the Ottoman Empire, a corporation, or
Liberia, controlling the flow of funds is essential to buying support.
However, once you’ve emptied the state’s or corporation’s coffers in
order to buy off both your essential supporters and their replacements,
if necessary, you must reckon with the entirely new challenge of
refilling the treasury. If a leader cannot find a reliable source of
income, then it is only a matter of time until someone else will offer
his supporters greater rewards than he can.</p>
<p>Money is essential for anyone who wants to run any organization.
Without their share of the state’s rewards, hardly anyone will stick
with an incumbent for long. Liberia’s Prince Johnson knew this when he
tortured Samuel Doe and demanded the numbers of the bank accounts where
the state’s treasure had been hidden. Without getting his question
answered, Johnson would not be able to secure power for himself. In
fact, neither he nor rival insurgent Charles Taylor could secure enough
state revenue to buy control of Liberia’s government immediately after
Doe was overthrown. The upshot: Samuel Doe died under Prince Johnson’s
torture without answering the question “Where’s the money?” and Liberia
degenerated into civil war. Each faction was able to extract enough
resources to buy support in a small region, but no one could control the
state as a whole.</p>
<p>The succession process in the Ottoman Empire is another illustration
of the same point. Upon the death of their father, the Ottoman princes
rushed from their provinces to secure the treasury, buy the loyalty of
the army, and have all their potential rivals (also known as their
brothers) strangled. Whoever secured control over the money first was
likely to win. If no one son triumphed, cleanly wresting the treasury
out of his siblings’ control, then no one could summon the necessary
revenues to pay his backers. The common result was, as in Liberia, civil
war.</p>
<p>Knowing where the money is, is particularly important in
autocracies—and particularly difficult. Such regimes are shrouded in
secrecy. Supporters must be paid, but there are no accurate accounts
detailing stocks and flows of wealth. Of course, this lack of
transparency is by design.1 Thus does chaotic bookkeeping become a kind
of insurance policy: it becomes vastly more difficult for a rival to
promise to pay supporters if he cannot match existing bribes or, for
that matter, put his hands on the money. Indeed, secrecy not only
provides insurance against rivals, but it also keeps supporters in the
dark about what other supporters are getting. Anyone who has tried to
read the annual reports of publicly traded firms will quickly realize
that this is a practice induced by dependence on a small winning
coalition. In the corporate setting there is opacity even though the
company has to satisfy strict regulations and accounting standards.
Secrecy ensures that everyone gets the deal they can negotiate, not
knowing how much it might cost to replace them. Thus every supporter’s
price is kept as low as possible, and woe to any supporter who is
discovered trying to coordinate with his fellow coalition members to
raise their price.</p>
<p>As we saw at the end of the last chapter, it is very difficult for
autocrats to survive their early months in office. Good governance is a
luxury they cannot afford at a time when they must scramble to find
revenues. Little surprise, then, that we so often see looting,
confiscations, extraction, and fire sales during political
transitions—or conversely, and perhaps ironically, temporary liberal
reforms by would-be dictators who are mindful that it is easier for a
public goods–producing democrat than an autocrat to survive the first
months in office. Thus it is that in the immediate aftermath of a
leadership transition we see a few new leaders acting as if they care
about the people and many new leaders seizing the people’s wealth and
property. Such confiscations of property might well damage revenue in
the long run, but if a leader does not find money in the short term,
then the long run is someone else’s problem.</p>
<p>Democrats are generally fortunate enough to know where most of the
money is. When Boris Johnson became prime minister of Britain or Joe
Biden became president of the United States, neither needed to torture
their predecessor to find the money. Sure, the Trump administration
delayed providing transition assistance to the incoming Biden
administration until the very end. Still, despite every effort to hamper
the transition, the simple fact was that the accounts were public enough
that the Biden team could sort out where most of the money was and hit
the ground running. Because democracies have well-organized and
relatively transparent treasuries, their flow of funds is undisturbed by
leader turnover. There are two reasons for this transparency. First, as
we are about to explore, democratic leaders best promote their survival
through policies of open government. Second, a larger proportion of
revenue in democracies than in autocracies tends to be from the taxation
of people at work. Such taxes need to be levied in a clear and
transparent way, because just as surely as leaders need money, their
constituents want to avoid taxes.</p>
<p>TAXATION</p>
<p>We all hate taxes and are impressively inventive in looking for ways
to avoid them. Leaders, however, are rather fond of taxes—as long as
they don’t have to pay them. Being a dictator can be a terrific job, but
it also can be terribly stressful, especially if money is in short
supply. Taxes are one of the great antidotes to stress for heads of
governments. Taxes, after all, generate much-needed revenue, which can
then be used to reward supporters. As a general principle, leaders
always want to increase taxes. That gives them more resources with which
to reward their backers—and, not to be forgotten, themselves.
Nevertheless, they find it difficult to raise taxes with impunity.</p>
<p>Leaders face three constraints on how much money they can skim from
their subjects. First, taxes diminish how hard people work. Second, some
of the tax burden inevitably will fall on the essential backers of the
leader. (In general, the first constraint limits taxes in autocracies
and the second constraint sets the boundary on taxes in democracies.)
The third consideration is that tax collection requires both expertise
and resources. The costs associated with collecting taxes limit what
leaders can extract and shape the choice of taxation methods.</p>
<p>The first and most common complaint about taxes is that they
discourage hard work, enterprise, and investment. This is true. People
are unlikely to work as hard to put money in government coffers as they
do to put money in their own pocket. Economists often like to express
taxation and economic activity in terms of pies: when taxes are low,
they say, the people work hard to enlarge the pie, but the government
only gets a thin slice of the pie. As the government increases taxes,
its share of the pie increases but people begin to do less work, so the
overall size of the pie shrinks. If the government sets tax rates
extremely low or extremely high, its take will approach zero. In the
first case it gets very little of a large pie; in the latter case there
is hardly any pie because hardly anyone works. Somewhere between these
extremes there is an ideal tax rate that produces the most revenue the
state can get from taxation. What that ideal rate is depends on the
precise size of the winning coalition. That, in fact, is one of many
reasons that it is more helpful to talk about organizations in terms of
how many essentials they depend on than in terms of imprecise notions
such as autocracy or democracy. The general rule is that the larger the
group of essentials, the lower the tax rate. Having said that, we return
to the less precise vocabulary of autocracy and democracy, always
mindful that we really mean smaller or bigger coalitions.</p>
<p>Autocrats aim for the rate that maximizes revenue. They want as much
money as possible for themselves and their cronies. In contrast, good
governance dictates that taxes should only be taken to pay for things
that the market is poor at providing, such as national defense, a social
safety net, and large infrastructure projects. Taking relatively little
in taxes therefore encourages people to lead more productive lives,
creating a bigger pie. Democrats are closer to this good governance
ideal than autocrats, but they too overtax. The centerpiece of
Reaganomics, the economic plan of US president Ronald Reagan
(1981–1989), was that US taxes were mistakenly set higher than this
revenue-maximizing level. If taxes were reduced, he argued, people would
do so much extra work that government revenue would actually go up; that
is, a smaller share of a bigger pie would be larger than the bigger
share of a smaller pie. Such a win-win policy proved popular. Of course,
it did not quite work out that way.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, Reagan was right: lower taxes encouraged people
to work and so the pie grew, and it did so again during Donald Trump’s
term following his big tax cut for top earners (before the COVID-19
pandemic). However, crucially, in democracies it is the coalition’s
willingness to bear taxes that is the true constraint on the tax level.
Since taxes had not been so high as to squash entrepreneurial zeal in
the first place, there wasn’t much appreciable change as a result of
Reagan’s or Trump’s tax cuts. The pie grew, but not by so much that
revenues could keep up with increased spending. The net effect of the
tax cuts was, therefore, higher debt rather than a pie growing fast
enough to outpace government spending.</p>
<p>Politicians who raise or even maintain current taxes are politically
vulnerable, but then so too are politicians who fail to deliver the
policies their coalition wants. Herein lies the rub. It may well be that
cutting taxes, while increasing the size of the economic pie, fails to
make the pie big enough to generate both more wealth and more effective
government policies. The question is and always must be the degree to
which the private sector’s efficient but unequal distribution of wealth
trumps government’s more equitable, less efficient, but popular economic
programs.</p>
<p>Ruling is about staying in power, not good governance. To this end,
leaders buy support by rewarding their essential backers relative to
others. Taxation plays a dual role in generating this kind of loyalty.
First, it provides leaders with the resources to enrich their most
essential supporters. Second, it reduces the welfare of those outside of
the coalition. Taxation, especially in small-coalition settings,
redistributes from those outside the coalition (the poor) to those
inside the coalition (the rich). Small-coalition systems amply
demonstrate this principle, for these are places where rich people are
rich precisely because they are in the winning coalition and others are
poor because they are not. Phillip Chiyangwa, a protégé of the late
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe (possibly even his nephew), stated it bluntly:
“I am rich because I belong to Zanu-PF [Mugabe’s ruling party].”2 When
the coalition changes, so does who is rich and who is poor. Today, poor
Mr. Chiyangwa has been ousted from numerous lucrative positions,
including being banned for life from ZIFA, Zimbabwe’s football (soccer)
association, which he formerly headed and from which he allegedly
embezzled million.3</p>
<p>Nor is Zimbabwe an isolated case. Robert Bates, a professor of
government at Harvard University, described the link between wealth and
political backing in Kenya:</p>
<p>I recall working in western Kenya shortly after Daniel Arap Moi
succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as president of Kenya. With the shift in power,
the political fortunes of elite politicians had changed. As I drove
through the highlands, I encountered boldly lettered signs posted on the
gateways of farms announcing the auction of cattle, farm machinery, and
buildings and lands. Once they were no longer in favor, politicians
found their loans cancelled or called in, their subsidies withdrawn, or
their lines of business, which had once been sheltered by the state,
exposed to competition. Some whom I had once seen in the hotels of
Nairobi, looking sleek and satisfied, I now encountered in rural bars,
looking lean and apprehensive, as they contemplated the magnitude of
their reversal.4</p>
<p>Needless to say, people want to be sleek and satisfied and not lean
and apprehensive. That is why they remain loyal. A heavy tax burden
emphasizes the difference between being rich and being poor—in or out of
the coalition. At the same time, the resulting revenues fund spoils for
the lucky few, leaving little for everyone else. Further, the misery
such heavy taxes inflict on the general population makes participation
in the coalition even more valuable. Fearing exclusion and poverty under
an alternative leadership, supporters are all the more fiercely loyal.
They will do anything to keep what they have and keep on collecting
goodies. Gerard Padró i Miquel of Yale University has shown that the
leaders of numerous African nations tax too highly (that is, beyond the
maximum revenue point) and then turn around and provide subsidies to
chosen groups. This may be economic madness, but it is also political
genius.5</p>
<p>Democratic governments may tax heavily, too, and for the same reason
as autocrats: they provide subsidies to groups that favor them at the
polls at the expense of those who oppose them. We will see, for
instance, that Democrats and Republicans in the United States each use
taxation when they can to redistribute wealth from their opponents to
their supporters. So democratic governments also have an appetite for
taxation, but they cannot indulge that appetite to the extent autocrats
can. Since his essential backers are few, an autocrat can easily
compensate them for the tax burden that falls on them. This option is
not available to a democrat because his number of supporters is so
large. Tax rates are therefore limited by the need to make coalition
members better off than they can expect to be under alternative
leadership. Donald Trump’s tax legislation, for instance, greatly
reduced the deductibility of state and local government taxes. Since
states controlled by Democrats generally have higher state and local
taxes than Republican states, Trump reduced Republican taxes
disproportionately at the expense of his Democratic opponents. No wonder
so many Republicans loved him and so many Democrats reviled him, but
then they weren’t going to vote for Trump anyway. He had no need to make
those who vote for the Democrats happy. Of course, all leaders want to
generate revenue with which to reward supporters, but democratic
incumbents are constrained to keep taxes relatively low. A democrat may
tax above the good governance minimum, but he does not raise taxes to
the autocrat’s revenue maximization point.</p>
<p>The relationship between regime type and taxation can be seen in the
recent history of Mexico. Mexico began a transition toward democracy
following a massive earthquake in 1985 (as discussed in chapter 8). Its
first free election came in 1994, and the incumbent party, the Partido
Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), lost nationally for the first time
in 2000. As can be seen in Figure 4.1, the onset of democratization
marks the start of the decline in government revenue as a percentage of
gross domestic product (GDP). As the size of the winning coalition
enlarged, Mexico’s tax rates followed suit by declining, just as they
should when politicians need to curry favor with many instead of a few.
For instance, the highest marginal tax rate in Mexico in 1979, with the
PRI firmly in control, was 55 percent. As the PRI’s one-party rule
declined, so did tax rates. By 2000, marking the first truly free,
competitive presidential election, Mexico’s highest tax rate was 40
percent.6 Today it is only 35 percent.</p>
<p>Members of any autocrat’s small coalition also dislike paying taxes,
but they readily endorse high taxes when those taxes are used to funnel
great wealth back to them. This was just the case in Bell, California.
City manager Robert Rizzo raised property taxes. The city council could
have stopped such increases, but had they done so, the city could not
have afforded their bloated consultancy fees. Suppose for simplicity
that Rizzo’s coalition was composed of 1 percent of Bell’s thirty-six
thousand residents. For every dollar increase in tax per person, Rizzo
would have been able to transfer up to 00 of services and payments to
each coalition member. Had his coalition been composed of half of Bell’s
residents, each dollar increase in tax per person would provide only to
transfer to each coalition member. It is easy to see why the coalition
would sooner endorse higher taxes in the former setup than in the
latter.</p>
<p>Figure 4.1: Mexico’s Tax Take and Democratization</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to most of us who live in democracies, the idea that
our taxes are lower than in other systems might sound frankly absurd. If
you live in New York City, as we do, you pay federal, state, and local
taxes (as well as Social Security, Medicare, and sales tax). If you earn
a reasonably good income, then income taxes suck up about 40 percent of
your earnings. By the time you factor in sales, property, and other
taxes, a reasonably wealthy New Yorker will have paid more than half her
marginal income in tax—hardly a low figure. European democracies, with
their extensive social safety nets and universal health care, can tax at
even higher rates. In contrast, some autocracies don’t even have income
taxes. But the comparison of average tax rates is misleading.</p>
<p>At the income levels taxed in much of the world’s poor autocracies,
the tax rate in Europe and the United States is zero. We have to compare
taxes at given income levels, not across the board, since most income
tax systems are designed to be progressive, taxing higher incomes at
higher rates than lower incomes. By looking at how much tax has to be
paid at a given income level across countries we get close to comparing
apples to apples and oranges to oranges.</p>
<p>In the United States, for example, a couple with one child and an
income under about 2,400 pays no income tax. If their income were, say,
0,000 they would receive ,000 from the federal government to help
support their child. In China, a family with an income of 2,400 is
expected to pay about ,725 in income tax.7</p>
<p>Of course you might think it problematic to compare tax rates at US
incomes, since these are far higher than incomes in much of the world.
Instead, let’s compare China, Russia, and India. These nations differ
substantially in terms of governance institutions and wealth, although
all are poor compared to the US. India is the most democratic of these
nations, but it is also the poorest. China has the smallest winning
coalition and ranks in the middle in terms of average income, about
,000. Russia is the wealthiest of these nations and has an intermediate
coalition size. Each nation’s taxation structure differs. Russia has a
flat 13 percent tax rate; all income is taxed at the same rate: bad for
the poor, but probably great news for Putin’s rich oligarch backers.
India and China both have progressive tax schemes; tax rates rise with
incomes. However, there are important differences. China has a higher
maximum tax rate than India (45 percent vs 30 percent) and higher tax
thresholds kick in at lower income levels compared to India. What are
the net results for people in each nation?</p>
<p>On an average Indian income, a family would pay no income tax in
India, an average tax of about 13 percent in China, and an average tax
of exactly 13 percent in Russia. As incomes increase, the average tax
rate increases in both India and China, but much more slowly in India.
At the income level of an average Russian family (the wealthiest of the
three nations), the tax rate would still be 13 percent in Russia. In
China, the system with the smallest coalition, the tax rate would
average about 25 percent, while in India the average tax would equate to
about 9 percent. The pattern is clear. If you don’t like paying
taxes—and who does—then you want to live in a democratic nation. The
sticker price of living in New York seems huge, but it would become
astronomical if the government were not reliant on the support of so
many people.</p>
<p>Many small-coalition systems appear to have low nominal rates of
taxation. But those looking to keep the rewards of their labor should
beware. Autocracies have high implicit taxes—if you have something
valuable then it simply gets taken.8 North Korea has no formal income
tax system. Yet when Kim Jong-Un sends many thousands of North Koreans
to work overseas, often in Russia or China, he taxes their earnings at
67 percent.9 It’s worth remembering that when the wealthiest man in
China, Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba), spoke out in the fall of 2020
against the government’s efforts to stifle innovation, “the government
suspended the debut of the Ant Group, a spinoff of Alibaba… a move that
cost the company 7 billion.”10</p>
<p>The former richest man in Russia (disregarding allegations about
Putin’s wealth), Mikhail Khodorkovsky, spent years in prison. Back in
2004, Khodorkovsky, then the sixteenth-wealthiest man in the world, had
made his money building up Yukos, an oil company founded during the
privatization wave in Russia in 1993. Yukos was the largest nonstate oil
company in the world and accounted for about 20 percent of Russian oil
production. Khodorkovsky, who had initially been close to the
government, spoke out against Putin’s autocratic rule of Russia and
funded several opposition political parties. In 2003, he was arrested on
fraud charges, and he was subsequently convicted. The Russian government
also accused Yukos of tax evasion. According to a Yukos spokesperson,
the tax take claimed by Russia from Yukos was substantially higher than
that levied on other oil companies and, in some years, exceeded gross
revenue. These enormous tax burdens forced Yukos into bankruptcy. At the
end of his first eight-year sentence, Khodorkovsky, apparently still
seen as a liability by the Russian government, was given a second
sentence for embezzlement and money laundering. Wisely, he left Russia
in 2015 and now lives in exile in London. One can only wonder whether
Jack Ma, his Chinese counterpart, is looking at a similar future or
whether he has been taught by his government that it is prudent to keep
his mouth shut.</p>
<p>In autocracies, it is unwise to be rich unless it is the government
that made you rich. And if this is the case, it is important to be loyal
above all else. Of course, it is possible that Khodorkovsky and the many
Chinese entrepreneurs and former leaders who have been convicted of
corruption were, in fact, guilty. That is the nature of business in
their countries. Even so, many others were surely guilty of the same
crimes and yet walk free today. What singled out Khodorkovsky and others
was that they did not support the government and they had enormous
wealth. White farmers in Zimbabwe suffered a similar fate. Robert
Mugabe’s government seized their land. The cover for these seizures was
land redistribution to poor Blacks who were dispossessed under colonial
and white minority rule. The reality was much different. The
redistributed land invariably ended up in the hands of government
cronies, none of whom were farmers. When the new owners invariably
allowed the land to fall into disuse, the farmers lost their
investments, farmworkers were evicted from their houses, and Zimbabwe,
once a huge agricultural exporter, became hungrier. But on the other
side of the ledger, Robert Mugabe survived in power into his
nineties.</p>
<p>Democrats are less inclined to rewrite the rules and seize wealth.
Tempting though extra revenue is, it comes at the cost of lost
productivity to the masses. In Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, the
heroine, Portia, disguises herself as a judge and adjudicates the case
between Antonio, who pledged his person as security on a loan, and
Shylock, who demands his pound of Antonio’s flesh when Antonio does not
pay on time.11 Bassanio, Antonio’s friend (and Portia’s husband), offers
to pay many times the debt due, and when Shylock refuses, he appeals to
the mercy of the court:</p>
<p>And I beseech you,</p>
<p>Wrest once the law to your authority:</p>
<p>To do a great right, do a little wrong.</p>
<p>But Portia recognizes the sanctity of the law:</p>
<p>It must not be: there is no power in Venice</p>
<p>Can alter a decree established:</p>
<p>’Twill be recorded for a precedent;</p>
<p>And many an error, by the same example,</p>
<p>Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</p>
<p>The many messages of The Merchant of Venice are complicated and
controversial, but one message, epitomized by the passage just quoted
(but not the reversal in the enforcement of contracts just a bit later
in the play), reminds us that rule of law is essential to successful
commerce. As one examination of the demands of commerce in The Merchant
of Venice makes clear, both for Venice and in general, “Contract does
not require friendship, but it does require a degree of trust that the
market is well-regulated or that the institutions of contract
enforcement are appropriately strong.”12</p>
<p>TAX COLLECTORS</p>
<p>Democrats need resources so they can reward their coalition, but they
can’t take too much or they risk alienating those very same supporters.
Similar concerns shape how taxes are collected. Leaders want to collect
taxes in a fair or at least transparent way. Few US citizens would
regard the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a transparent tax
authority, but it is at least governed by rules (albeit an awful lot of
them) that are overseen by an independent judiciary. As for all the
rules and exceptions that make the US tax code so complicated, these
inevitably result from politicians doing what politicians inevitably do:
reward their supporters at the expense of everybody else. This is why
sheaves of pages in the tax code are dedicated to farmers—a crucial
coalition for some politicians and a group that needs to receive their
rewards if their senators and representatives are to remain in
power.</p>
<p>As poor Mikhail Khodorkovsky learned, when the opportunity arises
autocrats will grab whatever they can. Yet even as they work without
being bound by people’s feelings, autocrats face real issues in the
realm of collecting taxes. High taxes will inevitably drive people to
hide their work and profits. This makes monitoring their income
difficult. Furthermore, the large bureaucracy required to run a
comprehensive tax system, such as the one in the United States, can be
prohibitively expensive. To put this in context, the IRS spends about 8
per person, or about 0.5 percent of the IRS take, to collect an average
of ,614 in tax per person.13 This is fine in a nation with a per capita
GDP of 4,000, but in nations where the average income is only ,000 per
year, such a cost of collecting taxes would be about 23 percent of the
revenue. Further, setting up a large bureaucracy makes an autocrat
beholden to those who run it. The first rule of officeholding is to
minimize the number of people whose support you need. To avoid becoming
a slave of their own tax collectors, autocrats often use indirect
taxation instead. With indirect taxes, the cost of the tax is passed on
to someone other than the person actually paying it. For instance,
sellers pay sales tax to municipal governments but pass the cost on to
buyers, making sales taxes indirect.</p>
<p>Agricultural marketing boards are a common indirect means of taxing
poor farmers in autocracies. In principle such organizations are
designed to fulfill a similar function as the European Union’s Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP guarantees farmers minimum prices for
their goods—thus it provides a benefit to the farmers. In many
democracies, including the United States, rural areas are
overrepresented electorally. Given the desire to rule with as few
supporters as possible, it should be of little surprise that democrats
often include farm groups in their coalition and reward them
accordingly.14</p>
<p>In contrast, farmers are rarely key supporters in autocracies. Farm
marketing boards are set up to exploit rather than help them. Consider
Ghana’s Cocoa Marketing Board (CMB), reconstituted as CocoBod in 1979.
Cocoa is Ghana’s major agricultural export. The CMB/CocoBod fixes a
price for cocoa—an implicit tax—and insists that farmers sell all their
cocoa to the board at that price, an indirect tax. The board then
historically resold the cocoa on world markets at a higher price and
pocketed the difference: “The first rung in the long ladder of leeches
that feed on the sweat of the cocoa farmers was the Cocoa Marketing
Board.”15 These excessive profits were a major source of government
revenue in Ghana. But after Ghana became a democracy in the early 1990s,
following the collapse of its economy, CocoBod turned itself around.
Today, “farmers receive a relatively large share of export earnings.
Product quality is world renowned, and it regularly exceeds the most
stringent international standards. Exports are handled professionally
and efficiently. International loans are repaid reliably. Internal
marketing is relatively uncorrupt and effective.”16 The change in
Ghana’s governmental exploitation of cocoa farmers illustrates both the
pitfalls of small coalitions and the enormous benefits—for the people if
not the politicians—of political reform.</p>
<p>Taxing the poor to pay the rich has plenty of bad economic
consequences, but these tend to be “in the long run”—that is, on another
leader’s watch. For instance, when Ghana heavily taxed its farmers, the
longer-term consequence was reduced production. Ghanaian farmers simply
stopped planting and caring for cocoa trees. By the 1980s cocoa
production had collapsed, and farmers tried to smuggle what little they
did grow to neighboring Côte d’Ivoire. Case after case proves the point:
when taxes are too high, people either stop working or find ways to
avoid the formal economy. And when governments become more accountable,
as Ghana did, taxes drop and farmers are incentivized again to grow
crops.</p>
<p>PRIVATIZED TAX COLLECTION</p>
<p>When even indirect taxation proves to be too much trouble, autocrats
sometimes turn to outsiders for help extracting funds from their people.
For autocrats and for their tax collectors this has a virtue and a
liability. People hired to extract money for the government, keeping a
portion of what they collect for themselves, have a strong incentive to
take in lots of tax revenue. That’s good for them and good for the
leader who receives the substantial remainder not kept by prudent tax
collectors. But people hired to extract money can also use the power of
that money to become a threat to a leader, and that, of course, is
dangerous for them and for the incumbent.</p>
<p>The Caliphate was the Muslim empire created by military conquest
following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632. It ruled much of the
Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe until 1258. In the
tradition of the Romans before them, the caliphs avoided the technical
difficulties of tax collection by outsourcing the task altogether. A tax
farmer would pay the treasury for the right to collect taxes from a
particular territory. Obviously, once they had paid for the privilege,
tax farmers extracted everything they could. They were notoriously
brutal and always looking for ingenious ways to take more. For instance,
they would demand payment in silver coins rather than crops and then
collude with merchants to fix prices. Those who could not pay were
punished or even killed.</p>
<p>Naturally, the people resisted. Tax farmers contended with a
persistent problem of people fleeing the land rather than paying their
property taxes. To prevent this, tax farmers set up patrols to check
identities. Non-Muslims were often tattooed or forced to wear “dog tags”
with their name and address to prevent them from fleeing.17 Initially
some of the taxes collected by the tax farmers were only applicable to
non-Muslims. This proved to be a very successful, if not wholly
intended, means of encouraging religious conversion. It seems that many
non-Muslims, realizing that they could reduce the tax collectors’ reach
by becoming Muslim, put their religious beliefs aside and converted. As
long as these conversions did not assume massive proportions, the tax
farmers made themselves incredibly rich at the expense of the average
citizen. When conversion became commonplace, tax farmers adjusted, no
longer excluding Muslims from some of the taxes they levied. And from
the perspective of the caliph, they ensured reliable revenue. That they
terrorized the people was of no political importance: impoverished and
persecuted farmers were not part of the winning coalition.</p>
<p>Autocrats can avoid the technical difficulties of gathering and
redistributing wealth by authorizing their supporters to reward
themselves directly. For many leaders, corruption is not something bad
that needs to be eliminated. Rather, it is an essential political tool.
Leaders implicitly or sometimes even explicitly condone corruption.
Effectively they license the right to extract bribes from the citizens.
This avoids the administrative headache of organizing taxation and
transferring the funds to supporters. Saddam Hussein’s sons were
notorious for smuggling during the 1990s when Iraq was subject to
sanctions. They made a fortune from the sanctions that were supposed to
harm the regime.</p>
<p>EXTRACTION</p>
<p>“Oil is the Devil’s excrement,” at least according to Juan Pablo
Pérez Alfonzo, a Venezuelan who founded the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the cartel of oil-producing nations. “Ten
years from now, twenty years from now, you will see: oil will bring us
ruin.”18 And he was right.</p>
<p>As many leaders have learned, the problem with raising revenue
through taxation is that it requires people to work. Tax too
aggressively or fail to provide an environment conducive to economic
activity, and people simply don’t produce. Actually extracting revenue
from the land itself provides a convenient alternative, cutting the
people out of the equation altogether.</p>
<p>Take oil, for example. It flows out of the ground whether it is taxed
at 0 percent or 100 percent. Labor represents but a small part of the
value of oil extraction. This makes it a leader’s dream and a people’s
nightmare. In a phenomenon often called the resource curse, nations with
readily extractable natural resources systematically underperform
nations without such resources.19 Resource-rich nations have worse
economic growth, are more prone to civil wars, and become more
autocratic than their resource-poor counterparts.</p>
<p>Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, achieved independence
from Britain in 1960. At the time of independence it was a poor nation,
but expectations were high. These expectations grew with the discovery
of oil. Nigeria is believed to have the world’s tenth-largest reserves.
With the rise in oil prices during the oil crises in the early and late
1970s, Nigeria found itself awash with funds. And yet by the early 1980s
the country was swamped by debt and poverty. From 1970 to 2019, Nigeria
accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenue.20 That money
has not helped the Nigerian people much. Over the same years, average
annual income per capita went from ,691 in 1970 (in constant US 2010
dollars) to US,376 in 2000 and up to US,374 in 2019, making Nigeria
still one of the poorest nations in the world, in spite of its vast oil
wealth. Poverty has risen too. Earning less than one dollar per day is a
common standard used for assessing poverty. In 1970, 36 percent of
Nigerians lived on less; by 2000 this figure had jumped to nearly 70
percent. In 2020, with the dollar’s value inflated, things were still
worse than in 1970, with 40 percent of Nigerians living on less than one
dollar per day.</p>
<p>Nigeria is not exceptional, as Figure 4.2 shows. The horizontal axis
shows natural resource exports as a percentage of GDP in 1970. The
vertical axis shows the average level of economic growth between 1970
and 1990. The trend is clear. Nations flush with oil, copper, gold,
diamond, or other minerals grow more slowly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, natural resources are wonderful for leaders. Natural
resources don’t require freedoms to be productive, and so they allow a
leader to pay her coalition without the risk of empowering the people. A
leader who can afford to keep the people isolated, uneducated, and
ignorant and chooses not to do so is a fool. Just such foolishness led
to Muammar al-Qaddafi’s demise. Given the derision he is usually subject
to, it will probably surprise most people that his undoing was that he
was too enlightened rather than too despotic. While we would never claim
that the Libyan press was free, it had more freedom to publish what it
wanted than Libya’s neighbors, which were not so blessed with oil.
Qaddafi also allowed Libyans to gain more education than he needed to.
And the reward for his unnecessary benevolence was that the people rose
up against him. When NATO intervened to prevent him from using heavy
weapons to suppress the rebels, he lost power. A clear case of “no good
deed goes unpunished.”</p>
<p>Figure 4.2: Growth and Natural Resource Abundance, 1970–1990</p>
<p>Leaders in Qaddafi’s position don’t need their subjects to work.
Admittedly the minerals need to be extracted, but by and large autocrats
can achieve this without the participation of the local population. In
Nigeria, for instance, the oil is concentrated in the Niger Delta
region. Foreign firms with foreign workers do most of the extraction.
Few Nigerians participate. The oil companies run security firms,
effectively small private armies, to keep the locals from obstructing
the business or complaining about the environmental degradation that
results. BP and other foreign firms are free to act with impunity,
provided they deliver royalty checks to the government. This is not so
much a failing of these companies as the way business must be conducted
in countries whose leaders rely on a few cronies to back them up. A
company that acted responsibly would necessarily have less money to
deliver to the government, and that would be enough for them to be
replaced by another company that is willing to be more
“cooperative.”</p>
<p>One interesting manifestation of the differences between wealth and
poverty in resource-rich lands is the cost of living for expatriates
there. While it is tempting to think that cities like Oslo, Tokyo, or
London would top the list of the most expensive places, and they are,
indeed, expensive cities, for many years—until quite recently, in
fact—Luanda, the capital of the southwestern African state of Angola,
was the most expensive city. It used to cost upwards of 0,000 per month
for housing in a reasonable neighborhood, and even then, water and
electricity were intermittent. What made this so shocking was the
surrounding poverty. According to the United Nations Development
Program, back in 2000, 68 percent of Angola’s population lived below the
poverty line, more than a quarter of Angolan children died before their
fifth birthday, and male life expectancy in Angola was below forty-five
years. Angola ranked 143 out of 182 nations in terms of overall human
development. Prices in Angola, as in many other West African states,
were fueled by oil and by corruption.</p>
<p>Today, in 2021, with oil prices deflated by the global pandemic,
Luanda ranks as only the 123rd most expensive city for foreign workers
to live in. But it held the top spot as recently as 2017, and as much as
it has remained expensive for foreigners, it has remained miserable for
its citizens. While Angola’s Human Development Index has risen slightly
since 2000, as of 2020 it still ranked only 148th out of 189 nations.21
Unfortunately, little is likely to change. The size of Angola’s winning
coalition has improved little over the last three decades, although it
did expand substantially in 1992. Although Angola elected a new
president, João Lourenço, in 2017, he was the handpicked successor of
José Eduardo dos Santos. Dos Santos had ruled since 1979, amassed a huge
personal fortune, and appears to have stepped down only due to ill
health.</p>
<p>The story of Angola reminds us that the resource curse enables
autocrats to massively reward their supporters and accumulate enormous
wealth. This drives prices to the stratospheric heights as seen in
Luanda, where wealthy expatriates and lucky coalition members could have
foie gras flown in from France every day. Yet to make sure the people
cannot coordinate, rebel, and take control of the state, leaders
endeavor to keep those outside the coalition poor, ignorant, and
unorganized. It is ironic that while oil revenues provide the resources
to fix societal problems, they create political incentives to make them
far worse.</p>
<p>The effect of natural resource wealth is much less pernicious in
democracies. Angola, still far from being a smoothly functioning
democracy, nevertheless shows us how expanding the winning coalition can
change things for the better. But Angola’s transformation is unusual.
The trouble is that once a state profits from mineral wealth, it is
unlikely to democratize. The easiest way to incentivize the leader to
liberalize policy is to force him to rely on tax revenue to generate
funds. Once this happens, the incumbent can no longer suppress the
population because the people won’t work if he does.</p>
<p>The upshot is that the resource curse can be lifted. If aid
organizations want to help the peoples of oil-rich nations, then the
logic of our survival-based argument suggests they would achieve more by
lobbying governments in the developed world to increase the tax on
petroleum than by providing assistance overseas. By raising the price of
oil and gas, such taxes would reduce worldwide demand for oil. This in
turn would reduce oil revenues and make leaders of oil-rich countries
more reliant on taxation.</p>
<p>Effective taxation requires that the people are motivated to work,
but people cannot produce as effectively if they are forbidden such
freedoms as freedom to assemble with their fellow workers and freedom of
speech. These freedoms facilitate formal and informal discussions and
debates over how to make the workplace perform more effectively and how
to make government regulations less of a burden on the workers.</p>
<p>BORROWING</p>
<p>Borrowing is a wonderful thing for leaders. They get to spend the
money to make their supporters happy today and, if they are sensible,
set some aside for themselves. Unless they are fortunate enough to
survive in office for a really long time, repaying today’s loan will be
another leader’s problem. Autocratic leaders borrow as much as they can,
and democratic leaders are enthusiastic borrowers as well.</p>
<p>We are all at least a little bit impatient. It’s in our nature to buy
things today when better financial acumen might suggest saving our
money. Politics makes financial decision-making even more suspect. To
understand the logic and see why politicians are profligate borrowers,
suppose everyone in a country earns 00 per year and is expected to do so
in the future too. The more we spend today, the more we must pay in
interest and debt repayment tomorrow. Suppose, for instance, that to
spend an extra 00 today we have to give up 0 per year as interest
payments in the future. It is reasonable to see that people could differ
on whether this is a good idea or not, but politics certainly makes it
more attractive. To simplify the issue vastly, suppose leaders simply
divide the money they borrow among the members of their coalition. This
encourages leaders to borrow more. If a leader has a coalition of half
the people and he borrows an amount equivalent to 00 per person, then
everyone has to give up 0 in each future year (as taxes to pay the
interest). However, since the coalition is only half the population,
each coalition member’s immediate benefit from the borrowing is 00.
While to some this might still not seem like an attractive deal, it is
certainly better than incurring the same debt obligation for 00.
Governments of all flavors are more profligate spenders and borrowers
than the citizens they rule. And that profligacy is greatly multiplied
when we look at small-coalition regimes.</p>
<p>As the size of the coalition shrinks, the benefits that the coalition
gains from indebtedness go up. If, for instance, the coalition includes
one person per hundred, then, in exchange for the debt obligation, each
coalition member receives 0,000 today instead of the mere 00 in the 50
percent coalition example. This is surely a deal that most of us would
jump at. As the coalition size becomes smaller, the incentive to borrow
increases.</p>
<p>Of course, borrowing more today means more indebtedness and reduced
ability to borrow tomorrow. But such arguments are rarely persuasive to
a leader. If he takes a financially reasonable position by refusing to
incur debt, then he has less to spend on rewards. No such problem will
arise for a challenger who offers to take on such debt in exchange for
support from members of the current incumbent’s coalition. This makes
the current leader vulnerable. Incurring debt today is attractive
because, after all, the debt will be inherited by the next
administration. That way, it also ties the hands of any future
challenger.</p>
<p>A leader should borrow as much as the coalition will endorse and
markets will provide. There is surely a challenger out there who will
borrow this much and, in doing so, use the money to grab power away from
the incumbent. So not borrowing jeopardizes a leader’s hold on power.
Heavy borrowing is a feature of small-coalition settings. It is not the
result, as some economists argue, of ignorance of basic economics by
third-world leaders.</p>
<p>In an autocracy, the small size of the coalition means that leaders
are virtually always willing to take on more debt. The only effective
limit on how much autocrats borrow is how much people are willing to
lend them. Earlier we saw the paradoxical result that as Nigeria’s oil
revenues grew so did its debt. It wasn’t that the oil itself encouraged
borrowing—autocrats always want to borrow more. Rather, revenues from
oil meant that Nigeria could service a larger debt and so people were
more willing to lend.</p>
<p>Although the large coalition size in a democracy places some
restrictions on the level of borrowing, democratic leaders are still
inclined to be financially irresponsible. Remember, while the debt is
paid by all, the benefits disproportionately flow to coalition members.
Over the last ten years the economies of many Western nations boomed.
This would have been a perfect time to reduce debt. Yet in many cases
this did not happen. In 1990, US debt was .41 trillion, which was
equivalent to 42 percent of GDP. By 2000 this debt had grown in nominal
terms to .41 trillion, although in relative terms this was a decline to
35.1 percent of GDP. However, as the economy prospered during the 2000s
(other than during the several years of global recession), debt
continued to slowly accumulate instead of shrink. By the end of 2020, US
debt stood at 7 trillion, 82 percent of the pandemic-affected GDP. To
compare apples to apples, the 2019—pre-pandemic—debt, during a time of
economic expansion, was a whopping 6.8 trillion, equal to 79 percent of
GDP. A bigger economy means a greater ability to service debt and a
capacity to borrow more.</p>
<p>We may be inclined to explain the expansion of the debt by citing the
party politics of the leader in charge. However, ideology offers a poor
account of these trends. The major accumulations of US debt in the
postwar period began under Republican administrations: Ronald Reagan
(1981–1989), George W. Bush (2001–2009), and Donald Trump (2017–2021).
This debt grew at a staggering pace during the 2007–2009 recession as
the United States underwrote troubled banks and embarked on Keynesian
policies of fiscal stimulus. It grew at an even more staggering pace
during the Trump years, including the pre-pandemic period. British debt
follows a similar pattern. In 2002 debt stood at 34 percent of GDP, by
2007 it was 41.5 percent, and it exploded in the wake of the 2008
financial crisis and continued to grow through good economic times,
reaching 85.4 percent of GDP by the end of 2019.</p>
<p>From a Keynesian perspective, many governments were taking the
perverse steps of trying to cut spending during the Great Recession of
2007–2009 instead of stimulating demand. This did not reflect a desire
by politicians to borrow less. Rather, debt crises in Iceland, Greece,
and Ireland led many investors to doubt the ability of nations to repay
their loans. This pushed up the cost of borrowing and made it much
harder to secure new loans. It was supply, not demand, that had
shrunk.</p>
<p>Markets limit how much a nation can borrow. If individuals borrow too
much and either cannot or will not repay it, then banks and other
creditors can seize assets to recover the debt. With sovereign lending
to countries, however, creditors cannot repossess property. On a few
occasions creditors have tried. For instance, France invaded Mexico in
1862 in an attempt to get Mexico to repay loans. France also invaded the
Ruhr, an industrial area of Germany, in 1923 to collect reparation
payments from World War I that Germany had not paid. Both attempts
failed. In practice, the only leverage lenders have over nations is to
cut them off from future credit. Nevertheless, this has a profound
effect, as the ability to engage in borrowing in financial markets is
valuable. For this reason nations generally pay their debts.</p>
<p>However, once the value of access to credit is worth less than the
cost of servicing the debt, then leaders should default. If they don’t,
surely a challenger will come along who will offer to do so. This was
one of the appeals of Adolf Hitler to the German people in the 1930s.
Germany faced a huge debt, in part to pay reparations from World War I.
Hitler defaulted on this debt. It was a popular policy with the German
people because the cost of servicing the debt was so high.</p>
<p>As debt approaches the balance point where the value of access to
credit equals the cost of debt service, lenders refuse to increase the
overall size of debt. At this point, if leaders want to borrow more,
then they need to increase revenues such that they could service this
additional debt. As in the Nigerian case, the discovery of exploitable
natural resources provides one means to increase debt service and hence
borrowing. However, without such discoveries, the only way to increase
borrowing is to increase tax revenue. For autocratic leaders this means
liberalizing their policies to encourage people to work harder, because
they already tax at a high (implicit) rate. Only when facing financial
problems are leaders willing to even consider undertaking such
politically risky liberalization. They don’t do it frequently or
happily. They liberalize, opening the door to a more democratic,
representative, and accountable government only when they have no other
path to save themselves from being deposed today.</p>
<p>DEBT FORGIVENESS</p>
<p>Debt forgiveness is a popular policy but one that is generally
misguided. Those in favor of forgiving the debt of highly indebted poor
countries argue that the debt burden falls on the poor people of the
nation who did not benefit in a consequential way from the borrowed
funds. This is certainly true. As we have explained, the benefits go to
the leader and the coalition while the debt obligation falls on
everyone. But people who argue for debt forgiveness construct their
arguments in terms of how they think the world should operate rather
than how it actually works.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, as many poor nations struggled to repay debts,
creditors coordinated to reschedule and forgive debt. The French
Ministry of the Economy, Finance, and Industry became an important
center for negotiations, helping ensure that creditors shared similar
losses. The group of creditors that met to help poor debtor countries
became known as the Paris Club. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative. Instead of the previous case-by-case approach, this program
provided systematic help to poor nations with writing down their debts.
However, nations could only receive debt relief when they met or made
substantial progress toward meeting explicit criteria concerned with
poverty alleviation and budget reform. The program received a huge boost
under the UN’s Millennium Development Goals program. From 2006 onward
many HIPCs saw very large reductions in their debt. How well did these
countries do after receiving the benefits of massive debt relief?</p>
<p>The HIPC Initiative was the policy consequence of important research
into what is known as debt overhang, a term introduced by Paul Krugman
in 1988 and built on by Jeffrey Sachs in 1989.22 The core idea was, to
be a little technical and jargony, that a country’s total factor
productivity—basically how well its resources, like labor and capital,
are converted into output—is held down by too much debt. In actuality,
the HIPC program failed to produce the expected benefits. In a
comparison of poor countries that participated in the program and poor
countries that did not, the evidence shows that “the debt overhang
hypothesis would appear to be erroneous.”23 Bad governance rather than
misguided economic policy were and are almost certainly the source of
national impoverishment, indebtedness, and failure to grow. This is true
for those who were part of the HIPC experiment and those who were
not.</p>
<p>The record of debt forgiveness just is not a happy one. Consider that
as a percentage of debt, the largest debt reliefs prior to 2000 were
given to Ethiopia in 1999 (42 percent of debt), Yemen in 1997 (34
percent), Belarus in 1996 (33 percent), Angola in 1996 (33 percent),
Nicaragua in 1996 (30 percent), and Mozambique in 1990 (27 percent).24
With the exceptions of Angola and Nicaragua, each of these nations
promptly started reaccumulating debt. For instance, after a series of
small debt reductions, in 1999, with the forgiveness of .4 billion,
Ethiopia had its debt reduced to .7 billion. But by 2003 this debt had
risen to .9 billion. Despite the forgiveness of 89 million of debt in
1996, Belarus’s debt has steadily risen from .8 billion in 1995 to over
.1 billion in 2005 to a staggering 1.4 billion in 2019. Even though
debt-reduction programs vet candidates, these examples suggest that in
many cases forgiveness without institutional reform simply allows
leaders to start borrowing again.</p>
<p>Democrats also like to borrow, but they are not as profligate as
autocrats; they prefer lower levels of indebtedness. Democratization
promotes successful debt reduction, as the history of Mozambique
illustrates. In 1990, 27 percent of Mozambique’s debt was forgiven. The
result was the further accumulation of debt. By the time Mozambique
democratized in 1994, its debt was over billion. However, this debt has
gradually been reduced, as seen in Figure 4.3, aided in part by further
forgiveness.</p>
<p>Figure 4.3: Mozambique’s Debt and Forgiveness</p>
<p>The HIPC program received much misguided criticism for its slow pace
in reducing the debt of poor nations. Our criticism of the HIPC
Initiative is the opposite: it’s actually too eager to forgive debt.
Debt forgiveness simply allows autocratic leaders to start borrowing
more money. As we’ll see a little later, financial crises are one of the
important reasons that leaders are compelled to democratize. Debt
reduction, however, relieves financial pressure and enables autocrats to
stay in office without reform, continuing to make the lives of their
subjects miserable.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that autocrats love debt relief. But how does debt
relief look to those who would like to improve governance and who want
to start, as we do, from understanding how leaders behave rather than
engaging in wishful thinking? We depart for the moment from looking at
governance through a leader’s eyes and instead turn our attention to how
to change an autocrat’s vision. That is, we turn for the moment to
thinking about how we can use the logic of dictatorial rule to give
autocrats the right incentives to change their government for the
better. We wonder, Can we create a desire in at least some autocrats to
govern for the people as the best way to ensure their own political
survival?</p>
<p>Debt reduction might work in democracies. Since such nations want to
reduce excessive debt anyway, debt reduction clearly helps speed the
process. But as can be seen in Figure 4.3, Mozambique was already
tackling its debt problem prior to large-scale forgiveness in 2001 and
in 2006. Therefore, we advocate a conservative approach of little or no
debt relief as a way to improve the quality of governance and quality of
life for people currently living under wretched, oppressive regimes. We
know that debt relief allows autocrats to entrench themselves in office.
Debt forgiveness with the promise of subsequent democratization never
works. An autocrat might be sincere in his willingness to have
meaningful elections in return for funds. Yet once the financial crisis
is over and the leader can borrow to pay off the coalition, any promised
election will be a sham. For democrats, debt relief, while helpful, is
unnecessary. By eliminating debt relief for autocrats we can help
precipitate the sorts of rebellions seen in the Middle East in 2011,
rebellions that, if properly motivated and timed, as discussed later,
may very well open the door to better governments in the future.</p>

<p>Taxation, resource extraction, and borrowing are the foremost ways of
acquiring funds for enriching a coalition. Discussions that portray
taxation differently are either window dressing to make the process seem
more palatable or are making arguments based on how people would like
the world to work. Leaders tax because they need to spend on their
coalition. Successful leaders raise as much revenue as they can. The
limits of taxation are (1) the willingness of people to work as they are
taxed; (2) what tax burden the coalition is willing to bear; and (3) the
cost of collecting taxes.</p>
<p>Having filled government coffers, leaders spend resources in three
ways. First, they provide public goods—that is, policies that benefit
all. Second, they deliver private rewards to their coalition members.
This mix of private and public benefits differs across political
systems, and it’s worth noting that any resources left over after paying
off the coalition are discretionary. Leaders therefore have a third
choice to make about spending money. They can spend discretionary money
promoting their pet projects. Alternatively, and all too commonly, as we
shall see, they can hide it in a rainy-day fund.</p>
