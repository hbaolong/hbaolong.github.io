<h4 id="chapter-two-coming-to-power">CHAPTER TWO COMING TO POWER</h4>
<p>For centuries, “John Doe” has served as the placeholder name assigned
to unidentified nobodies. And while his first name may have been Samuel,
not John, in every other respect Liberia’s Sergeant Doe was just such a
nobody until April 12, 1980. Born in a remote part of Liberia’s interior
and virtually illiterate, he, like hundreds of thousands of others in
his predicament, moved out of the West African jungle in search of work.
He headed to the capital city, Monrovia, where he found that the army
held great opportunities even for men like him who had no skills. One of
these opportunities presented itself when Doe found himself in President
William Tolbert’s bedroom on April 12. As the president slept, he seized
the day, bayoneted the president, threw his entrails to the dogs, and
declared himself Liberia’s new president.1 Thus did he rise from
obscurity to claim the highest office in his land.</p>
<p>Together with sixteen other noncommissioned officers, Doe had scaled
the fence at the Executive Mansion, hoping to confront the president and
find out why they had not been paid. Seeing the opportunity before him,
he ended the dominance of Tolbert’s True Whig Party, a political regime
created by slaves repatriated from America in 1847. He immediately
rounded up thirteen cabinet ministers, who were then publicly executed
on the beach in front of cheering crowds. Many more deaths would follow.
Doe then headed the People’s Redemption Council, which suspended the
constitution and banned all political activity.</p>
<p>Doe had no idea what a president was supposed to do and even less
idea how to govern a country. What he did know was how to seize power
and keep it: remove the previous ruler, find the money, form a small
coalition, and pay the coalition just enough to keep them loyal. In
short order, he proceeded to replace virtually everyone who had been in
the government or the army with members of his own small Krahn tribe,
which made up only about 4 percent of the population. He increased the
pay of army privates from 5 to 50 per month. He purged everyone he did
not trust. Following secret trials, he had no fewer than fifty of his
original collaborators executed.</p>
<p>Doe funded his government, as his predecessors had, with revenues
from Firestone, which leased large tracts of land for rubber; from the
Liberian Iron Mining Company, which exported iron ore; and by
registering more than 2,500 ocean-going ships without requiring safety
inspections. Further, he received direct financial backing from the
United States government. The United States gave Doe’s government 00
million over ten years. In exchange the United States received basing
rights and made Liberia a center for US intelligence and propaganda. It
is believed that Doe and his cronies personally amassed 00 million.</p>
<p>As for Doe’s policies, they couldn’t be called successful. Indeed, he
produced virtually no policies at all. He was lazy and spent his days
hanging out with the wives of his presidential guards. The economy
collapsed, foreign debt soared, and criminal enterprises became
virtually the only successful businesses in Liberia. Monrovian banks
became money-laundering operations. Little wonder that the people of
Liberia ended up hating Doe. And yet, because he knew where the money
was and who needed paying off, he managed to survive in power.</p>
<p>Damn the idea of good governance and don’t elevate the concerns of
the people over your own and those of your supporters: that’s a good
mantra for would-be dictators. In such a way any John Doe—even a Samuel
Doe—can seize power, and even keep it.</p>
<p>PATHS TO POWER WITH FEW ESSENTIALS</p>
<p>To come to power a challenger need only do three things. First, he
must remove the incumbent. Second, he needs to seize the apparatus of
government. Third, he needs to form a coalition of supporters sufficient
to sustain him as the new incumbent. Each of these actions has its own
unique challenges. The relative ease with which they all can be
accomplished differs between democracies and autocracies.</p>
<p>There are three ways for an incumbent leader to leave office, making
room for a new leader. The first, and easiest, is for the leader to die.
If that convenience does not offer itself, a challenger can make an
offer to the essential members of the incumbent’s coalition that is
sufficiently attractive that they defect to the challenger’s cause.
Third, the current political system can be overwhelmed from the outside,
whether through military defeat by a foreign power or through revolution
and rebellion, in which the masses rise up, depose the current leader,
and destroy existing institutions.</p>
<p>While rebellion requires skill and coordination, its success
ultimately depends heavily upon coalition loyalty, or, more precisely,
the absence of loyalty to the old regime. Hosni Mubarak’s defeat by a
mass uprising in Egypt is a case in point. The most critical factor
behind Mubarak’s defeat in February 2011 was the decision by Egypt’s top
generals to allow demonstrators to take to the streets without fear of
military suppression. And why was that the case? As explained in a talk
given on May 5, 2010, based on the logic set out here, cuts in US
foreign aid to Egypt, combined with serious economic constraints that
produced high unemployment, meant that Mubarak’s coalition was likely
underpaid and the people were likely to believe the risks and costs of
rebellion were smaller than normal.2 That is, the general rule of thumb
for rebellion is that revolutions occur when those who preserve the
current system are sufficiently dissatisfied with their rewards that
they are willing to look for someone new to take care of them. On the
other hand, revolts are defeated through suppression of the
people—always an unpleasant task—so coalition members need to receive
enough benefits from their leader that they are willing to do horribly
distasteful things to ensure that the existing system is maintained. If
they do not get enough goodies under the current system, then they will
not stop the people from rising up against the regime.</p>
<p>SPEED IS ESSENTIAL</p>
<p>Once the old leader is gone, it is essential for a new leader to
seize the instruments of power, such as the treasury, as quickly as
possible. This is particularly important in small-coalition systems.
Anyone who waits will be a loser in the competition for power.</p>
<p>Speed is of the essence. In most political systems the coalition is
much smaller than a majority of the nominal selectorate. Furthermore,
even though we tend to think that if one leader has enough votes or
supporters, then the other potential candidates must be short, this is
wrong. There can be many different groups simultaneously trying to
organize to overthrow a regime, and each might have sufficient numbers
of lukewarm or double-dealing coalition members who could aid them in
securing power—or just as easily aid someone else, if the price is
right. This is why it is absolutely essential to seize the reins of
power quickly: so you can make sure that your group gets to control the
instruments of the state, and not someone else’s.</p>
<p>Samuel Doe ruled because his group had the guns. He did not need half
the nation to support him. He needed just enough confederates so that he
could control the army and suppress the rest of the population. There
were many other coalitions that could have formed, but Doe grabbed hold
of power first and suppressed the rest. This is the essence of coming to
power.</p>
<p>Consider a room filled with one hundred people. Anyone could take
complete control if she had five supporters with automatic weapons
pointed at the rest. She would remain in power so long as the five
gunmen continue to back her. But there need be nothing special about her
or about the gunmen beyond the fact that they grabbed the guns first.
Had someone else secured the guns and given them to five supporters of
their own, then it would have been someone else telling everyone what to
do.</p>
<p>Waiting is risky business. There is no prize for coming in
second.</p>
<p>PAY TO PLAY</p>
<p>Paying supporters, not good governance or representing the general
will, is the essence of ruling. Buying loyalty is particularly difficult
when a leader first comes to power. When deciding whether to support a
new leader, prudent backers must think not only about how much their
leader gives them today but also what they can expect to receive in the
future.</p>
<p>The supporting cast in any upstart’s transitional coalition must
recognize that they might not be kept on for long. After Doe took over
the Liberian government, he greatly increased army salaries. This made
it immediately attractive for his fellow army buddies to back him. But
they were mindful that they might not be rewarded forever. Don’t forget
that fifty of his initial backers were eventually executed.</p>
<p>Allaying supporters’ fears of being abandoned is a key element of
coming to power. Of course, supporters are not so naive that they will
be convinced by political promises that their position in the coalition
is secure. But such political promises are much better than tipping your
hand and revealing your true plans. Once word gets out that supporters
are going to be replaced, they will turn on their patron. For instance,
Ronald Reagan won the pro-choice vote in the 1980 US presidential
election over the pro-life incumbent, Jimmy Carter. When Reagan’s true
abortion stance became apparent, the pro-choice voters abandoned him in
droves. Walter Mondale won the pro-choice vote in the 1984 presidential
election, although Reagan was reelected in a landslide.</p>
<p>Leaders understand the conditions that can cost them their heads.
That is why they do their level best to pay essential cronies enough
that these partners really want to stay loyal. This makes it tough for
someone new to come to power. But sometimes circumstances conspire to
open the door to a new ruler.</p>
<p>MORTALITY: THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR POWER</p>
<p>Most unavoidably, and therefore first, on the list of risks of being
deposed is the simple, inescapable fact of mortality. Dead leaders
cannot deliver rewards to their coalition. Dying leaders face almost as
grave a problem. If essential backers know their leader is dying, then
they also know that they need someone new to assure the flow of revenue
into their pockets. That’s a good reason to keep terminal illnesses
secret: a terminal ailment is likely to provoke an uprising, either
within the ranks of the essential coalition or among outsiders who see
an opportunity to step in and take control of the palace.</p>
<p>Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran and Corazon Aquino in the
Philippines both chose the right time to seize power. Take the case of
Ayatollah Khomeini. He was one of the most senior Shia clerics in Iran
and a vehement opponent of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s secular regime.
During the early 1960s he spoke out against the regime and organized
protests. His activities resulted in his being repeatedly arrested. In
1964 he went into exile, first to Turkey, then to Iraq, and eventually
to France, continuing to preach his opposition to the shah wherever he
was. Tapes of his speeches were popular throughout Iran.</p>
<p>In 1977, with the death of the shah’s rival, Ali Shariati, Khomeini
became the most influential opposition leader. Although he urged others
to oppose the shah, he refused to return to Iran until the shah was
gone. Except for a privileged few, almost everyone in Iran hungered for
change. The shah’s regime and those associated with it were widely
disliked. Seeing that there was a chance for real change, people threw
their support behind the one clearly viable alternative: Khomeini. After
the shah fled the country, an estimated six million people turned out to
cheer Khomeini’s return. Judging from what he did next, they may have
cheered too soon.</p>
<p>Immediately after his return, Khomeini challenged the interim
government, which was headed by the shah’s former prime minister. Much
of the army defected and joined Khomeini, and when he ordered a jihad
against soldiers remaining loyal to the old regime, resistance
collapsed. Then he ordered a referendum in which the people would choose
between the old monarchy of the shah or an Islamic republic. With 98
percent of people endorsing the latter, he rewrote the constitution and
based it on rule by clerics. After some dubious electoral practices this
constitution was approved, and he became the Supreme Leader with a
Council of Guardians to veto non-Islamic laws and candidates. The many
secular and moderate religious groups who had taken to the streets on
his behalf, providing the critical support needed for his rise to power,
found they were left out, excluded from running the new regime. The
group of essentials dropped precipitously once Khomeini’s regime was
locked into power, shrinking on our 0-to-1 scale for coalition size from
0.47 to 0.26 between 1979 and 1983.</p>
<p>Khomeini became leader because he provided a focal point for
opposition to the shah’s regime and because the army did not stop the
people from rising up against the monarchy. Once the shah was gone,
Khomeini quickly asserted that it was he, not an interim government or a
council representing all interests, who was in charge. Although the
masses brought down the old regime in hopes of obtaining a more
democratic government, Khomeini ensured that real power was retained by
a small group of clerics, closely following rule 1. The parliament,
while popularly elected, could only contain politicians who supported
and were supported by the Council of Guardians.</p>
<p>There was nothing special or unique about Khomeini’s success. That
millions wanted the shah’s regime overturned is unsurprising. The shah
ran a brutal, oppressive government under which thousands disappeared.
Imprisonment, torture, and death were commonplace. But that had been
equally true fourteen years earlier when Khomeini went into exile and
the shah’s government seemed invulnerable. The key to Khomeini’s success
at the end of the 1970s was that the army refused to stop the unhappy
millions from taking to the streets. They had not allowed such protests
before. What had changed? The army was no longer willing to fight to
preserve the regime because they knew that the shah was dying. The New
York Times Magazine published an account of the farce of a sick leader
desperate to hide the progression of his cancer.3 A dead shah couldn’t
guarantee rewards. Neither could his successor. The incumbency advantage
unraveled. Faced with the unpleasant task of suppressing the people with
only a modest prospect of continuing to enjoy the lavish rewards of
coalition membership, the army sat on its hands, smoothing the way for
revolution.</p>
<p>The story of the rise of democracy in the Philippines is not much
different. Benigno Aquino Jr. was an outstanding man. At the age of
eighteen he was awarded the Philippine Legion of Honor for his
journalism during the Korean War. He then negotiated the surrender of a
rebel group. He was mayor of Concepcion by age twenty-two, governor of
Tarlac Province at twenty-nine, and a senator by thirty-four. In a
dangerous move, he became an outspoken critic of President Ferdinand
Marcos. His outspokenness resulted in his imprisonment. In 1980, while
in prison, he suffered two heart attacks. Doctors had political (not
medical) concerns about performing bypass surgery, and he feared that
they might be in cahoots with Marcos. He asked for and was granted the
opportunity to exile himself to the United States in exchange for the
promise that he would not speak out against Marcos, a promise he broke
after a successful surgery in Dallas. In 1983, Benigno returned from
exile in the United States. On the flight back to Manila he warned
journalists that it might all be over in minutes. And it was. He was
immediately taken from the plane and assassinated on the tarmac. He
should have followed Khomeini’s example and bided his time.</p>
<p>His wife, Corazon, did not have his political skills or experience,
but she had one critical advantage: she was alive! In late 1985
Ferdinand Marcos announced snap elections a year earlier than scheduled.
Corazon Aquino stepped in as her late husband’s surrogate and ran as the
main opposition candidate. There was widespread fraud at the elections
on February 7, 1986, so it was of little surprise when, just over a week
later, the electoral commission declared Marcos the winner. But Marcos’s
supporters swiftly deserted him. President Ronald Reagan expressed
concern about the electoral result. Jaime Cardinal Sin, influential
leader of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, spoke out. At Corazon
Aquino’s urging, the people protested. Key members of the army and other
leading political figures resigned from the government and joined the
demonstrations. Without the army to stop them, hundreds of thousands of
people joined the protest, resulting in the defection of still more
military leaders.</p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid bloodshed, Marcos and his family sought
sanctuary in the United States. They left the Philippines and settled in
Hawaii, but, as insiders and many others knew, Marcos would not live
long. That, in fact, had been his problem all along. He was dying of
lupus, and all his key backers knew it. He could not deliver goodies
from beyond the grave, so his supporters sought to ingratiate themselves
with someone who might benefit them. Corazon Aquino had no experience in
government. Yet she succeeded where her more accomplished husband had
failed. She challenged Marcos at a time when his supporters knew his
life was coming to an end. They were looking for a new partner to defend
in exchange for rewards. Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as president and
was Time magazine’s Woman of the Year for 1986.</p>
<p>These are not isolated examples. Laurent Kabila, once maligned by Che
Guevara as lacking “revolutionary seriousness” and being “too addicted
to alcohol and women,” took on the mighty Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and
won.4 Kabila lacked talent, but his timing was excellent. Mobutu was
dying of prostate cancer, and everybody knew it. His military simply
refused to fight back as Kabila’s insurgents captured more and more
territory. Mobutu’s erstwhile backers knew that their own future would
be brighter if they abandoned their dying patron, a sentiment captured
in the announcement, “The king is dead; long live the king!”</p>
<p>Legitimate health concerns for North Korea’s Kim Jong Il and Cuba’s
Fidel Castro engendered similarly intense political speculation. Both
attempted to stave off defection by their essential coalition members by
nominating heirs. Kim Jong Il promoted his youngest son, Kim Jong-Un, to
a variety of posts, including the rank of four-star general, even though
his son had no military experience. Fidel Castro likewise promoted his
brother, Raúl, to president when Fidel’s survival was in doubt following
major surgery. Raúl, in turn, stepped down in April 2021, just two
months ahead of his ninetieth birthday. Of course, like Kim Jong Il and
Fidel, Raúl named his own successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel. By designating
heirs who might keep the existing winning coalition largely intact,
these leaders sought to prevent the incumbency advantage from
disappearing as their ability to deliver on political promises was
brought into jeopardy. Fidel and Kim died peacefully and their
designated heirs took over. It will be interesting to watch what happens
in Cuba now that Raúl has also stepped down. Resignation, as in the case
of Fidel, often leads to a successful, controlled power transition—but,
most assuredly, not always. After all, once the king is dead, he is,
well, dead, and unable to control the unfolding events. It would be wise
for these modern dynastic dictators to recall that half of Europe’s
dynastic monarchs in the past were not succeeded by the chosen heir.</p>
<p>Impending death often induces political death. For this reason a
leader’s health is the most important state secret. However, once a
leader is dead the need for secrecy vanishes, so to gauge the importance
of health we were able to collect data on the date and cause of death of
political leaders from sources such as obituaries. On average, the risk
of being deposed in any particular year is about 19 percent. However,
for leaders like Marcos and the shah who have a serious chronic health
condition that will lead to death within three years, this deposition
risk nearly doubles. Health concerns particularly exacerbate the risk of
removal by revolution and coup.5 The epitaph “died in office” is
generally reserved for leaders who hide their illness.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that if you want to come to power in an autocracy,
you are better off stealing medical records than you are devising fixes
for your nation’s ills. Power mostly belongs to the healthy—that is, to
people whose promise to deliver future goodies to loyal backers can be
believed.</p>
<p>INHERITANCE AND THE PROBLEM OF RELATIVES</p>
<p>We don’t mean to say that healthy leaders don’t face hazards of their
own. If an incumbent runs out of money, he cannot continue to pay his
supporters. Why might he run out of money? Because he has taxed so
heavily and stolen so much that the masses choose siestas over labor,
stymieing the future flow of revenue into the government’s treasury.
Worse, the masses could choose revolution over siestas, emboldened by
the realization that things will only get worse if they do not act now
to overthrow their masters. Mismanagement of coalition dynamics and the
incentives of revolutionary entrepreneurs can create changes in
institutions that topple the incumbent regime and bring new leaders to
power.</p>
<p>Normally one of the most difficult tasks a challenger faces is
removing the incumbent. But this is instantly achieved when a leader
dies or, as in the case of William Tolbert, is murdered. Once an
incumbent is dead, there is still the issue of fending off competitors
for the dead leader’s job. Ambitious challengers still need to grab
control of the state apparatus, reward supporters, and eliminate rivals.
To resolve this issue, the Ottomans, who ruled what is today’s Turkey
from 1299 until 1923, eventually instituted the law of fratricide.6</p>
<p>When the sultan died, the succession depended upon who could capture
control of the state and reward his coalition. In practice this meant
grabbing the treasury and paying off the army. Succession became a
battle of survival of the fittest to see which son would become the next
sultan. Each of the sultan’s sons governed a province of his own. When
the sultan died, the sons raced back to the capital, Constantinople, in
an attempt to seize the treasury and pay the army for its loyalty. The
result could often be civil war, as each brother used his provincial
force to try to achieve sole, total control of the state. The sultan
could have already shown favor to one son over others simply by giving
him a province to govern that was closer to the capital, thereby
favoring that son even from the grave.</p>
<p>Ottoman succession was most unpleasant and bloody. Unsuccessful
brothers were typically killed. Mehmed II (1432–1481) institutionalized
this practice with the fratricide law, under which all unsuccessful male
heirs were strangled with a silk cord. A century later, Mehmed III
(1566–1603) allegedly killed nineteen brothers, two sons, and fifteen
slaves who were pregnant by his own father, thereby eliminating all
present and future potential rivals. By the middle of the seventeenth
century this practice was replaced by the kinder, gentler practice of
locking all male relatives in the Fourth Court of the Topkapi
Palace—quite literally the original Golden Cage. With relatives like
this, it is perhaps no wonder that Shakespeare’s Hamlet or Robert
Graves’s Claudius chose to feign madness.</p>
<p>The general dilemma of succession is hardly unique to the Ottomans.
England’s King Richard the Lionheart died in 1199. Since Richard had no
direct heirs, at least three people had a strong claim to the English
throne following his death. Richard’s father was the previous king,
Henry II, meaning that succession could be claimed by Henry II’s wife,
Eleanor of Aquitaine, then nearing eighty years old; by Henry’s eldest
surviving son, John; or by Henry’s older—but deceased—son Geoffrey’s
eldest surviving male child (himself but eleven years old), Arthur.</p>
<p>Eleanor was too pragmatic to put herself at risk for the crown,
especially given her advanced years. She understood the likely
consequences for her if she pushed her claim. Being the loving mother
and grandmother that she surely must have been, she stepped aside,
leaving John and Arthur to fight it out. Or, more precisely, she looked
at who was likely to win and threw her support in that direction,
allowing herself to change directions as the winds of fortune switched
from time to time.</p>
<p>Would-be autocrats must be prepared to kill all comers—even immediate
family members. The Ottomans formalized this practice while the English
merely relied on the tradition of doing in their rivals. Murder seems to
be a favored solution under the extreme conditions of fear and
insecurity that accompany monarchic and autocratic successions. What did
John do? Even after assuming the crown he continued to fear Arthur’s
quest for power, a quest that grew more intense as the boy aged into his
teenage years. Finally, in 1203, John had Arthur taken prisoner and
murdered. Some rumors suggested that he killed his nephew personally.
With Arthur out of the way, no one stood as a further threat to John’s
crown—not until the nobles rose up against him and forced him to sign
the Magna Carta, twelve years later.</p>
<p>Inheritance holds a number of advantages for leaders and their
supporters alike. Paying off the right people is the essence of good
government—and princes are well equipped to continue to reward
supporters. They know where the money is and who to pay off. Even so,
why should the court be so keen to go along with inheritance? After all,
if the prince takes the top job, then the other courtiers cannot be king
(or dictator or president) in his place. Supporting inheritance
inevitably means giving up the chance to become king yourself. Yet that
is just one side of the calculation. With so many people who would like
to be king, the chance of landing the top job is tiny. In reality,
supporters of the late king are often best off elevating his son and
hoping that he then dances with the one who brought him to the ball.</p>
<p>You may be thinking that murdering family is out of fashion in this
allegedly more civilized time. Sad to say, living family members are no
less of a threat today in some regimes than was true in the time of King
John. Stalin had loads of relatives executed. Several of Saddam
Hussein’s cousins and in-laws were executed or met their death
indirectly at the hands of other family members. And how about North
Korea’s Kim Jong-Un? He ordered the execution of his beloved uncle Jang
Song-Thaek in 2013 and seems to have had his brother, Kim Jong-Nam,
murdered in 2017. It can be exceedingly dangerous to be related to a
ruler even today, but then it can also be exceedingly profitable.</p>
<p>New leaders need supporters to stay in power, and with inheritance
those supporters are all already in place. The prince knows who they are
and how to pay them. Of course, as we saw with France’s Louis XIV, the
prince might radically alter the coalition. But supporters of the old
king correctly believe in the old adage, “Like father, like son.” It’s
not a bad gamble for them. Essential supporters have a much greater
chance of retaining their privileged position when power passes within a
family, from father to son, from king to prince, than when power passes
to an outsider. If you are a prince and you want to be king, then you
should do nothing to dissuade your father’s supporters from believing
they will be important to you too. They will curry favor with you. You
should let them. You will need them to secure a smooth transition. If
you want them gone (and you may not), then banish them from court later.
But the first time they need to know your true feelings for them is when
you banish them from court, well after your investiture.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you’re a young prince who hopes to be king, you’ll have
to make sure to outlive your “supporters.” History has shown that
regents are notoriously bad caregivers. Provided a regent is prepared to
kill his charge, being entrusted with the care of the would-be future
king is a great way to become king. England’s King Richard III provides
an example. When Edward IV died in 1483, the crown fell to his
twelve-year-old son, Edward V. Richard III, King Edward IV’s brother,
was appointed Lord Protector of the Commonwealth and charged with
looking after the prince’s interests. He was supposed to manage the
crown for a few years and then hand it over. Like many leaders, however,
Richard didn’t relish the idea of giving up power.</p>
<p>As the trusted executor of King Edward IV’s wishes, Richard was able
to manipulate events to his own benefit. First he had twelve-year-old
Edward and his younger brother taken to the Tower of London. Richard
then had Parliament declare both princes illegitimate by questioning the
legitimacy of their parents’ marriage. The princes were never seen
again. Richard may not have been much of an executor, but he seems to
have had no trouble with execution. (It is believed that two skeletons
found under a staircase in 1674 belonged to the two young boys.)</p>
<p>Even in systems that rely on inheritance, a door can nevertheless be
opened for a designated successor who is not a blood relative. Leaders
often nominate their successor and sometimes choose someone outside of
their immediate relations, perhaps because they understand the dire
risks to family if they turn to one member and not another. For
instance, the first Roman emperor, Augustus, formally adopted his
successor, Tiberius. Mob bosses often do the same. Carlo Gambino
nominated “Big Paulie” Castellano to succeed him as head of his New York
mafia family. In each case, the designated successor was seen as someone
likely to continue the programs and projects of the prior leader.
Therefore, there wasn’t much rush to replace the old leader. The
designated successors might even enhance the old boss’s reputation.</p>
<p>For sick and decrepit leaders, nominating an heir can help them live
out the rest of their life in power. Provided the essentials in the
coalition believe the heir will retain sufficient continuity in the
coalition’s makeup, inheritance or nominated succession can make it very
difficult for outsiders to offer essential coalition members more than
they expect from the father-son succession.</p>
<p>Of course, for such dynastic succession to work, a leader must
nominate the right successor—the one that the coalition believes will
act in their interest. It was in this criterion that Robert Mugabe, a
master of maintaining coalition loyalty, finally slipped up. At the age
of ninety-four and in declining health, Mugabe was deposed by a coup in
2017, having ruled Zimbabwe since 1980. His wife, Grace, had publicly
urged him to appoint her as his successor.7 Unfortunately for the old
guard of Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party, Grace was associated with a younger
faction of the party.8 Her ascension would almost certainly have
curtailed their access to wealth and privilege, and so they deposed him.
Better for them to take the gamble that their choice of successor would
keep them on than stay loyal knowing they would be replaced once Mugabe
eventually passed away. He died in 2019.</p>
<p>PAPAL BULL(YING) FOR POWER</p>
<p>Some of the greatest stories and movies of all time portray how the
fate of whole nations, peoples, and faiths comes down to the actions of
a single individual. Whether it is Luke Skywalker wrestling with father
issues or Frodo disposing of a ring, massed battles have only secondary
importance compared to an individual’s triumph. It makes for great
fiction, certainly, but such events happen in fact too.</p>
<p>For Christianity’s first several hundred years, the Bishop of
Rome—the pope—was not the leading figure even within the Christian
community. Bishops were the arbiters of Christian practice and belief,
but not until Damasus I, pope from 366 to 384, was the Bishop of Rome
truly elevated above other Roman Catholic bishops, becoming the head of
the western Roman Catholic Church.9 Eventually sainted for his
extraordinary accomplishments, Damasus is a case study in the
manipulation of essentials, influentials, and interchangeables.</p>
<p>By the late 300s, the East had a seemingly insurmountable advantage
in the long struggle between the eastern and western branches of
Christianity. The apostles and, of course, Jesus himself all came from
the East. The holy places were in Jerusalem and Galilee and nearby
cities in today’s Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. With such
incontestable credentials, how could Christianity be seen first and
foremost as anything other than an eastern religion? Damasus had the
insight to find an answer. True, the apostles came from the East, but
Peter and Paul were martyred in Rome, and it was in Rome that they were
buried. Thus he could argue that Rome was privileged by being the scene
of apostolic missions intended to spread the word and by the profound
example of martyrdom carried out of the East and to Rome.</p>
<p>Damasus made the compelling case that only the See of Peter in Rome
could be the heart of Christianity because, as Jesus reportedly said
(Matthew 16:17–20), “I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I
will build my church, and the gates of Hell will not overcome it. I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed
in heaven.” Rome, then, must have a superior claim compared to the
eastern Sees. On the surface, this may seem to be an explicitly
religious argument—but powerful though it is, it obscures the
coalition-building strategies that actually made Damasus pope and made
the Roman Church the new locus of power.</p>
<p>Nowadays a new pope is elected by the College of Cardinals upon the
death of the pope. In Damasus’s day, the method was different. The
interchangeables—the nominal selectorate—consisted of all of the
Christians in the Roman diocese. The influentials included at least the
local clergy and other bishops from the province. Defining the winning
coalition—the essentials—is where the tale of Damasus’s success must
begin.</p>
<p>Damasus had a rival for election as pope, Ursinus. Ursinus was
popular with the lay Christians and with much of the clergy. Damasus, in
contrast, enjoyed the support of the aristocracy. Both men had worked
closely with the previous pope, Liberius. When Liberius was exiled to
Berea by Emperor Constantius II in 354, Damasus, like Ursinus, followed
him into exile. Unlike Ursinus, however, Damasus wasted no time
returning to Rome, abandoning Liberius and throwing his support behind
the antipope Felix II, who was favored by the emperor. This most
assuredly helped cement Damasus’s popularity with the controlling
classes while alienating the lay Christian community and clergy.</p>
<p>When Liberius died in 366, parallel papal elections were held,
resulting in both Damasus and Ursinus claiming election. Ursinus was
chosen by the faithful plebian worshippers and Damasus by the powerful.
Riots ensued, leading to a bloody massacre in which 137 people were
slaughtered in the Basilica of Sicininus, a popular Roman church. The
city’s prefects—the secular leaders of Rome—stepped in and restored
order by establishing Damasus as the one and only pope. They dealt with
the threat Ursinus represented by exiling him to Gaul. So it was that
Ursinus’s larger coalition of lay worshippers was defeated by the
smaller but much more powerful coalition behind Damasus. As we shall see
when we discuss nation building in chapter 7, undermining democratic
institutions is a tried and trusted means of maintaining influence.
Although Christianity became Rome’s official religion in 380, it wasn’t
until after the collapse of Rome in 476 that the papacy gained its
independence from Rome.</p>
<p>Damasus did not come by his upper-crust backing by accident. We have
already seen that he supported Felix II over Liberius. He assiduously
pursued support from the upper classes of Romans, many of them pagans,
before (and during) his papacy, thereby ensuring their loyalty to him in
return for his loyal pursuit of policies that benefited them. For
instance, he made a habit of cultivating the upper-class women of Rome.
His detractors, noting his close associations with Rome’s leading
ladies, accused him of adultery (and murder). He was exonerated thanks
to direct intervention by the emperor himself. His promoters, in
contrast, noted that he had converted many aristocratic pagan women to
Christianity and they, in turn, had brought their husbands into the
fold, thereby expanding the selectorate and perhaps the influentials in
Rome’s Christian community. That, of course, was good for the growth of
the Church, but it also was good for Damasus’s ability to secure and
hold power. He relied on a small coalition—unlike Ursinus—and he worked
on drawing that coalition from an enlarged set of influentials and
interchangeables.</p>
<p>Being a sophisticated strategist, he also worked to further expand
the set of interchangeables by reaching out to the Christian masses of
Rome. This could only help him shore up his political power and his
discretionary authority over Church funds, discretionary authority he
later used to build important public works and to employ (Saint) Jerome
to write the Vulgate, the first accessible Latin translation of the
Bible, which further solidified the Roman pope’s ability to dictate the
meaning of the gospels.</p>
<p>How did Damasus expand his appeal to the masses—the
interchangeables—many of whom had opposed his papacy? It seems that many
of the recently converted laypeople of the declining Roman Empire missed
their many pagan Roman gods. Damasus recognized that these same people
seemed happy to substitute the many Christian martyrs for those gods.
Damasus focused his energy on discovering the burial places of martyrs
and erecting great marble monuments. Some of his monuments and
inscriptions to martyrs can still be seen in Rome to this day.</p>
<p>Damasus’s efforts bore fruit. He won over and expanded the Christian
laity, gained support among the upper classes, and even captured the
support of the emperor himself, who endorsed Damasus’s view of the
preeminence of the See of Rome. On February 28, 380, Emperor Theodosius
declared that everyone must abide by the Christian principles as
declared by “the Apostle Peter to the Romans, and now followed by Bishop
Damasus and Peter of Alexandria.”10</p>
<p>Damasus understood what to do to come to power and how to retain it.
Indeed, after his ignominious road to election as pope, he did good
works from the perspective of the Roman Catholic Church and achieved
sainthood for himself. The door to his coming to power was opened by the
errors of Liberius, his predecessor, who alienated the emperor instead
of cultivating him as an ally. Damasus did not make that error. He built
a small winning coalition drawn from an expanded set of influentials and
interchangeables, thereby ensuring loyal, long-lasting support for
himself and his papacy. And, in the process, his battle for power
shifted Christianity away from its Eastern origins and set it on the
path to becoming a Western faith.</p>
<p>Leaders who fail to do the right thing, like Liberius, provide
opportunities for someone new to come to power. But remember, what
constitutes doing the right thing must be understood from the
perspective of a potential supporter; it may have nothing to do with
what is best for a community or nation. Anyone who thinks leaders do
what they ought to do—that is, what is best for their nation of
subjects—ought to become an academic rather than enter political life.
In politics, coming to power is never about doing the right thing. It is
always about doing what is expedient.</p>
<p>SEIZING POWER FROM THE BANKRUPT</p>
<p>As it turns out, one thing that is always expedient is remaining
solvent. If a ruler runs out of money with which to pay his supporters,
it becomes far easier for someone else to make coalition members an
attractive offer. Financial crises are an opportune time to strike.</p>
<p>The Russian Revolution is often portrayed through the prism of
Marxist ideology and class warfare. The reality might be much simpler.
Kerensky’s revolutionaries were able to storm the Winter Palace in
February 1917 because the army did not stop them. And the army did not
bother to stop them because the czar did not pay them enough. The czar
could not pay them enough because he had foolishly lost one of his major
sources of revenue, the vodka tax, at the same time that he was fighting
World War I.</p>
<p>Czar Nicholas confused what might seem like good public policy with
bad political decision-making. He had the silly idea that a sober army
would prove more effective than an army that was falling-over drunk.
Nicholas, it seems, thought that a ban on vodka would improve the
performance of Russia’s troops in World War I. He missed the obvious
downsides, however. Vodka was vastly popular with the general populace
and, most assuredly, with the troops. So popular and widely consumed was
vodka that its sale provided about a third of the government’s revenue.
With vodka banned, his revenue diminished sharply. His expenses, in
contrast, kept on rising because of the costs of the war.</p>
<p>Soon Nicholas was no longer able to buy loyalty. As a result, his
army refused to stop strikers and protesters. Alexander Kerensky formed
Russia’s short-lived democratic government after toppling the czar’s
regime. But he couldn’t hang on to power for long. His mistake was
operating a democratic government, which necessitated a large coalition,
while implementing an unpopular policy—continuing the czar’s war—thereby
alienating his coalition right from the start. Lenin and the Bolsheviks
made no such mistakes.</p>
<p>The czar fell once there was no one to stop the revolution. Louis XVI
suffered much the same fate in the French Revolution. Successful leaders
must learn the lesson of these examples and put raising revenue and
paying supporters above all else. Consider Robert Mugabe’s success in
staying on as Zimbabwe’s president until he was in his midnineties. The
economy collapsed in Zimbabwe thanks to Mugabe’s terrible policies.
Starvation was common, and epidemics of cholera regularly swept the
country. Mugabe “succeeded” because he understood that it did not matter
what happened to the people provided that he made sure to pay the army.
He reduced a once-thriving agricultural exporting nation into one that
became dependent on foreign aid. Mugabe was certainly horrible for what
he did to the people he ruled, but he was a master of the rules to rule
by. Where policy matters most, paying off cronies, he delivered. That is
why he survived in power for decades, until he was just too old to be
counted on to provide future bounty for his essential supporters.</p>
<p>Myanmar’s generals seem to have taken a ream of pages from Mugabe’s
playbook. They govern a country that routinely swings into economic
misery and mass starvation, but they make sure to pay the loyal military
well, murder anyone they suspect of disloyalty, and soak in economic
support from the United States, China, and others, playing each against
the others when they can. They bemoan the people’s misery, blame it on
others, and promise better times but only deliver those better times to
the few whose support they need. Like Mugabe and so many other
“successful” leaders before him, Myanmar’s leaders have mastered the
rules to rule by.</p>
<p>SILENCE IS GOLDEN</p>
<p>We all grew up hearing the lesson that silence is golden. As it turns
out, violating that basic principle is yet another path by which
incumbents can succumb to their political rivals.</p>
<p>The incumbent’s advantage in offering rewards disappears as soon as
coalition members come to suspect their access to personal benefits will
end. An incumbent’s failure to reassure his coalition that he will
continue to take care of them provides competitors with a golden
opportunity to seize power. Houari Boumedienne was able to seize the
Algerian presidency from Ahmed Ben Bella in 1965 after Ben Bella
foolishly opened his mouth. Silence would have served him better.</p>
<p>Ben Bella achieved fame both on the soccer pitch and as a war hero.
He joined the French army in 1936 and, while posted to Marseille, played
for its professional soccer team. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and
the Médaille militaire for his gallantry during World War II. After the
war he joined the struggle to liberate Algeria from France. He became a
popular figure in the independence movement and was elected president of
Algeria in 1963. But despite his many talents, he made a serious
mistake. On June 12, 1966, he announced that there would be a Politburo
meeting a week later and that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss
three major issues: (1) changes in the cabinet; (2) changes in the army
command; and (3) the liquidation of the military opposition. He then
left Algiers for Oran.</p>
<p>This announcement was tantamount to telling his essential supporters
that he was getting rid of some of them. Since he did not say who was to
go, he created a common interest among the whole group in getting rid of
him.</p>
<p>Ben Bella’s foolish announcement was just the opening that Houari
Boumedienne needed. No one was certain who would be replaced, but given
Ben Bella’s sweeping statement, clearly many would be. In this unforced
error, Ben Bella threw away his incumbency advantage and left
Boumedienne a week to organize a plot of his own. Ben Bella returned to
Algiers the day before the scheduled meeting and was awakened at
gunpoint by his friend Colonel Tahar Zbiri. Boumedienne grasped his
opportunity, and Ben Bella’s essential supporters defected.11 Silence,
as Ben Bella learned far too late, truly is golden. There is never any
point in showing your hand before you have to; that is just a way to
give the game away.</p>
<p>INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE</p>
<p>There is a common adage that politicians don’t change the rules that
brought them to power. This is false. They are ever ready and eager to
reduce coalition size. What politicians seek to avoid are any
institutional changes that increase the number of people to whom they
are beholden. Yet as much as they try to avoid these changes,
circumstances do arise when institutions must become more inclusive.
This can make autocrats vulnerable because the coalition they have
established and the rewards they provide are then no longer sufficient
to maintain power.</p>
<p>Under the old Soviet system, Boris Yeltsin had no chance of rising to
power.12 His first effort at becoming a major player relied on a
proposal every bit as foolish as Czar Nicholas’s decision to ban vodka
sales. He sought to end Communist Party members’ access to special
stores, privileged access to the best universities, and other benefits
not shared by the working people of the Soviet Union. Sure, that was
popular with the masses, but the masses didn’t have much say in choosing
who ran the Soviet Union—party members did. Mikhail Gorbachev, seeing
that Yeltsin was a loose cannon, sent him packing. After this setback,
Yeltsin only survived by being resilient and inventive in the face of a
changed environment.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s the Soviet economy had stagnated. This left the
recently promoted Soviet leader, Gorbachev, with a serious dilemma.
Unless he could somehow resuscitate the economy, he was liable to run
out of money. As we have seen, this situation can get leaders into
serious trouble. In order to get the economy moving so that there would
continue to be enough money, Gorbachev needed to loosen control over the
people, freeing their suppressed entrepreneurial potential.</p>
<p>Economic liberalization wasn’t a simple matter for the Soviets. It
entailed giving Soviet citizens many more personal and political
freedoms. On the upside, this allowed the people to communicate,
coordinate, and interact, which can be good for economic growth. On the
downside, allowing people to communicate, coordinate, and interact
facilitates mass political protest. Gorbachev was no fool and presumably
knew liberalization could get him in trouble. Unfortunately for him, he
was between a rock and a hard place. Without a stronger economy his
Soviet Union could not hope to compete with the United States and
maintain its superpower status. And, more importantly, he could not pay
party members the rewards they were used to. To get a stronger economy
he had to put his political control at risk, both from the masses, who
wanted a speedier path to prosperity, and from his coalition, who feared
losing their privileges. Gorbachev rolled the dice and ultimately
lost.</p>
<p>First Gorbachev faced a coup from within his own coalition. In 1991,
harder-line antireform party members, fearful of losing their special
privileges (a loss openly advocated by Boris Yeltsin), deposed Gorbachev
and took control of the government. But then Boris Yeltsin, standing
atop a tank in Red Square, ensured that the Soviet military would not
fire on protesters who wanted reform. The mass movement, with Boris
Yeltsin at its head, overthrew the coup that wanted to return to the
Soviet Union’s more repressive policies of the past. The mass movement
returned Gorbachev ever so briefly to power, leaving him with a
much-diminished rump Soviet Union and paving the way for the dissolution
of the Soviet empire just a few months later.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, having gotten over his privileges fiasco, understood that he
could not forge a winning coalition out of the inner circles of the
Communist Party, but he could win over the apparatchiks by promoting
greater budgetary autonomy for the Russian republic within the Soviet
structure. They could become richer and more powerful in Russia than
they had been in the Soviet Union. In this way, Yeltsin picked off
essential members of Gorbachev’s coalition and made himself a winner.
Yeltsin was, as it turned out, much better at working out how to come to
power than he was at governing well, but that is a tale for another
time.</p>
<p>COMING TO POWER IN A DEMOCRACY</p>
<p>Most of the examples we have discussed so far have involved
autocracies. Although generally much less violent, leader transitions in
democracies operate via the same mechanisms. Just as in an autocracy, a
challenger in a democracy needs to ensure the deposition of the
incumbent, seize command of the instruments of state, and sufficiently
reward a coalition of supporters so that they back her as the new
incumbent. Yet the way these goals are achieved is quite different in
democracies.</p>
<p>In some respects, it is easier. In a democracy it is less difficult,
for instance, to detach supporters from the dominant coalition, because
democrats need such a large number of supporters. Leaders rely heavily
on public goods to reward their backers, but precisely because so many
of the rewards are public goods that benefit everyone, those in the
coalition are not much better off than those outside the coalition.
Furthermore, since personal rewards are relatively modest once the
essential bloc is so large, loyalty is further diluted. The risk of
exclusion from the next leader’s coalition remains relatively
small—after all, the next leader will need a lot of backers too—further
weakening the incumbency advantage.</p>
<p>Challengers succeed when they offer better rewards than the existing
government. Given that there are so many who need rewarding, this means
coming up with better, or at least more popular, public policies.
Unfortunately, because it is easy to erode the support of the
incumbent’s coalition, it remains difficult for the challenger to pay
off her own supporters.</p>
<p>When democratic leaders come to power they need to seize control of
the government, but there is not the frenzied rush that we observe in
autocracies. In the United States, for instance, leaders elected in
November are not sworn in until the following January. This lag gives
incoming presidents time to prepare, nominating their cabinet and
appointing people to positions that need to be filled. Originally the
delay (which once lasted until March) was required because leaders
needed months to travel to the capital from the state where they lived.
Contenders to become a new dictator or monarch never extend the courtesy
of waiting for their more distant kin to travel great distances to
compete with them. Democrats lack urgency when assuming power because
the democratic rules that determine that the incumbent has been defeated
simultaneously create a coalition of supporters for the new leader.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATIC INHERITANCE</p>
<p>Democrats, because they rely on a large coalition, cannot lavish
great wealth on their supporters personally. They simply do not have
enough money to go around. Instead democrats need to find effective
public policies that their supporters like and reward their loyalty that
way. But this is not to say there are no private goods in democratic
politics. There are. And this explains why dynastic rule is common even
in democracies. It may be surprising to learn, for instance, that a
careful study finds that 31.2 percent of American female legislators
(and 8.4 percent of men) had a close relative precede them in their
political role.13 Nearly 20 percent of American presidents have been
close relatives of each other. That’s a lot more than chance and fair
competition suggest.</p>
<p>Dynastic rule is commonplace in democracies for exactly the same
reasons that it is popular among autocrats and monarchs. Who better to
protect the wealth and prestige of the family than family members?
Elected officials get to dole out money and enjoy power and money in
return. They are as eager to see their progeny enjoy the same
benefits—and protect their own legacy—as Emperor Augustus or Carlo
Gambino. And so it is that the Tafts of Ohio have held high office
generation after generation. Ohio’s governor from 1999 to 2007, Bob
Taft, for instance, enjoyed an illustrious pedigree. His father and his
grandfather were both US senators, his great-grandfather was president
of the United States, and his great-great-grandfather was attorney
general and secretary of war. The Kennedys, the Rockefellers, the
Roosevelts, the Bushes, and many other American families also have long
and distinguished political histories. And this is not only an American
phenomenon. Kenya’s 2017 election was a contest between two candidates:
Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s first president, and Raila Odinga,
the son of Kenya’s first vice president. Despite a population of
fifty-two million, the leading candidates were drawn from a few leading
families.</p>
<p>Of course, dynastic rule is more common outside of democracies. Even
if you don’t have the good fortune to be born into a political dynasty,
you can come to power in a democracy if you have good, or at least
popular, ideas. Good ideas that help the people are rarely the path to
power in a dictatorship.</p>
<p>DEMOCRACY IS AN ARMS RACE FOR GOOD IDEAS</p>
<p>Competition in democracies is cerebral, not physical. Killing foes
works for dictators, but it is a pretty surefire path to political
oblivion in a democracy. That’s a good thing from a moral standpoint, of
course. But from a democrat’s point of view, the corollary is that even
good public policy does not buy much loyalty.</p>
<p>Everyone in a democracy receives policy benefits, whether they
support the incumbent or not. If a leader cleans up the environment or
solves climate change, then everyone is a winner, although of course the
extent to which individuals value these things will vary. But past deeds
don’t buy loyalty. When a rival proposes a cheaper way to fix the
environment or finds policy fixes for other problems that people care
about more, then the rival can seize power through the ballot box.
Autocratic politics is a battle for private rewards, for a bigger slice
of a relatively small pie. Democratic politics is a battle for good
policy ideas. If you reward your cronies lavishly and at the expense of
the broader public, as you would in a dictatorship, then you will be out
on your ear so long as you rely on a massive coalition of essential
backers. It’s fine to give backers a big hunk of pie, but that hunk had
better be a small portion of the whole pie if a democrat wants to have a
chance to survive in power.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill is certainly a candidate for Britain’s greatest
statesman. He is deservedly famous for his wonderful oratory. Yet
patriotic rhetoric alone was not enough to defeat Hitler’s Nazi Germany
in World War II. Churchill did not just deliver rhetoric; he delivered
policy results too. He convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt to
implement the lend-lease program that enabled a virtually bankrupt
Britain to keep fighting. He converted the British economy to an
efficient wartime footing and found ways to pressure the Axis powers on
multiple fronts. He was fondly admired and praised by the vast majority
of Britons at the end of the war. Yet Clement Attlee’s Labour Party
decisively defeated Churchill’s Conservative Party in elections held in
July 1945. Technically speaking, World War II—a war that Winston
Churchill, as much as any single individual, might be credited with
having won—wasn’t even over yet. And already the people of Britain were
ready to toss Winston out.</p>
<p>Churchill famously stated in November 1942, following Britain’s
victory at El Alamein, “I have not become the King’s First Minister in
order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.” British
voters ensured he did not have to. Churchill offered the policies of
continued austerity to make Britain great again. After six hard years of
war, rationing, and sacrifice, these policies had little appeal. Attlee
chose to promote the National Health Service and the creation of a
welfare state over the reestablishment of international dominance. He
won the battle for good ideas. Few would deny Churchill did a
magnificent job as prime minister, and he was much loved. But it was
Attlee who won.</p>
<p>COALITION DYNAMICS</p>
<p>That democrats need so many supporters makes them vulnerable. If you
can find an issue over which the incumbent’s supporters disagree, then
it will soon be your turn to lead. Divide and conquer is a terrific
principle for coming to power in a democracy—and one of the greatest
practitioners of this strategy was Abraham Lincoln, who propelled
himself to the US presidency by splitting the support for the Democratic
Party in 1860.</p>
<p>During the 1858 US Senate race in Illinois, Republican Abraham
Lincoln forced Democrat Stephen Douglas to declare his position on
slavery just one year after the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision made
clear that Congress did not have the right to ban slavery in federal
territories. Douglas was cornered. If he said that slavery could be
banned, he would win the election in Illinois but he would shake the
foundations of his party; if he said that it couldn’t, he would lose the
election and thereby diminish his chances of being the Democrats’
presidential nominee in 1860. Douglas declared that the people could
exclude slavery and won the race, of course, but his response on slavery
came at the expense of dividing the Democratic Party two years later in
the 1860 presidential election, clearing the way for Lincoln’s coalition
to elect him president despite a very poor showing in popular votes.</p>
<p>Lincoln, more than any other winner of the presidency, foresaw that
he would not be popular among a vast segment of voters in the
presidential election. He understood that his best chance, maybe even
his only chance, for election in 1860 lay in dividing and conquering.
Had Douglas answered Lincoln’s question with a pro-slavery response
(that is, in support of the Dred Scott decision as the law of the land),
he almost certainly would have lost the Senate race to Lincoln. That
might have kept the Democrats united in 1860, but it would have boosted
Lincoln’s prospects for the presidency as the Senate incumbent with a
popular following. By answering as he did, Douglas guaranteed that his
own party would divide over his presidential bid. With southerners John
C. Breckinridge and John Bell also contesting the presidency, Douglas
lost his opportunity to win the southern vote, dooming him—and his
Democratic rivals—to defeat, even though Lincoln’s vote total was slim.
Lincoln beat the divided Democrats with less than 40 percent of the
popular vote and almost no votes in the South. Similarly, in 1992 Bill
Clinton beat the incumbent president George H. W. Bush with 43 percent
of the popular vote compared to Bush’s 38 percent, thanks in no small
measure to the run by H. Ross Perot (who got 19 percent of the vote).14
Lincoln understood that he needed to keep the coalition as small as
possible—even in a system with an inherently large coalition.</p>
<p>Lincoln did not lose sight of this important principle as he sought
reelection in 1864. Seeing that his prospects were not great, he
maneuvered to expand the set of interchangeables and influentials so
that he could forge a winning coalition out of those who had previously
had no say at all. How did he do this? He introduced absentee ballots so
that soldiers could vote, which had an especially important impact in
New York. It is widely believed that the votes of soldiers carried the
state for Lincoln in his 1864 race against General George B. McClellan.
Lincoln was a master at using the rules of politics to his advantage,
winning while being unpopular with a large swath of the American
people.</p>
<p>In democracies, politics is an arms race of ideas. Just as the
democrat has to be responsive to the people when governing, when seeking
office it helps to propose policies that the voters like, and it pays to
want to do more (as opposed to less)—even if the economic consequences
are damaging down the road (when you’re no longer in office). Satisfy
the coalition in the short run. When democratic politicians lament
“mortgaging our children’s future,” they’re really regretting that it
was not they who came up with the popular policy that voters actually
want. Sure, voters might feel guilty about the latest trillion program,
but see if they actually vote to reject it. With parents like that, what
children need enemies?</p>
<p>A LAST WORD ON COMING TO POWER: THE ULTIMATE FATE OF SERGEANT DOE</p>
<p>Our account of coming to power began with the story of Liberia’s
Sergeant Doe. His end provides a useful cautionary tale for those
seeking power. Coming to power and staying in power, as the rest of this
book makes clear, are very different things.</p>
<p>Sergeant Doe knew where Liberia’s money was. And so long as he knew
where it was and used it to keep the army faithful, he was able to
survive numerous attempts to overthrow him. The trouble is that you only
have to lose once, and the question Where’s the money? ended up being
the last thing that Sergeant Doe ever heard.</p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, the United States no longer needed
Doe’s assistance, and in 1989 the US government cut off his aid. Rivals
Charles Taylor and Prince Johnson, backed by the governments of Burkina
Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, saw their opportunity and launched an
insurgency. Doe sent soldiers to counter them, but rather than act as a
professional army ought to, his soldiers proceeded to rape, pillage, and
murder, not exactly endearing themselves to the very people whose
support might have saved Doe.</p>
<p>Civilians flocked to join the revolt. Showing his characteristic lack
of statesmanship or judgment, Doe decided to take a car and personally
go off in search of recently arrived Nigerian peacekeepers. Following a
gun battle that killed all of Doe’s entourage, Prince Johnson captured
the president and videotaped his subsequent interrogation. The
interrogators repeated the same questions over and over again before
Johnson turned to cutting off Doe’s ear and eating it: “Where is the
money? What is the bank account number?” Doe didn’t answer. Maybe,
knowing he was going to die regardless, he figured that if he kept
silent at least his family could enjoy the fruits of his labor and live
out their lives in a comfortable exile.</p>
<p>Doe was incompetent at running a country. He drove an already-poor
nation into even deeper poverty and civil war. But he knew the essence
of coming to power. Although dressed up in many forms, basic principles
are followed by all successful challengers. They offer greater rewards
to the essential supporters of the current leader than those essentials
currently receive. Unfortunately for the challenger, the incumbent has a
significant advantage because the members of the established winning
coalition can be confident that their leader will keep on lining their
pockets or providing the public policies they want. But if the incumbent
is believed to be dying, takes too much for himself, chooses the wrong
policies, or is seen to have only weak loyalty from his critical
backers, then the door swings wide open for a challenger to step in and
depose the incumbent.</p>
<p>To achieve power means recognizing the moment of opportunity and
moving fast and decisively to seize the day. And, for good measure,
coming to power also means seizing any opponents, figuratively in
democracies and physically in dictatorships. Coming to power is not for
the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Politics, however, does not end with becoming a leader. Even as you
take up the reins of power and enjoy its rewards, others are gunning for
you. They want the same job that you so desperately sought! Politics is
a risky business. As we will see, successful leaders manage these risks
by locking in a loyal coalition. Those who fail at this first task open
the door for someone else to overthrow them.</p>
