<h4 id="chapter-eleven-what-is-to-be-done">CHAPTER ELEVEN WHAT IS TO BE
DONE?</h4>
<p>A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and
the real reason.</p>
<p>—J. P. MORGAN</p>
<p>In late 1901, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin wrote a revolutionary essay
called “What Is to Be Done?” His question was directed at justifying the
creation of the Communist Party as the vanguard of the people. We are
more interested in his literal question than in his reason for asking
it, and, equally, we are intrigued by his unintended answer three years
later (really in a different context, but nevertheless apt) in the title
to another essay: “One Step Forward, Two Steps Back.” Too often, the
real world of politics and business responds to problems by taking one
step forward and two steps back, resulting in no progress on the problem
at hand. Backsliding is, and should be, the way leaders deal with
problems. It is the existing rules that have allowed them to seize and
control resources to date. A headlong plunge into new ways of conducting
politics might only heighten a leader’s risk of being overthrown.</p>
<p>After the past ten chapters, nine of which provide an exceedingly
cynical—but, we fear, accurate—portrayal of most politics, while Chapter
10 gives us reason to be hopeful for democracy’s future, it is time at
last to more seriously confront Lenin’s first question: What is to be
done? We hope that, informed by the lessons of leadership, we can offer
a much better and more democratic answer than he provided.</p>
<p>It is an understatement to say that making the world better is a
difficult task. If it were not, then it would already have been
improved. The misery in which so many live would already have been
overcome. The enrichment of CEOs while their stockholders lose their
shirts would be a thing of the past. However, the inherent problem with
change is that improving life for one group generally means making at
least one other person worse off, and that other person is likely to be
a leader if change really will solve the people’s problems. If the
individual harmed by change is the ruler or the CEO—the same person who
has to initiate or implement the changes in the first place—then we can
be confident that change is never going to happen.</p>
<p>From the beginning we said we would focus on what is rather than what
ought to be. Now we need to talk a bit about what ought to be. In doing
so, we want to lay down the ground rules. First among these is that we
should never let the quest for perfection block the way to lesser
improvement. Utopian dreams of a perfect world are just that: utopian.
Pursuing the perfect world for everyone is a waste of time and an excuse
for not doing the hard work of making the world better for many.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make the world great for everyone. Everyone
doesn’t want the same things. Think about what is good for
interchangeables, influentials, and essentials, the three dimensions of
political life: hardly ever is it true that what is good for leaders and
their essential backers is good for everyone else. If everyone had the
same wants, there wouldn’t be misery in the world. So, even as we are
trying to change the world for the better, we are tied to the dictates
of political reality. A fix is not a fix unless it can actually be done!
What can be done must satisfy the needs of everyone required to
implement change. Wishful thinking is not a fix, and a perfect solution
is not our goal and should not be any well-intentioned person’s goal.
Even minor improvements in governance can result in significant
improvements in the welfare of potentially millions of people or
shareholders.</p>
<p>RULES TO FIX BY</p>
<p>Whether we are looking at the welfare of shareholders in publicly
traded corporations, the quality of life for citizens in a democracy, or
the conditions under which billions live in oppressive and impoverished
underdeveloped countries, there are certain common principles behind
bettering the world. These commonalities need to be laid bare before we
tackle the specifics of fixing particular problems in particular
places.</p>
<p>If we have learned anything in the preceding pages, it is to be
suspicious of people’s motives. Appeals to ideological principles and
rights are generally a cover. J. P. Morgan had it right: there is always
some principled way to defend any position, especially one’s own
interests. In one overseas nation, our government supports protest and
advocates the will of the people to determine their own future. That is
a popular refrain for leaders in the United States when it comes to
places like Maduro’s Venezuela or Kim Jong-Un’s North Korea. Elsewhere
we call for stability. That’s the principle invoked when people try to
bring down a government that is our friend and ally, such as the
governments of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Both freedom and stability are
principled positions (the good reason) selectively asserted depending
upon how we like the incumbent (the real reason). In devising fixes to
the world’s ills, the essential first step is to understand what the
protagonists want and how different policies and changes will affect
their welfare. Reformers who take what people say at face value will
quickly find their reforms at a dead end.</p>
<p>Everyone has an interest in change, but interchangeables,
influentials, essentials, and leaders don’t often agree on what changes
they want. Leaders, given their druthers, would always like the set of
interchangeables to be very large and the groups of influentials and
essentials to be very small. That’s why the world of business has so
many massive corporations with millions of shareholders, a few
influential large owners, and a handful of essentials on the board of
directors who agree to pay CEOs handsomely regardless of how the company
fares. That’s why so much of humanity for so much of human history has
been governed by petty despots who steal from the poor to enrich the
rich.</p>
<p>The masses—whether members of the selectorate or the wholly
disenfranchised—agree that their group, the interchangeables, should be
large, but they want all other groups to be big as well. Their best
chance at having a better life comes from the coalition and the
influential group growing in size, such that they have a realistic
chance of becoming one of their members and of benefiting from the
profusion of public goods such governance provides, even if they remain
excluded from the coalition. As we have seen, it is this very hope of
improving the people’s lot that revolutionaries use as their rallying
cry to get them to take to the streets. But even in a large-coalition
system, these masses are unlikely to get what they want all the time.
Their hope is to get what they want more of the time.</p>
<p>The group whose desires are most interesting from the perspective of
lasting betterment is the set of essentials. We’ve seen a lot about how
their welfare changes when the selectorate is held constant while the
coalition is made bigger or smaller. But what happens when the
selectorate isn’t held to a fixed size? What happens when it is allowed
to get bigger—enfranchising more people—or get smaller—disenfranchising
more people? Leaders and their essentials share a preference for
dependence upon a small coalition, but leaders want the selectorate to
be as big as possible while the coalition prefers to keep their
substitute group as small as possible. The welfare of essentials is
enhanced if there are relatively few replacements for them. The
incumbent cannot use the implicit threat of replacing them with a
cheaper backer as a way to keep more benefits for himself rather than
paying his essentials their due. This creates tension between a leader
and his coalition. The leader would like to establish a Leninist-style,
corrupt, rigged electoral system that guarantees him an eager supply of
replacement supporters. The coalition prefers monarchical, theocratic,
or junta-style institutional arrangements that restrict those who can be
brought into the coalition to a select group of aristocrats, clerics, or
military elites. Think how terrific the Iranian regime is if you happen
to be an ayatollah. You have great power, lots of money, and few
substitutes waiting in the wings to take your job.</p>
<p>The essential facts of political life are that people do what is best
for them. Thus, except under extreme duress, leaders don’t expand the
coalition; the masses press for democratization; and essential
supporters vary in what they want. This latter group can be made better
off by contractions in the number of coalition members through coups and
purges—provided they are the ones retained. Democratization can also
make them better off. It is therefore this group that offers the
greatest prospect for constructive as well as destructive change. With
them lies the possibility of both one step forward and two steps back.
The prospect of being dropped from the coalition encourages its members
to take the single step forward rather than risk becoming a casualty of
the two steps back. Times and circumstances that heighten the risk of
coalition turnover engender an appreciation of democracy among political
insiders.</p>
<p>Members of a small coalition live in luxury but also in constant
fear: make the coalition smaller, as their leader wants, and they may be
out; make the coalition bigger and their special privileges diminish.
But decreased privileges are much better than the danger of being out
altogether. So there are two times when the coalition is most receptive
to the urge to improve life for the many, whether those are the people
or shareholders: when a leader has just come to power, and when a leader
is so old or decrepit that he won’t last much longer. In these
circumstances, coalition members cannot count on being retained, and so
they are open to changes that can make most of society better off. It is
at the beginning and the end of an incumbent’s reign that the danger of
being purged is greatest, and so, at these times, coalition members
should be most receptive to reform. Effective reform means expanding the
coalition, and that means that everyone, including the current
essentials, has a good chance of being needed by tomorrow’s new
leader.</p>
<p>Not only is there a good time to look for the opportunity for reform;
there also are good circumstances when reforms that can improve the
people’s welfare are welcomed. Coalitions whose leaders face serious
economic strains understand that their days of luxury and splendor are
numbered. That is one of the reasons companies sometimes commit fraud:
CEOs, senior management, and board members believe they will be ousted
because of the firm’s failure, so they cover up how poorly the business
is doing while they try to fix it and save themselves. Little white lies
work well the first year, but if things do not turn around, then each
year they need to lie a little bit more, until their reports are
outright fiction and legally fraudulent.</p>
<p>As we have learned, when a country’s economy is in trouble the big
problem from a ruler’s perspective is that she doesn’t have enough money
to buy continued loyalty. When the privileges enjoyed by essentials are
shrinking, they are likely to be tuned in to the possibility of change.
They know the leader will want to purge people so she can use what
little money is around more effectively. They, not wanting to be purged,
will be amenable to expanding their group, trading their privilege for
their future security and well-being. Coalition members are not the only
ones willing to contemplate changing the rules when circumstances
warrant. If the economic crisis is severe enough (and foreign aid donors
stay away), then even leaders must ponder whether they might be better
off liberalizing, just as J.J. Rawlings did in Ghana. Democratization
jeopardizes their long-term future, but if they don’t pay their
supporters today, whether they can win an election tomorrow is not a
salient consideration.</p>
<p>Fools don’t often get to rule countries or companies. Pretty much any
leader worth his salt can see the dangers he faces when economic
circumstances leave him bereft of funds to buy loyalty. Under such
circumstances even leaders can believe that reform is their best shot at
political survival. They might look for a fix even before their
coalition does. Consider the experience of Chiang Kai-shek, who
certainly was no fool. He was China’s leader from 1928 until his defeat
by Mao Zedong’s forces in 1949 and then became the leader of the
Republic of China on Taiwan from 1949 until his death in 1975. We might
well ask why he encouraged much more successful economic policies on
Taiwan than on the mainland of China. In the latter, even with extensive
poverty, because there were so many people, there was plenty to enrich
himself and his coalition. But when Chiang Kai-shek and his backers
retreated to Taiwan, they took over an island with relatively few people
and hardly any resources. Only economic success could provide the way to
reward his coalition. In the process of achieving that success, he also
gradually expanded the coalition, perhaps in response to pressure from
his essential cronies or perhaps under pressure from the United States,
until at the end of his life, Taiwan began a serious move toward
becoming the democracy that it is today.</p>
<p>When the time or circumstances are ripe for change, coalition members
must recognize that if they do not pressure for an expansion of public
goods and public welfare, then others will. Provided that the chances of
success are good enough and the expected gains from success outstrip the
costs involved in gambling on a revolt, an intransigent coalition and
leadership will find itself besieged by an uprising. In this
circumstance, such as was seen in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and elsewhere
in the Middle East and North Africa, and as we saw in the proxy fight at
Hewlett-Packard over Carly Fiorina’s decision to merge with Compaq,
people are willing to take big risks to improve their lot. They do so to
call for exactly the same change as is widely favored by smart coalition
members when and if any change becomes necessary.</p>
<p>A wise coalition, therefore, works together with the masses to foster
an expanded coalition. The people cooperate because it will mean more
public goods for them, and the coalition cooperates because it will mean
less risk that they will end up out on their ear. Egypt’s military
leaders, essential members of the Mubarak government, understood this
choice very well in the early months of 2011. They ensured their
continued place as important players in Egypt’s future by cooperating
with the mass movement and supporting an expanded coalition rather than
hunkering down and risking losing everything—or at least, they did so
until the time was ripe for them to seize control.</p>
<p>What are the lessons here for change? First, coalition members should
beware of their susceptibility to purges. Remember that it ticks up when
there is a new boss, a dying boss, or a bankrupt boss. At such times,
the essential group should begin to press for its own expansion to
create the incentives to develop public-spirited policies, democracy,
and benefits for all. Purges can still succeed if they can be mounted
surreptitiously, so wise coalition members who are not absolutely close
to the seat of power would do well to insist on a free press, free
speech, and freedom of assembly to protect themselves from unanticipated
upheaval. And should they be unlucky enough to be replaced, at least
they will have cushioned themselves for a soft landing. Outsiders would
be wise to take cues from the same lessons: the time for outside
intervention to facilitate democratic change or improved corporate
responsibility is when a leader has just come to power or when a leader
is near the end of his life.</p>
<p>Knowing what people want and the conditions under which they will
oppose reform and the circumstances under which the swing coalition
members will support reform, we can now turn to concrete ideas about
fixing, at least partially, the worlds of business and governance.</p>
<p>LESSONS FROM GREEN BAY</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers, a football team based in the cold climes of
Wisconsin, are remarkable for the loyalty their fans show them. In fact,
win or lose, Packer fans are nearly always satisfied. Virtually every
one of their home games since 1960 has been sold out. Attendance
averages 98.9 percent despite often-appalling weather. The Packers have
one of the longest waiting lists for season tickets among professional
football teams.1 Despite being a small-market team (Green Bay is a city
of only about one hundred thousand), they have been very successful.
They have won twelve championships, the most in the NFL; they rank fifth
in terms of Super Bowl appearances and victories, appearing five times
and winning four times.2 They attract a larger, more loyal fan base than
teams from many much-larger cities. Their successes on the field and in
terms of fan loyalty stem from their institutional structure.</p>
<p>The Packers are the only nonprofit, community-owned franchise in
American major league professional sports. Their 361,311 shareholders
are mainly local fans. The ownership rules preclude a small clique
taking control of the team. No one is allowed to own more than two
hundred thousand shares in the Packers out of more than five million
shares outstanding. The board has forty-five members.3 Thus, a tiny band
of owners cannot easily overturn the many and run the team for their
personal gain at the expense of the larger, small-owners fan base. The
Packers were grandfathered into the NFL. NFL rules for the other
thirty-one teams state that they cannot have more than thirty owners and
that one of these owners must own at least 30 percent of the team. The
Packers might not be maximizing revenue for their owners (the Packers
pay no dividends to their shareholders), but their fans are happy.</p>
<p>Indeed, they have good reasons to be happy. The two most recent stock
offerings, in 1997 and 2011, increased the number of shares and
shareholders. And the stock offerings were each followed by a
statistically significant increase in on-field success. The winning
percentage improved by more than 10 percent and the team’s seasonal
point spread went up over sixty points.</p>
<p>The concern for fan welfare is not commonplace in sports, although
every team says they care. Recently European football (a.k.a. soccer)
witnessed the tension created by the competing interests of fans and
owners. In April 2021, twelve top football clubs (well, really eleven
and Arsenal) announced the formation of a European Super League. In
contrast to other (more meritocratic) European competitions for which
clubs qualify by performing well in their domestic competition, the
Super League planned to restrict entry. The plan envisioned huge
revenues, €10 billion according to press releases.4 Good for the owners,
but probably not good for football. Even the loyal fans of these clubs
appeared to prefer open competition where the top clubs are defined by
performance, not by restricting competition. Their vociferous protests
led to the league being abandoned after a few days. At several of the
clubs involved, protests against team owners continued until the idea of
the Super League was abandoned. For instance, on May 2, 2021, a
much-anticipated game at Manchester United was postponed because fans,
many of them wearing the original colors of the club from when it was
community owned, invaded the stadium. The Manchester United Supporters’
Trust, a fan organization, called for dramatic changes in the club’s
ownership structure: “What happened was the culmination of 16 years in
which your family’s ownership of the club has driven us into debt and
decline, and we have felt ever more sidelined and ignored.”5 The
complaints of the Manchester fans point to a trend in which many top
clubs have been bought by wealthy individuals such as Russian oligarchs,
Emirati royalty, and other billionaires. The fans would prefer that
clubs enhance the supporters’ experience, just as the Green Bay Packers
do. But such a public-goods focus is incompatible with the revenue focus
of a small group of owners.</p>
<p>The lesson to be extracted from the Green Bay Packers compared to the
Super League is that if firms can be made to rely on a bigger coalition,
they are likely to do a better job of serving the interests of their
selectorate. But how can corporate governance be turned on its head to
make this happen?</p>
<p>Consider what the main difficulties are for shareholders. They suffer
from two big problems: First, in big corporations there tend to be
millions of little shareholders, a handful of big, institutional
shareholders, and a bunch of insider owners. The millions of little
shareholders might as well not exist. They are not organized, and the
cost for any of them to organize the mass of owners just isn’t worth it.
Second, the flow of information about the firm’s performance comes from
pretty much only two sources: the firm itself and the financial media.
Few owners read annual reports or SEC filings, and the financial media
doesn’t spend much time reporting on any one firm unless it is in huge
trouble. By then it is usually too late for the shareholders to save the
day.</p>
<p>We live in the age of networking. Much of the world, including owners
of shares, tweet on Twitter and chat with friends on Facebook; they are
on LinkedIn; they can easily communicate with one another, even if they
don’t always do so. Surely it would be relatively simple to design
firm-specific Facebook pages or other networking sites.</p>
<p>Companies maintain lively websites to put their view across, but few
entrepreneur-owners have stepped forward to do the same to help organize
the mass of little owners and to provide a way for them to share views.
Sure, there are bloggers writing about anything and everything, but
there don’t seem to be many shareholder-controlled sites where they can
exchange thoughts and ideas about a company that participants own in
common. If something like this existed, the size of the influential,
informed voters in any corporation would go way up. Then, for the first
time, boards would really be elected by their owners, and then the
board, like any leadership group, would need to be responsive to their
large coalition of constituents. A simple change that exploits the
internet to be a conduit for increasing coalition size can turn the
Apples, Amazons, Bank of Americas, Twitters, and Teslas of the world
into big-coalition regimes that serve their millions of small owners
instead of a handful of senior managers.</p>
<p>Ah, you are thinking, senior management can thwart such efforts. They
will, as they already do, hold shareholder meetings in places most
owners can’t afford to go, or the meetings will be so brief that it will
be impossible for dissidents to express their views (the preferred
shareholder meeting strategy in Japan), and, after all, proxies pour in,
turning millions of votes over to a handful of board members. None of
that, of course, will stop shareholder control once the millions of
little owners have a cheap and easy way to exchange information. Set up
a shareholder social media platform and then they will set the rules—by
majority vote—for who casts proxies. They can set some of their own up
to represent competing parties, and they can make the annual
shareholders’ meeting a purely decorative event. All such skeptics
should remember that social networking websites have already
successfully mobilized revolutions and brought down governments.
Changing corporate governance is far easier.</p>
<p>Corporations don’t have armies that can go out and bash in the heads
of dissidents. Pursue a course of connecting and informing shareholders,
and we will see whether shareholders who limit CEO salaries do better or
worse; whether firms that alter behavior to meet the social expectations
of their shareholders do better or worse; and whether shareholders care
more about employees or about themselves. Whatever the millions of
little owners decide to do, they will be responsible for their own fate.
Management will serve them just as democratic leaders are more
constrained than autocrats to do what their citizens want.</p>
<p>We also ought to comment a bit on how not to improve corporate
governance. In the wake of Enron’s collapse and other big frauds,
Congress decided to regulate corporate governance, ostensibly to make it
better. By now every reader knows that the interest of government
leaders is not in making shareholders or even the man or woman on the
street better off. Their interest is in making themselves better off.
The regulations they imposed on corporate governance may have played
well with voters, many of whom had little stake in many of the companies
that were harmed by the regulations, but they have not made corporate
governance better. The Sarbanes-Oxley Bill, passed in 2002, was supposed
to tamp down management’s greed and make companies responsive to their
shareholders’ interest in equity growth. The trouble is, it didn’t work.
There have been loads of big corporate frauds after Sarbanes-Oxley just
as there were before. Just think of such big frauds as Volkswagen in
2015, Wells Fargo in 2016, Theranos in 2017, Wirecard in 2020. And this
is only a brief list. Don’t take our word for it.</p>
<p>Study after study shows that Sarbanes-Oxley did not do its job. In a
brilliant summary of the statistical assessments of each of the
governance planks in Sarbanes-Oxley, Yale law professor Roberto Romano
shows that Sarbanes-Oxley did not do what it was supposed to do and
often made things worse. Even a seemingly obvious reform—requiring an
independent audit committee—turns out not to have been beneficial.
Costly, yes! But it did not improve corporate governance or performance.
Romano goes on to document the failings of Congress and regulators to
get it right.6 The wishes of a large coalition of shareholders with a
big stake in finding the right answers to any given corporation’s
problems is likely to make businesses work better. A coalition of
government regulators bent on improving their own electoral prospects is
not.</p>
<p>FIXING DEMOCRACIES</p>
<p>For the citizens of democracies, life is good. But good does not
preclude better. Our approach depends on the subtle organizational
differences in the size of the three political dimensions on which we
focus. For convenience, these distinctions are often dropped, but even
small differences matter. It is time, then, to confront those small
differences head on and see how good can be made better.</p>
<p>At the time of its independence, the United States was composed of
thirteen states. They all had broadly the same first-past-the-post
electoral rules, and yet their records of performance were remarkably
different. It is easy to be sloppy and think that they all had the same
political system—governed by the United States Constitution—so that
their differences must have come from somewhere else. In reality,
however, their political systems were not the same. The Constitution is
silent on many issues that are central to governance. The Constitution
tells us nothing, for instance, about how to add up votes. As we saw,
just by changing this simple rule, Harvey Milk could change American
politics by getting elected to San Francisco’s board of supervisors in
1977, even though he could not do so in 1975 with ten times more votes
than in 1977. Seemingly small differences in enfranchisement rules and
districting decisions led to big disparities in the economic (and
social) development of the states of the United States.</p>
<p>On average, the northern states developed more rapidly than the
southern states. It is tempting to ascribe this to the traditional
historical narratives and attribute the general difference to climate or
slavery. However, a careful examination of the subtle differences
between the states suggests that variations in their political
institutions were the main culprit behind how they developed. Jeffrey
Jensen, a former student of ours and now a faculty member at NYU, Abu
Dhabi, did a very careful study of the differences in the size of the
interchangeables, influentials, and essential groups across the original
states.7 He understood that many thought the differences in development
depended on slavery and climate, and so he corrected for these
possibilities. Jeff took the size of the enslaved population carefully
into account, just as he also took carefully into account how many
frost-free days there were per year in each of the original thirteen
states. He investigated the distinctions in electoral rules within the
early American states that created different levels of dependency on a
large or small coalition drawn from a large or small set of
interchangeables. His discoveries help us understand how to make our own
modern democracy do better.</p>
<p>Who could vote differed greatly from place to place in the early
United States. Some states imposed substantial property or educational
qualifications for voting, while others did not. Electoral districts
were typically based upon county lines. Many of these inadequately
reflected the population distribution, so in some legislative districts
it took vastly more votes to win a seat than in others. The modern
principle of one person, one vote was not yet the acknowledged law of
the land.</p>
<p>The upshot of these differences was that state political leaders were
accountable to greatly different numbers of voters—that is,
interchangeables and essentials. Through painstaking research, Jeff
Jensen estimated the proportion of the states’ populations that
constituted the minimal winning coalition across states and across the
years. It turns out that the size of the group of essentials varied
enormously from a low of 8.8 percent of adult white males (and 0.9
percent of the total population) in South Carolina to a high of 23.9
percent of adult white males (and 4.9 percent of the total population)
in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As the rules to rule by lead us to expect, states in which leaders
required support from a larger proportion of the population developed
faster. Such states built more extensive canal, rail, and road networks.
They also achieved higher educational attainment and were more
attractive places for other Americans to migrate into. People left
small-coalition states and flocked to big-coalition states where public
services were better and all manner of public goods were more
extensively provided. Foreign immigrants also flocked to the
larger-coalition states, even after correcting for proximity to large
ports. Per capita incomes were much higher and varied almost directly
with coalition size even after correcting for pre-independence
differences. States with bigger coalitions simply did better.</p>
<p>The sorts of variations in performance that Jeff demonstrated for the
original US states can be seen everywhere throughout history. In a
recent study of Europe’s economic and political development, for
example, one of us has shown that there was greater economic growth and
greater political accountability—through the formation of meaningful
parliaments—where winning coalitions were larger in the Middle Ages than
where they were smaller. Many of today’s economic and political
differences in Europe can be traced back to these early roots. Even the
corruption or religiosity of medieval popes can be traced back to the
size of their winning coalition.8 The lesson here is clear. Make the
coalition bigger and things will get better. One way to make coalitions
bigger in the United States is to provide a meaningful alternative to
gerrymandering in which voters pick their representatives instead of
representatives picking their voters. When politicians pick who votes
for them, it comes as no surprise that politicians are easily reelected
and barely held accountable. Fixing gerrymandering is something that can
be done only once a decade in the United States. It can be done more
frequently in many parliamentary democracies that equally suffer from
this perversion of representative politics. Whether the opportunity is
ongoing or infrequent, fixing gerrymandering is conceptually, if not
politically, easy, but to make it feasible the voters must take up the
cause and fight for it.</p>
<p>Many scholars of American politics have worked out lots of better
ways to allocate congressional districts than the way it is done now.
All the methods come down to variations on a common theme: district
boundaries should not be manipulated to squeeze some voters in here and
others out there. Boundaries should reflect some basic principles of
geometry and the natural constraints of the terrain, like major rivers
or mountains. As a simple principle, gerrymandering could be greatly
diminished by turning redistricting over to some computer programmers
and mathematical political scientists, who could design rules that are
not district specific and not partisan but that instead apply common
principles of fair representation across all districts.</p>
<p>A successful voter initiative in Michigan in 2018 has taken a step in
this direction. It calls for the appointment of a nonpartisan commission
to handle redistricting. We will see how well that does at being
nonpartisan. A computer program drawn up in ignorance of any specific
district’s distribution of political preferences would be much more
likely to achieve fairness and impartiality while fulfilling the spirit
as well as the letter of the Supreme Court’s insistence on one person,
one vote. With the right, nonpartisan computer program, the principle of
one person, one vote would apply equally to the size of each district’s
selectorate and winning coalition, thereby correcting the current
deficiency in how one person, one vote is implemented.</p>
<p>Along with wiping out coalition-reducing gerrymanders, the time may
well have come to rethink the Electoral College. Here we have an
institution whose founders’ original intent is pretty clear. They wanted
to ensure that the states where slavery was legal would join the United
States, and that meant erecting constitutional provisions that would
protect slavery.9 The Electoral College was one of those institutions.
Here is a great example where original intent most assuredly should not
guide modern-day politics. Slavery has been outlawed for well over 150
years and yet the Electoral College persists, and the primary reason for
its survival, even if it’s rarely spoken out loud, is that it allows
politicians to construct a coalition of essential supporters that is
substantially smaller than would be the case under direct election.</p>
<p>There are at least two ways to fix the problems created by the
Electoral College: amend the Constitution to get rid of it or pursue
further the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC). Amending
the Constitution is extremely hard. That’s why it has been amended so
infrequently. There are lots of low-population states whose leaders are
not keen to give up their outsize influence over the selection of the
president of the United States. Amending the Constitution requires
approval by three-fourths of the states. That leaves lots of room for
low-population states to quash any amendment.</p>
<p>The NPVIC alternative to amending the Constitution has so far
garnered the support from fifteen states. Each of these states voted
Democratic in the 2020 presidential election. Each of these states says
it is committed to casting its electoral votes—a total of 196—to
whichever presidential candidate wins the national popular vote. If this
compact were implemented by states with a total of at least 270
electoral votes, then it would assure that no one would be elected
president, as George W. Bush was in 2000 and Donald Trump was in 2016,
while losing the popular vote. Also, under this compact, each voter’s
vote would count enough that candidates would be interested in each and
every one of them. But there’s not much hope of lower-population states
joining the compact if they benefit from going against the national
popular vote. That’s why, presumably, no Republican states have signed
on.</p>
<p>Immigration policy is a hot topic of debate in the United States and
across much of democratic Europe. The reason for the debate is pretty
much the same whether it is taking place in Phoenix or Paris, Shropshire
or San Francisco. Immigration policies come in three flavors. In one,
immigrants have an easy time becoming citizens in their new homeland. In
another, immigrants are welcomed as guest workers but cannot gain
citizenship. And in the third, immigrants just aren’t welcomed. It turns
out that which immigration flavor is chosen has big effects on the size
of the groups that dictate whether a government, in governing for
itself, also governs for the people.</p>
<p>Immigrants without citizenship opportunities increase the size of a
country’s disenfranchised group. As such, they are, barring open
rebellion (which is rare among poor immigrants), an impotent source of
demand for public goods. They are not in the interchangeable selectorate
and they cannot become influentials or essentials. Guest worker
immigration policies put immigrants in exactly this boat. The monarchies
of the Middle East love this sort of immigration because it doesn’t
interfere with the control of the few over the many, and if any
immigrant misbehaves he or she can just be deported.</p>
<p>We see a similar pattern of constraints that keep immigrants from
having a shot at being in a winning coalition in some democracies as
well. Gaining citizenship rights is extremely difficult in Japan, for
instance. Although over the centuries there have been many waves of
immigration to Japan (from, for instance, North Korea), the limits on
access to citizenship ensures that immigrants do not compel an expansion
of the winning coalition.</p>
<p>In places like Great Britain, immigrants from commonwealth countries
like India or Pakistan who successfully enter the country can vote. This
means that they are quickly made part of the selectorate. Because the
size of the winning coalition in democracies is tied, at least
indirectly, to how many people can vote, this also means that
immigration expands the coalition. Naturally many politicians will be
unhappy about this because it diminishes their control over
discretionary money. Current citizens may also be unhappy, especially if
they back the party in power. Expanding the coalition reduces the value
of their private rewards. But for farsighted members of a current
winning coalition in a democracy and for the many citizens who voted for
the losing party, increased immigration combined with easy access to
citizenship means increased pressure on the government to produce more
public goods. That’s good for just about everyone and especially for
those not in the coalition of essentials.</p>
<p>Expanding immigrant access and rights, then, can boost the required
size of the winning coalition and, in the process, improve the quality
of public policy. But with so many interests aligned against immigration
because of its short-term costs, it is hard to change immigration rules.
Or is it?</p>
<p>A simple fix that lifts everyone’s longer-term welfare is to
grandfather in immigrants. Amnesty for illegal immigrants—a dirty word
in American political circles—is a mechanism for choosing selectively
those who demonstrate over a fixed period their ability to help produce
revenue by working, paying taxes, and raising children who contribute to
the national economy, national political life, and national social
fabric. Give us your poor and let’s see if they can make a better life.
Give us your tired and let’s see if they can be energized by
participating in making a more public goods–oriented government work
better. Give us your huddled masses longing to be free and let’s see if
their children’s children don’t grow up to be the foundation of a
stronger, more peaceful, and more prosperous society than they first
came to. For generation after generation, the waves of immigrants to the
United States have made our winning coalitions bigger and better. They
have turned from poor, tired, huddled masses into modern America’s
success story. This was no happenstance of time or place. This was the
straightforward consequence of easy citizenship and, with it, an
expanded winning coalition that makes for better governance.</p>
<p>REMOVING MISERY</p>
<p>Beneficial change in the underdeveloped world is among the most
difficult challenges to overcome. Rampant poverty, frequent exposure to
the resource curse, and long-entrenched autocratic regimes all stand in
the way. But change can and does happen, as the stories of South Africa,
Tunisia, Taiwan, and Mexico demonstrate. When change does happen, it can
come from two sources, internal political upheaval or external threat,
and between these two, external threat is far less likely to succeed in
making many better off at the expense of the few.</p>
<p>American presidents and European prime ministers have long advocated
a democratic world, and they might even claim some qualified success—the
world is much more democratic today than it was fifty years ago. But it
is not likely that our cries for freedom in the world—rarely backed up
by effective efforts—turned many dictators into freedom lovers. As
countries as diverse as Ghana, Armenia, Vietnam, and Mongolia
demonstrate, effective change comes mostly from local circumstances.
Each of these countries has meaningfully increased their winning
coalition size and their economic growth rate. We don’t think that the
correlation between growth and essentials is coincidental; we have made
the case that growth follows political reform, sometimes more quickly,
sometimes more slowly, but practically inevitably. In contrast, after
nearly two decades, the US government has spent trillions of dollars on
combat and nation building in Afghanistan.10 The resulting governments
remained largely isolated from the need to improve the welfare of the
people. External democratization and external drivers for economic
growth rarely succeed, as we highlighted in Chapter 7. We don’t mean to
say that external influence can never be used effectively because it
certainly can, but not in the conventional ways of armed intervention or
foreign aid. What outsiders can do is to help provide soft landings for
dictators as a way to facilitate their accepting defeat. South Africa’s
Nelson Mandela taught the world an important lesson in this regard.
Alas, it is a lesson only poorly learned.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the apartheid government, Mandela organized
truth and reconciliation commissions. These were designed to provide
people who had oppressed the apartheid regime’s opponents the chance to
come forward, confess their crimes, and be granted amnesty. The United
Nations certainly could build a body of international law that motivates
dictators facing rebellion to turn power over to the people peacefully.
The UN could prescribe a process for transition from dictatorship to
democracy. At the same time it could stipulate that any dictator facing
the pressure to grant freedom to the people would have a brief, fixed
period of time, say a week, to leave the country in exchange for a
blanket perpetual grant of amnesty against prosecution anywhere for
crimes committed as his nation’s leader. There is clear precedence for
such a policy. It is common practice to give criminals reduced sentences
or immunity if they agree to testify against others, potentially then
deterring future misconduct. Some victims are bound to resent that the
perpetrator of heinous acts goes unpunished. Unfortunately, the
alternative is to leave the dictator with few options but to gamble on
holding onto power through further murderous acts. Certainly there is
little justice in letting former dictators off the hook. But the goal
should be to preserve and improve the lives of the many who suffer at
the hands of desperate leaders who might be prepared to step aside in
exchange for immunity. Remember, we urged you not to let the quest for
perfection push aside feasible, practical ways of improving
governance.</p>
<p>The incentives to encourage leaders to step aside could be further
strengthened if, in exchange for agreeing to step down quickly, they
would be granted the right to retain some significant amount of
ill-gotten gains and safe havens for exile where the soon-to-be
ex-leadership and their families can live out their lives in peace.
Offering such deals might prove self-fulfilling. Once essential
supporters believe their leader might take such a deal, they themselves
start looking for his replacement, so even if the leader had wanted to
stay and fight, he might no longer have the support to do so. The urge
for retribution is better put aside to give dictators a reason to give
up rather than fight. Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi and Syria’s Bashar
al-Assad had none of these opportunities and so faced a stark choice:
cling to power whatever the human costs, live the life of the hunted, or
fight to the death. Qaddafi chose the last, to the detriment of the
Libyan people. Assad chose to impose limitless costs on his society to
cling to power, to the detriment of the Syrian people and much of the
region.</p>
<p>Additional choices can be provided. Britain’s transition from
monarchy to constitutional monarchy provides a valuable lesson. Leaders
want to survive in office and maximize their control over money. But
what if their choice is to trade the power of office for the right to
the money? The English monarchy once had both power and money, but it
faced severe pressure that could have ended, as in so many other places,
with the erstwhile royal family having neither power nor money. That is
what happened to the Russian and French royal families, and for that
matter the Stewart branch of the English royal family, in the wake of
revolution. Imagine, instead, that they had the option of keeping the
crown but turning power over to a properly elected government of the
people, as William and Mary and the subsequent Hanoverian dynasty did in
England. As compensation for doing so, they could have been granted the
right to keep the family’s wealth and even the assurance of further
income from the state for a long, specified period of time (say, one
hundred years). The transition to being fabulously wealthy figureheads
of constitutional monarchies is an option the Saudi Arabian royal
family, the Jordanian royal family, and the royal families of the
Emirates might well contemplate as a better option than trying to crush
future rebellion. Revolutionaries might fail today or tomorrow, but
leaders have only to lose once, and by then it will be too late for them
to negotiate their way to a soft landing.</p>
<p>FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS: FALSE HOPE</p>
<p>Just as there are actions that can promote beneficial change, there
are also actions that hamper progress. One of the most popular unhelpful
solutions is an election. Leaders at risk often decide to hold
fraudulent elections to create the impression of openness and fairness.
Needless to say, bogus elections don’t move a country toward better
policies or more freedom for the people. Rather, fake elections empower
the ruler by increasing the ranks of the interchangeables without adding
in any meaningful way to the size of the influential and essential
groups.</p>
<p>True, meaningful elections might be the final goal, but elections for
their own sake should never be the objective. When the international
community pushes for elections without being careful about how
meaningful they are, all it accomplishes is to further entrench a nasty
regime. International inspectors, for instance, like to certify whether
people could freely go to the polling place and whether their votes were
properly counted, as if that means there was a free and fair election.
There’s no reason to impede the opportunity to vote or to cheat when
counting votes if, for instance, a regime first bans parties that might
be real rivals, or if a government sets up campaign constraints that
make it easy for the government’s party to tell its story and make it
impossible for the opposition to do the same. Russian incumbents don’t
need to cheat in counting votes to get the outcome they want. They don’t
need to block people from getting into the polling place. They deprive
the opposition from having access to a free press and from holding
rallies, so, sure, observers will easily conclude that elections were
free and fair in the narrow sense, but we can all just as easily
recognize that they were neither really free nor fair.</p>
<p>Ultimately, elections need to follow expanded freedom and not be
thought of as presaging it!</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Sometimes the problems of the world seem beyond our capacity to
solve. Yet there is no mystery about how to eradicate much of the
world’s poverty and oppression. People who live with freedom are rarely
impoverished and oppressed. Give people the right to say what they want,
to write what they want, and to gather to share ideas about what they
want, and you are bound to be looking at people whose persons and
property are secure and whose lives are content. You are looking at
people free to become rich and free to lose their shirts in trying. You
are looking at people who are not only materially well off but
spiritually and physically, too. Sure, places like Singapore and parts
of China prove that it is possible to have a good material life with
limited freedom—yet the vast majority of the evidence suggests that
these are exceptions and not the rule. Economic success can postpone the
democratic moment, but it cannot replace it.</p>
<p>A country’s relative share of freedom is ultimately decided by its
leaders. Behind the world of misery and oppression lie governments run
by small cliques of essentials who are loyal to leaders who can make
them rich. Behind the world of freedom and prosperity lie governments
that depend on the backing of a substantial coalition of ordinary people
drawn from a large pool of influentials, who are in turn drawn from a
large pool of interchangeables. It is not difficult to draw a line from
the poverty and oppression of the world to the corrupt juntas and brutal
dictators who skim from their country’s revenues to stay in power.
Politics and political institutions define the bounds of the people’s
lives.</p>
<p>By now it should be clear that there is a natural order governing
politics, and it comes with an ironclad set of rules. They cannot be
altered. But that does not mean that we cannot find better paths to work
within the laws of politics.</p>
<p>We have suggested some ways to work within the rules to produce
better outcomes. At the end of the day, the solutions we have suggested
will not be applied perfectly. There are good reasons for that.
Entrenched ways of thinking make altering our approach to problems
difficult. Many will conclude that it is cruel and insensitive to cut
way back on foreign aid. They will tell us that all the money spent on
aid is worth it if just one child is helped. They will forget to ask how
many children are condemned to die of neglect because, in the process of
helping a few, aid props up leaders who look after the people only after
they have looked after themselves and their essential backers, if at
all. But before we shift blame onto our “flawed” democratic leaders for
their failures to make the world a better place, we need to remember why
it is that they enact the policies that they do. The sworn duty of
democratic leaders is to do precisely what we the people want.</p>
<p>Virtually since the nation’s founding, American presidents have
routinely endorsed the idea, if not the reality, of spreading democracy.
President Woodrow Wilson, in calling on Congress to declare war against
Germany on April 2, 1917, reflected his deeply held view that “the world
must be made safe for democracy.… We have no selfish ends to serve. We
desire no conquest, no dominion.” His sentiment was echoed nearly ninety
years later when George W. Bush, in his second inaugural address,
proclaimed, “The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on
the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.… So it is the policy
of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic
movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the
ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.” Yet Wilson set his noble
sentiments aside when it came to standing up for self-determination in
the colonies controlled by America’s allies. In the same spirit,
President Bush, during the same speech in which he called for democracy
“in all the world,” also noted: “My most solemn duty is to protect this
nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats.”</p>
<p>The president’s “solemn duty” highlights the problem. There is an
inherent tension between promoting democratic reform abroad and
protecting the welfare of the people at home. Free, democratic societies
typically live in peace with each other and promote prosperity at home
as well as between nations, making representative government attractive
to people throughout the world. Yet democratic reform, as the
experiences of the United States with Khomeini’s Iran and Hamas-led
Palestine make clear, does not always also enhance the security or
welfare of Americans (or citizens elsewhere in the world) against
foreign threats and may even jeopardize that security.</p>
<p>Our individual concerns about protecting ourselves from unfriendly
democracies elsewhere typically trump our longer-term belief in the
benefits of democracy. Democratic leaders listen to their voters because
that is how they and their political party get to keep their jobs.
Democratic leaders were elected, after all, to advance the current
interests of at least those who chose them. The long run is always on
someone else’s watch. Democracy overseas is a great thing for us if, and
only if, the people of a democratizing nation happen to want policies
that we like. When a foreign people are aligned against our best
interest, our best chance of getting what we want is to keep them under
the yoke of an oppressor who is willing to do what we the people
want.</p>
<p>Yes, we want people to be free and prosperous, but we don’t want them
to be free and prosperous enough to threaten our way of life, our
interests, and our well-being—and that is as it should be. That, too, is
a rule to rule by for democratic leaders. They must do what their
coalition wants; they are not beholden to the coalition in any other
country, just to those who help keep them in power. If we pretend
otherwise we will just be engaging in the sort of utopianism that serves
as an excuse for not tackling the problems that we can.</p>
<p>We began with Cassius imploring Brutus to act against Julius Caesar’s
despotism: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in
ourselves.” We humbly add that the reason the fault is in ourselves is
that we the people care so much for ourselves and so little for the
world’s underlings. But we have also seen that there is hope for the
future. Every government and every organization that relies on a small
coalition eventually erodes its own productivity and entrepreneurial
spirit so much that it faces the risk of collapsing under the weight of
its own corruption and inefficiency. When those crucial moments of
opportunity arise, when the weight of bad governance catches up with
despots, then a few simple changes can make all the difference.</p>
<p>We have learned that just about all of political life revolves around
the size of the selectorate, the influentials, and the winning
coalition. Expand them all, and the interchangeables no more quickly
than the coalition, and everything changes for the better for the vast
majority of people. They are liberated to work harder on their own
behalf, to become better educated, healthier, wealthier, happier, and
free. Their taxes are reduced and their opportunities in life expand
dramatically. We can get to these moments of change faster through some
of the fixes proposed here, but sooner or later every society will cross
over from small-coalition, large-selectorate misery to a large coalition
that is a large proportion of the selectorate—and peace and plenty will
ensue. With a little bit of hard work and good luck, this can happen
everywhere sooner, and if it does we all will prosper from it.</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>
<p>The Dictator’s Handbook is the culmination of more than two decades
of research into the motivation and constraints of leaders. We owe a
huge debt of gratitude to friends, colleagues, coauthors, and critics
who have helped sharpen our understanding of what makes the world tick
and given us insight into how it can be made to tick more smoothly.</p>
<p>In academic circles, our work has become known as selectorate theory.
Together with two other founders of this way of thinking, Randolph
Siverson and James Morrow, we published a comprehensive exposition of
the theory, The Logic of Political Survival, in 2003 with MIT Press.
That massive five-hundred-plus-page tome was full of mathematical models
and complex statistical tests. Although we readily admit it is not an
easy read, it is the most comprehensive statement of the theory.
However, it was not the origin; nor was it the finale.</p>
<p>The genesis of selectorate theory was Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and
Randy Siverson’s foray into examining what happens to leaders after they
fight wars. Surprisingly, no one had systematically looked at how
winning or losing wars affects leader survival. Given their background
in international relations, Bruce and Randy continued to pursue
war-related topics and brought in James Morrow and Alastair Smith—and
the collaborative team of BdM2S2 was born. In 1999 the four of us
published “An Institutional Explanation of the Democratic Peace” in the
American Political Science Review. This paper offered a solution to what
at the time was the dominant question in international relations: Why
don’t democratic nations fight each other? Many of the existing theories
relied on asserting different normative motivations for democrats and
autocrats. Unfortunately, all too often democrats act contrary to these
alleged higher values. In contrast, selectorate theory assumes that
leaders have the same objective, to stay in power, and that what
differentiates democrats from autocrats is that the former’s dependence
on a large coalition of supporters means democrats direct state
resources to winning wars. Autocrats enhance their survival by hoarding
resources to pay off cronies, even if this means losing the war. What
started off as a desire to know why democracies don’t fight each other
ended up telling us how nations fight and what they fight over. As is
supposed to happen in science, the answer to one problem provides
answers to other problems and ends up posing a new set of questions.</p>
<p>In 2002, BdM2S2 published a mathematical representation of the
selectorate theory, “Political Institutions, Policy Choice and the
Survival of Leaders,” in the British Journal of Political Science. We
further refined this model and then tested its predictions. This
material became the basis for The Logic of Political Survival. Since its
publication we have continued to advance the theory. In articles in the
Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2007 and International Organization in
2009, we examined how nations trade aid for policy concessions. Recent
extensions of the mathematical model incorporate revolutionary movements
and have been published in the Journal of Politics in 2008, Comparative
Political Studies in 2009, the American Journal of Political Science in
2010, the Journal of Conflict Resolution in 2015, and the Quarterly
Journal of Political Science in 2018.</p>
<p>Selectorate theory offers a powerful yet simple-to-use model of
politics. It forms the basis for the models in Punishing the Prince, for
instance. In that book, Fiona McGillivray and Alastair Smith examined
how leaders sanction leaders in other states. By targeting punishments
at leaders rather than the nations they represent, a leader leverages
the effectiveness of their state’s policies in three ways. First, such
mechanisms provide an explicit means through which to restore relations
between states. Second, they encourage the citizens in targeted nations
to remove their leaders in order to restore cooperation. Third, since
leaders fear removal, the threat of such targeted punishments encourages
leaders to abide by international norms in the first place. By focusing
on the interactions of leaders instead of thinking of international
cooperation as only between nations, Fiona enriched our understanding of
interstate relations. As was characteristic of her scholarship, she
asked questions that no one else had thought to ask and provided elegant
answers that pushed scholarship in new directions. For instance, she
examined how the dynamics of trade flows between nations depend upon the
turnover of their national leaders. She found that the replacement of
autocrats systematically altered trade flows in predictable ways.</p>
<p>Punishing the Prince was published in 2008, just a few days before
Fiona died. She is missed every day by everyone who knew her, but most
especially by Alastair and their three children, Angus, Duncan, and
Molly. She was both our greatest supporter and harshest critic. Fiona
endured a long and terrible illness, but her humor and spirit never
failed even in her darkest hour. She died waiting on a transplant list.
Please sign your donor card. The doctors and nurses at
NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and elsewhere, and especially Erika
Berman-Rosenzweig and Nazzareno Galiè, gave us extra time with her; they
have our profound thanks. Although she ruled Alastair’s life with a rod
of iron, Fiona was the epitome of a benevolent dictator.</p>
<p>Developing selectorate theory and writing this book were huge
undertakings that we could never have done without the assistance of
others. Randolph Siverson and James Morrow have been our collaborators
from the start, and many of the ideas presented here are as much theirs
as ours. Financial support is also vital for any research, and early
developments of selectorate theory benefited from generous grants from
the National Science Foundation. We also wish to thank Roger Hertog for
his support through the Alexander Hamilton Center for Political Economy
at New York University.</p>
<p>Hans Hoogeveen, formerly chief economist for the World Bank in
Tanzania, commissioned a study applying the selectorate framework to
help explain why the World Bank’s efforts in Tanzania had not been as
successful as they had hoped. The opportunity to do that study helped
sharpen our own understanding of selectorate theory and proved essential
to advancing our views on the formation of blocs of interests, whether
ethnic, linguistic, geographic, or occupational. The work undertaken at
Hans’s request was a great stimulus for us, and we are most appreciative
of his support and the opportunity he gave us. Our current employer, New
York University, is a superb organization that has never hesitated to
support our research and teaching. We benefited from superb research
assistance by Alexandra Bear and Michal Harari.</p>
<p>Colleagues, students, and friends always improve any endeavor,
especially when they are critics as well as supporters, and this book is
no exception. We are truly fortunate to be connected to such a wonderful
network of scholars and friends from whom we learn every day.

<p>Much of our previous work was aimed at an academic audience. Writing
a “readable” book is a very different enterprise. Fortunately Eric
Lupfer, our agent, took us under his wing. He worked tirelessly with us
on structure, style, and presentation, and he fixed us up with a
phenomenal press. PublicAffairs has been superbly supportive throughout
the editorial and production process. Their entire team has helped us
and supported us every step of the way. We thank Brandon Proia, who made
the first edition of this book more readable, clearer, and more tightly
argued than it would otherwise have been, and Erin Granville for her
masterful copyediting and fact-checking of the second edition, and, in
alphabetical order, Lindsay Jones, Lisa Kaufman, Jamie Leifer, Clive
Priddle, Melissa Raymond, Anais Scott, Susan Weinberg, and Michelle
Welsh-Horst, each of whom contributed mightily to improving our book.
Benjamin Adams has been invaluable in stimulating and helping us to
envision the second edition. Alas, we cannot hold them responsible for
its failings, for which Alastair and Bruce each acknowledge that the
other is responsible.</p>
<p>Of all the organizations we study, the ones we care most about are
family. These are the people that brighten our world: Erin and Jason and
Nathan and Clara; Ethan and Rebecca and Abraham and Hannah; Gwen and
Adam and Isadore and Otis; Susan, Angus, Duncan, Molly, and Penelope.
And most of all, we thank Arlene and Fiona and Susan, to whom we
dedicate this book and ourselves.</p>
<p>Our fondest hope is for the well-being and success of those who
imperil their lives to keep dictators in check.</p>

<p>PRAISE FOR THE DICTATOR’S HANDBOOK</p>
<p>“A lucidly written, shrewdly argued meditation on how democrats and
dictators preserve political authority.… In a style reminiscent of
Freakonomics, Messrs. Bueno de Mesquita and Smith present dozens of
clever examples.… The most fascinating chapter in The Dictator’s
Handbook concerns the rewards that governments provide other
governments. The authors make the obvious, but nevertheless
controversial, argument that almost all aid money is dispersed not to
alleviate poverty but to purchase loyalty and influence.… Bueno de
Mesquita and Smith are polymathic, drawing on economics, history, and
political science to make their points.… In other words, the reader will
be hard-pressed to find a single government that doesn’t largely operate
according to Messrs. Bueno de Mesquita and Smith’s model. So the next
time a hand-wringing politician, Democrat or Republican, claims to be
taking a position for the ‘good of his country,’ remember to replace the
word ‘country’ with ‘career.’”</p>
<p>—Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>“Machiavelli’s The Prince has a new rival. It’s The Dictator’s
Handbook by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith.… This is a
fantastically thought-provoking read. I found myself not wanting to
agree but actually, for the most part, being convinced that the cynical
analysis is the true one.”</p>
<p>—Diane Coyle, Enlightenment Economics</p>
<p>“In this fascinating book Bueno de Mesquita and Smith spin out their
view of governance: that all successful leaders, dictators and
democrats, can best be understood as almost entirely driven by their own
political survival—a view they characterize as ‘cynical, but we fear
accurate.’ Yet as we follow the authors through their brilliant
historical assessments of leaders’ choices—from Caesar to Tammany Hall
and the Green Bay Packers—we gradually realize that their brand of
cynicism yields extremely realistic guidance about spreading the rule of
law, decent government, and democracy. James Madison would have loved
this book.”</p>
<p>—R. James Woolsey, Director of Central Intelligence, 1993–1995, and
chairman, Foundation for Defense of Democracies</p>
<p>“In this book, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith teach us to
see dictatorship as just another form of politics, and from this
perspective they deepen our understanding of all political systems.”</p>
<p>—Roger Myerson, Glen A. Lloyd Distinguished Service Professor of
Economics at the University of Chicago</p>
