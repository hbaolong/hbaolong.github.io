<h4 id="chapter-five-getting-and-spending">CHAPTER FIVE GETTING AND
SPENDING</h4>
<p>At last, a new ruler has shaken up the coalition that first brought
him to power and has the right supporters in place. Money is coming in
thanks to the taxes being levied. Now comes the real task of governing:
allocating money to keep the coalition happy—but not too happy—and
providing just enough to keep the interchangeables from rising up in
revolt. As we saw in North Africa and the Middle East in the 2010s, and
in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and 1990s, this can be an awkward
tightrope for any leader to traverse. The last few decades encourage us
by showing that in time many autocrats fall off that tightrope, but they
also discourage us by showing that sometimes they manage to climb right
back on. It is really hard to strike just the right balance between
benefits for leaders, for their coalition, and for the mass of
interchangeables.</p>
<p>Any new incumbent who wants to be around for a long time needs to
fine-tune the art of spending money. Of course, he can err on the side
of generosity to the coalition or to the people—but only with any money
that is left for his own discretionary use after taking care of the
coalition’s needs. He had better not err on the side of shortchanging
anyone who could mount a coup or a revolution. If he shortchanges the
wrong people, any leader’s fate will confirm our abuse of William
Wordsworth’s famous line “Getting and spending, we lay waste our
powers.”</p>
<p>Thus we turn to the essential question of all democracies: how to
allocate resources aimed at providing policies of benefit to everyone in
a society. These public goods come in a variety of different forms
depending on the tastes of those in a position to demand such policies.
Those in such a position, of course, are the incumbent’s essential
backers. Different groups of essentials will have different baskets of
public goods–oriented policies in mind. Some will want to spend more on
a social safety net; others on education; still others on benefits for
the elderly or for the young, benefits to the arts, and so forth.
Although all of these are of interest and will be touched upon, however
briefly, we are especially interested in core public benefits like
education, health care, and such freedoms as a free press, free speech,
and freedom of assembly.</p>
<p>Although security against foreign invasion certainly is a central
public good, we leave consideration of foreign threats to a later
chapter and focus here on domestic policy choices. For now, let’s have a
look at how public goods can help society as a whole and how they help
entrenched leaders.</p>
<p>EFFECTIVE POLICY NEED NOT BE CIVIC MINDED</p>
<p>To balance between spending policies that benefit the masses and
those that favor the essentials, leaders would do well to reflect on
those parts of Thomas Hobbes’s philosophy of government that we touched
on briefly in the introduction. He had a lot right, but Hobbes’s ideas
about government weren’t infallible. While he realized that anyone who
enriched society would avoid a revolution such as the one he lived
through in England, he failed to distinguish between what it takes to
keep the people at bay and what it takes to keep essential backers from
betraying their leader—whether that leader is Hobbes’s Leviathan,
Plato’s philosopher king, Rousseau’s general will, or Madison’s
faction-ridden representatives of the people. Hobbes was sure his
Leviathan had to be a benign ruler. That, Hobbes seems to have thought,
was the way to prevent a revolution such as he had experienced. Without
a ruler who enriched his people, Hobbes feared, for many, life would be,
in his well-coined phrase, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
short.”</p>
<p>Hobbes was only half-right. It is true, as Hobbes believed, that
happy, well-cared-for people are unlikely to revolt. China’s prolonged
economic growth seems to have verified that belief (at least for now).
Keep them fat and happy, and the masses are unlikely to rise up against
you. It seems equally true, however, that sick, starving, ignorant
people are also unlikely to revolt. All seems quiet among North Korea’s
masses, who deify their Great Successor and Supreme Leader as the sole
source of whatever meager, life-sustaining resources they have. Who
makes revolution? It is the great in-between: those who are neither
immiserated nor coddled. The former are too weak and cowed to revolt.
The latter are content and have no reason to revolt. Truly, it is the
great in-between who are a threat to the stability of a regime and its
leaders. Therefore, a prudent leader balances resources between keeping
the coalition content and the people just fit enough to produce the
wealth needed to enrich the essentials and the incumbent. We should not
be surprised that those countries whose governments rely on the fewest
essential backers—that is, those that are least democratic—are the very
places where Hobbes’s state of nature is most likely to be an apt
description of life for the masses. They are also, as we saw earlier,
the places where leaders have the best prospect of staying in control
for years and years.</p>
<p>Leaders who depend on a large coalition have to work hard to make
sure that their citizens’ lives are not solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,
and short. That doesn’t mean democratic rulers have to be civic minded,
or that they need to harbor warm and cuddly feelings for their citizens.
All they need is to ensure that there are ample public benefits to
provide a high quality of life. They just need to follow the rules by
which successful leaders rule, adapting them to the difficult
circumstances that any democrat faces: stuck depending on an unruly
crowd of essentials to stay in power.</p>
<p>Just as democrats have no need to be civic visionaries, dictators
likewise aren’t bound to make life miserable. It just happens, more
often than not, to work out better for them to do so. There are
exceptions, but those exceptions tend simply to reaffirm the importance
of obeying the rules of politics. As we have noted, it is okay for a
leader to spend her pot of discretionary money on trying to bring the
good life to her citizenry. By definition, discretionary money is money
that is not required to keep the coalition loyal; the coalition has
already been paid off before any resources become discretionary.
Singapore, for example, has managed through benevolent dictatorship to
produce a high quality of material life for its citizens, albeit without
many of the freedoms that others hold dear. Maybe Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore’s longtime benefactor, was the embodiment of Hobbes’s
Leviathan. But benevolent dictators like Singapore’s late LKY are hard
to find.</p>
<p>The most reliable means to a good life for ordinary people remains
the presence of institutional incentives in the form of dependence on a
big coalition, which compels power-seeking politicians to govern for the
people. Democracy, especially with little or no organized bloc voting
(one of India’s great political constraints), aligns incentives such
that politicians can best serve their own self-interest, especially
their interest in staying in office, by promoting the welfare of a large
proportion of the people. That, we believe, is why most democracies are
prosperous, stable, and secure places to live.</p>
<p>Perhaps you doubt that the path to a good life is ensured by the
presence of a big coalition. You wouldn’t be alone. Many distinguished
economists, even quite a few with a Nobel Prize under their belt, are
convinced that the best way to promote democracy is by promoting
prosperity. That is why whenever they see an economic crisis looming on
the horizon, such as a government so indebted that it is on the verge of
default and bankruptcy, they call for debt forgiveness, new loans, lots
of foreign aid, and other economic fixes. They resist the cry of people
like us who demand improved governance before any bailout money is
offered up to rescue a troubled autocratic economy. They are convinced
that wealth—not politics—is the best route to escape Hobbes’s state of
nature. Simply reviewing the history of economic bailouts, as we
outlined in the previous chapter, makes clear that the very forgiveness
without political change so eagerly embraced for third-world financial
crises is rarely sought when the crisis arises in a society that relies
on a large coalition.</p>
<p>BAILOUTS AND COALITION SIZE</p>
<p>The politics of economic bailouts can be quite different in small-
and large-coalition regimes. Bailouts come in many forms: shifts in
domestic taxing and spending; loans, whether from banks at home or
abroad; debt forgiveness; or foreign aid. Any bailout is accompanied by
demands for economic reform, whether the money comes from the IMF, the
Deutsche Bundesbank, or the taxpayers. A big difference between large-
and small-coalition bailout recipients is that the former almost always
institute reforms and the latter only infrequently do.</p>
<p>Just like debt forgiveness, a bailout in the face of economic stress
for autocrats is a way to solve an impending political crisis. When
their economy becomes too feeble to provide sufficient money to buy
political loyalty, autocrats face being overthrown by either a rival or
a revolution. This, in a nutshell, is the story of the politico-economic
crises in small-coalition, autocratic places like Tunisia and Egypt in
2011. A bailout, whether generated from within or through outside loans
or aid, can buy off opposition and thwart the threat to the leader’s
hold on power. Therefore, during an economic crisis autocrats shop
around for bailout money from others to save themselves in the name of
relieving their country’s financial woes.</p>
<p>For large-coalition leaders bailouts are a curse, or at least a
necessary evil. Voters are likely to see a poorly performing economy as
the consequence of a policy failure, resulting in the leadership’s being
thrown out by the voters at the first opportunity. That was very much a
part of the story of the defeat of the Republican Party in 2008 and,
when the economy did not turn around fast enough to satisfy voters, the
defeat of the Democrats in the House of Representatives in 2010.
Similarly, Trump’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic
crisis it induced contributed to his electoral defeat in 2020. He and
his party were reluctant to provide a large bailout during the
presidential campaign, and voilà, out he went. So the need for an
economic bailout strongly signals voters to find new leaders with new
policy ideas. Foreign aid rarely comes to the rescue of democrats, for
reasons we will explain later. Therefore, financial crises and the need
for a bailout are just about always bad news for democratic leaders in
power.</p>
<p>The rich countries of the world faced a severe economic crisis in
2008 and 2009. Both the Bush and Obama administrations sought to stem
the worst of the crisis by providing massive financial bailouts to save
the banking industry and other large businesses, restore liquidity in
the market, and bring the US economy back onto a path toward sustained
growth. Much the same was done in Europe. These bailouts were
accompanied by regulatory change. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, signed by President Obama in 2010, is a case in
point. Faced with a severe recession, Congress passed the largest
regulatory reform since the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p>In contrast, in small-coalition regimes, bailouts all too often are
the means to preserve business as usual. Economic bailouts in
autocracies rarely precipitate a serious review of economic or business
policies. They are almost never accompanied by regulatory reform.
Consequently, economic crises happen more often than in democracies and,
so long as rich nations feel an urge to provide loans, debt forgiveness,
or aid, rarely result in betterment for the society—although they do
result in security for lousy leaders.</p>
<p>IS DEMOCRACY A LUXURY?</p>
<p>Are dictators and economists right that economic solvency needs to
come ahead of political change? Is becoming materially rich the
precursor for the luxury of democracy? We think not. There are plenty of
well-to-do places that nevertheless suffer under oppressive governments
that keep ordinary people’s lives as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
short as their neighbors’ in poorer nations. Take a look at just about
any nondemocratic oil-rich or diamond-studded regime.</p>
<p>Yes, the world has produced wise, well-intentioned leaders even among
those who depend on few essentials, but it neither produces a lot of
them nor ensures that they have good ideas about how to make life better
for others. Indeed, a common refrain among small-coalition rulers is
that the very freedoms that promote welfare-improving government
policies, like free speech, free press, and especially freedom of
assembly, are luxuries to be doled out only after prosperity is achieved
and not before. This seems to be the self-serving claim of leaders who
keep their people poor and oppressed. The People’s Republic of China is
the poster boy for this view.</p>
<p>When Deng Xiaoping introduced economic liberalization to China in the
1980s, experts in wealthy Western countries contended that China’s
economy would grow and the growth would lead to rapid democratization.
Today, after more than forty years of sustained rapid growth in China,
we still await these anticipated political reforms. Instead, we see the
opposite in China’s policy toward Hong Kong. Despite China’s commitment
to economic growth, it is prepared to crush democracy in Hong Kong even
if doing so puts Hong Kong’s successful economy, created during a
century of British rule, at risk. Apparently, China’s fear that Hong
Kong’s freedoms might stimulate revolution on the mainland is stronger
than its urge to achieve prosperity. Indeed, governance in China
demonstrates how wrong Western experts were about the ties between
prosperity and democratization. As China’s per capita income improved
over the past four decades, the size of its winning coalition held
pretty steady for a while and then went into a prolonged period of
shrinkage between 2000 and the present. Growth does not guarantee
political improvement, but neither does it preclude it. The Republic of
China (a.k.a. Taiwan) and the Republic of Korea (a.k.a. South Korea) are
models of building prosperity ahead of democracy. Needless to say, the
People’s Republic of China certainly is not fond of promoting either of
those countries’ experiences.</p>
<p>Many economists arrive at the same inference as dictators, though
from an entirely different perspective. For many economists, the
contention that nations must work on becoming rich before becoming free
follows from how they think about politics. They treat politics as just
so much friction, to be written off instead of dealt with. But reality
is very different. True, some countries that become rich then become
democratic, but many nondemocratic regimes, like China, become even less
democratic as they become richer. In contrast, poor autocratic regimes
that become more democratic are highly likely to subsequently become
rich, or at least richer. Political improvement is more successful at
encouraging economic growth than economic improvement is at producing
political reform.</p>
<p>No doubt it is good to be rich, and many of the world’s rich
countries are democratic. But dependence on a large coalition of
essentials is a powerful explanation for quality of life even when
wealth is absent, just as it seems to be a harbinger of future wealth.
Economic growth and success, in contrast, does not seem to be an
assurance of improved governance and, indeed, may hinder it.1 This is a
question worth exploring in greater depth, though for now our subject is
how variations in the size of the group of essentials and
interchangeables determines how resources are allocated between public
and private rewards so as to pay just the right amount to one’s
coalition while also paying just enough to keep the citizenry from
making trouble.</p>
<p>PUBLIC GOODS NOT FOR THE PUBLIC’S GOOD</p>
<p>From a leader’s point of view, the most important function of the
people is to pay taxes. All regimes need money. As a result, certain
basic public goods must be made available even by the meanest autocrat,
unless he has access to significant revenue from sources that are not
based on taxing workers, like oil or foreign aid. Public benefits like
essential infrastructure, education, and health care need to be readily
available to ensure that labor is productive enough to pay taxes to line
the pockets of rulers and their essential supporters. These policies are
not instituted for the betterment of the masses, even though, of course,
some members of the masses, especially workers, benefit from them.</p>
<p>Education, as a means for getting ahead in life, is a big deal for
any country’s citizenry. Indeed, a popular refrain among many
liberal-minded thinkers is to extol the quality of education in
otherwise oppressive states like Cuba or even North Korea. And they have
a good point. Both Cuba and North Korea have impressive primary
education. For instance, a 2014 USAID study found that Cuban third and
fourth graders far outperform their counterparts in other Latin American
countries. As for North Korea, like Cuba, it has a 100 percent literacy
rate. In contrast, only 74 percent of democratic India’s people can
read.2 But these facts can be misleading or even downright wrong. That
basic education is mandatory and extensive in autocratic nations often
is used to argue that autocracy isn’t so bad.</p>
<p>Rarely do any of us stop to probe beneath these observations to find
out why dictators pay to have well-educated third graders—but do not
carry that quality of education forward to higher learning. The logic
behind political survival teaches us to be suspicious. We cannot help
but believe that these public goods are not intended to uplift and
assist the people unfortunate enough to live in such places. The rules
of politics, as we know, instruct leaders to do no more for the people
than is absolutely essential to prevent rebellion. Leaders who spend on
public welfare at the expense of their essentials are courting
disaster.</p>
<p>Leaders, whether dictators or democrats, are all grappling with the
same question: How much education is the right amount? For those who
rely on few essential backers, the answer is straightforward:
educational opportunity should not be so extensive as to equip ordinary
folks, the interchangeables, to question government authority. A naive
person might look at any number of awful regimes and yet come to the
conclusion that, because they provide such public benefits as
nationalized health care or sound primary education, they’re actually
better to their people than many democratic states are to theirs. This
is nonsense, of course—in the vast majority of cases autocrats are
simply keeping the peasants healthy enough to work and educated enough
to do their jobs. Either way, literate or not, they’re still peasants
and they’re going to stay that way.</p>
<p>A far better measure of leaders’ interest in education is the
distribution of top universities. With the exceptions of China, Russia,
and Singapore, no nondemocratic country has even one university rated
among the world’s top two hundred. Despite China’s size, the best-ranked
Chinese university—not counting universities in Hong Kong, where
academic freedom was once protected by the agreement that transferred
Hong Kong from Britain to China in July 1997—is only in twentieth place
despite China’s opportunity to draw top minds from its vast population.
The highest-ranking Russian university, with Russia’s long history of
dictatorship, is 174th. By contrast, countries with relatively few
people but with dependence on many essential backers, like Israel,
Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada, have several
universities ranked among the top two hundred.3 Switzerland, with
one-third the population of the city of Shanghai, has a university that
is ranked fourteenth in the world. That this uneven distribution of
top-notch universities favors large-coalition locales is no
accident.</p>
<p>Highly educated people are a potential threat to autocrats, and so
autocrats make sure to limit educational opportunity. Autocrats want
workers to have basic labor skills, like literacy, but they want their
own children—their most likely successors—to be truly well educated, and
so they send them off to schools in places like Switzerland, where Kim
Jong-Un, Kim Jong Il’s youngest son, was educated. Dictators also like
to have their children educated at leading universities in the United
States and, especially, at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. In
fact, one might almost conclude that Oxford is a breeding ground for
authoritarians. It certainly is the alma mater of many, including
Zimbabwe’s late Robert Mugabe; the Bhutto family of Pakistan; and the
kings of Jordan, Bhutan, Malaysia, and even little Tonga. England’s
big-coalition system opens the door pretty broadly to give access to
higher education.</p>
<p>When the leadership relies on few essentials, higher education is for
the children of the powerful; when the bloc of essentials is big, it is
for the betterment of everyone. One of the features of the old Soviet
regime that Boris Yeltsin balked at, for instance, was exactly the
privileged access that children of Communist Party leaders had to the
best universities regardless of their ability. Kids of loyal families
were helped to get ahead. The capable children of potentially dissident
families were kept down by being excluded from the best schools.4</p>
<p>One thing that dictatorships and democracies have in common is the
special advantage insiders seem to have when it comes to the top
universities. Even places with lots of essentials seem to work that way,
although the privileged access is voluntarily granted by the
universities and not imposed on them by the government. The president of
the United States doesn’t get to tell Harvard who to admit. A closer
look at the system demonstrates the reasoning: Harvard and many other
prestigious universities favor “legacies”—that is, the children of
alumni—because admitting such students is likely to bring the university
more donations from its wealthy graduates. What may seem like a case of
privileged access in an otherwise open, large-coalition system actually
reflects the internal dynamics of universities themselves.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t fail to notice that universities in their own right
constitute small-coalition political systems with a pretty big batch of
interchangeables. No surprise, then, that they behave like autocracies,
favoring the rich and connected at the expense of those who lack
political clout. If you doubt it, have a look one day at how many
administrators university presidents like to hire compared to faculty.
It seems you can never have too many supporting-cast administrators
whose jobs depend on keeping the person at the top happy. Faculty, on
the other hand, don’t have to keep their “bosses” happy; they have to
keep their colleagues happy long enough to get tenure and then they are
pretty free to do whatever they want—why do you think we can write this
passage! There is a delicate balance to be struck, to be sure, and so
successful university leaders are especially skilled at doling out
private rewards to anyone who could be a threat. People who raise money
for the university frequently get a percentage of what they bring in to
incentivize them. Faculty who are cooperative are likely to more readily
be granted sabbaticals, get research funds, pick the classes (usually
small) that they teach, and so forth. So we shouldn’t be surprised by
distortions in merit in universities; they really are small-coalition
regimes.</p>
<p>We might hope for a rosier picture when it comes to secondary
education in places that need few essentials. Why wouldn’t all political
leaders favor open access to secondary school, where students learn
higher levels of math, science, language, literature, history, and
social thought? That’s easy to answer. These are dangerous public goods
that should be doled out carefully. It just isn’t necessary to have lots
of people around with skills that are not absolutely required to produce
revenue for the autocrat’s regime. Why, for instance, would any autocrat
eager to stay in power want to open the secondary schools to people who
are not likely to contribute to the coalition’s wealth and security?
Math and science are great subjects for study in China; sociology and
political science are subjects for study in democracies.</p>
<p>WHO DOESN’T LOVE A CUTE BABY?</p>
<p>The incentives to provide good health care are not so different from
the incentives to provide basic education. Keeping the labor force
humming is the primary concern for leaders of small-coalition
countries—everything, and everyone, else is inessential. There is no
point in spending lots of money on the health of people who are not in
the labor force and who won’t be in the labor force for a long time. One
of the more depressing ways in which this can be seen is in the relation
between the performance of health-care systems for infants and the size
of a government’s winning coalition.</p>
<p>It seems that a lot of dictators and their essential backers don’t
love babies. This is true whether we think of seeming monsters like
Saddam Hussein or leaders like Fidel Castro, who was often praised for
his efforts to foster high-quality health care in Cuba.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein built lavish palaces while his people suffered under
the impact of economic sanctions. The UN provided baby formula with the
intention of offsetting the impact of this hardship on little
children—however, Hussein allowed his cronies to steal it. The formula
found its way to markets throughout the Middle East, yielding profits
for Hussein even as shortages in Iraq resulted in a doubling of the
infant mortality rate. There is no doubt that Hussein was a miserable
human being—it may be that his record is no better or worse than any
other heartless brute. Alternatively, it could be that dependence on a
small group of cronies made him act as if he were a brute. Perhaps in a
different place and circumstance he might have gone around kissing
babies to garner political support. Perhaps Chemical Ali was right that
Saddam was too merciful.5 Indeed, it so happens that even in many
autocracies with reportedly good health-care systems, infant mortality
is high. This may be because helping little children does not
particularly help leaders survive in power. It’s not that they don’t
like a cute baby as much as the next guy; they simply recognize that
helping babies doesn’t help them.</p>
<p>Cuba has the lowest infant mortality rate in Latin America. It’s a
commendable accomplishment at one-twelfth the rate of Haiti, which has
the highest. However, the real question is whether we should attribute
this to Fidel Castro’s beneficence in building a quality health-care
system over the nearly half century he was in power or whether he just
inherited a good health-care system from his predecessor, Fulgencio
Batista, a petty dictator who first rose to power—as did a good health
system—in a democratic Cuba in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Batista originally rose in prominence as a participant in Cuba’s 1933
coup. Although a succession of other figures became president of Cuba,
Batista, as army chief of staff, remained a key figure behind the throne
throughout this transitional period. He defeated former president (under
the coup regime) Ramón Grau San Martín in the free, democratic election
of 1940. Batista then served as Cuba’s democratically elected president
from 1940 until his term ended in 1944. It is noteworthy that during
this period Batista enjoyed the support of Cuba’s Communist Party
because of his strongly pro-labor and pro–labor union policies. Indeed,
during his period as a democratic leader under the rules of Cuba’s 1940
constitution, Batista proved to be an effective social reformer who also
helped promote successful economic policies.6 In short, he governed just
the way we would expect a large-coalition leader to govern.</p>
<p>After his term expired, Batista moved to the United States. His
preferred successor for the presidency lost to Grau in the 1944 Cuban
presidential election. Although still in the United States in 1948,
Batista was elected to the Cuban senate. He returned home to serve and
then ran again for the presidency in 1952, but he was a distant third in
the polls to Robert Agramonte, the front-runner, and Carlos Hevia.
Seeing that he had no chance to be elected and possessing the backing of
the United States government, pro-American Batista launched a coup
before the election took place. Backed by the army, Batista now assumed
the presidency as a small-coalition dictator, gradually shrinking the
coalition from 0.66 at its democratic peak to an autocratic low of 0.39,
then bringing it back to 0.52 before he fell to Castro’s revolution.
From the time Fidel Castro came to power to the present, Cuba’s
winning-coalition score has oscillated between 0.16 and 0.12, leading us
to suspect that Cuba’s infant mortality success has more to do with the
relatively more democratic period than with the revolution. Let’s see
what the record reveals.</p>
<p>The Cuban economy depended largely on agriculture, especially growing
sugarcane, a highly labor-intensive activity. As a result, both
Batista’s and Castro’s regimes, bereft of natural-resource wealth, had
to rely on workers to generate revenue. Each did have the benefit of
supplementing that revenue with a significant amount of foreign aid,
from the United States in Batista’s case and from the Soviet Union in
Castro’s. Nevertheless, to stay afloat, both needed to maintain a
healthy and reasonably educated workforce. Therefore, both Batista’s
Cuba and Castro’s Cuba needed good health care as well as good basic
education.</p>
<p>We should not expect vast differences between the public goods
provided by Batista after he became a dictator and those provided by
Castro, but we should expect some, favoring Batista, since his coalition
was larger. To be sure, their ideological songs were radically
different, but they both depended on a small clique to keep them in
power. In both cases, the military was essential and so were loyal
bureaucrats. So, putting aside the window dressing each used to justify
their rule and stripping out the ideology, they were running similar
regimes. The main difference in our terms was that Batista had a
(larger) small coalition and a small selectorate once he overthrew the
constitution. Castro ran a rigged-election regime, so he, like Batista,
had a small coalition, but unlike Batista his nominal selectorate was
pretty big. Of course, the real Cuban selectorate under Castro, the
influentials, was probably no bigger than Batista’s real selectorate. So
we should anticipate that both of them were good at producing good
health care and good primary education. And the facts bear out these
expectations.</p>
<p>Although a headline fact is that Cuba has Latin America’s best infant
mortality rate, the details reveal that the relative quality of infant
care has declined. Cuba had Latin America’s best infant mortality rate
under Batista as well as under the Castros. In general, small-coalition
regimes gradually run their economy into the ground through
inefficiencies designed to benefit the leader and essentials in the
short run, at the expense of longer-term productivity. How quickly
welfare erodes depends in part on what foreign aid comes in to offset
the economic woes brought on by small-coalition governance. We should
see trends indicating declining quality of health care in Cuba under
Castro compared to Batista, not necessarily because one was more civic
minded than the other but because time inexorably diminishes the quality
of life for ordinary people in most petty dictatorships.</p>
<p>Cuba’s absolute infant mortality rate has improved markedly since
Batista’s overthrow, but Cuba’s relative quality of infant care has not
kept pace with the rest of the world’s. Medical technology has improved
health care substantially since the end of World War II, and especially
since Castro’s revolution succeeded in 1959. Cuba’s improvements in
infant mortality, though substantial, have lagged behind improvements in
infant mortality in many other countries. In 1957, not long before
Batista was overthrown by Castro’s revolution, Cuba’s infant mortality
rate was thirty-two per one thousand live births. This was the
thirteenth best in the world at the time. To put this impressive record
in perspective, Cuba was outperforming Austria, Belgium, France, Israel,
Japan, Spain, Portugal, and West Germany. Today, all of these countries
outrank Cuba in infant mortality rates except for France—the two are
tied according to the World Bank. Yet, until the demise of the Soviet
Union, Cuba’s economic growth rate was one of the highest in Latin
America, and its abortion rate (25; that is, twenty-five abortions per
one thousand women of childbearing age) is among the highest in the
world. By comparison, among countries that allow abortion—the relevant
comparison group—the average abortion rate is 15.7, well below
Cuba’s.7</p>
<p>Cuba’s infant mortality story is one of the better ones among
countries with long histories of petty dictatorship. Indeed, even wealth
proves a poor way to inoculate little children from untimely deaths. But
having a big coalition is the best vaccine. Like all medicine, it is not
perfect, but it makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>The world’s thirty governments that depend on the largest groups of
essentials have twenty fewer infant deaths per one thousand births than
the thirty governments that depend on the smallest groups of essentials.
Having a high per capita income reduces the infant mortality rate even
more, but then almost every rich country is a democracy, dependent on a
large coalition, and almost every poor country relies on a small
coalition. Being rich and being democratic facilitates saving babies’
lives!</p>
<p>CLEAN DRINKING WATER</p>
<p>For autocrats, money spent on people who are years away from
contributing to the economy—like infants and little children—is money
wasted. Resources should instead be focused on those who help the ruler
stay in power now, not those who might be valuable in the distant
future. When you see images flowing out of populations in crisis, it’s
apparent that suffering at the extremes of the life span is hardly
uncommon in autocracies. It’s not that these terrible conditions can’t
be reversed; it’s that the autocrat chooses not to reverse them as a
simple matter of cost. Funds diverted in such a fashion would be taken
right out of her own pocket and the pockets of the coalition.</p>
<p>Consider the availability of as basic and essential a public good as
clean drinking water. In a world in which easily prevented waterborne
diseases like cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea kill millions of the
young and old—that is, nonworkers—clean water would be a tremendous
lifesaver. The problem is that these are lives that autocrats seem not
to value. Sure enough, drinking water is cleaner and more widely
available in democratic countries than in small-coalition regimes,
independent of the separate and significant impact of per capita income.
Honduras, for instance, is a pretty poor country. Its per capita income
is only about ,728 (in current US dollars) according to the latest World
Bank estimates. Yet 95 percent of the people in Honduras have access to
clean drinking water. Per capita income in Equatorial Guinea is 8,558,
more than three times higher than in Honduras.8 And yet only about 68
percent of its people enjoy clean potable water. This is true even
though both places have the same burden of a tropical climate; both were
Spanish colonies; and both are predominantly Christian societies. The
big difference: Honduras is considerably more democratic, with a larger
group of essentials, than Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p>Is this comparison out of the ordinary? Not at all! Kuwait, awash in
oil wealth but cursed with a small-coalition regime, has much worse
access to clean drinking water than its not-oil-rich neighbor Israel.
Israel enjoys one of the world’s highest scores on water quality. To be
sure, higher-income countries on average do enjoy higher-quality
drinking water than poorer countries. Looking within approximately equal
per-capita-income slices of the world, however, those regimes that
depend on a big coalition on average make quality drinking water readily
accessible to almost their entire population, and those that depend on a
smaller coalition lag behind by 20 percent or more. The availability and
technology of clean water doesn’t favor democratic societies; democratic
regimes favor ensuring that drinking water is clean.</p>
<p>BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>As we’ve demonstrated, even a nasty dictator provides the people with
basic education and essential health care so that they can work at
making the autocrat rich. There is one more public goods program that is
necessary to translate labor into his or her wealth. Everything the
workers make has to get out to the market so that the leader can sell
the product of the workers’ labor for money. That means there is a need
for roads to transport what’s been made to markets where people have
money.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is still a balance when it comes to
infrastructure. Since roads run in two directions, one must be careful
not to build too many roads or, especially, roads to the wrong places.
Roads are very costly to build, and it is easy to hide their true costs.
This makes them a good source of graft, which in turn makes constructing
them attractive. But having a country too well connected can lead to new
regional power centers—political, economic, or otherwise—that undermine
the autocrat. And if things ever heat up sufficiently to encourage
rebellion, the roads that autocrats build can come back to haunt them.
Shoddy infrastructure is often an intentionally designed feature of many
countries, not a misfortune suffered unwillingly.</p>
<p>Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (today’s Democratic Republic of the Congo)
once told Rwanda’s president, Juvénal Habyarimana, “I’ve been in power
in Zaire for thirty years, and I never built one road.” Why? As he
explained to Habyarimana, “Now they are driving down your roads to get
you.”9 Indeed, when Mobutu came to power in 1965, Zaire had about ninety
thousand miles of roads. Thirty-two years later, when he was finally
deposed, only about six thousand miles remained, just enough to sell
goods and not enough to make it easy to get to Mobutu. So, roads to
market: yes. Roads to get you out of the country: yes. Other roads:
no.</p>
<p>Consider how straight or curvy the roads are from the center of
capital cities to the city’s largest airport. Of course, just how
straight a road is depends on a number of factors. There’s topography,
how sprawling the capital city is, the technology when the road was
built, and how wealthy the society is. And then there is the size of the
winning coalition.</p>
<p>Wealth is not randomly distributed. Places that depend on broad-based
support to keep the government in power tend to be wealthy too. That
might lead us to think that airport highways are especially straight in
wealthy—read: large-coalition—societies, since rich governments can most
easily compensate people for tearing down their houses to make efficient
roads from the city to the airport. And yet that isn’t the case.</p>
<p>Topography, unlike wealth, isn’t dictated by politics. A landscape
spattered with wide waterways and high mountains is likely to make the
road from the capital city to its airport pretty curvy regardless of the
type of government that runs the society. To just plow straight ahead in
such circumstances means building tunnels and long bridges. Those are
expensive. Tearing through villages is expensive, too, if the
townspeople need to be properly compensated when the government invokes
its right of eminent domain to knock down houses. And the people who
need to be compensated in such circumstances may well happen to be both
influential and essential. If the townsfolk whose houses are in the way
of an airport road are not influential or essential, then it is cheaper
to go straight ahead than to skirt village after village.</p>
<p>If the choice of route were just about economics, one might think
that straight roads from city to airport would be especially prevalent
in rich countries. But if politics trumps economics, then straight roads
would more often be the province of petty dictatorships rather than of
representative—and rich—democracies. That the difference between driving
distance and the distance as the crow flies is related to politics, and
especially to how many essentials a leader needs, is rather interesting
and perhaps surprising, but related they are.</p>
<p>We calculated the ratio of driving distance to the distance as the
crow flies from the major airport serving each national capital for 158
countries.10 A low ratio means a fairly straight road; higher ratios
mean more curves. Only two of the thirty lowest ratios—places where the
driving distance is almost equal to the distance as the crow flies—fall
in democracies, taking the average coalition requirements for governance
into account over the thirty years from 1981 to 2010. Portugal and
Canada have the straightest roads to their respective capital-city
airports among societies whose leaders rely on lots of essentials to
hold power. Portugal has the world’s thirteenth-lowest ratio and Canada
is twenty-eighth. Which countries have the ten lowest ratios? Guinea,
Cuba, Dominica, Colombia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Ecuador,
Ethiopia, and Equatorial Guinea. This certainly is not a who’s who of
democracy. Only Ecuador’s and Colombia’s governments, among this motley
crew, are making real progress toward dependence on a large coalition.
The average coalition size for these ten by our estimation method is
0.54 out of a possible score of 1.00.11 The world’s average in 2020 was
0.68—that is, substantially higher than this set of countries, with the
caveat that Colombia scores 0.78 and Ecuador 0.67!12</p>
<p>The lesson is that when an autocrat needs a road to the airport (a
good route of escape), he can just confiscate people’s property to make
the road as straight and as quickly traveled as possible. As President
Obama observed in his State of the Union address on January 25, 2011,
when discussing the similar issue of building railroads, “If the central
government wants a railroad, they get a railroad—no matter how many
homes are bulldozed.” He was contrasting what autocrats can do with what
he, as a democratic leader, cannot.</p>
<p>Democrats find using eminent domain politically costly and so are
more likely to go around a village or house than to knock it down. In
the event that a democrat ignores property rights, it’s likely that all
the freedoms she must provide will culminate in people taking to the
courts and the streets to redress any perceived wrong. A smart democrat,
of course, tries to avoid such troubles, using eminent domain only when
it benefits many people, especially members of the democrat’s
constituency (the influentials). It is incredible to see how easily
leaders can take people’s property in the People’s Republic of China and
how hard it has been to do the same in Hong Kong. When essentials are
few, pretty much anything goes. Sadly, that probably means it will be
getting easier to bulldoze property for government purposes in Hong Kong
as China extends its control.</p>
<p>Roads are not the only infrastructure whose construction seems to
emphasize private benefits in autocracies and public benefits in
democracies. Autocrats and democrats need electric grids. For instance,
an excellent study showed that when governments expand reliance on a
large coalition, they shift electricity pricing and availability away
from policies that favor industry and toward policies that help
consumers—that is, the masses instead of the wealthiest in society.13
And then there are the Mobutu Sese Sekos of the world, who have worked
out how to use electric power to advance their political survival.</p>
<p>Mobutu famously replaced local electricity-generating capacity near
Zaire’s copper mines with a hydroelectric station that was more than a
thousand miles away. This empowered him to cut off electricity at the
touch of a button, guaranteeing that he, and not some local
entrepreneur, controlled the flow of copper wealth. It’s worth noting
that the power lines bypassed all the people along the way. That’s the
right sort of infrastructure project for someone who wants to use public
policy to secure his hold on power.</p>
<p>Massive construction projects, like the Aswan Dam in Egypt and
China’s Three Gorges Dam, are very much like Mobutu’s power grid. These
sorts of projects are great for autocrats. Although they dislocate vast
numbers of people, they also generate vast corruption opportunities,
making them gems of private rewards as well as providers of basic public
infrastructure. It is noteworthy that they also cost far more to build
than comparable dams in the United States or other democratic countries,
where such projects serve primarily to advance public—not
private—welfare.</p>
<p>All leaders need to provide some public goods so that the people can
work to pay taxes. This is just as true in other organizational
settings. Corporate bosses cannot expect their employees to produce in
isolation. Communications, training, and team-building skills promote
productivity, although they also facilitate the coordination of protest
against the boss. For this reason, not all corporate phones connect to
everywhere.</p>
<p>Even the heads of crime families provide public goods (or,
technically, “club goods”—benefits to the members of the crime family)
that help mobsters earn, of which perhaps the most important is
reputation. Mobsters would find it much harder to demand protection
money if people did not believe they were backed by muscle. Mafias also
provide muscle and deterrence to protect their members. Killing a
mafioso is not to be undertaken lightly. Mobs also provide lawyers. Each
of these services is a valuable reward. But more importantly, they keep
the mafia earning. Like autocrats, mob bosses provide those public goods
(or, more accurately, club goods enjoyed within a mafia family) that
help mobsters produce the wealth that their bosses need to stay on
top.</p>
<p>PUBLIC GOODS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD</p>
<p>In small-coalition polities, public goods often serve the narrow
interests of the leadership and only indirectly the interests of
citizens. The situation is almost entirely different for those who rely
on a big coalition. For such leaders, the desire to stay in office
dictates that they must satisfy the large coalition’s desire for access
to good education at all levels; to quality health care at all levels;
and, most importantly, to the means to make the wishes of the coalition
easily known by the government at all levels. It is surely no
coincidence that, excluding Kuwait and Bahrain—petrostates—all but one
(Singapore) of the twenty-five countries in the contemporary world with
the highest per capita incomes are liberal democracies—that is,
societies that enjoy rule of law, with transparent and accountable
government, a free press, and freedom of assembly. These are places that
foster rather than suppress or obstruct political competition. They
foster such competition not out of civic-mindedness but rather out of
the necessity of assembling a large coalition of supporters.</p>
<p>Some of the richest people in the world live in tiny countries with
tiny populations, like Iceland, Malta, and Luxembourg. Others live in
countries with vast populations—such as the United States or Japan—while
still others live in expansive territories with relatively modest
populations, like Canada or Australia. Some of the wealthiest people
live in religiously homogeneous societies like Denmark or Italy, but
others reside in religiously heterogeneous nations such as the United
Kingdom or the United States. Many of the richest countries are in
Europe, but others are in Asia, North America, or Oceania. Some were
imperial powers, like Britain and France; others were themselves
colonies, like Canada and New Zealand.</p>
<p>What, then, do these countries have in common? It is not their
geographic locale, their culture, religion, history, or size. What they
all have in common is that they are democracies and therefore depend on
a large coalition, albeit of different shapes and sizes. And being
dependent on many essentials, all of these regimes share in common the
provision of the cheap and yet hugely valuable public good called
freedom.</p>
<p>Although such crucial freedoms as free speech, free assembly, and a
free press are cheap to provide, autocrats avoid them like the plague.
Democratic leaders no doubt wish they could avoid these freedoms, since
it is these public goods that make it easy for opponents to organize to
overthrow them. But those who depend on a large coalition can’t escape
them because they cannot amass a winning coalition without guaranteeing
large numbers of people the right to say, read, and write what they
want, and to come together to discuss and debate at will. And then
democrats must listen and deliver what their constituents want or else
someone else will come to power and do so.</p>
<p>But when incumbents rely on a small coalition of cronies, then
coalition members are readily satisfied by being made rich through
corruption and cronyism. They do not risk these riches by demanding that
incumbents siphon money away from them and into effective public
policies. Under these conditions, leaders can readily limit the
provision of public goods in general and freedom in particular if they
so choose. Hence, democracies escape Hobbes’s state of nature and
autocracies generally don’t. Indeed, we can see just how dramatic the
difference is in escaping the state of nature by looking at what happens
when nature exercises its freedom to wreak havoc. We have in mind the
consequences of natural disasters like earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis,
and droughts. These certainly are not political events, but their
consequences are the product of how rulers allocate revenue and how
people’s freedom to organize shapes allocation decisions.</p>
<p>EARTHQUAKES AND GOVERNANCE</p>
<p>An earthquake of magnitude 7 on the Richter scale is ten times larger
than one of magnitude 6, just as an 8 is ten times larger than a 7 and a
hundred times bigger than a 6. The city of Bam in Iran suffered a
terrible earthquake on December 26, 2003. Its magnitude was between 6.5
and 6.6. Of the city’s approximately 97,000 residents, 26,271 were
killed. Chile, with a similar per capita income to Iran, experienced a
magnitude 7.9 earthquake on June 14, 2005. That is twenty-five times
bigger than the Bam earthquake, and it struck in a more populous area.
The Chilean quake hit the city of Iquique, which had a population of
about 238,000. Remarkably, it killed only eleven people. Was this good
luck or good policy at work?</p>
<p>Chile and Iran both regularly experience substantial seismic
activity. Therefore, we should expect that their governments are
attentive to the risks of earthquakes and the devastation that can
befall their people. But everything we have argued urges us to be
cautious about such an optimistic view of governance.</p>
<p>Just looking at the past sixty years of history, Iran has
consistently been a small-coalition regime. The shah’s government may
well have depended on a somewhat smaller group of essentials than Iran’s
current theocracy, but the two regimes are in practice not so different.
To our way of thinking, therefore, Iran is not a place we would expect
to foster the kinds of political freedoms that make it easy for people
to express what they want and for the government to make a serious
effort to fulfill those wants.</p>
<p>Chile’s last half century was a bit more complex. The country was a
fairly democratic polity from 1960 until 1973, when it was plunged into
a small-coalition regime that lasted until the end of the 1980s. By 1989
it was well on its way back to dependence on a relatively large
coalition to sustain the government. This means that we should expect a
substantially more public goods–oriented approach to seismic activity in
Chile than in Iran at least during the 1960s and since 1990.</p>
<p>Chile experienced an extraordinary 9.5 earthquake in 1960. It killed
1,655 Chileans (as well as 61 in faraway Hawaii following the tsunami
that resulted) and left about 2 million people homeless. Chile’s fairly
democratic government (at the time) immediately set about developing a
new, rigorous seismic code for all new construction to protect its
citizens from such destruction in the future. Left largely unaltered
during the long years of military dictatorship, the code was revisited
in 1993 when the once-again democratic Chile made upgrades to reflect
improvements in technology. A recent study comparing Chile’s seismic
code to conditions in the United States reported that “overall, seismic
design requirements in Chile and the United States are similar.
Standards in Chile are comparable to U.S. codes and standards in regions
of high seismicity during the mid-1990s.”14 It seems that Chile’s
seismic code was not only rigorous but also well enforced, resulting in
greatly enhanced public safety in the face of the ominous threat of
earthquakes.</p>
<p>Unlike Chile, Iran enjoyed no such period of democratic rule during
the last half century. As a result, there was no impetus for the
government to strengthen its policies for protecting the public from
disaster. As reported by the Iranian studies group at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology following the Bam earthquake, “Considering the
high seismicity of Iran, a comprehensive hazard reduction program was
launched in 1991, but the effectiveness of the measures have [sic] been
limited by lack of adequate funding and institutional coordination.… The
principal causes of vulnerability in the region include… inefficient
public policies, and lagging and misguided investments in
infrastructure” (emphasis added).15 Translation: the small-coalition
Iranian regimes of the shah and the ayatollahs have siphoned off funds
for their private benefit instead of directing them toward improved
public security against the predictable threat of seismic disasters.
They provide no means for the people to make clear their desires, and
they take few actions to secure their citizens against the predictable
danger of death and destruction from seismic shocks.</p>
<p>The comparison of Iran and Chile is far from unusual. China, like
Chile, has suffered a 7.9 earthquake of its own. It struck in May 2008,
bringing down many shoddily constructed schools and apartment buildings
and killing nearly seventy thousand people. Even accounting for
variations between Chile’s and China’s populations and incomes, it is
impossible to reconcile the difference between China’s death toll and
Chile’s, except by reflecting on the incentives to enforce proper
building standards in democratic Chile—incentives missing in autocratic
China and Iran. And lest it is thought these are special cases, it is
worth noting that democratic Honduras had a 7.1 earthquake in May 2009
with 6 deaths and Italy a 6.3 in April 2009 with 207 deaths. Even
Japan’s horrendous death toll following its massive 8.9 magnitude
earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 was surely lower than a comparable
event’s death toll would have been in a small-coalition regime. Japan
spent a fortune on quality construction to withstand earthquakes, but
almost no one can afford to protect against a seismic event and tsunami
of the magnitude Japan experienced. Big coalitions save lives because
big-coalition leaders know that if they don’t protect their ordinary
citizens, they’ll be turned out of office in favor of someone who
will.</p>
<p>Earthquakes and tsunamis are hard to foresee. But their aftermath is
not. When there are lots of essential supporters, rescue is swift and
repair is quick and effective. If it isn’t as swift and effective as
people expect—and in large-coalition systems they expect it to be
remarkably swift and effective—then political heads roll. This is what
happened, as we will see later, following Hurricane Katrina in the
United States. We will also see that when there are few essentials, poor
relief does not lead to heads rolling. Rather, autocrats actually prefer
to exaggerate damage to attract more relief funds. Once aid is secured,
it is redirected into the private accounts of political elites rather
than steered toward rebuilding. Consider the relief effort in Sri Lanka
following the tsunami of 2004.</p>
<p>Such differences can be observed within nations too. Edward Luce
toured refugee camps in Tamil Nadu on the east coast of southern India
in the wake of the 2004 tsunami.16 Although fifteen thousand to twenty
thousand people were killed and there was widespread devastation, within
a year virtually everyone had been resettled and the government had
provided compensation for the losses of life and property. The people,
although relatively poor, were kept well informed about the process. The
reason: elections in Tamil Nadu are highly competitive, as the patronage
style of bloc voting that is still prevalent in northern India has
broken down. When Luce toured the more northerly state of Orissa in
2006, he found people still housed in tent villages. But these were not
victims of the 2004 tsunami: they were still coping with the aftermath
of a cyclone that had happened in 1999.</p>
<p>Each of these examples of natural disasters tells a variation upon
the same story. When governments depend on many essentials, they need to
allocate the government’s resources and provide valuable public goods
like reliable building codes, relief efforts to rescue the victims of
disaster, and, when possible, protective barriers like levees and dikes
to forestall disaster. To know what the people need, governments need to
make it easy for the public to make clear what basket of public goodies
they desire. That is best done by allowing the least costly and most
precious public good of all: freedom.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Public goods can be for the public’s good. Yet they can also be a
means of exploiting the public. In large-coalition environments, public
goods overwhelmingly enhance public well-being. In small-coalition
settings this is not true.</p>
<p>Democracies are not lucky. They do not attract civic-minded leaders
by chance. Rather, they attract survival-oriented leaders who understand
that, given their dependence on many essentials, they can only come to
and stay in power if they figure out the right basket of public goods to
provide. Small-coalition leaders figure out their solution to the exact
same survival problem. It is just that when the coalition on which they
rely is small, then the mix of public goods is slimmer and trimmer. It
is designed for survival purposes in both cases.</p>
<p>We don’t need to appeal to civic spirit to explain why people have so
much better a life in a democracy than in an autocracy. Higher levels of
education are accessible to everyone when the coalition is large;
education is basic when the coalition is small. Health care is for those
who are productive when the coalition is small; babies and the elderly
are not excluded from health care when the coalition is large. Good
water is for everyone when the coalition is large; otherwise, it is only
for the privileged. And most importantly, freedom to say what you want
and to dissent when you don’t get it is abundant when the coalition is
large and scarce in the extreme when the coalition is small. Sure,
freedom means that different people can express different points of
view, that they are polarized politically. Better to debate the issues
that create polarization than to suppress dissenting opinions,
pretending that everyone agrees with whatever the government leaders do
for their own good. Large-coalition governments are about easily
throwing the rascals out; they are not about consensus. Dictatorships,
as the word indicates, dictate consensus and punish those who openly
disagree.</p>
<p>After this exploration of the benefits of living in a large-coalition
system, in the next chapter we will see the dark side of democracy—for
large-coalition regimes are not immune from providing private benefits
to a select set of their citizenry. We will also see that corruption is
a boon to small-coalition leaders and that, in fact, corruption,
bribery, and other private benefits to their cronies help
small-coalition leaders stay in power. These same benefits could cost
large-coalition leaders their jobs. That is why the world’s most corrupt
regimes are always small coalition.</p>
