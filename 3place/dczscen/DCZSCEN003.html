<h4 id="chapter-one-the-rules-of-politics">CHAPTER ONE THE RULES OF
POLITICS</h4>
<p>The logic of politics is not complex. In fact, it is surprisingly
easy to grasp most of what goes on in the political world as long as we
are ready to adjust our thinking ever so modestly. To understand
politics properly, we must modify one assumption in particular: we must
stop thinking that leaders can lead unilaterally.</p>
<p>No leader is monolithic. If we are to make any sense of how power
works, we must stop thinking that North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un can do
whatever he wants. We must stop believing that Adolf Hitler or Joseph
Stalin or Genghis Khan or anyone else is in sole control of their
nation. We must give up the notion that Enron’s Kenneth Lay or British
Petroleum’s Tony Hayward knew about everything that was going on in
their companies or that they could have made all the big decisions. All
of these notions are flat-out wrong because no emperor, no king, no
sheikh, no tyrant, no chief executive officer, no family head, no leader
whatsoever can govern alone.</p>
<p>Consider France’s Louis XIV (1638–1715). Known as the Sun King, Louis
reigned as monarch for over seventy years, presiding over the expansion
of France and the creation of the modern political state. Under Louis,
France became the dominant power in continental Europe and a major
competitor in the colonization of the Americas. He and his inner circle
invented a code of law that helped shape the Napoleonic code and that
forms the basis of French law to this day. He modernized the military,
forming a professional standing army that became a role model for the
rest of Europe and, indeed, the world. He was certainly one of the
preeminent rulers of his or any time. But he didn’t do it alone.</p>
<p>The word monarchy may mean “rule by one,” but such rule does not, has
not, and cannot exist. Louis is famously (and probably falsely) thought
to have proclaimed, “L’état, c’est moi” (The state, it is me). This
declaration is often used to describe political life for supposedly
absolute monarchs like Louis, likewise for tyrannical dictators. The
declaration of absolutism, however, is never true. No leader, no matter
how august or how revered, no matter how cruel or vindictive, ever
stands alone. Indeed, Louis XIV, ostensibly an absolute monarch, is a
wonderful example of just how false this idea of monolithic leadership
is.</p>
<p>After the death of his father, Louis XIII (1601–1643), Louis rose to
the throne when he was but four years old. During the early years actual
power resided in the hands of a regent—his mother. Her inner circle
helped themselves to France’s wealth, stripping the cupboard bare. By
the time Louis assumed actual control over the government in 1661, at
the age of twenty-three, the state over which he reigned was nearly
bankrupt.</p>
<p>While most of us think of a state’s bankruptcy as a financial crisis,
looking through the prism of political survival makes evident that it
really amounts to a political crisis. When debt exceeds the ability to
pay, the problem for a leader is not so much that good public works must
be cut back but rather that the incumbent doesn’t have the resources
necessary to purchase political loyalty from key backers. Bad economic
times in a democracy mean too little money to fund pork-barrel projects
that buy political popularity. For kleptocrats they mean passing up vast
sums of money and maybe even watching their secret bank accounts
dwindle, along with the loyalty of their underpaid henchmen.</p>
<p>The prospect of bankruptcy put Louis’s hold on power at risk because
the old-guard aristocrats, including the generals and officers of the
army, saw their sources of money and privilege drying up. Circumstances
were ripe for these politically crucial but fickle friends to seek
someone better able to ensure their wealth and prestige. Faced with such
a danger, Louis needed to make changes or else risk losing his
monarchy.</p>
<p>Louis’s specific circumstances called for altering the group of
people who had the possibility of becoming members of his inner
circle—that is, the group whose support guaranteed his continued dignity
as king. He moved quickly to expand the opportunities (and for a few,
the actual power) of new aristocrats, called the noblesse de robe.
Together with his chancellor, Michel Le Tellier, he acted to create a
professional, relatively meretricious army. In a radical departure from
the practice observed by just about all of his neighboring monarchs,
Louis opened the doors to officer ranks—even at the highest levels—to
make room for many more than the traditional old-guard military
aristocrats, the noblesse d’épée. In so doing, Louis was converting his
army into a more accessible, politically and militarily competitive
organization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Louis had to do something about the old aristocracy. He
was deeply aware of their earlier disloyalty as instigators and backers
of the antimonarchy Fronde (a mix of revolution and civil war) at the
time of his regency. To neutralize the old aristocracy’s potential
threat, he attached them to his court—literally, compelling them to be
physically present in Versailles much of the time. This meant that their
prospects of income from the crown depended on how well favored they
were by the king. And that, of course, depended on how well they served
him.</p>
<p>By elevating so many newcomers, Louis created a new class of people
who were beholden to him. In the process, he centralized his own
authority more fully and enhanced his ability to enforce his views at
the cost of many of the court’s old aristocrats. Thus he erected a
system of “absolute” control whose success depended on the loyalty of
the military and the new aristocrats, and on tying the hands of the old
aristocrats so that his welfare translated directly into their
welfare.</p>
<p>The French populace in general did not figure much into Louis’s
calculations of who needed to be paid off—they did not represent an
imminent threat to him. Even so, it’s clear that his absolutism was not
absolute at all. He needed supporters, and he understood how to maintain
their loyalty. They would be loyal to him only so long as being loyal
was more profitable for them than supporting someone else.</p>
<p>Louis’s strategy was to replace the “winning coalition” of essential
supporters that he inherited with people he could more readily count on.
In place of the old guard, he brought up and into the inner circle
members of the noblesse de robe and even, in the bureaucracy and
especially in the military, some commoners. By expanding the pool of
people who could be in the inner circle, he made political survival for
those already in that role more competitive. Those who were privileged
to be in his winning coalition knew that with the enlarged pool of
candidates for such positions, any one of them could easily be replaced
if they did not prove sufficiently trustworthy and loyal to the king.
That, in turn, meant they could lose their opportunity for wealth,
power, and privilege. Few were foolish enough to take such a risk.</p>
<p>Like all leaders, Louis forged a symbiotic relationship with his
inner circle. He could not hope to thrive in power without their help,
and they could not hope to reap the benefits of their positions without
remaining loyal to him. Loyal they were. Louis XIV survived in office
for seventy-two years until he died quietly of old age in 1715.</p>
<p>Louis XIV’s experience exemplifies the most fundamental fact of
political life. No one rules alone; no one has absolute authority. All
that varies is how many backs have to be scratched and how big the
supply of backs available for scratching is.</p>
<p>THREE POLITICAL DIMENSIONS</p>
<p>For leaders, the political landscape can be broken down into three
groups of people: the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the
winning coalition.</p>
<p>The nominal selectorate includes every person who has at least some
legal say in choosing their leader. In the United States it is everyone
eligible to vote, meaning all citizens aged eighteen and over. Of
course, as every citizen of the United States must realize, the right to
vote is important, but at the end of the day no individual voter has a
lot of say over who leads the country. Members of the nominal
selectorate in a universal-franchise democracy have a toe in the
political door, but not much more. In that specific way, the nominal
selectorate in the United States or Britain or France doesn’t have much
more power than its counterparts, the “voters,” in the old Soviet Union.
There, too, all adult citizens had the right to vote, although their
choice was generally to say yes or no to the candidates chosen by the
Communist Party rather than to pick among candidates. Still, every adult
citizen of the Soviet Union, where voting was mandatory, was a member of
the nominal selectorate.</p>
<p>The second stratum of politics consists of the real selectorate. This
is the group that actually chooses the leader. In today’s China (as in
the old Soviet Union), it consists of all voting members of the
Communist Party; in Saudi Arabia’s monarchy it is the senior members of
the royal family; in Great Britain, the voters backing members of
Parliament from the majority party.</p>
<p>The most important of these groups is the third, the subset of the
real selectorate that makes up the winning coalition. These are the
people whose support is essential if a leader is to survive in office.
In the USSR the winning coalition consisted of a small group of people
inside the Communist Party who chose candidates and who controlled
policy. Their support was essential to keep the commissars and general
secretary in power. These were the folks with the power to overthrow
their boss—and he knew it. In the United States, the winning coalition
for the presidency is vastly larger than in the old Soviet system, but
because of the peculiarities of the Electoral College, it is nowhere
near a majority or even a plurality of voters. For Louis XIV, the
winning coalition was a handful of members of the court, military
officers, and senior civil servants without whom a rival could have
replaced the king.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the nominal selectorate is the pool of potential
support for a leader; the real selectorate includes those whose support
is truly influential; and the winning coalition extends only to those
essential supporters without whom the leader would be finished. A simple
way to think of these groups is as interchangeables, influentials, and
essentials.</p>
<p>In the United States, the voters are the nominal
selectorate—interchangeables. As for the real
selectorate—influentials—the electors of the Electoral College really
choose the president (just as the party faithful picked the general
secretary back in the USSR), but the electors nowadays are normatively
bound to vote the way their state’s voters voted, so they don’t really
have much independent clout in practice. That is true, however, only if
state legislatures do not change the rules for selection of their
electors. If they do—in keeping with the US Constitution, by the
way—then the winning coalition could be much, much smaller. We will come
back to that possibility in Chapter 10 when we consider ways in which
the rules for rulers might be used to distort or undo democracy. In the
United States, the nominal selectorate and real selectorate so far have
been pretty closely aligned. This is why, even though you’re only one
among many voters, interchangeable with others, you still feel like your
vote is influential—that it counts and is counted. The winning
coalition—essentials—in the United States is the smallest bunch of
voters, properly distributed among the states, whose support for a
candidate translates into a presidential win in the Electoral College.
The winning candidate may, of course, garner many more votes than the
essential minimum they need to win the presidency. Those extra voters
plus the essentials make up the support coalition. The support coalition
must not be confused with the winning coalition. As we will see,
essentials get goodies that the excess supporters may not receive. It is
easy to confuse the support coalition and the essential, winning
coalition in a democracy. Their differences are much more obvious when
the essential group is very small.</p>
<p>With the distinction between essentials and the support coalition
firmly in mind, we can see that while the winning coalition (essentials)
is a pretty big fraction of the nominal selectorate (interchangeables)
in the United States, it doesn’t have to be even close to a majority of
the US population. In fact, given the federal structure of American
elections, it’s possible to control the executive and legislative
branches of government with as little as about one-fifth of the vote, if
the votes are really efficiently placed. (Abraham Lincoln—and Donald
Trump—were masters at just such voter efficiency.) Indeed, the absolute
popular vote margin tells us almost nothing in a great many places,
including, distressingly, the United States. Still, it is worth
observing that the United States has one of the world’s biggest winning
coalitions both in absolute numbers and, most importantly, as a
proportion of the electorate. But it is not the biggest. Britain’s
parliamentary structure requires the prime minister to have the support
of a little over 25 percent of the electorate in two-party elections to
Parliament. That is, the prime minister generally needs at least half
the members of Parliament to be from her party and for each of them to
win half the vote (plus one) in each two-party parliamentary race: half
of half of the voters, or one-quarter. France’s runoff system can be
even more demanding. Election requires that a candidate win a majority
in the final, two-candidate runoff, but, of course, to make the runoff
it is only necessary to have one more vote than the third-place
finisher. If, say, ten candidates ran, then getting into the runoff
might require few votes indeed!</p>
<p>Looking elsewhere we see that there can be a vast range in the size
of the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning
coalition. Some places, like North Korea, have a mass nominal
selectorate in which everyone gets to vote—it’s a joke, of course—a tiny
real selectorate that actually picks the leader, and a winning coalition
that surely is no more than maybe a couple of hundred people (if that)
and without whom even North Korea’s first leader, Kim Il-Sung, could
have been reduced to ashes. Other nations, like Saudi Arabia, have tiny
nominal and real selectorates, made up of the royal family and a few
crucial merchants and religious leaders. The Saudi winning coalition is
perhaps even smaller than North Korea’s.</p>
<p>How does Bell, California, measure up? We saw that in 2009, the
interchangeables in Bell consisted of 9,395 registered voters; the
influentials, the 2,235 who actually voted; and the essentials, not more
than the 473 voters whose support was essential to win a seat on the
city council. Bell definitely looks better than North Korea or Saudi
Arabia—we’d hope so. It looks alarmingly close, however, to the setup of
a regime with mostly phony elections, such as today’s Egypt, Venezuela,
Cambodia, and Russia. Most publicly traded corporations have this
structure as well. They have millions of shareholders who are the
interchangeables. They have big institutional shareholders and some
others who are the influentials. And the essentials are pretty much
those who get to pick actual board members and senior management. Bell
doesn’t look much like Madison’s or Montesquieu’s idealization of
democracy, and neither do corporations, regardless of how many
shareholders cast proxy ballots.</p>
<p>Think about the company you work for. Who is your leader? Who are the
essentials whose support he or she must have? What individuals, though
not essential to your CEO’s power, are nonetheless influential in the
governance of the company? And then, of course, who is there every day
at the office—working hard (or not), just hoping for the breakthrough or
the break that will catapult them into a bigger role?</p>
<p>These three groups provide the foundation for all that’s to come in
the rest of this book and, more importantly, the foundation for the
working of politics in all organizations, big and small. Variations in
the sizes of these three groups give politics a three-dimensional
structure that clarifies the complexity of political life. By working
out how these dimensions intersect—that is, each organization’s mix in
the size of its interchangeable, influential, and essential groups—we
can come to grips with the puzzles of politics. Differences in the size
of these groups across states, businesses, and any other organization,
as you will see, decide almost everything that happens in politics—what
leaders can do, what they can and can’t get away with, to whom they
answer, and the relative qualities of life that everyone under them
enjoys (or, too often, doesn’t enjoy).</p>
<p>VIRTUES OF 3-D POLITICS</p>
<p>You may find it hard to believe that just these three dimensions
govern all of the varied systems of leadership in the world. After all,
our experience tends to confirm that on one end of the political
spectrum we have autocrats and tyrants—horrible, selfish thugs who
occasionally stray into psychopathology. On the other end, we have
democrats—elected representatives, presidents, and prime ministers who
we like to think are the benevolent guardians of freedom. Leaders from
these two worlds, we assure ourselves, must be worlds apart!</p>
<p>It’s a convenient fiction but a fiction nonetheless. Governments do
not differ in kind. They differ along the dimensions of their
selectorates and winning coalitions. These dimensions limit or liberate
what leaders can and should do to keep their jobs. How limited or
liberated a leader is depends on how selectorates and winning coalitions
interact.</p>
<p>No question, it is tough to break the habit of talking about
democracies and dictatorships as if either of these terms is sufficient
to convey the differences across regimes, even though no two
“democracies” are alike and neither are any two “dictatorships.” In
fact, it is so hard to break that habit that we will continue to use
these terms much of the time throughout this book—but it is important to
emphasize that the term dictatorship really means a government based on
a particularly small number of essentials drawn from a very large group
of interchangeables and, usually, a relatively small batch of
influentials. On the other hand, if we talk about democracy, we really
mean a government founded on a very large number of essentials and a
very large number of interchangeables, with the influential group being
almost as big as the interchangeable group. When we mention monarchy or
military junta, we have in mind that the number of interchangeables,
influentials, and essentials is small.</p>
<p>The beauty of talking about organizations in terms of essentials,
influentials, and interchangeables is that these categories permit us to
refrain from arbitrarily drawing a line between forms of governance,
pronouncing one “democratic” and another “autocratic,” or one a large
republic and another small, or any of the other mostly one-dimensional
views of politics expressed by some of history’s leading political
philosophers.</p>
<p>The truth is, no two governments or organizations are exactly alike.
No two democracies are alike. Indeed, they can be radically different
one from the other and still qualify perfectly well as democracies. The
more significant and observable differences in the behavior of
governments and organizations depend on the absolute and relative size
of the interchangeable, influential, and essential groups. The seemingly
subtle differences between, say, France’s government and Britain’s, or
Canada’s and the United States’, are not inconsequential. However, the
variations in their policies are the product of the incentives leaders
face as they contend with their particular mix of interchangeable,
influential, and essential groups.</p>
<p>There is incredible variety among political systems, mainly because
people are amazingly inventive in manipulating politics to work to their
advantage. Leaders make rules to give all citizens the vote—creating
lots of new interchangeables—but then impose electoral boundaries,
stacking the deck of essential voters to ensure that their preferred
candidates win. Democratic elites may decide to require a plurality to
win a particular race, giving themselves a way to impose what a majority
may otherwise reject. Or they might favor having runoff elections to
create a majority, even though it may end up being a majority of the
interchangables’ second-place choices. Alternatively, democratic leaders
might represent political views in proportion to how many votes each
view got, forging governments out of coalitions of minorities. Each of
these and countless other rules easily can fall within our definition of
democracy, yet each can—and does—produce radically different
results.</p>
<p>Figure 1.1 makes clear, using a “normalized” measure of coalition
size that varies between 0—the smallest coalition, proportionally
speaking—and 1—the largest proportional coalition—that there is a great
deal of variation in the size of coalitions across places we think of as
democracies and also within each of those countries over time. As the
figure shows us, Costa Rica—surprised?—topped the list for most of the
half-century that is graphed. The United States did excellently most of
the time after about 1976, but it was in decline for several years near
the end of the graph, turning back up around 2020. India plummeted in
the late 1970s when Indira Gandhi worked to amend the constitution to
give herself and her party an electoral advantage. In response, the
voters tossed her out and the coalition expanded back to a solid level.
However, it has begun another retreat as Prime Minister Narendra Modi
works to amend the constitution to tilt representation more in favor of
his supporters. Will India continue to shrink its coalition, or will it
stay in the “democratic” fold? We will have more to say on that later.
The most disturbing element of the graph is that all of the countries
that are plotted saw their coalition size decrease after 2010. So it is
not just that the world has been on a bit of a populist binge; democracy
has been in retreat even in supposedly well-established democratic
societies. Will they self-correct? We think so!</p>
<p>Figure 1.1: No Two Democracies Are Alike</p>
<p>Figure 1.1 urges us to remember that labels like democracy or
dictatorship are a convenience—but only a convenience.</p>
<p>CHANGE THE SIZE OF DIMENSIONS AND CHANGE THE WORLD</p>
<p>Changing the relative size of interchangeables, influentials, and
essentials can make a real difference in basic political outcomes.1 As
an example, we can look to the past, seemingly prosaic election of
members of San Francisco’s board of supervisors.</p>
<p>San Francisco used to elect its board of supervisors in citywide
elections. That meant that the selectorate consisted of the city’s
voters, and the essentials were the minimum number needed to elect a
member to the board. In 1977 the method changed, and at-large, citywide
elections were replaced by district voting. Under the old rules, members
of the board of supervisors were elected by and represented the whole
city as if it were one large constituency. Under the new rules, they
were elected by and represented their district—that is, their
neighborhood—so each supervisor was chosen by a much smaller
constituency. The policy and candidate preferences of San Francisco
residents as a whole were little different between 1975 and 1977;
nevertheless, a candidate named Harvey Milk who failed in his bid to be
elected to the board in 1975 went on to be elected in 1977 (and
tragically assassinated not long after). As Time magazine reported
later, Harvey Milk was “the first openly gay man elected to any
substantial political office in the history of the planet.”2</p>
<p>What changed in Harvey Milk’s favor between 1975 and 1977 was simple
enough. In 1975, he needed broad support among San Francisco’s
influentials to get elected. He got 52,996 votes. This meant he finished
seventh in the election of supervisors, in which the top five were
elected. Milk did not have enough support, and so he lost. In 1977 he
only needed support within the neighborhood from which he ran, the
Castro, a dominantly gay area. He was, as he well knew, popular within
his district. He received 5,925 votes, giving him a plurality of support
with 29.42 percent of the vote in district 5, which placed him first in
the 5th Supervisory District contest, and so he was elected. So in 1977,
with a little more than 10 percent of the votes that he’d garnered in
his losing 1975 campaign, Milk won, thanks to the change in how election
outcomes were determined.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, the same ideas and subtle differences that
held true in San Francisco can be applied to illiberal governments like
Zimbabwe, China, and Cuba, and even to the somewhat more ambiguous sorts
of governments like Russia or Venezuela or Singapore. Each is easily and
uniquely placed on the three organizational dimensions:
interchangeables, influentials, and essentials.</p>
<p>Once we learn to think along these three dimensions, we can begin to
unravel some of politics’ most enduring puzzles. Our starting point is
the realization that any leader worth her salt wants as much power as
she can get, and she wants to keep it for as long as possible. Managing
the interchangeables, influentials, and essentials to that end is the
act, art, and science of governing.</p>
<p>RULES RULING RULERS</p>
<p>Money, it is said, is the root of all evil. That can be true, but in
some cases, money can serve as the root of all that is good about
governance. It depends on what leaders do with the money they generate.
They may use it to benefit everyone, as is largely true for expenditures
directed toward protecting the personal well-being of all citizens and
their property. Much public policy can be thought of as an effort to
invest in the welfare of the people. But government revenue can also be
spent on buying the loyalty of a few key cronies at the expense of
general welfare. It can also be used to promote corruption, black
marketeering, and a host of even less pleasant policies.</p>
<p>The first step in understanding how politics really works is to ask
what kinds of policies leaders spend money on. Do they spend it on
public goods that benefit everyone? Or do they spend mostly on private
goods that benefit only a few? The answer, for any savvy politician,
depends on how many people the leader needs to keep loyal—that is, the
number of essentials in the coalition.</p>
<p>In a democracy, or any other system where a leader’s critical
coalition is really large, it becomes too costly to buy loyalty
exclusively through private rewards. The money has to be spread too
thinly. So more democratic types of governments, dependent as they are
on large coalitions, tend to emphasize spending to create effective
public policies that improve general welfare pretty much as suggested by
James Madison. In such a government there is little difference between
the benefits enjoyed by the winning coalition, the larger support
coalition, and the people in general.</p>
<p>By contrast, dictators, monarchs, military junta leaders, and most
CEOs all rely on a smaller set of essentials. As intimated by
Machiavelli, it is more efficient for them to govern by spending a chunk
of revenue to buy the loyalty of their coalition through private
benefits, even though these benefits come at the expense of the larger
taxpaying public or millions of small shareholders. Thus small
coalitions encourage stable, corrupt, private goods–oriented regimes in
which the essentials do great while even the broader support coalition
does pretty poorly. The choice between enhancing social welfare and
enriching a privileged few is not a question of how benevolent a leader
is. Honorable motives might seem important, but they are overwhelmed by
the need to keep essential supporters happy, and the means of keeping
them happy depends on how many need rewarding.</p>
<p>TAXING</p>
<p>To keep backers happy a leader needs money. Anyone aspiring to rule
must first ask how much he can extract from his constituents—whether
they are citizens of a nation or shareholders in a corporation. This
extraction can take many forms—personal income taxes, property taxes,
duties on imports, licenses, and government fees—but we will refer to it
generically as taxation to keep the discussion from wandering too far
afield. As we’ve already seen, those who rule based on a large coalition
cannot efficiently sustain themselves in power by focusing on private
benefits. Their bloc of essential supporters is too large for that.
Since they must sustain themselves by emphasizing public goods more than
private rewards, they must also keep tax rates low, relatively speaking.
People prefer to keep their money for themselves, except when that money
can be pooled to provide something they value that they cannot afford to
buy on their own.</p>
<p>For example, we all want to be sure that a reliable fire department
will put out a fire that threatens our home. We could conceivably hire a
personal firefighter to protect our house alone. However, not only is
that expensive, but we would also have to worry about whether our
neighbor’s house is well enough protected that it won’t catch fire and
threaten our home. Furthermore, our neighbor, realizing that we won’t
want his house to burn if in doing so it threatens ours, may attempt to
hitch a free ride on the fact that we hired a personal firefighter who
will have to step in to protect the neighbor’s house as well. In no time
we are in the position of paying for neighborhood-wide fire protection
single-handedly, a very costly proposition. The easiest way to get
neighbors to share the burden of fire protection is to let government
leaders take the responsibility for fire protection. To provide such
protection we happily pay taxes.</p>
<p>Though we may willingly pay taxes for programs that provide tangible
benefits to us, such as protection from fire, felons, and foreign foes,
we would not be so willing to see our tax money used to pay a tremendous
salary to our president or prime minister—or, in the case of Bell,
California, to our local government officials. As a result, heads of
governments reliant on a large coalition tend not to be among the
world’s best-paid executives.</p>
<p>Because the acceptable uses of taxation in a regime that depends on a
large coalition are few—just those expenditures thought to buy more
welfare than people can buy on their own—taxes tend to be low when
coalitions are large. But when the coalition of essential backers is
small and private goods are an efficient way to stay in power, then the
well-being of the broader population falls by the wayside, contrary to
the view expressed by Hobbes. In this setting leaders want to tax
heavily, redistributing wealth by taking as much as they can from the
poor interchangeables and the disenfranchised and giving that wealth to
the members of the winning coalition, making them fat, rich, and loyal.
Chapter 4 will show us that taxes really are higher in autocracies than
in democracies once we compare apples to apples. That will help explain
why per capita incomes are typically much higher in societies with lots
of essentials than in those with few.</p>
<p>Obviously, self-interest plays a large role in taxation and spending
equations. We must wonder, therefore, why incumbents don’t take all the
revenue they’ve raised and sock it away in their personal bank accounts.
This question is especially pertinent for corporate executives. Once
investors have entrusted money in the hands of a CEO or chairman of the
board, what can the investors do to assure themselves that the money
will be invested wisely to produce benefits for them? Investors want
increased value. They want share prices to rise, their portion of
ownership to go up, and dividend payments to be large and predictably
regular. To be sure, focusing on self-interest tells us that rulers and
business leaders, and in fact all of us, would love to take other
people’s money and keep it for ourselves, much as Robert Rizzo and his
cronies did. This means that the next step in explaining the calculus of
politics is to figure out how much a leader can keep and how much must
be spent on the coalition and on the public if the incumbent is to stay
in power.</p>
<p>SHUFFLING THE ESSENTIAL DECK</p>
<p>Staying in power, as we now know, requires the support of others.
This support is only forthcoming if a leader provides his essentials
with more benefits than they might expect to receive under alternative
leadership or government. When essential followers expect to be better
off under the wing of some political challenger, they desert.</p>
<p>Incumbents have a tough job. They need to offer their supporters more
than any rival can. While this can be difficult, the logic of politics
tells us that incumbents have a huge advantage over rivals, especially
when officeholders rely on relatively few people and when the pool of
replacements for coalition members is large. Lenin designed precisely
such a political system in Russia after the revolution. This explains
why, from the October 1917 revolution through to Gorbachev’s reforms in
the late 1980s, only one Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, was
successfully deposed in a coup. All the other Soviet leaders died of old
age or infirmity, but Khrushchev failed to deliver what he’d promised to
his cronies. It is the successful, reliable implementation of political
promises to those who count that provides the basis for any incumbent’s
advantage.</p>
<p>The story of survival is not much different, although the particulars
are very different, in political settings that rely on many essential
backers. As even a casual observer of election campaigns knows, there is
a big discrepancy between what politicians promise when making a bid for
power and what they actually deliver. Once in power, a new leader might
well discard those who helped her get to the top and replace them with
others whom she deems more loyal.</p>
<p>Not only that, but essential supporters can’t just compare what the
challenger and incumbent each offer today. The incumbent might pay less
now, for instance, but the pay is expected to continue for those kept on
or brought into the new incumbent’s inner circle. True, the challenger
may offer more today, but his promises of future rewards may be nothing
more than political promises without any real substance behind them.
Essentials must compare the benefits expected to come their way in the
future because that future flow adds up in time to bigger rewards.
Placing a supporter in his coalition after a leader is ensconced as the
new incumbent is a good indicator that he will continue to rely on and
reward that supporter, exactly because the new incumbent has made a
concerted effort to sort out those most likely to remain loyal from
opportunists who might bring him down in the future. The challenger
might promise to keep backers on if she reaches the heights of power,
but it is a political promise that might very well not be honored in the
long run.</p>
<p>Lest there be doubt that those who share the risks of coming to power
are often thrown aside—or worse—let us reflect on the all-too-typical
case of the backers of Fidel Castro’s revolution in Cuba. Of the
twenty-one ministers appointed by Castro in January 1959, immediately
after the success of his revolution, twelve had resigned or been ousted
by the end of the year. Four more were removed in 1960 as Castro further
consolidated his hold on power. These people, once among Fidel’s
closest, most intimate backers, ultimately faced the two big “exes” of
politics. For the luckier among them, divorce from Castro came in the
form of exile. For others, it meant execution. This included even
Castro’s most famous fellow revolutionary, Che Guevara.</p>
<p>Che may have been second in power only to Fidel himself. Indeed, that
was likely his greatest fault. Castro forced Che out of Cuba in 1965
partly because of Che’s popularity, which made him a potential rival for
authority. Castro sent Che on a mission to Bolivia, but toward the end
of March 1967 Castro simply cut off Guevara’s support, leaving him
stranded. Captain Gary Prado Salmon, the Bolivian officer who captured
Che, confirmed that Guevara told him that the decision to come to
Bolivia was not his own; it was Castro’s. One of Fidel’s biographers
remarked,</p>
<p>In a very real sense Che followed in the shadows of Frank Pais,
Camilo Cienfuegos, Huber Matos, and Humberto Sori Marin [all close
backers of Castro during the revolution]. Like them, he was viewed by
Castro as a “competitor” for power and like them, he had to be moved
aside “in one manner or another.” Che Guevara was killed in Bolivia but
at least he escaped the ignominy of execution by his revolutionary ally,
Fidel Castro. Humberto Sori Marin was not so “fortunate.” Marin, the
commander of Castro’s rebel army, was accused of conspiring against the
revolution. In April 1961, like so many other erstwhile backers of Fidel
Castro, he too was executed.3</p>
<p>Political transitions are filled with examples of supporters who help
a leader to power only to be replaced. This is true whether we look at
national or local governments, corporations, organized crime families,
or, for that matter, any other organization. Each member of a winning
coalition, knowing that many are standing on the sidelines to replace
them, will be careful not to give the incumbent reasons to look for
replacements.</p>
<p>This was the relationship Louis XIV managed so well. If a small bloc
of backers is needed and can be drawn from a large pool of potential
supporters (as with the small coalition needed in places like Zimbabwe,
North Korea, or Afghanistan), then the incumbent doesn’t need to spend a
huge proportion of the regime’s revenue to buy the coalition’s loyalty.
On the other hand, more must be spent to keep the coalition loyal if
there are relatively few people who could replace its members. That is
true in two circumstances: when the coalition and real selectorate are
both small (as in a monarchy or military junta), or the coalition and
selectorate (whether real or nominal) are both large (as in a
democracy). In these circumstances, the incumbent’s ability to replace
coalition members is pretty constrained. Essentials can therefore drive
up the price for staying loyal. The upshot is that there is less revenue
available to be spent at the incumbent’s discretion because more has to
be spent to keep the coalition loyal, fending off credible counteroffers
by political foes.</p>
<p>When the ratio of essentials to interchangeables is small (as in
rigged-election autocracies and most publicly traded corporations),
coalition loyalty is purchased cheaply and incumbents have massive
discretion. They can choose to spend the money they control on
themselves or on pet public projects. Kleptocrats, of course, sock the
money away in secret bank accounts or in offshore investments to serve
as a rainy-day fund in the event that they are overthrown. A few
civic-minded autocrats slip a little into secret accounts, preferring to
fend off the threat of revolt by using their discretionary funds (the
leftover tax revenue not spent on coalition loyalty) to invest in public
works. Those public works may prove successful, as was true for Lee Kuan
Yew’s efforts in Singapore and Deng Xiaoping’s in China. They may also
prove to be dismal failures, as was true for Kwame Nkrumah’s
civic-minded industrial program in Ghana and Mao Zedong’s Great Leap
Forward, which turned out to be a great leap backward for China.</p>
<p>We have seen how the desire to survive in office shapes some key
revenue-generation decisions, key allocation decisions, and the pot of
money at the incumbent’s discretion. Whether the tax rate is high or
low, whether money is spent more on public or private rewards, and how
much is spent in whatever way the incumbent wants all dictate political
success within the confines of the governance structure the leader
inherits or creates. And our notion of governing for political survival
tells us that there are five basic rules leaders can use to succeed in
any system:</p>
<p>RULE 1: Keep your winning coalition as small as possible. A small
coalition allows a leader to rely on very few people to stay in power.
Fewer essentials equals more control and contributes to more discretion
over expenditures.</p>
<p>Bravo for Kim Jong-Un of North Korea. He is a contemporary master at
ensuring dependence on a small coalition. Bravo to Donald Trump. He
tried to shrink the coalition by manipulating vote counting in the
world’s oldest democracy. That’s not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>RULE 2: Keep your nominal selectorate as large as possible. Maintain
a large selectorate of interchangeables and you can easily replace any
troublemakers in your coalition, influentials and essentials alike.
After all, a large nominal selectorate provides a big supply of
substitute supporters to put the essentials on notice that they should
be loyal and well behaved or else face being replaced.</p>
<p>Bravo to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin for introducing universal adult
suffrage in Russia’s old rigged election system. Lenin mastered the art
of creating a vast supply of interchangeables. Boo to Donald Trump. He
foolishly tried to suppress turnout by America’s interchangeables,
inducing more people to turn out to vote in 2020 and swelling the size
of the selectorate, which resulted in his unintentionally swelling the
size of the essential coalition needed for victory in 2020, making it
bigger than had been true in 2016. Big error!</p>
<p>RULE 3: Control the flow of revenue. It’s always better for a ruler
to determine who eats than it is to have a larger pie from which the
people can feed themselves. The most effective cash flow for leaders is
one that makes lots of people poor and redistributes money to keep
select people—their supporters—wealthy.</p>
<p>Bravo to Pakistan’s former president, Asif Ali Zardari, estimated to
be worth up to billion even as he governed a country near the world’s
bottom in per capita income. Bravo to Donald Trump. He found a way to
tax his foes (Democrats) heavily while lightening the tax burden on his
supporters (especially wealthy Republicans).</p>
<p>RULE 4: Pay your key supporters just enough to keep them loyal.
Remember, your backers would rather be you than be dependent on you.
Your big advantage over them is that you know where the money is and
they don’t. Give your coalition just enough that they don’t shop around
for someone to replace you and not a penny more.</p>
<p>Bravo to Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, who, whenever facing a threat of a
military coup, managed to pay his army, keeping their loyalty against
all odds well into his nineties.</p>
<p>RULE 5: Don’t take money out of your supporters’ pockets to make the
people’s lives better. The flip side of rule 4 is not to be too cheap
toward your coalition of essential supporters. If you’re good to the
people at the expense of your coalition, it won’t be long until your
“friends” will be gunning for you. Effective policy for the masses
doesn’t necessarily produce loyalty among essentials, and it’s darn
expensive to boot. Hungry people are not likely to have the energy to
overthrow you, so don’t worry about them. Disappointed coalition
members, in contrast, can defect, leaving you in deep trouble.</p>
<p>Bravo to Senior General Than Shwe of Myanmar, who made sure following
Cyclone Nargis in 2008 that food relief was controlled and sold on the
black market by his military supporters rather than letting aid go to
the people—at least 138,000 and maybe as many as 500,000 of whom died in
the disaster.4</p>
<p>DO THE RULES WORK IN DEMOCRACIES?</p>
<p>At this point, you may be saying, Hold on! If an elected leader
followed these rules she’d be out of the job in no time flat. That’s
almost right, but not quite. Donald Trump followed all but one of these
rules about as closely as any freely elected leader in modern history,
and he was voted out after one term. Breaking even one rule is dangerous
for anyone, including democratically elected leaders.</p>
<p>As we’ll see throughout the chapters to follow, a democratic leader
does indeed have a really tough time maintaining her position while
looting her country and siphoning off funds. She’s constrained by the
laws of the land, which also determine—through election procedures—the
size of the coalition that she needs in order to come to power. The
coalition has to be relatively large and she has to be responsive to it,
so she does have a problem with rule 1. But that doesn’t mean she
doesn’t try to follow rule 1 as closely as she can (and all of the other
rules too).</p>
<p>Why, for example, do state legislatures gerrymander districts?
Precisely because of rule 1: Keep the coalition as small as
possible.</p>
<p>Why do some political parties favor immigration? Rule 2: Expand the
number of interchangeables, a rule Donald Trump did not adequately
understand and manipulate.</p>
<p>Why are there so many battles over the tax code? Rule 3: Take control
of the sources of revenue.</p>
<p>Why do Democrats spend so much tax money on welfare and social
programs? Or why on earth do we have earmarks? Rule 4: Reward your
essentials at all costs.</p>
<p>Why do Republicans wish the top tax rate were lower and have so many
problems with the idea of national health care? Rule 5: Don’t rob your
supporters to give to your opposition.</p>
<p>Just like autocrats and tyrants, leaders of democratic nations try to
follow these rules because they, like every other leader, want to get
power and keep it. Even democrats almost never step down unless they’re
forced to.5 The problem for democrats is that they face different
constraints and have to be a little more creative than their autocratic
counterparts. And they succeed less often. Even though they generally
provide a much higher standard of living for their citizens than do
tyrants, democrats generally have shorter terms in office.</p>
<p>Political distinctions are truly continuous across the intersection
of the three dimensions that govern how organizations work. Some “kings”
in history have actually been elected. Some “democrats” rule their
nations with the authority of a despot. In other words, the distinction
between autocrats and democrats isn’t cut-and-dried.</p>
<p>Having laid the foundation for our new theory of politics and having
revealed the five rules of leadership, we’ll turn to the big questions
at the heart of the book, often using the terms autocrats and democrats
throughout, to show how the games of leadership change as you slide from
one extreme to the other on the spectrum of small and large coalitions.
But just remember, there’s always a little mix of both words regardless
of the country or organization in question. The lessons from both
extremes apply whether you’re talking about Saddam Hussein or George
Washington. After all, the old saw still holds true—politicians are all
the same.</p>
