<h4 id="chapter-three-staying-in-power">CHAPTER THREE STAYING IN
POWER</h4>
<p>At long last, the aspirant to high office has triumphed. Whether
through inheritance, coup, election, revolt, murder, or mayhem, he has
seized power. Now he faces a new challenge: hanging on to it.</p>
<p>As Sergeant Doe’s brutal career has taught us, rising to a high
position often requires skills altogether different from those needed to
maintain control. And even the rules for surviving in power do not
always resemble the skills necessary for ruling well. The novelist Italo
Calvino has clearly and succinctly described the tribulations of those
who have risen to power: “The throne, once you have been crowned, is
where you had best remain seated, without moving, day and night. All
your previous life has been only a waiting to become king; now you are
king; you have only to reign. And what is reigning if not this long
wait? Waiting for the moment when you will be deposed, when you will
have to take leave of the throne, the scepter, the crown, and your
head.”1</p>
<p>What, then, must a newly minted leader do to keep his (or her) head?
A good starting place is shoring up the coalition of supporters. This
may seem like a simple enough task. After all, as we’ve seen, the
heights of power are unattainable without the backing of a coalition
strong enough to beat back rivals. However, a wise leader does not count
too much on those who helped her gain power. Remember the fate of many
of Fidel Castro’s closest allies. After toppling the previous leader,
it’s only a matter of time until they realize that they can do the same
again.</p>
<p>A prudent new incumbent will act swiftly to get some of them out of
the way and bring in others whose interests more strongly assure their
future loyalty. Only after sacking, shuffling, and shrinking their
particular set of essentials can leaders assure their future tenure.</p>
<p>Nor is this only true of dictators. To see this urge to build a
modified coalition at work in the seemingly less ferocious world of
business, let’s take a look at Carly Fiorina’s rise and fall as CEO at
Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>GOVERNANCE IN PURSUIT OF HEADS</p>
<p>CEOs, just like national leaders, are susceptible to removal. Being
vulnerable to a coup, they need to modify the corporate coalition
(usually the board of directors and senior management) by bringing in
loyalists and getting rid of potential troublemakers. Usually they have
a large potential pool of people to draw from and prior experience to
help guide their choices. But, also like national leaders, they face
resistance from some members of their inherited coalition, and that may
be hard to overcome.</p>
<p>Most publicly traded corporations have millions of interchangeables
(their shareholders), a considerably smaller set of influentials (big
individual shareholders and institutional shareholders), and a small
group of essentials, often not more than ten to fifteen people. In a
group of this size, even seemingly minor variations in the number of
coalition members can have profound consequences for how a company is
run. As we will see, this was particularly true for Hewlett-Packard
(HP), because, as in all companies, small shifts in coalition numbers
can lead to large percentage changes in the expected mix of corporate
rewards.</p>
<p>In the case of HP, the CEO’s winning coalition made up a relatively
large fraction of the real selectorate because ownership is heavily
concentrated in a few hands. That is, we might count corporate coalition
size in terms of the number of its members or in terms of the number of
shares they own. In HP’s case, the essential bloc and the influential
bloc have very few members compared to the total selectorate because the
families of the company’s founders, William Hewlett and David Packard,
retain significant ownership, just as was true of Ford Motor Company,
Hallmark Cards, and quite a few other businesses for many years.</p>
<p>Involvement in a corporation can yield benefits, just like
involvement in any form of government. These benefits can take the form
of rewards given to everyone or private payments directed just to the
essentials. In a corporate setting, private benefits typically come as
personal compensation in the form of salary, perks, and stock options.
Rewards to everyone—what economists call “public goods”—take the shape
of dividends (an equal amount per share) and increased stock value. When
the winning coalition is sufficiently large that private rewards are an
inefficient mechanism for the CEO to buy the loyalty of essentials,
public goods tend to be the benefit of choice. Usually, coalition
members are eager to receive private benefits. However, dividends and
growth in share value are preferred over private rewards by very large
shareholders who also happen to be in the winning coalition—this makes
them the biggest recipients of the rewards that go to all shareholders.
That was precisely the situation in HP, where the Hewlett and Packard
families owned a substantial percentage of the company.</p>
<p>Who makes up the essentials in a corporation? The coalition typically
includes no more than a few people in senior management and the members
of the board of directors. The board usually includes a mix of senior
managers in the company, representatives from large institutional
shareholders, handpicked friends and relatives of the CEO (generally
described as “civic leaders,” no doubt), and the CEO herself. In the
parlance of economists who study corporations, the makeup of these
boards boils down to insiders (employees), gray members (friends,
relatives), and outsiders. One part of any corporate board’s duties is
to appoint, retain, or remove CEOs. Generally CEOs keep their job for a
long time, and that certainly was true of HP’s first CEO, founder David
Packard. He was replaced in 1992 by an insider, Lewis Platt, who had
worked for the firm since the 1960s. Platt retired in 1999 and was
replaced by outsider Carly Fiorina. The HP board has repeatedly deposed
CEOs since then.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that any board members involved in deposing the
former CEO have the potential to be a problem for a new CEO. Since they
have already been coup makers, there is little reason to doubt that they
stand ready to start trouble once again if they think the circumstances
warrant it. And what could those circumstances be but application of one
or more of the rules of governance we set out earlier, especially if
that application harms their interests?</p>
<p>Research into CEO longevity teaches us, not surprisingly, that time
in office lengthens as one maintains close personal ties to members of
the board. Just as sons and daughters may make attractive inheritors of
the mantle of power in a dictatorship, friends, relatives, and fellow
employees can generate the expectation of more loyal supporters after
power is achieved. This logic probably contributed to Lewis Platt’s
elevation to CEO of HP. Putting more outsiders on a board translates on
average into better returns for shareholders, a benefit to everyone. At
the same time, it also translates into greater risk for the CEO.2 Since
the CEO’s interest is rarely the same as the shareholders’ interest,
CEOs prefer to avoid outsider board members if they can.</p>
<p>Corporate problems, especially those serious enough to result in the
ousting of a sitting CEO, can serve to galvanize attention and enhance
oversight by the board, making existing coalitions less reliable.
Furthermore, it is likely that the new CEO will face real impediments to
his efforts to create and shape a board of directors in the wake of an
older CEO’s deposition. After all, the old board members did not get rid
of the prior incumbent with the idea that they would also make it easy
for the successor CEO to get rid of them. Nevertheless, any new CEO
worth her salt will try to do just that. The long-lasting CEOs are the
ones who succeed.</p>
<p>Carly Fiorina became Hewlett-Packard’s CEO in 1999. After six
turbulent years she was deposed from that position and as chairwoman of
the board. Prior to being removed she was the target of an unsuccessful
proxy fight mounted by Walter Hewlett and David Woodley Packard, sons of
HP’s founders. The board, in keeping with the power of inherited insider
influence, also included Susan Orr, founder David Packard’s daughter.
All were individuals with big financial stakes in HP. Furthermore, as
big shareholders Hewlett, Packard, and Orr were more concerned about
HP’s overall performance than about any private benefits they got from
being on the board. Good news for shareholders—potentially bad news for
Fiorina.</p>
<p>The board that selected Fiorina as CEO consisted of fourteen members.
As we’ve seen, three were relatives of HP’s founders; three more were
current or retired HP employees.3 Fiorina’s initial board, in other
words, had a substantial group of insiders and gray members who were not
of her choosing and who had big stakes in the corporation’s stock value.
It is not hard to see that Carly Fiorina needed to make changes to build
a leaner board with stronger attachments to her. It would not be
easy—while the board had selected her to be CEO, they were not her
handpicked loyalists.</p>
<p>She achieved results nonetheless. A year after Fiorina’s ascension,
in 2000, HP’s proxy statement to its shareholders listed only eleven
board members, 20 percent fewer than the group that selected her. Three,
including David Woodley Packard, were gone. As Fiorina became more
entrenched in her position, the board continued to shrink—the 2001
statement listed only ten board members, a reduction of nearly 30
percent from the board she’d originally inherited. Seemingly growing
more secure in her control, Fiorina launched an effort to merge HP with
Compaq, an effort with both beneficial prospects and serious risks for
her continued rule.</p>
<p>Naturally, Fiorina presented the merger as a boon for HP and its
shareholders. As Fiorina explained in a speech at a conference on
February 4, 2002, “It is a rare opportunity when a technology company
can advance its market position substantially and reduce its cost
structure substantially at the same time. And this is possible because
Compaq and HP are in the same businesses, pursuing the same strategies,
in the same markets, with complementary capabilities. So, yes, we
thought about a go-slow approach. But, we concluded, after
two-and-a-half years of careful deliberation and preparation, that
standing still had enormous risks.… Standing still means choosing the
path of retreat, not leadership.”4</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Fiorina’s expectations
for the Compaq merger. But it is instructive to examine a major
indicator of how Fiorina’s appointment and her views meshed with broader
market sentiments. The day before the announcement of Carly Fiorina’s
appointment as HP’s new CEO, HP’s shares traded at 3.43. The market’s
reaction to her appointment can reasonably be described as uncertain.
The price of HP shares was flat immediately following the announcement
and then began to decline, falling to under 9 by mid-October 1999, about
three months later. Of course, markets are forward looking, and so
investors were watching and learning, modifying their expectations as
Fiorina took charge. The news and modified expectations must have been
good for a while because by early April 2000, HP’s shares had risen
markedly, to about 8. But good feelings and good circumstances were not
to prevail for long. After April 7, 2000, the share price went into a
tailspin, bottoming out in September 2002 at around 2 a share and
significantly underperforming the major stock market indexes. By the
time Fiorina resigned in February 2005, HP’s share price had only
rebounded to about 0.</p>
<p>With respect to the Compaq merger, the market was similarly
pessimistic. The plan to merge with Compaq was announced on September 3,
2001. Share prices rose on the news, with a peak in December of that
year of about 3, though that was still well below the value the day
before Carly Fiorina became CEO. Over the period from July 1999 (the
announcement of Fiorina’s appointment) to the end of December 2001, the
adjusted Dow Jones index fell 9.4 percent while HP’s adjusted share
price fell 47 percent.</p>
<p>From the perspective of any big investor in HP, including the Hewlett
and Packard families, Fiorina must have looked like a disaster. Their
company was doing worse than the general stock market; their fortunes
were being hammered. She was a CEO in trouble. Nevertheless, the upward
tick in the share value indicated a renewed, if temporary, boost of
optimism at the announced intention to merge with Compaq. But markets
don’t like infighting, and when Walter Hewlett and David Woodley Packard
declared their opposition to the merger, the gains were reversed. Soon
the price collapsed even further, halving as it became apparent that
there was to be a proxy fight in which Hewlett and Packard sought to
muster support from enough shareholders to defeat the board’s proposed
slate at the corporation’s annual meeting. No doubt Fiorina realized
that she was going to be in for a tough time, perhaps even before her
public announcement of the intended and eventually successfully
completed merger. It also seems likely that she would already have known
Hewlett’s and Packard’s views. We can only conclude that this was an
intentional gamble on a major policy shift, one that could—and
did—adversely affect the wealth of HP’s large shareholders (such as
now-former board members Hewlett and Packard).</p>
<p>Looking at the Compaq-HP merger politically, we can see several
critical themes emerging. Fiorina was already in some trouble because of
declining share value. She had successfully diminished the board’s size
and shuffled its membership, both wise choices for a CEO seeking
longevity in office. Yet despite these actions, she still faced
significant opposition from the inner circle of essentials and
influentials. She had not yet secured the board’s loyalty. The Compaq
merger might have made good business sense and could therefore have been
good for the stock price, thus softening internal opposition to her. Or
else, seeing the merger as a fait accompli, her opponents might have
given up their fight. That didn’t happen. And the disgruntled board
members, heavily invested as they were in HP’s stock value, could not be
mollified with private rewards.</p>
<p>However, what in retrospect may seem like a political nonstarter held
at the time great political advantages. For instance, what had to be an
implication of Fiorina’s multibillion-dollar merger with Compaq for the
board composition? Once the deal was sealed, Fiorina would have to bring
some Compaq leaders onto the postmerger HP board. This could be done
either by expanding the existing board to accommodate Compaq
influentials or by pruning the existing board to make room for the new
Compaq representatives drawn from Compaq’s selectorate. Fiorina
apparently saw that the merger would provide an opportunity to
reconstitute the board and potentially weaken the board faction that
opposed her. That seems to be exactly what she tried to do.</p>
<p>Of course, her rivals would not sit idly by and be purged. Unless
such a purge can be accomplished in the dark, presented as a fait
accompli to the old group of influentials, the risk of failure is real.
As it happens, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations require
disclosures, which makes turning a board purge into a fait accompli
extremely difficult when the opportunity to purge the board depends on a
prospective merger.</p>
<p>There are two potential responses to a rebellion such as the one
Fiorina faced over HP’s weak share price and the Compaq merger. CEOs can
either purge some essentials and boost the private benefits to remaining
coalition members, or they can expand the coalition and increase rewards
to the general selectorate of interchangeables (that is, shareholders).
Having survived the proxy fight in 2002, Fiorina faced an eleven-member
board that included five new members carried over from Compaq as part of
the merger. HP’s board had shifted materially, with only six previous HP
board members on it. Since Fiorina had been the mover and shaker behind
the Compaq deal, it is reasonable to believe that she assumed the new
members would be likely to work with her as opposed to lining up with
board members who had supported Walter Hewlett’s fight against the
merger. Walter Hewlett and Robert P. Wayman, meanwhile, had left the
board. By this time, in 2002, Fiorina had expanded the total board size
by only one, from ten to eleven, while overseeing the departure of
several old board members at the same time to make room for five Compaq
representatives. Surely she had reason to believe she now enjoyed the
support of a majority of the new board.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an effort to shore up the support of remaining old hands
on the board, or perhaps coincidentally, there also was a notable shift
in board compensation. Just before Fiorina became HP’s head, board
members earned compensation (that is, private benefits) that ranged from
05,700 to 10,700. With Fiorina in office and the board diminished in
size, this amount dropped slightly to 00,000–05,000 and remained there
in the years 2000–2003. But in 2004, according to HP’s 2005 proxy
statement, board members received between 00,000 and 20,000. During the
same period, dividends remained steady at thirty-two cents a share
annually and HP’s shares significantly underperformed the main stock
market indexes. Clearly something was up: HP’s stock price performance
was poor; dividends were steady; and directors’ pay had doubled.</p>
<p>Fiorina’s board shuffling and their improved compensation seem aimed
at getting the right loyalists in place to help her survive. Although
the Compaq merger resulted in the board’s growing from ten to eleven,
what is most noteworthy is that this net growth of one member was
achieved while adding five new members (one of whom stepped down at the
end of the year). So the old members constituted only about half the
board, shifting the potential balance of power toward Fiorina.
Presumably that is just what she hoped, although it is not how things
turned out.</p>
<p>Expanding the board was not, and generally is not, the optimal
response to a threat from within. To her credit, in terms of political
logic, she significantly expanded the size of the interchangeables by
adding Compaq’s shareholders to HP’s shareholders. This normally helps
to induce strengthened loyalty, but declining share value could not have
been good for new HP board members who had been heavily invested in
Compaq, since their economic well-being was now tied to HP’s share
performance. Nor could Fiorina mollify HP’s large shareholders on the
board with better board compensation, since their welfare depended on
producing the public good of greater returns to shareholders. Those gray
board members who owned lots of shares made the seemingly small board of
eleven actually pretty large in terms of shares they could vote.</p>
<p>Under enormous pressure, Carly Fiorina stepped down. She was replaced
by Patricia Dunn as chairwoman, with HP’s chief financial officer,
Robert Wayman, emerging again as a significant HP player. He was made
interim CEO. Wayman, unable or uninterested in translating his interim
position into a full-time job, stepped down a month later while
continuing in his role as a member of the board and an HP employee. Mark
Hurd replaced him as CEO.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of Fiorina’s ouster, the board separated
two key positions, CEO and chairperson, presumably in a good
Montesquieu-like effort to promote the separation of powers and protect
themselves against future adverse choices by the CEO. If that was their
intention, they certainly failed. Following Hurd’s ascent to the
position of CEO, he successfully brought the two posts back under one
person’s control: his own.</p>
<p>Within a year of Fiorina’s ouster, all the leading coup makers who
acted against her were gone. Mark Hurd had risen to the top, and, as
suggested by the quote from Italo Calvino, he had to watch day and night
to keep his head. Four years later, despite stellar HP performance, Hurd
was forced out amid a personal scandal. This is the essential lesson of
politics: in the end, ruling is the objective, not ruling well.</p>
<p>THE PERILS OF MERITOCRACY</p>
<p>One lesson to be learned from Mark Hurd’s ultimate removal at HP is
that doing a good job is not enough to ensure political survival. That
is true whether one is running a business, a charity, or a national
government. How much a leader’s performance influences the length of his
tenure in office is a highly subjective matter. It might seem obvious
that it is important to have people in the coalition of key backers who
are competent at implementing the leader’s policies. But autocracy isn’t
about good governance. It’s about what’s good for the leader, not what’s
good for the people. In fact, having competent ministers or competent
corporate board members can be a dangerous mistake. Competent people,
after all, are potential (and potentially competent) rivals.</p>
<p>The three most important characteristics of a coalition are (1)
loyalty, (2) loyalty, and (3) loyalty. Successful leaders surround
themselves with trusted friends and family, and rid themselves of any
ambitious supporters. Carly Fiorina had a hard time achieving that
objective, and as a result she failed to last long. Fidel Castro, by
contrast, was a master (of course, he had fewer impediments to overcome
in what he could do than did Fiorina), and he lasted in power for nearly
half a century.</p>
<p>The implications of this aspect of political logic are profound,
particularly in small-coalition governments. Saddam Hussein in Iraq,
like Idi Amin in Uganda and so many other national leaders, started as a
street thug. Autocrats don’t need West Point graduates to protect them.
Once in power, people like Amin and Hussein wisely surround themselves
with trusted members of their own tribe or clan, installing them in the
most important positions—those involving force and money—and killing
anyone who may turn out to be a rival.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein came to power after compelling his predecessor (and
cousin), Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, to resign in 1979. Before that, however,
he had carefully laid the groundwork for his control over Iraq. In 1972,
for instance, he had spearheaded the nationalization of international
oil interests in Iraq. Oil, of course, was and is where the money is in
Iraq, so he had fulfilled the essential ingredient of coming to power:
he knew where the money was. Once in power, he ruthlessly pruned his
support base.</p>
<p>Just six days after President al-Bakr “resigned,” Saddam Hussein
convened a national assembly of the ruling Ba’ath Party’s leaders, the
Revolutionary Command Council. The assembly was videotaped at Saddam
Hussein’s insistence. During the session, Muhyi Abdel-Hussein, secretary
of the Revolutionary Command Council, read out a confession that he had
plotted against Saddam Hussein, and then sixty-eight more “enemies of
the state” were named as coconspirators. Each, one at a time, was
removed from the assembly. Twenty-two were sentenced to death by firing
squad and summarily executed by members of the Ba’ath Party, each branch
of which was required to send a delegate with a rifle to participate in
the executions. Hundreds more were executed within the next few days.
Saddam Hussein’s biographer later asked Saddam about the decision to
eliminate these people, most of whom had risen in the ranks of the
Ba’ath Party with Saddam’s support. He reported, “The answer was that as
long as there is a revolution, there will be a counter-revolution.”5 As
we said before, those who can bring a leader to power can also bring the
leader down. It is best to shrink the ranks of those who represent a
threat and keep those who are most trusted to be loyal.</p>
<p>How competent were the approximately 450 Ba’ath leaders who were
executed as part of Saddam’s consolidation of power? It is difficult to
say from this remove, but we do know that among their ranks were
professors, military officers, lawyers, judges, business leaders,
journalists, religious leaders, and many other well-educated and
accomplished men. For good measure, Hussein also threw in leaders of
competing political parties, who, after all, might have conspired to
replace him.</p>
<p>Survivors included people like Saddam’s cousin “Chemical Ali,” Ali
Hassan al-Majid. Chemical Ali most notably demonstrated his loyalty in
1988 when, under orders from Saddam, he launched a successful campaign
to commit genocide against Iraq’s restive Kurds. But long before that
al-Majid had established his commitment to Saddam Hussein. In the
infamous videotape mentioned earlier, al-Majid is seen speaking to
Saddam, saying, “What you have done in the past was good. What you will
do in the future is good. But there’s one small point. You have been too
gentle, too merciful.”6 Unlike many who were executed following the July
22, 1979, party assembly, al-Majid, previously a motorcycle
courier/delivery boy, had little formal education. Although he held the
posts of defense minister, interior minister, and head of Iraq’s
intelligence service, it seems his main area of competence was
murder.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s pattern of appointments is quite typical. His
successor, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, purged the security services
of all Sunnis and replaced them with Shia supporters, albeit with a
gentler hand than his predecessor.7 These replacements did not have the
experience and training of the existing security personnel. Both leaders
knew that it is better to have loyal incompetents than competent
rivals.</p>
<p>Post-Saddam Iraq, for all its many troubles, not only looks very
different; it looks much better. Cabinet ministers are more likely to be
college educated, many have postgraduate degrees, and a great many have
actual expertise in the subject matter of their ministry. Of course,
those are some of the benefits that follow from having shifted the size
of the essential group from 0.27 on our 0-to-1 scale during Saddam’s
time in power to 0.71 after he was overthrown. Not surprisingly, that
improvement in government has been a disaster for national leaders.
Saddam survived in office for twenty-four years, whereas since 2003 Iraq
has had at least six different governments and counting. The new, more
democratic leaders get tossed out pretty regularly. There is always a
trade-off between better government and longer-lasting leaders.</p>
<p>Sometimes, of course, having competent advisers is unavoidable even
for truly undemocratic rulers. Byzantine, Mughal, Chinese, Caliphate,
and other emperors devised a creative solution that guaranteed that
these advisers didn’t become rivals: they all relied on eunuchs at
various times. In the Byzantine Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries,
the three most senior posts below emperor were held almost exclusively
by eunuchs. The most senior position of grand administrator had evolved
from the position of prefect of the sacred bedchamber and included the
duties of posting eunuch guards and watching over the sleeping emperor.
Michael III made an exception and gave his position to his favorite,
Basil, rather than a eunuch. This decision cost him his life. When Basil
perceived that Michael was starting to favor another courtier, he
murdered the emperor and seized the throne.8</p>
<p>Even in modern times the principle of choosing close advisers who
cannot rise to the top spot remains good advice. It is surely no
coincidence that Saddam Hussein as president of Islamic Iraq had a
Christian, Tariq Aziz, as his number two.</p>
<p>KEEP ESSENTIALS OFF-BALANCE</p>
<p>What we can begin to appreciate is that no matter how well a tyrant
builds his coalition, it is important to keep the coalition itself
off-balance. Familiarity breeds contempt. As noted, the best way to stay
in power is to keep the coalition small and, crucially, to make sure
that everyone in it knows that there are plenty of replacements for
them. This is why you will often read about regular elections in
tyrannical states. Everyone knows that these elections don’t count, and
yet people go along with them. Rigged elections are not about picking
leaders. They are not about gaining legitimacy. How can an election be
legitimate when its outcome is known before the vote even occurs? Rigged
elections are a warning to powerful politicians that they are expendable
if they deviate from the leader’s desired path.</p>
<p>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was the first to really exploit the idea of
substitute coalition members. In a one-party state, he nonetheless
perfected a system of rigged elections and universal adult suffrage. Any
action he took—say, sending so-and-so to Siberia—was the will of the
people, and any of the people in the replacement pool had a chance,
albeit a slight one, of being called up to serve as an influential or
maybe even an essential somewhere down the line. Everybody in the Soviet
selectorate could, with a very small probability, grow up to be general
secretary of the Communist Party, just like the petty criminal Joseph
Stalin and the uneducated Nikita Khrushchev. Those already in the inner
circle knew they had to stay in line to keep their day jobs. Bravo,
Lenin.</p>
<p>Although Lenin perfected the system and probably came up with it on
his own, the always-fascinating country of Liberia had experimented
earlier with the same phenomenon. Prior to Samuel Doe’s takeover,
Liberia had been ruled by the True Whig Party. The country originated
when a number of liberal American organizations, appalled by the evils
of slavery, paid to repatriate former slaves to West Africa. Despite the
nation’s philanthropic origins, the most important lesson the former
slaves took from their experiences appears to be that slavery and forced
labor worked much better for the masters than the slaves. These former
slaves instituted universal adult suffrage in 1904, but with a property
qualification that effectively excluded Indigenous Africans from
becoming insiders, making the selectorate large but the influential
group relatively small. Thus, they established a system run for a small
group of insiders despite the appearance of a universal franchise. This
structure provided for strong loyalty to the incumbent and ensured the
incumbent had the opportunity to suppress any opposition that might
arise to their forced labor policies—a system whose policies differed
from Soviet ones but whose promise of security in office was the
same.9</p>
<p>Virtually every publicly traded company in the world has adopted the
Leninist rigged-election system, and for much the same reasons. Along
with a packed board, it is one of the major factors ensuring that poorly
performing CEOs hardly ever get fired. Carly Fiorina had the misfortune
of heading a company that might have looked like a rigged-election
autocracy but up close and personal remained more akin to a monarchy.
Although there were millions of shareholders who in theory could shape
HP policy, so many shares were concentrated in a few hands that HP had
more of the characteristics of a small coalition drawn from a small
group of influentials within a mostly small, concentrated group of
interchangeables—that is, members of the Hewlett and Packard
families.</p>
<p>The essence of keeping coalition members off-balance is making sure
that their loyalty is paid for and that they know they will be ousted if
their reliability is in doubt. The USSR’s Mikhail Gorbachev, thought to
be a good guy in Western political circles, certainly understood the
necessity of rewarding loyalty and shucking off all those whose
faithfulness was questionable. He replaced much of the Politburo within
his first two years in office, picking and choosing from the Communist
Party (the real selectorate) those most loyal to him. It turns out,
though, that Gorbachev was much less ruthless than contemporaries of the
autocratic class. To be sure, he forced adversaries, like Boris Yeltsin,
out of the Politburo. But, as Yeltsin surely realized, he would have
been killed under Stalin. Equally, he and many others must have known
that it was much better to cross swords with Gorbachev, an intellectual
reformer, than with such contemporaries as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire or
even Deng Xiaoping of China. Deng, after all, used ruthless force to end
the prodemocracy uprising at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Gorbachev, as we
will see, did not hesitate to use force outside of Russia, but he also
did not go around killing his political rivals. His reward was a short
time in power, first because he left himself vulnerable to a coup by
hard-line Communists and then because he allowed Yeltsin to resurrect
himself politically, defeat the coup, and make himself into Gorbachev’s
replacement. Yeltsin’s own successor, Vladimir Putin, learned the errors
of Gorbachev’s approach. Putin allegedly has had around a dozen of his
more influential opponents assassinated or, in a few cases,
unsuccessfully targeted for death.</p>
<p>The execution of opponents is a long-standing practice among most
autocrats. We should not fail to appreciate the moral significance of
Gorbachev’s restraint. Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Samuel
Doe, and so many others showed no such restraint. They had their
erstwhile backers murdered once they worked out who was most likely to
be loyal and who was not. We see a nicer version of such behavior as a
routine part of corporate changes when there’s a new CEO. Although the
CEO is supposed to answer to the board, it is commonplace for boards to
be reconstituted after a new CEO comes to power; the tail apparently
wags the dog.</p>
<p>Being purged from the initial coalition is often fatal. Hitler became
chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933. During his rise to power he
had relied heavily on the Sturmabteilung, a paramilitary force also
known by the abbreviation SA or by a description of their uniforms, the
Brownshirts. Hitler perceived the SA’s leader, Ernst Röhm, as a threat.
He built up an alternative paramilitary, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, and
then, on what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, he ordered
the assassination of at least eighty-five and possibly many hundreds of
people between June 30 and July 2, 1934. Thousands more were imprisoned.
Despite Röhm’s long-term and essential backing of Hitler (Röhm had been
with him during his failed 1923 Beer Hall Putsch), Hitler showed no
sentimentality. He replaced him with men like SS leader Heinrich
Himmler, whom he deemed more loyal.</p>
<p>Robert Mugabe was likewise a master at keeping his coalition
off-balance. He was elected president of Zimbabwe in 1980 following a
negotiated settlement to a long civil war. The struggle against the
white-only rule of the previous Rhodesian regime was led by two factions
that crystallized into political parties behind their respective
leaders: Robert Mugabe’s ZANU (Zimbabwe African National Union) and
Joshua Nkomo’s ZAPU (Zimbabwe African People’s Union). Initially, Mugabe
preached reconciliation:</p>
<p>If yesterday I fought you as an enemy, today you have become a friend
and ally with the same national interest, loyalty, rights and duties as
myself. If yesterday you hated me, you cannot avoid the love that binds
you to me and me to you.… Draw a line under the past.… The wrongs of the
past must now stand forgiven and forgotten. If ever we look to the past,
let us do so for the lesson the past has taught us, namely that
oppression and racism are inequalities that must never find scope in our
political and social system. It could never be a correct justification
that because the whites oppressed us yesterday when they had power, the
blacks must oppress them today because they have power. An evil remains
an evil whether practiced by white against black or black against
white.10</p>
<p>A naive observer might have thought that Mugabe planned to bring ZAPU
elites into his winning coalition. That might have made sense at the
outset, but once ZANU’s power was consolidated there would be no reason
to keep ZAPU loyalists around. And once Mugabe’s power was consolidated,
he’d have no need to keep some of his old friends from ZANU around
either.</p>
<p>Mugabe also reached out to many in the white community, particularly
former leaders and administrators, to help him run the country. Many
whites who had feared the transition began to refer to him as “good old
Bob.” Mugabe needed their support. He could not run the country without
them, and he needed to know where the money was. In this he was greatly
assisted by the international community. They pledged 00 million in aid
during his first year. However, once he was ensconced in power, Mugabe’s
attitude changed.</p>
<p>In 1981 he called for a one-party state and began arresting whites,
saying, “We will kill those snakes among us, we will smash them
completely.” Mugabe was even harsher toward his former comrades in arms.
He forced Nkomo out of the cabinet and sent a North Korean–trained
paramilitary group, the Fifth Brigade, to terrorize Matabeleland,
Nkomo’s regional stronghold. As one ZANU minister put it, “Nkomo and his
guerillas are germs in the country’s wounds and they will have to be
cleaned up with iodine. The patient will scream a bit.”11 The operation
was called Gukurahundi—a Shona word that means “wind that blows away the
chaff before the spring rains.” Many veterans from the fight against
white rule resisted. In retaliation Matabeleland was effectively sealed
off and four hundred thousand people faced starvation. As one of
Mugabe’s henchmen, a brigade officer, stated, “First you will eat your
chickens, then your goats, then your cattle, then your donkeys. Then you
will eat your children and finally you will eat the dissidents.”12</p>
<p>Mugabe needed the assistance of ZAPU fighters to defeat white-only
rule. He needed the assistance of white farmers and administrators and
the international community to find the money to solidify his control
over the state. Only when he was entrenched in power did “good old Bob”
show his true colors.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS AREN’T ANGELS</p>
<p>As we all know, history is written by the victors. Leaders should
therefore never refrain from cheating if they can get away with it.
Politicians in democracies may have to put up with real and meaningful
elections in order to stay in power, but it shouldn’t be shocking to see
that whenever they can, they’ll happily take a page out of Lenin’s book.
There’s no election better than a rigged one, so long as you’re the one
rigging it.</p>
<p>Indeed, Donald Trump’s refrain in 2020, from the moment the polls
turned against him, was that the Democrats somehow were going to rig the
election against him, even though they were not in power in key swing
states. And when he lost what even his own attorney general declared was
an honest election, he continued to claim it was rigged against him and
tried to stop Congress from making his loss official. Honest elections
are good, but winning, by whatever means, is better.</p>
<p>The list of tried-and-true means of cheating is long. Just as quickly
as electoral rules are created to outlaw corrupt practices, politicians
find other means. For instance, leaders can restrict who is eligible and
registered to vote. In Malaysia, under a system known as Operation IC,
immigration is controlled so as to create demographics favorable to the
incumbent party. Tammany Hall, New York City’s infamous Democratic Party
machine, acquired its Irish flavor by meeting and recruiting immigrants
as they left the boat, promising citizenship and jobs in exchange for
their vote. The British were really good at rigging elections. In the
rotten boroughs of England’s eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there
were places where a handful of voters—maybe just one family—could elect
a member of Parliament. Malaysians, Brits, Republicans, Democrats:
everyone looks for ways to shrink how much support they need to win
while maximizing how much support their foes require.</p>
<p>When leaders can’t restrict who is eligible to vote or are unable to
buy enough votes, they can use intimidation and violence to restrict
access to polling places. North Indian states, such as Bihar and Uttar
Pradesh, experience “booth capture,” where party supporters capture the
polling place and cast every eligible voter’s vote for their party. The
US state of Georgia won’t allow anyone to hand out water bottles to
people who might spend hours waiting in line to vote. After all, that
bottle of water just might change someone’s vote.</p>
<p>Cheating does not stop once ballots are cast, of course. Leaders
never hesitate to miscount or destroy ballots. Coming to power and
staying in power are the most important things in politics. And
candidates who aren’t willing to cheat are typically beaten by those who
are. Since democracies typically work out myriad ways to make cheating
difficult, politicians in power in democracies have innovated any number
of perfectly legal means to ensure their electoral victories and
continued rule.</p>
<p>One counterintuitive strategy is for leaders to encourage additional
competitors. This is why some states have so many political parties,
even though only one really wins. The conventional wisdom about
America’s two-party system tells us that fringe parties allow for a more
vibrant and responsive government. But even in multiparty states, there
are always leading parties—you have to ask yourself whether the leading
parties would allow the fringe parties to exist if they weren’t somehow
serving their interests.</p>
<p>Tanzania’s parliament and presidency are perennially controlled by
the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party (CCM), even though as many as fifteen
parties competed for the presidency in 2020. This is especially
surprising because Tanzania follows electoral rules very similar to the
Westminster system in which a plurality wins. Such systems are expected
to have only two major parties. In fact, this is such a well-established
regularity that it is known as Duverger’s law.13</p>
<p>Why so many parties in Tanzania, apparently in defiance of Duverger’s
law? Well, the CCM government actually provided campaign financing, as
we would expect, in an opaque way, to small parties until quite
recently, thereby encouraging them to compete and divide the opposition
vote. This makes it easier for the relatively centrist CCM to win.
Although the CCM wins a large percentage of the vote, all it needs to
win is one more vote than the second-largest party in half the
parliamentary constituencies. That turns out to mean the CCM needs much
less than 10 percent in most districts. The number of supporters a party
needs affects the kinds of policies it pursues. In those constituencies
in Tanzania where an opposition party generates lots of votes, the CCM
needs to appeal to many voters and therefore generally provides better
health care, education, and services. In constituencies where the CCM
needs fewer votes, cash transfers, such as vouchers for subsidized
fertilizer, are more common.14</p>
<p>Multiparty democracy provides a similar means for one or two parties
to dominate governments in democracies from Botswana to Japan and
Israel. There is more to representing the people than just allowing them
to vote, even when the vote is done honestly.</p>
<p>Designated seats for underrepresented minorities is another means by
which leaders reduce the number of people upon whom they are dependent.
Such policies are advertised as empowering minorities or
underrepresented groups, whether women or members of a particular caste
or religion. In reality they empower leaders. That a candidate is
elected by a small subset of the population reduces the number of
essentials required to retain power. At a very basic level, electoral
victory in a two-party parliamentary system requires the support of half
the people in half the districts—that is, in principle, 25 percent of
the voters. Suppose 10 percent of the seats were reserved for election
by one specific group that happens to be geographically concentrated
(such as gay voters in the Castro in our earlier account of Harvey
Milk’s election in San Francisco). To retain half the seats in
parliament, the incumbent party need only retain 40 percent of the
regular single-member district seats, which is readily done with just
over 22 percent of the vote. So by focusing on districts in which the
privileged minority is prevalent, a party can reduce the number of votes
it requires by 12 percent.</p>
<p>Delegated positions also make it easier to form a small coalition.
Consider Tanzania’s parliament, the Bunge. There are 264 directly
elected seats, 113 additional seats reserved for women who are nominated
by the parties in relation to the number of seats they capture in the
election, and 5 seats nominated by the Zanzibar Assembly. (Zanzibar is a
beautiful island off the mainland that united with mainland Tanganyika
in 1964 to form Tanzania.) In addition, the president gets to nominate
ten cabinet appointees and an attorney general to serve in the
parliament. This gives a total of 393 seats, of which the president
needs 197 to control the Bunge. Given that he appoints eleven and that
the CCM is regionally based in Zanzibar, he already controls sixteen
seats. If the CCM wins 141 elected seats, then he controls
parliament—that is, 141 directly elected seats (equal to 35.8 percent of
parliament), 16 appointed seats, and .358 × 113 of the appointed women’s
seats (that is, 41 such seats), together total 198, rounding having
forced an extra seat to be held. The CCM not only needs only 35.8
percent of the directly elected seats; by funding many opposition
parties the CCM can win many seats with less than a 10 percent vote
share. In practice the president actually controls nearly all the
women’s appointments, and he tends to appoint women who lack an
independent base of support. Indeed, few women win direct election to
Tanzania’s parliament.</p>
<p>While Tanzania may have free and fair elections (though this was
strongly questioned in 2020 when there were widespread allegations that
leading opposition candidates were restricted in their ability to
campaign), the reality is that the incumbent CCM party can sustain
itself in office with a very small percentage of the vote. Of course, in
most districts they get much more support than they need because
politicians find inventive ways to incentivize voters. One of these ways
is the creation of voting blocs.15</p>
<p>BLOC VOTING</p>
<p>Bloc voting is a feature common in many fledgling democracies. It was
also the norm under party machines in large US cities. For instance,
under the influence of Tammany Hall, whole neighborhoods in New York
City would turn up to vote Democratic. Many of India’s electoral
districts have followed a pattern similar to the old Tammany Hall: a
small group of local notables or village patrons can deliver their
community’s vote and extract great rewards for themselves in return.</p>
<p>During Bueno de Mesquita’s time doing fieldwork in India in
1969–1970, he observed firsthand how the quest for power coupled with
the influence of power blocs undermined any notion of the pursuit of
political principles other than the principles of winning and getting
paid off.</p>
<p>Senior people in villages and towns—and indeed, up and down the
levels of governance in India’s states—would pledge to a particular
party the support of those they led. In return, they would receive
benefits and privileges. By and large, all the “clients” of these
“patrons” followed their patron’s lead and voted for the designated
party. What is most fascinating is that the affiliations between voters
and parties didn’t need to have any ideological rhyme or reason. In
Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, for instance, the
free-market, anticommunist Swatantra Party, the socially conservative
and anticommunist Jana Sangh party (a Hindu-nationalist party that was a
precursor to today’s BJP), and the Communist Party of India formed a
coalition government with each other following India’s 1967 election.
This was true despite the Swatantra Party leadership’s description of
the Communist Party of India as “public enemy number 1.” What did these
parties have in common? Only their desire to band together and beat the
Congress Party so as to enjoy the benefits of power. This sort of
odd-bedfellows, coalition-building strategy was long rampant throughout
India.16</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious case of bald opportunism occurred in the
state of Bihar. There, ideologically disparate parties formed a
government by relying heavily on currying favor with the Raja of
Ramgarh. The raja, owner of many of the mining interests in Bihar,
switched parties every few months, bringing coalition governments
down—and up—with him. Each time he switched, he garnered greater private
goods for himself and his backers, including the dismissal of criminal
charges against him. As noted in an analysis of one of the raja’s
frequent defections to an alternative coalition, which led to the
formation of a new government, “The Raja who had been able to get his
terms from Mr. Mahamaya Prasad [the former head of the Bihar government]
assumed that he could demand from Mr. Paswan [the new head of the Bihar
government] a higher price. This amounted to Deputy Chief Ministership
and the Mines portfolio for himself and withdrawal of the innumerable
cases filed against him and members of his family by the Bihar
government.”17 The raja understood that he could manipulate his bloc of
backers to make or break governments and that, in doing so, he could
enrich himself a lot and help his followers a little bit. That, indeed,
is the lesson of bloc voting whether based on personal ties in Bihar,
trade union membership among American teachers, corporate membership in
a lobbying group like the American Petroleum Institute, tribal clans in
Iraq, linguistic divisions in Belgium, or religion in Northern Ireland.
Bloc leaders gain a lot, their members gain less, and the rest of
society pays the price.</p>
<p>Bloc voting takes seemingly democratic institutions and makes them
appear like publicly traded companies. Every voter or share has a
nominal right to vote, but effectively all the power lies with a few key
actors who can control the votes of large numbers of shares or deliver
many votes from their village. Bloc voting makes nominally democratic
systems with large coalitions function as if they are autocratic by
making the number of influentials—that is, the people whose choices
actually matter—much smaller than the nominal selectorate of the rest of
the voters. Since this is such an important aspect of winning elections,
we are obliged to explore how politicians do it.</p>
<p>The traditional approach has been to treat emerging democracies as
patronage systems in which politicians deliver small bribes to
individual voters. For instance, the New York Times reported on
September 17, 2010, in an article with the headline “Afghan Votes Come
Cheap, and Often in Bulk,” that the typical price paid for an Afghan
voter’s support was about five or six dollars. But the article also
noted that widespread vote fraud probably made vote buying unnecessary
in any event.</p>
<p>The explanation for fraudulent electoral outcomes based on vote
buying in exchange for patronage is simple, but it is also incomplete.
First, parties don’t bribe enough people, and second, once in the voting
booth, voters can renege. Historically parties used to issue their own
ballots. For instance, your party might print a ballot on pink paper, so
party representatives could check that those who took bribes voted with
pink ballots. Although we could fill a whole book with the tricks
parties use to monitor vote choices, the reality is that today votes are
likely to be anonymous, at least in real democracies.</p>
<p>Bribing voters works far better at the bloc level. Suppose there are
just three villages, and suppose a party, call it party A, negotiates
with senior community figures in the villages and makes the following
offer: if party A wins, it will build a new hospital (or pick up the
trash, send police patrols, plow the snow, and so on) in the most
supportive of the three villages. Once a village elder declares for
party A, voters in that village can do little better than support party
A, even if they don’t like it. The reality is that there are so many
voters that the chance that any individual’s vote matters is
inconsequential. Yet voters have much more influence on where the
hospital gets built or whose streets get swept than they have on who
wins the election. To see why, consider the case where two or three of
the village elders declare in favor of party A and most voters in these
villages go along with them.</p>
<p>Consider the incentives of an individual voter. Since at least two of
three villages have declared for party A, an alternative party is
unlikely to win, so an individual’s vote has little influence on the
electoral outcome. Voting for party B is a waste of time. Yet the voter
could influence where the hospital is built by turning out to vote for
A. If everyone else supports A but she does not, then her village gives
one less vote for A than another village and so loses out on the
hospital. If she votes for A, then her village has a shot at getting the
hospital. In the extreme case, where absolutely everyone votes for party
A, our voter would give up a one-third chance of getting the hospital in
her village if she did not vote for party A. Voters have little
incentive to do anything but go along with their village elders.</p>
<p>By rewarding supportive groups over others, individual voters are
motivated to follow the choice of their group leader, be that a village
elder, a ward organizer, a church leader, or a union boss. The real
decisions are made by the group leaders who deliver blocs of votes. They
are the true influentials. It is therefore unsurprising that it is
common for the rewards to flow through them, so that they can take their
cut, rather than go directly to the people. Political scientist Milton
Rakove describes the process of handing out rewards to different ethnic
groups under Mayor Richard Daley’s party machine in Chicago in the early
1970s: “The machine co-opts those emerging leaders in the black and
Spanish-speaking communities who are willing to cooperate; reallocates
perquisites and prerogatives to the blacks and the Spanish speaking,
taking them from ethnic groups such as the Jews and Germans, who do not
support the machine as loyally as their fathers did.”18</p>
<p>Of course, leaders can use sticks as well as carrots. Lee Kuan Yew
ruled Singapore from 1959 until 1990, making him, we believe, the
longest-serving prime minister anywhere. His party, the People’s Action
Party (PAP), dominated elections, and that dominance was reinforced by
the allocation of public housing, upon which most people in Singapore
rely. Neighborhoods that fail to deliver PAP votes come election time
found the provision and maintenance of housing cut off.19 In Zimbabwe,
Robert Mugabe went one step further. In an operation called
Murambatsvina (Operation Drive Out the Rubbish), he used bulldozers to
demolish the houses and markets in neighborhoods that failed to support
him in the 2005 election.</p>
<p>Of course, there are nicer ways to reward bloc voting than rushing
out to bulldoze the homes of opponents. These nicer ways nevertheless
are tremendously effective in dampening opposition. Consider that even
in a seemingly staid, rule-oriented democracy like Japan, bloc voting is
commonplace and successfully delivers the goods. A study of more than
3,300 Japanese municipalities revealed that municipalities that gave
more support to Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party winners got
disproportionately more government support within the district than they
seemed to be entitled to. That seems surprising because the support they
got was supposed to be allocated according to a formula intended to even
out the quality of services despite inequalities in wealth.20</p>
<p>Ownership of a public company works in the same way as bloc voting.
We could hold our shares in our own names and vote at stockholder
meetings. However, except for a very wealthy few of us, our votes are
inconsequential, and turning up at meetings is burdensome. Thus we hold
stock via mutual funds and pensions (there are tax and management
reasons to do so, too, but then think about who has the incentive to
lobby for these regulations). These institutional investors, like
village elders, are influential enough that CEOs court their support.
But it is much cheaper to buy the loyalty of the institutional investor
with private goods, such as fees for board membership, than it is to
reward all the little investors he represents with great stock
performance.</p>
<p>So what can a politician do when elections are fair and the risk of
electoral defeat is rising? When an incumbent is at risk of electoral
defeat, he can always mitigate that risk by redrawing the boundaries of
the constituency to exclude opposition voters—that is to say, the
district can be gerrymandered, although the opportunity to redraw
district boundaries only comes once in a while, so it may come too late
to save an unpopular incumbent. The practice of gerrymandering has made
the odds of an incumbent being voted out of a US congressional seat not
that different from the odds of defeat faced by members of the Supreme
Soviet under the Soviet Union’s one-party Communist regime. And while
gerrymandering virtually ensures reelection, it also makes the voters in
a congressional district happy. After all, the gerrymander means that
they get the candidate favored by a majority in the district. If
gerrymandering isn’t an option, then other rule changes can be
instituted, such as the prohibition of rallies—in the name of public
safety, of course.</p>

<p>LEADER SURVIVAL</p>
<p>Building a small coalition is key to survival. The smaller the number
of people to whom a leader is beholden, the easier it is for her to
persist in office. Autocrats and democrats alike try to cull supporters.
Let’s arrange political systems into broad groups of autocrats and
democrats to make it easy to see big differences in coalition size.
Doing so, we can compare the survival of different political
leaders.</p>
<p>Figure 3.2 looks at democrats’ and autocrats’ risk of being replaced
based on how long they have been in office. On average, democrats who
make it through the first six months in office have about a 38 percent
chance of being out by the end of their first year; autocrats have about
a 28 percent chance of being ousted in the same amount of time.21 The
figure demonstrates that the farther out leaders go in time, the more
likely it is that they are ousted if they are democrats. Autocrats are
removed at a much lower rate. The effect of this higher rate of
democratic deposition is that about 12 percent of autocrats survive ten
years in office while only 5 percent of democrats survive that long. The
figure ends after just ten years because there are virtually no
democrats with longer tenures. However, if the chart were extended, we
would see that of the autocrats that make it to ten years, two-thirds of
them will still be in office after twenty years. These simple
comparisons, however, miss an interesting and important detail. Although
autocrats survive longer, they find surviving the initial period in
office particularly difficult. During their first six months they are
nearly twice as likely to be deposed as their democratic counterparts.
However, if they survive those first turbulent months, then they have a
much better chance of staying in power than democrats. Those early
months are difficult because they have not yet worked out where the
money is, making them unreliable sources of wealth for their coalition,
and they have yet to work out whose support they really need and whom
they can dump from their transitional coalition. But once autocrats have
reshaped their group of supporters through a purge, survival becomes
easier. Democrats, in contrast, are constantly engaged in a battle for
the best policy ideas to keep their large constituencies happy. As a
result, although democrats survive the early months in office more
easily (they get a honeymoon), the perpetual quest for good policy takes
a toll.</p>
<p>Figure 3.2: The Risk of Ouster by Type of Government</p>
<p>Staying in power right after coming to power is tough, but a
successful leader will seize power and then reshuffle the coalition that
brought him there to redouble his strength. A smart leader sacks some
early backers and replaces them with more reliable and cheaper
supporters. But no matter how much he packs the coalition with his
friends and supporters, they will not remain loyal unless he rewards
them. And as we will see in the next chapter, rewards don’t come
cheaply.</p>
