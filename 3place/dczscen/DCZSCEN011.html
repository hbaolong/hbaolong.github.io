<h4 id="chapter-nine-war-peace-and-world-order">CHAPTER NINE WAR, PEACE,
AND WORLD ORDER</h4>
<p>The first war in the Bible arises when the kings of Shinar, Ellasar,
Elam, and Goiim fight the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and
Bela, two thousand years after the world’s creation. The world has not
seen that long a stretch without war again. Indeed, it is fair to say
that our world has had too much war, too little peace, and hardly any
order. We think that a big part of why war has been such a scourge is
that too many leaders get the wrong advice about how to solve
international problems. Maybe, just maybe, by looking at war in our
political survival terms we will see ways to construct a more peaceful
and orderly world.</p>
<p>War is often said to transcend everyday politics, to be above the
fray of partisan rancor. But the fact is that war is inherently
political. Carl von Clausewitz, the nineteenth-century Prussian soldier
and preeminent military thinker, expressed it best: “War is a mere
continuation of politics by other means.” And as we have seen, political
survival is at the heart of all politics.</p>
<p>Georges Clemenceau, leader of France during the later stages of World
War I, famously declared, “War is too important to be left to the
generals.” He was right. Relative to parliamentarians, generals do a
lousy job of fighting wars. Although it’s completely counterintuitive,
the military men who lead juntas and other forms of autocratic leaders
are much worse at fighting wars than their civilian counterparts who
lead democratic governments. That’s why it’s so important for us to
unpack the contrasting advice different leaders receive about how and
when to fight. It turns out that autocrats and democrats should receive
and follow radically different counsel. War, being about domestic
politics, can be best understood, we believe, by putting it in the
context of interchangeables and essentials and taking it out of the
context of grand ideas about national interest and balances of
power.</p>
<p>WAR FIGHTING</p>
<p>Two thousand five hundred years ago, Sun Tzu literally wrote the book
on how to wage war.1 Although his advice influenced leaders down through
the centuries, leading American foreign policy advisers have
contradicted his war-fighting doctrines.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan’s secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger; George W.
Bush’s first secretary of state, Colin Powell; and, with slight
modifications, Bill Clinton’s second secretary of state, Madeleine
Albright, all prescribed a doctrine of when and how the United States
should fight. And it differed radically from the time-tested advice of
Sun Tzu.</p>
<p>The reason Sun Tzu has served so many leaders so well over
twenty-five centuries is that his is the right advice for kings,
chieftains, and autocrats of every shape to follow. Until recently, with
very few exceptions, small-coalition systems were the dominant form of
government. But these are the wrong policies for a leader beholden to
many. Democratic warfare emphasizes public welfare, exactly as should be
the case for a leader who relies on a large coalition. Sun Tzu’s advice
is exactly right for a small-coalition leader. To see this, let’s have a
look at the ideas expressed by Sun Tzu and Caspar Weinberger.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu contended to his king, Ho Lu of Wu, that</p>
<p>the skillful general does not raise a second levy, neither are his
supply wagons loaded more than twice. Once war is declared, he will not
waste precious time in waiting for reinforcements, nor will he turn his
army back for fresh supplies, but crosses the enemy’s frontier without
delay. The value of time—that is, being a little ahead of your
opponent—has counted for more than either numerical superiority or the
nicest calculations with regard to commissariat.… Now, in order to kill
the enemy, our men must be roused to anger. For them to perceive the
advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards.
Thus, when you capture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as
rewards, so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on
his own account.2</p>
<p>In contrast to Sun Tzu’s perspective, Caspar Weinberger
maintained,</p>
<p>First, the United States should not commit forces to combat overseas
unless the particular engagement or occasion is deemed vital to our
national interest or that of our allies.…</p>
<p>Second, if we decide it is necessary to put combat troops into a
given situation, we should do so wholeheartedly, and with the clear
intention of winning. If we are unwilling to commit the forces or
resources necessary to achieve our objectives, we should not commit them
at all.…</p>
<p>Third, if we do decide to commit forces to combat overseas, we should
have clearly defined political and military objectives. And we should
know precisely how our forces can accomplish those clearly defined
objectives. And we should have and send the forces needed to do just
that.…</p>
<p>Fourth, the relationship between our objectives and the forces we
have committed—their size, composition, and disposition—must be
continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary. Conditions and
objectives invariably change during the course of a conflict. When they
do change, then so must our combat requirements.…</p>
<p>Fifth, before the United States commits combat forces abroad, there
must be some reasonable assurance we will have the support of the
American people and their elected representatives in Congress.…</p>
<p>Finally, the commitment of US forces to combat should be a last
resort.3</p>
<p>Sun Tzu’s ideas can coarsely be summarized as follows: (1) an
advantage in capabilities is not as important as quick action in war;
(2) the resources mobilized to fight should be sufficient for a short
campaign that does not require reinforcement or significant additional
provisions from home; and (3) the provision of private goods is
essential to motivate soldiers to fight. Sun Tzu says that if the
supplies the army initially raised prove insufficient or if new supplies
are required more than once, then the commanders lack sufficient skill
to carry the day. In that case, he advises that it is best to give up
the fight rather than risk exhausting the state’s treasure.</p>
<p>Weinberger’s doctrine does not emphasize swift victory but rather a
willingness to spend however much is needed to achieve victory, a point
made even more emphatically in the Powell Doctrine. Weinberger and
Powell argue that the United States should not get involved in any war
in which it is not prepared to commit enough resources to win. They, and
Madeleine Albright too, argue for being very cautious about risking war.
Once a decision is made to take that risk, then, as Weinberger and
Powell recognize, the United States must be prepared to raise a larger
army and to spend more treasure if necessitated by developments on the
ground. War should only be fought with the confidence that victory will
follow and that victory serves the interests of the American people.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu emphasizes the benefits of spoils to motivate combatants
(“When you capture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as rewards,
so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on his own
account”). Weinberger emphasizes the public good of protecting vital
national interests. For Sun Tzu, the interest soldiers have in the
political objectives behind a fight or their concern for the common good
is of no consequence in determining their motivation to wage war. That
is why he emphasizes that soldiers fight, “each on his own account.”</p>
<p>Sun Tzu’s attentiveness to private rewards and Weinberger’s
concentration on the public good of protecting the national interest
(however that may be understood) represent the great divide between
small-coalition and large-coalition regimes. Our view of politics
instructs us to anticipate that leaders who depend on lots of essential
backers only fight when they believe victory is nearly certain.
Otherwise, they look for ways to resolve their international differences
peacefully. Leaders who rely on only a few essential supporters, in
contrast, are prepared to fight even when the odds of winning are not
particularly good. Democratic leaders try hard to win if the going gets
tough. Autocrats make a good initial effort, and if that proves wanting,
they quit. These strategies are clearly in evidence when we consider the
Six-Day War in 1967.</p>
<p>TO TRY HARD OR NOT</p>
<p>As its name tells us, the Six-Day War was a short fight, begun on
June 5, 1967, and ending on June 10. On one side were Syria, Egypt (then
the United Arab Republic), and Jordan; on the other was Israel. By the
end of the war, Israel had captured the Sinai from Egypt; Jerusalem,
Hebron, and the West Bank from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria.
The air forces of the Arab combatants were devastated, and Egypt
accepted an unconditional cease-fire. The Israelis had easily defeated
their opponents. From a conventional balance-of-power perspective, the
outcome must be seen as extraordinarily surprising. From the
political-survival point of view, as we shall see, it should have been
perfectly predictable.</p>
<p>To understand the war and how our way of thinking explains it, we
must first comprehend some basic facts about the adversaries. The
combined armed forces of the Arab combatants on the eve of war came to
360,000, compared to Israel’s 75,000; that is, the Israeli side
represented only 17 percent of the available soldiers.4 The Arab
combatants accounted for 61 percent of the national military
expenditures of the two sides. For starters, comparing these two sets of
values already tells us something very important that reflects a
fundamental difference between large-coalition and small-coalition
governments. Although the Arab side had 83 percent of the soldiers, they
spent considerably less per soldier than did the Israelis.</p>
<p>Remember that large-coalition leaders must keep a broad swath of the
people happy. That means democrats must care about the people, and, of
course, soldiers are people. Although conflict involves putting soldiers
at risk, democrats do what they can to mitigate such risk. In
autocracies, foot soldiers are not politically important. Autocrats do
not waste resources protecting them.</p>
<p>The difference in expenditures per soldier is greater even than the
numbers alone indicate. The Israeli military, like the militaries of
democracies in general, spends a lot of its money on buying equipment
that is heavily armored to protect soldiers. Better training and
equipment enable democracies to leverage the impact of each soldier so
they can achieve the same military output while putting fewer soldiers
at risk.5 The Egyptian military’s tanks, troop transports, and other
equipment were lightly and cheaply armored. They preferred to spend
money on private rewards with which to ensure the loyalty of the
generals and colonels.</p>
<p>Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt’s president at the time, was not elected by
the people; he was sustained in office by a small coterie of generals
whose own welfare depended on the survival of his regime. For that
reason, he was not beholden to the bereaved family members who scream
about the avoidable deaths of their loved ones. Israeli prime ministers
are elected by those family members, and this is reflected in the
superior equipment, armor, and training given to Israeli soldiers. “Give
our troops the best” is a democratic refrain. This is why there was such
a stink about US soldiers having insufficient body armor in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and why the United States rushed to fix this deficiency,
even if in some cases the extra armor made some vehicles so heavy that
they became close to inoperable.</p>
<p>A bit of close reasoning shows us that making an extra effort to win
the war made tons of sense for the Israelis and no sense at all for
their opponents. Let’s have a look at why it is that democrats, like
Israel’s then prime minister, Levi Eshkol, try hard to win wars and
autocrats, like Egypt’s Nasser, don’t. Indeed, we will see that for a
small-coalition autocrat like Nasser, it could make more sense to lose
the war and keep paying off his cronies than to win the war if doing so
required asking the cronies to sacrifice their private rewards.</p>
<p>In a small-coalition regime, the military serves two crucial
functions: it keeps the incumbent safe from domestic rivals, and it
protects the incumbent’s government from foreign threats. In a
large-coalition government, the military only has to worry about the
latter function. Sure, it might be called on to put down some massive
domestic unrest from time to time, but its job is to protect the system
of government, not the particular group running the government. Its job
description does not include taking out legitimate domestic political
rivals. Autocrats, of course, don’t recognize any rivals as legitimate.
And to do their job in an autocracy, as Sun Tzu eloquently argued, the
soldiers must have their rewards. If they don’t, they might turn their
guns on the leadership that employed them to keep rivals at bay. With
that in mind, we can begin to unravel the seeming surprise of a larger
military, backed by a larger gross domestic product—.3 billion derived
from thirty million people in 1967 Egypt, compared to billion generated
by only 2.6 million Israelis—losing to a puny state.</p>
<p>Imagine that the Israeli government spent as much as 10 percent of
its revenue on private rewards, probably a high estimate. Imagine that
the Egyptian government spent 30 percent of its revenue on private
rewards—that is, more than the Israelis, as befits the comparison of
large- and small-coalition regimes that we have seen in the earlier
chapters. Then how valuable did winning have to be for Israel’s
coalition and for Egypt’s coalition to justify trying so hard that it
meant spending extra money on the war effort?</p>
<p>Anticipating the high risk of war, the usually fractious Israelis
formed a unity government in May 1967, reflecting the national
commitment to win the coming war. We know the government allocated 81
million to the military in 1967. That means, given our assumptions, that
8 million of that pot of money might have been available for private
rewards to the government’s winning coalition. Of course, even more
would have been available across the whole economy (both in Egypt and in
Israel), but we focus just on money committed to the military in 1967,
thereby understating our case. Since Israel had a unity government, it
is likely that the Israeli winning coalition was very large, but we will
err on the side of conservatism and assume that the government needed
just 25 percent of the population to sustain it. That puts the winning
coalition’s size at roughly 650,000 people. With these numbers in mind,
we see that the potential value of private rewards taken from the
military budget for government supporters in Israel would have been less
than 0 a head (81 million in military expenditures × 10 percent for
private rewards / 650,000 coalition members = 8.62 per coalition
member).</p>
<p>Each member of Israel’s coalition could have had a choice: take the
private reward or agree to put that money toward the war effort. Putting
it toward the war effort would certainly have increased the odds of
victory, an attractive public good to offset the small private gain that
would be sacrificed by each individual in the coalition. Surely each of
the relevant 650,000 Israelis would have put a greater value on military
victory than a paltry 8.62!</p>
<p>Compare this calculation to that for Egyptians in Nasser’s winning
coalition. We did a pilot study a few years ago in which we surveyed
country experts about the size of several governments’ winning
coalitions from 1955 to 2008. The experts we interviewed about Egypt
placed its winning coalition in 1967 as being as small as eight members
and as large as sixty-five. Wherever one comes down in that range, it is
obvious that the coalition was very small. We suspect the experts may
have underestimated its size, so we will err, again, on the side of
conservatism and assume it consisted of as many as one thousand key
military officers and essential senior civil servants. Even with our
conservative estimate, each coalition member stood to get 50,000 in
private rewards (00 million in military expenditures × 30 percent for
private rewards / 1,000 coalition members = 50,000 per coalition member)
if the funds out of the military budget that were available for that use
were turned over to them instead of being applied to making a concerted
increased effort to win the war. Whereas Israeli coalition members were
only asked to sacrifice about 0 to help their country win the war,
Egypt’s coalition members would have had to personally give up 50,000 in
income to help their country win. It should be obvious that Nasser would
likely have lost the loyal support of lots of his key backers if he took
their 50,000 a head and spent it on the war instead of on them. He
actually would have increased his chance of being overthrown in a
military coup by making an all-out effort to win the war at the expense
of his cronies. His backers would have had to place a value on winning
the war that was worth their personally giving up 50,000. Victory is
nice, but it probably isn’t that nice for many people. Levi Eshkol faced
no such problem. His supporters were much more likely to place a value
on victory that was greater than 8.62.</p>
<p>Of course, Israel did not just fight Egypt. It took on Syria and
Jordan at the same time. Here again the logic for its victory is the
same. As journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski described, Israel simply tried
harder.</p>
<p>Why did the Arabs lose the 1967 war? A lot has been said on that
subject. You could hear that Israel won because Jews are brave and Arabs
are cowards. Jews are intelligent, and Arabs are primitive. The Jews
have better weapons, and the Arabs worse. All of it untrue! The Arabs
are also intelligent and brave and they have good weapons. The
difference lay elsewhere—in the approach to war, in varying theories of
war. In Israel, everybody takes part in war, but in the Arab
countries—only the army. When war breaks out, everyone in Israel goes to
the front and civilian life dies out. While in Syria, many people did
not find out about the 1967 war until it was over. And yet Syria lost
its most important strategic area, the Golan Heights, in that war. Syria
was losing the Golan Heights and at the same time, that same day, that
same hour, in Damascus—twenty kilometres from the Golan Heights—the
cafes were full of people, and others were walking around, worrying
about whether they would find a free table. Syria lost fewer than 100
soldiers in the 1967 war. A year earlier, 200 people had died in
Damascus during a palace coup. Twice as many people die because of a
political quarrel as because of a war in which the country loses its
most important territory and the enemy approaches within shooting
distance of the capital.6</p>
<p>Kapuscinski’s numbers are wrong, since about 2,500 Syrians were
killed in the war, but his point is not. Autocrats don’t squander
precious resources on the battlefield. And elite, well-equipped units
are more for crushing domestic opposition than for fighting a determined
foreign foe. Syrian president Hafez al-Assad did not squander precious
resources on the battlefield because they were better used to protect
him against his domestic foes. In February 1982, he deployed around
twelve thousand soldiers to besiege the city of Hama in response to an
uprising of a conservative religious group, the Muslim Brotherhood.
After three weeks of shelling, the city was destroyed and tens of
thousands of civilians were massacred.</p>
<p>When they need to, democracies try hard. However, often they don’t
need to. Indeed, they are notorious for being bullies and picking on
weaker states, and negotiating whenever they are confronted by a worthy
adversary. Thus the United States readily fights small adversaries like
Grenada, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, and many democracies
expanded their influence in the world by colonizing the weak. But when
it came to the Soviet Union, the United States and its democratic NATO
allies negotiated regardless of whether the dispute was over Cuba,
issues in Europe, or elsewhere in the world. Indeed, the Cold War stayed
cold precisely because the United States, a large-coalition regime,
could not be confident of victory even with enormous effort. When extra
effort does make victory likely, as in the Iraqi surge, democrats try
hard.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes negotiations fail, as was the case when
Britain and France sought to appease Adolf Hitler before World War II.
They agreed to Germany’s occupying Austria and the German-speaking part
of Czechoslovakia. Even when he invaded Poland, some in Britain
hesitated to declare war. No concession, however, was sufficient to
satisfy Hitler’s appetite for Lebensraum. This left Britain and France
with a very serious fight on their hands, one in which Britain tried
enormously hard. In contrast, Germany did not switch its economy onto a
full war footing until the later stages of the war, when it was clear to
Hitler and his cronies that their government’s survival—and their
personal survival—was at risk.</p>
<p>In other cases the fight turns out to be significantly more difficult
than initially thought. US involvement in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan
would be just such cases. When confronted by these kinds of difficult
fights, democracies increase their effort. In Vietnam, the United States
continually reassessed the resources needed to win before negotiating a
settlement with North Vietnam, only to see that agreement collapse a
year after American withdrawal. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United
States needed troop surges to advance its objectives, and when, in
Afghanistan, that failed to defeat the Taliban, then as in Vietnam, the
United States negotiated a withdrawal settlement—that is, the United
States follows Weinberger’s counsel and not Sun Tzu’s. Autocratic
leaders are wary of expending resources on the war effort, even if
victory demands it. They know their fate depends more on the loyalty of
their coalition than success on the battlefield. They don’t generally
make that extra effort.</p>
<p>World War I provides a great case study in these principles. Its
origins are complex and contentious, so we limit ourselves to describing
the chain of events. The war started as a dispute between Austria and
Serbia after Serbian nationalists murdered the heir to the Austrian
throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in June 1914. When Austria threatened
war, Serbia’s ally, Russia, became involved. This activated Germany’s
alliance with Austria. Given that war with Russia also meant war with
its ally, France, the Germans launched a rapid invasion of France in the
hope of quickly defeating it, as they had in 1871. The German invasion
of France went through Belgium, and since the British had pledged to
protect Belgium’s neutrality, this brought Britain in on the side of the
allies.</p>
<p>A tangled web! Although many nations were involved, the war was
basically a struggle between the Central powers of Austria and Germany
and the Allied powers of France, Russia, and Britain. After a dynamic
beginning—the war was famously supposed to be over by Christmas—the
conflict stagnated and devolved into trench warfare, particularly on the
western front. Russia dropped out of the war in late 1917, after the
Bolshevik Revolution. Doing so cost it enormous amounts of its western
territory, but Lenin, in his political genius, knew it was better to
preserve resources to pay supporters than it was to carry on fighting.
In late 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side.7
Allied victory was sealed with an armistice signed on the eleventh hour
of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918.</p>
<p>Figure 9.1 plots the military expenditures of the primary
combatants.8 On a per capita basis, Russia spent less than the others.
It was both massive and poor. Of these nations only Britain and France
were democratic. After the war started in 1914, all combatants ramped up
their military spending. However, after 1915, the autocratic nations
didn’t increase their efforts much, and their expenditures plateaued as
the war dragged on. German spending did increase again in 1917 as it
became clear that defeat would mean the replacement of the German
government. In contrast to the meager efforts by autocracies like
Austria and Russia, the democracies continued to increase expenditures
until victory was achieved.</p>
<p>Figure 9.1: Military Expenditures in World War I</p>
<p>Sun Tzu’s advice to his king predicted the behavior of autocrats in
World War I: they didn’t make an extraordinary effort to win. The effort
by the democratic powers in that same war equally foreshadowed what
Caspar Weinberger and so many other American advisers have said to their
president: if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</p>
<p>When it comes to fighting wars, institutions matter at least as much
as the balance of power. The willingness of democracies to try harder
goes a long way to explaining why seemingly weaker democracies often
overcome seemingly stronger autocracies. The United States was once a
weak nation. And yet in the Mexican-American War (1846–1848) it defeated
the much larger, better-trained, and highly favored Mexican army. The
minuscule Republic of Venice survived for over a thousand years until it
was finally defeated by Napoleon in 1797. Despite its small size and
limited resources, it fought above its weight class throughout the
Middle Ages. It played a crucial role in the Fourth Crusade, which led
to the sacking of Constantinople, in which Venice captured the lion’s
share of the Byzantine Empire’s wealth. The smaller but more democratic
government of Bismarck’s Prussia defeated the larger—and widely
favored—Austrian monarchy in the Seven Weeks’ War in 1866. Prussia then
went on to defeat Louis Napoleon’s monarchical France in the 1870–1871
Franco-Prussian War. And as we have seen, tiny Israel has repeatedly
beaten its larger neighbors. History is full of democratic Davids
beating autocratic Goliaths.</p>
<p>FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL</p>
<p>At one level, autocrats and democrats fight over the exact same
thing: staying in power. At another level, they are motivated to fight
over different things. Democrats more often than autocrats fight when
all other means of gaining policy concessions from foreign foes fail. In
contrast, autocrats are more likely to fight casually, in the pursuit of
land, slaves, and treasure.</p>
<p>These differences have important implications. As Sun Tzu suggested,
autocrats are likely to grab what they can and return home. On the other
hand, democrats fight where they have policy concerns, be these close to
home or, as can be the case, in far-flung lands. Further, once they have
won, democrats are likely to hang around to enforce the policy
settlement. Frequently this can mean deposing vanquished rivals and
imposing puppet regimes that will do their policy bidding.9</p>
<p>Thinking back to our discussion of foreign aid, we can see that war
for democrats is just another way of achieving the goals for which
foreign aid would otherwise be used. Foreign aid buys policy
concessions; war imposes them. Either way, this means that democrats,
eager as they are to deliver desired policies to the folks back home,
would much prefer to impose a compliant dictator (surely with some bogus
trappings of democracy, such as elections that ensure the outcome
desired by the democrat) than take their chances on the policies adopted
by a democrat who must answer to her own domestic constituents.</p>
<p>The idea that democrats and autocrats fight for their own political
survival may seem awfully cynical at best and downright offensive at
worst. Nevertheless, we believe the evidence shows this is the way the
world of politics, large and small, actually works. A look at the First
Gulf War will validate all of our suspicions.</p>
<p>Before 1990, relations between Iraq and Kuwait had long been
fractious. Iraq claimed that Kuwait, with its efficient modern oil
export industry, had been pumping oil from under Iraq’s territory. On
numerous occasions it demanded compensation and threatened to invade.
After misreading confused signals from US president George H. W. Bush
(on previous occasions the United States had deployed a naval fleet to
the region in response to Iraqi threats but had also told Iraq’s
government that what it did in Kuwait was of no concern to the United
States), Saddam Hussein’s forces invaded and occupied Kuwait in August
1990. His goal was to exploit its oil wealth for the benefit of himself
and his cronies—fairly typical for an autocrat at war. However, despite
initially confused signals, the United States did not look the other
way: President Bush organized an international coalition and in January
1991 launched Operation Desert Storm to displace Iraqi forces.</p>
<p>The goals and conduct of each side in the First Gulf War differed
greatly. In contrast to Hussein, President Bush did not attempt to grab
oil wealth to enrich cronies. Rather, the goal was to promote stability
in the Middle East and restore the reliable, undisrupted flow of oil.
Protesters against the war would chant “No blood for oil.” It would be
naive to argue that energy policy was not a major (even the major)
determinant of US policy in the Middle East, but for the United States,
the war was not an exchange of soldiers’ lives for oil wealth. The
objective was to protect the flow of oil, which was and still is the
energy running the machines of the world’s economy. Economic stability,
not private gain, was the goal of the coalition. To be sure, soldiers
from the United States and other coalition members died, although in
very small numbers. Of the 956,600 coalition troops in Iraq, the total
number of fatalities was 358, of which nearly half were killed in
noncombat accidents. In contrast, Iraq experienced tens of thousands of
casualties. The coalition deaths brought concessions from Saddam
Hussein, not booty.</p>
<p>The conduct of the First Gulf War also fits the patterns predicted by
a political survival outlook. The United States first tried negotiations
to get Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait. When these failed, the United
States assembled an overwhelmingly powerful coalition of highly trained
and superbly equipped troops. Saddam Hussein had elite troops, such as
the Republican Guard, that perhaps came close to matching the training
and capability of coalition forces. But his elite Republican Guard did
not confront the coalition forces; Saddam had them pulled back to safety
so they could protect him rather than protect Iraq. Instead, the brunt
of the coalition attack was borne by raw recruits and poorly equipped
units. As the casualty figures show, many of these units suffered
horribly.</p>
<p>Facing the possibility that coalition forces would invade Baghdad to
depose him, on February 28 Saddam Hussein agreed to terms of surrender.
The United States retained forces in the Gulf to ensure Saddam complied
with the terms to which he had agreed. Yet no-fly exclusion zones,
diplomatic isolation, and economic sanctions did not stop Saddam from
repeatedly violating the agreement. He also survived domestically. After
his military defeat, several groups, including Shiites in the South and
Kurds in the North, rebelled. Unfortunately for them, Saddam had
preserved his best troops and retained enough resources to buy their
continued loyalty. The suppression of these uprisings killed tens of
thousands and led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of
others. Saddam remained in power until the United States deposed him in
the Second Gulf War in 2003.</p>
<p>Saddam was not alone in placing survival and enrichment over fighting
well. Dictators like to win wars if they can secure control over extra
riches that way, but keeping their job takes priority over pursuing
those riches. Mengistu Haile Mariam, who came to power in 1974 when he
overthrew Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, embraced communism and was
handsomely rewarded by the Soviet Union. Over a fourteen-year period the
USSR gave his regime about billion, much of it as military aid with
which to fight Eritrean rebel forces seeking independence. Despite all
this money, his war against the Eritreans did not go well. It seems
Mengistu was more interested in the Soviet money as a means to enrich
himself and ensure his political survival than in the successful conduct
of the war. He certainly had little concern for his soldiers’ welfare,
as we shall see later. Michela Wrong reported that the Soviets
eventually worked out that Mengistu’s devotion to the fight was not all
it was cracked up to be: “‘He kept telling us that if we helped him he
could achieve this military victory,’ remembers Adamishin, with
bitterness. ‘I remember how he told me with tears in his eyes: “We may
have to sell our last shirt, but we will pay you back. We Ethiopians are
a proud people, we settle our debts.” Looking back, I almost feel I hate
him. Because I believed that what mattered to him was what was best for
the country. While really all that mattered to him was his own
survival.’”10</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mengistu Haile Mariam, the collapse of the Soviet
Union meant the end of his gravy train. In 1989 the Soviets departed.
Mengistu needed a new source of money. In an effort to salvage his
situation, he decided to try to get blood money from the United States
and Israel by offering to trade Falashas—Ethiopian Jews—for money and
military aid. The Falashas had lived in North Africa for thousands of
years and are counted among those who fled from the Babylonian captivity
in 586 BCE. To resettle these people, the United States allegedly paid 0
million and Israel agreed to pay 8 million (but eventually paid only 5
million). With the money transferred, the rescued Falashas were then
settled in Israel.11 This blood money was not enough to buy the loyalty
of his supporters. It was a far cry from the annual amounts doled out by
the Soviets. As his military collapsed to the much weaker Eritrean
forces, Mengistu fled to Zimbabwe, where he continues to live in luxury
with around fifty former colleagues and family members.</p>
<p>WHO SURVIVES WAR</p>
<p>Democrats are much more sensitive to war outcomes than autocrats.12
Indeed, even victory in war does not guarantee a democrat’s political
survival. For instance, within eighteen months of defeating Saddam
Hussein, and the over 80 percent approval ratings that went with it,
President George Herbert Walker Bush was defeated at the polls by Bill
Clinton in 1992. Similarly, British voters threw Winston Churchill out
of office despite his inspired leadership during World War II. Still,
while it is no guarantee of political survival, military victory clearly
helps. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher turned her career around
with the defeat of Argentina in the Falklands War in 1982. Her economic
reforms and confrontations with trade unions had led to a recession and
high unemployment. Prior to the war she was deeply unpopular. At the end
of 1981 her approval rating stood at 25 percent. After the war it jumped
to over 50 percent, and a year later she won a decisive electoral
victory that would have looked virtually impossible eighteen months
earlier.</p>
<p>Military success helps democrats retain power while defeat makes
removal a near certainty for democrats. A failure to achieve victory in
Vietnam ended US president Johnson’s career. French premier Joseph
Laniel suffered a similar fate. His government collapsed following the
French defeat by Vietnamese forces in 1954 at the Battle of Dien Bien
Phu. British prime minister Anthony Eden was forced to resign after his
disastrous invasion of Egypt’s Suez Canal Zone in 1956.</p>
<p>Autocrats are much less sensitive to defeat. Despite defeat in the
First Gulf War and a costly and inconclusive result in the Iran-Iraq War
(1980–1988), Saddam Hussein outlasted four US presidents (Carter,
Reagan, Bush, and Clinton). Only defeat in the Second Gulf War cost him
his job, and that war was fought primarily to remove him. Unless they
are defeated by a democracy seeking policy concessions, autocrats can
generally survive military defeat provided that they preserve their
resources. Autocrats even survive if their loss involves huge
casualties. In contrast, even in victory democrats are liable to be
deposed if they get lots of soldiers killed in the process. That
presumably is why democrats do much more to protect soldiers than
autocrats do.</p>
<p>Hermann Göring, Hitler’s number two in the Nazi regime, knew that,
while it is the people who do the fighting, it is leaders who start
wars. “Naturally the common people don’t want war.… But, after all, it
is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always
a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or
a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament or a communist dictatorship.…
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce
the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
It works the same way in any country.”13</p>
<p>Göring is right. Leaders of every flavor can deploy troops and the
people in democracies are liable to rally around the flag. But democrats
don’t recklessly put soldiers in harm’s way. And when they do put them
in harm’s way, they do much more to protect them. The value of a
soldier’s life differs drastically between small- and large-coalition
systems. To illustrate this sad truth, we compare two conflicts fought a
few years apart in the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>The US military operates on the principle of no soldier left behind.
For an accurate and gory drama of this principle, we recommend Ridley
Scott’s 2001 film Black Hawk Down, which portrays an account of the
battle of Mogadishu, October 3–4, 1993. US troops entered Somalia as
part of a United Nations–sponsored humanitarian mission. In 1993 Somalia
was a collapsed state. Between 1969 and 1991 it had been ruled by Siad
Barre, someone who understood that policy should always be subordinate
to survival. As Barre bluntly stated, “I believe neither in Islam, nor
socialism nor tribalism, nor Somali nationalism, nor pan-Africanism. The
ideology to which I am committed is the ideology of political
survival.”14 And this focus allowed him to successfully survive in
office for twenty-two years before being caught up and deposed in the
myriad of civil wars that plague the Horn of Africa. Following his
deposition, the Somali state collapsed, with control divided between
tribal warlords whose militias terrorized the people. Mohamed Farrah
Aidid, who led the Habar Gidir clan, controlled one of the strongest
factions. Aidid was strongly opposed to the United States’ presence in
Somalia because he believed the United States was backing his
adversaries. After several failed attempts to capture or kill Aidid, the
United States received intelligence that several of his senior
colleagues were meeting at a house. The US plan was to helicopter elite
troops into the building, capture the senior Habar Gidir members, and
get out via a military convoy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the mission went sour. Two Black Hawk helicopters went
down and two others were damaged. Thousands of Somalis took to the
streets and erected barricades so that the convoy became trapped. Both
the helicopter crews and many in the convoy became trapped overnight and
were subjected to small-arms fire, and it was not until the next day
that they could be rescued. Although the operation was a debacle, the US
commitment to its soldiers was unwavering. As is to be expected when
soldiers’ lives are highly valued, the United States sent forces in to
retrieve the downed helicopter crews. We might take this for granted,
but it is not the behavior of autocrats—the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict
in the Horn of Africa provides a case in point.</p>
<p>The Battle of Afabet (March 17–20, 1988) was an important turning
point in the decades-long battle for Eritrean independence from
Ethiopia. As we have seen, Ethiopia had an enormous military of about
five hundred thousand men that was lavishly equipped by Soviet military
aid. In contrast, virtually all the Eritreans’ equipment had been
captured from the Ethiopians.</p>
<p>In a switch from its usual guerrilla tactics, the Eritrean rebel
force (the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, or EPLF) decided to
challenge the Ethiopian army in a head-on battle. The Ethiopians
resisted solidly for sixteen hours. On multiple occasions the EPLF
commander, Mesfin, was told to withdraw but carried on pressing his
attack. The Ethiopian commanders decided to withdraw to the garrison
town of Afabet and assembled a convoy of seventy vehicles. Unfortunately
for them, the withdrawal went through the Adi Shirum Pass, which forms a
natural bottleneck. When an advancing EPLF tank hit a truck in the front
of the column, the Ethiopian forces were stuck.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian command was concerned that their heavy weapons might
fall into enemy hands. Fortunately for them they had a sizable air
force. Yet rather than attempt to relieve their trapped countrymen and
fellow soldiers, they embarked on a two-hour aerial bombardment that
destroyed everything. The Ethiopian motto was: Leave no working tank
behind. As an Ethiopian general put it, “When you lose an area you
better destroy your equipment—it’s a principle of war. If you cannot
separate your men from their equipment then you bomb them both
together.”15</p>
<p>It’s likely that few readers have ever heard of this battle, in which
Ethiopian casualties were perhaps as high as eighteen thousand men. In
contrast, many Americans are familiar with the disastrous policy failure
in which, for the loss of thirteen lives, the US Army killed as many as
one thousand Somali militants.</p>
<p>THE PEACE BETWEEN DEMOCRACIES</p>
<p>Democracies hardly ever (some might even say never) fight wars with
each other. This is not to say they are peace loving. They are not shy
about fighting other states. But the reasoning behind the tacit peace
between democracies provides some clues to how the world could become
more peaceful and why achieving that end is so difficult.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders need to deliver policy success or they will be
turned out of office. For this reason they only fight wars when they
expect to win. Of course they may turn out to be wrong, in which case,
as we have argued, they then double down to turn the fight in their
direction. That is just what happened in Vietnam, where the United
States committed massive numbers of troops and huge amounts of money to
no avail. Only after many long, costly years of trying did the United
States settle for a negotiated peace that ultimately turned all of
Vietnam over to the North Vietnamese regime. The story in Afghanistan
was much the same.</p>
<p>If we are correct, we should hardly ever witness two large-coalition
regimes fighting against each other. According to our reasoning,
democrats will fight only when they are almost certain that they will
win. But how can two adversaries each sustain such certainty? Autocrats,
as we saw, don’t need to think they have a great chance of winning. They
are prepared to take bigger risks because they have good reason to think
that the personal consequences of defeat are not as bad for them as the
personal consequences of not paying off their few essential supporters.
Now, following the logic of political survival closely, we must
recognize that just because two democrats are not likely to fight with
each other, we cannot say that one will not use force against another.
Large-coalition nations certainly may be prepared to engage in disputes
with each other, and one might even use force against the other. How
does this work?</p>
<p>As long as a large-coalition leader believes that his dispute is
unlikely to escalate fully to war, he can move partially up the
escalation ladder, pressing his foe into backing down or else backing
down himself, and negotiating if he concludes that the other side is
prepared to fight and that his own prospects of victory are too small to
justify fighting. Hence the departure from Afghanistan after twenty
years of fighting but not fully defeating the Taliban. Now imagine the
two disputants are both democracies dependent on a large coalition. The
logic of large-coalition politics tells us that a large-coalition state
will attack another large-coalition state only if the target is weak
enough that it is expected to prefer to negotiate rather than fight
back. Since the democratic target will also try hard if it chooses to
fight back, the initiating democracy must either have (or be capable of
having) a great military advantage or be confident that its rival’s
resources are insufficient for the target to believe it can be nearly
certain of victory. Thus, the attacking democracy must be sure that its
target democracy is unsure of victory; this is of paramount importance
in a head-to-head military dispute between two democracies.16 Here we
have an explanation for the history of US attacks against very weak
democratic rivals, such as Lyndon Johnson’s 1965 attack and overthrow of
Juan Bosch’s democratically elected regime in the Dominican Republic,
France’s invasion of Weimar Germany in 1923, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Democracies don’t fight with each other, true. But big democracies
pick on little opponents whether they are democratic or not, with the
expectation that they won’t fight back or won’t put up much of a fight.
Indeed, that could very well be viewed as a straightforward explanation
of the history of democracies engaged in imperial and colonial expansion
against weak adversaries with little hope of defending themselves.</p>
<p>This democratic propensity to pick on weak foes is nothing new.
Looking at all wars for nearly the past two centuries, we know that
about 93 percent of wars started by democratic states are won by them.
In contrast, only about 60 percent of wars started by nondemocracies are
won by them.17</p>
<p>DEFENDING THE PEACE AND NATION BUILDING</p>
<p>In his 1994 State of the Union address, US president Bill Clinton
declared that “democracies don’t attack each other” and therefore “the
best strategy to insure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere.”18 This is a common theme
for US presidents. Unfortunately, actions have not matched the rhetoric.
More unfortunately still, the problem lies not in a failure on the
presidential level but with “we the people.”</p>
<p>In democracies, leaders who fail to deliver the policies their
constituents want get deposed. Democrats might say they care about the
rights of people overseas to determine their own future, and they might
actually care, too, but if they want to keep their jobs they will
deliver the policies that their people want. Earlier we examined how
democrats use foreign aid to buy policy. If that fails or gets too
expensive, then force is always an option. Military victory allows the
victors to impose policy.</p>
<p>We should dismiss any pretense that such policies are benevolent and
imposed with the foreigners’ long-term best interests in mind. They are
not. They are done for the benefit of the democrat’s supporters, and
sometimes these policies can be very unpleasant. For instance, the Opium
Wars (1839–1842 and 1856–1860) got their name because the British wanted
to finance their purchases of Chinese exports by selling the Chinese
opium grown in India. China was reluctant to become a nation of addicts.
The British used force to open up China to the drug market. Hong Kong
started out as a base from which the British could enforce this trade
openness. It is telling that, while the settlements that ended the wars
are officially known as the Treaties of Nanking and Tianjin, the Chinese
often refer to them as the Unequal Treaties.</p>
<p>One of the problems with seeking a policy solution is that after the
democrat’s army leaves, the vanquished nation can renege. Enforcing the
settlement can be very expensive, as was the case after the Gulf War. A
common solution, and the one eventually used against Saddam Hussein, is
leader replacement. Democrats remove foreign leaders who are troublesome
to them and replace them with puppets. The leaders that rise to the top
after an invasion are more often than not handpicked by the victor.</p>
<p>A difficult leader whom democrats don’t trust to honor an agreement
will often find himself replaced. The Congo’s Patrice Lumumba,
democratically elected, didn’t have policies that pleased the Belgian or
American governments, and before you knew it, Lumumba was dead, replaced
by horrible successors who also happened to be prepared to toe the line
favored by the United States and Belgium. France was no different,
stepping into its ex-colony of Chad to make sure that a French-friendly
government was in charge rather than a Libyan-friendly or Arab-friendly
regime.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders profess a desire for democratization. Yet the
reality is that it is rarely in their interest. As the coalition size
grows in a foreign nation, its leader becomes more and more compelled to
enact policies that his people want and not the policies desired by the
puppeteer’s people. If a democratic leader wants a foreign leader to
follow his prescribed policies, then he needs to insulate his puppet
from domestic pressures. This means reducing coalition size in
vanquished states. This makes it cheaper and easier to sustain puppets
and buy policy. US foreign policy is awash with examples where the
United States overtly or covertly undermined the development of
democracy because it promoted policies counter to US interests. Queen
Liliuokalani of Hawaii in 1893, Salvador Allende of Chile in 1973,
Mohammad Mosaddegh of Iran in 1953, and Jacobo Arbenz of Guatemala in
1954 all suffered such fates.</p>
<p>Democracy overseas is a nice thing to believe in, in the abstract. In
practice, it’s probably not what we the people want. Let’s return to
reconsider Egypt and Israel and the case for democratization. Western
democracies used to complain, albeit not too emphatically, about
electoral malpractice in Egypt under Mubarak. With Mubarak gone, they
worried that true democracy in Egypt might be contrary to the interests
of friends of Israel. Buying peace with Israel under Mubarak was costly,
but moves toward democracy in Egypt would make continued peace costlier,
at least until (and if) Egypt becomes a full-fledged, mature democracy
whose leaders will then only fight if they are virtually sure of
victory. So when the Egyptian military toppled their nascent democracy
led by the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, the Obama administration
was careful not to call the military’s action a coup. Doing so would
have triggered a US law that would have cut off aid to Egypt just when a
potentially more US-friendly government was taking over.</p>
<p>While it is true that democracies generally don’t fight each other,
we have also noted that they do have lopsided conflicts, and those
conflicts often end with the weaker side capitulating. If Egypt were
democratic and if a democratic Egypt mobilized and armed itself, tiny
Israel would have little hope of resisting unless the United States or
NATO was prepared to make a large effort to defend it. Anyone who thinks
a democratic Egypt attacking Israel is too fanciful a scenario might ask
democratic Native American tribes from the American plains about their
dealings with the expanding United States in the 1800s. Democratization
sounds good in principle only.</p>
<p>Of course, many may think that we are just too cynical. Advocates of
democratization are fond of pointing out the success stories. Yet all of
these cases—Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—also happen to
involve countries whose populations’ values largely coincided with
American values in resisting large communist neighbors for decades.</p>
<p>The big problem with democratizing overseas continues to lie with “we
the people.” In most cases we seem to prefer that foreign nations do
what we want, not what they want. However, if our interests align, then
successful democratization is more likely. This is particularly so if
there is a rival power that wishes to influence policy. The postwar
success stories fit this category well. Generally, the people of West
Germany and Japan preferred what the United States wanted to the vision
expounded by the Soviet Union. Creating powerful states that wanted to
resist communism and would try hard was in the US interest. As occupying
powers, the United States, Britain, and France might have set Germany on
a course to democracy, but they did so only because it was advantageous
for them. This confluence of interests is rare, and so is externally
imposed democratization.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Sun Tzu exerted a lasting influence on the study of war precisely
because his recommendations are the right recommendations for leaders,
like monarchs and autocrats, who rule based on a small coalition. The
Weinberger Doctrine—like its more recent replacements—exerts influence
over American security policy precisely because it recommends the most
appropriate actions for leaders who are beholden to a large
coalition.</p>
<p>We have seen that larger-coalition nations are extremely selective in
their decisions about waging war and smaller-coalition nations are not.
Democracies only fight when negotiation proves unfruitful and the
democrat’s military advantage is overwhelming, or when, without
fighting, the democrat’s chances of political survival are slim to none.
Furthermore, when war becomes necessary, large-coalition regimes make an
extra effort to win if the fight proves difficult. Small-coalition
leaders do not if doing so would use up treasure that would be better
spent on the private rewards that keep their cronies loyal. And finally,
when a war is over, larger-coalition leaders make more effort to enforce
the peace and the policy gains they sought through occupation or the
imposition of a puppet regime. Small-coalition leaders mostly take the
valuable private goods for which they fought and go home, or take over
the territory they conquered so as to enjoy the economic fruits of their
victory for a long time.</p>
<p>Clausewitz had war right. War, it seems, truly is just “a
continuation of” domestic “politics by other means.” For all the
philosophical talk of a “just war” and all the strategizing about
balances of power and national interests, in the end, war, like all
politics, is about leaders trying to stay in power and control as many
resources as possible. It is precisely this predictability and normality
of war that makes it, like all the pathologies of politics we have
discussed, susceptible to being understood and fixed.</p>
