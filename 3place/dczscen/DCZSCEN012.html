<h4 id="chapter-ten-is-democracy-fragile">CHAPTER TEN IS DEMOCRACY
FRAGILE?</h4>
<p>January 6, 2021, may be a day that equaled—or overtook—December 7,
1941, as a “day that will live in infamy.” Democracy in the United
States was threatened by a small, intense, violent group seeking to
overturn the results of the presidential election two months earlier. It
was the most serious assault on the American Capitol since the British
burned it in 1814. The British action was an act of war. The 2021
assault on the Capitol was an act of insurrection—an action by domestic
actors intended to alter the institutions of US governance. Democracy
survived.</p>
<p>The Capitol insurrection came at the end of what many have perceived
as a decade of democratic retrenchment. Concerned citizens point to
Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, and
Andrzej Duda in Poland as undermining democratic principles. Throughout
the preceding chapters we outlined how leaders are only in it for
themselves and why bettering themselves means contracting their
coalition of supporters. You might therefore expect us to be predicting
the end of democracy. Yet to the contrary, we are optimistic about the
survival of large-winning-coalition (a.k.a. democratic) governments, and
we believe the evidence is on our side.</p>
<p>Despite our admonitions to think of governance in terms of the number
of essential supporters that a leader needs to stay in power, we have
continually erred in equating large-coalition systems with democracy. We
will certainly repeat this linguistic convenience, but we are mindful
that it can lead to sloppy thinking. We have dodged the perennial
question of what is democracy, and with good reason. Does democracy
simply require elections, or do the elections need to be free and fair?
Or does democracy require civil liberties and the right to free speech?
We could fill many chapters with fruitless debate on the meaning and
definition of democracy. Further, we all too often politicize the
epithet: we call our friends democrats and our enemies despots. While we
concede the peril that democracy faces, we shall defend the argument
that when leaders rely on a sufficiently large coalition of supporters
to retain power, governance institutions are robust and endure.</p>
<p>Our optimism does not mean that those of us fortunate enough to live
in large-coalition systems can sit back because everything will be all
right. Rather, we have the means to protest and organize to preserve our
freedoms. And it is in our interest to do so.</p>
<p>January 6 reminded everyone paying any attention (and was there
anyone not paying attention?) that democracy always exists atop an
undercurrent of threat. Elections pick winners and create losers, and no
one likes to lose. Hence, democracy presents leaders with a formidable
conundrum.</p>
<p>Every head of state, whether a dictator or a democrat, is best off
when her rule depends on pleasing just a few people. The difficulty is
that democratic leaders always have to satisfy a large coalition; that
is what it means to be a democracy. Such government, as we have
emphasized throughout, requires the sustained support of many
essentials. The problem is that the loyalty of those essentials always
is unreliable. They are easily tempted away by a rival, putting the
incumbent at a high risk of replacement. With such fickle support,
democrats must work hard to deliver policy solutions to the problems of
the day. Despite their best efforts, they are often kicked out. In the
words of US president Herbert Hoover following his 1932 defeat by
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “Democracy is a harsh employer.” The simple
fact is that democratic states do well; democratic heads of state do
not!</p>
<p>We have just made a distinction that too often is ignored: democratic
governing institutions are robust while democratic administrations are
fragile. The plain fact is that the institutions of very-large-coalition
democracies are rarely overturned, but the leaders of those
institutions—presidents and prime ministers—hang on to power only for a
short time.</p>
<p>Leaders come and go, but large-coalition governance endures. Back in
Chapter 3, we compared the tenure of leaders under different governance
institutions. The average time in office for a leader in the
smallest-coalition systems is about twelve years, while leaders in the
largest-coalition systems average less than five years in office. The
sad fact for democrats is that while they deliver policies that enable
their citizens to enjoy long, productive, and happy lives, their reward
is a short term in office and little opportunity to enrich themselves.
Remember Mexican politician Hank Gonzalez’s declaration that “a
politician who stays poor is poor at politics.”1 That’s simply not true
in democratic politics. Presidents make money on book deals after they
leave office. Sure, corruption happens. Bill Clinton was rightly put
through the wringer for trying to take furniture from the White House,
and there are allegations that Donald Trump enriched his eponymous
company by accommodating government officials in his hotel chain at
taxpayer expense. Certainly such actions are inappropriate and wrong,
but they are so small-scale compared to what leaders do in
small-coalition regimes. The Marcoses, the Mobutus, and the Gonzalezes
must consider US presidents rank amateurs. They work hard, earn (or
steal) little, and still get kicked out of office after all their hard
work and honesty.</p>
<p>While the person who rules in a democracy is constantly changing, the
democracies themselves hardly change. In the 232 years that have
followed the introduction of the Bill of Rights (the first ten
amendments), the US Constitution has been amended only seventeen times.
Some of these amendments represent consequential changes to
institutional rules: for instance, the Twelfth Amendment (1804) altered
the rules for electing the vice president, the Fourteenth Amendment
(1868) defined citizenship rules, the Twenty-Second Amendment (1951)
introduced presidential term limits, the Twentieth (1933) and
Twenty-Fifth (1967) Amendments clarified succession procedures, and the
Fifteenth (1870), Nineteenth (1920), Twenty-Fourth (1964), and
Twenty-Sixth (1971) Amendments established who could vote (allowed all
races to vote, extended the franchise to women, removed poll taxes, and
changed the voting age to eighteen). Other amendments, although not
changes to the rules by which leaders are chosen, were of monumental
importance: the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery, and the
Sixteenth Amendment (1913) authorized income tax. The Eighteenth (1919)
and Twenty-First (1933) Amendments dealt with Prohibition and its
repeal, perhaps a less salient topic unless you are really partial to
wine.</p>
<p>While we don’t want to diminish the importance of these changes, and
amendments fifteen, nineteen, twenty-four, and twenty-six clearly
altered the size of the winning coalition and selectorate by increasing
the number of voters, the electoral rules by which the US chooses
leaders remain largely unchanged after more than two hundred years. In a
letter to James Madison dated September 6, 1789, Thomas Jefferson argued
that the Constitution needed to be revised with every generation: “No
society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The
earth belongs always to the living generation.”2 That the system that
these men and the other Founding Fathers created has endured largely
unchanged is all the more surprising given the transformation of the US.
Since 1790, its population has grown eighty-five-fold and its land mass
has increased by a factor of 4.4 (and that includes counting territories
rather than just states in 1790). The economic change is nearly
incomprehensible. In 1790 the US was an economic backwater of
smallholder farmers with a GDP of about billion (in current dollars).
Today the US economy is the largest in the world with a GDP of close to
1 trillion—that’s a staggering five-thousand-fold increase (yes, we had
to do the math several times to believe it). What better advertisement
could there be for crafting rules for large-coalition governance? It
also makes clear why the people of the United States would want to
preserve democratic institutions.</p>
<p>The US rules of political competition have been remarkably stable,
though major constitutional amendments have increased the size of the
winning coalition (amendments fifteen, nineteen, twenty-four, and
twenty-six, for instance). Other democracies experience significant rule
changes, although, as we shall see, only modest changes in coalition
size. For instance, as the result of a referendum in 1993, New Zealand
switched from a first-past-the-post (the British Westminster style)
electoral system to a multimembered proportional representation system
(parties get seats in proportion to their vote shares). Superficially,
New Zealand politics appears much changed. Prior to 1993, there were
only two major parties, but after reform the number of competitive
parties increased, often necessitating coalition governments. To a
political scientist who studies electoral systems, these differences are
huge. In terms of selectorate theory, the referendum resulted in a small
increase in the size of the winning coalition; by our measure on the 0
to 1 scale, the set of essentials increased from 0.90 in 1993 to 0.93
after the reform. Hardly an enormous change, but it was in the direction
of expansion.</p>
<p>The rules by which leaders are chosen may remain relatively
unchanged, as in the US experience, or they may change markedly, as was
the case in New Zealand. In either case, once leaders are beholden to
very large numbers of supporters, they remain so. Who the leaders are
may change rapidly, but their dependence on a large coalition
endures.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the past 230 years, there are not even a handful of
examples of governments that depended on a winning coalition equal to at
least 0.9 on our 0 to 1 coalition-measurement scale whose coalition
subsequently shrank below 0.7. The few cases that do exist involve the
external impact of the conquest of these nations by, for instance, Nazi
Germany or the Soviet Union. In contrast, there are more than two
hundred cases of at least a 0.2-point loss in coalition size for
governments that did not have really big essential groups to begin with.
Once a nation gets large governance institutions, these institutions
survive.3</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 shows the persistence of large-coalition systems of
governance. We classified regimes as being “large coalition” if they had
a coalition of at least 0.9 on our 0 to 1 scale. All other regimes are
classified as “smaller coalition.” For the years 1970, 1980, 1990, and
2000, we compared by how much coalition size changed for initially
large-coalition or initially smaller-coalition regimes over the
following twenty years. We could have chosen different decades or looked
at longer or shorter changes; the pattern is the same.</p>
<p>The white bars indicate the number of initially smaller-coalition
governments whose essentials group changed by the amount shown on the
horizontal axis during the twenty years periods. The black bars show the
same information but for large-coalition regimes.</p>
<p>While many smaller-coalition nations experienced only modest change
in institutions, a significant number experienced large contractions or
expansions covering more than half the 0-to-1 scale. The changes in the
institutions of nations that started with a large coalition (the black
bars) look quite different. They are clustered around zero. That means
there is very little change in the institutions of nations that start
with large coalitions. The tallest black bar indicates that most systems
that start with a large coalition expand slightly over the next twenty
years. This is especially remarkable because when they start near the
top of the scale there is very little room for improvement but a lot of
potential to slip. Yet very few nations with a lot of essentials slip in
their coalition size, and even fewer slip by a significant amount. The
largest decline shown in the graph is Poland’s.</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 is pretty encouraging. The historical record supports the
persistence of democracy. But don’t get us wrong. Even mature
democracies are a little malleable, with the emphasis on the word
little. Overturning really close elections, for example, is feasible
even in the most mature of democracies. Who, after all, can truly say
with confidence that Al Gore or George W. Bush clearly won Florida in
2000 and so won the Electoral College and the presidency in that
remarkably close election? The margin was razor thin. In other cases,
rules overturn substantial leads. In the 1824 US election Andrew Jackson
beat his nearest rival, John Quincy Adams, by 12 percent in the popular
vote. However, with four candidates in the race, his 43 percent vote
share was not enough to win outright, and so the House of
Representatives got to decide. In what is often described as the
“corrupt bargain,” Henry Clay, Speaker of the House, orchestrated a deal
by which Adams would be elected president and in return Clay would
become secretary of state. This seeming injustice angered many, and they
responded by kicking out Adams and electing Jackson four years
later.</p>
<p>Figure 10.1: Change in Coalition Size over Twenty Years</p>
<p>Of course, who won mattered a great deal to Bush and to Gore and to
Adams and to Jackson, but either way, the outcome did not materially
alter the institutionally required size of a winning coalition in the
United States. But when the electoral outcome is clear instead of
insanely close, it is almost impossible—in fact, maybe it is
impossible—to shrink a really-large-coalition system into a meaningfully
smaller one from within so as to overturn the will of the voters.
Democracies have a malleable coalition but not one that is so elastic
that it can be stretched to the point that it is not recognizable.</p>
<p>Take a look back at Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1. That figure shows a wide
range of coalition sizes in places that are regularly identified as
democracies. One of the democracies in the figure, India, suffered a
serious governmental setback during the 1970s when then prime minister
Indira Gandhi maneuvered to shrink the governing coalition to the point
that it became barely recognizable. She even amended the constitution in
an effort that many interpreted as her attempt to turn herself into an
autocratic ruler, much as it seems that Donald Trump was trying to do
for himself in 2020. Prime Minister Gandhi was momentarily successful,
but then the electorate perceived that she had gone too far. The upshot
was that she, along with her Congress Party, were thrown out of office
by the voters. In pretty short order, her successor restored India’s
large-coalition institutional requirements just as Figure 1.1 shows
us.4</p>
<p>Today, India’s coalition is again backsliding, as are coalition sizes
in many other democracies. We think that India’s voters will once again
restore reliance on a larger coalition once Prime Minister Narendra Modi
is out of office. We think that will happen in the United States, too,
as Joe Biden restores coalitional requirements that were diminished
somewhat during Donald Trump’s presidency. We are optimistic about the
restoration of a larger national winning coalition in the United States
even though those coalition requirements are under attack in numerous
states. And we think today’s democratic backsliding will reverse in just
about every place that has long-established, robust democratic
institutions. We think that because the logic of political survival
tells us for once to be optimists: big coalitions and the vast number of
everyday people who benefit from them do not easily submit to the will
of a coalition-shrinking leader. In fact, as Figure 10.1 showed us, the
largest-coalition governments, places like modern-day Sweden, Costa
Rica, the United States, Australia, South Korea, Germany, and so forth,
experience a much smaller range in the swings in coalition size compared
with smaller-coalition countries. This is not just a happy fact of
history. The reasons that this is true explain why it is so much easier
to topple large-coalition rulers than it is to topple large-coalition
polities.</p>
<p>Democracy is facing a tough time, but the logic behind our survival
way of thinking tells us that when a government’s group of essentials is
sufficiently large (we’ll explain what that “sufficient” size is in a
moment) then its governmental institutions are resilient. Sure, we
anticipate that many autocratic, small-coalition regimes will persist
long into the future. However, once nations have successfully
transitioned to large-coalition democracies, these institutions become
locked in. The future belongs disproportionately to public
goods–producing large-coalition governments.</p>
<p>BIG AND SMALL COALITIONS ARE INSTITUTIONALLY STABLE; MIDSIZE
COALITIONS ARE NOT!</p>
<p>Naturally, given how much easier it is to please a few people than it
is to please millions, any democratic leader would like to maneuver her
government into becoming more autocratic, but the changes required to
achieve that goal are dangerous to execute. To see why materially
shrinking the coalition is an especially tough order for democrats,
let’s have a look at Figure 10.2. Every detail in this figure, whether
simple, obvious, subtle, complex, or counterintuitive, is rigorously
derived from the game theory logic behind everything we have said and
will say. And it is the story told by the details in this figure that is
the essence behind our optimism that once a coalition has passed beyond
a critical juncture, democratic institutions are here to stay.</p>
<p>Figure 10.2: The Welfare of Citizens and Coalition Members</p>
<p>Okay, we know, your eyes are glazing over—this is one complicated
figure. We will, however, break it down into its critical parts, and it
will be clear that it conveys a powerfully optimistic message for
democracy. Let’s begin by briefly explaining the horizontal and vertical
axes.</p>
<p>The horizontal axis, coalition size, is straightforward. We want to
look at the full range of possible coalitions (holding constant the size
of the pool of people—the selectorate—from which it can be drawn). We
are interested in knowing how the value on the vertical
axis—welfare—changes as the coalition gets bigger. What do we mean by
“welfare”? We mean the sum of the value of public goods and private
goods that individuals receive from their government. Remember that
leaders generate revenue (for example, by taxing income, borrowing,
earning fees, etc.) and spend some of it on public goods in the form of
policies for everyone in society, some on private goods that are enjoyed
only by members of the winning coalition, and any leftover,
discretionary money on whatever they want (such as themselves or pet
projects).</p>
<p>The leader’s welfare (a downward sloping curve, not shown) is greater
when there is lots of discretionary money. That happens when the
coalition is as small as possible and the selectorate is as large as
possible.5 Therefore, leaders want as small a coalition as possible with
as big a selectorate as possible. That way, besides whatever public
benefits they provide—and enjoy—they also get the maximum amount of
discretionary money that they can possibly obtain.</p>
<p>The welfare of those outside the winning coalition, the influentials
and interchangeables (the selectorate), is depicted on the rising,
dashed curve in the figure. They want the coalition to be as large as
possible because they benefit from a leader’s hard work to produce
public goods. Their welfare consists only of these public goods since,
not being in the coalition, they do not get any of the private rewards
provided by the government. Their welfare—the value they attach to the
public goods—increases as the coalition gets bigger and bigger.
Outsiders and the leader have diametrically opposed goals. But neither
leaders nor outsiders can get their way without the support of
insiders—those essentials who determine whether the leader can retain
power or will be swept away.</p>
<p>The welfare of the essentials in the winning coalition is shown by
the swoosh-shaped curve. That curve is a little complicated, but we have
discussed all of the components in preceding chapters, and we can gain
great insight into when governments are stable or unstable by
understanding why the curve in Figure 10.2 looks the way it does. The
benefits gained by coalition members consist of two parts: the value
they attach to the public goods the government provides, and the value
they attach to the private benefits (like corruption opportunities,
better housing, superior schooling for their children, etc.) that they
receive as an exclusive privilege of coalition membership.</p>
<p>To understand the logic behind the swoosh curve, let’s start at the
far left of the figure—that is, in a very-small-winning-coalition
society. In such a society the leader provides few public benefits, so
society is unproductive and poor. But while society is poor, the leader
taxes the people heavily and gives lavishly to his supporters. Each
supporter’s loyalty is bought with private goods. So when the coalition
is tiny, its very few members are rewarded—that is, bribed—with enormous
amounts of private benefits.</p>
<p>What happens as the coalition expands? The graph shows that coalition
welfare drops rapidly as the coalition starts to expand from a small
base. More people need to get a share of the pie, but society has not
gotten much more productive (public goods and freedoms remain rare), so
each essential’s share of benefits diminishes. Each supporter becomes
worse off as the coalition starts to expand. However, beyond a certain
point, further expansion of coalition size increases the coalition’s
welfare. On the right side of the figure, the solid line shows coalition
welfare increasing. The expansion of the coalition still diminishes each
supporter’s share of private goods, but when the coalition is relatively
large, private goods are simply not as important as they were in
tiny-coalition systems. The dilution of private goods is less important
because the coalition’s overall well-being is improving.</p>
<p>As coalition size becomes very large, leaders must compete in the
battle of good policy ideas. At the right side of the figure, expansion
of the coalition means leaders must convince more people that they have
good ideas about improving policy if they are to remain in power. If
those good ideas do not pan out, they will lose some of their essential
supporters and be out of office. To avoid such a horrific outcome,
leaders who rely on a large coalition must work hard to satisfy their
many supporters and cannot divert resources to their pet projects or
secret bank accounts. That is great news for coalition members and
society in general but terrible news for the leader.</p>
<p>The swoosh curve explains much about political change. Leaders always
prefer to rely on a small coalition. The people prefer a leader to need
many supporters. Which institutional changes the essentials within the
coalition will endorse depends on how big the existing coalition is. At
the extreme left of the figure (that is, in the smallest-coalition
systems) the essentials only want to contract the coalition. At the far
right of the figure (that is, in large-coalition systems), coalition
expansion—in other words, further democratization—is the only
institutional change in the coalition’s interest. At intermediate
coalition sizes—at the low point in the center of Figure 10.2—supporters
can improve their lot through purges or coups that diminish the
coalition or by supporting democratic expansion of the coalition. It is
in this middle that institutions churn. At the extremes, supporters are
happy with their lot. In the middle, they are happy to change their
lot.</p>
<p>The welfare of the essentials who keep a leader in power is highest
in very small and very large coalitions, but for very different reasons.
Consider taking a stroll across the thirty-eighth parallel (although not
literally, since it’s covered in land mines), between North and South
Korea. North Korea is a poor nation. Its total GDP is about 8.5 billion,
although of course it is hard to measure it accurately. What is very
clear is that its wealth is not evenly distributed over its twenty-six
million people. Most of the population live isolated lives in remote
towns and villages with little electrification or communications. The
elites have a more rarified lifestyle in the capital, Pyongyang. They
get to live in luxury high-rise buildings and buy luxury goods, such as
German cars, cell phones, flat-screen TVs, designer fashion goods, and
Japanese whiskey. They also get to visit water parks, fairgrounds, a
science museum, and even a dolphinarium. In exchange for staying loyal,
the families of Kim Jong-Un’s essential supporters get to enjoy
subsidized modern housing, fine dining, and luxury goods. At a material
level their lives might even be better than those of the essential
insiders who keep President Moon Jae-In in power below the thirty-eighth
parallel, in South Korea.</p>
<p>Today South Korea is a rich industrial democracy with a per capita
income of about 5,000. Yet until the mid-1970s there was little to
distinguish it economically from the North. Of course, not
coincidentally, the 1970s is when the Republic of Korea, to use its
formal name, began to democratize. Today it ranks twentieth in its
coalition size, with a score of 0.91 on our 0 to 1 scale. The current
president, Moon Jae-In, is from the more left-leaning of the two main
political parties. In the 2017 presidential election he received about
13.5 million votes, but 8 million votes would have been sufficient for
him to defeat the second-place candidate—that is, he was supported by
roughly 15 percent of the population, or 22 percent of the voters. That
is hardly a majority of South Koreans, but it is thousands of times more
supporters than Kim Jong-Un needs.</p>
<p>Moon promotes economic reforms and wants to break up chaebols
(conglomerates that dominate much of the economy). He has increased the
minimum wage by 16 percent and cut the maximum workweek from sixty-eight
hours to fifty-two. The public health measures he implemented largely
contained COVID even though South Korea had a substantial outbreak early
in the pandemic. As you might expect, his supporters tend to be
relatively poor (by South Korean standards) and his policies are
designed to improve their lives. As a rough guide, let’s suppose that
his average supporter earns about twelve million won per year (that is,
about 0,500) and represents the bottom 38 percent of wage earners.
That’s not a lot of money, and such a supporter surely would be priced
out of downtown Seoul. However, such supporters get good basic public
health care and their children get an excellent public education. They
probably have to take public transport to get around; however, in stark
contrast to the other side of the thirty-eighth parallel, there is an
excellent transport network, people can travel wherever they want, and
they say whatever they want and meet with whomever they want while they
are there. Life is pretty good for essential supporters on both sides of
the border, although for very different reasons.</p>
<p>Seoul and Pyongyang are geographically close. Yet a transition
between their political systems is virtually impossible (except via
military conquest). Some elites in North Korea might envy Moon’s
numerous healthy, educated, free but poor supporters. Equally, some
members of the working class in the South might be willing to trade
their freedoms for lavish living if they could be essentials in the
North, a very big if. Yet for neither group does attempting the
transition make sense. To see why, we need only look back at Figure
10.2.</p>
<p>Let’s start in North Korea, on the left side of the figure. On the
left side, the welfare of coalition members increases only if the
coalition gets smaller. Kim’s supporters are willing to support purges
of their fellow coalition members provided, of course, that they are not
among the purged. Purges result in fewer people having a share of the
private goods to be distributed—the dolphinarium won’t be so crowded at
their next visit, and there might be vacancies on the penthouse floor.
Expanding the coalition makes little sense for them because doing so
would dilute their share of the goodies. The polity might start down the
road to democratization, but before they get far the leader and
coalition members will realize that expansion harms their welfare. On
the left of the figure, the interests of the leader and his small band
of cronies coincide. Provided the leader is healthy, such systems are
virtually immune to change. Supporters are loyal and the people are
powerless to rise up. Of course, things can get more volatile when the
leader’s health declines, but so long as that does not happen, the
leader’s and his coalition’s interests are aligned, and the masses are
too poor, isolated, and oppressed to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Now consider working-class supporters of Moon in the South who
hypothetically prefer riches to freedoms. They might go to the North
(virtually no one does) to try to become part of that country’s winning
coalition. Embarking on such a transition is a perilous journey for
them. Speaking extremely generously, they have less than a one in many,
many thousands chance of making it into and then remaining in the
coalition. And their effort to get into the coalition comes with their
own reduced welfare during their journey from South to North. Moon needs
millions of supporters; Kim needs, generously, a few thousand—probably
far, far fewer. They are unlikely to be among those few whose support is
essential in the North.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some coalition members and some people in the South
might try to emulate the small coalition structure that prevails in the
North. But most coalition members and most of the people will resist any
attempt by South Koreans to emulate North Korea’s government structure.
The mathematics of coalition welfare is such that essential supporters
in large coalitions can make themselves better off only by continuing to
expand the coalition, shifting further to the figure’s right, not its
left.</p>
<p>In large democratic systems there is some wiggle room: often
coalition members don’t fully realize the consequences of the policies
they support. But if a leader tries to significantly and overtly
contract the winning coalition, then the people will protest, supporters
will start to defect, and the democratic leader will become a former
leader. Donald Trump attempted to restrict the franchise by limiting
immigration, making it harder for his opponents to vote, and undermining
the press with claims of “fake news,” not to mention leaning on voting
officials and inciting his supporters to storm Congress. These were all
actions intended to reduce the number of supporters he would need to
rule—a contraction in the coalition’s size. Yet as he tried to enact
these changes, he was still constrained by the large-coalition,
democratic institutions in which he operated. While we might point to
differences in how law enforcement treated those who demonstrated in
support of Trump and how it treated those who protested against him, the
people had freedoms that allowed them to protest, and they did so.</p>
<p>People turned out to vote in record numbers in the 2020 presidential
election; turnout was 7.5 percent higher than in 2016. In part the
election was about the policies that Trump and Joe Biden each advocated.
Trump’s policies were extremely popular with his supporters, and by
voting for him they hoped to get their preferred policies (that is, they
wanted to be in the winning coalition, or at least be supporters of it),
but those policies would have come at the cost of inferior democratic
institutions—a smaller winning coalition moving forward. Such a
contraction would have meant worse governance in the future. For many
Trump supporters the package of “our guy today” and less public-spirited
governance by someone else in the future was better than Biden today.
But for some it was not. It is telling that Republicans in, for
instance, Georgia and Wisconsin did much better in down-ballot races in
2020 than Trump did.6 And, for those outside Trump’s coalition, there
was only downside in his election. Biden ran on a platform that included
keeping the coalition large. Over eighty-two million voters turned out
to support Biden, in part to protect the institutions that they
valued.</p>
<p>The voters rejected Trump’s overt attempt to contract the coalition.
But Trump was not the first president to suffer a rebuff from the
voters. That honor—probably better described as a dishonor—goes to the
second president, John Adams, for his imposition of the Alien and
Sedition Acts. These acts (there were actually four of them) are pretty
well described by their names. The Alien Acts discriminated against
recent immigrants, making it harder for them to become citizens and,
therefore, to gain the right to vote. It won’t shock you to learn that
recent immigrants back in 1804 disproportionately voted for Jefferson’s
Democratic-Republican Party and not for Adams’s Federalist Party. The
Sedition Acts made it a crime to defame the government and were intended
to curtail criticism of the Adams administration. The backlash against
these policies was enormous. In the 1800 election Adams received only
38.6 percent of the popular vote, and Jefferson became president. The
voters’ rebuke of Trump seems mild by comparison.</p>
<p>Voters in large coalitions enjoy their democracy, or rather the good
policies it provides, and they reject those who openly try to undermine
it. Once the coalition becomes sufficiently large, only the leader
stands to gain from its contraction. As the logic presented in Figure
10.2 shows, once coalitions are very large they stay that way.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look back at Figure 10.2 to be more precise about where
the risk of coups and mass rebellions is greatest and where it is
virtually nonexistent. Notice the vertical gray line near the upper
bound of coalition size. That line denotes the coalition size at which
the expected welfare of any coalition member is as good as their best
achievable welfare when the coalition is at its smallest. If we ran a
horizontal line from the high point of coalition welfare that is
expected by the smallest coalition to the largest, it would intersect
the swoosh curve before the possible maximum coalition size, indicating
that more welfare is available for coalition members if the essential
group is larger than the intersection point for the proposed horizontal
line. Of course, very few people enjoy a high level of well-being when
the coalition is tiny and a great many enjoy it when the coalition is as
large as where the vertical gray line is located (at about 0.8 on the
coalition scale).</p>
<p>Look a little to the left of that vertical line. Coalition welfare is
declining along with coalition size. It keeps declining until we reach
the lowest coalition-welfare point on the graph. Although essentials
might not notice a small wiggle downward, they are in the coalition for
the benefits it offers them. They are, therefore, paying attention to
whether the incumbent is taking good care of them with an eye to whether
they should throw their backing behind someone else. If the coalition
shrinks, then some of its former members must have been purged, a fact
that is not likely to be missed by those who remain. They are probably
okay with a purge that left their benefits in place. But their benefits
are shrinking. That, of course, is exactly what is happening as we move
left of the right-hand vertical line. Look to the right of that vertical
line. People in the coalition expect to be better off the bigger the
coalition gets beyond that point. As a consequence, there is a huge
difference in the trajectory of well-being just to the left and just to
the right of the gray line.</p>
<p>To the left, coalition welfare can be improved in two different ways.
The incumbent ruler can purge members from the coalition, shrinking the
essential group, so that those who survive the purge are better off than
they were before the purge. That’s probably what happened after Saddam
Hussein finished his videotaped purge of Ba’ath Party leaders in 1979.
Or the leader can expand the coalition enough to improve the welfare of
everyone in it, making the government more accountable. That was the
path eventually followed by J.J. Rawlings in Ghana. Either way, those in
the coalition can be well off.</p>
<p>Leaders naturally prefer to purge people, thereby improving their own
welfare, but such purges can be risky, as we discussed in Chapter 2. If
coalition members anticipate a purge and fear that they will be ousted
from the coalition, then they may initiate a coup d’état to overthrow
the incumbent and set up a new regime that is better for them. Likewise,
if some of those excluded from the coalition anticipate that it is going
to be further diminished, reducing public goods along the way, there may
be a mass uprising or revolt intended to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>If we move to the right of the right-hand vertical line, then the
incentives to stage a coup or a revolution all but disappear. Once we
are even a tiny bit to the right of the vertical line, the coalition’s
welfare can only get worse if the coalition is diminished in size and it
can only get better if it is enlarged. Hence, once a government is
sufficiently democratic to be to the right of this gray line, just about
no one in the winning coalition should be expected to support purges.
Sure, a leader might find some outsiders to try to overturn the existing
order. Those outsiders would have to think that a revolt would probably
get them into the next winning coalition, giving them access to private
benefits that they otherwise could not get. But they would have an
awfully hard time raising broad support for their effort, and they would
need that broad support to topple the existing institutions. That,
remember, is why we don’t expect poor South Koreans to migrate to the
North in the hope of making it into Kim Jong-Un’s coalition. After all,
most people in democracies like South Korea are on the dashed line. They
are getting tons of public goods when their government’s coalition is to
the right of that right-hand vertical line. They are much more likely to
end up worse off rather than better off by supporting an effort to
shrink the coalition. As we already know, the same is true for those in
the coalition. That is exactly the implication of the swoosh-shaped line
in Figure 10.2, a shape determined by the logic of selectorate
reasoning.7</p>
<p>When the January 6, 2021, invasion of the Capitol is looked at with
an understanding of Figure 10.2, it is easy to see why the
insurrectionists failed. There was no way for them to succeed: there
just were not enough people who could be made better off by supporting
the effort to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election.
Sure, those trying to stop the certification of Biden’s election were
making an effort to get into or stay in the winning coalition, or at
least the support coalition. Presumably, they perceived that they were
being purged by those forming Biden’s coalition. Their problem was that
there were enough defections away from Trump that Trump no longer
commanded a winning coalition. Since the winning coalition was almost
certainly on the right side of the gray line, those trying to save Trump
were on a hopeless fool’s errand.8 They simply could have had no
reasonable expectation of mustering enough support to halt Biden’s
larger coalition.</p>
<p>Knowing the risks and the costs of purges, large-coalition leaders or
aspiring leaders in large-coalition settings almost never take actions
that are likely to result in attempted coups d’état or revolutions.
Being survival oriented, they have the foresight to avoid actions that
will lead their coalition or the general citizenry to rise up against
them.</p>
<p>As we saw, if the group of essentials is large enough, the government
is practically immune from coups and mass uprisings as a matter of
logic. But how about the circumstances confronted by
really-small-coalition incumbents? By looking at the left-hand gray
vertical line in Figure 10.2, we learn that a region exists for
sufficiently small coalitions in which the regime is also virtually
immune from mass uprisings and coups. The consequence is the same as in
very-large-coalition settings, but the reasoning is a bit different.</p>
<p>In the large-coalition environment, in places like the United States,
people get so many public goods that they have little incentive to
revolt; they are already getting lots of what they want. When the
coalition is really small—as when it is to the left of the left-hand
gray vertical line—the people are miserable and the very few coalition
members are very happy. So the people would love to revolt, but they get
virtually no free speech to raise complaints, no free press to know that
others are unhappy too, and no freedom of assembly to make it possible
for them to coordinate with each other. Sounds a lot like conditions in
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (that is, North Korea), where
the government is not democratic, it is not serving the people’s
interests, and it is not a representative republic. Lacking the ability
to organize, the people do not rebel because the costs of doing so
exceed the expected benefits. Put succinctly, they know that if they
rebel, they will almost certainly fail. So, to the left of the left-hand
gray line, revolts do not happen because their costs are too high and
the people’s prospects of success are too low. And, of course, coups do
not happen for the same reason that they don’t happen when the coalition
exceeds the size at the right-hand gray line: the coalition is flush
with benefits and so its members have no incentive to overthrow the
leader who is magnanimous to them.</p>
<p>Okay, we have seen the logic. Certainly, logic is well and good, but
of course you will want to know that real governments in the real world
work the way Figure 10.2 indicates.9 Fair enough. Let’s have a look at
evidence. Figure 10.3 shows us the odds of actual attempted coups and
revolutions across national governments from 1789 to 2020.10 The graph
covers the entire spectrum of coalition sizes in the real world. We are
looking at a lot of governments and a lot of time, so we can be pretty
confident that Figure 10.3 is giving us a good, representative view of
the actual odds of coups and revolutions across regimes ranging from the
smallest to the largest coalitions. The picture couldn’t be clearer.</p>
<p>Figure 10.3: Make the Coalition Big or Small Enough and the Risk of
Coups and Revolutions Disappears</p>
<p>The risk of violent government turnover is practically zero, nada,
nil, when a government relies on a tiny or an enormous proportion of the
population as essentials. The chances of a coup or revolution rise as
the essential group gets bigger up to a turning point, after which, the
more accountable the government becomes, the lower the chances of the
regime being violently deposed whether by coup or mass revolt. At the
top of the coalition scale, coups and revolutions just about never
happen. This is just what the logic behind Figure 10.2 told us, and it
is just what we know has actually happened across the world and across
nearly a quarter of a millennium.</p>
<p>Knowing that it is really dangerous to gamble on wholesale reductions
in coalition size, democratic rulers, who live at the right-hand end of
Figure 10.2, have to operate in a narrow band of low-risk changes to the
number of essentials. They have a little wiggle room, to be sure, but
that is it. They may adjust the number of essentials modestly, but if
they try for a big, transformative reduction, as Indira Gandhi did and
as Donald Trump did, they are likely to find themselves unemployed.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s tacit—and sometimes even explicit—effort to shrink the
size of the required US winning coalition between the run-up to Election
Day, November 3, 2020, and January 6, 2021, when Congress certified the
electoral outcome, illustrates the sorts of maneuvers that democratic
leaders can try and how hard those maneuvers are to carry off
successfully. Selectorate logic tells us why those efforts were, are,
and always will be extremely unlikely to succeed. Let’s go step by step
through some of the efforts by leaders like Trump and others to
illustrate the dangers that any democratic government may face. We start
with widely used techniques to shape the postelection assessment of
results and then move on to narrower and, ultimately, illegitimate
efforts. As we look at these maneuvers, we should keep in mind that many
of these sorts of efforts can succeed anywhere that is to the left of
the right-hand gray line in Figure 10.2, but they are extremely unlikely
to succeed to the right of that line, where the coalition is already
very large.</p>
<p>The stories of Brazil, the United States, and the Philippines
illustrate how small differences in the size of the essential group can
dramatically alter the course of democracy. As we write, Brazil and the
Philippines are governed and the United States was recently governed,
until January 20, 2021, by individuals who seem strongly inclined to
make themselves into autocrats. We are prepared to bet that Brazil’s
Jair Bolsonaro will fail in any such effort. Donald Trump has so far
failed, and we believe he will continue to fail in his effort. We are
not prepared, however, to say with confidence that the Philippines’
president, Rodrigo Duterte, will not turn himself into a new
dictator.</p>
<p>All three of these presidents have records of remarkable intolerance
for democratic norms and have openly displayed their inclination to
tolerate—or promote—governance by violence. But they face (or faced)
radically different electoral rules and different coalition sizes. Those
differences probably place Duterte to the left of the right-hand
vertical line in Figure 10.2 while Brazil and the United States are
almost certainly to the right of it. That means that Bolsonaro can tweak
the rules, as Trump tried to do, but he cannot fundamentally alter them.
Duterte will find it challenging, but he might be able to shift the
coalition in the Philippines far to the left.</p>
<p>Back in 1980, Brazil had a military dictatorship and the Philippines
was governed by dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Their winning coalitions were
almost the same size: 0.42 under Brazil’s João Figueiredo and 0.49 under
Marcos. The United States back then was structured pretty much as it is
today. Its winning coalition size on our scale was a hefty 0.96. By the
late 1980s Brazil and the Philippines were on the move toward democracy.
By 1987, with Marcos ousted from power, the Philippines’ coalition shot
up to 0.71, almost exactly where Brazil was two years earlier; both were
well behind the United States, which was still at 0.96. But then the
paths parted ways. Today, Duterte depends on a coalition of 0.71, the
same size it’s been in the Philippines for the past thirty-five years.
Brazil’s Bolsonaro, in contrast, depends on a coalition of 0.92, meaning
that as much as he might wish to alter the system, he faces an extremely
steep uphill struggle in trying to do so. The United States backslid
slightly during the Trump years, down to 0.94. The US and Brazilian
coalitions appear to be too big for a meaningful retreat from
democracy.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro’s election may have been a perfect storm: his two immediate
predecessors had been caught up in corruption charges and were ousted
from power. Brazil’s most popular politician, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,
had been expected to contest the election but was barred by the courts
from running because of his own corruption conviction. With Lula out of
the picture, Bolsonaro won a runoff election with 46 percent of the vote
in the first round and 55 percent in the second. And he inherited
reasonably functional legislative and judicial branches.</p>
<p>Trump’s election was much the same as Bolsonaro’s—that is, a perfect
storm. He lost the popular vote by a substantial margin but won easily
in the Electoral College, a peculiar coalition-reducing institution that
is unique to the United States. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, was
caught up in hints of scandal that turned out to be without foundation,
but that allowed Trump to deflect attention from his own alleged
scandals. With nearly 130 million votes cast, a shift of fewer than
80,000 would have tipped the election into Clinton’s corner.</p>
<p>Duterte also won election to his presidency but under less demanding
rules than were faced in Brazil. While Bolsonaro required a majority of
the vote by the second round, Duterte only needed more votes than the
second-place finisher in a one-round, first-past-the-post system. As we
know, first-past-the-post elections normally translate into two-party
contests, but that was not true when Duterte was elected in 2018. Five
candidates ran for president, with results of 39 percent for Duterte,
and 23.5 percent, 21.4 percent, 12.7 percent, and 3.4 percent for the
other candidates. Obviously, Duterte needed much less support in the
Philippines than Bolsonaro required in Brazil. So, with the difference
in their coalition sizes in mind, what tricks can they play—what tricks
can any large-coalition leader play—to improve their odds of holding
office by shrinking their coalition?</p>
<p>WHOSE VOTES COUNT?</p>
<p>Democracies provide their leaders with lots of ways to shape who does
or does not vote. Of course, incumbents (or their political party if
there are term limits) never want to suppress votes by their backers,
but they would love to reduce turnout by those who do not support them.
Eliminating voters helps to diminish the size of the winning
coalition—every leader’s dream. However, in most democracies restricting
who can vote also reduces the availability of future coalition members
in proportion to the shrinking selectorate, and this diminishes loyalty.
Of course, it is still better for a leader to need half of a small pool
of voters than half of a large pool of voters, but nirvana for a leader
is to shrink the coalition while simultaneously expanding the pool of
people who can be in it.</p>
<p>In the good old days, before Lenin worked out the benefits of having
many interchangeables along with few essentials, coalitions were kept
small by preventing the riffraff—folks who might vote for “radical”
politicians—from voting. The mob could easily be suppressed by requiring
meaningful property ownership as an enfranchisement requirement. That
definitely kept the coalition small. Rich, property-owning people have
never been the bulk of any society. But then property ownership went out
of fashion.</p>
<p>The Philippines banned property ownership as a criterion for voting
in its 1987 constitution as it emerged from decades of Marcos’s
dictatorship. Brazil, with mandatory voting for all citizens between the
ages of eighteen and seventy, has had no property requirement for voting
since 1881. In the young United States, most states had eliminated
property requirements for voting by the 1828 presidential election, a
contest between John Quincy Adams (the first-ever National Republican
Party candidate, not to be confused with Lincoln’s Republicans) and
Andrew Jackson (the first-ever Democratic Party candidate).</p>
<p>With the elimination of a property requirement for voting, turnout in
the United States expanded dramatically, from 3.4 percent of the
population in 1824 to a “whopping” 9.5 percent in 1828. The winning
coalition had gotten bigger, but it was still darn small. Still, there
must have been enormous pressure behind this change, because it almost
certainly was not a big benefit for those who had previously been
essentials and it surely was a deadweight loss for the incumbent, John
Quincy Adams. Of course, for candidate Jackson, expanding the coalition
was his ticket to winning office. That is one of the beautiful features
in nascent democracies with honest elections: increasing the coalition
can be the pathway to election and, as we discussed, once sufficiently
increased it is hard to shrink it again.</p>
<p>In Brazil, fear of an expanded electorate following the elimination
of a property requirement for voting led to the Savaria Law in 1881.
That legislation, while nominally expanding who was eligible to vote,
cleverly also restricted who could actually vote simply by requiring
literacy. The literacy requirement all but eliminated the right to vote
for the recently liberated former slaves in Brazil, for example. The
elite had found a way to lock in a small winning coalition (of about
0.46) despite the official expansion of the selectorate to include
former slaves, non-Catholics, and citizens as young as twenty-one.</p>
<p>Nascent democracies have plenty of tools to work with to keep voting
down. Finland, the first European country to grant the right to vote to
women, didn’t do so until 1906. The USA’s Nineteenth Amendment, giving
women the right to vote, was ratified in 1920; Brazil did not allow
women to vote until 1932; the Philippines, not until 1937. Switzerland
waited until 1971! The United States, like Brazil, prevented women,
formerly enslaved people, and illiterate people from voting. That way,
these “democracies” could keep the “wrong” prospective voters out of the
ballot box. Many southern states in the United States also added a tax
on voting, a poll tax, as a way to keep the poor from casting votes,
just as a property and literacy requirement had done in Brazil.</p>
<p>Alternatively, rather than making it hard to vote, you could just not
let the mob cast votes for president at all. In the same 1828 election
in which property requirements had been largely dropped, Delaware and
South Carolina continued to use their state legislatures to pick
electors for the Electoral College. South Carolina’s and Delaware’s
citizens had no direct say in choosing their state’s electors. Remember
that when we get around to the United States’ 2020 election—and
beyond!</p>
<p>Restricting who can vote in democracies keeps down the size of the
essential group since, especially in a two-party race, the winning
coalition’s size depends significantly on the selectorate’s size. So
suppressing votes is entirely understandable for those, like John Quincy
Adams, who could not win with an enlarged electorate. As Donald Trump,
perhaps quite correctly, observed during an appearance on the TV show
Fox and Friends in the spring of 2020, Democrats “had… levels of voting
that if you’d ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected
in this country again.”11</p>
<p>Voter suppression is remarkably widespread to this day. Israel
historically made it hard for Arab Israelis to form political parties
and apparently made voting by Arab citizens unattractive. Arab Israeli
turnout tends to be substantially lower than mostly Jewish, European
Israeli turnout. The reduced Arab turnout is a consequence of
disillusionment mixed with variation in the designation of voting days.
The shifting days for voting is believed by some to be designed to
suppress Arab voting, much as defeated efforts in 2021 to prevent voting
on Sundays in the state of Georgia seemed intended to eliminate “souls
to the polls” efforts by Black churches intent on increasing turnout by
their parishioners. The selection of different, sometimes unique dates
for voting, recall, is how Robert Rizzo and his crowd turned Bell,
California, into a charter city through voter suppression. Efforts like
Rizzo’s can really work well when the required coalition is already
small, but when such procedures are introduced to shrink an established
large coalition, trouble is likely to follow. Rizzo and company got away
with their electoral distortion for a while, but ultimately it was
discovered, and he and his Bell cronies were packed off to jail.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that suppressing votes after the coalition has been
enlarged can be risky business, politicians must always be open to other
ways to rig seemingly fair elections in their favor. In fact, it isn’t
necessary to suppress votes by opponents to win even when they are more
popular than you. You can always try to arrange how votes contribute to
electoral outcomes. In a series of decisions between 1962 and 1964, the
United States Supreme Court determined that state electoral districts
must be approximately equal to one another in population so that the
principle of one person, one vote applied throughout the land. Of
course, equal populations by district more or less assures that all
districts have about the same number of people in their selectorate, but
it does not assure that all districts have an equal number of people in
their winning coalition. While courts may not distinguish between
selectorate size and winning coalition size, political parties
definitely do. The principle of one person, one vote is readily
manipulated to shape how much any individual’s vote counts toward
winning, even when the votes are honestly counted. Indeed, the
manipulation of district composition by political parties so as to rig
election outcomes is almost as old as the United States.</p>
<p>Before the United States was even a quarter of a century old,
Elbridge Gerry, then the governor of Massachusetts (who was later the
vice president from 1813 to 1814), helped create the practice of
gerrymandering. This practice is named in his “honor” and in recognition
of the salamander-shaped district he created. He did so to assure
victory by his Democrat-Republican Party in Massachusetts in 1810.
Gerry’s ability to redraw the electoral lines is all the more remarkable
when you realize that Massachusetts was a Federalist stronghold. In the
popular presidential vote in 1812, Democrat-Republican James Madison
received only 35 percent of the vote, yet the Democrat-Republican Party
took eleven of twenty congressional seats. Drawing district boundaries
to give one’s party an electoral advantage remains a robust practice to
this very day, a practice engaged in by each American political party
when it has the chance. And it is not limited to the United States. The
Manila Times reported on April 21, 2019, that the Philippine province of
Palawan had been gerrymandered.12 And why not? It’s a great way to
virtually assure electoral victory.</p>
<p>As we saw in Chapter 3, gerrymandering helps the majority party in a
state group voters so their opponents win in a very few districts by
overwhelming margins and assuredly lose by closer votes in as large a
share of districts as possible. Gerrymandering is great for a state’s
controlling party, but population relocations, shifts in party efforts
to mobilize their voters or suppress the opposition’s voters, and other
changing conditions can weaken its beneficial effects. For instance, put
a life-threatening crisis into the mix, like the COVID-19 pandemic in
2020, and other techniques may be needed to make sure the “right” party
wins.</p>
<p>During the 2020 presidential campaign, the Trump administration made
heroic efforts to delegitimize high Democratic voter turnout by
condemning mail-in ballots, saying that they were rife with voter fraud.
The mail-in ballots, normally mostly Republican, skewed heavily in favor
of Democrats, many of whom feared voting in person because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans, being less worried about COVID-19, voted
more often in person. So, naturally, Republican-dominated state
governments looked for ways to keep Democrats from voting. And, of
course, where Democrats were in control they looked for ways to register
and turn out more Democratic-leaning voters than Republican-leaning.
When the Republican efforts to prevent Democratic voters from turning
out failed, then president Trump focused on more inventive means by
trying to alter who counted votes and how. He looked for ways to alter
the size of the winning coalition so that he could win with fewer votes
and so that Democrats could lose with more. As we know from Figure 10.2,
his efforts were likely to fail, and they did.</p>
<p>HOW TO MAKE VOTES COUNT DIFFERENTLY</p>
<p>In its 1989 election, Kenya introduced a new voting system called
queue voting. As the name suggests, voters queued up behind a sign
designating the name of the candidate they supported. Then an official
counted the voters behind each sign. If, by some terrible error, the
“wrong” candidate looked like a winner, the problem was readily solved:
the official just changed the tally.13 Who counted the votes mattered
more than how people voted.</p>
<p>It seems, at first blush, pretty straightforward to go from casting
votes to summing up the votes and working out who the winner and the
loser(s) were in each constituency, recognizing that to win in, for
instance, a first-past-the-post system, all a candidate needs in any
constituency is one more vote than whoever comes in second.
Large-coalition governments and even rigged-election autocracies have
been counting votes for centuries, albeit in quite different ways. Of
course, in rigged-election regimes everyone expects the vote counter,
not the actual votes, to determine who won, just as was the case in some
districts in Kenya in 1989. That’s how it works these days in Russia, in
Turkey, in Venezuela, seemingly in Tanzania, and in lots and lots of
other places, including in some situations in the United States.</p>
<p>Every now and then elections are super close. In such cases, votes
need to be counted and recounted, not so much to manipulate the size and
composition of the winning coalition but rather honestly to discover it.
In 2020, however, seemingly new, surprising issues were promoted to
influence vote counting in the United States for the express purpose of
shrinking the coalition while altering the outcome. These efforts
failed, but they scared a lot of people across the entire political
spectrum. They were right to be scared. Their fear was part of the
inevitable corrective pressure that prevents dishonesty from defeating
the truth in large-coalition systems. And that, as we said, makes us
optimistic about the future of really-large-coalition, mature
democracies.</p>
<p>IS THE UNITED STATES’ DEMOCRACY FRAGILE?</p>
<p>The United States Constitution sets out the essential elements for
determining the size of a presidential winning coalition. The size of
the Electoral College is precisely set out in the Constitution’s Article
II, section 1: “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the
Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole
Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be
entitled in the Congress.” With a few restrictions on who can be an
elector, this brief statement is the essence of the Electoral College’s
existence.</p>
<p>The consequence today of this brief passage is, just as its
consequence was in 1787, to produce a tremendous distortion in the
notion that each citizen’s vote counts equally. It absolutely defies the
notion of one person, one vote when it comes to assessing the voters who
were in the winning coalition. But then, in 1787 the United States had a
pretty small winning coalition as a proportion of the population, and
today that coalition is tremendously large.</p>
<p>Putting aside the phrase “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as
the Legislature thereof may direct” for the moment, back in 1787, when
an enslaved person counted as three-fifths of a person for the purpose
of assigning each state its apportionment of congressional seats, the
enumeration of electors greatly favored states where slavery was legal:
their congressional numbers were inflated because the very people who
had zero say in how they were governed were counted among the
population. Today, the calculation of electors hugely favors states with
few people in them. For example, Wyoming gets one vote in the Electoral
College for about every 194,000 of its residents. Texas, in contrast,
gets one vote in the Electoral College for about every 773,000
residents. In other words, each voter in Wyoming counts as much as four
voters in Texas when it comes to choosing members of the Electoral
College.</p>
<p>The Electoral College structure is hardwired in favor of
low-population states, and for whatever reason, many of those states
lean Republican. The upshot is that in 2020, to win the presidency, the
Democrat (Biden) needed a substantially larger voter coalition to
achieve a winning coalition in the Electoral College than did the
Republican (Trump). Of course, at other times in American history, the
opposite would have been true. The key is that the Electoral College
greatly distorts the support group needed to go from votes to election.
It favors whichever political party is preferred in the less-populated
states, whose voters are grossly overrepresented. It simply takes far
fewer voters in less-populous states to elect the president of the
United States than it takes in the more-populous states. Andrew Jackson
understood this back in 1832 and so campaigned against the Electoral
College. He failed, and low-population-state politicians prevent
overturning the Electoral College to this day.</p>
<p>Because of the distortion in how many electoral votes each state has
on a per capita basis—that is, on the principle of one person, one
vote—the presidential winning coalition can be surprisingly small
(though still very large by world standards) if the winning candidate
gets her or his votes distributed just right. We already know that
Abraham Lincoln was remarkably skilled on that very front. But, as
Article II, section 1 of the Constitution tells us, and as the cases of
South Carolina and Delaware in 1828 remind us, the Constitution does not
require that voters elect the president. Indeed, the United States
Supreme Court and the state supreme court in Florida could not have been
clearer on this point in Bush v. Gore in 2000. They both echoed the
judgment in the Supreme Court’s ruling in McPherson v. Blacker (1892):
“The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for
Electors for the President of the United States.”14 Remember, the
Constitution stipulates that “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner
as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to
the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may
be entitled in the Congress” (emphasis added). What might that mean for
the size of the essential group in the United States?</p>
<p>Let us suppose, to keep things simple, that each legislator in each
state is elected in a two-party race. Then, to win, each assemblyperson
needs one-half of the vote plus one in his or her district. To control a
state legislature, a party needs half the seats plus one, each seat won
in half the districts by half the vote plus one. To win the Electoral
College, ignoring the distortion in favor of less-populous states—a
distortion that further shrinks the hypothetical coalition—half the
state legislatures need to control half of their assembly plus one to
vote for the winning candidate, such that the chosen electors add up to
270 Electoral College votes. To get an Electoral College majority under
this set of assumptions, remembering that these assumptions enlarge the
coalition relative to Constitutional requirements, we have ½ the state
assemblies times ½ their members times ½ of those members’ district
votes, or a winning coalition equal to one-eighth of the electorate that
chose state legislators!</p>
<p>But wait, that is still too big. This calculation assumes the whole
selectorate has turned out. However, midterm elections, when many state
assemblies are chosen, have low voter turnout. Turnout in 2018 was 49.4
percent, and that was the highest level for midterm elections in more
than a century. Being extremely generous, we will treat turnout as 50
percent. Then we have to multiply our previous coalition-size
calculation by ½ to reflect the proportion of the selectorate from which
the coalition is drawn. In that case, if the state assemblies did as
Trump wanted by picking the electors without regard to the popular vote
for president and instead in accordance with the popular vote that chose
the assembly members, then the group of essentials is reduced to 6.25
percent of the electorate—about 20 percent of the vote the loser, Donald
Trump, got, and, of course, even a smaller percentage of the vote that
Joe Biden received. That sure is starting to look undemocratic, and it
reminds us how fragile US conditions might be for choosing the president
while sticking to the strictures of the Constitution. Indeed, that is a
winning coalition size akin to what was required in 1828, when well over
half of the population was disenfranchised! For now at least, state laws
preclude state legislators from ignoring the will of their voters in
determining the allocation of electors. Changing that could be very
tough since the people, already in the elector-selection winning
coalition, would be loath to be removed from it. The state-granted right
to vote for president makes it hard to shrink the winning coalition.</p>
<p>WHOSE VOTE MIGHT COUNT OUTSIDE THE US CONSTITUTION?</p>
<p>So far, we have seen a variety of ways to diminish the winning
coalition so that it is as small as about 6 percent of the electorate.
Looking back at Figure 10.2, we can see why it is really hard for these
methods to succeed in the United States, or anyplace else, once the
winning coalition has been enlarged enough to pass the right-hand gray
line. Hardly anyone is a beneficiary from such midrange reductions in
the size of the essential group. But if we can find ways to get the
coalition down to or past the left-hand vertical line, then we can
imagine that there is a small set of selectors who would endorse such a
move because then their welfare would be substantial even as the rest of
us would be cast into misery. How might the coalition, alarmingly, be
reduced that much?</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States, a country whose current
winning coalition ranks tenth- or eleventh-largest in the world and is
surely above the right-hand gray dividing line, does not require
electors to vote in any particular way. Rather, state governments
constrain electors by generally requiring them to vote in accordance
with the voters’ choice for president. Additionally, state political
parties generally compel their slate of electors—that slate being what
“we the people” actually vote for on Election Day—to pledge to vote for
the candidate they are elected to support. In other words, there are
lots of rules in place that bind electors to vote in accordance with the
preference of their party’s voters. The Supreme Court has ruled that
such commitments are binding, so electors who vote contrary to their
initial pledges will have their votes discounted or maybe even
reversed.</p>
<p>Despite the general commitment of electors, every now and then
electors deviate, voting however they please without regard to the
candidate they were supposed to be bound to. As long as these few rogue
votes do not alter the outcome, it is pretty common for them to be
ignored. Imagine, however, that electors could routinely vote their
personal preference regardless of what the voters in their state
instructed them to do. That would mean that the group of essentials
would be reduced to half of the 538 people who currently are chosen to
be members of the Electoral College, plus one.</p>
<p>If electors could simply vote however they wanted to, then the
winning coalition would not consist of millions of voters but rather
would consist of 270 named individuals—a simple majority of the members
of the Electoral College. Then we would be looking at a government
approximating some petty dictatorship that is awash in corruption and
private goods and suffering from a severe shortage of effective public
policies. While a small group might be induced to back such a
restructuring of institutions, a massively large group of selectors,
whether they had been essentials or not, would balk and would be easily
positioned to overwhelm the few supporting such a shift in coalition
size. Tens of millions of people would face higher taxes; there would be
worse health care for the young, the old, and perhaps for women; their
children’s educational opportunities would diminish; their lives would
be less free, less prosperous, and less fulfilling. Before allowing such
a collapse, these millions would demonstrate and the military probably
would stand by them and the Constitution, which the military is sworn to
obey. Wishful thinking? Maybe, but we believe not, given the logic of
the theory and the extraordinary record of history. A coalition reversal
from massive (remember coalition size in the United States was well
above 0.9 in 2020) to tiny has not happened since at least 1789, as best
as our data can tell.</p>
<p>Donald Trump did not focus heavily on convincing individual electors
to vote his way in 2020. Probably, given how many of them were bound by
state law, by party pledges, and by sincere preferences because they
were doing so well in the large-coalition environment of the United
States, he realized that switching individual electors was a losing
proposition. He did, however, put a lot of energy into trying to get
state legislatures to designate their electors without regard to how the
people voted. We know his effort did not work. We think it did not work
in 2020 in large part because, having already set their state rules for
choosing electors, the legislatures were bound to abide by the rules
they had put in place. Of course, they could change the rules for future
elections much more easily than they could change them after the fact
for an election that had already happened. But because the legislators
have first to get elected, the winning coalition would still be too
large to get down below the left-hand line in Figure 10.2, as we
explained earlier.</p>
<p>Still, there is another mechanism that uncovers the potential
fragility of the American democracy. How does any state government
actually know who won the presidential election in their state? Each
state has a procedure in place for certifying the outcome of the vote.
At the end of the state voting process there is a person, usually the
state’s secretary of state, whose job it is to officially declare the
outcome of the election by following the conclusion of an election
board. Donald Trump, remember, tried to persuade several such people to
certify that he won their state’s election. Famously, he was recorded on
the telephone with Georgia’s secretary of state, asking him to reverse
the electoral outcome.</p>
<p>There are fifty such people, whether their title is secretary of
state, lieutenant governor, or something else. What if enough
secretaries of state chose to ignore the certification of the state’s
bipartisan or nonpartisan board? Then, if enough secretaries of state
agree on a candidate and agree to ignore what “we the people” said, that
candidate would have a majority of electors and so would be elected to
the presidency. That could be a winning coalition at or below the left
vertical line in Figure 10.2, meaning that a tiny group of people—for
instance, the secretaries of state making up the hypothetical new
regime’s winning coalition—could be so well rewarded that if they could
get away with it, they would convert a very-large-coalition, democratic
political system into a very-tiny-coalition, rigged-election
autocracy.</p>
<p>Nothing beyond norms, ethics, and personal honor binds secretaries of
state to certify the election outcome correctly. So, if they put aside
ethics and honor, then just enough certifiers to give a candidate a
majority in the electoral college (at a maximum, twenty-six of them)
could theoretically be the winning coalition in the United States. If
that were how the United States were governed, then it would look a lot
like Kim Jong-Un’s government in North Korea or Xi Jinping’s regime in
China. Fortunately, secretaries of state behaved honorably in 2020, but
that is a thin condition to have to rely on. More reassuringly, so many
currently really-well-off citizens would realize that they were about to
be thrust into misery that the few secretaries of state who might
contemplate such a move would be deterred by the expectation of
rebellion against them, a rebellion that they could not defeat.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. What if the military got behind the coalition of
secretaries of state? Wouldn’t that assure the successful overturning of
a large-coalition democracy like the United States? Was it dumb luck
that the military did not side with Trump in 2020 or early 2021? No, it
was not dumb luck. With the military added to the secretaries of state,
the coalition would have to be appreciably larger in order to secure the
loyalty of enough generals, and then we would be back toward the
midrange area of Figure 10.2. That can work if one starts with a small
coalition and enlarges it by adding generals to move to the upward-slope
part of the figure. But it can’t work when the starting place is a
massively large coalition, as was the case in the United States in 2020.
Then the people in the slightly enlarged coalition that includes up to
twenty-six secretaries of state and a sufficient number of generals
would be worse off than they are under the current large-coalition
system. Such a coalition cannot garner enough support to succeed against
the current political arrangements. They cannot do better than they are
doing in a large-coalition system.</p>
<p>WHY THE US COALITION REMAINS HUGE AND MATURE DEMOCRACY IS NOT
FRAGILE</p>
<p>Although we can imagine scenarios in which the US presidential
coalition is as small as 6.25 percent of the electorate, or as small as
270 electors, or as small as twenty-six state secretaries of state, in
reality the essential group in the United States remains in the many
tens of millions of people. Why is that? The answer, as we have
intimated, resides in the extraordinarily difficult political passage
from a government with a coalition larger than the right-hand gray line
in Figure 10.2 to one past the left-hand vertical line. Nothing
in-between those two points is an attractive shift in governance for
people who start out with a sufficiently large coalition!</p>
<p>What selectorate logic tells us is often couched in different terms
in everyday discussion. One common explanation for the robustness of the
US democracy is that most people in the United States, including most
politicians, feel bound to a set of norms that assure that they abide by
the will of the people. Certainly, we must say that Georgia’s secretary
of state in 2020, Brad Raffensperger, seems to have felt bound by norms
of good conduct when he, a pro-Trump Republican, certified the state’s
vote in favor of Joe Biden even though that was not the outcome he
wished for. And he did so despite direct requests from then president
Trump to recount the votes yet again (they had already been counted
three times) or recheck the ballot signatures to find for him one more
vote than Biden received, meaning an extra 11,780 votes.</p>
<p>The belief that but for such honorable, norms-bound people, the
voters’ will could have been overturned is frightening for the survival
of democracy and, hence, deeply unsatisfying. That explanation calls on
us to probe what we mean by norms and how they might shape outcomes,
remembering that the logic of our argument is that people do what they
believe is best for them.</p>
<p>We have a straightforward, though atypical, understanding of what
makes something a “norm.” Everything we have argued depends on the
tenets of game theory and especially on its understanding of what makes
for stable, equilibrium, behavior. In game theory–speak—and all of
selectorate thinking depends on the logic behind game theory—an
equilibrium outcome, a stable result, arises when no one in the game
believes they would be better off by choosing a different course of
action on their own, without anyone else switching strategies too. Now
that may seem like a very demanding standard, but if you think about it
for a moment, you will realize that this description of action
characterizes what just about every one of us does all the time. Sure,
sometimes we may have to choose when we are not confident what the
consequences of our action will be, but still we do what we
believe—maybe incorrectly—will be best for us under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple norm. In the United States, everyone drives on
the right side of the road. In Britain, everyone drives on the left—or,
as Alastair puts it, the “correct” side of the road. Yet even Alastair
drives on the right side in the United States. Why? Because he fears
that he will get into a crash if he drives on the left (correct) side.
The driving norm assures a stable, safe passage almost all of the time:
safe in England on the left and safe in the United States on the right.
A norm is stable equilibrium behavior exactly because it is what
everyone believes is best under the circumstances. Then, in the same
spirit, when the circumstance has produced a large coalition—when
everyone is driving on the same side of the road—enforcing democratic
norms is stable and secure. Trying to make a really large coalition into
a small one is like driving on the left when everyone else is on the
right. Just because one person switches to the other side of the road
doesn’t change where everybody else drives, and it probably will result
in disaster for anyone foolish enough to break the norm.</p>
<p>If a society has a very small coalition, its leaders and its
essentials are content while everybody else is miserable. Because the
coalition is content, its members will do what is required to keep the
leader in power and to keep the people down. The people, realizing that
there is little they can do to make themselves better off, will, in
fact, do little. They won’t rebel; they won’t work hard “on the books,”
and society will languish. Should something then happen to the incumbent
leader—old age strikes down all of us if we live long enough to become
old—then an opportunity may arise for the people to rise up, improving
their welfare by increasing the coalition size.</p>
<p>If the coalition increases just enough to fall somewhere between
really big and really small, then what happens to the society depends on
whether coalition members seek to expand the coalition, thereby
potentially improving their welfare, or shrink the coalition, thereby
also potentially improving their welfare. The first move puts them in
cahoots with the people, while the second aligns their interests with
the interests of the leader. Either is a feasible adjustment, and the
choice is dictated by the prospect of the leader delivering more or
fewer benefits to them in the future. That’s why we are unsure whether
Duterte in the Philippines will become a long-serving autocrat or not.
The Philippines’ coalition resides in circumstances where the interests
of leaders and essentials might align or essentials and the people might
align. Places like the United States and Brazil are past the point where
the people can be left out of the calculation.</p>
<p>Finally, and of most interest, if the coalition starts out
sufficiently large, then even a small wiggle downward in the size of the
essential group will alert the people and those who have been, or expect
to be, purged from the coalition to strike back and oust the incumbent.
That is what happened to Indira Gandhi; that is what happened to Donald
Trump; and that is, we believe, what will happen to any ruler over a
large-coalition democracy if they gamble on shrinking the coalition
(driving on the wrong side of the road). Logic tells us they will fail.
History tells us that those who have made such a risky attempt in the
past have failed. We reiterate: there are no examples of truly
large-coalition governments—where the coalition was at least a 0.9 on
our scale—that then turned into small-coalition governments—say, below
0.6 on our scale—other than through external military conquest (for
example, by Nazi Germany). There is no reason to expect democracy’s
future to look different. Democracy prevails and democratic would-be
dictators do not. And so, when it comes to the survival of mature
democracies, we are inveterate optimists!</p>
