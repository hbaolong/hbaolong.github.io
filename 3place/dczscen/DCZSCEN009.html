<h4 id="chapter-seven-foreign-aid">CHAPTER SEVEN FOREIGN AID</h4>
<p>A democrat’s lot is not a happy one. She must continually try to find
better policy solutions to reward her large number of supporters. And
yet her hands are tied. She has little discretion in her policy choices.
Her pet projects must be subjugated to the wishes of her large body of
supporters, and she can steal virtually nothing for herself. She is like
a selfless angel, appearing to place the concerns of her people over her
own interests—that is, until she turns her attention overseas.</p>
<p>When it comes to foreign policy, a democrat is prone to behave more
like a devil than an angel. In fact, in targeting her policies at
foreign governments she is likely to be little better than the
tyrannical leaders who rule those foreign regimes.</p>
<p>In this chapter we explore five questions about foreign aid: Who
gives aid to whom? How much do they give? Why do they give it? What are
the political and economic consequences of aid? And what do the answers
to these questions teach us about nation building?</p>
<p>For any who were starting to think of democrats as the good guys,
this will serve as a wake-up call. Most of us would like to believe that
foreign aid is about helping impoverished people. The United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), the primary organization
for allocating US aid, advertises itself as “extending a helping hand to
those people overseas struggling to make a better life, recover from a
disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country. It is
this caring that stands as a hallmark of the United States around the
world.”1 Making the world a better place is a laudable goal for donors.
Yet the people in recipient nations often develop a hatred for the
donor. And recipient governments (and donors too) often have different
views about what the money should be for. As we will see, democrats are
constrained by their big coalition to do the right thing at home.
However, these very domestic constraints can lead them to exploit the
peoples of other nations almost without mercy.</p>
<p>THE POLITICAL LOGIC OF AID</p>
<p>Heart-wrenching images of starving children are a surefire way to
stimulate aid donations. Since the technology to store grain has been
known since the time of the pharaohs, we cannot help but wonder why the
children of North Africa remain vulnerable to famine. A possible
explanation lies in the observations of Polish writer Ryszard
Kapuscinski. Writing about the court of the Ethiopian emperor Haile
Selassie, Kapuscinski described its response to efforts by aid agencies
to assist millions of Ethiopians affected by drought and famine in 1972
by seeking bribes for the regime’s insiders:</p>
<p>Suddenly reports came in that those overseas benefactors who had
taken upon themselves the trouble of feeding our ever-insatiable people
had rebelled and were suspending shipments because our Finance Minister,
Mr. Yelma Deresa, wanting to enrich the Imperial treasury, had ordered
the benefactors to pay high customs fees on the aid. “You want to help?”
the minister asked. “Please do, but you must pay.” And they said, “What
do you mean, pay? We give help! And we’re supposed to pay?” “Yes,” says
the minister, “those are the regulations. Do you want to help in such a
way that our Empire gains nothing by it?”2</p>
<p>The antics of the Ethiopian government should perhaps come as little
surprise. Autocrats need money to pay their coalition. Haile Selassie,
although temporarily displaced by Italy’s invasion in the 1930s, held
the throne from 1930 until he was overcome by decrepitude in 1974. As a
long-term, successful autocrat, Selassie knew not to put the needs of
the people above the wants of his essential supporters. To continue with
Kapuscinski’s description:</p>
<p>First of all, death from hunger had existed in our Empire for
hundreds of years, an everyday, natural thing, and it never occurred to
anyone to make any noise about it. Drought would come and the earth
would dry up, the cattle would drop dead, the peasants would starve.
Ordinary, in accordance with the laws of nature and the eternal order of
things. Since this was eternal and normal, none of the dignitaries would
dare to bother His Most Exalted Highness with the news that in such and
such a province a given person had died of hunger.… So how were we to
know that there was unusual hunger up north?3</p>
<p>Selassie fed his supporters first and himself second; the starving
masses had to wait their turn, which might never come. His callous
disregard for the suffering of the people is chilling, at least until
you compare it to his successor. Mengistu Haile Mariam led the Derg
military regime that followed Selassie’s reign. He carried out policies
that exacerbated drought in the northern provinces of Tigray and Wollo
in the mid-1980s.4 With civil war raging in these provinces and a
two-year drought, he engaged in forced collectivization. Millions were
forced into collective farms and hundreds of thousands were forced out
of the province entirely. Mass starvation resulted. Estimates of the
death toll are between three hundred thousand and one million people.
From the Derg’s perspective the famine seriously weakened the rebels, a
good thing as Mengistu saw it. Some may still remember Live Aid, a
series of records and concerts organized by Bob Geldof to raise disaster
relief money for Ethiopia in 1985. Unfortunately, as well intentioned as
these efforts were, much of the aid fell under the influence of the
Ethiopian government.5 For instance, trucks meant for delivering aid
were requisitioned to forcibly move people into collective farms all
around the country. Perhaps a hundred thousand people died in these
relocations.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of similar instances, where aid is
misappropriated and misdirected by the recipient governments. To take
just one prominent example, the United States gave Pakistan .6 billion
in military aid to combat the Taliban between 2001 and 2008. Only 00
million is estimated to have ever reached the army.6 Nevertheless, aid
continued to flow into Pakistani coffers. Given the stated goals of aid
agencies, one would expect that once it becomes clear money is being
stolen, they would stop giving. Alas, they do not.</p>
<p>Indeed, to dispel any pretense that donors are having the wool pulled
over their eyes, it is worthwhile to consider the Kenyan case. In her
book It’s Our Turn to Eat, Michela Wrong described the exploits of an
idealistic bureaucrat, John Githongo. He was appointed anticorruption
czar by the Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki.7 Given the notorious
corruption of his predecessor, Daniel arap Moi, Kibaki ran on an
anticorruption ticket. International aid agencies began once again to
lend to Kenya at attractive rates. When the IMF gave Kenya a 52.8
million loan, the Economist reported that the finance minister was
overheard whistling “Pennies from Heaven.”8</p>
<p>Githongo quickly discovered that the government thought his agency’s
function was more to cover up corruption than to root it out. When he
realized the corruption went all the way to the president, he made
secret recordings and then fled to Britain and provided international
organizations and banks with documentary evidence of the corruption. He
was not alone in his claims. The British ambassador to Kenya, Edward
Clay, in beautifully florid language, described the corruption as
ministers eating “like gluttons” and “vomiting on the shoes” of
donors.9</p>
<p>Although some years later the IMF and World Bank eventually stopped
lending to Kenya, this was not the immediate reaction to proof of the
corruption. Indeed, the international financial community shunned
Githongo rather than the wrongdoers. His information was ignored, and he
became a pariah at development meetings. Banks and bureaucrats acted
like people so desperate to eat at a restaurant that they ignored the
health department’s warning that the kitchen was overrun by rats.
Githongo is now a prominent activist promoter of good government and
recipient of numerous prestigious awards for his courage and his
actions. But in the immediate aftermath of his revelations it was all he
could do to make a meager living as a lecturer and consultant. Edward
Clay became persona non grata in Kenya and was discreetly retired by the
British government. Both Githongo and Clay effectively ended their
careers in Kenya’s government by “doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that aid agencies remain so naive as to not
understand how misused their funds are. Perhaps the truth lies in
another aim of the USAID—“furthering America’s foreign policy
interests.”10 Perhaps the United States is more interested in having a
reliable ally in its fight against global terrorism and in whatever is
the political struggle of the day; remember that governments once
perceived a strong need for assistance in combating Somali pirates in
the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Against this harsh view, that aid is about recipients selling favors
overseas, is the rhetoric of Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, who
at his Independence Day speech in 1963 said:</p>
<p>We shall never agree to friendship through any form of bribery. And I
want all those nations who are present today—whether from West or from
East—to understand our aim. We want to befriend all, and we want aid
from everyone. But we do not want assistance from any person or country
who will say: Kenyatta, if you want aid, you must agree to this or that.
I believe, my brothers, and I tell you now, that it is better to be poor
and remain free, than be technically free but still kept on a string. A
horse cannot choose: reins can be put on him so he can be led around as
his owner desires. We will not be prepared to accept any aid that will
tie us like a horse by its reins.11</p>
<p>As upright as this speech may initially sound, Kenyatta was in fact
being disingenuous. Are aid agencies willingly throwing away money? Or
are they getting something in return? We suspect that the key statement
in Kenyatta’s speech was “whether from West or from East.” In spite of
his idealistic words, he was covertly telegraphing that his government
remained open to bids from both sides.</p>
<p>Political logic suggests that democratic donors are ready to turn a
blind eye to theft and corruption when they need a favor. If you
remember, Sergeant Doe of Liberia received over 00 million from the
United States during his decade in power. And the United States got a
lot in return: As claimed by a senior American foreign-policy maker, “We
[the United States] were getting fabulous support from him on
international issues. He never wavered [in] his support for us against
Libya and Iran. He was somebody we had to live with. We didn’t feel that
he was such a monster that we couldn’t deal with him. All our interests
were impeccably protected by Doe.”12</p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, the United States had much less need
for Doe’s support. Only then did it find its moral scruples. In 1989 it
published a report, which we quoted earlier but is nonetheless worth
repeating:</p>
<p>[Liberia] was managed with far greater priority given to short-term
political survival and deal-making than to any long-term recovery or
nation-building efforts.… The President’s primary concern is for
political and physical survival. His priorities are very different from
and inconsistent with economic recovery.… President Doe has great
allegiance to his tribes people and inner circle. His support of local
groups on ill designed projects undercut larger social objectives.13</p>
<p>The truth is, foreign-aid deals have a logic of their own. Aid is
decidedly not given primarily to alleviate poverty or misery; it is
given to make the constituents in donor states better off. Aid’s failure
to eliminate poverty has not been a result of donors giving too little
money to help the world’s poor. Rather, the right amount of aid is given
to achieve its purpose: improving the welfare of the donor’s
constituents so that they want to reelect their incumbent leadership.
Likewise, aid is not given to the wrong people—that is, to governments
that steal it rather than to local entrepreneurs or charities that will
use it wisely. Yes, it is true that a lot of aid is given to corrupt
governments, but that is by design, not by accident or out of ignorance.
Rather, aid is given to thieving governments exactly because they will
sell out their people for their own political security. Donors give them
that security in exchange for policies that make donors more secure,
too, by improving the welfare of their own constituents.</p>
<p>The fact is, aid does a little bit of good in the world and vastly
more harm. Unless and until it is restructured, aid will continue to be
a force for evil with negative consequences. Moreover, it will continue
to be promoted by well-meaning citizens who, while making themselves
feel good, are oblivious of the harm they are inflicting on many poor
people who deserve a better lot in life.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear, democrats act as if they care about the welfare of
their people because they need their support. They are not helping out
of the goodness of their hearts, and their concern extends only as far
as their own people—the ones from whom they need a lot of supporters.
Democrats cannot greatly enrich their essential backers by handing out
cash. There are simply too many people who need rewarding. Democrats
need to deliver the public policies their coalition wants.</p>
<p>Autocrats, on the other hand, can richly reward their limited number
of essential backers by disbursing cash. Money, which good governance
suggests should be spent on public goods for the masses, can instead
more usefully (from the autocrat’s perspective) be handed out as rewards
to supporters. And since private goods generate such concentrated
benefits to the people who matter (and a good leader never forgets that
who matters is all that matters), autocrats forsake the public policy
goals of the people. It is not that they necessarily care less about the
people’s welfare than do democrats; it is just that promoting the
people’s interest jeopardizes their hold on power. Remember the story of
Julius Caesar!</p>
<p>Herein lies the basis for making foreign-aid deals. Each side has
something to give that the other side holds dear. A democrat wants
policies his people like, and the autocrat wants cash to pay off his
coalition.</p>
<p>Suppose there are two nations, A and B, each with a population of one
hundred people. The leader in each nation has 00 with which to buy
political support. Suppose nation A is a democracy and its leader needs
to keep fifty people happy in order to stay in power. In contrast,
nation B is an autocracy and its leader needs to keep five people happy.
Suppose the people of both nations care about some policy initiative
taken up by nation B—for instance, to take a common Cold War situation,
the policy might be nation B’s stance towards the Soviet Union. The
citizens in nation A prefer that nation B adopt an anti-Soviet stance.
Suppose the value of such a stance to each of the people in nation A is
equivalent to . The citizens of nation B don’t want socialism outlawed,
and they don’t want their government to take an anti-Soviet stance.
Indeed, since it is their country’s policy at stake, let’s assume that
the people of nation B care about their government’s policy much more
than the people in nation A do. To keep our example simple, suppose that
if B takes the anti-Soviet policy, then this is equivalent to a loss in
welfare for each of the hundred people in B.</p>
<p>In nation A, the leader has 00 to make fifty people happy. If he
hands out the money to his supporters, then each gets . The leader in
nation B has fewer people to satisfy. If he hands out all his money,
then each of his five supporters gets 0. Now, suppose the leader in B
agrees to change to the anti-Soviet policy in exchange for cash. The
essential questions are, How much does B need, and how much is A willing
to pay to make this deal work?</p>
<p>The leader of B would only agree to trade policy for aid if it made
his coalition better off. The switch in policy is equivalent to a loss
for each of his supporters (and each of the inconsequential remaining
ninety-five people in B who are not influential), because they don’t
like the policy. So the leader of B would never agree to the anti-Soviet
stance unless the “aid” money he gets for doing so is larger than this
loss. Since he has five supporters to keep happy and each supporter
suffers a loss, he needs at least 0 in aid to offset the political cost
of turning anti-Soviet. That is, an extra for each of his five essential
backers is the minimum required to change B’s policy to anti-Soviet.</p>
<p>The leader in nation A only “buys” the anti-Soviet policy if its
value to his supporters is greater than the amount given up by each.
Since the fifty coalition members in A value the anti-Soviet policy at
each, the money they give up so that their government can buy an
anti-Soviet stance from country B must be less than each. Otherwise,
they prefer the cash to the policy concession. Since the policy shift is
worth to each supporter in nation A and there are fifty members of the
coalition, this means the leader in A would pay up to 0 in “aid” to B’s
government to get B to become anti-Soviet.</p>
<p>Provided the aid transfer is between 0 and 0, the essential backers
in both nations are made better off by trading policy for aid. This
enhances the survival of both leaders. However, it makes each of the
remaining ninety-five people in nation B—those not in the winning
coalition—the equivalent of worse off. They are not compensated for the
anti-Soviet policy that they don’t like.</p>
<p>This example, while extremely simple, captures the logic of Cold War
aid flows. The United States provided Liberia’s Sergeant Doe with an
average of 0 million per year in exchange for his anti-Soviet stance.
This aid did not provide for the welfare of his people and is
coincidentally close to the amount of money Doe and his cronies are
alleged to have stolen during his decade in power. From the perspective
of survival-oriented leaders, the rationale for aid becomes clear. When
the Cold War ended, the United States no longer valued anti-Soviet
policies and was no longer willing to pay for them. Doe’s government
didn’t have much else to offer the United States that American voters
valued, so he was cut off. Without aid revenue, Doe could no longer pay
his supporters enough for them to suppress insurgencies, and so he died
a gruesome death at the hands of Prince Johnson.</p>
<p>For the reader who finds the above example too contrived, it is
perhaps worthwhile to look at an actual failed United States attempt to
buy policy. In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the United
States sought permission to base US troops in the predominantly Muslim
nation of Turkey. Such basing rights would have improved the US Army’s
ability to engage the Iraqi army. Although Turkey is allied with the
United States through NATO, the idea of assisting a predominately
Christian nation to invade a fellow Muslim nation was domestically
unpopular in Turkey. During negotiations in February 2003, the United
States offered Turkey billion in grants and up to 0 billion in loan
guarantees. Given Turkey’s population of approximately seventy million,
these aid totals amounted to about 70 per capita.14</p>
<p>Turkey was pretty democratic at the time. For a quick,
back-of-the-envelope calculation, let’s suppose its leader needed the
support of a quarter of the people. So the value of the United States’
offer worked out to nearly ,500 per essential backer. This was a
substantial amount (almost 33 percent of Turkish per capita income in
2003), but then the policy concession sought was very politically risky.
Indeed, it might be useful for American readers to think about how much
compensation they would need before agreeing to allow foreign troops a
base in the United States in order to invade Canada.</p>
<p>It appears that ,500 per person was not enough. After much
back-and-forth, the Turkish government rejected the offer. They were
holding out for significantly more money, so we know there was a price
at which the policy concession could have been granted, but it was a
high price. The United States was not willing to pay more, and so the
deal could not be struck. In the end, Turkey granted a much less
controversial concession for a lot less money. The United States was
allowed to rescue downed pilots using bases in Turkey.</p>
<p>Buying a policy from a democracy is expensive because many people
need to be compensated for their dislike of the policy. Buying a policy
from an autocracy is quite a bit easier. Suppose Turkey were an
autocracy back in 2003 and its leaders were beholden to only 1 percent
of the population. Under such a scenario, the value of the US offer
rejected by Turkey would have approached 0,000 per essential backer.
Thinking back to the challenge offered to American readers, while few
might sell out their northern neighbor for ,500, 0,000 might start
looking very attractive to many. It is probably not an accident that the
US invasion of Iraq was launched from the decidedly very-small-coalition
monarchies of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The logic of how coalitions operate gives us a good handle on who
gives how much aid to whom. Getting the people what they want helps
democratic leaders stay in office. It is therefore no surprise that most
foreign aid originates in democracies. The price of a policy concession
depends on the salience of the issue (as we’ll address in a moment) and
the size of the recipient leader’s coalition. As coalition size grows,
the recipient leader needs to compensate more and more people for the
adoption of the policy advocated by the donor. That means that the price
of a policy concession rises with the size of the prospective
recipient’s group of essential backers. This creates an interesting
dynamic.</p>
<p>As a nation becomes more democratic, the amount of aid required to
buy its policy goes up. But because the price is higher, donors are less
likely to buy the policy concession from it; it just gets to be too
expensive. Poor autocracies are most likely to get aid, but they don’t
get much. Although they may have great needs, they can be bought
cheaply. We have confirmed this relationship between coalition size, the
chance to get aid, and the amount of aid received (if any) in detailed
statistical studies of aid giving by the United States and other wealthy
democratic nations, namely all the members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD).15</p>
<p>Coalition size is not the only factor determining who gets aid or how
much is spent to buy concessions from them. The salience of the issues
at stake—what the policy concessions are worth—is an important
determinant of how much aid gets transferred. Notice that in the formula
we just described, need is not a significant factor. In fact, because an
extra dollar is worth more to a poor country than to a rich one, among
those receiving aid, needier countries are likely to get less aid, not
more, than the less needy.</p>
<p>One extremely salient, and hence expensive, aid-for-policy deal was
the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. As part of this agreement, Egypt
became the first Arab nation to officially recognize Israel. Israel and
Egypt ended hostilities that had been nominally ongoing since the 1948
war (and that had erupted into actual warfare in 1956, 1967, and 1973).
As part of the 1979 deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula,
which it had captured in the 1967 Six-Day War, and both sides agreed to
the free passage of shipping through the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Peace between Israel and Egypt was of great importance to the United
States. Beyond the strong domestic support for Israel, the United States
was suffering the ill effects of oil shocks in the 1970s. The sharp rise
in oil prices raised inflation and harmed the US and other Western
economies dependent on oil imports. The United States, desperate to
avoid another oil crisis, underwrote the 1979 deal, thinking, perhaps,
that doing so would help stabilize the oil situation in the region. As
can be seen in Figure 7.1, the United States provided enormous economic
incentives for Egyptian president Anwar Sadat to visit Israel, attend
the Camp David peace summit, and sign the treaty.</p>
<p>Figure 7.1: Total US Assistance to Egypt in Constant 2019 Billions
US$ from USAID</p>
<p>The recognition of Israel was an extremely unpopular policy shift in
Egypt. This is why Sadat was able to extract so much from the United
States. Unfortunately for Sadat, it also contributed to his
assassination in 1981. Fundamentalists threw grenades and attacked with
automatic rifle fire during an annual parade. Although it officially
recognizes Israel, the Egyptian government has done almost nothing to
encourage the Egyptian people to moderate their hatred for Israel. In a
BBC survey conducted nearly thirty years after the Camp David agreement
was struck, 78 percent of Egyptians indicated that they perceived Israel
as having a negative impact in the world, far above the average in other
countries in the survey.16 Of course, changing the negative attitude
toward Israel in Egypt would just reduce the amount of aid the Egyptian
government can extract from the United States.</p>
<p>The brief movement toward a more democratic government in Egypt
during the Arab Spring highlights the dilemma faced by democratic
donors. Those who celebrated the prospects of democracy in Egypt and
favored peace with Israel had a problem. As we have noted, the
aid-for-peace-with-Israel deal was possible exactly because the
autocratic Egyptian leadership and its coalition were compensated for
the anti-Israeli sentiment among its citizenry, a sentiment they helped
preserve. With the people in charge, it would have been natural for
Egypt to shift away from peace with Israel. To prevent that, greater
amounts of foreign aid were needed in a democratic Egypt than under the
Sadat and Mubarak dictatorships. As we see in Figure 7.1, there was not
a substantial post–Arab Spring increase in aid when Mohamed Morsi—leader
of the Muslim Brotherhood—was elected Egypt’s leader. Americans tout the
promotion of democracy around the world, but when push comes to shove,
aid more often follows the trail of security or commercial concessions
rather than being an instrument of political reform. Sadly, this
statement is true not only of US foreign assistance but of nearly all
OECD aid.</p>
<p>Depressing as all of this is, there is evidence that for a small set
of countries that cannot offer meaningful commercial or security
concessions, sometimes democratic donors are nevertheless willing to
give aid in return for political liberalization. All democratic
countries cheer others on to be democratic, and so it is sensible and
reasonable that sometimes they are prepared to use aid to buy the
concession of political liberalization. But political reform is hard to
attain with aid even when donors are willing to use it that way (and
such willingness is uncommon). The difficulty is that prospective aid
recipients are much more open to selling out their people for money than
they are to helping their people in ways that increase the risk that the
leaders will be toppled. That, of course, is the great danger of taking
aid for political reform: reform usually implies and requires expanding
the winning coalition. Still, the evidence shows us that
sometimes—perhaps “rarely” is a better description—the stars align and
aid for political liberalization is given to recipients who offer little
by way of security or commercial benefits to donors.17</p>
<p>Alas, democracy promotion is a marginal activity when it comes to
foreign aid. Consider aid to Pakistan. As with aid to Egypt, US
assistance to Pakistan is much easier to explain by looking at it as a
payment for favors rather than a tool for alleviating poverty or
promoting political reform. In 2001, the United States gave Pakistan .3
million and Nepal 0.4 million in aid. Pakistan’s aid had been greatly
reduced by congressional mandate following their test of a nuclear
weapon in 1998. Yet on September 22, 2001, US president George W. Bush
lifted restrictions on aid to Pakistan. It received more than 00 million
in 2002. Meanwhile, Nepal, not on the front line of the fight against
al-Qaeda and the Taliban, received about 7 million, just modestly more
than its 2001 receipts. India, also not front and center in the battle
against terrorism in 2002, received 66 million from the United States,
barely up from 2001, when they received about 63 million. Poverty had
not changed in any meaningful way in any of these countries between 2001
and 2002, but their importance to American voters most assuredly
had.</p>
<p>Democrats are often perceived as being in the driver’s seat and
dictating terms to autocrats. However, as in other matters, they are
often the ones who are constrained. They need to deliver the policies
their backers want. If they try to cut back on the aid they give or
impose strict conditions on it, then autocrats simply end the policy
concessions.</p>
<p>Subsequent US relations with Pakistan offer clear evidence of this
pattern of waning and waxing aid. As we saw, aid went up following the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but then it began to taper as
the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan seemed to have been won by
2003. Once Pakistan increasingly became a safe haven for the Taliban and
al-Qaeda, everything changed. Pakistan now found itself in a tough spot.
If the government opposed the Taliban, which was infiltrating the
Pakistani frontier bordering Afghanistan, they were likely to face a
domestic insurgency. If they supported the Taliban, they would face
severe pressure from the United States. This dilemma offered an
opportunity for Pakistan to make greater demands for US aid in exchange
for resisting the Taliban. The demands were made, but the US Congress
balked at giving Pakistan more, noting that much American aid to
Pakistan was diverted to uses not intended by Congress. Some money
disappeared entirely, and Pakistan channeled much of the rest to stave
off India, which the Pakistanis perceived to be a greater threat than
Muslim fundamentalist militants.</p>
<p>The United States, disgruntled with Pakistan, did not initially agree
to pay the higher price needed to get the Pakistani government to pursue
the Taliban and al-Qaeda militants within Pakistan. What was the upshot?
As we have learned to expect, the Pakistani leadership ignored US
pressure and began looking for ways to work with the Taliban. Aid is
basically a pay-to-play program. The United States wouldn’t pay, so
Pakistan wouldn’t play.</p>
<p>By 2008, the government of Pakistan’s leader, Asif Ali Zardari, was
paying only lip service to going after the militants. The Bush
administration, lacking more aid to offer, proved unable to change
Zardari’s mind. In fact, the second half of 2008 saw only a perfunctory
effort by the Zardari government to fight the militants. There was a
brief military offensive against the Taliban, starting on June 28 and
ending in early July, with precisely one militant killed. After that,
although the Taliban aggressively pursued their own territorial
expansion in Pakistan, the Zardari government mostly looked the other
way. Rather than fight the militants, Zardari’s regime made a deal with
the Taliban in February 2009, paying them about million and agreeing to
the imposition of Sharia law in the Swat Valley in exchange for the
Taliban’s agreeing to an indefinite cease-fire. The cease-fire had
unraveled by May. By this time, the Zardari government seemed in
trouble, and the US government was fearful that the Taliban might take
control of Pakistan altogether. In the face of such danger, the price
for aid had risen, but so too had the desire in the United States to
motivate the Pakistanis to try harder to beat back the Taliban.</p>
<p>Congress passed the Kerry-Lugar bill at the end of September 2009. It
nearly tripled aid to Pakistan, increasing it to .5 billion. Even then
the Pakistani government balked at taking the greatly increased aid
because the bill included requirements that the Pakistanis be
accountable for how the money was used. Facing resistance from Pakistan,
Senator John Kerry clarified that the bill was not designed to interfere
at all with sovereign Pakistani decisions; that is, he essentially
assured the Pakistani leadership that the United States would not
closely monitor use of the funds. Shortly after, the Pakistani
government accepted the aid money and greatly stepped up its pursuit of
militants operating within its borders. By February 2010 they had
captured the number two Taliban leader, but, as we should expect, they
were also careful not to wipe out the Taliban threat. Doing so would
have just led to a termination of US funds.</p>
<p>The US government, for its part, was frustrated that even with .5
billion in aid, Pakistan was not sufficiently motivated to beat back the
Taliban. As a result, the United States stepped up drone attacks and the
use of the American military to pursue the Taliban within Pakistani
territory, much to the public—but we doubt private—dismay of the Zardari
government. This was all just the dance of the donors and the takers,
the recipients looking for as much money as possible and the donors
looking for a highly salient, costly political concession: the
destruction of the Taliban.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is distasteful to those who would like to maintain the
fiction that aid is about alleviating poverty or promoting democracy.
Naturally some aid is given with purely humanitarian motives, such as
that given after a natural disaster. Yet it is hard to reconcile the
large scale of aid that flows to Egypt and Pakistan with idealistic
goals. If aid actually helped the poor or the oppressed, then we might
expect the people in recipient nations to be grateful and hold donor
nations in esteem. Nothing could be further from the truth. In return
for its “benevolence” to Egypt and Pakistan, the United States is widely
reviled by the people in those two countries, and with good reason.</p>
<p>In 2010, Pew Research Center undertook a study of values and opinion
in a great many other nations. One question asked about people’s view of
the United States. So how did Pakistanis and Egyptians feel about the
United States? “Pakistan, along with Turkey and Egypt, gives America its
lowest rating.”18 This was nothing new. Back in 2002 Pew’s comparable
study reported that in Pakistan 69 percent of people had an extremely
unfavorable view of the United States. In Egypt a mere 6 percent had a
favorable view of the United States.19 In the other forty nations in
that study, an average of only 11 percent of the people shared this
extremely negative view of the United States. But then, Pakistan and
Egypt received an average of .6 billion in economic and military aid
from the United States in 2002, while the other forty nations averaged
only 7 million in aid. The pattern is borne out in detailed statistical
analyses and in survey after survey. People in nations receiving lots of
US aid seem to hate the United States.</p>
<p>Our account of aid may seem to paint the United States as
international bad guy number one. But the United States is far from the
only aid donor. While the United States is the largest overall donor, as
a proportion of its economic size it gives relatively little, about 0.2
percent of GDP. Scandinavian nations give over 1 percent of their
economic output in foreign aid. Provided the policy rewards that a
foreign power can provide to a democrat’s supporters are worth more to
the supporters than the rewards that could be directly purchased with
the money, democrats support aid. Other nations and agencies buy favors,
too, if not perhaps on the same grand scale that the United States can
afford. In fact, careful analysis shows that even the seemingly generous
Scandinavians give aid in exchange for policy concessions rather than
for altruistic reasons. They particularly like to use aid to gain trade
concessions and prosocialist ideologies in recipient regimes.20</p>
<p>Aid agreements are notorious for being tied to conditions that help
the donor. This means that the agreement often specifies how and, more
importantly, where the money is spent. For instance, Germany might give
a recipient nation money, but only if it uses it to buy German tractors.
This might seem an inefficient way to reward tractor manufacturers.
However, international trade laws often forbid direct subsidies.
Further, tied aid can bring future business, such as spare parts and
service. Canada is notorious for high levels of tied aid, 60–75 percent
of all its aid. Scandinavia and the UK claim to have the lowest levels
of tied aid, but even there, informal tying is common. For instance,
Denmark had allocated 5 million to repair ferries in Bangladesh. Rather
than repair the ferries locally, Denmark proposed taking the ships to
Denmark and repairing them there, at four times the local cost. Amid
protest from the Bangladeshi government, Denmark decided to simply
cancel the whole scheme, so neither the Bangladeshis nor the Danes
benefited. Ferries fixed in Bangladesh just did not deliver as many
benefits for Danes as Bangladeshi ferries repaired in Denmark by Danish
workers.</p>
<p>Just as the United States buys security and policy concessions with
aid, and the Europeans trade aid for business concessions, so too does
Japan. Whales need to fear Japanese benevolence. American voters like
pork. In contrast, Japanese voters like blubber, and Japanese leaders
work hard to deliver. In 1986, the International Whaling Commission
(IWC) instituted a moratorium on the commercial hunting of whales. While
this ban was popular with the people of most nations, the citizens of
Iceland, Norway, and Japan want to resume hunting. Currently the
Japanese hunt whales through a loophole that allows hunting for
scientific research. These whales, of course, end up being eaten. Even
as demand for whale meat has fallen, Japanese fishermen promote whale
hunting, arguing, as they did in 2019, that “the culture and way of life
will be passed on to the next generation.”21 The Japanese government
buys votes on the IWC with foreign aid. Recently, through Japan’s
efforts, the IWC’s membership has swelled to include nations with no
history of whaling. Some of these recent members, such as Laos, Mali,
and Mongolia, are landlocked. Japan’s efforts have been rewarded with
growing support for the resumption of whale hunting.</p>
<p>THE IMPACT OF AID</p>
<p>Example after example highlight the simple fact that aid is given in
exchange for policy concessions far more readily and in far larger
quantities than it is given to reduce poverty and suffering. Following
World War II, the rich nations seem genuinely to have thought they could
free the world of poverty through their generosity. But no sooner did
aid begin to flow than the demands of political survival intruded on the
noble goal of reducing misery. It should not be surprising that politics
prevailed over benevolence. The record is unambiguous: foreign
assistance has proven ineffective at alleviating poverty and promoting
economic growth.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of World War II, Europe faced many challenges. Even
the victors had suffered enormous human and economic losses. The United
States launched a widespread relief program known as the Marshall Plan.
Adjusted for inflation, the United States pumped over 89 billion in
economic assistance into Europe between 1946 and 1952. Britain was the
largest recipient, followed by West Germany, France, and Italy.22 The
United States’ goal was to build stalwart states allied against
communism. To achieve these ends, the United States needed an
economically strong Europe. States that were willing to combat communism
and follow US-dictated economic plans got aid; those not willing to do
so didn’t.</p>
<p>Over the entire postwar period, total US economic assistance was
nearly .3 trillion. Military aid over the same period was about 50
billion. To give some perspective, together these economic and military
aid packages were roughly the size of the 2021 US stimulus package to
address the COVID-19 pandemic and its dire unemployment and other
disastrous economic consequences.</p>
<p>The success of the Marshall Plan proved hard to replicate. Trillions
of dollars have been pumped into developing economies, yet there is
precious little to show for it if we measure performance by assessing
improvements in the quality of life. As we’ve seen, aid has done
virtually nothing to relieve poverty.</p>
<p>Among policy makers, this record has prompted a fierce debate about
the efficacy of aid. For critics, it is all too easy to point to many
aid-dependent states in Africa that are poorer now than they were at
independence. The development community likes to counter that such a
direct comparison is unfair and that, while aid-dependent nations have
performed poorly, they would have done even worse without aid. This
defense, while wrong, is a sensible argument that needs to be taken
seriously.</p>
<p>We cannot simply condemn the aid enterprise just because nations that
received aid performed so poorly. To understand why, consider the
following provocative statement: Hospitals kill! There is plenty of
evidence to support this claim. The likelihood of dying is much higher
for a person in a hospital than for a person who is not. Of course, most
of us instantly see the error in the evidence. The people in hospitals
are sick. Healthy people are not found in hospital beds. But this kind
of error that occurs from looking at statistics without thinking about
where they come from is all too common.</p>
<p>A colleague of ours, Peter Rosendorff, organized a petition and
appealed to the Santa Monica (California) City Council to put a
crosswalk at a dangerous junction near his former house. The city
engineer said that the city was in fact planning to take out all the
crosswalks because their study showed that pedestrians were more likely
to get killed in crosswalks than anywhere else. The people of Santa
Monica should be grateful to Peter. He took the time to explain that the
result was not because crosswalks are inherently more dangerous but
rather because that’s where people cross the road.</p>
<p>Assessing the true impact of hospitals or of a particular treatment
or drug is difficult unless we understand who is being treated. The
medical community uses randomized drug trials to test the efficacy of
medicines. Patients are randomly split into two groups: half get the
medicine being tested and half get a placebo. The effectiveness of the
drugs is determined by comparing the performance of the two groups. This
is exactly the procedure followed in developing and testing the COVID-19
vaccines. If, alternatively, the medicine is given only to the sickest
patients, then even if it is an effective treatment the group getting
the medicine might do worse than the group that did not. Likewise, if
aid agencies target aid at those nations facing the most serious
problems, then aid could appear ineffective even if it was actually
working.</p>
<p>Ideally, to assess the effectiveness of aid, the international
community should undertake controlled experiments, giving aid to some
randomly chosen nations and withholding it from others. But since it is
unlikely aid will ever be allocated in this way, economists need to use
complex (and controversial) statistical procedures to adjust the results
according to which nations get treated. Rather than delve into these
convoluted procedures, we offer some simple evidence based on the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC).</p>
<p>The UNSC is composed of five permanent members (the United States,
Russia, China, Britain, and France) and ten temporary members. The
temporary members are elected for two-year terms on the Security
Council, and they are ineligible to be reelected in the two years after
their term expires. Election to the UNSC is highly prestigious—and, as
it turns out, valuable too. Unfortunately, its value comes at a cost:
hardship for the people in many of the countries that get elected. On
average, nations elected to the UNSC grow more slowly, become less
democratic, and have more restrictions on press freedoms than eligible
nations that are not elected.23 For instance, during a two-year term on
the UNSC, the economy grows an average of 1.2 percent less for nations
elected to the council than for nations not elected. Over a four-year
period (the two years on the UNSC and the following two years of
ineligibility), the difference in growth averages 3.5 percent less for
elected UNSC members—that is, nearly 1 percent per year. The effects are
much stronger in autocracies than democracies.</p>
<p>The effects of council membership on growth are fascinating and
should cause us to question why the UN is held in such high regard. They
also provide an important piece of evidence about the impact of aid.
Nations elected to the UNSC get more aid. A UNSC seat gives leaders
valuable favors to sell in the form of their vote on the Security
Council, and the aid they receive results in worse performance for their
economy. Recently there have been a profusion of studies that show that
nations elected to the UNSC get financial rewards from the international
community. They get more US and UN aid and better terms and more
programs at the IMF, World Bank, and a host of other institutions.24
Membership on the UNSC gives national leaders a say in formulating
global policy. Many leaders, particularly those from autocratic nations,
appear to prefer to sell this influence rather than exercise it on
behalf of their people’s interests.</p>
<p>UNSC membership comes as close to a randomized test as we are likely
to get. Although who gets elected is not random, it is unrelated to the
need for aid. Indeed, population size appears to be the only systematic
determinant of UNSC elections. African nations, in particular, appear to
have adopted a norm of rotation. Nations are elected simply because it
is their turn. The key point is that prior to their election, UNSC
members behave no differently from other nations. But once elected, they
actually underperform. To return to the medical analogy, nations elected
to the UNSC are not sicker than nations not elected. They get an extra
shot of medicine (aid) and it makes them sicker (poorer, less
democratic, and with more restrictions on the press).</p>
<p>UNSC membership gives leaders the opportunity to sell salient policy
support. As we have seen over and over again, autocrats need to pay off
their coalition. Aid provides the money to do so and that helps leaders
survive. Further, aid encourages autocrats to reduce freedoms for two
reasons. First, aid revenue means leaders are less dependent upon the
willingness of people to work, so the leader does not need to take as
many of the risks that arise from freedom, risks they must take when
their revenue and worker productivity depend on allowing people to
communicate with each other. Second, the policy concessions are
generally unpopular, so leaders need to suppress dissent. UNSC
membership brings prominence and prestige to a nation. For an autocratic
leader, it also means more easy money. For the people of autocratic
nations, UNSC membership means fewer freedoms, less democracy, less
wealth, and more misery.</p>
<p>The historical record shows that aid has largely failed to lift
nations out of poverty. It is perhaps ironic that while aid affords the
resources to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth, it creates
the political incentives to do just the opposite. As Edward Walker, US
ambassador to Egypt (1994–1998), succinctly put it, “Aid offers an easy
way out for Egypt to avoid reform.”25</p>
<p>AN ASSESSMENT OF FOREIGN AID</p>
<p>So what are we to think of foreign aid? Is it good for policy, or
just good politics?</p>
<p>It has certainly had its successes. Foreign aid, in the form of the
Marshall Plan, lifted the predominantly democratic nations of Western
Europe out of economic disaster after World War II. But the deck was
stacked in the plan’s favor. The United States wanted to promote an
economically powerful bloc as a means of combating Soviet expansion. The
plan therefore promoted economic growth. Democrats need policy success
and so were happy to comply with US policy goals in exchange for
substantial aid. Yet as we now know, subsequent aid donations have
failed to replicate the success of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>What aid does well is help dictators cling to power and withhold
freedoms. And yet, the quest to make aid work for the poor is
phoenixlike in its ability to rise and rise again. Or, come to think of
it, maybe, like Sisyphus, we just keep climbing the same hill only to
fall down again.</p>
<p>Every decade or so, donor nations launch new initiatives to “get aid
working.” The most recent manifestation of this is the Millennium
Development Goals. Set up by the United Nations Development Program and
adopted by world leaders in 2000, this program set poverty, health,
gender equality, education, and environmental targets to be reached by
2015. For instance, the poverty eradication goals called for reducing by
half the number of people living on less than a dollar per day.
Commendable as such declarations are, saying you want to make poor
people richer, or at least less poor, and actually doing so are
completely different things. Happily, the world saw a big reduction in
the number of people living on less than a dollar a day. However,
economists overwhelmingly attribute the reduction in the size of this
group to the adoption of freer trade and more market orientations, not
to foreign economic assistance.</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals was not the first to declare a goal of
ending poverty or the last. In 2021 the World Bank reported that “for
almost 25 years, extreme poverty—the first of the world’s Sustainable
Development Goals—was steadily declining. Now, for the first time in a
generation, the quest to end poverty has suffered a setback. Global
extreme poverty rose in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years as the
disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic compounded the forces of conflict
and climate change, which were already slowing poverty reduction
progress.”26 Earlier efforts as well were intended to attain
“self-sustained growth” first, in the 1940s and 1950s through
infrastructure development and then with the US P-4 program to make
scientific and technological breakthroughs readily available to poor
countries, followed in turn by John Kennedy’s declaration that the 1960s
would be the “Decade for Development.” The goals, set back in the late
1940s, remain the same, and scant evidence suggests that the world is
closer to achieving those goals than it was in the 1950s or 1960s.
Economist William Easterly discussed the hope and optimism that
accompany these roughly once-a-decade initiatives. He lamented that
while each new plan says it will be different, it repeats the same
errors of the past. He argued that the bureaucracy involved in giving
aid ensures funds are given in ways that impede rather than promote
economic activity. Poverty persists.27</p>
<p>Still, we don’t need to be completely pessimistic about aid. Our
knowledge of how it works has greatly improved. For instance, we know
that aid works much better in the presence of good governance (just as
we know that more often than not it goes to places with bad
governance).28 Proponents of development assistance point to the success
of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) undertaking directed programs
within nations. Some of these programs have produced wonderful
successes. For instance, in 1986 the Carter Center started a plan to
combat Guinea worm disease, a parasite transmitted via dirty drinking
water that affected about 3.5 million people in seventeen nations across
Asia and Africa. By 2019, worldwide infections had been reduced to just
54, mostly in Africa.</p>
<p>NGOs have proven that they can effectively deliver basic health care
and primary education. Yet, harking back to our discussion of public
goods provided by small-coalition regimes, we can’t help but notice that
these benefits are precisely the kinds of public policy programs that
even the most autocratic leaders want to initiate. NGOs are less
successful at providing advanced education. Autocratic leaders in
recipient states don’t want people to be taught how to think
independently lest they organize opposition to the government.</p>
<p>The successes of NGOs in promoting basic education, basic health care
and sanitation, and other basic necessities—by, for example, digging
wells, electrifying villages, and making very small business loans (at
what we would describe in the United States as usurious interest
rates)—all point to a fundamental failing of aid programs and to the
harm being done unwittingly by many NGOs and their supporters. It is a
simple fact that aid money is fungible. This means recipient governments
have nearly complete discretion in moving funds from one project to
another. With direct government-to-government transfers it is easy to
see why this is so. Autocrats want to provide private rewards for their
supporters. NGOs don’t typically want to help the rich get richer, and
so they provide funding for specific projects or do the work themselves.
However, in practice, recipients are very skilled at converting aid into
the kinds of rewards they want rather than the kinds of rewards donors
want to provide.</p>
<p>The most sensible criterion for assessing aid’s effectiveness asks
not how much money is spent or even how many wells are dug, schools
built, or villages electrified, but rather how many people are helped.
NGOs count how much money they spend to evaluate their efficacy, but
this is a flawed criterion. It encourages charities to help the easiest
to reach and the more visible cases while ignoring the harder-to-reach
people who might well be those in greatest need. Counting the number of
people helped also encourages agencies to undertake work that the
government would have otherwise done on its own. Remember that NGOs are
most successful at providing basic public goods like primary education
and basic health care—services even autocrats want. When aid funds
substitute for government spending, then few people, maybe even no one,
have actually been helped unless the government uses the freed-up money
for other projects of benefit to the general population. Of course, they
don’t. They use the money to shore up their political position and the
loyalty of their essential backers.</p>
<p>Cambodia is a case in point. Half of the Cambodian government’s
budget is made up of foreign aid. Rather than supplementing government
programs, these donor funds are largely directed toward the bank
accounts of government officials. Indeed, Cambodia ranks among the
world’s most corrupt nations. As USAID reported, “Donor funds have
flowed into education and health, and some of these are passed on to
ordinary citizens. But, there can be little doubt a significant portion
of funds earmarked for schools, teachers and textbooks, and for clinics,
health workers, and medications are diverted.”29</p>
<p>In other words, the funds intended for the people are diverted to
rewards for Cambodia’s rich. Often when NGOs provide aid, the amount of
assistance is substantially less than the numbers reflect. Suppose an
NGO provides basic education to one hundred children in a village at a
cost of 00 per child per year, for a total expenditure of 0,000. It
sounds like one hundred people are helped by the NGO, pleasing its
donors and bringing in more money. The reality of how many are helped,
however, is less clear. The government might well have paid to educate
half of those children (or even all of them) itself, even if there were
no expectation of aid. Nominally the agency helps one hundred children.
But in reality they help fifty children at twice the nominal cost and
let the leaders abscond with ,000. Is this good? Well, yes, for the
fifty extra children. Is it bad? Well, yes, for all of the people, since
the NGO is facilitating the government’s opportunity to steal more money
and the NGO is helping to further entrench a bad government in power to
plague the people for many more years to come.</p>
<p>Even some of the simplest acts of charity have bad consequences that
enhance government control and irresponsibility. To take a personal
example, Alastair took his children on a tour of Kenya in 2009. One of
the stops was at a primary school where they were encouraged to help
paint classrooms. It seemed like a nice idea to help out, and many
people enthusiastically grabbed paintbrushes, eager to brighten the
classroom. Alastair objected on principle and went outside and taught
some of the kids how to use a digital camera. Was he being a Grinch or
was he encouraging better economic policy? From the economic
perspective, having highly skilled tourists and their families paint
classrooms is at best ineffective and at worst downright harmful.</p>
<p>Comparative advantage lies at the heart of economics. Everyone should
specialize in what they are relatively good at and then trade their
goods and services. This way everyone ends up with more than if everyone
tried to do a little of everything by themselves. Consider the
comparative advantage of Kenya relative to Britain, where most of the
people on Alastair’s trip were from. Education levels are low in Kenya
and there are lots of unemployed manual laborers. Kenya’s comparative
advantage is therefore in industries requiring lots of relatively
unskilled labor. Indeed, this is where it flourishes: Kenya is a huge
exporter of flowers. It has a great climate for growing and lots of
people to tend to the labor-intensive processes of growing, picking, and
packaging flowers. The flowers are then flown to Western Europe for
sale. In exchange, Europe exports goods that require human and physical
capital to produce—pharmaceuticals, machinery, and computer software.
Europe has a relative abundance of human and physical capital. It trades
its capital-intensive products for Kenya’s labor-intensive agricultural
products, and both nations are better off.</p>
<p>So what has this to do with painting school classrooms? Well, having
tourists paint classrooms, while fun, deprived a local worker of a
much-needed job. If educated Westerners displace locals from manual
labor jobs, then where can those workers possibly work given the current
distribution of skills and capital? How can they earn enough money to
make a living and perhaps send their children to school to acquire
greater skills that will make them more competitive when they grow up?
Rather than helping out, the wealthy tourists who took up paintbrushes
made some worker worse off. Repeat that exercise thousands of times and
in thousands of different ways and you can see how feel-good charitable
acts can benefit the donor vastly more than they actually benefit the
needy.</p>
<p>On a much larger scale, the means of aiding needy countries can be
dramatically improved by taking stock of comparative advantage. For
instance, agriculture is highly protected from competition in Europe and
North America through price supports and subsidies. Agriculture was
deliberately excluded from the postwar trade settlement established by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its controversial
successor, the World Trade Organization. This is because rural areas are
disproportionately represented in some countries and so farmers tend to
be the essential backers of leaders in many European countries. Allowing
farmers from developing nations to compete on the basis of comparative
advantage would go much further toward promoting economic growth than
providing poorly targeted and highly bureaucratized aid. Painting
schools provides just one tiny example of how assistance, even when well
meaning, undermines development. Bill Easterly’s work shows that rather
than this being the exception, it is the norm.</p>
<p>AID SHAKEDOWNS</p>
<p>We started this chapter with an account of Haile Selassie’s shakedown
of donors. By now it should be clear that this practice is all too
common and reflects the logic of privately given aid. When private
donors provide aid, governments must either strike deals with them so
that the government gets its cut—that, after all, is the value of aid to
a small-coalition regime—or, in the absence of such deals, they must
shake down well-intentioned private donors. Either way, the government
must get its piece of the action or it will make it impossible for
donors to deliver assistance. That is what the Myanmar government did
following Cyclone Nargis in 2008. They insisted on having United Nations
aid delivered to the government and threatened to bar it from the
country if it wasn’t. Why? Because, as we noted earlier, the military
dictatorship wanted to use the aid to enrich itself by selling food on
the black market rather than distributing it to those most in need. You
might think this was the odd behavior of a horrible regime, atypical of
the response of government leaders following natural disasters. Not so!
Consider the case of Oxfam relief for Sri Lanka in the wake of the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami.</p>
<p>Following a massive earthquake on December 26, 2004, a tsunami sent
huge waves of water rushing inland, killing more than 230,000 people
across fourteen nations. Subsequent assistance totaled over 4 billion.
Yet even though the goal of aid agencies was to relieve suffering, many
recipient governments took it as an opportunity to enrich
themselves.</p>
<p>To distribute aid, Oxfam shipped twenty-five four-wheel-drive trucks
to the region. The Sri Lankan government impounded the trucks and
insisted that Oxfam pay a 300 percent import duty. For over a month (the
first critical month after the tsunami) the trucks sat idle and people
went without food and shelter. Eventually Oxfam paid over million to
have its trucks released.</p>
<p>Before giving to a charity, many people like to assess how much of
their donation goes to help people versus how much is spent on overhead.
Oxfam America, for instance, gets three out of four stars from Charity
Navigator, an organization that rates charities. Oxfam spends 6 percent
of its revenue on administrative expenses and 14 percent on fundraising.
The remaining 80 percent is spent on programs—that is, on helping
people. Unfortunately, eighty cents on the dollar is not the effective
amount of help provided. Remember those trucks and the 300 percent
import duty: if such cases are the norm (and they usually are), the
actual aid benefit may only equate to twenty cents on the dollar. If
even as careful a charity as Oxfam is being shaken down, then we wonder
what is happening to the rest.</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to quantify how much aid gets diverted
toward the recipient government’s objectives rather than working toward
the donor’s intended goals. However, we suspect this figure is huge. The
fundamental problem is that recipient governments are not appropriately
incentivized to fix problems. Consider the case of flooding in Pakistan
in 2010. No one could blame the government for the rains, but they were
very much accountable for the subsequent devastation. Over twenty
million people were affected, four million were made homeless, and
nearly two thousand died.</p>
<p>Following severe floods in the 1970s, Pakistan set up the Federal
Flood Commission. On paper this agency has completed about 00 million
worth of dike construction. Of course the reality is very different.
Irrigation and flood control are a source of graft, not public policy.
And when the dikes are built, they serve the interests of the
wealthy—that is, coalition members, not the people. As the floods swept
downstream and threatened huge segments of the population, President
Zardari, who was nicknamed “Mister 10 Percent” for his alleged penchant
to take that portion as his cut, acted as a good autocrat should. He
ignored the problem, headed off to Europe for a high-profile tour, and
left his government to sacrifice the many to save the few. The
government reinforced dikes to protect essential supporters while
allowing flooding to continue in poor areas. Areas with ethnic
minorities and large numbers of opposition supporters were particularly
likely to flood.30</p>
<p>Richard Holbrooke, the late US Special Representative for Pakistan,
described the flood as “an equal opportunity disaster,” but this is far
from the truth. Beholden to a few, Pakistani leaders sacrificed the
many. They reinforced barrages and dikes to protect the homes and farms
of their supporters and ignored the plight of towns and villages. A
local official acknowledged, “Local government figures in the Sindh
province conspired with prominent landowners to bolster the riverbank
running through their property and others deemed important, at the
expense of other regions, which were left vulnerable to flood waters.…
It was not just incompetence on the part of the authorities to protect
the poorest of the poor from potential floods; it was their deliberate
intention that they should suffer if floods were to take place.”31</p>
<p>Obviously, from a good governance stance, this behavior makes no
sense. But in terms of ruling for one’s own survival, it is an ingenious
move. Supporters were reminded of the consequences of being outside the
coalition of essential backers. That is good for loyalty. And aid
agencies rushed to give money. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon,
described the flooding as the worst he had ever seen and called for
massive foreign assistance. Many Pakistanis preferred to directly assist
those affected; as one noted, “We don’t donate to the government because
we know it’s mainly a way for government officials to make money.”32 The
international community was less careful. They gave Pakistan .7 billion
in the first three months. That equates to about 3 per affected person.
Presumably much of the money was siphoned off. It certainly was not used
for efficient disaster management.</p>
<p>Pakistan was not the only nation affected by severe floods in 2010.
Benin faced historic floods that covered two-thirds of the country.
Although the absolute numbers were smaller because Benin is a much
smaller country, in proportion to its size, the scale of the disaster
was very similar to that in Pakistan. Benin received much less
assistance, only about one-twentieth of the aid per affected person that
Pakistan received. Yet despite this, its response has been widely
praised. But then, of course, Benin is much more democratic than
Pakistan. As we have seen over and over again, democratic countries use
money much more wisely than autocracies.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand why Zardari did so little to minimize the
impact of the flood on the masses, and, some have suggested, he may have
deliberately made things worse. He had strong financial incentives. As
the magnitude of the disaster increased, so did the amount of aid. His
survival depended on paying off the few rather than protecting the many.
Aid incentivizes autocratic leaders to fail to fix problems. Had
Pakistan implemented an effective flood-management program instead of
just saying they had, then the people would have been much better off,
but Zardari would have had no pretext to further fleece donors.</p>
<p>Similar incentives plagued Pakistani assistance with the war on
terror. Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the United States
repeatedly sought Pakistan’s assistance in fighting the Taliban and
al-Qaeda and in capturing international terrorists—first and foremost,
Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, who was believed to be hiding
in the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan. Through 2011, when bin
Laden was located and killed by US forces, the US paid Pakistan 2.3
billion in economic and military aid. If Pakistan had captured bin Laden
and prevented the Taliban from operating in northern Pakistan, then the
United States would have been very grateful. But it would also no longer
have needed to pay Pakistan. Just as effective disaster management
reduces the amount of foreign aid, capturing bin Laden would have
diminished the need to give aid to Pakistan’s leaders—or so we
speculated back in 2010 in this book’s first edition. Now we can look at
what happened to the amount of aid received by Pakistan after bin
Laden’s death. Figure 7.2 shows the annual US economic assistance to
Pakistan from the year 2000 to 2020. It seems that after bin Laden’s
death, US assistance to Pakistan went into steep decline. No wonder the
Pakistanis were so angry when the US military eliminated bin Laden, the
reason for Pakistan’s foreign-aid feast.</p>
<p>Figure 7.2: US Foreign Assistance to Pakistan</p>
<p>To understand how aid works, it is essential to take into account the
incentives from the perspective of the leaders who enact policy. Unless
aid is restructured to change these incentives, Pakistan has little
reason to end insurgency and terrorism. Instead, both will be allowed to
rumble on and encouraged to expand if the West tries to cut aid.
Fortunately, in addition to identifying problematic incentives, our
perspective offers the tools to restructure aid to create incentives to
fix problems.</p>
<p>FIXING AID POLICY</p>
<p>The modus operandi of the international community is to give
recipient nations money to fix problems. A common argument is that the
locals know much better how to address their problems than do faraway
donors. That’s probably true, but knowing how to fix local problems and
having the will or desire to do so is quite another matter. This policy
of giving money to recipients in anticipation of their fixing problems
should stop. Instead the United States should escrow money, paying it
out only when objectives are achieved.</p>
<p>Consider the problem of capturing bin Laden. In 2009, the United
States’ top commander, Stanley McChrystal, testified before a Senate
committee, “I don’t think that we can finally defeat al-Qaeda until [bin
Laden is] captured or killed.”33 Suppose the United States thought
billion was a reasonable reward for his capture. Remember: through 2011,
the year he was located and killed by US forces, the US government had
spent over 2 billion without success. Remember also that in 2011 bin
Laden was living in a mansion less than a mile from the Pakistan
Military Academy. We suspect that the Pakistani government had not
really made an effort commensurate with 2 billion!</p>
<p>Rather than dole out billions of dollars each year, suppose the US
escrowed billion, say at a Swiss bank. Upon bin Laden’s capture or
death, Pakistan’s government could have received these funds. The deal
could perhaps have been done more cheaply by dispensing with the fiction
that the money was for the Pakistani people and instead paying it
directly to Pakistan’s leaders.</p>
<p>If aid took the form of a reward-in-escrow scheme, then Zardari would
have needed to hand over bin Laden to receive money. However, unlike the
incentives that existed, he could have delivered without fearing that
the money would dry up once his assistance was no longer needed.</p>
<p>Zardari might have proved unwilling or unable to capture bin Laden
for billion. However, had this been the case, then the United States
would have lost little. The US paid 2 billion and Zardari did not help
find bin Laden’s compound (or at least there is no public evidence that
he helped). Had he stood to gain billion, he might have handed him over
rather than pretend to be looking for him while the money kept
flowing.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there are many operational and procedural problems with
implementing an aid-in-escrow scheme. And these problems would be even
more difficult when it comes to designing escrowed aid relief for
disaster management. Yet it is better to tackle these tricky technical
issues within a framework that incentivizes leaders to solve the problem
the donor wants to address than to carry on with failed policies.</p>
<p>NATION BUILDING</p>
<p>What, then, are the fundamental incentives for one institution to
interfere with the institutions of another? Democracies often claim that
they want to democratize other nations. They frequently justify both aid
and military intervention on this basis, but the evidence that they
actually promote democracy is scant (except in a very few marginal
cases, as we noted earlier). Those who defend such policies tend to cite
Germany and Japan after World War II, but that was more than seventy
years ago, and on close examination it took many years before these
nations developed (or were permitted to develop) independent foreign
policies. The reality is that in most cases democracies, or any other
form of government for that matter, don’t want to create democracies.
Remember back in Chapter 2, we discussed why Rome chose to back the
autocratic Damasus for pope rather than the more democratic Ursinus.
Like contemporary US presidents, Rome’s emperor recognized that
democrats are hard to influence and control. Promoting democracy
overseas makes for great rhetoric, but it seldom enhances a leader’s
interests. Democrats don’t want to create democracies.</p>
<p>In 1939, US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously remarked
about Anastasio Somoza, a brutal Nicaraguan dictator, “He’s a son of a
bitch, but at least he’s our son of a bitch.” And herein lies the rub.
Dictators are cheap to buy. They deliver policies that democratic
leaders and their constituents want, and, being beholden to relatively
few essential backers, autocrats can be bought cheaply. They can be
induced to trade policies the democrat wants for money the autocrat
needs. Buying democrats is much more expensive. Almost every US
president has argued that he wants to foster democracy in the world.
However, the same US presidents have had no problem undermining
democratic, or democratizing, regimes when the people of those nations
elect leaders to implement policies US voters don’t like.</p>
<p>Undermining democracy was the story behind US opposition to the
Congo’s first democratically elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. He
was elected in June 1960 and murdered on January 17, 1961, just half a
year later. Lumumba ran into difficulty with Western democracies because
of the policies he adopted, not because he usurped power. He spoke out
vehemently against the years of Belgian rule over the Congo. In a speech
during Congo’s independence celebration less than a week after his
election as prime minister, Lumumba announced, “Nous ne sommes plus vos
singes” (We are no longer your monkeys).34 In an effort to remove
Belgian troops and diplomats from the Congo and to defeat the
secessionist movement in Katanga Province led by Moise Tshombe, Lumumba
sought Soviet military assistance. That was a big political error. The
massive bulk of evidence today points to US and Belgian complicity in
Lumumba’s murder. Later the United States would become closely
associated with the Congo’s (that is, Zaire’s) Mobutu Sese Seko, who,
unlike Lumumba, was neither democratic nor pro-Soviet. For a price
(totaling billions by the time he fell out of power thirty-two years
after his ascent), Mobutu was willing to back US policy. Democratically
elected Lumumba was not, and that meant he had to go.</p>
<p>Lumumba was not exceptional in his downfall at the hands of
democratic leaders. Hawaii’s Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown in 1893.
Her sin? She wanted Hawaii and Hawaiians (no doubt including herself) to
profit from the exploitation of farming and export opportunities pursued
by large American and European firms operating in Hawaii. As these
business interests organized to depose her, the United States sent in
marines, ostensibly to maintain peace from a neutral stance but in fact
making it impossible for the Hawaiian monarch to defend herself. And
then we ought not to forget the overthrow of democratically elected Juan
Bosch in the Dominican Republic at the hands of the American military in
1965. His offense: he liked Fidel Castro. Or Salvador Allende in Chile,
Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran, or US opposition to the democratically
elected Hamas government in the Palestinian Authority, and the list goes
on. As we write these words, we see this policy of reluctance to promote
democracy at work for the US in the Persian Gulf. The United States has
a long history of supporting useful autocrats. Indeed, US policy in that
part of the world stands as a perfect example of the perils of
democratization. Any incipient democracies in the Gulf would be unlikely
to be positively inclined toward US interests, in part because of deep
policy differences and in part because we’ve been funding for decades
the oppression under which they have been governed. So the United States
continued to back Saudi Arabia’s monarchy even after a Saudi Washington
Post writer, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered in the Saudi embassy in
Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
<p>In case after case, the story is the same. Democrats prefer compliant
foreign regimes to democratic ones. Democratic interventionists, while
proclaiming to be using military force to pursue democratization, have a
profound tendency to reduce the degree of democracy in their targets
while increasing policy compliance by easily purchased autocrats.35</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Before reading this chapter you might have been under the impression
that democrats are angels compared to their autocratic counterparts.
This chapter has tarnished that image, and there will be more tarnishing
to come. But rather than deplore European and Japanese prime ministers
and US presidents on principle, we need to pause for a moment and
consider what they are doing and why.</p>
<p>Democrats deliver what the people want. Because they have to stand
for election and reelection, democrats are impatient. They have a short
time horizon. For them, the long run is the next election, not the next
twenty years. However, as long as we the people want cheap gasoline and
an abundance of markets in which to dump agricultural products, and we
want that more than we want to see genuine development in poor
countries, then our leaders are going to carry out our wishes. If they
don’t, why, they’ll be replaced with someone who will. That’s what
democracy is all about—government of, by, and for the people at
home.</p>
<p>As a classroom experience, Bruce likes to ask his students how many
of them want to help remove poverty in Nigeria or Mali. This idea
produces universal support. And virtually everyone wants the government
to provide aid to make it happen. Yet when push comes to shove,
enthusiasm fades. For instance, he asks how many students are willing to
give up their mobile phone service and have the funds sent to help
Nigeria. Hardly a hand goes up. And when he asks about reducing their
low-interest student loans if the money goes to the world’s poor, even
fewer hands go up, even though he reminds them that they are the world’s
incredibly rich “poor” and that they profess to want to help the world’s
truly poor. Not at their own expense!</p>
<p>Aid is a tool for buying influence and policy. Unless we the people
really value development and are willing to make meaningful sacrifices
toward it, then aid will continue to fail in its stated goals. Democrats
are not thuggish brutes. They just want to keep their jobs, and to do so
they need to deliver the policies their people want. Despite the
idealistic expressions of some, all too many of us prefer cheap oil to
real change in West Africa or the Middle East. So we really should not
complain too much when our leaders try to deliver what we want. That,
after all, is what democracy is about.</p>
