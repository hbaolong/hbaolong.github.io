SIX IF CORRUPTION EMPOWERS, THEN ABSOLUTE CORRUPTION EMPOWERS
ABSOLUTELY</h4>
<p>We have seen how leaders come to power, find money, and provide
public goods, sometimes even for the benefit of society. Yet precious
few successful leaders are motivated primarily by the desire to do good
works on behalf of their subjects. Everyone likes to be liked, and
there’s no reason to think that the powerful have anything against being
beloved and honored by their people. Indeed, it could well be the case
that there are many candidates for high office who pursue power with the
intention of being benevolent leaders. The problem is that doing what is
best for the people can be awfully bad for staying in power.</p>
<p>The logic of political survival teaches us that leaders, whether they
rule countries, companies, or committees, first and foremost want to get
and keep power. Second, they want to exercise as much control over the
expenditure of revenue as they possibly can. While they can indulge
their desires to do good deeds with any money at their discretion, to
come to power and survive in office, leaders must rivet their attention
on building and maintaining a coalition loyal enough that the ruler can
beat back any and all rivals. To do that, leaders must reward their
coalition of essential backers before they reward the people in general
and even before they reward themselves.</p>
<p>We have seen how the coalition’s rewards can come in the form of
public goods, especially when the group of essentials is large. However,
as the essential coalition gets smaller, the efficient thing for any
ruler to do is to emphasize more and more the allocation of resources in
the form of private benefits to her cronies. Why? Private goods to a few
cost less in total than public goods for the many, even when the few get
really lavish rewards. This is all the more true when the coalition not
only is small but also is drawn from a very large pool of
interchangeable selectorate members, each clamoring to become a member
of the winning coalition with its access to myriad private gains.</p>
<p>Successful leaders must place the urge to do good deeds a distant
third behind their own political survival and their degree of
discretionary control. Private goods are the benefits that most help
rulers keep coalition loyalty. It is only the private gains that
separate the essentials from the masses.</p>
<p>For this reason, it’s crucial that we next explore the use of private
rewards as the means to survive in power. It remains to be seen what
rulers do with money they do not have to spend on buying their
coalition’s loyalty—that is, any money whose use is at the incumbent’s
discretion. As we investigate these uses of revenue, we will see that
Lord Acton’s adage, “Power tends to corrupt, absolute power corrupts
absolutely,” holds generally true—however, it doesn’t quite capture the
causality. The causal ties run both ways: power leads to corruption and
corruption leads to power. As the title of this chapter instructs us,
corruption empowers leaders and absolute corruption empowers them
absolutely—or almost so. Remember, as we saw with Louis XIV, no leader
ever has absolute power. That’s why leaders need coalition members who
support them, and why coalition members need opportunities for
enrichment if they are to remain loyal to their leader, empowering her
to stay on in office and get and spend money—on them.</p>
<p>POWER AND CORRUPTION</p>
<p>Corrupt politicians are attractive to would-be supporters, and
politicians eager for power find it easiest to attract corrupt people to
their cause. Leaders want to stay in power and must take whatever
actions are needed to do so. Successful leaders are not above
repression, suppression, oppression, or even killing their rivals, real
and imagined. Anyone unwilling to undertake the dirty work that so many
leaders are called on to do should not pursue becoming a leader.
Certainly anyone reluctant to be a brute will not last long if everyone
knows he is unprepared to engage in the vicious behavior that may be
essential to political survival. If an aspiring leader won’t do terrible
things, they can be sure that there are plenty of others who will. And
if they don’t pay their backers to do terrible things, they can be
pretty confident that those cronies will be bought off, exchanging
terrible deeds for riches and power.</p>
<p>Genghis Khan (1162–1227) understood this principle. If he came across
a town that did not immediately surrender to him, he killed everyone who
lived there and then made sure the next town knew he had done so. That
way, in aggregate, he didn’t actually have to slaughter that many
townspeople. They worked out that things would be better for them if
they gave up, turned their wealth over to him, and accepted that the
Mongols would then pass through, leaving the survivors to fend for
themselves. Genghis went on to rule much of the known world and to die
in his sleep of old age at sixty-five. True, he doesn’t have the
greatest reputation in the West (although he is revered in his homeland
of Mongolia), but he most assuredly was a successful leader.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that England’s Henry V (1387–1422) has a better
reputation than Genghis Khan.1 His St. Crispin’s Day speech in
Shakespeare’s play Henry V is received even by the modern reader with
admiration. We sometimes forget that Henry was capable of brutality.
Much as the English revere him, it may be that he is less warmly
received in France, where, at the siege of Harfleur, Shakespeare had him
announce, in a properly brutal leader’s terms, what he would do if the
town’s governor did not surrender:</p>
<p>If I begin the battery once again,</p>
<p>I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur</p>
<p>Till in her ashes she lie buried.</p>
<p>The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,</p>
<p>And the flesh’d soldier, rough and hard of heart,</p>
<p>In liberty of bloody hand shall range</p>
<p>With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass</p>
<p>Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.…</p>
<p>What say you? Will you yield, and this avoid,</p>
<p>Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy’d?2</p>
<p>Fortunately for Harfleur, on hearing Henry’s words, the governor
surrendered.</p>
<p>The most powerful leaders in history, people like Genghis Khan, Henry
V, or Russia’s Catherine the Great, tend to be autocrats beholden to
only a small coalition. Those who are most successful, especially in the
modern world, also enjoy a secure means of extracting vast revenues,
such as mineral wealth. Provided they remain healthy, such leaders are
practically unassailable. That is to say, they are as close to being
absolute leaders as one can get.</p>
<p>What, then, is an autocrat to do once in power? They should tax
excessively—Genghis Khan is said to have levied a tax of 100 percent
following a conquest. Being a nomad, he didn’t need those he defeated to
produce for the next year, since by then he and his horde would be
elsewhere. They should enthusiastically suppress the people—Joseph
Stalin worked out that killing many to catch but a few “enemies of the
people” was worth the expense and loss of innocent lives. He therefore
made clear to his commissars that an exorbitant error rate in executing
potential enemies of the people was perfectly acceptable. They should
hand out lavish rewards to essential supporters—Catherine the Great made
sure that even her ex-lovers remained loyal by giving them control over
vast tracts of land, thousands of serfs, and the income that came with
them. And finally, they should sock money away for their personal use,
giving themselves a rainy-day fund to bail themselves out of trouble or
assure a soft landing when their luck runs out and they are
overthrown—Haiti’s Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier did just that, living
lavishly in exile in France until he lost most of his fortune to his
ex-wife in a nasty divorce.3</p>
<p>How should nearly absolute leaders behave? In short: be corrupt.</p>
<p>Leaders, essentials, and influentials of autocratic states can flaunt
a dauntingly extravagant degree of wealth, especially when you consider
that their general populations are destitute, starving, and often dying.
Nevertheless, their monopoly on power and force keeps the people down,
and the money keeps the select few happy to enforce the regime’s will
and protect the leader’s power.</p>
<p>Lest anyone jump to the conclusion that this is an apt description
only of dictators, private goods in the democrat’s domain are indeed
worthy of examination. Needing the help of so many, they don’t pay as
much as autocrats, but still, even backers of democrats must have their
rewards.</p>
<p>HOW PRIVATE GOODS WORK</p>
<p>Our version of political logic tells us that private rewards capture
a larger percentage of government spending when there are fewer
essentials. That is surely one reason why we are so much more conscious
of gross corruption in dictatorships than in democracies, and rightfully
so. Transparency International, which rates government corruption every
year, shows that our expectation about dictatorships and autocracies is
generally right. Of the twenty-five most corrupt regimes, according to
Transparency International’s 2020 corruption index, not even one is a
mature democracy.4 Only a very few—Madagascar, for instance—might be
described by some as quasi-democratic, at least in the sense that it
appears to have multiparty elections. We say “appears” because the
opposition parties are severely restricted in their access to the media
and in their ability even to hold public rallies; and the size of the
country’s winning coalition is below the global average. So, to be sure,
the highest levels of corruption do belong to illiberal, small-coalition
regimes. But that does not mean that dependence on a big coalition
exempts a government from corruption. It doesn’t even mean that
large-coalition regimes spend absolutely less on corruption than their
more autocratic counterparts.</p>
<p>Because democratic settings foster lower taxes and more spending on
productivity-enhancing public goods than small-coalition regimes,
dependence on lots of essentials tends to correlate with a successful
economy. Consequently, it is likely to promote a bigger revenue pie than
small-coalition settings, as we discussed earlier. Less of the total
income pie is taken by big-coalition governments, but they are taking a
smaller share of a bigger pie, so they could have more revenue at their
disposal. Even though the private-public goods mix favors more private
benefits in small-coalition regimes, the total amount of private rewards
can be greater in a large-coalition environment. After all, if you
divide an eighteen-inch pizza into twelve slices and a twelve-inch pizza
into only eight slices, one slice of the bigger pie gives you 50 percent
more pizza than a slice of the smaller pie! We can see just how this
works by comparing two countries that are similar in many respects but
different when it comes to coalition size.</p>
<p>Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have much in common. Both, for
instance, are Spanish-speaking nations, are former colonies, and have
Caribbean coastlines. But they differ noticeably in how democratic they
are and in how wealthy they are.</p>
<p>Back in 1975, the two countries had almost identical per capita
income (around ,300). At the time, Nicaragua’s coalition size was 0.44
and the Dominican Republic’s coalition size was 0.53, just 0.09 larger.
Today, the Dominican Republic’s per capita income is about ,000 while
Nicaragua’s has declined to just under ,000. The Nicaraguan coalition
size today is 0.55 while the Dominican Republic’s coalition size is
0.76, 0.21 larger, a meaningful difference. As the number of essentials
in the countries pulled apart, so too did income.</p>
<p>With these numbers in mind, we are going to do a back-of-the-envelope
calculation to illustrate two important characteristics of corruption in
democracies and autocracies: first, autocracies spend a large portion of
their revenue on private rewards, and second, they may spend absolutely
less on corruption than a more democratic polity does.</p>
<p>Nicaragua’s average tax take is 16 percent of the economy. As
expected, the Dominican Republic’s tax take is lower, 13 percent. That
means that Nicaragua’s president, Daniel Ortega, has about 20 per person
available for public and private goods. Let’s suppose he spends half of
that on public goods (60) and half on private goods (60), with no
discretionary money left over for himself (hmm). The president of the
Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, with 13 percent of a larger economy,
has ,040 per person to spend on public and private goods. Because he
relies on a larger coalition, we assume he spends 75 percent (80) on
public goods and 25 percent (60) on private goods, again with no
leftover discretionary funds. In that case, on a per capita basis,
President Abinader spends 00 more on private goods than does President
Ortega. However, Abinader’s slice of the revenue pie going to private
goods is, as we have assumed for illustrative purposes, much smaller
than Ortega’s—25 percent of the total pie compared to 50 percent. That
is why the Dominican Republic’s corruption score on a 0 to 1 scale, with
lower numbers being better, is 0.68, consequentially better than
Nicaragua’s score of 0.81.</p>
<p>Before we discard our envelope, it is useful to do one final
calculation to show why private goods are so much more politically
important in Nicaragua than in the Dominican Republic. Daniel Ortega’s
ability to restrict media and opposition activities and “influence” the
counting of votes means that he is beholden to a smaller number of
supporters than Luis Abinader is. In particular, under the election
rules in the Dominican Republic and in Nicaragua (even if conducted
honestly), Abinader needs 2.5 times more electoral support to be
president than Ortega needs. Although the Dominican Republic is richer
and, in absolute terms, might distribute more private goods, it is the
essentials in Nicaragua who receive the most private goods. Indeed, they
get 50 percent more than the essential supporters in the Dominican
Republic receive. Obviously, essentials in Nicaragua are likely to be
more loyal and beholden to their leader than are their counterparts in
the Dominican Republic!</p>
<p>What, then, are the private rewards that are provided to essentials
in democracies? How might public policy be distorted to create benefits
for some and costs for others?</p>
<p>In more democratic systems, private rewards are likely to come in the
form of distorted public policy rather than more overt forms such as
outright bribery, black marketeering, or extreme favoritism. Tax
structures that favor coalition members, for instance, are a common way
of rewarding the loyal while punishing the opposition. Government
subsidies for the arts—say, the opera—favor a different constituency
than subsidies for preschool, each saving a favored constituency money
and using money from the opposed constituency, at least in part, to pay
for the subsidies.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>It is fashionable to talk about politics in terms of concepts like
ideology or left-right continuums. The standard mantras from either side
of the left-right continuum go something like this: Liberals care about
the poor and are dedicated to alleviating their misery. They are often
stymied by the rich and powerful. The very rich and powerful tend to be
conservative. Conservatives care about the rich and are dedicated to
protecting them from the tax-and-spend inclinations of liberals, whose
supporters, not surprisingly, tend to be relatively poor compared to
conservative backers. As a simplification of politics, that works fine.
We do not challenge this view so much as offer a completely different
way to think about politics.</p>
<p>The rules governing how people rule inevitably divorce the policies
politicians really desire from what they say and do. Not that we doubt
that politicians hold sincere views about good and bad public
policy—rather, those views are not terribly important, and besides,
there are few ways to tell the difference between declarations based on
opportunistic political expediency and true beliefs.</p>
<p>From the perspective of this book, so-called liberals and so-called
conservatives appear simply to have carved out separate electoral niches
that give them a good chance of winning office. Members of the
Democratic Party in the United States like to raise taxes on the rich,
improve welfare for the poor, and seek heavy doses of benefits for the
middle-class swing voters. Republicans in the United States like to
reduce taxes on the rich, decrease welfare for the poor and emphasize
back-to-work programs instead, and, like Democrats, look for a heavy
dose of benefits for the middle-class swing voters. Many of the
tax-and-spend policies, pork-barrel programs, and the like are simply
private goods distributed to the relevant party’s coalition of
essentials. Both parties pay special attention to the middle class
because there are an awful lot of middle-class voters and they can be
tipped either way. They like to define the rich—those who might be asked
to pay higher taxes—as anyone whose income is higher than their own.
They like to think of welfare systems as rife with fraud and cheating
that need to be ferreted out. And they are very happy to have government
programs that disproportionately benefit them—no surprise there—such as
tax deductions on mortgage interest, expanded Medicare benefits,
subsidies for university tuition for their children or student loan
forgiveness, and increases in social security payments even in the
absence of inflation.</p>
<p>The very poor are not likely to vote, but the working poor are, and,
of course, they are likely to vote for people who adopt policies that
benefit them. The less well-off love progressive taxes and hate sales
taxes. Those who hope for expanded and more effective programs for jobs
training, Medicaid, long-term unemployment insurance, and low or no
taxes at their income level tend to turn to candidates most likely to
fulfill their wishes. These wishes are public policies, to be sure, but
they are public policies that benefit primarily the select group whose
voting bloc is essential to the winning candidate. Working-class voters
used to vote Democratic because that was the party that advocated on
their behalf. Donald Trump, building on an insight articulated by Ronald
Reagan in 1977—that blue-collar workers are socially conservative—saw a
way to capture that voting group with promises about job creation and
social policies they like, such as stricter limits on immigration, a ban
on abortion, and protection of gun ownership rights. Because of Trump’s
insight, the less well-off are up for grabs today. The politician who is
likely to succeed in grabbing their votes is the one who adopts the
policies that provide the greatest perceived benefits for their
political support. And, of course, no politician worth his or her salt
will pay any more or any less than necessary to get that support.
Adopting the policies that selectively benefit this or that voter bloc
is just another way of paying out a private reward.</p>
<p>Winning over the relatively low-turnout poorer voters is great, but
by themselves they are probably not enough to form a winning coalition.
And besides, the rich like subsidies too, just like the poor and the
middle class. Republican candidates trying to build a coalition around
the support of the relatively well-to-do are the candidates most likely
to provide these subsidies. The well-off, typically Republican
candidates by and large favor, for instance, government support for
medical research on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and other ailments of
the elderly, who happen to be the wealthiest age cohort in the United
States. What is more, the well-to-do are more likely to live long enough
to suffer from these diseases. They like lower capital gains taxes
because they have enough money that they can invest in the pursuit of
equity gains, and they don’t like inheritance taxes because they can
save enough to leave a tidy sum to their heirs. The poor rarely consume
any of these benefits, but if they pay taxes, they pay for these
benefits to help the rich. But with Democrats controlling numerous
legislatures at the state level, as well as (at the time of this
writing) Congress, it is worth noting that more than 40 percent of
Americans—mostly at the lower income levels—pay no income taxes at all.5
That, after all, is one of the private rewards they covet, just as in
smaller-coalition regimes the rich pay few taxes and covet their private
gains.</p>
<p>Private benefits, whether in large- or small-coalition environments,
distort economies in exactly the self-serving ways we should expect. And
even in the most democratic of polities, these private benefits are
perfectly explainable without appeal to highfalutin principles of
equity, efficiency, or ideology. People support leaders who deliver
policies—whether monetary, cultural, or social—that specifically benefit
them. That’s why earmarks—pork, in colloquial terms—are reviled in
general and beloved by each constituency when the money goes to
them.</p>
<p>This is true outside of the United States as well. As governments
shift toward or away from democracy, or as leaders experience different
degrees of dependence on large or small coalitions in different parts of
their domain, they adjust their private goods–giving accordingly. We can
see this by comparing two countries that inspired hopes for
democratization in the first few years after the Arab Spring: Tunisia
and Turkey.</p>
<p>Tunisia, though bound to hit lots of bumps in the road, seems on a
mostly positive path. To be sure, its economy could be doing better, and
we must never forget that leaders always prefer to shrink their
coalition rather than expand it. Still, Tunisia has definitely moved
toward more accountable governance in the last ten years. Between 2010
and 2020, Tunisia increased the size of its winning coalition by 0.43
points, reaching a score of 0.86 in 2020 (down a bit from its peak of
0.90 in 2013–2014).</p>
<p>Turkey, in contrast, has retreated from the brink of solidly
ensconced democracy. While it was on the cusp of entry into the European
Union as a democratic Muslim country in 1999, its bid for EU membership
was put on hold in 2016. Why? Because its government was transitioning
in the wrong direction. Turkey had made a pretty robust move toward
democracy by the onset of the Arab Spring, seemingly insulating it from
the rebellions to its south. Its coalition score was a solid 0.77 in
2011, up from 0.70 in 2000, but then, following a series of questionable
elections and oppressive policies, Turkey’s democracy began a slow
retreat, and the size of its essential group fell to 0.66 by 2020.</p>
<p>The changes in the essential group in Tunisia and in Turkey should be
harbingers of very different choices over quashing or promoting
corruption. Hence, we are compelled to ask, have these changes really
mattered? Did they matter in the way the logic of the selectorate
perspective tells us they should have mattered? The answer is a
resounding yes to both.</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 shows us levels of corruption and coalition size in
Tunisia and Turkey between the years 2000 and 2020. The graphs couldn’t
tell a clearer story. Expanded coalitions translate into reduced
corruption and contracted coalitions stimulate corruption. Just as our
cynical theory led us to expect, corruption varied almost perfectly with
shifts in the size of Turkey’s and Tunisia’s respective winning
coalitions.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2010, the sizes of the coalitions in Tunisia and
Turkey were stable, and they both had stable scores on corruption
(higher scores mean worse behavior). Turkey, dependent on a larger
coalition, had appreciably less corruption than Tunisia. But then
Tunisia’s government hugely increased its winning coalition following
the Arab Spring in 2011, and corruption there plummeted. In contrast—and
also starting, perhaps coincidentally, right around the time of the Arab
Spring—Turkey’s coalition size slowly but steadily declined. Corruption
rose apace. Then, following an attempted coup in 2015, the decline in
the coalition size began to level off, and so too did the rise in
corruption.</p>
<p>Figure 6.1: Coalition Size and Corruption: The Tales of Turkey and
Tunisia</p>
<p>Many explanations for the changes in Turkey and Tunisia have been
offered. Some look at Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s tilt
toward stronger Islamic identification as the cause of the coup attempt
and other problems Turkey faced. Certainly Islam is compatible with
smaller-coalition regimes. Yet Islam is strongly opposed to corruption,
making it a poor explanation for the rise in Turkey’s private-goods
orientation. If Islamic leanings were the right explanation, we should
have seen corruption fall as Islamic influence rose, but instead we saw
the opposite.</p>
<p>Tunisia’s transformation is sometimes traced to the self-immolation
of Mohamed Bouazizi, a poor street vendor. Indeed, he is often credited
as the inspiration for the Arab Spring. Maybe his death was the
immediate cause, but much else was going on that seems to us essential.
As we have noted, autocrats get toppled when they are thought to be near
death and therefore unable to keep on delivering ample rewards to their
cronies. Tunisian president Ben Ali, nearly seventy-five years old when
Mr. Bouazizi killed himself, was widely rumored to be deathly
ill. Indeed, Le Monde reported on February 17, 2011, just a few weeks
after the start of demonstrations that brought down his government, that
Ben Ali had had a stroke and was in a coma. Of course, the claims that
he was gravely ill within days of his ouster may have been a convenient
fiction. Whether true or not, according to selectorate logic, the belief
that he was gravely ill and coming to the end of his life (he actually
lived until 2019) would have been sufficient to jeopardize his hold on
power in 2011. That same logic tells us that under those circumstances,
ruling coalitions are more likely to expand than to contract, and as it
happens, that is just what happened in Tunisia. Ben Ali fled into exile,
and Tunisia set off on a path of democratization followed by diminished
corruption.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, corruption is endemic to small-coalition regimes.
Governments that transition from autocracy to democracy diminish
corruption in the process. That is what we saw in Tunisia. We saw the
opposite in Turkey as it began a transition from democracy toward
autocracy. It just doesn’t seem that the pursuit or demise of corruption
is all that hard to fathom. It doesn’t seem to depend so much on
culture, religion, altruism, personality, or history as it does on the
size of the essential coalition of key supporters.</p>
<p>Corruption is ubiquitous and an essential part of political survival
in smaller-coalition regimes. Let’s take a look at the record in Russia,
one of the world’s most corrupt states—as such, the political logic of
private goods can be seen vividly at work at the street level.</p>
<p>Low salaries for police forces are a common feature of
small-coalition regimes, and Russia is no exception. At first blush this
might seem surprising. The police are crucial to a regime’s survival.
Police officers are charged with maintaining civil order—which often
boils down to crushing antigovernment protests and bashing in the heads
of antigovernment activists. Surely such behavior must be induced by
either great commitment to the regime or good compensation. But as
elsewhere, the logic of corruption takes a more complex turn.</p>
<p>Though private rewards can be provided directly out of the
government’s treasury, the easiest way to compensate the police for
their loyalty—including their willingness to oppress their fellow
citizens—is to give them free rein to be corrupt. Pay them so little
that they can’t help but realize that it is not only acceptable but
necessary for them to be corrupt. Then they will be doubly beholden to
the regime: first, they will be grateful for the wealth the regime lets
them accumulate; second, they will understand that if they waver in
loyalty, they will be at risk of losing their privileges and being
prosecuted. Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky? He used to be the richest man
in Russia. We do not know whether he was corrupt or not, but we do know
that he was not loyal to the Putin government and duly found himself
prosecuted for corruption. Police face the same threat.</p>
<p>Consider former police major and whistleblower Alexei Dymovsky.6
Mr. Dymovsky, by his own admission, was a corrupt policeman in
Novorossiysk, a city of 225,000 people. He noted that on a new recruit’s
salary of 13 (12,000 rubles) a month, he could not make ends meet and so
had to turn to corruption. Dymovsky claimed he personally only took very
small amounts of money. Whether that is true or not, we cannot know.
What we do know is what happened next.</p>
<p>In a video he made and sent to Vladimir Putin before it became famous
on YouTube, “Mr. Dymovsky also described a practice that is considered
common in Russia: When officers end their shifts, they have to turn over
a portion of their bribes to the so-called cashier, a senior member of
the department. Typically, 5 to 00 a day. If officers do not pay up,
they are disciplined.” According to his own account, Mr. Dymovsky
eventually grew tired of being corrupt and feeling compelled to be
corrupt. As the New York Times reported, he inquired of Vladimir Putin,
“How can a police officer accept bribes?… Do you understand where our
society is heading?” He continued, “You talk about reducing corruption.
You say that it should not be just a crime, that it should be immoral.
But it is not like that. I told my boss that the police are corrupt. And
he told me that it cannot be done away with.”</p>
<p>Dymovsky became something of a folk hero in Russia. It seems his
whistleblowing was much appreciated by many ordinary Russians. The
official governmental response, however, was quite different. He was
shunned, fired, persecuted, prosecuted, and imprisoned. The public
uproar that followed led eventually to his release. No longer a police
officer, he established a business guiding tours of the luxurious homes
of some of his police colleagues. Most notable among these was the home
of police chief Vladimir Chernositov. The chief’s salary was about 5,000
a year—yet he owned a beachfront home on land estimated to be worth
00,000. The chief offered no account of how he could afford his home,
and, it should be noted, he remained in his position as chief. He
certainly did not face imprisonment for his apparent corruption, but
then, unlike Mikhail Khodorkovsky or Alexei Dymovsky, Novorossiysk’s
police chief remained loyal to the governing regime. As for Dymovsky’s
whistleblowing, it did prompt a response from the Kremlin. Russia’s
central government passed a law imposing tough penalties on police
officers who criticize their superiors. As the Times noted, the law came
to be known as the “Dymovsky law.” And then in 2019, Mr. Dymovsky was
arrested, while in a taxicab, for possession of the explosive TNT. How
did the police know he had TNT with him? Well, he had posted a video
pointing to the TNT as real evidence in a crime that the police had
chosen to throw away. That’s his version of the story, anyway.</p>
<p>Corruption is a private good of choice for exactly the reasons
captured by the Dymovsky affair. It ensures loyalty to a regime without
the cost of good salaries, and it guarantees the prosecutorial means to
ferret out any beneficiaries who fail to remain loyal. From a leader’s
perspective, what could be better?</p>
<p>PRIVATE GOODS IN SMALL-COALITION SETTINGS</p>
<p>Liberia’s Sergeant Doe, our by now all-too-familiar example of a
“right-thinking” small-coalition ruler, understood the importance of
private rewards for his cronies. As a US government report observed of
his use of US aid funds, “The President’s primary concern is for
political and physical survival. His priorities are very different from
and inconsistent with economic recovery.… President Doe has great
allegiance to his tribespeople and inner circle. His support of local
groups on ill designed projects undercut larger social objectives.”7
That, in a nutshell, is what private rewards are all about—physical and
political survival, not larger social objectives. What is most
significant about Sergeant Doe’s “misuse” of government money is that it
kept him in power for a decade.</p>
<p>Doe’s story is not unique to him, nor is it unique to Africa; it is
not even unique to governments. It applies to all organizations,
especially when they rely on a small group of essentials. Before
reporting on the world’s many dictators, let’s look at how private
rewards work in a small-coalition regime that most of us think of as
benign and even praiseworthy. We have in mind two sports organizations,
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Fédération Internationale
de Football Association (FIFA), the international governing body of
football—or, to people in the United States, soccer. What, after all,
could be more important to the IOC than advancing the quality (and maybe
the quantity) of international sports competition, free from political
and personal distortions? The answer: lavish entertainment and
money.</p>
<p>The 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Winter Games are perhaps remembered
almost as much for scandal and bribery as they are for athletic
excellence. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) spent millions of
dollars on entertainment and bribes, which included cash, lavish
entertainment and travel, scholarships and jobs for relatives of IOC
members, real estate deals, and even plastic surgery. All of this was
done in the hope that Salt Lake City would be chosen to host the 2002
games. In the fallout, ten IOC members were removed or resigned, ten
others were reprimanded, and Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, who headed the
SLOC, were prosecuted for fraud and bribery.</p>
<p>Yet this was not an isolated incident. Indeed, the Salt Lake bid
committee felt they had been unfairly overlooked as a potential host for
the 1998 Winter Games. The Japanese city of Nagano, which won the
opportunity to host those games, spent over .4 million on entertainment
for IOC officials. Improprieties of this sort abound behind virtually
all hosting bids. During its bid to host the 1996 games, Melbourne,
Australia, arranged a special concert of the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra to showcase the piano playing of the daughter of a South
Korean IOC official. Clearly, any city that wants a serious chance at
hosting the games needs to lay on lavish travel and entertainment.</p>
<p>Corruption and private dealing are not limited to big bribes; money
to be converted into private gains for backers is sought at every level.
Indeed, the 1996 Summer Games, held in Atlanta, demonstrate that no
threat to the IOC’s ability to shift money to its cronies and essential
backers is too small to capture their attention. As the British
newspaper The Independent reported in its business section on March 26,
1995:</p>
<p>Even small entrepreneurs, from T-shirt vendors to Greek restaurants,
need to beware. Under a 1978 US law—the Amateur Sports Act—the United
States Olympic Committee (USOC) has a “super trademark” over any Olympic
symbols or words.…</p>
<p>The promise of strict action has been critical to attempts by the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) to attract official
sponsors, some of which must pay up to 0 million for the privilege.
Those already signed up include Coca-Cola, which is based in Atlanta,
IBM, Kodak, Xerox and the car makers General Motors and BMW.…</p>
<p>Eyebrows have been raised, however, at steps taken to protect the
Olympic trademark. An Atlanta artist wanted the trademark “USAtlanta” to
market her works. ACOG objected, saying that it evoked the 1996
games.</p>
<p>“I think that’s stepping over the line a little bit. I find it hard
to believe that anyone is going to misconstrue her logo as being
designed to profit from the games,” said John Bevilaqua, a sports
sponsorship consultant in Atlanta, who nonetheless sympathizes with the
organizers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the oddest case is that of Theodorus Vatzakas, who opened a
Greek restaurant in Atlanta in 1983—long before the city won the right
to stage the 1996 games—and called it the “Olympic.” In 1991, he was
advised by ACOG that he was infringing the 1978 Act and would have to
change the name. Eventually he did, at a cost to himself of ,000,
calling it “Olympia Restaurant and Pizza.”</p>
<p>“I am very upset about this,” he complained, “but I changed the name
because I don’t have any money to fight these kind of people. Really, I
think it’s crazy.”8</p>
<p>Even one of the authors of this book—Bueno de Mesquita—experienced
firsthand how eager Olympic committees are to control the flow of money
and the opportunities for private gains. His wife, Arlene, together with
two friends, founded a company called Cartwheels (which they eventually
sold) to make fun products, like T-shirts, jewelry, stationery, and
music CDs, all on a gymnastics theme, for competitive gymnasts. As
Arlene recalled about Cartwheels’ experience with regulations from the
IOC and the USOC leading up to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,</p>
<p>Our company designed t-shirts and other products for gymnasts. Prior
to the Atlanta Olympics we tried to design some with rings, a torch, or
any other “Olympic” related logo, but were told that no one would print
them and we would wind up with big legal problems. It didn’t matter if
we used completely different styles or colors from the official designs.
We could not use any form of the word “Olympic,” nor any allusion to
rings or a torch. We even had to stay away from the official colors. In
order to fulfill our clients’ demands for Olympic goods, we had to buy
only official USOC products at greatly inflated prices. Some of the
quality was awful, making us wonder about how some of these companies
got their sponsorship.</p>
<p>The answer, according to our way of thinking, is straightforward.
Cartwheels, like many others, was compelled to pay high prices and buy
from vendors chosen by the IOC or ACOG to fund the pot of money that the
IOC and ACOG used to enrich themselves and pay for the lavish private
rewards they doled out to others. And just as we should expect, quality
was as low as prices were high.</p>
<p>The scandalous corruption that seemed to accompany almost all
business aspects of the Olympics appeared finally to come to a head with
Salt Lake City. The negative publicity surrounding the corruption
scandal did inspire the IOC to promise reforms and to place restrictions
on gifts, luxury travel, and perks in bidding cities. But as the
dictates of political survival lead us to expect, this was unlikely to
last because the Olympic organizations are all small-coalition
operations. In fact, an undercover investigation by the BBC’s news
program Panorama suggested bribery was still active after the Salt Lake
City incident. In the run-up to the announcement of the location of the
2012 games, secretly taped meetings suggested a price on the order of
around 00,000–00,000 per IOC vote.9 Distressing to sports lovers, to be
sure, but no surprise to anyone who thinks about political survival.</p>
<p>That the IOC is plagued by bribery and corruption allegations is
exactly what we should expect based on its institutional structure. The
IOC, created in 1894, runs all aspects of the modern Olympics. The IOC
is composed of no more than 115 members: up to fifteen current athletes,
up to fifteen members of international sporting federations (IFs), up to
fifteen senior members of National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and up to
seventy unaffiliated members. IOC members are nominated and voted in by
existing IOC members. The IOC is responsible for selecting the senior
Olympic executives and executive committees, regulating IFs and NOCs,
and selecting the sites of future games.</p>
<p>Only fifty-eight votes are needed to elect someone IOC president or
select a city to host the games. Not surprisingly, IOC presidents keep
their jobs for a long time and maintain lavish expense accounts. Since
1896, the date of the first modern Olympic games, there have been only
nine IOC presidents, and five of them served for at least seventeen
years. In practice, often even fewer than fifty-eight votes are required
because not all 115 positions on the IOC are filled (in 2021 there were
103 members) and representatives are ineligible to vote on motions
involving their home nation.</p>
<p>The design of the IOC lies at the heart of the scandals it faces.
When fifty-eight votes guarantee victory and the IOC president can
handpick IOC members, politics and control will always revolve around
corruption and bribery. As long as the IOC’s institutions remain as they
are, vote buying and graft will persist because it is the “right”
strategy for any IOC president who wants to survive. Regulating gifts
and travel cannot change the underlying incentives for cities to compete
on the basis of private rewards rather than better management and
facilities for the games.</p>
<p>When billions of dollars are at stake and winning requires the
support of a mere fifty-eight people, any nation that relies solely on
the quality of its sporting bid will be a loser. Salt Lake City learned
this lesson bidding for the 1998 Winter Games. It was an error they did
not repeat for the 2002 games, although they got caught in the process.
Many in Salt Lake might have feigned outrage at the corruption, but many
might also have been glad. After all, in spite of the allegations, the
games were not moved to another city.</p>
<p>The IOC is not alone in engendering corruption. FIFA, soccer’s
international governing body, is even worse. On December 1, 2010, FIFA
announced that it had chosen Russia and Qatar as the sites for the 2018
and 2022 World Cup Finals. Russia beat out bids from European rivals
including England, Belgium and the Netherlands (which put forth a joint
bid), and the Iberian Peninsula (in another joint bid). While there were
many attractive features of Russia’s bid, it is difficult to understand
why Qatar was chosen over Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the United
States.</p>
<p>Qatar, a tiny state in the Persian Gulf, had the world’s
third-largest gas reserves and possibly the highest per capita income in
the world. However, as a site for a soccer tournament, it was
problematic. Sharia formed the basis of its legal code. Alcohol
consumption was harshly punished and homosexuality was banned, and Sepp
Blatter, FIFA president, was condemned for making insensitive remarks on
this topic. Beyond these concerns, the weather remained the most serious
impediment to Qatar’s sponsorship. It is so hot and humid in Qatar that
many of its residents leave for the summer months. To make it possible
for the players to compete, Qatar’s bid entailed constructing new, fully
air-conditioned stadiums. FIFA ultimately agreed to move the tournament
to November and December, when the temperature is much cooler. However,
this shift will severely disrupt domestic competition in the European
football leagues, where many of the world’s top players ply their
trade.</p>
<p>The locations of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were determined by the
twenty-four members of FIFA’s executive committee, meaning that the
location of the finals required the support of only thirteen members—if
that. In the December 2010 vote, only twelve votes were required after
two members were suspended for allegedly trying to sell their votes. One
of these members, Amos Adamu, was caught asking for an 00,000 bribe in a
sting operation by the Sunday Times newspaper. While the money was
nominally for building artificial pitches, the deal required that the
00,000 be paid directly to him. Three days prior to the location vote
the BBC’s Panorama once again exercised its penchant for unearthing
corruption in sports by airing a documentary entitled FIFA’s Dirty
Secret, which detailed bribery and corruption among a number of senior
FIFA officials. It is thought that this severely harmed England’s bid to
host the 2018 finals, since three of the officials accused were among
the twenty-two executive committee voters. Perhaps the fact that the
backers of England’s bids, including then British prime minister David
Cameron, immediately expressed full confidence in the fidelity of the
accused FIFA officials was a telling sign that bribery was the modus
operandi at FIFA. Why call for an investigation, after all, when it
could only imperil England’s future prospects?</p>
<p>In 2015 the US Department of Justice indicted nine FIFA executives on
charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. Swiss
police raided a hotel and arrested seven high-ranking executives on
charges related to bribes worth an alleged 00 million. How did FIFA
respond? Naively, one might have expected them to clean house, but an
Associated Press news report suggested a response more akin to the
“Dymovsky law.”10 Revisions to FIFA rules included the removal of
references to corruption, the addition of a ten-year statute of
limitations for fraud and bribery, and the insertion of a defamation
clause: “Persons bound by this code are forbidden from making any public
statements of a defamatory nature towards FIFA and/or towards any other
person bound by this code in the context of FIFA events.”11 It would
appear that FIFA took the revelation of corruption and bribery much more
seriously than the occurrence of such crimes.</p>
<p>FIFA is a truly small-coalition organization with access to enormous
wealth. In 2018, the year the World Cup Finals were in Russia, it had
revenue of .6 billion. To put that figure in perspective, it had a
larger revenue than 38 of the 127 nations for whom the World Bank
reported data in 2018 (and the World Bank revenue figures are
disproportionately missing for small, poor nations). As of 2021, the
executive committee has grown in size to thirty-seven members: a
substantial increase, but major decisions still only require the support
of nineteen people. Admittedly, FIFA has seen a considerable turnover in
its senior leadership in the last decade; Sepp Blatter was replaced by
Giovanni Vincenzo. But this had much more to do with the actions of
Swiss law enforcement than a lack of coalition loyalty.</p>
<p>The experiences of FIFA and the IOC remind us of how much reform is
needed to limit corruption. Fortunately, devising reforms that would
promote sport and competition over bribery and corruption is
straightforward, and a comparison of bribery at the two institutions
shows why. To buy the Olympics took approximately four times as many
votes as to buy the World Cup, fifty-eight versus thirteen for the games
we discussed. And, if the details of alleged corruption are to be
believed, the size of bribes was substantially smaller, 00,000–00,000
per vote versus 00,000. This is a direct illustration of the role of
institutions in action, and it makes the solution clear.</p>
<p>As the number of supporters needed increases, private goods become
less important. Bribery could easily be made a thing of the past by
simply expanding the IOC. For instance, all Olympians might be made
eligible to vote for the executive officers and the sites of future
games. There were over eleven thousand athletes at the 2016 Summer Games
in Rio de Janeiro and nearly three thousand at the 2018 Winter Games in
Pyeongchang. Alternatively, medalists—or, to prevent overrepresentation
of team sports, one representative per team medal—could become IOC
members. Given that there were 306 sets of medals at the Rio games, if
gold, silver, and bronze medalists become voters, then the Summer Games
alone would add nearly one thousand voters every four years. Within a
few years the body of the IOC would swell, and officials and bidding
cities would have to compete on the quality of leadership, games, and
facilities rather than on lavish travel trips. (Fixing the English
football team, alas, poses a far greater challenge.)</p>
<p>WALL STREET: SMALL COALITIONS AT WORK</p>
<p>From any boss’s perspective, the best way to organize a business is
exactly the same as the best way to organize a government: rely on a
small group of essentials, drawn from a small group of influential
selectors, who are drawn from millions of interchangeable selectors.
That, of course, is a perfect description of most modern, publicly
traded corporations. It also happens to be a pretty good description of
organized crime families. A coincidence? Probably not—and not for the
reasons you may be thinking.</p>
<p>Big corporations do not coerce people to consume their services. In
fact, they provide valuable services that lead people voluntarily to
spend money on them and to make themselves generally better off for
having done so. But, like the mafia and petty dictatorships, publicly
traded corporations are made up of a small coalition, a small group of
influentials, and masses of interchangeables. That means that for their
leaders—the CEOs, CFOs, and other senior management—to survive in
office, they must provide lots of private goods to their coalition of
essential supporters.</p>
<p>The media (itself made up of just such corporations) like to portray
Wall Street businesses as tone-deaf and greedy. We take a broader view:
pretty much all of us are greedy, some for money, some for adulation,
some for power, but all are greedy nevertheless. A few among us have the
opportunity to act on our greed, while most of us are confined to
pursuing our greed in minor ways. Wall Street bankers have the
opportunity to satisfy their desire for money and power in a big way,
and we should not be surprised that they do so.</p>
<p>As we all know, the world economy went through a massive tumble
between 2007 and 2009. The recovery was slow. Even years after the
near-depression’s onset, unemployment remained high and economic growth
meager. And yet—and here is the basis for the media’s accusation of
tone-deafness—Wall Street bonuses remained huge even as the banks lost
their proverbial shirts. Wall Street financial houses distributed 8.4
billion in bonuses in 2008, even though many of the largest Wall Street
firms begged for and got billions in bailout money from the federal
government. Of course, these bonuses, distributed among the leaders,
their coalition, and their influential backers, were the very private
goods that helped keep the existing managers in their jobs. It is
equally worth noting that these bonuses were more than 40 percent lower
than in 2007, the year before the economic collapse. Private goods are
doled out from revenue. If revenue is down, private goods are likely to
go down too, because, after all, leaders want to keep as much for their
discretionary purposes as possible, and when there isn’t much money
around it is not as if those getting private goods can easily find a
better deal by defecting to some alternative leadership. And when
revenues swell, so too do private goods. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic
ravaging many sectors of the economy in 2020, finance did well and Wall
Street paid out over 1 billion in bonuses.</p>
<p>DEALING WITH GOOD-DEED DOERS</p>
<p>We commented earlier that “successful leaders are not above
repression, suppression, oppression, or even killing their rivals, real
and imagined.” The truth of this statement is demonstrated routinely in
the world’s smallest-coalition environments. Alexei Dymovsky’s unhappy
experience in Russia is nothing compared to what happens when
anticorruption campaigns are mounted in really small coalition
settings.</p>
<p>Africa provides many of the worst cases. Daniel Kaufmann, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution, estimates that more than a trillion
dollars is spent annually on bribes worldwide, presumably with most of
it going to government officials. With so much money on the line, it is
no wonder that he also reports, “We are witnessing an era of major
backtracking on the anticorruption drive. And one of the most poignant
illustrations is the fate of the few anticorruption commissions that
have had courageous leadership. They’re either embattled or dead.”12 Two
examples among many are the deaths of Ernest Manirumva of Burundi and
Bruno Jacquet Ossebi in the Congo. Mr. Manirumva was investigating
corruption at high levels in Burundi when he was stabbed to death.
Although he apparently was not robbed of his personal possessions, the
president of the nonprofit organization he was working with reported,
according to the New York Times, that “a bloodstained folder lay empty
on his bed. Documents and a computer flash drive were missing.”13
Coincidence, no doubt!</p>
<p>Mr. Ossebi’s error was to cooperate with Transparency International
in its lawsuit to recover wealth allegedly stolen by Congo’s president.
Mr. Ossebi died as the result of a suspicious fire in his home. Alexei
Dymovsky, if he knows these facts, must count his good fortune in living
in a country that is transitioning away from democracy rather than in
one that never got close to such a status in his lifetime.</p>
<p>CAUTIONARY TALES: NEVER TAKE THE COALITION FOR GRANTED</p>
<p>Whistleblowing is not the only way to get in trouble. Leaders can put
themselves at dire risk if they take their coalition’s loyalty for
granted. The rules governing rulers teach us that leaders should never
underpay their coalition, whether they do so to reward themselves or to
reward the common people. Those who want to enrich themselves must do so
out of discretionary funds, not coalition money. Those who want to make
the people’s lives better likewise should do so only with money from
their own pockets and not at the expense of the coalition. Leaders
sometimes miscalculate what is needed to keep the coalition happy. When
they make this mistake it costs them their leadership role and, very
often, their life. The stories of crime boss “Big Paulie” Castellano and
Roman emperor Julius Caesar are cautionary tales for any who would make
the mistake of not giving the coalition its due.</p>
<p>“Big Paulie” Castellano, who inherited control of the Gambino crime
family in 1976, made just such a mistake. He shifted the focus of the
family business to racketeering and shaking down the construction
industry. Indeed, it was said that no concrete could be poured on
projects worth over million in New York City without the mafia’s
permission. That would have been fine for his crime family if the wealth
from these new activities flowed to its members, or if he continued to
pay sufficient attention to their traditional revenue sources. Instead,
he neglected the traditional businesses, such as extortion, loan
sharking, and prostitution, that were the source of income for his
coalition of mafiosi. When a moment of opportunity presented itself,
triggered by the death of a key supporter, Aniello “Neil” Dellacroce,
and the pressures from the ongoing Mafia Commission Trial prosecuted by
Rudy Giuliani, Castellano’s erstwhile backers turned on him. John “the
Dapper Don” Gotti, Frank DeCicco, Sammy “the Bull” Gravano, and other
captains worked together to gun down Castellano outside of Sparks Steak
House on Forty-Sixth Street in New York.14</p>
<p>Castellano rewarded himself at the expense of his supporters, and it
cost him his life. A couple of thousand years earlier, Julius Caesar’s
mistake was to help the people at the expense of his backers, and this
cost him his life, too. Julius Caesar’s death at the hands of some of
his closest supporters is often portrayed as the slaying of a despot.
But the facts don’t support this interpretation.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar was a reformer. He undertook important public works,
from redoing the calendar to relieving traffic congestion to stabilizing
food availability. He also took steps specifically designed to help the
poor. For instance, he provided land grants to former soldiers and got
rid of the system of tax farming, replacing it with a more orderly and
predictable tax system. Not only that, he relieved the people’s debt
burden by about 25 percent.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, though these policies were popular with the people,
many came at the expense of Rome’s prominent citizens. Tax farming was,
of course, lucrative for those lucky few who got to extract money from
the people. High indebtedness was also lucrative for those who were owed
money. These groups found Caesar’s reforms hitting them straight in
their anachronistic pocketbooks and therefore not at all to their
liking. Popular though many of his reforms might have been with the
woman or man on the street, they harmed the welfare of the powerful
influentials and essentials, and it was of course these people who cut
him down.15</p>
<p>Caesar made the mistake of trying to help the people by using a
portion of the coalition’s share of rewards. It is fine for leaders to
enrich the people’s lives, but it has to come out of the leader’s
pocket, not the coalition’s. The stories of Caesar and Castellano remind
us that too many good deeds and too much greed are equally punished if
the coalition loses out as a result.</p>
<p>As we have seen, there is a fine balance between giving enough
private goods to keep the coalition loyal and giving too much or too
little. When money is spent elsewhere that “rightfully” belongs to the
coalition, there is a serious risk of a coup d’état. When more money is
spent on the coalition than is their due, then the incumbent wastes
funds that would otherwise have been his.</p>
<p>DISCRETIONARY MONEY</p>
<p>What is a leader to do with any money that need not go to the
coalition to buy loyalty? There are two answers to this question: sock
it away in a secret account or lavish it on the people. Those who are
most successful at stealing for their own benefit open the door to
joining our “Haul” of Fame. Those who are more civic-minded spend
discretionary money to help the people, but only some of them are good
at it. The successful join our Hall of Fame and the unsuccessful, those
with bad ideas about civic improvement, become members of our Hall of
Shame.</p>
<p>According to Hank Gonzalez, a politician in Mexico before
democratization, “A politician who stays poor is poor at politics.”16 On
this basis, Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko was a political genius. He
allegedly stole billions. His biographer, Michela Wrong, observed that
“no other African autocrat had proved such a wily survivor. No other
president had been presented with a country of such potential, yet
achieved so little. No other leader had plundered his economy so
effectively or lived the high life to such excess.”17 Indeed, the word
kleptocrat, meaning “rule by theft,” was coined to describe Mobutu’s
style of governance. But though Mobutu made kleptocracy famous, he
didn’t invent it.</p>
<p>King Solomon is reported to have had seven hundred wives. One can
only wonder for how many of them the choice was theirs or his alone. And
then who can forget the economic looting of the Caliphate. A serious
estimate of the Caliphate’s income for the years 918–919 is 15.5 million
dinars, 10.5 million of which—that is, two-thirds of the economy—was
spent on the caliph’s household.18 To put that in perspective, if
President Joseph Biden had that proportion of the US economy available
for his household’s discretionary use, he and Jill would personally
control a cool 4 trillion, give or take a few hundred billion. There,
indeed, is the reason people took such great risks to become the
caliph.</p>
<p>Small-coalition leaders have tons of money to use as they see fit.
Even though they compensate their coalition of essential backers well,
with so few who need to be bribed, plenty is left over. Some incumbents
may choose to use their discretionary pile of money for civic-minded
purposes—we’ll talk about them when we discuss Hall of Shame and Hall of
Fame leaders—but an awful lot just want to sock the money away for a
rainy day. It is to accommodate just such leaders that secret bank
accounts exist.</p>
<p>The prevalence of master thieves among world leaders is striking.
Some succeed on a relatively small scale, such as Alberto Fujimori,
Peru’s president from 1990 to 2000 (including a so-called self-coup in
1992, in which he suspended his own congress and constitution). He
probably didn’t take more than a few hundred million. And with Peru’s
return to democracy, Fujimori, who went into self-imposed exile, found
himself extradited, returned to Peru, put on trial, and convicted of
murder, human rights violations, bribery, and a host of other crimes,
for which he was imprisoned. He just did what any small-coalition leader
does, but he had the misfortune of being removed following popular
discontent with his corruption and being replaced by a large-coalition
regime.</p>
<p>Others do considerably better considering the meager means of their
society. Serbia’s Slobodan Milošević, for instance, is believed to have
accumulated billion in a country where per capita income fell by 50
percent during his rule. He followed key political principles: his
coalition was small; he taxed heavily, allowing him to make a fortune on
the backs of the poor Serbs; and he made sure to keep the people
downtrodden. Reliable reports indicate that he precipitated food
shortages and massive unemployment for Serbs who opposed him, leaving
millions in desperate circumstances while enriching ten thousand
influential supporters.</p>
<p>Moving up the ladder of success when it comes to treating the
national treasury as one’s personal account, we come to Iraq’s Saddam
Hussein. He built billion-dollar palaces for himself while his country’s
infants died of easily treated diseases. Other notable national thieves
distinguished by their relative take given the impoverishment of their
societies are such figures as Uganda’s Idi Amin, Haiti’s Papa Doc
Duvalier, and then his son, Baby Doc Duvalier, and the list goes on.
They all typify the rule of successful autocrats—they know how to build,
manage, and finance tight coalitions while enriching themselves. But
they are all—except for Mobutu—Little Leaguers when compared to the
champion Haul of Famers.</p>
<p>When it comes to the crème de la crème of kleptocrats, some of the
greats include Indonesia’s Suharto (president from 1967 to 1997),
Zaire’s Mobutu (president from 1965 to 1997), the Philippines’ Ferdinand
Marcos (ruled from 1965 to 1986), and perhaps the former president of
Sudan, Omar al-Bashir. He came to power in 1993 and was in office until
he was deposed by a coup in 2019. Estimates of his net worth vary from
billion to billion, probably enough to get by for the rest of his life.
Mr. Suharto, whom The Economist referred to as the king of kleptocrats,
is alleged by Transparency International to have stolen up to 5 billion
from his country.19 His late wife, Madame Tien, was often known as
“Madame Tien percent.” Of course we cannot know what the true amount
captured by his family was, but we do know that he depended on a small
coalition, he had lots of discretionary power, he survived in office for
more than thirty years, and he lived out his life as a free man in
Indonesia (he died in 2008). Apparently he was considered too ill to
prosecute.</p>
<p>Like Suharto, Zaire’s Mobutu lasted in power for more than thirty
years, ousted only once he was known to be suffering from terminal
cancer. Mobutu stole billions and lived the high life, whereas Suharto
lived more modestly considering his alleged means. Mobutu owned villas
in the Swiss Alps, Portugal, the French Riviera, and numerous residences
in Brussels. In addition he had a presidential palace in just about
every major town in Zaire, including his hometown of Gbadolite. With a
population of about 114,000, one would not have thought the town needed
an airport that could handle the supersonic Concorde, but then one of
the 114,000 sometime-residents was Mobutu. He apparently rented the
Concorde from Air France for his personal use, and, needing a proper
airfield for it to land and take off, he built one for himself.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Marcos, like Suharto, seemingly ran a successful economy.
The growth rate during many of Marcos’s years was quite good, but then
the Philippine population was growing faster than the economy. Whereas
Suharto had been successful at controlling population growth, Marcos did
not do so well. But he certainly did well in enriching his coalition and
himself through his so-called crony-capitalism system. Transparency
International estimated that Marcos looted billions from his country.
His wife, Imelda, notorious for her enormous shoe collection, was
brought up on charges related to the family’s theft of Philippine
wealth, and the government succeeded in recovering 84 million, a
relatively small portion of the total allegedly taken by Marcos and his
family. Despite their alleged thievery, the Marcos family, remarkably,
has made a political comeback in the Philippines. It seems money really
makes the world—of politics—go round!</p>
<p>Returning to Omar al-Bashir, he was accused of having taken up to
billion from his country. This was one of the revelations that came to
light when Wikileaks released US diplomatic cables in late 2010. The
claim, made by Luis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor for the
International Criminal Court, included the allegation that Bashir’s
money was held by Lloyd’s of London. They denied it, and, of course, so
did Bashir. Indeed, the Guardian reported that Khalid al-Mubarak,
government spokesperson at the Sudanese embassy in London while Bashir
was still in power, said, “To claim that the president can control the
treasury and take money to put into his own accounts is ludicrous—it is
a laughable claim by the ICC prosecutor.”20 When he was deposed in 2019
there was allegedly 30 million in cash in his house. He was convicted
and sentenced to two years in jail for money laundering.</p>
<p>Discretion means leaders have choices. So far we have looked at
leaders who use their discretion to enrich themselves, but we do not
mean to suggest that people in power must be greedy louts like Marcos,
Mobutu, Suharto, and Bashir. It is entirely possible for autocrats to be
civic-minded, well-intentioned people, eager to do what’s best for the
people they govern. The trouble with relying on such well-intentioned
people is that they are unconstrained by the accountability of a large
coalition. It is hard for a leader to know what the people really want
unless they have been chosen through the ballot box and they allow a
free media and freely assembled groups to articulate their wishes.
Without the accountability of free and fair elections, a free press,
free speech, and freedom of assembly, even well-intentioned
small-coalition rulers can only do whatever they and their coalition
advisers think is best.</p>
<p>We close by reflecting on exemplars among well-intentioned leaders of
what we call the Hall of Shame and the Hall of Fame—that is, those who
wanted to do well and didn’t, and those who wanted to do well and did.
The Soviet Union’s Nikita Khrushchev well illustrates a member of the
Hall of Shame.</p>
<p>Khrushchev visited the United States in 1959 and announced a new
agricultural policy. He asserted that the USSR would overtake the United
States in the production of meat, milk, and butter. He neither knew much
about agriculture nor was directly accountable to the people who did and
who would be burdened with trying to achieve his goals. There is no
reason to believe that Khrushchev hoped to gain personally from his
ill-conceived agricultural policies. Indeed, there is no evidence that
he socked away public money for his personal use. Rather, he seems
genuinely to have wanted to improve the lot of the Soviet people.</p>
<p>Good intentions notwithstanding, his agricultural program and its
implementation were a disaster. Local officials, wishing to please
Khrushchev and sensitive to the potential political consequences of
failing to meet his expectations, committed to fulfilling his demand for
increased production. But his goals could not be met with the primitive
farming technology available in the Soviet Union. The upshot of
Khrushchev’s civic-minded ideas was that farmers had to slaughter even
their breeding cattle to meet the meat quotas to which they were
committed. They even went as far as to buy meat from state stores and
later pretend that they had produced it when they sold it back to the
government. This created both a false sense of improved production and
subsequent increases in prices as the slaughter of the breeding cattle
reduced the size of future herds.</p>
<p>A few short years into his program, food prices skyrocketed, leading
to mass movements against the government. Official Soviet reports
indicate that 22 people were killed, 87 were wounded, 116 demonstrators
were imprisoned, and 7 were executed in response to the people’s taking
to the streets.21 Two years later, with the Soviet economy in shambles,
the nation rife with food shortages, and the leadership humiliated in
the Cuban missile crisis, Khrushchev was overthrown in a peaceful coup.
A bit more than twenty years later, Mikhail Gorbachev followed in
Khrushchev’s footsteps by introducing economic reforms to mobilize the
economy. His programs also failed to have the effect he desired, but in
his case they led not only to his ouster but also to the end of the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping in China mirrored Khrushchev and
Gorbachev, but with an important difference. All of these leaders seem
to have been initially motivated by the sincere desire to improve the
economy. All seemed to have recognized that failing to get the economy
moving could pose a threat to their hold on power. But unlike Mao,
Mikhail, and Nikita, Deng belongs squarely in the Hall of Fame. Like
them, he was not accountable to the people, and like them, he did not
hesitate to put down mass movements against his rule. The horrors of
Tiananmen Square should not be forgotten. But unlike his fellow
dictators, he actually had good ideas about how to improve economic
performance.</p>
<p>Deng and Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew are surely among the contemporary
world’s greatest icons of the authoritarians’ Hall of Fame. They did not
sock fortunes away in secret bank accounts (to the best of our
knowledge). They did not live the lavish lifestyles of Mobutu Sese Seko
or Saddam Hussein. They used their discretionary power over revenue to
institute successful, market-oriented economic reforms that,
respectively, made Singaporeans among the world’s wealthiest people and
lifted millions of Chinese out of abject poverty. Nothing about their
actions contradicts the rules of successful, long-lasting governance.
They were brutal when that served their interest in staying in power,
Deng with murderous violence and Lee Kuan Yew through the power of the
courts to drive his opponents into bankruptcy. Lee’s approach was vastly
more civilized than Deng’s, but nevertheless it was the arbitrary and
tough use of power dictated by the logic of political survival. And
that, in the end, is what politics is all about.</p>
<p>★ ★ ★</p>
<p>Most people think that reducing corruption is a desirable goal. One
common approach is to pass additional legislation and increase sentences
for corruption. Unfortunately, such approaches are counterproductive.
When a system is structured around corruption, everyone who matters,
leaders and backers alike, is tarred by that corruption. They would not
be where they are if they had not had their hand in the till at some
point. Increasing sentences simply provides leaders with an additional
tool with which to enforce discipline. It is all too common for
reformers and whistleblowers to be prosecuted for one reason or another.
It is rumored that Yasser Arafat kept a record of all the corrupt
activities of the cabinet members in his government in the Palestinian
Authority. Increasing the punishment for corruption only increases the
leverage people like Arafat have over their cronies. Arafat effectively
induced loyalty to him by both allowing and monitoring crony corruption
within his inner circle. And, while claiming that the Palestinian
Authority was bankrupt, he allegedly personally socked away a vast
fortune, between .2 billion and .5 billion according to ArabNews.22</p>
<p>Legal approaches to eliminating corruption won’t ever work and can
often make the situation worse. The best way to deal with corruption is
to change the underlying incentives. As coalition size increases,
corruption becomes a thing of the past. As we proposed for the IOC and
FIFA, increasing the number of members responsible for choosing the
sites of the games could end graft. The same logic prevails in all
organizations. If politicians want to end massive bonuses for bankers,
then they need to pass legislation that fosters the restructuring of
corporate government so that chief executive officers and board chairs
really depend on the will of their millions of shareholders (and not on
a handful of government regulators). As long as corporate bosses are
beholden to relatively few people, they will provide those few key
supporters with fat bonuses. Big bonuses might not be popular with the
public or even with their many shareholders, but the public and
unorganized shareholders can’t simply depose corporate executives.
Insiders at the bank can. Legislating limits on compensation will simply
force CEOs to resort to convoluted and quasi-legal means. Such measures
cannot improve corporate transparency or make balance sheets easier to
understand.</p>
<p>Those seeking to regulate corporate compensation and put businesses
on the straight and narrow path to enhancing shareholder welfare would
do well to examine closely the rules by which corporations are ruled.
First-blush fixes, such as are often proposed by government officials,
play well with their political constituencies but also violate the
fundamental logic of governance and so are likely to undermine good
corporate governance. Consider the problem of corporate fraud. We have
amassed considerable evidence that securities fraud is more likely to be
committed by firms with financial problems and a large coalition than by
firms with comparable financial problems and a small coalition. After
all, executives who depend on a relatively large coalition are
particularly vulnerable to being replaced when corporate performance is
poor. Being at greater risk of deposition, larger-coalition executives
try to hide poor corporate performance through fraudulent reporting.23
What is more, one of the best early indicators of corporate fraud is
that senior management is paid less—not more—than one would expect given
the firm’s reported performance!</p>
<p>The same issues hold when examining governments. Politicians can
introduce all sorts of legislation and structure administrations to seek
out and prosecute corruption. This looks good to the voters. But such
measures either are a facade behind which it is business as usual or are
designed as a weapon to be used against political opponents. Neither a
smokescreen nor a witch hunt will root out sleaze. But make political
leaders accountable to more people and politics becomes a competition
for good ideas, not bribes and corruption.</p>
<p>Of course, leaders don’t want to be more accountable. It reduces
their tenure in office and gives them less discretion. That’s why we
must next turn to the difficult problem of how to get leaders to agree
to changes that benefit the people.</p>
