<h4 id="chapter-3-how-not-to-die-from-brain-diseases">CHAPTER 3 How Not
to Die from Brain Diseases</h4>
<p>My mom’s father died of a stroke, and her mother died of Alzheimer’s
disease.</p>
<p>As a kid, I loved going to see my grandma in Long Island. We lived
out west, so I got to fly on a plane—sometimes all by myself! She was
the perfect—and perfectly doting—grandmother. She’d want to take me to
toy stores, but, geeky me, I just wanted to go to the library. When we’d
get back to the house, my arms filled with borrowed books, she’d let me
sit way back on her big couch—shoes off, of course—and read and draw
pictures. Then she’d bring me blueberry muffins she made with a big
mechanical mixer that took up half the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>Later in life, my grandma started to lose her mind. By then, I was in
medical school, but my newfound knowledge was useless. She had turned.
My previously sweet and stately grandmother? Now she threw things at
people. She cursed. Her caretaker showed me the teeth marks on her arm
where my once kind, loving grandma had bitten her.</p>
<p>That’s the horror of brain disease. Unlike a problem with your foot
or your back or even another vital organ, brain disease can attack your
self.</p>
<p>The two most serious brain diseases are stroke, which kills nearly
130,000 Americans each year,1 and Alzheimer’s disease, which kills
nearly 85,000.2 Most strokes can be thought of as “brain attacks”—like
heart attacks, but the rupturing plaques in your arteries cut off blood
flow to parts of the brain rather than to parts of the heart.
Alzheimer’s is more like a mind attack.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most physically and emotionally
burdensome diseases, for both sufferers and caregivers. Unlike stroke,
which can kill instantly and without any warning, Alzheimer’s involves a
slower, more subtle decline over months or years. Instead of
cholesterol-filled plaques in your arteries, plaques made of a substance
called amyloid develop in the brain tissue itself, associated with the
loss of memory and, eventually, loss of life.</p>
<p>While the pathology of stroke and Alzheimer’s are different, one key
factor unites them: Mounting evidence suggests that a healthy diet may
help prevent them both.</p>
<p>STROKE</p>
<p>In about 90 percent of strokes,3 blood flow to part of the brain gets
cut off, depriving it of oxygen and killing off the part fed by the
clogged artery. That’s called an ischemic stroke (from the Latin
ischaemia, meaning “stopping blood”). A small minority of strokes are
hemorrhagic strokes, which are caused by bleeding into the brain when a
blood vessel bursts. The damage wrought by a stroke depends on which
area of the brain was deprived of oxygen (or where bleeding occurred)
and for how long the deprivation lasted. People who experience a brief
stroke might only need to contend with arm or leg weakness, while those
who suffer a major stroke can develop paralysis, lose the ability to
speak, or, as is too often the case, die.</p>
<p>Sometimes the blood clot lasts only a moment—not long enough to
notice but still long enough to kill off a tiny portion of your brain.
These so-called silent strokes can multiply and slowly reduce cognitive
function until full-blown dementia develops.4 The goal is to reduce the
risk of both the massive strokes that can kill you instantly and the
ministrokes that kill you over the course of years. Just as with heart
disease, a healthy diet can reduce stroke risk by reducing cholesterol
and blood pressure while improving blood flow and antioxidant
capacity.</p>
<p>Fiber! Fiber! Fiber!</p>
<p>In addition to its well-known effects on bowel health, high fiber
intake appears to reduce the risk of cancers of the colon5 and breast,6
diabetes,7 heart disease,8 obesity,9 and premature death in general.10 A
number of studies now show that high fiber intake may also help ward off
stroke.11 Unfortunately, less than 3 percent of Americans meet the
minimum daily recommendation for fiber.12 This means about 97 percent of
Americans eat fiber-deficient diets. Fiber is naturally concentrated in
only one place: whole plant foods. Processed foods have less, and
animal-derived foods have no fiber at all. Animals have bones to hold
them up; plants have fiber.</p>
<p>It apparently doesn’t take much fiber to cut stroke risk. Increasing
fiber intake by just seven grams a day may be associated with a 7
percent risk reduction.13 Different strokes for different
folks—depending, evidently, on how much fiber they ate. An additional
seven grams of fiber is easy to add to your diet; it’s the equivalent of
a bowl of oatmeal with berries or a serving of baked beans.</p>
<p>How does fiber protect the brain? We’re not exactly sure. We do know
that fiber helps control your cholesterol14 and blood sugar levels,15
which can help reduce the amount of artery-clogging plaque in your
brain’s blood vessels. High-fiber diets may also lower blood pressure,16
which reduces the risk of brain bleeds. But scientists don’t have to
know the exact mechanism before you act on this knowledge. As the
biblical passage goes: “A man scatters seed on the ground … the seed
sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.” Had the farmer from
scripture postponed his sowing until he understood the biology of seed
germination, he wouldn’t have lasted very long. So why not go ahead and
reap the benefits of eating fiber by eating more unprocessed plant
foods?</p>
<p>It’s never too early to start eating healthier. Though stroke is
considered an older person’s disease—only about 2 percent of stroke
deaths occur before the age of forty-five17—the risk factors may begin
accumulating in childhood. In a remarkable study published recently,
hundreds of children were followed for a period of twenty-four years,
from junior high school to adulthood. Researchers found that low fiber
intake early on was associated with stiffening of the arteries leading
up to the brain—a key risk factor for stroke. By the time these
adolescents were only fourteen, clear differences in arterial health
were found for those consuming different amounts of fiber in their daily
diets.18</p>
<p>Again, it did not appear to take much. One more apple, an extra
quarter cup of broccoli, or just two tablespoons of beans a day during
childhood could translate into a meaningful effect on artery health
later in life.19 If you really want to be proactive, the best available
science20 suggests you can minimize stroke risk by eating a minimum of
25 grams a day of soluble fiber (fiber that dissolves in water,
typically found in beans, oats, nuts, and berries) and 47 daily grams of
insoluble fiber (fiber that does not dissolve in water, found primarily
in whole grains, such as brown rice and whole wheat). Granted, you’d
have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to attain this level of
fiber intake, far beyond what is arbitrarily determined as adequate by
most health authorities.21 Rather than patronizing you with what they
think is “achievable”22 by the masses, though, I wish these authorities
would just tell you what the science says and let you make up your own
mind.</p>
<p>Potassium</p>
<p>Take a plant, any plant, and burn it to ash. Throw that ash in a pot
of water, boil it, skim off the ashes, and eventually you’ll be left
with a white residue known as potash (“pot ash”). Potash has been used
for millennia for making everything from soap and glass to fertilizer
and bleach. It wasn’t until 1807 that an English chemist figured out
that this “vegetable alkali” contained an undiscovered element, which he
called pot-ash-ium—that is, potassium.</p>
<p>I mention this simply to emphasize the primary source of potassium in
your diet—namely, plants. Every cell in your body requires potassium to
function, and you need to get it from your diet. For much of human
history, we ate so many plants that we got upward of 10,000 mg of
potassium every day.23 Nowadays, less than 2 percent of Americans even
reach the recommended daily intake of 4,700 mg.24</p>
<p>The major reason is simple: We don’t eat enough unprocessed plant
foods.25 What does potassium have to do with stroke? A review of all the
best studies on the relationship between potassium and our top-two
killers, heart disease and stroke, determined that a 1,640 mg increase
per day in potassium intake was associated with a 21 percent reduction
in stroke risk.26 That isn’t enough to bring the average American’s
potassium levels to where they should be, but it’s still enough to
substantially reduce the risk of stroke. Imagine how much lower your
risk would be if you doubled or tripled your intake of whole plant
foods.</p>
<p>Bananas, although they’ve been marketed for their potassium content,
aren’t actually particularly rich in the mineral. According to the
current U.S. Department of Agriculture database, bananas don’t even make
the list of the top-thousand foods with the highest levels of potassium;
in fact, they come in at number 1,611, right after Reese’s Pieces.27
You’d have to eat a dozen bananas a day just to get the bare minimum
recommended amount of potassium.</p>
<p>What are some of the truly potassium-rich foods? The healthiest
common whole-food sources are probably greens, beans, and sweet
potatoes.28</p>
<p>Citrus</p>
<p>Good news for all you orange lovers: Citrus fruit intake has been
associated with reduced stroke risk—even more so than apples.29 Say I
can’t compare them? I just did! The key may lie with a citrus
phytonutrient called hesperidin, which appears to increase blood flow
throughout the body, including the brain. Using a machine known as a
doppler fluximeter, scientists can measure blood flow through the skin
using a laser beam. If we hook people up to this machine and give them a
solution containing the amount of hesperidin found in two cups of orange
juice, blood pressure decreases and overall blood flow increases. When
subjects drank straight orange juice instead of the hesperidin solution,
their blood flow was even better. In other words, the stroke-reducing
effects of oranges extend beyond just the hesperidin.30 When it comes to
food, the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>The positive effects of citrus fruits on blood flow don’t require a
machine to measure them. In one study, scientists recruited women who
suffered from sensitivity to cold weather due to poor blood flow—women
with chronically cold hands, feet, and toes—and placed them in a highly
air-conditioned room. The women in the experimental group drank a
solution containing actual citrus phytonutrients, while another
(control) group drank a placebo (an artificially flavored orange drink).
The placebo drinkers got colder and colder. Because of decreased blood
flow, the temperature of their fingertips dropped nearly 9 degrees
Fahrenheit during the course of the study. The fingertips of the women
who drank real citrus, meanwhile, cooled less than half as fast, because
their blood flow remained steadier. (The researchers also had both
groups of women plunge their hands into icy water and saw the citrus
drinkers recover about 50 percent faster than the control group.)31</p>
<p>So eating a few oranges before snowboarding may help keep your
fingers and toes from getting as chilly. But while warm digits are nice,
the reduced stroke risk associated with higher citrus intake is even
nicer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Optimal Sleep Duration and Stroke</p>
<p>Lack of sleep, or even too much of it, is associated with increased
stroke risk.32 But how much sleep may be too little? How much too
much?</p>
<p>Scientists in Japan were the first to take a major stab at this
question. They followed nearly 100,000 middle-aged men and women for
fourteen years. Compared with people who slept an average of seven hours
per night, subjects who got four hours of sleep or less, or ten hours or
more, had roughly a 50 percent greater likelihood of dying from a
stroke.33</p>
<p>A recent study of 150,000 Americans was able to examine the issue
more thoroughly. Higher stroke rates were found among individuals
sleeping six hours or less, or nine hours or more. Those at lowest risk
got around seven or eight hours of sleep a night.34 Large studies in
Europe,35 China,36 and elsewhere37 have confirmed that seven or eight
hours appears to be associated with the lowest risk. We’re not sure if
the relationship is cause and effect, but until we know more, why not
aim for that range? Sleep well!</p>
<hr />
<p>Antioxidants and Stroke</p>
<p>Awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest honor for
scientific achievement in this country, revered biochemist Earl Stadtman
was quoted as saying, “Aging is a disease. The human lifespan simply
reflects the level of free radical damage that accumulates in cells.
When enough damage accumulates, cells can’t survive properly anymore and
they just give up.”38</p>
<p>First proposed in 1972,39 this concept—now called the mitochondrial
theory of aging—suggests that free radical damage to your cells’ power
source, known as mitochondria, leads to a loss of cellular energy and
function over time. This process may be a little like charging your iPod
battery over and over—each time, its capacity gets less and less.</p>
<p>But what exactly are free radicals, and what can we do about
them?</p>
<p>Here’s my best attempt to simplify the quantum biology of oxidative
phosphorylation: Plants get their energy from the sun. You take a plant
and place it in the sun, and through a process called photosynthesis,
the chlorophyll in the leaves harnesses the sun’s energy and transfers
it to tiny building blocks of matter called electrons.</p>
<p>The plant starts out with low-energy electrons and, using the energy
of the sun, charges them up into high-energy electrons. In this way,
plants store the sun’s energy. When you then eat the plant (or the
animals who ate the plant), these electrons (in the form of
carbohydrates, protein, and fat) are delivered to all your cells. Then
your mitochondria take the plant’s power-packed electrons and use them
as an energy source—that is, as fuel—and slowly release their energy.
Mind you, this process has to occur in a precise, tightly controlled
manner, because these electrons are packed with energy and are therefore
volatile, like gasoline.</p>
<p>In fact, gasoline, petroleum, oil, and charcoal aren’t called fossil
fuels for nothing. The tanks of our SUVs are filled with mostly
prehistoric plant matter that stored the energy of the sun that shone
millions of years ago as high-energy electrons.</p>
<p>And just as it would be dangerous to toss a match into a can of
gasoline and release all its energy at once, your body has to be
cautious. That’s why your cells take these same high-energy electrons
from the plants you eat and release their energy in a controlled manner,
like a gas stove—just a little at a time until the energy is used up.
Your body then passes these used-up electrons to an all-important
molecule you may have heard of: oxygen. In fact, the way poisons like
cyanide kill you is by preventing your body from giving up these spent
electrons to oxygen.</p>
<p>Fortunately, oxygen loves electrons, although maybe a little too
much. While your body is taking its sweet time, slowly releasing the
electrons’ energy, the oxygen is waiting impatiently at the end of the
line. Oxygen would love to get its grubby little hands on one of those
high-energy electrons, but your body says, “Hold on. We’ve got to do
this slowly, so wait your turn and let it cool off first. We’ll give you
your electron, but only after we’ve removed the energy so it’s safe to
play with.”</p>
<p>Then the oxygen molecule gets all huffy and exclaims, “I could handle
one of them souped-up electrons any day!” Pouting, it spies a stray
high-energy electron sitting out in the open. Oxygen looks left, looks
right, and then pounces on it. Your body isn’t perfect; it can’t keep an
eye on oxygen all the time. About 1–2 percent40 of all high-energy
electrons that pass through your cells leak out where oxygen can grab
them.</p>
<p>When oxygen gets its hands on a high-energy electron, it basically
turns into the Hulk, changing from lowly oxygen into what’s called
superoxide, a type of free radical. A free radical is what it sounds
like—a molecule that can be unstable, out of control, and violently
reactive. The superoxide is just pumped up with energy and can start
smashing around the cell, knocking stuff over and tripping over your
DNA.</p>
<p>When superoxide comes in contact with DNA, it can damage your genes,
which, if not repaired, can cause mutations in your chromosomes that may
lead to cancer.41 Thankfully, the body calls in its defense squad, known
as antioxidants. They arrive at the scene and say, “Drop that
electron!”</p>
<p>The superoxide fights back. “You want a piece of me, Mr. Vitamin C?
Bring it!”</p>
<p>So the antioxidants proceed to jump the superoxide and wrestle the
supercharged electron away from it, leaving behind poor little oxygen
and its ripped jeans.</p>
<p>In scientific circles, the phenomenon by which oxygen molecules grab
stray electrons and go crazy is called oxidant, or oxidative, stress.
According to the theory, the resulting cellular damage is what
essentially causes aging. Aging and disease have been thought of as the
oxidation of the body. Those brown age spots on the back of your hands?
They’re just oxidized fat under the skin. Oxidant stress is thought to
be why we all get wrinkles, why we lose some of our memory, why our
organ systems break down as we get older. Basically, the theory goes,
we’re rusting.</p>
<p>You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing
lots of antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in
antioxidants by slicing it open, exposing it to air (oxygen), and then
seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s oxidizing. Think about our
two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown quickly,
which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them. (Most of the
antioxidants in apples are in the peels.) Cut open a mango and what
happens? Nothing happens, because there are lots of antioxidants in
there. How do you keep fruit salad from turning brown? By adding lemon
juice, which contains the antioxidant vitamin C. Antioxidants can keep
your food from oxidizing, and they may do the same inside your body.</p>
<p>One of the diseases antioxidant-rich foods may help prevent is
stroke. Swedish researchers followed more than thirty thousand older
women over a period of a dozen years and found that those who ate the
most antioxidant-rich foods had the lowest stroke risk.42 Similar
findings were reported in a younger cohort of men and women in Italy.43
As with lung disease,44 antioxidant supplements don’t appear to help.45
Mother Nature’s powers cannot be stuffed into a pill.</p>
<p>Knowing this, scientists set out to find the most antioxidant-rich
foods. Sixteen researchers spanning the globe published a database of
the antioxidant power of more than a whopping three thousand foods,
beverages, herbs, spices, and supplements. They tested everything from
Cap’n Crunch cereal to the crushed dried leaves of the African baobab
tree. They tested dozens of brands of beer to see which has the most
antioxidants. (Santa Claus beer from Eggenberg, Austria, tied for first
place.)46 Sadly, beer represents Americans’ fourth-largest source of
dietary antioxidants.47 You can check out the list to see where your
favorite foods and beverages rank at this link:
http://bit.ly/antioxidantfoods.</p>
<p>No need to post the 138-page chart on your fridge, though. Here’s the
simple rule: On average, plant foods contain sixty-four times more
antioxidants than animal foods. As the researchers put it,
“[A]ntioxidant rich foods originate from the plant kingdom while meat,
fish and other foods from the animal kingdom are low in antioxidants.”48
Even the least healthy plant food I can think of, good old American
iceberg lettuce (which is 96 percent water!49), contains 17 units
(daμmol using a modified FRAP assay) of antioxidant power. Some berries
have more than 1,000 units, to give you some perspective, making iceberg
look pretty pathetic. But compare iceberg lettuce’s 17 units to fresh
salmon, which has only 3 units. Chicken? As few as 5 units of
antioxidant power. Skim milk or a hard-boiled egg? Just 4 units, and Egg
Beaters has a big old goose egg—0 units. “Diets comprised mainly of
animal-based foods are thus low in antioxidant content,” concluded the
research team, “while diets based mainly on a variety of plant-based
foods are antioxidant rich, due to the thousands of bioactive
antioxidant phytochemicals found in plants which are conserved in many
foods and beverages.”50</p>
<p>There is no need to necessarily cherry-pick individual foods to boost
your antioxidant intake (though cherries do have up to 714!); you can
simply strive to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and
spices at every meal. This way, you can continuously flood your body
with antioxidants to help ward off stroke and other age-related
diseases.</p>
<hr />
<p>Antioxidants, in a Pinch</p>
<p>The food category that averages the most antioxidants is herbs and
spices.</p>
<p>Let’s say you prepare a nice healthy bowl of whole-wheat pasta with
marinara sauce. Together, they may achieve a score of about 80 units of
antioxidant power (approximately 20 units from the pasta and 60 from the
sauce). Add in a handful of steamed broccoli florets, and you may end up
with a delicious 150-unit meal. Not bad. Now sprinkle on a single
teaspoonful of dried oregano or marjoram, oregano’s sweeter and milder
twin. That alone could double your meal’s antioxidant power, up to more
than 300 units.51</p>
<p>How about a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast? By adding just a
half-teaspoon of cinnamon, you could bring the antioxidant power of your
meal from 20 units to 120 units. And if you can stand the punch, adding
even a pinch of cloves could bring your unassuming breakfast up to an
antioxidant score of 160 units.</p>
<p>Plant-based meals tend to be rich in antioxidants on their own, but
taking a moment to spice up your life may make your meal even
healthier.</p>
<hr />
<p>Antioxidant-rich diets appear to protect against stroke by preventing
the circulation of oxidized fats in the bloodstream that can damage the
sensitive walls of small blood vessels in the brain.52 They can also
help decrease artery stiffness,53 prevent blood clots from forming,54
and lower blood pressure55 and inflammation. Free radicals can disfigure
proteins in our bodies to the extent they become unrecognizable by our
immune systems.56 The inflammatory response this triggers can be
prevented by saturating our bodies with sufficient antioxidants. Whereas
all whole plant foods may have anti-inflammatory effects,57 some plants
are better than others. High-antioxidant fruits and vegetables, such as
berries and greens, have been found to douse systemic inflammation
significantly better than the same number of servings of more common
low-antioxidant fruits and veggies, such as bananas and lettuce.58</p>
<p>The foods we choose make a difference.</p>
<p>ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, the one diagnosis I dreaded giving more than
cancer was Alzheimer’s. It wasn’t just because of the psychological toll
to come for the patient but because of the emotional toll that would be
placed on loved ones. The Alzheimer’s Foundation estimates that fifteen
million friends and family members supply more than fifteen billion
unpaid hours annually caring for loved ones who may not even recognize
them.59</p>
<p>Despite the billions of dollars spent on research, there is still
neither a cure nor an effective treatment for the disease, which
invariably progresses to death. In short, Alzheimer’s is reaching a
state of crisis—emotionally, economically, and even scientifically. Over
the past two decades, more than seventy-three thousand research articles
have been published on the disease. That’s about a hundred papers a day.
Yet very little clinical progress has been made in treating or even
understanding it. And a total cure is likely impossible, given that lost
cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients may never be regained due to
fatally damaged neuronal networks. Dead nerve cells cannot be brought
back to life. Even if drug companies can figure out how to halt the
disease’s progression, for many patients, the damage has already been
done, and the individual’s personality may be forever lost.60</p>
<p>The good news, as a senior scientist at the Center for Alzheimer’s
Research entitled a review article, is that “Alzheimer’s Disease Is
Incurable but Preventable.”61 Diet and lifestyle changes could
potentially prevent millions of cases a year.62 How? There is an
emerging consensus that “what is good for our hearts is also good for
our heads,”63 because clogging of the arteries inside of the brain with
atherosclerotic plaque is thought to play a pivotal role in the
development of Alzheimer’s disease.64 It is not surprising, then, that
the dietary centerpiece of the 2014 “Dietary and Lifestyle Guidelines
for the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease,” published in the journal
Neurobiology of Aging, was: “Vegetables, legumes (beans, peas, and
lentils), fruits, and whole grains should replace meats and dairy
products as primary staples of the diet.”65</p>
<p>Is Alzheimer’s a Vascular Disorder?</p>
<p>In 1901, a woman named Auguste was taken to an insane asylum in
Frankfurt, Germany, by her husband. She was described as a delusional,
forgetful, disoriented woman who “could not carry out her homemaking
duties.”66 She was seen by a Dr. Alzheimer and was to become the subject
of the case that made Alzheimer a household name.</p>
<p>On autopsy, Alzheimer described the plaques and tangles in her brain
that would go on to characterize the disease. But lost in the excitement
of discovering a new disease, a clue may have been overlooked. He wrote,
“Die größeren Hirngefäße sind arteriosklerotisch verändert,” which
translates to “The larger cerebral vessels show arteriosclerotic
change.” He was describing the hardening of arteries inside his
patient’s brain.67</p>
<p>We generally think of atherosclerosis as a condition of the heart,
but it’s been described as “an omnipresent pathology that involves
virtually the entire human organism.”68 You have blood vessels in every
one of your organs, including your brain. The concept of “cardiogenic
dementia,” first proposed in the 1970s, suggested that because the aging
brain is highly sensitive to a lack of oxygen, lack of adequate blood
flow may lead to cognitive decline.69 Today, we have a substantial body
of evidence strongly associating atherosclerotic arteries with
Alzheimer’s disease.70</p>
<p>Autopsies have shown repeatedly that Alzheimer’s patients tend to
have significantly more atherosclerotic plaque buildup and narrowing of
the arteries within the brain.71,72,73 Normal resting cerebral blood
flow—the amount of blood circulating to the brain—is typically about a
quart per minute. Starting in adulthood, people appear to naturally lose
about half a percent of blood flow per year. By age sixty-five, this
circulating capacity could be down by as much as 20 percent.74 While
such a drop alone may not be sufficient to impair brain function, it can
put you close to the edge. The clogging of the arteries inside, and
leading to, the brain with cholesterol-filled plaque can drastically
reduce the amount of blood—and therefore oxygen—your brain receives.
Supporting this theory, autopsies have demonstrated that Alzheimer’s
patients had particularly significant arterial blockage in the arteries
leading to the memory centers of their brains.75 In light of such
findings, some experts have even suggested that Alzheimer’s be
reclassified as a vascular disorder.76</p>
<p>There are limitations to how much we can glean from autopsy studies,
however. For example, perhaps a person’s dementia led to his or her poor
diet rather than vice versa. To further assess the role of clogged brain
arteries in the development of Alzheimer’s, researchers followed about
four hundred people who were just starting to lose their mental
faculties, which is called mild cognitive impairment. Special
brain-artery scans were employed to evaluate the amount of arterial
blockage in each patient’s brain. The researchers found that the
cognition and daily functioning of those with the least narrowing of the
arteries in their heads remained stable over the course of the four-year
study. Meanwhile, subjects with more arterial blockage lost significant
brain function, and those with the worst cases of plaque buildup
declined rapidly, doubling their likelihood of progressing to full-blown
Alzheimer’s. The researchers concluded: “An inefficient blood supply to
the brain has very grave consequences on brain function.”77</p>
<p>A study of three hundred Alzheimer’s patients found that treating
vascular risk factors, such as high cholesterol and blood pressure, may
even slow the progression of the disease but not stop it.78 That’s why
prevention is the key. Cholesterol doesn’t just help generate
atherosclerotic plaques within your brain arteries; it may help seed the
amyloid plaques that riddle the brain tissue of Alzheimer’s victims.79
Cholesterol is a vital component of your cells, which is why your body
makes all that you need. Consuming excess cholesterol, and especially
trans and saturated fats, can raise your blood cholesterol level.80 Too
much cholesterol in your blood is not only considered the primary risk
factor for heart disease81 but is also unanimously recognized as a risk
factor for Alzheimer’s disease.82</p>
<p>Autopsies have revealed that Alzheimer’s brains have significantly
more cholesterol buildup than normal brains.83 We used to think that the
pool of cholesterol in the brain was separate from the cholesterol
circulating in the blood, but there is growing evidence to the
contrary.84 Excess cholesterol in the blood can lead to excess
cholesterol in the brain, which may then help trigger the clumping of
amyloid seen in Alzheimer’s brains. Under an electron microscope, we can
see the clustering of amyloid fibers on and around tiny crystals of
cholesterol.85 And indeed, advanced brain imaging techniques, such as
PET scans, have shown a direct correlation between the amount of LDL
(“bad”) cholesterol in the blood and amyloid buildup in the brain.86
Drug companies have hoped to capitalize on this connection to sell
cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s, but statins
themselves can cause cognitive impairment, including short- and
long-term memory loss.87 For people unwilling to change their diets, the
benefits of statins outweigh the risks,88 but it’s better to lower your
cholesterol levels naturally by eating healthier to help preserve your
heart, brain, and mind.</p>
<p>Genetics or Diet?</p>
<p>This dietary concept may be surprising, because most of the popular
press today treats Alzheimer’s as a genetic disease. They say it’s your
genes, rather than your lifestyle choices, that determine whether or not
you’ll succumb. However, when you examine the distribution of
Alzheimer’s disease around the world, that argument begins to
crumble.</p>
<p>The rates of Alzheimer’s vary tenfold around the world, even taking
into account that some populations live longer than others.89 For
example, in rural Pennsylvania, if you knew one hundred senior citizens,
it is likely that an average of nineteen of them would develop
Alzheimer’s disease within the next decade. However, that number would
probably be closer to just three out of one hundred if you lived in
rural Ballabgarh, in India.90 How do we know some populations aren’t
just more genetically susceptible? Because of migration studies, in
which disease rates within the same ethnic group are compared between
their current locale and their homeland. For example, the Alzheimer’s
rates among Japanese men living in the United States are significantly
higher than those of Japanese men living in Japan.91 The Alzheimer’s
rates among Africans in Nigeria are up to four times lower than those of
African Americans in Indianapolis.92</p>
<p>Why does living in the United States increase dementia risk?</p>
<p>The balance of evidence suggests that the answer lies in the American
diet. Of course, in our new global world, you don’t have to move to the
West to adopt a Western diet. In Japan, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s
has shot up over the past few decades, thought to be due to the shift
from a traditional rice-and-vegetable-based diet to one featuring triple
the dairy and six times the meat. The closest correlation researchers
found between diet and dementia was animal fat consumption; animal fat
intake shot up nearly 600 percent between 1961 and 2008.93 A similar
trend linking diet and dementia was found in China.94 With diets
Westernizing globally, Alzheimer’s rates are expected to continue to
increase, writes one researcher in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease,
“unless dietary patterns change to those with less reliance on animal
products.…”95</p>
<p>The lowest validated rates of Alzheimer’s disease in the world are
found in rural India,96 where people eat traditional, plant-based diets
centered on grains and vegetables.97 In the United States, those who
don’t eat meat (including poultry and fish) appear to cut their risk of
developing dementia in half. And the longer meat is avoided, the lower
dementia risk may fall. Compared to those eating meat more than four
times a week, those who have eaten vegetarian diets for thirty years or
more had three times lower risk of becoming demented.98</p>
<p>Surely genetic factors play some part? They do. Back in the 1990s,
scientists discovered a gene variant called apolipoprotein E4, or ApoE4,
that makes you more susceptible to getting Alzheimer’s. Everyone has
some form of ApoE, but about one in seven people have a copy of the E4
gene that is linked to the disease. It’s been shown that if you inherit
one ApoE4 gene from your mother or father, your risk of getting
Alzheimer’s may triple. If you get the ApoE4 gene from both
parents—which about one in fifty people do—you might end up with nine
times the risk.99</p>
<p>What does the ApoE gene do? It makes the protein that’s the principal
cholesterol carrier in the brain.100 The E4 variant may lead to an
abnormal accumulation of cholesterol within brain cells, which could
trigger Alzheimer’s pathology.101 This mechanism may explain the
so-called Nigerian paradox. The highest frequency of the ApoE4 variant
occurs in Nigerians,102 who surprisingly also have some of the lowest
rates of Alzheimer’s.103 Wait a second. The population with the highest
rate of the “Alzheimer’s gene” has one of the lowest rates of
Alzheimer’s disease? This contradiction may be explained by Nigerians’
extremely low blood-cholesterol levels, thanks to a diet low in animal
fat104 and consisting mainly of grains and vegetables.105 So, it seems,
diet can trump genetics.</p>
<p>Consider that in one study of a thousand people over a period of two
decades, the presence of the ApoE4 gene, unsurprisingly, was found to
more than double the odds of Alzheimer’s. But in those same subjects,
high blood cholesterol was found to nearly triple the odds. The
researchers suspect that controlling such risk factors as high blood
pressure and cholesterol could substantially reduce the risk of
Alzheimer’s, dropping the odds from up around ninefold with the dreaded,
double-barreled ApoE4 down to just twice the risk.106</p>
<p>Too often, doctors and patients have a fatalistic approach to chronic
degenerative diseases, and Alzheimer’s is no exception.107 “It’s all in
your genes,” they say, “and what will happen will happen.” Research
shows that although you might have been dealt some poor genetic cards,
you may be able to reshuffle the deck with diet.</p>
<p>Preventing Alzheimer’s with Plant Foods</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s manifests as a disease of the elderly, but like heart
disease and most cancers, it’s a disease that may take decades to
develop. At the risk of sounding like a broken record (or should I say
an MP3 glitch?), it’s never too early to start eating healthier. Dietary
decisions you make now may directly influence your health much later in
life, including the health of your brain.</p>
<p>Most Alzheimer’s sufferers aren’t diagnosed until they’re in their
seventies,108 but we now know that their brains began deteriorating long
before that. Based on thousands of autopsies, pathologists seemed to
detect the first silent stages of Alzheimer’s disease—what appear to be
tangles in the brain—in half of people by age fifty and even 10 percent
of those in their twenties.109 The good news is that the clinical
manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease—like heart disease, lung disease,
and stroke—may be preventable.</p>
<p>Plant-based diets are recommended in Alzheimer’s prevention
guidelines because of which foods they tend to accentuate and which they
tend to reduce.110 The Mediterranean diet, for example, which is higher
in vegetables, beans, fruits, and nuts, and lower in meats and dairy
products, has been associated with slower cognitive decline and lower
risk of Alzheimer’s.111 When researchers tried to tease out the
protective components, the critical ingredients appeared to be the
diet’s high vegetable content and lower ratio of saturated to
unsaturated fats.112 This conclusion aligns with that of the Harvard
Women’s Health Study, which found that higher saturated fat intake
(sourced predominantly from dairy, meat, and processed foods) was
associated with a significantly worse trajectory of cognition and
memory. Women with the highest saturated fat intake had a 60–70 percent
greater chance of cognitive deterioration over time. Women with the
lowest saturated fat intake had the brain function, on average, of women
six years younger.113</p>
<p>The benefits of a plant-based diet may also be due to the plants
themselves. Whole plant foods contain thousands of compounds with
antioxidant properties,114 some of which can traverse the blood-brain
barrier and may provide neuroprotective effects115 by defending against
free radicals (see here)—that is, protecting against the “rusting” of
the brain. Your brain is only about 2 percent of your body weight but
may consume up to 50 percent of the oxygen you breathe, potentially
releasing a firestorm of free radicals.116 Special antioxidant pigments
in berries117 and dark-green leafies118 may make them the brain foods of
the fruit and vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p>The first human study to show that blueberries improve memory
abilities in older adults exhibiting early cognitive deterioration was
published in 2010.119 Then, in 2012, Harvard University researchers
actually quantified these findings by using data from the Nurses’ Health
Study, in which the diets and health of sixteen thousand women were
followed starting in 1980. They found that women who consumed at least
one serving of blueberries and two servings of strawberries each week
had slower rates of cognitive decline—by as much as two and a half
years—compared with those who didn’t eat berries. These results suggest
that simply eating a handful of berries every day, one easy and
delicious dietary tweak, may slow your brain’s aging by more than two
years.120</p>
<p>Even just drinking fruit and vegetable juices may be beneficial. A
study that followed nearly two thousand people for about eight years
found that people who drank fruit and vegetable juices regularly
appeared to have a 76 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s
disease. “Fruit and vegetable juices may play an important role in
delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease,” the researchers concluded,
“particularly among those who are at high risk for the disease.”121</p>
<p>The researchers suspect the active ingredient may be a class of
powerful brain-accessing antioxidants called polyphenols. If that’s the
case, Concord (purple) grape juice may be the best choice,122 although
whole fruits are generally preferable to juices.123 Concord grapes
aren’t always in season, though, so look for cranberries, which are also
packed with polyphenols124 and can typically be found frozen year-round.
(Later in this book, I offer my Pink Juice recipe for a whole-food
cranberry cocktail with twenty-five times fewer calories and at least
eight times the phytonutrient content of store-bought cranberry “juice.”
See here.)</p>
<p>Beyond their antioxidant activity, polyphenols have been shown to
protect nerve cells in vitro by inhibiting the formation of the
plaques125and tangles126 that characterize Alzheimer’s brain pathology.
In theory, they could also “pull out”127 metals that accumulate in
certain brain areas and may play a role in the development of
Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.128 Polyphenols are one
of the reasons I make specific recommendations for berries and green tea
in part 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>Treating Alzheimer’s with Saffron</p>
<p>Despite the billions poured into Alzheimer’s research, there is no
effective treatment to reverse the progression of the disease. There are
medications that can help manage the symptoms, though, and so can
something found right in your grocery store.</p>
<p>Although some remarkable benefits have been reported in anecdotal
case studies with the spice turmeric,129 the best data we have on
spice-based interventions for Alzheimer’s is for saffron. A spice
derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, saffron was found in a
double-blind trial to help diminish the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
In a sixteen-week study, Alzheimer’s patients with mild to moderate
dementia who took saffron capsules displayed significantly better
cognitive function on average than a group of patients who took a
placebo.130</p>
<p>How about putting saffron head-to-head against one of the most
popular Alzheimer’s drugs on the market: donepezil (commonly marketed
under the brand name Aricept)? A twenty-two-week double-blind study
(meaning that neither the researchers nor the subjects knew who was on
the drug and who was on the spice until the study’s conclusion) found
that saffron appears just as effective at treating Alzheimer’s symptoms
as the leading drug.131 Unfortunately, working just as well as
medication isn’t saying much,132 but at least a person doesn’t have to
risk the drug’s side effects, most typically nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea.133</p>
<p>While there is no proven way to halt the progression of Alzheimer’s,
if you do know anyone suffering from the disease, regularly cooking him
or her saffron-spiced paella may help.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gerontotoxins</p>
<p>Each of us contains tens of billions of miles of DNA—enough for one
hundred thousand round trips to the moon if you uncoiled each strand and
placed them end to end.134 How do our bodies keep it from all getting
tangled up? Enzymes known as sirtuins keep our DNA wrapped up nice and
neat around spool-like proteins.</p>
<p>Although they were only discovered recently, sirtuins represent one
of the most promising areas of medicine, as they appear to be involved
in promoting healthy aging and longevity.135 Autopsy studies show the
loss of sirtuin activity is closely associated with the hallmarks of
Alzheimer’s disease—namely, the accumulation of plaques and tangles in
the brain.136 Suppression of this key host defense is considered a
central feature of Alzheimer’s.137 The pharmaceutical industry is trying
to come up with drugs to increase sirtuin activity, but why not just
prevent its suppression in the first place? You may be able to do this
by reducing your dietary exposure to advanced glycation end products, or
AGEs.138</p>
<p>AGE is an appropriate acronym, as they are considered
“gerontotoxins,”139 meaning aging toxins (from the Greek geros, meaning
“old age,” as in “geriatric”). AGEs are thought to accelerate the aging
process by cross-linking proteins together, causing tissue stiffness,
oxidative stress, and inflammation. This process may play a role in
cataract formation and macular degeneration in the eye, as well as
damage to the bones, heart, kidneys, and liver.140 They may also impact
the brain, appearing to accelerate the slow shrinkage of your brain as
you age141 and suppressing your sirtuin defenses.142</p>
<p>Older adults with high levels of AGEs in their blood143 or urine144
appear to suffer an accelerated loss of cognitive function over time.
Elevated levels of AGEs are also found in the brains of Alzheimer’s
victims.145 Where are these AGEs coming from? Some are produced and
detoxified naturally in your body,146 but other than cigarette smoke,147
major sources are “meat and meat-derived products” exposed to dry-heat
cooking methods.148 AGEs are formed primarily when fat- and protein-rich
foods are exposed to high temperatures.149</p>
<p>More than five hundred foods have been tested for AGE content,
everything from Big Macs and Hot Pockets to coffee and Jell-O. In
general, meat, cheese, and highly processed foods had the highest AGE
content, and grains, beans, breads, vegetables, fruits, and milk had the
least.150</p>
<p>The top-twenty most AGE-contaminated products per serving tested were
various brands of:</p>
<hr />
<ol type="1">
<li><p>BBQ chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Bacon</p></li>
<li><p>Broiled hot dog</p></li>
<li><p>Roasted chicken thigh</p></li>
<li><p>Roasted chicken leg</p></li>
<li><p>Pan-fried steak</p></li>
<li><p>Oven-fried chicken breast</p></li>
<li><p>Deep-fried chicken breast</p></li>
<li><p>Stir-fried steak strips</p></li>
<li><p>McDonald’s Chicken Selects breast strips</p></li>
<li><p>Pan-fried turkey burger</p></li>
<li><p>BBQ chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Oven-fried fish</p></li>
<li><p>McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets</p></li>
<li><p>Broiled chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Pan-fried turkey burger</p></li>
<li><p>Baked chicken</p></li>
<li><p>Pan-fried turkey burger</p></li>
<li><p>Boiled hot dog</p></li>
<li><p>Broiled steak151</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Yes, cooking methods matter. A baked apple has three times more AGEs
than a raw apple, and a broiled hot dog has more than a boiled hot dog.
But the source is what matters most: a baked apple has 45 units of AGEs
compared to a raw apple’s 13 units, while a broiled hot dog has 10,143
units compared to a boiled hot dog’s 6,736. The researchers recommend
cooking meat using moist-heat cooking methods, such as steaming or
stewing, but even boiled fish has more than 10 times more AGEs than a
sweet potato roasted for an hour. Meat averages about 20 times more AGEs
than highly processed foods like breakfast cereals and about 150 times
more than fresh fruits and vegetables. Poultry was the worst, containing
about 20 percent more AGEs than beef. The researchers concluded that
even a modest reduction in meat intake could realistically cut daily AGE
intake in half.152</p>
<p>Because sirtuin suppression is both preventable and reversible by AGE
reduction, avoiding high-AGE foods is seen as potentially offering a new
strategy to combat the Alzheimer’s epidemic.153</p>
<hr />
<p>Halting Cognitive Decline with Exercise?</p>
<p>There is exciting news for people on the verge of losing their mental
faculties. In a 2010 study published in the Archives of Neurology,
researchers took a group of people with mild cognitive impairment—those
who are starting to forget things, for example, or regularly repeating
themselves—and had them engage in aerobic exercise for forty-five to
sixty minutes a day, four days a week, for six months. The control group
was instructed to simply stretch for the same time periods.154</p>
<p>Memory tests were performed before and after the study. Researchers
found that in the control (stretching) group, cognitive function
continued to decline. But the exercising group not only didn’t get
worse, they got better. The exercisers got more test answers correct
after six months, indicating their memory had improved.155</p>
<p>Subsequent studies using MRI scans found that aerobic exercise can
actually reverse age-related shrinkage in the memory centers of the
brain.156 No such effect was found in the stretching and toning control
groups or a nonaerobic strength-training group.157 Aerobic exercise can
help improve cerebral blood flow, improve memory performance, and help
preserve brain tissue.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let’s face it: A life without memories is not much of a life. Whether
those memories are lost all at once from a massive stroke, chipped away
by ministrokes that leave little holes in the brain, or destroyed from
within by degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, eating and living
healthier can help eliminate some of the worst risk factors for the most
serious brain diseases.</p>
<p>But the key is starting early. High cholesterol and high blood
pressure may begin hurting your brain as early as your twenties. By your
sixties and seventies, when the damage can become apparent, it may
already be too late.</p>
<p>Like so many other organs, the brain possesses a miraculous ability
to heal itself, to forge new synaptic connections around old ones, to
learn and relearn. That is, however, if you don’t keep damaging it three
times a day. A wholesome diet and exercise may offer your best hope for
remaining sharp and healthy into your twilight years.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can conclude this chapter on a happier note than how it
began. Despite our family history, both my mom and my brother, Gene, now
eat a healthy, plant-based diet, and my mom shows no signs of succumbing
to the same fate of brain disease that claimed the lives of her parents.
Although Gene and I know that one day we’ll eventually lose her, given
her new healthy diet, our hope is that we won’t lose our mom before she
is gone.</p>
