<h4 id="chapter-9-how-not-to-die-from-blood-cancers">CHAPTER 9 How Not
to Die from Blood Cancers</h4>
<p>Eleven-year-old Missy had leukemia. It was in remission, thanks in
part to the yellow bags of chemo that hung from the IV pole she rolled
down the hospital halls. Missy was one of my first patients in my
pediatrics rotation during medical school at the Eastern Maine Medical
Center in Bangor—home to Stephen King, moose-crossing signs, and
billboards advertising lobster ice cream.</p>
<p>During this time, I was in full Patch Adams regalia, from the fuzzy
pink rabbit ears on my head down to the plastic rainbow Slinkys trailing
at my feet. On every button of my white doctor’s coat hung a Beanie
Baby, in every buttonhole was crammed a stuffed animal’s foot. Missy
drew a smiley face on my beanie hippo and named the rooster attached to
my stethoscope “Elvis.”</p>
<p>She loved to paint pictures for me and signed each one of them, in
all caps: FROM MISSY. In these pictures, she still had her curly brown
locks. In reality, though, her head was completely bald. She refused to
wear a wig, which only made her smile seem brighter.</p>
<p>I painted her nails a pale pink, and she painted mine a lovely
purplish brown.</p>
<p>I remember the morning after she gave me the manicure. My senior
resident took me aside after rounds. “Your fingernails are getting in
people’s way,” he said.</p>
<p>“Huh?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The attending physicians are complaining,” he replied. “This is a
conservative profession.”</p>
<p>I tried to explain that I didn’t paint them myself, upset that I even
felt the need to explain at all. The senior resident knew that Missy had
done it, but he didn’t seem to care. “Medicine,” he said, “is also an
anti-emotion profession.”</p>
<p>Later, the chair of the department had a talk with me. A number of
the attending physicians were concerned I was “too enthusiastic,” “too
dramatic,” and “too sensitive.”</p>
<p>My wife remarked they probably just had Slinky envy.</p>
<p>The next day, head down, I walked into Missy’s room.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I told her. “The doctors made me take off the nail
polish.”</p>
<p>I held up my hands to show her. She inspected them and said, with
great indignation, “If you can’t wear it, then I’m not going to,
either!” So I helped her take off her polish, bemused and empowered by
such solidarity from an eleven-year-old. (I let her paint my toenails
instead.)</p>
<p>I remember the last note I wrote in Missy’s medical chart. Hospital
progress notes are written in SOAP format, a mnemonic for Subjective
findings, Objective findings, Assessment, and Plan. I wrote:
“Assessment: 11yo girl finishing last round of maintenance chemotherapy.
Plan: Disney World.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Childhood leukemia is one of the few success stories in our war on
cancer, with ten-year survival rates as high as 90 percent.1 Yet it
still affects more children than any other cancer and is ten times more
likely to be diagnosed in adults, among whom current treatments are much
less effective.2</p>
<p>What can we do to help prevent blood cancers in the first place?</p>
<p>Blood cancers are sometimes referred to as liquid tumors, since the
cancer cells often circulate throughout the body rather than get
concentrated in a solid mass. These cancers typically begin undetected
in the bone marrow, that spongy tissue in the interior of our bones
where red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are born. When
healthy, your red blood cells deliver oxygen throughout your body, your
white blood cells fight off infections, and your platelets help your
blood to clot. Most blood cancers involve mutations of the white
cells.</p>
<p>Blood cancers can be categorized into three types: leukemia,
lymphoma, and myeloma. Leukemia (from the Greek roots leukos, or
“white,” and haima, or “blood”) is a disease in which the bone marrow
feverishly produces abnormal white blood cells. Unlike normal ones,
these imposters aren’t able to fight infection. They also impair the
ability of your bone marrow to produce normal red and white cells by
crowding out healthy ones, creating a diminished healthy blood cell
count that can lead to anemia, infection, and, eventually, death.
According to the American Cancer Society, fifty-two thousand Americans
are diagnosed with leukemia, and twenty-four thousand die from it every
year.3</p>
<p>Lymphoma is a blood cancer of lymphocytes, which are specialized
types of white blood cells. Lymphoma cells multiply quickly and can
collect in your lymph nodes, small immune organs that are spread
throughout the body, including the armpits, neck, and groin. Lymph nodes
help to filter your blood. Like leukemia, lymphoma can crowd out healthy
cells and impair your ability to fight infections. You may have heard of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Hodgkin’s lymphoma can strike young adults, but
it’s a rare and usually treatable form of lymphoma. As its name
suggests, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) includes all the other dozens of
types of lymphoma. They’re more common and can be harder to treat, and
their risk increases with age. The American Cancer Society estimates
that there are seventy thousand new cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma each
year and about nineteen thousand deaths.4</p>
<p>Finally, myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are white blood
cells that produce antibodies, the proteins that stick to invaders and
infected cells to neutralize or tag them for destruction. Cancerous
plasma cells can displace healthy cells from your bone marrow and make
abnormal antibodies that can clog the kidneys. About 90 percent of
myeloma sufferers are discovered with masses of cancer cells growing in
multiple bones of their bodies, hence the common term for this
condition, multiple myeloma. Each year, twenty-four thousand people are
diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and eleven thousand die.5</p>
<p>Most people with multiple myeloma live for only a few years after
diagnosis. Though treatable, multiple myeloma is considered incurable.
That’s why prevention is key. Fortunately, dietary changes may reduce
our risk of all these blood cancers.</p>
<p>FOODS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RISK OF BLOOD CANCERS</p>
<p>After following more than sixty thousand people for more than a dozen
years, University of Oxford researchers found that those who consume a
plant-based diet are less likely to develop all forms of cancer
combined. The greatest protection appeared to be against blood cancers.
The incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma among those
eating vegetarian diets is nearly half that of those eating meat.6 Why
is this greatly reduced risk of blood cancers associated with a more
plant-based diet? The British Journal of Cancer concluded, “More
research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this.”7 While
they are figuring out the reasons, why not get a head start and try
adding more healthy plant foods to your plates today?</p>
<p>Greens and Cancer</p>
<p>The key to cancer prevention and treatment is to keep tumor cells
from multiplying out of control while allowing healthy cells to grow
normally. Chemotherapy and radiation can do a great job of wiping out
cancer cells, but healthy cells can get caught in the crossfire. Some
compounds in plants, though, may be more discriminating.</p>
<p>For instance, sulforaphane, considered one of the more active
components in cruciferous vegetables, kills human leukemia cells in a
petri dish while having little impact on the growth of normal cells.8 As
we’ve discussed, cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cauliflower,
and kale, but there are many others in this family, such as collard
greens, watercress, bok choy, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips, arugula,
radishes (including horseradish), wasabi, and all types of cabbage.</p>
<p>It’s intriguing that dripping cabbage compounds on cancer cells
affects them in a laboratory, but what really matters is whether people
with blood cancers who eat lots of vegetables actually live longer than
those who don’t. For about eight years, Yale University researchers
followed more than five hundred women with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Those
who started out eating three or more servings of vegetables daily had a
42 percent improved survival rate over those who ate less. Green, leafy
vegetables, including salad and cooked greens, and citrus fruits
appeared most protective.9 It’s not clear, though, whether the survival
benefit arose from helping to keep the cancer at bay or from improving
patients’ tolerance to the chemotherapy and radiation treatments they
were receiving. The accompanying editorial in the journal Leukemia
andandandand Lymphoma suggested that a “lymphoma diagnosis may be an
important ‘teachable’ moment to improve diet.…”10 I would suggest you
not wait until a cancer diagnosis to clean up your diet.</p>
<p>The Iowa Women’s Health Study, which has followed more than
thirty-five thousand women for decades, found that higher broccoli and
other cruciferous vegetable intake was associated with lower risk of
getting non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the first place.11 Likewise, a study
at the Mayo Clinic found that those who ate about five or more servings
of green, leafy vegetables a week had roughly half the odds of getting
lymphoma compared with those who ate less than one serving a week.12</p>
<p>Some of the plant-based protection might have been due to the
antioxidant properties of fruits and vegetables. Higher dietary intake
of antioxidants is associated with significantly lower lymphoma risk.
Note I said dietary intake, not supplementary intake. Antioxidant
supplements don’t appear to work.13 For example, getting lots of vitamin
C in your diet is associated with lower lymphoma risk, but taking in
even more vitamin C in pill form did not seem to help. The same was
found for carotenoid antioxidants like beta-carotene.14 Apparently,
pills do not have the same cancer-fighting effects as produce.</p>
<p>When it comes to certain other cancers, like those of the digestive
tract, antioxidant supplements may even make things worse. Combinations
of antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin E, and beta-carotene in pill
form were associated with increased risk of death in those who took
them.15 Supplements contain only a select few antioxidants, whereas your
body relies on hundreds of them, all working synergistically to create a
network to help the body dispose of free radicals. High doses of a
single antioxidant may upset this delicate balance and may actually
diminish your body’s ability to fight cancer.16</p>
<p>When you buy antioxidant supplements, you may be doling out money to
live a shorter life. Save your cash and your health by eating the real
thing: food.</p>
<p>Açai Berries and Leukemia</p>
<p>Açai berries gained celebrity status in 2008 when television
personality Dr. Mehmet Oz talked about them on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
This spawned a frenzy of knockoff supplements, powders, shakes, and
other dubious products bearing the açai berry label but not necessarily
containing any of the actual berry.17 Even major corporations have
jumped on the açai bandwagon, including Anheuser-Busch with its 180 Blue
“with Açai Energy” drink and Coca-Cola with its Bossa Nova beverage.
This is an all-too-common practice in the “superfruit” supplement and
beverage market, where less than a quarter of products sold may even
contain the ingredients their labels claim.18,19 The benefits of these
products are suspect at best, but there is some preliminary research on
real açai berries, which can be purchased as unsweetened frozen
pulp.</p>
<p>The first study published in the medical literature on the effects of
açai on human tissue was performed on leukemia cells. Researchers
dripped an açai berry extract on leukemia cells taken from a
thirty-six-year-old woman. It appeared to trigger self-destruct
reactions in up to 86 percent of the cells.20 Also, sprinkling some
freeze-dried açai berries on immune cells called macrophages (from the
Greek words makros and phagein, meaning “big eater”) in a petri dish
appeared to enable the cells to engulf and devour up to 40 percent more
microbes than usual.21</p>
<p>Though the leukemia study was done using açai extract at the
concentration one might expect to find in the bloodstream after eating
the berries, no studies have yet been performed on cancer patients
themselves (just cancer cells in a test tube), so more testing is
needed. Indeed, the only clinical studies on açai berries published so
far were two small industry-funded trials that showed modest benefit for
osteoarthritis sufferers22 and some metabolic parameters of overweight
subjects.23</p>
<p>In terms of antioxidant bang for your buck, açai berries get
honorable mention, beating out other superstars, such as walnuts,
apples, and cranberries. The bronze for best bargain, though, goes to
cloves, the silver to cinnamon, and the gold for most antioxidants per
dollar—according to a USDA database of common foods—goes to purple
cabbage.24 Açai berries, however, would probably make a tastier
smoothie.</p>
<p>Curcumin and Multiple Myeloma</p>
<p>As noted, multiple myeloma is one of the most dreaded cancers. It is
practically incurable even with aggressive medical treatment. As myeloma
cells take over the bone marrow, healthy white blood cells continue to
decline in number, which increases your susceptibility to infection.
Reduced levels of red blood cells can lead to anemia, and reduced
platelet counts can lead to serious bleeding. Once diagnosed, most
people survive fewer than five years.25</p>
<p>Multiple myeloma does not occur out of the blue. It appears to be
nearly always preceded by a precancerous condition known as monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance, or MGUS.26 When scientists
first discovered MGUS, it was aptly named because, at that time, the
significance of finding elevated levels of abnormal antibodies in
someone’s body was unclear. We now know it’s a precursor to multiple
myeloma, and about 3 percent of Caucasians over age fifty have it,27
while the rate among African Americans may be double.28</p>
<p>MGUS causes no symptoms. You won’t even know you have it unless your
doctor finds it incidentally during routine blood work. The chance of
MGUS progressing into myeloma is about 1 percent per year, which means
many MGUS-stricken people may die of other causes before they develop
myeloma.29 However, since multiple myeloma is basically a death
sentence, scientists have been desperate to find ways to stop MGUS in
its tracks.</p>
<p>Given the safety and efficacy of the turmeric spice component
curcumin against other types of cancer cells, researchers from the
University of Texas collected multiple myeloma cells and put them in a
petri dish. Without any intervention, the cancer cells quadrupled within
a few days—that’s how fast this cancer can grow. But when a little
curcumin was added to the broth they were bathing in, the myeloma cells’
growth was either stunted or stopped altogether.30</p>
<p>As we’ve discovered, stopping cancer in a laboratory is one thing.
What about in people? In 2009, a pilot study found that half (five out
of ten) of the subjects with MGUS who had particularly high abnormal
antibody levels responded positively to curcumin supplements. None (zero
out of nine) of those given a placebo experienced a similar drop in
antibody levels.31 Buoyed by this success, scientists conducted a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and achieved
similarly encouraging results in both patients with MGUS and those with
“smoldering” multiple myeloma, an early stage of the disease.32 This
result suggests that a simple spice found in the grocery store might
have the ability to slow or stop this horrific cancer in a certain
percentage of patients, though we won’t know more until longer studies
are performed to see if these hopeful changes in blood-work biomarkers
translate into changes in actual patient outcomes. In the meantime, it
couldn’t hurt to spice up your diet.</p>
<p>ARE ANIMAL VIRUSES INVOLVED IN HUMAN BLOOD CANCERS?</p>
<p>The reason people eating plant-based diets appear to have much lower
rates of blood cancers33 may be due to the foods they’re choosing to eat
and/or choosing to avoid. To tease out the role different animal
products might play in the myriad blood cancers, we would need to
conduct a very large study. Enter the aptly named EPIC study, the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which did
just that. As we saw in chapter 4, researchers recruited more than four
hundred thousand men and women across ten countries and followed them
for about nine years. If you recall, regular chicken consumption was
associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Similar
findings were found for blood cancers. Of all the animal products
studied (including unusual categories, such as offal, or entrails and
organs), poultry tended to be associated with the greatest increased
risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, all grades of follicular lymphoma, and
B-cell lymphomas, such as B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (including
small lymphocytic leukemia and prolymphocytic lymphocytic leukemia).34
The EPIC study found that risk increased between 56 percent and 280
percent for every 50 grams of poultry consumed daily. For comparison, a
cooked, boneless chicken breast may weigh as much as 384 grams.35</p>
<p>Why is there so much lymphoma and leukemia risk associated with
eating such relatively small amounts of poultry? The researchers
suggested this result could be a fluke, or it could be due to the drugs,
such as antibiotics, that are often fed to chickens and turkeys to
promote their growth. Or it might be the dioxins found in some poultry
meat, which have been linked to lymphoma.36 But dairy can also contain
dioxins, and milk consumption was not linked to NHL. The researchers
surmised it may be the cancer-causing viruses in poultry, given that
lower risk of NHL has been associated with eating meat cooked well done
instead of rare (thereby inactivating any viruses).37 This suggestion is
consistent with the results of the NIH-AARP study (see here), which
found an association between eating just-done chicken and one type of
lymphoma and lower risk of another blood cancer tied to greater exposure
to the cooked meat carcinogen MeIQx.38</p>
<p>How could less cancer be linked to more carcinogen exposure? MeIQx is
one of the heterocyclic amines created by cooking meat at high
temperatures, such as baking, broiling, and frying.39 If, in the case of
blood cancers, one cause is a poultry virus, then the more the meat was
cooked, the more likely it is that the virus was destroyed.
Cancer-causing poultry viruses—including the avian herpesvirus that
causes Marek’s disease, several retroviruses like reticuloendotheliosis
virus, the avian leukosis virus found in chickens, and the
lymphoproliferative disease virus found in turkeys—may explain the
higher rates of blood cancers among farmers,40 slaughterhouse workers,41
and butchers.42 Viruses can cause cancer by directly inserting a
cancer-causing gene into a host’s DNA.43</p>
<p>Animal viruses can infect people who prepare meat with unpleasant
skin diseases, such as contagious pustular dermatitis.44 There’s even a
well-defined medical condition commonly known as “butchers’ warts” that
affects the hands of those who handle fresh meat, including poultry and
fish.45 Even the wives of butchers appear to be at higher risk for
cervical cancer, a cancer definitively associated with wart-virus
exposure.46</p>
<p>Workers in poultry slaughterhouses have been found to have higher
rates of cancers of the mouth, nasal cavities, throat, esophagus,
rectum, liver, and blood. On a public health level, the concern here is
that the cancer-causing viruses present in poultry and poultry products
may then be transmitted to those in the general population who handle or
eat inadequately cooked chicken.47 These results were replicated
recently in the largest such investigation to date, studying more than
twenty thousand workers in poultry slaughtering and processing plants.
They confirmed the findings of three other studies to date: Workers in
these facilities do have increased risk of dying from certain cancers,
including cancers of the blood.48</p>
<p>Researchers are finally starting to connect the dots. The high levels
of antibodies to avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses49 and to
reticuloendotheliosis viruses50 recently found in poultry workers
provide evidence of human exposure to these cancer-causing poultry
viruses. Even line workers who simply cut up the finished product and
weren’t ever exposed to live birds had elevated levels of antibodies in
their blood.51 Beyond just occupational safety, the potential threat to
the public, the researchers concluded, “is not trivial.”52</p>
<p>Elevated blood cancer rates can even be traced back to the farm. An
analysis of more than one hundred thousand death certificates found that
those who grew up on a farm raising animals appeared significantly more
likely to develop a blood cancer later in life, whereas growing up on a
farm growing only crops was not. Worst was growing up on a poultry farm,
which was associated with nearly three times the odds of developing
blood cancer.53</p>
<p>Exposure to cattle and pigs has also been associated with
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.54 A 2003 study by University of California
researchers revealed that nearly three-quarters of human subjects tested
positive for exposure to the bovine leukemia virus, likely through the
consumption of meat and dairy products.55 Approximately 85 percent of
U.S. dairy herds have tested positive for the virus (and 100 percent on
industrial-scale operations).56</p>
<p>However, just because people are exposed to a virus that causes
cancer in cows does not mean that humans themselves can become actively
infected with it. In 2014, researchers supported in part by the U.S.
Army Breast Cancer Research Program published a remarkable report in a
journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They reported
that the bovine leukemia virus DNA was found to be incorporated into
normal and cancerous human breast tissue, effectively proving that
people can also become infected with this cancer-causing animal virus.57
To date, however, the role poultry and other farm animal viruses play in
the development of human cancers remains unknown.</p>
<p>What about the feline leukemia virus? Thankfully, pet companionship
is associated with lower rates of lymphoma, which is a personal relief
given how many animals I’ve shared my life with. And the longer people
have had cats or dogs in their lives, the lower their risk. In one
study, the lowest risk of lymphoma was found in people who had had pets
for twenty years or longer. The researchers suspect the reason is
connected to the fact that having pets may have beneficial effects on
the immune system.58</p>
<hr />
<p>A pair of Harvard University studies suggested that diet soda
consumption may increase the risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple
myeloma,59 but this association was only seen among men and was not
confirmed in two other large studies on aspartame-sweetened soda.60,61

public exposure.</p>
