<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>My friend Art was one of those guys you just wanted to be around.
Successful, generous, kind, and hilarious, he was more than the public
face of the natural foods business empire that he had started. He truly
walked the walk, or rather, ran the run. An avid snowboarder and
mountain biker, Art ate a whole-food, plant-based diet for more than two
decades. He was one of the healthiest guys I ever met.</p>
<p>He died while I was writing this book.</p>
<p>At just forty-six years old, he was found dead in the shower of a
health retreat he owned. My heart couldn’t deal with the grief of losing
my friend, so my head took over, my mind spinning with possible causes
of his death. I thought that if I could figure out what had happened, I
could give his family some closure.</p>
<p>I considered all the rare congenital heart disorders that can cause
sudden death in young athletes. Maybe it was Brugada syndrome? I
remembered there was a case of a marathon runner who had collapsed due
to this rare genetic disorder,1 which can be triggered by heat.2 I
looked it up, and indeed, there was a previous case tied to a hot bath,3
so it seemed plausible that this was what took Art’s life.</p>
<p>The heat of the water was indeed the reason he’d died, but not in the
way I had suspected. The sheriff called later that week to inform us
that others had collapsed in the very same shower. These victims were
medevaced to a nearby hospital and, thankfully, they survived.</p>
<p>It turned out that Art had died of carbon monoxide poisoning. A newly
installed hot-water heater must not have been vented properly. It was an
unbearable tragedy. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him.</p>
<p>Art’s passing made me realize that no matter how well we eat or how
well we live, we can always get hit by a bus—metaphorically or
literally. We need to make sure to look both ways in life and before
crossing the street. We need to take care of ourselves. We need to wear
seat belts and bike helmets and practice safer sex. (After all, practice
makes perfect!)</p>
<p>And we need to make each day count by filling it with fresh air,
laughter, and love—love for ourselves, for others, and for whatever we
are doing with our one precious life. That’s what Art taught me.</p>
<p>In Pursuit of Pleasure</p>
<p>The idea of preventive health is that you do something now so that
nothing bad happens later. You floss your teeth not because it makes you
feel better but because, by doing so, one day you won’t feel worse. You
could consider the healthy habits described in this book to be
preventive—you eat a healthier diet now to avoid disease later.</p>
<p>A healthy diet, however, does more than that.</p>
<p>The food industries bank their billions by manipulating the pleasure
centers within your brain, the so-called dopamine reward system.
Dopamine is the neurotransmitter the brain evolved to reward you for
good behavior, helping to motivate your drive for things like food,
water, and sex—all necessary for the perpetuation of our species. This
natural response has been and continues to be perverted for profit.</p>
<p>The food industry, like the tobacco companies and other drug lords,
has been able to come up with products that tap into the same dopamine
reward system that keeps people smoking cigarettes and snorting cocaine.
People have chewed coca leaves for at least eight thousand years without
any evidence of addiction,4 but a problem arises when certain components
are isolated and concentrated into cocaine—when the coca leaves are
processed. The same may be true for sugar. After all, few people binge
on bananas. The isolation of sugar from the whole food may be the reason
you’re more likely to supersize soda than sweet potatoes or why you’re
unlikely to eat too much corn on the cob but can’t seem to get enough
high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened foods has often been compared
to drug addiction. Until very recently, this parallel was based more on
anecdotal evidence than on solid scientific grounds. But now we have PET
scans, imaging technology that allows doctors to measure brain activity
in real time. It all started with a study that showed decreased dopamine
sensitivity in obese individuals. The more the individual being studied
weighed, the less responsive to dopamine he or she appeared to be.5 We
see the same reduction in sensitivity in cocaine addicts and
alcoholics.6 The brain gets so overstimulated that it ends up trying to
turn down the volume.</p>
<p>It was healthy and adaptive for our primate brains to drive us to eat
that banana when there wasn’t much food around, but now that fruit is
available in fruit loop form, this evolutionary adaptation has become a
liability.7 The original Coca-Cola formulation actually included coca
leaf, but now, perhaps, its sugar content may be the addictive
stand-in.</p>
<p>The brain responds similarly to fat. Within thirty minutes of being
fed yogurt packed with butterfat, research subjects exhibited similar
brain activity8 to those who drank straight sugar water.9 People who
regularly eat ice cream (sugar and fat) have a deadened dopamine
response in their brains when drinking a milkshake. It’s comparable to
the way drug abusers have to use more and more drugs to obtain the same
high. A neuroimaging study found that frequent ice cream consumption “is
related to a reduction in reward-region [pleasure center] responsivity
in humans, paralleling the tolerance observed in drug addiction.” Once
you’ve so dulled your dopamine response, you may subsequently overeat in
an effort to achieve the degree of gratification experienced previously,
contributing to unhealthy weight gain.10</p>
<p>What do fatty and sugary foods have in common? They are both energy
dense. It may be less about the number of calories than their
concentration. Consumption of green-light foods, which are naturally
calorie dilute, doesn’t lead to a deadened dopamine response, but a
calorie-dense diet with the same number of calories does.11 It’s like
the difference between cocaine and crack: It’s the same stuff
chemically, but by smoking crack cocaine, a user can deliver a higher
dose more quickly to his or her brain.</p>
<p>Given our new understanding of the biological basis of food
addiction, there have been calls to include obesity as an official
mental disorder.12 After all, both obesity and addiction share the
inability to restrain behavior in spite of an awareness of detrimental
health consequences, one of the defining criteria of substance abuse (a
phenomenon referred to as the “pleasure trap”).13 Of course, redefining
obesity as an addiction would be a boon to the pharmaceutical companies
that are already working on a whole array of drugs to muck with your
brain chemistry.14</p>
<p>For example, when researchers tried giving an opiate blocker to binge
eaters (similar to how heroin addicts are sometimes treated with opiate
blockers to minimize the narcotic’s effects), the binge eaters ate
significantly fewer fatty and sugary snacks—the snacks just didn’t seem
to do as much for them when their opiate receptors were blocked.15 In
addition to new drugs, addiction specialists have urged that the food
industry “should be given incentives to develop low calorie foods that
are more attractive, palatable and affordable so that people can adhere
to diet programs for a long time.”16 No need—Mother Nature beat them to
it. That’s what the produce aisle is for.</p>
<p>Rather than taking drugs, you can prevent the numbing of your
pleasure center in the first place by sticking to green-light foods.
This can help return your dopamine sensitivity to normal levels so that
you can again derive the same pleasure from the simplest of foods. When
you regularly eat calorie-dense animal products and junk foods like ice
cream, it’s not just your taste buds that change but your brain
chemistry. After eating a bunch of candy bars, not only may a ripe peach
no longer taste as sweet on your tongue but your brain down-regulates
dopamine receptors to compensate for the repeated jolts of fat and
sugar. In fact, an overly rich diet could cause you to experience less
enjoyment from other activities as well.</p>
<p>There is a reason cocaine addicts appear to have an impaired
neurological capacity for sexual stimulation17 and why smokers have an
impaired ability to respond to positive stimuli.18 Related brain
circuits wire all these sensations. Since they all involve overlapping
dopamine pathways, what you put into your body—what you eat and what you
drink—can affect how you experience all of life’s pleasures. Try it and
see. Try it and feel.</p>
<p>Do you see where I’m going with this?</p>
<p>Eating a whole-food, plant-based diet and returning your brain’s
dopamine sensitivity to its healthy, normal levels can help you live
life to the fullest and allow you to experience greater joy,
satisfaction, and pleasure from all the things you do—not just what you
eat.</p>
<p>Let Me Help</p>
<p>I hope I’ve been able to persuade you that nutrition is not the
stale, lifeless subject your middle school home-economics class may have
led you to believe. It’s vibrant and overflowing with opportunity for
the betterment of your life. This abundance can create a problem,
though. Over the last year alone, more than twenty-five thousand
articles on nutrition were published in the medical literature. Who has
time to sift through them all?</p>
<p>Every year, my team and I read through every issue of every
English-language nutrition journal in the world so you don’t have to.
Then I compile all the most interesting, groundbreaking, and practical
findings we can uncover to create new videos and articles every day for
my nonprofit site, NutritionFacts.org.</p>
<p>Everything on NutritionFacts.org is provided absolutely free of
charge. There’s no special member area where you pay a fee to get extra
lifesaving information. What membership websites seem to be saying, in
essence, is that if you don’t give them money, they’ll withhold
information that could make your family healthier. That’s unacceptable
to me. Advances in health sciences should be freely available and
accessible to all.</p>
<p>Since we refuse to sell products, advertisements, or endorsements,
how do the bills get paid? NutritionFacts.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
organization that thrives on the Wikipedia model of simply accepting
donations from visitors who appreciate the content. We reach so many
millions of people that if even one in one thousand makes a small,
tax-deductible contribution, we are able to pay for all the staff and
server costs. (I personally don’t accept any compensation for my work on
NutritionFacts.org; I’m privileged to be able to donate my time as a
labor of love.) The hope is to offer a public service so valuable that
viewers will feel moved to support it and keep this life-changing,
life-saving resource free for everyone for all time.</p>
<p>I welcome you to come and make NutritionFacts.org a part of your
life. I’ve got new videos and articles every day on the latest in
evidence-based nutrition. You can sign up for daily, weekly, or monthly
e-mails highlighting all the new, fun, juicy information. It warms my
heart to hear it’s become a Sunday ritual for many families. It exists
to serve you.</p>
<p>Taking Responsibility</p>
<p>My goal is to give you the information to empower and inspire you to
make healthy changes in your life, but in the end, it’s all up to you.
Know, however, that there is only one way of eating that’s ever been
proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients, a diet
centered around whole plant foods. Anytime anyone tries to sell you on
some new diet, ask just one simple question: “Has it been proven to
reverse heart disease?” (You know, the most likely cause of death for
you and everyone you love?) If it hasn’t, why would you even consider
it?</p>
<p>If that’s all a whole-food, plant-based diet could do—reverse our
number-one killer—then shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven
otherwise? And the fact that it can also be effective in preventing,
treating, and arresting other leading killers would seem to make the
case for eating this way overwhelming. Please give it a try.</p>
<p>It could save your life.</p>
<hr />
<p>How Not to Die may seem to you a strange title for a book. After all,
everyone is going to die eventually. It’s about how not to die
prematurely. If there is one takeaway message, it’s that you have
tremendous power over your health destiny. The vast majority of
premature deaths can be prevented with simple changes in what you eat
and how you live.</p>
<p>In other words, a long and healthy life is largely a matter of
choice. In 2015, Dr. Kim Williams became president of the American
College of Cardiology. He was asked why he chose to eat a strictly
plant-based diet. “I don’t mind dying,” Dr. Williams said. “I just don’t
want it to be my fault.”19</p>
<p>That’s what this book is about: taking responsibility for your and
your family’s health.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>There are many thanks I’d like to express: to my cowriters and
editors, Gene, Jennifer, Miranda, Miyun, Nick, and Whitney, who helped
turn my bite-sized chunks of science into a coherent, four-course
narrative meal; to my fact-checkers, Alissa, Allison, Frances, Helena,
Martin, Michelle, Seth, Stephanie, and Valerie; and to all the
NutritionFacts.org volunteers who helped with the book: Brad, Cassie,
Emily, Giang, Jerold, Kari, Kimberley, Laura, Lauren, Luis, Tracy, and
especially Jennifer—no physician has ever known a better PA or a better
friend. Also, much appreciation to Brenda and Vesanto for their keen
insights and vast knowledge.</p>
<p>This book would not have been possible without my wonderful
staff—Joe, Katie, Liz, and Tommasina—and everyone at HSUS who supported
me on the work front, and Andrea, my partner in life, and our beloved
family, who supported me on the home front. NutritionFacts.org would not
have even been possible without the Jesse andandandand Julie Rasch
Foundation, the design and coding genius of Christi Richards, and the
thousands who have donated to enable my work to reach millions.</p>
<p>Though it was my grandmother who made me the doctor I am today, it
was my mother who made me the person I am today. I love you, Mom!</p>
