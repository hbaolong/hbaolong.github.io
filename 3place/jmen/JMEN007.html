<h4 id="chapter-4-how-not-to-die-from-digestive-cancers">CHAPTER 4 How
Not to Die from Digestive Cancers</h4>
<p>Every year, Americans lose more than five million years of life from
cancers that may have been prevented.1 Only a small percentage of all
human cancers are attributable to purely genetic factors. The rest
involve external factors, particularly our diet.2</p>
<p>Your skin covers about twenty square feet. Your lungs, if you were to
flatten out all the tiny air pockets, could cover hundreds of square
feet.3 And your intestines? Counting all the little folds, some
scientists estimate that your gut would blanket thousands of square
feet,4 vastly more expansive than your skin and lungs combined. What you
eat may very well be your primary interface with the outside world. This
means that regardless of the carcinogens that could be lurking in the
environment, your greatest exposure may be through your diet.</p>
<p>Three of the most common cancers of the digestive tract kill
approximately one hundred thousand Americans each year. Colorectal
(colon and rectal) cancer, which claims fifty thousand lives annually,5
ranks among the most commonly diagnosed of all cancers. Thankfully, it
is also among the most treatable if caught early enough. Pancreatic
cancer, on the other hand, is virtually a death sentence for the
approximately forty-six thousand people who develop it every year.6 Few
survive beyond a year after diagnosis, which means prevention is
paramount. Esophageal cancer, which affects the tube between your mouth
and stomach, is also frequently fatal for its eighteen thousand annual
victims.7 The foods you eat can indirectly affect cancer risk, for
example, by exacerbating acid reflux, a risk factor for esophageal
cancer, or through direct contact with the lining of the digestive
tract.</p>
<p>COLORECTAL CANCER</p>
<p>The average person has about a one-in-twenty chance of developing
colorectal cancer over the course of his or her lifetime.8 Fortunately,
it is among the most treatable cancers, as regular screening has enabled
doctors to detect and remove the cancer before it spreads. There are
more than one million colorectal cancer survivors in the United States
alone, and, among those diagnosed before the cancer has spread beyond
the colon, the five-year survival rate is about 90 percent.9</p>
<p>But, in its early stages, colorectal cancer rarely causes symptoms.
If the cancer is not caught until later stages, treatment is more
difficult and less effective. Starting at age fifty until age
seventy-five, you should either get stool testing every year, stool
testing every three years plus a sigmoidoscopy every five years, or a
colonoscopy every ten years.10 For more on the risks and benefits of
these options, see chapter 15. While regular screenings are certainly
sensible to detect colorectal cancer, preventing it in the first place
is even better.</p>
<p>Turmeric</p>
<p>India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is about eight times less than
that of the United States,11 and about 20 percent of its population
lives below the poverty line,12 yet cancer rates in India are much lower
than in the United States. Women in the United States may have ten times
more colorectal cancer than women in India, seventeen times more lung
cancer, nine times more endometrial cancer and melanoma, twelve times
more kidney cancer, eight times more bladder cancer, and five times more
breast cancer. Men in the United States appear to have eleven times more
colorectal cancer than men in India, twenty-three times more prostate
cancer, fourteen times more melanoma, nine times more kidney cancer, and
seven times more lung and bladder cancer.13 Why such a discrepancy? The
regular use of the spice turmeric in Indian cooking has been proposed as
one possible explanation.14</p>
<p>In chapter 2, we saw how curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice
turmeric, may be effective against cancer cells in vitro. Very little of
the curcumin you eat gets absorbed into your bloodstream, however, so it
may never come in sufficient contact with tumors outside the digestive
tract.15 But what doesn’t get absorbed into your blood ends up in your
colon, where it could impact the cells lining your large intestine where
cancerous polyps develop.</p>
<p>The emergence of colorectal cancer can be broken up into three
stages. The first sign may be what are called “aberrant crypt foci,” or
abnormal clusters of cells along the lining of the colon. Next come
polyps that grow from that inner surface. The final stage is thought to
occur when a benign polyp transforms into a cancerous one. The cancer
can then eat through the wall of the colon and spread throughout the
body. To what degree can curcumin block each stage of colorectal
cancer?</p>
<p>Studying smokers, who tend to have a lot of aberrant crypt foci,
investigators found that curcumin consumption could reduce the number of
those cancer-associated structures in their rectums up to nearly 40
percent, from eighteen down to eleven, within just thirty days. The only
reported side effect was a yellow tint to their stools.16</p>
<p>What if polyps have already developed? Six months of curcumin, along
with another phytonutrient called quercetin, which is found naturally in
such fruits and vegetables as red onions and grapes, were found to
decrease the number and size of polyps by more than half in patients
with a hereditary form of colorectal cancer. Again, virtually no side
effects were reported.17</p>
<p>What if the polyps have already transformed into cancer? In a
last-ditch attempt to save the lives of fifteen patients with advanced
colorectal cancer who didn’t respond to any of the standard chemotherapy
agents or radiation, oncologists started them on a turmeric extract. In
the two to four months of treatment, it appeared to help stall the
disease in one-third of the patients, five out of fifteen.18</p>
<p>If we were talking about some new kind of chemotherapy drug that only
helped one in three people, you’d have to weigh that against all the
serious side effects. But when it’s just some plant extract shown to be
remarkably safe, even if it just helped one in a hundred, it would be
worth considering. With no serious downsides, a one-in-three potential
benefit for end-stage cancer seems like it would spark further research,
right? But who’s going to pay for a study of something that can’t be
patented?19</p>
<p>The low cancer rate in India may be due in part to the spices they
use, but it may also stem from the types of foods they are putting those
spices on. India is one of the world’s largest producers of fruits and
vegetables, and only about 7 percent of the adult population eats meat
on a daily basis. What most of the population does eat every day are
dark-green, leafy vegetables and legumes,20 such as beans, split peas,
chickpeas, and lentils, which are packed with another class of
cancer-fighting compounds called phytates.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stool Size Matters</p>
<p>The bigger and more frequent your bowel movements are, the healthier
you may be. Based on a study of twenty-three populations across a dozen
countries, the incidence of colon cancer appears to skyrocket as the
average daily stool weight drops below about a half a pound. Populations
dropping quarter pounders appear to have three times the rate of colon
cancer. You can measure the weight of your stools with a simple bathroom
scale. No, not that way—by weighing yourself before and after you
“go.”</p>
<p>The link between stool size and colon cancer may be related to
“intestinal transit time,” the number of hours it takes for food to
travel from mouth to toilet. The larger the stool, the quicker the
transit time, as it’s easier for your intestines to move things along.21
People don’t realize you can have daily bowel movements and still
effectively be constipated; what you’re flushing today you may have
eaten last week.</p>
<p>How long it takes food to get from one end to the other can depend on
gender and dietary habits. Food goes through men eating plant-based
diets in just a day or two, but this transit time takes as long as five
or more days among those eating more conventional diets. Women eating
plant-based diets also average a day or two, but the average intestinal
transit time in most women eating conventional diets may be four days.22
So you can be regular but four days late. You can measure your own
oral-anal transit time by eating some beets and noting when your stools
turn pink. If that takes less than twenty-four to thirty-six hours,
you’re probably meeting the healthy half-pound target.23</p>
<p>Constipation is the most common gastrointestinal complaint in the
United States, leading to millions of doctor visits each year.24 But
beyond just the discomfort, the straining associated with trying to pass
small, firm stools may play a role in a host of health problems,
including hiatal hernia, varicose veins, hemorrhoids,25 and painful
conditions with names like anal fissure.26</p>
<p>Constipation can be considered a nutrient-deficiency disease, and
that nutrient is fiber.27 Just as you can get scurvy if you don’t get
enough vitamin C, you can get constipation if you don’t get enough
fiber. Since fiber is found only in plant foods, it’s no surprise that
the more plants you eat, the less likely you are to be constipated. For
example, a study comparing thousands of omnivores, vegetarians, and
vegans found that those eating strictly plant-based diets are three
times more likely to have daily bowel movements.28 Looks like vegans are
just regular people.</p>
<hr />
<p>Phytates</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death
in the United States,29 yet in some parts of the world, it’s practically
unheard of. The highest rates have been recorded in Connecticut, and the
lowest in Kampala, Uganda.30 Why is colorectal cancer so much more
prevalent in Western cultures? Seeking answers to this question,
renowned surgeon Denis Burkitt spent twenty-four years in Uganda. Many
of the Ugandan hospitals Dr. Burkitt visited had never even seen a case
of colon cancer.31 He eventually came to the conclusion that fiber
intake was the key,32 as most Ugandans consumed diets centered around
whole plant foods.33</p>
<p>Subsequent research has suggested that dietary prevention of cancer
may involve something other than just fiber. For instance, colorectal
cancer rates are higher in Denmark than in Finland,34 yet Danes consume
slightly more dietary fiber than Finns.35 What other protective
compounds might explain the low cancer rates among plant-based
populations? Well, fiber isn’t the only thing found in whole plant foods
that’s missing from processed and animal-based foods.</p>
<p>The answer might lie in natural compounds called phytates, which are
found in the seeds of plants—in other words, in all whole grains, beans,
nuts, and seeds. Phytates have been shown to detoxify excess iron in the
body, which otherwise can generate a particularly harmful kind of free
radical called hydroxyl radicals.36 The standard American diet may
therefore be a double whammy when it comes to colorectal cancer: Meat
contains the type of iron (heme) particularly associated with colorectal
cancer37 but lacks, as do refined plant foods, the phytates to
extinguish these iron-forged free radicals.</p>
<p>For many years, phytates were maligned as inhibitors of mineral
absorption, which is why you might have heard advice to roast, sprout,
or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates. In theory, this would
allow you to absorb more minerals, such as calcium. This belief stemmed
from a series of laboratory experiments on puppies from 1949 that
suggested that phytates had a bone-softening, anticalcifying effect,38
as well as from subsequent studies with similar findings on rats.39 But
more recently, in light of actual human data, phytates’ image has
undergone a complete makeover.40 Those who eat more high-phytate foods
actually tend to have a greater bone mineral density,41 less bone loss,
and fewer hip fractures.42 Phytates appear to protect bone in a manner
similar to that of antiosteoporosis drugs like Fosamax,43 but without
the risk of osteonecrosis (bone rot) of the jaw, a rare, potentially
disfiguring side effect associated with that class of drugs.44</p>
<p>Phytates may also help protect against colorectal cancer. A six-year
study of about thirty thousand Californians found that higher meat
consumption was associated with higher risk of colon cancer.
Unexpectedly, white meat appeared to be worse. Indeed, those who ate red
meat at least once each week had about double the risk of developing
colon cancer; that risk appeared to triple, however, for those who ate
chicken or fish once or more a week.45 Eating beans, an excellent source
of phytates, was found to help mediate some of that risk, so your colon
cancer risk may be determined by your meat-to-vegetable ratio.</p>
<p>There may be as much as an eightfold difference in colorectal cancer
risk between the two extremes—high-vegetable, low-meat diets and
low-vegetable, high-meat diets.46 So it may not be enough to just cut
down on how much meat is in your diet; you also need to eat more plants.
The National Cancer Institute’s Polyp Prevention Trial found that those
who increased their bean consumption by even less than one-quarter cup a
day appeared to cut their odds of precancerous colorectal polyp
recurrence by up to 65 percent.47</p>
<p>Of all the wonderful nutrients in beans, why do we credit the
phytates with reduced risk? Petri-dish studies have shown that phytates
inhibit the growth of virtually all human cancer cells tested so
far—including cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, liver,
pancreas, and skin48—while leaving normal cells alone.49 This is the
mark of a good anticancer agent, the ability to discriminate between
tumor cells and normal tissue. When you eat whole grains, beans, nuts,
and seeds, phytates are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and
readily taken up by tumor cells. Tumors concentrate these compounds so
efficiently that phytate scans can be used to trace the spread of cancer
within the body.50</p>
<p>Phytates target cancer cells through a combination of antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing activities. Besides affecting
the cancer cells directly, phytates have been found to boost the
activity of natural killer cells, which are white blood cells that form
your first line of defense by hunting down and disposing of cancer
cells.51 Phytates can also play a role in your last line of defense,
which involves starving tumors of their blood supply. There are many
phytonutrients in plant foods that can help block the formation of new
blood vessels that feed tumors, but phytates also appear able to disrupt
existing tumor supply lines.52 Similarly, many plant compounds appear
able to help slow down and even stop cancer cell growth,53 but phytates
can sometimes also cause cancer cells to apparently revert back to their
normal state—in other words, to stop behaving like cancer. This cancer
cell “rehabilitation” has been demonstrated in vitro in colon cancer
cells,54 as well as in cancer cells of the breast,55 liver,56 and
prostate.57</p>
<p>Phytates do have side effects, but they all appear to be good. High
phytate intake has been associated with less heart disease, less
diabetes, and fewer kidney stones. In fact, some researchers have
suggested that phytates be considered an essential nutrient. Like
vitamins, phytates participate in important biochemical reactions in the
body. Your levels fluctuate with dietary intake, and insufficient
consumption is associated with diseases that can be moderated by eating
adequate amounts. Maybe phytates should be considered “Vitamin P.”58</p>
<hr />
<p>Reversing Rectal Polyps with Berries?</p>
<p>There are many ways the healthfulness of different fruits and
vegetables can be compared, such as by nutrient content or antioxidant
activity. Ideally, we would use a measure involving actual biological
activity. One way to do this is by measuring the suppression of cancer
cell growth. Eleven common fruits were tested by dripping their extracts
on cancer cells growing in a petri dish. The result? Berries came out on
top.59 Organically grown berries in particular may suppress cancer cell
growth better than those grown conventionally.60 But a laboratory is
different from real life. These findings are only applicable if the
active components of the food are absorbed into your system and manage
to find their way to budding tumors. Colorectal cancer, however, grows
out of the inner lining of your intestines, so what you eat may have a
direct effect regardless. So researchers decided to give berries a
try.</p>
<p>Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited form of colorectal
cancer caused by a mutation in your tumor-suppression genes. People who
are affected develop hundreds of polyps in their colons, some of which
inevitably turn cancerous. Treatment can involve prophylactic colectomy,
where the colon is removed early in life as a preventive step. There was
a drug that appeared able to cause polyps to regress, but it was pulled
from the market after it killed tens of thousands of people.61 Could
berries also cause polyps to retreat without the fatal side effects?
Yes. After nine months of daily treatment with black raspberries, the
polyp burden of fourteen patients with familial adenomatous polyposis
was cut in half.62</p>
<p>Normally, polyps would have to be surgically removed, but the berries
seemed to have made them disappear naturally. The method by which the
berries were administered, though, was anything but natural. The
researchers used a shortcut, giving the berries as suppositories. Don’t
try this at home! After they inserted the equivalent of eight pounds of
raspberries into patients’ rectums over those nine months, some of the
patients suffered from torn anuses.63 The hope is that research will one
day show similar cancer-fighting effects of berries taken the
old-fashioned way—through the mouth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Too Much Iron?</p>
<p>In 2012, the results from two major Harvard University studies were
published. The first, known as the Nurses’ Health Study, began following
the diets of about 120,000 women aged thirty to fifty-five starting back
in 1976; the second, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, followed
about 50,000 men aged forty to seventy-five. Every four years,
researchers checked in with the study participants to keep track of
their diets. By 2008, a total of about 24,000 subjects had died,
including approximately 6,000 from heart disease and 9,000 from
cancer.64</p>
<p>After the results were analyzed, the researchers found that the
consumption of both processed and unprocessed red meat was associated
with an increased risk of dying from cancer and heart disease and
shortened life spans overall. They reached this conclusion even after
controlling for (factoring in) age, weight, alcohol consumption,
exercise, smoking, family history, caloric intake, and even the intake
of whole plant foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. In
other words, the study subjects apparently weren’t dying early because
they ate less of some beneficial compound like phytates in plants. The
findings suggest there may be something harmful in the meat itself.</p>
<p>Imagine the logistics of following more than 100,000 people for
decades. Now imagine a study five times that size. The largest study of
diet and health in history is the NIH-AARP study, cosponsored by the
National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Retired
Persons. Over the course of a decade, researchers followed about 545,000
men and women aged fifty to seventy-one in the largest study of meat and
mortality ever conducted. The scientists came to the same conclusion as
the Harvard researchers: Meat consumption was associated with increased
risk of dying from cancer, dying from heart disease, and dying
prematurely in general. Again, this was after controlling for other diet
and lifestyle factors, effectively excluding the possibility that people
who ate meat also smoked more, exercised less, or failed to eat their
fruits and veggies.65 The accompanying editorial in the American Medical
Association’s Archives of Internal Medicine (titled “Reducing Meat
Consumption Has Multiple Benefits for the World’s Health”) called for a
“major reduction in total meat intake.”66</p>
<p>What does meat contain that may raise the risk of premature death?
One of the possibilities is heme iron, the form of iron found
predominantly in blood and muscle. Because iron can generate
cancer-causing free radicals by acting as a pro-oxidant,67 iron can be
considered a double-edged sword—too little of it and you risk anemia,
too much and you may increase risk of cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>The human body has no specific mechanism to rid itself of excess
iron.68 Instead, humans have evolved to tightly regulate the amount of
iron absorbed. If you don’t have enough iron circulating in your body,
your intestines begin boosting iron absorption; if you have too much
iron in circulation, your intestines decrease absorption. But this
thermostat-like system only works effectively with the primary source of
iron in the human diet: the nonheme iron variety found predominantly in
plant foods. Once you have a sufficient amount of iron in your blood,
your body is about five times more effective at blocking the absorption
of excess iron from plant foods than from animal foods.69 This may be
why heme iron is associated with cancer70 and heart disease risk.71
Similarly, heme iron is associated with higher risk of diabetes, but
nonheme iron is not.72</p>
<p>If we remove iron from people’s bodies, can we decrease cancer rates?
Studies have found that people randomized to give regular blood
donations to reduce their iron stores appear to cut their risk of
getting and dying from new gut cancers by about half over a five-year
period.73 The findings were so remarkable that an editorial in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute responded that “these results
almost seem too good to be true.”74</p>
<p>Donating blood is great, but we should also try to prevent the excess
buildup of iron in the first place. The meat industry is working on
coming up with additives that “suppress the toxic effects of heme
iron,”75 but a better strategy may be to emphasize plant sources in your
diet, which your body can better manage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Getting Enough Iron on a Plant-Based Diet</p>
<p>Compared with people who eat meat, vegetarians tend to consume more
iron (as well as more of most nutrients),76 but the iron in plant foods
is not absorbed as efficiently as the heme iron in meat. While this can
be an advantage in preventing iron overload, about one in thirty
menstruating women in the United States lose more iron than they take
in, which can lead to anemia.77 Women who eat plant-based diets do not
appear to have higher rates of iron deficiency anemia than women who eat
a lot of meat,78 but all women of childbearing age need to ensure
adequate iron intake.</p>
<p>Those diagnosed with iron deficiency should talk with their doctors
about first trying to treat it with diet, as iron supplements have been
shown to increase oxidative stress.79 The healthiest sources of iron are
whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and green, leafy
vegetables. Avoid drinking tea with meals, as that can inhibit iron
absorption. Consuming vitamin C–rich foods can improve iron absorption.
The amount of vitamin C in a single orange can enhance iron absorption
as much as three- to sixfold, so those trying to boost their iron
absorption should reach for some fruit instead of a cup of tea.80</p>

<p>PANCREATIC CANCER</p>
<p>My grandfather died of pancreatic cancer. By the time the first
symptom arose—a dull ache in his gut—it was too late. That’s why we need
to prevent it in the first place.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is among the most lethal forms of cancer, with just
6 percent of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. Thankfully,
it’s relatively rare, killing only about forty thousand Americans each
year.81 As many as 20 percent of pancreatic cancer cases may be a result
of tobacco smoking.82 Other modifiable risk factors include obesity and
heavy alcohol consumption.83 As we’ll see, specific dietary factors may
also play a significant role in the development of this deadly
disease.</p>
<p>For instance, how the fat in one’s diet may contribute to pancreatic
cancer risk has long been a subject of debate. The inconsistency of
research findings on the impact of total fat intake may be partly
because different fats affect risk differently. The previously mentioned
NIH-AARP study was large enough to be able to tease out what kind of fat
was most associated with pancreatic cancer. It was the first to separate
out the role of fats from plant sources, such as those found in nuts,
seeds, avocados, and olive and vegetable oils, versus all animal
sources, including meats, dairy products, and eggs. The consumption of
fat from all animal sources was significantly associated with pancreatic
cancer risk, but no correlation was found with the consumption of plant
fats.84</p>
<p>Chicken and Pancreatic Cancer Risk</p>
<p>Starting in the early 1970s, a series of laws have restricted the use
of asbestos, yet thousands of Americans continue to die every year from
exposure to it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Environmental Protection Agency
have estimated that over a period of thirty years, approximately one
thousand cases of cancer will occur among people exposed to asbestos in
school buildings as children.85</p>
<p>It all started generations ago with the asbestos workers. The first
asbestos-related cancers occurred in the 1920s among miners digging up
the stuff. Then came a second wave among shipbuilders and construction
workers who used asbestos. We are now in the third wave of
asbestos-related disease, as buildings constructed with asbestos are
beginning to deteriorate.86</p>
<p>As the history of asbestos shows, to see if something causes cancer,
scientists first study those who have the greatest exposure to it.
That’s how we’re now learning about the potential cancer-causing effects
of poultry viruses. There has been long-standing concern about the
possibility that wart-causing chicken cancer viruses are being
transmitted to the general population through the handling of fresh or
frozen chicken.87 These viruses are known to cause cancer in the birds,
but their role in human cancers is unknown. This concern arises out of
studies that show that people who work in poultry slaughtering and
processing plants have increased risk of dying from certain cancers.</p>
<p>The most recent, a study of thirty thousand poultry workers, was
designed specifically to test whether “exposure to poultry
cancer-causing viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry
workers—not to mention the general population—may be associated with
increased risks of deaths from liver and pancreatic cancers.” The study
found that those who slaughter chickens have about nine times the odds
of both pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.88 To put this result in
context, the most carefully studied risk factor for pancreatic cancer is
cigarette smoking. But even if you smoked for fifty years, you’d have
“only” doubled your odds of getting pancreatic cancer.89</p>
<p>What about people who eat chicken? The largest study to ever address
that question is the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC) study, which followed 477,000 people for about a
decade. The researchers found a 72 percent increased risk of pancreatic
cancer for every fifty grams of chicken consumed daily.90 And that’s not
much meat, under two ounces—just about a quarter of a chicken
breast.</p>
<p>The researchers expressed surprise that it was the consumption of
poultry—not red meat—that was more closely tied to cancer. When a
similar result was found for lymphomas and leukemias, the same EPIC
research team acknowledged that while the growth-promoting drugs fed to
chickens and turkeys could be playing a role, it might also be cancer
viruses found in poultry.91</p>
<p>The reason the connection between asbestos and cancer was
comparatively easy to nail down is that asbestos caused a particularly
unusual cancer (mesothelioma), which was virtually unknown before
widespread asbestos use.92 But because the pancreatic cancer one might
get from eating chicken is the same pancreatic cancer one might get from
smoking cigarettes, it’s more difficult to tease out a cause-and-effect
relationship. There are diseases unique to the meat industry, such as
the newly described “salami brusher’s disease” that only affects people
whose full-time job is to wire-brush off the white mold that naturally
grows on salami.93 But most diseases suffered by meat industry workers
are more universal. So despite the compelling evidence linking poultry
exposure to pancreatic cancer, don’t expect an asbestos-type ban on
Chick-fil-A anytime soon.</p>
<hr />
<p>Treating Pancreatic Cancer with Curry</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is among the most aggressive forms of cancer.
Untreated, most patients die two to four months after diagnosis.
Unfortunately, only about 10 percent of patients appear to respond to
chemotherapy, with the majority suffering severe side effects.94</p>
<p>Curcumin, the colorful component of the spice turmeric, appears able
to reverse precancerous changes in colon cancer and has been shown in
laboratory studies to be effective against lung cancer cells. Similar
results were obtained using pancreatic cancer cells.95 So why not try
using curcumin to treat patients with pancreatic cancer? In a study
funded by the National Cancer Institute and performed at the MD Anderson
Cancer Center, patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were given large
doses of curcumin. Of the twenty-one patients the researchers were able
to evaluate, two responded positively to the treatment. One had a 73
percent reduction in his tumor size, though eventually a
curcumin-resistant tumor developed in its place.</p>
<p>The other patient, however, showed steady improvement over the course
of eighteen months. The only time cancer markers bumped up was during a
brief three-week period when the curcumin therapy was halted.96 Yes, the
tumors of only two out of twenty-one participants responded, but that’s
about the same as the chemo regimen, and zero adverse effects were
reported with the curcumin treatment. As a result, I’d certainly suggest
curcumin to pancreatic cancer sufferers regardless of what other
treatments they choose. Given the tragic prognosis, though, prevention
is critical. Until we know more, your best bet is to avoid tobacco,
excess alcohol intake, and obesity and to eat a diet low in animal
products, refined grains, and added sugars97 and rich in beans, lentils,
split peas, and dried fruit.98</p>
<hr />
<p>ESOPHAGEAL CANCER</p>
<p>Esophageal cancer occurs when cancer cells develop in the esophagus,
the muscular tube carrying food from your mouth to your stomach.
Typically, the cancer arises in the lining of the esophagus and then
invades the outer layers before metastasizing (spreading) to other
organs. Early on, there may be few symptoms—if any at all. But as the
cancer grows, swallowing difficulties can develop.</p>
<p>Every year, there are about eighteen thousand new cases of esophageal
cancer and fifteen thousand deaths.99 The primary risk factors include
smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD, also called acid reflux), in which acid from the stomach gurgles
up into the esophagus, burning the inner layer and causing inflammation
that can eventually lead to cancer. Besides avoiding tobacco and alcohol
(even light drinking appears to increase risk),100 the most important
thing you can do to prevent esophageal cancer is to eliminate acid
reflux disease—and that can often be accomplished through diet.</p>
<p>Acid Reflux and Esophageal Cancer</p>
<p>Acid reflux is one of the most common disorders of the digestive
tract. The usual symptoms include heartburn as well as the regurgitation
of stomach contents back up toward the throat, which can leave a sour
taste in the mouth. GERD causes millions of doctor visits and
hospitalizations each year and represents the highest annual cost of all
digestive diseases in the United States.101 Chronic inflammation caused
by acid reflux can lead to Barrett’s esophagus, a precancerous condition
that involves changes in the esophageal lining.102 To prevent
adenocarcinoma, the most common type of esophageal cancer in the United
States, this sequence of events must be stopped—and that means halting
acid reflux in the first place.</p>
<p>That’s a tall order in the United States. Over the past three
decades, the incidence of esophageal cancer in Americans has increased
sixfold103—an increase greater than that of breast or prostate cancer,
and it may be chiefly because acid reflux is on the rise.104 In the
United States, about one in four people (28 percent) suffer at least
weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation, compared to just 5 percent
of the population in Asia.105 This suggests that dietary factors may
play a key role.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, about forty-five studies have examined the
link between diet, Barrett’s esophagus, and esophageal cancer. The most
consistent association with cancer was the consumption of meat and
high-fat meals.106 Interestingly, different meats were associated with
cancers in different locations. Red meat is strongly associated with
cancer in the esophagus itself, whereas poultry was more strongly
associated with cancer down around the stomach-esophagus border.107</p>
<p>How does this happen? Within five minutes of eating fat, your
sphincter muscle at the top of your stomach—which acts like a valve to
keep down food inside the stomach—relaxes, allowing acids to creep back
up into the esophagus.108 For example, in one study, volunteers
consuming a high-fat meal (McDonald’s sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich)
experienced more acid squirting up into their esophagus than those
eating a lower-fat meal (McDonald’s hotcakes).109 Part of this effect
may be due to the release of a hormone called cholecystokinin, which is
triggered by both meat110 and eggs111 and may also relax the
sphincter.112 This helps explain why those who eat meat have been found
to have twice the odds of reflux-induced esophageal inflammation
compared with vegetarians.113</p>
<p>Even without the cancer risk, GERD itself can cause pain, bleeding,
and scar-tissue narrowing of the esophagus that can interfere with
swallowing. Billions of dollars are spent on medications to alleviate
heartburn and acid reflux by reducing the amount of stomach acid
produced, but these drugs can contribute to nutrient deficiencies and
increase the risk of pneumonia, intestinal infections, and bone
fractures.114 Perhaps the better strategy would be to just keep the acid
in its place by minimizing the intake of foods that allow acid to
escape.</p>
<p>The protection afforded by plant-based eating may not be based just
on the foods that are reduced, though. Centering your diet around
antioxidant-rich plant foods may cut in half your odds of esophageal
cancer.115 The most protective foods for cancer at the esophagus-stomach
border appear to be red, orange, and dark-green leafy vegetables,
berries, apples, and citrus fruits,116 but all unprocessed plant foods
have the advantage of containing fiber.</p>
<p>Fiber and Hiatal Hernia</p>
<p>While fat intake is associated with increased risk of reflux, fiber
intake appears to decrease that risk.117 High fiber intake may reduce
the incidence of esophageal cancer by as much as one-third118 by helping
to prevent the root cause of many cases of acid reflux: the herniation
of part of the stomach up into the chest cavity.</p>
<p>Hiatal hernia, as this condition is known, occurs when part of the
stomach is pushed up through the diaphragm into the chest. More than one
in five Americans suffer from hiatal hernias. In contrast, hiatal
hernias are almost unheard of among populations whose diets are plant
based, with rates closer to one in a thousand.119 This is thought to be
because they smoothly pass large, soft stools.120</p>
<p>People who don’t eat an abundance of whole plant foods have smaller,
firmer stools that can be difficult to pass. (See box here.) If you
regularly strain to push out stool, over time the increased pressure can
push part of the stomach up and out of the abdomen, allowing acid to
flow up toward the throat.121</p>
<p>This same pressure from straining on the toilet week after week can
cause other problems. Similar to the way squeezing a stress ball causes
a balloon bubble to pop out, the pressure from straining at the toilet
may herniate outpouchings from the wall of the colon, a condition known
as diverticulosis. The increased abdominal pressure may also back up
blood flow in the veins around the anus, causing hemorrhoids, and even
push blood flow back into the legs, resulting in varicose veins.122 But
a fiber-rich diet can relieve the pressure in both directions. Those who
eat diets that revolve around whole plant foods tend to pass such
effortless bowel movements that their stomachs stay where they’re
supposed to,123 which can reduce the acid spillover implicated in one of
our deadliest cancers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can Strawberries Reverse the Development of Esophageal Cancer?</p>
<p>Esophageal cancer joins pancreatic cancer as one of the gravest
diagnoses imaginable. The five-year survival rate is less than 20
percent,124 with most people dying within the first year after
diagnosis.125 This underscores the need to prevent, stop, or reverse the
disease process as early as possible.</p>
<p>Researchers decided to put berries to the test. In a randomized
clinical trial of powdered strawberries in patients with precancerous
lesions in their esophagus, subjects ate one to two ounces of
freeze-dried strawberries every day for six months—that’s the daily
equivalent of about a pound of fresh strawberries.126</p>
<p>All of the study participants started out with either mild or
moderate precancerous disease, but, amazingly, the progression of the
disease was reversed in about 80 percent of the patients in the
high-dose strawberry group. Most of these precancerous lesions either
regressed from moderate to mild or disappeared entirely. Half of those
on the high-dose strawberry treatment walked away disease-free.127</p>
<hr />
<p>Fiber consumption doesn’t just take off the pressure. Humans evolved
eating huge amounts of fiber, likely in excess of one hundred grams
daily.128 That’s up to about ten times what the average person eats
today.129 Because plants don’t tend to run as fast as animals, the bulk
of our diet used to be made up of a lot of bulk. In addition to keeping
you regular, fiber binds to toxins, such as lead and mercury, and
flushes them away (pun intended!).130 Our bodies were designed to expect
an ever-flowing fiber stream, so it dumps such unwanted waste products
as excess cholesterol and estrogen into the intestines, assuming they
will be swept away. But if you aren’t constantly filling your bowels
with plant foods, the only natural source of fiber, unwanted waste
products can get reabsorbed and undermine your body’s attempts at
detoxifying itself. Only 3 percent of Americans may even reach the
recommended minimum daily intake of fiber, making it one of the most
widespread nutrient deficiencies in the United States.131</p>
