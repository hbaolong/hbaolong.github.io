15 How Not to Die from Iatrogenic Causes (or, How Not to Die from
Doctors)</h4>
<p>As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
That’s quaint, but a pound isn’t all that heavy. Why change your diet
and lifestyle when you can just let modern medicine do its job of fixing
you back up?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern medicine isn’t nearly as effective as most
people think.1 Doctors excel at treating acute conditions, such as
mending broken bones and curing infections, but for chronic diseases,
which are the leading causes of death and disability, conventional
medicine doesn’t have much to offer and, in fact, can sometimes do more
harm than good.</p>
<p>For example, side effects from medications given in hospitals kill an
estimated 106,000 Americans every year.2 That statistic alone
effectively makes medical care the sixth-leading cause of death in the
United States. And this number reflects only the number of deaths from
taking the drugs as prescribed. An additional 7,000 people die every
year from receiving the wrong medication by mistake, and 20,000 others
die from other hospital errors.3 Hospitals are dangerous places, and
that’s not even counting the estimated 99,000 deaths each year due to
hospital-acquired infections.4 But can deaths from infections be blamed
on doctors? They can if doctors won’t even wash their hands.</p>
<p>We’ve known since the 1840s that hand washing is the best way to
prevent hospital-acquired infections, yet compliance among health care
workers rarely exceeds 50 percent. And doctors are the worst offenders.5
One study found that even in a medical intensive care unit, slapping up
a “contact precautions” sign (signaling particularly high risk of
infection) leads less than a quarter of doctors to properly wash their
hands or use a hand sanitizer when treating patients.6 That’s right. Not
even one doctor out of four washed his or her hands before laying them
on the ill. Many physicians are concerned that should it become widely
known how many people doctors inadvertently kill every year, it could
“undermine public trust.”7 But if doctors can’t even be bothered to wash
their hands, how much trust do we deserve?</p>
<p>This unfortunate (and gross!) situation means that you could go in
for a simple operation and come out with a life-threatening infection—if
you come out at all. Every year, 12,000 Americans die from complications
due to surgeries that weren’t even necessary in the first place. For
those keeping score, that’s more than 200,000 people dead from so-called
iatrogenic causes (from the Ancient Greek iatrós, meaning “doctor”). And
that figure is based only on the data on hospitalized patients. In
outpatient settings—for instance, at your doctor’s office—prescription
drug side effects alone may result in 199,000 additional deaths.8</p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine estimates that medical errors may kill even
more Americans, up to 98,000,9 bringing the total annual death count
closer to 300,000. That’s more than the entire population of cities like
Newark, Buffalo, or Orlando. Even using more conservative estimates of
deaths due to medical errors, health care comes in as the real
third-leading cause of death in America.10</p>
<p>How did the medical community respond to such damning conclusions?
Deafening silence in both word and deed.11 The first such report, which
appeared in 1978, suggested that about 120,000 deaths occurring in
hospitals could be prevented.12 Then, sixteen years later, another
scathing reminder was published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, suggesting the iatrogenic death toll may be “the equivalent
of three jumbo-jet crashes every 2 days.”13 In the years between these
two reports, as many as nearly two million Americans may have died due
to medical errors, yet the medical community refused to comment on this
tragedy and made no substantial effort to reduce the number of deaths.14
Another estimated 600,000 deaths later, the prestigious Institute of
Medicine released its own landmark report on the catastrophic
consequences of medical error15—but again, little was done as a
result.16</p>
<p>Eventually, a few changes were implemented. For instance, interns and
residents could no longer be made to work for more than eighty hours a
week (at least on paper), and shifts couldn’t be more than thirty
consecutive hours long. That may not sound like a big step, but when I
started my internship after graduating from medical school, we worked
thirty-six-hour shifts every three days—combined with our other days of
work, that added up to a 117-hour work week. When interns and residents
are forced to pull all-nighters, studies suggest they may make 36
percent more serious medical errors, five times more diagnostic errors,
and have twice as many “attentional failures” (such as nodding off
during surgery).17 The patient is supposed to be asleep during surgery,
not the surgeon. It’s no surprise, then, that overworked doctors may
cause 300 percent more fatigue-related medical errors that lead to
patient death.18</p>
<p>If every single day airliners crashed and killed hundreds of people,
we would expect the Federal Aviation Administration to step in and do
something. Why doesn’t anyone confront the medical profession? Instead
of just releasing reports, entities like the Institute of Medicine could
have demanded that doctors and hospitals adopt at least a minimum set of
preventive practices, such as bar-coding drugs to avoid mix-ups.19 (You
know, something they do even on a package of Twinkies at the grocery
store.)</p>
<p>Only people on medications are killed by medication errors or the
drugs’ side effects, though. You have to actually be in the hospital to
be killed by a hospital error or get an infection there. The good news
is that most visits to doctors are for diseases that can be prevented
with a healthy diet and lifestyle.20</p>
<p>The best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical tests and
treatments is not to avoid doctors but to avoid getting sick in the
first place.</p>
<p>Radiation</p>
<p>There are risks associated not only with medical treatment but also
sometimes with diagnosis. A paper entitled “Estimated Risks of
Radiation-Induced Fatal Cancer from Pediatric CT” out of Columbia
University in 2001 reignited long-standing concerns about the risks
associated with medical diagnostic radiation exposure. CT, or CAT, scans
use multiple x-rays from different angles to create cross-sectional
images, exposing the body to hundreds of times more radiation than a
simple x-ray.21 Based on the excess cancer risk of Hiroshima survivors
exposed to similar doses of radiation,22 it was estimated that out of
all children who undergo abdominal or head CT scans every year, five
hundred “might ultimately die from cancer attributable to the CT
radiation.”23 In response to this revelation, the editor in chief of a
leading radiology journal conceded, “We radiologists may be as guilty as
others when it comes to not watching out for children.”24</p>
<p>The risk of developing cancer after a single CT scan may be as high
as 1 in 150 for a baby girl.25 In general, the diagnostic medical
radiation dealt out in one year is estimated to cause 2,800 breast
cancers among American women, as well as 25,000 other cancers.26 In
other words, doctors may be causing tens of thousands of cancers every
year.</p>
<p>Patients undergoing these scans are rarely informed of these risks.
For example, did you know that getting a chest CT scan is estimated to
inflict the same cancer risk as smoking seven hundred cigarettes?27 One
in every 270 middle-aged women may develop cancer due to a single
angiogram.28 CT scans and x-rays can be lifesaving, but good evidence
suggests that one-fifth to one-half of all CT scans aren’t necessary at
all and could be replaced with a safer type of imaging or simply not
performed at all.29</p>
<p>Many people expressed concern about the radiation exposure from the
full-body scanners at airports using backscatter x-rays,30 but those
machines have since been phased out. The airplane itself, however, is a
different story. Because you’re exposed to more cosmic rays from outer
space at higher altitudes, just one round-trip, cross-country flight may
subject you to about the same level of radiation as a chest x-ray.31
(Given my past speaking schedule, I should be glowing in the dark by
now!)</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do to mediate the radiation risk? As with
so many other health questions, the answer is that you can eat
healthfully.</p>
<p>In an investigation funded by the National Cancer Institute,
researchers studied the diets and chromosome integrity of airline
pilots, who get zapped with radiation daily, to see which foods might be
protective. They found that pilots who consumed the most dietary
antioxidants suffered the least amount of DNA damage to their bodies.
Note the word dietary. Antioxidant supplements, such as vitamins C and
E, didn’t seem to help. Pilots who consumed the most vitamin C through
fruits and vegetables, though, appeared to be protected.32 Taking
antioxidant supplements may be more than just a waste of money. People
given 500 mg of vitamin C a day were found to end up with more oxidative
DNA damage.33</p>
<p>Remember that natural antioxidants in food work synergistically; it’s
the combination of many different compounds working together that tends
to protect you, not high doses of single antioxidants found in
supplements. Indeed, those pilots eating a mix of phytonutrients,
concentrated in a variety of such plant foods as citrus, nuts, seeds,
pumpkins, and peppers, had the lowest levels of DNA damage in response
to the radiation they were bombarded with every day from the
galaxy.34</p>
<p>The research team found that green, leafy vegetables like spinach and
kale appear to have an edge over other vegetables and fruits when it
comes to radiation protection.35 All this time I’ve been packing kale
chips on flights just because they’re so lightweight, but it also turns
out they may be protecting my DNA.</p>
<p>The same plant-based protection enjoyed by pilots was also found
among atomic bomb survivors. For several decades, researchers have
followed thirty-six thousand survivors of the nuclear attacks on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those who ate vegetable- or fruit-rich diets
appeared to cut their cancer risk by about 36 percent.36 We saw the same
thing in the aftermath of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
in Ukraine, where consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables apparently
protected children’s immune systems, while egg and fish consumption was
associated with a significantly increased risk of DNA damage. The
researchers suggest this result could have been due to the possibility
that the animal foods they ate were contaminated with radioactive
elements or the role of animal fats in free-radical formation.37</p>
<p>Nuclear events offer a rare opportunity to study these effects on
humans since, obviously, it is unethical to intentionally expose people
to radiation. However, as we’ve learned from declassified documents
about U.S. Cold War radiation experiments, this didn’t stop our
government from injecting “colored” people with plutonium38 or feeding
“retarded” children radioactive isotopes in their breakfast cereal.39
Despite the Pentagon’s insistence that these methods were the “only
feasible means” of developing ways to protect people from radiation,40
researchers have since come up with a few methods that don’t violate the
Nuremburg Code.</p>
<p>One is to study human cells in a test tube. Research has found, for
example, that white blood cells blasted with gamma rays suffered less
DNA damage when the cells had been pretreated with phytonutrients from
ginger root. The ginger compounds protected DNA nearly as well as the
leading radiation sickness drug41 at 150 times lower the dose.42 Those
taking ginger in order to prevent motion sickness during air travel may
be protecting themselves against more than just nausea.</p>
<p>Other common foods that may be protective against radiation damage
include garlic, turmeric, goji berries, and mint leaves,43 but none of
these has been tested in clinical studies. How can we test the
protective power of foods in people rather than petri dishes? To study
how diet may protect against cosmic rays, airline pilots were studied.
Guess who they studied to see if foods could be protective against
x-rays? X-ray technicians.</p>
<p>Hospital workers who routinely operate x-ray machines have been found
to suffer more chromosomal damage and to have higher levels of oxidative
stress compared with other hospital workers.44 For this reason,
researchers recruited a group of x-ray techs and asked them to drink two
cups of lemon balm tea each day for a month. (Lemon balm is an herb in
the mint family.) Even in that short time frame, the lemon balm tea
appeared able to boost the level of antioxidant enzymes in the subjects’
bloodstreams while also reducing the amount of DNA damage they
suffered.45</p>
<p>The Actual Benefit of Diet Versus Drugs</p>
<p>Based on a study of more than one hundred thousand Minnesotans, it
appears that seven out of ten people may be prescribed at least one
prescription drug in any given year. More than half are prescribed two
or more drugs, and 20 percent are prescribed five or more medications.46
All told, physicians dispense about four billion prescriptions for drugs
every year in the United States.47 That’s about thirteen prescriptions a
year for every man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>The two prescription drugs most often brought up in doctor visits are
simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering medication, and lisinopril, a
blood-pressure pill.48 So a lot of drugs are being doled out in an
attempt to prevent disease. But how well are these billions of pills
working?</p>
<p>An overconfidence in the power of pills and procedures for disease
prevention may be one of the reasons doctors and patients alike may
undervalue diet and lifestyle interventions. When surveyed, people tend
to wildly overestimate the ability of mammograms and colonoscopies to
prevent cancer deaths, or the power of drugs like Fosamax to prevent hip
fractures, or drugs like Lipitor to prevent fatal heart attacks.49
Patients believe cholesterol-lowering statin drugs are about twenty
times more effective than they actually are in preventing heart
attacks.50 No wonder most people continue to rely on drugs to save them!
But the dirty little secret is that most people surveyed said they
wouldn’t be willing to take many of these drugs if they knew how little
benefit these products actually offered.51</p>
<p>How ineffectual are some of the most common drugs in America? When it
comes to cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood-thinning drugs, the
chance of even high-risk patients benefiting from them is typically less
than 5 percent over a period of five years.52 When asked, most patients
say they want to be told the truth.53 However, as doctors, we know that
if we divulged this information, few of our patients would agree to take
these drugs every day for the rest of their lives, which would be
detrimental for the small percentage of people who do truly benefit from
them. That’s why doctors in the know and drug companies oversell the
benefits by conveniently not mentioning how tiny these benefits actually
are. When it comes to chronic disease management, practicing
conventional medicine can be thought of as practicing deceptive
medicine.</p>
<p>For the hundreds of millions of people on these drugs who don’t
benefit, it’s not simply a matter of all the money spent and all the
side effects endured. To me, the true tragedy is all the lost
opportunities to address the root causes of patients’ conditions. When
people dramatically overestimate how much their prescription pills
protect them, they may be less likely to make the dietary changes
necessary to dramatically lower their risk.</p>
<p>Take cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, for example. The best they
may be able to offer in terms of absolute risk reduction for a
subsequent heart attack or death is about 3 percent over six years.54
Meanwhile, a whole-food, plant-based diet may work twenty times better,
potentially offering an absolute risk reduction of 60 percent after
fewer than four years.55 In 2014, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. published a
case series of about two hundred people with significant heart disease
showing that a healthy enough plant-based diet may prevent further major
cardiac episodes in 99.4 percent of patients who follow it.56</p>
<p>You don’t really have the luxury of choosing between following a
healthy diet or taking a pill to prevent a heart attack because pills
may not work in the near term in 97 percent of the cases. Of course,
diet and drugs are not mutually exclusive, and many under
Dr. Esselstyn’s care wisely continued to take their cardiac meds. You
just need to have a realistic understanding of how limited a role the
contents of your medicine cabinets play compared to the contents of your
refrigerator. Heart disease may continue to be the number-one killer of
men, women, and eventually our children if doctors continue to rely on
drugs and stents. However, if you eat a healthy enough diet, you may be
able to reverse the stranglehold it has on your heart. That is something
doctors can be proud to divulge to our patients.</p>
<p>Aspirin</p>
<p>How well do over-the-counter drugs perform? For example, take
aspirin. Perhaps the most commonly used medication in the world,57 it’s
been around in pill form for over a century. Its active ingredient,
salicylic acid, has been used in its natural form (as an extract of
willow tree bark) to ease pain and fever for thousands of years.58 One
of the reasons it remains so popular—despite the fact that better
anti-inflammatory painkillers exist now—is that it’s used by millions of
people on a daily basis as a blood thinner to reduce the risk of a heart
attack. As we saw in chapter 1, heart attacks often occur when a blood
clot forms in response to a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque in one of
your coronary arteries. Taking aspirin may help stop this from
happening.</p>
<p>Aspirin may also lower the risk of cancer.59 It works by suppressing
an enzyme within your body that creates pro-clotting factors, thereby
thinning your blood. At the same time, aspirin suppresses
proinflammatory compounds called prostaglandins, which in turn reduces
pain, swelling, and fever. Prostaglandins may also dilate the lymph
vessels inside tumors, potentially allowing cancer cells to spread. One
of the ways scientists think aspirin helps prevent cancer deaths is by
counteracting a tumor’s attempts to pry open the lymphatic bars on its
cage and spread throughout the body.60</p>
<p>So should everyone take a “baby”-strength aspirin a day? (Note that
aspirin should never actually be given to infants or children.)61
No. The problem is that aspirin can cause side effects. The same
blood-thinning benefit that can prevent a heart attack can also cause a
hemorrhagic stroke, in which you bleed into your brain. Aspirin can also
damage the lining of the digestive tract. For those who’ve already had a
heart attack and continue to eat the same diet that led to the first one
(and are therefore at exceedingly high risk of having another one), the
risk-benefit analysis seems clear: Taking aspirin would probably prevent
about six times more serious problems than it causes you. But among the
general population who have yet to have their first heart attack, the
risks and benefits are more closely matched.62 Thus, taking an aspirin a
day is generally not recommended.63 Throw in even a 10 percent reduction
in cancer mortality, though, and it could tip the risk-benefit balance
in favor of aspirin.64 Given that regular, low-dose aspirin use may
reduce the risk of cancer mortality by one-third,65 it is tempting to
recommend it for nearly everyone. If only you could get the benefits
without the risks.</p>
<p>Well, maybe you can.</p>
<p>The willow tree isn’t the only plant that contains salicylic acid.
It’s widely found in many of the fruits and vegetables in the plant
kingdom.66 That’s why you often find the active ingredient of aspirin in
the bloodstreams of people who aren’t taking it.67 The more fruits and
vegetables you eat, the higher your level of salicylic acid may rise.68
In fact, the levels of people eating plant-based diets actually overlap
with those of some people taking low-dose aspirin.69</p>
<p>With all that salicylic acid flowing through their systems, you might
think plant eaters would have higher ulcer rates, because aspirin is
known to chew away at the gut. But those following plant-based diets
actually appear to have a significantly lower risk of ulcers.70 How is
that possible? Because in plants, the salicylic acid may come naturally
prepackaged with gut-protective nutrients. For example, nitric oxide
from dietary nitrates exerts stomach-protective effects by boosting
blood flow and protective mucus production in the lining of the stomach,
effects which demonstrably oppose the pro-ulcerative impact of
aspirin.71 So, for the general population, by eating plants instead of
taking aspirin, individuals may not only get aspirin’s benefits without
its risks but also get the benefits—with benefits.</p>
<p>People who have had a heart attack should follow their physician’s
advice, which probably includes taking aspirin every day. But what about
everyone else? I think everyone should take aspirin—but in the form of
produce, not a pill.</p>
<p>The salicylic acid content in plants may help explain why
traditional, plant-based diets were so protective. For instance, before
their diets were Westernized, animal products made up only about 5
percent of the average Japanese diet.72 During this period in the 1950s,
age-adjusted death rates from colon, prostate, breast, and ovarian
cancers were five to ten times lower in Japan than in the United States,
while incidences of pancreatic cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were three
to four times lower. This phenomenon was not unique to the Japanese. As
we’ve seen throughout this book, Western rates of cancers and heart
disease have been found to be dramatically lower among populations whose
diets are centered around plant foods.73</p>
<p>If part of this protection arises from the aspirin phytonutrients,
which plants in particular are packed with the stuff? While salicylic
acid is ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices
contain the highest concentrations.74 Chili powder, paprika, and
turmeric are rich in the compound, but cumin has the most per serving.
Indeed, just one teaspoon of ground cumin may be about the equivalent of
a baby aspirin. This may help explain why India, with its spice-rich
diets, has among the lowest worldwide rates of colorectal cancer75—the
cancer that appears most sensitive to the effects of aspirin.76</p>
<p>And the spicier, the better! A spicy vegetable vindaloo has been
calculated to contain four times the salicylic acid content of a milder
madras-style veggie dish. Eat a single meal, and you can get the same
spike in salicylic acid in your bloodstream as if you took an
aspirin.77</p>
<p>The benefits of salicylic acid are another reason you should strive
to choose organic produce. Because the plant uses the compound as a
defense hormone, its concentration may be increased when that plant is
bitten by bugs. Pesticide-laden plants aren’t nibbled as much and,
perhaps as a result, appear to produce less salicylic acid. For example,
in one study, soup made from organic vegetables was found to contain
nearly six times more salicylic acid than soup prepared from
conventional, nonorganically grown ingredients.78</p>
<p>Another way to get more salicylic acid bang for your buck is by
opting for whole foods. Whole-grain breads, for example, not only offer
more salicylic acid but may contain one hundred times more
phytochemicals in general than white bread—reportedly eight hundred
compared with approximately eight.79</p>
<p>Attention has been focused on salicylic acid because of the
voluminous data on aspirin, but hundreds of the other phytonutrients
have been found to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity as
well. Still, given the strength of the aspirin evidence, there are those
in the public health community who talk of a widespread “salicylic acid
deficiency,” proposing that the compound be classed as an essential
vitamin: “Vitamin S.”80 Whether it’s the salicylic acid or a combination
of other phytonutrients that account for the benefits of whole plant
foods, the solution is the same: Eat more of them.</p>
<p>Colonoscopies</p>
<p>The colonoscopy. You’ll be hard pressed to find a more dreaded
routine procedure. Every year, U.S. doctors may perform more than
fourteen million colonoscopies,81 an exam used to detect abnormal
changes in the large intestine (colon) and rectum. During the procedure,
doctors insert a five-foot-long flexible tube fitted with a tiny video
camera and inflate the colon with air to visualize the colon lining. Any
suspicious polyps or other abnormal tissue can be biopsied during the
procedure. Colonoscopies can help doctors diagnose causes of rectal
bleeding or chronic diarrhea, but routine colon cancer screenings may be
the most common reason they are performed.</p>
<p>The reasons doctors often find it difficult to convince their
patients to keep coming back for colonoscopies include the necessary
bowel prep, during which you have to drink quarts of a powerful liquid
laxative before the procedure to completely clean yourself out. There’s
also the pain and discomfort of the procedure itself82 (though you’re
purposefully given drugs with amnesiac effects so you won’t remember how
it felt),83 feelings of embarrassment and vulnerability, and the fear of
complications.84 These fears are not unfounded. Despite how routinely
colonoscopies are performed, serious complications occur in about 1 out
of every 350 cases, including such issues as perforations and fatal
bleeding.85 Perforations can occur when the tip of the colonoscope
punctures the wall of the colon, when the colon is overinflated, or when
a doctor cauterizes a bleeding biopsy site. In extremely rare cases,
this cautery can ignite some residual gas and cause the colon to
literally explode.86</p>
<p>Death from colonoscopy is rare, occurring in only about 1 in every
2,500 procedures.87 Yet this means colonoscopies may be killing
thousands of Americans every year, raising the question: Do the benefits
outweigh the risks?</p>
<p>Colonoscopies are not the only screening technique for colon cancer.
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the official
prevention guidelines body, considers colonoscopies just one of three
acceptable colon-cancer screening strategies. Starting at age fifty,
everyone should get either a colonoscopy once a decade, have their stool
tested for hidden blood every year (which involves no scoping at all),
or have a sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every
three. The evidence supporting “virtual” colonoscopies or DNA stool
testing was judged insufficient.88 Though routine screenings are no
longer recommended at age seventy-five, this assumes you’ve been testing
negative for twenty-five years. If you’re now seventy-five and have
never been screened, then it’s probably a good idea to get screened at
least into your eighties.89</p>
<p>Sigmoidoscopy uses a much smaller scope than in a colonoscopy and has
ten times fewer complications.90 However, because the scope may only go
about two feet inside your body, it might miss tumors farther inside. So
which is better overall? We won’t know until randomized controlled
colonoscopy trials are published in the mid-2020s.91 Most other
developed countries do not recommend either scoping procedure, though.
For routine colon cancer screening, they still endorse the noninvasive
stool blood testing.92</p>
<p>Which of the three options is best for you? The USPSTF recommends
that the decision should be made on an individualized basis after
weighing the benefits and risks with your doctor.</p>
<p>To what extent, though, do doctors inform patients of their options?
Researchers audiotaped clinic visits to find out. They were looking for
the nine essential elements of informed decision making, which include
explaining the pros and cons of each option, describing the
alternatives, and making sure the patient understands these
options.93</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it came to colon cancer screening, in most cases,
the doctors and nurse practitioners studied communicated none of this
vital information, zero out of nine elements.94 As an editorial in the
Journal of the American Medical Association put it: “There are too many
probabilities and uncertainties for patients to consider and too little
time for clinicians to discuss them with patients.”95 So doctors tend to
just make up patients’ minds for them. What do they choose? A National
Cancer Institute–funded survey of more than one thousand physicians
found that nearly all doctors (94.8 percent) recommended a
colonoscopy.96 Why do doctors push colonoscopies in the United States
when most of the rest of the world appears to prefer noninvasive
alternatives?97 It may be because most doctors in the rest of the world
don’t get paid by procedure.98 As one U.S. gastroenterologist put it,
“Colonoscopy … is the goose that has laid the golden egg.”99</p>
<p>An exposé in the New York Times on spiraling health care costs noted
that in many other developed countries, colonoscopies cost just a few
hundred dollars. In the United States? The procedure may cost thousands,
which the journalists concluded has less to do with providing top-notch
medical care and more with business plans aimed at maximizing revenue,
marketing, and lobbying.100 Who’s in charge of setting the prices? The
American Medical Association. A Washington Post investigation exposed
that each year, a secretive AMA committee determines billing standards
for common procedures. The result is gross overestimates for the time it
takes to perform common services like colonoscopies. As the Post pointed
out, if AMA standards are to be believed, some doctors would have to
work more than twenty-four hours a day to perform all the procedures
they report to Medicare and private insurers. Is it any wonder that
gastroenterologists bank nearly 00,000 per year?101</p>
<p>But why would your family doctor or internist push the procedure if
they’re not the ones doing it? Many doctors who refer their patients to
gastroenterologists receive what are essentially financial kickbacks.
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on this
practice of so-called self-referrals, a scheme where providers refer
patients to entities in which they have a financial interest. The GAO
estimated that doctors make nearly a million more referrals every year
than they would have if they were not personally profiting.102</p>
<hr />
<p>What to Take Before a Colonoscopy</p>
<p>Ever popped one of those breath mints after a big meal at a
restaurant? Peppermint doesn’t just make your breath smell better; it
also helps to reduce the gastrocolic reflex—the urge to defecate
following a meal. Nerves in your stomach stretch after eating, which
triggers spasms in the colon to enable your body to make room for more
food coming down the pike. Peppermint can reduce these spasms by
relaxing the muscles that line your colon.103</p>
<p>What does this have to do with colonoscopies? If you take circular
strips of human colons removed during surgery and lay them on a table,
they spontaneously contract about three times per minute. Isn’t that
kind of creepy? But if you drip menthol (found in peppermint) onto the
colon strips, the strength of the contractions diminishes
significantly.104 During a colonoscopy, such spasms can hinder the
progress of the scope and cause the patient discomfort. By relaxing
colon muscles, peppermint can make the procedure easier for both doctor
and patient.</p>
<p>Doctors have experimented with spraying peppermint oil from the tip
of the colonoscope,105 as well as using a hand pump to flood the colon
with a peppermint solution prior to the procedure.106 The simplest
solution might be the best, though: asking the patient to swallow
peppermint oil capsules. Premedicating with eight drops’ worth of
peppermint essential oil four hours before a colonoscopy was found to
significantly reduce colon spasms, patient pain, and make the scope
easier to insert and withdraw compared with a placebo.107</p>
<p>If you do need a colonoscopy, ask your doctor about using this simple
plant remedy. It might make it easier on both of you.</p>
<hr />
<p>Clearly, patients in America may be getting more medical care than
they really need. So said Dr. Barbara Starfield, who literally wrote the
book on primary care.108 One of our nation’s most prestigious
physicians, she composed the scathing commentary in the Journal of the
American Medical Association naming medical care as the third-leading
cause of death in the United States.109</p>
<p>Her primary-care work has been widely embraced, but her findings on
the potentially ineffective and even harmful nature of U.S. health care
received almost no attention. “The American public appears to have been
hoodwinked into believing that more interventions lead to better
health,” she later said in an interview.110 As one health care quality
advisor noted, the widespread disregard of Dr. Starfield’s evidence
“recalls the dark dystopia of George Orwell’s 1984, where awkward facts
swallowed up by the ‘memory hole’ become as if they had never existed at
all.”111</p>
<p>Sadly, Dr. Starfield is no longer with us. Ironically, she may have
died from one of the adverse drug reactions she so vociferously warned
us about. After she was placed on two blood thinners to prevent a stent
in her heart from clogging up, she told her cardiologist she was
bruising more and bleeding longer—that’s the drug risk you hope doesn’t
outweigh the benefits. Then Dr. Starfield died after apparently hitting
her head while swimming and bleeding into her brain.112</p>
<p>The question I ask myself is not whether she should have been put on
two blood thinners for as long as she was—or whether she should have had
the stent inserted to begin with. Rather, I wonder if she could have
avoided the medication and the surgery both by avoiding the heart
disease in the first place. Heart attacks are considered 96 percent
avoidable in women who eat a wholesome diet and engage in other healthy
lifestyle behaviors.113 The number-one killer of women need almost never
happen.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">PART 2</h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In part 1 of this book, I explored the science that demonstrates the
role a plant-based diet rich in certain foods may play in helping to
prevent, treat, and even reverse the fifteen leading causes of death.
For those who may have already been diagnosed with one or more of these
diseases, the information in part 1 can be lifesaving. But for everyone
else—perhaps those worried about inheriting their family history of
illness or those who simply want their diet to promote health and
longevity—the primary question might concern food choices to make day in
and day out. I have given more than a thousand presentations, and one of
the most common questions I get is, “What do you eat every day,
Dr. Greger?”</p>
<p>This, part 2 of How Not to Die, is my response to that question.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve never had so much a sweet tooth as a grease tooth. Pepperoni
pizza. Chicken wings by the basket. Sour cream–and-onion potato chips. A
Hardee’s bacon cheeseburger nearly every day during high school.
Anything oily and fatty—and all washed down with an ice-cold Dr Pepper.
Okay, so maybe a little sweet tooth. I also really liked
strawberry-frosted doughnuts.</p>
<p>Even though my grandma’s miraculous recovery from heart disease
inspired me to pursue a career in medicine, I didn’t clean up my own
diet until the publication of Dr. Ornish’s landmark Lifestyle Heart
Trial in 1990. I was such a nerd in high school that I would spend my
summer vacations hanging out in the science library at the local
university. And there it was, published in the most prestigious medical
journal in the world—proof that my family’s story was not a fluke: Heart
disease could be reversed. Dr. Ornish and his team had taken
before-and-after x-rays of people’s arteries and demonstrated how they
could be opened up without angioplasty. No surgery. No miracle drug.
Just a plant-based diet and other healthy lifestyle changes. That’s what
motivated me to change my own diet and ignited my twenty-five-year love
affair with nutritional science. From that point forward, I have been
determined to spread the word about food’s power to make you healthy,
keep you healthy, and, if necessary, return you to health.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this book, I’ve created two simple tools to help
you integrate everything I’ve learned into your own daily life:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>a Traffic Light system to quickly identify the healthiest
options, and</p></li>
<li><p>a Daily Dozen checklist that will help you incorporate the foods
that I consider essential to the optimal diet. (Check out the free app
on iPhone and Android.)</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>So which foods are good for you, and which are bad?</p>
<p>This sounds like a simple enough question. In truth, I’ve found it
difficult to answer. Whenever I’m asked at a lecture whether a certain
food is healthy or not, I have to invariably reply, “Compared to what?”
For example, are eggs healthy? Compared to oatmeal, definitely not. But
compared to the sausage links next to them on the breakfast platter?
Yes.</p>
<p>What about white potatoes? They’re vegetables, so they must be
healthy, right? Someone asked me this a few years ago after a group of
Harvard University researchers raised concerns about baked and mashed
potatoes.1 So are they healthy? Compared to french fries, yes. Compared
to a baked or mashed sweet potato? No, they’re not.</p>
<p>I realize these may not be satisfying answers for people who just
want to know whether or not to eat the darned potato, but the only way
to answer the question meaningfully is to ask what your other options
are. If you’re in a fast-food joint, for example, a baked potato may
very well be your healthiest option.</p>
<p>Compared to what? is not just a Socratic learning exercise I have
practiced with my patients and students. Eating is essentially a
zero-sum game: When you choose to eat one thing, you are generally
choosing not to eat another. Sure, you could just go hungry, but
eventually your body tends to balance things out by eating more later.
So anything we choose to eat has an opportunity cost.</p>
<p>Every time you put something in your mouth, it’s a lost opportunity
to put something even healthier in there. Think of it as having ,000 in
your daily caloric bank. How do you want to spend it? For the same
number of calories, you can eat one Big Mac, one hundred strawberries,
or a five-gallon bucket of salad. Of course, these three options don’t
exactly fill the same culinary niche—if you want a burger, you want a
burger, and I don’t expect quarts of strawberries to make it on the
Dollar Menu anytime soon—but this is an illustration of how mountainous
a nutritional bang you can get for the same caloric buck.</p>
<p>The opportunity costs exacted are not only the nutrients you could
otherwise be getting but the unhealthy components you could otherwise be
avoiding. After all, when was the last time you had a friend diagnosed
with kwashiorkor, scurvy, or pellagra? These are some of the traditional
nutrient-deficiency diseases upon which the foundation of the field of
nutrition was built. To this day, the nutrition and dietetic professions
remain focused on what nutrients we may be lacking, but most of our
chronic diseases may have more to do with what we’re getting too much
of. Know anyone suffering from obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes,
or high blood pressure?</p>
<hr />
<p>Isn’t It Expensive to Eat Healthfully?</p>
<p>Researchers at Harvard University compared the cost and healthfulness
of various foods across the country, hunting for the best bargains. They
found that in terms of nutritional bang for your buck, people should buy
more nuts, soy foods, beans, and whole grains, and less meat and dairy.
They concluded: “The purchase of plant-based foods may offer the best
investment for dietary health.”2</p>
<p>Less healthy foods only beat out healthier foods on a
cost-per-calorie basis, which is a way we measured food cost back in the
nineteenth century. Back then, the emphasis was on cheap calories, no
matter how you got them. So while beans and sugar both cost the same at
that time (five cents a pound), the U.S. Department of Agriculture
promoted sugar as more cost effective for pure “fuel value.”3</p>
<p>The USDA can be excused for discounting the nutritional difference
between beans and pure sugar. After all, vitamins hadn’t even been
discovered yet. Nowadays, we know better and can compare the cost of
foods based on their nutritional content. An average serving of
vegetables may cost roughly four times more than the average serving of
junk food, but those veggies have been calculated to average twenty-four
times more nutrition. So on a cost-per-nutrition basis, vegetables offer
six times more nutrition per dollar compared to highly processed foods.
Meat costs about three times more than vegetables yet yields sixteen
times less nutrition based on an aggregate of nutrients.4 Because meat
is less nutritious and costs more, vegetables net you forty-eight times
more nutrition per dollar than meat.</p>
<p>If your intent is to shovel as many calories as possible into your
mouth for the least amount of money, then healthier foods lose out, but
if you want to shovel the most nutrition into your mouth as cheaply as
possible, look no further than the produce aisle. Spending just fifty
cents more per day on fruits and vegetables may buy you a 10 percent
drop in mortality.5 Now that’s a bargain! Imagine if there were a pill
that could reduce your chance of dying by 10 percent over the next
decade and only had good side effects. How much do you think the drug
company would charge? Probably more than fifty cents.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dining by Traffic Light</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s official Dietary Guidelines for Americans has
(as of this writing) a chapter “Food Components to Reduce,” which
specifically lists added sugars, calories, cholesterol, saturated fat,
sodium, and trans fat.6 At the same time, there are nine so-called
shortfall nutrients, of which at least a quarter of the American
population isn’t reaching an adequate intake. These are fiber; the
minerals calcium, magnesium, and potassium; and vitamins A, C, D, E, and
K.7 But you don’t eat food “components.” You eat food. There’s no
magnesium aisle in the grocery store. So which foods tend to have the
most of the good stuff and the least of the bad? I’ve simplified it into
a traffic light illustration (see figure 5).</p>
<p>Just as on the road, green means go, yellow means caution, and red
means stop. (In this case, stop and think before you put it into your
mouth.) Ideally, green-light foods should be maximized, yellow-light
ones minimized, and red-light foods avoided.</p>
<p>Is avoid too strong a word? After all, the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans merely encourage you to “moderate” your intake of unhealthy
foods.8 For example: “Eat less … candy.”9 From a health standpoint,
though, shouldn’t you generally try to avoid candy? Public health
authorities don’t just advise you to smoke less tobacco. They tell you
to quit. They know only a small fraction of smokers will actually heed
this advice, but it’s the job of public health authorities to say what’s
best and let people make up their own minds.</p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>That’s why I appreciate the American Institute for Cancer Research
(AICR) recommendations. Not beholden to the USDA, the AICR simply lays
out the science. When it comes to the worst of the worst, the institute
doesn’t pull any punches. Instead of the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans’ advice to “Consume fewer … sodas,”10 the AICR cancer
prevention guidelines advise: “Avoid sugary drinks.” Similarly, the AICR
doesn’t just say to cut back on bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausage, and lunch
meats. The cancer guidelines tell you to “avoid processed meat.” Period.
Why? Because “data do not show any level of intake that can confidently
be shown not to be associated with risk.”11</p>
<p>The healthiest diet is one that maximizes the intake of whole plant
foods and minimizes the intake of animal-based foods and processed junk.
Simply put, eat more green-light foods. Eat fewer yellow-light foods.
And, especially, eat even fewer red-light foods. Just like running red
lights in the real world, you may be able to get away with it once in a
while, but I wouldn’t recommend making a habit out of it.</p>
<p>Given this, what we’ve seen in the previous chapters makes a lot of
sense. Unprocessed plant foods tend to have more of the protective
nutrients that Americans are lacking and fewer disease-promoting
factors. No wonder the eating habit apparently best able to control our
epidemics of dietary disease is a whole-food, plant-based diet. After
all, food is a package deal.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important concepts in all of nutrition. Yes,
there is calcium in cheese, protein in pork, and iron in beef, but what
about all the baggage that comes along with these nutrients—the dose of
dairy hormones, the lard, the saturated fat? As much as Burger King
proclaims you can “Have It Your Way,” you can’t go up to the counter and
ask for a burger, hold the saturated fat and cholesterol. Food is,
indeed, a package deal.</p>
<p>Dairy is the number-one source of calcium in the United States, but
it’s also the number-one source of saturated fat. What kind of “baggage”
do you get along with the calcium in green, leafy vegetables? Fiber,
folate, iron, and antioxidants—some of the very nutrients lacking in
milk. By getting most of your nutrition from whole plant foods, you get
a bonus instead of baggage.</p>
<p>When the National Pork Board promotes ham as an “excellent source of
protein,”12 I can’t help but think of the famous quote from a McDonald’s
senior vice president for marketing who, under oath in a court of law,
described Coca-Cola as nutritious because it is “providing water.”13</p>
<p>Why Don’t the Dietary Guidelines Just Say No?</p>
<p>The green-light message shines brightly in pronouncements telling you
to “eat more fruits and vegetables,” but the yellow and red lights can
be dim and cloudy thanks to politics. In other words, the guidelines are
clear when there is eat-more messaging (“Eat more fresh produce”), but
eat-less messaging is obscured into biochemical components (“Eat less
saturated and trans fatty acids”). National health authorities rarely
just say to “eat less meat and dairy.” That’s why my green-light message
will sound familiar to you (“Oh, ‘eat fruits and veggies’—I’ve heard
that before”) but the yellow- and red-light messages may sound
controversial (“What? Minimize meat? Really?”).</p>
<p>Part of the USDA’s mission is “expanding markets for agricultural
products.”14 At the same time, the federal agency is tasked with
protecting public health by helping to develop the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans. That’s why, when those two directives are in sync, their
eat-more language is clear: “Increase fruit intake.” “Increase vegetable
intake.”15 But when their dual mandates are in conflict—when “improving
nutrition and health” is at odds with promoting “agriculture
production”16—the eat-less messaging of the Dietary Guidelines gets
repackaged and ends up referring to biochemical components: “Reduce
intake of solid fats (major sources of saturated and trans fatty
acids).”</p>
<p>What’s the average consumer supposed to do with that obscure little
nugget?</p>
<p>When the Guidelines tell you to eat less added sugar, calories,
cholesterol, saturated fat, sodium, and trans fat, that’s code for eat
less junk food, less meat, less dairy, fewer eggs, and fewer processed
foods. But they can’t actually say that. When they did in the past, all
heck broke loose. For example, when a USDA employee newsletter even
suggested trying a meat-free lunch once a week as part of Johns Hopkins
University’s School of Public Health “Meatless Mondays” initiative,17
the resulting political firestorm from the meat industry led the USDA to
retract the advice just hours later.18 “As a result of these conflicts
[of interest],” concluded an analysis in the Food and Drug Law Journal,
“the Guidelines sometimes favor the interests of the food and drug
industries over the public’s interest in accurate and impartial dietary
advice.”19</p>
<p>This reminds me of the landmark report on trans fat from the National
Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, one of our most prestigious
institutions.20 They concluded that no amount of trans fat is safe
“because any incremental increase in trans fatty acid intake increases
C[oronary] H[eart] D[isease] risk.”21 Since trans fats are found
naturally in meat and dairy products,22 this placed them in a quandary:
“Because trans fats are unavoidable in ordinary, nonvegan diets,
consuming 0 percent of energy would require significant changes in
patterns of dietary intake.”23</p>
<p>So if trans fats are found in meat and dairy and the only safe intake
of trans fats is zero, that means the Institute of Medicine went on to
encourage everyone to start eating a plant-based diet, right? No, they
did not. The director of Harvard’s Cardiovascular Epidemiology Program
famously explained why: “We can’t tell people to stop eating all meat
and all dairy products,” he said. “Well, we could tell people to become
vegetarians,” he added. “If we were truly basing this only on science,
we would, but it is a bit extreme.”24</p>
<p>We certainly wouldn’t want scientists to base anything on
science!</p>
<hr />
<p>How SAD Is the Standard American Diet?</p>
<p>As cynical as I’ve become about diet and nutrition in this country, I
was still surprised by a 2010 report from the National Cancer Institute
on the status of the American diet. For example, three out of four
Americans don’t eat a single piece of fruit in a given day, and nearly
nine out of ten don’t reach the minimum recommended daily intake of
vegetables. On a weekly basis, 96 percent of Americans don’t reach the
minimum for greens or beans (three servings a week for adults), 98
percent don’t reach the minimum for orange vegetables (two servings a
week), and 99 percent don’t reach the minimum for whole grains (about
three to four ounces a day).25</p>
<p>Then there was the junk food. The federal guidelines were so lax that
up to 25 percent of your diet could be made up of “discretionary
calories,” meaning junk. A quarter of your calories could come from
cotton candy washed down with Mountain Dew, and you’d still be within
the guidelines. Yet we failed. Astoundingly, 95 percent of Americans
exceeded their discretionary calorie allowance. Only one in a thousand
American children between the ages of two and eight made the cutoff,
consuming less than the equivalent of about a dozen spoonfuls of sugar a
day.26</p>
<p>And we wonder why there is an obesity epidemic?</p>
<p>“In conclusion,” the researchers wrote, “nearly the entire U.S.
population consumes a diet that is not on par with recommendations.
These findings add another piece to the rather disturbing picture that
is emerging of a nation’s diet in crisis.”27</p>
<p>Producers of unhealthy commodities aren’t out to make you sick.
They’re just trying to make a buck. Coca-Cola’s profit margin, for
example, is about one quarter of the soda’s retail price, making
soft-drink production, alongside tobacco, among the most profitable
industries.28 What’s harder to understand is why the public health
community isn’t doing more about it.</p>
<p>“When the history of the world’s attempt to address obesity is
written,” wrote the head of Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food
Policy andandandand Obesity, “the greatest failure may be collaboration
with and appeasement of the food industry.”29 For instance, Susan G.
Komen, a leading U.S. breast cancer charity, linked up with fast-food
giant KFC to sell pink buckets of fried chicken.30</p>
<p>Save the Children used to be a leader in the push for taxes on soda
to offset some of the costs of childhood obesity. Then the organization
did an abrupt 180-degree turn, withdrawing its support, saying that such
campaigns no longer “fit with the way that Save the Children works.”
Perhaps it is only a coincidence that it was seeking a grant from
Coca-Cola and had already accepted a million grant from Pepsi.31</p>
<p>Even though our eating habits are now killing more Americans than our
smoking habits,32 I often hear the refrain in public health circles that
we have to work with, rather than against, these companies, because
unlike with tobacco, we don’t have to smoke, but we do have to eat.33
Well, yes, we need to breathe—but we don’t need to breathe smoke. And
yes, we need to eat, but we don’t need to eat junk.</p>
<hr />
<p>How I Define “Processed”</p>
<p>My Traffic Light model stresses two important general concepts: Plant
foods, with their greater protective nutritional factors and fewer
disease-promoting ones, are healthier than animal foods, and unprocessed
foods are healthier than processed foods. Is that always true? No. Am I
saying that all plant foods are better than all animal foods? No. In
fact, one of the worst items on store shelves is partially hydrogenated
vegetable shortening—a product that has vegetable right in its name!
Even some unprocessed plants—such as blue-green algae—can be toxic.34
Anyone who’s had a bad case of poison ivy knows plants don’t always like
to be messed with. In general, though, choose plant foods over animal
foods, and unprocessed over processed. Michael Pollan, bestselling
author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma, has said, “If it came from a plant,
eat it. If it was made in a plant, don’t.”35</p>
<p>What do I mean by processed? The classic example is the milling of
grains from whole wheat to white flour. Isn’t it ironic that these are
called “refined” grains, a word meaning improved or made more elegant?
The elegance was not felt by the millions who died in the nineteenth
century from beriberi, a vitamin B–deficiency disease that resulted from
polishing rice from brown to white.36 (White rice is now fortified with
vitamins to compensate for the “refinement.”) A Nobel Prize was awarded
for the discovery of the cause of beriberi and its cure—rice bran, the
brown part of rice that was removed. Beriberi can cause damage to the
heart muscle, resulting in death from heart failure. Surely such a thing
could never happen in modern times—an epidemic of heart disease that
could be prevented and cured with a change in diet? Come on. (Please
reread chapter 1.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, processing can make foods healthier. For example,
tomato juice appears to be the one common juice that may actually be
healthier than the whole fruit. The processing of tomato products boosts
the availability of the antioxidant red pigment lycopene by as much as
fivefold.37 Similarly, the removal of fat from cacao beans to make cocoa
powder improves the nutritional profile, because cocoa butter is one of
the rare saturated plant fats (along with coconut and palm kernel oils)
that can raise your cholesterol.38</p>
<p>So for the purposes of the Traffic Light model, I like to think of
“unprocessed” as nothing bad added, nothing good taken away. In the
above example, tomato juice could be thought of as relatively
unprocessed because even much of the fiber is retained—unless salt is
added, which would make it a processed food in my book and bump it right
out of the green zone. Similarly, I would consider chocolate—but not
cocoa powder—processed because sugar is added.</p>
<p>Using my definition of nothing bad added, nothing good taken away,
steel-cut oats, rolled oats, and even (plain) instant oatmeal can all be
considered unprocessed. Almonds are obviously a whole plant food. I
would also consider no-salt-added almond butter to be a green-light
food, but even unsweetened almond milk is a processed food, a food from
which nutrition has been stolen. Am I saying almond milk is bad for you?
Foods are not so much good or bad as they are better or worse. All I’m
saying is that unprocessed foods tend to be healthier than processed
ones. Think of it this way: Eating almonds is healthier than drinking
almond milk.</p>
<p>The limited role I see for yellow-light foods in a healthy diet is to
promote the consumption of green-light foods. For instance, if the only
way I can get patients to eat oatmeal in the morning is if they make it
creamy with almond milk, then I tell them to go right ahead. The same
could be said for red-light foods. Without hot sauce, my intake of
dark-green, leafy vegetables would plummet. Yes, I know there are all
sorts of sodium-free, exotically flavored vinegars out there that I
could use, and maybe one day I’ll wean myself off Tabasco. But given my
current tastes, the green ends justify the red means. If the only way
you’re going to eat a big salad is to sprinkle Bac-Os on top, then
sprinkle away.</p>
<p>Bac-Os are what are referred to as ultraprocessed foods, bearing no
redeeming nutritional qualities or resemblance to anything that grew out
of the ground and often containing added garbage. Bac-Os, for example,
have added trans fats, salt, sugar, and Red 40, a food dye banned in a
number of European countries.39 As a red-light food, it ideally should
be avoided, but if the alternative to your big spinach salad with Bac-Os
is KFC, then it’s better to have the salad with the Bac-Os. They can be
the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down. The same goes for
real bacon bits, for that matter.</p>
<p>I realize some people have religious or ethical objections to even
trivial amounts of animal products. (Growing up Jewish near the largest
pig factory west of the Mississippi, I can relate to both sentiments.)
But from a human health standpoint, when it comes to animal products and
processed foods, it’s the overall diet that matters.</p>
<p>What Does “Whole-Food, Plant-Based” Mean, Exactly?</p>
<p>Sometimes people’s diets take on a religiosity of their own. I
remember a man once telling me that he could never “go plant based”
because he could never give up his grandma’s chicken soup. Huh? Then
don’t! After I asked him to say hello to his bubby for me, I told him
that enjoying her soup shouldn’t keep him from making healthier choices
the rest of the time. The problem with all-or-nothing thinking is that
it keeps people from even taking the first steps. The thought of never
having pepperoni pizza again somehow turns into an excuse to keep
ordering it every week. Why not scale down to once a month or reserve it
for special occasions? We cannot let the “perfect” be the enemy of the
good.</p>
<p>It’s really the day-to-day stuff that matters most. What you eat on
special occasions is insignificant compared to what you eat day in and
day out. So don’t beat yourself up if you really want to put edible
bacon-flavored candles on your birthday cake. (I’m not making those
up!40) Your body has a remarkable ability to recover from sporadic
insults as long as you’re not habitually poking it with a fork.</p>
<hr />
<p>This book is not about vegetarianism, veganism, or any other “-ism.”
There are people who completely eliminate any and all animal products as
part of a religious or moral stance and may indeed end up better off as
a side benefit.41 But strictly from a human health standpoint, you would
be hard pressed to argue, for example, that the traditional Okinawan
diet, which is 96 percent plant based,42 is inferior to a typical
Western, 100 percent vegan diet. In Kaiser Permanente’s guide “The
Plant-Based Diet: A Healthier Way to Eat,” the authors define a
plant-based diet as one that excludes animal products completely, but
they make sure to note: “If you find you cannot do a plant-based diet
100 percent of the time, then aim for 80 percent. Any movement toward
more plants and fewer animal products can improve your health!”43</p>
<p>From a nutrition standpoint, the reason I don’t like the terms
vegetarian and vegan is that they are only defined by what you don’t
eat. When I used to speak on college campuses, I would meet vegans who
appeared to be living off french fries and beer. Vegan, technically, but
not exactly health promoting. That’s why I prefer the term whole-food,
plant-based nutrition. As far as I can discern, the best available
balance of evidence suggests that the healthiest diet is one centered on
unprocessed plant foods. On a day-to-day basis, the more whole plant
foods and the fewer processed and animal products, the better.44</p>
<p>Preparing Yourself for Healthier Habits</p>
<p>First, you need to know your own psychology. There are certain
personality types that do better when they go all in. If you tend to
have an “addictive” personality, or if you are the kind of person who
takes things to extremes—for instance, you either don’t drink at all or
you drink in excess—it’s probably best for you to try to stick with the
program. But some individuals can get away with “social smoking,” for
example; they can light up a few times a year and escape nicotine
dependence.45 The reason we as physicians advocate for smokers to quit
completely is not because we think that one cigarette every once in a
while is going to do irreversible damage but because we’re afraid that
one cigarette may lead to two, and, before long, the unhealthy habit has
taken hold. Similarly, one (well-cooked) hamburger is not going to kill
anyone. It’s what you eat day to day that adds up. You have to take
stock of your disposition to know if you can overcome the risk of
sliding down the slippery slope.</p>
<p>There’s a concept in psychology called “decision fatigue” that
marketers use to exploit consumers. It appears humans have a limited
capacity to make many decisions in one short stretch of time, and the
quality of our decisions will deteriorate to the extent that we
eventually begin making downright irrational choices. Ever wonder why
supermarkets stack the junk food at the checkout counter? After wading
through the forty thousand items in the average supermarket,46 we end up
with less willpower to resist impulse purchases.47 So making rules for
yourself and sticking to them may help you make more sensible choices
over the long run. For instance, making a strict decision to never cook
with oil, to avoid meat entirely, or to eat only whole grains may
paradoxically make for sturdier life changes. By not having junk food in
the house, you remove the temptation by removing the choice. I know if I
get hungry enough I’ll eat an apple.</p>
<p>There may also be a physiological argument for not wildly deviating
from a well-planned diet. After a vacation cruise during which you
indulged in all manner of rich foods, your palate may get dulled to the
point where the natural foods you enjoyed just the week before no longer
deliver the same taste satisfaction. For some, this may simply require a
period of readjustment. But for others, this departure from an otherwise
healthy diet may lead back to a dietary glut involving added salt,
sugar, and fat.</p>
<hr />
<p>For those of us who grew up eating SAD (the Standard American Diet),
starting to eat healthfully can be a big shift. I know it was for me.
Though my mom tried to keep us eating good-for-us foods at home, when I
was hanging out with friends, we’d go through boxes of Little Debbie
snack cakes and indulge in greasy meals at the local Chinese restaurant,
where I’d order spareribs or any other dish with chunks of deep-fried
meat. One of my favorite snacks was nacho cheese–flavored Slim Jims.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was able to escape SAD’s clutches before any overt
health problems arose. That was twenty-five years ago. Looking back, I
view that as one of the best decisions of my life.</p>
<p>Some go cold turkey, if you will, while others transition more slowly
using a variety of approaches. One I’ve used personally in my medical
practice is Kaiser Permanente’s three-step method. Realizing that most
American families tend to rotate through the same eight or nine meals,
step one suggests that you think of three meals you already enjoy that
are plant based, like pasta and marinara sauce that could be easily
tweaked to whole-grain pasta with some added veggies. Step two asks you
to think of three meals you already eat that could be adapted to become
a green-light meal, like switching from beef chili to five-bean chili.
Step three is my favorite: Discover new healthy options.48</p>
<p>Ironically, many people following healthy diets report eating an even
greater variety of foods than when they ate their former “unrestricted”
diet. Before widespread use of the Internet, I used to tell people to go
to their public libraries and borrow cookbooks. Today, Google
whole-food, plant-based recipes, and a million hits pop up. If you’re
feeling overwhelmed, good places to start include:</p>
<p>• ForksOverKnives.com: This site of the wildly popular documentary
and book of the same name offers hundreds of recipes.</p>
<p>• StraightUpFood.com: Cooking instructor Cathy Fisher shares more
than one hundred recipes on this site.</p>
<p>• HappyHealthyLongLife.com: This site’s tagline reads: “A [Cleveland
Clinic] medical librarian’s adventures in evidence-based living.” She
used the e word—I think I’m in love!</p>
<p>Once you’ve found three new meals you enjoy and can prepare with
ease, step three is complete. You now have a nine-meal rotation, and
you’re off! After that, moving on to breakfast and lunch is easy.</p>
<p>If you hate to cook and just want the cheapest, easiest way to make
healthy meals, I highly recommend dietitian Jeff Novick’s Fast Food DVD
series. Using common staples like canned beans, frozen vegetables,
quick-cook whole grains, and spice mixes, Jeff shows you how you can
feed your family healthfully in no time for about four dollars a day per
person. The DVDs also include grocery store walk-throughs, shopping
tips, and information on how to decipher nutrition labels. Check out his
cooking series at JeffNovick.com/RD/DVDs.</p>
<p>If you crave more structure and social support, the Physicians
Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a nonprofit nutrition
research and policy advocacy organization in Washington, D.C., has a
fantastic three-week kick-start program for plant-based eating. Check it
out at 21DayKickstart.org. This free online nutrition program starts the
first of every month and offers a full meal plan, recipes, tips,
resources, a restaurant guide, and a community forum. As of this
writing, it’s offered in four languages. Hundreds of thousands of people
have already benefited from it, so feel free to give it a try.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’ve always tried to get my patients to think of healthy eating as an
experiment. It can be overwhelming to think of such a sweeping change as
permanent. That’s why I ask them to give me just three weeks. I find
that if my patients think of it simply as an experiment, they’re more
likely to go whole hog (whole grain?) and realize the maximum benefits.
But that’s just me being sneaky. I know that once those three weeks are
up, if they really gave it their all, they will be feeling so much
better, their lab values will be looking so much better, and their
palates will have started to change. Healthy eating tastes better and
better the longer you stick with it.</p>
<p>I remember talking about this with Dr. Neal Barnard, founding
president of PCRM, which publishes a great deal of research pitting a
healthy diet against a variety of common ailments—everything from acne
and arthritis to menstrual cramps and migraines. He often uses what’s
called an “A-B-A” study design. Participants’ health is assessed at
baseline on their regular diets, and then they’re switched to a
therapeutic diet. In an effort to make sure any health changes
participants experience on the new diet aren’t merely a coincidence,
they are then switched back to their regular diet to see if the changes
disappear.</p>
<p>This kind of rigorous study design improves the validity of the
results, but the problem, Dr. Barnard related, is that sometimes people
improve too much. After a few weeks on a plant-based diet, sometimes
people feel so much better that they refuse to go back on their baseline
diet49—even though it’s required by the study protocol. Since they
didn’t complete the study as planned, their data have to be effectively
thrown out and may never make it into the final paper. Ironically,
healthy eating can be so effective that it undermines its own studies of
effectiveness!</p>
<p>WWDGE: What Would Dr. Greger Eat?</p>
<p>I’m regularly asked what I eat every day. I’ve always been hesitant
to answer for a number of reasons. First, it shouldn’t matter what I or
anyone else eats, says, or does. The science is the science. Too much of
the nutrition world is split into camps, each following their respective
guru. What other field of serious scientific inquiry is like that? After
all, 2 + 2 = 4 regardless of what your favorite mathematician thinks.
This is because there isn’t a trillion-dollar industry that profits from
confusing people about arithmetic. If you were getting conflicting
messages from all sides about basic math, in desperation, you might have
to choose one authority to stick with, hoping that person will
accurately represent the available research. Who has time to read and
decipher all the original source material?</p>
<p>Early on in my practice, I decided that I didn’t want to rely on
anyone else’s interpretation for what could ultimately be life-or-death
decisions for my patients. I had the access, the resources, and the
background to interpret the science on my own. When I initially began my
annual reviews of the nutrition literature, it was really just to make
myself a better doctor. But when I discovered such a treasure trove of
information, I knew I couldn’t keep it to myself. My hope is to
disseminate it in a way that removes me as much as possible from the
equation. I don’t want to present the trademarked Dr. Greger Diet; I
want to present the best-available-evidence diet. That’s why I show the
original papers, charts, graphs, and quotes with links to all the
primary sources in my NutritionFacts.org videos. I try to keep my own
interpretation to a minimum—though admittedly, I sometimes can’t help
myself!</p>
<p>What a person chooses to do with information is highly personalized
and often depends on such factors as his or her current life situation
and how risk averse he or she is. Given the same information, two people
can make two entirely different but legitimate decisions. For this
reason, I’ve been hesitant to share my own personal choices, because I’m
afraid they’ll unduly sway people to make decisions that might not be
right for them. I’d rather just present the science and let others
decide for themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, everyone’s taste buds are different. I can imagine
someone thinking, He puts hot sauce on what? When people hear me talk
about the wonders of hummus (a Middle Eastern chickpea spread) but not
baba ganoush (a Middle Eastern roasted-eggplant spread), they might come
away with the impression that I think one is healthier than the other.
This may be (and probably is, actually), but my real reason is simple: I
don’t like the taste of eggplant.</p>
<p>Conversely, just because I eat something doesn’t mean it’s healthy.
For example, people are surprised to hear I use dutched
(alkali-processed) cocoa. In that process, more than half of the
antioxidants and flavanol phytonutrients are wiped out.50 Why would I
use it, then? Because it tastes so much better to me than unprocessed
cocoa. While I encourage people to use natural cocoa, I don’t take my
own advice in that regard. In some cases, it would be better if people
would do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>And what if I shared a recipe that someone found utterly repulsive? I
would hate for him or her to think, If this is healthy eating, count me
out! As you eat healthier, your palate actually changes. It’s an amazing
phenomenon. Your taste buds are constantly adapting—minute to minute, in
fact. If you drank some orange juice right now, it would taste sweet.
But if you first ate some candy and then drank the same OJ, it could
taste unpleasantly bitter. Over the long term, the more you eat
healthfully, the better healthy foods taste.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I sipped a green smoothie. I was speaking
somewhere in Michigan, hosted by a darling physician couple. They told
me that they drank “blended salads” for breakfast. Intellectually, I
loved the idea. Greens, the healthiest food on the planet, in convenient
liquid form? I envisioned myself drinking a salad on my way to work
every day. But then I tasted it. It felt like I was drinking someone’s
lawn. I gagged and almost threw up over my hosts’ kitchen table.</p>
<p>Green smoothies are something you have to build up to. Everyone loves
fruit smoothies. A frozen banana, strawberries—yum! And surprisingly,
you can throw a handful of baby spinach in there and you may hardly even
taste it. Give it a try! You’ll be surprised. Okay, so if one handful is
good, how about two? Slowly, your taste buds can adapt to increasing
quantities of greens. This happens with all your senses. Walk into a
dark room, and your eyes will slowly adapt. Stick your foot into a hot
bath, and though at first it may be too hot, your body equilibrates to a
new normal. Likewise, in just a couple of weeks, you can be drinking—and
enjoying—concoctions you’d now consider absolutely wretched.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I will now proceed to tell you what I eat, what
I drink, what I do, and how I do it. In each subsequent chapter, I will
dive deeper into each of the entries on my Daily Dozen checklist to
describe which types of these green-light foods are my favorites, as
well as the tricks and techniques I use to prepare them. I will not be
detailing every type of bean, fruit, vegetable, nut, or spice that I
eat. Rather, my goal here is to explore some of the interesting science
behind a few of my favorite options in each category.</p>
<p>Please understand that my strategy is a way to do it rather than the
way to do it. If it happens to work for you too, great. If not, I hope
you’ll explore the myriad other ways you could use this same body of
evidence to help improve and prolong your life.</p>
<p>Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen</p>
<p>Whole-food, plant-based nutrition—pretty self-explanatory, right? But
aren’t some green-light foods better than others? For example, you can
apparently live extended periods eating practically nothing but
potatoes.1 That would, by definition, be a whole-food, plant-based
diet—but not a very healthy one. All plant foods are not created
equal.</p>
<p>The more I’ve researched over the years, the more I’ve come to
realize that healthy foods are not necessary interchangeable. Some foods
and food groups have special nutrients not found in abundance elsewhere.
For example, sulforaphane, the amazing liver-enzyme detox-boosting
compound I profiled in chapters 9 and 11, is derived nearly exclusively
from cruciferous vegetables. You could eat tons of other kinds of greens
and vegetables on a given day and get no appreciable sulforaphane if you
didn’t eat something cruciferous. It’s the same with flaxseeds and the
anticancer lignan compounds. As I mentioned in chapters 11 and 13, flax
may average one hundred times more lignans than other foods. And
mushrooms aren’t even plants at all; they belong to an entirely
different biological classification and may contain nutrients (like
ergothioneine) not made anywhere in the plant kingdom.2 (So technically,
maybe I should be referring to a whole-food, plant- and fungus-based
diet, but that just sounds kind of gross.)</p>
<p>It seems like every time I come home from the medical library buzzing
with some exciting new data, my family rolls their eyes, sighs, and
asks, “What can’t we eat now?” Or they’ll say, “Wait a second. Why does
everything seem to have parsley in it all of a sudden?” My poor family.
They’ve been very tolerant.</p>
<p>As the list of foods I tried to fit into my daily diet grew, I made a
checklist and had it on a little dry-erase board on the fridge. We would
make a game out of ticking off the boxes. This evolved into the Daily
Dozen (see figure 6).</p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>By beans, I mean legumes, which comprise all the different kinds of
beans, including soybeans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils. While
eating a bowl of pea soup or dipping carrots into hummus may not seem
like eating beans, it is. You should try to get three servings a day. A
serving is defined as a quarter cup of hummus or bean dip; a half cup of
cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh; or a full cup of
fresh peas or sprouted lentils. Though peanuts are technically legumes,
nutritionally, I’ve grouped them in the Nuts category, just as I would
consider green (snap or string) beans to be better placed in the Other
Vegetables category.</p>
<p>A serving of berries is a half cup of fresh or frozen, or a quarter
cup of dried. While biologically speaking, avocados, bananas, and even
watermelons are technically berries, I’m using the colloquial term for
any small edible fruit, which is why I include kumquats and grapes (and
raisins) in this category, as well as fruits that are typically thought
of as berries but aren’t technically, such as blackberries, cherries,
mulberries, raspberries, and strawberries.</p>
<p>For other fruits, a serving is a medium-sized fruit, a cup of cut-up
fruit, or a quarter cup of dried fruit. Again, I’m using the colloquial
rather than the botanical definition, so I place tomatoes in the Other
Vegetables group. (Interestingly, this is something the U.S. Supreme
Court actually ruled on in 1893.3 Arkansas decided to have it both ways,
declaring tomatoes both the official state fruit and the official state
vegetable.4)</p>
<p>Common cruciferous vegetables include broccoli, cabbage, collards,
and kale. I recommend at least one serving a day (typically a half cup)
and at least two additional servings of greens a day, cruciferous or
otherwise. Serving sizes for other greens and vegetables are a cup for
raw leafy vegetables, a half cup for other raw or cooked vegetables, and
a quarter cup for dried mushrooms.</p>
<p>Everyone should try to incorporate one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds
into his or her daily diet, in addition to a serving of nuts or other
seeds. A quarter cup of nuts is considered a serving, or two tablespoons
of nut or seed butters, including peanut butter. (Chestnuts and coconuts
don’t nutritionally count as nuts.)</p>
<p>I also recommend one-quarter teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric,
along with any other (salt-free) herbs and spices you may enjoy.</p>
<p>A serving of whole grains can be considered a half cup of hot cereal
such as oatmeal, cooked grain such as rice (including the “pseudograins”
amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa), cooked pasta, or corn kernels; a cup
of ready-to-eat (cold) cereal; one tortilla or slice of bread; half a
bagel or english muffin; or three cups of popped popcorn.</p>
<p>The serving size in the beverage category is one glass (twelve
ounces), and the recommended five glasses a day is in addition to the
water you get naturally from the foods in your diet.</p>
<p>Finally, I advise one daily “serving” of exercise, which can be split
up over the day. I recommend ninety minutes of moderate-intensity
activity, such as brisk (four miles per hour) walking or forty minutes
of vigorous activity (such as jogging or active sports) each day. Why so
much? I’ll explain my reasoning in the Exercise chapter.</p>
<p>This may all sound like a lot of boxes to check, but it’s not
difficult to knock off a bunch at one time. One simple peanut butter and
banana sandwich and you just checked off four boxes. Or imagine sitting
down to a big salad. Two cups of spinach, a handful of arugula, a
handful of toasted walnuts, a half cup of chickpeas, a half cup of red
bell pepper, and a small tomato. You just knocked out seven boxes in one
dish. Sprinkle on your flax, add a handful of goji berries, and enjoy it
with a glass of water and fruit for dessert, and you could wipe out
nearly half your daily check boxes in a single meal. And then if you ate
it on a treadmill … just kidding!</p>
<p>Do I check off each glass of water I drink? No. In fact, I don’t even
use the checklist anymore; I just used it initially as a tool to get me
into a routine. Whenever I was sitting down to a meal, I would ask
myself, Could I add greens to this? Could I add beans to that? (I always
have an open can of beans in the fridge.) Can I sprinkle on some flax or
pumpkin seeds, or maybe some dried fruit? The checklist just got me into
the habit of thinking, How can I make this meal even healthier?</p>
<p>I also found the checklist helped with grocery shopping. Although I
always keep bags of frozen berries and greens in the freezer, if I’m at
the store and want to buy fresh produce for the week, it helps me figure
out how much kale or blueberries I need.</p>
<p>The checklist also helps me picture what a meal might look like.
Looking over the checklist, you’ll see there are three servings each of
beans, fruits, and whole grains, and about twice as many veggies in
total than any other food component. Glancing at my plate, I can imagine
one quarter of it filled with grains, one quarter with legumes, and a
half plate filled with vegetables, along with maybe a side salad and
fruit for dessert. I prefer one-bowl meals where everything’s mixed
together, but the checklist still helps me to visualize. Instead of a
big bowl of spaghetti with some veggies and lentils on top, I think of a
big bowl of vegetables with some pasta and lentils mixed in. Instead of
a big plate of brown rice with some stir-fried vegetables on top, I
picture a meal that’s mostly veggies—and oh look! There’s some rice and
beans in there too.</p>
<p>But there is no need to be obsessive about the Daily Dozen. On hectic
travel days when I’ve burned through my snacks and I’m trying to piece
together some semblance of a healthy meal at the airport food court,
sometimes I’m lucky if I even hit a quarter of my goals. If you eat
poorly on one day, just try to eat better the next. My hope is that the
checklist will serve you as a helpful reminder to try to eat a variety
of the healthiest foods every day.</p>
<p>But should you eat your veggies raw or cooked? Do you need to choose
organic or is conventional okay? What about GMOs? Gluten? All these
questions and more will be answered as I go through each of the Daily
Dozen in detail in the following chapters.</p>
<p>Beans</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Beans</p>
<p>Black beans, black-eyed peas, butter beans, cannellini beans,
chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans), edamame, english peas, great
northern beans, kidney beans, lentils (beluga, french, and red
varieties), miso, navy beans, pinto beans, small red beans, split peas
(yellow or green), and tempeh</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>¼ cup of hummus or bean dip</p>
<p>½ cup cooked beans, split peas, lentils, tofu, or tempeh</p>
<p>1 cup of fresh peas or sprouted lentils</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>3 servings per day</p>
<hr />
<p>The federal government’s MyPlate campaign was developed to prompt
Americans to think about building healthy meals. Most of your plate
should be covered with vegetables and grains, preferably whole grains,
with the rest of the plate split between fruits and the protein group.
Legumes were given special treatment, straddling both the protein and
the vegetable groups. They’re loaded with protein, iron, and zinc, as
you might expect from other protein sources like meat, but legumes also
contain nutrients that are concentrated in the vegetable kingdom,
including fiber, folate, and potassium. You get the best of both worlds
with beans, all the while enjoying foods that are naturally low in
saturated fat and sodium and free of cholesterol.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive analysis of diet and cancer ever performed was
published in 2007 by the American Institute for Cancer Research. Sifting
through some half a million studies, nine independent research teams
from around the globe created a landmark scientific consensus report
reviewed by twenty-one of the top cancer researchers in the world. One
of their summary cancer-prevention recommendations is to eat whole
grains and/or legumes (beans, split peas, chickpeas, or lentils) with
every meal.1 Not every week or every day. Every meal!</p>
<p>Having some oatmeal in the morning makes it easy enough to fulfill
the whole grains recommendation, but legumes? Who eats beans for
breakfast? Well, lots of people around the world do. A traditional
English breakfast includes savory combinations of baked beans on toast,
mushrooms, and grilled tomatoes. Japanese breakfasts traditionally
include miso soup, and many children in India start their days with
idli, a type of steamed lentil cake. More familiar ways for American
palates to meet the cancer prevention guidelines might be a whole-grain
bagel schmeared with hummus. My friend Paul mashes cannellini beans into
his oatmeal and swears you can’t even see or taste them. Why not?</p>
<p>Soy</p>
<p>Soybeans are probably the beans Americans are most comfortable
incorporating into their breakfasts. Soy milk, for instance, has grown
into a billion-dollar business. But soy milk and even tofu are processed
foods. When it comes to the nutrients you tend to associate with
legumes—fiber, iron, magnesium, potassium, protein, and zinc—about half
are lost when soybeans are converted into tofu. However, beans are so
healthy that you can throw away half the nutrition and still have a
really healthy food. If you do eat tofu, choose varieties made with
calcium (you’ll see it in the ingredients list), which can weigh in at a
whopping 550 mg of calcium per (3 oz) slice.2</p>
<p>Even better than tofu, though, would be a whole soy food like tempeh,
which is a type of fermented soybean patty. If you look closely at
tempeh, you can actually see all the little soybeans. I don’t usually
eat tempeh for breakfast, but I do like to slice it thin, dip it into a
thick flax “egg” mixture (see here for my recipe), dredge it through
some rosemary-seasoned whole-grain bread crumbs or coarse blue cornmeal,
and bake it in my toaster oven at about 400°F until golden brown. Then I
dip it in buffalo hot sauce for a healthier approximation of the chicken
wings I enjoyed in my youth.</p>

<p>What About GMO Soy?</p>
<p>A prominent scientific journal recently editorialized that although
we are now swimming in information about genetically modified crops,
much of what we’re being told is wrong—from both sides of the debate.
“But a lot of this incorrect information is sophisticated, backed by
legitimate-sounding research and written with certitude,” the editorial
read, quipping that when it comes to GMOs, a good gauge of a statement’s
fallacy may be “the conviction with which it is delivered.”3</p>
<p>Monsanto’s Roundup Ready soybeans are the number-one genetically
modified crop, engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Roundup (also
sold by Monsanto), which allows farmers to spray the crops to kill weeds
while leaving the soy standing.4</p>
<p>Though much debate continues to swarm around the hypothetical risks
of GMO crops, the greater concern for human health may be the potential
for GMO crops to contain elevated pesticide residues.5 This fear was
realized in 2014 when high levels of Roundup pesticides were reported on
GMO soybeans (but not on non-GMO or organic soybeans).6 The pesticide
levels were considered high compared to maximum allowable residue levels
at the time, but were they high enough to have adverse effects on
consumers?</p>
<p>Anti-GMO activists point to studies showing Roundup may interfere
with embryonic development and disrupt hormones. These studies were,
respectively, on sea urchin embryos7 and cells from mouse testicles.8
Blogs scream headlines like “Men! Save Your Testicles,” citing articles
with concerning names like “Prepubertal Exposure to Commercial
Formulation of the Herbicide Glyphosate Alters Testosterone Levels and
Testicular Morphology.”9 But that study was about puberty in rats. I
doubt the blog would have gotten as many hits if it had been titled
“Men! Save Prepubescent Rats’ Testicles!”10</p>
<p>Am I being too harsh? After all, where could scientists find live
human tissue to experiment on? A research team came up with a brilliant
solution—study placentas! Millions of women in the United States give
birth each year, and the placenta, the temporary organ formed in the
uterus to nourish the fetus during pregnancy, is typically incinerated
after delivery. Why not test Roundup on human placental tissue? The
researchers did so and found that at the concentration that’s sprayed on
crops in the fields, the pesticides did indeed have toxic effects on
human tissue.11</p>
<p>That finding may help explain the few tentative studies suggesting
adverse effects on pesticide workers12,13 and their children,14 but by
the time the pesticides enter the food supply, they are highly diluted.
Concentrations of Roundup pesticides may only reach a few parts per
million in food and a few parts per billion in your body. Researchers,
however, discovered the pesticide may still have effects at a few parts
per trillion. Even at that minuscule dose, Roundup pesticides were found
to have estrogenic effects in vitro, stimulating the growth of
estrogen-receptor-positive human breast cancer cells.15</p>
<p>As we saw in chapter 11, though, soy consumption is associated with
lower breast cancer risk and improved breast cancer survival. That may
be because most GMO soy in the United States is used as feed for
chickens, pigs, and cattle, whereas most of the major soy food
manufacturers use non-GMO soy. It could also be because the benefits of
eating any kind of soy far outweigh the risks. Regardless, why accept
any risk at all when you can choose organic soy products, which by law
exclude GMOs?</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there is no direct human data suggesting any
harm from eating GMO crops, though such studies haven’t been done (which
critics say is exactly the point).16 That’s why mandatory labeling on
GMO products would be helpful, so that public health researchers can
track whether or not GMOs are having any adverse effects.</p>
<p>But I believe it is important to put the GMO issue in perspective. As
I’ve tried to show, there are dietary and lifestyle changes we can make
that could eliminate most heart disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer.
Millions of lives could be saved. For this reason, I’m sympathetic to
the biotech industry’s exasperation about GMO concerns when we still
have people dropping dead from everything else they’re eating.17 As one
review concluded: “Consumption of genetically modified food entails risk
of undesirable effects similar to the consumption of traditional
food.”18 In other words, buying the non-GMO Twinkie isn’t doing your
body much good.</p>
<hr />
<p>Miso is another fermented whole soy food. This thick paste is
commonly mixed with hot water to make a delicious soup that’s a staple
in Japanese cuisine. If you want to give it a try, I suggest white miso,
which has a mellower flavor than red miso. Making miso soup can be as
easy as mixing one tablespoon of miso with two cups of hot water and
whatever vegetables you prefer. That’s it!</p>
<p>Because miso may contain probiotic bacteria,19 it’s probably best not
to actually cook the miso, lest the good bugs be wiped out. When I
prepare it, I boil dried mushrooms, a pinch of arame seaweed, a few
sun-dried tomatoes, and greens in a pot and ladle off about a quarter
cup of hot broth into a large bowl, add the miso, and mash it with a
fork until only a thin paste remains. I then pour the rest of the soup
into the bowl and stir to combine it with the miso. And, because I’m a
bit of a hot-sauce freak, I add some Sriracha for a little kick. My new
favorite addition is freshly toasted sesame seeds. I pour out a layer of
raw, hulled sesame seeds, put them in the toaster oven until they just
start to turn golden, and then throw them sizzling into the soup. Makes
the whole kitchen smell heavenly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Miso Soup: Soy Versus Sodium</p>
<p>The process of producing miso involves adding salt—lots of salt. A
single bowl of miso soup could contain half the American Heart
Association’s recommended daily limit, which is why I always reflexively
avoided it when I’d see it on a menu. But when I actually looked into
it, I was surprised by what I found.</p>
<p>There are two principal reasons to avoid salt: stomach cancer and
high blood pressure. Considered a “probable cause” of stomach cancer,20
excess salt intake may cause thousands of cases every year in the United
States.21 The elevated stomach cancer risk associated with salt intake
appears on par with that of smoking or heavy alcohol use but may only be
half as bad as opium use22 or a daily serving of meat. A study of nearly
a half-million people found that a daily portion of meat (about the size
of a deck of cards) was associated with up to five times the odds of
stomach cancer.23</p>
<p>This may explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to be at
significantly lower risk.24 But it’s not just sodium-rich animal
products like processed meats and salted fish that are associated with
higher stomach cancer risk—pickled plant foods are as well.25 Kimchi, a
spicy pickled vegetable side dish, is a staple in Korean cuisine and
could help explain why that country may have the highest stomach cancer
rates in the world.26</p>
<p>Miso, however, was not associated with increased cancer risk.27 The
carcinogenic effects of the salt may be counteracted by the
anticarcinogenic effects of the soy. For example, tofu intake has been
associated with about 50 percent less stomach cancer risk28 and salt
with about 50 percent more risk,29 which explains how they may
effectively cancel each other out. Further protection apparently offered
by allium (onion) family vegetables30 may tip the cancer-fighting scale
in favor of miso soup that’s garlicky or has some scallions thrown
in.</p>
<p>Cancer isn’t the primary reason people are told to avoid salt,
though. What about miso soup and high blood pressure? There may be a
similar relationship. The salt in miso may push up your blood pressure
while the soy protein in miso may lower it back down.31 For example, if
you compare the effects of soy milk to skim milk (to make a fairer
comparison by removing the saturated butterfat factor), soy milk lowers
blood pressure about nine times more effectively than skim dairy milk.32
Would the benefits of soy be enough to counter the effects of the salt
in miso, though? Japanese researchers decided to find out.</p>
<p>Over a four-year period, they tracked men and women in their sixties
who started out with normal blood pressures to see who was more likely
to be diagnosed with high blood pressure: those who had two or more
bowls of miso soup a day or those who had one or less. Two bowls a day
would be like adding half a teaspoon of salt to your daily diet, yet
those who consumed at least that much miso were found to have five times
lower risk of becoming hypertensive. The researchers concluded: “Our
results on miso-soup have shown that [the] anti-hypertensive effect of
miso is possibly above [the] hypertensive effect of salt.”33 So miso
soup may actually be protective overall.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edamame is about as whole a soy food as you can get. After all, these
are soybeans still in their pods. You can buy them frozen and just throw
a handful into some boiling water anytime you want a healthy snack. They
cook in about five minutes. All you need to do is strain them and, if
you’re like me, crack lots of fresh pepper onto the pods and nibble the
beans right out. (You can also buy them pre-shelled, but then they’re
not as fun to eat.)</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the processing spectrum are plant-based meat
alternatives like veggie burgers, which are healthy only insofar as they
replace the real thing. Beyond Chicken, for example, has fiber, zero
saturated fat, zero cholesterol, and equal protein to and fewer calories
than an actual chicken breast (plus presumably less food-poisoning
risk). But Beyond Chicken pales in comparison to the nutrition found in
the soybeans, yellow peas, and amaranth grain from which it was made. Of
course, people choosing these meat alternatives are not standing in the
grocery store agonizing between Beyond Chicken Grilled Strips and a bowl
of legumes and whole grains. So if fajitas are the foregone conclusion,
then it would certainly be healthier to choose the plant-based mock meat
to the meat itself. I see the value of these meat-alternative products
as healthier transition foods to wean people off the standard American
diet. Even if you just stopped there, you’d be better off, but the more
you can move toward whole-food nutrition, the better. You don’t want to
get stuck at the yellow light.</p>
<p>Peas</p>
<p>Like edamame, raw english peas (also known as shell or garden peas)
can be a great au naturel snack. I fell in love with peas in the pod
when I first picked them off the vine at a farm my brother and I spent
time on one summer as kids. They were like candy. Every year, I look
forward to the few weeks I can find them fresh.</p>
<p>Lentils</p>
<p>Lentils are little lens-shaped legumes. (Lenses were actually named
after lentils; lens is lentil in Latin.) They gained fame in 1982 upon
the discovery of the “lentil effect,” or the ability of lentil
consumption to blunt the sugar spike of foods consumed hours later at a
subsequent meal.34 Lentils are so rich in prebiotics that they create a
feast for your friendly flora, which in turn feed you right back with
beneficial compounds, such as propionate, that relax your stomach and
slow the rate at which sugars are absorbed into your system.35 Chickpeas
and other legumes were found to have a similar influence, and so this
phenomenon was later renamed the “second-meal effect.”36</p>
<p>Lentils are already one of the most nutrient-dense legumes. But when
sprouted, their antioxidant power doubles (and even quintuples for
chickpeas).37 Lentils can be easily sprouted into one of the healthiest
possible snacks. I was amazed when I first tried making them. What start
out looking like hard little pebbles transform into tender morsels in
just a couple of days. Why add protein powder to your smoothies when you
can add sprouted lentils? In a sprouting jar, or simply a mason jar
covered with cheesecloth secured with a rubber band, soak lentils
overnight in water, drain, and then rinse and drain twice daily for
another couple of days. Sprouting to me is like gardening on steroids—I
can create fresh produce in three days right on my kitchen counter. (Of
course, if you open a can of lentils, you can enjoy them in about three
seconds.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Are Canned Beans as Healthy as Home Cooked?</p>
<p>Canned beans are convenient, but are they as nutritious as home
cooked? A recent study discovered that indeed canned beans are as
healthy as boiled beans—with one exception: sodium. Salt is often added
to canned beans, resulting in sodium levels up to one hundred times more
than if you cooked them without any salt.38 Draining and rinsing your
canned beans can remove about half the added salt, but then you’d also
be rinsing away some of the nutrition. I recommend purchasing the
no-salt-added varieties and cooking with the bean liquid in whatever
dish you’re whipping up.</p>
<p>Home-cooked beans may come out tastier, particularly texture-wise.
Canned beans can sometimes be a bit mushy, whereas when properly soaked
and cooked, beans can come out nice and firm yet tender. Using dried
beans is also cheaper. Some bean-counting researchers found that canned
beans can be about three times as expensive as home cooked, but the
difference only came out to about twenty cents per serving.39 My family
chooses to spend that extra twenty cents to save the hours beans can
take to cook.</p>
<p>The only legumes I have the patience to cook from scratch are
lentils. They cook quickly and don’t need to be presoaked. You can just
simmer them as you would pasta, in a pot with an abundance of water, for
about half an hour. In fact, if you’re making pasta and have the time,
why not let some lentils boil in the water for twenty minutes before
adding in the pasta? Lentils are great in spaghetti sauce. That’s what I
do when I make rice or quinoa: I throw a handful of dried lentils into
the rice cooker, and they’re done when the grain is cooked. Mashed and
seasoned cooked lentils also make a great veggie dip. Double check
marks!</p>
<hr />
<p>Dipping veggies in hummus is a double-check-box snack. And don’t
forget other bean blending, from garlicky white bean spreads and pinto
pâtés to spicy black bean dip. Another fantastic snack (can you tell I
love snacking?) is roasted chickpeas. Google it. My favorite, not
surprisingly, is the buffalo ranch flavor (from the Kid Tested
Firefighter Approved blog40), using a silicone baking mat.</p>
<p>Mealtime options can include dishes like bean burritos; chili; pasta
e fagioli; red beans and rice; minestrone; Tuscan white bean stew; and
black bean, lentil, or split pea soup. My mom turned me on to dehydrated
precooked pea soup mixes. (The lowest sodium brand I’ve been able to
find is from Dr. John McDougall’s food line.) You simply add the mix to
boiling water with some frozen greens and stir. (Whole Foods Market
sells inexpensive one-pound frozen bags of a prechopped blend of kale,
collard, and mustard greens. Couldn’t be easier!) I pack pea soup mix
when I travel. It’s lightweight, and I can prepare it in the hotel room
coffeemaker.</p>
<hr />
<p>Big Bucks on Beans’ Benefits</p>
<p>For more than a decade, soy foods have enjoyed the rare privilege of
an “FDA-approved” food-label health claim about soy’s ability to protect
against heart disease. A billion-dollar industry, Big Soy has a lot of
money to fund research touting the benefits of their bean. But is soy
really the top bean, or are other legumes just as powerful? It turns out
that non-soy beans, including lentils, lima beans, navy beans, and pinto
beans, drop bad cholesterol levels41 as effectively as soy protein.42
One study, for example, found that eating a half a cup a day of cooked
pinto beans for two months may drop your cholesterol by nineteen
points.43</p>
<hr />
<p>One of my favorite go-to quickie meals starts with toasting some corn
tortillas. (Food for Life, the same company that makes Ezekiel bread,
makes a sprouted yellow corn tortilla usually sold in the frozen
section.) Then I mash some canned beans on them with a fork and add a
spoonful or two of jarred salsa. All the better if I have fresh
cilantro, salad greens, or avocado to top it all off. If I’m lucky
enough to have fresh collard greens, I’ll steam a few leaves and use
them as burrito wraps to replace the tortillas. We call them
collardritos in our house. Greens and beans—can’t get healthier than
that!</p>
<p>Any leguminous dessert options? Three words: black-bean brownies. I
don’t have a recipe of my own, but if you poke around online, you’ll
find many good ones, including the one Dr. Joel Fuhrman shared on The
Dr. Oz Show, which uses almond butter as the green-light source of fat
and dates as the green-light source of sugar.44</p>
<p>Mostly, I just add beans to whatever I happen to be making. I try to
always keep an open can front and center in the fridge as a reminder. We
buy black beans by the case. (Black beans appear to have more phenolic
phytonutrients than other common legumes,45 but the best bean is
probably whichever one you’ll eat the most of!)</p>
<p>Clearing the Air About Beans and Gas</p>
<p>Beans, beans. Good for your heart. The more you eat ’em, the … longer
you live? Legumes have been found to be “the most important predictor of
survival in older people”46 around the globe. Whether it was the
Japanese eating soy products, the Swedes eating brown beans and peas, or
those in the Mediterranean region eating lentils, chickpeas, and white
beans, legume intake was consistently associated with a longer life
span. Researchers found an 8 percent reduction in risk of premature
death for every twenty-gram increase in daily legume intake—that’s
barely two tablespoons’ worth!47</p>
<p>So why aren’t more people taking advantage of this dietary “fountain
of youth”? Fear of flatulence.48 Is that really the choice you’re left
with, then? Breaking wind or breaking down? Passing gas or passing
on?</p>
<p>Are the concerns about the gassiness of beans just a bunch of hot
air?</p>
<p>When researchers tried adding a half cup of beans to people’s diets,
the majority experienced no symptoms at all. Even among people who did
get gassy, 70 percent or more reported that it diminished by the second
or third week of the study. The researchers concluded: “People’s
concerns about excessive flatulence from eating beans may be
exaggerated.”49</p>
<p>Flatulence may be more common than you think. Americans report
passing gas an average of fourteen times a day,50 with the normal range
extending up to twenty-three times daily.51 Flatulence comes from two
places: swallowed air and fermentation in the bowel. Factors that might
cause you to swallow extra air include chewing gum, wearing ill-fitting
dentures, sucking on hard candies, drinking through a straw, eating too
fast, talking while you eat, and smoking cigarettes. So, if the fear of
lung cancer doesn’t get you to quit smoking, maybe fear of flatulence
will.</p>
<p>The main source of gas, though, is the normal bacterial fermentation
in the colon of undigested sugars. Dairy products are a leading cause of
excessive flatulence,52 which is due to poor digestion of the milk sugar
lactose.53 One of the most flatulent patients ever reported in the
medical literature was effectively cured once all dairy products were
removed from his diet. The case, reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine and submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records, involved a
man who, after consuming dairy, experienced “70 passages in one
four-hour period.”54 Cutting the cheese, indeed.</p>
<p>Long term, most people bulking up on high-fiber plant foods do not
appear to have significantly increased problems with gas.55 The buoyancy
of floating stools from trapped gases can in fact be seen as a sign of
adequate fiber intake.56 The indigestible sugars in beans that make it
down to your colon may even function as prebiotics to feed your good
bacteria and make for a healthier colon.</p>
<p>Even if at first they make you gassy, beans are so health promoting
that you should experiment with ways to keep them in your diet at all
costs. Lentils, split peas, and canned beans tend to produce less gas,
and tofu isn’t usually an offender. Repeated soakings of dried beans in
water containing a quarter teaspoon of baking soda per gallon57 and
tossing out the cooking water may help if you boil your own beans. Of
the spices that have been tested, cloves, cinnamon, and garlic seem to
be the most gas reducing, followed by turmeric (but only if uncooked),
pepper, and ginger.58 If worse comes to worst, there are cheap
supplements that contain alpha-galactosidase, an enzyme shown to break
up the bean sugars and take the sail out of your wind.59</p>
<p>Odor is a separate issue. The smell appears to come primarily from
the digestion of sulfur-rich foods. So to cut down on the stench,
experts have recommended cutting back on such foods as meat and eggs.60
(Hydrogen sulfide is called “rotten egg gas” for a reason.) This may be
why people who eat meat regularly were found to generate as much as
fifteen times the sulfides as those eating plant-based diets.61</p>
<p>There are healthy sulfur-rich foods, such as garlic and cauliflower.
If you’re about to embark on a long trip in a confined space after a big
meal of aloo gobi, Pepto-Bismol and generic equivalents can act as a
windbreaker by binding up the sulfur in your gut to eliminate odors. But
this should be used only as a short-term solution due to the potential
for bismuth toxicity with chronic use.62</p>
<p>Then there are the high-tech solutions, such as carbon-fiber,
odor-eating underwear (cost: 5), which were put to the test in a series
of studies that included such gems as “Utilizing gas-tight Mylar
pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal-lined cushion to absorb
sulfur-containing gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was
assessed.”63 The name of the charcoal-lined cushion? The “Toot
Trapper.”</p>
<p>The bottom line: Intestinal gas is normal and healthy. No less an
expert than Hippocrates himself was attributed as saying, “Passing gas
is necessary to well-being.”64 In a review of degassing drugs and
devices, Dr. John Fardy, a chair of gastroenterology, wrote: “Perhaps
increased tolerance of flatus would be a better solution, for we tamper
with harmless natural phenomena at our peril.”65 And, yes, Dr. Fardy is
his real name.</p>
<hr />
<p>Legume consumption is associated with a slimmer waist and lower blood
pressure, and randomized trials have shown it can match or beat out
calorie cutting for slimming tummy fat as well as improving the
regulation of blood sugar, insulin levels, and cholesterol. Beans are
packed with fiber, folate, and phytates, which may help reduce the risk
of stroke, depression, and colon cancer. The phytoestrogens in soy in
particular appear to both help prevent breast cancer and improve breast
cancer survival. No wonder the cancer guidelines suggest you should try
to fit beans into your meals—and it’s so easy! They can be added to
nearly any meal, easily incorporated into snack times, or served as the
star attraction. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Berries</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Berries</p>
<p>Açai berries, barberries, blackberries, blueberries, cherries (sweet
or tart), concord grapes, cranberries, goji berries, kumquats,
mulberries, raspberries (black or red), and strawberries</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>½ cup fresh or frozen</p>
<p>¼ cup dried</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>1 serving per day</p>
<hr />
<p>The case for berries has been made throughout this book. Berries
offer potential protection against cancer (chapters 4 and 11), a boost
to the immune system (chapter 5), and a guard for the liver (chapter 8)
and brain (chapters 3 and 14). An American Cancer Society study of
nearly one hundred thousand men and women found that those who ate the
most berries appeared significantly less likely to die of cardiovascular
disease.1</p>
<p>Wait a second—tastes great and may help you live longer? Yes. That’s
what plant-based eating is all about.</p>
<p>Greens are the healthiest vegetables, and berries are the healthiest
fruits—in part due to their respective plant pigments. Leaves contain
the green pigment chlorophyll, which sets off the firestorm of
photosynthesis, so greens have to be packed with antioxidants to deal
with the charged high-energy electrons that are formed. (Remember
superoxide from chapter 3?) Meanwhile, berries evolved to have bright,
contrasting colors to attract fruit-eating critters to help disperse
their seeds. And the same molecular characteristics that give berries
such vibrant colors may account for some of their antioxidant
abilities.2</p>
<p>Americans eat a lot of pale and beige foods: white bread, white
pasta, white potatoes, white rice. Colorful foods are often healthier
because they contain antioxidant pigments, whether it’s the
beta-carotene that makes carrots and sweet potatoes orange, the lycopene
antioxidant pigment that makes tomatoes red, or the anthocyanin pigments
that make blueberries blue. The colors are the antioxidants. That
knowledge alone should revolutionize your stroll down the produce
aisle.</p>
<p>Guess which have more antioxidants—red onions or white onions? You
don’t need to look up the answer. You can see the difference with your
own eyes. (Indeed, red onions have 76 percent more antioxidant capacity
than white, with yellow onions in between.3) So, given the choice, why
buy another white onion ever again?</p>
<p>Red cabbage may contain eight times more antioxidants than green
cabbage,4 which is why you’ll never find a green cabbage in my
house.</p>
<p>Pop quiz: Which wipes out more free radicals—pink grapefruit or
regular grapefruit? Granny Smith or Red Delicious? Iceberg lettuce or
romaine? Red grapes or green? Yellow corn or white corn? See, you don’t
need me to go to the grocery store with you. You can make all these
calls yourself.</p>
<p>What about a purple-skinned eggplant or a white-skinned eggplant?
Trick question! Remember, the pigment is the antioxidant, so the color
of the skin doesn’t matter if you peel it off. As we learned in chapter
11, that’s why you never want to peel apples. It’s for this same reason
kumquats may be the healthiest citrus fruit, since you can eat them rind
and all.</p>
<p>Shop for the reddest of strawberries, the blackest of blackberries,
the most scarlet tomato, the darkest green broccoli you can find. The
colors are the antiaging, anticancer antioxidants.</p>
<p>Antioxidant content is one of the reasons I’ve singled out berries
for special treatment. They are second only to herbs and spices as the
most antioxidant-packed food category. As a group, they average nearly
ten times more antioxidants than other fruits and vegetables (and exceed
fifty times more than animal-based foods).5</p>
<p>The Antioxidant Power of Berries</p>
<p>As with other green-light foods, the healthiest variety is the one
you’ll eat most often, but if you have no particular preference, why not
put the berry with the most antioxidants in your morning oatmeal? Thanks
to a study that compared more than a hundred different berries and berry
products, we now know which one that is.6</p>
<p>America’s favorite fruits are apples and bananas, with antioxidant
power of about 60 units and 40 units, respectively. Mangos, the
preferred fruit around the world outside of the United States, have even
more antioxidant punch at around 110 units. (It makes sense when you
consider how much more colorful they are on the inside.) But none of
these fruits are a match for berries. Strawberries weigh in at about 310
units per cup, cranberries at 330, raspberries at 350, blueberries at
380 (though wild blueberries may have twice as much7), and blackberries
at a whopping 650 units. Above even those are exotic types you can pick
wild in the Arctic tundra, like red whortleberries. (They sound like
something from a Dr. Seuss book!) But in terms of what you can find
readily in the store, it’s blackberries for the win. (I share my
whole-fruit cocktail recipe for using one of the runners-up,
cranberries, here.) I’m happy as long as you’re eating a serving of any
type of berry every day, but in terms of antioxidant content, choosing
blackberries over strawberries appears to give you twice the bang for
your berry.8</p>
<hr />
<p>What About All the Sugar in Fruit?</p>
<p>There are a few popular diets out there that urge people to stop
eating fruits because their natural sugars (fructose) are thought to
contribute to weight gain. The truth is, only fructose from added sugars
appears to be associated with declining liver function,9 high blood
pressure, and weight gain.10 How could the fructose in sugar be bad but
the same fructose in fruit be harmless? Think about the difference
between a sugar cube and a sugar beet. (Beets are the primary source of
sugar in the United States.11) In nature, fructose comes prepackaged
with the fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients that appear to nullify
adverse fructose effects.12</p>
<p>Studies show that if you drink a glass of water with three
tablespoons of sugar (similar to what would be in a can of soda), you’ll
have a big spike in your blood sugar levels within the first hour. That
causes your body to release so much insulin to mop up the excess sugar
that you actually overshoot and become hypoglycemic by the second hour,
meaning that your blood sugar drops even lower than it would if you were
fasting. Your body detects this low blood sugar, thinks you might be in
some sort of famine situation, and responds by dumping fat into your
bloodstream as an energy source to keep you alive.13 This excess fat in
the blood can then go on to cause further problems. (See chapter 6.)</p>
<p>But what if you eat a cup of blended berries in addition to the
sugar? The berries, of course, have sugars of their own—an additional
tablespoon’s worth—so the blood sugar spike should be even worse, right?
Actually, no. Study participants who ate berries with their cup of sugar
water showed no additional blood sugar spike and no hypoglycemic dip
afterward; their blood sugar levels merely went up and down, and there
was no surge of fat into the blood.14</p>
<p>Consuming sugar in fruit form is not only harmless but actually
helpful. Eating berries can blunt the insulin spike from high-glycemic
foods like white bread, for example.15 This may be because the fiber in
fruit has a gelling effect in your stomach and small intestine that
slows the release of sugars16 or because of certain phytonutrients in
fruit that appear to block the absorption of sugar through the gut wall
and into your bloodstream.17 So eating fructose the way nature intended
carries benefits rather than risks.</p>
<p>Low-dose fructose may actually benefit blood sugar control. Eating a
piece of fruit with each meal could be expected to lower, rather than
raise, the blood sugar response.18 What about people with type 2
diabetes? Diabetics randomized into a group restricted to no more than
two daily pieces of fruit had no better blood sugar control than those
randomized into a group told to eat a minimum of two pieces of fruit per
day. The researchers concluded that “the intake of fruit should not be
restricted in patients with type 2 diabetes.”19</p>
<p>Surely there must be some level of fructose consumption that’s
harmful even when served in Mother Nature’s green-light form, right?
Apparently not.</p>
<p>Seventeen people were asked to eat twenty servings of fruit per day
for months. Despite the extraordinarily high fructose content of this
fruit-based diet—the sugar equivalent of about eight cans of soda a
day—the investigators reported beneficial outcomes with no overall
adverse effects for body weight, blood pressure,20 insulin, cholesterol,
and triglyceride levels.21 More recently, the research group who
invented the glycemic index found that feeding subjects a fruit-,
vegetable-, and nut-based diet that included about twenty servings of
fruit per day for a couple of weeks had no adverse effects on weight,
blood pressure, or triglycerides—all while lowering LDL (“bad”)
cholesterol by an astounding thirty-eight points.22</p>
<p>Cholesterol lowering was not the only record broken: Participants
were asked to eat forty-three servings of vegetables a day in addition
to the fruit, the result of which was that the researchers recorded the
largest-ever bowel movements documented in a dietary intervention.23</p>
<hr />
<p>Are frozen berries as nutritious as fresh ones? Studies on
cherries,24 raspberries,25 and strawberries26 suggest that most of their
nutrition is retained even when frozen. I usually opt for frozen berries
since they last longer, are available year round, and tend to be
cheaper. If you looked in our freezer right now, you’d see it’s about
half frozen greens and half frozen berries. What do I do with those
berries? Make ice cream, of course.</p>
<p>The favored dessert in our home is soft-serve “ice cream” made by
blending frozen fruit. You whip up frozen fruit in a blender, food
processor, or juicer, and voilà! Instant all-fruit ice cream. You have
to taste it to believe it. The simplest recipe has one ingredient:
frozen bananas. Peel and freeze some ripe bananas (the riper, the
better—I’m talking brown). Once frozen, throw them in a food processor
and blend. They transform into a smooth, light, fluffy dessert cheaper,
healthier, and tastier than anything you might get in a trendy frozen
yogurt shop.</p>
<p>Of course making berry ice cream or at least a berry-banana mix is
even healthier. My favorite is chocolate. To make it, blend dark, sweet
cherries or strawberries mixed with a tablespoon of cocoa power, a
splash of a milk of your choice (more if you want a milkshake), a capful
of vanilla extract, and some pitted dates. If you didn’t yet get your
nuts for the day, you can add some almond butter. Either way, you get an
instant, decadent, chocolate dessert so nutritious that the more you
eat, the healthier you are. Let me repeat that: The more you eat, the
healthier you are. That’s my kind of ice cream!</p>
<p>Tart Cherries</p>
<p>Research dating back half a century suggests tart cherries are so
anti-inflammatory that they can be used to successfully treat a painful
type of arthritis called gout.27 Delicious dietary treatments are much
welcomed, as some gout drugs can cost ,000 a dose,28 carry no clear-cut
distinction between nontoxic, toxic, and lethal doses,29 or can cause a
rare side effect in which your skin detaches from your body.30 Of
course, the best way to deal with gout is to try to prevent it in the
first place with a more plant-based diet.31</p>
<p>Cherries can reduce the level of inflammation among healthy people
too (as measured by a drop in C-reactive protein levels),32 so I was
excited to find a green-light source available year-round—a canned
product with only two ingredients: cherries and water. I drain off the
liquid (which then goes into my hibiscus punch recipe here) and mix the
cherries in a bowl of cooked oatmeal along with cocoa powder and pumpkin
seeds. If you sweeten it with date sugar or erythritol (see here), it’s
like eating chocolate-covered cherries for breakfast.</p>
<p>A note of caution: For the same reason that high doses of
anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin should be avoided during the
third trimester of pregnancy, cocoa, berries, and other foods high in
anti-inflammatory polyphenols should only be eaten in moderation in late
pregnancy.33</p>
<p>Goji Berries</p>
<p>Tart cherries naturally contain melatonin and have been used to
improve sleep without any side effects.34 Goji berries, however, have
the highest concentrations of melatonin.35 Gojis have the third-highest
antioxidant capacity of any common dried fruit—five times more than
raisins and second only to dried pomegranate seeds and barberries (a
fruit commonly found in Middle Eastern markets and spice stores).36
Gojis also have a specific antioxidant pigment that makes corn
yellow—zeaxanthin. When eaten, zeaxanthin is shuttled into your retinas
(the back of your eyes) and appears to protect against macular
degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss.37</p>
<p>The egg industry boasts about the zeaxanthin content in yolks, but
goji berries have about fifty times more than eggs.38 A double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that gojis may even help
people already suffering from macular degeneration.39 The researchers
used milk to improve the absorption of zeaxanthin (which, like all
carotenoids, is fat soluble), but a healthier way would be to use
green-light sources of fat, such as nuts and seeds—in other words, goji
trail mix!</p>
<p>Aren’t goji berries expensive, though? In natural foods stores, they
can go for twenty dollars a pound, but in Asian supermarkets, you can
buy them as “Lycium” berries, and they’re even cheaper than raisins. So,
however you used to eat raisins—as a snack, in baked goods, in your
breakfast cereal or oatmeal, whatever—I recommend you make the switch to
gojis.</p>
<p>Black Currants and Bilberries</p>
<p>Speaking of berries and eyesight, a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover trial of black currants found they can improve the symptoms of
computer eye strain (known in doctor-speak as “video display terminal
work-induced transient refractive alteration”).40 What passes for
currants in the United States are usually champagne grape raisins, not
actual black currants, which were banned in the country a century ago at
the behest of the lumber industry. (The industry feared they might
spread a plant disease that affects white pines, a tree we hardly
harvest anymore, so the ban has since been lifted in some states.) Real
black currants are currently making a comeback, but if—as the
researchers suspected—the benefits have to do with the anthocyanin
pigments, other berries like bilberries, blueberries, or blackberries
may help as well. Anthocyanin pigments are responsible for many of the
intense blue, black, purple, and red colors of berries and other fruits
and vegetables. The highest concentrations are found in aronia berries
and elderberries, followed by black raspberries, blueberries (especially
the smaller “wild” varieties), and blackberries. The cheapest source,
though, is probably red cabbage.41</p>
<p>Bilberries gained notoriety during World War II when it was said that
pilots in the British Royal Air Force “were eating bilberry jam to
improve their night vision.”42 It turns out this may have been a story
concocted to fool the Germans. The more likely reason the Brits were
able to suddenly target Nazi bombers in the middle of the night wasn’t
because of bilberries but thanks to a top-secret new invention:
radar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these anthocyanin pigments take a hit when berries are
processed into jam. As much as 97 percent of anthocyanins are lost when
strawberries are turned into strawberry jam.43 Freeze-drying, however,
appears to be remarkably nutrient preserving.44 I remember trying
“astronaut ice cream” as a kid when I visited the Smithsonian’s Air and
Space Museum. That’s what freeze-dried strawberries taste like to me.
They just melt in your mouth. Delicious, nutritious, but expensive.</p>
<p>Fresh berries, of course, are divine. My family enjoys pick-your-own
outings and then freezes the abundance. I’ve also been known to lay a
sheet under branches of mulberry trees that grow in a park by our house
and gently knock down a ripe bounty with a broom handle. Evidently,
nearly all wild “aggregate” berries (meaning berries that look like
clusters of little balls, like blackberries, raspberries, and
mulberries) in North America are edible,45 but please be sure you make
an ironclad identification before foraging.</p>
<hr />
<p>Berries in all their colorful, sweet, and flavorful glory are
protective little antioxidant powerhouses. The issue shouldn’t be how
you are going to get your one minimum daily serving but rather how you
are going to pry yourself away from them. In your smoothie, as a
dessert, on your salad, or just popped right into your mouth—they are
nature’s candy.</p>

<p>1 cup cut-up fruit</p>
<p>¼ cup dried fruit</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>3 servings per day</p>
<hr />
<p>It took years for nearly five hundred researchers from more than
three hundred institutions in fifty countries to develop the 2010 Global
Burden of Disease Study. Funded by the Bill andandandand Melinda Gates
Foundation, it is the largest analysis of risk factors for death and
disease in history.1 In the United States, the massive study determined
that the leading cause of both death and disability was the American
diet, followed by smoking.2 What did they determine to be the worst
aspect about our diet? Not eating enough fruit.3</p>
<p>Don’t limit yourself to eating fruit just the way it comes plucked
off the tree. Although fruit makes for a perfect, quick snack, don’t
forget that it can be cooked as well. Think baked apples, poached pears,
and grilled pineapple.</p>
<p>If you like drinking your fruit, blending is better than juicing to
preserve nutrition. Juicing removes more than just fiber. Most of the
polyphenol phytonutrients (see chapter 3) in fruits and vegetables
appear to be bound to the fiber and are only liberated for absorption by
the friendly flora in your gut. When you merely drink the juice, you
lose out on the fiber and all the nutrition that was attached to it.4
Even just cloudy apple juice, which retains a bit of the fruit fiber,
appears to have nearly triple the phenolics compared to clear apple
juice.5</p>
<p>Whereas greater consumption of whole fruits has been associated with
a lower likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, Harvard University
researchers found that greater juice consumption was associated with
higher diabetes risk. So, by choosing yellow-light sources of fruit,
like juice or jelly, you may not only be missing out on nutrients but
actively working against your health.6</p>
<p>An Apple a Day</p>
<p>Anyone who says they don’t have time to eat healthfully has never met
an apple. Talk about a convenience food! For those who grew up in a
world dominated by Red Delicious and Granny Smith, I’m happy to report
there are thousands of varieties. Health-wise, crab apples (gross!)
probably top the charts,7 but taste-wise, my personal favorite is
Honeycrisp—or any pick-your-own variety I can find locally. If you’ve
never tried an apple you picked right off a tree, you don’t know what
you’re missing. Failing that, farmers’ markets can offer good deals on
great produce. My family buys apples by the half bushel.</p>
<p>Dates</p>
<p>My favorite fruit snack in the fall and winter is apple slices with
dates, for the perfect mix of tart and sweet. Growing up, I never liked
dates. They tasted dry and kind of waxy. But then I discovered there
were soft, plump, moist varieties that didn’t taste like the chalky ones
that haunted my childhood. Barhi dates, for example, are wet and sticky,
but when frozen, they acquire the taste and chew of caramel candy.
Seriously. Paired with my Honeycrisp, it’s like eating a
butterscotch-flavored caramel apple.</p>
<p>Locally, you should be able to find decent Medjool dates in Middle
Eastern grocery stores and many natural foods markets, but for the
too-moist-to-be-sold-commercially varieties, you’ll probably have to
shop online. I have tried dates from most of the major online retailers
and always go back to ordering from the Date People, a small farm in
California. I am averse to commercial endorsements, but I’ve never
tasted consistently better dates from any other source (although Black
Sphinx dates from Phoenix come close!). Date People’s annual harvest
comes in around my birthday in October, and I always splurge as a
present to myself and get a big box to put in our freezer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Olives and Olive Oil</p>
<p>Olives and extra-virgin olive oil are yellow-light foods. Olive
consumption should be minimized because they’re soaked in brine—a dozen
large olives could take up nearly half your recommended sodium limit for
an entire day. Olive oil is sodium-free, but most of its nutrition has
been removed. You can think of extra-virgin olive oil a little like
fruit juice: It has nutrients, but the calories you get are relatively
empty compared to those from the whole fruit. (Olives are, after all,
fruits.)</p>
<p>Freshly squeezed olive juice already has less nutrition than the
whole fruit, but then olive-oil producers also throw away the olive
wastewater, which contains the water-soluble nutrients. As a result, you
end up getting just a small fraction of the nutrition of the whole fruit
by the time extra-virgin olive oil is bottled. Refined olive oil
(nonvirgin) is even worse. I would classify it, along with other
vegetable oils, as red-light foods, as they offer such scant nutrition
for their heavy caloric loads. One tablespoon of oil can contain more
than one hundred calories without filling you up. (Compare that single
tablespoon to the one-hundred-calorie serving sizes of other foods
here.)</p>
<p>I think of oil as the table sugar of the fat kingdom. Similar to the
way manufacturers take healthy foods like beets and throw out all their
nutrition to make sugar, they take wholesome corn and scorch-earth it
down to corn oil. Like sugar, corn oil calories may be worse than just
empty. In chapter 1, I touched on the impairment of artery function that
can occur within hours of eating red-light fare like fast food and
cheesecake. The same detrimental effect happens after the consumption of
olive oil8 and other oils9 (but not after eating green-light sources of
fat like nuts).10 Even extra-virgin olive oil may impair your arteries’
ability to relax and dilate normally.11 So, like any yellow-light food,
its use should be curtailed.</p>
<p>Cooking without oil is surprisingly easy. To keep foods from
sticking, you can sauté in wine, sherry, broth, vinegar, or just plain
water. For baking, I’ve successfully used green-light ingredients such
as mashed bananas or avocado, soaked prunes, and even canned pumpkin to
substitute for oil to provide a similar moistness.</p>
<p>The reduction of yellow-light foods is all about frequency and
quantity. If you are going to trek outside the green zone, my advice is
simple: Make it count. Don’t waste precious indulgences on crappy food.
I don’t want to sound like a food snob, but if you’re going to eat
something less than maximally healthy, I say pamper yourself and truly
relish it. When I eat olives, there’s no way I’m going to eat those waxy
black abominations in a can. I’m going to slice up some purple kalamatas
that actually have some flavor. If you’re going to spoil yourself once
in a while, I say do it right!</p>
<hr />
<p>Mangos</p>
<p>Mangos are my favorite fruit treat during spring and summer, but you
have to know where to look to get good ones. Check out Hispanic markets
and Indian grocery stores. The difference between a mango from Walmart
and one from an Indian spice store is like the difference between a
hard, pale, tasteless, pink tomato and a ripe, flavorful, farm-stand
heirloom. You should be able to smell the mango at arm’s length.</p>
<p>My favorite way to eat a mango is like sipping a Capri Sun drink
pouch. When the fruit gets soft and ripe, I roll it between my palms,
kneading it with my fingers until it becomes essentially liquid pulp in
a pouch. Then I nip off the tip with my teeth, gently squeeze, and suck
the mango right out of its peel.</p>
<p>Watermelon</p>
<p>Are some whole fruits better than others? Berries contain the most
antioxidants, whereas melons wallow down around iceberg lettuce levels.
Watermelon seeds, on the other hand, have pretty respectable antioxidant
levels, so I try to avoid seedless varieties. A spoonful of watermelon
seeds may have as many antioxidants as a whole cup of melon balls.12
Seedless or not, watermelon contains a compound called citrulline that
can boost the activity of the enzyme responsible for dilating the blood
vessels in the penis that result in erections. A group of Italian
researchers found that citrulline supplementation at the level of five
servings of red watermelon a day improved erection hardness in men with
mild erectile dysfunction, allowing for a 68 percent increase in monthly
intercourse frequency.13 Yellow watermelon has four times more
citrulline,14 though, so just about one wedge a day (one-sixteenth of a
modest melon) may have the same effect. If this information is new to
you, perhaps it’s because the advertising budgets of drug companies like
Pfizer, which rake in billions of dollars each year from the sale of
erectile dysfunction drugs, are about a thousand times15 that of the
entire budget of the National Watermelon Promotion Board.16</p>
<p>Dried Fruit</p>
<p>I love dried mangos, but they are hard to find without added sugar. I
remember naïvely asking a friend in the food business why the industry
felt the need to sugar-up an already sweet fruit. “Added weight,” he
explained. Just as poultry processors inject salt water into chickens to
add water weight, processed food companies often use sugar as a cheap
way to bulk up products sold by the pound.</p>
<p>This made me determined to make my own. I bought an inexpensive
dehydrator from eBay, and I’m so glad I did. Fruit is about 90 percent
water, so imagine intensifying the flavor of a fresh, ripe mango
tenfold. Mind-blowing! Mangos can be a messy pain to peel, but once
that’s done, I slice them about a centimeter thick and sprinkle them
with chia seeds before putting them in the dehydrator. If I’m taking
them on a plane or a hike, I’ll dry them completely. Otherwise, I only
wait until just the outside is dry. The outer layer, encrusted with
chia, gets a crispy texture while the core remains moist and ready to
burst. It’s the kind of thing I can’t eat while watching a movie or
reading a book. It tastes so good I just have to stop, close my eyes,
and savor it.</p>
<p>I also like drying thin apple slices. I either sprinkle them with
cinnamon or rub them with freshly grated ginger. They can be just dried
until chewy or completely dehydrated into crunchy apple chips. Eating a
dozen dried apple rings a day may drop LDL cholesterol levels 16 percent
within three months and 24 percent within six months.17</p>
<p>If you buy dried fruit, I recommend choosing unsulfured varieties.
Sulfur-containing preservatives, such as sulfur dioxide in dried fruit
and sulfites in wine, can form hydrogen sulfide in your gut—this is the
rotten egg gas implicated in the development of the inflammatory bowel
disease ulcerative colitis. The main source of hydrogen sulfide is the
metabolism of animal protein,18 but you can further lower your exposure
by avoiding sulfur additives (either by reading labels or choosing
organic, in which such preservatives are forbidden). The sulfur
naturally contained in cruciferous vegetables does not appear to elevate
colitis risk,19 so feel free to add kale chips to your healthy snacking
menu.</p>
<hr />
<p>Prescribing Kiwifruit</p>
<p>There appear to be a disproportionate number of articles in the
medical literature about the clinical benefits of kiwifruit. Is that
because they’re better than other fruits? Or is it because the kiwi
industry has more research dollars? One country, New Zealand, holds a
substantial share of the global kiwi market, so it’s in its best
interest to underwrite research on the fruit. As a result, there is no
shortage of papers touting the benefits of kiwifruit.</p>
<p>Kiwi is one of the fruits I’ve prescribed to my patients with
insomnia (two an hour before bedtime appears to significantly improve
sleep onset, duration, and efficiency)20 and also to help with
constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome (two kiwifruit a day seem to
significantly improve bowel function). Kiwi certainly seems like a
better option than the leading IBS drug, which was pulled from the
market for apparently killing too many people.21</p>
<p>Kiwifruit also appear to benefit immune function. Preschoolers
randomized to eat gold kiwifruits every day appeared to cut their risk
of contracting a cold or flu-like illness nearly in half compared to
those randomly selected to eat bananas instead.22 A similar experiment
was tried on elderly individuals, another high-risk group. Those in the
banana control group who got an upper-respiratory-tract infection
suffered for about five days with a sore throat and congestion, compared
to the kiwifruit eaters, who felt better after just a day or two.23
About 1 in 130 children may be allergic to kiwifruit, though,24 which
may rank kiwis as the third-most-common food allergen (second only to
milk and eggs),25 so they are not for everyone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Citrus</p>
<p>Adding citrus zest to your meals not only adds color, flavor, aroma,
and a bit of culinary flair but also nutrition. Citrus zest lives up to
its name in terms of enlivening dishes, and it may do the same to your
DNA-repair capabilities. On average, humans appear to suffer eight
hundred hits to their DNA per hour. If not fixed, this can cause
mutations that give rise to cancer.26 Comparing identical and fraternal
twins, researchers have determined that only part of your DNA-repair
function is determined genetically. The rest may be under your
control.27</p>
<p>The dietary factor found best able to boost DNA repair was citrus
fruit.28 Within two hours of consuming citrus, your DNA becomes
significantly more resistant to damage,29 which may help explain why
citrus consumption is associated with lower risk of breast cancer.30
Some of the citrus compounds thought responsible—which concentrate in
the breast31 and enhance DNA repair32—are found in the peel, though.
This may be why people who eat at least some citrus peel appear to have
lower skin cancer rates than those who don’t.33</p>
<p>Stick with the whole fruit, because supplements don’t appear to boost
DNA repair,34 and citrus juice doesn’t appear to help, either. In fact,
drinking orange juice every morning may even increase skin cancer
risk.35 Green-light forms of foods always seem to be the best, and you
can eat citrus in an even less processed way by slipping some of the
rind into your diet through zesting. I like to freeze lemons, limes, and
oranges whole so we always have them on hand to grate onto meals that
could use a little zing.</p>
<p>My only whole-citrus caveat: Inform your physician if you eat
grapefruit. This fruit can suppress the enzymes that help clear more
than half of commonly prescribed drugs, and less drug clearance means
higher drug levels in the body.36 This may actually be good if you want
a better caffeine buzz from your morning coffee37 or if your doctor
wants to help you save money by boosting the effects of expensive drugs
instead of just peeing them away.38 But higher drug levels may also mean
higher risk of side effects, so if you regularly eat grapefruits, your
physician may want to change your prescription or alter the dosing.</p>
<p>Exotic Fruits</p>
<p>The medical school I attended sits in the middle of Boston’s
Chinatown. I remember the first time I perused the produce aisle at a
large Asian supermarket. With options from bizarre-looking dragon fruit
to tribble-like rambutans, I felt like I was on another planet. Every
week I tried something new. Some stuck with me—I still sneak lychees
into the movies—but others were onetime affairs. Let me share with you
the Durian Incident.</p>
<p>Durians are the most badass of all fruits. Imagine a five-pound
football covered in sharp spikes like some medieval mace. What other
fruit could be described in the medical literature as causing “severe
body injury” in papers with titles like “Penetrating Ocular Injury by
Durian Fruit”?39 And I haven’t even gotten to its most distinctive
quality: its smell. With an odor perhaps best described as “pig-shit,
turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock,”40 durian fruits are
banned from many public spaces, like subways and airports, in Southeast
Asia, where they are grown.</p>
<p>I had to try eating one of these crazy things!</p>
<p>Durian fruits are sold frozen. (I would soon come to understand why.)
I took one back to campus and managed to hack off a piece without
impaling myself on a spike. The fruit tasted like a caramelized onion
popsicle. I left the rest in my locker. Big mistake! I arrived the next
day to find an entire floor of the medical center—including the dean’s
office—cordoned off. They were going locker to locker, cutting off all
the locks, searching in vain for the cause of a stench so overpowering
you couldn’t even locate it. It was like a fog of stink. Hospital staff
seriously thought someone had stolen body parts from the gross anatomy
cadaver lab. And then it struck me. Uh-oh. The durian had thawed. When I
realized it was all my fault, I crawled to the dean to beg forgiveness.
I already had a history of run-ins with the administration over issues I
had raised about the curriculum, and now this. I’ll never forget what he
said to me that day: “Why am I not surprised you had something to do
with this?”</p>
<hr />
<p>When adding as much fruit as possible to your diet, you certainly
don’t have to seek out weapons-grade stinky fruit, but you also don’t
have to stick with the same old, same old. Treat yourself! Have fun
sampling the many varieties of the many different fruits around. How
lovely it can be to stroll through your farmers’ market on a weekend and
pick up locally grown fruits that you can zest onto your meals, blend
into smoothies, chew when dried, incorporate into your favorite dishes,
or best of all, bite right into. The opportunities are ripe for the
picking!</p>
<p>Cruciferous Vegetables</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Cruciferous Vegetables</p>
<p>Arugula, bok choy, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower,

greens, radishes, turnip greens, and watercress</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>½ cup chopped</p>
<p>¼ cup brussels or broccoli sprouts</p>
<p>1 tablespoon horseradish</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>1 serving per day</p>
<hr />
<p>When I used to teach medical students at Tufts, I gave a lecture
about this amazing new therapeutic called “iloccorB.” I’d talk about all
the evidence supporting it, the great things it could do, and its
excellent safety profile. Just as the students would start scrambling to
buy stock in the company and prescribe it to their future patients, I’d
do the big reveal. Apologizing for my “dyslexia”, I would admit that I’d
gotten it backward. All this time, I had been talking about
broccoli.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned broccoli more than any other food in this book, and
for good reason. We’ve seen how cruciferous vegetables like broccoli can
potentially prevent DNA damage and metastatic cancer spread in chapter
2, activate defenses against pathogens and pollutants in chapter 5, help
to prevent lymphoma in chapter 9, boost your liver detox enzymes and
target breast cancer stem cells in chapter 11, and reduce the risk of
prostate cancer progression in chapter 13. The component responsible for
these benefits is thought to be sulforaphane, which is formed almost
exclusively in cruciferous vegetables. This is why they get their own
spot on the Daily Dozen.</p>
<p>Beyond being a promising anticancer agent,1 sulforaphane may also
help protect your brain2 and your eyesight,3 reduce nasal allergy
inflammation,4 manage type 2 diabetes,5 and was recently found to
successfully help treat autism. A placebo-controlled, double-blind,
randomized trial of boys with autism found that about two to three
cruciferous vegetable servings’ worth6 of sulforaphane a day improves
social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal communication within a
matter of weeks. The researchers, primarily from Harvard University and
Johns Hopkins University, suggest that the effect might be due to
sulforaphane’s role as a “detoxicant.”7</p>
<hr />
<p>Strategies to Enhance Sulforaphane Formation</p>
<p>The formation of sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables is like a
chemical flare reaction. It requires the mixing of a precursor compound
with an enzyme called myrosinase, which is inactivated by cooking8
(though microwaved broccoli appears to retain some cancer-fighting
capacity). This may explain why we see dramatic suppression of test-tube
cancer-cell growth by raw broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts,
but hardly any reaction when they’re cooked.9 But who wants to eat raw
brussels sprouts? Not me. Thankfully, there are ways to get the benefits
of raw vegetables in cooked form.</p>
<p>Biting into broccoli is like snapping that chemical flare. When raw
broccoli (or any other cruciferous vegetable) is chopped or chewed, the
sulforaphane precursor mixes with the myrosinase enzyme and sulforaphane
is created as the vegetable sits on the cutting board or lies in your
upper stomach waiting to be digested.10 Though the enzyme is destroyed
by cooking, both the precursor and the final product are resistant to
heat. So here’s the trick: Use what I call the “Hack and Hold” technique
(maybe I should call it Whack and Wait?).</p>
<p>If you chop the broccoli (or brussels sprouts, kale, collards,
cauliflower, or any other cruciferous vegetable) and then wait forty
minutes, you can cook it as much as you want. At that point, the
sulforaphane has already been made, so the enzyme is no longer needed to
achieve maximum benefit. It’s already done its job. (You can also buy
bags of fresh greens and other crucifers that are prechopped or
shredded, which can presumably be cooked immediately.)</p>
<p>Given this understanding, can you see how most people prepare
broccoli soup incorrectly? Typically, they first cook the broccoli and
then blend it. But, when you blend it, you’re merely mixing the
precursor with an enzyme that’s been inactivated by cooking. Do it in
the opposite order: First blend your veggies and then wait forty minutes
before cooking them. This way, you can maximize sulforaphane
production.</p>
<p>What about frozen broccoli and other crucifers? Commercially produced
frozen broccoli lacks the ability to form sulforaphane because the
vegetables are blanched (flash-cooked) before they’re frozen for the
very purpose of deactivating enzymes.11 This process prolongs shelf
life, but when you take the veggies out of your freezer, the enzyme is
inert. At that point, it doesn’t matter how much you chop or how long
you wait—no sulforaphane is going to be made. This may be why fresh kale
has been shown to suppress cancer cell growth in vitro up to ten times
better than frozen kale.12</p>
<p>The frozen crucifer is still packed with the precursor,
though—remember, it’s heat resistant. You could make lots of
sulforaphane from it by adding back some enzyme.13 But where can you get
myrosinase? Scientists buy theirs from chemical companies, but you can
just walk into any grocery store.</p>
<p>Mustard greens are also cruciferous vegetables. They grow from
mustard seeds, which you can buy ground up in the spice aisle as mustard
powder. If you sprinkled some mustard powder on frozen broccoli that’s
been cooked, would it start churning out sulforaphane? Yes!</p>
<p>Boiling broccoli prevents the formation of any significant levels of
sulforaphane due to inactivation of the enzyme. However, the addition of
powdered mustard seeds to cooked broccoli significantly increases
sulforaphane formation.14 Then it’s almost as good as eating it raw! So,
if you don’t have forty minutes to spare between chopping and cooking,
or if you’re using frozen greens, just sprinkle the crucifers with some
mustard powder before you eat them, and you’ll be all set. Daikon
radishes, regular radishes, horseradish, and wasabi are all cruciferous
vegetables and may have the same effect. All it appears to take is a
pinch to revitalize sulforaphane production.15 You can also add a small
amount of fresh greens to your cooked greens. So when I add shreds of
purple cabbage to my finished dishes, it not only adds a beautiful
garnish with a delightful crunch, it’s filled with the
sulforaphane-producing enzyme.</p>
<p>One of my first tasks every morning used to be chopping greens for
the day, using my Hack and Hold technique. But now, with the Mustard
Powder Plan, I have one less to-do on my list.</p>
<hr />
<p>Horseradish</p>
<p>The serving sizes I offer here correspond roughly to the daily intake
required to achieve cancer-preventive levels according to the innovative
breast-surgery study I detailed in chapter 11. As you can see,
horseradish has the smallest serving size, which means it’s the most
concentrated of the cruciferous vegetables. One tablespoon and your
Daily Dozen is down to an Everyday Eleven. Horseradish can be made into
a sauce, relish, or dressing to score an extra check mark with a kick.
It’s great in mashed potatoes or, for a healthier option still, mashed
cauliflower. Just boil cauliflower for about ten minutes until tender
and then mash with a fork or potato masher or purée in a food processor
with some of the reserved cooking liquid until smooth. I season it with
pepper, roasted garlic, and a dollop of horseradish and then pour
mushroom gravy on it. Delicious!</p>
<p>Roasting Cruciferous Vegetables</p>
<p>As much as I love mashed cauliflower, roasted cauliflower (or
broccoli, for that matter) is my favorite. Roasting brings out a nutty,
caramelized flavor. I slice raw cauliflower into “steaks,” roast at
400°F for about a half hour, and then smother it in a lemon-tahini
sauce. Sometimes I go minimalist and just sprinkle on lemon juice, zest,
capers, and garlic. (This chapter is making me hungry!)</p>
<p>Kale Chips</p>
<p>I’ll talk about some of the more traditional ways I prepare greens in
the next section, but kale chips deserve a special mention. You can use
a dehydrator if you have one, but I often don’t have the patience. When
I’m in the mood for kale chips, I want them now. They can be as simple
as one ingredient: kale. Pull the leaves off the stems and tear into
large pieces. Make sure that they are dry, or they’ll steam rather than
crisp. Lay out the torn leaves in a single layer on a cookie tray lined
with parchment paper or a silicone mat to prevent sticking, and bake at
a low temperature (about 250°F) and check often to make sure they don’t
burn. Within about twenty minutes, they transform into light, crispy
snacks. Preseason the leaves before you roast them, or add your spices
after they’re done. There are thousands of recipes online. I recommend
starting with Ann Esselstyn’s recipe on her son Rip’s website,
Engine2Diet.com.16 With kale chips, the more you snack, the healthier
you are.</p>
<p>Cruciferous Garnishes</p>
<p>Similar to the way I use an open can of beans in the fridge as a
reminder to try to bean-up any dish, we always have a purple (or red)
cabbage in the crisper to help us cruciferize our meals. I slice off
shreds and garnish nearly anything with them. Red cabbage averages about
one dollar per pound,17 is found at pretty much any grocery store or
market, can last weeks in the fridge (though if it does, that means
you’re not using it enough!), and has more antioxidants per dollar than
anything else you’ll find in the produce aisle. There are healthier
foods you can buy, but not for the same amount of money. For example,
purple cabbage may have nearly three times the antioxidant power per
dollar that blueberries do.18 In terms of eating healthfully on a
budget, purple cabbage can’t be beat. Or can it?</p>
<p>After chopping and discarding the waste, red cabbage averages 45
cents a cup.19 But broccoli sprouts—if you make them yourself—may be
even cheaper. Broccoli sprout seeds can be purchased online or at
natural foods stores for about twenty dollars a pound, but that makes
about seventy-five cups of sprouts. In terms of sulforaphane content,
that may be around three hundred cups of mature broccoli. So DIY
broccoli sprouts provide a green-light sulforaphane source for about a
nickel a day.</p>
<p>Sprouting broccoli sprouts is as easy as sprouting lentils. Start
with a mason jar with a sprouting (screen) lid. Add a tablespoon of
seeds, let them soak overnight in water, drain in the morning, and then
after that, just quickly rinse and drain twice a day. Most people wait
for about five days, until the seeds fully sprout (taking on the look of
alfalfa sprouts), but new science suggests sulforaphane content peaks at
forty-eight hours after the seeds are initially drained.20 This makes
them even quicker and easier to grow and eat. When I’m not traveling, I
usually have a few jars in rotation. It can be the middle of winter, and
I’m growing my own salad on my kitchen counter! Every day, you can get
cups of fresh produce for your family without ever having to go to the
store.</p>
<p>Cruciferous Supplements?</p>
<p>If you don’t like the taste of cruciferous vegetables but still want
the benefits of the sulforaphane, what about the broccoli supplements
currently on the market? Researchers recently put a leading commercial
supplement to the test. BroccoMax boasts the equivalent of a half pound
of broccoli in every capsule. Study subjects were given either six
capsules a day or a single cup of broccoli sprouts. The supplement
hardly worked at all, whereas the sprouts boosted blood levels about
eight times higher for eight times less cost. The researchers concluded
that “our data provide further evidence that bioavailability of
[sulforaphane] is dramatically lower when subjects consume broccoli
supplements compared to fresh broccoli sprouts.”21</p>
<hr />
<p>Too Much of a Good Thing?</p>
<p>If broccoli sprouts are so cheap and effective, why not eat bowls of
them? A formal safety analysis found no significant adverse effects to
about one and a half cups a day,22 but we didn’t have data on a
potential upper limit until a team of Italian researchers tried to push
the envelope. They were attempting to come up with an intravenous
infusion dose to use as chemotherapy, and so they wanted to know how
high they could go. The researchers discovered that blood levels
achieved by four or more cups of broccoli sprouts may indeed be
detrimental.23 They concluded, however, that no harm was found at
“nutritionally attainable concentrations.” But that’s not really true.
Broccoli sprouts do have a radishy bite, but someone could theoretically
eat four cups of sprouts a day. (They don’t know health nuts like I know
some health nuts.)</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, someone came up to me after
a lecture in Miami and told me he had heard that wheatgrass juice was
good for you. “It cleans you out,” he had read. So he thought, Why not?
and decided to stuff himself with it. He told me how he calculated the
volume of the human digestive tract (all ten yards or so) and proceeded
to drink that amount continuously, quart after quart, until it started
coming out the other end. Intrigued, I asked him what happened. He
looked up at me with an expression that I can only describe as rapturous
and said, “It was volcanic.”</p>
<hr />
<p>It would be hard for me to say too many good things about crucifers.
These vegetables do wonders for your health, from fighting cancer
progression and boosting defenses against pathogens and pollutants to
helping protect your brain and vision and more. And you can use this
family of veggies as your excuse to play Mad Scientist in the kitchen,
manipulating enzyme chemistry to maximize the health benefits.</p>
<p>Greens</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Greens</p>
<p>Arugula, beet greens, collard greens, kale (black, green, and red),
mesclun mix (assorted young salad greens), mustard greens, sorrel,
spinach, swiss chard, and turnip greens</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>1 cup raw</p>
<p>½ cup cooked</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>2 servings per day</p>
<hr />
<p>Popeye was right when he bragged that he was strong to the finish
because he ate his spinach. Dark-green, leafy vegetables are the
healthiest foods on the planet. As whole foods go, they offer the most
nutrition per calorie. Just to emphasize the point, there was a study
published in the journal Nutrition and Cancer entitled “Antioxidant,
Antimutagenic, and Antitumor Effects of Pine Needles.”1 Edible leaves,
in all their shapes and sizes, it seems, can be healthy foods.</p>
<p>In 1777, General George Washington issued a general order that
American troops should forage for wild greens growing around their camps
“as these vegetables are very conducive to health, and tend to prevent …
all putrid disorders.”2 Since then, however, Americans have declared
their independence from greens. Today, only about one in twenty-five
even reach a dozen servings throughout the course of an entire month.3 I
advise getting more than a dozen servings per week.</p>
<hr />
<p>IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Greens and Warfarin</p>
<p>In 1984, the tragic case of a thirty-five-year-old woman unfolded
when she failed to inform her physician about her change in diet.
Because of her mechanical heart valve, the woman was on a blood-thinning
drug called warfarin. But because she wanted to lose weight, she started
eating a diet composed almost entirely of salad, broccoli, turnip
greens, and mustard greens. Five weeks later, she suffered a blood clot
and died.4</p>
<p>If you are on the drug warfarin (also known as Coumadin), talk with
your physician before you increase your greens intake. The drug works
(both as a rat poison and a human blood-thinner) by crippling the enzyme
that recycles vitamin K, which is involved in clotting your blood. If
your system gets an influx of fresh vitamin K, which is concentrated in
greens, you can thereby undermine the effectiveness of the drug. You
should still be able to eat your greens, but your physician will have to
titrate the dose of the drug to match your regular greens intake.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eating greens nearly every day may be one of the most powerful steps
you can take to prolong your life.5 Of all the food groups analyzed by a
team of Harvard University researchers, greens turned out to be
associated with the strongest protection against major chronic
diseases,6 including up to about a 20 percent reduction in risk for both
heart attacks7 and strokes8 for every additional daily serving.</p>
<p>Imagine if there were a pill that could prolong your life and only
had good side effects. Everyone would be taking it! It would be making
billions of dollars for the lucky drug company that created it. All
health plans by law would have to cover it. People from every walk of
life and every corner of the globe would be clamoring for it. But when
that “pill” is just eat-your-greens, people lose interest.</p>
<p>Drug companies have yet to patent broccoli (though Monsanto is
trying!9). Doctors, however, don’t have to wait for perky pharmaceutical
sales reps to wine, dine, and cajole them into prescribing Pfizer-brand
spinach or GlaxoSmithKline-brand collards. Here’s my prescription for
you:</p>
<p>If the full spectrum of colorful plant pigments are good for you, why
are greens the healthiest? When autumn in New England becomes aflame
with brilliant hues, where do those oranges and yellows come from? They
were there all along, actually—just masked by the green pigment
chlorophyll that starts to break down in the fall.10 Similarly, the
dark-green leaves of vegetables contain many of the other plant pigments
all wrapped up in one package. As I mentioned, these colorful compounds
are often the very same antioxidants implicated in many of the benefits
of fruit and vegetable consumption. So, in essence, when you eat your
greens, you are eating the rainbow.</p>
<hr />
<p>How to Regenerate Coenzyme Q10 Naturally</p>
<p>One of the reasons greens are some of the healthiest green-light
foods may be due to their green color. Decades ago, a search began for
“interceptor” molecules that could serve as the body’s first line of
defense against cancer. The theory was that if we could find something
that could tightly bind to carcinogens and prevent them from slipping
into our DNA, we might be able to prevent some of the mutations that
lead to cancer. After years of combing for the existence of such
carcinogen-binding molecules, an interceptor was found: chlorophyll, the
most ubiquitous plant pigment in the world. It was right under our noses
all along (provided we were eating healthfully!).11</p>
<p>In a petri dish, certain DNA damage in human cells exposed to a
carcinogen could be “totally abolished” by chlorophyll.12 But what about
in people? In the name of science, volunteers drank a solution of
radioactive aflatoxin (a carcinogen) with or without spinach
chlorophyll. Six cups of spinach worth of chlorophyll appeared to block
about 40 percent of the carcinogen.13 Amazing! But that’s not all
chlorophyll can do.</p>
<p>In college, you learn that pretty much everything you were taught in
high school biology wasn’t true. Then in graduate school, you unlearn
all the oversimplifications you learned in college. Just when you think
you understand something in biology, it always seems a little more
complicated than you thought. For example, until recently, we assumed
plants and plantlike organisms were the only ones that could directly
capture and utilize the energy from the sun. Plants photosynthesize.
Animals don’t. That’s because plants have chlorophyll and animals do
not. Well, technically, you do have chlorophyll in your
body—temporarily, at least—after you eat greens. But it would seem
there’s no way the chlorophyll that enters your bloodstream after that
salad could react with sunlight. After all, light can’t penetrate
through your skin, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Any kid who’s ever shined a flashlight through her or his
fingers could have told you that.</p>
<p>The red wavelengths of sunlight do penetrate into your body.14 In
fact, if you step outside on a sunny day, there’s enough light reaching
your brain that you could actually read this page inside your skull.15
Your internal organs are bathed in sunlight, along with any chlorophyll
circulating in your bloodstream. Although any energy produced by the
chlorophyll would be negligible,16 it turns out that light-activated
chlorophyll in your body may help regenerate a critical molecule called
coenzyme Q10.17</p>
<p>CoQ10, also known as ubiquinol, is an antioxidant. When ubiquinol
extinguishes a free radical, it is oxidized to ubiquinone. To act as an
effective antioxidant again, the body must regenerate ubiquinol from
ubiquinone. Think of it like an electrical fuse: Ubiquinol can only be
used once before having to be reset. That’s where sunlight and
chlorophyll may come in.</p>
<p>Researchers exposed some ubiquinone and dietary chlorophyll
metabolites to the kind of light that reaches your bloodstream … and
poof! CoQ10 was reborn. However, without the chlorophyll, or without the
light, nothing happened. All along, we’ve been thinking that the main
benefit of sunlight was only the formation of vitamin D and that the
main benefit of greens was the antioxidants they contain. But now we
suspect the combination of the two may actually help the body create and
maintain its own internal stock of antioxidants.</p>
<p>Eating a plant-based, chlorophyll-rich diet may be especially
important for those on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, as these
medications can interfere with CoQ10 production.</p>
<hr />
<p>Green Can Taste Great</p>
<p>I hope I’ve been able to convince you to eat greens as often as
possible. The problem for many people is getting them to taste good. I’m
afraid too many of us still suffer flashbacks from overcooked, slimy
green lumps on school cafeteria trays.</p>
<p>Take kale, for example. Fibrous and grassy tasting, right? Kind of
bitter too? Some varieties are more palatable than others. In a good
supermarket produce section, you may be able to find three types: green,
black, and red. Nutritionally, the differences among them appear to be
insignificant compared to how much of each you may be willing to
eat.18,19 The healthiest kale is the one you’ll eat the most of.</p>
<p>I would suggest using black kale (also called lacinato, dinosaur, or
Tuscan kale), red kale (also found as red Russian kale), or baby kale,
since these varieties are all milder and more tender than the more
common mature green (curly) kale.</p>
<p>Start by rinsing the leaves thoroughly under running water. Then rip
off the stems and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Alternatively,
after the leaves are removed from their stems, roll them up and slice
into thin ribbons. If you want to make it even easier on yourself, just
use whatever type you can find frozen. Frozen greens are cheaper, last
longer, and come prewashed and prechopped.</p>
<p>There’s a phenomenon called flavor-flavor conditioning in which you
can change your palate by linking a less pleasant flavor (for instance,
sour or bitter) with a more pleasant one (say, sweet). For example, when
researchers tried adding sugar to sour grapefruit juice, people liked it
better. No surprise. But within a few days, the study subjects began to
like even unsweetened grapefruit juice more than they did before the
experiment started. In fact, this reconditioning of the palate lasted
for at least weeks after the sugar was removed.20</p>
<p>The same happens when researchers dip or spritz broccoli with sugar
water or aspartame.21 I know that sounds gross, but they’re not actually
making the broccoli taste sweet. The added sweetness merely masks the
bitterness by fooling your taste buds.22 This is why the so-called
secret ingredient in many collard greens recipes is a spoonful of sugar.
Certainly, if there were ever a food to justify the use of a yellow- or
red-light condiment to boost consumption, it would be the single
healthiest of all foods: greens. I use a balsamic glaze even though it
has some added sugar in it. It would be healthier, though, to add
green-light sweetness in the form of something like figs or grated
apples.</p>
<p>The sweetness trick is why green smoothies can be so delicious (if
not a little odd looking). Smoothies can be a great way to introduce
greens into children’s diets. The basic triad is a liquid, ripe fruit,
and fresh greens. I’d start with a two-to-one ratio of fruits to greens
to start with before tipping heavier toward greens on the scale. So, for
example, one cup of water, a frozen banana, a cup of frozen berries, and
a cup of packed baby spinach would be a classic green smoothie 101.</p>
<p>I like to add fresh mint leaves as well for a boost of flavor (and
even more greens). Fresh herbs can be expensive at the store, but mint
can grow like a weed in your yard or in a pot on your windowsill. Eating
greens for breakfast can be as delicious as mint chocolate
oatmeal—cooked oatmeal, chopped mint leaves, cocoa powder, and a healthy
sweetener (see here).</p>
<p>When you’re thinking about ways to pair your greens with something
you already love to make the greens more palatable, consider mixing them
with a green-light source of fat: nuts, seeds, nut or seed butters, or
avocados. Many of the nutrients greens are famous for are fat soluble,
including beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, and zeaxanthin. So pairing
your greens with a green-light source of fat may not only make them
taste better but will maximize nutrient absorption. This can mean
enjoying a creamy tahini-based dressing on your salad, putting walnuts
in your pesto, or sprinkling some toasted sesame seeds on your sautéed
kale.</p>
<p>The jump in nutrient absorption is no small effect. When researchers
tried feeding people a healthy salad of spinach, romaine, carrots, and
tomatoes along with a source of fat, there was an impressive spike in
carotenoid phytonutrients in their bloodstream over the next eight
hours. With a fat-free dressing, carotenoid absorption flatlined down to
negligible amounts; it was as if they’d never eaten the salad at all.23
Similarly, adding some avocado to your salsa may triple the amount of
fat-soluble nutrients that make it into your bloodstream (in this case,
the lycopene in the tomatoes).24 It doesn’t take much. Just three grams
of fat in an entire hot meal may be sufficient to boost absorption.25
That’s just a single walnut or a spoonful of avocado or shredded
coconut. Snack on a few pistachios after a meal, and you’re all set. The
greens and the source of fat just have to end up in your stomach at the
same time.</p>
<p>Another way to remove bitterness from greens is to blanch or boil
them, but unfortunately this works by leaching some of the healthy
compounds into the cooking water.26 If you’re making soup, that’s not a
problem, because the nutrients aren’t destroyed as much as they are
displaced. If the cooking liquid is poured off, however, you could be
losing some nutrition. But even if 50 percent of these healthy compounds
go down the drain, if the decreased bitterness motivates you to eat
twice as many greens, problem solved! Whenever I’m boiling pasta, for
example, I’ll add a bunch of fresh greens to the pot a few minutes
before I’m ready to drain the pasta. I know I’ll be losing some
nutrients when I pour off the cooking water, but it’s worth it to me for
the convenience of throwing everything into one pot and getting my
family to eat even more greens.</p>
<p>Try to incorporate greens into as many meals as possible. I put just
about everything I eat on a bed of greens. That way, the greens take on
the flavor of the rest of the dish. However, if you want to eat cooked
greens “straight,” you can try adding lemon juice, flavored vinegars,
red pepper flakes, garlic, ginger, low-sodium soy sauce, or caramelized
onions. I personally like mine hot, sweet, smoky, and salty. I use hot
sauce for heat, balsamic glaze for sweetness, and both smoked paprika
and liquid smoke. For saltiness, I used to be fond of a soy sauce
substitute called Bragg Liquid Aminos until I got more serious about
cutting down my sodium intake. The best sodium-free salt substitute I’ve
been able to find is something called Table Tasty. (What’s with these
names?)</p>
<p>There are whole grocery aisles full of prepared sauces with which you
can experiment. Most have added salt, oil, or sugar, so I try to reserve
them for exceptionally healthy foods. Mixing yellow- and red-light foods
together (like dipping your fries and McNuggets in barbecue sauce) may
just add insult to injury, but I wouldn’t eat half as many baked
rosemary sweet-potato fries if I weren’t dipping them in
hot-sauce-spiked ketchup. And if there were ever an excuse to dip out of
the green-light zone, it would be for green, leafy vegetables.</p>
<p>During my bachelor days, I would regularly order Chinese food for
delivery—usually broccoli and garlic sauce (hold the white rice). Then
I’d throw brown rice or quinoa along with dried lentils into my rice
cooker and steam or microwave a pound of greens. By the time the
delivery arrived, everything was ready and I would just mix it all
together and have more than enough for leftovers.</p>
<p>You can also find prepackaged pouches of Indian food online or at
Indian or natural foods markets. Again, I’d use them as sauces rather
than eat them as a meal in themselves. My favorite is spinach dal—that
way, I’m eating greens in a greens sauce! That’s like the kale-pesto
principle: Use one green (basil) to make the other green (kale) taste
better.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Health Benefits of Vinegar</p>
<p>Vinegar may be one condiment that’s good for you. Randomized,
controlled trials involving both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals
suggest that adding two teaspoons of vinegar to a meal may improve blood
sugar control, effectively blunting the blood sugar spike after a meal
by about 20 percent.27 So adding vinegar to potato salad or to rice
(like the Japanese do to make sushi rice) or dipping bread in balsamic
vinegar may blunt the effects of these high-glycemic foods.</p>
<p>We’ve known about the antiglycemic effect of vinegar for more than
twenty-five years, but we’re still not sure of the mechanism.28
Originally, it was thought that vinegar slowed stomach emptying, but
even consuming vinegar outside of meals appears to help. Type 2
diabetics consuming two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar at bedtime,
for example, were found to wake up with better blood sugars in the
morning.29 Consuming pickles or vinegar pills does not seem to have the
same effect.30 Do not, however, drink vinegar straight, as it can burn
your esophagus,31 or in excess—a cup a day for six years (that’s two
thousand cups!) was discovered to be a bad idea.32</p>
<p>Vinegar may also help with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), improve
arterial function, and help reduce body fat. A daily tablespoon of apple
cider vinegar restored ovarian function within a few months in four out
of seven women with PCOS.33 A tablespoon of rice vinegar was found to
acutely improve artery function in postmenopausal women. We’re not sure
why, but the acetate from the acetic acid in vinegar may lead to
improved nitric-oxide production (see here).34 Such an effect would be
expected to help with hypertension, and indeed there is a study
purporting to show blood pressure benefits from a tablespoon of vinegar
a day.35</p>
<p>Despite folk wisdom to the contrary, vinegar does not appear to be an
effective treatment for head lice,36 but it may help with weight loss. A
double-blind, placebo-controlled (but vinegar company–funded) study was
performed, in which obese subjects consumed daily vinegar drinks with
either one or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, or a placebo drink
that tasted like vinegar but contained no acetic acid. Both vinegar
groups lost significantly more weight than the control group. Though the
effect was modest—about four pounds over a three-month period—CT scans
showed the vinegar groups’ subjects lost a significant amount of their
“visceral” fat, the abdominal fat that is particularly associated with
chronic disease risk.37</p>
<p>There are all sorts of flavorful, exotic vinegars to explore these
days, including fig, peach, and pomegranate. I encourage you to
experiment and find ways to incorporate some into your diet.</p>
<hr />
<p>Salad Days</p>
<p>Having a big salad every day is a great way to burn through the Daily
Dozen. To a base of mesclun greens and arugula, I add tomato, red bell
pepper, beans, and barberries, along with toasted nuts if I’m using a
fat-free dressing. My current favorite dressing recipe is a Caesar
spin-off shared by Dr. Michael Klaper from the TrueNorth Health
Center:</p>
<p>2 tablespoons almond meal</p>
<p>3 cloves crushed garlic</p>
<p>3 tablespoons dijon mustard</p>
<p>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes</p>
<p>2 tablespoons white miso</p>
<p>3 tablespoons lemon juice</p>
<p>1/3 cup water</p>
<p>Blend and enjoy! (If you have a high-speed blender, you could
probably use whole almonds instead of meal.)</p>
<p>Baby spinach may have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature
spinach leaves,38 but what about real baby spinach—so-called
microgreens, the seedlings of vegetables and herbs? A nutritional
analysis of twenty-five commercially available microgreens found they
did have significantly higher nutrient densities. For example, red
cabbage microgreens have a sixfold higher vitamin C concentration than
mature red cabbage and nearly seventy times the vitamin K.39 But they’re
eaten in such microquantities that even the healthiest upscale
restaurant garnish probably isn’t going to do much for you.</p>
<p>If, however, you want to grow your own, you could have rotating trays
of microgreens that you snip off with scissors for probably the
healthiest salad out there. (On a lecture tour, I once stayed with
someone who did just that, and I’ve been jealous ever since.)
Microgreens are the perfect plants for the impatient gardener—fully
grown in just one to two weeks.</p>
<hr />
<p>The One Green to Avoid</p>
<p>Although greens are the healthiest of foods, there’s one green I
caution against eating: alfalfa sprouts. Over a dozen years,
twenty-eight outbreaks of Salmonella food poisoning linked to sprouts
have been documented in the United States, affecting 1,275 people.40 Of
course, Salmonella-tainted eggs sicken an estimated 142,000 Americans
every year,41 but that doesn’t make it any less tragic for those
hospitalized and killed in “sproutbreaks.” Alfalfa sprout seeds have all
sorts of microscopic nooks and crannies where bacteria from
manure-contaminated irrigation water can hide. So even home-sprouted
alfalfa seeds should not be considered safe.</p>
<p>I will never forget a presentation I gave in Boston. It was in a game
show–style format in which contestants from the audience tried to rank,
from healthiest to unhealthiest, the foods I’d brought with me. There
was a lively cacophony of conflicting advice shouted from the crowd. You
can imagine the groans when I revealed that alfalfa sprouts—a
quintessential health food—belonged way at the top on the foods-to-avoid
list.</p>
<p>Later that night, I was stuck with the sprouts after all the
healthier and yummier items had been given away as prizes. I had just
told my audience not to eat them—but I hate wasting food. In a
do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do moment, I added them to my salad that night.
Yes, they had been sitting in the car all day and on stage for hours.
Yes, they were at the top of my game show’s list of foods you should not
eat. But, what were the odds that that one particular package was
contaminated? I went back to work the next day at the New England
Medical Center emergency room—not as a physician but as a patient with
Salmonella food poisoning.</p>

<p>So other than the dreaded alfalfa sprout, greens truly are the
healthiest foods on the planet. You simply can’t do better in terms of
nutrition per calorie. Explore, innovate, taste test, play, and teach
your palate to enjoy them. Whether you sneak them into a refreshing
smoothie, incorporate them into sauces and dressings, use them as a base
for main dishes, or eat them straight in a big, vibrant salad—just do
it. Your body will thank you with every bite of greens you take.</p>

<hr />
<p>The mammoth Global Burden of Disease Study identified the typical
American diet as the primary cause of Americans’ death and disability1
and inadequate vegetable intake as our fifth-leading dietary risk
factor, nearly as bad as our consumption of processed meat.2 The Union
of Concerned Scientists estimates that if the nation increased its
consumption of fruits and veggies to meet the dietary guidelines, we
might save the lives of more than one hundred thousand people a
year.3</p>
<p>You should eat more fruits and vegetables as if your life depended on
it, because maybe it does.</p>
<p>Garden Variety: Diversifying Your Vegetable Portfolio</p>
<p>Perhaps the least controversial advice in all of nutrition is to eat
more fruits and vegetables, which is to say eat more plants, since the
term vegetable basically just means all parts of the plant that aren’t
fruit. There are root vegetables like sweet potatoes, stem vegetables
like rhubarb, pod vegetables like peas, and even flower vegetables like
broccoli. (It isn’t called cauliflower for nothing.) We’ve already
talked about the leaf vegetables in the greens section. If dark-green,
leafy vegetables are the healthiest foods around, then why branch out to
other parts of the plant? (Pun intended!) Yes, you’re supposed to eat
the rainbow, but didn’t we just learn that green leaves have an entire
spectrum of colors hidden inside?</p>
<p>Unlike more generic compounds like vitamin C, which is broadly
available in various fruits and vegetables, other nutrients are not so
evenly distributed. Just as certain fruits like citrus offer unique
nonpigment phytonutrients not found in other fruits, different
vegetables contribute different compounds. White cauliflower, lacking
antioxidant pigments, doesn’t appear to have much to offer at first
glance, but because it belongs to the cruciferous family, it’s one of
your healthiest options. Similarly, white mushrooms may look pretty
drab, but they can provide myconutrients not found in the entire plant
kingdom.</p>
<p>We now know that certain phytonutrients bind to specific receptors
and other proteins in the body. I talked about the Ah “broccoli
receptors” in chapter 5. There are also effectively green-tea receptors
in your body—that is, receptors for EGCG, a key component of green tea.
There are binding proteins for the phytonutrients in grapes, onions, and
capers. Recently, a cell surface receptor was even identified for a
nutrient concentrated in apple peels. These specific proteins may not be
activated, though, unless you eat specific foods.4</p>
<p>The different phytonutrient profiles may then result in different
clinical effects. For example, drinking tomato juice can rescue the
immune function of study subjects crippled by two weeks of fruit and
vegetable deficiency, but carrot juice apparently cannot.5 Even
different parts of the same vegetable can have different effects. One of
the reasons certain tomato products appear to be protective against
heart attacks6 is because the yellow fluid surrounding the seeds
concentrates a compound that suppresses platelet activation.7 (Platelets
are what help trigger the blood clots that cause heart attacks and most
strokes.) Aspirin has a similar effect, but it doesn’t work in everyone
and can increase bleeding risk—two limitations that the tomato compound
may be able to overcome.8,9 But if you only consume tomato sauce, juice,
or ketchup, you may be missing out10 since the seeds are removed during
processing. So when picking out canned tomato products, choose whole,
crushed, or diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, purée, or paste.</p>
<p>Different plants may also affect the same part of the body in
different ways. Consider mental function, for instance. In a study of
dozens of fruits and vegetables, from raspberries to rutabagas, certain
plants appear to shore up specific cognitive domains. For example, the
consumption of some plant foods was associated with better executive
function, perceptual speed, and semantic (fact-based) memory, while the
consumption of others was more consistently associated with
visual-spatial skills and autobiographical memory.11 In other words, you
may need to build up a portfolio of many fruits and vegetables to cover
all your bases.</p>
<p>One of the reasons studies may underestimate the protective effects
of plant foods is that they tend to measure quantity of fruit and
vegetable consumption rather than quality of fruit and vegetable
consumption. People are more likely to eat bananas and cucumbers than
blueberries and kale. But variety is important too. Half the fruit
servings in the United States are taken up by just five fruits—apples
and apple juice, bananas, grapes, orange juice, and watermelon—and most
vegetable servings are from canned tomatoes, potatoes, and iceberg
lettuce.12</p>
<p>In one of the few studies that looked specifically at the diversity
of fruit and vegetable consumption, the variety of intake was an even
better predictor of decreased inflammation in the bodies of middle-aged
adults than the absolute quantity of consumption.13 Even after removing
the effects of quantity, the addition of two different types of fruits
and vegetables per week has been associated with an 8 percent reduction
in the incidence of type 2 diabetes.14 These kinds of data led the
American Heart Association to add a recommendation in their latest
dietary guidelines to also eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.15
It’s an important addition; otherwise, a big bag of potato chips or one
head of iceberg lettuce could technically fulfill or exceed your
recommended nine servings a day.</p>
<p>It’s better to eat a whole orange rather than take a vitamin C pill,
since the pill deprives you of all the other wonderful nutrients in the
oranges themselves. The same principle applies when you don’t diversify
your fruit and vegetable consumption. By only eating apples, you also
miss out on oranges’ nutrients. You don’t get the limonoids in citrus,
like limonin, limonol, or tangeretin, though you may get more malic acid
(from the Latin malum, meaning apple). When it comes to the unique
phytonutrient profile of each fruit and vegetable, it’s like comparing
apples to oranges! That’s why you should mix it up.</p>
<p>In a sense, though, all fruits are just fruits, whereas vegetables
can be any other part of the plant. Roots may harbor different nutrients
than shoots. For this reason, it may be even more important to get in a
variety of vegetables, so you can benefit from all parts of the plant,
as one large cancer study of nearly a half-million people did indeed
find.16 “Because each vegetable contains a unique combination,” a recent
review concluded, “a great diversity of vegetables should be eaten … to
get all the health benefits.”17 Variety is not only the spice of life;
it may prolong it as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eating Better to Look Better</p>
<p>We’ve all heard of the proverbial golden glow that’s often equated
with health, vitality, and youth. But instead of using a tanning bed to
achieve a more golden hue, you can do it with a bed of greens.</p>
<p>There are certain animals who use diet to increase their sexual
attractiveness. Great tits, distinctive olive-and-black songbirds
ubiquitous throughout Europe and Asia, tend to prefer carotenoid-rich
caterpillars, which make their breast plumage brighter yellow, to become
more attractive to potential mates.18 Can a similar phenomenon be found
in humans?</p>
<p>Researchers took digital photographs of African, Asian, and Caucasian
men and women and asked others to manipulate the skin tone of their
faces with a dial until they reached what they perceived to be the
healthiest-looking color.19 Sure enough, both men and women preferred
the yellow “golden glow” that can be achieved through “dietary
carotenoid deposition in the skin.”20 In other words, by eating the
yellow and red pigments in fruits and vegetables, like beta-carotene in
sweet potatoes and lycopene in tomatoes, men and women may be able to
naturally acquire more of a golden and rosy glow. Researchers decided to
put it to the test.</p>
<p>Based on a six-week study of college students, the complexion
achieved by eating my Daily Dozen recommendation of nine servings of
fruits and vegetables a day was found to be significantly healthier and
more attractive looking than that achieved by eating three daily
servings.21 The healthier you eat, the healthier you look. Indeed,
studies find that “individuals with the lowest fruit and vegetable
intake may enjoy the most improvement in appearance.”22</p>
<p>What about wrinkles? A study out of Japan used the six-point Daniell
scale to rate the extent of crow’s-feet wrinkles around the eyes of more
than seven hundred women, with a score of one being the least severe and
a score of six being the most severe. The researchers found that “a
higher intake of green and yellow vegetables was associated with
decreased facial wrinkling.” Women who ate less than one daily serving
of green and yellow veggies averaged about a three on the Daniell scale,
while women who ate more than two servings a day averaged closer to a
two. The researchers celebrated “the potential for these studies to
promote a healthy diet…”23</p>
<p>I am certainly not above appealing to vanity, especially for my
younger patients who have seemed more interested in which dietary
changes will clear their acne than which will clear their future risk of
chronic disease. So I’m happy to see articles embrace these types of
studies with headlines like “Greens to Be Gorgeous.”24 Still, although
looking great on the outside is fine, looking great on the inside is
even better.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mushrooming Benefits</p>
<p>Ergothioneine is an unusual amino acid. Although it was discovered
more than a century ago, it was ignored until recently when researchers
found that humans have a transporter protein in their bodies
specifically designed to pull ergothioneine out of food and into body
tissue. This suggests that this amino acid plays some important
physiological role. But what? Our first clue was the tissue
distribution. Ergothioneine concentrates in parts of your body where
there is a lot of oxidative stress—your liver and the lenses of your
eyes, for example, as well as such sensitive tissues as bone marrow and
semen. Researchers guessed, then, that it might act as a so-called
cytoprotectant, a cell protector, and that’s indeed what was
subsequently found.25</p>
<p>Ergothioneine appears to function as a potent intramitochondrial
antioxidant, meaning it can get inside the mitochondria—the microscopic
power plants within your cells. The DNA inside the mitochondria is
especially vulnerable to free-radical damage, since many other
antioxidants are unable to penetrate the mitochondrial membrane. This is
one reason ergothioneine may be so important. Depriving human cells of
this amino acid leads to accelerated DNA damage and cell death.
Unfortunately, the human body cannot make ergothioneine; you can only
get it through food. “Because of its dietary origin and the toxicity
associated with its depletion,” Johns Hopkins University researchers
concluded, “ET [ergothioneine] may represent a new vitamin…”26 If it
were classified as such, that would make it the first new vitamin since
vitamin B12 was isolated back in 1948.27</p>
<p>What are the best dietary sources of ergothioneine? The highest
levels by far have been reported in mushrooms. For example, oyster
mushrooms, which you can grow yourself in only two weeks from a
just-add-water kit, have more than one thousand units (μg/dag) of
ergothioneine, about nine times more than their closest competitor,
black beans. And a serving of black beans has about eight times more
than a serving of the third-leading source, chicken liver. Chicken meat,
along with beef and pork, only has about ten units, one hundred times
less than oyster mushrooms. Kidney beans have about four times more than
meat, but even at forty-five units, they pale in comparison to some of
the mushrooms.28</p>
<p>Ergothioneine is heat stable, which means it’s not destroyed when
mushrooms are cooked.29 This is good news, because it’s best not to eat
mushrooms raw; there’s a toxin in edible mushrooms called agaritine to
which you should minimize your exposure. Thankfully, the toxin is
destroyed by cooking. Just thirty seconds in the microwave wipes out
most agaritine in mushrooms. Freezing also gets rid of most of it, but
drying does not. If you put dried mushrooms in your soup, it’s best to
boil them for at least five minutes.30 Morel mushrooms are a special
case. The toxin levels appear higher and may react with alcohol even
after cooking.31 I consider all other cooked edible mushrooms to be
green-light foods and all other edible raw mushrooms yellow-light foods.
However, raw morel mushrooms, cooked morels served with alcohol, and all
wild-foraged mushrooms should be on the red-light list in my
opinion.</p>
<p>Do you have to eat mushrooms to be healthy? No. (Otherwise, it would
be the Daily Baker’s Dozen.) Famously in our family, my mom has never
eaten a mushroom in her life and never will, because they “look funny.”
But given the potential immune and anticancer benefits documented in
chapters 5 and 11, I would encourage you to try to find ways to
incorporate them into your diet.</p>
<p>My favorite way to enjoy mushrooms is to grill portobellos. I picked
up a George Foreman Grill from my local thrift store, and my family has
officially renamed it the Portobello Mushroom Grill. I know people tend
to marinate portobellos first, but I just drizzle them with balsamic
vinegar, grill until the juice starts dripping, and then add cracked
pepper. They’re so good we eat them just like that.</p>
<p>Pop quiz: Which is healthier? Plain white mushrooms or portobellos?
Trick question! They’re the same mushroom. The little white button
mushrooms grow up to be portobellos. White mushrooms are just baby
’bellos.</p>
<p>Mushrooms can be stuffed, enjoyed in soups like mushroom barley, act
as the star of a creamy risotto or pâté, serve as the base of a great
gravy or as a flavorful addition to any pasta sauce, or simply be
braised with crushed garlic in red wine.</p>
<p>Even More Vegetables!</p>
<p>My favorite way to eat raw veggies is to dip bell pepper strips,
carrots, or snap peas in a hummus or bean dip, and my favorite way to
eat them cooked is by roasting them. Roasting can transform vegetables
into otherworldly creations. If you don’t believe me, try roasting red
bell peppers, brussels sprouts, beets, or squash. Never thought you
liked okra because it’s too slimy? Try it roasted.</p>
<p>One of my favorite springtime dishes is roasted asparagus dipped in
guacamole. (Here’s an interesting asparagus fact: Did you know there are
four types of people in the world? Those whose pee turns stinky after
eating asparagus, and those whose doesn’t, and those who are apparently
genetically incapable of smelling the asparagus pee odor, and, finally,
those who can. So some people may not think they get stinky pee from
asparagus, but they actually do and just can’t smell it!32)</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes are one of my favorite snacks. During harsh Boston
winters while I was in medical school, I would take two freshly
microwaved sweet potatoes and pop them in my coat pockets as natural
hand warmers. When they cooled down, my hand warmers became instant
healthy snacks! It’s actually better to boil them, though, to best
preserve their nutritional content.33 Regardless of your cooking method,
be sure to keep on the skin. The peel of the sweet potato has nearly ten
times the antioxidant power as the inner flesh (on a per-weight basis),
giving them an antioxidant capacity approaching that of
blueberries.34</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes themselves can be considered a superfood.35 They are
ranked as one of the healthiest foods on the planet36 and one day,
perhaps, even off the planet—NASA has chosen them for future space
missions.37 In fact, they’re among the healthiest and cheapest, with one
of the highest nutrient-rich food scores per dollar.38 When picking out
varieties at the supermarket, remember that a sweet potato’s nutritional
content is tied directly to the intensity of its color. The more yellow
or orange its flesh, the healthier it may be.39</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes are healthier than plain potatoes, but if you’re going
to choose the latter, seek out those with blue or purple flesh. The
consumption of one boiled purple potato a day for six weeks was found to
significantly decrease inflammation, something neither white nor yellow
potatoes were able to accomplish.40 The same was found for oxidation,
but much faster. Within hours of consumption, purple potatoes increased
the antioxidant capacity of study subjects’ bloodstream, whereas white
potato starch appeared to actually have a pro-oxidant effect.41 Blue
potatoes may have ten times more antioxidant power than regular white
ones.42 The most exciting purple potato study to date had people with
hypertension eat six to eight microwaved small purple potatoes a day,
and they were able to significantly bring down their blood pressure
levels within a month.43</p>
<p>Purple sweet potatoes may offer the best of both worlds.44 I was so
excited to discover them that I bought them as holiday gifts for my
family one year—stocking stuffers they could stuff themselves with!</p>
<hr />
<p>Getting Kids (and Parents) to Eat Their Veggies</p>
<p>Published strategies for getting kids (of all ages) to eat their
vegetables include cutting them into slices, sticks, or stars—the most
popular shape.45 Supposedly, putting an Elmo sticker on veggies swayed
50 percent of children to choose broccoli over a chocolate bar.46 If
they’re still not biting, though, you can apply the same trick I use to
get our dog to take her pills: Dip the veggies in peanut butter. A study
found that pairing vegetables with peanut butter successfully increases
intake “even in vegetable-resistant children.”47 Offering a salad
dressing dip has also been found to help.48</p>
<p>Simply having healthy foods out and available can boost intake. Guess
what happened when researchers put out bowls of cut-up fresh fruit in
addition to the regular party fare brought by parents for kindergarten
or preschool celebrations? No special effort was made to encourage
students to choose the fruit—the researchers just put it out on the
table with all the other food. Would kids actually eat fruit when such
foods as birthday cake, ice cream, and cheese puffs were available? Yes!
On average, each kid ate a full fruit serving.49 Take that, cheese
puffs!</p>
<p>Even just calling vegetables by different names can help. Elementary
schools were able to double vegetable consumption simply by coming up
with names that better appealed to the kids. Students ate twice the
number of carrots if they were called “X-Ray Vision Carrots,” compared
to when they were just carrots or generically called the “Food of the
Day.”50 Are adults as gullible? Apparently so. For example, grown-ups
reported “Traditional Cajun Red Beans and Rice” tasted better than just
“Red Beans with Rice” … even though they were the exact same dish.51</p>
<p>When school cafeterias put out signs like Power Punch Broccoli and
Silly Dilly Green Beans, or called broccoli Tiny Tasty Tree Tops,
selection of broccoli increased by about 110 percent, and selection of
green beans jumped by nearly 180 percent.52 The researchers concluded
that “these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to
describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective,
persistent, and scalable with little or no money or experience. These
names were not carefully crafted, discussed in focus groups, and then
pretested.” They were just invented out of thin air. And kids were
suckered into eating healthier for weeks simply by adults’ putting out
silly little signs. Indeed, in the school displaying these playful new
names in the cafeteria line, vegetable purchasing went up nearly 100
percent, while in the control school without signs, vegetable purchases
started low and actually got worse.53 So why isn’t every single school
in the country doing this right now? Bring it up at your next PTA
meeting.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the hide-the-veggies strategy. Studies have shown
that broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini can be added
covertly to familiar entrées such that the appearance, flavor, and
texture of the original recipes are maintained (like puréeing vegetables
into a pasta sauce).54 Studies found the trick works for adults too.
Researchers were able to slip in up to a pound of clandestine vegetables
a day (resulting in 350 fewer calories eaten).55 Surreptitiously
incorporating vegetables into foods shouldn’t be the only way that
vegetables are served to children, though. Since the appetite for an
initially unappetizing vegetable can be increased through repeated
exposure, it is important to use several strategies to ensure that kids
experience whole vegetables. After all, they’re not always going to be
eating at home. One of the most important predictors of children’s fruit
and vegetable consumption has been found to be parents’ consumption,56
so if you want your kids to eat healthfully, it helps to be a healthy
role model.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Top Cancer-Fighting Vegetables</p>
<p>According to a landmark American Institute for Cancer Research
report, any effect of plant-based diets is “likely to be due not only to
the exclusion of meat, but also to the inclusion of a larger number and
of wider range of plant foods, containing an extensive variety of
potential cancer-preventive substances.”57 In other words, it may not be
enough to cut down on meat; you need to eat as many whole, healthy plant
foods as possible. Meatless Mondays are great, but even more so when
followed by Tomato Tuesdays, Watercress Wednesdays, and so on.</p>
<p>Different vegetables may target different cancers—sometimes even in
the same organ. For example, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and
brussels sprouts are associated with lower risk of colon cancer in the
middle and right side of your body, whereas risk of colon cancer farther
down on the left side appears to be lowered more by carrots, pumpkins,
and apples.58</p>
<p>An extraordinary study published in the journal Food Chemistry pitted
thirty-four common vegetables in vitro against eight different types of
human cancer cells: breast cancer, brain tumors, kidney cancer, lung
cancer, childhood brain tumors, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and
stomach cancer. Take breast cancer, for example. Seven vegetables
(eggplant, bok choy, carrot, tomato, endive, fennel bulb, and romaine
lettuce) appeared useless, suppressing breast cancer cell growth no more
than the control. Six vegetables (orange bell pepper, english cucumber,
radicchio, jalapeño, potato, and beetroot) nearly halved cancer growth,
but five veggies (cauliflower, brussels sprouts, green onion, leek, and
garlic) “abolished” cancer growth completely, stopping breast tumor
cells dead in their tracks.59</p>
<p>There were two take-home messages to come out of this remarkable
study. The first is that you should eat a portfolio of vegetables.
Radishes, for example, are completely unable to stop pancreatic cancer
cell growth. However, radishes were 100 percent effective at halting the
growth of stomach cancer cells. Orange bell peppers were useless against
stomach cancer, but they were able to suppress prostate cancer cell
growth by more than 75 percent. In the words of the researchers, “a
diversified diet, containing several distinct classes of vegetables (and
hence of phytochemicals) is essential for effective prevention of
cancer.”60</p>
<p>How to Make a Cancer-Fighting Salad</p>
<p>Imagine you’re standing in line at one of those made-to-order salad
places where you get to choose your lettuce, your toppings, and your
dressing. You start with the greens. For the sake of this example, let’s
say you are offered a choice between the five covered in the Food
Chemistry study: Boston lettuce, endive, radicchio, romaine lettuce, and
spinach. Which should you choose? Based on the study findings: spinach.
Out of the five options, spinach beat out the others against breast
cancer, brain tumors, kidney cancer, lung cancer, pediatric brain
tumors, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. The
runner up? Radicchio.61</p>
<p>Which toppings should you add to your spinach salad? You only get
five to choose from and, after consulting the Daily Dozen cheat sheet in
your wallet, you can tick three check boxes immediately: beans, berries,
and nuts. Now you only have two toppings left. Out of the thirty-two
remaining vegetables included in the study, which two of the following
should you pick? Choose carefully:</p>
<hr />
<p>Acorn squash</p>
<p>Asparagus</p>
<p>Beetroot</p>
<p>Bok choy</p>
<p>Boston lettuce</p>
<p>Broccoli</p>
<p>Brussels sprouts</p>
<p>Cabbage</p>
<p>Carrot</p>
<p>Cauliflower</p>
<p>Celery</p>
<p>Curly cabbage</p>
<p>Eggplant</p>
<p>Endive</p>
<p>English cucumber</p>
<p>Fennel bulb</p>
<p>Fiddleheads</p>
<p>Garlic</p>
<p>Green beans</p>
<p>Green onions</p>
<p>Jalapeño</p>
<p>Kale</p>
<p>Leek</p>
<p>Orange bell pepper</p>
<p>Potato</p>
<p>Radicchio</p>
<p>Radish</p>
<p>Red cabbage</p>
<p>Romaine lettuce</p>
<p>Rutabaga</p>
<p>Tomato</p>
<p>Yellow onion</p>
<hr />
<p>Which two did you choose? If one of your choices was brussels
sprouts, cabbage, curly cabbage, or kale, and the other choice was
garlic, green onions, or leek, you get a gold star! Of all the
vegetables tested, those had the most cancer-preventing potential.
Notice anything they have in common? All the top choices belong to one
of only two superfood families: cruciferous vegetables and the allium
veggie family, which includes garlic and onions. As the researchers put
it, “the inclusion of cruciferous and Allium vegetables in the diet is
essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive
[cancer-preventing] strategies.”62</p>
<p>Note that the most common vegetables didn’t make the cut. “The
majority of the vegetable extracts tested in this study, including
vegetables that are commonly consumed in Western countries such as
potato, carrot, lettuce and tomato,” the researchers concluded, “had
little effect on the proliferation of the tumour cell lines.”63</p>
<p>The single most effective vegetable was garlic, which came in first
against breast cancer, both child and adult brain cancer, lung cancer,
pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer, and second after
leeks against kidney cancer. So might I suggest a garlicky salad
dressing like the one here?</p>
<p>Garlic and Onions</p>
<p>As the above salad example illustrates, garlic, onions, leeks, and
other vegetables in the allium family appear to have special properties.
Wait a second, though. Like chemotherapy, maybe garlic isn’t just toxic
to cancer cells but toxic to all cells? That wouldn’t be good.
Researchers also wondered about this, so they decided to compare the
effects of garlic and other vegetables on the growth of both cancer
cells and normal cells. The same garlic dose that blocked nearly 80
percent of cancer cell proliferation appeared to have no effect
whatsoever against normal cells, and similar results were found for the
other allium and cruciferous vegetables. In other words, vegetables are
selective; they destroy cancer cells but leave normal cells alone.</p>
<p>These results were seen in a petri dish, though, and while such
studies may have direct relevance for digestive-tract cancers that come
in close contact with these foods, for these foods to be protective
against other cancers, the anticancer compounds would have to be
absorbed into the bloodstream. And in the case of brain tumors, the
anticancer compounds would additionally have to cross the blood-brain
barrier. The findings do seem to sync with other studies, though, both
among human populations and in other laboratories, that corroborate the
cancer-fighting benefits of cruciferous vegetables,64 garlic, and
onions.65 Regardless, this study illustrates the dramatic differences
between the biological capacities of individual vegetables and families
of veggies and underscores the importance of including a variety of
vegetables in your diet.</p>
<p>Which Is the Best Cooking Method?</p>
<p>Is it better to eat your vegetables raw or cooked? If you’re thinking
raw, you’re right. But if you guessed cooked, you’re also right.66
Confused? Well, a number of nutrients, like vitamin C, are partially
destroyed by cooking. For example, steamed broccoli may have about 10
percent less vitamin C than raw broccoli.67 If, however, you prefer
cooked broccoli enough to eat seven florets of steamed rather than six
florets of raw, then you just more than made up the difference.</p>
<p>Other nutrients, however, actually become more absorbable after
cooking. For example, you end up with more than six times the vitamin A
in your bloodstream from cooked carrots compared to raw ones.68 A study
of long-term raw foodists found surprisingly low blood levels of the red
antioxidant pigment lycopene.69 It’s not what you eat but what you
absorb, and cooked tomatoes appear able to better boost your lycopene
levels.70 Steaming may also improve the bile acid–binding capacity of
vegetables,71 which may help lower breast cancer risk.72</p>
<p>Raw-food diets automatically eliminate most red- and yellow-light
foods, which is not only an improvement over the standard American diet
but also over many plant-based diets. There is no evidence to suggest,
however, that eating raw foods largely or exclusively is healthier than
eating a combination of cooked and raw whole plant foods.</p>
<p>Some cooking methods, though, are preferable to others. Deep-fried
foods, whether of plant origin (like french fries) or from animals (like
fried chicken), have been associated with higher cancer risk.73
Deep-frying leads to the production of dangerous heterocyclic amines in
meat (as detailed in chapter 11) and to acrylamide in deep-fried plant
foods. The excess lifetime cancer risk attributable to the consumption
of french fries in young children, for example, may be as high as one or
two in ten thousand—meaning about one in ten thousand boys and girls
eating french fries may develop cancer that would have otherwise not
occurred had they not eaten french fries. The researchers urge
deep-fryer cooking times and temperatures be set as low as possible
“while still maintaining a tasty quality.”74 (They wouldn’t want to
reduce cancer so much that the deep-fried foods wouldn’t be as tasty!)
Blanching potatoes first can reduce acrylamide formation, but potato
chip companies argue that this might have a negative impact on the
“nutritional properties of the fried product,” because it would leach
away some of the vitamin C.75 But if you’re relying on potato chips to
get your vitamin C, acrylamide is probably the least of your
worries.</p>
<p>What is the best way to cook vegetables to preserve nutrition? I am
often asked that question, and it’s difficult to answer, as it varies
for different vegetables. What we would need is a study that measures a
variety of different cooking methods with a variety of different
vegetables. Thankfully, we got exactly that in 2009. A Spanish research
team pulled out all the stops, performing more than three hundred
separate experiments with twenty vegetables and six cooking methods, all
while considering three different measures of antioxidant activity. They
tested baking, boiling, frying, griddling (cooking in a thick frying pan
with no oil), microwaving, and pressure-cooking.76</p>
<p>Let’s start with the worst methods in terms of antioxidant loss:
boiling and pressure-cooking. When you use these wet-cooking methods,
some of the nutrition is lost into the cooking water, but less than I
would have thought. For instance, the researchers found that boiling
removes an average of 14 percent of the vegetables’ antioxidant
capacity. So, if you like your corn on the cob boiled, you could just
add an extra quarter ear to the pot. (Six quarters boiled may have all
the antioxidant power of five quarters raw, baked, or microwaved.77) Of
the six cooking methods studied, griddling and microwaving were actually
the gentlest. Nuking your veggies appears to preserve, on average, more
than 95 percent of antioxidant capacity.78</p>
<p>Those are averages across twenty vegetables, however. Some vegetables
are more resistant, and antioxidant power actually increases with
cooking in some veggies. Which do you think was the most vulnerable
vegetable—that is, the one probably best eaten raw? If you guessed bell
peppers, you’re right. They’ve been shown to lose up to 70 percent of
their antioxidant capacity when baked in an oven. I’m going to continue
to roast my peppers because of how much I love the taste, but I realize
I’m getting less nutritional bang for my buck. (No biggie, though,
because I can just add an extra sprinkle of oregano to my roasted red
pepper pasta sauce.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, three vegetables hardly seem to be affected at all
by cooking: artichokes, beets, and onions. You can even boil them, and
they’ll still retain 97.5 percent of their antioxidant power.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two vegetables that may actually become healthier
through cooking: the humble carrot and the celery stalk. No matter how
you prepare them—even by boiling—carrots and celery appear to gain in
antioxidant power. Green beans get an honorable mention, because they
increase in antioxidant power when cooked by all methods except boiling
or pressure-cooking. Microwaved green beans, for example, have more
antioxidants than raw. So go ahead and make a nice vegetable soup and
boost the ingredients’ antioxidant content at the same time.</p>

<p>How to Make Your Own Fruit and Vegetable Wash</p>
<p>Buying organic foods reduces your exposure to pesticides, but it
doesn’t eliminate them entirely. Pesticide residues have been detected
in 11 percent of organic crop samples due to accidental or fraudulent
use, cross-contamination from neighboring nonorganic fields, or the
lingering presence of persistent pollutants like DDT in the soil.79</p>
<p>There are many commercial fruit and vegetable wash products that
purport to improve the removal of pesticides, but a variety have been
tested and appear to be a complete waste of money.80 For example,
Procter andandandand Gamble had a product that claimed it was “proven to
be 98% more effective than water in removing pesticides.” When it was
put to the test, though, it did no better than plain tap water.81
Rinsing produce under running water generally removes less than half of
the pesticide residue.82 A fingernail-polish-remover acetone bath has
been found to be more effective at removing pesticides,83 but of course
I’m not advocating dunking your fruits and veggies in that! The goal is
to make your tomato less toxic.</p>
<p>One effective method is to use a 5 percent acetic-acid bath—in other
words, plain white vinegar, which has been found to remove the bulk of
certain pesticide residues.84 But 5 percent is full strength, and it
would get expensive buying gallons of white vinegar just to wash your
fruits and veggies. Unfortunately, a diluted white-vinegar bath only
seems marginally more effective than tap water.85</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a solution that is both cheap and effective:
salt water. A 10 percent saltwater rinse has been found to work as well
as full-strength vinegar.86 To make your own pesticide-reducing bath,
add one part salt to nine parts water. Just make sure to rinse off all
the salt before eating.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is Buying Organic Worth It?</p>
<p>Stroll down the produce aisle of your grocery store. You’ll see lots
of foods labeled “organic,” but what does that really mean?</p>
<p>According to the USDA, organic farming practices preserve the
environment and avoid most synthetic materials, including pesticides and
antibiotics. Among other requirements, organic farmers must receive
annual on-site inspections, use only USDA-approved materials, and not
use genetically modified crops. In order to be counted in the 5 billion
U.S. organic retail market, products receive a USDA organic stamp.87</p>
<p>The fact is that being organic doesn’t mean a food is healthy. The
organic food industry didn’t become so lucrative by selling carrots. For
instance, you can now buy pesticide-free potato chips and organic jelly
beans.88 There are even organic Oreo cookies. Junk food is still junk
food, even if it was produced organically. The organic label cannot turn
red lights green.</p>
<p>Many are surprised to learn (I know I was!) that a review of hundreds
of studies found that organic produce does not seem to have
significantly more vitamins and minerals. Organic fruits and vegetables
do, however, appear to have more nontraditional nutrients like
polyphenol antioxidants,89 thought to be because conventionally grown
plants given high-dose synthetic nitrogen fertilizers may divert more
resources to growth rather than defense.90 This may be why, as we
learned in chapter 4, organic berries appear to suppress cancer growth
better than conventional berries in vitro.</p>
<p>Based on its elevated antioxidant levels, organic produce may be
considered 20–40 percent healthier, the equivalent of adding one or two
servings’ worth to a five-a-day regimen. But organic produce may be 40
percent more expensive, so for the same money, you could just buy the
extra servings’ worth of conventional produce. From a purely
nutrients-per-dollar standpoint, it’s not clear that organic foods are
any better.91 But people don’t just buy organic foods because they’re
healthier—what about safety?</p>
<p>Conventional produce appears to have twice the levels of cadmium, one
of the three toxic heavy metals in the food supply, along with mercury
and lead.92 The cadmium is thought to come from the phosphate
fertilizers that are added to conventional crops.93 The greatest concern
most people have about conventionally grown produce, though, is the
pesticide residues.</p>
<p>People not only tend to overestimate the nutritional benefit of
organic food, they also overestimate the risks of pesticides.94 For
example, surveys have found that many consumers erroneously believe that
just as many people die from pesticide residues on conventional food as
they do from automobile accidents,95 or that eating nonorganic produce
is almost as bad as smoking a daily pack of cigarettes.96 This kind of
thinking is dangerous, as it could lead to a decrease in overall fruit
and vegetable consumption.</p>
<p>If just half of the U.S. population were to increase fruit and
vegetable consumption by a single serving per day, an estimated twenty
thousand cancer cases might be avoided each year. This estimate was
calculated using conventional produce, so the additional pesticide
burden from all that extra produce might be expected to cause ten new
cancer cases. On balance, the study suggested, if half of Americans ate
one more serving of produce per day, we’d prevent 19,990 people from
becoming cancer patients every year. Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this paper was written by scientists-for-hire paid by
conventional produce growers, so they had an incentive to exaggerate the
benefits and downplay the risks.97 Nevertheless, I think the bottom line
is sound. You receive tremendous benefit from eating conventional fruits
and vegetables that far outweighs whatever little bump in risk you may
get from the pesticides.98 But why accept any risk at all when you can
choose organic? My own family buys organic whenever we can, but we never
let concern about pesticides stop us from stuffing our faces with as
many fruits and vegetables as possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>At least half your plate should be filled with vegetables. Here’s a
simple rule: Include vegetables in everything, and the more the better.
Bean burritos are better than carnitas, but better still is a bean
burrito with lots of veggies wrapped inside. Instead of spaghetti with
marinara sauce, make it spaghetti with marinara sauce … and loads of
veggies. Marinara is certainly better than Alfredo, but it’s even better
still to go the extra veggie mile and heap on your favorite
vegetables.</p>
<p>Flaxseeds</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Flaxseeds</p>
<p>Golden or brown</p>
<p>Serving Size:</p>
<p>1 tablespoon ground</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>1 serving per day</p>
<hr />
<p>I have talked about the wonders of flaxseeds in a few of this book’s
earlier chapters, including those on high blood pressure (chapter 7),
breast cancer (chapter 11), and prostate cancer (chapter 13). Remember
how flaxseeds apparently offer “miraculous defense against some critical
maladies”?</p>
<p>Okay, you’re convinced. But just where do you get flaxseeds, and how
do you best use them?</p>
<p>You can buy flaxseeds in bulk at natural foods stores for just a few
dollars per pound. They come in nature’s finest packaging: a hard
natural hull that keeps them fresh. However, Mother Nature packs them a
little too well. If you eat flaxseeds whole, they’re likely to pass
right through you without releasing any of their nutrients. So, for best
results, first grind up the seeds with a blender or coffee or spice
grinder, or buy them preground or “milled.” (The other option is to chew
them really well.) Thanks to their antioxidant content, ground flaxseeds
should last at least four months at room temperature.1</p>
<p>Ground flax is a light, nutty powder that can be sprinkled on
oatmeal, salads, soups—frankly, just about anything you’re eating. You
can even bake with flax without damaging the lignans2 or omega-3 fatty
acids3 (unlike flaxseed oil). During medical school, I used to make a
few dozen flaxseed muffins at a time and put them in the freezer. Then
I’d pop one in the microwave every morning before I ran out the door and
get my daily flax fix while eating breakfast surreptitiously on the
subway.</p>
<hr />
<p>Are Fruit-and-Nut Bars Fattening?</p>
<p>There are a number of energy bars on the market containing only
green-light ingredients, such as dried fruits, seeds, and nuts. People
love them because they’re so easy to throw into a briefcase, backpack,
or purse and eat as a convenient snack on the go.</p>
<p>Dried fruits, seeds, and nuts are all nutrient-dense foods, but
they’re also calorie dense. Might concentrating so many calories into
such a small energy bar contribute to weight gain? To find out, Yale
University researchers split about one hundred overweight men and women
into two groups. All the participants ate their normal diet, but half
were told to add two fruit-and-nut bars daily. After two months, despite
the extra 340 calories a day from the bars, the fruit-and-nut bar group
did not gain any weight.4</p>
<p>Dried fruits and nuts appear to be so satiating that people feel full
and unintentionally offset the calories elsewhere throughout the day.
Studies on apple rings,5 figs,6 prunes,7 and raisins8 have found similar
results. In the apple study, postmenopausal women who added two apples’
worth of apple rings to their daily diet for six months not only didn’t
gain weight but experienced a whopping 24 percent drop in their LDL
(“bad”) cholesterol.9 (That’s nearly the effect you can get with some
statin drugs!) In general, the 7 percent of Americans who average a
tablespoon or more of dried fruit per day tend to be less overweight and
less obese, and they have slimmer waistlines and less abdominal obesity
than Americans who don’t eat as much dried fruit.10</p>
<p>Of course, when shopping for energy bars, it’s imperative that you
read their labels, as many brands have added sugars. Or you can just
save yourself some money and choose good old-fashioned trail mix. Better
yet, how about eating a piece of fresh fruit? Still, if the choice is
between an energy bar and a candy bar as an afternoon snack, the choice
is clear.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other Ways to Eat Flaxseeds</p>
<p>When you’re not sprinkling ground flax on your cereal, salads, or
soups or baking it into your muffins, there are plenty of other ways to
get your daily serving of flaxseeds. There are a lot of convenient flax
bars, crackers, and snacks on the market these days, a few of which even
have all green-light ingredients.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s pretty easy to make your own flax crackers. Mix two
cups of ground flaxseeds with a cup of water, add whatever herbs and
spices you want, and then spread the dough thinly on a parchment- or
silicone-lined baking sheet. Score the dough into thirty-two crackers
and bake at 400°F for about twenty minutes. To flavor mine, I use a half
teaspoon each of smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder, but
you should play around until you find a (salt-free) spice profile you
prefer. When cut into thirty-two pieces, each cracker meets your Daily
Dozen serving requirement.</p>
<p>I also use my trusty discount dehydrator to make raw flax crackers.
All you do is mix a cup of whole flaxseeds with a cup of water along
with flavorful ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes and basil. After it
firms for about an hour and gets a jelly-like consistency, I spread it
out thinly and dehydrate away. Give it a try! Dip your flax crackers in
hummus or another bean dip for double check marks. Since you’re using
whole flaxseeds, though, make sure to chew thoroughly for maximum
benefit.</p>
<p>Flaxseeds have a wonderful binding quality that makes them a great
ingredient for thick, milkshake-like smoothies. Toss a tablespoon of
ground flax into a blender with some frozen berries, unsweetened soy
milk, and half a ripe banana or mango or a few dates for sweetness, and
you have a delicious drink containing both classes of protective
phytoestrogens—lignans in flax and isoflavones in soy. (See chapter 11.)
Blend in some cocoa powder for a chocolate milkshake that could help
improve your chances of both preventing and surviving breast and
prostate cancers.</p>
<p>This same binding quality makes flaxseeds a green-light thickener to
replace cornstarch. I use flax to make my favorite quickie stir-fry
sauce. I start with some bok choy and fresh mushrooms. The water
clinging to the bok choy after it’s rinsed, along with the liquid that
gets released from the mushrooms while cooking, is enough to flash-steam
the veggies in a hot pan without any added oil. Once the bok choy is
tender-crisp, I add a cup of water mixed with a tablespoon each of
tahini, ground flaxseeds, and Asian black-bean garlic sauce, a fermented
yellow-light condiment you can find in a jar at most large grocery
stores. Once the sauce thickens, it’s ready for some fresh ground pepper
(and hot sauce, if you’ve got that spicy tooth like I do) and …
voilà!</p>
<p>You can even use ground flaxseeds to replace eggs in baking. For each
egg in the recipe, whisk one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds with three
tablespoons of water until the mixture becomes gooey. Unlike chicken
eggs, “flax eggs” are not only cholesterol-free but they’re also packed
with soluble fiber to bring your cholesterol down11 instead of up.</p>
<hr />
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how these tiny little seeds can pack such
a health-promoting punch. With just a measly tablespoon a day and so
many delicious, easy ways to incorporate ground flax into your sips and
bites, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to tick this Daily Dozen
check box every day.</p>
<p>Nuts and Seeds</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Nuts and Seeds</p>
<p>Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, chia seeds, hazelnuts/filberts, hemp
seeds, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds,
sunflower seeds, and walnuts</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>¼ cup nuts or seeds</p>
<p>2 tablespoons nut or seed butter</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>1 serving per day</p>
<hr />
<p>Sometimes it feels like there just aren’t enough hours in a day to
get everything done. So instead of trying to make your day longer, why
not make your life longer by an extra two years? That’s about how long
your life span may be increased by eating nuts regularly—one handful (or
about a quarter of a cup) five or more days a week.1 Just that one
simple and delicious act alone may extend your life.</p>
<p>The Global Burden of Disease Study calculated that not eating enough
nuts and seeds was the third-leading dietary risk factor for death and
disability in the world, killing more people than processed meat
consumption. Insufficient nut and seed intake is thought to lead to the
deaths of millions of people every year, fifteen times more than all
those who die from overdoses of heroin, crack cocaine, and all other
illicit drugs combined.2</p>
<p>The Uses of Blended Nuts</p>
<p>Nuts make for quick and delicious snacks on their own, but my
personal favorite use for them is as green-light sources of fat to make
rich, creamy sauces. Whether in a cashew Alfredo, a ginger-peanut sauce,
or a tahini-based green goddess dressing, nuts and seeds can maximize
nutrient acquisition by both improving absorption and increasing your
total intake of vegetables by adding some creamy cachet.</p>
<p>An often overlooked use for nuts is as a key ingredient in soups,
such as African peanut stew. When blended and heated, cashews thicken to
make an amazingly creamy soup base. Nut and seed butters also pair well
with veggies and fruits. Most everyone loves the classic childhood
pairings of peanut butter with celery or apples. One of my favorite
treats is dipping fresh strawberries into a decadent chocolate sauce.
All you need is a half cup of an unsweetened milk, one tablespoon of
chia seeds, one tablespoon of cocoa, one teaspoon of almond butter, and
sweetener to taste. (I use one tablespoon of erythritol, discussed
here.) Mix all the ingredients, and heat until the almond butter melts
and the sweetener dissolves. Pour into a bowl, whisk until smooth, and
put it in the fridge to cool. The chia and fiber from the cocoa powder
help it thicken into an indulgent delight. (You can grind up the chia
seeds first, but I like the tapioca-like texture the little chia balls
form.)</p>
<p>Walnuts for the Win</p>
<p>Which nut is healthiest? Normally, my answer is whichever you’re most
willing and able to eat regularly, but walnuts really do seem to take
the lead. They have among the highest antioxidant3 and omega-34 levels,
and they beat out other nuts in vitro in suppressing cancer cell
growth.5 But how do walnuts fare outside the laboratory in real
life?</p>
<p>PREDIMED is one of the largest interventional dietary trials ever
performed. Interventional studies, if you remember, are those in which
participants are randomized to different diets to see who fares better.
This helps researchers avoid the problem of confounding variables when
trying to determine cause and effect in cohort studies. For example, in
major study6 after study7 after study,8 people who eat nuts tend to live
longer and suffer fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, and
respiratory disease. There was a lingering question, though: Did these
findings show causation or merely correlation? It could be possible,
after all, that nut eaters also tend to have other healthy lifestyle
behaviors. Maybe those who eat nuts are more likely to be, well, health
nuts. On the other hand, if scientists randomly assign thousands of
people to various levels of nut consumption and the nuttier group ends
up the healthiest, we could have more confidence that nuts aren’t just
associated with better health but actually cause better health. This is
what PREDIMED ended up doing.9</p>
<p>More than seven thousand men and women at high cardiovascular risk
were randomized into different diet groups and followed for years. One
of the groups received a free half pound of nuts every week. In addition
to eating more nuts, they were told to improve their diets in other
ways, such as eating more fruits and vegetables and less meat and dairy,
but weren’t as successful at any of those other goals compared to the
control group. Nevertheless, having a free half pound of nuts sent to
them every week for four consecutive years did indeed persuade them to
start eating more nuts.10 (It’s too bad the researchers couldn’t have
slipped in a little free broccoli too!)</p>
<p>At baseline, before the study even started, the thousands assigned to
the nut group were already eating about half an ounce of nuts a day.
Thanks to the ensuing freebies, they ended up bumping up their
consumption to a whole ounce (about a handful). As a result, the study
was able to determine what happens when people at high risk for heart
disease following a particular diet eat an extra half ounce of nuts
every day.</p>
<p>With no significant differences in meat and dairy intake, there were
no significant differences in saturated fat or cholesterol intake. So,
unsurprisingly, there were no significant differences in their blood
cholesterol levels or the subsequent number of heart attacks. However,
the added-nuts group did end up having significantly fewer strokes. In a
sense, all the dietary groups were eating stroke-promoting diets. People
in all the groups had strokes after eating each of the diets for
years—so, ideally, they’d instead choose diets that can stop or reverse
the disease process rather than encourage it. But for those not willing
to make major shifts in their diet, just the minor tweak of adding nuts
appeared to cut stroke risk in half.11 Those in the extra-nut-eating
group still had strokes, but only about half as many. If this works as
well in the general population, eighty-nine thousand strokes a year
would be prevented in the United States alone. That would be like ten
strokes an hour, around the clock, prevented simply by adding about four
walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts to the nation’s daily diet.</p>
<p>Regardless of which group participants were assigned to, those eating
more nuts each day had a significantly lower risk of dying prematurely
overall.12 Those who consumed more red- and yellow-light sources of
fat—olive oil or extra virgin olive oil—failed to have any survival
benefit.13 This is consistent with the way Ancel Keys, the so-called
father of the Mediterranean diet, viewed olive oil. He thought of its
benefit more as a means of replacing animal fats—that is, anything to
get people to eat less lard and butter.14</p>
<p>Of all the nuts studied in PREDIMED, the researchers found the
greatest benefits associated with walnuts, particularly for preventing
cancer deaths.15 People who ate more than three servings of walnuts per
week appeared to cut their risk of dying from cancer in half. A review
of the scientific literature concluded that “the far-reaching positive
effects of a plant-based diet that includes walnuts may be the most
critical message for the public.”16</p>
<p>The Power of a Pea-“Nut”</p>
<p>Did you know that peanuts actually aren’t nuts? Technically, they’re
legumes, but they’re often lumped together with true nuts in dietary
surveys and studies, so it’s been hard to tease out their effects.
Harvard University researchers worked to change that in the Nurses’
Health Study by specifically asking people about their peanut butter
intake. They found that women at high risk for heart disease who ate
nuts or a tablespoon of peanut butter five or more days a week appeared
to nearly halve their risk of suffering a heart attack compared to women
who ate a serving or less per week.17 This cross-protection between true
nuts and peanuts also appears to extend to fibrocystic breast disease.
Adolescent girls in high school who consumed just one or more servings
of peanuts a week appeared to have significantly lower risk of
developing lumpy breasts, which can be a marker for increased breast
cancer risk.18 PBandandandandJ to the rescue!</p>
<p>Nuts and Obesity: Weighing the Evidence</p>
<p>Nuts and nut butters are packed with nutrition—and calories. For
example, just two tablespoons of a nut or seed butter might contain
nearly two hundred calories. Nevertheless, it’s probably better to eat
two hundred calories of nut butter than two hundred calories of what
most Americans would eat otherwise. Given how concentrated nut calories
are—you’d have to eat nearly an entire head of cabbage to get the same
amount—if you add a serving of nuts to your daily diet, won’t you gain
weight?</p>
<p>To date, there have been about twenty clinical trials on nuts and
weight, and not a single one showed the weight gain you might expect.
All the studies showed less weight gain than predicted, no weight gain
at all, or weight loss—even after study subjects added a handful or two
of nuts to their daily diets.19 However, these studies lasted just a few
weeks or months. Perhaps prolonged nut consumption leads to weight gain?
That question has been examined six different ways in studies lasting up
to eight years. One found no significant change, and the other five
measures found significantly less weight gain and reduced risk of
abdominal obesity in those who ate more nuts.20</p>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be
created nor destroyed. If calories, which are units of energy, can’t
just disappear, then where are they all going? In one trial, for
instance, participants who ate up to 120 pistachios as an afternoon
snack every day for three months didn’t appear to gain a pound.21 How
could thirty thousand calories vanish into thin air?</p>
<p>One theory offered was dubbed the Pistachio Principle: Maybe nuts
just take a lot of work to eat. Pistachios are typically bought in their
shells, which slows consumption time, allowing your brain to better
regulate your appetite.22 Sounds plausible, but what about shelled nuts
like almonds and cashews? A study out of Japan did suggest that
increasing “dietary hardness” (meaning chewing difficulty) is associated
with a slimmer waist.23 Perhaps all that chewing simply tires you
out?</p>
<p>Then there’s the fecal-excretion theory. Many of the cell walls of
chewed almonds, for example, remain intact in the gastrointestinal
tract. In other words, it’s possible a lot of the calories in nuts just
never get digested and wind up in your waste because you didn’t chew
well enough. Both of these theories were put to the test by an
international group of researchers who gave participants either a half
cup of unshelled peanuts or a half cup of peanuts ground into peanut
butter. If either the Pistachio Principle or the fecal-extraction theory
were correct, the peanut-butter group would gain weight, since no
calories would be left in undigested nuts, and no calories would be
burned chewing. But in the end, neither group gained weight, so there
must be another answer.24</p>
<p>What about the dietary-compensation theory? The idea here is that
nuts are so satiating and good at suppressing appetite that you end up
eating less food overall. This could explain why some studies found that
people lost weight after eating nuts. To test this idea, Harvard Medical
School researchers gave two groups smoothies with the same number of
calories, but one contained walnuts, and the other didn’t. Despite
drinking the same amount of calories, the placebo (nut-free) smoothie
group reported feeling significantly less full than the walnut group.25
So, yes—it does seem that nuts can make you feel fuller faster than some
other foods.</p>
<p>At this point, it looks as if 70 percent of nut calories are lost
through dietary compensation and 10 percent are flushed as fat in your
feces.26 But what about the last 20 percent? Unless all the calories are
accounted for, you would still expect some weight gain. The answer
appears to lie in the ability of nuts to boost metabolism. When you eat
nuts, you burn more of your own fat. Researchers have found that while
control-diet subjects were burning about twenty grams of fat within an
eight-hour period, a group eating the same number of calories and fat,
but with walnuts included in their diet, burned off more—about
thirty-one grams of fat.27 If a pill could do that, drug companies would
be raking it in!</p>
<p>The bottom line? Yes, nuts are high in calories, but through a
combination of dietary compensation mechanisms, your body’s failure to
absorb some of the fat, and increased fat-burning metabolism, nuts can
be a lifeline without expanding your waistline.</p>
<p>Pistachio Nuts for Sexual Dysfunction</p>
<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the recurrent or persistent inability to
attain or maintain an erection for satisfactory sexual performance. It
is present in up to thirty million men in the United States and
approximately one hundred million men worldwide.28 Wait a second. The
United States has less than 5 percent of the world’s population yet up
to 30 percent of the impotence? We’re number one!</p>
<p>The reason may be due to our artery-clogging diet. Erectile
dysfunction and our number-one killer, coronary artery disease, are
actually two manifestations of the same disease—inflamed, clogged, and
crippled arteries—regardless of which organs are affected.29 Not to
worry, though, because Americans have red, white, and blue pills like
Viagra … right? The problem is that these pills just cover up the
symptoms of vascular disease and don’t do anything for the underlying
pathology.</p>
<p>Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disorder that uniformly
affects all major blood vessels in the body. Hardening of the arteries
can lead to softening of the penis, since stiffened arteries can’t relax
open and let the blood flow. Thus, erectile dysfunction may just be the
flaccid tip of the iceberg in terms of a systemic disorder.30 For
two-thirds of men showing up at emergency rooms with crushing chest
pain, their penises had been trying to warn them for years that
something was wrong with their circulation.31</p>
<p>Why does atherosclerosis tend to hit the penis first? The arteries in
the penis are half the size of the “widow-maker” coronary artery in the
heart. Therefore, the amount of plaque you wouldn’t even feel in the
heart could clog half the penile artery, causing symptomatic restriction
in blood flow.32 This is why erectile dysfunction has been called
“penile angina.”33 In fact, by measuring blood flow in a man’s penis
with ultrasound, doctors can predict the results of his cardiac stress
test with an accuracy of 80 percent.34 Male sexual function is like a
penile stress test, a “window into the hearts of men.”35</p>
<p>In medical school, we were taught the forty-over-forty rule: 40
percent of men over age forty have erectile dysfunction. Men with
erection difficulties in their forties have a fiftyfold increased risk
of having a cardiac event (like sudden death).36</p>
<p>We used to think of erectile dysfunction in younger men (those under
age forty) as “psychogenic”—meaning it’s all in their heads. But now
we’re realizing that ED is more likely an early sign of vascular
disease. Some experts believe that a man with erectile dysfunction—even
if he doesn’t have cardiac symptoms—“should be considered a cardiac …
patient until proved otherwise.”37</p>
<p>The reason even young men should care about their cholesterol levels
is because they predict erectile dysfunction later in life,38 which in
turn predicts heart attacks, strokes, and a shortened life span.39 As
one medical journal put it, the take-home message is that “ED = Early
Death.”40</p>
<p>What does this have to do with nuts? A clinical study found that men
who ate three to four handfuls of pistachios a day for three weeks
experienced a significant improvement in blood flow through the penis,
accompanied by significantly firmer erections. The researchers concluded
that three weeks of pistachios “resulted in a significant improvement in
erectile function … without any side effects.”41</p>
<p>This is not just a male issue. Women with higher cholesterol levels
report significantly lower arousal, orgasm, lubrication, and sexual
satisfaction. Atherosclerosis of the pelvic arteries can lead to
decreased vaginal engorgement and “clitoral erectile insufficiency
syndrome,” defined as “failure to achieve clitoral tumescence
[engorgement].” This is thought to be an important factor in female
sexual dysfunction.42 We learned from the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study
that eating just two handfuls of nuts weekly may extend a woman’s life
as much as jogging four hours a week.43 So eating healthier may not only
extend your love life but also your entire life.</p>
<p>Why are beans, nuts, and whole grains so health promoting? Maybe it’s
because they are all seeds. Think about it: All it takes for an acorn to
explode into an oak tree is water, air, and sunlight. Everything else is
contained within the seed, which possesses the entire complex of
protective nutrients required to mature into a plant or tree. Whether
you’re eating a black bean, a walnut, a grain of brown rice, or a sesame
seed, in essence you’re getting the whole plant in a tiny little
package. As two noted nutrition experts concluded, “[D]ietary
recommendations should embrace a wide array of seeds as part of a
plant-based dietary pattern…”44</p>
<hr />
<p>Nuts may be the easiest and tastiest Daily Dozen check box to check
off. For those with peanut or tree nut allergies, seeds and seed butters
can often be used as safe alternatives. But what about nut consumption
if you have diverticulosis? For fifty years, doctors have told patients
with this common intestinal condition to avoid nuts, seeds, and popcorn,
but when the issue was finally put to the test, it turns out these
healthy foods actually appear to be protective.45 So diverticulosis
shouldn’t stop you from meeting this Daily Dozen mark, either. This one
simple and delicious act could add years to your life without adding on
pounds.</p>
<p>Herbs and Spices</p>

<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Herbs and Spices</p>
<p>Allspice, barberries, basil, bay leaves, cardamom, chili powder,
cilantro, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, curry powder, dill,
fenugreek, garlic, ginger, horseradish, lemongrass, marjoram, mustard
powder, nutmeg, oregano, smoked paprika, parsley, pepper, peppermint,
rosemary, saffron, sage, thyme, turmeric, and vanilla</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>¼ teaspoon of turmeric, along with any other (salt-free) herbs and
spices you enjoy</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s a simple tip: Use your senses to pick out healthy foods. There
is a good biological reason you should be so attracted to the vibrant
colors found in the produce aisle: In many cases, the colors are the
antioxidants. You can figure out which of two tomatoes has more
antioxidants just by looking at which has a deeper red color. Of course,
the food industry tries to hijack this natural instinct for colorful
foods with abominations like Froot Loops, but if you stick to
green-light foods, you can let color guide you. The same is true, we’re
now realizing, with flavor.</p>
<p>Just as many of the plant pigments are beneficial, scientists are
discovering that many of the flavor compounds in herbs and spices are
powerful antioxidants as well.1 Guess where the antioxidant rosmarinic
acid is found? What about cuminal, thymol, and gingerols? The flavors
are the antioxidants. You can use this knowledge to help you make
decisions at the grocery store. You can see that red onions have more
antioxidants than white, and you can taste that regular onions have more
antioxidants than mellower, milder Vidalia-type onions.2</p>
<p>The bitter and pungent compounds in the cruciferous and allium
families are thought to be responsible for their health benefits.
Intense colors and intense flavors can be signs of intense benefit. For
optimum health, you should try to eat both colorful and flavorful foods.
Indeed, the dietary guidelines for a number of countries now
specifically encourage the consumption of herbs and spices, not only as
a substitute for salt but for the healthy properties they have in their
own right.3 And on the top of my list of healthful herbs and spices is
turmeric—a spice that is both colorful and flavorful.</p>
<p>Why You Should Include Turmeric in Your Daily Diet</p>
<p>In recent years, more than five thousand articles have been published
in the medical literature about curcumin, the pigment in turmeric that
gives it that bright yellow color. Many of these papers sport
impressive-looking diagrams suggesting that curcumin can benefit a
multitude of conditions with a dizzying array of mechanisms.4 Curcumin
was first isolated more than a century ago, yet out of the thousands of
experiments, only a few in the twentieth century were clinical studies
involving actual human participants. But since the turn of the century,
more than fifty clinical trials have tested curcumin against a variety
of diseases, and dozens more studies are on the way.5</p>
<p>We have seen how curcumin may play a role in preventing or treating
lung disease, brain disease, and a variety of cancers, including
multiple myeloma, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. But curcumin has
also been shown to help speed recovery after surgery6 and effectively
treat rheumatoid arthritis better than the leading drug of choice.7 It
also may be effective in treating osteoarthritis8 and other inflammatory
conditions, such as lupus9 and inflammatory bowel disease.10 In the
latest trial for ulcerative colitis, a multicenter, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind study found that more than 50 percent
of patients achieved remission within just one month on curcumin
compared to none of the patients who received the placebo.11 If you are
as convinced as I am that you should include turmeric in your diet to
benefit from its pigment curcumin, the next questions, then, are: how
much do you eat, how do you eat it, and what are the risks?</p>
<p>A Quarter Teaspoon of Turmeric Every Day</p>
<p>Turmeric is potent stuff. If I took a sample of your blood and
exposed it to an oxidizing chemical, researchers could quantify the
damage it caused to the DNA in your blood cells with sophisticated
technology that allows them to count the number of breaks in DNA
strands. If I then gave you a single pinch of turmeric to eat once a day
for a week, redrew your blood, and again exposed your blood cells to the
same free radicals, you would see that with the tiny bit of turmeric on
board, the number of cells with DNA damage could be cut in half.12
That’s not mixing turmeric with cells in a petri dish—that’s having you
ingest the spice and then measuring the effects in your blood. And this
was not some fancy curcumin supplement, not some turmeric extract. It
was just the plain spice you can buy at any grocery store. And, the dose
was tiny, about one-eighth of a teaspoon.</p>
<p>Now that’s powerful!</p>
<p>The doses of turmeric that have been used in human studies range from
less than one-sixteenth of a teaspoon up to nearly two tablespoons a
day.13 Few adverse effects have been reported even at high doses, but
the studies typically have lasted only a month or so. We don’t know what
long-term effects of high doses there may be. Because turmeric can have
such powerful drug-like effects, until we have better safety data, I
would not advise anyone to take more than the culinary doses that have a
long-standing record of apparent safety. How much is that? Though
traditional Indian diets can include up to about a teaspoon of turmeric
daily, the average intake in India is closer to a quarter teaspoon a
day.14 So that’s how much I recommend you get as part of your Daily
Dozen.</p>
<p>How to Eat Turmeric</p>
<p>Primitive peoples often used spices in sophisticated ways. For
instance, quinine from cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of
malaria long before the disease was even identified, and the raw
ingredients of aspirin have been used as a popular painkiller long
before Mr. Friedrich Bayer came along.15 Over the last twenty-five
years, about half of new drug discoveries have come from natural
products.16</p>
<p>There’s a plant in South Asia called adhatoda (adu, meaning “goat,”
and thoda, meaning “not touch”—it’s so bitter even the goats won’t eat
it). Its leaves are steeped with pepper to make a folk remedy effective
for treating asthma. Somehow it was figured out what scientists didn’t
discover until 1928: Adding pepper vastly boosted the plant’s
antiasthmatic properties. And now we know why. About 5 percent of black
pepper by weight is composed of a compound called piperine, which
accounts for pepper’s pungent flavor and aroma. But piperine is also a
potent inhibitor of drug metabolism.17 One of the ways your liver gets
rid of foreign substances is by making them water soluble so you can pee
them out. This black pepper molecule, however, inhibits that process,
thereby boosting blood levels of the medicinal compounds in adhatoda—and
it can do the same for curcumin in turmeric root.</p>
<p>Within an hour of eating turmeric, curcumin appears in your
bloodstream, but only in small traces. Why only scant amounts?
Presumably, your liver is actively working to get rid of it. But what if
you suppress that elimination process by eating some black pepper? If
you consume the same amount of curcumin but add a quarter teaspoon of
black pepper, the level of curcumin in your blood shoots up by 2,000
percent.18 Even just the littlest pinch of pepper, just one-twentieth of
a teaspoon, can significantly boost curcumin blood levels.19 And guess
what is a common ingredient in many curry powders besides turmeric?
Black pepper. Curry powder in India is also often served with a source
of fat, which alone can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin seven-
to eightfold.20 (Unfortunately, traditional knowledge appeared to fail
here as to the best source of that fat. Indian cuisine employs a great
deal of clarified butter, or ghee, which may explain the country’s
relatively high rates of heart disease despite its otherwise relatively
healthy diet.21)</p>
<p>My favorite way to incorporate turmeric is to use fresh turmeric
root. Any large Asian market should carry it in the produce aisle. It
looks like skinny fingers of gingerroot, but when you snap it open, you
are greeted by the most unreal, Day-Glo, fluorescent-orange color. My
quarter teaspoon of dried turmeric recommendation translates into about
a quarter inch of fresh turmeric root. The roots are about two inches
long, cost about ten cents each, and can last for weeks in the fridge or
basically forever in the freezer. Every year you can go to the store and
buy a twelve-month supply of fresh turmeric for about five dollars.</p>
<p>There’s evidence to suggest that the cooked and raw forms may have
different properties. Cooked turmeric appears to offer better DNA
protection, while raw turmeric may have greater anti-inflammatory
effects.22 I enjoy it both ways. I use a grater to add my daily quarter
inch into whatever I may be cooking (or right onto a cooked sweet
potato), or I throw a raw slice into a smoothie. You probably won’t even
taste it. Fresh turmeric has a much more subtle flavor than dried, so it
may be an especially good option for those who don’t like turmeric’s
taste. You will see it, though. Be careful—it can stain clothing and
surfaces. Turmeric may not just make your health golden but your
fingertips, as well.</p>
<p>Consuming turmeric with soy may offer a double benefit for
osteoarthritis sufferers.23 Scrambled tofu is the classic turmeric-soy
combination, but let me share two of my favorites: one raw and one
cooked. You can whip up a pumpkin pie smoothie in less than three
minutes. Simply blend a can of pumpkin purée, a handful of frozen
cranberries and pitted dates, pumpkin pie spice to taste, a quarter-inch
turmeric slice (or quarter-teaspoon of powder), and unsweetened soy milk
to reach your preferred consistency.</p>
<p>Another favorite is my pumpkin custard (aka crustless pie). All you
need to do is blend one can of pumpkin purée with about ten ounces of
silken tofu (the Mori-Nu brand is convenient because it stays fresh
without refrigeration), as much pumpkin pie spice as you like, and one
to two dozen pitted dates (depending on how much of a sweet tooth you
have). Pour into a dish and bake at 350°F until cracks appear on the
surface. By skipping the piecrust and sticking with a custard, you’re
left with vegetables, tofu, spices, and fruit. The more you eat, the
healthier you are.</p>
<p>Fresh or powdered, turmeric is a natural flavor fit for Indian and
Moroccan cuisines, but I add it to most anything. I find it pairs
particularly well with brown rice dishes, lentil soup, and roasted
cauliflower. Prepared yellow mustard typically already has turmeric in
it for color, but try to find a salt-free variety—one that’s essentially
just vinegar, a cruciferous vegetable (mustard seeds), and turmeric. I
can’t think of a healthier condiment.</p>
<p>What About Turmeric Supplements?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be more convenient to just take a curcumin supplement
every day? Added expense aside, I see three potential downsides. First,
curcumin is not equivalent to turmeric. Supplement manufacturers often
fall into the same reductionist trap as the drug companies do. Herbs are
assumed to have only one main active ingredient, so the thinking goes
that if you can isolate and purify it into a pill, you should be able to
boost the effects. Well, curcumin is described as the active ingredient
in turmeric,24 but is it the active ingredient or just an active
ingredient? In fact, it’s just one of many different components of the
whole-food spice.25</p>
<p>Few studies have compared turmeric with curcumin, but some that have
suggest that turmeric may work even better. For example, researchers at
the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas pitted both turmeric and curcumin
against seven different types of human cancer cells in vitro. Against
breast cancer, for instance, curcumin kicked butt, but turmeric kicked
even more butt. The same was true against pancreatic cancer, colon
cancer, multiple myeloma, myelogenous leukemia, and others—turmeric came
out on top, above just its yellow pigment curcumin. These findings
suggest that components other than curcumin can also contribute to
anticancer activities.26</p>
<p>Although curcumin is believed to account for most of turmeric’s
health-promoting activities, research published over the past decade has
indicated that curcumin-free turmeric—turmeric with the so-called active
ingredient removed—may be as effective as or even more effective than
turmeric with curcumin. There are turmerones, for example, in turmeric
(but processed out of curcumin supplements) that may exhibit both
anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. I naïvely assumed that the
researchers who discovered this would advocate that people consume
turmeric rather than take curcumin supplements, but instead, they
suggested the production of all sorts of different turmeric-derived
supplements.27 After all, who can make any money on a whole food that
costs pennies a day?</p>
<p>My second concern involves dosing. While the turmeric trials have
used modest amounts that could conceivably be achieved through diet,
curcumin-only trials have tested the amount of curcumin found in entire
cupfuls of turmeric spice—one hundred times more than what curry lovers
have been eating for centuries.28 Some supplements add black pepper as
well, potentially boosting levels to the equivalent of twenty-nine cups
a day of turmeric, which might result in enough curcumin in the blood to
potentially cause DNA damage based on in vitro data.29</p>
<p>Finally, there is a concern about contamination with toxic metals,
such as arsenic, cadmium, and lead. None of the tested samples of
powdered turmeric on the U.S. market has been found to be contaminated
with heavy metals, but the same cannot be said of curcumin
supplements.30</p>
<p>None of these concerns (except cost) applies to supplements
containing only whole ground turmeric powder. Nearly all turmeric
supplements are extracts, however. How else could they get away with
selling a small bottle of pills for twenty dollars when the bulk spice
may be less than twenty dollars a pound? A bottle might last two or
three months. For the same price, bulk turmeric could offer two or three
years’ worth at Daily Dozen dosing.</p>
<p>One compromise between convenience and cost may be to make your own
turmeric capsules. There are capsule-stuffing gadgets that allow you to
fill your own. Given the cost discrepancy between bulk turmeric and
supplements, such a gadget would probably pay for itself after your
first batch. A “00”-sized capsule would fit a day’s quarter-teaspoon
dose. Making your own capsules might be a little time consuming, but if
you won’t otherwise consume turmeric in your daily diet, it might be
time well spent. If there were ever such thing as a magic pill,
single-ingredient, ground turmeric root would probably come closest.</p>
<p>Who Should Not Take Turmeric</p>
<p>If you suffer from gallstones, turmeric may trigger pain. Turmeric is
a cholecystokinetic agent, meaning it facilitates the pumping action of
the gallbladder to keep bile from stagnating.31 Ultrasound studies show
that a quarter teaspoon of turmeric causes the gallbladder to contract,
squeezing out half of its contents.32 In this way, it may help prevent
gallstones from forming in the first place. But what if you already have
a stone obstructing your bile duct? That turmeric-induced squeeze could
be painful.33 For everyone else, though, the effect of turmeric would be
expected to reduce the risk of gallstone formation and ultimately even
reduce the risk of gallbladder cancer.34</p>
<p>Too much turmeric, however, may increase the risk of certain kidney
stones. Turmeric is high in soluble oxalates, which can bind to calcium
and develop into the most common form of kidney stone—insoluble calcium
oxalate, which is responsible for about 75 percent of all cases. Those
who have a tendency to form those stones should probably restrict
consumption of total dietary oxalate to no more than 50 mg per day. This
would mean no more than a teaspoon of turmeric daily at most.35
(Turmeric, by the way, is considered safe during pregnancy, but curcumin
supplements may not be.36)</p>
<hr />
<p>My recommended daily quarter teaspoon of turmeric is in addition to
whatever other (salt-free) herbs and spices you enjoy. The reason the
Daily Dozen encourages herb and spice consumption in general and not
just turmeric is not because they’re all interchangeable—turmeric
appears to have unique benefits—but because there’s evidence other herbs
and spices have health benefits as well. I’ve talked about the role of
saffron, for example, in the treatment of Alzheimer’s (chapter 3) and
depression (chapter 12). Spices don’t just make food taste better; they
make food better for you. I encourage you to keep a well-stocked spice
cabinet and make it a habit to add whatever herbs and spices you find
appealing to any dish you might be eating.</p>
<p>What follows here is a more in-depth examination of some of the herbs
and spices for which we have the most scientific data. I will describe
some of the fascinating studies that illustrate the benefits of these
flavor boosters and explain some of the easiest ways to add them to your
meals.</p>
<p>Fenugreek</p>
<p>Powdered fenugreek seed is a spice found commonly in Indian and
Middle Eastern cuisines. Fenugreek appears to significantly improve
muscle strength and weight-lifting power output, allowing men in
training, for example, to leg press an extra eighty pounds compared to
those ingesting a placebo.37 Fenugreek may also possess “potent
anticancer properties” in vitro.38 I don’t like the taste of the powder,
so I just throw in fenugreek seeds with my broccoli seeds when I’m
sprouting.</p>
<p>There is a side effect of fenugreek seed consumption, however: It can
make your armpits smell like maple syrup.39 I kid you not. It’s a
harmless phenomenon, but what isn’t harmless, however, is maple syrup
urine disease, a serious congenital disorder. Breast-feeding infants
with mothers who use fenugreek to boost their milk production may be
misdiagnosed with this completely unrelated disorder.40 If you’re
pregnant or breast-feeding and eating fenugreek, make sure to tell your
obstetrician just so she or he doesn’t think your baby has maple syrup
urine disease.</p>
<p>Cilantro</p>
<p>One sign of changing U.S. demographics is that salsa has replaced
ketchup as America’s top table condiment.41 One popular salsa ingredient
is cilantro, one of the most polarizing and divisive food ingredients
known to humankind. Some people absolutely love it, and some people
absolutely hate it. What’s interesting is that the lovers and the haters
appear to experience the taste differently. Individuals who like
cilantro may describe it as fresh, fragrant, or citrusy, whereas people
who dislike the herb report that it tastes like soap, mold, dirt, or
bugs.42 I’m not sure how people know what bugs taste like, but rarely
are polarizing opinions about flavors so extreme.</p>
<p>Different ethnic groups do seem to have different rates of cilantro
dislike, with Ashkenazi Jews scoring among the highest on the cilantro
hate-o-meter.43 Another clue came from twin studies that show that
identical twins tend to share cilantro preferences, whereas fraternal
twins do not have such a strong correlation.44 The human genetic code
contains about three billion letters, so we’d have to analyze the DNA of
roughly ten thousand people to find a cilantro gene. Obviously, genetic
researchers have better things to do than undertake that challenge …
right?</p>
<p>Maybe not. Genetic studies of more than twenty-five thousand
participants who reported their cilantro preferences discovered an area
on chromosome 11 that seemed to be a match. What’s there? A gene called
OR6A2 that enables you to smell certain chemicals like E-(2)-decenal,
which is both a primary constituent of cilantro and a defensive
secretion of stink bugs. So maybe cilantro does taste like bugs!
Cilantro lovers may just be genetic mutants who have an inability to
smell the unpleasant compound.45</p>
<p>This may actually be an advantage, though, because cilantro is
healthy stuff. Mother Nature has been described as the most
comprehensive pharmacy of all time, and cilantro is one of her oldest
herbal prescriptions.46 About twenty sprigs of cilantro daily for two
months reduced inflammation levels in arthritis sufferers and cut
uric-acid levels in half, suggesting that lots of cilantro may be useful
for people suffering from gout.47</p>
<p>Cayenne Pepper</p>
<p>In a study published as “Secretion, Pain and Sneezing Induced by the
Application of Capsaicin to the Nasal Mucosa in Man,” researchers found
that if you cut a hot pepper and rub it inside your nostrils, your nose
will start running and hurting, and you’ll start sneezing. (Capsaicin is
the burning component of hot peppers.) Why would they perform such an
experiment? People who have handled hot peppers know that if they get
some up their nose, they can experience an intense burning sensation.
(And it doesn’t even have to get up your nose, which I was chagrined to
learn after I once failed to wash my hands before using the restroom!)
However, the researchers noted that “these phenomena have not been
investigated.” So they decided it “appeared worthwhile to study the
effects produced by topical application of capsaicin in the human
[nose]…”48</p>
<p>The researchers enlisted a group of medical students and dripped some
capsaicin in their noses. The students started sneezing, burning, and
snotting, describing the pain at about eight or nine on a scale of one
to ten. No surprise. But it gets a little more interesting. What
happened when they repeated the experiment day after day? You’d think
the students might be more sensitive to capsaicin, with their nose still
irritated from the day before, causing even greater pain and discomfort,
right? Actually, the capsaicin hurt less. By day five, in fact, it
hardly hurt at all—they didn’t even get a runny nose anymore.</p>
<p>Were the poor med students permanently numbed? No. After a month or
so, the desensitization wore off, and they were back in agony whenever
the researchers tried dripping capsaicin back in their noses. What was
likely happening is that the pain fibers—the nerves that carry pain
sensation—used up so much of the pain neurotransmitter (called substance
P) that they ran out. Exposed day after day, the nerves exhausted their
stores and could no longer transmit pain messages until they made more
neurotransmitter from scratch, which takes a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>How could this be exploited for medical purposes? There’s a rare
headache syndrome called cluster headache, which has been described as
one of the worst pains humans can experience. Few, if any, medical
disorders are more painful. It’s nicknamed the “suicide headache”
because patients have taken their lives because of it.49</p>
<p>Cluster headaches are thought to be caused by pressure on the
trigeminal nerve in the face. Treatments involve everything from nerve
blocks to Botox to surgery. But that same nerve goes down to the nose.
What if you cause the whole nerve to dump all its substance P?
Researchers tried the daily capsaicin experiment with cluster headache
sufferers. Unlike the wimpy medical students who rated the nose burning
as an eight or nine on the ten-point pain scale, those used to the
violence of cluster headache attacks rated the pain caused by capsaicin
at only a three or four. By day five, they too became desensitized to
the pain of the capsaicin. What happened to their headaches? Those who
rubbed capsaicin in the nostril on the side of the head where the
headaches occurred cut the average number of attacks in half. In fact,
half the patients were apparently cured—their cluster headaches were
gone completely. All in all, 80 percent responded, which is at least
equal to, if not better than, all the current available therapies.50</p>
<p>What about other pain syndromes? Irritable bowel syndrome is thought
to be caused by a hypersensitivity of the lining of the colon. How do
you determine if someone’s gut is hypersensitive? Innovative Japanese
researchers developed a device to deliver “repetitive painful rectal
distention,” which is basically a half-quart balloon hooked up to a
fancy bicycle pump that is inserted and inflated until you can’t stand
the pain anymore. Those with IBS had a significantly lower pain
threshold, significantly less “rectal compliance.”51</p>
<p>So how about trying to desensitize the gut by depleting substance P
stores? It’s bad enough to have to rub hot peppers up your nose, but
where would you have to stick them for irritable bowel? Thankfully,
researchers chose the oral route. They found that the enteric-coated
capsules of red pepper powder were able to significantly decrease the
intensity of abdominal pain and bloating, suggesting “a way of dealing
with this frequent and distressing functional disease…”52</p>
<p>What about red pepper powder for the pain of chronic indigestion
(dyspepsia)? Within a month of taking about one and a half teaspoons’
worth of cayenne pepper a day, stomach pain and nausea improved.53 The
frequently prescribed drug Propulsid (cisapride) worked almost as well
as the red pepper powder and was considered generally well
tolerated—until, that is, it started killing people. Propulsid was
pulled from the market after causing fatal heart rhythms.54</p>
<p>Ginger</p>
<p>Many successful natural treatments start like this: Some doctor
learns that a plant has been used in some ancient medical tradition and
figures, “Why not try it in my practice?” Ginger has been used for
centuries for headaches, and so a group of Danish physicians advised one
of their migraine patients to give it a go. At the first sign of a
migraine coming on, the patient mixed a quarter teaspoon of powdered
ginger in some water and drank it. Within thirty minutes, the migraine
disappeared. And it worked every time for her, with no apparent side
effects.55</p>
<p>This is what’s called a case report. Though they’re really just
glorified anecdotes, case reports have played an important role in the
history of medicine, from the discovery of AIDS56 to a failed chest-pain
drug with a billion-dollar side effect—Viagra.57 Case reports are
considered the weakest form of evidence, but that’s often where
investigations begin.58 So the case report of successfully treating one
migraine patient with ginger isn’t so much helpful in itself, but it can
inspire researchers to put it to the test.</p>
<p>Eventually, a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was
performed comparing the efficacy of ginger for the treatment of migraine
headaches to sumatriptan (Imitrex), one of the top-selling,
billion-dollar drugs in the world. Just one-eighth of a teaspoon of
powdered ginger worked just as well and just as fast as the drug (and
costs less than a penny). Most migraine sufferers started with moderate
or severe pain, but after taking the drug or the ginger, ended up in
mild pain or were entirely pain-free. The same proportion of migraine
sufferers reported satisfaction with the results either way.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, ginger won. Not only is ginger a few billion
dollars cheaper, but it caused significantly fewer side effects. While
on the drug, people reported dizziness, a sedative effect, vertigo, and
heartburn, but the only side effect reported for ginger was an upset
stomach in about one out of twenty-five people.59 (A whole tablespoon of
ginger powder at one time on an empty stomach could irritate anyone,
though,60 so don’t overdo it.) Sticking to one-eighth of a teaspoon is
not only up to three thousand times cheaper than taking the drug, you’re
probably less likely to end up as a case report yourself, like the
people who have had a heart attack after taking sumatriptan for a
migraine,61 or have died.62</p>
<p>Migraines are described as “one of the most common” pain syndromes,
affecting as much as 12 percent of the population.63 That’s common? How
about menstrual cramps, which plague up to 90 percent of younger
women?64 Can ginger help? Even just one-eighth of a teaspoon of ginger
powder three times a day dropped pain from an eight to a six on a scale
of one to ten, and down further to a three in the second month.65 And
these women hadn’t been taking ginger all month; they started the day
before their periods began, suggesting that even if it doesn’t seem to
help much the first month, women should try sticking with it.</p>
<p>What about the duration of pain? A quarter teaspoon of ginger powder
three times a day was found to not only drop the severity of menstrual
pain from about seven down to five but decrease the duration from a
total of nineteen hours in pain down to about fifteen hours,66
significantly better than the placebo, which were capsules filled with
powdered toast. But women don’t take bread crumbs for their cramps. How
does ginger compare to ibuprofen? Researchers pitted one-eighth of a
teaspoon of powdered ginger head-to-head against 400 mg of ibuprofen,
and the ginger worked just as effectively as this leading drug.67 Unlike
the drug, ginger can also reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding, from
around a half cup per period down to a quarter cup.68 What’s more,
ginger intake of one-eighth of a teaspoon twice daily started a week
before your period can yield a significant drop in premenstrual mood,
physical, and behavioral symptoms.69</p>
<p>I like sprinkling powdered ginger on sweet potatoes or using it fresh
to make lemon-ginger apple chews as an antinausea remedy. (Ever since I
was a little kid, I’ve suffered from motion sickness.) There is an array
of powerful antinausea drugs, but they come with a nausea-inducing list
of side effects, so I’ve always striven to find natural remedies
whenever possible for myself and for my patients.</p>
<p>Ginger has been used for thousands of years in traditional healing
systems. In India, it’s known as maha-aushadhi, meaning “the great
medicine.” However, it wasn’t proven to reduce nausea until 1982, when
it beat out Dramamine in a head-to-head test in blindfolded volunteers
who were spun around in a tilted, rotating chair.70 Ginger is now
considered a nontoxic, broad-spectrum antiemetic (antivomiting agent)
effective in countering nausea during motion sickness, pregnancy,
chemotherapy, and radiation, and after surgery.71</p>
<p>Try making my lemon-ginger apple chews: In a blender, liquefy one
peeled lemon with a palm-sized “hand” of fresh gingerroot. Use the
mixture to coat thin slices of four apples, and then place them in a
dehydrator until they reach desired chewiness. I like them a little
moist, but you can dehydrate them further to make lemon-ginger apple
chips, which store longer than the chews. For me, a few pieces eaten
about twenty minutes before travel works wonders.</p>
<p>Note: Ginger is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but the
maximum recommended daily dose of fresh ginger while pregnant is 20
grams (about four teaspoons of freshly grated gingerroot).72 Any more
may have uterus-stimulating effects. Women using my apple chews recipe
to combat morning sickness should spread out the four apples’ worth of
chews or chips over several days.</p>
<p>Peppermint</p>
<p>Which herbs have the most antioxidants? The most antioxidant-packed
herb is dried Norwegian bearberry leaf. (Good luck finding that!) The
most antioxidant-packed common herb is peppermint.73 That’s why I add
mint to my favorite hibiscus cocktail recipe (see here) and why I try to
add it to food whenever possible. Mint is a traditional ingredient in
Middle Eastern salads like tabbouleh, Indian chutneys, and Vietnamese
soups and fresh summer rolls. I like to put it into anything chocolaty
as well.</p>
<p>Oregano and Marjoram</p>
<p>Oregano is such an antioxidant-rich herb that researchers decided to
test if it could reduce the DNA-damaging effects of radiation.
Radioactive iodine is sometimes given to people with overactive thyroid
glands or thyroid cancer to destroy part of the gland or mop up any
remaining tumor cells after surgery. For days after the isotope
injection, patients are so radioactive that they are advised not to kiss
anyone or to sleep close to anyone (including their pets), and to
maximize the distance between themselves and children or pregnant
women.74 The treatment can be very effective, but all that radiation
exposure appears to increase the risk of developing new cancers later
on.75 Hoping to prevent the DNA damage associated with this treatment,
researchers tested the ability of oregano to protect chromosomes of
human blood cells in vitro from exposure to radioactive iodine. At the
highest dose, chromosome damage was reduced 70 percent. The researchers
concluded that oregano may “act as a potent radioprotective
agent.”76</p>
<p>Other petri-dish studies with oregano suggest anticancer and
anti-inflammatory properties. In a comparison of the effects of various
spice extracts—bay leaves, fennel, lavender, oregano, paprika, parsley,
rosemary, and thyme—oregano beat out all but bay leaves in its ability
to suppress cervical cancer cell growth in vitro while leaving normal
cells alone.77 Of 115 different foods tested for anti-inflammatory
properties in vitro, oregano made it into the top five, along with
oyster mushrooms, onions, cinnamon, and tea leaves.78</p>
<p>Marjoram is a closely related herb and also shows promise in
laboratory studies. It appears to significantly inhibit the migration
and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro.79 None of these studies on
oregano family herbs was done on people, though, so we have no idea how,
if at all, these effects will translate to a clinical setting. One of
the only randomized, controlled trials I’m aware of is a study of
marjoram tea for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The tea was
purportedly used in traditional herbal medicine to “restore hormonal
balance,” so researchers decided to put it to the test. They instructed
women with PCOS to drink two cups of marjoram tea on an empty stomach
every day for a month. Beneficial effects on hormone levels were
observed, which, the researchers concluded, “may justify the improvement
claimed by traditional medicine practitioners and patients.”80</p>
<p>Cloves</p>
<p>The most antioxidant-packed common spice is the clove.81 It has an
exceptionally strong flavor, so try adding just a teensy pinch to
anything you’d normally put cinnamon or ginger on. Ground cloves are
great on stewed pears and baked apples, giving them a pleasant, mulled
cider taste, and a mug of chai tea is a fantastic way to pack in a bunch
of high-impact common spices at once.</p>
<p>Amla</p>
<p>The most antioxidant-packed uncommon spice is amla,82 which is
powdered dried Indian gooseberry fruit. As a Western-trained physician,
I had never heard of amla despite its common use in Ayurvedic herbal
preparations. I was surprised to find four hundred articles on this
lesser-known spice in the medical literature, and even more surprised to
find papers with titles like “Amla … a Wonder Berry in the Treatment and
Prevention of Cancer.” Amla is arguably the most important plant in
Ayurvedic medicine, used traditionally as everything from a neutralizer
of snake venom to a hair tonic.83 I eat it because it’s apparently the
single most antioxidant-packed green-light food on Earth.84</p>
<p>Using an argon laser, researchers can measure and track human
carotenoid antioxidant levels in real time. The most important finding
from this body of work is that antioxidant levels can plummet within two
hours of an oxidatively stressful event. When you’re stuck in traffic
breathing diesel fumes, deprived of sleep, or suffering from a cold, for
example, your body starts using up some of its antioxidant stores. What
may only take two hours to lose can take up to three days to build back
up.85</p>
<p>Even ordinary body processes, such as turning food into energy, can
produce free radicals. This is okay as long as the food you eat comes
prepackaged with antioxidants. But if it doesn’t—if you chug straight
sugar water, for example—the level of free radicals and oxidized fat in
your bloodstream rises over the next few hours, while vitamin E levels
drop as your body’s antioxidant stores are expended.86 If you were to
eat the same amount of sugar in the form of an orange, though, you
wouldn’t get a spike in oxidation.87 Researchers concluded: “This argues
strongly for the need to include high antioxidant foods in each and
every meal in order to prevent this redox [free-radical versus
antioxidant] imbalance.”88</p>
<p>The standard American diet (SAD) isn’t exactly antioxidant packed.
Here is the antioxidant content (in modified FRAP assay daμmol
antioxidant units) of some typical American breakfast foods: bacon (7)
and eggs (8), a bowl of corn flakes (25) with milk (10), an Egg McMuffin
(11), pancakes (21) with maple syrup (9), and a bagel (20) with cream
cheese (4). A typical breakfast may average about 25 antioxidant
units.89</p>
<p>Compare those to the smoothie I had for breakfast this morning. I
started with a cup of water (0), a half cup of frozen blueberries (323),
and the pulp of a ripe mango (108). I added a tablespoon of ground
flaxseeds (8), along with a half cup of fresh mint leaves (33) and a
palmful of bulk white tea leaves (103). (For more about tea leaves, see
here.) While the typical SAD breakfast may give you only about 25
antioxidant units, my breakfast smoothie offered more than 500. And,
when I add the final ingredient, a single teaspoon of amla, I get an
additional 753 antioxidant units. That’s about four cents’ worth of
amla, and it just doubled the antioxidant content of my entire smoothie.
Before I’ve even fully woken up, I’ve already consumed more than 1,000
antioxidant units. That’s more than the average person may get in an
entire week. I could drink my smoothie and eat nothing but doughnuts for
the rest of the week, and most people still wouldn’t catch up. Notice
that even though I packed the blender with amazing foods like
blueberries and tea leaves, fully half the antioxidant power came from
that single, four-cent teaspoon of powdered gooseberries.</p>
<p>You can buy amla online or at any Indian spice store. Ayurvedic
herbal supplements are typically something you’d want to stay away from,
as they have been found to be heavily contaminated with heavy metals,90
some of which are actually added intentionally.91 But none of the
samples of powdered amla tested so far has been found to be
contaminated. You can find whole Indian gooseberries in the frozen
section of Indian grocery stores, but frankly, I find them
inedible—astringent, sour, bitter, and fibrous all at the same time. The
powder isn’t much tastier, but it can be disguised in something with a
strong flavor, like a smoothie. Alternatively, you could pack amla into
capsules like the turmeric. Whenever I’m out on the road on a speaking
tour, I try to take daily capsules of turmeric and amla until I can get
back home and wrest back control over my diet.</p>
<p>Spice Mixes</p>
<p>While there have been a considerable number of studies done with
individual spices, few have looked at increasing spice consumption in
general. One group at Pennsylvania State University did compare the
effects of a high-fat chicken meal with and without a mixture of nine
herbs and spices. Herbs and spices were chosen because, ounce for ounce,
they have more antioxidants than any other food group (and because the
study was funded by the McCormick spice company).92</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the people in the spice group experienced a doubling
of the antioxidant power in their bloodstreams compared to participants
in the spice-free group. Remarkably, though, the spice group ended up
with 30 percent less fat (triglycerides) in their blood after the meal
and improved insulin sensitivity. The researchers concluded that “the
incorporation of spices into the daily diet may help normalize
postprandial [after-meal] disturbances in glucose [sugar] and lipid
[fat] homeostasis [control] while enhancing antioxidant defense.”</p>
<p>But why experience such disturbances in the first place? The study
reminds me of those that show eating greens is particularly protective
against cancer among smokers.93 That is, the take-home message shouldn’t
be telling smokers to eat greens—it should be telling smokers to quit
smoking. Of course, they could do both, which in the context of the
spice study would mean adopting an antioxidant-rich, green-light diet,
offering the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Some of my favorite spice mixes are pumpkin pie spice, curry powder,
chili powder, Chinese five-spice powder, a savory Indian spice blend
called garam masala, an Ethiopian blend called berbere, Italian
seasoning, poultry seasoning, and a Middle Eastern blend called za’atar.
Spice mixes are a convenient way to provide a balance of flavors while
boosting the variety of your spice intake, but make sure to check that
the mixes are salt-free.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is Liquid Smoke Safe?</p>
<p>I don’t know how I lived so long without smoked paprika. I swear it
tastes like barbecue potato chips. After I first discovered it, I became
a smoked-paprika zealot and put it on almost everything, but now I
reserve it mostly for greens and when toasting fresh squash and pumpkin
seeds. (I’ll bet you aren’t surprised to learn that’s my favorite part
of Halloween!) I was concerned there might be carcinogenic combustion
products in smoked seasonings (similar to the benzo[a]pyrene found in
cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust), but these compounds tend to be fat
soluble. So when you smoke a spice or make a water-based solution like
liquid smoke, the smoke flavor compounds are captured without capturing
most of the smoke cancer compounds. The same can’t be said for smoked
fatty foods. While you’d have to chug three bottles of hickory smoke
flavoring to exceed the safety limit, a smoked ham or smoked turkey
sandwich could take you halfway there, and a single barbecued chicken
leg would take you over the top. Smoked fish, such as herring or salmon,
appears to be the worst. One bagel with lox could take you ten times
over the safety limit.94</p>
<hr />
<p>Some Risks to Spicing Up Your Life</p>
<p>There are a few spices, however, of which you can have too much of a
good thing. Take poppy seeds, for example.</p>
<p>The opium poppy used to make heroin is the same opium poppy that
produces the poppy seeds in muffins and bagels. The idea that poppy
seeds could serve as the source of appreciable amounts of narcotics was
not given much credence despite the existence of an old European custom
recommending a poppy seed–filled pacifier to quiet a noisy baby.95 It
wasn’t given much credence, that is, until a mother tried giving her
six-month-old some strained milk in which she had boiled some poppy
seeds with the very best intentions of helping the child sleep better.
The baby stopped breathing—but luckily survived.96</p>
<p>The cases of poppy seed overdose aren’t limited to children. There’s
another case in the literature of an adult who felt “dim feelings in the
head” after eating spaghetti with a half cup of poppy seeds on top.97 So
what’s the upper limit of poppy seed consumption that’s probably safe?
Based on median morphine levels,98 about one teaspoon for every ten
pounds of body weight. This means that someone weighing about 150 pounds
should probably eat no more than five tablespoons of raw poppy seeds at
a time.99</p>
<p>Cooking may wipe out half of the morphine and codeine contained
naturally in poppy seeds, which gives you some more leeway when
baking.100 Soaking the poppy seeds for five minutes and then discarding
the water before adding the seeds to your recipe can eliminate half of
that remaining, if you’re making some poppy seed–filled pastry or other
baked goods for children. Otherwise, there shouldn’t be any risk at
usual levels of intake—unless you’re going in for a drug test, in which
case you may want to avoid poppy seeds altogether.101</p>
<p>Too much nutmeg can also be a problem. A paper entitled “Christmas
Gingerbread … and Christmas Cheer: Review of the Potential Role of Mood
Elevating Amphetamine-like Compounds…” suggested that certain natural
constituents of spices like nutmeg may form amphetamine compounds within
the body sufficient “to elevate the mood and to help provide some added
Christmas cheer” during the holiday season.102</p>
<p>This hypothetical risk was raised as far back as the 1960s in the New
England Journal of Medicine in an article called “Nutmeg
Intoxication.”103 The paper pondered whether the age-old custom of
adding nutmeg to eggnog arose from the “psychopharmacological effect”
described in cases of nutmeg intoxication. Such cases evidently go back
to the 1500s, when nutmeg was used as an abortifacient to induce a
miscarriage.104 In the 1960s, the spice was used as a psychotropic
drug.105 During that decade, mental health professionals concluded that
while nutmeg “is much cheaper for use and probably less dangerous than
the habit-forming heroin, it must be stated that it is not free from
danger and may cause death.”106</p>
<p>The toxic dose of nutmeg is two to three teaspoons. I had assumed no
one would ever come close to that amount unintentionally until I saw a
report in which a married couple ate some pasta, collapsed, and were
subsequently hospitalized. What had happened was a big mystery until the
husband revealed that he had accidentally added one-third of a jar of
nutmeg to the meal while cooking.107 That’s about four teaspoons of the
spice. I don’t know how they could have eaten it! I imagine the poor
wife was just trying to be polite.</p>
<p>Another popular and powerful spice is cinnamon, which has been prized
for its ability to lower blood sugar levels.108 It works so well that
you can even “cheat” on a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of
cinnamon the night before. Twelve hours later, your blood sugar spike in
response to meals will still be significantly dampened.109 Even just a
teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference.110
Unfortunately, cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective
treatment for diabetes.</p>
<p>There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon and cassia
cinnamon (also known as Chinese cinnamon). In the United States,
anything simply labeled “cinnamon” is probably cassia, since it’s
cheaper. This is unfortunate, because cassia contains a compound called
coumarin, which may be toxic to the liver at high doses. Unless it’s
specifically labeled Ceylon cinnamon, a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon
even a few times a week may be too much for small children, and a daily
teaspoon would exceed the tolerable upper safety limit for adults.111
Can’t you just switch to Ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without
the risks? Without the risks, yes, but we’re no longer so sure about the
benefits.</p>
<p>Nearly all the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have
been performed with cassia. We’ve just assumed that the same would apply
for the safer Ceylon cinnamon, but it was only recently put to the test.
The nice blunting of blood sugars you see in response to cassia cinnamon
disappeared when the researchers tried using Ceylon cinnamon instead.112
In fact, all along it may actually have been the toxic coumarin itself
that was the active blood-sugar-lowering ingredient in the cassia
cinnamon. Thus, sidestepping the toxin by switching to Ceylon cinnamon
may sidestep the benefit. So, in a nutshell, when it comes to lowering
blood sugars, cinnamon may not be safe (cassia), or it may be safe, but
apparently not effective in reducing blood sugar (Ceylon).</p>
<p>I still encourage Ceylon cinnamon consumption, given that it is one
of the cheapest common food sources of antioxidants, second only to
purple cabbage. But what’s a type 2 diabetic to do? Even the cassia
cinnamon only brought down blood sugars modestly—in other words, it was
only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the world, metformin, sold
as Glucophage.113 Yes, cassia cinnamon may work as effectively as the
leading drug, but that’s not saying much. The best way to treat diabetes
is to attempt to cure it entirely with a healthy diet. (See chapter
6.)</p>
<hr />
<p>Who knew that the herbs and spices you’ve been tossing into sauces
and sprinkling onto dishes could have such impacts on your health? Work
your creativity in the kitchen and spice up your meals and drinks to
make them more flavorful and more healthful—but don’t forget the quarter
teaspoon of daily turmeric. I am sufficiently convinced by the available
body of evidence to single turmeric out as something everyone should add
to his or her daily diet.</p>
<p>Whole Grains</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Greger’s Favorite Whole Grains</p>
<p>Barley, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, oats, popcorn, quinoa, rye,
teff, whole-wheat pasta, and wild rice</p>
<p>Serving Sizes:</p>
<p>½ cup hot cereal or cooked grains, pasta, or corn kernels</p>
<p>1 cup cold cereal</p>
<p>1 tortilla or slice of bread</p>
<p>½ a bagel or english muffin</p>
<p>3 cups popped popcorn</p>
<p>Daily Recommendation:</p>
<p>3 servings per day</p>
<hr />
<p>Consistent with recommendations from leading cancer1 and heart
disease2 authorities, I recommend at least three servings of whole
grains a day. Harvard University’s preeminent twin nutrition studies—the
Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study—have
so far accumulated nearly three million person-years of data. A 2015
analysis found that people who eat more whole grains tend to live
significantly longer lives independent of other dietary and lifestyle
factors.3 No surprise, given that whole grains appear to reduce the risk
of heart disease,4 type 2 diabetes,5 obesity, and stroke.6 Eating more
whole grains could save the lives of more than a million people around
the world every year.7</p>
<p>There are so many nutrition claims floating around the Internet that
lack scientific backing, but a few especially persistent memes directly
contradict the available evidence. When I see books, websites, articles,
and blogs parroting claims like “grains are inflammatory—even whole
grains,” I can’t help but wonder what alternate dimension the authors
call home.</p>
<p>Pick your indicator of inflammation. Take C-reactive protein (CRP),
for instance. CRP levels rise within the body in response to
inflammatory insults and are therefore used as a screening test for
systemic inflammation. Each daily serving of whole grains is estimated
to reduce CRP concentrations by approximately 7 percent.8 Furthermore,
there’s a whole alphabet soup of inflammation markers that appear to be
improved by whole grains: ALT, GGT,9 IL-6,10 IL-8,11 IL-10,12 IL-18,13
PAI-1,14 TNF-α,15 TNF-R2,16 whole blood viscosity, and erythrocyte
filtration.17 Or, as presented in less technical terms in the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition, “Whole-grain intake cools down
inflammation.”18 Even excluding heart disease and cancer, habitual
whole-grain intake is linked to a significantly lower risk of dying from
inflammatory diseases.19</p>
<p>What About Gluten?</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard about an autoimmune disorder called celiac
disease, in which the consumption of gluten causes adverse reactions,
including gastrointestinal problems. Gluten is a group of proteins found
in certain grains, including wheat, barley, and rye. Celiac disease is
relatively rare, though, affecting less than 1 percent of the
population.20 For the more than 99 percent of the rest of us who don’t
have the disorder, is gluten okay or, indeed, health-promoting like
other plant proteins?</p>
<p>In 1980, researchers in England reported a series of women suffering
from chronic diarrhea who were cured by a gluten-free diet, yet none of
the women had evidence of celiac disease.21 They appeared to have some
sort of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. At the time, the medical
profession expressed skepticism that there was such a thing,22 and even
now there are experts who question its existence.23 In fact, doctors
commonly referred their patients claiming non-celiac gluten sensitivity
to psychiatrists because they were believed to have an underlying mental
illness.24</p>
<p>The medical profession has a history of dismissing diseases as
existing “just in your head.” Examples of these include post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), ulcerative colitis, migraines, ulcers, asthma,
Parkinson’s, Lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis. Despite resistance
from the prevailing medical community, each one of these conditions has
subsequently been confirmed as a legitimate disorder.25 On the flip
side, the Internet is rife with unsubstantiated claims about gluten-free
diets that have spilled over into the popular press, making gluten the
diet villain du jour.26 And, of course, the gluten-free processed food
industry, today worth billions, has a financial interest in the public’s
confusion.27 Whenever that much money is at stake, it’s hard to trust
anyone, so as always, stick to the science. And what sort of evidence is
there for the existence of a condition presumed to be so widespread?</p>
<p>The first double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled gluten
challenge was published in 2011. Patients complaining of irritable
bowel–type symptoms who claimed they felt better on a gluten-free
diet—despite not having celiac disease—were tested to see if they could
tell if bread and muffins they were given contained gluten or were
gluten-free. All the subjects started out gluten-free and symptom-free
for two weeks, and then were challenged with one of the two types of
bread and muffins. Even those who ate the gluten-free placebo products
felt worse, meaning they started out on a gluten-free diet and continued
on a gluten-free diet, yet they reported feeling crampy and bloated.
This is what’s called the nocebo effect. The placebo effect takes place
when you give patients something useless and they feel better; the
nocebo effect occurs when you give someone something harmless and they
feel worse. Nevertheless, the subjects who received actual gluten felt
even worse. So the researchers concluded that non-celiac gluten
intolerance may indeed exist.28</p>
<p>However, this was a small study, and even though the researchers
claimed the gluten-free products were indistinguishable from those
containing gluten, it’s possible that the patients were able to tell
which foods were which. So, in 2012, Italian researchers created a
double-blinded test with 920 patients diagnosed with non-celiac gluten
sensitivity. Each was given capsules filled with either wheat flour or a
placebo powder. More than two-thirds failed the test: Those on the
placebo got worse, or those on the wheat felt better. But for those who
passed, there was a clear benefit to staying on the wheat-free diet,
confirming the “existence of non-celiac WS [wheat sensitivity].”29 Note
that they said wheat sensitivity, though, not gluten sensitivity. In
other words, gluten itself may not be causing gut symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Most people who are sensitive to wheat are sensitive to a variety of
other foods too. For example, two-thirds of people with wheat
sensitivity have also been found to be sensitive to cow’s milk protein.
Eggs appear to be the next leading culprit.30 If you put people on a
diet low in common triggers of irritable bowel symptoms and then
challenge them with gluten, there’s no effect, calling into question the
existence of non-celiac gluten sensitivity.31</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite being informed that avoiding gluten was
apparently not helping their gut symptoms, many participants opted to
continue following a gluten-free diet as they subjectively described
“feeling better.” This led the researchers to wonder if avoiding gluten
might improve the mood of those with wheat sensitivity and, indeed,
short-term exposure to gluten appeared to induce feelings of depression
in these patients.32 Regardless of whether non-celiac gluten sensitivity
is a disease of the mind or the gut, it is no longer considered a
condition that can be dismissed.33</p>
<p>The next question, then, is what percentage of the population should
avoid wheat and other gluten-containing grains? About one in one
thousand may have an allergy to wheat,34 and nearly one in one hundred
have celiac disease,35 which appears to be on the rise. Still, there’s
less than a one-in-ten-thousand chance that an American will be
diagnosed with celiac disease in a given year.36 Our best estimate for
the prevalence of wheat sensitivity is in the same general range of
celiac disease: slightly higher than 1 percent.37 So only about 2
percent of the population appears to have a problem with wheat, but
that’s potentially millions of people who may have been suffering for
years and could have been cured by simple dietary means, yet were
unrecognized and not helped by the medical profession until
recently.38</p>
<p>For the 98 percent of people who don’t have wheat issues, there is no
evidence to suggest that following a gluten-free diet has any
benefits.39 In fact, there is some evidence suggesting that a
gluten-free diet may adversely affect gut health in people without
celiac disease, wheat sensitivity, or wheat allergy. A month on a
gluten-free diet was found to adversely affect gut flora and immune
function, potentially setting up those on gluten-free diets for an
overgrowth of harmful bacteria in their intestines.40 This is due,
ironically, to the beneficial effects of the very components
wheat-sensitive individuals have problems with—such as the “FODMAP”
fructans that act as prebiotics and feed your good bacteria, or the
gluten itself, which may boost immune function.41 Less than a week of
added gluten protein may significantly increase natural killer cell
activity,42 which could be expected to improve the body’s ability to
fight cancer and viral infections.</p>
<p>The greatest threat gluten-free diets may pose, though, is that they
may undermine our ability to diagnose celiac disease, the much more
serious form of wheat intolerance. Doctors diagnose celiac by looking
for the inflammation caused by gluten in celiac sufferers. But if
patients complaining of digestive problems come to the doctor having
already eliminated much of the gluten in their diets, physicians might
miss the disease.43 Why would getting a formal diagnosis matter if
you’re already on a gluten-free diet? First of all, it’s a genetic
disease, so you’ll know to test your family. More significantly, though,
many people on so-called gluten-free diets are not actually on truly
gluten-free diets. Even twenty parts per million can be toxic to someone
with celiac. Sometimes, even foods labeled “gluten-free” may not be safe
for celiac sufferers.44</p>
<p>What’s the best course of action to take if you suspect you might be
sensitive to gluten? First off, do not go on a gluten-free diet. If you
suffer from chronic irritable bowel–type symptoms, such as bloating,
abdominal pain, and irregular bowel habits, ask your doctor about
getting a formal evaluation for celiac disease. If you have celiac, then
go on a strict gluten-free diet. If you don’t have the disease, the
current recommendation is that you first try a healthier diet that
includes more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, all the while
avoiding processed foods.45 The reason people may feel better on a
gluten-free diet—and therefore conclude they have a problem with
gluten—is because they’ve suddenly stopped eating so much fast food and
other processed junk. In other words, if you eat a deep-fried Twinkie
and your stomach aches, it may not be the gluten.</p>
<p>If a healthy diet doesn’t help, I suggest you try to rule out other
causes of chronic gastrointestinal distress. When researchers have
studied PWAWGs—that’s what they’re called in the medical literature:
People Who Avoid Wheat and/or Gluten—they’ve found that about one-third
of them didn’t appear to have gluten sensitivity but instead had other
conditions like an overgrowth of bacteria in their small intestines,
were fructose or lactose intolerant, or had a neuromuscular disorder
like gastroparesis or pelvic floor dysfunction.46 After each of these is
ruled out as well, then I’d suggest people suffering from chronic,
suspicious symptoms try a gluten-free diet.</p>
<p>No current data suggest that the general population should try to
avoid gluten, but for those with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a
wheat sensitivity diagnosis, gluten-free diets can be a lifesaver.47</p>
<p>Eat Whole … Within Minutes</p>
<p>Eating whole grains should be more than just swapping out white bread
for whole wheat and white rice for brown. There is a wonderful universe
of whole grains out there. You may have tried quinoa, but what about
kañiwa or fonio? Even wild rice (which is not actually even rice) may
not sound as wild as the grain called freekeh. Have fun and try some
amaranth, millet, sorghum, or teff to expand the amber waves of your
horizon. Buckwheat is my mom’s favorite.</p>
<p>As with vegetables, use color to make decisions at the grocery store.
If you have a choice, pick red quinoa over white quinoa, blue corn over
yellow, and yellow corn over white. Beyond just comparing antioxidant
content, there’s experimental evidence to suggest that pigmented
rice—red, purple, or black—has benefits over brown. For example, in
addition to having about five times more antioxidants,48 colored rice
varieties have shown greater antiallergy activity in vitro,49 as well as
superior anticancer effects against breast cancer50 and leukemia
cells.51</p>
<p>For convenience’s sake, there are a number of quick-cooking grains:
amaranth, millet, regular oats, quinoa, and teff can all be prepared in
less than twenty minutes. For grains that take longer, such as barley,
farro, or steel-cut oats, consider cooking a big pot in advance on the
weekend so you can simply reheat for your meals throughout the week. Or
get a rice cooker—you can buy one for less than twenty dollars.</p>
<p>Whole-wheat pasta cooks in about ten minutes. Improved production
technologies have created a new generation of whole-grain pastas that no
longer have the rough and mealy texture of yesteryear. My favorite brand
is Bionaturae because of its deliciously nutty taste—try it with my
Eight Check-Mark Pesto.</p>
<p>Dr. Greger’s Eight Check-Mark Pesto</p>

<p>¼ cup freshly toasted walnuts</p>
<p>2 cloves fresh garlic</p>
<p>¼ of a peeled lemon</p>
<p>¼ teaspoon lemon zest</p>
<p>¼ inch of fresh turmeric root (or ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder)</p>
<p>¼ cup pinto beans</p>
<p>¼ cup water or liquid from bean can</p>

<p>Pepper to taste</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a food processor. Blend until smooth.</p>
<p>Scoop onto a cup and a half of cooked whole-grain pasta.</p>
<p>Popcorn is a whole grain that takes less than five minutes to
prepare. A hot-air popper is another inexpensive, useful appliance.
There’s an endless variety of savory, sweet, and spicy toppings you can
use. I like the combination of chlorella and nutritional yeast. (In my
family, the green color earned it the name “zombie corn.”) By lightly
misting air-popped popcorn with a spray bottle, you can get dry
seasonings to stick. I like to spritz with balsamic vinegar. Be sure to
stay away from artificial butter flavorings. Originally, we thought the
artificial butter flavor chemical diacetyl was just an occupational
health hazard, resulting in the deaths of workers who handled the
chemical from a condition that became known as “popcorn lung.”52 Now we
know consumers are also at risk, given a case series of serious lung
disease thought to be caused by butter-flavored microwave popcorn
consumption.53</p>
<p>There are even one-minute whole-grain options: fully precooked bowls
and pouches of brown rice and quinoa that can be microwaved and don’t
even need to be refrigerated—just heat and eat.</p>
<p>The Five-to-One Rule</p>
<p>If you buy packaged grain products, anything labeled on the front
with words like “multigrain,” “stone-ground,” “100% wheat,” “cracked
wheat,” “seven-grain,” or “bran” is usually not a whole-grain product.
They’re trying to distract you from the fact that they’re using refined
grains. Here, color may not help. Ingredients like “raisin juice
concentrate” are used to darken white bread to make it look healthier.
Even if the first word in the ingredients list is “whole,” the rest of
the ingredients could be junk.</p>
<p>I suggest using the Five-to-One Rule. When buying healthier,
whole-grain products, look at the Nutrition Facts label on the package
and see if the ratio of grams of carbohydrates to grams of dietary fiber
is five or less (see figure 7). For example, let’s see if 100 percent
whole-wheat Wonder Bread passes the test: Per serving, the package lists
30 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber. Thirty divided by 3 is
10. Well, 10 is more than 5, so the 100 percent whole-wheat Wonder Bread
goes back on the shelf even though, technically, it’s a whole-grain
product. Compare that to Ezekiel bread, a sprouted-grain bread based on
a biblical verse. It has 15 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber,
and, just like that, passes the test. So do Ezekiel english muffins,
which taste great with fruit-only jam and nut butter. Though the science
on the potential benefits of sprouted grains is still in its infancy,
available data look promising.54</p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>Apply the same Five-to-One Rule to breakfast cereals, another grocery
category that can lull you into believing nearly everything is healthy.
Multi-Grain Cheerios, for example, sounds good, but it has a ratio over
7. And then it just goes downhill from there with Frosted Cheerios and
Fruity Cheerios, which have carbohydrate-to-fiber ratios that exceed 10.
Compare that with Uncle Sam cereal, sliding in with a ratio under 4.
Others that make the cut include some no-added-sugar puffed-grain
cereals like puffed barley, but the healthiest whole grains are the
least processed, the so-called intact grains.</p>
<p>Even though wheat berries, shredded wheat, whole-wheat flour, and
puffed-wheat cereal may all be 100 percent whole wheat, they are handled
by the body very differently. When grains are ground into flour or
puffed, they are digested more rapidly and more completely. This
increases their glycemic index and leaves fewer leftovers for the
friendly flora down in your colon.</p>
<p>Researchers have experimented with this by splitting people into two
groups. One group ate nuts, seeds, and beans more or less intact. The
other group ate the same exact foods, but ground into flours and pastes.
The first group ate nuts instead of nut butters, whole chickpeas instead
of hummus, and muesli instead of muesli ground into a cream-of-wheat
texture. Note that both groups were eating whole foods, just in
different forms.</p>
<p>What happened? The intact-whole-grain diet group doubled their stool
size, which was significantly greater than that of the
ground-whole-grain group, even though they were eating the same foods in
the same quantities.55 How is that possible? There is so much more left
over for your gut flora to eat when you eat your grains intact. Few
people realize that the bulk of stool is not undigested food but pure
bacteria—trillions and trillions of bacteria.56 That may be why you get
an increase of nearly two ounces of stool for every one ounce of fiber
you eat. That’s not just water weight—you’re feeding your good bacteria
so they can be fruitful and multiply.57</p>
<p>As the study demonstrated, when you eat grains intact, even if you
chew your food thoroughly, pieces of whole seeds and grains transport
starch and other goodies all the way down to your colon for your flora
to feast on.58 But when grains are unnaturally processed into flour,
almost all of the starch is digested in the small intestine, and you end
up starving your microbial self. When that happens regularly, it can
result in dysbiosis, an imbalance in which bad bacteria can take over
and increase your susceptibility to inflammatory diseases or colon
cancer.59 The moral of the story: Whole grains are great, but intact
whole grains may be even better.</p>
<p>Instead of a puffed brown-rice cereal, how about just brown rice?
Brown rice for breakfast may sound weird, but warm bowls of grains are
traditional breakfast foods in many parts of the world. There are savory
versions, or you can sweeten it up with fresh, frozen, dried, or
freeze-dried berries. There are online sites where you can buy
freeze-dried strawberries in bulk for less than a dollar per cup.</p>
<p>Oats</p>
<p>Oatmeal, of course, is the classic whole-grain breakfast. Just as
cruciferous vegetables and flaxseeds harbor beneficial compounds found
in abundance nowhere else, oats contain a unique class of
anti-inflammatory compounds called avenanthramides. They’re thought to
be responsible in part for the fresh odor and flavor of oats60 as well
as the ability of oatmeal lotion to relieve skin itching and
irritation.61 Studies on human skin fragments from plastic surgery that
were subjected to inflammatory chemicals reveal that oatmeal extract can
suppress inflammation62—so much that oatmeal now appears to be the
treatment of choice for certain serious chemotherapy-induced skin
rashes.63 Ironically, two of the cancer cell lines found to be resistant
to that type of chemotherapy64 were found to be sensitive to
avenanthramides in vitro, suggesting that people should be applying
oatmeal to their insides as well.65 Oatmeal is more than just a whole
grain.66</p>
<p>Oatmeal is my go-to breakfast when I travel. If there isn’t a nearby
Starbucks where I can pick up some oatmeal, I prepare instant oatmeal
with dried fruit in the coffeemaker in my hotel room. At home, if you
want to spice up your oatmeal routine, Google “savory oatmeal” for all
sorts of interesting dishes involving sautéed mushrooms, herbs, spinach,
curry, roasted vegetables—you name it!</p>
<hr />
<p>The Daily Dozen calls on you to eat three servings of whole grains a
day. This might seem like a lot, but when you look at the actual size of
those recommended servings, it’ll be a snap for you to succeed. Just one
pasta dish at an Italian restaurant may average the equivalent of six
servings!67 A morning oatmeal habit is a great way to kick-start your
day, and then there are a variety of quick-cooking whole grains that
serve as convenient, filling ways to fight chronic disease risk all day

<hr />
<p>There are plenty of dietary guidelines for eating, but what about for
drinking? The Beverage Guidance Panel was assembled to provide
“recommendations on the relative health and nutritional benefits and
risks of various beverage categories.” The panel included such
heavyweights as Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the nutrition department at
Harvard University School of Public Health and professor of medicine at
Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>The panel’s nutrition experts ranked beverage categories on a
six-tier scale from best to worst. Unsurprisingly, soda ranked last.
Whole milk, meanwhile, was grouped with beer, with a recommendation for
zero ounces a day. Their justification included concerns about links
between milk and prostate cancer, as well as aggressive ovarian cancer,
perhaps “related to its well-documented effect on circulating
concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1.” (See chapter 13.) Tea
and coffee—preferably without creamer or sweetener—tied as the
number-two healthiest beverages, second only to water, the top-ranked
drink.1</p>
<p>Water</p>
<p>More than two thousand years ago, Hippocrates said, “If we could give
every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too
little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health.”2
Water is the healthiest beverage to drink—but how much is too little,
and how much is too much? Water has been described as a “neglected,
unappreciated and under researched” subject,3 but many of the studies
extolling the need for proper hydration have been funded by the bottled
water industry.4 It turns out the oft-quoted “drink at least eight
glasses of water a day” recommendation actually has little underpinning
scientific evidence.5</p>
<p>The eight-a-day recommendation can be traced back to a 1921 paper in
which the author measured his own urine and sweat output and determined
he lost about 3 percent of his body weight in water a day, which comes
out to about eight cups.6 Consequently, for the longest time, water
requirement guidelines for humanity were based on just one person’s
urine and sweat measurements.</p>
<p>But now there’s actually extensive evidence suggesting that not
drinking enough water may be associated with a variety of problems,
including falls and fractures, heat stroke, heart disease, lung
disorders, kidney disease, kidney stones, bladder and colon cancer,
urinary tract infections, constipation, dry-eye disease, cavities,
decreased immune function, and cataract formation.7 The problem with
many of these studies, though, is that low water intake is also
associated with several unhealthy behaviors, including low fruit and
vegetable intake, more fast-food consumption, and even less “shopping at
farmers markets.”8 And think about it—who drinks lots of water? People
who exercise a lot. So perhaps it’s no wonder that heavy water drinkers
have lower disease rates.</p>
<p>Only large and expensive randomized trials could definitively settle
these questions. But given that water cannot be patented, such trials
seem unlikely.9 As a result, we’re left with studies that just link
disease with low water intake. But are people sick because they don’t
drink enough water, or are they not drinking enough because they’re
sick? There have been a few large prospective studies in which fluid
intake was measured before disease developed. For example, a Harvard
University study of nearly forty-eight thousand men found that the risk
of bladder cancer decreased by 7 percent for every extra daily cup of
fluid consumed. A high intake of water—say, eight cups a day—may reduce
the risk of bladder cancer by about 50 percent, potentially saving
thousands of lives.10</p>
<p>Probably the best evidence we have for a specific recommendation for
how much water you should be drinking comes from the Adventist Health
Study. Twenty thousand men and women were studied. Those who drank five
or more glasses of water a day had about half the risk of dying from
heart disease compared to those who drank two glasses or less daily.
About half of the cohort consisted of vegetarians, so they were also
getting extra water by eating more fruits and vegetables. As in the
Harvard study, this protection remained even after controlling for other
factors, such as diet and exercise, suggesting that water indeed was the
cause, perhaps by lowering blood “viscosity” (that is, by improving
blood flow).11</p>
<p>If protection against cancer and heart disease isn’t enough
motivation, perhaps the prospect of being a better kisser will be.
Brushing artificial skin against the lips of young women, researchers
found that hydrated lips showed greater sensitivity to light
touch.12</p>
<p>Based on the best evidence to date, authorities from Europe, the U.S.
Institute of Medicine, and the World Health Organization recommend about
eight to eleven cups of water a day for women and ten to fifteen cups a
day for men.13 These recommendations include water from all sources,
though, not solely beverages. You get about four cups from the food you
eat and the water your body actually produces on its own,14 so these
guidelines roughly translate into a daily recommendation for drinking
four to seven cups of water for women and six to eleven cups for men
(assuming only moderate physical activity at moderate ambient
temperatures).15</p>
<p>You can also get water from all the other drinks you consume,
including caffeinated beverages, with the exception of stronger
alcoholic drinks like wines and spirits. Coffee,16 tea,17 and beer can
leave you with more water than you started with, but wine actively
dehydrates you.18 Note, though, in the cancer and heart disease studies
mentioned earlier, the health benefits were almost exclusively
associated with increased consumption of water, not other beverages. I
address the problems with alcoholic drinks in chapters 8 and 11.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Unless you have a condition like heart or kidney failure
or your physician otherwise advises you to restrict your fluid intake, I
recommend you drink five glasses of tap water a day. I prefer tap not
only because it’s less economically and environmentally costly but
because it may have less chemical and microbial contamination than
bottled water.19</p>
<hr />
<p>Can Drinking Water Make You Smarter?</p>
<p>Your brain is 75 percent water.20 When you become dehydrated, your
brain actually shrinks.21 How might this affect brain function?</p>
<p>Based on urine samples obtained from groups of nine- to
eleven-year-old kids in Los Angeles and Manhattan, nearly two-thirds of
children may arrive at school in a state of mild dehydration,22 which
may in turn negatively affect scholastic performance. If you take a
group of schoolkids and randomly assign them to drink either one or zero
cups of water before taking a test, guess which group does significantly
better? The group given the water. These results, the researchers
concluded, suggest that “even children in a state of mild dehydration,
not induced by intentional water deprivation or by heat stress and
living in a cold climate, can benefit from drinking more water and
improve their cognitive performance.”23</p>
<p>Your hydration status may also affect your mood. Restriction of fluid
intake has been shown to increase sleepiness and fatigue, lower levels
of vigor and alertness, and increase feelings of confusion. But as soon
as study subjects are allowed to drink again, the deleterious effects on
alertness, happiness, and clarity of thought are almost immediately
reversed.24 Water absorption begins very rapidly, within five minutes
from mouth to bloodstream, peaking around minute twenty.25 Interestingly
enough, cold water gets sucked in about 20 percent faster than
body-temperature water.26</p>
<p>How can you tell if you’re dehydrated? Just ask your body. If you
chug some water and pee most of it out soon after, this would be your
body’s way of saying it was all topped off. But if you drink a bunch of
water and your body keeps most of it, then your tank was running low.
Researchers used this concept to develop a formal dehydration assessment
tool: Empty your bladder, chug three cups of water, and then see how
much you pee an hour later. They determined that if you drink three cups
and urinate less than one cup within that hour, there’s a good chance
you were dehydrated.27</p>
<hr />
<p>But you know, water can be so boring. So try adding fresh fruit or
veggies as they do in fancy spas and upscale hotels. I like adding
frozen strawberries in place of ice cubes. Sometimes I add a few drops
of a potent juice concentrate, like tart cherry or pomegranate. Cucumber
slices, ginger shavings, a cinnamon stick, lavender, and a mint leaf or
two are also common refreshing additions. My latest favorite flavor
fusions involve mixing tangerine slices and fresh basil or frozen
blackberries and fresh sage.</p>
<p>Bubbles! One of my colleagues at work has a SodaStream on his desk,
and he makes his own sparkling water for about twenty-five cents a cup.
In addition to making water more interesting, carbonation may also help
relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. A randomized trial of the effects of
sparkling versus still water found that drinking carbonated water may
improve symptoms of constipation and dyspepsia, including bloating and
nausea.28</p>
<p>What if you took water and added beans or greens—that is, coffee
beans or tea leaves? Wouldn’t you get all the water you need plus a
bonus of additional nutrients? A cup of black coffee, tea, or herbal tea
only has two calories, potentially offering nutrition at little caloric
cost. Think of healthy beverages as the opposite of junk food: Junk food
offers calories with scarce nutrition, whereas healthy beverages offer
nutrition with scarce calories. But just how healthy are coffee and
tea?</p>
<p>Coffee</p>
<p>I have already discussed the benefits of coffee for the liver
(chapter 8), mind (chapter 12), and brain (chapter 14). What about
overall longevity? Do people who drink coffee live longer lives than
people who don’t?</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study, the
largest-ever prospective study conducted on diet and health, put that
question to the test. Yes, drinking lots of coffee is associated with a
longer life, but the effect is relatively modest. People who drank six
or more cups per day had a 10–15 percent lower mortality rate due to
fewer deaths from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries
and accidents, diabetes, and infections.29 However, when a study looked
at people under the age of fifty-five, the opposite effect was found:
Drinking more than six cups of coffee daily was found to increase the
risk of death. “Hence,” the researchers concluded, “it may be
appropriate to recommend that younger people, in particular, avoid heavy
coffee consumption (less than 28 cups per week or less than 4 cups in a
typical day).”30</p>
<p>The bottom line, based on all the best studies to date, is that
coffee consumption may indeed be associated with a small reduction in
mortality,31 on the order of a 3 percent lower risk of premature death
for each cup of coffee consumed daily.32 Don’t worry, it’s not “wake up
and smell the coffee or don’t wake up at all”—the findings are less
prescriptive than they are reassuring for those concerned about their
coffee addiction.</p>
<p>Coffee is not for everyone. For example, be careful if you have
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While a population study found
no link between coffee consumption and subjective symptoms of GERD, such
as heartburn and regurgitation,33 scientists who actually stuck tubes
down people’s throats to measure their pH found that coffee does seem to
induce significant acid reflux, whereas tea does not. Caffeine does not
appear to be the culprit, since caffeinated water doesn’t cause a
problem. However, the coffee decaffeination process seems to reduce the
level of whichever compounds are responsible, since decaf coffee
appeared to cause less reflux. The researchers advised that people who
suffer from GERD should consider switching to decaf or—even better—drink
tea instead.34</p>
<p>Daily coffee consumption is also associated with a slightly increased
risk of bone fractures among women, but, interestingly, a decreased
fracture risk among men.35 However, no association was found between
coffee and hip fracture risk. Conversely, tea may reduce hip fracture
risk36 but appears to have no significant effect on fracture risk in
general.37 This is an important distinction, because hip fractures are
associated with a shortened life span more than other types of bone
fractures.38</p>
<p>People with glaucoma,39 or perhaps even with merely a family history
of glaucoma,40 may also want to stay away from caffeinated coffee.
Coffee intake is associated with urinary incontinence in both women41
and men.42 And there are case reports of individuals with epilepsy
having fewer seizures after laying off coffee, so avoiding it is
certainly worth a try for people with seizure disorders.43 Finally, it
almost goes without saying that people who have trouble sleeping might
not want to drink too much coffee. Just a single cup at night can cause
a significant deterioration in sleep quality.44</p>
<p>The mystery as to why some studies showed that coffee consumption
increased cholesterol and others did not was solved when it was
discovered that the cholesterol-raising compound thought to be
responsible was fat soluble. The culprit compound, cafestol, is found in
the oils of coffee beans that become trapped in the paper filter, so
drip coffee doesn’t raise cholesterol as much as french press, boiled,
or Turkish (“mud”-style) coffee. Neither the degree of roasting nor
decaffeination appears to make a difference, though Robusta beans have
less cafestol than Arabica beans. If you don’t have optimal cholesterol
levels, you should consider sticking to filtered coffee or using instant
coffee, which also lacks these compounds.45 If these tweaks don’t help,
consider eliminating coffee completely, as even paper-filtered coffee
may raise cholesterol levels a small amount.46</p>
<p>We used to think caffeine might increase the risk of an irregular
heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, but this was based on anecdotal
case reports involving the acute ingestion of very large quantities of
caffeine47 (including a case blamed in part on a woman’s “chocolate
intake abuse”).48 As a result, the erroneous notion that caffeine
ingestion may trigger abnormal heart rhythms became “common knowledge,”
an assumption that led to changes in medical practice. More recently,
however, actual studies were performed that revealed caffeine intake
does not appear to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation after all.49
Moreover, “low-dose” caffeine, which was defined as drinking fewer than
about six cups of coffee a day, may even have a protective effect on
heart rhythm.50</p>
<p>Moderate caffeine consumption in healthy, nonpregnant adults is not
only safe but has been found to increase energy and alertness and
enhance physical, motor, and cognitive performance.51 Despite these
benefits, one medical journal editorialized that doctors should “temper
any message that suggests that caffeine is beneficial … given the
proliferation of energy drinks that contain massive quantities of
caffeine…”52 Indeed, drinking a dozen highly caffeinated energy drinks
within a few hours could cause a lethal caffeine overdose.53 That said,
drinking a few cups of coffee a day may actually extend your life a
bit54 and even has the potential to slightly lower your overall cancer
risk.55</p>
<p>I cannot recommend drinking coffee, though. Why? Because every cup of
coffee is a lost opportunity to drink a potentially even healthier
beverage—a cup of green tea.</p>
<p>Tea</p>
<p>Black, green, and white teas are all made from the leaves of the same
evergreen shrub. Herbal tea, on the other hand, involves pouring hot
water over any plant in the world other than the tea plant.</p>
<p>What’s so special about the tea bush? Phytonutrients exclusive to the
tea plant appear so powerful that they can reverse disease even when
merely applied to the skin. For example, the topical application of
green tea in ointment form on genital warts results in an astounding 100
percent clearance in more than half the patients tested.56 It’s no
wonder that this wonder treatment is now officially incorporated into
the Centers for Disease Control STD Treatment Guidelines.57 There was
even a remarkable case report of a woman whose skin cancers were
apparently stopped with topical green tea application.58 If green tea
can do that on the outside of your body, what might it be able to do
internally?</p>
<p>I already discussed the role green tea may play in breast cancer
prevention in chapter 11. Drinking tea may protect against gynecological
malignancies, such as ovarian cancer59 and endometrial cancer,60 as well
as lower your cholesterol,61 blood pressure,62 blood sugar,63 and body
fat.64 It may protect the brain from both cognitive decline65 and
stroke.66 Tea consumption is also associated with decreased risk of
diabetes,67 tooth loss,68 and up to half the risk of dying from
pneumonia.69 Those who suffer from seasonal allergies may also benefit
from drinking tea. Randomized trials have shown that drinking about
three cups of Japanese Benifuuki green tea per day starting six70 to
ten71 weeks before pollen season significantly reduces allergy symptoms.
That’s nothing to sneeze at!</p>
<hr />
<p>Riding the Waves</p>
<p>The invention of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure brain-wave
activity has been described as “one of the most surprising, remarkable,
and momentous developments in the history of clinical neurology.”72
Scientists discovered that humans have four main mental states—two while
sleeping and two while awake. Delta waves, in which your brain is
electrically pulsing slowly at about one wave per second, are typically
only seen in deep sleep. Then there’s theta-wave sleep. At about five
cycles per second, this mental state occurs when you’re dreaming. The
two waking states are alpha and beta. The alpha state is relaxed, aware,
and attentive, such as when you close your eyes and meditate. Beta,
meanwhile, is the stimulated, hustle-and-bustle state in which most of
us live our lives.</p>
<p>Alpha, however, is where you want to be—fully alert and focused, yet
calm. How do you get there? If you relax in a pleasant, peaceful place,
after about ninety minutes, you can start to generate some significant
alpha activity (though such practicing meditators as Buddhist monks can
achieve this state much earlier and maintain it even with their eyes
open). To acquire this talent, you could meditate every day for a few
years—or you could just drink some tea. Within minutes of tea
consumption, anyone may be able to attain that same relaxed but alert
brain-wave pattern.73 That dramatic alteration in brain activity may
explain why tea is the world’s single most popular beverage after
water.</p>
<hr />
<p>Both white and green teas are less processed than black tea and are
probably preferable.74 White tea is made from young leaves and is named
after the silvery-white hairs on the immature buds; green tea is made
from more mature leaves. Which tea is healthier? The answer seems to
depend on whether or not you add lemon. If you drink your tea without
lemon, green tea appears preferable to white tea. But if you add lemon,
white tea jumps ahead.75 The reason is that while there are more
phytonutrients in white tea, they may only be released at a certain pH
level.76</p>
<p>In terms of cancer prevention potential, both green and white teas
have been shown to protect against DNA damage in vitro against PhIP, the
cooked-meat carcinogen I described in chapter 11. White tea won out,
though, blocking upward of 100 percent of DNA damage compared to green
tea, which at the same concentration only blocked about half. The
“potent antimutagenic activity of white tea in comparison with green
tea” was achieved at a brewing time of one minute. For most of the teas
tested, steeping longer than a minute had no additional effect. In terms
of antioxidant activity, though, it may be better not to brew at
all.77</p>
<p>Cold-steeping is a popular way to prepare tea in Taiwan, especially
during the summer months. Cold-steeped tea is not like conventional iced
tea, in which you brew your tea hot and then cool it down. Rather,
cold-steeping involves tossing the tea in cold water and letting it sit
at room temperature or in the fridge for at least two hours. This method
has been found to reduce the caffeine content and is said to reduce
bitterness and improve the aroma.78 But what does cold-steeping do to
the nutrient content? You would think that cold water wouldn’t draw out
as many antioxidants. After all, nutrient extraction is presumably the
whole point of brewing tea with hot water, right? A group of scientists
took it upon themselves to compare the antioxidant activity of hot-
versus cold-steeped tea. Essentially, they mixed LDL (“bad”) cholesterol
with free radicals and timed how long it took the cholesterol to oxidize
in the presence of both hot- and cold-steeped tea.</p>
<p>In a surprise upset, cold-steeped white tea was significantly better
at slowing down oxidation.79 (No significant effect of brewing
temperature on the antioxidant activity of green tea was found.) The
researchers surmised that traditional tea water is so hot that it
manages to destroy some of the more sensitive antioxidants in white tea.
I no longer brew my tea; I just let it sit overnight in the fridge.
Cold-steeping saves prep time and energy, and may even be healthier.</p>
<p>You don’t have to care how much nutrition is extracted from tea
leaves, though, if you simply eat them. Matcha is powdered green tea,
produced by milling whole tea leaves into a fine powder that can be
added straight to water. Why waste nutrition by dumping a tea bag when
you’re done, when you can drink the leaves instead? Think of it this
way: Drinking steeped tea is akin to boiling a pot of collard greens and
then throwing away the veggies and just drinking the cooking water.
Sure, some of the nutrition leached into the water, but wouldn’t it be
better to eat the leaves themselves? That’s why I now just throw whole
tea leaves straight into my smoothies (see here). This is also a great
way to incorporate tea in your diet if drinking tea on an empty stomach
causes discomfort. If you develop a taste for matcha (I find it a bit
grassy), you can carry around little packets of it wherever you go and
just put some in your water bottle and shake. For essentially zero
calories, you can drink dark-green leafies all day.</p>
<p>If green tea is so good, why not just take green-tea extract pills?
Because of dozens of reported cases of liver toxicity linked to their
use80—yet another demonstration that it’s better to eat the whole food
than some glorified “active ingredient” concentrate. There is one tea
beverage I’d stay away from, though. Based on a few cases of serious,
life-threatening outcomes linked to kombucha tea, a type of fermented
tea, the consumption of kombucha “should be discouraged,” according to
one case report of a person who ended up in a coma after drinking the
stuff.81</p>
<p>Are there any caveats to regular tea consumption? The fluoride
content of tea appears to be the limiting factor. The tea plant
naturally concentrates fluoride from the soil, which is one of the
reasons tea consumption may help fight cavities,82 but too much fluoride
can be toxic. A recent case reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine described a woman who started experiencing bone pain after
seventeen years of habitually consuming a pitcher of tea made from 100
to 150 tea bags daily.83 That’s too much.</p>
<p>To prevent skeletal fluorosis, adults should probably not drink more
than about twenty tea bags’ worth of black tea a day for twenty years
straight, or thirty bags of green daily, or eighty bags of white tea a
day.84 To prevent dental fluorosis, a harmless but unsightly mottled
tooth discoloration, children should probably refrain from drinking more
than about three bags of black tea a day (or around four bags of green
or twelve of white)85 while their teeth are still developing, up until
around age nine.86</p>
<p>The Best Sweetener</p>
<p>In chapter 12, I shared research suggesting that adding sugar may
negate some of the benefits of beverages, while adding artificial
sweeteners like aspartame or saccharine may even make things worse. Are
there any health-promoting sweeteners? The only two concentrated,
green-light sweeteners may be blackstrap molasses and date sugar. Other
natural caloric sweeteners, such as honey, less processed cane sugars,
and maple, agave, and brown rice syrups don’t appear to have much to
offer nutritionally.87 Date sugar is a whole food—just dried dates
ground up into a powder—as are date and prune pastes, which can be
homemade or purchased. These are all good options for baking, but for
sweetening drinks, the taste of molasses may be too strong, and the
whole-food sweeteners don’t fully dissolve.</p>
<p>How about stevia? During the 1990s, research out of Japan found that
steviosides, the “active” ingredient in stevia, appeared harmless. But
in the guts of rats, intestinal bacteria transformed steviosides into a
toxic substance called steviol, which can cause a big spike in mutagenic
DNA damage in vitro.88 Unfortunately, it turns out that humans have the
same bacterial activity in their guts.89 It’s the dose that makes the
poison, though. The World Health Organization considers up to 1.8 mg of
stevia compounds per pound of body weight to be a safe amount. Given the
American sweet tooth, though, if we sweetened everything with stevia,
you could exceed that safety limit. But just drinking up to two
stevia-sweetened beverages a day should be considered harmless.90</p>
<p>The sugar alcohols sorbitol and xylitol are harmless in themselves,
but they aren’t absorbed by the body and end up in the colon, where they
can draw in fluid and cause diarrhea. This is why they’re only used
commercially in small quantities, such as in mints or chewing gum, as
opposed to beverages. A related compound, however, erythritol, is
absorbed and may have the harmlessness of xylitol without the laxative
effect.</p>
<p>Erythritol is found naturally in pears and grapes, but industrially,
yeast is used to produce it. Erythritol doesn’t cause cavities,91 and it
hasn’t been implicated in fibromyalgia,92 preterm birth,93 headaches,94
hypertension,95 brain disorders,96 or platelet disorders97 like other
low-calorie sweeteners. Moreover, erythritol may actually have some
antioxidant properties.98 As with any highly processed product, though,
its utility should be confined to increasing your consumption of
green-light foods. So, for example, if the only way for you to eat half
a grapefruit is to sprinkle some sugar on it, then it’s probably better
to eat a sugared grapefruit than no grapefruit at all—though sprinkling
it with erythritol would be even better. With this logic in mind, I use
erythritol to increase my consumption of cranberries (remember my Pink
Juice recipe in chapter 8?), cocoa powder (see here), and hibiscus
tea.</p>
<hr />
<p>My Hibiscus Punch</p>
<p>In 2010, an antioxidant analysis of three hundred different beverages
was published, examining everything from Red Bull to red wine.99 And the
winner is … hibiscus tea! I documented its potent antihypertensive
effects in chapter 7. I’ve always had “normal” blood pressure by U.S.
standards, but I wanted to shoot for optimal, so hibiscus became a daily
staple for me. Give this recipe a try:</p>
<p>To eight cups of water, add a handful of bulk dried hibiscus or four
bags of tea in which hibiscus is the first ingredient. Then add the
juice of one lemon and three tablespoons of erythritol, and leave it in
your fridge to cold-brew overnight. In the morning, strain out the
hibiscus or take out the tea bags, shake well, and drink throughout the
day. That’s something I try to do every day I’m home.</p>
<p>For extra credit, add green foam: Pour a cup of the tea into a
blender with a bunch of fresh mint leaves, blend on high, and enjoy. You
end up with dark-green leafies blended into what may be the highest
antioxidant beverage in the world, and it tastes like fruit punch. Your
kids will love it!</p>
<p>As with any sour food or beverage, make sure to rinse your mouth with
water after consumption to prevent the natural acids from dissolving
your enamel.100 Do not brush your teeth within an hour after eating or
drinking something sour, as your enamel may be in a softened state and
be further damaged by brushing.101 If you sip continuously throughout
the day, I suggest using a straw to bypass your teeth.102</p>
<hr />
<p>Be careful, though. There are three ways that even harmless
sweeteners could theoretically be harmful. Over the years, numerous
large-scale studies have found a correlation between
artificial-sweetener use and weight gain.103 The most common explanation
for this counterintuitive finding is reverse causation: People aren’t
fat because they drink diet soda; they drink diet soda because they’re
fat.</p>
<p>But there are at least three other less benign alternative
explanations. The first is called “overcompensation for expected caloric
reduction.” If you covertly switch people’s soda for diet soda without
their knowing it, their caloric intake drops.104 This makes sense, since
they’re not drinking all that sugar anymore. But what if you fess up to
what you did? People who knowingly consume artificial sweeteners may
actually end up eating more calories; they may figure after their
zero-calorie drink, they can indulge in that second piece of pie. Indeed
that’s what studies have shown. For example, if you give subjects an
aspartame-sweetened cereal for breakfast, but only inform half the
participants that the sweetener was artificial, when lunchtime comes,
the aspartame-informed group ends up eating significantly more than the
aspartame-naïve group.105 I think of this concept anytime I see someone
at a fast-food restaurant ordering a diet soda with their meal.</p>
<p>A second explanation for gaining weight while using artificial
sweeteners is based on how humankind evolved: When your brain registers
the sensation of sweetness on your tongue, millions of years of
evolution remind your brain to boost your appetite to eat as much as
possible—after all, naturally sweet plant foods like fruits or sweet
potatoes are among the healthiest. When you drink a can of diet soda,
your brain thinks you just stumbled across a wild blueberry bush, and it
sends urgent signals to eat large and eat fast before someone else gets
wind of your bounty. At the same time, your body knows that if you eat
too many calories, you might get too fat and not be able to outrun that
saber-toothed tiger, so when your gut senses that you’ve absorbed enough
calories, it sends signals up to your brain to urge you to stop eating.
When you ingest low-calorie sweeteners, however, you experience the
familiar hunger-boosting effect due to the sensation of sweetness on
your tongue, yet you may lack the hunger-suppressing effect of calories
entering your gut. The result can be a revved-up appetite that can lead
to eating more food than you otherwise would have.106 That’s the second
way diet soda could counterintuitively lead to weight gain.</p>
<p>The third way involves maintaining cravings for, and dependency on,
all things sweet. By continuing to consume any sweeteners—with or
without calories—you are unable to train your flavor preferences away
from intensely sweet foods.107 Let’s say that you use erythritol at
home. That’s great, but what happens when you go on vacation and don’t
have ready access to it? Your preference for intensely sweet food
travels with you, and that may end up translating into the increased
consumption of less-than-healthy foods.</p>
<p>The bottom line? Erythritol seems safe, but only if you don’t use it
as an excuse to eat more junk food. With great sweetness comes great
responsibility.</p>

<p>Drink five glasses of water a day, be they plain tap water or
flavored with fruit, tea leaves, or herbs. Keeping hydrated may elevate
your mood (and vigor!), improve your thinking, and even help cut your

<p>More than two-thirds of American adults are overweight.1 Think about
that. Fewer than one in three people maintain a healthy weight. What’s
more, by 2030, more than half the country’s population may be clinically
obese. Over the last three decades, childhood obesity has tripled, and
most overweight kids will continue to be overweight into adulthood.2 As
mentioned earlier, we may be in the process of raising the first
generation of children in America with a shorter predicted life span
than their parents.3</p>
<p>The food industries like to blame inactivity as the prime cause of
obesity, not the promotion and consumption of their calorie-rich
products.4 On the contrary, however, research suggests that the level of
physical activity may have actually increased in the United States over
the past few decades.5 We know that obesity is rising even in areas
where people are exercising more.6 This is likely explained by the fact
that eating activity levels are outstripping physical activity
levels.7</p>
<p>Compared to eating habits in the 1970s, every day, children are
consuming the caloric equivalent of an extra can of soda and small
fries, and adults are eating an extra Big Mac’s worth of calories. Just
to make up for the extra calories Americans are taking in compared to a
few decades ago, as a nation, we’d need to walk an extra two hours a
day, every day of the week.8</p>
<p>Surveys suggest that most people believe controlling diet and getting
enough exercise are equally important for weight control.9 It’s a lot
easier to eat, however, than to move. To walk off the calories found in
a single pat of butter or margarine, you’d have to add about an extra
half mile to your evening stroll. For every additional sardine on your
Caesar salad, that’s another quarter-mile jog. If you eat two chicken
legs, you’ll need to get up on your own two legs and run three miles
just to make up for it—and that’s stewed chicken, skin removed.10</p>
<p>Researchers who accept grants from the Coca-Cola Company11 call
physical inactivity “the biggest public health problem of the 21st
century.”12 Actually, physical inactivity ranks down at number five in
terms of risk factors for death in the United States and number six in
terms of risk factors for disability.13 And inactivity barely makes the
top ten globally.14 As we’ve learned, diet is by far our greatest
killer, followed by smoking.15</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean you should sit on the couch all day. As
we’ve seen in this book, in addition to helping you enjoy a healthy body
weight, exercise can also ward off and possibly reverse mild cognitive
decline, boost your immune system, prevent and treat high blood
pressure, and improve your mood and quality of sleep, among many other
benefits. If the U.S. population collectively exercised enough to shave
just 1 percent off the national body mass index (BMI), 2 million cases
of diabetes, 1.5 million cases of heart disease, and up to 127,000 cases
of cancer might be prevented.16</p>
<p>Stand Up for Your Health</p>
<p>It turns out your mom and dad were right about the hazards of
watching too much television—although it may not rot the brain so much
as the body. Based on a study of about nine thousand adults followed for
seven years, researchers calculated that every additional hour spent
watching TV per day may be associated with an 11 percent increased risk
of death.17 Screen time in general—including playing video games—appears
to be a risk factor for premature death.18 So does that mean you have to
kill your TV and PlayStation before they kill you?</p>
<p>It’s not the electronics themselves but the sedentary behavior
associated with enjoying them. Of course, not all sedentary behaviors
are bad.19 Consider sleeping—you can’t be more sedentary than that! The
problem appears to be sedentary sitting. After tracking the health of
more than one hundred thousand Americans for fourteen years, an American
Cancer Society study found that men who sit for six hours or more per
day have a 20 percent higher overall death rate compared to men who sit
for three hours or less, while women who sit for more than six hours
have a 40 percent higher death rate.20 A meta-analysis of forty-three
such studies found that excess sitting was associated with a shorter
life span,21 and this may be “regardless of physical activity level.” In
other words, people who religiously hit the gym after work may still
have shortened life spans if they are otherwise sitting throughout the
day. Sitting for six or more hours a day appears to increase mortality
rates even among people who run or swim for an hour a day, every day,
seven days a week.22</p>
<p>I’m not saying we should all quit our desk jobs, but there are other
options. For instance, try switching to a standing desk, which elevates
the heart rate and may burn as many as fifty extra calories per hour.
This may not seem like a lot, but simply standing for three hours a day
at work equates to about thirty thousand extra calories burned per
year—the equivalent of running ten marathons.23 Whether you’re at the
office, reading the newspaper at home, or, yes, even watching TV, why
not find a way to stand while doing it? In fact, most of this book was
written while I was walking fifteen miles a day on a treadmill
underneath my standing desk. Prebuilt treadmill desks are expensive, but
thrift stores are often awash with old exercise equipment. My treadmill
“desk” is just a treadmill stuck under some cheap plastic shelving.</p>
<p>If you have been sedentary for a long time, start out slowly. I’m
sure you’ve heard the familiar refrain: “Before starting this or any
other exercise program, be sure to check with your doctor.” This is
definitely true for vigorous exercise, but most people can safely start
to take up walking ten or fifteen minutes a few times a day. If,
however, you are unsteady on your feet, prone to dizzy spells, or have a
chronic or unstable health condition, it really is best to first consult
with a health professional.</p>
<hr />
<p>What If You Really Have to Sit All Day?</p>
<p>Why is sitting around so bad for you? One reason may be endothelial
dysfunction, the inability of the inner lining of your blood vessels to
signal your arteries to relax normally in response to blood flow. Just
as your muscles atrophy if you don’t use them, “use it or lose it” may
apply to arterial function as well. Increased blood flow promotes a
healthy endothelium.24 Blood flow is what maintains the stability and
integrity of the inner lining of your arteries. Without that constant
tugging flow with each heartbeat of exertion, you can end up a sitting
duck for arterial dysfunction diseases.</p>
<p>What if sitting all day is part of your job? Research suggests
treadmill desks may improve the health of office workers without
detracting from work performance,25 but your office might not
accommodate a standing desk. Preliminary evidence from observational26
as well as interventional27 studies suggests that regular interruptions
in sitting time can be beneficial. And they don’t have to be long.
Breaks could be as short as one minute and not necessarily entail
strenuous exercise—just walking up and down stairs may be enough.
Another option at a sedentary workplace is to opt for “walking meetings”
rather than traditional sit-downs.</p>
<p>What if you have a sitting job in which you can’t take frequent
breaks, like truck driving? Is there any way to improve your endothelial
function sitting on your butt? First you need to get rid of any
butts—cigarette butts, that is. Smoking a single cigarette can
significantly impair endothelial function.28 Diet-wise, drinking green
tea every two hours can help keep your endothelium functional,29 as can
eating meals with greens and other nitrate-rich vegetables. (See chapter
7.)</p>
<p>Turmeric may also help. One head-to-head study found that daily
ingestion of the turmeric component curcumin can improve endothelial
function just as well as up to an hour a day of aerobic exercise.30 Does
that mean you can just be a couch potato as long as you eat curried
potatoes? No, you still need to move around as much as possible—the
combination of curcumin and exercise appears to work even better than
either option alone.31</p>
<hr />
<p>Treating Sore Muscles with Plants</p>
<p>Optimizing recovery from exercise is considered the holy grail of
exercise science.32 Anyone who works out regularly knows about sore
muscles. There’s the burning sensation during strenuous exercise, which
may be related to the buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, and then
there’s delayed-onset muscle soreness, the kind you get in the days
following extreme physical activity. Delayed soreness is likely the
result of inflammation caused by microtears in your muscles and can
adversely affect athletic performance in the days following a heavy
workout. If you’re suffering from an inflammatory reaction, might
anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help? The bioflavonoids in citrus can
help with the lactic acid buildup,33 but you may need to ramp up to the
anthocyanin flavonoids in berries to deal with the inflammation.</p>
<p>Muscle biopsies of athletes have confirmed that eating blueberries,
for example, can significantly reduce exercise-induced inflammation.34
Studies using cherries show that this anti-inflammatory effect can
translate into faster recovery time, reducing the strength loss from
excessive bicep curling from 22 percent down to only 4 percent in male
college students over the subsequent four days.35 The muscle-soothing
effects of berries don’t only work for weight lifters; follow-up studies
have shown that cherries can also help reduce muscle pain in
long-distance runners36 and aid in recovery from marathons.37</p>
<p>Eating two cups of watermelon prior to intense physical activity was
also found to significantly reduce muscle soreness. The researchers
concluded that functional compounds in fruits and vegetables can “play a
key role in the design of new natural and functional products” like
beverages, juices, and energy bars.38 But why design new products when
nature has already designed everything you need?</p>
<p>Preventing Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress</p>
<p>As discussed in part 1, when you use oxygen to burn fuel in your
body, free radicals can be produced, just as cars burning fuel produce
combustion by-products out the exhaust. This happens even if you’re just
idling, living your day-to-day life. What if you rev things up, start
exercising, and really start burning fuel? Might you create more
oxidative stress and therefore need to eat even more antioxidant-rich
foods?</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that ultramarathoners show evidence of DNA
damage in about 10 percent of their cells tested during39 and up to two
weeks following40 a race. But most of us aren’t ultramarathoners. Might
short bouts of exercise still damage your DNA?</p>
<p>Yes. After just five minutes of moderate or intense cycling, you can
get an uptick in DNA damage.41 Never ones to miss an opportunity,
pharmaceutical and supplement companies have investigated ways to block
exercise-induced oxidative damage with antioxidant pills, but,
ironically, this may lead to a state of pro-oxidation. For example, guys
doing arm curls taking about 1,000 mg of vitamin C ended up with more
muscle damage and oxidative stress.42</p>
<p>Instead of using supplements, what about using antioxidant-rich foods
to douse the free radicals? Researchers led subjects onto treadmills and
cranked up the intensity until they nearly collapsed. While a spike in
free-radical levels was witnessed in the control group, subjects who
loaded up on watercress two hours before exercising actually ended up
with fewer free radicals after the treadmill test than when they
started. After two months of eating a daily serving of watercress, no
DNA damage resulted, no matter how much it seemed the subjects were
punished on the treadmill.43 So, with a healthy diet, you can get the
best of both worlds—all the benefits of strenuous exercise without
excess free-radical damage. As a review in the Journal of Sports
Sciences put it, those who eat plant-based diets may naturally “have an
enhanced antioxidant defence system to counter exercise-induced
oxidative stress.”44 Whether it’s about training longer or living
longer, the science seems clear. Your quality and quantity of life
improves when you choose green-light foods.</p>
<p>How Much Should You Exercise?</p>
<p>The current official physical activity guidelines recommend adults
get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise, which
comes out to a little more than 20 minutes a day.45 That’s actually down
from previous recommendations from the surgeon general,46 the CDC, and
the American College of Sports Medicine,47 which recommended at least 30
minutes each day. The exercise authorities seem to have fallen into the
same trap as the nutrition authorities, recommending what they think may
be achievable, rather than simply informing you what the science says
and letting you make up your own mind. They already emphasize that any
physical activity is better than none,48 so why not stop patronizing the
public and just tell everyone the truth?</p>
<p>It is true that walking 150 minutes a week is better than walking 60
minutes a week. Following the current recommendations for 150 minutes
appears to reduce your overall mortality rate by 7 percent compared to
being sedentary. Walking for only 60 minutes a week only drops your
mortality rate about 3 percent. But walking 300 minutes a week drops
overall mortality by 14 percent.49 So walking twice as long—40 minutes a
day compared to the recommended 20—yields twice the benefit. And an
hour-long walk each day may reduce mortality by 24 percent!50 (I use
walking as an example because it’s an exercise nearly everyone can do,
but the same goes for other moderate-intensity activities, such as
gardening or cycling.51)</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of physical activity dose and longevity found that
the equivalent of about an hour a day of brisk (4 mph) walking was good,
but 90 minutes was even better.52 What about more than 90 minutes?
Unfortunately, so few people exercise that much every day that there
weren’t enough studies to compile a higher category. If we know 90
minutes of exercise a day is better than 60 minutes is better than 30
minutes, why is the recommendation only 20 minutes? I understand that
only about half of Americans even make the recommended 20 minutes a
day,53 so the authorities are just hoping to nudge people in the right
direction. It’s like the dietary guidelines advising us to “eat less
candy.” If only they’d just give it to us straight.</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve tried to do in this book.</p>
