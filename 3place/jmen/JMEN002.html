<h4 id="to-my-grandma">To my grandma</h4>
<p>Frances Greger</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>It all started with my grandmother.</p>
<p>I was only a kid when the doctors sent her home in a wheelchair to
die. Diagnosed with end-stage heart disease, she had already had so many
bypass operations that the surgeons essentially ran out of plumbing—the
scarring from each open-heart surgery had made the next more difficult
until they finally ran out of options. Confined to a wheelchair with
crushing chest pain, her doctors told her there was nothing else they
could do. Her life was over at age sixty-five.</p>
<p>I think what sparks many kids to want to become doctors when they
grow up is watching a beloved relative become ill or even die. But for
me, it was watching my grandma get better.</p>
<p>Soon after she was discharged from the hospital to spend her last
days at home, a segment aired on 60 Minutes about Nathan Pritikin, an
early lifestyle medicine pioneer who had been gaining a reputation for
reversing terminal heart disease. He had just opened a new center in
California, and my grandmother, in desperation, somehow made the
cross-country trek to become one of its first patients. This was a
live-in program where everyone was placed on a plant-based diet and then
started on a graded exercise regimen. They wheeled my grandmother in,
and she walked out.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget that.</p>
<p>She was even featured in Pritikin’s biography Pritikin: The Man Who
Healed America’s Heart. My grandma was described as one of the “death’s
door people”:</p>
<p>Frances Greger, from North Miami, Florida, arrived in Santa Barbara
at one of Pritikin’s early sessions in a wheelchair. Mrs. Greger had
heart disease, angina, and claudication; her condition was so bad she
could no longer walk without great pain in her chest and legs. Within
three weeks, though, she was not only out of her wheelchair but was
walking ten miles a day.1</p>
<p>When I was a kid, that was all that mattered: I got to play with
Grandma again. But over the years, I grew to understand the significance
of what had happened. At that time, the medical profession didn’t even
think it was possible to reverse heart disease. Drugs were given to try
to slow the progression, and surgery was performed to circumvent clogged
arteries to try to relieve symptoms, but the disease was expected to get
worse and worse until you died. Now, however, we know that as soon as we
stop eating an artery-clogging diet, our bodies can start healing
themselves, in many cases opening up arteries without drugs or
surgery.</p>
<p>My grandma was given her medical death sentence at age sixty-five.
Thanks to a healthy diet and lifestyle, she was able to enjoy another
thirty-one years on this earth with her six grandchildren. The woman who
was once told by doctors she only had weeks to live didn’t die until she
was ninety-six years old. Her near-miraculous recovery not only inspired
one of those grandkids to pursue a career in medicine but granted her
enough healthy years to see him graduate from medical school.</p>
<p>By the time I became a doctor, giants like Dean Ornish, M.D.,
president and founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research
Institute, had already proven beyond a shadow of a doubt what Pritikin
had shown to be true. Using the latest high-tech advances—cardiac PET
scans,2 quantitative coronary arteriography,3 and radionuclide
ventriculography4—Dr. Ornish and his colleagues showed that the
lowest-tech approach—diet and lifestyle—can undeniably reverse heart
disease, our leading killer.</p>
<p>Dr. Ornish and his colleagues’ studies were published in some of the
most prestigious medical journals in the world. Yet medical practice
hardly changed. Why? Why were doctors still prescribing drugs and using
Roto-Rooter-type procedures to just treat the symptoms of heart disease
and to try to forestall what they chose to believe was the inevitable—an
early death?</p>
<p>This was my wake-up call. I opened my eyes to the depressing fact
that there are other forces at work in medicine besides science. The
U.S. health care system runs on a fee-for-service model in which doctors
get paid for the pills and procedures they prescribe, rewarding quantity
over quality. We don’t get reimbursed for time spent counseling our
patients about the benefits of healthy eating. If doctors were instead
paid for performance, there would be a financial incentive to treat the
lifestyle causes of disease. Until the model of reimbursement changes, I
don’t expect great changes in medical care or medical education.5</p>
<p>Only a quarter of medical schools appear to offer a single dedicated
course on nutrition.6 During my first interview for medical school, at
Cornell University, I remember the interviewer emphatically stating,
“Nutrition is superfluous to human health.” And he was a pediatrician! I
knew I was in for a long road ahead. Come to think of it, I think the
only medical professional who ever asked me about a family member’s diet
was our veterinarian.</p>
<p>I was honored to be accepted by nineteen medical schools. I chose
Tufts because they boasted the most nutrition training—twenty-one hours’
worth, although this was still less than 1 percent of the
curriculum.</p>
<p>During my medical training, I was offered countless steak dinners and
fancy perks by Big Pharma representatives, but not once did I get a call
from Big Broccoli. There is a reason you hear about the latest drugs on
television: Huge corporate budgets drive their promotion. The same
reason you’ll probably never see a commercial for sweet potatoes is the
same reason breakthroughs on the power of foods to affect your health
and longevity may never make it to the public: There’s little profit
motive.</p>
<p>In medical school, even with our paltry twenty-one hours of nutrition
training, there was no mention of using diet to treat chronic disease,
let alone reverse it. I was only aware of this body of work because of
my family’s personal story.</p>
<p>The question that haunted me during training was this: If the cure to
our number-one killer could get lost down the rabbit hole, what else
might be buried in the medical literature? I made it my life’s mission
to find out.</p>
<p>Most of my years in Boston were spent scouring the dusty stacks in
the basement of Harvard’s Countway Library of Medicine. I started
practicing medicine, but no matter how many patients I saw in the clinic
every day, even when I was able to change the lives of entire families
at a time, I knew it was just a drop in the bucket, so I went on the
road.</p>
<p>With the help of the American Medical Student Association, my goal
was to speak at every medical school in the country every two years to
influence an entire generation of new doctors. I didn’t want another
doctor to graduate without this tool—the power of food—in her or his
toolbox. If my grandma didn’t have to die from heart disease, perhaps no
one’s grandparent did.</p>
<p>There were periods where I was giving forty talks a month. I’d roll
into town to give a breakfast talk at a Rotary Club, give a presentation
at the medical school over lunch, and then speak to a community group in
the evening. I was living out of my car, one key on my keychain. I ended
up giving more than a thousand presentations around the world.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, life on the road was not sustainable. I lost a
marriage over it. With more speaking requests than I could accept, I
started putting all my annual research findings into a DVD series,
Latest in Clinical Nutrition. It’s hard to believe I’m almost up to
volume 30. Every penny I receive from those DVDs, then and now, goes
directly to charity, as does the money from my speaking engagements and
book sales, including the book you’re reading now.</p>
<p>As corrupting an influence as money is in medicine, it appears to me
even worse in the field of nutrition, where it seems everyone has his or
her own brand of snake-oil supplement or wonder gadget. Dogmas are
entrenched and data too often cherry-picked to support preconceived
notions.</p>
<p>True, I have biases of my own to rein in. Although my original
motivation was health, over the years, I’ve grown into quite the animal
lover. Three cats and a dog run our household, and I’ve spent much of my
professional life proudly serving the Humane Society of the United
States as the charity’s public health director. So, like many people, I
care about the welfare of the animals we eat, but first and foremost, I
am a physician. My primary duty has always been to care for my patients,
to accurately provide the best available balance of evidence.</p>
<p>In the clinic, I could reach hundreds; on the road, thousands. But
this life-or-death information needed to reach millions. Enter Jesse
Rasch, a Canadian philanthropist who shared my vision of making
evidence-based nutrition freely accessible and available to all. The
foundation he and his wife, Julie, set up put all my work online—thus,
NutritionFacts.org was born. I can now reach more people while working
from home in my pajamas than I ever could when I was traveling the
world.</p>
<p>Now a self-sustaining nonprofit organization itself,
NutritionFacts.org has more than a thousand bite-sized videos on nearly
every conceivable nutrition topic, and I post new videos and articles
every day. Everything on the website is free for all, for all time.
There are no ads, no corporate sponsorships. It’s just a labor of
love.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I started this work more than a decade ago, I thought the answer
was to train the trainers, educate the profession. But with the
democratization of information, doctors no longer hold a monopoly as
gatekeepers of knowledge about health. When it comes to safe, simple
lifestyle prescriptions, I’m realizing it may be more effective to
empower individuals directly. In a recent national survey of doctor
office visits, only about one in five smokers were told to quit.7 Just
as you don’t have to wait for your physician to tell you to stop
smoking, you don’t have to wait to start eating healthier. Then together
we can show my medical colleagues the true power of healthy living.</p>
<p>Today, I live within biking distance of the National Library of
Medicine, the largest medical library in the world. Last year alone,
there were more than twenty-four thousand papers published in the
medical literature on nutrition, and I now have a team of researchers, a
wonderful staff, and an army of volunteers who help me dig through the
mountains of new information. This book is not just another platform
through which I can share my findings but a long-awaited opportunity to
share practical advice about how to put this life-changing, life-saving
science into practice in our daily lives.</p>
<p>I think my grandma would be proud.</p>
