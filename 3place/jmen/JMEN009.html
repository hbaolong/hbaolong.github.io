<h4 id="chapter-6-how-not-to-die-from-diabetes">CHAPTER 6 How Not to Die
from Diabetes</h4>
<p>A few years ago, Millan, a member of the NutritionFacts.org
community, was kind enough to share her story with me. When she was
thirty years old, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Millan had
struggled with obesity all her life and suffered through the highs and
lows of years of yo-yo dieting. She had tried nearly every fad diet she
could find but, not surprisingly, would quickly gain back whatever
weight she’d lost. Diabetes wasn’t a stranger to her. Millan’s parents,
brothers, and aunt were all diabetic, so she figured that her own
diagnosis was inevitable. It’s age related. It’s genetic. There was
nothing she could do. Or so she thought.</p>
<p>Millan’s initial diagnosis was back in 1970, and she lived as a
diabetic for two decades. Then, in the 1990s, she switched to an
entirely plant-based diet and completely turned her life around. Today,
her energy levels are better than ever, she looks and feels younger, and
she’s finally been able to maintain a healthy weight. More than four
decades after being diagnosed as a diabetic, Millan, now in her
seventies, is fit as a fiddle. She even teaches high-intensity Zumba
classes! She didn’t find some wonder drug or trademarked diet. She
simply decided to eat healthier food.</p>
<hr />
<p>The disease called diabetes mellitus comes from two words: diabetes
(Greek for “to pass through or siphon”) and mellitus (Latin for “honey
sweet”). Diabetes mellitus is characterized by chronically elevated
levels of sugar in your blood. This is because either your pancreas
gland isn’t making enough insulin (the hormone that keeps your blood
sugar in check) or because your body becomes resistant to insulin’s
effects. The insulin-deficiency disease is called type 1 diabetes, and
the insulin-resistance disease is called type 2 diabetes. If too much
sugar builds up in your blood, it can overwhelm the kidneys and spill
into your urine.</p>
<p>How did people test urine before they had modern laboratory
techniques? They tasted it. Diabetic urine can evidently taste as sweet
as honey. Hence the name.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes has been called the “Black Death of the twenty-first
century” in terms of its exponential spread around the world and its
devastating health impacts. Instead of the bubonic plague, though, the
pathological agents in obesity and type 2 diabetes are identified as
“high-fat and high-calorie diets,” and instead of fleas and rodents, the
causes are “advertisements and inducements to poor lifestyle.”1 More
than twenty million Americans are currently diagnosed with diabetes, a
tripling of cases since 1990.2 At this rate, the CDC predicts that one
in three Americans will be diabetic by midcentury.3 Currently in the
United States, diabetes causes about 50,000 cases of kidney failure,
75,000 lower extremity amputations, 650,000 cases of vision loss,4 and
about 75,000 deaths every year.5</p>
<p>Your digestive system breaks down the carbohydrates you eat into a
simple sugar called glucose, which is the primary fuel powering all the
cells in your body. To get from the bloodstream into your cells, glucose
requires insulin. Think of insulin as the key that unlocks the doors to
your cells to allow glucose to enter. Every time you eat a meal, insulin
is released by your pancreas to help shuttle the glucose into your
cells. Without insulin, your cells can’t accept glucose, and, as a
result, the glucose builds up in your blood. Over time, this extra sugar
can damage the blood vessels throughout the body. That’s why diabetes
can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, and stroke. High
blood sugar can also damage your nerves, creating a condition known as
neuropathy that can cause numbness, tingling, and pain. Because of the
damage to their blood vessels and nerves, diabetics may also suffer from
poor circulation and lack of feeling in the legs and feet, which can
lead to poorly healing injuries that can, in turn, end as
amputations.</p>
<p>Type 1 diabetes, previously called juvenile-onset diabetes,
represents approximately 5 percent of all diagnosed diabetes cases.6 In
most people with type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys
the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, blood
sugar rises to unsafe levels. Type 1 diabetes is therefore treated with
injections of insulin, a type of hormone-replacement therapy, to make up
for the lack of production. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is
unknown, though a genetic predisposition combined with exposure to such
environmental triggers as viral infection and/or cow’s milk may play a
role.7</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes, previously known as adult-onset diabetes, accounts
for 90–95 percent of diabetes cases.8 In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas
can make insulin, but it doesn’t work as well. The accumulation of fat
inside the cells of your muscles and liver interferes with the action of
insulin.9 If insulin is the key that unlocks the doors to your cells,
saturated fat is what appears to gum up the locks. With glucose denied
entry into your muscles, the primary consumer of such fuel, sugar levels
can rise to damaging levels in your blood. The fat inside these muscle
cells can come from the fat you eat or the fat you wear (i.e., your body
fat). The prevention, treatment, and reversal of type 2 diabetes
therefore depends on diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>The CDC estimates that more than twenty-nine million Americans are
living with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes—that’s about 9 percent of
the U.S. population. Out of one hundred people you know, chances are six
of them already know they are diabetic and about three have diabetes but
haven’t yet been diagnosed. More than one million new cases of type 2
diabetes are diagnosed each year.10</p>
<p>The good news: Type 2 diabetes is almost always preventable, often
treatable, and sometimes even reversible through diet and lifestyle
changes. Like other leading killers—especially heart disease and high
blood pressure—type 2 diabetes is an unfortunate consequence of your
dietary choices. But even if you already have diabetes and its
complications, there is hope. Through lifestyle changes, you may be able
to achieve a complete remission of type 2 diabetes, even if you’ve been
suffering with the disease for decades. In fact, by switching to a
healthy diet, you can start improving your health within a matter of
hours.</p>
<p>What Causes Insulin Resistance?</p>
<p>The hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance in your
muscles. As we’ve learned, insulin normally enables blood sugar to enter
the cells, but when the cells are resistant and don’t respond to insulin
as they should, it can lead to dangerous levels of sugar remaining in
the bloodstream.</p>
<p>What causes insulin resistance in the first place?</p>
<p>Studies dating back nearly a century note a striking finding. In
1927, researchers divided healthy young medical students into multiple
groups to test out the effects of different diets. Some were given a
fat-rich diet composed of olive oil, butter, egg yolks, and cream;
others were given a carbohydrate-rich diet of sugar, candy, pastry,
white bread, baked potatoes, syrup, bananas, rice, and oatmeal.
Surprisingly, insulin resistance skyrocketed in the fat-rich diet group;
within a matter of days, their blood sugar levels doubled in response to
a sugar challenge, far more than those on the sugar and starch diet.11
It took scientists another seven decades to unravel the mystery of why
this happened, but the answer would provide the key to what causes type
2 diabetes.</p>
<p>To understand the role of diet, we must first understand how the body
stores fuel. When athletes talk about “carb loading” before a
competition, they’re referring to the need to build a fuel supply in
their muscles. Carb loading is a more extreme version of what you do
every day: Your digestive system breaks down the starch you eat into
glucose, which enters your circulatory system as blood sugar and is then
stored in your muscles to be used for energy as needed.</p>
<p>Blood sugar, though, is a little like a vampire: It needs an
invitation to come into your cells. And that invitation is insulin, the
key that unlocks the front door of your muscle cells so glucose can
enter. When insulin attaches to insulin receptors on a cell, it
activates a series of enzymes that escort in the glucose. Without
insulin, blood glucose is stuck out in the bloodstream, banging on your
cells’ front door, unable to enter. Blood sugar levels then rise,
damaging vital organs in the process. In type 1 diabetes, the body
destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, so very
little insulin is present to let blood sugar enter your cells. But with
type 2 diabetes, insulin production isn’t the problem. The key is there,
but something has gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance.
Your muscle cells become resistant to the effect of insulin.</p>
<p>So what’s jamming up the door locks on your muscle cells, preventing
insulin from letting glucose enter? Fat—more specifically,
intramyocellular lipid, the fat inside your muscle cells.</p>
<p>Fat in your bloodstream, either from your own fat stores or from your
diet, can build up inside your muscle cells, where it can create toxic
breakdown products and free radicals that block the insulin-signaling
process.12 No matter how much insulin you produce, your fat-compromised
muscle cells can’t effectively use it.</p>
<p>This mechanism by which fat interferes with insulin function has been
demonstrated by either infusing fat into people’s bloodstreams and
watching insulin resistance shoot up13 or by removing fat from people’s
blood and seeing insulin resistance drop.14 We can now even visualize
the amount of fat in the muscles using MRI technology.15 Researchers are
now able to track the fat going from the blood into the muscles and
watch insulin resistance rise.16 One hit of fat, and within 160 minutes,
the absorption of glucose into your cells becomes compromised.17</p>
<p>Researchers don’t have to give their study subjects fat through an
IV, though. All they have to do is feed them.</p>
<p>Even among healthy individuals, a high-fat diet can impair the body’s
ability to handle sugar. But you can lower your insulin resistance by
lowering your fat intake. Research has clearly shown that as the amount
of fat in your diet becomes increasingly lower, insulin works
increasingly better.18 Unfortunately, given the current diets of
American children, we’re seeing both obesity and type 2 diabetes occur
earlier and earlier in life.</p>
<p>Prediabetes in Children</p>
<p>Prediabetes is defined by elevated blood sugar levels that are not
yet high enough to reach the official diabetes threshold. Commonly found
among those who are overweight and obese, in the past, prediabetes was
regarded as a high-risk state that presaged diabetes, but it was not
thought to be a disease in itself. However, we now know that prediabetic
individuals may already be experiencing organ damage.</p>
<p>Prediabetics may already have sugar damage to their kidneys, eyes,
blood vessels, and nerves even before diabetes is diagnosed.19 Evidence
from numerous studies suggests that chronic complications of type 2
diabetes begin occurring during the prediabetic state.20 To prevent
diabetic damage, therefore, we need to prevent prediabetes—and the
earlier, the better.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, virtually all diabetes in children was assumed to
be type 1. But since the mid-1990s, we’ve started to see an increase in
type 2 diabetes among kids.21 What was once called “adult-onset
diabetes” is now known as type 2 diabetes because children as young as
eight are developing the disease.22 This trend can have devastating
consequences: A fifteen-year follow-up study of children who were
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes found an alarming prevalence of
blindness, amputation, kidney failure, and death by the time these kids
had reached young adulthood.23</p>
<p>Why the dramatic rise in childhood diabetes? It’s likely due to the
dramatic rise in childhood obesity.24 Over recent decades, the number of
American children considered to be overweight has increased by more than
100 percent.25 Children who are obese at age six are more likely than
not to stay that way, and 75–80 percent of obese adolescents will remain
obese as adults.26</p>
<p>Childhood obesity is a powerful predictor of adult disease and death.
For example, being overweight as a teenager was found to predict disease
risk fifty-five years later. Such individuals may end up with twice the
risk of dying from heart disease and a higher incidence of other
diseases, including colorectal cancer, gout, and arthritis. Researchers
have found that being overweight as a teen could be an even more
powerful predictor of disease risk than being overweight as an
adult.27</p>
<p>To prevent childhood diabetes, we need to prevent childhood obesity.
How do we do that?</p>
<p>In 2010, the chair of the nutrition department at Loma Linda
University published a paper suggesting that giving up meat entirely is
an effective way to combat childhood obesity, pointing to population
studies demonstrating that people eating plant-based diets are
consistently thinner than those who eat meat.28</p>
<p>To study body weight, we usually rely on body mass index (BMI), which
is a measure of weight that also takes height into account. For adults,
a BMI over 30 is considered obese. Between 25 and 29.9 is considered
overweight, and a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered “ideal
weight.” In the medical profession, we used to call a BMI of under 25
“normal weight.” Sadly, that’s no longer normal.</p>
<p>What’s your BMI? Visit one of the scores of online BMI calculators or
grab a calculator and multiply your weight in pounds by 703. Then divide
that twice by your height in inches. For example, if you weigh 200
pounds and are 71 inches tall (five foot eleven), that would be (200 ×
703) ÷ 71 ÷ 71 = 27.9, a BMI indicating that you would be,
unfortunately, significantly overweight.</p>
<p>The largest study ever to compare the obesity rates of those eating
plant-based diets was published in North America. Meat eaters topped the
charts with an average BMI of 28.8—close to being obese. Flexitarians
(people who ate meat more on a weekly basis rather than daily) did
better at a BMI of 27.3, but were still overweight. With a BMI of 26.3,
pesco-vegetarians (people who avoid all meat except fish) did better
still. Even U.S. vegetarians tend to be marginally overweight, coming in
at 25.7. The only dietary group found to be of ideal weight were the
vegans, whose BMI averaged 23.6.29</p>
<p>So why aren’t more parents feeding their kids plant-based diets?
There’s a common misconception in America that their growth will be
stunted. However, the opposite may be true. Loma Linda University
researchers found that children who eat vegetarian diets not only grow
up leaner than kids who eat meat but taller, too, by about an inch.30 In
contrast, meat intake is associated more with horizontal growth: The
same researchers found a strong link between consumption of animal foods
and increased risk of being overweight.31</p>
<p>Developing diabetes in childhood appears to cut life expectancy by
about twenty years.32 Who among us wouldn’t go to the ends of the earth
to enable our kids to live two decades longer?</p>
<p>THE FAT YOU EAT AND THE FAT YOU WEAR</p>
<p>Carrying excess body fat is the number-one risk factor for type 2
diabetes; up to 90 percent of those who develop the disease are
overweight.33 What’s the connection? In part, a phenomenon known as the
spillover effect.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the number of individual fat cells in your body
doesn’t change much in adulthood, no matter how much weight you gain or
lose. They just swell up with fat as the body gains weight, so when your
belly gets bigger, you’re not necessarily creating new fat cells;
rather, you’re just cramming more fat into existing ones.34 In
overweight and obese people, these cells can get so bloated that they
actually spill fat back into the bloodstream, potentially causing the
same clogging of insulin signaling one would experience from eating a
fatty meal.</p>
<p>Doctors can actually measure the level of freely floating fat in the
bloodstream. Normally, it’s between about one hundred and five hundred
micromoles per liter. But people who are obese have blood levels between
roughly six hundred and eight hundred. People eating low-carb, high-fat
diets can reach the same elevated levels. Even a trim person eating a
high-fat diet can average eight hundred, so that sky-high number isn’t
exclusive to obese patients. Because those eating high-fat diets are
absorbing so much fat into their bloodstreams from their digestive
tract, the level of free fat in their blood is as high as someone who’s
grossly obese.35</p>
<p>Similarly, being obese can be like gorging on bacon and butter all
day even if you are actually eating healthfully. That’s because an obese
person’s body may be constantly spilling fat into the bloodstream,
regardless of what goes into the mouth. No matter the source of fat in
your blood, as fat levels rise, your ability to clear sugar from the
blood drops due to insulin resistance—the cause of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>People who eat a plant-based diet, on the other hand, have just a
small fraction of the rate of diabetes seen in those who regularly eat
meat. As you can see in figure 1, as diets become increasingly plant
based, there appears to be a stepwise drop in diabetes rates.36 Based on
a study of eighty-nine thousand Californians, flexitarians appear to cut
their rate of diabetes by 28 percent, good news for those who eat meat
maybe once a week rather than every day. Those who cut out all meat
except fish appear to cut their rates in half. What about those
eliminating all meat, including fish? They appear to eliminate 61
percent of their risk. And those who go a step farther and drop eggs and
dairy foods too? They may drop their diabetes rates 78 percent compared
with people who eat meat on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Why would this be?</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Is it just because people eating plant-based diets are better able to
control their weight? Not entirely. Even at the same weight as regular
omnivores, vegans appear to have less than half the risk of diabetes.37
The explanation may lie in the difference between plant fats and animal
fats.</p>
<p>Saturated Fat and Diabetes</p>
<p>Not all fats affect our muscle cells in the same way. For example,
palmitate, the kind of saturated fat found mostly in meat, dairy, and
eggs, causes insulin resistance. On the other hand, oleate, the
monounsaturated fat found mostly in nuts, olives, and avocados, may
actually protect against the detrimental effects of the saturated fat.38
Saturated fats can wreak all sorts of havoc in muscle cells and may
result in the accumulation of more toxic breakdown products (such as
ceramide and diacylglycerol)39 and free radicals and can cause
inflammation and even mitochondrial dysfunction—that is, interference
with the little power plants (mitochondria) within our cells.40 This
phenomenon is known as lipotoxicity (lipo meaning fat, as in
liposuction).41 If we take muscle biopsies from people, saturated fat
buildup in the membranes of their muscle cells correlates with insulin
resistance.42 Monounsaturated fats, however, are more likely to be
detoxified by the body or safely stored away.43</p>
<p>This discrepancy may explain why individuals eating plant-based diets
are better protected from diabetes. Researchers have compared the
insulin resistance and muscle-fat content of vegans versus omnivores.
Because people eating plant-based diets have the advantage of being so
much slimmer on average, the researchers recruited omnivores who weighed
the same as the vegans they were studying so that they could see whether
plant-based diets had a direct effect beyond the indirect benefit of
pulling fat out of the muscles by helping people to lose weight.</p>
<p>The result? There was significantly less fat trapped in the deep calf
muscles of vegans than in those of comparably slim omnivores.44 Those
eating plant-based diets have been found to have better insulin
sensitivity, better blood sugar levels, better insulin levels,45 and
even significantly improved function of their beta cells—the cells in
the pancreas that produce insulin in the first place.46</p>
<p>In other words, people eating plant-based diets appear to be better
at both producing and using insulin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Preventing Diabetes by Eating More</p>
<p>Many population studies have shown that people who eat significant
amounts of legumes (e.g., beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils)
tend to weigh less. They also have slimmer waists, less obesity, and
lower blood pressure compared to people who don’t eat many legumes.47
But couldn’t these benefits be due not to the legumes themselves but to
the fact that people who eat more legumes may eat a healthier diet in
general? To tease out the connection, researchers used the most powerful
tool in nutrition research: the interventional trial. Instead of just
observing what people eat, you change their diets to see what happens.
In this case, they put legumes to the test by comparing extra legume
consumption head-to-head against calorie restriction.</p>
<p>Reducing belly fat may be the best way to prevent prediabetes from
turning into full-blown diabetes. Though calorie cutting has been the
cornerstone of most weight-loss strategies, evidence suggests that the
majority of individuals who lose weight by portion control eventually
regain it. Starving ourselves almost never works long term. So wouldn’t
it be great if instead we could find a way to eat more food to get the
same weight-loss benefit?</p>
<p>The researchers divided overweight subjects into two groups. The
first group was asked to eat five cups a week of lentils, chickpeas,
split peas, or navy beans—but not to change their diets in any other
way. The second group was asked to simply cut out five hundred calories
a day from their diets. Guess who got healthier? The group directed to
eat more food. Eating legumes was shown to be just as effective at
slimming waistlines and improving blood sugar control as calorie
cutting. The legume group also gained additional benefits in the form of
improved cholesterol and insulin regulation.48 This is encouraging news
for overweight individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes. Instead of just
eating smaller portions and reducing the quantity of the food they eat,
they can also improve the quality of their food by eating legume-rich
meals.</p>

<p>Saturated fats may also be toxic to the cells in the pancreas that
produce insulin. At around age twenty, the body stops making new
insulin-producing beta cells. After that, if they are lost, they may be
lost for good.49 Autopsy studies have shown that by the time type 2
diabetes is diagnosed later in life, you may have already killed off
half your beta cells.50</p>
<p>The toxicity of saturated fats can be demonstrated directly. If we
expose beta cells to saturated fat51 or to LDL (“bad”) cholesterol in a
petri dish, the beta cells begin to die.52 The same effect is not
observed with the monounsaturated fats concentrated in fatty plant
foods, such as nuts.53 When you eat saturated fat, both insulin action
and insulin secretion are impaired within hours.54 The more saturated
fat you have in your blood, the higher your risk may be for developing
type 2 diabetes.55</p>
<p>Of course, just as everyone who smokes doesn’t develop lung cancer,
everyone who eats excessive saturated fat doesn’t develop diabetes.
There is a genetic component. But for those who already have a genetic
predisposition, a diet with too many calories and rich in saturated fat
is considered a cause of type 2 diabetes.56</p>
<p>Losing Weight with a Plant-Based Diet</p>
<p>As noted earlier, even if you don’t eat extra fat, the extra fat you
wear may cause the spillover effect—the tendency for overstretched fat
cells to spill fat into the bloodstream. The advantage of a whole-food,
plant-based approach to weight loss is that there may be no need for
portion control, skipping meals, or counting calories, because most
plant foods are naturally nutrient dense and low in calories.</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Fruits and vegetables, on average, contain about 80–90 percent water.
Just as fiber can bulk up the volume of foods without adding calories,
so can water. Experiments have shown that people tend to eat the same
amount of food at a meal, regardless of calorie count—probably because
stretch receptors in the stomach send signals to the brain after a
certain volume of food has been ingested. When much of that volume is a
zero-calorie component like fiber or water, that means you can eat more
food but gain less weight.57</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the amounts of broccoli, tomatoes, and strawberries
that contain one hundred calories, compared with the quantities of one
hundred calories of chicken, cheese, and fish. You’ll notice that even
though the calorie content is the same, the volume of these foods is
different. So it makes sense that one hundred calories of the plants
would be more likely to fill you up, while the same one hundred calories
from animal or processed foods may leave you half-empty.</p>
<p>That’s why whole-food, plant-based diets are great for people who
like to eat, since you can basically eat as much as you want without
worrying about counting calories.</p>
<p>A head-to-head randomized clinical trial found that a plant-based
diet beat out the American Diabetes Association’s recommended diet for
weight loss. This occurred without restricting portions the subjects ate
and without requiring calorie or carb counting.58 Moreover, a review of
similar studies found that, in addition to weight loss, individuals
consuming plant-based meals experienced improved blood sugar control as
well as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease compared with people who
followed diets that included more animal products.59 Such are the
benefits of a plant-based diet.</p>
<p>Diabetics are more likely to suffer from strokes and heart failure.60
In fact, diabetic patients without a history of coronary heart disease
may have the same risk of heart attack as nondiabetic individuals with
confirmed heart disease.61 In addition to improving insulin sensitivity
better than conventional diabetic diets, the plant-based approach can
also lead to a significant drop in LDL cholesterol, thereby reducing
risk of the number-one killer of diabetics, heart disease.62 But how do
people feel about making such a major shift in their diets? As Dr. Dean
Ornish has quipped, are we all going to live longer, or is it just going
to seem longer?63</p>
<p>Apparently, most people who switch to a plant-based diet are happy
they did. One of the reasons there’s been such great compliance with
plant-based dietary interventions is that people not only tend to get
measurably better, they also tend to feel much better. In a recent
randomized, clinical weight-loss trial, diabetics were split into two
groups. Half were put on the conventional diabetic diet as recommended
by diabetes organizations; the other half were prescribed a plant-based
diet consisting mostly of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts.
At the end of six months, the plant-based group reported both a
significantly better quality of life and significantly higher mood
scores than those assigned to the conventional diet. Patients consuming
the plant-based diet also felt less constrained than those consuming the
conventional diet. Moreover, disinhibition decreased, meaning patients
eating vegetarian food were less likely to binge, and the plant-based
folks tended to feel less hungry as well—both of which could help these
subjects sustain this way of eating in the long run.64 So not only do
plant-based diets appear to work better but they may be easier to adopt
long term. And with the improvement in mood they seem to bring, there
may be benefits for both physical and mental health. (See chapter 12 for
more on this topic.)</p>
<p>When it comes to maximally lowering diabetes risk, does it matter if
you eat just a little meat? Researchers in Taiwan sought to answer that
question. Traditionally, Asian populations have enjoyed very low rates
of diabetes. In recent years, however, diabetes has emerged on a
near-epidemic scale, coinciding with the Westernization of Asian diets.
Rather than compare vegetarians to modern-day omnivores, these
researchers compared vegetarians to those eating a traditional Asian
diet, which customarily included very little fish and other meat. The
women ate the equivalent of just a single serving of meat each week,
while the men had a serving every few days.65</p>
<p>Both the vegetarian and traditional Asian diet groups were following
healthy diets, avoiding soda, for example. Despite the similarities in
diet among the four thousand study subjects and after accounting for
weight, family history, exercise, and smoking, the researchers found
that the vegetarian men had only half the odds of diabetes as the
occasional meat eaters. The vegetarian women had 75 percent lower odds
of diabetes. Those who avoided meat altogether appeared to have
significantly lower risk of both prediabetes and diabetes than those who
ate plant-based diets with an occasional serving of meat, including
fish. The researchers were unable to compare the diabetes rates of the
more than one thousand vegetarians in the study to the sixty-nine vegans
in the group, however, because the prevalence of diabetes among those
eating strictly plant-based was zero.66</p>
<hr />
<p>Diabetes-Promoting Pollutants</p>
<p>The dramatic rise in obesity has been blamed squarely on overeating
and inactivity. But could there be something else about the food we’re
eating that’s plumping us up? Scientists have begun identifying
“obesogenic” chemical pollutants released into the environment that may
disrupt your metabolism and predispose you to obesity. Contaminated food
is the main source of exposure to these chemicals, and 95 percent of
that exposure may come through the consumption of animal fat.67 What’s
the big deal? A nationwide study found that people with the highest
levels of pollutants in their bloodstreams had an astounding
thirty-eight times the odds of diabetes.68 Harvard University
researchers identified one chemical in particular, hexachlorobenzene, as
a potent risk factor for the disease.69</p>
<p>Where is this toxin found? Apparently, at the grocery store. In a
supermarket survey of a variety of foods, canned sardines were found to
be the most heavily tainted with hexachlorobenzene, though salmon was
found to be the most contaminated food overall. Two dozen pesticides
were detected in the salmon fillets.70 Farmed salmon may be the worst,
containing ten times more of a class of toxic chemicals called PCBs than
wild-caught salmon.71</p>
<p>Industrial toxins like hexachlorobenzene and PCBs were largely banned
decades ago. So how could they account for any of our increasing rates
of diabetes? The answer to this paradox may be our obesity epidemic. The
association between these toxic chemicals and diabetes was much stronger
among obese subjects than in lean subjects studied, raising the
possibility that your own fat stores are acting as reservoirs for these
pollutants.72 Overweight individuals may be effectively carrying around
a personal toxic waste dump on their hips. Without significant weight
loss, people whose bodies contain salmon pollutants may take between
fifty to seventy-five years to clear the chemicals from their
bodies.73</p>
<hr />
<p>Do those who avoid meat completely get enough nutrients? To find out,
researchers looked at a day in the life of thirteen thousand people all
across America. They compared the nutrient intake of those who ate meat
to those who didn’t. The study found that, calorie for calorie, those
eating vegetarian diets were getting higher intakes of nearly every
nutrient: more fiber, more vitamin A, more vitamin C, more vitamin E,
more of the B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, and folate, as well as more
calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Furthermore, many of the
nutrients that are so rich in plant-based diets are among the very ones
that most Americans normally don’t get enough of—namely, vitamins A, C,
E, not to mention fiber, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. At the same
time, people who avoided meat also ingested fewer harmful substances,
such as sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol.74</p>
<p>In terms of weight management, those eating meat-free diets consumed
an average of 364 fewer calories daily.75 That’s about what most people
on traditional weight-loss programs strive to cut out, meaning a
meatless diet could be considered an all-you-care-to-eat version of a
calorie-restricted weight-loss diet, without having to count calories or
restrict portion intake.</p>
<p>Those who eat plant-based diets may even have an 11 percent higher
resting metabolic rate.76 That means vegetarians could be burning more
calories even in their sleep. Why? This could be because vegetarians
have a higher gene expression of a fat-burning enzyme called carnitine
palmitoyltransferase, which effectively shovels fat into the
mitochondrial furnaces in your cells.77</p>
<p>So a calorie may not be a calorie when it comes to meat. A massive
study with an equally massive name, the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer–Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol,
Cessation of Smoking, Eating Out of Home, and Obesity—commonly known as
EPIC-PANACEA—was comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women who
were followed for years. It’s the largest study ever to investigate
eating meat and body weight, and it found that meat consumption was
associated with significant weight gain even after adjusting for
calories. This means that if you had two people eating the same number
of calories, it appears the person eating more meat would, on average,
gain significantly more weight.78</p>
<p>REVERSING DIABETES</p>
<p>What About Drugs and Surgery?</p>
<p>As noted earlier, those with type 2 diabetes are at elevated risk for
such serious health problems as heart disease, premature death,
blindness, kidney failure, and amputations, as well as fractures,
depression, and dementia. And the higher people’s blood sugar levels,
the more heart attacks and strokes they tend to have, the shorter their
life spans are, and the higher their risk of complications are. To see
if these outcomes could be averted, a study was performed in which ten
thousand diabetics were randomized into one of two groups, the standard
therapy group (in which the goal was just to lower blood sugar levels)
and an intensive blood-sugar-lowering group (in which the researchers
put the diabetics on up to five different classes of oral drugs at the
same time) with or without insulin injections. The goal was not just to
drive down blood sugars, as is the case with standard therapy, but to
drive them down consistently into the normal range.79</p>
<p>Considering that type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance,
high blood sugar is just a symptom of that disease, not the disease
itself. So even by artificially forcing down blood sugars by any means
necessary, we aren’t actually treating the cause—just like blood
pressure–lowering drugs aren’t actually treating the cause. By lowering
one of the disease’s effects, however, scientists hoped they could
prevent some of its devastating complications.</p>
<p>The results of this study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, sent shock waves through the medical community. The intensive
blood-sugar-lowering therapy actually increased subjects’ mortality,
requiring the researchers to halt the study prematurely for safety
reasons.80 The drug combinations may have been more dangerous than the
high blood sugars they were trying to treat.81</p>
<p>Insulin treatments themselves may accelerate aging, worsen diabetic
vision loss, and promote cancer, obesity, and atherosclerosis.82 Insulin
can promote inflammation in the arteries, which may help explain the
increased death rate in the intensively treated group.83 So rather than
trying to overcome insulin resistance by brute force—just pumping in
more and more insulin—isn’t it better to treat the disease itself by
eliminating the unhealthy diet that caused it? That reminds me of people
who undergo bypass surgery for clogged arteries. If they keep eating
unhealthfully, their bypasses will eventually get clogged too. It’s
better to treat the cause than the symptoms.</p>
<p>How about surgery for diabetes? Gastric bypass surgery—which
effectively reduces the size of the stomach by 90 percent or more—is one
of the most successful treatment methods for type 2 diabetes, with
reported long-term remission rates of up to 83 percent. These results
had led to the suggestion that gastric bypass surgery improves diabetes
by somehow altering digestive hormones, but this interpretation ignores
the fact that patients are placed on a severely limited diet for up to
two weeks following the procedure to recover from the surgery. Extreme
calorie restriction alone can reverse diabetes. So is the success of
surgery the result of the operation itself or due to the restrictive
diet?</p>
<p>Once again, researchers designed a study to uncover the answer.84
They compared diabetics placed on the same postoperative diet before and
after they actually had the surgery. Amazingly, they found that the diet
alone worked better than the surgery even in the same group of patients:
The subjects’ blood sugar control was better in the absence of the
operation. This means the benefits of major surgery may be obtained
without you ever having to go under the knife and getting your internal
organs rearranged.85</p>
<p>The bottom line: Blood sugar levels can normalize within a week of
eating six hundred calories daily, because fat is pulled out of the
muscles, liver, and pancreas, allowing them to function normally
again.86</p>
<p>This reversal of diabetes can be accomplished either by voluntary
calorie restriction87 or involuntarily, by having most of your stomach
removed, a form of compulsory food restriction. Undergoing surgery may
be easier than starving yourself, but major surgery carries major risks,
both during the operation and afterward. These risks include bleeding,
leakage, infections, erosions, herniation, and severe nutritional
deficiencies.88</p>
<p>Surgery or starvation? There’s got to be a better way, and, in fact,
there is. Instead of changing the quantity of food you eat, it’s
possible to reverse diabetes by changing the quality of that food.</p>
<hr />
<p>Does Eating Obesity Cause Obesity?</p>
<p>The EPIC-PANACEA study, which found that meat consumption is
associated with weight gain even independent of calories, identified
poultry as potentially the most fattening meat,89 a finding that has
since been confirmed in another study. Men and women eating even a
single ounce of chicken a day (think two chicken nuggets) had a
significantly greater gain in body mass index over the fourteen-year
follow-up period than those who consumed no chicken at all.90 Perhaps
this news shouldn’t be surprising, considering how fat chickens
themselves are now genetically manipulated to become.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about one hundred
years ago, a single serving of chicken may have contained only sixteen
fat calories. Nowadays, one serving of chicken may have more than two
hundred calories of fat. The fat content in poultry has ballooned from
less than two grams per serving a century ago to up to twenty-three
grams today. That’s ten times more fat. Chicken now contains two to
three times more calories from fat than from protein, leading nutrition
researchers to ask, “Does eating obesity cause obesity in the
consumer?”91 As the beef industry is proud of pointing out, even
skinless chicken can have more fat, and more artery-clogging saturated
fat, than a dozen different cuts of steak.92</p>
<hr />
<p>Reversing Diabetes with Food</p>
<p>We’ve known since the siege of Paris in 1870 that type 2 diabetes can
be reversed by an extreme reduction in food intake. Parisian doctors
documented how glucose disappeared from their patients’ urine after
people went weeks without food.93 Diabetes specialists have long known
that iron-willed patients who are able to lose up to one-fifth of their
body weight can reverse their diabetes and bring their metabolic
function back to normal.94</p>
<p>Instead of starving by eating less food, though, what if diabetics
just ate better food, as in a 90 percent or more plant-based diet of
all-you-can-eat greens, lots of other vegetables and beans, whole
grains, fruits, nuts, and seeds? In a pilot study, thirteen diabetic men
and women were told to eat at least one big salad every day, as well as
veggie-bean soup, a handful of nuts and seeds, fruit at every meal, a
pound of cooked greens, and some whole grains; to restrict their animal
product consumption; and to eliminate refined grains, junk food, and
oil. Then, the researchers measured their hemoglobin A1c levels,
considered the best measure of how poorly blood sugars have been
controlled over time.</p>
<p>At the onset of the study, the diabetics had A1c levels averaging
8.2. An A1c level under 5.7 is considered normal, between 5.7 and 6.4 is
considered prediabetic, and above 6.5 is considered diabetic. However,
the American Diabetes Association’s target is just to get most diabetics
down below 7.0.95 (Recall that intensive blood-sugar-lowering trials
using drugs, which tried to push A1c levels under 6.0, unfortunately
ended up pushing many diabetics six feet under.)</p>
<p>After about seven months of eating a diet centered on whole plant
foods, the subjects’ A1c levels dropped to a nondiabetic 5.8—and this
was after they were able to stop taking most of their medications.96
We’ve known diabetes can be reversed with an extremely low-calorie
diet.97 Now we know that it can also be reversed with an extremely
healthy diet, but is that because it was also low in calories? The study
subjects lost about as much weight on the vegetable-packed, plant-based
diet as people who went on semistarvation diets based on liquid meal
replacements.98 But even if this type of diabetes reversal was just
about calorie restriction, which would be healthier? Subsisting on
mostly diet shakes made out of sugar, powdered milk, corn syrup, and
oil, or eating a plant-based diet where you can enjoy real food and lots
of it?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, even participants who temporarily didn’t lose weight on
the plant-based diet, or who actually gained weight, still appeared to
improve their diabetes. In other words, the beneficial effects of
plant-based diets may extend beyond weight loss.99 However, the study
described just a handful of people, had no control group, and included
only those who could stick to the eating plan. To prove plant-based
diets could actually improve diabetes independent of weight loss,
researchers would need to design a study in which they switched people
to a healthy diet but forced them to eat so much that they didn’t lose
any weight.</p>
<p>Just such a study was published more than thirty-five years ago. Type
2 diabetics were placed on a plant-based diet and weighed every day. If
they started losing any weight, they were made to eat more food—so much
that some of the participants actually had trouble eating it all! The
result: Even with no weight loss, subjects on the plant-based diet saw
their insulin requirements cut by about 60 percent, meaning the amount
of insulin these diabetics had to inject dropped by more than half.
Furthermore, half of the diabetics were able to get off insulin
altogether, despite no change in body weight—just by eating a healthier
diet.100</p>
<p>This wasn’t over the course of months or years, either. This was
after eating a plant-based diet for an average of only sixteen days.
Some of the subjects had been diabetic for two decades and had been
injecting twenty units of insulin a day. Yet within two weeks of eating
a plant-based diet, they were off insulin altogether. One patient was on
thirty-two units of insulin per day at the onset of the study. After
eighteen days, his blood sugar levels plummeted so low that insulin
injections were no longer necessary. Even at approximately the same body
weight, he had lower blood sugars on a plant-based diet using no insulin
than when he had been on a regular diet using thirty-two units of
insulin daily.101 That’s the power of plants.</p>
<p>Curing Diabetic Neuropathy</p>
<p>Up to 50 percent of diabetics eventually develop neuropathy, or
damage to their nerves.102 Neuropathy can be very painful, and that pain
is frequently resistant to conventional treatments. No medical treatment
is considered effective for the condition.103 We doctors are left with
only steroids, opiates, and antidepressants to try to ease our patients’
suffering. But then a remarkable study was published, entitled
“Regression of Diabetic Neuropathy with Total Vegetarian (Vegan) Diet.”
Twenty-one diabetics who had been suffering from painful neuropathy for
up to ten years were placed on a whole-food, plant-based diet. After
years and years of suffering, seventeen out of the twenty-one patients
reported that they felt complete relief from their pain—within days.
Their numbness noticeably improved too. And the side effects were all
good: The diabetics lost an average of ten pounds, their blood sugar
levels dropped, their insulin needs dropped in half, and, in five of the
patients, not only was their painful neuropathy cured, so was,
apparently, their diabetes. After having been diabetic for up to twenty
years, they were off all blood sugar drugs in less than a month.104</p>
<p>On top of that, the diabetics’ triglyceride and cholesterol levels
improved on average as well. High blood pressures dropped by so much
that half of the subjects also appeared cured of their hypertension.
Within three weeks, the subjects’ need for high blood pressure
medications dropped by 80 percent.105 (This is why it is critically
important to work with your doctor when radically improving your diet,
because if they don’t reduce or eliminate your medications accordingly,
your blood sugar levels or blood pressure may drop too low.)</p>
<p>We’ve long known that plant-based diets can reverse diabetes106 and
hypertension,107 but reversing nerve damage pain with diet was new.</p>
<p>This study involved a live-in program in which patients were provided
meals. What happened after they were sent home, back into the real
world? These seventeen subjects were followed for years, and in all
cases but one, the relief from their painful neuropathy continued—or
improved even further. How were the researchers able to achieve such a
high degree of dietary compliance even in an uncontrolled setting? “Pain
and ill health,” the researchers wrote, “are strong motivating
factors.”108 In other words: Because plant-based diets work.</p>
<p>Think about it. Patients walk in with one of the most painful,
frustrating, and hard-to-treat conditions in all of medicine, and
three-quarters of them were cured in a handful of days using a natural,
nontoxic treatment—namely, a diet composed of whole plant foods. This
should have been front-page news.</p>
<p>How could nerve damage pain be reversed so suddenly? It didn’t appear
to involve the improvement in blood sugar control. It took approximately
ten days for the diet to control the diabetes itself, but the pain was
gone in as few as four days.109</p>
<p>The most interesting speculation was that trans fats naturally found
in meat and dairy could be causing an inflammatory response in the
patients’ bodies. The researchers found that a significant percentage of
the fat under the skin of those who ate meat, or even just dairy and
eggs, was composed of trans fats, whereas those who had been on a
strictly whole-food, plant-based diet had no detectable trans fat in
their tissues.110</p>
<p>The researchers stuck needles into the buttocks of subjects who had
been eating different diets and discovered that people who had been on a
whole-food, plant-based diet for nine months or more appeared to have
removed all the trans fat from their bodies (or at least from their
butts!).111 But their neuropathy pain didn’t take nine months to get
better. It improved in closer to nine days. It’s more likely that this
amazing reversal was due to an improvement in blood flow.112</p>
<p>Nerves contain tiny blood vessels that may become clogged, depriving
the nerves of oxygen. Indeed, biopsies of leg nerves in diabetics with
severe progressive neuropathy have shown arterial disease within the
sural nerve in the leg.113 However, within days of eating healthier
meals, blood flow may improve to the extent that neuropathy
disappears.114 Within an average of two years of eating a plant-based
diet composed mostly of rice and fruits, even diabetic vision loss can
be reversed in as many as 30 percent of patients.115</p>
<p>So why didn’t I learn about any of this in medical school? There’s
little money to be made from prescribing plants instead of pills. The
neuropathy pain reversal study was published more than twenty years ago,
and the blindness reversal studies more than fifty years ago. As one
commentator wrote, “The neglect of this important work by the broader
medical community is little short of unconscionable.”116</p>
<hr />
<p>WHtR Versus BMI</p>
<p>The body mass index (BMI) is a better predictor of disease than body
weight alone, as BMI takes height into account. But BMI has long been
criticized for not considering the location or the nature of your
weight. Bodybuilders, for instance, have extremely low body fat but can
have off-the-chart BMIs, because muscle is heavier than fat.</p>
<p>Today, it’s generally accepted that health risks can be determined as
much by the relative distribution of body fat as by its total amount.117
What’s the worst kind? Abdominal fat—the kind that builds up around your
internal organs. Having a potbelly may be a strong predictor of
premature death.118</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>Both the men in figure 3 have the same BMI, but the distribution of
weight is different. People with the so-called apple shape, with body
fat concentrated in the abdominal region, may have the lowest life
expectancy.119</p>
<p>Fortunately, there may be an even better tool than BMI that we can
use to gauge the health risks of body fat. It’s called Waist-to-Height
Ratio, or WHtR.120 Instead of a scale, grab a simple measuring tape.
Stand up straight and take a deep breath, exhale, and let it all hang
out. The circumference of your belly (halfway between the top of your
hip bones and the bottom of your rib cage) should be half your
height—ideally, less. If that measurement is more than half your height,
it’s time to start eating healthier and exercising more regardless of
your weight.121</p>
<hr />
<p>Type 2 diabetes in the United States is reaching epidemic
proportions. The CDC estimates that 37 percent of U.S. adults—and 51
percent of adults over sixty-five—have prediabetes. That’s eighty-six
million people,122 most of whom will become full-blown diabetics.123 But
type 2 diabetes can be prevented, arrested, and even reversed with a
healthy-enough diet. Unfortunately, doctors don’t tend to educate their
patients about diabetes prevention. Only about one in three prediabetic
patients reports ever being told by their doctors to exercise or to
improve their diets.124 Possible reasons for not counseling patients
include a lack of insurance reimbursement for the extra time spent, a
lack of resources, a lack of time, and a lack of knowledge.125 We’re
just not training doctors how to empower the people they serve.</p>
<p>The current medical education system has yet to adapt to the great
transformation of disease from acute to chronic. Medicine is no longer
about just setting broken bones or curing strep throat. Such chronic
diseases as diabetes are now the principal cause of death and disability
in America, consuming three-quarters of the nation’s health care budget.
Medical education has yet to recognize and respond to the changing
nature of disease patterns, which now requires a focus on prevention and
lifestyle change.126 How far behind the times is the medical profession?
A report by the Institute of Medicine on medical training concluded that
the fundamental approach to medical education has not changed since
1910.127</p>
<p>Not long ago, I received an e-mail that helps sum up where we are.
Tonah, a sixty-five-year-old Native American, had been on insulin for
type 2 diabetes for the last twenty-seven years. He was told by his
doctor that Native Americans were “genetically predisposed” to the
disease. He just had to live with it, including the excruciating nerve
pain, three heart stents, and erectile dysfunction. After watching my
“Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death” video on NutritionFacts.org, his
granddaughter convinced him to try a plant-based diet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy, since the nearest store with fresh food was fifty
miles away. Nevertheless, in less than two weeks, he turned his life
around. His nerve pain diminished dramatically, to the point where it no
longer kept him up at night. He lost thirty pounds in a matter of months
and no longer needed insulin. His own doctor couldn’t believe this was
possible and ordered a CT scan to check for tumors. There weren’t any.
Now he feels better than he has in years.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful that my granddaughter has stopped seeing me as a sick
old man,” Tonah concluded his note. “I feel young again, Doc.”</p>
