<h4 id="chapter-5-how-not-to-die-from-infections">CHAPTER 5 How Not to
Die from Infections</h4>
<p>I was still in medical school when I got a call to help defend Oprah
Winfrey, who was being sued by a cattle rancher under a Texas
food-disparagement law (thirteen states have so-called food-libel laws
that make it illegal to make a comment that unfairly “implies that [a]
perishable food product is not safe for consumption by the
public”1).</p>
<p>Oprah had been talking on her television show with Howard Lyman, a
former fourth-generation cattle rancher who decried the cannibalistic
feeding of cow parts to other cows, a risky practice blamed for the
emergence and spread of mad cow disease. Repulsed by the thought, Oprah
told the viewing audience, “It has just stopped me cold from eating
another burger.” The next day, cattle futures tumbled, and the Texas
cattleman claimed to have lost millions.</p>
<p>My job was to help establish that Lyman’s comments were “based on
reasonable and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or data.”2 Despite
the ease with which we did just that, not to mention the blatant
violation of First Amendment protections inherent in the law, the Texas
cattleman was able to tie Oprah up in a long and harrowing appeals
process. Finally, five years later, a federal judge dismissed the case
with prejudice, ending Oprah’s ordeal.</p>
<p>In a narrow legal sense, she won. But if the meat industry is able to
drag one of the country’s richest and most powerful people through the
courts for years and cost her a small fortune in legal fees, what kind
of chilling effect does that have on others who want to speak out? Now
the meat industry is trying to pass so-called ag-gag laws, which make it
illegal to take pictures inside their operations. Presumably, they fear
people might be less inclined to buy their products if they knew how
these products are made.3</p>
<p>Thankfully, humanity dodged a bullet with mad cow disease. Nearly an
entire generation in Britain was exposed to infected beef, but only a
few hundred people died. We weren’t as lucky with swine flu, which the
CDC estimates killed twelve thousand Americans.4 Nearly three-quarters
of all emerging and reemerging human diseases arise from the animal
kingdom.5</p>
<p>Humanity’s dominion over animals has unleashed a veritable Pandora’s
ark of infectious diseases. Most modern human infectious diseases were
unknown before domestication led to a mass spillover of animal disease
into human populations.6 For example, tuberculosis appears to have been
originally acquired through the domestication of goats7 but now infects
nearly one-third of humanity.8 Meanwhile, measles9 and smallpox10 may
have arisen from mutant cattle viruses. We domesticated pigs and got
whooping cough, we domesticated chickens and got typhoid fever, and we
domesticated ducks and got influenza.11 Leprosy may have come from water
buffalo and the cold virus from horses.12 How often did wild horses have
the opportunity to sneeze into humans’ faces until they were broken and
bridled? Before then, the common cold was presumably common only to
them.</p>
<p>Once pathogens jump the species barrier, they can then transmit
person-to-person. HIV, a virus thought to have originated from the
butchering of primates in Africa for the bush-meat trade,13 causes AIDS
by weakening the immune system. The opportunistic fungal, viral, and
bacterial infections AIDS patients contract—but to which healthy people
are resistant—demonstrate the importance of baseline immune function.
Your immune system is not just active when you’re lying in bed sick
spiking a fever—it’s involved in a daily life-or-death struggle to save
your life from the pathogens that surround and live inside you.</p>
<p>With every breath you take, you inhale thousands of bacteria,14 and
with every bite you eat, you can ingest millions more.15 Most of these
tiny germs are completely harmless, but some can cause serious
infectious diseases, occasionally making headlines with
sinister-sounding names like SARS or Ebola. Although many of these
exotic pathogens receive a lot of press coverage, more lives are lost to
some of our most common infections. For example, such respiratory
infections as influenza and pneumonia kill nearly fifty-seven thousand
Americans each year.16</p>
<p>Bear in mind that you don’t need to come in contact with a sick
person to fall ill with an infection. There are latent infections that
may exist within you, waiting to strike should your immune function
falter. That is why it’s not enough to just wash your hands; you have to
keep your immune system healthy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Protecting Others</p>
<p>To protect others when you’re sick, you need to practice good
respiratory etiquette by coughing or sneezing into the crook of your arm
(into your bent elbow). This practice limits the dispersal of
respiratory droplets and also avoids contaminating your hands. The Mayo
Clinic has a slogan worth remembering: “The ten worst sources of
contagion are our fingers.” When you cough into your hand, you can
transfer contagion to everything from elevator buttons and light
switches to gas pumps and toilet handles.17 It’s no surprise that during
flu season, the influenza virus can be found on more than 50 percent of
common household and day-care-center surfaces.18</p>
<p>Ideally, you should sanitize your hands after every bathroom visit
and handshake, before all food preparation, and before touching your
eyes, nose, or mouth after coming in contact with public surfaces. The
latest recommendations from the World Health Organization favor the use
of alcohol-based sanitizing rubs or gels over hand washing for routine
disinfection of your hands throughout the day. (Products containing
between 60 and 80 percent alcohol were found to be more effective than
soap in every scientific study available for review.) The only time hand
washing is preferable is when they are dirty or visibly contaminated
with bodily fluids. For routine decontamination—that is, for all other
times—alcohol-based products are the preferred method for hand
sanitation.19</p>
<p>Still, some germs will always get past your first line of defense of
practicing good hand hygiene. This is why you need to keep your immune
system functioning at peak performance with a healthy diet and
lifestyle.</p>
<hr />
<p>PREVENTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES WITH A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM</p>
<p>The term “immune system” is derived from the Latin word immunis,
meaning untaxed or untouched, which is fitting, given that the immune
system protects the body from foreign invaders. Composed of various
organs, white blood cells, and proteins called antibodies that form
alliances against trespassing pathogens threatening the body, the immune
system, apart from the nervous system, is the most complex organ system
humans possess.20</p>
<p>Your first layer of protection against intruders are physical surface
barriers like your skin. Beneath that are white blood cells, such as
neutrophils that attack and engulf pathogens directly, and natural
killer cells that put your cells out of their misery if they become
cancerous or infected with a virus. How do natural killer cells
recognize pathogens and infected cells? They are often marked for
destruction by antibodies, which are special proteins made by another
type of white blood cell, known as B cells, that home in like smart
bombs and stick to invaders.</p>
<p>Each B cell makes one type of antibody that’s specific for one
foreign molecular signature. You don’t have one B cell that covers grass
pollen and another that covers bacteria; instead, you have a B cell
whose only job is to make antibodies against the pollen of purple
Siberian onion grass and another whose only job is to make antibodies
against the tail proteins of bacteria that live in the thermal vents at
the bottom of the ocean. If each of your B cells produces only one type
of antibody, then you’d need to have a billion different types of B
cells given the incredible variety of potential pathogens on our planet.
And you do!</p>
<p>Let’s suppose one day you’re walking along and suddenly get attacked
by a platypus (they have poisonous spurs on their heels, you know). For
your whole life up until that point, the B cell in your body that
produces antibodies against duck-billed platypus venom was just hanging
around, twiddling its thumbs, until that very moment. As soon as the
venom is detected, this specific B cell begins dividing like crazy, and
soon you have a whole swarm of clones each producing millions of
antibodies against platypus poison. You fend off the toxin and live
happily ever after. That is how the immune system works—aren’t our
bodies spectacular?</p>
<p>As you get older, though, your immune function declines. Is this just
an inevitable consequence of aging? Or could it be because dietary
quality also tends to go down in older populations? To test the theory
that inadequate nutrition could help explain the loss in immune function
as you age, researchers split eighty-three volunteers between sixty-five
and eighty-five years old into two groups. The control group ate fewer
than three daily servings of fruits and vegetables, while the
experimental group consumed at least five servings a day. They were all
then vaccinated against pneumonia, a practice recommended for all adults
over the age of sixty-five.21 The goal of vaccination is to prime your
immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pneumonia
pathogen should you ever become exposed. Compared with the control
group, people eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables had
an 82 percent greater protective antibody response to the vaccine—and
this was after only a few months of eating just a few extra servings of
fruits and vegetables a day.22 That is how much control the fork may
exert over immune function.</p>
<p>Certain fruits and vegetables may give the immune function an extra
boost.</p>
<p>Kale</p>
<p>Americans eat far too little kale. According to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, the average American may consume about 0.05 pounds of
kale each year.23 That’s about one and a half cups per person … per
decade.</p>
<p>As a dark-green, leafy vegetable, kale is not only one of the most
nutrient-dense foods on the planet—it may also help fight off infection.
Japanese researchers tried dripping a minute quantity of kale on human
white blood cells in a petri dish, about one-millionth of a gram of kale
protein. Even that miniscule quantity triggered a quintupling of
antibody production in the cells.24</p>
<p>The researchers used raw kale, but the scant amounts of kale
Americans consume are often cooked. Does cooking kale destroy its
immune-boosting effects? It turned out that even boiling the veggies
nonstop for thirty minutes did not affect antibody production. In fact,
the cooked kale appeared to work even better.25</p>
<p>However, this property was discovered in a test-tube study. Even kale
aficionados don’t mainline it like heroin, which is presumably the only
way intact kale proteins would ever come in direct contact with our
blood cells. No clinical studies (that is, studies on real people) on
kale have been performed to date. Big Kale, it seems, has yet to muster
the research dollars. Currently, we have stronger evidence for the
immune benefits of kale’s less pretentious cousin, broccoli.</p>
<p>Broccoli</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned, your body’s greatest exposure to the outside world
is through the lining of your intestines, which may cover more than two
thousand square feet,26 which is about the floor area of an average
house.27 But the lining is extremely thin—just fifty-millionths of a
meter. In other words, the barrier separating your bloodstream from the
world is many times thinner than a single sheet of tissue paper. This is
because the body needs to absorb nutrients from food: If the gut lining
were any thicker, nutrients would have trouble passing through. It’s a
good idea for your skin to be waterproof so you don’t start leaking, but
the lining of the gut has to allow for the absorption of both fluids and
nutrition. With such a fragile layer between your sterile core and the
chaos outside, you need to have a good defense mechanism in place to
keep out the bad.</p>
<p>This is where the immune system comes in, specifically a special type
of white blood cell called intraepithelial lymphocytes. These cells
serve two functions: They condition and repair the thin intestinal
lining, and they also serve as its first line of gut defense against
pathogens.28 These lymphocytes are covered with “Ah receptors” that
activate the cells.29 For years, scientists couldn’t find the key that
fit into the Ah receptor lock. If we could figure out how to activate
these cells, we might be able to boost our immunity.30</p>
<p>It turns out that key is contained in broccoli.</p>
<p>You may have been taught as a kid to eat your veggies, including
cruciferous ones like broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, and brussels
sprouts. But your parents probably didn’t tell you why you should eat
them. Now we know that this family of vegetables contains compounds
necessary for the maintenance of the body’s intestinal defenses. In
short, broccoli is able to rally your immune system foot soldiers.31</p>
<p>Why did our immune systems evolve to depend on certain vegetables?
Well, when do we need to boost our intestinal defenses? When we eat. The
body uses up a lot of energy to maintain its immune system, so why
remain on high alert 24-7 when we only eat a few times a day? Why would
our bodies specifically use vegetables as the bat signal to assemble the
troops? We evolved over millions of years eating mostly weeds—wild
plants, including dark-green, leafy vegetables (or, as they were known
back then, leaves)—so our bodies may have evolved to equate vegetables
with mealtime. Vegetables’ presence in the gut works as a signal to
upkeep our immune systems.32 So if we don’t eat plants with each meal,
we may be undermining our bodies’ strategy to protect us.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the immune boost provided by cruciferous vegetables
like broccoli not only protects us against the pathogens found in food
but also against pollutants in the environment. We’re all constantly
being exposed to a wide range of toxic substances—from cigarette smoke,
car exhaust, furnaces, cooked meat, fish, dairy, and even from mother’s
milk33 (as a consequence of what the mother was exposed to). Because
some of these pollutants, such as dioxins, exert their toxic effects
through the Ah receptor system, cruciferous compounds may block
them.34</p>
<p>Other plants may also defend against toxic invaders. Researchers in
Japan found that phytonutrients in such plant foods as fruits,
vegetables, tea leaves, and beans can block the effects of dioxins in
vitro. For instance, the researchers found that having phytonutrient
levels in the bloodstream achieved by eating three apples a day or a
tablespoon of red onion appeared to cut dioxin toxicity in half. The
only catch was that these phytonutrient effects lasted only a few hours,
meaning you may have to keep eating healthy foods, meal after meal, if
you want to maintain your defenses against pathogens as well as
pollutants.35</p>
<p>The ability to block toxins isn’t limited to plant foods, however.
There is one animal product that has also been shown to potentially
block the cancer-causing effects of dioxins—camel urine.36 So next time
your kids don’t want to eat their fruits and veggies, you can just say,
“Hey, it’s either the broccoli or camel pee. Your choice.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Pretty in Pee-nk</p>
<p>Ever noticed that your urine turns a bit pink after you eat beets?
Though the color looks a little unnatural, it’s a completely harmless
and temporary condition called beeturia.37 It’s a vivid reminder of an
important fact: When you eat plant foods, many of the pigment
phytonutrients that act as antioxidants in your body (such as lycopene
and beta-carotene) are absorbed into the bloodstream and bathe your
organs, tissues, and cells.</p>
<p>In other words, beet pigments find their way into your urine because
they are absorbed through the gut and then travel into the bloodstream,
where they circulate throughout the body until eventually being filtered
out by the kidneys. During this trip through the body, even your blood
becomes a bit pinker too.</p>
<p>The same principle causes garlic breath. It isn’t just the residue in
your mouth that’s scaring everyone off; it’s also the health-promoting
compounds that were absorbed into your bloodstream after you swallowed
the garlic, which are then exhaled pungently from your lungs in your
breath. Even if you just had a garlic enema, you’d still get garlic
breath. For this reason, garlic can potentially be used as an adjunct
treatment for critical cases of pneumonia, as it may help clear bacteria
on its way out of the lungs.38</p>
<hr />
<p>Boosting Natural Killer Cell Activity with Berries</p>
<p>For disease prevention, berries of all colors have “emerged as
champions,” according to the head of the Bioactive Botanical Research
Laboratory.39 The purported anticancer properties of berry compounds
have been attributed to their apparent ability to counteract, reduce,
and repair damage resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation.40
But it wasn’t known until recently that berries may also boost your
levels of natural killer cells.</p>
<p>They may sound sinister, but natural killer cells are a type of white
blood cell that’s a vital member of the immune system’s rapid-response
team against virus-infected and cancerous cells. They’re called natural
killers because they don’t require prior exposure to a disease to be
activated, unlike some other parts of the immune system that can only
respond effectively after a history of exposure, as in the case of, say,
chicken pox.41 After all, you don’t want to wait until your second tumor
appears before your immune system starts fighting.</p>
<p>There are about two billion of these elite, special-ops fighters
patrolling the bloodstream at any one time, but research suggests that
you can bolster their ranks by eating blueberries. In one study,
researchers asked athletes to eat about a cup and a half of blueberries
every day for six weeks to see if the berries could reduce the oxidative
stress caused by long-distance running.42 The blueberries succeeded,
unsurprisingly, but a more important finding was their effect on natural
killer cells. Normally, these cells decrease in number after a bout of
prolonged endurance exercise, dropping by half to about one billion. But
the athletes consuming blueberries actually doubled their killer cell
counts, to more than four billion.</p>
<p>Blueberries can boost the number of natural killer cells, but are
there any foods that can boost killer cell activity—that is, how
effectively they fight cancer cells? Yes, it seems an aromatic spice
called cardamom may be one. Researchers put some lymphoma cells in a
petri dish and added natural killer cells, which were able to wipe out
about 5 percent of the cancer cells. But after researchers effectively
sprinkled on some cardamom, the natural killer cells became supercharged
and eradicated even more cancer cells—up to about ten times more than
without cardamom.43 No clinical trials have yet been done to try this
out in cancer patients.</p>
<p>In theory, though, cardamom-infused blueberry muffins may increase
the number of circulating natural killer cells in the body, as well as
boost their cancer-killing instincts.</p>
<p>Preventing the Common Cold with Probiotics?</p>
<p>Babies delivered via cesarean section appear to be at increased risk
for various allergic diseases, including allergic runny nose, asthma,
and perhaps even food allergies.44 (Allergy symptoms are caused when
your immune system overreacts to normally harmless stimuli, such as tree
pollen.) Normal delivery leads to the colonization of the baby’s gut
with the mother’s vaginal bacteria. C-section babies, on the other hand,
are deprived of this natural exposure. The resulting difference in gut
flora may affect the way the baby’s immune system develops, accounting
for the difference in allergy rates. This explanation is supported by
research showing that a disturbance in a mother’s vaginal flora during
pregnancy due, for example, to sexually transmitted infections or
douching may result in higher asthma risk for the infant.45</p>
<p>These findings raise a broader question about the effects the good
bacteria in the gut may have on the immune system. Some studies have
shown that supplementing with good bacteria (probiotics) might have
immunity-enhancing effects. The first such study demonstrated that white
blood cells extracted from subjects on a probiotic regimen for a few
weeks demonstrated a significantly enhanced ability to engulf and
destroy potential invaders. This effect lasted for at least three weeks
after the probiotics were discontinued. Natural killer cell activity
against cancer cells in vitro was improved as well.46</p>
<p>Improving cell function in a petri dish is nice, but do these results
translate into fewer infections? It took another ten years before a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed.
(Considered the gold standard of research, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study is a trial in which neither the participants
nor the researchers know who is receiving an experimental treatment and
who is receiving a placebo until the end of the study.) The study showed
that people who take probiotic supplements may indeed have significantly
fewer colds, fewer sick days, and fewer overall symptoms.47 The evidence
to date suggests probiotics may reduce the risk of
upper-respiratory-tract infections but is insufficient for recommending
that people start popping probiotic pills.48</p>
<p>Unless you’ve suffered a major disruption in gut flora due to a
course of antibiotics or an intestinal infection, it may be best to
focus on feeding the good bacteria already living in your gut.49 What do
your friendly flora eat? Fiber and a certain type of starch concentrated
in beans. These substances are called prebiotics. Probiotics are the
good bacteria themselves, whereas prebiotics are what your good bacteria
eat. So the best way to keep your good bacteria happy and well fed is to
eat lots of whole plant foods.</p>
<p>When you eat fresh produce, you can get both pre- and probiotics into
your gut. Fruits and veggies are covered with millions of lactic acid
bacteria, some of which are the same types used in probiotic
supplements. When you make sauerkraut, for example, you don’t need to
add a starter culture, because the bacteria are already naturally
present on cabbage leaves. Including raw fruits and vegetables in your
daily diet may therefore offer the best of both worlds.50</p>
<p>Boosting the Immune System with Exercise</p>
<p>What if there were a drug or supplement that could halve the number
of sick days you take due to such upper-respiratory infections as the
common cold? It would make some pharmaceutical company billions of
dollars. But there is already something that can boost your immune
system for free and by so much that you can achieve a 25–50 percent
reduction in sick days. And it has only good side effects. What is
it?</p>
<p>Exercise.51</p>
<p>What’s more, it doesn’t take much of a workout to get results.
Studies find that if you let kids run around for just six minutes, the
levels of immune cells circulating in their blood increases by nearly 50
percent.52 At the other end of the life cycle, regular exercise can also
help prevent age-related immune decline. One study found that while
elderly, sedentary women have a 50 percent chance of getting an
upper-respiratory illness during the fall season, those randomized to
begin a half-hour-a-day walking program dropped their risk down to 20
percent. Among conditioned runners, though, the risk was just 8
percent.53 Exercising appeared to make their immune systems more than
five times better at fighting infection.</p>
<p>So what’s going on here? How does the simple act of moving decrease
the chance of contracting an infection? Approximately 95 percent of all
infections start in the mucosal (moist) surfaces, including the eyes,
nostrils, and mouth.54 These surfaces are protected by antibodies called
IgA (short for immunoglobulin, type A), which provide an immunological
barrier by neutralizing and preventing viruses from penetrating into the
body. The IgA in saliva, for instance, is considered the first line of
defense against such respiratory-tract infections as pneumonia and
influenza.55 Moderate exercise may be all it takes to boost IgA levels
and significantly reduce the chance of coming down with flu-like
symptoms. Compared to a sedentary control group, those who performed
aerobic exercises for thirty minutes three times a week for twelve weeks
had a 50 percent increase in the levels of IgA in their saliva and
reported significantly fewer respiratory infection symptoms.56</p>
<p>While regular physical activity improves immune function and lowers
respiratory infection risk, sustained and intense exertion may have the
opposite effect. As you go from inactive to active, infection risk
declines, but at a certain point, overtraining and excessive stress can
increase the risk of infection by impairing immune function.57 In the
weeks following marathons or ultramarathons, runners report a two- to
sixfold increase in upper-respiratory-tract infections.58 Within a day
of starting an international competition, elite soccer players were
found to suffer a significant drop in their IgA production.59 This drop
has been tied to upper-respiratory-tract infections during training.
Other studies have found that IgA levels can drop after even just single
bouts of overstrenuous exercise.60</p>
<p>What can you do, then, if you’re a hard-core athlete? How can you
reduce your chance of infection? Traditional sports medicine
recommendations don’t appear to have much to offer: They’ll tell you to
get a flu shot, avoid touching your eyes or picking your nose, and stay
away from sick people.61 Gee, thanks. The reason these steps may be
insufficient is that respiratory infections are often triggered by
reactivations of latent viruses already inside the body, such as
Epstein-Barr virus, the cause of mononucleosis. So even if you never
came in contact with anyone else, as soon as your immune function dips,
these dormant viruses can return and make you sick.</p>
<p>Thankfully, a number of foods may help maintain your immunity to keep
the germs at bay.</p>
<p>First up is chlorella, a single-celled, freshwater, green algae
typically sold as a powder or compressed into tablets. Researchers in
Japan were the first to show that mothers given chlorella saw increased
IgA concentrations in their breast milk.62 Although chlorella extract
supplements failed to boost overall immune function,63 there is evidence
that whole algae may be effective. In a study out of Japan in 2012,
researchers rounded up athletes ripe for infection during the middle of
training camp. Among the control group, who received no supplements, IgA
levels dropped significantly during intense exercise. But among those
who were given chlorella, IgA levels remained steady.64</p>
<p>One note of caution: A disturbing case report from Omaha, Nebraska,
was published recently, entitled “Chlorella-Induced Psychosis.”65 A
forty-eight-year-old woman suffered a psychotic break two months after
starting to take chlorella. Her physicians told her to stop it and put
her on an antipsychotic drug. One week later, she was fine. Chlorella
had never before been linked to psychosis, so they initially presumed it
was just a fluke. In other words, the psychosis may have just
coincidentally begun after the woman started taking chlorella, and the
reason she felt better after stopping it may have just been due to the
drug kicking in. But seven weeks later, she was still on the drug and
had restarted taking chlorella—and she became psychotic again. The
chlorella was stopped, and her psychosis resolved again.66 Perhaps it
wasn’t the chlorella itself that triggered the episode but some toxic
impurity or adulteration. We don’t know. Given the scandalously
ill-regulated supplement market, it’s hard to know what you’re getting
when you try to buy “food” in supplement bottles.</p>
<p>Another option for athletes who want to sustain their immune function
is nutritional yeast. A 2013 study reported that you may more
effectively maintain your levels of white blood cells after exercise by
consuming a special type of fiber found in baker’s, brewer’s, and
nutritional yeast.67 Brewer’s yeast is bitter, but nutritional yeast has
a pleasant, cheese-like flavor. It tastes particularly good on
popcorn.</p>
<p>The study found that after two hours of intense cycling, the number
of monocytes (another type of immune system white blood cell) in
subjects’ bloodstreams took a dip. But those who were given the
equivalent of about three-quarters of a teaspoon of nutritional yeast
before they exercised ended up with even higher levels of monocytes than
when they started working out.68</p>
<p>That’s all well and good on a lab report, but does consuming yeast
fiber actually translate to fewer illnesses? Researchers put that
question to the test at the Carlsbad Marathon in California.</p>
<p>Runners who were given the daily equivalent of about a spoonful of
nutritional yeast in the four weeks after the race appeared to have just
half the rates of upper-respiratory infection compared to runners
consuming a placebo. Remarkably, the runners on yeast reported feeling
better too. When asked how they felt on a scale of one to ten, with ten
being the best, the people taking the placebo reported about a four or
five. On the other hand, the subjects on the nutritional yeast
consistently reported feeling better, around a six or seven. Elite
athletes normally experience mood deterioration before and after a
marathon, but this study revealed that a little nutritional yeast may
improve a wide range of emotional states, reducing feelings of
tenseness, fatigue, confusion, and anger, while at the same time
increasing perceived “vigor.”69 Pass the popcorn!</p>
<hr />
<p>Boosting Immunity with Mushrooms</p>
<p>Do you suffer from seasonal allergies? Runny nose, itchy eyes,
sneezing? While your allergies may make you feel lousy because your
immune system is busily attacking things left and right, that same
heightened state of alertness may have benefits for your overall
health.</p>
<p>Individuals suffering from allergies appear to have a decreased risk
for certain cancers.70 Yes, your immune system might be in overdrive
striking out at harmless things like pollen or dust, but that same
overvigilance may also take down budding tumors in the body. It would be
nice if there were a way to boost the part of the immune system that
fights infections while down-regulating the part that results in chronic
inflammation (and all those annoying symptoms).</p>
<p>Mushrooms may just do the trick.</p>
<p>Just as algae can be thought of as single-celled plants, yeast can be
thought of as single-celled mushrooms. Thousands of edible mushrooms
grow naturally, with worldwide annual commercial production in the
millions of tons.71 But check the nutrition label on a carton of
mushrooms and you won’t see much beyond some B vitamins and minerals. Is
that all mushrooms have? No. What you don’t see listed is the array of
unique myconutrients that may boost our immune function.72</p>
<p>Researchers in Australia split people into two groups. One group ate
its regular diet, while the other ate its regular diet plus a cup of
cooked white button mushrooms every day. After just a week, the mushroom
eaters showed a 50 percent boost in the IgA levels in their saliva.
These antibody levels remained elevated for about a week before
dropping.73 So, for sustained benefits, try to make mushrooms a steady
part of your diet.</p>
<p>But wait. If mushrooms trigger such a dramatic rise in antibody
production, shouldn’t we be concerned they may worsen the symptoms of
allergic or autoimmune diseases? On the contrary, it seems mushrooms may
have an anti-inflammatory effect. In vitro studies have shown that a
variety of mushrooms, including plain white button mushrooms, appear to
blunt the inflammatory response, potentially offering a boost in immune
and anticancer function without aggravating diseases of inflammation.74
The first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of
its kind, published in 2014, confirmed an apparent antiallergy effect in
children with a history of recurrent upper-respiratory-tract
infections.75</p>
<hr />
<p>Food Poisoning</p>
<p>Pathogens (from the Greek pathos, for “suffering,” and genes, meaning
“producer of”) can also be found in what you eat. Foodborne illness, or
food poisoning, is an infection caused by eating contaminated food.
According to the CDC, about one in six Americans develops food poisoning
every year. Roughly forty-eight million people are sickened
annually—larger than the combined populations of California and
Massachusetts. More than one hundred thousand of them are hospitalized,
and thousands die, just because of something they ate.76</p>
<p>In terms of healthy years of life lost, the top five most devastating
pathogen-food combinations are Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria in
poultry, Toxoplasma parasites in pork, and Listeria bacteria in deli
meats and dairy products.77 One of the reasons animal foods are the
leading culprits is that most foodborne pathogens are fecal pathogens.
Because plants don’t poop, the E. coli you may get from spinach didn’t
actually originate in the spinach; E. coli is an intestinal pathogen,
and spinach doesn’t have intestines. The application of manure to crops
has been found to increase the odds of E. coli contamination by more
than fiftyfold.78</p>
<p>Eggs and Salmonella</p>
<p>The single greatest public health burden in the United States in
terms of food poisoning is Salmonella. It’s the leading cause of food
poisoning–related hospitalizations, as well as the number-one cause of
food poisoning–related death.79 And it’s on the rise. Over the past
decade, the number of cases has increased by 44 percent, particularly
among children and the elderly.80 Within twelve to seventy-two hours
after infection, the most common symptoms appear—fever, diarrhea, and
severe abdominal cramps.81 The illness typically lasts between four and
seven days, but among children and the elderly, the disease can be
severe enough to require hospitalization—or funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Many people associate Salmonella with eggs—and for good reason. In
2010, for instance, more than half a billion eggs were recalled due to
Salmonella outbreaks.82 However, the egg industry mantra remained: Stop
whining; eggs are safe. Responding to cries for a recall in an op-ed
published in USA Today, the chairman of the industry trade group United
Egg Producers insisted that “completely cooked eggs are completely safe
eggs.”83 But what exactly does “completely cooked” mean?</p>
<p>The egg industry itself funded research on Salmonella and the various
ways to cook eggs. What did they find? Salmonella in eggs can survive
scrambled, over-easy, and sunny-side-up cooking methods. Sunny side up
was found to be the riskiest. The industry-funded researchers bluntly
concluded: “The sunny-side-up method should be considered unsafe.”84 In
other words, even the egg industry itself knows that its product,
prepared in a manner that millions of Americans eat on any given day all
across the country, is unsafe. Actually, we’ve known this for some time.
Twenty years ago, Purdue University researchers determined that
Salmonella can survive in cooked omelets and french toast.85 Salmonella
may even survive in eggs boiled up to eight minutes.86</p>
<p>Given all of this, it should come as no surprise that, according to
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an estimated 142,000 Americans
are sickened each year by Salmonella-tainted eggs.87 That’s an egg-borne
epidemic each year in the United States. But eggs are “only” number ten
on the worst pathogen-food combination list.</p>
<p>Poultry and Salmonella</p>
<p>Eating chickens, not their eggs, is actually the most common source
of Salmonella poisoning.88 A nationwide outbreak of a particularly
virulent strain of the bacteria was linked to our sixth-largest poultry
producer, Foster Farms. It lasted from March 2013 until July 2014.89 Why
did the outbreak last so long? It was largely because the company
continued to churn out contaminated chicken despite repeated warnings
from the CDC.90 Though the official tally of cases numbered only in the
hundreds, the CDC estimates that for every confirmed case of Salmonella,
another thirty-eight slip through the cracks.91 This means Foster Farms’
chicken may have sickened more than ten thousand people. When U.S.
Department of Agriculture officials went in to investigate, they found
that 25 percent of the chickens they sampled were contaminated with the
same strain of Salmonella, likely the result of fecal matter found on
the chicken carcasses.92</p>
<p>Mexico banned the importation of Foster Farms’ chicken, but in the
United States, it remained available throughout the country.93 When a
car manufacturer’s brakes malfunction, it announces a recall due to
safety concerns. Why hasn’t Salmonella-tainted chicken been recalled?
The U.S. Department of Agriculture once tried to shut down a company
found to be repeatedly violating Salmonella standards. The company sued
and won. “Because normal cooking practices for meat and poultry destroy
the Salmonella organism,” the judges in the case concluded, “the
presence of Salmonella in meat products does not render them ‘injurious
to health.’”94</p>
<p>If proper cooking kills the bug, then why do hundreds of thousands of
Americans continue to be sickened by Salmonella-contaminated poultry
every year? It’s not like E. coli and medium-rare hamburgers—who
undercooks chicken? The problem here is cross-contamination. Between the
time the fresh or frozen bird is picked up from the store and when it’s
slid into the oven, the germs on the chicken can contaminate hands,
utensils, and kitchen surfaces. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent
of the time, placing fresh chicken on a cutting board for a few minutes
can transfer disease-causing bacteria.95 Then, if you put cooked chicken
back on the same cutting board, there’s about a 30 percent chance that
the meat will become recontaminated.96</p>
<p>Foster Farms’ tone-deaf response to the outbreak may actually prove
the most foresighted: “It is not unusual for raw poultry from any
producer to have Salmonella bacteria,” they quoted in a press release.
“Consumers must use proper preparation, handling and cooking
practices.”97 In other words, it should be considered normal for chicken
to be contaminated with Salmonella. Eat at your own risk.</p>
<p>Why are American consumers placed at such high risk? Some European
countries have gotten Salmonella contamination in poultry down as low as
2 percent. How? Because it’s illegal to sell chicken tainted with
Salmonella. What a concept! They don’t allow the sale of fowl fouled
with a pathogen that sickens more than a million Americans a year.98 In
a meat industry trade publication, an Alabama poultry science professor
explained why we don’t have such a “heavy-handed” policy: “The American
consumer is not going to pay that much. It’s as simple as that.” If the
industry had to pay to make it safer, the price would go up. “The fact,”
he said, “is that it’s too expensive not to sell salmonella-positive
chicken.”99</p>
<p>Fecal Bacteria on Meat</p>
<p>The contamination problem extends far beyond a single poultry
producer. In a 2014 issue of Consumer Reports, researchers published a
study on the true cost of cheap chicken. They discovered that 97 percent
of chicken breasts found in retail stores were contaminated with
bacteria that could make people sick.100 Thirty-eight percent of the
Salmonella they found was resistant to multiple antibiotics; the CDC
considers such pathogens to be a serious public health threat.101</p>
<p>As the Mayo Clinic rather indelicately put it, “Most people are
infected with Salmonella by eating foods that have been contaminated by
feces.”102 How does it get there? In slaughter plants, birds are
typically gutted by a metal hook, which too often punctures their
intestines and can expel feces onto the flesh itself. According to the
latest national FDA retail-meat survey, about 90 percent of retail
chicken showed evidence of contamination with fecal matter.103</p>
<p>Using the presence of bugs like E. faecalis and E. faecium as markers
of fecal contamination, 90 percent of chicken parts, 91 percent of
ground turkey, 88 percent of ground beef, and 80 percent of pork chops
are tainted on the retail level nationally.104</p>
<p>While outbreaks of Salmonella infection have increased, E. coli
infection from fecal matter in beef has decreased.105 Why is beef
getting safer but chicken getting riskier?106 One likely factor is that
the government was able to enact a ban on the sale of beef contaminated
with a particularly dangerous strain of E. coli. But why is it illegal
to sell beef known to be contaminated with a potentially deadly pathogen
but perfectly legal to sell contaminated chicken? After all, Salmonella
in chicken kills far more people than E. coli in beef.107</p>
<p>The problem dates back to a famous case in 1974 when the American
Public Health Association sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
putting its stamp of approval on meat contaminated with Salmonella.
Defending the meat industry, the USDA pointed out that because “there
are numerous sources of contamination which might contribute to the
overall problem,” it would be “unjustified to single out the meat
industry and ask that the [USDA] require it to identify its raw products
as being hazardous to health.”108 In other words, because Salmonella has
also been linked to dairy and eggs, it wouldn’t be fair to force only
the meat industry to make their products safer. That’s like the tuna
industry arguing there’s no need to label cans of tuna with mercury
warnings because you could also get exposed by eating a thermometer.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C., Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the meat
industry’s position, asserting that the USDA can allow potentially
deadly Salmonella in meat because “American housewives and cooks
normally are not ignorant or stupid and their methods of preparing and
cooking of food do not ordinarily result in salmonellosis.”109 That’s
like saying minivans don’t need airbags or seat belts, and kids don’t
need car seats, because soccer moms don’t ordinarily crash into
things.</p>
<p>Avoiding Chicken to Avoid Urinary Tract Infections</p>
<p>Where do bladder infections come from? Back in the 1970s, studies of
women over time found that movement of bacteria from the rectum into the
vaginal area preceded the appearance of bladder infections.110 It took
another twenty-five years, though, before DNA fingerprinting techniques
proved that E. coli strains residing in the gut serve as the reservoir
for urinary tract infections (UTIs).111</p>
<p>Another fifteen years passed before scientists tracked down the
ultimate culprit, the original source of some of the UTI-associated
bacteria in the rectum: chicken. McGill University researchers were able
to capture UTI-causing E. coli at the slaughter plants, tracing them to
the meat supply and, eventually, to urinary specimens obtained from
infected women.112 As a result, we now have direct proof that bladder
infections can be a zoonosis—an animal-to-human disease.113 This is a
critical discovery, since UTIs affect more than ten million women each
year in the United States at the cost of more than billion.114 Even
worse, it turns out that many of the strains of E. coli in chicken that
cause UTIs are now resistant to some of our most powerful
antibiotics.115</p>
<p>Can’t we solve this crisis by simply distributing meat thermometers
and making sure people cook chicken thoroughly? No—because of the
cross-contamination issue. Studies have shown that handling raw chicken
can lead to intestinal colonization even if you don’t eat any of it.116
In that case, it doesn’t matter how well you cook your chicken. You
could incinerate it to ash and still walk away infected. After
infection, the drug-resistant chicken bacteria was then found to
multiply to the point of becoming a major part of the research subject’s
gut flora.117</p>
<p>The reason most people have more fecal bacteria in their kitchen
sinks than their toilet seats118 is likely because they prepare their
chickens in the kitchen, not the bathroom. But what if you’re really
careful? A landmark study, published as “The Effectiveness of Hygiene
Procedures for Prevention of Cross-Contamination from Chicken Carcasses
in the Domestic Kitchen,” put this question to the test. Researchers
visited five dozen homes, gave each family a raw chicken, and asked them
to cook it. After the bird was cooked, researchers returned to find
bacteria from chicken feces—Salmonella and Campylobacter, both serious
human pathogens—all over the families’ kitchens: on the cutting board,
utensils, cupboard, the refrigerator handle, the oven handle, the
doorknob, and so on.119</p>
<p>Obviously, people didn’t know what they were doing, so the
researchers then repeated the experiment, but this time gave the
families specific instructions. After they cooked the chicken, the
subjects were told to wash these surfaces with hot water and detergent,
specifically the cutting board, utensils, cupboard, handles, and knobs.
Yet the researchers still found pathogenic fecal bacteria all
over.120</p>
<p>Reading the study, you could tell the researchers were getting a bit
exasperated. Finally, they insisted the subjects use bleach. The
dishcloth used to clean up was to first be immersed in bleach
disinfectant, and then the subjects were to spray a bleach solution on
all surfaces and let it sit for five minutes. However, the researchers
returned to still find Salmonella and Campylobacter on some utensils, a
dishcloth, the counter around the sink, and the cupboards.121 The extent
of the kitchen contamination was much less, but still, it appears that
unless you treat your kitchen like a biohazard laboratory, the only way
to guarantee you’re not going to leave fecal pathogens around the
kitchen is to not bring them into your house in the first place.</p>
<p>There is some good news: It’s not as if you eat chicken once and your
gut is colonized for life. In the study in which volunteers became
infected after just handling the meat, the chicken bacteria that tried
to take over their gut only seemed to last about ten days.122 The good
bacteria in their guts seemed able to muscle the bad guys out of the
way. The problem, unfortunately, is that people tend to eat chicken more
than once every ten days, so they may be constantly reintroducing these
chicken bugs into their systems.</p>
<p>Yersinia in Pork</p>
<p>Nearly one hundred thousand Americans are sickened each year by
Yersinia bacteria.123 In every outbreak for which a source has been
found, the culprit was contaminated pork.124</p>
<p>In most cases, Yersinia food poisoning leads to little more than
acute gastroenteritis, but the symptoms can become severe and mirror
appendicitis, resulting in unnecessary emergency surgeries.125 Long-term
consequences of Yersinia infection include chronic inflammation of the
eyes, kidneys, heart, and joints.126 Studies have found that within a
year of contracting Yersinia food poisoning, victims appear forty-seven
times more likely to come down with autoimmune arthritis,127 and the
bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid
condition known as Graves’ disease.128</p>
<p>How contaminated are U.S. pork products? Consumer Reports magazine
tested nearly two hundred samples from cities across the country and
found that more than two-thirds of the pork was contaminated with
Yersinia.129 This may be because of the intensification and overcrowding
that characterizes most of today’s industrial pig operations.130 As
noted in an article in National Hog Farmer entitled “Crowding Pigs
Pays,” pork producers can maximize their profits by confining each pig
to a six-square-foot space. This basically means cramming a
two-hundred-pound animal into an area equivalent to about two feet by
three feet. The authors acknowledged that overcrowding presents
problems, including inadequate ventilation and increased health risks,
but they concluded that sometimes, “crowding pigs a little tighter will
make you more money.”131</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this situation is not expected to change anytime soon.
Why? Yersinia bacteria do not cause clinical disease in pigs.132 In
other words, it’s a public health problem, not an animal production
problem. It doesn’t affect the industry’s bottom line. So instead of
giving these animals a little more breathing room, the pork industry
just largely passes along to society the estimated 50 million cost of
sickening tens of thousands of Americans every year.133</p>
<p>C. Difficile Superbugs in Meat</p>
<p>There’s a new superbug in town: Clostridium difficile. C. diff, as
it’s commonly known, is one of our most urgent bacterial threats,
infecting an estimated quarter-million Americans annually and killing
thousands at a cost of billion a year.134 It causes a condition called
pseudomembranous colitis, which manifests as painful, crampy diarrhea.
C. diff has traditionally been considered a hospital-acquired
infection—something you pick up in health care settings—but it was
recently discovered that only about one-third of C. diff cases can be
linked to contact with an infected patient.135 What’s going on?</p>
<p>Well, another source of infection may be meat. The CDC found that 42
percent of packaged meat products sold at three national chain grocery
stores sampled contained toxin-producing C. diff bacteria.136 The United
States, it turns out, has the highest reported levels of C. diff meat
contamination in the world.137</p>
<p>C. diff has also been found in chicken, turkey, and beef, but pork
contamination has received the greatest attention from health officials,
as it most closely matches the same strain found in non-hospital-related
human infections.138 Since 2000, C. diff has increasingly been reported
as one of the leading causes of intestinal infections among baby
piglets.139 Carcass contamination with this diarrheal pathogen at the
time of slaughter is considered the most likely source of the
contamination of retail pork.140</p>
<p>Normally, C. diff won’t do anything to you. Even if it gets into your
gut, your good bacteria can usually muscle it into submission. It can
lie in wait, though, until the good guys are out of the way. The next
time you have to take an antibiotic that disrupts your normal gut flora,
C. diff can rear its ugly head and cause a range of inflammatory bowel
conditions, including a life-threatening condition that’s as bad as it
sounds: toxic megacolon.141 (It carries a mortality rate as high as a
flip of a coin.)142</p>
<p>Doesn’t cooking wipe out most bugs? Well, C. diff isn’t like most
bugs. For most meat, 71 degrees Celsius is the recommended internal
cooking temperature. But C. diff can survive two hours of cooking at
that temperature.143 In other words, you could grill chicken at the
recommended cooking thermometer temperature for two hours straight and
still not kill the bug.</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen advertisements for those alcohol-based hand
sanitizers that advertise they kill 99.99 percent of all germs. Well, C.
diff falls into that 0.01 percent. They don’t call it a superbug for
nothing. Residual spores of the pathogen have been shown to be readily
transmitted with a handshake even after using hand sanitizer.144 As one
of the lead researchers who discovered another superbug in the U.S. meat
supply, MRSA,145 has advised,146 people who handle raw meat may want to
wear gloves.</p>
<hr />
<p>Facing a Post-Antibiotic Age</p>
<p>Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization,
recently warned that we may be facing a future in which many of our
miracle drugs no longer work. She stated, “A post-antibiotic era means,
in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it. Things as common as
strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could once again kill.”147 We
may soon be past the age of miracles.</p>
<p>The director-general’s prescription to avoid this catastrophe
included a global call to “restrict the use of antibiotics in food
production to therapeutic purposes.” In other words, only use
antibiotics in agriculture to treat sick animals. But that isn’t
happening. In the United States, meat producers feed millions of pounds
of antibiotics each year to farm animals just to promote growth or
prevent disease in the often cramped, stressful, and unhygienic
conditions of industrial animal agriculture. Yes, physicians
overprescribe antibiotics as well, but the FDA estimates that 80 percent
of the antimicrobial drugs sold in the United States every year now go
to the meat industry.148</p>
<p>Antibiotic residues can then end up in the meat you eat. Studies have
revealed that traces of such antibiotics as Bactrim, Cipro, and
Enrofloxacin have been found in the urine of people eating meat—even
though none of them was taking those drugs. The researchers concluded:
“Consumption amounts of beef, pork, chicken, and dairy products could
explain the daily excretion amount of several antibiotics in urine.”149
These antibiotic levels can be lowered, however, after merely five days
of removing meat from the diet.150</p>
<p>Nearly every major medical and public health institution has come out
against the dangerous practice of feeding antibiotics to farm animals by
the ton just to fatten them faster.151 Yet the combined political might
of agribusiness and the pharmaceutical industries that profit from the
sales of these drugs has effectively thwarted any effective legislative
or regulatory action, all to save the industry less than a penny per
pound of meat.152</p>
<hr />
<p>Healthy living may help protect you against both airborne and
foodborne illnesses. Eating more fruits and vegetables and exercising
more frequently can boost your immune system to help you fight off
respiratory infections like the common cold. And sticking to mostly
plant foods can help prevent you from becoming another food poisoning
statistic by reducing your exposure to some of the deadliest fecal
pathogens.</p>
<hr />
<p>Six years after I helped defend Oprah against her meat-defamation
lawsuit, I received my own legal threat. The Atkins corporation accused
me of “defamatory” statements in my book Carbophobia: The Scary Truth
About America’s Low-Carb Craze. Their lawyer claimed my words “continue
to harm Atkins’ reputation and cause injury to Atkins.” My book
certainly couldn’t have caused more injury to Dr. Atkins than his own
diet. You see, he died the year before, overweight and—according to his
autopsy report—suffering from a history of heart attack, congestive
heart failure, and hypertension.153</p>
<p>However, the lawyers were talking about damage to Atkins
Nutritionals, Inc. Rather than let them shut me up, I posted their legal
threat online with a point-by-point rebuttal.154 Thankfully, under the
law, the truth is considered an absolute defense against defamation.</p>
<p>Atkins’s attorneys never made good on their threat. Within four
months of my book’s publication, the Atkins corporation filed for
bankruptcy.</p>
