How Not to Die from Parkinson’s Disease</h4>
<p>Back in the 1960s at the height of the civil rights movement, my dad
was dodging bullets during the Brooklyn riots and setting up shots at
just the right angle to best capture images of my mother being arrested
at protests and dragged away again and again. His most famous work—one
of Esquire’s 1963 Photos of the Year—depicted family friend Mineral
Bramletter suspended in a Christlike pose between two white police
officers as another cop clutched his throat.</p>
<p>What a cruel twist of fate that a celebrated photojournalist got a
disease that caused his hands to shake. For years, my dad suffered at
the hands of Parkinson’s. Slowly and all too painfully, he lost the
ability to take care of himself, to live his life in any semblance of
the way he had before. He became bedridden and compromised in every way
imaginable.</p>
<p>After sixteen years of fighting, he went to the hospital one last
time. As so often happens with chronic disease, one complication led to
another. He got pneumonia and spent his last few weeks on a ventilator,
suffering through a painful, prolonged death. The weeks he spent in that
hospital bed before he passed were the worst weeks of both his and my
life.</p>
<p>Hospitals are terrible places to be and terrible places to die. That
is why each of us needs to take care of ourselves.</p>
<p>As my father’s story shows, Parkinson’s can end badly. It is the
second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s.
Parkinson’s is a disabling disorder affecting the speed, quality, and
ease of movement. Its hallmark symptoms, which worsen as the disease
progresses, include hand tremors, limb stiffness, impaired balance, and
difficulty walking. It can also affect mood, thinking, and sleep.
Parkinson’s is not currently curable.</p>
<p>The disease is caused by the die-off of specialized nerve cells in a
region of the brain that controls movement. It typically presents after
age fifty. A history of head trauma can increase risk,1 which may be why
heavyweight boxers, including Muhammad Ali, and NFL players, including
Hall of Famer Forrest Gregg, have fallen victim to the condition.
However, most people may be more likely to develop the disease from
toxic pollutants in our environment that can build up in the food supply
and eventually affect the brain.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute’s 2008/2009 U.S. Presidential Cancer
Panel report discussed the degree to which we’re being inundated with
industrial chemicals. It concluded:</p>
<p>The American people—even before they are born—are bombarded
continually with myriad combinations of these dangerous exposures. The
Panel urges you [Mr. President] most strongly to use the power of your
office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food, water,
and air that needlessly increase health care costs, cripple our Nation’s
productivity, and devastate American lives.2</p>
<p>In addition to increasing your risk of developing many cancers,
industrial pollutants may also play a role in the onset of such
brain-deteriorating (neurodegenerative) diseases as Parkinson’s.3 And
those toxins are residing in most peoples’ bodies.</p>
<p>Every few years, the CDC measures the levels of chemical pollutants
in the bodies of thousands of Americans from across the country.
According to the agency’s findings, the bodies of most women in the
United States are contaminated with heavy metals, along with a number of
toxic solvents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, fire retardants,
chemicals from plastics, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and banned
pesticides such as DDT4 (publicized by American biologist Rachel Carson
in her 1962 bestseller Silent Spring).</p>
<p>In many cases, 99–100 percent of the hundreds of women tested were
found to have detectable levels of these pollutants circulating in their
bloodstreams. Pregnant women were found to harbor, on average, up to
fifty different chemicals.5 Could the presence of these potential
toxicants in their bodies mean that they’re also being passed on to
their children? Researchers decided to put that question to the test by
measuring pollutant levels right at delivery in the babies’ umbilical
cord blood. (As soon as the cord is cut, a little blood can be squirted
into a vial.) After studying more than three hundred women who had
recently given birth, researchers found that 95 percent of umbilical
cord samples showed detectable DDT residues.6 And this is now decades
after the pesticide was banned.</p>
<p>What about men? Men tend to have even higher levels of certain
pollutants than women. A clue to solving this mystery was found when
breast-feeding history was taken into account. Women who never
breast-fed had about the same level of certain toxicants in their bodies
as men, but the longer they breast-fed their children, the lower their
levels fell, suggesting that they were detoxing themselves by passing
the pollution down to their children.7</p>
<p>It appears that blood levels of some pollutants in women may drop by
nearly half during pregnancy,8 in part because their bodies pass them
off through the placenta.9 That may be why breast milk concentrations of
pollutants appear higher after the first pregnancy than in subsequent
ones.10 This could explain why birth order was found to be a significant
predictor of pollutant levels in young people. Basically, firstborn kids
may get first dibs on mom’s store of toxic waste, leaving less for their
baby brothers and sisters.11</p>
<p>Even mothers who were breast-fed as infants themselves tend to have
higher levels of pollutants in their own breast milk when they grow up,
suggesting a multigenerational passing down of these chemicals.12 In
other words, what you eat now may affect the levels of toxic chemicals
in your grandchildren. When it comes to feeding babies, breast is still
best—absolutely13—but rather than detoxing into our children, we should
strive not to “tox” ourselves in the first place.</p>
<p>In 2012, researchers from the University of California–Davis,
published an analysis of the diets of California kids aged two to seven.
(Children are thought to be especially vulnerable to chemicals in the
diet because they are still growing, and thus they have a comparatively
greater intake of food and fluids relative to their weight.) Chemicals
and heavy metals in children’s bodies from the foods they ate were
indeed found to exceed safety levels by a larger margin than in adults.
Cancer risk ratios, for instance, were exceeded by a factor of up to one
hundred or more. For every child studied, benchmark levels were
surpassed for arsenic, the banned pesticide dieldrin, and potentially
highly toxic industrial by-products called dioxins. They were also too
high for DDE, a by-product of DDT.14</p>
<p>Which foods contributed the most heavy metals? The number-one food
source of arsenic was poultry among preschoolers and, for their parents,
tuna.15 The top source for lead? Dairy. For mercury? Seafood.16</p>
<p>Those concerned about exposing their children to mercury-containing
vaccines should know that eating just a single serving of fish each week
during pregnancy can lead to more mercury in their infant’s body than
injecting them directly with about a dozen mercury-containing
vaccines.17 You should strive to minimize mercury exposure, but the
benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks. The same cannot be said
for tuna.18</p>
<p>Where in the food supply are these pollutants found? Today, most DDT
comes from meat, particularly fish.19 The oceans are essentially
humanity’s sewer; everything eventually flows into the sea. The same is
true when it comes to dietary exposure to PCBs—another set of banned
chemicals, once widely used as insulating fluid in electrical equipment.
A study of more than twelve thousand food and feed samples across
eighteen countries found that the highest PCB contamination was found in
fish and fish oil, followed by eggs, dairy, and then other meats. The
lowest contamination was found at the bottom of the food chain, in
plants.20</p>
<p>Hexachlorobenzene, another pesticide banned nearly a half century
ago, today may be found mainly in dairy and meat, including fish.21
Perfluorochemicals, or PFCs? Overwhelmingly found in fish and other
meats.22 As for dioxins, in the United States, the most concentrated
sources may be butter, followed by eggs, and then processed meat.23 The
levels in eggs may help explain why one study found that eating more
than half an egg a day was associated with about two to three times
higher odds for cancers of the mouth, colon, bladder, prostate, and
breast compared to those who didn’t eat eggs at all.24</p>
<p>If women want to clean up their diets before conception, how long
does it take for these pollutants to leave their systems? To find out,
researchers asked people to eat one large serving a week of tuna or
other high-mercury fish for fourteen weeks to boost their levels of the
heavy metal and then stop. By measuring how fast the subjects’ mercury
levels dropped, the scientists were able to calculate the half-life of
mercury in the body.25 The subjects appeared to be able to clear about
half the mercury from their bodies within two months. This result
suggests that within a year of stopping fish consumption, the body can
detox nearly 99 percent of it. Unfortunately, other industrial
pollutants in fish can take longer for our bodies to get rid of; the
half-lives for certain dioxins, PCBs, and DDT by-products found in fish
are as long as ten years.26 So to get that same 99 percent drop, it
could take more than a century—a long time to delay having your first
child.</p>
<p>By now you are probably wondering how these chemicals get into your
food in the first place. One reason is that we’ve so thoroughly polluted
our planet that the chemicals can just come down in the rain. For
example, scientists have reported eight different pesticides
contaminating the snow-packed peaks of Rocky Mountain National Park in
Colorado.27 Once pollutants get into the soil, they can work their way
up the food chain at increasing concentrations. Consider that before
she’s slaughtered for meat, a dairy cow may eat seventy-five thousand
pounds’ worth of plants. The chemicals in the plants can get stored in
her fat and build up in her body. So when it comes to many of the
fat-soluble pesticides and pollutants, every time you eat a burger, you
are, in effect, eating everything that burger ate. The best way to
minimize your exposure to industrial toxins may be to eat as low as
possible on the food chain, a plant-based diet.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reducing Dioxin Intake</p>
<p>Dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that accumulate in the fat of
animal tissue, such that about 95 percent of human exposure comes from
eating animal products.28 Sometimes that’s because of contaminated
animal feed. In the 1990s, for example, a supermarket survey found that
the highest concentration of dioxins was found in farm-raised catfish.29
Apparently, the catfish were provided feed mixed with an anticaking
agent laced with dioxins that may have originated from sewage
sludge.30</p>
<p>That same feed was given to chickens, affecting approximately 5
percent of U.S. poultry production at the time.31 That would mean that
people ate hundreds of millions of contaminated chickens.32 Of course,
if it was in the chickens, then it was also in their eggs. Indeed,
elevated dioxins levels were found in U.S. eggs too.33 The U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimated that less than 1 percent of feed was
contaminated, but 1 percent of egg production would mean more than a
million tainted eggs per day. But the catfish contamination was even
more widespread: More than one-third of all U.S. farm-raised catfish
tested were found to be contaminated with dioxins.34</p>
<p>In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration called on feed
manufacturers to stop using these dioxin-tainted ingredients, stating
that “[c]ontinued exposure to elevated dioxin levels in animal feed
increases the risk of adverse health effects in animals and to humans
consuming animal-derived food products.”35 So did the feed industry
clean up their act? Up to a half billion pounds of catfish continued to
be churned out of U.S. fish farms every year,36 but it wasn’t until more
than a decade later that our government went back and checked for
compliance. Researchers from the USDA tested samples of catfish from all
over the country and in 2013 reported that 96 percent of tested samples
still contained dioxins or dioxin-like compounds. And when they checked
the feed used to raise these fish? More than half the samples came back
as contaminated.37</p>
<p>In other words, the feed industry has known for more than two decades
that what they were feeding to animals (and, ultimately, to most of
us38) may contain dioxins, but apparently, they continue this practice
unabated.</p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine has made suggestions for reducing dioxin
exposure, such as trimming fat from meat, including from poultry and
fish, and avoiding the recycling of animal fat into gravy.39 Wouldn’t it
be more prudent just to trim the amount of animal foods from your diet
instead? Researchers have estimated that a plant-based diet could wipe
out about 98 percent of your dioxin intake.40</p>
<hr />
<p>Smoking and Parkinson’s Disease</p>
<p>The CDC recently celebrated the fifty-year anniversary of the
landmark 1964 surgeon general’s report on smoking, considered one of the
great public health achievements of our time.41 It’s interesting to go
back and read the reactions of the tobacco industry to such reports. For
example, an industry insider argued that contrary to the surgeon
general’s argument that smoking costs our nation billions, “smoking
saves the country money by increasing the number of people dying soon
after retirement.”42 In other words, just think how much we’re saving on
Medicare and Social Security thanks to cigarettes.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry also criticized the surgeon general’s “lack of
balance regarding benefits of smoking.”43 As they testified before
Congress, these “positive health benefits” include “the feeling of
well-being, satisfaction, and happiness and everything else.” Beyond all
that happiness the surgeon general was trying to extinguish, the Tobacco
Institute argued, “everything else” included protection against
Parkinson’s disease.44</p>
<p>As it happens, quite unexpectedly, more than five dozen studies over
the past half century have collectively shown that smoking tobacco is
indeed associated with significantly lower incidence of Parkinson’s
disease.45 Valiant attempts have failed to explain away these findings.
Maybe, public health scientists countered, it’s because smokers are
dying off before they get Parkinson’s. No, smoking appears protective at
all ages.46 Maybe it’s because smokers drink more coffee, which we know
to be protective.47 No, the protective effect remained even after
researchers controlled studies for coffee intake.48 Identical-twin
studies helped rule out genetic factors in the link.49 Even simply
growing up in a home where your parents smoked appears protective when
it comes to developing Parkinson’s.50 So was the tobacco industry right?
Does it even matter?</p>
<p>Since the surgeon general’s groundbreaking 1964 report, more than
twenty million Americans have died as a result of smoking.51 Even if you
didn’t care about dying from lung cancer or emphysema, even if you cared
only about protecting your brain, you still shouldn’t smoke, because
smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke.52 But what if you could
get the benefits of smoking without the risks?</p>
<p>Maybe you can. The neuroprotective agent in tobacco appears to be
nicotine.53 Tobacco is part of the nightshade family, the group of
plants that includes tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers. It
turns out they all contain nicotine, too, but in such trace
amounts—hundreds of times less than what’s found in a single
cigarette—that the protective potential of vegetables was dismissed as
inconsequential.54 But then it was discovered that just one to two puffs
of a cigarette can saturate half of your brain’s nicotine receptors.55
Then we learned that even exposure to secondhand smoke may lower the
risk of Parkinson’s56 and that the amount of nicotine exposure sitting
in a smoky restaurant is on the same order as what you might get from
eating a healthy meal in a smoke-free restaurant.57 So might eating lots
of nightshade vegetables protect you from Parkinson’s after all?</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Washington decided to find out. When
they tested for nicotine, they found none in eggplants, just a little in
potatoes, some in tomatoes, and more significant amounts in bell
peppers. These results were consistent with what researchers found when
they studied nearly five hundred newly diagnosed Parkinson’s patients
compared to controls. Eating nicotine-rich vegetables, especially
peppers, was associated with significantly lower risk of Parkinson’s
disease.58 (This effect was found only in the nonsmokers, which makes
sense because the flood of nicotine from cigarettes would likely
overwhelm any dietary effect.) This study may help explain previous
protective associations in terms of Parkinson’s risk that had been
tenuously found for tomato and potato consumption, as well as for the
nightshade-rich Mediterranean diet.59</p>
<p>The University of Washington researchers concluded that more research
is needed before individuals should consider dietary interventions to
prevent Parkinson’s disease, but when that intervention is simply
enjoying more healthy dishes like stuffed peppers with tomato sauce, I
don’t see a reason why you should have to wait.</p>
<p>Dairy</p>
<p>Parkinson’s patients have been found to have elevated levels of an
organochlorine pesticide in their bloodstreams, the class of largely
banned pesticides that includes DDT.60 Autopsy studies have also found
elevated levels of pesticides in the brain tissue of those with
Parkinson’s.61 Elevated levels of other pollutants like PCBs were also
found in their brains, and the higher certain PCB concentrations, the
higher the degree of damage found specifically in the brain region
thought to be responsible for the disease, called the substantia
nigra.62 As noted earlier, though many of these chemicals were banned
decades ago, they may persist in the environment. You can continue to be
exposed to them through the consumption of contaminated animal products
in your diet, including dairy.63 Indeed, people who eat dairy-free,
plant-based diets were found to have significantly lower blood levels of
the PCBs implicated in the development of Parkinson’s disease.64</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of studies involving more than three hundred thousand
participants found that overall dairy consumption was associated with
significantly increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. They estimated that
Parkinson’s risk may increase 17 percent for every daily cup of milk
consumed.65 “Contamination of milk with neurotoxins may be of critical
importance,” researchers offered by way of explanation.66 For example,
neurotoxic chemicals like tetrahydroisoquinoline, a compound used to
induce parkinsonism in primates in laboratory studies,67 appears to be
found predominantly in cheese.68 The concentrations found were low, but
the concern is that they may accumulate over a lifetime of
consumption,69 resulting in the elevated levels found in the brains of
Parkinson’s patients.70 There have been calls on the dairy industry to
require screening of milk for such toxins,71 but they have so far gone
unanswered.</p>
<p>A recent nutrition journal editorial considered the case closed: “The
only possible explanation for this effect is the evidence of the
contamination of milk by neurotoxins.”72 But there are alternate
explanations for the “clear-cut” link between dairy and Parkinson’s.73
For example, pollutant levels wouldn’t explain why Parkinson’s appears
more closely tied to the consumption of the milk sugar lactose than to
milk fat,74 more closely tied to milk than to butter.75 So maybe the
culprit is galactose, the sugar in milk described in chapter 13, blamed
for an increased risk of bone fractures, cancer, and death.76 Those with
an inability to detoxify the galactose in milk not only suffer damage to
their bones but also to their brains.77 This may help explain the link
between milk intake and Parkinson’s, as well as the link between milk
and another neurodegenerative disease called Huntington’s disease.
Indeed, higher consumption of dairy products appears to double the risk
of earlier-onset Huntington’s.78</p>
<p>Another explanation is that milk consumption lowers blood levels of
uric acid, an important brain antioxidant79 shown to protect nerve cells
against the oxidative stress caused by pesticides.80 Uric acid may slow
the progression of Huntington’s81 and Parkinson’s,82 and, most
importantly, may lower the risk of getting Parkinson’s in the first
place.83 Too much uric acid, however, can crystallize in your joints and
cause a painful disease called gout, so uric acid can be thought of as a
double-edged sword.84 Too much uric acid is also associated with heart
disease and kidney disease; too little, with Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s,
Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.85 Those on dairy-free,
plant-based diets appear to hit the sweet spot86 in terms of most
optimal uric acid levels for longevity.87</p>
<p>Milk may not do a body good, at least when it comes to your bones and
brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Plant-Based Diets and Pollutants</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed, organochlorines are a group of chemicals that
includes dioxins, PCBs, and such insecticides as DDT. Although most were
banned decades ago, they persist in the environment and creep up the
food chain into the fat of the animals people eat.</p>
<p>What if you don’t eat any animal products at all? Researchers have
“found that vegans were significantly less polluted than omnivores” when
measuring levels of organochlorines in their blood, including a variety
of PCBs and one of Monsanto’s long-banned Aroclor compounds.88 This
finding is consistent with studies showing higher levels of
organochlorine pesticides in the body fat89 and breast milk90 of those
who eat meat.</p>
<p>People eating completely plant-based diets have also been found to
have markedly lower levels of dioxins in their bodies91 as well as
decreased contamination with PBDEs,92 the flame-retardant chemical
pollutants also linked to neurological problems.93 No surprise: The
highest levels of flame retardants in the U.S. food supply have been
found in fish, though the primary source of intake for most Americans is
poultry, followed by processed meat.94 This discovery helps explain the
significantly lower levels of PBDEs in the bodies of those eating
meat-free diets.95 It appears that the more plant-based foods you eat
and the longer you go without eating animal products, the lower your
levels fall.96 No regulatory limits have been set for PBDEs in food, but
as U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers noted in a survey of
flame-retardant chemicals in domestic meat and poultry, “reducing the
levels of unnecessary, persistent, toxic compounds in food and your diet
is certainly desirable.”97</p>
<p>Eating healthier can also reduce the concentrations of heavy metals
in your body. The levels of mercury in the hair of those eating
plant-based diets were found to be up to ten times lower than of those
who ate fish.98 Within three months of switching to a plant-based diet,
the levels of mercury, lead, and cadmium growing out in your hair appear
to drop significantly (but build back up when meat and eggs are added
back into the diet).99 Unlike heavy metals, though, some organochlorine
pollutants can stick around for decades.100 Any DDT in your KFC may stay
with you for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Berries</p>
<p>Dr. James Parkinson, in his original, centuries-old description of
the disease that bears his name, described a characteristic feature:
“torpid” bowels, or constipation that may precede the diagnosis by many
years.101 We’ve since learned that bowel-movement frequency may even be
predictive of Parkinson’s. Men with less than daily bowel movements, for
instance, were found to be four times more likely to develop the disease
years later.102 Reverse causation has been suggested: Maybe constipation
didn’t lead to Parkinson’s. Maybe Parkinson’s—even decades before it was
diagnosed—led to constipation. This idea was supported by anecdotal
evidence suggesting that throughout their lives, many who would go on to
develop Parkinson’s reported never feeling very thirsty and, perhaps,
decreased water intake contributed to their constipation.103</p>
<p>Alternatively, given the link between dietary pollutants and
Parkinson’s, constipation may be contributing directly to the disease:
the longer feces stay in the bowel, the more neurotoxic chemicals in the
diet may be absorbed.104 There are now more than one hundred studies
linking pesticides to an increased risk for Parkinson’s disease,105 but
many of them are based on subjects’ occupational or ambient exposure.
Approximately one billion pounds of pesticides are applied annually in
the United States,106 and simply living or working in high-spray areas
may increase your risk.107 The use of common household pesticides like
bug sprays is also associated with significantly increased risk.108</p>
<p>How exactly do pesticides increase your risk for Parkinson’s?
Scientists think they may cause DNA mutations that increase your
susceptibility109 or affect the way certain proteins fold in your brain.
In order for proteins to function effectively, they have to be the right
shape. As you make new proteins in your cells, if they come out folded
incorrectly, they are simply recycled, and your body tries again.
Certain misfolded proteins, however, can take a shape that your body has
difficulty breaking down. Should this glitch happen continuously, the
malformed proteins can accumulate and result in the death of the brain’s
nerve cells. Misfolded beta amyloid proteins, for example, are
implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (see chapter 3); misfolded prion
proteins cause mad cow disease, a different malformed protein causes
Huntington’s; and misfolded alpha synuclein proteins can lead to
Parkinson’s disease.110 In the most comprehensive study of this sort to
date, eight out of twelve common pesticides tested were able to trigger
the accumulation of alpha synuclein proteins in human nerve cells in a
petri dish.111</p>
<p>As I’ve said, Parkinson’s disease is caused by the die-off of
specialized nerve cells in a region of the brain that controls movement.
By the time the first symptoms arise, 70 percent of these critical cells
may already be dead.112 Pesticides are so good at killing these neurons
that scientists often use pesticides in the laboratory to try to
re-create Parkinson’s in animals to test new treatments.113</p>
<p>If pesticides are killing off your brain cells, is there anything you
can do to stop the process other than lowering your exposure to them?
There are no known drugs that can prevent these misfolded proteins from
accumulating, but certain phytonutrients called flavonoids—which are
found in fruits and vegetables—may have protective effects. Researchers
tested forty-eight different plant compounds able to cross the
blood-brain barrier to see if any were able to stop alpha synuclein
proteins from clumping together. To their surprise, not only did a
variety of flavonoids inhibit these proteins from accumulating but they
could also break up existing deposits.114</p>
<p>This study suggests that by eating healthfully, you can reduce your
exposure to pollutants while countering their effects at the same time.
And when it comes to countering the effects of pesticides, berries may
be particularly useful. In a head-to-head battle between pesticides and
berries, researchers found that preincubating nerve cells with a
blueberry extract allowed them to better withstand the debilitating
effects of a common pesticide.115 But most such studies were performed
on cells in a petri dish. Is there any evidence in people that eating
berries could make a difference?</p>
<p>A small study published decades ago suggested that the consumption of
blueberries and strawberries might protect against Parkinson’s,116 but
the question remained largely unanswered until a Harvard University
study of about 130,000 people found that people who eat more berries do
indeed appear to have a significantly lower risk of developing the
disease.117</p>
<p>The editorial that accompanied the study in the journal Neurology
concluded that more research is necessary, but “until then, an apple a
day might be a good idea.”118 Apples did appear protective against
Parkinson’s, but only for men. Everyone, however, appeared to benefit
from the consumption of blueberries and strawberries, the only berries
included in the study.119</p>
<p>If you do decide to follow my recommendation to eat berries every
day, I would advise not serving them with cream. Not only has dairy been
shown to block some of the beneficial effects of berries,120 but, as we
saw earlier, dairy products may contain compounds that cause the very
damage the berries may be trying to undo.</p>
<p>Cannibalistic Feed Biomagnification</p>
<p>If people just eat from the bottom two levels of the food chain, only
plants and plant eaters—that is, cows, pigs, and chickens fed grain and
soybeans—why is the American populace so contaminated? Those of you who
remember the mad cow disease story may know the answer. In modern
agribusiness, there are essentially no more herbivores.</p>
<p>Millions of tons of slaughterhouse by-products continue to be fed to
farm animals in the United States every year.121 Not only have we turned
these animals into meat eaters but virtual cannibals as well. When we
feed farm animals millions of tons of meat and bonemeal, we’re also
feeding them any pollutants this feed may contain. Then, after those
animals are slaughtered, their trimmings go to feed the next generation
of farm animals, potentially concentrating the pollutant levels higher
and higher.122 So we can end up like polar bears or eagles at the top of
the food chain and suffer the biomagnified pollutant consequences. When
we eat these farmed animals, it’s almost as if we’re also eating every
animal they ate.</p>
<p>The use of slaughterhouse by-products in animal feed can recycle both
toxic heavy metals and industrial chemicals back into the food supply.
Lead accumulates in animal bones and mercury in animal protein123 (which
is why egg whites contain up to twenty times more mercury than do
yolks).124 Persistent lipophilic organic pollutants (known as
PLOPs125—really!) build up in animal fat. Reducing meat consumption can
help reduce exposure, but these contaminants can come back to us in a
variety of animal products. “Although a vegetarian lifestyle can lower
the body burden of PLOP, MMHg [mercury], and lead,” one toxicologist
noted, “such benefits can be undermined by the consumption of
contaminated milk and egg products. Farm animals that have been fed
contaminated animal products produce contaminated milk and egg
products.”126</p>
<p>If you want to drop your PLOP, eat as low as possible on the food
chain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Coffee for Preventing and Treating Parkinson’s Disease</p>
<p>Could your cup of morning joe help prevent and perhaps even help
treat one of our most crippling neurodegenerative conditions? It appears
so.</p>
<p>There have been at least nineteen studies performed on the role
coffee may play in Parkinson’s, and overall, coffee consumption is
associated with about one-third lower risk.127 The key ingredient
appears to be the caffeine, since tea also seems protective128 and decaf
coffee does not.129 Like the berry phytonutrients, caffeine has been
shown to protect human nerve cells in a petri dish from being killed by
a pesticide and other neurotoxins.130</p>
<p>What about coffee for treating Parkinson’s? In a randomized
controlled trial, giving Parkinson’s patients the caffeine equivalent of
two cups of coffee a day (or approximately four cups of black tea or
eight cups of green tea) significantly improved movement symptoms within
three weeks.131</p>
<p>Of course, there’s only so much you can charge for a cup of coffee,
so drug companies have tried to tweak caffeine into new experimental
drugs, such as preladenant and istradefylline. But it turns out they
don’t appear to work any better than plain coffee, which is far cheaper
and has a better safety record.132</p>
<hr />
<p>There are a number of simple things you can do that may decrease your
risk of dying from Parkinson’s disease. You can wear seat belts and
bicycle helmets to avoid getting hit in the head, you can exercise
regularly,133 avoid becoming overweight,134 consume peppers, berries,
and green tea, and minimize your exposure to pesticides, heavy metals,
and dairy and other animal products. It’s worth it. Trust me when I say
that no family should have to endure the tragedy of Parkinson’s.</p>
