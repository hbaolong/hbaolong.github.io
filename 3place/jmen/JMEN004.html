<h4 id="chapter-1-how-not-to-die-from-heart-disease">CHAPTER 1 How Not
to Die from Heart Disease</h4>
<p>Imagine if terrorists created a bioagent that spread mercilessly,
claiming the lives of nearly four hundred thousand Americans every year.
That is the equivalent of one person every eighty-three seconds, every
hour, around the clock, year after year. The pandemic would be
front-page news all day, every day. We’d marshal the army and march our
finest medical minds into a room to figure out a cure for this bioterror
plague. In short, we’d stop at nothing until the terrorists were
stopped.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re not actually losing hundreds of thousands of
people each year to a preventable threat … are we?</p>
<p>Actually, we are. This particular biological weapon may not be a germ
released by terrorists, but it kills more Americans annually than have
all our past wars combined. It can be stopped not in a laboratory but
right in our grocery stores, kitchens, and dining rooms. As far as
weapons go, we don’t need vaccines or antibiotics. A simple fork will
do.</p>
<p>So what’s going on here? If this epidemic is present on such a
massive scale, yet so preventable, why aren’t we doing more about
it?</p>
<p>The killer I’m talking about is coronary heart disease, and it’s
affecting nearly everyone raised on the standard American diet.</p>
<p>Our Top Killer</p>
<p>America’s number-one killer is a different kind of terrorist: fatty
deposits in the walls of your arteries called atherosclerotic plaque.
For most Americans raised on a conventional diet, plaque accumulates
inside the coronary arteries—the blood vessels that crown the heart
(hence “coronary”) and supply it with oxygen-rich blood. This buildup of
plaque, known as atherosclerosis, from the Greek words athere (gruel)
and sklerosis (hardening), is the hardening of the arteries by pockets
of cholesterol-rich gunk that builds up within the inner linings of the
blood vessels. This process occurs over decades, slowly bulging into the
space inside the arteries, narrowing the path for blood to flow. The
restriction of blood circulation to the heart muscle can lead to chest
pain and pressure, known as angina, when people try to exert themselves.
If the plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form within the artery. This
sudden blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack, damaging or even
killing part of the heart.</p>
<p>When you think about heart disease, you may think of friends or loved
ones who suffered for years with chest pain and shortness of breath
before they finally succumbed. However, for the majority of Americans
who die suddenly from heart disease, the very first symptom may be their
last.1 It’s called “sudden cardiac death.” This is when death occurs
within an hour of symptom onset. In other words, you may not even
realize you’re at risk until it’s too late. You could be feeling
perfectly fine one moment, and then an hour later, you’re gone forever.
That’s why it’s critical to prevent heart disease in the first place,
before you even necessarily know you have it.</p>
<p>My patients often asked me, “Isn’t heart disease just a consequence
of getting old?” I can see why this is a common misconception. After
all, your heart pumps literally billions of times during the average
life span. Does your ticker just conk out after a while? No.</p>
<p>A large body of evidence shows there were once enormous swaths of the
world where the epidemic of coronary heart disease simply didn’t exist.
For instance, in the famous China-Cornell-Oxford Project (known as the
China Study), researchers investigated the eating habits and incidence
of chronic disease among hundreds of thousands of rural Chinese. In
Guizhou province, for example, a region comprising half a million
people, over the course of three years, not a single death could be
attributed to coronary artery disease among men under sixty-five.2</p>
<p>During the 1930s and 1940s, Western-trained doctors working
throughout an extensive network of missionary hospitals in sub-Saharan
Africa noticed that many of the chronic diseases laying waste to
populations in the so-called developed world were largely absent across
most of the continent. In Uganda, a country of millions in eastern
Africa, coronary heart disease was described as “almost
non-existent.”3</p>
<p>But were the people of these nations simply dying early of other
diseases, never living long enough to come down with heart disease?
No. The doctors compared autopsies of Ugandans to autopsies of Americans
who had died at the same age. The researchers found that out of 632
people autopsied in Saint Louis, Missouri, there had been 136 heart
attacks. But in 632 age-matched Ugandans? A single heart attack. The
Ugandans experienced more than one hundred times fewer heart attacks
than the Americans. The doctors were so blown away that they examined
another 800 deaths in Uganda. Out of more than 1,400 Ugandans autopsied,
researchers found just one body with a small, healed lesion of the
heart, meaning the attack wasn’t even fatal. Then and now, in the
industrialized world, heart disease is a leading killer. In central
Africa, heart disease was so rare it killed fewer than one in a
thousand.4</p>
<p>Immigration studies show that this resistance to heart disease is not
just something in the Africans’ genes. When people move from low-risk to
high-risk areas, their disease rates skyrocket as they adopt the diet
and lifestyle habits of their new homes.5 The extraordinarily low rates
of heart disease in rural China and Africa have been attributed to the
extraordinarily low cholesterol levels among these populations. Though
Chinese and African diets are very different, they share commonalities:
They are both centered on plant-derived foods, such as grains and
vegetables. By eating so much fiber and so little animal fat, their
total cholesterol levels averaged under 150 mg/dL,6,7 similar to people
who eat contemporary plant-based diets.8</p>
<p>So what does all of this mean? It means heart disease may be a
choice.</p>
<p>If you looked at the teeth of people who lived more than ten thousand
years before the invention of the toothbrush, you’d notice they had
almost no cavities.9 They never flossed a day in their lives, yet no
cavities. That’s because candy bars hadn’t been invented yet. The reason
people get cavities now is that the pleasure they derive from sugary
treats may outweigh the cost and discomfort of the dentist’s chair. I
certainly enjoy the occasional indulgence—I’ve got a good dental plan!
But what if instead of the dental plaque on our teeth, we’re talking
about the atherosclerotic plaque building up in our arteries? We’re not
just talking about scraping tartar anymore. We’re talking about life and
death.</p>
<p>Heart disease is the number-one reason we and most of our loved ones
will die. Of course, it’s up to each of us to make our own decisions as
to what to eat and how to live, but shouldn’t we try to make these
choices consciously by educating ourselves about the predictable
consequences of our actions? Just as we could avoid sugary foods that
rot our teeth, we can avoid the trans fat, saturated fat, and
cholesterol-laden foods that clog up our arteries.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the progression of coronary heart disease
throughout life and learn how simple dietary choices at any stage may
prevent, stop, and even reverse heart disease before it’s too late.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is Fish Oil Just Snake Oil?</p>
<p>Thanks in part to the American Heart Association’s recommendation
that individuals at high risk for heart disease should ask their
physicians about omega-3 fish oil supplementation,10 fish oil pills have
grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. We now consume more than one
hundred thousand tons of fish oil every year.11</p>
<p>But what does the science say? Are the purported benefits of fish oil
supplementation for the prevention and treatment of heart disease just a
fish tale? A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association looked at all the best
randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of omega-3 fats on
life span, cardiac death, sudden death, heart attack, and stroke. These
included studies not only on fish oil supplements but also studies on
the effects of advising people to eat more oily fish. What did they
find? Overall, the researchers found no protective benefit for overall
mortality, heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac death, heart attack,
or stroke.12</p>
<p>What about for someone who had already had a heart attack and is
trying to prevent another? Still no benefit was found.13</p>
<p>Where did we even get this idea that the omega-3 fats in fish and
fish oil supplements are good for you? There was a notion that Eskimos
were protected from heart disease, but that appears to be a complete
myth.14 Some early studies, however, looked promising. For example, the
famous DART trial from the 1980s involving two thousand men found that
those advised to eat fatty fish had a 29 percent reduction in
mortality.15 That’s impressive, so it’s no wonder the study got a lot of
attention. But people seem to have forgotten about the sequel, the
DART-2 trial, which found the exact opposite. Run by the same group of
researchers, the DART-2 trial was an even bigger study—three thousand
men—but this time, participants advised to eat oily fish and
particularly those who were supplied with fish oil capsules had a higher
risk of cardiac death.16,17</p>
<p>After putting all the studies together, researchers concluded that
there was no longer justification for the use of omega-3s in everyday
clinical practice.18 What should doctors do when their patients follow
the American Heart Association’s advice and inquire about fish oil
supplements? As the director of Lipids and Metabolism at Mount Sinai’s
cardiovascular institute put it: “Given this and other negative
meta-analyses, our job [as doctors] should be to stop highly marketed
fish oil supplementation to all our patients…”19</p>
<hr />
<p>Heart Disease Starts in Childhood</p>
<p>In 1953, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association radically changed our understanding of the development of
heart disease. Researchers conducted a series of three hundred autopsies
on American casualties of the Korean War, with an average age of around
twenty-two. Shockingly, 77 percent of soldiers already had visible
evidence of coronary atherosclerosis. Some even had arteries that were
blocked off 90 percent or more.20 The study “dramatically showed that
atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and
decades before the age at which coronary heart disease (CHD) becomes a
clinically recognized problem.”21</p>
<p>Later studies of accidental death victims between the ages of three
and twenty-six found that fatty streaks—the first stage of
atherosclerosis—were found in nearly all American children by age ten.22
By the time we reach our twenties and thirties, these fatty streaks can
turn into full-blown plaques like those seen in the young American GIs
of the Korean War. And by the time we’re forty or fifty, they can start
killing us off.</p>
<p>If there’s anyone reading this over the age of ten, the question
isn’t whether or not you want to eat healthier to prevent heart disease
but whether or not you want to reverse the heart disease you very likely
already have.</p>
<p>Just how early do these fatty streaks start to appear?
Atherosclerosis may start even before birth. Italian researchers looked
inside arteries taken from miscarriages and premature newborns who died
shortly after birth. It turns out that the arteries of fetuses whose
mothers had high LDL cholesterol levels were more likely to contain
arterial lesions.23 This finding suggests that atherosclerosis may not
just start as a nutritional disease of childhood but one during
pregnancy.</p>
<p>It’s become commonplace for pregnant women to avoid smoking and
drinking alcohol. It’s also never too early to start eating healthier
for the next generation.</p>
<p>According to William C. Roberts, the editor in chief of the American
Journal of Cardiology, the only critical risk factor for atherosclerotic
plaque buildup is cholesterol, specifically elevated LDL cholesterol in
your blood.24 Indeed, LDL is called “bad” cholesterol, because it’s the
vehicle by which cholesterol is deposited into your arteries. Autopsies
of thousands of young accident victims have shown that the level of
cholesterol in the blood was closely correlated with the amount of
atherosclerosis in their arteries.25 To drastically reduce LDL
cholesterol levels, you need to drastically reduce your intake of three
things: trans fat, which comes from processed foods and naturally from
meat and dairy; saturated fat, found mainly in animal products and junk
foods; and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol, found exclusively in
animal-derived foods, especially eggs.26</p>
<p>Notice a pattern here? The three boosters of bad cholesterol—the
number-one risk factor for our number-one killer—all stem from eating
animal products and processed junk. This likely explains why populations
living on traditional diets revolving around whole plant foods have
largely remained free from the epidemic of heart disease.</p>
<p>It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!</p>
<p>Dr. Roberts hasn’t only been editor in chief of the American Journal
of Cardiology for more than thirty years; he’s the executive director of
the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute and has authored more than a
thousand scientific publications and written more than a dozen textbooks
on cardiology. He knows his stuff.</p>
<p>In his editorial “It’s the Cholesterol, Stupid!,” Dr. Roberts argued
(as noted earlier) that there is only one true risk factor for coronary
heart disease: cholesterol.27 You could be an obese, diabetic, smoking
couch potato and still not develop atherosclerosis, he argues, as long
as the cholesterol level in your blood is low enough.</p>
<p>The optimal LDL cholesterol level is probably 50 or 70 mg/dL, and
apparently, the lower, the better. That’s where you start out at birth,
that’s the level seen in populations largely free of heart disease, and
that’s the level at which the progression of atherosclerosis appears to
stop in cholesterol-lowering trials.28 An LDL around 70 mg/dL
corresponds to a total cholesterol reading of about 150, the level below
which no deaths from coronary heart disease were reported in the famous
Framingham Heart Study, a generations-long project to identify risk
factors for heart disease.29 The population target should therefore be a
total cholesterol level under 150 mg/dL. “If such a goal was created,”
Dr. Roberts wrote, “the great scourge of the Western world would be
essentially eliminated.”30</p>
<p>The average cholesterol for people living in the United States is
much higher than 150 mg/dL; it hovers around 200 mg/dL. If your blood
test results came back with a total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL, your
physician might reassure you that your cholesterol is normal. But in a
society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, having a “normal”
cholesterol level is probably not a good thing.</p>
<p>To become virtually heart-attack proof, you need to get your LDL
cholesterol at least under 70 mg/dL. Dr. Roberts noted that there are
only two ways to achieve this for our population: to put more than a
hundred million Americans on a lifetime of medications or to recommend
they all eat a diet centered around whole plant foods.31</p>
<p>So: drugs or diet. All health plans cover cholesterol-lowering statin
drugs, so why change your diet if you can simply pop a pill every day
for the rest of your life? Unfortunately, as we’ll see in chapter 15,
these drugs don’t work nearly as well as people think, and they may
cause undesirable side effects to boot.</p>
<p>Want Fries with That Lipitor?</p>
<p>The cholesterol-lowering statin drug Lipitor has become the
best-selling drug of all time, generating more than 40 billion in global
sales.32 This class of drugs garnered so much enthusiasm in the medical
community that some U.S. health authorities reportedly advocated they be
added to the public water supply like fluoride is.33 One cardiology
journal even offered the tongue-in-cheek suggestion for fast-food
restaurants to offer “McStatin” condiments along with ketchup packets to
help neutralize the effects of unhealthy dietary choices.34</p>
<p>For those at high risk for heart disease who are unwilling or unable
to bring down their cholesterol levels naturally with dietary changes,
the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks. These drugs do
have side effects, though, such as the potential for liver or muscle
damage. The reason some doctors routinely order regular blood tests for
patients on these drugs is to monitor for liver toxicity. We can also
test the blood for the presence of muscle breakdown products, but
biopsies reveal that people on statins can show evidence of muscle
damage even if their blood work is normal and they exhibit no symptoms
of muscle soreness or weakness.35 The decline in muscular strength and
performance sometimes associated with these drugs may not be such a big
deal for younger individuals, but they can place our seniors at
increased risk for falls and injury.36</p>
<p>More recently, other concerns have been raised. In 2012, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration announced newly mandated safety labeling on
statin drugs to warn doctors and patients about their potential for
brain-related side effects, such as memory loss and confusion. Statin
drugs also appeared to increase the risk of developing diabetes.37 In
2013, a study of several thousand breast cancer patients reported that
long-term use of statins may as much as double a woman’s risk of
invasive breast cancer.38 The primary killer of women is heart disease,
not cancer, so the benefits of statins may still outweigh the risks, but
why accept any risk at all if you can lower your cholesterol
naturally?</p>
<p>Plant-based diets have been shown to lower cholesterol just as
effectively as first-line statin drugs, but without the risks.39 In
fact, the “side effects” of healthy eating tend to be good—less cancer
and diabetes risk and protection of the liver and brain, as we’ll
explore throughout the rest of this book.</p>
<p>Heart Disease Is Reversible</p>
<p>It’s never too early to start eating healthfully, but is it ever too
late? Such lifestyle medicine pioneers as Nathan Pritikin, Dean Ornish,
and Caldwell Esselstyn Jr. took patients with advanced heart disease and
put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by Asian and African
populations who didn’t suffer from heart disease. Their hope was that a
healthy enough diet would stop the disease process and keep it from
progressing further.</p>
<p>But instead, something miraculous happened.</p>
<p>Their patients’ heart disease started to reverse. These patients were
getting better. As soon as they stopped eating an artery-clogging diet,
their bodies were able to start dissolving away some of the plaque that
had built up. Arteries opened up without drugs or surgery, even in some
cases of patients with severe triple-vessel heart disease. This suggests
their bodies wanted to heal all along but were just never given the
chance.40</p>
<p>Let me share with you what has been called the “best kept secret in
medicine”:41 Given the right conditions, the body heals itself. If you
whack your shin really hard on a coffee table, it can get red, swollen,
and painful. But your shin will heal naturally if you just stand back
and let your body work its magic. But what if you kept whacking it in
the same place three times a day—say, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
It would never heal.</p>
<p>You could go to your doctor and complain that your shin hurts. “No
problem,” he or she might say, whipping out a pad to write you a
prescription for painkillers. You’d go back home, still whacking your
shin three times a day, but the pain pills would make it feel so much
better. Thank heavens for modern medicine! That’s what happens when
people take nitroglycerin for chest pain. Medicine can offer tremendous
relief, but it’s not doing anything to treat the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Your body wants to regain its health if you let it. But if you keep
reinjuring yourself three times a day, you interrupt the healing
process. Consider smoking and lung cancer risk: One of the most amazing
things I learned in medical school was that within about fifteen years
of stopping smoking, your lung-cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong
nonsmoker.42 Your lungs can clear out all that tar buildup and,
eventually, it’s almost as if you never smoked at all.</p>
<p>Your body wants to be healthy. And every night of your smoking life,
as you fall asleep, that healing process is restarted until … bam!—you
light up your first cigarette the next morning. Just as you can reinjure
your lungs with every puff, you can reinjure your arteries with every
bite. You can choose moderation and hit yourself with a smaller hammer,
but why beat yourself up at all? You can choose to stop damaging
yourself, get out of your own way, and let your body’s natural healing
process bring you back toward health.</p>
<p>Endotoxins Crippling Your Arteries</p>
<p>Unhealthy diets don’t just affect the structure of your arteries; an
unhealthy diet can also affect their functioning. Your arteries are not
merely inert pipes through which blood flows. They are dynamic, living
organs. We’ve known for nearly two decades that a single fast-food
meal—Sausage and Egg McMuffins were used in the original study—can
stiffen your arteries within hours, cutting in half their ability to
relax normally.43 And just as this inflammatory state starts to calm
down five or six hours later—lunchtime! You may once again whack your
arteries with another load of harmful food, leaving many Americans stuck
in a danger zone of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Unhealthy meals
don’t just cause internal damage decades down the road but right here
and now, within hours of going into your mouth.</p>
<p>Originally, researchers blamed the animal fat or animal protein, but
attention has recently shifted to bacterial toxins known as
“endotoxins.” Certain foods, such as meats, appear to harbor bacteria
that can trigger inflammation dead or alive, even when the food is fully
cooked. Endotoxins are not destroyed by cooking temperatures, stomach
acid, or digestive enzymes, so after a meal of animal products, these
endotoxins may end up in your intestines. They are then thought to be
ferried by saturated fat across the gut wall into your bloodstream,
where they can trigger the inflammatory reaction in your arteries.44</p>
<p>This may help explain the remarkable speed at which cardiac patients
can experience relief when placed on a diet composed primarily of plant
foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Dr. Ornish
reported a 91 percent reduction in angina attacks within just a few
weeks in patients placed on a plant-based diet both with45 or without46
exercise. This rapid resolution in chest pain occurred well before their
bodies could have cleared the plaque from their arteries, suggesting
plant-based diets don’t just help clean out arteries but also improve
their day-to-day function. In contrast, control-group patients who were
instead told to follow the advice of their doctors had a 186 percent
increase in angina attacks.47 It’s no surprise their conditions
worsened, given that they continued to eat the same diet that crippled
their arteries in the first place.</p>
<p>We’ve known about the dramatic power of dietary changes for decades.
For example, there was a paper entitled “Angina and Vegan Diet”
published in the American Heart Journal back in 1977. Vegan diets are
exclusively plant based, avoiding meat, dairy, and eggs. Doctors
described cases like that of Mr. F. W. (initials are often used to
protect patient confidentiality), a sixty-five-year-old man with angina
so severe he had to stop every nine or ten steps. He couldn’t even make
it to the mailbox. He was started on a vegan diet, and his pain improved
within days. Within months, he was reportedly climbing mountains with no
pain at all.48</p>
<p>Not ready to start eating healthier? Well, there is a new class of
antiangina drugs, such as ranolazine (sold as Ranexa). A drug company
executive suggested its product be used for people not “able to comply
with the substantial dietary changes required to achieve a vegan
diet.”49 The medication costs more than ,000 a year, but the side
effects are relatively minor, and it does work … technically speaking.
At the highest dose, Ranexa was able to prolong exercise duration by
33.5 seconds.50 More than half a minute! It doesn’t look like those
choosing the drug route will be climbing mountains anytime soon.</p>

<p>Brazil Nuts for Cholesterol Control?</p>
<p>Can a single serving of Brazil nuts bring down your cholesterol
levels faster than statin drugs and keep them down even a month after
that single meal?</p>
<p>It was one of the craziest findings I’d ever seen. Researchers
from—where else?—Brazil gave ten men and women a single meal containing
between one and eight Brazil nuts. Amazingly, compared to the control
group who ate no nuts at all, just a single serving of four Brazil nuts
almost immediately improved cholesterol levels. LDL—the
“bad”—cholesterol levels were a staggering twenty points lower just nine
hours after eating the Brazil nuts.51 Even drugs don’t work nearly that
fast.52</p>
<p>Here’s the truly insane part: The researchers went back and measured
the study participants’ cholesterol thirty days later. Even a month
after ingesting a single serving of Brazil nuts, their cholesterol
levels stayed down.</p>
<p>Normally, when a study comes out in the medical literature showing
some too-good-to-be-true result like this, doctors wait to see the
results replicated before they change their clinical practice and begin
recommending something new to their patients, particularly when the
study is done on only ten subjects, and especially when the findings
seem too incredible to believe. But when the intervention is cheap,
easy, harmless, and healthy—we’re talking just four Brazil nuts per
month—then in my opinion, the burden of proof is somewhat reversed. I
think the reasonable default position is to do it until proven
otherwise.</p>
<p>More is not better, however. Brazil nuts are so high in the mineral
selenium that eating four every day may actually bump you up against the
tolerable daily limit for selenium. Nevertheless, this is not something
you have to worry about if you’re only eating four Brazil nuts a
month.</p>
<hr />
<p>Follow the Money</p>
<p>Research showing that coronary heart disease can be reversed with a
plant-based diet—with or without other healthy lifestyle changes—has
been published for decades in some of the most prestigious medical
journals in the world. Why hasn’t this news translated into public
policy yet?</p>
<p>In 1977, the U.S. Senate Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs tried
to do just that. Known as the McGovern Committee, they released Dietary
Goals for the United States, a report advising Americans to cut down on
animal-based foods and increase their consumption of plant-based foods.
As a founding member of Harvard University’s nutrition department
recalls, “The meat, milk and egg producers were very upset.”53 That’s an
understatement. Under industry pressure, not only was the goal to
“decrease meat consumption” removed from the report but the entire
Senate nutrition committee was disbanded. Several prominent senators
reputedly lost their election bids as a result of supporting the
report.54</p>
<p>In more recent years, it was uncovered that many members of the U.S.
Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee had financial ties to everything
from candy bar companies to entities like McDonald’s Council on Healthy
Lifestyles and Coca-Cola’s Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness.
One committee member even served as “brand girl” for cake-mix maker
Duncan Hines and then as the official Crisco “brand girl” before going
on to help write the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans.55</p>
<p>As one commentator noted in the Food and Drug Law Journal,
historically, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee reports
contained:</p>
<p>No discussion at all of the scientific research on the health
consequences of eating meat. If the Committee actually discussed this
research, it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat,
as the research would show that meat increases the risks of chronic
diseases, contrary to the purposes of the Guidelines. Thus, by simply
ignoring that research, the Committee is able to reach a conclusion that
would otherwise look improper.56</p>
<p>What about the medical profession, though? Why haven’t my colleagues
fully embraced this research demonstrating the power of good nutrition?
Sadly, the history of medicine holds many examples of the medical
establishment rejecting sound science when it goes against the
prevailing conventional wisdom. There’s even a name for it: the “Tomato
Effect.” The term was coined in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in reference to the fact that tomatoes were once considered
poisonous and were shunned for centuries in North America, despite
overwhelming evidence to the contrary.57</p>
<p>It’s bad enough that most medical schools don’t even require a single
course on nutrition,58 but it’s even worse when mainstream medical
organizations actively lobby against increased nutrition education for
physicians.59 When the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) was
called out on their proud new corporate relationship with Coca-Cola to
support patient education on healthy eating, an executive vice president
of the academy tried to quell protests by explaining that this alliance
was not without precedent. After all, they’d had relationships with
PepsiCo and McDonald’s for some time.60 Even before that, they had
financial ties to cigarette maker Philip Morris.61</p>
<p>This argument didn’t seem to placate the critics, so the AAFP
executive quoted them the American Dietetic Association’s policy
statement that “[t]here are no good or bad foods, just good or bad
diets.” No bad foods? Really? The tobacco industry used to broadcast a
similar theme: Smoking per se wasn’t bad, only “excess” smoking.62 Sound
familiar? Everything in moderation.</p>
<p>The American Dietetic Association (ADA), which produces a series of
nutrition fact sheets with guidelines on maintaining a healthy diet,
also has its own corporate ties. Who writes these fact sheets? Food
industry sources pay the ADA 0,000 per fact sheet to explicitly take
part in the drafting process. So we can learn about eggs from the
American Egg Board and about the benefits of chewing gum from the
Wrigley Science Institute.63</p>
<p>In 2012, the American Dietetic Association changed its name to the
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics but didn’t appear to change its
policies. It continues to take millions of dollars every year from
processed junk food, meat, dairy, soda, and candy bar companies. In
return, the academy lets them offer official educational seminars to
teach dietitians what to say to their clients.64 When you hear the title
“registered dietitian,” this is the group they are registered through.
Thankfully, a movement within the dietitian community, exemplified by
the formation of the organization Dietitians for Professional Integrity,
has started to buck this trend.</p>
<p>What about individual doctors, though? Why aren’t all my colleagues
telling their patients to lay off the Chick-fil-A? Insufficient time
during office visits is a common excuse physicians cite, but the top
reason doctors give for not counseling patients with high cholesterol to
eat healthier is that they think patients may “fear privations related
to dietary advice.”65 In other words, doctors perceive that patients
would feel deprived of all the junk they’re eating. Can you imagine a
doctor saying, “Yeah, I’d like to tell my patients to stop smoking, but
I know how much they love it”?</p>
<p>Neal Barnard, M.D., president of the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine, recently wrote a compelling editorial in the
American Medical Association’s journal of ethics, describing how doctors
went from being bystanders—or even enablers—of smoking to leading the
fight against tobacco. Doctors realized they were more effective at
counseling patients to quit smoking if they no longer had tobacco stains
on their own fingers.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Barnard says, “Plant-based diets are the nutritional
equivalent of quitting smoking.”66</p>
