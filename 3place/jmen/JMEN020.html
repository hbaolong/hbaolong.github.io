<h4 id="appendi">APPENDI</h4>
<p>XSupplements</p>
<p>By getting your nutrients from green-light foods, not only will you
minimize exposure to harmful food components, such as sodium, saturated
fat, and cholesterol, but you will maximize your intake of nearly every
required nutrient: vitamin A carotenoids; vitamin C; vitamin E; the B
vitamins, including thiamin, riboflavin, and folate; as well as
magnesium, iron, and potassium, not to mention fiber.1 Dietary quality
rating scales consistently rank the most-plant-based diets as the
healthiest.2</p>
<p>That said, because of the way we live in our modern world, there are
important shortfalls that need to be corrected.</p>
<p>For example, vitamin B12 is not made by plants; it’s made by microbes
that blanket the earth. But in this sanitized modern world, we now
chlorinate the water supply to kill off any bacteria. While you don’t
get much B12 in the water anymore, you don’t get much cholera,
either—that’s a good thing! Similarly, we evolved to make all the
vitamin D we need from the sun, but most of us are no longer running
around naked in equatorial Africa. You may be covered up, inside, at a
high northern latitude and therefore need to supplement your diet with
this “sunshine vitamin.” Thus, these two vitamins must be addressed.</p>
<p>2,500 mcg (µg) Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) at Least Once a Week</p>
<p>Given modern sanitary standards, a regular, reliable source of
vitamin B12 is critical for anyone eating a plant-based diet.3 Though
deficiency for those starting out with adequate stores may take years to
develop,4 the results of B12 deficiency can be devastating, with cases
reported of paralysis,5 psychosis,6 blindness,7 and even death.8 Newborn
infants of mothers who eat a plant-based diet and who fail to supplement
can develop deficiency much more rapidly with disastrous results.9</p>
<p>For adults under age sixty-five, the easiest way to get B12 is to
take at least one 2,500 mcg supplement each week. If you take too much,
you merely get expensive pee. Well, not all that expensive: A five-year
supply of vitamin B12 can cost less than twenty dollars.10 If you’d
rather get into the habit of taking it daily, the once-a-day dosing is
250 mcg.11 Note that these doses are specific to cyanocobalamin, the
preferred supplemental form of vitamin B12, as there is insufficient
evidence to support the efficacy of the other forms, like
methylcobalamin.12</p>
<p>As you age, your ability to absorb vitamin B12 may decline.13 For
those over sixty-five who eat plant-based diets, the supplementation
should probably be increased from at least 2,500 mcg a week (or 250 mcg
a day) up to 1,000 mcg of cyanocobalamin each day.14,15</p>
<p>Instead of taking B12 supplements, it’s possible to get sufficient
amounts from B12-fortified foods, but you would have to eat three
servings a day of foods providing at least 25 percent of the Daily Value
(on the Nutrition Facts label),16 with each serving eaten at least four
to six hours after the last.17 The only green-light source I’m aware of
is B12-fortified nutritional yeast, for which two teaspoons three times
a day would suffice. For most people, though, it would probably be
cheaper and more convenient to just take a supplement.</p>
<p>My other supplement recommendations in this section can be considered
conditional, but getting enough vitamin B12 is absolutely nonnegotiable
for those centering their diets around green-light foods.</p>
<p>Vitamin D from Sun or Supplements</p>
<p>I recommend that people unable to get sufficient sun take one 2,000
IU vitamin D3 supplement each day,18 ideally with the largest meal of
the day.19</p>
<p>In the northern hemisphere, below approximately 30° latitude (south
of Los Angeles, Dallas, or Atlanta), fifteen minutes each day of midday
sun on the forearms and face without sunblock should produce sufficient
vitamin D for Caucasians under the age of sixty. Those who have darker
skin20 or who are older21 may require thirty minutes or more.</p>
<p>Farther north, at 40° latitude (Portland, Chicago, or New York City),
the sun’s rays are at such an angle during the months of November
through February that vitamin D may not be produced. No matter how long
you might sunbathe naked in Times Square on New Year’s Day, you won’t
make any vitamin D.22</p>
<p>Above 50° latitude (around London, Berlin, Moscow, and Edmonton,
Canada), this “vitamin D winter” may extend for as long as six months of
the year.</p>
<p>Vitamin D supplements are therefore recommended for people at higher
latitudes during the winter months and year-round for those not getting
enough midday sun, regardless of location. This may also apply to those
living in smoggy cities, such as Los Angeles or San Diego.23</p>
<p>I do not recommend tanning beds. They can be both ineffective24 and
dangerous.25 The lamps emit mostly UVA,26 which increases melanoma skin
cancer risk without producing vitamin D.27</p>
<p>Eat Iodine-Rich Foods</p>
<p>Iodine, a mineral essential for thyroid function, is found
predominantly in the ocean and in variable amounts in the soils of the
world. To ensure everyone was getting enough, table salt was fortified
with the mineral starting in the 1920s. So if you do add salt to your
food, use iodized salt (not sea salt or “natural” salt, which contains
about sixty times less iodine28). Given that sodium is considered the
second-leading dietary killer in the world,29 however, iodized salt
should be considered a red-light source.</p>
<p>There are two yellow-light sources of iodine: seafood and dairy milk.
(Iodine leaches into the milk from iodine-containing antiseptic
chemicals used to disinfect the cow’s teats to prevent mastitis.30) The
most concentrated green-light source is seaweed, which has the iodine of
seafood without the fat-soluble pollutants that build up in the aquatic
food chain.</p>
<p>Sea vegetables are the underwater dark-green leafies. I encourage you
to experiment with ways to include them in your diet. The recommended
daily intake of iodine is 150 mcg, which is what is in about two sheets
of nori,31 the seaweed that’s used to make sushi. There are all sorts of
seaweed snacks on the market now, but most, if not all of them, seem to
have added red-light ingredients. So I buy plain nori and season the
sheets myself by brushing them with jarred pickled ginger juice and
lightly sprinkling on wasabi powder before recrisping them at 300°F for
about five minutes.</p>
<p>Sprinkling just a half teaspoon of the seaweeds arame or dulse onto
dishes you’re preparing may also get you your iodine for the day. Dulse
is sold as pretty purple flakes you can just shake onto your food. I do
caution against hijiki32 (also spelled hiziki), because it has been
found to be contaminated with arsenic. I also caution against kelp,
which may have too much iodine; just a half teaspoon of kelp could
exceed the daily upper limit. For the same reason, you shouldn’t get
into a regular habit of eating more than fifteen sheets of nori or more
than a tablespoon of arame or dulse a day.33 Too much iodine can cause
excessive thyroid gland activity.34</p>
<p>For those who don’t like seaweed, Eden brand’s canned beans have a
tiny amount of kelp added such that iodine levels average between 36.3
mcg per half-cup serving (great northern beans) to 71.2 mcg (navy
beans).35 Not only are those levels safe—you’d have to eat about twenty
cans a day to get too much—but checkmarking my three legume servings a
day with Eden’s beans would fulfill your daily iodine requirement.</p>
<p>One last note about iodine: Although people who avoid seafood and
dairy products do not appear to have impaired thyroid function,36,37 I
would not leave it to chance during pregnancy, where iodine is critical
for proper brain development.38 I agree with the American Thyroid
Association’s recommendation that all North American pregnant and
breast-feeding women receive a prenatal vitamin containing 150 mcg of
iodine daily.39</p>
<p>Consider Taking 250 mg of Pollutant-Free (Yeast- or Algae-Derived)
Long-Chain Omega-3s Daily</p>
<p>According to two of the most credible nutrition authorities, the
World Health Organization and the European Food Safety Authority, you
should get at least a half a percent of your calories from the
short-chain omega-3 ALA.40 That’s easy—the one Daily Dozen tablespoon of
ground flaxseeds takes care of that. Your body can then take the
short-chain omega-3 from flaxseeds (or chia seeds or walnuts) and
elongate it into the long-chain omega-3s EPA and DHA found in fish fat.
The question, however, is whether the body can make enough for optimal
brain health.41,42 Until we know more, I recommend taking 250 mg of
pollutant-free long-chain omega-3s directly.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend fish oil, since even purified (“distilled”) fish
oil has been found to be contaminated with considerable amounts of PCBs
and other pollutants, so much so that taken as directed, salmon,
herring, and tuna oils would exceed the tolerable daily intake of
toxicity.43 This may help explain the studies that found adverse effects
of fish consumption on cognitive function in both adults and children.
But many of those studies either were done downstream of a gold-mining
area contaminated with mercury, which is used in the mining process,44
or included people who ate whale meat or fish caught next to chemical
plants or toxic spills.45 What about fish you’d just get at a restaurant
or grocery store?</p>
<p>An elite group of Floridians (mostly corporate executives) was
studied. They ate so much seafood that at least 43 percent exceeded the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s safety limit for mercury, and it
appeared to have an effect. The researchers found that excessive seafood
intake, which they defined as more than around three to four servings
per month of such fish as tuna or snapper, elevates mercury levels and
appeared to cause cognitive dysfunction. The effect wasn’t large—only
about a 5 percent drop in cognitive performance—but “a decrement [in
executive function] that no one, let alone a health-conscious and
achievement-oriented person, is likely to welcome.”46</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can get the benefits without the risks by getting
long-chain omega-3s from algae instead,47 which is where the fish
primarily get it from to begin with.48 By cutting out the middle-fish
and getting EPA and DHA directly from the source at the bottom of the
food chain, you don’t have to worry about pollutant contamination. In
fact, the algae used for supplements are just grown in tanks and never
even come in contact with the ocean.49 That’s why I recommend a
contaminant-free source to get the best of both worlds, omega-3 levels
associated with brain preservation50 and minimized exposure to
industrial pollutants.</p>
<p>What About…?</p>
<p>All the other vitamins, minerals, and nutrients should be taken care
of by the mountains of nutrition you’ll be getting by centering your
diet around whole plant foods. And many of those nutrients are ones
Americans normally don’t get in sufficient quantity—namely, vitamins A,
C, and E and the minerals magnesium and potassium, along with fiber.51
Ninety-three percent of Americans don’t get enough vitamin E.
Ninety-seven percent of American adults don’t get enough fiber.52
Ninety-eight percent of American diets are deficient in potassium.53
You, my friend, are going to be the one in a thousand who does it
right.</p>
<p>If you have a specific question about some obscure nutrient—like,
“What about my molybdenum or menaquinones?”—rather than have me bore
everyone else with minutiae, allow me to refer you to the best reference
book available on plant-based nutrition by the preeminent dietitians
Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina.54 The authors go into great detail and
even have chapters on pregnancy, breast-feeding, and raising bouncing
boys and girls.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12-fortified plant-based diets can offer health benefits for
all stages of the life cycle.55 Dr. Benjamin Spock, the most esteemed
pediatrician of all time, wrote perhaps the bestselling American book of
the twentieth century: The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care. In
the seventh edition, the final one before Dr. Spock died at ninety-four,
he advocated children be raised on a plant-based diet with no exposure
to meat or dairy products. Dr. Spock had lived long enough to see the
beginnings of the childhood obesity epidemic. “Children who grow up
getting their nutrition from plant foods,” he wrote, “have a tremendous
health advantage and are much less likely to develop health problems as
the years go by.”56</p>
