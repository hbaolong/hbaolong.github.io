<h4 id="chapter-12-how-not-to-die-from-suicidal-depression">CHAPTER 12
How Not to Die from Suicidal Depression</h4>
<p>Healthy food can have a powerful effect on mood. But don’t take only
my word for it. Take Margaret’s too. After hearing me speak at her
church, she sent me this e-mail:</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Greger,</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with clinical depression by a psychiatrist when I was
ten years old. I spent all my teenage years and twenties on a cocktail
of medications for depression. Even on medications, I was still haunted
by intrusive thoughts of suicide on a daily basis. Worse yet, the
medications gave me headaches, nausea, and vivid, often frightening,
dreams. I was sleepy all the time, and despite the scary dreams, I had
to nap every day. I slept a lot—a couple of hours midday and then close
to ten hours every night. Even with these side effects, I was afraid not
to take these medications because I really wanted to live, and I was
scared that without meds I might get so depressed I would kill
myself.</p>
<p>Eventually I got married … and divorced. Was hospitalized several
times during my marriage for depression. To be honest, I just never had
any sex drive, and my husband took it personally. I guess I’ll never
know if my missing libido was just a side effect of all the medications
I was on or the depression itself.</p>
<p>About nine years ago, I heard you speak at my church. I realized I
had just spent the last two decades in a medication-induced haze. And
without ever really feeling good a single one of those days. I talked to
my psychiatrist about how I wanted to completely overhaul my diet and
try to back off the medications under her supervision. Much to my
surprise, she was supportive. Well, I’ve been whole food and plant based
for nine years and haven’t had a further relapse. Not that I haven’t
been sad from time to time but I haven’t had any more thoughts of
suicide or any more hospitalizations. I sleep like a normal person now!
Everyone tells me I am a different person since I changed my diet. I
just wanted to thank you. My fiancé would like to thank you too! I owe
you my life!</p>
<p>How can you prevent death by suicide? For those unfamiliar with the
ravages of mental illness, the flippant answer is: Just don’t do it. In
fact, death from other leading killers, such as heart disease, type 2
diabetes, and hypertension, may be just as much a choice as death from
suicide, since psychiatric disorders can cloud your judgment. Nearly
forty thousand Americans take their own lives each year,1 and depression
appears to be a leading cause.2 Thankfully, lifestyle interventions can
help repair your mind as well as your body.</p>
<p>In 1946, the World Health Organization defined health as “a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity.”3 In other words, you can be in
excellent physical shape—enjoying low cholesterol, a healthy body
weight, and good overall physical fitness—but that doesn’t necessarily
mean you’re healthy. Mental health can be just as important as physical
health.</p>
<p>Major depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental
illnesses. An estimated 7 percent of American adults suffer from serious
depression—that’s about sixteen million people who have at least one
depressive episode each year.4 Now, everyone feels sad occasionally. A
full range of emotions is part of what makes us human. Depression,
however, is not just sadness. It is characterized by weeks of such
symptoms as low or sad mood, diminished interest in activities that used
to be pleasurable, weight gain or loss, fatigue, inappropriate guilt,
difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death.</p>
<p>Indeed, major depression can be a life-threatening ailment.</p>
<p>Good mental health isn’t “merely the absence of disease,” though.
Just because you’re not depressed doesn’t necessarily mean you’re happy.
There are twenty times more studies published on health and depression
than there are on health and happiness.5 In recent years, however, the
field of “positive psychology” has emerged, focusing on the relationship
between optimal mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Growing evidence indicates that positive psychological well-being is
associated with reduced risk of physical illness, but which came first?
Are people healthier because they’re happy, or are people just happier
because they’re healthy?</p>
<p>Prospective studies that follow individuals over time have found that
people starting out happier do indeed end up healthier. An analysis of
seventy such studies on mortality concluded that “positive psychological
well-being has a favorable effect on survival in both healthy and
diseased populations.”6 Those who are happier appear to live longer.</p>
<p>Not so fast, though. While positive mental states may be associated
with less stress and more resilience to infection, positive well-being
might also be accompanied by a healthy lifestyle. In general, people who
feel satisfied appear to smoke less, exercise more, and eat healthier.7
So is being happier just a marker of good health and not a cause of it?
To find out, researchers set out to make people sick.</p>
<p>Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University took hundreds of
individuals—some happy, some unhappy—and paid them 00 each to be allowed
to drip the common cold virus into their noses. Even if someone with a
cold sneezes right into your face and the virus gets into your nose, you
won’t get sick automatically, because your immune system may be able to
fight it off. So the study question was: Whose immune system would be
better at fighting off a common virus—those in the group initially rated
as happy, peppy, and relaxed, or those in the group who were anxious,
hostile, and depressed?</p>
<p>About one in three of the negative-emotion individuals failed to
successfully fight off the virus and came down with a cold. But only one
in five of the happy individuals became sick, even after the researchers
took into account such factors as subjects’ sleep patterns, exercise
habits, and stress levels.8 In a subsequent study, the researchers even
exposed subjects (who had also been paid) to the influenza virus, a more
serious infection. Once again, increased positive emotions were
associated with decreased verified illness rates.9 Happier people, it
seems, are less likely to get sick.</p>
<p>So mental health does appear to play a part in physical health.
That’s why it’s crucial that the food you eat support both your mind and
your body. As you’ll see, common foods from leafy green vegetables to
your basic garden-variety tomato may positively affect your brain
chemistry and help ward off depression. In fact, even simply smelling a
common spice may improve your emotional state.</p>
<p>But avoiding the blues is not just about eating your greens. There
are also components in certain foods that may increase the risk of
depression, such as arachidonic acid, an inflammation-promoting compound
found mostly in chicken and eggs in the diet that is blamed for
potentially impairing mood by inflaming the brain.</p>
<p>Arachidonic Acid</p>
<p>Studies on the emotional health and mood states of those eating
plant-based diets suggest that eating less meat isn’t just good for us
physically; it’s good for us emotionally too. Researchers employed two
psychological tests, the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the
Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). POMS measures levels of
depression, anger, hostility, fatigue, and confusion. The DASS gauges
other negative mood states as well, including hopelessness, lack of
interest, anhedonia (lack of pleasure), agitation, irritability, and
impatience with other people. Subjects eating plant-based diets appeared
to experience significantly fewer negative emotions than omnivores.
Those eating better also reported feeling more “vigor.”10</p>
<p>The researchers offered two explanations for their findings. First,
people eating better diets may be happier because they’re healthier.11
Those eating plant-based diets don’t just have lower rates of many of
the leading killer diseases but also appear to have lower rates of such
annoying ills as hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and ulcers; fewer
surgeries; fewer hospitalizations; and only about half the odds of being
on drugs, including tranquilizers, aspirin, insulin, blood pressure
pills, pain medications, antacids, laxatives, or sleeping pills.12
(Being able to avoid doctor visits and health insurance hassles would
make anyone less irritable, stressed, and depressed!)</p>
<p>The researchers also suggested a more direct explanation for their
results: Maybe the proinflammatory compound arachidonic acid found in
animal products can “adversely impact mental health via a cascade of
neuroinflammation.”13 The body metabolizes arachidonic acid into an
array of inflammatory chemicals. In fact, that’s how anti-inflammatory
drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen work to relieve pain and swelling—by
blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid into these inflammatory end
products. Maybe the mental health of omnivores was being comparatively
compromised by inflammation in their brains.</p>
<p>Inflammation isn’t always bad, of course. When the area around a
splinter gets all red, hot, and swollen, it’s a sign that the body is
using arachidonic acid to mount an inflammatory response to help fight
off infection. But your body already makes all the arachidonic acid you
need, so you don’t need to take in any more via your diet.14 In this
way, arachidonic acid resembles cholesterol, another essential component
that the body makes all on its own: When you add excess amounts through
diet, it may upset your system’s internal balance.15 In this particular
case, the researchers suspected arachidonic acid intake might impair the
body’s emotional state. There are data suggesting that people with
higher levels of arachidonic acid in their blood may end up at
significantly higher risk of suicide and episodes of major
depression.16</p>
<p>The top-five sources of arachidonic acid in the American diet are
chicken, eggs, beef, pork, and fish, although chicken and eggs alone
contribute more than the other top sources combined.17 Just a single
egg’s worth of arachidonic acid a day may significantly raise
arachidonic acid levels in the blood.18 Overall, omnivores appear to
consume about nine times more arachidonic acid than those eating
plant-based diets.19</p>
<p>The study showing improved moods and emotional states in those eating
plant-based diets was a cross-sectional study, meaning it was a snapshot
in time. What if people who start out mentally healthier go on to eat
healthier, too, and not the other way around? To show cause and effect,
researchers would have to perform an interventional study, the gold
standard of nutritional science: Gather subjects, change their diets,
and see what happens. The same research team did just that. They took
men and women who ate meat at least once a day and took away their eggs
and chicken, along with other meats, to see what would happen to their
moods. Within just two weeks, the study subjects experienced a
significant improvement in measures of their mood states.20 The
researchers concluded: “Perhaps eating less meat can help protect mood
in omnivores, particularly important in those susceptible to affective
disorders [such as depression].”21</p>
<p>Given these results, another research team decided to put a healthy
diet to the test in a workplace setting, where healthy bodies and minds
could potentially translate into improved productivity—and elevate the
mood of shareholders as well. A group of overweight and diabetic
employees at a major insurance company was encouraged to follow a
whole-food, plant-based diet, cutting out all meat, eggs, dairy, oil,
and junk foods. There was no portion-size restriction, no calorie
counting, and no carb tracking, and participants were explicitly told
not to change their exercise habits. Meals were not provided, but the
company cafeteria did start offering such daily options as bean burritos
and lentil and minestrone soups. A control group of employees received
no dietary advice.22</p>
<p>Despite the dietary restrictions, over the course of about five
months, the plant-eating group reported greater diet satisfaction than
the control group. How well did they do? The plant-based group
experienced improved digestion, increased energy, and better sleep, as
well as significant improvement in their physical functioning, general
health, vitality, and mental health. No surprise, then, that they showed
measurable improvements in work productivity too.23</p>
<p>Based on this success, a much larger study of plant-based nutrition
was conducted at ten corporate locations across the country from San
Diego, California, to Macon, Georgia. The same resounding success was
reported, showing improvements not only in subjects’ body weight, blood
sugar levels, and ability to control cholesterol24 but also in their
emotional states, including depression, anxiety, fatigue, sense of
well-being, and daily functioning.25</p>
<p>Fighting the Blues with Greens</p>
<p>Here’s a statistic you probably haven’t heard: Higher consumption of
vegetables may cut the odds of developing depression by as much as 62
percent.26 A review in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience concluded
that, in general, eating lots of fruits and veggies may present “a
non-invasive, natural, and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a
healthy brain.”27</p>
<p>But how, exactly?</p>
<p>The traditional explanation of how depression works, known as the
monoamine theory, proposes that the condition arises out of a chemical
imbalance in the brain. The billions of nerves in your brain communicate
with each other using chemicals called neurotransmitters. Your nerve
cells don’t physically touch one another. Instead, they manufacture and
deploy neurotransmitters to bridge the gap between them. The levels of
an important class of neurotransmitters called monoamines, which
includes serotonin and dopamine, are controlled by an enzyme called
monoamine oxidase (known as MAO) that breaks down any excess monoamines.
People who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of this enzyme
in their brains.28 Thus, the theory goes, depression is caused by
abnormally low levels of monoamine neurotransmitters due to elevated
levels of the neurotransmitter-munching enzyme.</p>
<p>Antidepressant medications were developed to try to boost the levels
of neurotransmitters to offset their accelerated breakdown. But if the
excess MAO is responsible for depression, why not just develop a drug
that blocks this enzyme? Such drugs do exist, but they have serious
risks—not the least of which is the dreaded “cheese effect,” in which
eating certain foods (such as certain cheeses, cured meats, and
fermented foods) while on the drug can potentially cause fatal brain
hemorrhaging.29</p>
<p>If only there were a way to tamp down the monoamine oxidase enzyme
safely. Well, it turns out that many plant foods, including apples,
berries, grapes, onions, and green tea, contain phytonutrients that
appear to naturally inhibit the MAO, as do such spices as cloves,
oregano, cinnamon, and nutmeg.30 This may help explain why those eating
plant-rich diets have lower rates of depression.31</p>
<p>Even on a day-to-day basis, studies have shown that the more fruits
and vegetables you eat, the happier, calmer, and more energetic you may
feel that day—and this positivity can spill over into the next day. For
your diet to have a meaningful psychological impact, though, you may
need to consume approximately seven servings of fruits or eight servings
of vegetables each day.32</p>
<p>Seeds and Serotonin</p>
<p>Although some plant foods contain significant amounts of serotonin,33
the so-called happiness hormone, serotonin can’t cross the blood-brain
barrier. This means that dietary sources of serotonin can’t make it into
the brain, but the building block of serotonin, an amino acid called
tryptophan, can get from your mouth to your blood to your brain.
Tryptophan depletion experiments in the 1970s showed that people given
specially concocted tryptophan-deficient diets suffered from
irritability, anger, and depression.34 So if you give people extra
tryptophan, will they feel better?</p>
<p>That’s the theory. However, in the 1980s, certain tryptophan
supplements created a debacle, causing a rash of deaths.35 But if
tryptophan is an amino acid and if proteins are made out of amino acids,
why can’t you just give people high-protein meals to boost their
serotonin levels by delivering extra tryptophan to the brain? It’s been
tried, and it’s failed,36 likely because other amino acids in
protein-rich foods crowd out the tryptophan for access to the brain.
However, carbohydrate ingestion does the opposite: It helps shunt many
nontryptophan amino acids out from the bloodstream and into the muscles,
allowing tryptophan greater access into the brain. For example, having a
carb-rich breakfast like waffles and orange juice resulted in higher
tryptophan levels in those studied than did a protein-rich breakfast of
turkey, eggs, and cheese.37</p>
<p>This principle may explain why women suffering from premenstrual
syndrome (PMS) sometimes crave carbohydrate-rich food. Consumption of
even a single carb-rich, protein-poor meal has been shown to improve
depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and
calmness scores among women with PMS.38 In a yearlong study, about one
hundred men and women were randomly assigned to eat either a low-carb or
high-carb diet. By the end of the year, the subjects eating the
high-carb diets experienced significantly less depression, hostility,
and mood disturbance than those in the low-carb group. This result is
consistent with studies finding better moods and less anxiety among
populations eating diets higher in carbohydrates and lower in fats and
protein.39</p>
<p>Carbohydrates may facilitate tryptophan transport into the brain, but
you would still need a dietary source. Ideally, it would have a high
tryptophan-to-protein ratio to facilitate brain access.40 Such seeds as
sesame, sunflower, or pumpkin may fit the bill. Indeed, a double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial of butternut squash seeds for social anxiety
disorder reported a significant improvement in an objective measurement
in anxiety within an hour of consumption.41 All of these factors may
contribute to the comprehensive improvement in mood one may achieve
after just a few weeks on a plant-based diet.42</p>
<p>Saffron</p>
<p>The earliest recorded medical use of a spice appears to be more than
3,600 years ago, when saffron was evidently first used for healing.43 A
few thousand years later, scientists finally put saffron to the test in
a head-to-head trial against the antidepressant drug Prozac for the
treatment of clinical depression. Both the spice and the drug worked
equally well in reducing depression symptoms.44 As you can see in the
box here, this may not be saying much, but at the very least, the
saffron was safer in terms of side effects. For example, 20 percent of
people in the Prozac group suffered sexual dysfunction, a common
occurrence with many antidepressant medications, whereas no one in the
saffron group did.</p>
<p>However, saffron may be one of those rare cases in which the natural
remedy is more expensive than the drug. Saffron is the world’s most
expensive spice. It is harvested from crocus flowers, specifically the
dried stigmas (the threadlike tips inside the flower), which are ground
up to make the spice. You need more than fifty thousand crocuses—enough
to cover a football field—to produce just a single pound of
saffron.45</p>
<p>A Prozac-equivalent dose of saffron may cost more than twice as much
as the drug, but a subsequent study found that even just smelling
saffron appeared to have psychological benefits. Though researchers
diluted the spice so much that the study subjects couldn’t detect its
odor, they still noted a significant drop in stress hormones measured in
women who sniffed the saffron for twenty minutes compared with those who
spent twenty minutes smelling a placebo, along with significant
improvement in the women’s symptoms of anxiety.46</p>
<p>So if you’re feeling anxious, perhaps wake up and smell the
saffron.</p>
<p>Coffee and Aspartame</p>
<p>Speaking of waking up to pleasant aromas, a cup of coffee may be
doing more for the brain than making it feel less groggy in the morning.
Researchers from Harvard University looked at data from three
large-scale cohort studies of more than two hundred thousand American
men and women. They found that people who drank two or more cups of
coffee daily appeared to have about only half the suicide risk compared
to non-coffee drinkers.47 What about drinking more than four cups a day?
A Kaiser Permanente study of more than one hundred thousand people found
that suicide risk seemed to continue to drop with increases in coffee
dose. People who drank more than six cups a day were 80 percent less
likely to commit suicide,48 though drinking eight or more cups a day has
been associated with increased suicide risk.49</p>
<p>What you put in your coffee may also make a difference. The NIH-AARP
study, which followed hundreds of thousands of Americans for a decade,
found that frequent consumption of sweetened beverages may increase the
risk of depression among older adults. Indeed, adding sugar to coffee
may negate many of its positive effects on mood, and adding the
artificial sweetener aspartame (found in Equal and NutraSweet) or
saccharine (in Sweet’n Low) was associated with an increased risk of
depression.50</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding the neurological effects of aspartame
began in the 1980s.51 At first, concern was limited to those with
preexisting mental illness. An early study at Case Western Reserve
University was halted prematurely for safety reasons because subjects
with a history of depression appeared to be experiencing such severe
reactions to the sweetener. The researchers concluded that “individuals
with mood disorders are particularly sensitive to this artificial
sweetener and its use in this population should be discouraged.”52</p>
<p>Only recently were the neurobehavioral effects of aspartame
investigated in a population free from mental illness. Healthy
individuals were split into two groups—half were given a higher dose of
aspartame (the equivalent of about three liters of Diet Coke’s worth)
and the other half received a lower dose (a single liter of Diet Coke’s
worth). Then the groups switched.53 Bear in mind that the
higher-aspartame diet contained just half the acceptable daily intake of
the stuff, as determined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.54
After only eight days on the higher-aspartame dose, participants
exhibited more depression and irritability and performed worse on
certain brain function tests.55 So not only may aspartame cause adverse
mental effects in sensitive populations but it may also harm the general
public at sufficient doses.</p>
<p>Avoiding diet soda and those pastel paper packets seems easy enough,
but artificial sweeteners are also present in more than six thousand
products,56 including breath mints, cereals, chewing gums, jams and
jellies, juice drinks, puddings, and even nutritional bars and
yogurts.57 This prevalence has led researchers to assert that aspartame
“is impossible to completely eradicate from daily encounters.”58 But, of
course, that’s only true for people who eat processed foods. This is yet
another reason to spend most of your time at the grocery store in the
produce aisle. Discriminating shoppers make it a priority to read
ingredients lists, but the healthiest foods in the supermarket don’t
even have them.</p>

<p>Exercise versus Antidepressants</p>
<p>We’ve known for decades that even a single workout can elevate mood59
and that physical activity is associated with decreased symptoms of
depression. One study of nearly five thousand people across the country,
for example, found that people who exercised regularly had 25 percent
lower odds of a major depression diagnosis.60</p>
<p>Of course, studies like these may not mean that exercise reduces
depression. Maybe it means that depression reduces exercise. In other
words, if you’re depressed, you might feel too lousy to get out of bed
and go for a walk. What was needed to test this idea was an
interventional study, one in which depressed subjects were split at
random (randomized) into two groups, one that exercised and one that
didn’t.</p>
<p>That’s what a team of researchers from Duke University attempted.
They randomly assigned depressed men and women aged fifty or older to
either begin an aerobic exercise program or take the antidepressant drug
sertraline (Zoloft). Within four months, the mood of those in the drug
group improved so much that they were, on average, no longer depressed.
But the same powerful effect was found in the exercise group—that is,
the group of people who weren’t taking any drugs. Exercise, it seemed,
works about as well as medication.61</p>
<p>Let’s play devil’s advocate for a moment: The drug-free group in the
Duke study met three times each week for an exercise class. Could the
social stimulation rather than the exercise have improved their mood?
With this question in mind, the same researchers subsequently conducted
the largest-ever exercise trial of patients with depression. This time,
they added a group, so one group took antidepressants, one group took an
exercise class, and a new group did exercises by themselves at home. The
results? No matter the setting—whether subjects were alone or in a
group—exercise appeared to work about as well as drugs at bringing
depression into remission.62</p>
<p>So before your doctor writes you a prescription for an
antidepressant, ask about prescribing a daily workout instead.</p>
<hr />
<p>Antioxidants and Folate</p>
<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that free radicals—those highly
unstable molecules that cause tissue damage and contribute to aging—may
play an important role in the development of various psychiatric
disorders, including depression.63 Modern imaging techniques confirm
autopsy studies showing a shrinkage of certain emotion centers in the
brains of depressed patients that may be due to death of nerve cells in
these areas caused by free radicals.64</p>
<p>This phenomenon may help explain why those who eat more fruits and
vegetables, which are rich in the antioxidants that extinguish free
radicals, appear protected against depression. A study of nearly three
hundred thousand Canadians found that greater fruit and vegetable
consumption was associated with lower risk of depression, psychological
distress, mood and anxiety disorders, and poor perceived mental health.
The researchers concluded that eating antioxidant-rich plant foods “may
dampen the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on mental
health.”65</p>
<p>The Canadian study relied on questionnaires asking people to
self-report fruit and vegetable intake, a method that’s not always
accurate. A nationwide American study took it one step further and
measured the level of carotenoid phytonutrients in people’s
bloodstreams. These phytonutrients include some of the yellow, orange,
and red antioxidant pigments found naturally in some of our healthiest
foods, including sweet potatoes and green leafy vegetables. Not only did
people with higher levels of these nutrients in their bloodstreams have
a lower risk of depression symptoms but there was also an apparent
“dose-response relationship,” meaning that the higher the level of
phytonutrients, the better people seemed to feel.66</p>
<p>Among the carotenoids, lycopene (the red pigment in tomatoes) has the
highest antioxidant activity. Indeed, a study of nearly one thousand
elderly men and women found that people who ate tomatoes or tomato
products daily had just half the odds of depression compared with those
who ate them once a week or less.67</p>
<p>If antioxidants are so helpful, why can’t we just pop a few
antioxidant pills? Well, only food sources of antioxidants appear to be
protectively associated with depression. The same can’t be said for
dietary supplements.68 This finding may indicate that the form and
delivery of the antioxidants we consume are crucial to ensure their best
effects. Alternatively, antioxidants may just be a marker for other
components of plant-rich diets, such as folate.</p>
<p>Folate is a B vitamin concentrated in beans and greens. (Its name
comes from the Latin word folium, meaning “leaf,” because it was first
isolated in spinach.) Early studies linking depression to low folate
levels in the blood were cross-sectional in nature, meaning they were
only snapshots in time. For this reason, we didn’t know whether low
folate intake led to depression or if depression itself led to low
folate intake.69 However, more recent studies following people over time
suggest that low dietary folate intake may indeed increase the risk of
severe depression by as much as threefold.70 However, once again, folate
supplements (folic acid) do not appear to help.71</p>
<p>Vegetables—including antioxidant-rich tomatoes and folate-packed
greens—may be good for the body and the mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do Antidepressant Drugs Really Work?</p>
<p>We’ve seen that saffron and exercise compare favorably to drugs in
treating depression, but how much is that really saying? Thousands of
published studies seem to have demonstrated that antidepressant drugs
are effective.72 The key word here, though, may be published. What if
drug companies decided to publish only those studies that showed a
positive effect but quietly shelved and concealed any studies showing
the drugs didn’t work? To find out if this was the case, researchers
applied to the Food and Drug Administration under the U.S. Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) to get access to the published and unpublished
studies submitted by pharmaceutical companies. What they found was
shocking.</p>
<p>According to the published literature, the results of nearly all
antidepressant trials were positive. In contrast, FDA analysis of trial
data—including the unpublished studies—demonstrated that roughly half of
the trials showed the drugs didn’t work after all. When all the
data—published and unpublished—were combined, antidepressants failed to
show a clinically significant advantage over placebo sugar pills.73 This
finding suggests that the placebo effect explains the apparent clinical
effectiveness of antidepressants. In other words, improvements in mood
may be a result of the patient’s belief in the power of the drug—not the
drug itself.74</p>
<p>Even worse, the FOIA documents revealed that the FDA knew that these
drugs—such as Paxil and Prozac—didn’t work much better than placebo yet
made an explicit decision to shield drug companies by keeping this
information from the public and prescribing physicians.75 How could drug
companies get away with this? The pharmaceutical industry is considered
one of the most profitable and politically powerful industries in the
United States, and mental illness is considered a golden goose: chronic,
common, and often treated with multiple drugs.76 Indeed, antidepressants
are currently prescribed to more than 8 percent of the population.77</p>
<p>Just because antidepressant drugs may not work better than fake pills
doesn’t mean they don’t work at all. Antidepressants offer substantial
benefits to millions of people suffering from depression. And although
the placebo effect is real and powerful, antidepressants do seem to beat
out sugar pills in reducing symptoms in the most severely
depressed—perhaps about 10 percent of patients (although admittedly,
this statistic also means that about 90 percent of depressed patients
may be prescribed medication with negligible benefit).78</p>
<p>If doctors are willing to give patients placebo-equivalent
treatments, some argue that it would be better for them to just lie to
patients and give them actual sugar pills.79 Unlike the drugs, sugar
pills do not cause side effects. For example, antidepressants cause
sexual dysfunction in up to three-quarters of users. Other problems may
include long-term weight gain and insomnia. And about one in five people
have withdrawal symptoms when they try to quit.80</p>
<p>Perhaps most tragically, antidepressants may make people more likely
to become depressed in the future. Studies show that patients are more
likely to become depressed again after treatment with antidepressants
than after treatment by other means, including placebos.81 So even if
the mood-boosting benefit of exercise is also a placebo effect, at least
it’s one with benefits rather than risks.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just reading the dry statistics in all the studies, it’s hard to
appreciate the suffering. Seeing a graph in which depression scores drop
for even hundreds of people doesn’t hit me on the same gut level as
seeing a single e-mail in my inbox of someone sharing his or her story
of physical and emotional renewal.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a woman wrote to me about her battle with depression.
Shay, in her forties, had always stuck to the standard American diet. In
recent years, she had been suffering from severe migraines, unbearable
constipation, and painful and irregular menstrual cycles. Meanwhile, her
depression had become so bad that she was unable to go to work. Then
Shay discovered my website and began educating herself about nutrition.
Soon she came to understand how the Western diet was potentially
contributing to her health problems, not to mention her unhappiness, and
she became an ardent watcher of NutritionFacts.org videos.</p>
<p>Shay decided to switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet. She stopped
eating animal products and junk and vastly increased her intake of
fruits and vegetables. After four weeks, she had more energy and
less-painful bowel movements. Within seven months, her bowel movements
were effortless, her once-crippling migraines had stopped altogether,
her periods were more regular, less painful, and shorter—and her
depression was gone. Just months earlier, Shay had felt so bad that she
couldn’t get out of bed in the morning. But by improving her diet, she
is now much healthier, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>That is a great example of the power of a healthy diet.</p>
