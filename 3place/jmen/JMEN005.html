<h4 id="chapter-2-how-not-to-die-from-lung-diseases">CHAPTER 2 How Not
to Die from Lung Diseases</h4>
<p>The worst death I ever witnessed was that of a man dying of lung
cancer. I was interning at a public health hospital in Boston.
Evidently, people dying behind bars looked bad for prison statistics, so
terminally ill prisoners were shipped to my hospital for their final
days, even if there was little we could do for them.</p>
<p>It was summer, and the prisoners’ ward had no air-conditioning, at
least for the inmates. We doctors could retreat to the chilled confines
of the nursing station, but the inmates, handcuffed to their beds, just
lay prostrate in the heat on that top floor of the tall, brick building.
When they were shuffled down the hall in front of us, ankles chained
together, they left a trail of sweat.</p>
<p>The night the man died, I was on one of my thirty-six-hour shifts. We
worked 117-hour workweeks back then. It’s amazing we didn’t kill more
people ourselves. Overnight, there were only two of us—myself and a
moonlighting doctor who preferred to sleep for his ,000 paycheck. So
most of the time I was on my own to cover the hundreds of patients
there, some of the sickest of the sick. It was on one of those nights
that, staggering through a sleep-deprived haze, I got the call.</p>
<p>Up until then, all the deaths I had seen were those in which the
patient was either dead on arrival or had died during cardiac “codes,”
when we try desperately, and nearly always unsuccessfully, to
resuscitate.</p>
<p>This man was different.</p>
<p>He was wide-eyed, gasping for air, his cuffed hands clawing at the
bed. The cancer was filling up his lungs with fluid. He was being
drowned by lung cancer.</p>
<p>While he thrashed desperately, pleading, my mind was in medical mode,
all protocols and procedures, but nothing much could be done. The man
needed morphine, but that was held on the other side of the ward, and
I’d never get to it in time, let alone back to him. I was not popular on
the prison floor. I had once reported a guard for beating a sick inmate
and was rewarded with death threats. There was no way they’d let me
through the gates fast enough. I begged the nurse to try to get some,
but she didn’t make it back in time.</p>
<p>The man’s coughing turned to gurgling. “Everything’s going to be
okay,” I said. Immediately, I thought, What a stupid thing to say to
someone choking to death. Just another lie in probably a long line of
condescension from other authority figures throughout his life.
Helpless, I turned from doctor back to human being. I took his hand in
my own, which he then gripped with all his might, tugging me toward his
tear-streaked, panic-stricken face. “I’m here,” I said. “I’m right
here.” Our gaze remained locked as he suffocated right in front of me.
It felt like watching someone being tortured to death.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. Now imagine what it would feel like not to be
able to breathe. We all need to take care of our lungs.</p>
<hr />
<p>America’s number-two killer, lung disease, claims the lives of about
300,000 people each year. And like our number-one domestic killer, heart
disease, it’s largely preventable. Lung disease can come in many forms,
but the three types that kill the most people are lung cancer, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma.</p>
<p>Lung cancer is our number-one cancer killer. Most of the 160,000 lung
cancer deaths every year are the direct result of smoking. However, a
healthy diet may help mitigate the DNA-damaging effects of tobacco
smoke, as well as perhaps help prevent lung cancer from spreading.</p>
<p>COPD kills approximately 140,000 people annually, from either damage
to the walls of tiny air sacs in the lungs (emphysema) or from inflamed
and thickened airways plugged with thick mucus (chronic bronchitis).
Although there is no cure for the permanent lung scarring that COPD
causes, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may help slow the
progression of the disease and improve lung function for its thirteen
million sufferers.</p>
<p>Finally, asthma, which claims 3,000 lives each year, is one of the
most common chronic diseases among children, yet it may be largely
preventable with a healthier diet. Research suggests a few extra daily
servings of fruits and vegetables can reduce both the number of cases of
asthma during childhood and the number of asthma attacks among people
with the disease.</p>
<p>LUNG CANCER</p>
<p>Lung cancer is diagnosed about 220,000 times each year in the United
States and causes more deaths annually than the next three cancers
combined—those of the colon, breast, and pancreas.1 At any given moment,
nearly 400,000 Americans are living under lung cancer’s dark shadow.2
Unlike with heart disease, which has yet to be fully acknowledged as the
direct result of an artery-clogging diet, there is widespread
recognition that tobacco is by far the most common cause of lung cancer.
According to the American Lung Association, smoking tobacco contributes
to up to 90 percent of all lung cancer deaths. Men who smoke are
twenty-three times more likely and women thirteen times more likely to
develop lung cancer than nonsmokers. And smokers aren’t just harming
themselves; thousands of deaths each year have been attributed to
secondhand smoke. Nonsmokers have a 20–30 percent higher risk of
developing lung cancer if they’re regularly exposed to cigarette
smoke.3</p>
<p>Those warning labels on cigarette packs are everywhere now, but for a
long time, the link between smoking and lung cancer was suppressed by
powerful interest groups—much as the relationship between certain foods
and other leading killers is suppressed today. For example, in the
1980s, Philip Morris, the nation’s leading cigarette manufacturer,
launched the notorious Whitecoat Project. The corporation hired doctors
to publish ghostwritten studies purporting to negate links between
secondhand smoke and lung disease. These papers cherry-picked various
scientific reports to conceal and distort the damning evidence of the
dangers of secondhand smoke. This whitewashing, coupled with the tobacco
industry’s clever marketing campaigns, including cartoonlike ads, helped
hook generations of Americans onto their products.4</p>
<p>If, despite all the evidence and warnings, you’re currently a smoker,
the most important step you can take is to stop. Now. Please. The
benefits of quitting are immediate. According to the American Cancer
Society, just twenty minutes after quitting, your heart rate and blood
pressure drop. Within a few weeks, your blood circulation and lung
function improve. Within a few months, the sweeper cells that help clean
the lungs, remove mucus, and reduce the risk of infection start to
regrow. And within a year of quitting, your smoking-related risk of
coronary heart disease becomes half that of current smokers.5 As we saw
in chapter 1, the human body possesses a miraculous ability to heal
itself as long as we don’t keep reinjuring it. Simple dietary changes
may help to roll back the damage wrought by the carcinogens in tobacco
smoke.</p>
<p>Load Up on Broccoli</p>
<p>First, it’s important to understand the toxic effects of cigarettes
on the lungs. Tobacco smoke contains chemicals that weaken the body’s
immune system, making it more susceptible to disease and handicapping
its ability to destroy cancer cells. At the same time, tobacco smoke can
damage cell DNA, increasing the chance for cancer cells to form and
flourish in the first place.6</p>
<p>To test the power of dietary interventions to prevent DNA damage,
scientists often study chronic smokers. Researchers rounded up a group
of longtime smokers and asked them to consume twenty-five times more
broccoli than the average American—in other words, a single stalk a day.
Compared to broccoli-avoiding smokers, the broccoli-eating smokers
suffered 41 percent fewer DNA mutations in their bloodstream over ten
days. Is that just because the broccoli boosted the activity of the
detoxifying enzymes in their livers, which helped clear carcinogens
before they even made it to the smokers’ cells? No, even when DNA was
extracted from the subjects’ bodies and exposed to a known DNA-damaging
chemical, the genetic material from the broccoli eaters showed
significantly less damage, suggesting that eating vegetables like
broccoli may make you more resilient at a subcellular level.7</p>
<p>Now, don’t think this means that eating a stalk of broccoli before
smoking a pack of Marlboro Reds is going to completely erase the
cancer-causing effects of cigarette smoke. It won’t. But as you’re
trying to quit, such vegetables as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower
may help prevent further damage.</p>
<p>The benefits of broccoli-family (cruciferous) vegetables may not stop
there. While breast cancer is the most common internal cancer among
American women, lung cancer is actually their number-one killer. About
85 percent of women with breast cancer are still alive five years after
diagnosis, but the numbers are reversed when it comes to lung cancer: 85
percent of women die within five years of a lung cancer diagnosis.
Ninety percent of those deaths are due to metastasis, the spread of the
cancer to other parts of the body.8</p>
<p>Certain compounds in broccoli may have the potential to suppress this
metastatic spread. In a 2010 study, scientists laid down a layer of
human lung cancer cells in a petri dish and cleared a swath down the
middle. Within twenty-four hours, the cancer cells had crept back
together, and within thirty hours, the gap had closed completely. But
when the scientists dripped some cruciferous-vegetable compounds onto
the cancer cells, the cancer creep was stunted.9 Whether or not eating
broccoli will help prolong survival in cancer patients has yet to be
tested in clinical trials, but the nice thing about healthy dietary
interventions is that since they have no downsides, they can be added to
whatever other treatments one chooses.</p>
<hr />
<p>Smoking Versus Kale</p>
<p>Researchers have found that kale—that dark-green, leafy vegetable
dubbed the “queen of greens”—might help control cholesterol levels.
Researchers took thirty men with high cholesterol and had them consume
three to four shots of kale juice a day for three months. That’s like
eating thirty pounds’ worth of kale, or the amount the average American
consumes in about a century. So what happened? Did they turn green and
start to photosynthesize?</p>
<p>No. What the kale did do was substantially lower their bad (LDL)
cholesterol and boost their good (HDL) cholesterol10 as much as running
three hundred miles.11 By the end of the study, the antioxidant activity
in the blood of most participants had shot up. But curiously, the
antioxidant activity in a minority remained flat. Sure enough, these
were the smokers. The free radicals created by the cigarettes were
thought to have actively depleted the body of antioxidants. When your
smoking habit erases the antioxidant-boosting effects of eight hundred
cups of kale, you know it’s time to quit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Carcinogen-Blocking Effects of Turmeric</p>
<p>The Indian spice turmeric, which gives curry powder its
characteristic golden color, may also help prevent some of the DNA
damage caused by smoking. Since 1987, the National Cancer Institute has
tested more than a thousand different compounds for “chemopreventive”
(cancer-preventing) activity. Only a few dozen have made it to clinical
trials, but among the most promising is curcumin, the bright-yellow
pigment in turmeric.12</p>
<p>Chemopreventive agents can be classified into different subgroups
based on which stage of cancer development they help to fight:
Carcinogen blockers and antioxidants help prevent the initial triggering
DNA mutation, and antiproliferatives work by keeping tumors from growing
and spreading. Curcumin is special in that it appears to belong to all
three groups, meaning it may potentially help prevent and/or arrest
cancer cell growth.13</p>
<p>Researchers have investigated the effects of curcumin on the
DNA-mutating ability of various carcinogens and found that curcumin was
indeed an effective antimutagen against several common cancer-causing
substances.14 But these experiments were done in vitro, meaning
effectively in a laboratory test tube. After all, it wouldn’t be ethical
to expose humans to nasty carcinogens to observe whether they got
cancer. However, someone got the bright idea of finding a group of
people who already, of their own accord, had carcinogens coursing
through their veins. Smokers!</p>
<p>One way to measure the level of DNA-mutating chemicals in peoples’
bodies is dripping their urine on bacteria growing in a petri dish.
Bacteria, like all life on Earth, share DNA as a common genetic
language. Unsurprisingly, scientists who tried this experiment found
that the urine from nonsmokers caused far fewer DNA mutations—after all,
they had a lot fewer carcinogens flowing through their systems. But when
the smokers were given turmeric, the DNA-mutation rate dropped by up to
38 percent.15 They weren’t given curcumin pills; they merely got less
than a teaspoon a day of just the regular turmeric spice you’d find at
the grocery store. Of course, turmeric can’t completely mitigate the
effects of smoking. Even after the participants ate turmeric for a
month, the DNA-damaging ability of the smokers’ urine still exceeded
that of the nonsmokers’. But smokers who make turmeric a staple of their
diets may help lessen some of the damage.</p>
<p>The anticancer effects of curcumin extend beyond its ability to
potentially prevent DNA mutations. It also appears to help regulate
programmed cell death. Your cells are preprogrammed to die naturally to
make way for fresh cells through a process known as apoptosis (from the
Greek ptosis, falling, and apo, away from). In a sense, your body is
rebuilding itself every few months16 with the building materials you
provide it through your diet. Some cells, however, overstay their
welcome—namely, cancer cells. By somehow disabling their own suicide
mechanism, they don’t die when they’re supposed to. Because they
continue to thrive and divide, cancer cells can eventually form tumors
and potentially spread throughout the body.</p>
<p>So how does curcumin affect this process? It appears to have the
ability to reprogram the self-destruct mechanism back into cancer cells.
All cells contain so-called death receptors that trigger the
self-destruction sequence, but cancer cells can disable their own death
receptors. Curcumin, however, appears able to reactivate them.17
Curcumin can also kill cancer cells directly by activating “execution
enzymes” called caspases inside cancer cells that destroy them from
within by chopping up their proteins.18 Unlike most chemotherapy drugs,
against which cancer cells can develop resistance over time, curcumin
affects several mechanisms of cell death simultaneously, making it
potentially harder for cancer cells to avoid destruction.19</p>
<p>Curcumin has been found to be effective against a variety of other
cancer cells in vitro, including those of the breast, brain, blood,
colon, kidney, liver, lungs, and skin. For reasons not fully understood,
curcumin seems to leave noncancerous cells alone.20 Unfortunately,
turmeric has yet to be tested in clinical trials for the prevention or
treatment of lung cancer, but with no downsides at culinary doses, I’d
suggest trying to find ways to incorporate the spice into your diet. I
offer a number of suggestions in part 2.</p>
<p>Dietary Secondhand Smoke</p>
<p>Though the majority of lung cancer is attributed to smoking,
approximately a quarter of all cases occur in people who’ve never
smoked.21 Although some of these cases are due to secondhand smoke,
another contributing cause may be another potentially carcinogenic
plume: fumes from frying.</p>
<p>When fat is heated to frying temperatures, whether it be animal fat,
such as lard, or plant fat, such as vegetable oil, toxic volatile
chemicals with mutagenic properties (those able to cause genetic
mutations) are released into the air.22 This happens even before the
“smoke point” temperature is reached.23 If you do fry at home, good
ventilation in the kitchen may reduce lung cancer risk.24</p>
<p>Cancer risk may also depend on what’s being fried. A study of women
in China found that smokers who stir-fried meat every day had nearly
three times the odds of lung cancer compared to smokers who stir-fried
foods other than meat on a daily basis.25 This is thought to be because
of a group of carcinogens called heterocyclic amines that are formed
when muscle tissue is subjected to high temperatures. (We’ll talk more
about these in chapter 11.)</p>
<p>The effects of meat fumes can be hard to separate from the effects of
eating the meat itself, but a recent study on pregnant women and
barbecuing attempted to tease them out. When meat is grilled, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are also produced, one of the probable
carcinogens in cigarette smoke. The researchers discovered that not only
was the ingestion of grilled meat in the third trimester associated with
smaller birth weights, mothers merely exposed to the fumes tended to
give birth to babies with a birth weight deficit. Exposure to the fumes
was also associated with a smaller head size, an indicator of brain
volume.26 Air pollution studies suggest prenatal exposure to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons may then translate into adverse effects on
children’s future cognitive development (as manifested by a
significantly lower IQ).27</p>
<p>Even just living next to a restaurant may pose a health hazard.
Scientists estimated the lifetime cancer risk among those residing near
the exhaust outlets at Chinese restaurants, American restaurants, and
barbecue joints. While exposure to fumes from all three types of
restaurants resulted in exposure to unsafe levels of PAHs, the Chinese
restaurants proved to be the worst. This is thought to be due to the
amount of fish being cooked,28 as the fumes from pan-fried fish have
been found to contain high levels of PAHs capable of damaging the DNA of
human lung cells.29 Given the excess cancer risk, the researchers
concluded that it wouldn’t be safe to live near the exhaust of a Chinese
restaurant for more than a day or two a month.30</p>
<p>What about that enticing aroma of sizzling bacon? The fumes produced
by frying bacon contain a class of carcinogens called nitrosamines.31
Although all meat may release potentially carcinogenic fumes, processed
meat like bacon may be the worst: A UC-Davis study found that bacon
fumes cause about four times more DNA mutations than the fumes from beef
patties fried at similar temperatures.32</p>
<p>What about tempeh bacon? Tempeh is a fermented soybean product used
to make a variety of meat substitutes. Researchers compared the
DNA-mutating effects of the fumes from frying bacon and beef to tempeh.
The bacon and burger fumes were mutagenic, but the tempeh fumes were
not. Nevertheless, it’s still not a good idea to eat fried foods. Though
no DNA changes were detected after exposure to tempeh smoke, the fried
tempeh itself did cause some DNA mutations (though 45 times fewer than
the beef and 346 times fewer than the bacon). The researchers proposed
that these findings might account for the higher incidence of
respiratory diseases and lung cancer among cooks and lower incidence
overall among vegetarians.33</p>
<p>If you do need to be around frying bacon or eggs, it would be safer
to limit your exposure by using a backyard grill. Studies show that the
number of particles deposited into the lungs increases by a factor of
ten when frying indoors versus outdoors.34</p>
<p>CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE</p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema and
chronic bronchitis, is a condition that makes it difficult to breathe
and gets worse and worse over time. In addition to shortness of breath,
COPD can cause severe coughing, excess mucus production, wheezing, and
chest tightness. The disease affects more than twenty-four million
Americans.35</p>
<p>Smoking is far and away the leading cause of COPD, but other factors
can contribute, such as prolonged exposure to air pollution.
Unfortunately, there is no cure for COPD, but there is some good news: A
healthy diet may help to prevent COPD and help keep it from getting
worse.</p>
<p>Data going back fifty years show that a high intake of fruits and
vegetables is positively associated with good lung function.36 Just one
extra serving of fruit each day may translate into a 24 percent lower
risk of dying from COPD.37 On the other hand, a twin pair of studies
from Columbia and Harvard Universities found that consumption of cured
meat—like bacon, bologna, ham, hot dogs, sausage, and salami—may
increase the risk of COPD.38,39 It’s thought to be due to the nitrite
preservatives in meat, which may mimic the lung-damaging properties of
the nitrite by-products of cigarette smoke.40</p>
<p>What if you already have the disease? Can the same foods that appear
to help prevent COPD be used to treat it? We didn’t know until a
landmark study was published in 2010. More than a hundred COPD patients
were randomized into two groups—half were instructed to boost their
fruit and vegetable consumption, while the others remained on their
normal diet. Over the next three years, the standard-diet subjects
became progressively worse, as expected. In contrast, the disease
progression was halted in the group consuming more fruits and veggies.
Not only did their lung function not get worse, it actually improved a
little. The researchers suggested this could be due to a combination of
the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the fruits and
vegetables, along with a potential reduction in the consumption of meat,
which is thought to act as a pro-oxidant.41</p>
<p>Regardless of the mechanism, a diet with more whole plant foods may
help both prevent and arrest the progression of this leading killer.</p>
<p>ASTHMA</p>
<p>Asthma is an inflammatory disease characterized by recurring attacks
of narrowed, swollen airways, causing shortness of breath, wheezing, and
coughing. Asthma can start at any age, but it usually emerges during
childhood. One of the most common chronic diseases in kids, asthma’s
prevalence has been increasing year after year.42 In the United States,
twenty-five million people suffer from asthma, and seven million of them
are children.43</p>
<p>A groundbreaking study recently demonstrated that the rates of asthma
vary dramatically around the world. The International Study of Asthma
and Allergies in Childhood followed more than a million children in
nearly one hundred countries, making it the most comprehensive survey
ever undertaken of this disease. The study found a twentyfold to
sixtyfold difference in the prevalence of asthma, allergies, and
eczema.44 Why does the prevalence of rhinoconjunctivitis (itchy eyes and
runny nose) range from 1 percent of children in parts of India, for
instance, to as much as 45 percent elsewhere?45 While such factors as
air pollution and smoking rates may play a role, the most significant
associations were not with what was going into their lungs but what was
going into their stomachs.46</p>
<p>Adolescents living in areas where more starchy foods, grains,
vegetables, and nuts were consumed were significantly less likely to
exhibit chronic symptoms of wheezing, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and
allergic eczema.47 Boys and girls eating two or more servings of
vegetables a day appear to have only half the odds of suffering from
allergic asthma.48 In general, the prevalence of asthma and respiratory
symptoms reportedly appears to be lower among populations eating more
foods of plant origin.49</p>
<p>Foods of animal origin have been associated with increased asthma
risk. A study of more than one hundred thousand adults in India found
that those who consumed meat daily, or even occasionally, were
significantly more likely to suffer from asthma than those who excluded
meat and eggs from their diets altogether.50 Eggs (along with soda) have
also been associated with asthma attacks in children, along with
respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and
exercise-induced coughing.51 Removing eggs and dairy from the diet has
been shown to improve asthmatic children’s lung function in as few as
eight weeks.52</p>
<p>The mechanism by which diet affects airway inflammation may lie with
the thin coating of fluid that forms the interface between your
respiratory-tract lining and the outside air. Using the antioxidants
obtained from the fruits and vegetables you eat, this fluid acts as your
first line of defense against the free radicals that contribute to
asthmatic airway hypersensitivity, contraction, and mucus production.53
Oxidation by-products can be measured in exhaled breath and are
significantly lowered by shifting toward a more plant-based diet.54</p>
<p>So if asthmatics eat fewer fruits and vegetables, does their lung
function decline? Researchers out of Australia tried removing fruits and
vegetables from asthma patients’ diets to see what would happen. Within
two weeks, asthma symptoms grew significantly worse. Interestingly, the
low-fruit, low-vegetable diet used in the study—a restriction to no more
than one serving of fruit and two servings of vegetables per day—is
typical of Western diets. In other words, the diet they used
experimentally to impair people’s lung function and worsen their asthma
was effectively the standard American diet.55</p>
<p>What about improving asthma by adding fruits and vegetables?
Researchers repeated the experiment, but this time increased fruit and
vegetable consumption to seven servings a day. This simple act of adding
a few more fruits and vegetables to their daily diet ended up
successfully cutting the study subjects’ exacerbation rate in half.56
That’s the power of eating healthfully.</p>
<p>If it’s the antioxidants, why not just take an antioxidant
supplement? After all, popping a pill is easier than eating an apple.
The reason is simple: Supplements don’t appear to work. Studies have
repeatedly shown that antioxidant supplements have no beneficial effects
on respiratory or allergic diseases, underscoring the importance of
eating whole foods rather than trying to take isolated components or
extracts in pill form.57 For example, the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study
found that women who obtained high levels of vitamin E from a nut-rich
diet appeared to have nearly half the risk of asthma of those who
didn’t, but those who took vitamin E supplements saw no benefit at
all.58</p>
<p>Who do you think did better? A group of asthma patients who ate seven
servings a day of fruits and vegetables, or a group who ate three
servings plus fifteen “serving equivalents” in pill form? Sure enough,
the pills didn’t seem to help at all. Improvements in lung function and
asthma control were evident only after subjects increased their actual
fruit and vegetable intake, strongly suggesting that consuming whole
foods is paramount.59</p>
<p>If adding a few daily servings of fruits and vegetables can have such
a significant effect, what if asthma sufferers were put on a diet
composed entirely of plant foods? Researchers in Sweden decided to test
out a strictly plant-based diet on a group of severe asthmatics who
weren’t getting better despite the best medical therapies—thirty-five
patients with long-established, physician-verified asthma, twenty of
whom had been admitted to hospitals for acute attacks during the
previous two years. One patient had received emergency intravenous
infusions a total of twenty-three times, another reported he’d been
hospitalized more than a hundred times, and one subject had even
suffered a cardiac arrest after an attack and had to be revived and
placed on a ventilator.60 These were some pretty serious cases.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-four patients who stuck with the plant-based diet, 70
percent improved after four months, and 90 percent improved within one
year. And these were all people who had experienced no improvement in
their conditions at all in the year prior to switching to a plant-based
diet.61</p>
<p>Within just one year of eating healthier, all but two patients were
able to drop their dose of asthma medication or get off their steroids
and other drugs altogether. Objective measures like lung function and
physical working capacity improved; meanwhile, subjectively, some
patients said their improvement was so considerable that they felt like
“they had a new life.”62</p>
<p>There was no control group, so the placebo effect may have accounted
for some of the improvement, but the nice thing about a healthier diet
is that there are only good side effects. In addition to improvements in
their asthma control, the study subjects lost an average of eighteen
pounds, and their cholesterol and blood pressures got better. From a
risk-benefit standpoint, then, it’s definitely worth giving a
plant-based diet a try.</p>
<hr />
<p>The most lethal lung diseases vary widely in presentation and
prognosis. As noted, smoking is far and away the leading cause of lung
cancer and COPD, but diseases like asthma typically develop during
childhood and can be associated with a range of contributing factors,
such as low birth weight and frequent respiratory infections. While
quitting smoking remains the most effective way to ward off the worst
kinds of lung disease, we can also help the body bolster its defenses by
eating a diet rich in protective plant foods. The same kind of diet that
appears to help severe asthmatics may also help prevent all three
diseases from occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the millions of Americans who already suffer from
lung disease, quitting smoking and changing your diet can still make a
difference. It’s never too late to start living and eating healthier.
The restorative powers of the human body are remarkable, but your body
needs your help. By including foods that contain cancer-fighting
compounds and loading up on antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies, you may
be able to strengthen your respiratory defenses and breathe easier.</p>
<p>In my clinical practice, whenever I’ve felt under too much time
pressure to address a patient’s smoking or bad dietary habits, I stop
and think back to the hideous death of that man in Boston. No one
deserves to die like that. I’d like to think no one has to.</p>
