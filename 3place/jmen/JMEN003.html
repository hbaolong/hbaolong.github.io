PREVENTING, ARRESTING, AND REVERSING OUR LEADING KILLERS</h4>
<p>There may be no such thing as dying from old age. From a study of
more than forty-two thousand consecutive autopsies, centenarians—those
who live past one hundred—were found to have succumbed to diseases in
100 percent of the cases examined. Though most were perceived, even by
their physicians, to have been healthy just prior to death, not one
“died of old age.”1 Until recently, advanced age had been considered to
be a disease itself,2 but people don’t die as a consequence of maturing.
They die from disease, most commonly heart attacks.3</p>
<p>Most deaths in the United States are preventable, and they are
related to what we eat.4 Our diet is the number-one cause of premature
death and the number-one cause of disability.5 Surely, diet must also be
the number-one thing taught in medical schools, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s not. According to the most recent national survey, only a
quarter of medical schools offer a single course in nutrition, down from
37 percent thirty years ago.6 While most of the public evidently
considers doctors to be “very credible” sources of nutrition
information,7 six out of seven graduating doctors surveyed felt
physicians were inadequately trained to counsel patients about their
diets.8 One study found that people off the street sometimes know more
about basic nutrition than their doctors, concluding “physicians should
be more knowledgeable about nutrition than their patients, but these
results suggest that this is not necessarily true.”9</p>
<p>To remedy this situation, a bill was introduced in the California
State Legislature to mandate physicians get at least twelve hours of
nutrition training any time over the next four years. It might surprise
you to learn that the California Medical Association came out strongly
opposed to the bill, as did other mainstream medical groups, including
the California Academy of Family Physicians.10 The bill was amended from
a mandatory minimum of twelve hours over four years down to seven hours
and then doctored, one might say, down to zero.</p>
<p>The California medical board does have one subject requirement:
twelve hours on pain management and end-of-life care for the terminally
ill.11 This disparity between prevention and mere mitigation of
suffering could be a metaphor for modern medicine. A doctor a day may
keep the apples away.</p>
<p>Back in 1903, Thomas Edison predicted that the “doctor of the future
will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of
[the] human frame in diet and in the cause and prevention of
diseases.”12 Sadly, all it takes is a few minutes watching
pharmaceutical ads on television imploring viewers to “ask your doctor”
about this or that drug to know that Edison’s prediction hasn’t come
true. A study of thousands of patient visits found that the average
length of time primary-care doctors spend talking about nutrition is
about ten seconds.13</p>
<p>But hey, this is the twenty-first century! Can’t we eat whatever we
want and simply take meds when we begin having health problems? For too
many patients and even my physician colleagues, this seems to be the
prevailing mind-set. Global spending for prescription drugs is
surpassing trillion annually, with the United States accounting for
about one-third of this market.14 Why do we spend so much on pills? Many
people assume that our manner of death is preprogrammed into our genes.
High blood pressure by fifty-five, heart attacks at sixty, maybe cancer
at seventy, and so on.… But for most of the leading causes of death, the
science shows that our genes often account for only 10–20 percent of
risk at most.15 For instance, as you’ll see in this book, the rates of
killers like heart disease and major cancers differ up to a hundredfold
among various populations around the globe. But when people move from
low- to high-risk countries, their disease rates almost always change to
those of the new environment.16 New diet, new diseases. So, while a
sixty-year-old American man living in San Francisco has about a 5
percent chance of having a heart attack within five years, should he
move to Japan and start eating and living like the Japanese, his
five-year risk would drop to only 1 percent. Japanese Americans in their
forties can have the same heart attack risk as Japanese in their
sixties. Switching to an American lifestyle in effect aged their hearts
a full twenty years.17</p>
<p>The Mayo Clinic estimates that nearly 70 percent of Americans take at
least one prescription drug.18 Yet despite the fact that more people in
this country are on medication than aren’t, not to mention the steady
influx of ever newer and more expensive drugs on the market, we aren’t
living much longer than others. In terms of life expectancy, the United
States is down around twenty-seven or twenty-eight out of the
thirty-four top free-market democracies. People in Slovenia live longer
than we do.19 And the extra years we are living aren’t necessarily
healthy or vibrant. Back in 2011, a disturbing analysis of mortality and
morbidity was published in the Journal of Gerontology. Are Americans
living longer now compared to about a generation ago? Yes, technically.
But are those extra years necessarily healthy ones? No. And it’s worse
than that: We’re actually living fewer healthy years now than we once
did.20</p>
<p>Here’s what I mean: A twenty-year-old in 1998 could expect to live
about fifty-eight more years, while a twenty-year-old in 2006 could look
forward to fifty-nine more years. However, the twenty-year-old from the
1990s might live ten of those years with chronic disease, whereas now
it’s more like thirteen years with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or a
stroke. So it feels like one step forward, three steps back. The
researchers also noted that we’re living two fewer functional years—that
is, for two years, we’re no longer able to perform basic life
activities, such as walking a quarter of a mile, standing or sitting for
two hours without having to lie down, or standing without special
equipment.21 In other words, we’re living longer, but we’re living
sicker.</p>
<p>With these rising disease rates, our children may even die sooner. A
special report published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled
“A Potential Decline in Life Expectancy in the United States in the 21st
Century” concluded that “the steady rise in life expectancy observed in
the modern era may soon come to an end and the youth of today may, on
average, live less healthy and possibly even shorter lives than their
parents.”22</p>
<p>In public health school, students learn that there are three levels
of preventive medicine. The first is primary prevention, as in trying to
prevent people at risk for heart disease from suffering their first
heart attack. An example of this level of preventive medicine would be
your doctor prescribing you a statin drug for high cholesterol.
Secondary prevention takes place when you already have the disease and
are trying to prevent it from becoming worse, like having a second heart
attack. To do this, your doctor may add an aspirin or other drugs to
your regimen. At the third level of preventive medicine, the focus is on
helping people manage long-term health problems, so your doctor, for
example, might prescribe a cardiac rehabilitation program that aims to
prevent further physical deterioration and pain.23 In 2000, a fourth
level was proposed. What could this new “quaternary” prevention be?
Reduce the complications from all the drugs and surgery from the first
three levels.24 But people seem to forget about a fifth concept, termed
primordial prevention, that was first introduced by the World Health
Organization back in 1978. Decades later, it’s finally being embraced by
the American Heart Association.25</p>
<p>Primordial prevention was conceived as a strategy to prevent whole
societies from experiencing epidemics of chronic-disease risk factors.
This means not just preventing chronic disease but preventing the risk
factors that lead to chronic disease.26 For example, instead of trying
to prevent someone with high cholesterol from suffering a heart attack,
why not help prevent him or her from getting high cholesterol (which
leads to the heart attack) in the first place?</p>
<p>With this in mind, the American Heart Association came up with “The
Simple 7” factors that can lead to a healthier life: not smoking, not
being overweight, being “very active” (defined as the equivalent of
walking at least twenty-two minutes a day), eating healthier (for
example, lots of fruits and vegetables), having below-average
cholesterol, having normal blood pressure, and having normal blood sugar
levels.27 The American Heart Association’s goal is to reduce
heart-disease deaths by 20 percent by 2020.28 If more than 90 percent of
heart attacks may be avoided with lifestyle changes,29 why so modest an
aim? Even 25 percent was “deemed unrealistic.”30 The AHA’s pessimism may
have something to do with the frightening reality of the average
American diet.</p>
<p>An analysis of the health behaviors of thirty-five thousand adults
across the United States was published in the American Heart Association
journal. Most of the participants didn’t smoke, about half reached their
weekly exercise goals, and about a third of the population got a pass in
each of the other categories—except diet. Their diets were scored on a
scale from zero to five to see if they met a bare minimum of healthy
eating behaviors, such as meeting recommended targets for fruit,
vegetable, and whole-grain consumption or drinking fewer than three cans
of soda a week. How many even reached four out of five on their Healthy
Eating Score? About 1 percent.31 Maybe if the American Heart Association
achieves its goal of an “aggressive”32 20 percent improvement by 2020,
we’ll get up to 1.2 percent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Medical anthropologists have identified several major eras of human
disease, starting with the Age of Pestilence and Famine, which largely
ended with the Industrial Revolution, or the stage we’re in now, the Age
of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases.33 This shift is reflected in the
changing causes of death over the last century. In 1900 in the United
States, the top-three killers were infectious diseases: pneumonia,
tuberculosis, and diarrheal disease.34 Now, the killers are largely
lifestyle diseases: heart disease, cancer, and chronic lung disease.35
Is this simply because antibiotics have enabled us to live long enough
to suffer from degenerative diseases? No. The emergence of these
epidemics of chronic disease was accompanied by dramatic shifts in
dietary patterns. This is best exemplified by what’s been happening to
disease rates among people in the developing world over the last few
decades as they’ve rapidly Westernized their diets.</p>
<p>In 1990 around the world, most years of healthy life were lost to
undernutrition, such as diarrheal diseases in malnourished children, but
now the greatest disease burden is attributed to high blood pressure, a
disease of overnutrition.36 The pandemic of chronic disease has been
ascribed in part to the near-universal shift toward a diet dominated by
animal-sourced and processed foods—in other words, more meat, dairy,
eggs, oils, soda, sugar, and refined grains.37 China is perhaps the
best-studied example. There, a transition away from the country’s
traditional, plant-based diet was accompanied by a sharp rise in
diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases, and cancer.38</p>
<p>Why do we suspect these changes in diet and disease are related?
After all, rapidly industrializing societies undergo multitudes of
changes. How are scientists able to parse out the effects of specific
foods? To isolate the effects of different dietary components,
researchers can follow the diets and diseases of large groups of defined
individuals over time. Take meat, for example. To see what effect an
increase in meat consumption might have on disease rates, researchers
studied lapsed vegetarians. People who once ate vegetarian diets but
then started to eat meat at least once a week experienced a 146 percent
increase in odds of heart disease, a 152 percent increase in stroke, a
166 percent increase in diabetes, and a 231 percent increase in odds for
weight gain. During the twelve years after the transition from
vegetarian to omnivore, meat-eating was associated with a 3.6 year
decrease in life expectancy.39</p>
<p>Even vegetarians can suffer high rates of chronic disease, though, if
they eat a lot of processed foods. Take India, for example. This
country’s rates of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and stroke have
increased far faster than might have been expected given its relatively
small increase in per capita meat consumption. This has been blamed on
the decreasing “whole plant food content of their diet,” including a
shift from brown rice to white and the substitution of other refined
carbohydrates, packaged snacks, and fast-food products for India’s
traditional staples of lentils, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts,
and seeds.40 In general, the dividing line between health-promoting and
disease-promoting foods may be less plant- versus animal-sourced foods
and more whole plant foods versus most everything else.</p>
<p>To this end, a dietary quality index was developed that simply
reflects the percentage of calories people derive from nutrient-rich,
unprocessed plant foods41 on a scale of zero to one hundred. The higher
people score, the more body fat they may lose over time42 and the lower
their risk may be of abdominal obesity,43 high blood pressure,44 high
cholesterol, and high triglycerides.45 Comparing the diets of 100 women
with breast cancer to 175 healthy women, researchers concluded that
scoring higher on the whole plant food diet index (greater than about
thirty compared to less than about eighteen) may reduce the odds of
breast cancer more than 90 percent.46</p>
<p>Sadly, most Americans hardly make it past a score of ten. The
standard American diet rates eleven out of one hundred. According to
estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 32 percent of our
calories comes from animal foods, 57 percent comes from processed plant
foods, and only 11 percent comes from whole grains, beans, fruits,
vegetables, and nuts.47 That means on a scale of one to ten, the
American diet would rate about a one.</p>
<p>We eat almost as if the future doesn’t matter. And, indeed, there are
actually data to back that up. A study entitled “Death Row Nutrition:
Curious Conclusions of Last Meals” analyzed the last meal requests of
hundreds of individuals executed in the United States during a five-year
period. It turns out that the nutritional content didn’t differ much
from what Americans normally eat.48 If we continue to eat as though
we’re having our last meals, eventually they will be.</p>
<p>What percentage of Americans hit all the American Heart Association’s
“Simple 7” recommendations? Of 1,933 men and women surveyed, most met
two or three, but hardly any managed to meet all seven simple health
components. In fact, just a single individual could boast hitting all
seven recommendations.49 One person out of nearly two thousand. As a
recent past president of the American Heart Association responded, “That
should give all of us pause.”50</p>
<p>The truth is that adhering to just four simple healthy lifestyle
factors can have a strong impact on the prevention of chronic diseases:
not smoking, not being obese, getting a half hour of exercise a day, and
eating healthier—defined as consuming more fruits, veggies, and whole
grains and less meat. Those four factors alone were found to account for
78 percent of chronic disease risk. If you start from scratch and manage
to tick off all four, you may be able to wipe out more than 90 percent
of your risk of developing diabetes, more than 80 percent of your risk
of having a heart attack, cut by half your risk of having a stroke, and
reduce your overall cancer risk by more than one-third.51 For some
cancers, like our number-two cancer killer, colon cancer, up to 71
percent of cases appear to be preventable through a similar portfolio of
simple diet and lifestyle changes.52</p>
<p>Maybe it’s time we stop blaming genetics and focus on the more than
70 percent that is directly under our control.53 We have the power.</p>
<hr />
<p>Does all this healthy living translate into a longer life as well?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) followed
approximately eight thousand Americans aged twenty years or older for
about six years. They found that three cardinal lifestyle behaviors
exerted an enormous impact on mortality: People can substantially reduce
their risk for early death by not smoking, consuming a healthier diet,
and engaging in sufficient physical activity. And the CDC’s definitions
were pretty laid-back: By not smoking, the CDC just meant not currently
smoking. A “healthy diet” was defined merely as being in the top 40
percent in terms of complying with the wimpy federal dietary guidelines,
and “physically active” meant averaging about twenty-one minutes or more
a day of at least moderate exercise. People who managed at least one of
the three had a 40 percent lower risk of dying within that six-year
period. Those who hit two out of three cut their chances of dying by
more than half, and those who scored all three behaviors reduced their
chances of dying in that time by 82 percent.54</p>
<p>Of course, people sometimes fib about how well they eat. How accurate
can these findings really be if they’re based on people’s
self-reporting? A similar study on health behaviors and survival didn’t
just take people’s own word for how healthy they were eating; the
researchers measured how much vitamin C participants had in their
bloodstreams. The level of vitamin C in the blood was considered a “good
biomarker of plant food intake” and hence was used as a proxy for a
healthy diet. The conclusions held up. The drop in mortality risk among
those with healthier habits was equivalent to being fourteen years
younger.55 It’s like turning back the clock fourteen years—not with a
drug or a DeLorean but just by eating and living healthier.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little more about aging. In each of your cells, you have
forty-six strands of DNA coiled into chromosomes. At the tip of each
chromosome, there’s a tiny cap called a telomere, which keeps your DNA
from unraveling and fraying. Think of it as the plastic tips on the end
of your shoelaces. Every time your cells divide, however, a bit of that
cap is lost. And when the telomere is completely gone, your cells can
die.56 Though this is an oversimplification,57 telomeres have been
thought of as your life “fuse”: They can start shortening as soon as
you’re born, and when they’re gone, you’re gone. In fact, forensic
scientists can take DNA from a bloodstain and roughly estimate how old
the person was based on how long their telomeres are.58</p>
<p>Sounds like fodder for a great scene in CSI, but is there anything
you can do to slow the rate at which your fuses burn? The thought is
that if you can slow down this ticking cellular clock, you may be able
to slow down the aging process and live longer.59 So what would you have
to do if you wanted to prevent this telomere cap from burning away?
Well, smoking cigarettes is associated with triple the rate of telomere
loss,60 so the first step is simple: Stop smoking. But the food you eat
every day may also have an impact on how fast you lose your telomeres.
The consumption of fruits,61 vegetables,62 and other antioxidant-rich
foods63 has been associated with longer protective telomeres. In
contrast, the consumption of refined grains,64 soda,65 meat (including
fish),66 and dairy67 has been linked to shortened telomeres. What if you
ate a diet composed of whole plant foods and stayed away from processed
foods and animal foods? Could cellular aging be slowed?</p>
<p>The answer lies in an enzyme found in Methuselah. That’s the name
given to a bristlecone pine tree growing in the White Mountains of
California, which, at the time, happened to be the oldest recorded
living being and is now nearing its 4,800th birthday. It was already
hundreds of years old before construction of the pyramids in Egypt
began. There’s an enzyme in the roots of bristlecone pines that appears
to peak a few thousand years into their life span, and it actually
rebuilds telomeres.68 Scientists named it telomerase. Once they knew
what to look for, researchers discovered the enzyme was present in human
cells too. The question then became, how can we boost the activity of
this age-defying enzyme?</p>
<p>Seeking answers, the pioneering researcher Dr. Dean Ornish teamed up
with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn, who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in
Medicine for her discovery of telomerase. In a study funded in part by
the U.S. Department of Defense, they found that three months of
whole-food, plant-based nutrition and other healthy changes could
significantly boost telomerase activity, the only intervention ever
shown to do so.69 The study was published in one of the most prestigious
medical journals in the world. The accompanying editorial concluded that
this landmark study “should encourage people to adopt a healthy
lifestyle in order to avoid or combat cancer and age-related
diseases.”70</p>
<p>So were Dr. Ornish and Dr. Blackburn able to successfully slow down
aging with a healthy diet and lifestyle? A five-year follow-up study was
recently published in which the lengths of the study subjects’ telomeres
were measured. In the control group (the group of participants who did
not change their lifestyles), their telomeres predictably shrank with
age. But for the healthy-living group, not only did their telomeres
shrink less, they grew. Five years later, their telomeres were even
longer on average than when they started, suggesting a healthy lifestyle
can boost telomerase enzyme activity and reverse cellular aging.71</p>
<p>Subsequent research has shown that the telomere lengthening wasn’t
just because the healthy-living group was exercising more or losing
weight. Weight loss through calorie restriction and an even more
vigorous exercise program failed to improve telomere length, so it
appears that the active ingredient is the quality, not quantity, of the
food eaten. As long as people were eating the same diet, it didn’t
appear to matter how small their portions were, how much weight they
lost, or even how hard they exercised; after a year, they saw no
benefit.72 In contrast, individuals on the plant-based diet exercised
only half as much, enjoyed the same amount of weight loss after just
three months,73 and achieved significant telomere protection.74 In other
words, it wasn’t the weight loss and it wasn’t the exercise that
reversed cell aging—it was the food.</p>
<p>Some people have expressed concern that boosting telomerase activity
could theoretically increase cancer risk, since tumors have been known
to hijack the telomerase enzyme and use it to ensure their own
immortality.75 But as we’ll see in chapter 13, Dr. Ornish and his
colleagues have used the same diet and lifestyle changes to halt and
apparently reverse the progression of cancer in certain circumstances.
We will also see how the same diet can reverse heart disease too.</p>
<p>What about our other leading killers? It turns out a more plant-based
diet may help prevent, treat, or reverse every single one of our fifteen
leading causes of death. In this book, I’ll go through this list, with a
chapter on each:</p>

<p>Certainly there are prescription medications that can help with some
of these conditions. For example, you can take statin drugs for your
cholesterol to lower risk of heart attacks, pop different pills and
inject insulin for diabetes, and take a slew of diuretics and other
blood pressure medications for hypertension. But there is only one
unifying diet that may help prevent, arrest, or even reverse each of
these killers. Unlike with medications, there isn’t one kind of diet for
optimal liver function and a different diet to improve our kidneys. A
heart-healthy diet is a brain-healthy diet is a lung-healthy diet. The
same diet that helps prevent cancer just so happens to be the same diet
that may help prevent type 2 diabetes and every other cause of death on
the top-fifteen list. Unlike drugs—which only target specific functions,
can have dangerous side effects, and may only treat the symptoms of
disease—a healthy diet can benefit all organ systems at once, has good
side effects, and may treat the underlying cause of illness.</p>
<p>That one unifying diet found to best prevent and treat many of these
chronic diseases is a whole-food, plant-based diet, defined as an eating
pattern that encourages the consumption of unrefined plant foods and
discourages meats, dairy products, eggs, and processed foods.92 In this
book, I don’t advocate for a vegetarian diet or a vegan diet. I advocate
for an evidence-based diet, and the best available balance of science
suggests that the more whole plant foods we eat, the better—both to reap
their nutritional benefits and to displace less healthful options.</p>
<p>Most doctor visits are for lifestyle-based diseases, which means
they’re preventable diseases.93 As physicians, my colleagues and I were
trained not to treat the root cause but rather the consequences by
giving a lifetime’s worth of medications to treat risk factors like high
blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. This approach has been
compared to mopping up the floor around an overflowing sink instead of
simply turning off the faucet.94 Drug companies are more than happy to
sell you a new roll of paper towels every day for the rest of your life
while the water continues to gush. As Dr. Walter Willett, the chair of
nutrition at Harvard University’s School of Public Health, put it: “The
inherent problem is that most pharmacologic strategies do not address
the underlying causes of ill health in Western countries, which are not
drug deficiencies.”95</p>
<p>Treating the cause is not only safer and cheaper but it can work
better. So why don’t more of my medical colleagues do it? Not only were
they not trained how, doctors don’t get paid for it. No one profits from
lifestyle medicine (other than the patient!), so it’s not a major part
of medical training or practice.96 That’s just how the current system
works. The medical system is set up to financially reward prescribing
pills and procedures, not produce. After Dr. Ornish proved that heart
disease could be reversed without drugs or surgery, he thought that his
studies would have a meaningful effect on the practice of mainstream
medicine. After all, he effectively found a cure for our number-one
killer! But he was mistaken—not about his critically important findings
regarding diet and disease reversal but about how much influence the
business of medicine has on the practice of medicine. In his words,
Dr. Ornish “realized reimbursement is a much more powerful determinant
of medical practice than research.”97</p>
<p>Though there are vested interests, such as the processed food and
pharmaceutical industries, which fight hard to maintain the status quo,
there is one corporate sector that actually benefits from keeping people
healthy—namely, the insurance industry. Kaiser Permanente, the largest
managed-care organization in the country, published a nutritional update
for physicians in their official medical journal, informing their nearly
fifteen thousand physicians that healthy eating may be “best achieved
with a plant-based diet, which we define as a regimen that encourages
whole, plant-based foods and discourages meats, dairy products, and eggs
as well as all refined and processed foods.”98</p>
<p>“Too often, physicians ignore the potential benefits of good
nutrition and quickly prescribe medications instead of giving patients a
chance to correct their disease through healthy eating and active
living.… Physicians should consider recommending a plant-based diet to
all their patients, especially those with high blood pressure, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, or obesity.”99 Physicians should give their
patients a chance to first correct their disease themselves with
plant-based nutrition.</p>
<p>The major downside Kaiser Permanente’s nutritional update describes
is that this diet may work a little too well. If people begin eating
plant-based diets while still taking medications, their blood pressure
or blood sugar could actually drop so low that physicians may need to
adjust medications or eliminate them altogether. Ironically, the “side
effect” of the diet may be not having to take drugs anymore. The article
ends with a familiar refrain: Further research is needed. In this case,
though, “Further research is needed to find ways to make plant-based
diets the new normal.…”100</p>
<hr />
<p>We’re a long way off from Thomas Edison’s 1903 prediction, but it is
my hope that this book can help you understand that most of our leading
causes of death and disability are more preventable than inevitable. The
primary reason diseases tend to run in families may be that diets tend
to run in families.</p>
<p>For most of our leading killers, nongenetic factors like diet can
account for at least 80 or 90 percent of cases. As I noted before, this
is based on the fact that the rates of cardiovascular disease and major
cancers differ fivefold to a hundredfold around the world. Migration
studies show this is not just genetics. When people move from low- to
high-risk areas, their disease risk nearly always shoots up to match the
new setting.101 As well, dramatic changes in disease rates within a
single generation highlight the primacy of external factors. Colon
cancer mortality in Japan in the 1950s was less than one-fifth that of
the United States (including Americans of Japanese ancestry).102 But now
colon cancer rates in Japan are as bad as they are in the United States,
a rise that has been attributed in part to the fivefold increase in meat
consumption.103</p>
<p>Research has shown us that identical twins separated at birth will
get different diseases based on how they live their lives. A recent
American Heart Association–funded study compared the lifestyles and
arteries of nearly five hundred twins. It found that diet and lifestyle
factors clearly trumped genes.104 You share 50 percent of your genes
with each of your parents, so if one parent dies of a heart attack, you
know you’ve inherited some of that susceptibility. But even among
identical twins who have the exact same genes, one could die early of a
heart attack and the other could live a long, healthy life with clean
arteries depending on what she ate and how she lived. Even if both your
parents died with heart disease, you should be able to eat your way to a
healthy heart. Your family history does not have to become your personal
destiny.</p>
<p>Just because you’re born with bad genes doesn’t mean you can’t
effectively turn them off. As you’ll see in the breast cancer and
Alzheimer’s disease chapters, even if you’re born with high-risk genes,
you have tremendous control over your medical destiny. Epigenetics is
the hot new field of study that deals with this control of gene
activity. Skin cells look and function a lot differently from bone
cells, brain cells, or heart cells, but each of our cells has the same
complement of DNA. What makes them act differently is that they each
have different genes turned on or off. That’s the power of epigenetics.
Same DNA, but different results.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example of how striking this effect can be.
Consider the humble honeybee. Queen bees and worker bees are genetically
identical, yet queen bees lay up to two thousand eggs a day, while
worker bees are functionally sterile. Queens live up to three years;
workers may live only three weeks.105 The difference between the two is
diet. When the hive’s queen is dying, a larva is picked by nurse bees to
be fed a secreted substance called royal jelly. When the larva eats this
jelly, the enzyme that had been silencing the expression of royal genes
is turned off, and a new queen is born.106 The queen has the exact same
genes as any of the workers, but because of what she ate, different
genes are expressed, and her life and life span are dramatically altered
as a result.</p>
<p>Cancer cells can use epigenetics against us by silencing
tumor-suppressor genes that could otherwise stop the cancer in its
tracks. So even if you’re born with good genes, cancer can sometimes
find a way to turn them off. A number of chemotherapy drugs have been
developed to restore our bodies’ natural defenses, but their use has
been limited due to their high toxicity.107 There are, however, a number
of compounds distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom—including
beans, greens, and berries—that appear to have the same effect
naturally.108 For example, dripping green tea on colon, esophageal, or
prostate cancer cells has been shown to reactivate genes silenced by the
cancer.109 This hasn’t just been demonstrated in a petri dish, though.
Three hours after eating a cup of broccoli sprouts, the enzyme that
cancers use to help silence our defenses is suppressed in your
bloodstream110 to an extent equal to or greater than the chemotherapy
agent specifically designed for that purpose,111 without the toxic side
effects.112</p>
<p>What if we ate a diet chock-full of plant foods? In the Gene
Expression Modulation by Intervention with Nutrition and Lifestyle
(GEMINAL) study, Dr. Ornish and colleagues took biopsies from men with
prostate cancer before and after three months of intensive lifestyle
changes that included a whole-food, plant-based diet. Without any
chemotherapy or radiation, beneficial changes in gene expression for
five hundred different genes were noted. Within just a few months, the
expression of disease-preventing genes was boosted, and oncogenes that
promote breast and prostate cancer were suppressed.113 Whatever genes we
may have inherited from our parents, what we eat can affect how those
genes affect our health. The power is mainly in our hands and on our
plates.</p>

<p>This book is divided into two parts: the “why” and the “how.” In part
1—the “why” to eat healthfully section—I will explore the role diet can
play in the prevention, treatment, and reversal of the fifteen leading
causes of death in the United States. I’ll then take a closer look at
more practical aspects of healthy eating in the “how” to eat healthfully
section presented in part 2. For example, we’ll see in part 1 why beans
and greens are among the healthiest foods on earth. Then, in part 2,
we’ll take a look at how best to eat them—we’ll explore such issues as
how many greens to eat every day and whether they’re best cooked,
canned, fresh, or frozen. We’ll see in part 1 why it’s important to eat
at least nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and then part 2
will help you decide whether to buy organic or conventional produce.
I’ll try to answer all the common questions I receive daily and then
offer real-world tips for grocery shopping and meal planning to make it
as easy as possible to best feed yourself and your family.</p>
<hr />
<p>Besides writing more books, I intend to keep lecturing at medical
schools and speaking at hospitals and conferences for as long as I can.
I’m going to keep trying to ignite the spark that led my colleagues into
the healing profession in the first place: to help people get better.
There are tools missing from too many doctors’ medical toolboxes,
powerful interventions that can make many of our patients well again
instead of merely slowing their decline. I’ll keep working on trying to
change the system, but you, the reader, don’t have to wait. You can
start now by following the recommendations within the following
chapters. Eating healthier is easier than you think, it’s inexpensive,
and it might just save your life.</p>
