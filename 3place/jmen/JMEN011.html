<h4 id="chapter-8-how-not-to-die-from-liver-diseases">CHAPTER 8 How Not
to Die from Liver Diseases</h4>
<p>There are some patients you never forget. On the first day of my GI
rotation (GI stands for gastrointestinal, which means I was about to
come face-to-face with any issues in the digestive tract from mouth to
tush), I reported in and was told to go observe my team of senior
doctors in one of the endoscopy rooms, where physicians use a scope to
look into the GI tract for all manner of routine procedures. I expected
to walk into a colonoscopy looking at a rectal polyp or maybe an upper
endoscopy looking at a stomach ulcer. But I’ll never forget what I saw.
It fuels me to this day in my mission to help people understand the
connection between lifestyle and health (or lack of it).</p>
<p>A sedated patient was lying on a gurney, surrounded by a team of
doctors using a scope with a camera. I looked at the monitor, trying to
find anatomical landmarks to understand where the scope was. It was
definitely down the throat, but the esophagus was snaked with what
looked like throbbing varicose veins. They were everywhere. They looked
like worms trying to emerge from under the smooth surface of the
esophagus. Several had eroded through the lining and were spurting
blood. I watched as more blood surged out with every one of the
patient’s heartbeats. She was basically bleeding to death into her
stomach. The doctors tried desperately to cauterize and tie off these
fountains of fresh red blood, but it was like a game of Whack-A-Mole.
Every time one was cut off, another sprang up.</p>
<p>These were known as esophageal varices—veins swollen with backed-up
blood due to a cirrhotic liver. Watching this nightmare unfold, I
wondered how the patient first came down with cirrhosis. Was she an
alcoholic? Did she contract hepatitis? I remember thinking how
devastated she must have felt when she found out she had end-stage liver
disease. How was her family coping? I was jerked back from my thoughts
by screeching monitor alarms. She was bleeding out.</p>
<p>The doctors couldn’t transfuse blood faster than the patient was
losing it internally. Her blood pressure fell, and her heart stopped.
The staff jumped into action with chest compressions, paddles delivering
shocks, and injections of adrenaline, but within minutes, she was
gone.</p>
<p>It was my job to talk to the patient’s family. I learned that her
cirrhosis was not due to drinking too much or from being an IV drug
user. Her liver had scarred over because she was obese and had developed
a fatty liver. Everything I had just witnessed was preventable, a direct
result of lifestyle choices. When people are overweight, they can suffer
from social stigma, knee problems, and increased risk for metabolic
disorders like diabetes, but this was the first person I saw bleed to
death before my eyes.</p>
<p>The family cried. I cried. I swore to myself I’d do whatever was
necessary to help prevent this from ever happening to anyone under my
care.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can make do with only one kidney. You can survive without a
spleen or a gallbladder. You can even get by without a stomach. But you
can’t live without a liver, the body’s largest internal organ.</p>
<p>What exactly does the liver do? Up to five hundred different
functions have been attributed to this vital organ.1 First and foremost,
it plays the role of bouncer, keeping unwanted guests out of your
bloodstream. Whatever you absorb through your digestive tract isn’t
immediately circulated throughout your body. The blood from your
intestines first goes straight to the liver, where nutrients are
metabolized and toxins are neutralized. It’s no surprise, then, that
what you eat can and does play a critical role in liver health and
disease.</p>
<p>About sixty thousand Americans die of liver disease every year, and
the death rates have risen each of the last five years.2 The incidence
of liver cancer alone has been rising about 4 percent every year over
the last decade.3 Liver dysfunction can run in families, like the
iron-overload disease hemochromatosis. It can be caused by infections
that can lead to liver cancer, or it can stem from drugs—most often
inadvertent or intentional overdoses of Tylenol.4 The most common
causes, however, are drink and food: alcoholic liver disease and fatty
liver disease.</p>
<p>ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE</p>
<p>According to a famous series of papers in the Journal of the American
Medical Association called the “Actual Causes of Death in the United
States” [emphasis added], the leading killer of Americans in the year
2000 was tobacco, followed by diet and inactivity. The third-leading
killer? Alcohol.5 About half of alcohol-related deaths were due to
sudden causes like motor vehicle accidents; the other half were slower,
and the leading cause was alcoholic liver disease.6</p>
<p>Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to an accumulation of fat in
the liver (what’s known as fatty liver), which can cause inflammation
and result in liver scarring and, eventually, liver failure. The CDC
defines excessive drinking as the regular consumption of more than one
drink a day for women and more than two a day for men. A drink is
defined as 12 ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine,
or 1.5 ounces (a “shot”) of hard liquor.7 Progression of the disease can
usually be halted by stopping drinking, but sometimes it’s too
late.8</p>
<p>Heavy alcohol consumption can cause a fatty liver in less than three
weeks,9 but it usually resolves within four to six weeks after stopping
drinking.10 But in 5–15 percent of cases, the disease continues to
progress, and the liver starts to scar despite alcohol cessation.11</p>
<p>Similarly, once alcohol-induced hepatitis (liver inflammation) is
diagnosed, three-year survival rates can be as high as 90 percent among
people who stop drinking after diagnosis.12 But as many as 18 percent of
them go on to develop cirrhosis, an irreparable scarring of the
liver.13</p>
<p>The best strategy to avoid alcoholic liver disease is to not drink so
much in the first place. But if you do drink excessively, help is
available. Though most people who drink may not be alcoholics,14 there
is convincing evidence that twelve-step programs such as Alcoholics
Anonymous can be effective for those who do suffer from alcohol
dependence.15</p>
<hr />
<p>Isn’t Moderate Drinking Beneficial?</p>
<p>Everyone agrees that heavy drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and
binge drinking are bad ideas, but what about “moderate” drinking? Yes,
excessive drinkers appear to significantly shorten their lives, but so
can teetotalers.16 While smoking is bad for you and smoking a lot is
worse, that logic may not hold for alcohol consumption. There actually
appears to be a beneficial effect on overall mortality by drinking some
alcohol—but only, it seems, for those who are not taking good care of
themselves already.17</p>
<p>Moderate drinking does appear to protect against heart disease,
perhaps because of a blood-thinning effect,18 but even light drinking
(less than one drink a day) has been found to increase cancer risk, as
you’ll see in chapter 11. How could something that increases cancer risk
still prolong life? Cancer is “only” our second-leading killer disease.
Because heart disease is the leading cause of death, it explains why
people who drink moderately may live longer lives than those who
abstain. But this advantage may be restricted only to those who fail to
practice a bare modicum of healthy behaviors.19</p>
<p>To find out who might benefit from moderate alcohol consumption,
researchers recruited close to ten thousand men and women and followed
them for seventeen years after assessing their drinking and lifestyle
habits. The results were published in a paper entitled “Who Benefits
Most from the Cardioprotective Properties of Alcohol Consumption—Health
Freaks or Couch Potatoes?” What constituted a “health freak”? According
to the researchers’ definition, anyone who exercises thirty minutes a
day, doesn’t smoke, and eats at least one serving of fruits or
vegetables daily.20 (What does that say about our current diets if
eating a single apple means you’re a “health freak”?)</p>
<p>One to two drinks a day did lower the risk of heart disease for the
“couch potatoes,” those living unhealthy lifestyles. But people who
practiced even the bare minimum of healthy behaviors showed no benefit
from alcohol. The lesson: Grapes, barley, and potatoes are best eaten in
their nondistilled form, and Johnnie Walker is no substitute for actual
walking.</p>
<hr />
<p>NONALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE</p>
<p>The most common cause of a fatty liver is not alcohol but
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). You may remember the
blockbuster documentary Super Size Me, in which the film’s director,
Morgan Spurlock, ate exclusively at McDonald’s for a month. Predictably,
Spurlock’s weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol all went up—but so
did his liver enzymes. That was a sign that his liver cells were dying
and spilling their contents into his bloodstream. How was his diet
causing liver damage? Let’s put it this way: He was beginning to turn
his liver into human foie gras (fatty liver pâté).</p>
<p>Some critics wrote off the film as overly sensational, but
researchers in Sweden took it seriously enough to formally replicate
Spurlock’s one-man experiment. In their study, a group of men and women
agreed to eat two fast-food meals a day. At the start, their liver
enzyme levels were normal, but after just one week of this diet, more
than 75 percent of the volunteers’ liver function test results became
pathological.21 If an unhealthy diet can cause liver damage within just
seven days, it should be no surprise that NAFLD has quietly become the
most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States,
afflicting an estimated seventy million people.22 That’s about one in
three adults. Nearly 100 percent of those with severe obesity may be
affected.23</p>
<p>Like alcoholic fatty liver, NAFLD starts with a buildup of fat
deposits in the liver that cause no symptoms. In rare cases, this can
progress to inflammation and, over years, end up scarring the liver into
a state of cirrhosis, resulting in liver cancer, liver failure, and even
death—as I saw in that endoscopy suite.24</p>
<p>Fast food is so effective at instigating the disease because NAFLD is
associated with the intake of soft drinks and meat. Drinking just one
can of soda a day appears to raise the odds of getting fatty liver
disease by 45 percent.25 Meanwhile, those who eat the meat equivalent of
fourteen chicken nuggets or more daily have nearly triple the rate of
fatty liver disease compared to people who eat seven nuggets’ worth or
less.26</p>
<p>NAFLD has been characterized as a “tale of fat and sugar,”27 but not
all fat affects the liver similarly. People suffering from fatty liver
inflammation were found to be consuming more animal fat (and
cholesterol) but less plant fat (and fiber and antioxidants).28 This may
explain why adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet with plenty of
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans has been associated with
less severe fatty liver disease even though it is not typically a
low-fat diet.29</p>
<p>NAFLD may also be caused by cholesterol overload.30 The dietary
cholesterol found in eggs, meat, and dairy can become oxidized and then
set off a chain reaction that results in excess fat in the liver.31 When
the concentration of cholesterol in your liver cells gets too high, it
can crystallize like rock candy and result in inflammation. This process
is similar to the way uric acid crystals cause gout (as we’ll see in
chapter 10).32 Your white blood cells try to engulf the cholesterol
crystals but then die in the process, spilling out inflammatory
compounds. This may explain how benign fatty liver cases can turn into
serious hepatitis.33</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between diet and serious liver disease,
about nine thousand American adults were studied for thirteen years. The
researchers noted that their most important finding may be that
cholesterol consumption was a strong predictor of cirrhosis and liver
cancer. Those consuming the amount of cholesterol found in two Egg
McMuffins34 or more each day appeared to double their risk of
hospitalization or death.35</p>
<p>Your best bet for avoiding NAFLD, the most common cause of liver
disease, may be to avoid excess calories, cholesterol, saturated fat,
and sugar.</p>
<p>VIRAL HEPATITIS</p>
<p>Another common cause of liver disease is viral hepatitis, which is
triggered by one or more of five different viruses: hepatitis A, B, C,
D, or E. The mode of transmission and prognosis differs for each of
these viruses. Hepatitis A is spread primarily through food or water
that is tainted with contaminated feces. It can be prevented through
vaccination, avoiding raw and undercooked shellfish, and trying to
ensure that everyone who handles your food washes their hands after
changing diapers or using the toilet.</p>
<p>While hepatitis A virus is foodborne, hepatitis B virus is bloodborne
and is transmitted sexually. As with hepatitis A, an effective vaccine
is available against hepatitis B that every child should get. Hepatitis
D virus infection can only occur in someone who is already infected with
hepatitis B and so can be prevented by preventing hepatitis B. So get
vaccinated and refrain from intravenous drug use and unsafe sex.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for the hepatitis C
virus, the most dreaded of liver viruses. Exposure can lead to a chronic
infection that, over decades, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.
Hepatitis C is now the leading cause of liver transplants.36</p>
<hr />
<p>Chlorella and Hepatitis C</p>
<p>The green algae chlorella looks promising for the treatment of
hepatitis C. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found
that about two teaspoons a day of chlorella boosted the activity of
natural killer cells in participants’ bodies, which can naturally kill
hepatitis C-infected cells.37 A clinical study of hepatitis-C patients
found that chlorella supplementation may lower the level of liver
inflammation, but the study was small and uncontrolled.38</p>
<p>There is a desperate need for alternative treatments for hepatitis C,
as older, less expensive therapies frequently fail due to their
unbearable side effects, whereas newer, more tolerable drugs cost as
much as ,000 per pill.39 Chlorella may help as an adjunct (additional)
therapy or for those who can’t tolerate or afford conventional antiviral
therapy but may not be without risk (see here).</p>
<hr />
<p>Hepatitis C is transmitted via blood, usually through sharing needles
rather than via blood transfusions, now that the blood supply is
screened for the virus. However, sharing personal-care items that can be
contaminated with trace amounts of blood, such as toothbrushes and
razors, may also present a risk.40</p>
<p>Although a case was once reported involving a woman who contracted
hepatitis C from sharing a supermarket meat slicer with an infected
coworker,41 the virus would not naturally be present in the meat itself,
as humans and chimpanzees are the only animals who appear susceptible to
it.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for hepatitis E virus.</p>
<p>Preventing Hepatitis E Through Diet</p>
<p>As one of the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis laboratory chiefs
explained in a paper entitled “Much Meat, Much Malady: Changing
Perceptions of the Epidemiology of Hepatitis E,” hepatitis E virus is
now considered a zoonotic disease, able to spread from animals to
humans, and pigs may be the primary viral reservoir.42</p>
<p>The shift in thinking began in 2003, when researchers in Japan linked
the hepatitis E virus (HEV) with the consumption of grilled pork liver.
After testing pig livers from Japanese grocery stores, the researchers
determined that nearly 2 percent of the meat tested positive for HEV.43
In the United States, it was even worse: 11 percent of commercial pig
livers purchased from grocery stores were contaminated with HEV.44</p>
<p>That’s alarming, but how many people really eat pig livers? What
about plain old pork?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pork may harbor HEV as well. Experts suspect that much
of the American population has been exposed to this virus, as there is
known to be a relatively high prevalence of HEV antibodies among U.S.
blood donors. This exposure may be a result of individuals consuming
HEV-contaminated pork.45</p>
<p>So do more people die of liver disease in countries where pork is
more popular? It appears so. The relationship between national per
capita pork consumption and deaths from liver disease correlates as
tightly as per capita alcohol consumption and liver fatalities. Each
pork chop consumed per capita may be associated with about two beers’
worth of increased liver mortality risk on a countrywide scale.46</p>
<p>Aren’t viruses deactivated by cooking? Usually, but there’s always
the problem of cross-contaminating your hands or kitchen surfaces while
handling raw meat. Once meat is in the oven, most foodborne pathogens
can be destroyed by cooking the meat to proper internal cooking
temperatures, with an emphasis on proper. Researchers at the National
Institute of Health subjected the hepatitis E virus to various levels of
heat and found that HEV can survive the internal temperature of meat
cooked rare.47 So if you cook pork, invest in a meat thermometer and
make sure to follow proper handling techniques, including washing
kitchen surfaces with a bleach solution.48</p>
<p>Though most people who develop hepatitis E recover completely, it can
be deadly for pregnant women: The risk of death during the third
trimester can reach as high as 30 percent.49 If you are pregnant, please
be especially careful about pork preparation. And if there are people in
the household who like their pork pink in the middle, they should be
sure to wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom.</p>
<hr />
<p>Weight-Loss Supplements and Liver Disease</p>
<p>We’ve all seen those marketing schemes involving products espousing
all sorts of health claims. And given the pyramid-like multilevel
structure of those types of distribution programs—you earn money by
selling products and also for recruiting others to sell—word can spread
pretty fast, which is particularly troubling when PR outruns the
truth.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the vast majority of drug-induced liver injuries are
caused by conventional medications, liver damage caused by certain
classes of dietary supplements can be even more serious and may lead to
higher rates of liver transplants and death.50 Multilevel marketers of
products later linked to toxic reactions (such as noni juice51 and
Herbalife52) have pointed to scientific studies to support their health
claims. However, a public health review found that such studies often
seemed “deliberately created for marketing purposes” and were presented
in such a way as to appear “designed to mislead potential consumers.”
Often, multilevel marketing study researchers didn’t disclose their
funding sources, but a little detective work can expose a web of
financial conflicts of interest.53</p>
<p>These suspect studies were the same ones cited to provide proof of
safety for their products. For example, a multilevel marketing company
that sells mangosteen juice cited a study they paid for to support its
assertion that their product is “safe for everyone.” The study involved
exposing just thirty people to their product with another ten people
given a placebo. With so few people tested, the stuff could literally
kill 1 or 2 percent of users and you wouldn’t know.54</p>
<p>A study that the multilevel marketing company behind a supplement
called Metabolife cited for safety placed thirty-five people on the
stuff.55 Metabolife has since been withdrawn from the market after being
linked to heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths.56 Hydroxycitric
acid, a component of such products as Hydroxycut, was studied on forty
people.57 No serious adverse effects were found, but the story ended the
same way: Hydroxycut was withdrawn after dozens of verified cases of
organ damage were brought to light—including massive liver failure
requiring transplantation and even death.58 Until the
multibillion-dollar herbal supplement industry is better regulated,
you’re better off saving your money—and your health—by sticking to real
food.</p>
<hr />
<p>PROTECTING THE LIVER AT BREAKFAST</p>
<p>Specific plant foods have been found to be protective of the liver.
For instance, starting out the day with a bowl of oatmeal and
(surprisingly) coffee may help safeguard our liver function.</p>
<p>Oatmeal</p>
<p>In numerous population studies, consumption of whole grains has been
associated with reduced risk for a range of chronic diseases,59 but it’s
hard to tease out whether eating whole grains may just be a marker for a
healthier lifestyle in general. For example, people who eat whole
grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat, and brown rice, also tend to be
more physically active, smoke less, and eat more fruits, vegetables, and
dietary fiber60 than those who might prefer a breakfast of Froot Loops,
for example. No wonder the former group may have lower disease risk.
Fortunately, researchers can control for these factors, effectively
comparing nonsmokers only to nonsmokers with similar diet and exercise
habits. When that’s done, whole grains still appear to be
protective.61</p>
<p>In other words, the evidence seems clear that oatmeal eaters may have
lower rates of disease, but that’s not the same as showing that if you
start eating more oatmeal, your risk will drop. To prove cause and
effect, we need to put it to the test by performing an interventional
trial: Change people’s diets and see what happens. Ideally, researchers
would randomly split people into two groups and give half of them
oatmeal and the other half a placebo—a fake, similar-tasting and
-looking oatmeal. Neither the study subjects nor the researchers
themselves can know who’s in which group until the end. This robust,
double-blind method is easy to use when studying drugs, as you just give
people a sugar pill that looks like the drug in question. As we’ve
discussed, it’s not as easy to make placebo food.</p>
<p>But in 2013, a group of researchers published the first
double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oatmeal in
overweight men and women.62 They found a significant reduction in liver
inflammation in the real oatmeal group, but that may have been because
they lost so much more weight than the controls (that is, the
placebo-oatmeal eaters). Nearly 90 percent of the real-oatmeal-treated
subjects had lost weight, compared with no weight loss, on average,
among the control group. So it may be that the benefits of whole grains
on liver function are indirect.63 A follow-up study in 2014 helped
confirm the findings of a protective role for whole grains in
nonalcoholic fatty liver patients in reducing the risk of liver
inflammation. In this study, refined grain consumption was associated
with increased risk of the disease.64 So lay off the Wonder Bread and
stick to truly wonderful whole-grain foods, including oatmeal.</p>

<p>Making Your Own Whole-Cranberry Cocktail</p>
<p>A specific class of plant compounds called anthocyanins—the purple,
red, and blue pigments in such plants as berries, grapes, plums, red
cabbage, and red onions—have been found to prevent fat accumulation in
human liver cells in in vitro studies.65 A single confirmatory clinical
(human) trial has been published in which a purple sweet potato
concoction successfully dampened liver inflammation better than a
placebo.66</p>
<p>When it came to suppressing the growth of human liver cancer cells in
a petri dish,67 cranberries beat out the other most common fruits in the
United States: apples, bananas, grapefruits, grapes, lemons, oranges,
peaches, pears, pineapples, and strawberries. Other studies have found
that cranberries are also effective in vitro against additional cancers,
including those of the brain,68 breast,69 colon,70 lung,71 mouth,72
ovary,73 prostate,74 and stomach.75 Unfortunately, there have yet to be
clinical studies of the effects of cranberries on cancer patients that
confirm these findings.</p>
<p>Moreover, to the drug industry’s chagrin, scientists have been unable
to pin down the active ingredients involved in cranberries’ special
effects. Extracts concentrating individual components fail to match the
anticancer effects of the cranberry as a whole,76 which of course can’t
be patented. More proof that it’s nearly always best to give preference
to whole foods.</p>
<p>How do you do that with cranberries, though, since they’re so
tart?</p>
<p>It’s not easy at the grocery store. Ninety-five percent of
cranberries are sold in the form of processed products, such as juices
and sauces.77 In fact, to get the same amount of anthocyanins found in a
single cup of fresh or frozen cranberries, you’d have to drink sixteen
cups of cranberry juice cocktail, eat seven cups of dried cranberries,
or make your way through twenty-six cans of cranberry sauce.78 The
ruby-red phytonutrient found in cranberries is a powerful antioxidant,
but the high-fructose corn syrup added to cranberry cocktail acts as a
pro-oxidant, canceling out some of the benefit.79</p>
<p>Here’s a simple recipe for a whole-food version of a tasty cranberry
beverage, what I call my Pink Juice:</p>
<p>1 handful fresh or frozen cranberries</p>
<p>2 cups water</p>
<p>8 teaspoons erythritol (a naturally derived low-calorie sweetener;
read more about erythritol and other sweeteners in part 2)</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend at high speed. Pour
over ice and serve.</p>
<p>At just twelve calories, this recipe has twenty-five times fewer
calories and at least eight times more phytonutrients than typical
cranberry juice drinks.80</p>
<p>For an extra boost, blend in some fresh mint leaves. You’ll get a
weird-looking green foam on top, but not only will it taste good, you’ll
be happy to know that you’re chugging down berries and dark, leafy
greens, two of the healthiest foods on the planet. Bottoms up!</p>

<p>Coffee</p>
<p>Back in 1986, a group of Norwegian researchers came across an
unexpected finding: Alcohol consumption was associated with liver
inflammation (no surprise there), but coffee consumption was associated
with less liver inflammation.81 These results were replicated in
subsequent studies performed around the world. In the United States, a
study was done with people at high risk for liver disease—for example,
those who were overweight or drank too much alcohol. Subjects who drank
more than two cups of coffee a day appeared to have less than half the
risk of developing chronic liver problems as those who drank less than
one cup.82</p>
<p>What about liver cancer, one of the most feared complications of
chronic liver inflammation? It is now the third-leading cause of
cancer-related death, an upsurge driven largely by increases in
hepatitis C infections and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.83</p>
<p>The news is good. A 2013 review of the best studies to date found
that people who drank the most coffee had half the risk of liver cancer
compared to those who drank the least.84 A subsequent study found the
consumption of four or more cups of coffee a day was associated with 92
percent lower risk among smokers dying from chronic liver disease.85 Of
course, quitting smoking would have helped as well; smoking may multiply
by as much as tenfold the odds of those with hepatitis C dying from
liver cancer.86 Similarly, heavy alcohol drinkers who consume more than
four cups of coffee per day appear to reduce their risk of liver
inflammation—but not by nearly as much as people who cut down on
alcohol.87</p>
<p>Liver cancers are among the most avoidable cancers, through hepatitis
B vaccination, control of hepatitis C transmission, and reduction of
alcohol consumption. These three measures could, in principle, wipe out
90 percent of liver cancers worldwide. It remains unclear whether coffee
drinking has an additional role to play, but such a role would be
limited compared with preventing liver damage in the first place.88</p>
<p>But what if you’re already infected with hepatitis C or are among the
nearly one in three American adults89 with nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease? Until relatively recently, no clinical trials had put coffee to
the test. But in 2013, researchers published a study in which forty
patients with chronic hepatitis C were placed into two groups: The first
group consumed four cups of coffee daily for a month, while the second
group drank no coffee at all. After thirty days, the groups switched. Of
course, two months is not long enough to detect changes in cancer
outcomes, but during that time, the researchers were able to demonstrate
that coffee consumption may reduce DNA damage, increase the clearance of
virus-infected cells, and slow the scarring process.90 These results
help explain the role coffee appears to play in reducing the risk of
liver disease progression.</p>
<p>A commentary in the journal Gastroenterology entitled “Is It Time to
Write a Prescription for Coffee?” explored the pros and cons.91 Some
insist that we must first identify the active ingredient in coffee beans
that’s protective. After all, more than one thousand different compounds
have already been found in coffee.92 More studies are needed, but
meanwhile, moderate daily ingestion of unsweetened coffee should be
considered a reasonable adjunct to medical therapy for people at high
risk for liver damage, such as those with fatty liver disease.93 Keep in
mind that daily consumption of caffeinated beverages can lead to
physical dependence, and caffeine withdrawal symptoms can include days
of headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and mood disturbances.94
Ironically, coffee’s tendency to be habit forming could turn out to be a
good thing. If the liver health benefits are confirmed, then daily
consumption may ultimately prove to be an advantage.95</p>
<hr />
<p>With liver disease, as always, prevention is the key. All the most
serious liver conditions—liver cancer, liver failure, and cirrhosis—can
start with an inflamed liver. That inflammation can be caused by an
infection or the buildup of fatty deposits. Liver viruses can be
prevented by common-sense measures. Don’t inject drugs, do get
vaccinated, and do practice safe sex. Liver fat can also be prevented by
common sense measures: Avoid excess consumption of alcohol, calories,
cholesterol, saturated fat, and sugar.</p>
