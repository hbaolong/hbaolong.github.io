<h4 id="chapter-10-how-not-to-die-from-kidney-disease">CHAPTER 10 How
Not to Die from Kidney Disease</h4>
<p>Letters and e-mails from patients never fail to inspire me. One note
that came to mind as I was writing this chapter was from Dan, a retired
NFL player. I first met him when he was forty-two. Even at that
relatively young age, the former professional athlete was already taking
three separate blood pressure medications. Still, his blood pressure was
elevated. He was a little overweight, maybe by twenty-five pounds. He
and his significant other waited around after one of my talks to see
me.</p>
<p>Dan’s physician had just told him that his kidneys were starting to
show signs of damage due to his blood pressure. The first thing I asked
was if he was taking his meds as prescribed, since many people skip
their blood pressure medications because of their unpleasant side
effects. Yes, he assured me, he was. He showed me a checklist he carried
around to keep track of his meds. He asked me what supplements he could
add to the list to help his kidneys.</p>
<p>I told him that no matter what he might have seen on the Internet,
there’s no such magic pill, but if he filled up his plate with lots of
whole, healthy foods each day, the damage might be stopped or even
reversed. Well, Dan took this advice to heart (and to kidney!), and he
allowed me to share his e-mail:</p>
<p>Well, I went home that night and we cleaned house. Got rid of
everything that didn’t grow out of the ground, everything processed. And
guess what, over the next year, I lost my beer belly and the high blood
pressure. Life is so much better without those medications—they made me
feel so tired all the time. And my kidney function is back to normal. It
makes me mad that no one told me this sooner and that I had to feel so
bad before I felt better.</p>
<p>It’s easy to take your kidneys for granted, but they work around the
clock, like a high-tech, nonstop water filter for your blood. They
process up to 150 quarts of blood every twenty-four hours just to make
the 1–2 quarts of urine you pee out each day.</p>
<p>If your kidneys do not function properly, metabolic waste products
can accumulate in the blood and eventually lead to such symptoms as
weakness, shortness of breath, confusion, and abnormal heart rhythms.
Most people with deteriorating kidney function, however, don’t
experience any symptoms at all. If your kidneys fail completely, you
will either need a new one (i.e., need a kidney transplant) or have to
go on dialysis, a process by which a machine artificially filters the
blood. But kidney donors are in short supply, and the average life
expectancy of a person on dialysis is less than three years.1 It’s
better to keep your kidneys healthy in the first place.</p>
<p>Although your kidneys can fail suddenly in response to certain
toxins, infections, or urinary blockage, most kidney disease is
characterized by a gradual loss of function over time. A national survey
found that only 41 percent of Americans tested had normal kidney
function, a drop from 52 percent about a decade earlier.2 Approximately
one in three Americans over the age of sixty-four may suffer from
chronic kidney disease (CKD),3 though three-quarters of the millions
affected may not even know they have it.4 More than half of American
adults currently aged thirty to sixty-four are expected to develop
chronic kidney disease during their lifetimes.5</p>
<p>Why, then, aren’t millions of people on dialysis? Because kidney
malfunction can be so damaging to the rest of the body that most people
don’t live long enough to reach that stage. In a study in which more
than a thousand Americans over age sixty-four with CKD were followed for
a decade, only one in twenty developed end-stage kidney failure. Most of
the others had already died, with cardiovascular disease killing more
than all other causes combined.6 That’s because our kidneys are so
critical to proper heart function that patients under age forty-five
with kidney failure can be a hundred times more likely to die of heart
disease than those with working kidneys.7</p>
<p>The good news? The diets that are healthiest for our hearts—those
centered around unprocessed plant foods—may be the best way to prevent
and treat kidney disease as well.</p>
<p>Damaging Your Kidneys with Diet</p>
<p>Kidneys are highly vascular organs, meaning they’re packed with blood
vessels, which is why they look so red. We’ve already seen that the
standard American diet can be toxic to blood vessels in the heart and
the brain—so what might it be doing to the kidneys?</p>
<p>Putting that question to the test, researchers at Harvard University
followed thousands of healthy women, their diets, and their kidney
function for more than a decade8 to look for the presence of protein in
the women’s urine. Healthy kidneys work hard to retain protein and other
vital nutrients, preferably filtering toxic or useless wastes out of the
bloodstream via our urine. If the kidneys are leaking protein into
urine, it’s a sign that they may be starting to fail.</p>
<p>The researchers found three specific dietary components associated
with this sign of declining kidney function: animal protein, animal fat,
and cholesterol. Each of these is found in only one place: animal
products. The researchers found no association between kidney function
decline and the intake of protein or fat from plant sources.9</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern
pathology, first described fatty degeneration of the kidney.10 This
concept of lipid nephrotoxicity, or the idea that fat and cholesterol in
the bloodstream could be toxic to the kidneys, has since been
formalized,11 based in part on studies that found plugs of fat clogging
up the works in autopsied kidneys.12</p>
<p>The link between cholesterol and kidney disease has gained such
momentum in the medical community that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs
have been recommended to slow its progression.13 But wouldn’t it be
better (not to mention safer and cheaper) to treat the underlying cause
of the disease by eating healthier?</p>
<p>Which Type of Protein Is Better for Our Kidneys?</p>
<p>In the two decades between 1990 and 2010, the leading causes of death
and disability remained relatively constant. As noted in chapter 1,
heart disease is still the leading cause of loss of health and life.
Some diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, have slid down the list, but among the
diseases whose incidence has increased the most over the past generation
is chronic kidney disease. The number of deaths has doubled.14</p>
<p>This has been blamed on our “meat-sweet” diet.15 Excess table sugar
and high-fructose corn syrup consumption is associated with increased
blood pressure and uric acid levels, both of which can damage the
kidney. The saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol found in animal
products and junk food are also associated with impaired kidney
function, and meat protein increases the acid load to the kidneys,
boosting ammonia production and potentially damaging our sensitive
kidney cells.16 This is why a restriction of protein intake is often
recommended to chronic kidney disease patients to help prevent further
functional decline.17</p>
<p>But all protein isn’t created equal. It’s important to understand
that not all protein has the same effect on your kidneys.</p>
<p>High animal protein intake can have a profound influence on normal
human kidney function by inducing a state called hyperfiltration, a
dramatic increase in the workload of the kidney. Hyperfiltration isn’t
harmful if it occurs only occasionally. We all have built-in reserve
kidney function—so much so that people can live with only one kidney.
The human body is thought to have evolved the capacity to handle
intermittent large doses of protein from our remote hunting and
scavenging days. But now many of us are ingesting large doses of animal
protein day after day, forcing our kidneys to call on their reserves
continuously. Over time, this unrelenting stress may explain why kidney
function tends to decline as people age, predisposing even otherwise
healthy people to progressive deterioration of kidney function.18</p>
<p>The reason those who eat a plant-based diet appear to have better
kidney function was originally thought to be due to their lower overall
protein intake.19 However, we now know that it’s more likely due to the
fact that the kidneys appear to handle plant protein very differently
from animal protein.20</p>
<p>Within hours of consuming meat, your kidneys rev up into
hyperfiltration mode. This is true of a variety of animal proteins—beef,
chicken, and fish appear to have similar effects.21 But an equivalent
amount of plant protein causes virtually no noticeable stress on the
kidneys.22 Eat some tuna, and within three hours, your kidney filtration
rate can shoot up 36 percent. But eating the same amount of protein in
the form of tofu doesn’t appear to place any additional strain on the
kidneys.23</p>
<p>Could substituting plant protein for animal protein help slow the
deterioration of kidney function? Yes, half a dozen clinical trials have
shown that plant protein replacement can reduce hyperfiltration and/or
protein leakage,24,25,26,27,28,29 but all these studies were short term,
lasting fewer than eight weeks. It wasn’t until 2014 that a six-month,
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was
performed examining how the kidneys process soy protein versus dairy
protein. Consistent with the other studies, plant protein was found to
help preserve function in ailing kidneys.30</p>
<p>Why does animal protein cause the overload reaction while plant
protein doesn’t? Because of the inflammation animal products can cause.
Researchers discovered that after giving study subjects a powerful
anti-inflammatory drug along with animal protein, the hyperfiltration
response and protein spillage disappeared.31</p>
<p>Reducing Dietary Acid Load</p>
<p>Another reason animal protein may be so detrimental to kidney
function is that it is generally more acid forming. This is because
animal protein tends to have higher levels of sulfur-containing amino
acids, such as methionine, which produce sulfuric acid when metabolized
in the body. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are generally
base forming, which helps neutralize acids in our kidneys.32</p>
<p>Dietary acid load is determined by the balance of acid-inducing foods
(such as meats, eggs, and cheese) and base-inducing foods (such as
fruits and vegetables). A 2014 analysis of the diets and kidney function
of more than twelve thousand Americans across the country found that a
higher dietary acid load was associated with significantly higher risk
of protein leakage into the urine, an indicator of kidney damage.33</p>
<p>Ancient human diets largely consisted of plants, so they likely
produced more base than acid in the kidneys of our ancestors. Humans
evolved eating these alkaline (base-forming) diets over millions of
years. Most contemporary diets, on the other hand, produce acid in
excess. This switch from base- to acid-forming diets may help explain
our modern epidemic of kidney disease.34 Acid-inducing diets are
believed to impact the kidney through “tubular toxicity,” damage to the
tiny, delicate, urine-making tubes in the kidneys. To buffer the excess
acid formed by your diet, kidneys produce ammonia, which is a base and
can neutralize some of that acid. Counteracting the acid is beneficial
in the short term, but over the long run, all the extra ammonia in the
kidneys may have a toxic effect.35 The decline in kidney function over
time may be a consequence of a lifetime of ammonia overproduction.36
Kidneys may start to deteriorate in your twenties,37 and by the time you
reach your eighties, you may be down to half capacity.38</p>
<p>The chronic, low-grade, metabolic acidosis attributed to a meat-rich
diet39 helps explain why people eating plant-based diets appear to have
superior kidney function40 and why various plant-based diets have been
so successful in treating chronic kidney failure.41,42 Under normal
circumstances, a vegetarian diet alkalinizes the kidneys, whereas a
nonvegetarian diet carries an acid load. This proved to be true even
among vegetarians who consumed processed meat substitutes, such as
veggie burgers.43</p>
<p>If people are unwilling to reduce their meat consumption, they should
be encouraged to eat more fruits and vegetables to balance out that acid
load.44 “However,” one kidney doctor editorialized, “many patients find
it difficult to follow a diet high in fruits and vegetables and might
therefore be more adherent to a supplement.”45</p>
<p>So what did researchers try? Giving people baking soda (sodium
bicarbonate) pills. Instead of treating the primary cause of the excess
acid formation (too many animal products and too few fruits and
vegetables), they preferred to treat the consequences. Too much acid?
Here’s some base to neutralize it. Sodium bicarbonate can effectively
buffer the acid load,46 but, rather obviously, sodium bicarbonate
contains sodium, which over the long term may itself contribute to
kidney damage.47</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this type of Band-Aid approach is all too typical of
today’s medical model. Cholesterol too high from eating a diet
unnaturally high in saturated fat and cholesterol? Take a statin drug to
cripple your cholesterol-making enzyme. Diet unnaturally high in
acid-forming foods? Swallow some baking soda pills to balance that right
out.</p>
<p>These same researchers also tried giving people fruits and vegetables
instead of baking soda and found that they offered similar protections,
with the additional advantage of lowering the subjects’ blood pressure.
The title of the accompanying commentary in the medical journal was
telling: “The Key to Halting Progression of CKD Might Be in the Produce
Market, Not in the Pharmacy.”48</p>
<p>Kidney Stones</p>
<p>Eating a plant-based diet to alkalinize your urine may also help
prevent and treat kidney stones—those hard mineral deposits that can
form in your kidneys when the concentration of certain stone-forming
substances in your urine becomes so high they start to crystallize.
Eventually, these crystals can grow into pebble-sized rocks that block
the flow of urine, causing severe pain that tends to radiate from one
side of the lower back toward the groin. Kidney stones can pass
naturally (and often painfully), but some become so large that they have
to be removed surgically.</p>
<p>The incidence of kidney stones has increased dramatically since World
War II49 and even just in the last fifteen years. Approximately one in
eleven Americans are affected today, compared with one in twenty less
than two decades ago.50 What accounts for this rising incidence? The
first clue to an answer came in 1979 when scientists reported a striking
relationship between the prevalence of kidney stones since the 1950s and
increasing consumption of animal protein.51 As in all observational
studies, though, the researchers couldn’t prove cause and effect, so
they decided to perform an interventional trial: They asked the subjects
to add extra animal protein to their daily diets, the equivalent of
about an extra can’s worth of tuna fish. Within two days of eating the
extra tuna, the levels of stone-forming compounds—calcium, oxalate, and
uric acid—shot up such that the subjects’ kidney-stone risk increased
250 percent.52</p>
<p>Note the experimental “high” animal protein diet was designed to
re-create the animal protein intake of the average American,53
suggesting that Americans could considerably lower their risk of kidney
stones by lowering their meat intake.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, enough evidence had accumulated that researchers began
to ask whether people suffering from recurrent kidney stones should stop
eating meat altogether.54 A study on the kidney stone risk of
vegetarians wasn’t published until 2014, though. Oxford University
researchers found that subjects who didn’t eat meat at all had a
significantly lower risk of being hospitalized for kidney stones, and
for those who did eat meat, the more they ate, the higher their
associated risk.55</p>
<p>Is some meat worse than others? People who form kidney stones are
commonly advised to restrict their intake of red meat, but what about
chicken or fish? We didn’t know until another 2014 study compared salmon
and cod to chicken breasts and burgers. It found that gram for gram,
fish might be slightly worse than other meat in terms of the risk of
certain kidney stones, but they concluded that overall, “[s]tone formers
should be counseled to limit the intake of all animal proteins.”56</p>
<p>Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate, which forms like
rock candy when urine becomes supersaturated with calcium and oxalates.
For many years, doctors assumed that because the stones are made of
calcium, they should counsel their patients to simply reduce their
calcium intake.57 As with so much in medicine, clinical practice often
flies blind without solid experimental support. This changed with a
landmark study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which
pitted the traditional, low-calcium diet against a diet low in animal
protein and sodium. After five years, the study found that eating less
meat and salt was about twice as effective as the conventionally
prescribed low-calcium diet, cutting kidney-stone risk by half.58</p>
<p>What about cutting down on oxalates, which are concentrated in
certain vegetables? Reassuringly, a recent study found there was no
increased risk of stone formation with higher vegetable intake. In fact,
greater intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a reduced
risk independent of other known risk factors, meaning there may be
additional benefits to bulking up on plant foods above and beyond
restricting animal foods.59</p>
<p>Another reason a reduction in animal protein is helpful is that it
lowers uric acid buildup, which can form crystals that seed calcium
stones or form stones all by itself. Indeed, uric acid stones are the
second most common type of kidney stones. So it makes sense that to
reduce your risk, you should try to reduce excess uric acid production.
This can be accomplished either of two ways: by adding drugs or by
subtracting meat.60 Uric acid–blocking medications like allopurinol may
be effective, but they can have serious side effects.61 On the other
hand, removing all meat from a standard Western diet appears to reduce
the risk of uric acid crystallization by more than 90 percent within as
few as five days.62</p>
<p>Bottom line: When urine is more alkaline, stones are less likely to
form. This helps explain why less meat and more fruits and vegetables
appear so protective. The standard American diet yields acidic urine.
When people are placed on a plant-based diet, however, their urine can
be alkalinized up to a near neutral pH in less than a week.63</p>
<p>Not all plant foods are alkalinizing, though, and not all animal
foods are equally acidifying. The LAKE (Load of Acid to Kidney
Evaluation) score takes into account both the acid load of foods and
their typical serving sizes in order to help people modify their diets
for the prevention of kidney stones and other acid-related diseases,
such as gout. As you can see in figure 4, the single most acid-producing
food was fish, including tuna, followed by pork, poultry, cheese, and
beef. Eggs are actually more acid producing than beef, but people tend
to eat fewer of them at one sitting. Some grains can be a little acid
forming, such as bread and rice, but not pasta, interestingly. Beans are
significantly acid reducing, but not as much as fruits are, with
vegetables crowned the most alkaline forming of foods.64</p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>Dietary changes can be so powerful they can not only help prevent
kidney stones but also, in some cases, cure them without drugs or
surgery. Uric acid stones can apparently be dissolved away completely
with a combination of eating more fruits and vegetables, restricting
animal protein and salt intake, and drinking at least ten glasses of
fluid a day.65</p>
<hr />
<p>Testing Your “Pee-H” with Purple Cabbage</p>
<p>We know that the average Western diet is acid producing, while the
average plant-based diet is acid reducing.66 Eating an acid-forming diet
can not only affect kidney stone risk but may also produce the systemic,
chronic, low-grade metabolic acidosis67—excess acid in the
bloodstream—that is thought to contribute to muscle breakdown as you
age.68 So what’s the best way to determine how acid forming your diet
really is? Perhaps the easiest (and most boring) method is to order some
pH paper strips to pee on. Alternatively, why not use what you (should)
have right now in your refrigerator’s crisper: purple cabbage. Purple,
or red, cabbage provides one of the single best nutritional bangs for
your buck, and you can even use it to perform kitchen chemistry
experiments, or in this case, bathroom chemistry.</p>
<p>Boil some purple cabbage until the water turns deep purple, or blend
raw cabbage with some water and then strain out the solids. Pee into
your toilet then take your purple-cabbage cocktail and pour it into the
toilet bowl. (Low-flow toilets work best, because there’s less water in
the bowl.) If the liquid in the toilet bowl remains purple or, even
worse, turns pink, your urine is too acidic. Blue is the target. If your
pee and cabbage water turns blue, your urine is not acidic but neutral
or even basic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Preventing Excess Phosphorus Intake</p>
<p>Having too much phosphorus in the blood may increase the risk of
kidney failure, heart failure, heart attacks, and premature death.
Excess phosphorus also appears to damage our blood vessels and
accelerate aging and bone loss.69 As such, elevated levels appear to be
an independent risk factor for early death among the general
population.70</p>
<p>Phosphorus is found in a variety of plant and animal foods. Most
Americans consume about twice as much phosphorus as they need,71 but
it’s not just about how much you eat but how much you absorb. By
switching to a plant-based diet, you can achieve a significant drop in
your blood phosphorus levels even as your intake levels of the mineral
remains constant.72 This occurs because the phosphorus in animal foods
appears in the form of a compound called phosphate, which is absorbed
into the bloodstream more readily than phytate, the predominant form of
phosphorus in plant foods.73 As you may remember from chapter 4, this
situation is similar to the case of iron, another essential mineral of
which you can get too much. Your body can better protect itself from
absorbing too much plant-based iron, but it can’t as effectively stop
surplus muscle or blood-based (heme) iron from slipping through the
intestinal wall.</p>
<p>The worst type of phosphorus, though, is that found in phosphate food
additives. These phosphorus compounds are added to cola drinks and meat
to enhance their color.74 (Without added phosphate, Coca-Cola would be
pitch black.75) Less than half of most plant phosphorus76 and about
three-quarters of natural animal product phosphorus gets into your
bloodstream,77 but added phosphate can be absorbed at a rate of nearly
100 percent.78</p>
<p>Phosphate additives play an especially important role in the meat
industry. Chicken meat is often injected with phosphates to improve its
color, to add water weight (and thus to increase profitability since
chicken can be sold by the pound), and to reduce “purge,” the term used
to describe the liquid that seeps from meat as it ages.79 The problem
with this additive is that it can nearly double the phosphorous levels
in meat.80 Phosphate additives have been described as “a real and
insidious danger” for kidney patients, since they have diminished
capacity to excrete it,81 but given what we now know about excess
phosphorus, it’s a concern for us all.</p>
<p>In the United States, eleven different types of phosphate salts are
allowed to be injected into raw meat and poultry,82 a practice that’s
long been banned in Europe.83 This is because phosphates found in meat
and processed foods are considered “vascular toxins,”84 capable of
impairing our arterial function within hours of consuming a
high-phosphate meal.85 In meat, there’s an additional food safety
concern, as adding phosphate may increase the growth of leading food
poisoning bacteria Campylobacter in poultry purge up to a
millionfold.86</p>
<p>It’s easy to avoid added phosphorus in processed foods—just don’t buy
anything containing ingredients with the word “phosphate” in their
names, including pyrophosphate and sodium triphosphate.87 With meat,
it’s more difficult to determine the phosphate content, as producers
aren’t required to disclose injected additives. Added phosphate may be
labeled as “flavorings” or “broth” or not labeled at all.88 Meat already
contains highly absorbable phosphates; adding more may just add insult
to kidney injury. Chicken appears to be the worst offender: A
supermarket survey found more than 90 percent of chicken products
contained phosphate additives.89</p>

<p>Who Determines Whether Food Additives Are Safe?</p>
<p>In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finally announced its
plans to all but eliminate trans fats from processed foods,90 citing a
CDC estimate that as many as twenty thousand heart attacks each year
could be prevented by eliminating partially hydrogenated oils.91 Until
June 16, 2015, trans fats enjoyed so-called GRAS status: “generally
recognized as safe.”</p>
<p>Why were these killer fats deemed safe in the first place?</p>
<p>Guess who makes the “generally recognized as safe” determination?
It’s not the government or a scientific body. It’s the manufacturer. You
read that right. The food maker gets to determine whether or not its own
product is safe for the public, a process the FDA refers to as “GRAS
self-determination.” What’s more, these manufacturers can legally add
things to our food supply without informing the FDA.92 An estimated one
thousand food-additive safety decisions have never even been reported to
the FDA or the public.93</p>
<p>But sometimes food manufacturers do notify the FDA when they
introduce a new additive. Sounds responsible of them, doesn’t it?
Presumably they found some independent, third-party panel to evaluate
the safety of their product so as to avoid a financial conflict of
interest, right?</p>
<p>Well, not exactly.</p>
<p>Of all the GRAS safety determinations that were voluntarily submitted
to the FDA between 1997 and 2012, 22.4 percent were made by someone
directly employed by the manufacturer itself, 13.3 percent were made by
someone directly employed by a firm handpicked by the manufacturer, and
64.3 percent were made by a panel either handpicked by the manufacturer
or chosen by a firm hired by the manufacturer.94 Are you doing the math?
Yes, zero food safety decisions were made independently.</p>
<p>How could regulators let companies decide for themselves whether the
food additives they use in their own products are safe? Follow the
money. Three of Washington’s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work
for the food industry.95 For example, PepsiCo alone spent more than
million in a single year to lobby Congress.96 The deeper you dig, the
less surprising it is that such food additives as trans fats have been
allowed to kill thousands year after year.</p>
<p>But hey, according to the manufacturer, they’re safe …</p>
<hr />
<p>Can Diet Protect Against Kidney Cancer?</p>
<p>Each year, sixty-four thousand Americans are diagnosed with kidney
cancer, and about fourteen thousand die from it.97 Approximately 4
percent of these cases are hereditary,98 but what about the other 96
percent?</p>
<p>Historically, the only accepted risk factor for kidney cancer has
been tobacco use.99 A class of carcinogens in cigarette smoke called
nitrosamines are considered to be so harmful that even so-called
thirdhand smoke is a concern. The risks of tobacco smoke do not end when
a cigarette is extinguished, as residual smoke can stick to walls and
other surfaces.100 Around 80 percent of nitrosamines from cigarette
smoke can remain in a room, even with normal ventilation,101 so always
try to choose smoke-free hotel rooms. Nitrosamines are one of the
reasons you can’t smoke indoors without endangering others, even if you
smoke without anyone present. As one of the leading scholars in the
tobacco control movement recently wrote, “Carcinogens of this strength
in any other consumer product designed for human consumption would be
banned immediately.”102</p>
<p>Except for one: meat.</p>
<p>Did you know that one hot dog has as many nitrosamines (and
nitrosamides, which are similar tobacco carcinogens103) as four
cigarettes and that these carcinogens are also found in fresh meat,
including beef, chicken, and pork?104 This may help explain the rising
rates of kidney cancer over the last few decades despite the falling
rates of smoking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Clearing the Confusion: Nitrates, Nitrites, and Nitrosamines</p>
<p>Although fresh meat also contains nitrosamines, processed or cured
meat like deli slices may be particularly harmful. In Europe, the
world’s second-largest prospective study on diet and cancer calculated
that a reduction in processed meat consumption to less than twenty grams
a day—less than a small matchbook-sized portion—would prevent more than
3 percent of all deaths.105 In the largest such investigation the
NIH-AARP study of more than five hundred thousand Americans (see here)
found the preventable fraction of deaths may be even higher. The
researchers suggested, for example, that 20 percent of heart disease
deaths among American women could be averted if the highest consumers of
processed meat would cut down to the equivalent of less than a half
strip of bacon a day.106 No wonder the American Institute for Cancer
Research recommends that you simply “avoid processed meat such as ham,
bacon, salami, hot dogs and sausages.”107</p>
<p>Nitrites are added to cured meat as a “color fixative” and to help
prevent the growth of botulism bacteria (a rare but serious paralytic
illness).108 What about “uncured” bacon? It says right on the package:
“No nitrites or nitrates added.” But study the fine print and you may
see a little footnote that reads something like “except those naturally
occurring in celery juice.” Vegetables do contain nitrates that can be
fermented into nitrites, so adding fermented celery juice to bacon is
just a sneaky way of adding nitrites. Even commentators in the journal
Meat Science have realized this may be perceived by consumers as
“incorrect at best or deceptive at worst.”109</p>
<p>But the same fermentation that converts nitrates to nitrites can
happen when you eat vegetables, thanks to bacteria on your tongue. So
why are vegetable nitrates and nitrites okay but the same compounds from
meat are linked to cancer?110 Because nitrites themselves are not
carcinogenic; they turn into carcinogens. Nitrites only become harmful
when they turn into nitrosamines and nitrosamides. For them to do that,
amines and amides must be present, and amines and amides are found in
abundance in animal products. This transformation can happen in the meat
itself or in your stomach after you eat it. In the case of plant foods,
the vitamin C and other antioxidants that are found naturally in them
block the formation of these carcinogens in your body.111 This process
would explain why intake of both nitrate and nitrite from processed meat
has been linked to kidney cancer, but no increased risk was found for
nitrate or nitrite intake from plant sources.112</p>
<p>While nitrite from animal sources—not just processed meats—was
associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, some of the highest
nitrate-containing vegetables, such as arugula, kale, and collards, are
associated with significantly reduced risk for kidney cancer.113</p>
<hr />
<p>Kidneys are tasked with the monumental responsibility of filtering
your blood all day, every day. That’s a lot of work for two fist-sized
organs. Kidneys are extremely resilient, but they aren’t indestructible.
When they begin to fail, the body can start failing too. Toxic
substances that healthy kidneys would ordinarily filter out can pass
through and build up in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>To keep your kidneys strong and your blood clean, you must carefully
consider what you eat. The meat-sweet American diet can slowly damage
your kidneys one meal at a time, forcing the kidneys into a state of
hyperfiltration. Imagine how long your car engine would last if you
always revved it near the red line? Thankfully, medical science has
proven that you can reduce your kidneys’ workload (and acid load) by
moving toward a more plant-based diet.</p>
