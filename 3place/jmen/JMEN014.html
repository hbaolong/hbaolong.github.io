<h4 id="chapter-11-how-not-to-die-from-breast-cancer">CHAPTER 11 How Not
to Die from Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>“You have breast cancer.”</p>
<p>These are among the most feared words a woman can hear, and for a
good reason. Besides skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common
cancer among American women. Every year, about 230,000 are diagnosed
with breast cancer, and 40,000 die from it.1</p>
<p>Breast cancer does not occur overnight. That lump you feel in the
shower one morning may have started forming decades ago. By the time
doctors detect the tumor, it may have been present for forty years or
even longer.2 The cancer has been growing, maturing, and acquiring
hundreds of new survival-of-the-fittest mutations that allow it to grow
even more quickly as it tries to outmaneuver your immune system.</p>
<p>The scary reality is that what doctors call “early detection” is
actually late detection. Modern imaging simply isn’t good enough to
detect cancer at its earliest stages, so it can spread long before it’s
even spotted. A woman is considered “healthy” until she shows signs or
symptoms of breast cancer. But if she has been harboring a malignancy
for two decades, can she truly be considered healthy?</p>
<p>People who are doing the right thing by improving their diets in
hopes of preventing cancer may in fact be successfully treating it as
well. Autopsy studies have shown that as many as 20 percent of women
aged twenty to fifty-four who died from unrelated causes, such as car
accidents, had so-called “occult” (or hidden) breast cancers growing
inside them.3 Sometimes there’s nothing you can do to prevent the
initiation stage of cancer, when that first normal breast cell mutates
into a cancerous one. Some breast cancers may even start in the womb and
be related to your mother’s diet.4 For this reason, we all need to
choose a diet and lifestyle that not only prevents the initiation stage
of cancer but also hampers the promotion stage, during which the cancer
grows to a size large enough to pose a threat.</p>
<p>The good news is that no matter what your mom ate or how you lived as
a child, by eating and living healthfully, you may be able to slow the
growth rate of any hidden cancers. In short, you can die with your
tumors rather than from them. This is how dietary cancer prevention and
treatment can end up being the same thing.</p>
<p>One or two cancer cells never hurt anyone. But how about a billion
cancer cells? That’s how many may be in a tumor5 by the time it’s picked
up by a mammogram.6 Like most tumors, breast cancer starts with just one
cell, which divides to become two, four, and then eight. Every time
breast cancer cells divide, the tumor can effectively double in
size.7</p>
<p>Let’s see how many times a tiny tumor has to double to get to a
billion cells. Take out a calculator. Multiply one times two. Then
multiply that number by two. Keep doing that until you reach one
billion. Don’t worry. It won’t take long. It’s only thirty doublings. In
just thirty doublings, a single cancer cell can turn into a billion.</p>
<p>The key to how quickly you’d be diagnosed with cancer, then, is the
doubling time. How long does it take tumors to double once? Breast
cancers can double in size in anywhere from as few as twenty-five days8
to a thousand days or more.9 In other words, it could be two years, or
it could be more than a hundred years, before a tumor starts to cause
problems.</p>
<p>Where you fall on that timescale—two years or a century—may depend in
part on what you eat.</p>
<p>When I was teen, I ate a lousy diet. One of my favorite meals was—no
joke—chicken-fried steak. During my youth, I may have caused one of the
cells in my colon or prostate to mutate. But I’ve been eating much
healthier for the last twenty-five years. My hope is that even if I did
initiate a cancerous growth, if I don’t promote it, I may be able to
slow down its growth. I don’t care if I get diagnosed with cancer a
hundred years from now. I don’t expect to be around at that point to
worry about it.</p>
<p>Current controversy over the cost and effectiveness of mammograms10
misses an important point: Breast cancer screening, by definition, does
not prevent breast cancer. It can just pick up existing breast cancer.
Based on autopsy studies, as many as 39 percent of women in their
forties already have breast cancers growing within their bodies that may
be simply too small to be detected by mammograms.11 That’s why you can’t
just wait until diagnosis to start eating and living healthier. You
should start tonight.</p>
<p>RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER</p>
<p>The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is considered one
of the world’s leading authorities on diet and cancer. Based on the best
available research, it came up with ten recommendations for cancer
prevention.12 Beyond never chewing tobacco, their bottom-line dietary
message was: “Diets that revolve around whole plant foods—vegetables,
whole grains, fruits and beans—cut the risk of many cancers, and other
diseases as well.”13</p>
<p>To demonstrate how dramatically lifestyle choices can impact breast
cancer risk, over the course of about seven years, researchers followed
a group of about thirty thousand postmenopausal women with no history of
breast cancer. Achieving just three of the ten AICR
recommendations—limiting alcohol, eating mostly plant foods, and
maintaining a normal body weight—was associated with a 62 percent lower
risk of breast cancer.14 Yes, three simple health behaviors appeared to
cut risk by more than half.</p>
<p>Remarkably, eating a plant-based diet along with walking every day
can improve our cancer defenses within just two weeks. Researchers
dripped the blood of women before and after fourteen days of healthy
living onto breast cancer cells growing in petri dishes. The blood taken
after they started eating healthier suppressed cancer growth
significantly better and killed 20–30 percent more cancer cells than the
blood taken from the same women just two weeks before.15 The researchers
attributed this effect to a decrease in levels of a cancer-promoting
growth hormone called IGF-1,16 likely due to the reduced intake of
animal protein.17</p>
<p>What kind of blood do you want in your body—what kind of immune
system? The kind of blood that just rolls over when new cancer cells pop
up, or blood that circulates to every nook and cranny in your body with
the power to slow down and stop cancer cells in their tracks?</p>
<p>Alcohol</p>
<p>In 2010, the official World Health Organization body that assesses
cancer risks formally upgraded its classification of alcohol to a
definitive human breast carcinogen.18 In 2014, it clarified its position
by stating that, regarding breast cancer, no amount of alcohol is
safe.19</p>
<p>But what about drinking “responsibly”? In 2013, scientists published
a compilation of more than one hundred studies on breast cancer and
light drinking (up to one alcoholic beverage a day). The researchers had
found a small but statistically significant increase in breast cancer
risk even among women who had at most one drink per day (except,
perhaps, for red wine—see box below). They estimated that, every year
around the world, nearly five thousand breast cancer deaths may be
attributable to light drinking.20</p>
<p>The carcinogen isn’t alcohol itself. The culprit is actually the
toxic breakdown product of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can form
in your mouth almost immediately after you take a sip. Experiments show
that even holding a single teaspoon of hard liquor in your mouth for
five seconds before spitting it out results in the production of
potentially carcinogenic levels of acetaldehyde that lingers for more
than ten minutes.21</p>
<p>If even a single sip of alcohol might produce cancer-causing levels
of acetaldehyde in the mouth, what about using mouthwash that contains
alcohol? Researchers who tested the effects of a variety of retail
mouthwashes and oral rinses concluded that, although the risk is slight,
it is probably best to refrain from using such products if they contain
alcohol.22</p>
<hr />
<p>Red Wine Versus White Wine</p>
<p>The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study found that even less than one drink
a day may be associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk.23
Interestingly, drinking only red wine was not associated with breast
cancer risk. Why? A compound in red wine appears to suppress the
activity of an enzyme called estrogen synthase, which breast tumors can
use to create estrogen to fuel their own growth.24 This compound is
found in the skin of the dark-purple grapes used to make red wine, which
explains why white wine appears to provide no such benefit,25 since it’s
produced without the skin.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that red wine may “ameliorate the elevated
breast cancer risk associated with alcohol intake.”26 In other words,
the grapes in red wine may help cancel out some of the cancer-causing
effects of the alcohol. But you can reap the benefits without the risks
associated with imbibing alcoholic beverages by simply drinking grape
juice or, even better, eating the purple grapes themselves—preferably
ones with seeds, as they appear to be most effective at suppressing
estrogen synthase.27</p>
<p>It’s good (and delicious) to know that strawberries,28
pomegranates,29 and plain white mushrooms30 may also suppress the
potentially cancer-promoting enzyme.</p>
<hr />
<p>Melatonin and Breast Cancer Risk</p>
<p>For billions of years, life on planet Earth evolved under conditions
of about twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Humans
controlled fire for cooking about a million years ago, but we’ve only
been using candles for about five thousand years and electric lights for
a mere century. In other words, our ancient ancestors lived half their
lives in the dark.</p>
<p>These days, though, because of the electric-light pollution at night,
the only Milky Way your children may see is inside a candy wrapper.
Electric lighting has enabled us to remain productive well into the wee
hours, but might this unnatural nighttime light exposure have any
adverse health effects?</p>
<p>In philosophy, there’s a flawed argument called the appeal-to-nature
fallacy, in which someone proposes that something is good merely because
it’s natural. In biology, however, this may hold some truth. The
conditions under which our bodies were finely tuned over millions of
years can sometimes give us insight into our optimal functioning. For
example, we evolved running around naked in equatorial Africa.
Therefore, it’s not surprising that many of us modern humans become
deficient in vitamin D (the “sunshine vitamin”) if we live in Northern
climes or in countries where the culture dictates full-body coverings
for women.31</p>
<p>Could something as ubiquitous as the lightbulb be a mixed blessing?
Right in the middle of your brain sits the pineal gland, your so-called
third eye. It’s connected to your actual eyes and has just one function:
to produce a hormone called melatonin. During the day, the pineal gland
is inactive. But once the sky darkens, it activates and begins pumping
melatonin into your bloodstream. You start getting tired, feel less
alert, and start thinking about sleep. Melatonin secretion may peak
between 2:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. and then shuts off at daybreak, which is
your cue to wake up. The level of melatonin in your bloodstream is one
of the ways your internal organs know what time it is. It functions as
one hand on your circadian clock.32</p>
<p>Besides helping to regulate your sleep, melatonin is thought to play
another role—suppressing cancer growth. Think of melatonin as helping to
put cancer cells to sleep at night.33 To see if this function applies to
preventing breast cancer, researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital
in Boston and elsewhere came up with the clever idea of studying blind
women. The thought was that because blind women can’t see sunlight,
their pineal glands never stop secreting melatonin into their
bloodstreams. Sure enough, the researchers found that blind women may
have just half the odds of breast cancer as sighted women.34</p>
<p>Conversely, women who interrupt their melatonin production by working
night shifts appear to be at increased risk for breast cancer.35 Even
living on a particularly brightly lit street may affect the risk.
Studies comparing nighttime satellite photos against breast cancer rates
have found that people living in brighter neighborhoods tend to have a
higher breast cancer risk.36,37,38 Therefore, it’s probably best to
sleep without any lights on and with the blinds down, though the
evidence to support these strategies is limited.39</p>
<p>Melatonin production can be gauged by measuring the amount of
melatonin excreted in our first pee in the morning. And, indeed, women
with higher melatonin secretion have been found to have lower rates of
breast cancer.40 Other than minimizing nighttime light exposure, is
there anything else you can do to keep up your production of melatonin?
Apparently so. In 2005, Japanese researchers reported an association
between higher vegetable intake and higher melatonin levels in the
urine.41 Is there anything in your diet that may lower melatonin
production, thereby potentially increasing breast cancer risk? We didn’t
know until a comprehensive study of diet and melatonin was published in
2009. Researchers at Harvard University asked nearly a thousand women
about their consumption of thirty-eight different foods or food groups
and measured their morning melatonin levels. Meat consumption was the
only food significantly associated with lower melatonin production, for
reasons that are yet unknown.42</p>
<p>Minimizing melatonin disruption may therefore mean putting curtains
on your windows, eating more vegetables, and lowering the curtain on
eating too much meat.</p>
<hr />
<p>Exercise and Breast Cancer</p>
<p>Physical activity is considered a promising preventive measure
against breast cancer43 not only because it helps with weight control
but because exercise tends to lower circulating estrogen levels.44 Five
hours a week of vigorous aerobic exercise can lower estrogen and
progesterone exposure by about 20 percent.45 But do you need to work out
that long for it to be protective?</p>
<p>Although even light exercise is associated with lowered risk of some
other types of cancer, for breast cancer, leisurely strolls don’t appear
to cut it.46 Even an hour a day of activities such as slow dancing or
light housework may not help.47 According to the largest study ever
published on the subject, only women who worked up a sweat at least five
or more times a week appeared to get significant protection.48
Moderately intense activity may offer as much benefit as vigorous
exercise, though.49 Walking at a moderate pace for an hour a day is
considered a moderately intense level of exercise, but it wasn’t put to
the test until a 2013 study reported that, indeed, walking an hour a day
or more is associated with significantly lower breast cancer risk.50</p>
<p>Darwin was right: It’s survival of the fittest—so get fit!</p>
<hr />
<p>Heterocyclic Amines</p>
<p>In 1939, a curious finding was published in a paper titled “Presence
of Cancer-Producing Substances in Roasted Food.” A researcher described
how he could induce breast cancers in mice by painting their heads with
extracts of roasted horse muscle.51 These “cancer-producing substances”
have since been identified as heterocyclic amines (HCAs), described by
the National Cancer Institute as “chemicals formed when muscle meat,
including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, is cooked using
high-temperature methods.”52 These cooking methods include roasting, pan
frying, grilling, and baking. Eating boiled meat is probably the safest.
People who eat meat that never goes above 212 degrees Fahrenheit produce
urine and feces that are significantly less DNA-damaging compared to
those eating meat dry-cooked at higher temperatures.53 This means they
have fewer mutagenic substances flowing through their bloodstreams and
coming in contact with their colons. On the other hand, baking chicken
for as few as fifteen minutes at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit leads to
HCA production.54</p>
<p>These carcinogens are formed in a high-temperature chemical reaction
between some of the components of muscle tissue. (The lack of some of
these substances in plants may explain why even fried veggie burgers
don’t contain measurable HCAs.)55 The longer meat is cooked, the more
HCAs form. This process may explain why eating well-done meat is
associated with increased risk of cancers of the breast, colon,
esophagus, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach.56 The situation
creates what the Harvard Health Letter called a meat preparation
“paradox”57: Cooking meat thoroughly reduces the risk of contracting
foodborne infections (see chapter 5), but cooking meat too thoroughly
may increase the risk of foodborne carcinogens.</p>
<p>Just because heterocyclic amines cause cancer in rodents doesn’t mean
they cause cancer in humans. In this case, though—it turns out people
may be even more susceptible. The livers of rodents have shown an
uncanny ability to detoxify 99 percent of the HCAs scientists stuffed
down the animals’ throats (a technique known as gavage).58 But then, in
2008, researchers discovered that the livers of humans fed cooked
chicken were only able to detoxify about half of these carcinogens,
suggesting that the cancer risk is far higher than was previously
thought based on experiments in rats.59</p>
<p>The carcinogens found in cooked meat are thought to explain why, as
the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project reported in 2007, women who
eat more grilled, barbecued, or smoked meats over their lifetimes may
have as much as 47 percent higher odds of breast cancer.60 And the Iowa
Women’s Health Study found that women who ate their bacon, beefsteak,
and burgers “very well done” had nearly five times the odds of getting
breast cancer compared with women who preferred these meats served rare
or medium.61</p>
<p>To see what was happening inside the breast, researchers asked women
undergoing breast-reduction surgery about their meat-cooking methods.
The scientists were able to link the consumption of fried meat with the
amount of DNA damage found within the women’s breast tissue,62 the type
of damage that can potentially cause a normal cell to mutate into a
cancer cell.63</p>
<p>HCAs appear able both to initiate and to promote cancer growth. PhIP,
one of the most abundant HCAs in cooked meat, was found to have potent
estrogen-like effects, fueling human breast-cancer cell growth almost as
powerfully as pure estrogen,64 on which most human breast tumors thrive.
But that result was based on research in a petri dish. How do we know
that cooked-meat carcinogens find their way into human breast ducts,
where most breast cancers arise? We didn’t, until researchers measured
the levels of PhIP in the breast milk of nonsmoking women. (HCAs are
also found in cigarette smoke.)65 In this study, PhIP was found in the
breast milk of women who ate meat at the same concentration known to
significantly boost breast cancer cell growth.66 No trace of PhIP was
found in the breast milk of the one vegetarian participant.67</p>
<p>A similar finding was reported in a study comparing the levels of
PhIP in people’s hair. The chemical was detected in hair samples of all
six of the meat eaters tested, but in only one of the six vegetarians.68
(HCAs can also be found in fried eggs.)69</p>
<p>Your body can rapidly rid itself of these toxins once exposure
ceases. In fact, urine levels of PhIP can drop to zero within
twenty-four hours of refraining from eating meat.70 So if you practice
Meatless Mondays, the level of PhIP passing through your body may become
undetectable by Tuesday morning. But diet is not the only source of
PhIP. HCA levels in vegetarians who smoke may approach those of
nonsmoking meat eaters.71</p>
<p>The heterocyclic amine PhIP is not just a so-called complete
carcinogen, able to both initiate cancers and then promote their growth.
PhIP may also then facilitate cancer spread. Cancer develops in three
major stages: 1) initiation, the irreversible DNA damage that starts the
process; 2) promotion, the growth and division of the initiated cell
into a tumor; and 3) progression, which can involve the invasion of the
tumor into surrounding tissue and metastasis (spread) to other areas of
the body.</p>
<p>Scientists can test how invasive, or aggressive, a certain cancer is
by putting its cells into an instrument called an invasion chamber. They
place cancer cells on one side of a porous membrane and then gauge their
ability to penetrate and spread through the membrane. When researchers
placed metastatic breast cancer cells from a fifty-four-year-old woman
in an invasion chamber all by themselves, relatively few were able to
breach the barrier. But within seventy-two hours of adding PhIP to the
chamber, the cancer cells became more invasive, crawling through the
membrane at an accelerated rate.72</p>
<p>PhIP in meat may therefore represent a three-strikes-you’re-out type
of carcinogen, potentially involved in every stage of breast cancer
development. Staying away from the stuff isn’t easy, though, eating the
standard American diet. As the researchers note: “Exposure to PhIP is
difficult to avoid because of its presence in many commonly consumed
cooked meats, particularly chicken, beef and fish.”73</p>
<p>Cholesterol</p>
<p>Remember earlier when we discussed the American Institute for Cancer
Research? A study found that following its guidelines for cancer
prevention appeared to reduce not just breast cancer risk but also heart
disease risk.74 What’s more, not only may eating healthier to prevent
cancer help to prevent heart disease but eating to prevent heart disease
may also help to prevent cancer. One of the reasons? Cholesterol may
play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer.75</p>
<p>Cancer appears to feed on cholesterol. LDL cholesterol stimulates the
growth of breast cancer cells in a petri dish—they just gobble up the
so-called bad cholesterol. Tumors may suck up so much cholesterol that
cancer patients’ cholesterol levels tend to plummet as their cancer
grows.76 This is not a good sign, as patient survival tends to be lowest
when cholesterol uptake is highest.77 The cancer is thought to be using
the cholesterol to make estrogen or to shore up tumor membranes to help
the cancer migrate and invade more tissue.78 In other words, breast
tumors may take advantage of high circulating cholesterol levels to fuel
and accelerate their own growth.79 Cancer’s hunger for cholesterol is
such that pharmaceutical companies have considered using LDL cholesterol
as a Trojan horse to deliver antitumor drugs to cancer cells.80</p>
<p>Though data have been mixed, the largest study on cholesterol and
cancer to date—including more than a million participants—found a 17
percent increased risk in women who had total cholesterol levels over
240 compared with women whose cholesterol was under 160.81 If lowering
cholesterol may help lower breast cancer risk, what about taking
cholesterol-lowering statin drugs?</p>
<p>Statins looked promising in petri-dish studies, but population
studies comparing breast cancer rates among statin users and nonusers
showed inconsistent results. Some suggested statins decreased breast
cancer risk, while others showed increased risk. Nearly all these
studies were relatively short term, however. Most considered five years
to be long-term statin use, but breast cancer can take decades to
develop.82</p>
<p>The first major study on the breast cancer risk of statin use for ten
years or longer was published in 2013. It found that women who had been
taking statins for a decade or more had twice the risk of both common
types of infiltrating breast cancer: invasive ductal carcinoma and
invasive lobular carcinoma.83 The cholesterol drugs doubled the risk. If
confirmed, the public health implications of these findings are immense:
Approximately one in four women in the United States over the age of
forty-five may be taking these drugs.84</p>
<p>The number-one killer of women is heart disease, not breast cancer,
so women still need to bring down their cholesterol. You can likely
achieve this without drugs by eating a healthy enough plant-based diet.
And certain plant foods may be particularly protective.</p>
<p>PREVENTING (AND TREATING) BREAST CANCER BY EATING PLANTS</p>
<p>Not long ago, I received a very moving note from Bettina, a woman who
had been following my work on NutritionFacts.org. Bettina had been
diagnosed with stage two “triple-negative” breast cancer—the hardest
type to treat. She underwent eight months of treatment, including
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. A breast cancer diagnosis is
stressful enough, but the anxiety and depression can be compounded by
this type of rigorous cancer regimen.</p>
<p>Bettina, however, used the experience to make positive changes in her
life. After watching a number of my videos, she started to eat
healthier. She followed many of the recommendations you’ll find in this
chapter for helping to prevent a recurrence of cancer, such as eating
more broccoli and flaxseeds. The good news: Bettina has been cancer-free
for more than three years now.</p>
<p>Given all the studies I read through, it’s easy for me to forget that
the statistics refer to people’s lives. Stories like Bettina’s help me
put faces to all the dry facts and figures. When real people make real
changes, they can see real results.</p>
<p>Sadly, even after a breast cancer diagnosis, most women may not make
the dietary changes that could help them most, such as consuming less
meat and more fruits and vegetables.85 Maybe they don’t realize (or
their doctors never told them) that a healthier lifestyle may improve
their survival chances. For example, a study of nearly 1,500 women found
that remarkably simple behavior changes—such as eating just five or more
servings of fruits and veggies per day along with walking for thirty
minutes six days a week—were associated with a significant survival
advantage. Those who followed these recommendations appeared to have
nearly half the risk of dying from their cancer in the two years
following diagnosis.86</p>
<p>While stories like Bettina’s can help make the statistics more
inspiring, it all has to come back to the science. Over time, what to
eat and feed our families are life-or-death decisions. How else can we
decide but based on the best available balance of evidence?</p>
<p>Fiber</p>
<p>Inadequate fiber consumption may also be a risk factor for breast
cancer. Researchers at Yale University and elsewhere found that
premenopausal women who ate more than about six grams of soluble fiber a
day (the equivalent of about a single cup of black beans) had 62 percent
lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who consumed less than
around four grams a day. Fiber’s benefits appeared even more pronounced
for estrogen-receptor-negative breast tumors, which are harder to treat:
Premenopausal women on a higher fiber diet had 85 percent lower odds of
that type of breast cancer.87</p>
<p>How did the researchers arrive at these figures? The Yale study was
what’s called a case-control study. Scientists compared the past diets
of women who had breast cancer (the cases) to the past diets of similar
women who did not have breast cancer (the controls) to try to tease out
if there is something distinctive about the eating habits of women who
developed the disease. The researchers found that certain women with
breast cancer reported eating significantly less soluble fiber on
average than the cancer-free women. Hence, soluble fiber may be
protective.</p>
<p>The women in the study weren’t getting their fiber from supplements,
though; they were getting it from food. But this could mean that eating
more fiber is merely evidence that the cancer-free women are eating more
plant foods, the only place fiber is found naturally. Therefore, fiber
itself might not be the active ingredient. Maybe there’s something else
protective in plant foods. “On the other hand,” noted the researchers,
“an increased consumption of fiber from foods of plant origin … may
reflect a reduced consumption of foods of animal origin.…”88 In other
words, maybe it’s not what they were eating more of but what they were
eating less of. The reason high fiber intake is associated with less
breast cancer may be because of more beans—or less bologna.</p>
<p>Either way, an analysis of a dozen other breast cancer case-control
studies reported similar findings, with lower breast cancer risk
associated with indicators of fruit and vegetable intake, such as
vitamin C intake, and higher breast cancer risk associated with higher
saturated-fat intake (an indicator of meat, dairy, and processed food
intake). And according to these studies, the more whole plant foods you
eat, the better it is for your health: Every twenty grams of fiber
intake per day was associated with a 15 percent lower risk of breast
cancer.89</p>
<p>One problem with case-control studies, though, is that they rely on
people’s memory of what they’ve been eating, potentially introducing
what’s known as “recall bias.” For example, if people with cancer are
more likely to selectively remember more of the unhealthy things they
ate, this skewed recall could artificially inflate the correlation
between eating certain foods and cancer. Prospective cohort studies
avoid this problem by following a group (cohort) of healthy women and
their diets forward (prospectively) in time to see who gets cancer and
who doesn’t. A compilation of ten such prospective cohort studies on
breast cancer and fiber intake came up with similar results to the dozen
case-control studies mentioned above, a 14 percent lower risk of breast
cancer for every twenty grams of fiber intake per day.90 The
relationship between more fiber and less breast cancer may not be a
straight line, though. Breast cancer risk may not significantly fall
until at least twenty-five grams of fiber a day is reached.91</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the average American woman appears to eat less than
fifteen grams of fiber per day—only about half the minimum daily
recommendation.92 Even the average vegetarian in the United States may
only get about twenty grams daily.93 Healthier vegetarians, though, may
average thirty-seven grams a day, and vegans forty-six grams daily.94
Meanwhile, the whole-food, plant-based diets used therapeutically to
reverse chronic disease contain upward of sixty grams of fiber.95</p>
<hr />
<p>Peeling Back Breast Cancer</p>
<p>“Does an Apple a Day Keep the Oncologist Away?” This was the title of
a study published in the Annals of Oncology that set out to determine if
eating an apple (or more) a day was associated with lower cancer risk.
The results: Compared with people who average less than one apple a day,
daily apple eaters had 24 percent lower odds of breast cancer, as well
as significantly lower risks for ovarian cancer, laryngeal cancer, and
colorectal cancer. The protective associations persisted even after
considering these subjects’ intake of vegetables and other fruits,
suggesting daily apple consumption was more than just an indicator of
eating a healthier diet.96</p>
<p>The cancer protection apples appear to offer is assumed to arise from
their antioxidant properties. Apple antioxidants are concentrated in the
peel, which makes sense: The skin is the fruit’s first line of defense
against the outside world. Expose the inner flesh, and it starts to
brown (oxidize) within moments. The antioxidant power of the peel may be
between two times (Golden Delicious) to six times (Idared) greater than
the pulp.97</p>
<p>Beyond protecting against the initial free-radical hit to your DNA,
apple extract has been shown to suppress the growth of both
estrogen-receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells in a petri
dish.98 When researchers at my alma mater, Cornell University,
separately dripped extracts of peel and flesh from the same apples on
cancer cells, the peel stopped cancer growth ten times more
effectively.99</p>
<p>Researchers found something in the peels of organic apples
(presumably present in conventional ones as well) that appears to
reactivate a tumor-suppressor gene called maspin (an acronym for mammary
serine protease inhibitor). Maspin is one of the tools your body appears
to use to keep breast cancer at bay. Breast cancer cells find a way to
turn off this gene, but apple peels appear to be able to turn it back
on. The researchers concluded that “apple peels should not be discarded
from the diet.”100</p>
<hr />
<p>Preventing Breast Cancer by Any Greens Necessary</p>
<p>Earlier, I discussed the 2007 study of Long Island women that linked
breast cancer risk to the heterocyclic amines formed in meat. Older
women consuming the most grilled, barbecued, or smoked meat over their
lifetimes were found to have 47 percent increased odds of breast cancer.
Those with high meat intake who also had low fruit and vegetable intake
had 74 percent higher odds.101</p>
<p>Low fruit and vegetable intake may just be a sign of unhealthy habits
overall, but increasing evidence suggests that there may be something in
produce that is actively protective against breast cancer. For example,
cruciferous vegetables like broccoli boost the activity of detoxifying
enzymes in your liver. Research has shown that if you feed people
broccoli and brussels sprouts, they clear caffeine more quickly—meaning
that if you eat a lot of cruciferous vegetables, you’d have to drink
more coffee to get the same buzz because your liver (the body’s
purifier) has become so revved up.102 Might this process work for those
cooked meat carcinogens as well?</p>
<p>To find out, researchers fed a group of nonsmokers pan-fried meat.
They then measured the levels of heterocyclic amines circulating in
their bodies by sampling their urine. For two weeks, the study subjects
added about three cups of broccoli and brussels sprouts to their daily
diets and then ate the same meat meal. Though they consumed the same
quantity of carcinogens, significantly less came out in their urine,
consistent with the subjects’ broccoli-boosted liver detox
ability.103</p>
<p>What happened next was unexpected. The subjects stopped eating their
veggies and, two weeks later, tried eating the meat meal again.
Presumably, their ability to detox carcinogens would by then have
reverted back down to baseline. But instead, the subjects’ liver
function remained enhanced even weeks later.104 This finding suggests
that not only might a heaping side of broccoli with your steak decrease
carcinogen exposure but also that eating your veggies days or even weeks
before the big barbecue may help shore up your defenses. Choosing the
veggie burger may be the safest choice, though, as it may have no
heterocyclic amines to detoxify.105</p>
<p>So are women who eat a lot of green vegetables less likely to get
breast cancer? A study of fifty thousand African American women (a sadly
neglected demographic in medical research, but a population group who
tends to regularly eat more greens) found that those who ate two or more
servings of vegetables a day had a significantly decreased risk of a
kind of breast cancer that’s hard to treat, estrogen- and
progesterone-receptor-negative.106 Broccoli appeared especially
protective among premenopausal women, but collard green consumption was
associated with less breast cancer risk at all ages.107</p>
<p>Breast Cancer Stem Cells</p>
<p>What if you’re already fighting breast cancer or are in remission?
Green vegetables may still be protective. Over the past decade,
scientists have been developing a new theory of cancer biology based on
the role of stem cells. Stem cells are essentially the body’s raw
materials—the “parents” from which all other cells with specialized
functions are generated. As a result, stem cells are a critical
component of the body’s repair system, including regrowing skin, bone,
and muscle. Breast tissue naturally has many stem cells in reserve,
which are used during pregnancy to create new milk glands.108 However,
as miraculous as stem cells are, their immortality can also work against
us. Instead of rebuilding organs, if they turn cancerous, they can build
tumors.109</p>
<p>Cancerous stem cells may be why breast cancer can return, even up to
twenty-five years after being fought off successfully the first time.110
When people are told that they are cancer-free, it may mean their tumors
are gone, but if their stem cells are cancerous, the tumors still might
reappear many years later. Sadly, someone who has been cancer-free for
ten years might consider herself cured but actually may just be in
remission. Smoldering cancerous stem cells may be just waiting to
reignite.</p>
<p>The current battery of sophisticated chemo drugs and radiation
regimens is based on animal models. Success of a given treatment is
often measured by its ability to shrink tumors in rodents—but rats in
laboratories only live for about two or three years in any case. Doctors
may be shrinking tumors, but mutated stem cells may still be lurking,
able to slowly rebuild new tumors over the ensuing years.111</p>
<p>What we need to do is strike at the root of cancer. We need to devise
treatments aimed not just at reducing tumor bulk but at targeting what
has been called the “beating heart of the tumor”:112 cancer stem
cells.</p>
<p>That’s where broccoli may come in.</p>
<p>Sulforaphane, a dietary component of cruciferous vegetables like
broccoli, has been shown to suppress the ability of breast cancer stem
cells to form tumors.113 This means that if you’re currently in
remission, eating lots of broccoli could theoretically help keep your
cancer from returning. (I say theoretically because those results were
from a petri dish.)</p>
<p>To be useful as a cancer fighter, sulforaphane would have to first be
absorbed into your bloodstream when you eat broccoli. Then it would have
to build up to the same concentration in breast tissue found to counter
cancer stem cells in the lab. Is that possible? An innovative group at
Johns Hopkins University sought to find out. The researchers asked women
scheduled for breast reduction surgery to drink broccoli-sprout juice an
hour before their procedure. Sure enough, after dissecting their breast
tissue postsurgery, the researchers found evidence of significant
sulforaphane buildup.114 In other words, we now know that the
cancer-fighting nutrients in broccoli do find their way to the right
place when we swallow them.</p>
<p>To reach the concentration of sulforaphane in the breast found to
suppress breast cancer stem cells, however, you would have to eat at
least a quarter-cup of broccoli sprouts a day.115 You can buy broccoli
sprouts in the produce aisle, but they are cheap and easy to grow at
home. They have a bit of a radishy bite to them, so I like to mix them
into a salad to dilute their intensity.</p>
<p>There have yet to be randomized clinical trials to see if breast
cancer survivors who eat broccoli live longer than those who don’t, but
with no downside and only positive side effects, eating broccoli and
other cruciferous vegetables is something I would recommend for
everyone.</p>
<p>Flaxseeds</p>
<p>Flaxseeds are one of the first items ever considered to be health
foods, treasured for their purported healing properties since at least
the times of ancient Greece, when the renowned physician Hippocrates
wrote about using them to treat patients.116</p>
<p>Better known as one of the richest plant sources of essential omega-3
fatty acids, flaxseeds are really set apart by their lignan content.
Though lignans are found throughout the plant kingdom, flaxseeds have
around one hundred times more lignans than other foods.117 What are
lignans?</p>
<p>Lignans are phytoestrogens that can dampen the effects of the body’s
own estrogen. This is why flaxseeds are considered a first-line medical
therapy for menstrual breast pain.118 In terms of breast cancer risk,
eating about a daily tablespoonful of ground flaxseeds can extend a
woman’s menstrual cycle by about a day.119 This means she’ll have fewer
periods over the course of a lifetime and, therefore, presumably less
estrogen exposure and reduced breast cancer risk.120 Just as broccoli
doesn’t technically contain sulforaphane (only the precursors that turn
into sulforaphane when chewed—see here), flaxseeds don’t contain
lignans, only lignan precursors, which need to be activated. This task
is performed by the good bacteria in your gut.</p>
<p>The gut bacteria’s role may help explain why women with frequent
urinary tract infections may be at a higher risk of breast cancer: Every
course of antibiotics you take can kill bacteria indiscriminately,
meaning it may stymie the ability of the good bacteria in your gut to
take full advantage of the lignans in your diet.121 (Yet another reason
you should take antibiotics only when necessary.)</p>
<p>Lignan intake is associated with significantly reduced breast cancer
risk in postmenopausal women.122 This effect is presumed to be due to
lignans’ further estrogen-dampening effects. But since lignans are found
in healthy foods like berries, whole grains, and dark, leafy greens,
could they just be an indicator of a healthy diet?</p>
<p>In a petri dish, lignans do directly suppress the proliferation of
breast cancer cells.123 But the strongest evidence to date that there
really is something special about this class of phytonutrients comes
from interventional trials, starting with a 2010 study funded by the
National Cancer Institute. Researchers took about forty-five women at
high risk of breast cancer—meaning they had suspicious breast biopsies
or had previously suffered from breast cancer—and gave them the
equivalent of about two teaspoons of ground flaxseeds every day. Needle
biopsies of breast tissue were taken before and after the yearlong
study. The results: On average, the women had fewer precancerous changes
in their breasts after the year of flax lignans than before they
started. Eighty percent (thirty-six of forty-five) had a drop in their
levels of Ki-67, a biomarker (indicator) of increased cell
proliferation. This finding suggests that sprinkling a few spoonfuls of
ground flaxseeds on your oatmeal or whatever you’re eating throughout
the day may reduce the risk of breast cancer.124</p>
<p>What about women who already have breast cancer? Breast cancer
survivors who have higher levels of lignans in their bloodstreams125,126
and diets127 appear to survive significantly longer. This outcome may be
due to the fact that women who eat flaxseeds may also see a rise in the
levels of endostatin in their breasts.128 (Endostatin is a protein
produced by your body to help starve tumors of their blood supply.)</p>
<p>The evidence from studies like these appeared so compelling that
scientists performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
clinical trial of flaxseeds for breast cancer patients—one of the few
times a food has ever been so rigorously put to the test. Researchers
located women with breast cancer scheduled for surgery and divided them
randomly into two groups: Every day, group one ate a muffin containing
flaxseed, while group two ate a muffin that looked and tasted the same,
but had no flaxseed in it. Biopsies of the tumors in the flax and
no-flax groups were taken at the beginning of the study and then
compared with the pathology of the tumor removed during surgery about
five weeks later.</p>
<p>Was there any difference? Compared with the women who ate the placebo
muffins, women consuming the muffins with flaxseed, on average,
witnessed their tumor-cell proliferation decrease, cancer-cell death
rates increase, and their c-erB2 scores go down. C-erB2 is a marker of
cancer aggressiveness; the higher your score, the higher the potential
for breast cancer to metastasize and spread throughout the body. In
other words, the flaxseeds appeared to make the subjects’ cancer less
aggressive. The researchers concluded, “Dietary flaxseed has the
potential to reduce tumor growth in patients with breast cancer.…
[F]laxseed, which is inexpensive and readily available, may be a
potential dietary alternative or adjunct to currently used breast cancer
drugs.”129</p>
<p>Soy and Breast Cancer</p>
<p>Soybeans naturally contain another class of phytoestrogens called
isoflavones. People hear the word “estrogen” in the word
“phytoestrogens” and assume that means soy has estrogen-like effects.
Not necessarily. Phytoestrogens dock into the same receptors as your own
estrogen but have a weaker effect, so they can act to block the effects
of your more powerful animal estrogen.</p>
<p>There are two types of estrogen receptors in the body, alpha and
beta. Your own estrogen prefers alpha receptors, while plant estrogens
(phytoestrogens) have an affinity for the beta receptors.130 The effects
of soy phytoestrogens on different tissues therefore depend on the ratio
of alpha to beta receptors.131</p>
<p>Estrogen has positive effects in some tissues and potentially
negative effects in others. For example, high levels of estrogen can be
good for the bones but can increase the likelihood of developing breast
cancer. Ideally, you’d like what’s called a “selective estrogen receptor
modulator” in your body that would have proestrogenic effects in some
tissues and antiestrogenic effects in others.</p>
<p>Well, that’s what soy phytoestrogens appear to be.132 Soy seems to
lower breast cancer risk,133 an antiestrogenic effect, but can also help
reduce menopausal hot-flash symptoms,134 a proestrogenic effect. So, by
eating soy, you may be able to enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>What about soy for women with breast cancer? There have been five
studies on breast cancer survivors and soy consumption. Overall,
researchers have found that women diagnosed with breast cancer who ate
the most soy lived significantly longer and had a significantly lower
risk of breast cancer recurrence than those who ate less.135 The
quantity of phytoestrogens found in just a single cup of soy milk136 may
reduce the risk of breast cancer returning by 25 percent.137 The
improvement in survival for those eating more soy foods was found both
in women whose tumors were responsive to estrogen
(estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer) and those whose tumors were
not (estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer). This also held true for
both young women and older women.138 In one study, for example, 90
percent of the breast cancer patients who ate the most soy
phytoestrogens after diagnosis were still alive five years later, while
half of those who ate little to no soy were dead.139</p>
<p>One way soy may decrease cancer risk and improve survival is by
helping to reactivate BRCA genes.140 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are so-called
caretaker genes, cancer-suppressing genes responsible for DNA repair.
Mutations in this gene can cause a rare form of hereditary breast
cancer. As has been well publicized, Angelina Jolie decided to undergo a
preventive double mastectomy. A National Breast Cancer Coalition survey
found that the majority of women believe that most breast cancers occur
among women with a family history or a genetic predisposition to the
disease.141 The reality is that as few as 2.5 percent of breast cancer
cases are attributable to breast cancer running in the family.142</p>
<p>If the vast majority of breast cancer patients have fully functional
BRCA genes, meaning that their DNA-repair mechanisms are intact, how did
their breast cancer form, grow, and spread? Breast tumors appear able to
suppress the expression of the gene through a process called
methylation. While the gene itself is operational, the cancer has
effectively turned it off or at least turned down its expression,
potentially aiding the metastatic spread of a tumor.143 That’s where soy
may come in.</p>
<p>The isoflavones in soy appear to help turn BRCA protection back on,
removing the methyl straitjacket the tumor tried to place on it.144 The
dose breast cancer researchers used to achieve this result in vitro was
pretty hefty, though—the equivalent to eating about a cup of
soybeans.</p>
<p>Soy may also help women with variations of other breast cancer
susceptibility genes known as MDM2 and CYP1B1. Women at increased
genetic risk of breast cancer may therefore especially benefit from high
soy intake.145 The bottom line is that no matter which genes you
inherit, changes in your diet may be able to affect DNA expression at a
genetic level, potentially boosting your ability to fight disease.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why Do Women in Asia Have Less Breast Cancer?</p>
<p>Though breast cancer is the most common cancer specific to women
globally, Asian women are up to five times less likely to develop breast
cancer than North American women.146 Why?</p>
<p>One possibility is their intake of green tea, a common staple in many
Asian diets. Green tea has been associated with about a 30 percent
reduction in breast cancer risk.147 Another strong possibility is a
relatively high intake of soy, which, if consumed consistently during
childhood, may cut the risk of breast cancer later in life by half. If
women consume soy primarily as an adult, though, their risk reduction
may only be closer to 25 percent.148</p>
<p>While intake of green tea and soy might account for a twofold
reduction in Asian women’s breast cancer risk, it doesn’t fully account
for the disparity between Eastern and Western breast cancer rates.</p>
<p>Asian populations also eat more mushrooms.149 As noted in the box on
red wine here, white mushrooms have also been shown to block the
estrogen synthase enzyme, at least in a petri dish. So researchers
decided to investigate if there was a link between mushroom intake and
breast cancer. They compared the mushroom consumption of one thousand
breast cancer patients to one thousand healthy subjects of similar age,
weight, and smoking and exercise status. The women whose mushroom
consumption averaged just about one-half a mushroom or more per day had
64 percent lower odds of breast cancer compared with women who didn’t
eat mushrooms at all. Eating mushrooms and sipping at least half a tea
bag’s worth of green tea each day was associated with nearly 90 percent
lower breast cancer odds.150</p>
<hr />
<p>Oncologists, doctors who treat cancer, can take pride in the strides
they’ve made. Thanks to improvements in cancer treatment, cancer
patients are living longer and healthier as has been celebrated in
oncology journal editorials with such titles as “Cancer Survivors, 10
Million Strong and Growing!” Yes, more than 10 million cancer patients
are still alive today, with “perhaps as many as 1 million new
individuals in the United States joining those ranks each year.”151 That
is an accomplishment, but wouldn’t it be even better to prevent those
million cases in the first place?</p>
<p>In medicine, a cancer diagnosis is considered a “teachable moment”
when we can motivate a patient to improve his or her lifestyle.152 By
then, though, it may already be too late.</p>
