<h4 id="chapter-13-how-not-to-die-from-prostate-cancer">CHAPTER 13 How
Not to Die from Prostate Cancer</h4>
<p>When Tony, a regular reader of NutritionFacts.org, heard that I was
writing this book, he asked me to share his story with you in the hopes
of helping other men avoid what happened to him. A happily married
father, engineer, and self-described fitness nut, he always tried to
make good choices out of respect for his body and was lucky to have
descended from long-lived, healthy ancestors. Tony was a runner who had
always been at a healthy weight. He stayed away from tobacco, alcohol,
and drugs. In the 1980s, based on health recommendations from the USDA,
he convinced his family to switch from whole milk to skim milk and from
beef to fish and chicken—lots and lots of chicken.</p>
<p>Tony was the kind of patient doctors love to take care of—the type
who says, “What else can I do to be at my very best?” So no one was more
surprised than Tony when, in his early fifties, he was diagnosed with an
aggressive prostate cancer. He sought care at a world-renowned medical
center and underwent a radical prostatectomy, which successfully removed
his cancer but left him with the daily challenge of dealing with the
consequences of that surgery—namely, urinary leakage and erectile
dysfunction.</p>
<p>He says he wishes he’d known about the conflicts of interest within
the USDA (which I elaborated in chapter 5) that have affected the
federal agency’s ability to make recommendations in the best interests
of the public independent of those of the food industry.</p>
<p>Eventually, Tony discovered the body of research you will be reading
about in this chapter, and, being a scientist, he immediately understood
the evidence that a healthy diet can improve male health. He has eaten a
plant-based diet for the last several years, takes flaxseed every day,
and has had no recurrence of cancer. As I will discuss, the same diet
that may prevent prostate cancer has also been shown to potentially slow
it down and even reverse its progression among those already diagnosed.
So it is Tony’s (and my) wish that this chapter will help you see the
importance of healthy eating for a healthy prostate.</p>
<p>The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and
base of the penis, just in front of the rectum. It surrounds the
urethra, the outlet from the bladder, and secretes the fluid portion of
semen. Just as glandular tissue in the breast can become cancerous, so
can glandular tissue in the prostate.</p>
<p>Autopsy studies show that about half of men over the age of eighty
have prostate cancer.1 Most men die with prostate cancer without ever
knowing they had it. That’s the problem with the emphasis on
screenings—many prostate cancers that are detected may never have led to
harm even if they’d gone undiscovered.2 Unfortunately, not all men are
so lucky. Nearly twenty-eight thousand die each year from prostate
cancer.3</p>
<p>Milk and Prostate Cancer</p>
<p>Since the U.S. National Dairy Board was first created by the Dairy
and Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983, it has spent more than billion on
advertising. By now, we’re all familiar with its various slogans, such
as “Milk is a natural.” But is it? Think about it. Humans are the only
species who drink milk after weaning. It also does seem a bit unnatural
to drink the milk of another species.</p>
<p>What about “Milk: It Does a Body Good”? All foods of animal origin
contain sex steroid hormones, such as estrogen, but today’s genetically
“improved” dairy cows are milked throughout their pregnancies when their
reproductive hormones are particularly high.4 These hormones naturally
found even in organic cow’s milk may play a role in the various
associations identified between milk and other dairy products and
hormone-related conditions, including acne,5 diminished male
reproductive potential,6 and premature puberty.7 The hormone content in
milk may explain why women who drink it appear to have five times the
rate of twin births compared with women who do not drink milk.8 When it
comes to cancer, though, the greater concern may have to do with growth
hormones.9</p>
<p>Mother Nature designed cow’s milk to put a few hundred pounds on a
baby calf within a few months. A lifetime of human exposure to these
growth factors in milk may help explain the connections found between
dairy consumption and certain cancers.10 Leading Harvard University
nutrition experts have expressed concern that the hormones in dairy
products and other growth factors could stimulate the growth of
hormone-sensitive tumors.11 Experimental evidence suggests that dairy
could also promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated
cells into invasive cancers.12</p>
<p>Concerns about milk and other dairy products first arose from
population-scale data, such as the twenty-five-fold increase in prostate
cancer in Japanese men since World War II, which coincided with a
sevenfold increase in egg consumption, a ninefold increase in meat
consumption, and a twentyfold increase in dairy consumption.13 Though
the rest of their diets remained comparatively stable and similar trends
have been noted in other countries,14 there were myriad changes in
Japanese society beyond eating more animal products that could have
contributed to these rising cancer rates. So scientists took a closer
look.</p>
<p>To control for as many variables as possible, researchers devised an
experiment in which they dripped milk on human prostate cancer cells in
a petri dish. The researchers chose organic cow’s milk to exclude any
effect of added hormones, such as the bovine growth hormone, which is
commonly injected into conventionally raised cows so they produce more
milk.15 The researchers found that cow’s milk stimulated the growth of
human prostate cancer cells in each of fourteen separate experiments,
producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of more than 30
percent. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of the cancer
cells by more than 30 percent.16</p>
<p>What happens in a petri dish, though, doesn’t necessarily happen in
people. Nevertheless, a compilation of case-control studies did conclude
that cow’s milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer,17 and
the same outcome was found for cohort studies.18 A 2015 meta-analysis
found that high intakes of dairy products—milk, low-fat milk, and
cheese, but not nondairy sources of calcium—appear to increase total
prostate cancer risk.19</p>
<p>But, you may be wondering, if you don’t drink milk, what will happen
to your bones? Doesn’t milk help prevent osteoporosis? It turns out that
the promised benefit may be just another empty marketing ploy. A
meta-analysis of cow’s milk intake and hip fracture studies shows no
significant protection.20 Even if you were to start drinking milk during
adolescence in an attempt to bolster peak bone mass, it probably
wouldn’t reduce your chances of fracture later in life.21 One recent set
of studies involving one hundred thousand men and women followed for up
to two decades even suggested milk may increase bone and hip fracture
rates.22</p>
<p>Some babies are born with a rare birth defect called galactosemia, in
which they lack the enzymes needed to detoxify galactose, a type of
sugar found in milk. This means they end up with elevated levels of
galactose in their blood, which can cause bone loss.23 A group of
Swedish researchers figured that even among normal people who can
detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for their bones to be drinking
all that galactose in milk every day.24 And galactose may not just hurt
bones. Scientists actually use galactose to induce premature aging in
lab animals. When researchers slip lab animals some galactose, the
“life-shortened animals showed neurodegeneration, mental retardation and
cognitive dysfunction … diminished immune responses and reduction of
reproductive ability.”25 And it doesn’t take much, just the human
equivalent of one to two glasses worth of milk a day.26</p>
<p>However, since humans aren’t rodents, researchers investigated the
connection between milk intake and mortality, as well as fracture risk
in large populations of milk drinkers.27 In addition to significantly
more bone and hip fractures, researchers found higher rates of premature
death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer for each daily
glass of milk women drank. Three glasses a day was associated with
nearly twice the risk of dying early.28 Men with higher milk consumption
also had a higher rate of death, although they didn’t have higher
fracture rates.29</p>
<p>Overall, the study showed a dose-dependent higher rate of mortality
(in both men and women) and fracture (in women), but the opposite was
found for other dairy products, such as soured milk and yogurt, which
would go along with the galactose theory, because the bacteria in these
foods can ferment away some of the lactose.30</p>
<p>The medical journal editorial accompanying the published study
emphasized that, given the rise in milk consumption around the world,
the “role of milk in mortality needs to be established definitively
now.”31</p>
<p>Eggs, Choline, and Cancer</p>
<p>More than two million men are currently living with prostate cancer,
but living with prostate cancer is better than dying from it. If the
cancer is caught while still localized within the prostate, the chances
of it killing you within the next five years are practically nil.
However, if the cancer spreads far enough, your chances of surviving
five years may be as low as one in three.32 For this reason, scientists
have been desperate to identify factors involved in the spread of
prostate cancer once it has emerged.</p>
<p>Hoping to identify possible culprits, Harvard University researchers
recruited more than one thousand men with early-stage prostate cancer
and followed them for several years. Compared with men who rarely ate
eggs, men who ate even less than a single egg a day appeared to have
twice the risk of prostate cancer progression, such as metastasizing
into the bones. The only thing potentially worse for prostate cancer
than eggs was poultry: Men with more aggressive cancer who regularly ate
chicken and turkey had up to four times the risk of prostate cancer
progression.33</p>
<p>The researchers suggested that the link between consuming poultry and
advancing cancer may be due to cooked-meat carcinogens (such as
heterocyclic amines as discussed in chapter 11). For unknown reasons,
these carcinogens build up more in the muscles of chickens and turkeys
than in those of other animals.34</p>
<p>But what cancer-promoting substance is there in eggs? How could
eating less than an egg a day double the risk of cancer invasion? The
answer may be choline, a compound found concentrated in eggs.35</p>
<p>Higher levels of choline in the blood have been associated with
increased risk of developing prostate cancer in the first place.36 This
may explain the link between eggs and cancer progression.37 But what
about cancer mortality? In a paper entitled “Choline Intake and Risk of
Lethal Prostate Cancer,” the same Harvard team found that men who
consumed the most choline from food also had an increased risk of cancer
death.38 Men who consume two and a half or more eggs per week—basically
an egg every three days—may have an 81 percent increased risk of dying
from prostate cancer.39 The choline in eggs, like the carnitine in red
meat, is converted into a toxin called trimethylamine40 by bacteria that
exist in the guts of those who eat meat.41 And trimethylamine, once
oxidized in the liver, appears to increase the risk of heart attack,
stroke, and premature death.42</p>
<p>Ironically, the presence of choline in eggs is something the egg
industry boasts about even though most Americans get more than enough
choline.43 Mind you, the industry executives are aware of the cancer
connection. Through the Freedom of Information Act, I was able to get my
hands on an e-mail from the executive director of the Egg Nutrition
Board directed to another egg industry executive that discussed the
Harvard study suggesting that choline is a culprit in promoting cancer
progression. “Certainly worth keeping in mind,” he wrote, “as we
continue to promote choline as another good reason to consume
eggs.”44</p>
<p>Diet Versus Exercise</p>
<p>Nathan Pritikin, the man who helped launch a lifestyle medicine
revolution—and saved my grandma’s life—wasn’t a nutritionist or a
dietitian. He wasn’t even a doctor. He was an engineer. When he was
diagnosed with heart disease in his forties, Pritikin reviewed all the
available research himself and decided to try eating the type of diet
followed by populations in places like rural Africa, where heart disease
was rare. He figured that if he stopped eating a heart-disease-promoting
diet, he could stop the advancement of the disease. What he found was
even more remarkable. He didn’t just stop the disease from getting
worse, he reversed his condition.45 He then went on to help thousands of
others do the same.</p>
<p>After vanquishing our number-one killer, heart disease, Dr. Dean
Ornish and Pritikin Research Foundation researchers moved on to killer
number two: cancer. They developed an elegant series of experiments,
placing people on different diets and then dripping their blood on human
cancer cells growing in a petri dish. Whose bloodstream would be better
at suppressing cancer growth?</p>
<p>The research showed that the blood of people randomized to a
plant-based-diet group was dramatically less hospitable to cancer-cell
growth than the blood of people in the control group who continued to
eat their typical diet. The blood of those eating the standard American
diet does fight cancer—if it didn’t, many of us would be dead!—but the
blood of people eating plant-based diets was shown to fight cancer about
eight times better.46</p>
<p>The blood of men on the standard American diet slowed down the rate
of prostate cancer cell growth by 9 percent. Place men on a plant-based
diet for a year, though, and the blood circulating within their bodies
can suppress cancer cell growth by 70 percent—that’s nearly eight times
the stopping power compared to a meat-centered menu.47 Similar studies
have shown that women eating plant-based diets appear to strengthen
their bodies’ defenses against breast cancer in just fourteen days (as
detailed in chapter 11).48 It’s as if we’re a totally different person
inside after eating and living healthfully for just a couple of
weeks.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the strengthening of cancer defenses in all
these studies involved eating a plant-based diet and exercising. For
example, in the breast cancer study, the women were asked to walk thirty
to sixty minutes a day. How, then, do we know it was the diet that made
their blood more effective at suppressing cancer growth? To tease out
the effects of diet and exercise, a UCLA research team compared three
groups of men: a plant-based diet-and-exercise group, an exercise-only
group, and a control group of sedentary people eating standard
fare.49</p>
<p>The diet-and-exercise group had been following a plant-based diet for
fourteen years, along with participating in moderate exercise, such as a
daily walk. The exercise-only group eating the standard American diet,
on the other hand, had spent about fifteen years exercising strenuously
for an hour a day at the gym at least five times a week. The researchers
wanted to know if people who exercise hard enough for long enough
develop cancer-fighting abilities that rival that of strolling plant
eaters.50</p>
<p>To find out, blood from each of the three groups was dripped onto
human prostate cancer cells growing in a petri dish to see whose blood
kicked more cancer butt. The blood of the control group wasn’t
completely defenseless. Even if you’re a french fry–eating couch potato,
your blood may still be able to kill off 1–2 percent of cancer cells.
But the blood of those who exercised strenuously every weekday for
fifteen years killed 2,000 percent more cancer cells than the control
groups’. Fantastic results, but the blood of those in the plant-based
diet-and-exercise group wiped out an astounding 4,000 percent more
cancer cells than that of the first group. Clearly exercise alone had a
dramatic effect, but at the end of the day, thousands of hours in the
gym appeared to be no match for a plant-based diet.51</p>
<p>Prostate Cancer Reversal Through Diet?</p>
<p>If a healthy diet can turn your bloodstream into a cancer-fighting
machine, what about using it not just to prevent cancer but also to
treat it? Other leading killers, including heart disease, type 2
diabetes, and hypertension, can be prevented, arrested, and even
reversed, so why not cancer?</p>
<p>To test this question, Dr. Ornish and his colleagues recruited
ninety-three men with prostate cancer who had chosen not to undergo any
conventional treatment. Prostate cancer can be so slow growing and the
side effects of treatment so onerous that men diagnosed with it often
choose to be placed in a medical holding pattern called “watchful
waiting” or “expectant management.” Because the next step is often
chemotherapy, radiation, and/or radical surgery that may leave men
incontinent and impotent, doctors try to delay treatment as long as
possible. And since these patients aren’t actively doing anything to
treat the disease, they represent an ideal population in whom to
investigate the power of diet and lifestyle interventions.</p>
<p>The prostate cancer patients were randomized into two groups: a
control group that wasn’t given any diet or lifestyle advice beyond
whatever their personal doctors told them to do, and a healthy-living
group prescribed a strict plant-based diet centered around fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with other healthy lifestyle
changes, such as walking for thirty minutes, six days a week.52</p>
<p>Cancer progression was tracked using PSA levels, a marker of prostate
cancer growth inside the body. After a year, the control group’s PSA
levels increased by 6 percent. That’s what cancer tends to do: grow over
time. But among the healthy-living group, PSA levels decreased by 4
percent, suggesting an average shrinkage of their tumors.53 No surgery,
no chemotherapy, no radiation—just eating and living healthfully.</p>
<p>Biopsies taken before and after the diet and lifestyle intervention
showed that the expression of more than five hundred genes was affected.
This was one of the first demonstrations that changing what you eat and
how you live can affect you at a genetic level, in terms of which genes
are switched on and off.54 Within a year after the study ended, the
cancers in the patients in the control group grew so much that 10
percent of them were forced to undergo a radical prostatectomy,55 a
surgery that involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and
surrounding tissues. This treatment can lead not only to urinary
incontinence (urine leakage) and impotence but to alterations in
orgasmic function in approximately 80 percent of men undergoing the
procedure.56 In contrast, none in the plant-based diet and lifestyle
group ended up on the operating table.</p>
<p>How were the researchers able to convince a group of older men to
basically eat a vegan diet for a year? They evidently delivered prepared
meals to their homes.57 I guess the researchers figured men are so lazy
they’ll just eat whatever is put in front of them—and it worked!</p>
<p>Now, how about in the real world? Realizing that doctors apparently
can’t get most men with cancer to eat even a measly five servings of
fruits and veggies daily,58 a group of researchers at the University of
Massachusetts settled on just trying to change their A:V ratio, or the
ratio of animal to vegetable proteins in their diets.59 Maybe just a
reduction in meat and dairy and an increase in plant foods would be
enough to put cancer into remission?</p>
<p>To test this, the researchers randomized prostate cancer patients
into two groups, one group that attended classes on eating a more
plant-based diet and a conventional-care group that received no dietary
instruction. The healthy-eating advice group was able to drop their A:V
ratio down to about 1:1, getting half their protein from plant sources.
In contrast, the control group’s ratio stayed up around 3:1
animal-to-plant protein.60</p>
<p>Those on the half-vegan diet did appear to slow down the growth of
their cancer. Their average PSA doubling time—an estimate of how fast
their tumors may have been doubling in size—slowed from twenty-one
months to fifty-eight months.61 In other words, the cancer kept growing,
but even a part-time plant-based diet appeared to be able to
significantly slow down their tumors’ expansion. It is worth noting,
though, that Dr. Ornish and colleagues were able to demonstrate that a
full-time plant-based diet allowed for an apparent reversal in cancer
growth: The subjects’ PSA levels didn’t just rise more slowly, but they
trended downward. Thus, the ideal animal-to-plant protein ratio may be
closer to zero to one.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Worst A and the Best V</p>
<p>What if there’s just no way Grandpa’s going vegan, leaving you with
only half measures? What would be on the short list of foods for him to
avoid, or to include, in his diet?</p>
<p>Based on the Harvard University prostate cancer progression and
mortality data detailed above, eggs and poultry may be the worst
offenders: Patients may face twice the cancer progression risk from
eating less than a single egg per day and up to quadruple the risk from
eating less than a single serving of chicken or turkey daily.62</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were to add only one thing to your diet,
consider cruciferous vegetables. Less than a single serving a day of
broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, or kale may cut the
risk of cancer progression by more than half.63</p>
<p>Watching your animal-to-plant protein ratio might be useful for
cancer prevention in general. For example, the largest study ever
performed on diet and bladder cancer—comprising nearly five hundred
thousand people—found that an increase in animal protein consumption of
just 3 percent was associated with a 15 percent increased risk of
bladder cancer. On the other hand, an increase in plant protein intake
of only 2 percent was associated with a 23 percent decreased cancer
risk.64</p>
<hr />
<p>Flaxseed</p>
<p>Prostate cancer rates vary tremendously around the world. African
Americans, for example, may have an incidence of clinically apparent
prostate cancer that is some 30 times greater than that of Japanese men
and 120 times greater than that of Chinese men. This discrepancy has
been attributed in part to the higher amounts of animal protein and fat
in Western diets.65 Another factor, though, may be the soy common in
many Asian diets, which contains protective phytoestrogens called
isoflavones.66</p>
<p>As detailed in chapter 11, the other major class of phytoestrogens is
lignans, found throughout the plant kingdom but especially concentrated
in flaxseeds. Higher levels of lignans tend to be found in the prostate
fluids of populations of men with relatively low rates of prostate
cancer,67 and lignans have also been shown to slow the growth of
prostate cancer cells in a petri dish.68</p>
<p>Researchers decided to put lignans to the test by asking men with
prostate cancer scheduled for prostate-removal surgery the following
month to consume three tablespoons a day of flaxseed. After surgery,
their tumors were examined. Within just those few weeks, the flaxseed
consumption appeared to have lowered their cancer-cell proliferation
rates, while at the same time increasing their rate of cancer-cell
clearance.69</p>
<p>Even better, flaxseeds may also be able to prevent prostate cancer
from advancing to that stage in the first place. Prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a precancerous prostate lesion found
during a biopsy; it is analogous to ductal carcinoma in situ of the
breast. Those with PIN have a high risk for cancer to appear during
subsequent biopsies—25–79 percent.70 Because men are repeatedly biopsied
to monitor their condition, the procedures provide a perfect opportunity
to see if a dietary intervention can keep these lesions from progressing
to cancer.</p>
<p>After the first biopsies of their prostates came back PIN positive,
fifteen men were asked to eat three tablespoons of flaxseed a day for
the six months until their next biopsy. After that time, they showed a
significant drop in PSA levels and biopsy cell-proliferation rates,
suggesting that flaxseeds may indeed thwart the progression of prostate
cancer. Two of the men saw their PSA levels drop to normal and didn’t
even need a second biopsy.71</p>
<p>Bottom line: The evidence suggests that flaxseed is a safe, low-cost
source of nutrition and may reduce tumor-proliferation rates.72 Why not
give it a try? Just make sure to grind the flaxseeds first if you don’t
buy them preground—otherwise, the seeds may pass right through your body
undigested.</p>
<p>Enlarged Prostate</p>
<p>If a healthy diet can slow down the abnormal growth of prostate
cancer cells, can it also slow down the abnormal growth of normal
prostate cells? Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition
characterized by enlargement of the prostate gland. In the United
States, BPH affects millions of men73—as many as half of men by their
fifties and 80 percent of men by their eighties.74 Because the male
prostate surrounds the outlet from the bladder, it can obstruct the
normal flow of urine if it grows too large. This obstruction can cause a
weak or hesitant stream and inadequate emptying of the bladder,
requiring frequent trips to the bathroom. The stagnant urine retained in
the bladder can also become a breeding ground for infection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem only seems to get worse as the gland
continues to grow. Billions of dollars have been spent on drugs and
supplements, and millions of American men have undergone surgery for
BPH.75 Surgical procedures involve a variety of Roto-Rooter techniques
with innocent-sounding acronyms, such as TUMT, TUNA, and TURP. The Ts
stand for transurethral—meaning going up the penis with an instrument
called a resectoscope. TUMT stands for transurethral microwave
thermotherapy, in which doctors basically tunnel up the penis using an
antenna-like tool and burn out a shaft with microwaves.76 TUNA stands
for transurethral needle ablation; here, a column is burned out with a
pair of heated needles. And these are so-called minimally invasive
techniques!77 The gold standard procedure is the TURP, wherein surgeons
essentially use a loop of wire to core out the prostate. Side effects
include “postoperative discomfort.”78 Ya think?!</p>
<p>There has to be a better way.</p>
<p>BPH is so common that most doctors may assume that it’s just an
inevitable consequence of aging. But it wasn’t always so. In China in
the 1920s and 1930s, for example, a medical college in Beijing reported
that BPH affected not 80 percent of male patients but about eighty cases
total over fifteen years. Both the historic rarity of BPH and prostate
cancer in Japan and China have been attributed to the countries’
traditional plant-based diets.79</p>
<p>This idea was studied by the same Pritikin Foundation researchers who
pitted the blood of individuals before and after a plant-based diet
against the growth of prostate cancer cells. This time, they performed
the same experiment on the type of normal prostate cells that grow to
obstruct urine flow. Within just two weeks, those eating plant-based
diets saw their blood acquire the ability to suppress the abnormal
growth of noncancerous prostate cells too—and the effect didn’t seem to
dissipate with time. The blood of those eating plant-based diets over
the long term had the same beneficial effect for up to twenty-eight
years straight. So it appears that as long as we continue to eat
healthfully, prostate cell-growth rates will continue to go down and
stay down.80</p>
<p>Some plants may be particularly prostate friendly. Research has found
that flaxseeds can be used to treat BPH. Men given the equivalent of
about three tablespoons of flaxseeds a day experienced relief comparable
to that provided by commonly prescribed such drugs as Flomax or
Proscar81—without the drugs’ side effects, such as lightheadedness or
sexual dysfunction.</p>
<p>Is it possible to prevent BPH in the first place? Eating garlic and
onions has been associated with significantly lower risk of BPH.82 In
general, cooked vegetables may work better than raw ones, and
legumes—beans, chickpeas, split peas, and lentils—have also been
associated with lower risk.83 TVP, short for textured vegetable protein,
is a soybean product often used in pasta sauces and veggie chili. I
would recommend that type of TVP over the one used in urology, which
stands for transurethral vaporization of the prostate.84</p>
<p>IGF-1</p>
<p>Why do people who live to be one hundred or older seem to escape
cancer? As you age, your risk of developing and dying from cancer grows
every year—until you hit eighty-five or ninety, when, interestingly,
your cancer risk begins to drop.85 Indeed, if you don’t get cancer by a
certain age, you may never get it. What accounts for this relative
resistance to cancer among centenarians? It may have to do with a
cancer-promoting growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1).86</p>
<p>Each year, you are reborn. You create and destroy nearly your entire
body weight in new cells every year. Every day, about fifty billion of
your cells die, and about fifty billion new cells are born to keep you
in balance.87 Of course, sometimes you need to grow, as when you’re a
baby or during puberty. Your cells don’t become larger when you grow up;
they simply become more numerous. An adult may have around forty
trillion cells in his or her body, four times more than a child.</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten through puberty, you no longer need to produce
many more cells than you retire. You still need your cells to grow and
divide, of course—out with the old, in with the new. You just don’t want
to make more cells than you’re putting out to pasture. In adults, extra
cell growth can mean the development of tumors.</p>
<p>How does your body keep itself in balance? By sending chemical
signals called hormones to all the cells. A key signal is a growth
hormone called IGF-1. It sounds like a droid from Star Wars, but IGF-1
is actually a crucial factor in regulating cell growth. Levels go up
when you’re a kid in order to power your development, but when you reach
adulthood, IGF-1 levels diminish. It’s your body’s cue to stop producing
more cells than it kills off.</p>
<p>Should your levels of IGF-1 remain too high when you reach adulthood,
however, your cells will constantly receive a message to grow, divide,
and keep going and growing. Not surprisingly, the more IGF-1 you have in
your bloodstream, the higher your risk for developing cancers, such as
prostate cancer.88</p>
<p>There is a rare form of dwarfism called Laron syndrome that is caused
by the body’s inability to produce IGF-1. Affected individuals grow to
be only a few feet tall, but they also almost never get cancer.89 Laron
syndrome is a sort of cancer-proofing mutation, which led scientists to
wonder: What if you could get all the IGF-1 you needed as a child to
grow to a normal height but then down-regulate this hormone as adults
and thereby turn off excess growth signals? It turns out you can do just
that—not with surgery or medication but through simple dietary
choices.</p>
<p>The release of IGF-1 appears to be triggered by the consumption of
animal protein.90 This may explain why you can so dramatically bolster
the cancer-fighting power of your bloodstream within weeks of eating a
plant-based diet. Remember the experiments in which dripping the blood
from people eating healthy diets onto cancer cells wiped more of them
out? Well, if you add back to the cancer cells the amount of IGF-1 that
left the plant eaters’ systems, guess what happens? The
diet-and-exercise effect disappears. The cancer cell growth comes
surging back. This is how we suspect plant-based eating boosts our blood
defenses: By reducing animal protein intake, we reduce our levels of
IGF-1.91</p>
<p>After just eleven days of cutting back on animal protein, your IGF-1
levels can drop by 20 percent, and your levels of IGF-1 binding protein
can jump by 50 percent.92 One of the ways your body tries to protect
itself from cancer—that is, excessive growth—is by releasing a binding
protein into your bloodstream to tie up any excess IGF-1. Think of it as
the body’s emergency brake. Even if you’ve managed to down-regulate
production of new IGF-1 through diet, what about all that excess IGF-1
still circulating from the bacon and eggs you may have eaten two weeks
before? No problem: The liver releases a snatch squad of binding
proteins to help take it out of circulation.</p>
<p>How plant focused does a diet have to be to lower IGF-1 levels?
Animal protein stimulates IGF-1 production whether it’s the muscle
proteins in meat, the egg-white protein in eggs, or the milk proteins in
dairy. Vegetarians who include eggs and dairy in their diets don’t seem
to achieve a significant reduction in IGF-1. Only men93 and women94 who
limit their intake of all animal proteins appear able to significantly
drop their levels of the cancer-promoting hormone and raise their levels
of the protective binding proteins.</p>
<hr />
<p>Prostate cancer isn’t inevitable. I once gave a speech in Bellport,
New York, about preventing chronic disease through diet. Afterward, an
audience member named John was inspired to e-mail me and recount his
battle with prostate cancer. Diagnosed at age fifty-two, John had had
six needle core biopsies performed, and each showed his cancer to be
very aggressive. John’s doctors immediately recommended surgery to
remove his entire prostate.</p>
<p>Instead of going under the knife, John decided to switch to a
plant-based diet. Eight months later, he had another biopsy. His doctors
were astonished to see that only 10 percent of his cancer remained.
What’s more, his PSA tests have been completely normal ever since.</p>
<p>John was diagnosed in 1996. After changing his diet, his cancer went
away and has stayed away.</p>
<p>John may have just gotten lucky, though. I do not recommend that
people ignore their doctors’ advice. Whatever you and your medical team
decide together, healthy diet and lifestyle changes can presumably only
help. That’s the nice thing about lifestyle interventions—they can be
implemented in addition to whatever other treatment options are chosen.
In a research setting, that can complicate matters, as you don’t know
which action may be responsible for any improvement. But when facing a
cancer diagnosis, you may want to opt for all the help you can get.
Regardless of whether cancer patients elect for chemo, surgery, or
radiation, they can always improve their diets. A prostate-healthy diet
is a breast-healthy diet is a heart-healthy diet is a body-healthy
diet.</p>
