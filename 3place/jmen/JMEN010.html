<h4 id="chapter-7-how-not-to-die-from-high-blood-pressure">CHAPTER 7 How
Not to Die from High Blood Pressure</h4>
<p>The most comprehensive and systematic analysis of the causes of death
ever undertaken was published recently in the Lancet, one of the world’s
leading medical journals.1 Funded by the Bill andandandand Melinda Gates
Foundation, the Global Burden of Disease Study involved nearly five
hundred researchers from more than three hundred institutions in fifty
countries and examined nearly one hundred thousand data sources.2 The
results allow us to answer such questions as “How many lives could we
save if people around the world cut back on soda?” The best answer?
299,521.3 So soft drinks and their empty calories don’t just fail to
promote health—they actually seem to promote death. But apparently soda
isn’t nearly as deadly as bacon, bologna, ham, and hot dogs. Processed
meat is blamed for the deaths of more than eight hundred thousand people
every year. Worldwide, that’s four times more people than who die from
illicit drug use.4</p>
<p>The study also noted which foods, if added to the diet, might save
lives. Eating more whole grains could potentially save 1.7 million lives
a year. More vegetables? 1.8 million lives. How about nuts and seeds?
2.5 million lives. The researchers didn’t look at beans, but of the
foods they considered, which does the world need most? Fruit. Worldwide,
if humanity ate more fruit, we might save 4.9 million lives. That’s
nearly 5 million lives hanging in the balance, and their salvation isn’t
medication or a new vaccine—it may be just more fruit.5</p>
<p>The number-one risk factor for death in the world they identified is
high blood pressure.6 Also known as hypertension, high blood pressure
lays waste to nine million people worldwide every year.7 It kills so
many people because it contributes to deaths from a variety of causes,
including aneurysms, heart attacks, heart failure, kidney failure, and
stroke.</p>
<p>You’ve probably had your blood pressure taken at the doctor’s office.
The nurse reads off two numbers, say, for example, “115 over 75.” The
first number (“systolic”) represents the pressure in your arteries as
your blood pumps from the heart; the second number (“diastolic”) is the
pressure in your arteries while the heart is resting between beats. The
American Heart Association defines “normal” blood pressure as a systolic
pressure under 120 and a diastolic pressure under 80—or 120/80. Anything
above 140/90 is considered hypertensive. Values in between are
considered prehypertensive.8</p>
<p>Increased blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and can damage
the sensitive blood vessels in your eyes and kidneys, cause bleeding in
the brain, and even lead certain arteries to balloon and rupture. The
fact that hypertension can damage so many organ systems and increase the
risk of heart disease and stroke, two of our leading killers, explains
why it is the number-one killer risk factor worldwide.</p>
<p>In the United States, nearly seventy-eight million people have high
blood pressure—that’s about one in three American adults.9 As you age,
your blood pressure tends to get higher and higher. In fact, after age
sixty, 65 percent of Americans can expect to be diagnosed with the
condition.10 This has led many people, including doctors, to assume that
high blood pressure, like wrinkles or gray hair, is just an inevitable
consequence of getting older. However, we’ve known for nearly a century
that this isn’t true.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, researchers measured the blood pressure of a thousand
native Kenyans who ate a low-sodium diet centered around whole plant
foods—whole grains, beans, fruits, and dark, leafy greens, and other
vegetables.11 Up until age forty, the blood pressure of the rural
Africans was similar to that of Europeans and Americans, about 125/80.
However, as Westerners aged, their blood pressure began to surge past
the Kenyans. By age sixty, the average Westerner was hypertensive, with
blood pressure exceeding 140/90. What about the Kenyans? By age sixty,
their average blood pressure had actually improved to an average of
about 110/70.12</p>
<p>The 140/90 threshold for hypertension is considered an arbitrary
cutoff.13 Just like having too much cholesterol or body fat, there are
benefits to having a blood pressure that is even lower than the “normal”
range. So even people who start out with a so-called normal blood
pressure of 120/80 appear to benefit from going down to 110/70.14 But is
it possible to do that? Look at the Kenyans—not only is it possible, it
appears typical for people who live healthy, plant-based lifestyles.</p>
<p>Over a two-year period, 1,800 patients were admitted into a rural
Kenyan hospital. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find?
Zero. There also wasn’t a single case found of America’s number-one
killer, atherosclerosis.15</p>
<p>High blood pressure, then, appears to be a choice. You can continue
eating the artery-bursting Western diet, or you can choose to take off
the pressure. The truth is that eliminating humanity’s primary risk
factor for death may be simple. No drugs, no scalpels. Just forks.</p>
<p>Sodium</p>
<p>The two most prominent dietary risks for death and disability in the
world may be not eating enough fruit and eating too much salt. Nearly
five million people appear to die every year as a result of not eating
enough fruit,16 while eating too much salt may kill up to four
million.17</p>
<p>Salt is a compound made up of about 40 percent sodium and 60 percent
chloride. Sodium is an essential nutrient, but vegetables and other
natural foods provide the small amounts of sodium you need in your diet.
If you consume too much, it can cause water retention, and your body may
respond by raising your blood pressure to push the excess fluid and salt
out of your system.18</p>
<p>For the first 90 percent of human evolution, we likely ate diets
containing less than the equivalent of a quarter teaspoon of salt’s
worth of sodium a day.19 Why? Because we likely ate mostly plants.20 We
went millions of years without saltshakers, so our bodies evolved into
sodium-conserving machines. That served us well until we discovered that
salt could be used to preserve foods.21 Without refrigeration, this was
a boon to human civilization. It didn’t matter that the addition of salt
to our food resulted in a general rise in blood pressure—the alternative
was starving to death because all our food rotted away.</p>
<p>But where does that leave us now? After all, we no longer have to
live off pickles and jerky. Humans are genetically programmed to eat ten
times less sodium than we do now.22 Many so-called low-salt diets can
actually be considered high-salt diets. That’s why it’s critical to
understand what the concept of “normal” is when it comes to sodium.
Having a “normal” salt intake can lead to a “normal” blood pressure,
which can contribute to us dying from all the “normal” causes, like
heart attacks and strokes.23</p>
<p>The American Heart Association recommends everyone consume less than
1,500 mg of sodium daily24—that’s about three-quarters of a teaspoon of
salt. The average American adult consumes more than double that amount,
about 3,500 mg daily.25 Reducing sodium consumption by just 15 percent
worldwide could save millions of lives every year.26</p>
<p>If we could cut our salt intake by about a half teaspoon a day, which
is achievable by avoiding salty foods and not adding salt to our food,
we might prevent 22 percent of stroke deaths and 16 percent of fatal
heart attacks. That’s potentially more lives saved than if we were able
to successfully treat people with blood pressure pills.27 Simply put,
reducing salt is an easy at-home intervention that may be more powerful
than filling a prescription from the pharmacy. Up to ninety-two thousand
American lives could be saved each year simply by eating less
salt.28</p>
<p>The evidence that sodium raises blood pressure is clear, including
double-blind, randomized trials dating back decades.29 If we take
subjects with high blood pressure and put them on a sodium-restricted
diet, their blood pressure drops. If we keep them on the low-salt diet
and add a placebo, nothing happens. However, if we instead give subjects
salt in the form of a time-release sodium pill, their blood pressure
goes back up again.30 The more sodium we give them secretly, the higher
their blood pressure climbs.31</p>
<p>Even just a single meal can do it. If we take people with normal
blood pressure and give them a bowl of soup containing the amount of
salt that may be found in an average American meal,32 their blood
pressure climbs over the next three hours compared to eating the same
soup without any added salt.33 Dozens of similar studies demonstrate
that if you reduce your salt intake, you reduce your blood pressure. And
the greater the reduction, the greater the benefit. But if you don’t cut
down, chronic high salt intake can lead to a gradual increase in blood
pressure throughout life.34</p>
<p>Doctors used to be taught that a “normal” systolic blood pressure is
approximately 100 plus age. Indeed that’s about what you’re born with.
Babies start out with a blood pressure around 95/60. But, as you age,
that 95 can go up to 120 by your twenties. By the time you’re in your
forties, it can be up to 140—the official cutoff for high blood
pressure—and then keep climbing as you get older.35</p>
<p>What would happen if, instead of consuming ten times more sodium than
what your bodies were designed to handle, you just ate the natural
amount found in whole foods? Is it possible your blood pressure would
stay low your whole life? To test that theory, we’d have to find a
population in modern times that doesn’t use salt, eat processed food, or
go out to eat. To find a no-salt culture, scientists had to go deep into
the Amazon rainforest.36</p>
<p>Strangers to saltshakers, Cheetos, and KFC, the Yanomamo Indians were
found to have the lowest sodium intake ever recorded—which is to say the
sodium intake we evolved eating.37 Lo and behold, researchers found that
the blood pressures among older Yanomamo were the same as those of
adolescents.38 In other words, they start out with an average blood
pressure of about 100/60 and stay that way for life. The researchers
couldn’t find a single case of high blood pressure.39</p>
<p>Why do we suspect it was the sodium? After all, the Yanomamos studied
didn’t drink alcohol, ate a high-fiber, plant-based diet, had lots of
exercise, and were not obese.40 An interventional trial could prove that
sodium was the culprit. Imagine if we took people literally dying from
out-of-control high blood pressure (known as malignant hypertension), a
condition from which you go blind from bleeding into your eyes, your
kidneys shut down, and your heart eventually fails. What if you put
these patients on a Yanomamo-level salt intake—in other words, a
normal-for-the-human-species salt intake?</p>
<p>Enter Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice-and-fruit diet. Without drugs,
he brought patients with eye-popping blood pressures like 240/150 down
to 105/80 with dietary changes alone. How could he ethically withhold
medication from such seriously ill patients? Modern high-blood-pressure
pills hadn’t been invented yet—Dr. Kempner conducted his work back in
the 1940s.41 Back then, malignant hypertension was a death sentence,
with a life expectancy of about six months.42 Nevertheless, he was able
to reverse the course of disease with diet in more than 70 percent of
cases.43 Though the diet wasn’t merely extremely low sodium—it was also
strictly plant-based and low in fat and protein—Dr. Kempner is now
recognized as the person who established, beyond any shadow of doubt,
that high blood pressure can often be lowered by a low-sodium
diet.44</p>
<p>In addition to high blood pressure, salty meals can significantly
impair artery function,45 even among people whose blood pressure tends
to be unresponsive to salt intake.46 In other words, salt itself can
injure our arteries independent of its impact on blood pressure. And
that harm begins within thirty minutes.47</p>
<p>Using a technique called laser Doppler flowmetry, researchers are
able to measure blood flow in the tiny vessels in the skin. After a
high-sodium meal, there is significantly less blood flow—unless vitamin
C is injected into the skin, which appears to reverse much of the
sodium-induced suppression of blood vessel function. So, if an
antioxidant helps block the sodium effect, then the mechanism by which
salt impairs arterial function may be oxidative stress, the formation of
free radicals in your bloodstream.48 It turns out that sodium intake
appears to suppress the activity of a key antioxidant enzyme in the body
called superoxide dismutase,49 which has the ability to detoxify a
million free radicals per second.50 With the action of this workhorse of
an enzyme stifled by sodium, artery-crippling levels of oxidative stress
can build up.</p>
<p>After one salty meal, not only does blood pressure increase but the
arteries actually begin to stiffen.51 This may be how we figured out
thousands of years ago that too much salt was bad for us. Quoting from a
translation of The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine, an
ancient Chinese medical text, “If too much salt is used in food, the
pulse hardens…”52 It turns out that we may not need a double-blind
trial; maybe we just have to feed someone a bag of potato chips and take
his or her pulse.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the salt industry isn’t thrilled about the idea of us
cutting back on salt. Back in 2009, the American Heart Association
quoted the chair of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee as
saying that Americans should reduce their sodium intake. The Salt
Institute, a salt industry trade organization, accused her of having an
“unhealthy prejudice” against salt, arguing that she had “pre-judged the
salt issue.”53 This is like the tobacco industry complaining that people
at the American Lung Association are biased against smoking. Of course,
the Salt Institute wasn’t the only aggrieved party. Cheese, it turns
out, ranks as a leading contributor of sodium in the American diet,54
and the National Dairy Council stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Big Salt
in its condemnation of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
recommendations.55</p>
<p>The salt industry has its own PR and lobbying firms to play
tobacco-industry-style tactics to downplay the dangers of its product.56
But the real villains aren’t necessarily the salt-mine barons—it’s the
processed food industry. The trillion-dollar processed food industry
uses dirt-cheap added salt and sugar to sell us their junk.57 That’s why
it’s not easy avoiding sodium on the typical American diet, since
three-quarters of salt comes from processed foods rather than a
saltshaker.58 By hooking you on hypersweet and hypersalty foods, your
taste buds get so dampened that natural foods can taste like cardboard.
Indeed, the ripest fruit may not be as sweet as Froot Loops.</p>
<p>But there are two other major reasons the food industry adds salt to
foods. If you add salt to meat, it draws in water. This way, a company
can increase the weight of its product by nearly 20 percent. Since meat
is sold by the pound, that’s 20 percent more profits for very little
added cost. Second, as everyone knows, eating salt makes us thirsty.
There’s a reason bars put out free baskets of salted nuts and pretzels,
and it’s the same reason soda conglomerates own snack-food companies. A
cold drink and a salty snack go hand in hand. It may be no coincidence
that Pepsi and Frito-Lay are part of the same corporation.59</p>
<p>Pop quiz! Which has been reported to contain the most sodium: a
serving of beef, a serving of baked all-natural chicken, a large
McDonald’s french fries, or a serving of salted pretzels?</p>
<p>The answer? Chicken. The poultry industry commonly injects chicken
carcasses with salt water to artificially inflate their weight, yet they
can still be labelled “100 percent natural.” Consumer Reports found that
some supermarket chickens were pumped so full of salt that they
registered a whopping 840 mg of sodium per serving—that could mean more
than a full day’s worth of sodium in just one chicken breast.60</p>
<p>The number-one source of sodium for American kids and teens is
pizza.61 A single slice of Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza can contain half
your recommended sodium intake limit for the entire day.62 For adults
over fifty, it’s bread, but between the ages of twenty and fifty, the
greatest contributor of sodium to the diet is chicken—not the canned
soups, pretzels, or potato chips one might expect.63</p>
<p>How can you overcome your built-in craving for salt, sugar, and fat?
Just give it a few weeks, and your taste buds will start to change. When
researchers put people on a low-salt diet, over time, the research
subjects increasingly enjoyed the taste of salt-free soup and became
turned off by the salt-heavy soup they had previously craved. As the
study progressed, when the participants were allowed to salt their own
soup to taste, they preferred less and less salt as their taste buds
became acclimated to healthier levels.64</p>
<p>The same may be true for sugar and fat. It’s likely that humans
actually taste fat, just like they taste sweet, sour, and salty
flavors.65 People placed on low-fat diets start preferring low-fat foods
over fatty options.66 Your tongue may actually become more sensitive to
fat, and the more sensitive your tongue becomes, the less butter, meat,
dairy, and eggs you eat. On the flip side, if you eat too much of these
foods, you may blunt your taste for fat, which can cause you to eat more
calories and more fat, dairy, meat, and eggs and ultimately gain
weight.67 This can all happen in just a matter of weeks.68</p>
<p>There are three things you can do to shake the salt habit.69 First,
don’t add salt at the table. (One out of three people may add salt to
their food before even tasting it!)70 Second, stop adding salt when
cooking. The food may taste bland at first, but within two to four
weeks, the salt-taste receptors in your mouth become more sensitive, and
food tastes better. Believe it or not, after two weeks, you may actually
prefer the taste of food with less salt.71 Try any combination of such
fantastic flavorings as pepper, onions, garlic, tomatoes, sweet peppers,
basil, parsley, thyme, celery, lime, chili powder, rosemary, smoked
paprika, curry, coriander, and lemon instead.72 Also, it’s probably a
good idea to avoid eating out as much as possible. Even non-fast-food
restaurants tend to pile on the salt.73 Finally, do what you can to
avoid processed foods.</p>
<p>In most countries studied, processed foods provide only about half of
people’s sodium intake, but in the United States, we consume so much
sodium from processed foods that even if we completely stopped adding
salt in the kitchen and dining room, we’d still only reduce our salt
intake by a small fraction.74 Try to buy foods with fewer milligrams of
sodium on the label than there are grams in the serving size. For
example, if it’s a 100 g serving size, the product should have less than
100 mg of sodium.75 Alternatively, you can shoot for fewer milligrams of
sodium per serving than there are calories. That’s a trick I learned
from one of my favorite dietitians, Jeff Novick. Most people get around
2,200 calories a day, so if everything you ate had more calories than
sodium, you would probably make it at least under the Dietary Guidelines
for Americans’ upper limit of 2,300 mg of sodium a day.76</p>
<p>Ideally, though, you’d buy mostly food without any labels at all. It
is considered almost impossible to come up with a diet consisting of
unprocessed natural foods that exceeds the strict 1,500 mg a day
American Heart Association guidelines for sodium reduction.77</p>
<p>Whole Grains</p>
<p>On average, high blood pressure medications reduce the risk of heart
attack by 15 percent and the risk of stroke by 25 percent.78 But in a
randomized, controlled trial, three portions of whole grains a day were
able to help people achieve this blood-pressure-lowering benefit too.79
The study revealed that a diet rich in whole grains yields the same
benefits without the adverse side effects commonly associated with
antihypertensive drugs, such as electrolyte disturbances in those taking
diuretics (also known as water pills);80 increased breast cancer risk
for those taking calcium-channel blockers (like Norvasc or Cardizem);81
lethargy and impotence for those on beta blockers (like Lopressor and
Corgard);82 sudden, potentially life-threatening swelling for those
taking ACE inhibitors (like Vasotec and Altace);83 and an increased risk
of serious fall injuries for apparently any class of these blood
pressure drugs.84</p>
<p>Whole grains do have side effects, though. Good ones! Whole-grain
intake is associated with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart
disease, weight gain,85 and colon cancer.86 Take note of the whole,
however. While whole grains, such as oats, whole wheat, and brown rice,
have been shown to reduce your risk of developing chronic disease,87
refined grains may actually increase your risk. Harvard University
researchers, for example, found that while regular consumption of brown
rice was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, consuming
white rice was associated with higher risk. Daily servings of white rice
were associated with a 17 percent greater risk of diabetes, whereas
replacing one-third of a serving a day of white rice for brown rice
might lead to a 16 percent drop in risk. And it looks like replacing
white rice with oats and barley may be an even more powerful step,
associated with a 36 percent drop in diabetes risk.88</p>
<p>Given the improvements in cardiac risk factors seen in interventional
trials of whole grains,89 it’s not surprising to see a reduction in the
progression of arterial disease among those who regularly eat them. In
studies of two of the most important arteries in the body, the coronary
arteries that feed the heart and the carotid arteries that feed the
brain, people who ate the most whole grains had significantly slower
narrowing of their arteries.90,91 Since atherosclerotic plaque in the
arteries is our leading killer, ideally, you should not just slow down
the process but actually stop or even reverse it altogether. As we saw
in chapter 1, this appears to require more than just whole grains; whole
vegetables, whole fruits, whole beans, and other whole plant foods are
needed, along with a significant reduction in your intake of trans fats,
saturated fats, and cholesterol, the food components that contribute to
clogging your arteries shut.</p>
<p>What About the DASH Diet?</p>
<p>What if you are among the seventy-eight million Americans who already
have high blood pressure? How can you bring it down?</p>
<p>The American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of
Cardiology (ACC), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) all recommend that patients first try lifestyle modifications,
such as reducing body weight, limiting sodium and alcohol intake,
getting more exercise, and eating a healthier diet.92</p>
<p>However, if their recommended lifestyle changes don’t work, then it’s
off to the pharmacy. First up is a diuretic (water pill), and before you
can spell “pharmaceutical cocktail,” the medications begin piling up
until your blood pressure comes down. High blood pressure patients
commonly end up on three different antihypertensive drugs at a time,93
yet only about half tend to stick to even the first-line drugs.94 (This
is due in part to all their side effects, which can include erectile
dysfunction, fatigue, and leg cramps.)95 At the end of all of this, the
drugs still haven’t gotten to the root cause of the problem. The cause
of high blood pressure isn’t medication deficiency. The underlying cause
is what you eat and how you live.</p>
<p>As we discussed earlier, the ideal blood pressure, defined as the
level at which lowering it further yields no additional benefit, is
probably around 110/70.96 Can you really get it that low without
medication? Remember, this was the average blood pressure of men more
than sixty years old in rural Africa on no treatment other than their
traditional, plant-based diets and lifestyles.97 In rural China, we find
similar results: 110/70 throughout life without any increase with age.98
The reason we suspect that the plant-based nature of their diets is
responsible is because, in the Western world, the only group able to
routinely achieve these blood pressure readings is vegetarians.99</p>
<p>So do the AHA/ACC/CDC guidelines recommend that people with high
blood pressure eat a meat-free diet? No. They recommend the DASH diet,
which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, an eating plan
specifically designed to lower blood pressure.100 Although it’s been
described as a lactovegetarian diet101 (dairy, but no meat or eggs),
that isn’t accurate. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and
low-fat dairy, but meat is still present—you’re just supposed to eat
less of it.102</p>
<p>Why not recommend an even more plant-based diet? We’ve known for
decades that “food of animal origin was highly significantly associated
with systolic and diastolic B[lood] P[ressure] after the age and weight
effects were removed.”103 That’s a quote from a series of studies
performed by renowned physician Frank Sacks and colleagues back in the
1970s, but there are studies going all the way back to the 1920s
demonstrating that adding meat to a plant-based diet can significantly
elevate blood pressure in a matter of days.104</p>
<p>Why isn’t the DASH diet meatless? Based on the work of Dr. Sacks at
Harvard University, the American Heart Association acknowledged that
“[s]ome of the lowest B[lood]P[ressure]s observed in industrialized
countries have been documented in strict vegetarians.…”105 Were the
designers of the DASH diet just not aware of Dr. Sacks’s work? No, the
chair of the committee that designed the diet was Dr. Sacks.106</p>
<p>The reason that the DASH diet was modeled explicitly after vegetarian
diets but was not meat-free itself might surprise you. The primary
design goal of the DASH diet was to explicitly create eating patterns
“that would have the blood pressure lowering benefits of a vegetarian
diet yet contain enough animal products to make them palatable to
nonvegetarians.…”107 Dr. Sacks had even shown that the more dairy
vegetarians consumed, the higher their blood pressure appeared to
rise.108 But he figured there was no point in calling for a diet he
believed few would follow. This is a recurring theme in official dietary
recommendations. Instead of simply telling you what the science shows
and then letting you make up your own mind, experts patronize the
population by advocating what they think is practical rather than ideal.
By making the decision for you, they undermine those willing to make
even greater changes for optimal health.</p>
<p>The DASH diet does help to bring down blood pressure, but the primary
effect seems to arise not from the switch to low-fat dairy and white
meat or the reduction in sweets and added fats but from the added fruits
and vegetables.109 If the benefits are due to the added plant foods, why
not strive to center people’s diets more around these healthiest of
foods in the first place?</p>
<p>This question is even more pointed given a 2014 meta-analysis (a
compilation of many similar studies) showing that vegetarian diets may
be particularly good at lowering blood pressure.110 And the more plants,
perhaps, the better. Meat-free diets in general “confer protection
against cardiovascular diseases … some cancers and total mortality,” but
completely plant-based diets “seem to offer additional protection for
obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
mortality.”111</p>
<p>There appears to be a stepwise drop in hypertension rates the more
plant-based foods you eat. Based on the same study of eighty-nine
thousand Californians featured in chapter 6, compared with people who
eat meat more than once a week, flexitarians (those who eat less meat,
perhaps a few times a month) had 23 percent lower rates of high blood
pressure. Those who cut out all meat except for fish had a 38 percent
lower risk of high blood pressure, and those who cut out all meat had a
55 percent lower rate. People who cut out all meat, eggs, and dairy did
the best, with a 75 percent reduced risk of high blood pressure. Those
eating completely plant-based diets appeared to have thrown
three-quarters of their risk for developing this major killer out the
window.112</p>
<p>When scientists looked at diabetes and body weight, they found the
same apparent progressive improvements as consumption of animal products
decreased and plant foods increased. Those eating plant-based diets had
just a fraction of the diabetes risk even after factoring out the weight
benefits,113 but what about hypertension? On average, those who eat
completely plant-based foods are about thirty pounds lighter than those
eating conventional diets.114 Maybe they have such great blood pressure
just because they’re so much thinner? In other words, do omnivores who
are as slim as vegans enjoy the same blood pressure?</p>
<p>To answer this question, researchers would have to find a group of
individuals who eat the standard American diet but are also as thin as
people eating plant-based diets. To find an omnivorous group that fit
and trim, researchers recruited long-distance endurance athletes who had
run, on average, forty-eight miles per week for twenty-one years.
Running almost two marathons a week for twenty years, pretty much anyone
can become as slim as a plant eater no matter what they eat! The
researchers then compared these hard-core athletes to two groups:
sedentary meat eaters who exercised less than an hour per week and
sedentary vegans who ate mostly unprocessed, uncooked plant foods.</p>
<p>How did the numbers come out? Not surprisingly, the endurance runners
on a standard American diet had a better blood pressure average than
their sedentary, meat-eating counterparts: 122/72 compared with 132/79,
which fits the definition of prehypertensive. But the sedentary vegans?
They averaged an extraordinary 104/62.115 Apparently, eating standard
American fare even when running two thousand miles a year may not bring
down your blood pressure as low as a being a couch-potato vegan.</p>
<hr />
<p>Foods for Additional Hypertension Protection</p>
<p>A low-sodium diet centered around whole plant foods appears to be the
best way to bring down high blood pressure. What if you’re already
eating this way but that 110/70 still eludes you? There are a few foods
in particular you can try that may offer additional protection.</p>
<p>I’ve already touched on whole grains and will go into detail about
flaxseeds, hibiscus tea, and nitrate-rich vegetables. Ground flaxseeds
alone “induced one of the most potent blood-pressure-lowering effects
ever achieved by a dietary intervention.”116 Eating just a few
tablespoons a day appears to be two to three times more powerful than
adopting an aerobic endurance exercise program117 (not that you
shouldn’t do both—incorporate flaxseeds into your diet and
exercise).</p>
<p>Consumption of both raw and cooked vegetables is associated with
lower blood pressure, but raw veggies may be slightly more
protective.118 Studies have also found that loading up on beans, split
peas, chickpeas, and lentils may help a little,119 so add those to your
shopping list. Red wine may help, but only nonalcoholic brands. Only
wine that has had the alcohol removed appears to lower blood
pressure.120</p>
<p>Watermelon appears to offer protection, which is great (and
delicious) news, but you may have to eat about two pounds of it per day
to achieve an effect.121 Kiwifruits flopped, though. In a study funded
by a kiwifruit company, kiwi failed to offer any protection.122 Perhaps
the kiwi industry should take a cue from the California Raisin Marketing
Board, which funded a study designed to show that raisins can reduce
blood pressure. To inflate the benefits of raisins, they used junk food
as the control group. So the study found raisins may lower blood
pressure, but only, apparently, compared to fudge cookies, Cheez-Its,
and Chips Ahoy!123</p>
<hr />
<p>Flaxseed</p>
<p>In chapters 11 and 13, we will see how effective flaxseeds can be
against breast and prostate cancers, but you have to be a little
skeptical when scientists throw around words like “miraculous” to
describe them. (One medical journal published a review titled “Flaxseed:
A Miraculous Defense Against Some Critical Maladies.”)124 But a
remarkable intervention trial published in the journal Hypertension
suggests that in this case, the term “miraculous” may not be too far
off.</p>
<p>Rarely does one see a dietary study of this caliber: It was a
prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. That’s
hard to pull off with food. With a drug trial, a blinded study is easy:
Researchers give someone a sugar pill that looks identical to the drug,
so that neither the study subject nor the person giving the pill knows
which one is which (hence, double-blind). But how do you do that with
food? People tend to notice if you try to sneak a quarter cup of ground
flaxseed into their lunch.</p>
<p>The researchers tried a clever tactic to overcome this problem. They
created a number of recipes for common foods including muffins and pasta
in which they could disguise placebo ingredients like bran and molasses
to match the texture and color of the flax-laden foods. This way, they
could randomize people into two groups and secretly introduce
tablespoons of daily ground flaxseeds into the diets of half the
participants to see if it made any difference.</p>
<p>After six months, those who ate the placebo foods started out
hypertensive and stayed hypertensive, despite the fact that many of them
were on a variety of blood pressure pills. On average, they started the
study at 155/81 and ended it at 158/81. What about the hypertensives who
were unknowingly eating flaxseeds every day? Their blood pressure
dropped from 158/82 down to 143/75. A seven-point drop in diastolic
blood pressure may not sound like a lot, but that would be expected to
result in 46 percent fewer strokes and 29 percent less heart disease
over time.125</p>
<p>How does that result compare with taking drugs? The flaxseeds managed
to drop subjects’ systolic and diastolic blood pressure by up to fifteen
and seven points, respectively. Compare that result to the effect of
powerful antihypertensive drugs, such as calcium-channel blockers (for
example, Norvasc, Cardizem, Procardia), which have been found to reduce
blood pressure by only eight and three points, respectively, or to ACE
inhibitors (such as Vasotec, Lotensin, Zestril, Altace), which drop
patients’ blood pressure by only five and two points, respectively.126
Ground flaxseeds may work two to three times better than these
medicines, and they have only good side effects. In addition to their
anticancer properties, flaxseeds have been demonstrated in clinical
studies to help control cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood sugar
levels; reduce inflammation, and successfully treat constipation.127</p>
<p>Hibiscus Tea for Hypertension</p>
<p>Hibiscus tea, derived from the flower of the same name, is also known
as roselle, sorrel, jamaica, or sour tea. With a distinct tart,
cranberry-like flavor and bright red color, this herbal tea is served
and enjoyed both hot and cold around the world. In a comparison of the
antioxidant content of 280 common beverages, hibiscus ranked number-one,
beating out other heavyweights, including the oft-lauded green tea.128
Within an hour of consumption, the antioxidant power of your bloodstream
shoots up, demonstrating that the antioxidant phytonutrients in the tea
are absorbed into your system.129 What effects might this infusion have
on your health?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, efficacy against obesity has been disappointing. After
giving hibiscus tea to overweight individuals for months, researchers
have only been able to show about an extra half pound of weight loss per
month over a placebo.130 Early studies on cholesterol-lowering effects
looked promising, suggesting that drinking two cups of hibiscus tea a
day for a month may provide as much as an 8 percent drop in
cholesterol,131 but when all such studies were put together, the results
were pretty much a wash.132 This may be because, for some reason,
hibiscus tea only seemed to have an effect on about half the study
subjects. If you’re in the lucky half, you may be able to get as much as
a 12 percent drop in cholesterol.133</p>
<p>But high blood pressure is where hibiscus really shines.134 A
double-blind, placebo-controlled study out of Tufts University that
compared hibiscus tea with an artificially colored and flavored
lookalike showed that three cups of hibiscus tea a day significantly
lowered blood pressure in prehypertensive adults better than the placebo
beverage.135 But by how much? How does drinking hibiscus tea compare
with other interventions?</p>
<p>The PREMIER Clinical Trial randomized hundreds of men and women with
elevated blood pressure into an “advice only” control group or an active
lifestyle intervention group. The control group was given a brochure and
told to lose weight, reduce their salt intake, get more exercise, and
eat healthier (i.e., to go on the DASH diet). The behavioral
intervention group received the same instruction but also got
face-to-face sessions, attended group meetings, kept food diaries, and
monitored their physical activity, calories, and sodium intake. Within
six months, the intervention group achieved a four-point drop in
systolic blood pressure compared with the advice-only group. That may
not seem like a lot, but on a population scale, a five-point drop may
lead to 14 percent fewer stroke deaths, 9 percent fewer fatal heart
attacks, and 7 percent fewer deaths overall each year.136 Meanwhile, in
the Tufts study, a cup of hibiscus tea with each meal managed to lower
subjects’ systolic blood pressure by six points over the control
group.137</p>
<p>To lower blood pressure, you should still lose weight, reduce your
salt intake, get more exercise, and eat healthier, but the evidence
shows that adding hibiscus tea to your daily routine may offer an
additional benefit, comparable even to that provided by antihypertensive
drugs. Tested head-to-head against a leading blood pressure drug, two
cups of strong hibiscus tea every morning (using a total of five tea
bags) was as effective in lowering subjects’ blood pressure as a
starting dose of the drug Captopril taken twice a day.138</p>
<p>However, there are differences: Captopril can have side effects, most
commonly rash, cough, and taste impairment, and it can even, though
extremely rarely, cause fatal swelling of the throat.139 No side effects
were reported for hibiscus tea, though it isn’t called sour tea for
nothing. If you drink it, make sure to rinse your mouth with water
afterward to keep the natural acids in the tea from softening the enamel
on your teeth.140 And given the extraordinary manganese content in
hibiscus tea,141 to be on the safe side, I wouldn’t recommend drinking
more than a quart of it a day.</p>
<p>The Power of NO</p>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a key biological messenger within the body, and
its message is: “Open Sesame!” When released by your endothelium (the
cells lining your arteries), it signals the muscle fibers within the
walls of your arteries to relax, allowing them to open up and for more
blood to flow. That’s how nitroglycerin pills work: The nitroglycerin
people take when they’re experiencing chest pain is converted into NO,
which dilates the coronary arteries, allowing more blood to flow to the
heart muscle. Erectile dysfunction (ED) pills like Viagra work the same
way; they boost nitric oxide signaling, which relaxes penile arteries
and improves blood flow to the penis.</p>
<p>The ED you really need to be concerned about, though, is endothelial
dysfunction, the failure of the linings of your arteries to produce
enough NO to properly dilate them. Nitric oxide is produced by an enzyme
called NO synthase. Its enemy is free radicals, which not only gobble up
nitric oxide but can hijack NO synthase and force it to start pumping
out additional free radicals.142 Without enough NO, your arteries can
then stiffen, become dysfunctional, and raise your blood pressure and
your risk for heart attack.</p>
<p>So you need to flood your body with antioxidant-rich plant foods
throughout the day to extinguish the free radicals and let NO synthase
get back to its job of keeping your arteries fully functional. There’s
an ultrasound device researchers use to measure the NO-induced dilation
of your arteries. One study using this device found that if you take
people following a standard Western diet and have them eat even fewer
antioxidants, their artery dilation only gets a little bit worse. It
seems we’re already near the bottom of the barrel
arterial-function-wise, so there’s not much room for further decline.
But put people on a high-antioxidant diet by, among many other things,
switching their bananas for berries and their white chocolate for dark,
and within just two weeks, they experience a significant boost in their
arteries’ ability to relax and dilate normally.143</p>
<p>In addition to eating antioxidant-rich foods that can boost your
body’s ability to produce NO, you can also eat certain vegetables, such
as beets and greens, that are rich in natural nitrates, which your body
can convert into nitric oxide. (For the difference between nitrates and
nitrites, see chapter 10.) This process explains why researchers have
been able to show a ten-point systolic blood pressure drop in volunteers
within hours of their consuming beet juice—an effect that lasted
throughout the day.144</p>
<p>That study was performed on a group of healthy subjects, though.
Obviously, we need to test the power of beets where it counts most—in
people with high blood pressure. If nitrate-rich vegetables can so
powerfully modulate humanity’s leading risk factor for dying, why did it
take until 2015 before such a study was published? Well, who was going
to fund it? Big Beet? Drug companies rake in more than 0 billion a year
from blood pressure medications.145 You can’t make billions on beets.
That’s why we are fortunate to have charities like the British Heart
Foundation, which finally funded a beet juice study involving people
with high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Half the subjects were provided a cup of beet juice daily for four
weeks, while the other half was given an indistinguishable, nitrate-free
placebo drink. The researchers found that not only was systolic blood
pressure reduced by about eight points in the beet-juice drinkers but
the benefits grew week by week, suggesting their blood pressure might
have continued to improve even further. The scientists concluded that
“nitrate-rich vegetables may prove to be both cost-effective,
affordable, and favorable for a public health approach to
hypertension.”146</p>
<p>The optimal dose appears to be one-half cup,147 but beet juice is
perishable, processed, and hard to find. A typical fifteen-ounce can of
beets would provide the same dose of nitrate, but the most concentrated
sources of the compound are dark-green, leafy vegetables. The following
is a top-ten list of nitrate-rich foods, in ascending order. As you’ll
see, eight out of the top ten are greens.</p>
<hr />
<p>TOP-TEN FOOD SOURCES OF NITRATES</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>Beets</p></li>
<li><p>Swiss chard</p></li>
<li><p>Oak leaf lettuce</p></li>
<li><p>Beet greens</p></li>
<li><p>Basil</p></li>
<li><p>Mesclun greens</p></li>
<li><p>Butter leaf lettuce</p></li>
<li><p>Cilantro</p></li>
<li><p>Rhubarb</p></li>
<li><p>Arugula</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Arugula comes out on top with a whopping 480 mg of nitrate per
hundred-gram serving, which is more than four times the content of
beets.148</p>
<p>The healthiest way to get your nitrate fix is to eat a big salad
every day. You could take nitrate- and nitric-oxide-boosting
supplements, but they have questionable safety149 and efficacy150
records and should be avoided. What about V8 juice, which boasts both
beet and spinach juice? It must not have much, because you’d have to
drink nineteen quarts of it a day to reach your daily nitrate intake
target.151</p>
<p>The benefits of nitrates may explain why eating your greens is
associated with reduced rates of heart disease152 and a longer life
span,153 not to mention the “veggie Viagra” effect. You read that right.
There’s a link between vegetable consumption and improved sexual
function,154 as well as improved blood flow to the most important organ
of the body, the brain.155 And the only side effect of beeting your
brains out may be a little extra color in your life—namely, red stools
and urine that is pretty in pee-nk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Doping with Beet Juice</p>
<p>A Lamborghini goes faster than a lemon not because the chemistry of
gasoline combustion is somehow different in a sports car from that in a
beater. It’s because the Lambo has a more powerful engine. Similarly,
athletes may have bigger muscles and be able to get more oxygen to those
muscles faster. But fundamentally, the amount of energy a body can
extract from oxygen remains the same … or so we thought.</p>
<p>About five years ago, one of the gospels of sports physiology got
turned on its head—all because of beet juice.</p>
<p>Nitrates, concentrated in green, leafy vegetables and beets, not only
help deliver oxygenated blood to your muscles by helping dilate your
arteries but also enable your body to extract more energy from that
oxygen—something never before thought possible. For example, one little
shot of beet juice has been found to allow free divers to hold their
breath for a half minute longer than usual.156 After sipping beet juice,
cyclists were able to perform at the same level of intensity while
consuming 19 percent less oxygen than the placebo group. Then, when they
ramped up their bike resistance for an intense bout of what they called
“severe cycling,” the time to exhaustion was extended from 9:43 minutes
to 11:15 minutes. The beet-juice-drinking group exhibited greater
endurance while using less oxygen. In short, the beet juice made the
bikers’ bodies’ energy production significantly more efficient. No drug,
steroid, supplement, or intervention had ever before been shown to do
what beet juice could do.157</p>
<p>This effect works with whole beets too. In another study, men and
women eating one and a half cups of baked beets seventy-five minutes
before running a 5K race improved their running performance while
maintaining the same heart rate and even reported less exertion.158
Faster time with less effort? Them’s some block-rockin’ beets!</p>
<p>To maximize athletic performance, the ideal dose and timing appears
to be a half cup of beet juice (or three three-inch beets, or a cup of
cooked spinach159) two to three hours before a competition.160</p>
<p>It seems sports news programs are always talking about steroids and
other illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Why hasn’t anyone mentioned
these mighty and perfectly legit performance-enhancing vegetables? Beets
me.</p>
<hr />
<p>A blood pressure checkup is easy to ignore or postpone. Unlike the
case with many of our other leading killers, the insidious consequences
of hypertension may not be apparent until you’re lifted into an
ambulance or lowered into a grave. So go to your local pharmacy, fire
station, or doctor’s office and get your blood pressure checked. If it’s
too high, the bad news is that you’ll join the one billion people living
with this condition. The good news is that you don’t have to join the
millions who die from it every year. Try eating and living healthfully
for even just a few weeks, and you may be amazed by the results. Here
are just a few stories about people who did just that.</p>
<p>Every day, NutritionFacts.org gets hundreds of e-mails, many from
people eager to share how their lives were turned around by taking their
health into their own hands. There’s Bob, for example, who once weighed
230 pounds and had a 200-plus cholesterol level and triglycerides
through the roof. He was on a battery of blood pressure medications.
After starting a whole-food, plant-based diet, he’s now down to 175
pounds, boasts a total cholesterol of 136, and no longer takes any blood
pressure meds. At sixty-five, Bob feels better now than he has in
decades, not by trying a new exercise program or the latest blockbuster
drug—just by changing his diet.</p>
<p>Patricia e-mailed not long ago. Her brother had just been diagnosed
with severe high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. He was nearly sixty
pounds overweight, and his skin was the color of “white paper.” He was
so unhealthy he couldn’t even get a driver’s license. Patricia and her
brother decided to start a plant-based diet together. Now he’s fit and
trim, his weight is normal, he has no more need for blood pressure
drugs, and Patricia most deservedly takes the (sugar-, milk-, and
egg-free) cake for best sister ever.</p>
<p>Then there’s Dean. He “filled up” with the standard American diet and
became obese. He had high blood pressure, so his doctor put him on meds.
Then he got high cholesterol, so his doctor put him on more meds.
Moreover, every winter, Dean would suffer from terrible respiratory
infections that required antibiotics. Finally, he got fed up and adopted
a plant-based diet. He’s now lost fifty pounds. His blood sugar and
cholesterol levels, and even his blood pressure, are all normal. And he
happily spends his winters ailment-free. Dean ended his note to me with
this simple pledge: “I will be on a plant-based diet for the rest of my
life.” Thanks to a healthy diet, that may be quite a long time.</p>
