<h4 id="v">V</h4>
<p>At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know,
whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were
slight differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had
beaten him were below ground level. The room where he had been
interrogated by O’Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many
metres underground, as deep down as itwas possible to go.</p>
<p>It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly
noticed his surroundings.All he noticed was that there were two small
tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was
only a metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door.
He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move
nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind,
forcing him to look straight in front of him.</p>
<p>For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O’Brien came
in.</p>
<p>“You asked me once,” said O’Brien, “what was in Room 101. I told you
that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is
in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world.”</p>
<p>The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of
wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table.
Because of the position in which O’Brien was standing. Winston could not
see what the thing was.</p>
<p>“The worst thing in the world,” said O’Brien, “varies from individual
to individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning,
or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is
some quite trivial thing, not even fatal.”</p>
<p>He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view
of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on
top for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it wassomething that
looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it
was three or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was
divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind
of creature in each. They were rats.</p>
<p>“In your case,” said O’Brien, “the worst thing in the world happens
to be rats.”</p>
<p>A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had
passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the
cage. But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in
front of it suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to
water.</p>
<p>“You can’t do that!” he cried out in a high cracked voice. “You
couldn’t, you couldn’t! It’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember,” said O’Brien, “the moment of panic that used to
occur in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and
a roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other
side of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you darednot
drag it into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of
the wall.”</p>
<p>“O’Brien!” said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. “You
know this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?”</p>
<p>O’Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the
schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. He looked
thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience
somewhere behind Winston’s back.</p>
<p>“By itself,” he said, “pain is not always enough. There are occasions
when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of
death. But for everyone there is something unendurable – something that
cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you
are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you
have come up from deepwater it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with
air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same
with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of
pressure that youcannot withstand. even if you wished to. You will do
what is required of you.</p>
<p>“But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don’t know what it
is?”</p>
<p>O’Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table.
He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the
blood singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter
loneliness. He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert
drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of
immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away
from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat’s
muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.</p>
<p>“The rat,” said O’Brien, still addressing his invisible audience,
“although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have
heard of the things that happen in the poorquarters of this town. In
some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even
for five minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a
small time they will strip it to thebones. They also attack sick or
dying people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human
being is helpless.”</p>
<p>There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach
Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get
at each other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of
despair. That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.</p>
<p>O’Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in
it. There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear
himself loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even
his head, was held immovably. O’Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less
than a metre from Winston’s face.</p>
<p>“I have pressed the first lever,” said O’Brien. “You understand the
construction of this cage.The mask will fit over your head, leaving no
exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever
seen a rat leapthrough the air? They will leap on to your face and bore
straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they
burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue.”</p>
<p>The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of
shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head.
But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with
a split second left –to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty
odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion
of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had
gone black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he
came out of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one
way to save himself. He must interpose another human being, the body of
another human being, between himself and the rats.</p>
<p>The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of
anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face.
The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down,
the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with
hispink hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston
could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took
hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.</p>
<p>“It was a common punishment in Imperial China,” said O’Brien as
didactically as ever.</p>
<p>The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And
then –no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too
late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole
world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment
–one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was
shouting frantically, over and over.</p>
<p>“Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don’t care what you
do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not
me!”</p>
<p>He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats.
He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor,
through the walls of the building, through the earth,through the oceans,
through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the
stars -always away, away, away from the rats. He was light years
distant, but O’Brien was still standing athis side. There was still the
cold touch of wire against his cheek. But through the darkness that
enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the cage
door had clicked shut and not open.</p>
