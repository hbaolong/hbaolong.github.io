<h4 id="vi">VI</h4>
<p>Winston was writing in his diary:</p>
<p>It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow
side-street nearone of the big railway stations. She was standing near a
doorway in the wall, under astreet lamp that hardly gave any light. She
had a young face, painted very thick. Itwas really the paint that
appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and thebright red
lips. Party women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in
thestreet, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I-</p>
<p>For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and
pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that
kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a
string of filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head
against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through
the window –to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black
out the memory that was tormenting him.</p>
<p>Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any
moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some
visible symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a
few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member,
agedthirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They
were a few metres apart when the left side of the man’s face was
suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again just as
theywere passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as
the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered
thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was
frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The most
deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of
guarding against that, so far as he could see.</p>
<p>He drew his breath and went on writing:</p>
<p>I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a
basementkitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the
table, turned down verylow. She-</p>
<p>His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit.
Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of
Katharine, his wife. Winston was married –had been married,at any rate:
probably he still was married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead.
He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement
kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous
cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party
ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles used
scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with
fornication.</p>
<p>When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two
years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of
course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve
yourself to break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death
matter. To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a
forced-labour camp: not more, if you had committed no other offence. And
it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught inthe
act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell
themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the
proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Partywas even inclined to
encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be
altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long
as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged
and despised class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party
members. But –though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the
great purges invariably confessed to –it was difficult to imagine any
such thing actually happening.</p>
<p>The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from
forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real,
undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not
love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as
outside it. All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a
committee appointed for thepurpose, and –though the principle was never
clearly stated –permission was always refused if the couple concerned
gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The
onlyrecognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service
of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly
disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never
put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every
Party member from childhood onwards. There were even organizations such
as the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for
both sexes. All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination
(artsem, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public
institutions. This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether
seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the
Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could
not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why this
was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And as far as the
women were concerned, the Party’s efforts were largely successful.</p>
<p>He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten –nearly eleven
years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of
her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever
been married. They had only been together for about fifteen months.The
Party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in
cases where there were no children.</p>
<p>Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid
movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have
called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible
nothing behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided –
though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew
most people –that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar,
empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not a thought in her
head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none
that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to
her. “The human sound-track” he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he
could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing
– sex.</p>
<p>As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace
her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was
that even when she was claspinghim against her he had the feeling that
she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The
rigidlty of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie
there withshut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting.
It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But
even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that
they should remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who
refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the
performance continued to happen, once a week quite regulariy, whenever
it was not impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning,
as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be
forgotten. She had two names for it. One was “making a baby”, and the
other was “our duty to the Party” (yes, she had actually used that
phrase). Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the
appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end
she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted.</p>
<p>Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and wrote:</p>
<p>She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of
preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up
her skirt. I-</p>
<p>He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of
bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of
defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the
thought of Katharine’s white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power
of the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not
have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of
years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women
of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as
Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water,
by the rubbish that was dinned into them atschool and in the Spies and
the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial
music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told
him that there must beexceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They
were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be. And
what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall
of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual act,
successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to
have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been
like a seduction, although she was his wife.</p>
<p>But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:</p>
<p>I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light-</p>
<p>After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed
very bright. For the firsttime he could see the woman properly. He had
taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He
was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was
perfectlypossible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for
that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he
went away without even doing what he had come here to do–!</p>
<p>It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he
had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. The paint
was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might
crack like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair;
but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little
open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth
at all.</p>
<p>He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:</p>
<p>When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years
old atleast. But I went ahead and did it just the same.</p>
<p>He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it
down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The
urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as
ever.</p>
