<h4 id="vii">VII</h4>
<p>Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled
sleepily against him, murmuring something that might have been “What’s
the matter?”</p>
<p>“I dreamt–” he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put
into words. Therewas the dream itself, and there was a memory connected
with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.</p>
<p>He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the
dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to
stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain.
It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the
glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was
flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable
distances. The dream had also been comprehended by -indeed, in some
sense it had consisted in –a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and
made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the
news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the
helicopter blew them both to pieces.</p>
<p>“Do you know,” he said, “that until this moment I believed I had
murdered my mother?”</p>
<p>“Why did you murder her?” said Julia, almost asleep.</p>
<p>“I didn’t murder her. Not physically.”</p>
<p>In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and
within a few momentsof waking the cluster of small events surrounding it
had all come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed
out of his consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the
date, but he could not have been less than ten years old, possibly
twelve, when it had happened.</p>
<p>His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he
could not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy
circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the
sheltering in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the
unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners, the gangs of
youths in shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside the
bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance –above all,
the fact that there was never enough to eat. He remembered long
afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and
rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potatopeelings,
sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully
scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks
which travelled over a certain route and wereknown to carry cattle feed,
and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, sometimes
spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.</p>
<p>When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or
any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to have
become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she
was waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything
that was needed – cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor,
dusted the mantelpiece –always very slowly and with a curious lack of
superfluous motion, like an artist’s lay-figure moving of its own
accord. Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into
stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed,
nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or
three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would
take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time
without saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and
selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned
thing that was about to happen.</p>
<p>He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room
that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a
gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where foodwas kept, and on the
landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several
rooms. He remembered his mother’s statuesque body bending over the gas
ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his
continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would
ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more
food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of
his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed
in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in
his efforts to get more than his share. His mother was quite ready to
give him more than his share. She took it for granted that he, “the
boy”, should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he
invariably demanded more. At every meal she would beseech him not to be
selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed
food, but it was no use. He would cry out with rage when she stopped
ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands,
he would grab bits from his sister’s plate. Heknew that he was starving
the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a
right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him.
Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly
pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.</p>
<p>One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been no such issue
for weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious
little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked
about ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious
that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though
he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a
loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother
told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went
round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings.
His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a
baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful
eyes. In the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate
and gave it toWinston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The
little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing
what it was. Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden
swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister’s
hand and was fleeing for the door.</p>
<p>“Winston, Winston!” his mother called after him. “Come back! Give
your sister back her chocolate!”</p>
<p>He stopped, but did not come back. His mother’s anxious eyes were
fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not
know what it was that was on the point of happening. His sister,
conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail.
His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her
breast. Something in thegesture told him that his sister was dying. He
turned and fled down the stairs. with the chocolate growing sticky in
his hand.</p>
<p>He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he
felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for
several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother
had disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing
was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not
taken any clothes, not even his mother’s overcoat. To this day he did
not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly
possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for
his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of
the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were
called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might
have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother, or simply left
somewhere or other to die.</p>
<p>The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping
protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be
contained. His mind went back to another dream of twomonths ago. Exactly
as his mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child
clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him,
and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through
the darkening water.</p>
<p>He told Julia the story of his mother’s disappearance. Without
opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more
comfortable position.</p>
<p>“I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,” she said
indistinctly. “All children are swine.”</p>
<p>“Yes. But the real point of the story–”</p>
<p>From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep
again. He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did
not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an
unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed
a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that
she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not
be altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her thatan action
which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone,
you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him
love. When the last of the chocolate wasgone, his mother had clasped the
child in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce
more chocolate, it did not avert the child’s death or her own; but it
seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also
covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the
bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had
done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no
account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the
material world. When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you
felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made
literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you
nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of
the stream of history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago
this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not
attempting to alter history. They were governedby private loyalties
which they did not question. What mattered were individual
relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a
word spoken to a dying man, could have valuein itself. The proles, it
suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were
notloyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one
another. For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or
think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to
life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had not
become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive emotions which
he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort. And in thinking this he
remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen
a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter
as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.</p>
<p>“The proles are human beings,” he said aloud. “We are not human.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” said Julia, who had woken up again.</p>
<p>He thought for a little while. “Has it ever occurred to you,” he
said, “that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of
here before it’s too late, and never see each other again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I’m not going
to do it, all the same.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been lucky,” he said “but it can’t last much longer. You’re
young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like
me, you might stay alive for another fifty years.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ve thought it all out. What you do, I’m going to do. And don’t
be too downhearted. I’m rather good at staying alive.”</p>
<p>“We may be together for another six months –a year –there’s no
knowing. At the end we’re certain to be apart. Do you realize how
utterly alone we shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be
nothing, literally nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I
confess, they’ll shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they’ll shoot
you just the same. Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from
saying, will put off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of
us will evenknow whether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly
without power of any kind. The one thing that matters is that we
shouldn’t betray one another, although even that can’t make theslightest
difference.”</p>
<p>“If you mean confessing,” she said, “we shall do that, right enough.
Everybody always confesses. You can’t help it. They torture you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or
do doesn’t matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop
loving you –that would be the real betrayal.”</p>
<p>She thought it over. “They can’t do that,” she said finally. “It’s
the one thing they can’t do. They can make you say anything –anything
–but they can’t make you believe it. They can’t get inside you.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said a little more hopefully, “no; that’s quite true. They
can’t get inside you. If you can feel that staying human is worth while,
even when it can’t have any result whatever, you’vebeaten them.”</p>
<p>He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could
spy upon you night andday, but if you kept your head you could still
outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the
secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps
that was less true when you were actually in their hands. One did not
know what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to
guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your
nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude
and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not be kept
hidden. They could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed
out of you by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to
stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter
your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even
if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything
that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose
workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.</p>
