<h4 id="vi">VI</h4>
<p>It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life,
it seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.</p>
<p>He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was
almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when
he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind
him. The person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a
prelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was
O’Brien.</p>
<p>At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse
was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been
incapable of speaking. O’Brien, however, had continued forward in the
same movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston’s arm, so
that the two of them were walking side by side. He began speaking with
the peculiar gravecourtesy that differentiated him from the majority of
Inner Party members.</p>
<p>“I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,” he said. “I
was reading one of yourNewspeak articles in the Times the other day. You
take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?”</p>
<p>Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. “Hardly
scholarly,” he said. “I’m only an amateur. It’s not my subject. I have
never had anything to do with the actual construction of the
language.”</p>
<p>“But you write it very elegantly,” said O’Brien. “That is not only my
own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is
certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment.”</p>
<p>Again Winston’s heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that
this was anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only
dead, he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him
would have been mortally dangerous. O’Brien’s remark must obviouslyhave
been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of
thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. They had
continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but nowO’Brien halted.
With the curious, disarming friendliness that he always managed to put
in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went
on:</p>
<p>“What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed
you had used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only
become so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak
Dictionary?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Winston. “I didn’t think it had been issued yet. We are
still using the ninth in the Records Department.”</p>
<p>“The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe.
But a few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It
might interest you to look at it, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Very much so,” said Winston, immediately seeing where this
tended.</p>
<p>“Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in
the number of verbs -that is the point that will appeal to you, I think.
Let me see, shall I send a messenger to you with thedictionary? But I am
afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick
it up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you my
address.”</p>
<p>They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absentmindedly
O’Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small
leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the
telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other
end of the instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an
address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.</p>
<p>“I am usually at home in the evenings,” he said. “If not, my servant
will give you the dictionary.”</p>
<p>He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this
time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized
what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory
hole along with a mass of other papers.</p>
<p>They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the
most. There was onlyone meaning that the episode could possibly have. It
had been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O’Brien’s address.
This was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was
neverpossible to discover where anyone lived. There were no directories
of any kind. “If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,”
was what O’Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a
message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one
thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and
he had reached the outer edges of it.</p>
<p>He knew that sooner or later he would obey O’Brien’s summons. Perhaps
tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay – he was not certain. What was
happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years
ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second
had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words,
and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would
happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was
contained in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it
was like aforetaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while
he was speaking to O’Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a
chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. Hehad the
sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much
better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting
for him.</p>
