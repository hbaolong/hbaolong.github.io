<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>If I had begun the process of civilizing the Johnson men, it is the
arrival of Bobby that has the biggest impact.</p>
<p>Frank is like a caricature of a doting father: He wants to do
everything I do, he’d breastfeed Bobby if he could. When he comes in
from the farm each night he holds his arms out, impatient for his turn,
holding Bobby so tightly against him our baby’s skin is scented with the
day’s labor—cow dung, tractor oil, and Imperial Leather, the soap Frank
uses so frequently throughout the day I have come to think of it as his
particular smell.</p>
<p>“I missed you,” Frank says, kissing his son’s soft cheeks. “And you.”
He reaches out to grab whichever part of me is nearest.</p>
<p>I always save Bobby’s bath-time for Frank, no matter what time he
comes in from the farm. I fill up a tub with warm water and Frank lowers
him in, swooshing him back and forth, while I dab at his face with a
soft flannel. Mostly, the two of us gaze down at him in wonder, cooing
occasionally. It’s my favorite time of day.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise is the way David falls for Bobby. Frank and
Jimmy always mentioned how absent David was in their childhood, out on
the farm all hours of the day. Now he is a changed man. In the evenings,
he sits with his grandson on his lap, singing to him, songs that come
from another age, music hall numbers and lullabies Frank and I have
never heard. He reads the newspaper to him, which seems strange at
first, but there is something about David’s low, gravelly voice that
lulls Bobby to sleep. If Bobby is crying, I’ll hand him to David and
say: “Can you work your magic?” And it is like magic, for the baby
settles instantly in his grandfather’s solid embrace.</p>
<p>“Will you look at that?” David says, looking up at me, thrilled.</p>
<p>Bobby has humanized him. This stiff, wordless farmer has become a man
who laughs and sings and smiles. In bed, at night, Frank and I whisper
to one another that our baby is nothing less than a miracle.</p>
<p>The change is apparent in Jimmy too. He’s still in trouble at school
from time to time, but I have noticed a new confidence in him. Jimmy has
grown up, or perhaps it is more that ever since he stepped in and calmly
delivered our son, averting disaster without once giving in to panic, I
have found myself looking up to him. He is someone who can thrive in a
crisis.</p>
<p>When Bobby is a few weeks old I start walking around the farm, baby
strapped to me in a sling I fashion from an old blanket. The farm seems
vast and unending when you traverse it by foot, it’s rare to pass anyone
else. Sometimes it feels as if Bobby and I are the last people on
earth.</p>
<p>I talk to my sleeping infant as we parade around the land, which is
his land, I tell him.</p>
<p>“One day, Bobby, you’ll be doing this with your son or daughter.”</p>
<p>There are so many species of birds here and David seems to know them
all. On warm evenings he’ll walk out with us, his fields changing color
in the dusk light, a shimmering purple, a deep blue. He teaches me how
to recognize lapwings and yellowhammers and chaffinches by sight and by
song. Nothing is too small to go unremarked upon. Butterflies are
named—marbled white, skipper, meadow brown—and a scurrying vole makes
him gaze upward for the predator he always finds. A sudden rustle alerts
him to hedgehogs, perfectly camouflaged in nondescript brown, as they
hunt for beetles and slugs. When we stumble upon a litter of tumbling
fox cubs, David grows still and I do the same. In silence we watch them
play while, close by, their mother hunts for food. It feels like a gift
catching this.</p>
<p>Through David’s eyes, Blakely Farm is coming alive for me.</p>
<p>Before Bobby is a year old, David starts taking him around the farm
on his tractor.</p>
<p>“You will be careful?” I say, but David just laughs, driving away
with the baby wedged between his knees.</p>
<p>He drives with one arm on the steering wheel, the other draped
casually around his grandson. I am glad of the time alone but I never
relax until they return to the yard an hour or so later, both
beaming.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry,” Frank says, when I tell him of my fears at
night, the two of us facing each other in the darkness. “My dad is a
safe pair of hands. He grew up on this farm. He would never let anything
happen to Bobby.”</p>
<p>Look what happened to your mother, I think, although I would never
say so. Her accident, being kicked in the head while she was milking,
came out of the blue and couldn’t have been avoided. A stark reminder,
if ever there was one, that you could never be too careful on the
farm.</p>
<p>Despite my misgivings, I adore the way Bobby is growing up with his
grandfather. Before long he’ll be shooting and skinning rabbits himself,
he’ll fish for pike and carp, he will learn to birth a lamb, he will be
able to name every bird and insect on this two-hundred-acre farm; all
the wisdom that has been passed through the Johnson men over generations
will be his. It is his right. And I want that for him.</p>
