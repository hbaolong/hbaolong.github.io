<h4 id="section">1968</h4>
<p>Everyone in Hemston had their own view about what happened that
night: How the young farmer lost his life. Some thought Frank Johnson
had finally flipped and shot his brother after an argument. God knows,
they said, pausing to chat as they collected their milk and papers from
the village shop, he’d had more put upon him in the last few years than
any man could be reasonably expected to take.</p>
<p>The first story, broken the next morning by the Daily Express, had
caused shock waves in the village with its stark headline: “Novelist’s
Love Tryst Ends in Death.”</p>
<p>To think, people said, putting the kettle on for another Nescafé,
lingering over their Rice Krispies and Weetabix, their hot buttered
toast, something so menacing had happened right on their doorstep. It
was more lurid and shocking than one of Gabriel Wolfe’s novels.</p>
<p>Back then, only the sparest facts were known. Frank Johnson had been
arrested for the murder of his brother, Jimmy. Jimmy, known to be
unstable, had gone on a ten-hour drinking spree and threatened to kill
Beth Johnson’s lover, Gabriel. How it ended up that Jimmy was the one
who got shot, was anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>And guess was what the villagers most liked to do.</p>
<p>As the weeks passed, more details emerged. Frank Johnson pleaded not
guilty to the dual charges of murder or manslaughter and was released on
bail while he awaited trial. He and his wife kept to themselves in the
intervening months, never seen in the village, although Frank could be
spied on his tractor from time to time. Stories kept appearing in the
press. Every paper, be it broadsheet or tabloid, wanted a piece of
Gabriel Wolfe’s fall from grace. A former pupil at the Immaculate
Conception Convent told The Daily Telegraph about the licentious love
affair which began when Gabriel and Beth were teenagers. The Mirror ran
a piece about their open-air “sexploits” alongside a photograph of the
lake at Meadowlands. Neither Beth Johnson nor Gabriel Wolfe was
available for comment.</p>
<p>As the date for the murder trial drew closer, the villagers were
buzzing with excitement. It would be at the Central Criminal Court, in
London, and many of them planned to go along and watch. Frank Johnson in
the dock, Gabriel Wolfe called to testify as a witness; it was their
very own Hemston soap opera.</p>
<p>Days before the trial was due to begin came a further shock.</p>
<p>Frank Johnson had broken his bail conditions and was now awaiting
trial in Wandsworth Prison.</p>
