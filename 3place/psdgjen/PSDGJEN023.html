<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>In the morning, I watch Gabriel dressing for his lecture, throwing on
the clothes he discarded yesterday: corduroy trousers, a black jumper
with several of my long dark hairs clinging to it, a tweed jacket on
top.</p>
<p>“See?” he says, holding out a hair between his thumb and forefinger.
“I miss these.”</p>
<p>At the door he turns back for one more kiss, runs his hands over my
body beneath the sheets. “It’s torture leaving you. I will not be
thinking about Sir Gawain for the next sixty minutes, that’s for
sure.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you skip it? Just this once?”</p>
<p>He holds out several pages of lined paper, covered in his
handwriting. “It’s my paper this week, unfortunately. Don’t move, I
won’t be long.”</p>
<p>After he’s gone, I put on one of his shirts and boil the kettle on
the little camping stove Gabriel brought with him from Meadowlands. All
those mornings by the lake when he brewed coffee and cooked scrambled
eggs and bacon, it seems a lifetime ago.</p>
<p>I take a cup of tea to Gabriel’s desk with its view of the gardens
below. I watch a boy cutting across the lawn, disheveled, harried, late
for his nine o’clock lecture, perhaps. Next year, so long as I don’t
mess up my A levels, it will be me. I revel in the fantasy for a few
minutes while I drink my tea. I’ll be in my college room at St Anne’s,
but Gabriel will have his own lodgings by then. I picture us cooking
exotic feasts of beef Stroganoff or coq au vin in the evenings for our
friends, whom I imagine as a broader mix than the people I met last
night. Poets and scientists and art historians and musicians. Boys and
girls from grammar and comprehensive schools who have worked so hard to
get here.</p>
<p>His mother was right. I am more comfortable with my own kind. In my
own way I can be just as elitist.</p>
<p>A green notebook catches my eye and I reach for it almost without
thinking. I’m about to open it when I realize what I’m doing: This is
probably Gabriel’s novel, the novel Louisa has been allowed to read.</p>
<p>I understand, utterly, the horror of letting someone read your work
before it’s ready. And also, how it will never be ready unless you put
it out there, risking humiliation and failure. Reading someone else’s
writing is like having direct access to his innermost thoughts. And he
chose to reveal that to Louisa, not me.</p>
<p>As soon as I open it I realize this is not Gabriel’s novel. It’s his
diary.</p>
<p>September 25</p>
<p>Missing Beth like an illness, I feel sick with it. There’s no one
like her here.</p>
<p>September 30</p>
<p>How is it possible to be with someone every day for a whole summer
and then never see them? I feel like a part of me is missing. We used to
say we shared a brain. Well, half my brain is gone.</p>
<p>I slam the notebook shut. Reading another person’s diary is the worst
kind of deceit, the lowest, the ugliest. I will not allow myself to do
it. Minutes pass, and the temptation to look again burns in my throat.
It’s no good: I cannot resist. This is how Adam must have felt biting
into his apple. One minute there’s purity and innocence, the next I am
fully immersed in a world I wish I had never entered.</p>
<p>The mentions of me start to dwindle as the weeks pass and are
replaced more and more by Louisa, or rather, “L.” There are other names
too: Richard, Claudia, Nigel, Imogen. Talk of good lectures and
indifferent ones, parties and concerts and nights in the pub. Weekend
house parties staying, no doubt, at the grand country houses belonging
to his friends. I begin to flip the pages, searching only for the name
that sears and, sure enough, in the last two weeks, I find what I am
looking for.</p>
<p>In late October, Gabriel writes:</p>
<p>Stayed up late talking to L. I told her everything, all the doubts
I’ve been having, how guilty I feel. She was wonderful, as always, don’t
know what I’d do without her. God, I feel so terrible about this, she
ended up spending the night with me. I had to smuggle her out through
the back door this morning, I can only pray no one saw her and Beth
won’t find out.</p>
<p>Then, fatally, an entry four days ago.</p>
<p>Louisa is in love with me. What am I going to do? Beth arrives in
three days for her interview. My life is a mess.</p>
<p>How could he have made love to me in the way he did when he had these
feelings for her? And these doubts about me? I picture Louisa at the
party, the joy in her face when Gabriel came to join us. The way she put
her hand to his chest. Unconscious. Intimate. Knowing. As if she had
touched him before. And I see Gabriel, reddening as I watched him, the
guilty flush of a betrayer.</p>
<p>I read the entries again. The words seem like incontrovertible
evidence now.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this, it’s too big to comprehend. Gabriel and
Louisa. Louisa and Gabriel. She loves him. He slept with her. How could
I have been so blind, so foolish? And why did I open his diary? Even
now, with my world crashing around me, I wish I could turn back the
clock to the ignorance of a moment ago.</p>
<p>I walk around his room, unsure what to do with myself. To Gabriel and
Louisa I’m just some stupid schoolgirl he once had feelings for and they
are counting down the time until I go away again.</p>
<p>I spy a pale pink scarf balled up in the corner. I pick it up, inhale
its overpowering flowery scent and throw it to the ground.</p>
<p>It takes no time at all to dress in my own clothes, hurling the
offensive spotty dress in my bag. I pause at Gabriel’s desk before I
leave, heart racing while I consider what to write.</p>
<p>It’s over, Gabriel.</p>
<p>I can’t see you anymore.</p>
<p>You know why.</p>
<p>Beth</p>
<p>My bus has not yet arrived at the station. There’s a cluster of
people waiting and I stand amid them, arms wrapped around myself, in
shock. My breathing is too loud, too gaspy, and I feel as though I am
fighting for air. Gabriel and Louisa. A perfect coupling. They will look
so good together. Everything I dreaded has come true, as if I wished it
into existence.</p>
<p>And then, Gabriel is here, running into the station, frantic.</p>
<p>“What’s happened?” he says, when he reaches me. He pulls me into his
arms and, for a moment, a blissful, forgotten moment where everything is
still as it was, I weep against him, my face pressed to the hard muscles
of his chest, his smell—lemons and cedar and cigarette smoke—so
intensely familiar and no longer mine.</p>
<p>I jerk myself away. “I know about Louisa,” I say.</p>
<p>His face betrays nothing. “What about her?”</p>
<p>“She loves you. You slept with her. I read your diary, Gabriel. Don’t
bother denying it.”</p>
<p>“You read my diary? How could you—?” Gabriel is shouting so loudly
people turn around. Fury in his eyes I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>“I’m glad I did. Because you would never have had the guts to tell
me. What were you going to do, string us both along? Your mother warned
me about you. She said you use people, and move on when you get bored of
them. She warned me you would tire of me as soon as you got to Oxford. I
should have listened to her.”</p>
<p>It’s the worst thing I could have said.</p>
<p>His anger switches into something else: coldness, a look of such
intense dislike—of me, of her?</p>
<p>“Gabriel,” I say, pleading, knowing I’ve gone too far but he turns
his face away. He can’t bear to look at me.</p>
<p>My bus arrives, people get on, the engine starts up. The conductor
leans out of the door. “Are you coming, love?”</p>
<p>I look at Gabriel, hoping he’ll say something to stop me, hoping
there’s a way of this not being our end.</p>
<p>“You should go,” he says, and still he doesn’t look at me. “You’re
right. This is finished.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Heartbreak is commonplace—a young girl in a tempest of crying
surprises no one—but there is concern on every single face as I get on
the bus.</p>
<p>“Let’s get you safely home, darling,” the conductor says.</p>
<p>I do look at Gabriel as the bus leaves the station. His face is
expressionless, but I know from the hard set of his mouth, from the
fingers that creep beneath his eyes, he is crying too.</p>
<p>It is the last time I will see him for a very long time.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
