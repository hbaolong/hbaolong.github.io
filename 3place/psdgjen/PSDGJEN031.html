<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>We have a farm boy who wants nothing more than to be outside from
dawn to dusk with his parents, his uncle, his grandpa. The glory of
these first five years, did I appreciate it enough? Listening to Frank
and Bobby crossing the yard to the dairy each morning, our son’s
ceaseless, high-pitched chatter. The men back again for a cooked
breakfast, Bobby sitting next to his grandpa, raised up on cushions,
still talking. He and I weeding, the endless weeding. Bobby’s expert
detection for rogue plants, small hands that clasp and tug at roots
until there is a great pile beside him. Rewarding ourselves with hot
chocolate before we venture out again. Sometimes sitting on the iron
gate at the bottom of the sheep field while the valley echoes with ewes
calling for their lambs and the air hums with insects, a breeze whipping
our skin. Drinking it all in, like Frank once did, and David and his dad
before him; my boy reaching back to his ancestors through these lumpy
green fields, to the sounds and sights, the taste, the touch of a
thousand years.</p>
<p>Already Bobby is turning out to be his own person. He can sometimes
drive me mad, refusing to come in when he’s called. I have a little
handbell I ring when he’s out playing in the garden—or at least that’s
where he’s supposed to be—and I’ll ring it for several minutes before I
accept he’s wandered off to find Frank or David. I can never stay cross
with him for long, none of us can; one disarming grin from Bobby and all
is forgiven.</p>
<hr />
<p>All too soon Bobby begins at the primary school. He looks like
someone else’s child in his shirt and tie, his shiny lace-up shoes.</p>
<p>“I look really weird,” he says, inspecting himself in the bathroom
mirror as he cleans his teeth.</p>
<p>“Smart, not weird.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” He looks unsure. “If you say so.”</p>
<p>At the school, my son’s confidence amazes me. Most of the new
kindergarten children are clinging to their mothers, but Bobby saunters
toward his classroom without a backward glance. At the last moment he
remembers me, sprinting back to whisper in my ear, “Will you be all
right without me?”</p>
<p>No, Bobby. Let’s go home. We’ll try this another day, I manage not to
say.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. You go and have some fun.”</p>
<p>With Bobby gone during the day, I throw myself into working on the
farm. David shows me all the things his sons absorbed from childhood. I
learn to spot the early signs of mastitis in a heifer, where to look for
abscesses in sheep, how to examine their eyes, hooves, the quality of
their wool. I can press my hands to their bellies and haunches and know
if they need a better grade of grass, if they are fat enough to be taken
to market. I learn how to roll fields with the roller looped up to the
tractor. David even teaches me to drive the combine harvester. There is
something cocoon-like about being high up in the cab, the panorama of
our fields stretched before us. I used to love spending time in the
combine with Frank, traveling up and down the cornfields at its
leisurely, unhurried pace. There was an intimacy, an aloneness that
could be hard to find in the farmhouse, and we talked about everything
in those long stretches while we reaped and threshed the family corn. I
sometimes say, because it makes Frank laugh, we fell in love in a
combine harvester.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s for reasons of intimacy—the two of us looking straight
ahead rather than at each other—when David asks: “Will you be having
another little one soon? What with Bobby at school.”</p>
<p>I’m taken aback by the question. It is by far the most personal thing
my father-in-law has ever asked me. “Are you trying to get rid of me
already, David?” I say, teasing him.</p>
<p>He nods and says no more about it. Fair enough, the nod says. It’s
your business, not mine.</p>
<p>It’s not that I haven’t thought about it. Part of me craves a
newborn, that blissful, insular vacuum, coexistence in a sleep-deprived
parallel universe, as closely connected as you were when the tiny
creature was in your womb. The scent of them, the shape of them, the
warm weight cradled in your arms, the delicate sound of their breathing.
Second time around it would be different, of course. Now there is Bobby,
who expects my full attention when he gets home from school. I picture
myself nursing a baby, trapped in my chair for forty-five minutes while
Bobby grows more and more impatient waiting for me to finish. But then,
the baby needs changing. And now he is crying, and I must walk him up
and down, soothing him, no option but to neglect my elder child. I feel
Bobby’s shock and disappointment that his mother, who has walked each
step of the last five years with him, is no longer available for his
every whim, even for a few of them. And then his resignation as he
accepts the new order of things. The way Bobby would change, the gradual
loosening of the bond between us. I’m not ready for that.</p>
<p>Several days later, it’s apparent Frank has been talking to David. He
gets into bed and asks: “Is your diaphragm in?”</p>
<p>The fact of his asking is unusual.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>We have sex most nights, almost without exception. Frank says it
clears his head of the day and helps him get to sleep. For me it’s when
I feel most connected to Frank, a closeness that is hard to find at any
other time of day.</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking we could stop using it. Only if you wanted to.”</p>
<p>“You’ve been talking to your dad, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“Do you want us to start trying for a baby?”</p>
<p>“It would be nice, wouldn’t it? A brother or sister for Bobby.”</p>
<p>“It would. It really would.”</p>
<p>I think I have injected the right amount of enthusiasm into my voice
but I can never fool Frank.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you want to?”</p>
<p>I pause for a moment, trying to find the words to help him
understand.</p>
<p>“I know it feels like the right time. But I’m not ready to cut ties
with Bobby just yet. I’m sure I will be one day, but we’re still so
young, you and I. And it’s different for mothers, so full-time and
unrelenting. I wouldn’t be able to be with him in the way I am now. Does
that make sense?”</p>
<p>This is the thing about Frank: He always gets it. He reaches out an
arm and pulls me toward him until my face is pressed against his chest.
“Perfect sense. We got the best one. Why risk it with another?”</p>
<p>It’s different the way we make love tonight. For a start we never
break eye contact, not once. Frank presses himself very deeply inside me
and he stays there, not moving, looking down at me, and I feel so turned
on by him, running my hands up and down his chest, feeling the hardness
of muscle under skin, his broadness, his strength, the heft of him and,
also, how much I love him. When he finally starts to move in slow, deep
circles, each one draws a gasp of pleasure from my throat, even though
we always try to be quiet with the rest of the family just across the
corridor. But I’m too taken to stop, my whole body starts to spiral and
shake and I’m gripping on to him, crying his name, and he’s whispering
in the darkness, “It’s OK,” and it feels violent and tender and like
nothing on earth. And then Frank is moving hard and fast now, his
breathing hectic and broken, but he still keeps looking at me, as he
comes, as I do, and then, instantly, we are holding each other, laughing
and laughing at the intensity, the raw madness of it.</p>
<p>Frank whispers: “Christ. What was that?”</p>
<p>And I’m half crying, half laughing, when I whisper back: “I
know.”</p>
<p>We ease into our sleeping positions, his arm wrapped around me, and
his voice is already slippery with drowsiness. “Why would we want to
change a thing?”</p>
