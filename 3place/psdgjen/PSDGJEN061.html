<h4 id="section">1975</h4>
<p>Grace is weaving down Top Field with two ewes and a cluster of
newborn lambs. She knows how to tack back and forth across our field in
a slow zigzag, making sure her babies walk in the right direction. She
knows when to stop and wait so the lambs stay close to their mothers.
She chats to them incessantly, just like her uncle used to, and her
brother, Bobby. She is five years old.</p>
<p>One of these lambs is more special to Grace than the others because
yesterday she birthed it by herself. When its legs began to appear she
knelt beside the ewe, grabbed the ankles in her small hands, and tugged,
waiting for each contraction to ease it out a little farther each
time.</p>
<p>“Pull hard now, Gracie. Give it everything you’ve got,” my father
said, when the lamb’s little black nose first appeared.</p>
<p>I knew he was fighting the urge to help her. I was too.</p>
<p>Grace yanked hard, grunting like a heavyweight wrestler, and at last
the lamb slithered free. I wish I’d had a camera on me. Her face. I wish
Frank could have seen it, the mixture of pride and awe when she turned
to grin at me and made a thumbs-up sign.</p>
<p>She was born, not on the kitchen floor like her brother, but at
Dorchester Hospital, eight months after the trial finished. I waited
until the risks of early miscarriage had passed before I told Frank I
was expecting his baby. I knew how much it would mean to him, another
child, his own flesh and blood this time.</p>
<p>“Guess what?” I said, the next time he phoned. “I’m pregnant.
Thirteen weeks yesterday. We’re having a baby, Frank.”</p>
<p>In the short silence before he spoke, I pictured him in the prison
telephone box, fighting his emotion. I heard his rapid breaths, the
croakiness of his voice when he spoke.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I threw my diaphragm away, a few months before the trial. I didn’t
want to tell you in case it didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>“We’re having a baby? You’re pregnant? We are going to have another
child?”</p>
<p>Frank was shouting now. Shouting and laughing. Repeating my news
until it had sunk in.</p>
<p>Remembering the joy in his voice when I told him consoles me on the
loneliest nights.</p>
<p>When I first saw our daughter, I felt such a rush of elation. She had
been born at exactly the right time to be a woman.</p>
<p>“For you,” I whispered to the tiny baby at my breast, “the world is
changing.”</p>
<p>You have a daughter, I wrote to Frank that same afternoon. She’s the
most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. Will you choose her name?</p>
<p>His reply came by return of post. Let’s call her Grace.</p>
<p>I thought, Yes, Frank gets it. She is our second grace. She is our
new beginning.</p>
<p>I hoped Frank would let me visit him in prison once our daughter had
been born. But, every time I asked him, he said no.</p>
<p>“Please, Beth, let me get this done in my own way.”</p>
<p>I railed at him sometimes. “Why is it all about what you need? What
about me? What about me needing to see you?” I shouted, flaring up on
one of our weekly Sunday-night phone calls. “You’re ashamed for me to
see you in there? You’d rather go years without seeing your wife or
being able to hold your child in your arms because you’re ashamed of
what I might think? Then I’m ashamed you think so little of me.”</p>
<p>I hung up on Frank before he could answer and was filled with remorse
for the rest of the night. I’d wasted our phone call. And, worse, I’d
upset him. And now I had to wait a whole week before I could talk to him
again.</p>
<p>Two days later, his letter arrived.</p>
<p>Dear Beth,</p>
<p>I have this picture in my head and it’s the thing that sustains me,
every single day. I imagine myself coming back to the farm one bright,
spring afternoon. A cold, crisp, sunny day, the kind of weather that has
always been our favorite. There are new lambs in the field and all
Bobby’s favorite birds are back for the summer chittering away, making a
racket.</p>
<p>I step onto our land and breathe it all in. I’m home, I say to
myself. I’m home. That’s when I see you with Grace, for the very first
time… and it feels so pure, Beth. I don’t want this place in your head
or hers. I know I’m being selfish. Please try to understand—?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>My father visits Frank every month to keep him updated on the
farm.</p>
<p>When Frank was sentenced to eight years in Wandsworth Prison, both my
parents resigned instantly from their teaching posts in Ireland. Within
three months they were back in Dorset helping me manage the farm.</p>
<p>It has been joyous seeing the way the farm has changed them. And how
they have changed the farm. My mother, whom I couldn’t have imagined
without her books and her marking, is out with us in the fields all day.
She lives in an old pair of my father’s cords and has a permanent
outdoor tan. She looks years younger.</p>
<p>My mother found an old handwritten recipe for cheddar muddled in
among the farm accounts. She spent months perfecting her version of
Blakely Cheddar and then she began selling it at the local Saturday
market. The cheese is sharp and salty but creamy, and distinctive in its
purple wax coating; every week it sold out within an hour. Now we’ve
converted a shed into a cheese dairy, invested in new machinery, and the
cheese sells throughout the country. This tiny experiment has become our
staple income.</p>
<p>My father likes to save up problems for his visit to Frank. When
something baffles us—usually a piece of equipment breaking down—he
always says: “No matter, Frank will know how to fix it. I’ll pop up and
see him, shall I?” In this way, he tries to keep Frank engaged with our
life at the farm.</p>
<p>Aside from my dad, the people who have visited Frank in prison most
often are Gabriel and Leo.</p>
<p>It took a long time before Gabriel was able to talk to me again, and
I understood it.</p>
<p>He turned up at the farm, out of the blue, one afternoon.</p>
<p>My father answered the door and came back into the kitchen, his face
full of meaning. “It’s Gabriel,” he said.</p>
<p>I went out into the yard to talk to him, shutting the front door
behind me. At first, we just stood there, watching one another. It was
the first time I’d seen him in months.</p>
<p>“I need to ask you something,” he said, eventually. “But you won’t
like it.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’d like to tell Leo that Bobby was his brother. I think it might
help him process what happened if he understood why Frank did what he
did. The worst thing for Leo is knowing Frank is in prison when he feels
it should be him.”</p>
<p>Ours was a complicated tale with many pieces to fit together. All of
us were to blame in some way—Gabriel and me, Frank, Leo, and Jimmy too.
Everyone played a part in the tragedy.</p>
<p>And everything was about Bobby, really, when you dug deep enough.</p>
<p>Gabriel and Leo visited Frank every week and for a whole hour they
would talk about Bobby. It hurt Frank to begin with, spending time with
the man who had briefly stolen his wife. Recounting memories of days on
the farm with Bobby. Telling Leo exactly what had happened on the day of
the accident. And why he felt responsible. But slowly, he began to look
forward to it. Slowly, he began to heal. And Leo finally understood what
had driven Frank to make his noble, foolish gesture. Saving Leo was
really a way of saving himself.</p>
<p>One Sunday on our phone call, Frank said: “I’m ready to let him
go.”</p>
<p>He could have been talking about Jimmy, but I knew he wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Aah,” I said, though it was more an outlet of emotion than an actual
word. Sadness or gladness, both probably.</p>
<p>That night, I began to write a poem for Frank, the first time since
Bobby died I’d felt the urge to put pen to paper. I thought it was going
to be about Grace and our new beginning, but it wasn’t, in the end.</p>
<p>Gabriel’s novel came out a year after the trial; I thought it a
rather sad book. There was nothing of him and me in it, the girl and boy
we had been when he first had the idea, but it was tinged right the way
through with yearning and regret, a quest for second chances. That did
belong to us. I worried the adverse publicity around our affair would
affect his career, but it didn’t turn out like that at all. Scandal and
notoriety are good for book sales, it seems.</p>
<p>Gabriel and Leo are living in California now. Leo is at an American
high school. He writes me postcards about baseball and burgers, and he
sent Grace an LA Dodgers T-shirt for Christmas. She refuses to take it
off. Leo is seventeen now and from the occasional photos Gabriel
remembers to send, every bit as handsome as his father was when I first
met him.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I’m out walking with Grace, we pass by Meadowlands on
our way to the woods. There’s a spot in the road where you can see
through the trees and have an almost perfect view of the lake. I stand
there for a moment remembering the girl and boy who once fell so
passionately in love. They don’t feel like Gabriel and me anymore. Their
innocence as they swam among the water lilies and brewed coffee on a
camping stove believing themselves creatures of great fortune is too
poignant, and I cannot contemplate them for long.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, Leo made a noble gesture of his own: He went to
visit Nina. He didn’t ask our permission for the tale he told her,
although he did swear her to secrecy before he began. No one needs Frank
facing a new sentence for perjury.</p>
<p>I was in the yard hosing down my wellies when Nina turned up. I
watched in amazement as she got out of her car, even more astonished
when she stood up and I saw her swollen belly. She was seven months
pregnant. I’d heard tell of the new man Nina had met in the Compasses
one night—an accountant of all things, with an office in Salisbury.</p>
<p>“I know,” Nina said.</p>
<p>I didn’t need to ask her what she knew: Her face said it all.</p>
<p>“Frank’s story never made any sense. I’m sorry I hated you.”</p>
<p>“You were right to.”</p>
<p>We embraced for a long time, both of us crying.</p>
<p>Nina had a little girl. And although her daughter belongs to another
man, not Jimmy, I can’t help but feel there’s a symmetry to that. Too
much has happened for Nina and I to ever recover a friendship but, who
knows, perhaps our daughters will become friends one day. Jimmy would
like that, wherever he is. Bobby too. He always did adore Nina.</p>
<p>Grace is halfway down the field now, murmuring to her ewes just as
Bobby did and her uncle, Jimmy. I once told Grace her brother used to
have names for all the sheep, so she does the same thing. Bugs Bunny.
Madame Butterfly. Mavis. I hear her gently chastising Mavis for taking
too long. “Would you have us wait all day, Mavis?”</p>
<p>Beyond Grace I catch a flash of navy blue. A man has arrived at the
bottom of our field. I watch him place a hand onto the fence and hoist
himself over in one go, swift and effortless. Frank looks tall and
strong in the wedding suit, walking in his own land, home to me, to
Grace, to the start of another day. I knew he was coming out soon, but
not this soon. He always did say he wanted to surprise us.</p>
<p>“Do you see that man walking up the field?” I call to Grace, and she
stops to look.</p>
<p>Shields her eyes like Little Bo-Peep. “Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell?”</p>
<p>She has a photograph of Frank on her bedroom wall. She always wishes
him good night, the last thing she does before she falls asleep.</p>
<p>She pauses for a second or two, assessing the man walking up the
field toward us. Then she screams, “Daddy!” and she begins to run, her
sheep abandoned.</p>
<p>I watch her racing down the field, elbows pumping. She is wearing
pink shorts and red wellies and her hair trails behind her in a dark
cloud. I watch Frank as he opens his arms, as she flies into them. As he
swoops her up and spins her around. I can hear them laughing. I watch as
Frank throws his head back and yells at the gray clouds passing
overhead. “I am home. I AM HOME.” As Grace tries it, resting her neck
against her father’s shoulder, face upturned to the sky. “I AM HOME. I
AM HOME.” As they laugh and yell and laugh some more, this father and
daughter who are meeting for the first time. Then they turn to me. Frank
stretches out his right arm and Grace, cottoning on instantly, holds out
her left. A giant man and girl scarecrow.</p>
<p>I glance at my father, who is standing by the tap, pretending to fill
a bucket of water for the sheep, but really, openly gazing. He is crying
as he watches them, but he’s always been like that, my dad. These are
joyful tears.</p>
<p>“Run, my darling,” he says to me. “Run.”</p>
<p>Frank stays rooted to the spot, arms wide open, waiting. Thinner than
I’m used to, and older, but still Frank.</p>
<p>“Run, Mama,” my girl shouts, still laughing.</p>
<p>So, I do.</p>
<p>For Frank, Love Beth</p>
<p>If the man could hear me, I would tell him this:</p>
<p>It was instant, Dad</p>
<p>It was instant.</p>
<p>No pain</p>
<p>The sorrow was all your own.</p>
<p>Enough now.</p>
<p>I would tell him that.</p>
<p>Lives should be measured in intensity.</p>
<p>Remember mine</p>
<p>For its glory-stretch of furious light and wondrous beauty.</p>
<p>The world we love-lived</p>
<p>Is earth</p>
<p>Is dust</p>
<p>Is me, Dad.</p>
