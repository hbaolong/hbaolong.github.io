<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>At the end of the summer holidays, when Bobby is nine, we invite the
whole of his class for an afternoon at Blakely Farm. Bobby is in charge
of events and he plans it like a military operation: First the children
will meet his favorite animals, before a picnic tea beneath the oak
tree, and then target shooting.</p>
<p>We begin with a tour of the farm. Bobby shows the kids how the
milking machine works, demonstrating how he fits the teats to the cow’s
udders, how it is suction that keeps them on. He can do it in seconds,
just like the men.</p>
<p>In the sheep field, Bobby hands out biscuits so the children can feed
our ewes.</p>
<p>“Wow, Bobby,” says Hazel, a gorgeously pretty child with bright blond
Rapunzel plaits. “Are you allowed to do this every single day? You are
so lucky.”</p>
<p>This was a good idea, I think, as we begin our picnic beneath the old
oak tree. The children are getting to see Bobby for who he really is. I
know, because the teachers tell me, that Bobby spends his classroom
hours gazing out of the window, like a prisoner who pines for the
outside world, missing the sensation of sunlight warming his skin. Well,
he does pine. Being inside is a torture to him.</p>
<p>One time, he let himself out of the playground at break time and
arrived home in the middle of the day. I was about to take him back when
Frank stopped me.</p>
<p>“Let him have this just this once,” he said. “What good is school to
him, really? Everything he needs is here.”</p>
<p>Frank was exactly the same as a boy, Jimmy too. They are men of the
earth.</p>
<p>The oak tree has more meaning for us than any other on the farm. It
is where Frank asked me to marry him. Not on bended knee or with a ring
or champagne. He said, simply: “I don’t want a life without you in it. I
never did.”</p>
<p>I could tell from the way he was looking at me, in a blaze of love,
he meant something significant by the words.</p>
<p>“Frank. What are you saying?”</p>
<p>He picked me up and carried me around the oak tree, as if we were
performing some bizarre pagan ritual. “To marry me, you silly woman.
Wasn’t it obvious?”</p>
<p>While the children eat, I find myself watching a boy called William.
I know William, of course. There are only twelve in the class and the
children have been together for four years now. William’s homelife must
be lonely. A strict, older father, a timid, devoutly Christian mother,
neither of whom seem to have much time for William and none for the
other parents at school. William is never invited to the other
children’s houses and, as far as I know, none of them have ever visited
him at home either.</p>
<p>More than anything, it’s his clothes that set William apart. In his
smart white shirt, corduroy shorts, and Fair Isle pullover he looks like
a wartime child, one of the evacuees you saw in photographs sitting
disconsolately on their suitcases, clutching a stuffed toy. William is
wearing a felt trilby and he cannot stop playing with it. He picks it up
in one hand and twirls it on a finger, he throws it in the air and
catches it, before putting it back on his head. The hat is a statement
of some kind, perhaps his attempt to stand out, but the other children
don’t seem to notice. There’s something rather sad about William.</p>
<p>Finally, with tea cleared away, it is time for the target shooting.
All the children are excited about it, even the girls, who I imagined
might be bored at the idea of firing guns. We line them up in front of
two hand-painted targets: red, white, and blue rings with a small black
bull’s-eye at the center.</p>
<p>David demonstrates how to hold the air rifle, wedging it into his
armpit, so the weight of the gun rests on his chest. “It’s heavy,” he
says. “You need to get used to it before you start looking through the
sights. Take your time, there’s no rush. Everyone will get a turn.”</p>
<p>He is stern as he talks to them about gun safety and the rules which
must be obeyed before a shot is taken.</p>
<p>“Is your pathway clear? Look left to right and behind you to make
sure no one is in the way. Always wait for the word ‘clear’ before you
fire. Do you understand?” The children stare at him, transfixed. Yes,
they say, nodding their heads. Outlining the risks simply feeds their
excitement.</p>
<p>David stands beside each shooter, stamping out any silliness before
it can begin. Jimmy and Frank are the reloaders, taking each gun as soon
as it has been fired and slotting in the next pellet. The boys can hold
the guns themselves and most of them hit or get close to the bull’s-eye;
with the girls, Frank and Jimmy hold the gun in position, while they get
used to the sights, fingers on the trigger, David’s sharp “Clear!” like
a shot of adrenaline.</p>
<p>It is when William comes up for his turn that the atmosphere changes.
William, I realize too late, is an attention seeker. He stands beside
David, squirming and jiggling on the spot, swiveling to grin at the kids
behind him.</p>
<p>“Keep still,” David snaps. “Or you won’t see the target.”</p>
<p>I sense it, before it happens. Something repressed in the child, a
simmering frustration. He lines up his shot, David shouts “Clear!” and,
like a nightmare, William spins a half circle, pointing the gun at the
other children, who freeze in shock as he yells: “Take that,
suckers!”</p>
<p>David smacks the rifle from his hand with such force it smashes onto
William’s sandaled foot and he howls in pain.</p>
<p>David yells, “What were you thinking, you bloody little fool?” and
William bursts into tears. There’s something odd about his crying, even
then. He’s shocked, embarrassed, his toe is probably bruised and
possibly broken, but the way he cries, a tearless, earsplitting wail,
feels put on. I catch the bemused glance that passes between Jimmy and
Frank.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?” I say, crouching down
to examine William’s foot.</p>
<p>His big toe is bright red, the nail already beginning to discolor—it
will bloom from maroon to black in no time.</p>
<p>“It was only a joke, it was meant to be funny,” William says, but
David snaps at him.</p>
<p>“Your finger was on the trigger. You could have killed someone. There
is nothing funny about murder.”</p>
<p>William buries his face in my chest and I force myself to put an arm
around him as we walk back to the farmhouse.</p>
<p>Alison, William’s mother, is waiting in the yard with the other
parents. As soon as he sees her, William starts up with the deafening
wail, his limp exaggerated.</p>
<p>“Stop that!” Alison says to him. And then to me: “What’s wrong with
William’s foot?”</p>
<p>“He’s bruised his toe—” I begin, but David steps out in front of me.
I hadn’t realized he was following so closely behind.</p>
<p>“I’ll explain, Beth. I’d like to get across the severity of what just
happened. Your son did something so unbelievably stupid and dangerous
this afternoon he could have killed someone. The kids were target
shooting with air rifles—heavily supervised, I might add, we were
rigorous in our safety instructions—but, somehow, William got it into
his head it would be funny to swing around and point his gun at the
other children. I knocked it out of his hand and that’s how he came to
bruise his toe. All I can say is we are very lucky the injury is such a
small one. It could have been so much worse.”</p>
<p>“William, shut up!” Alison snaps, silencing her son’s caterwauling in
a heartbeat. “Am I to understand the children were playing with guns at
the party?”</p>
<p>“Air rifles, Alison,” I say. “Target shooting. It was written on the
invitation.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person invites a class of nine-year-olds over to play
with guns?”</p>
<p>I see the other mothers watching intently, not sure which camp they
should belong to. They all knew about the shooting activity.</p>
<p>“What you really need to be asking yourself,” David says, “is what
kind of child, despite repeated instructions about safety, would turn
his gun on his classmates? Whether or not he intended to shoot, I didn’t
wait to find out.”</p>
<p>I notice how far apart Alison and William are standing, how she
hasn’t looked at him or tried to comfort him once, how he cowers as he
watches her. I thought she was meek and timid, but this woman is all
steel and cold, suppressed anger.</p>
<p>“I should never have let him come. You don’t take enough care.
Everyone knows what your family is like.”</p>
<p>“Do tell,” David says. “What are we like?”</p>
<p>“Reckless.” Alison spits the word out, a bad fairy come to ruin the
party. “Sooner or later something bad will happen and, when it does, it
will be your own fault.”</p>
