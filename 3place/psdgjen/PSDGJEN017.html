<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>Tessa Wolfe is astonishing to look at close-up. Her hair and eyes are
dark, like Gabriel’s, but her features are finer: a delicate nose, a
mouth that might be thin but is painted defiant scarlet, a slender neck
glistening with a band of diamonds that are almost certainly the real
thing. I’ve never been up close to beauty like this or, for that matter,
such extravagant jewelry, and it is all I can do not to stare.</p>
<p>She is also, according to Gabriel, well on her way to being
drunk.</p>
<p>“Just agree with her on everything and you’ll be fine,” he told me
when I arrived for a dinner I have been dreading since it was first
suggested.</p>
<p>“I’ve been dying to meet you,” Tessa says, gesturing to the chair
next to hers. “And Gabe has selfishly kept you to himself all summer
long.”</p>
<p>“Very wise, if you ask me,” Edward Wolfe says, winking as he shakes
my hand. He is instantly likable, and I wish I were sitting beside him
rather than next to Tessa on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>I have never seen such an ornately laid table, with its terrifying
number of glasses, knives, and forks. It feels excessive for a dinner
for four people and when the food is brought in by a girl from the
village, there are things I have never even heard of before. Smoked
salmon and beef Wellington, which turns out to be a whole fillet of beef
cooked in pastry and served almost raw in its middle. Rationing only
stopped last year and, aside from the introduction of sugar and a little
more meat, at home our diet has scarcely changed.</p>
<p>The serving girl, Sarah, is a couple of years older than me; we both
went to Hemston primary school. When she waits for me to help myself to
a slice of beef, I feel like a fraud.</p>
<p>“Hi, Sarah,” I say, softly. “How are you?”</p>
<p>But she simply nods an acknowledgment and looks away.</p>
<p>“I hear you’re applying to Oxford,” Edward says. “Good for you. Which
college?”</p>
<p>“St Anne’s, to read English.”</p>
<p>“Oh, one of the new colleges,” Tessa says.</p>
<p>“Actually St Anne’s has a wonderful reputation,” Edward says. “Of
course, in my day, there were no women at Oxford at all. I’m really
quite envious of Gabriel.”</p>
<p>“The other girls will probably have been to boarding school,” Tessa
continues. “I hope you won’t feel left out?”</p>
<p>“For goodness’ sake, Mother, don’t be such a snob,” Gabriel says, and
I see the vivid color in his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m an incorrigible snob, according to my son.”</p>
<p>Tessa says it with pride. And I catch something that explains her to
me, better than Gabriel has ever been able to. I don’t think she’s from
this world originally, much as she pretends otherwise. One she almost
walked out on but didn’t, that’s why it matters to her. It’s a
consolation prize, and she guards it closely.</p>
<p>I was expecting this evening to be tough, but I imagined Gabriel
would be on hand to rescue me. Instead, he strikes up a long
conversation with his father, leaving me to fend off Tessa’s intrusive
questions by myself. I sense Tessa Wolfe circling, hungry for something,
but I cannot tell what.</p>
<p>“Your parents both work, isn’t that right? I expect your mother feels
she rather missed out on your childhoods?”</p>
<p>“Not really. They teach, so we’ve always had the school holidays
together.”</p>
<p>“Where do you like to holiday as a family?”</p>
<p>It feels like some kind of test, this, and I don’t have the right
answer for it. She is looking for me to say the south of France or
wherever it is the fashionable people go. We spend our summers at home
and my parents fill them with day trips to the coast, visits to museums,
twice-weekly trips to the library, where we take out our full quota of
books. On rainy days we light a fire in the sitting room and all four of
us read and, when I think of it now, I can feel the quiet contentment of
those days.</p>
<p>Tessa doesn’t seem to notice my silence. She refills her glass and
fires off another question. “Tell me about you and Gabe. Do you love him
very much? No need to answer that, it’s all there in your eyes. And he’s
terribly fond of you, I do know that.”</p>
<p>In a low, confiding voice she says Gabriel is the kind of boy who
makes friends easily. “Trouble is, he can spread himself a bit thin
sometimes. Once he’s at Oxford I imagine he’ll be very taken up with his
social life.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be very taken up myself, studying for A levels.”</p>
<p>Tessa leans closer so our faces are only inches apart, I can smell
her intensely floral perfume and the wine on her breath.</p>
<p>She lowers her voice until it’s just above a whisper. “I think what
I’m trying to say—I hope it’s helpful—is that Gabriel tends to put
himself first. It’s why he makes such a success of things—he’s very
blinkered on what he wants. And then, quite suddenly, he can move on to
the next thing. I’ve seen it happen with friends of his. Probably my
fault for making him the center of my universe. I treated him like he
was God’s gift when he was a little boy. I still do.”</p>
<p>I console myself with the things Gabriel has told me about his
mother. That she’s a mean drunk, that she obsesses over his life because
she doesn’t like her own.</p>
<p>I see also Tessa doesn’t really know Gabriel, not the way I do. She
doesn’t know, for example, about his desire to write, the fear he will
never be good enough, of being railroaded into something he would hate,
like banking or law, the professions his mother has in mind for him.
Tessa has no idea Gabriel doesn’t want to inherit Meadowlands, that the
pressure of being an only child depresses him and he dreads being left
with the responsibility of looking after his mother when his father
dies.</p>
<p>“All right if we head off to the lake now?” Gabriel asks, breaking
off his conversation, not a moment too soon.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Edward says, half rising in his chair. “Wonderful to
meet you at last, Beth.”</p>
<p>“Let me help wash up first,” I say, thinking of Sarah in the kitchen,
guilty and embarrassed I’ve been eating the extravagant food while she’s
been waiting on me. I stand and begin to pile the plates, one on top of
the other, knives and forks moved to one side, but Tessa reaches out to
still my hand.</p>
<p>“We don’t stack here, we leave that to the school dinner ladies.”</p>
<p>I leave the room, with my eyes smarting, clutching a single plate
between my hands. Perhaps Gabriel didn’t hear, perhaps he finds it
easier to allow his mother’s put-downs to drift over his head. In my
chest, anger is rising.</p>
<p>In the far corner of the kitchen, Sarah is standing in front of the
butler’s sink, a pile of plates beside her. She doesn’t turn as I come
in.</p>
<p>I hesitate, wondering if I’ll make things worse by going over to talk
to her, but before I can decide Tessa comes in.</p>
<p>“You can leave the washing-up, thank you, Beth. Our girl is perfectly
capable, there’s really no need.” She lowers her voice to just above a
whisper. “Before you go, a quick word, if I may. You are being sensible
and using precautions, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I stare back at her, too horrified to speak. There’s no way Sarah
could hear across the other side of the room, but even so, I feel
mortified.</p>
<p>“No need to look like that, I’m quite unshockable. And most grateful
to you for keeping Gabe occupied all summer. He can get terribly bored
at home. I do hope you haven’t compromised yourself?”</p>
<p>I’m saved answering by Gabriel, who arrives in the kitchen and wishes
his mother good night.</p>
<p>Outside a fine rain is falling and the sky has turned electric blue,
with ribbons of light at its edges. One time, by the lake, we were
caught in a rainstorm. We kissed until our clothes were soaked through
and then we tore them off and danced and whirled and bathed ourselves in
the rain like weather gods. It is the freest I have ever felt.</p>
<p>“You’re very quiet. Was it awful?” Gabriel says, reaching for my
hand.</p>
<p>For a moment I don’t trust myself to speak. There are so many
emotions swirling in the pit of my stomach, it’s hard to know what I’m
feeling. Angry, humiliated, insecure. Wretched, ashamed. I don’t regret
a moment of the time I’ve spent with Gabriel or the things we have done,
but his mother was clever in the way she managed to plant a seed of
doubt in my head. What if she’s right? What if Tessa does know her son
far better than I do?</p>
<p>“Your mother made me feel so cheap, like some tart you’d picked up
for the summer.” The words burst out of me like poison. “Foolish for
considering Oxford. Arrogant for thinking you and I could be anything
more than a convenient fling.” There’s a weight of pressure in my chest,
tears I need to shed in the privacy of my own bedroom. I feel sudden,
aching loneliness. I don’t belong in this place with these people. “And
you abandoned me.”</p>
<p>Gabriel’s face is incredulous, then he seems amused. “It was only
dinner. Don’t you think you’re overreacting?”</p>
<p>There’s no way to control the rage as it spills out of me. “You don’t
understand. And why would you? Look at you.”</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>He sounds hurt, but it’s not enough to stop the outpouring of
thoughts I have hidden from everyone, especially myself. “Everything is
given to you on a plate, with a silver bloody spoon attached! No one
tells you you’re not good enough. Not rich enough. Not posh enough. You
get welcomed with open arms wherever you go. You can do whatever you
want. Sleep with whoever you want. And get applauded for it. You will
never be made to feel small or unworthy, never have to endure the
sneering I had from your mother this evening.”</p>
<p>“Can I say something?” Gabriel asks.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he says, and I burst into tears.</p>
<p>He puts his arms around me, presses my face to his chest. He smells
of laundry powder and soap and the aftershave he always wears. “You’re
right,” he says, pulling back a little so he can look into my face.</p>
<p>His eyes are shining too brightly; I see he is close to tears
himself.</p>
<p>“The truth is, I’m scared of her sometimes. She can be so cruel when
she wants to be. But I should have protected you. Forgive me?”</p>
<p>We kiss, his mouth warm on mine, his hands cupping the back of my
skull as he holds me to him. This is us, I think. Not the people we were
inside the house, but the boy and girl who have spent a whole summer
together, pledging their love beneath a hundred starry nights.</p>
