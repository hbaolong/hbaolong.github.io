<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>The society wedding everyone has been discussing for months takes
place on Bobby’s third birthday. While I am planning a small picnic
beneath the oak tree for our family, an army of vans are unloading their
contents at Meadowlands.</p>
<p>There is a running commentary on the decadence unfolding, a narrative
that is mostly bitter since none of the villagers have been invited. How
wasteful and extravagant are the hothouse flowers—rare blue orchids,
first reported by the cleaning lady, and denigrated at length in the
village shop. Twenty-four cases of champagne unloaded by the gardener,
something French-sounding, he’d said, he couldn’t remember what. The
marquees—not one, but two—positioned so they have a perfect view of the
lake, easily seen from the road. These tents are quite something, I am
told. Even Helen, who knows better than most how painful the subject
matter, how thin the ice upon which we skate, cannot resist
elaborating.</p>
<p>“They’ve covered them with strings of colored lights. Stunning—like
something out of Arabian Nights,” she says.</p>
<p>My heart does beat a little faster then.</p>
<p>Some of the villagers are employed in the run-up to the wedding—extra
cleaners, gardeners, laundry maids—and now there is a deluge of detail.
Three hundred guests invited, Hollywood stars rubbing shoulders with
English aristocracy, novelists, musicians, and politicians. There is
rumor of Elizabeth Taylor and Alec Guinness, Doris Lessing, the Duchess
of Argyll. Tessa Wolfe must be in her element. A wedding dress designed
by Norman Hartnell, pictures taken by society photographer Antony
Armstrong-Jones. A swing band flying in from the States. A chef from
Paris. The wedding of the year—it said so in Tatler.</p>
<p>Bobby wakes early on his birthday: It is half-light when I hear his
bare feet running along the floorboards and his small, soft body
squeezes in between us.</p>
<p>“I’m three,” he announces, and I know Frank is thinking the same
thing as me when he replies, “Three whole years of you? Wow.”</p>
<p>“And there was a storm that day,” Bobby says, his prompt for Frank to
tell the story of his birth.</p>
<p>He settles his head on his father’s chest and Frank curls an arm
around him.</p>
<p>“We don’t get many storms in the summer but when we do they tend to
be big. And this one was colossal. Trees came down, phone lines were
cut, people lost electricity. Your mum was all on her own. And the baby
was coming—”</p>
<p>Bobby’s favorite part is when his uncle Jimmy arrives home in his
school uniform and saves the day. Jimmy is Bobby’s hero. He believes
Jimmy saved his life. And maybe he did.</p>
<p>As it’s his birthday, Bobby is allowed to go milking with the men.
He’s too small to be much more than a hindrance but they always wait
patiently while he tries and fails to do what they do. Milking takes a
good while longer when Bobby is involved.</p>
<p>I listen to Frank helping Bobby dress in his room, sudden riotous
laughter when he puts both feet through one leg hole of his underpants,
the discussion about his navy overalls, which Helen made for him—an
exact copy of the ones David, Frank, and Jimmy wear.</p>
<p>“Not a baby anymore,” Bobby says.</p>
<p>“Clearly,” says Frank. “Better start pulling your weight.”</p>
<p>They clatter down the stairs and across the yard and I listen to
their fading chatter, luxuriating in both my aloneness and the fact they
are mine.</p>
<p>We will be celebrating Bobby’s birthday later today, after the second
milking. My parents and sister are coming, David, Jimmy, Frank, me, and
the birthday boy. No one else. I thought about asking Helen, who has a
son almost exactly the same age, but the truth is, I have insulated
myself within these thick walls of family and it is all I need. Bobby
seems content enough surrounded by grandparents and an aunt and uncle
who adore him. Why change it?</p>
<p>When Bobby gets back, we spend the rest of the morning preparing a
feast. The Wolfes’ guests may be dining on oysters and lobster tails,
but we have jam tarts and honey-roasted sausages and a pineapple
hedgehog with quills of cheddar. When we’ve finished icing the cake,
Bobby’s cheeks and nose are smeared in chocolate and I take a picture of
him, grinning at me, wild on sugar and excitement as we count down to
the main event.</p>
<p>There are still a couple of hours before we’ll gather for the picnic.
Although I’ve done my best to drown out the noise around Gabriel’s
wedding, I know to the last second when it is happening. I see three
o’clock arrive on the kitchen clock, think of Gabriel waiting in the
village church, his bride about to walk up the aisle with her father.
After fifteen minutes, I imagine them exchanging their vows, Gabriel
staring into Louisa’s eyes how once he looked into mine. I think about
my own wedding in the same church with only our families present, my
dress of imitation lace, Frank’s borrowed suit that was a couple of
inches too short. I wouldn’t change any of it, I love everything about
the new life I have built. But the temptation to look, one final time,
rises up in me until I can no longer suppress it.</p>
<p>“Want to go and spy on a wedding in the village, Bobby?”</p>
<p>“Like real spies?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We can hide behind one of the big trees in the graveyard.”</p>
<p>“In fact, I would.”</p>
<p>“In fact” is a big thing for Bobby: It’s a phrase he’s just
learned.</p>
<p>It’s only a five-minute walk to the village, ten at Bobby’s pace, but
I begin to worry we might have left it too late. And when we get there,
I see a line of photographers outside the church, both sides of the road
crowded with villagers waiting for a glimpse of the couple, jars of
homemade confetti at the ready.</p>
<p>“This is where we need to be proper spies so no one in the village
sees us. Think you can do that?”</p>
<p>Bobby puts a finger to his lips, already committing to stealth.</p>
<p>We enter the cemetery from the far side and dart from tree to tree,
shielding ourselves behind a tomb while I look for the best vantage
spot. When the church bells begin to ring, with an evocative,
celebratory peal, I grab Bobby’s hand and sprint for a yew tree wide
enough to accommodate us, close enough to see.</p>
<p>“Look,” Bobby hisses, when the bridegroom walks out in a top hat and
tails, pausing in the porch, his tiny bride clinging to his arm.</p>
<p>The official photographer rushes forward to take the first shot,
dapper in his narrow black suit, white shirt, and black tie. “If you
could look into each other’s eyes… oh, that’s it, absolutely spot-on.”
His chiseled upper-crust accent floats toward us.</p>
<p>The press photographers form a semicircle around the couple, clicking
frantically while Gabriel and Louisa wait and smile, knowing this is
part of the game. Their image will be in all the social pages
tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is years since I’ve seen Gabriel. He hasn’t changed. Tall and
elegant in his fine wedding clothes, a face that will always be more
beautiful than handsome. Looking at the two of them, I am filled with a
jealousy I have no right to feel.</p>
<p>I watch Bobby watching Gabriel. My son will never know this man, who
once meant so much to me. It’s unlikely he will ever see him again. He
certainly won’t think of him. Or remember the day we hid behind a tree
and played spies. It’s a moment, that’s all, when we are suspended in
time.</p>
<p>“What do you think of the bridegroom?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Is he a bit—fancy-pants?” Bobby says, shushing me when I laugh out
loud, though his dark eyes flash with humor.</p>
<p>“Fancy-pants” is what Frank calls Bobby when my mother has got him
ready for bed: hair parted and slicked by a wet comb, pajamas buttoned
to the top and tucked in, a face that gleams.</p>
<p>I watch as Louisa turns her head to say something to Gabriel. See how
he leans closer to hear her, how he kisses her cheek.</p>
<p>Louisa’s mother, Moira, who hasn’t aged a day since I last saw her,
comes out of the church now, holding the hand of a toddler dressed in
head-to-toe white—frilly shirt, knickerbockers, and tights. I’d heard
tell of Gabriel and Louisa’s son but it’s mesmerizing seeing him. I
watch as Moira lifts the child into Louisa’s arms, as Gabriel stoops to
kiss his forehead, as the photographers click away in a frenzy. There’s
been no judgment in the reporting of their choice to have a child before
they wed. I don’t know why I expected anything different. The rules
never did apply to people like Gabriel and Louisa.</p>
<p>Beside me, my little boy begins to wriggle impatiently, bored now. I
feel a rush of love for him: I have all I need right here.</p>
<p>I’m glad for them. They are three, we are three. There’s a pleasing
symmetry to that. Everything worked out for us both.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s it, then, Bobby,” I say, turning away.</p>
<p>“Yep,” he says, mimicking Frank. “It certainly is.”</p>
<p>He throws his hat up in the air, a flatcap like the ones the men
wear, a present from David, and catches it on the first attempt.</p>
<p>I pull him into me. “I know it’s your birthday and the presents are
all for you today, but can I say, you’re the best present I’ve ever
had.”</p>
