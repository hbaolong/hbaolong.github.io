<h4 id="before">Before</h4>
<p>Bobby is born on the kitchen floor in the midst of a storm. All day
the wind has been rattling the farmhouse windows so fiercely, at times I
wondered if they might be blown in.</p>
<p>In the final stages of pregnancy, my days were slow and I seemed to
achieve so little. Some half-hearted tidying, the leisurely preparation
of the family’s supper, chores which formerly took minutes could last
for hours.</p>
<p>When I first arrived at the farmhouse—a tired, unloved place that
housed three diffident men—I was shocked by the state of it, the state
of them. They needed me, all three of them, they just hadn’t realized
it. There was David, Frank’s dad, still aching from the loss of his
wife. David had done the best he could bringing up his sons without
Sonia, but his best was almost nothing. Frank learned to cook because
his dad couldn’t, and six months of cheese sandwiches began to wear
thin. He learned how to wash their clothes, he began supervising Jimmy’s
homework. He cleaned too, here and there, but when I first came I was
shocked by the ingrained grime—years of dust and cobwebs—he had not
noticed or cared about.</p>
<p>Domesticity was something I’d never expected to find satisfying. My
mother always hated cooking and cleaning when we were growing up, and
was fortunate to marry a man who loved her enough to do it instead. What
I have discovered is that the transformation of the farmhouse and the
men within it has been more rewarding than I would ever have imagined. I
thought I was predestined for a life of books: first university, then,
with any luck, a career as a poet. I haven’t given up on my dream of one
day being a writer, but Frank came along at exactly the right moment and
swept me into a new and unimagined world where every single day is a
different kind of education.</p>
<p>Turning down my place at Oxford hurt, not least because of the way it
disappointed my mother. But what choice did I have? Spend two years in
the same town as Gabriel and Louisa? Nothing on earth would have induced
me to swallow my pride and do that. Soon enough there was Frank, the
handsome, uncomplicated boy who had always loved me from afar.</p>
<p>If people were surprised I segued from one love affair to another
they did not say. For Frank and I, in a sense, had known each other
forever. I fell for him perhaps because he was the exact opposite of
Gabriel. I was drawn first by his kindness and his honesty, a more
straightforward man you could not meet. He gave me back my self-belief
with uncomplicated devotion.</p>
<p>Like most women I have a birth plan: The moment my waters break or I
feel the first twinge of pain, I will call my mother at her school. The
secretary has been alerted that no matter what my mother is doing she
must be interrupted. If she’s umpiring a netball match, the game stops.
If she’s taking an English class it is abandoned, and the pupils must
fend for themselves. The journey from her school to the farmhouse is
less than fifteen minutes; the hospital, were we to need it quickly,
half an hour away. First-time labors, I am told, can last for hours,
often a whole day or more, so there will be plenty of time to get to
hospital. I have learned the drill. I know how to time my contractions
so I can tell how much my cervix has dilated. In an ideal world, we
would sit out the first part of labor in the farmhouse and Frank would
drive us to hospital for the final hours.</p>
<p>My waters break at three o’clock in the afternoon when I stand up
from my chair with the intention of making a cup of tea. It’s the
strangest sensation. Not a bucket of liquid splashing onto the slate
floor, as I’d expected, but a trickle that alarms me initially until I
realize what it is. The first contraction comes, in textbook fashion,
almost immediately afterward.</p>
<p>It hurts a surprising amount for a first contraction. This is no
twinge. And, even worse, just as I’m recovering, realizing labor is not
going to be the cinch I’d hoped for, another one comes. That can’t be
right, can it? Contractions close together? I stagger to the phone—I
know the school telephone number off by heart—pick up the receiver,
phone to my ear… the line is dead, just a crackling sound. I scream into
the empty kitchen. How can this be? Only later will I discover a
telegraph pole has crashed to the ground in the storm, wiping out phone
lines for miles around us and, crucially, blocking the lane to the
farmhouse. We cannot get out and no one can get in.</p>
<p>To begin with, I manage to stay calm. I retreat to my armchair, legs
splayed in front of me, trying to breathe through the contractions, the
way I’ve been taught. Imagine you are blowing a table tennis ball across
a swimming pool. It’s an absurd phrase. I can picture neither a
Ping-Pong ball nor a swimming pool. And the pain is so intense I can
scarcely breathe, let alone master these long, gentle exhalations.</p>
<p>Fast labor leaves no room for thought or planning or even
comprehension. It takes you. Catapults you from one world to the next,
where you are simply a birthing machine, a screaming, writhing, sweating
mound of primal woman. I’m disconnected from it to such an extent that,
at first, I don’t realize the groans, the deep brittle lowing—I’ve heard
cows in labor, it’s the exact same thing—is me.</p>
<p>By the time Jimmy arrives home from school, I am on all fours in the
kitchen, sobbing, screaming, trying to prevent my body from doing what
it wants to do, which is push the baby out.</p>
<p>“Oh, my God, Beth!” He’s across the room in seconds. “Is it the
baby?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s the fucking baby.”</p>
<p>A word I’ve never used before, but it feels good. Just right.</p>
<p>“There’s a pole down, blocking the lane. No way we can get out. I’ll
go and find Frank.”</p>
<p>“No!” I scream it, a horrifying, bloodcurdling sound. Jimmy looks
terrified.</p>
<p>“The baby is coming. Help me.”</p>
<p>He becomes calm efficiency straightaway, this schoolboy who is an
almost exact copy of his brother. Jimmy, who has been monosyllabic and
closed off since the day I first met him. It is as if the urgency
switches something on in him.</p>
<p>“Right, right, got it,” he says, hurling his blazer across the
kitchen floor.</p>
<p>I’m wearing a tent dress, which is a good thing, but my underwear
will have to go. “Scissors, Jimmy. You’ll have to cut my pants off. I
can’t reach them.”</p>
<p>Crying, but also laughing, at the chronic absurdity of this.</p>
<p>He is back in what feels like one second with scissors and towels and
he snips off my underwear, the skirt of my dress flipped onto my back so
I am butt naked before him. He doesn’t care and nor do I. There’s no
time for that.</p>
<p>“Right,” he says, after he’s taken a look. “I can see the head.”</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>I scream again, in pain, in rage, in fear, but the scream is also the
start of my giving in to this immense pressure which feels as if my
insides are being squeezed with metal. There is nothing to do now except
push, and even the pain—no words for the intensity, like being ripped in
two, worse than that—feels good, helpful. My body has taken over.</p>
<p>“You’re doing really well,” Jimmy says in the soothing, professional
tone of a midwife. Later we will laugh about this. “And you don’t need
to worry. I’ve birthed loads of lambs and I reckon it’s the same thing.
We are mammals, after all.”</p>
<p>And so it is that I deliver our baby into the waiting hands of my
teenage brother-in-law. I don’t know how Jimmy understands he has to
turn the baby over, this slippery, bloodied creature, and slap its
bottom for that first reassuring cry, or whether he ties the umbilical
cord then snips it off with scissors still smeared with this morning’s
bacon, or how he realizes—lambing, I suppose—that two minutes later I’ll
need to push out the afterbirth and we’re not done yet. But before long
I am sitting on the floor with my baby boy, wrapped in a towel, in my
arms.</p>
<p>“We did it,” I say to Jimmy, crying again. But these tears are
different.</p>
<p>What can I say about the instant rush of love I feel for the tiny
human in my arms? The dear little face I don’t yet know but am already
addicted to.</p>
<p>“You did it,” Jimmy says. “I just helped at the end.”</p>
<p>“Is he OK?”</p>
<p>I don’t know why I’m asking a schoolboy without a scrap of medical
training, but he has become godlike to me in this final hour.</p>
<p>“He’s perfect, Beth. Should you try feeding him? I think that side to
side thing he’s doing with his mouth might mean he’s hungry?”</p>
<p>I unbutton the tent dress, push down my bra, direct my nipple toward
my baby’s mouth, and, like a miracle, he clamps his lips around it and
begins to suck. Jimmy and I look at each other and laugh.</p>
<p>Just then, the front door opens and Frank comes in, taking in the
scene in an instant. “Oh, my God,” he says, hurling himself toward me,
his face a fury of anxiety.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. Look,” I say. “Isn’t he lovely?”</p>
<p>“A boy?” He kneels on the floor and places a hand on the baby’s
cheek.</p>
<p>And I see it, the wave of elation that transforms his face, just as
mine must have been when I saw our baby for the first time. There can be
no greater intoxication, no purer feeling, than the moment when you meet
your child after all the months of wondering and hoping and
dreaming.</p>
<p>“I love him,” he says.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“We’re lucky.”</p>
<p>“We are.”</p>
<p>He is ours, we are his, we are three.</p>
