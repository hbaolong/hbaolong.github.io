<h4 id="the-trial">The Trial</h4>
<p>My mother, sister, and I are in the front row of the public gallery
when my father takes the stand. There are many things I will never
forgive myself for and here is one of the worst—the impact the trial has
had on my parents. I’ve seen my father several times since the shooting
but today, I am shocked by how much he has aged. Eleanor sees it too,
for she gasps and grabs my hand. His hair has been thinning for a while
but, from our bird’s-eye view, I see how the sparse strands he carefully
sweeps over disguise an almost naked pate. His face is deeply lined, his
neck has become craggy without any of us noticing, and his hands are
shaking. For his court appearance, my dad is in his best suit, the one
he used to wear to weddings and now gets out for funerals. A landslide
of grief none of us were prepared for.</p>
<p>Once he begins talking—confirming his name, address, profession, and
relationship to the defendant—my father’s nerves seem to disappear. This
is his calm, confident teacher voice, a man who has spent three decades
holding his pupils’ attention. We were advised to choose a professional
person as a character witness, a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, someone of
high standing in their community. No one with better credentials than my
father. Do I feel guilty about his testifying in court knowing, as I do,
he does not have the full set of facts before him? Yes, I feel sick with
it. If he finds out, there is every possibility he may never forgive me.
But what else could I do? There are three of us bound by this lie and
far too much at stake to risk telling anyone, even my dad, the
truth.</p>
<p>The examination with our barrister passes easily enough. No difficult
questions to trip my father up, plenty of opportunity for him to provide
a glowing reference for the defendant. Beside me, my mother begins to
relax. She even manages to turn to me at one point and smile.</p>
<p>But, all too soon, the Crown prosecutor Donald Glossop is standing
for his turn.</p>
<p>His voice is gentle at the start, but I have seen enough of his
cat-and-mouse tactics to dread what lies beneath.</p>
<p>“How long have you known the Johnson family, Mr. Kennedy?” he
asks.</p>
<p>“I’ve known them many years. David Johnson, Frank and Jimmy’s father,
was initially an acquaintance, I would say, rather than a friend.
Hemston is not a big village and we all knew each other to varying
degrees. Once my daughter married into the family, I came to know the
Johnsons much better.”</p>
<p>“And in that time, did you see much friction between the two
brothers? Can you think of an incident, perhaps an argument that got out
of hand, an explosive row, say, or indeed any sort of conflict?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>I catch my mother’s half smile as my father leans forward with
intent. She knows exactly what he is about to say; the two of them must
have rehearsed his witness statement a dozen times.</p>
<p>“The brothers were closer than any siblings I have ever seen. They
looked out for one another. Frank was a devoted older brother. He
worried about Jimmy constantly and always tried to keep him on track. A
good man, a kind man, he went the extra mile not just for Jimmy but for
everyone in the village. And Jimmy was the same. A sweet boy, troubled
at times, but with a big heart.”</p>
<p>“But, latterly, you were aware of the conflict between them?”</p>
<p>My father hesitates. For him, not telling the truth is an
impossibility.</p>
<p>“Things became tense at the farmhouse in the days leading up to”—he
stumbles, for the first time—“the tragedy. Jimmy became very volatile I
am told. He was drinking heavily, and I believe it clouded his
judgement. The brothers disagreed on how certain matters should be
handled.”</p>
<p>It is unbearable, my father tying himself in knots as he tries to
navigate the perilous task of saying enough, yet not too much.</p>
<p>“You’re referring to your daughter’s affair with Gabriel Wolfe?”</p>
<p>“I am not here to comment on my daughter’s private life. I am here
for the sole purpose of providing character evidence for the defendant.
Which I hope I have done.”</p>
<p>“I understand that, Mr. Kennedy. Nevertheless, I believe it is in the
jury’s interest if I ask you how long you have known Mr. Wolfe.”</p>
<p>My father hesitates again. “I knew him as a young man, briefly.”</p>
<p>“When his relationship with your daughter began the first time?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How long did that first love affair last, Mr. Kennedy?”</p>
<p>“Not long. One summer and perhaps a month or so after that.”</p>
<p>“And quite soon after it ended, she started a relationship with Frank
Johnson?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They married young, didn’t they?”</p>
<p>“They did, yes.”</p>
<p>I feel it, a new alertness in the room. We are all of us—the judge,
the jury, the journalists on the press bench, the members of the public
who queue up day after day to ensure their place in the gallery—attuned
to the changing nuances of Donald Glossop’s tone. A softening in his
timbre does not signal empathy, quite often the reverse.</p>
<p>“One might think your daughter, Beth, had not fully recovered from
this first, most passionate love affair.”</p>
<p>My father says nothing. His hands are not visible but I know he will
be clasping them together—Here’s the church, here’s the steeple, open
the door and see all the people. How many times did he chant the rhyme
with Bobby? A hundred? Five hundred?</p>
<p>The prosecutor’s voice grows forceful. “It is my belief Frank Johnson
harbored a ferocious jealousy of Gabriel Wolfe from the very beginning
of his marriage.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No? He wasn’t jealous of the man your daughter was in love with as a
girl? And he wasn’t jealous many years later when the affair started up
again, right under his nose?”</p>
<p>“Frank is not jealous. That isn’t his temperament.”</p>
<p>“Are you an honest man, Mr. Kennedy?”</p>
<p>My mother frowns and Eleanor sucks in a long, jagged breath as she
tries not to cry. My father is the most honest man you could ever
meet.</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Then allow me to ask one final question. Do you genuinely believe
your son-in-law felt no jealousy whatsoever while the woman he loved was
spending her daylight hours in bed with another man?”</p>
<p>So heartless to draw that picture for my father in the witness stand,
my mother beside me in the gallery. You’d think I’d be macerating in
shame, but the truth is, I’ve been ashamed for so long now it is my
background noise, my everyday wallpaper, the emotion so familiar I feel
little else. Our love triangle—the farmer, his wife, and the famous
author—has been prodded and picked over and sensationalized out of all
proportion in Fleet Street. A blizzard of headlines pointing the finger
of blame—and shame—at me. You grow inured to it after a while. None of
it matters, anyway.</p>
<p>“Frank understood my daughter’s reasons for the affair,” my father
says. “If he felt jealous, then he was extremely good at hiding it.”</p>
<p>Donald Glossop allows himself a tiny smile of satisfaction. “Thank
you, Mr. Kennedy. No further questions, my lord.”</p>
