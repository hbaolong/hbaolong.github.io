This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical constants’
(in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</h4>
<pre><code>    5.41 For all results of truth-operations on truth-functions are identical whenever they are one and the same truth-function of elementary propositions.</code></pre>
<h5 id="之前的单词学习"><a
href="./hash/0091.html">5.4之前的单词学习</a></h5>
<ul>
<li><p>constant,英 [ˈkɒnstənt] 美 [ˈkɑːnstənt] adj.
持续不断的，经常发生的；恒定的，不变的；忠诚的，忠实的
n. 常数，恒量；不变的事物</p>
<pre><code>  5.42 That v, ⊃, etc. are not relations in the sense of right and left, etc., is evident.</code></pre>
<p>The interdefinability of Frege’s and Russell’s ‘primitive signs’ of
logic shows in itself that these are not primitive signs and, even more,
that they do not signify relations.</p>
<p>And it is obvious that the ‘⊃’ that we define by means of ‘~’ and ‘v’
is identical with the one by means of which, with ‘~’, we define ‘v’,
and that this ‘v’ is identical with the first; and so on.</p>
<pre><code>  5.43 It is surely hard to believe that from one fact p infinitely many others should follow, namely, ~ ~p, ~ ~ ~ ~p, etc. And no less remarkable is it that the infinite number of propositions of logic (mathematics) follow from half a dozen ‘primitive propositions’.</code></pre>
<p>All propositions of logic, however, say the same. Namely,
nothing.</p>
<pre><code>  5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions.</code></pre>
<p>If an affirmation, for example, can be generated by double negation,
then is negation—in some sense—contained in affirmation? Does ‘~ ~p’
negate ~p, or does it affirm p, or both?</p>
<p>The proposition ‘~ ~p’ is not concerned with negation as if it were
an object; but the possibility of negation is certainly already
presupposed in affirmation.</p>
<p>And if there were an object called ‘~’, then what ‘~ ~p’ and ‘p’ say
would have to be different. For the one proposition would then be
concerned with ~, the other not.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5.441 This vanishing of the apparent logical constants also occurs
where ‘<sub>(∃x).</sub>fx’ says the same as ‘(x).fx’, or ‘(∃x). fx.x =
a’ the same as ‘fa’.</p>
<p>5.442 If a proposition is given to us, then with it are also given
the results of all truth-operations that have it as their base.</p>
<pre><code>    5.45 If there are primitive signs of logic, then a correct logic must make clear their relation to one another and justify their occurrence. The construction of logic out of its primitive signs must become clear.</code></pre>
<p>5.451 If logic has primitive ideas, then they must be independent of
one another. If a primitive idea is introduced, then it must be
introduced in all combinations in which it occurs whatsoever. It cannot
be introduced, that is, first for one combination and then once more for
another. For example, if negation is introduced, then it must now be the
case that we understand it in propositions of the form ‘~p’ as well as
in propositions such as ‘~(pvq)’, ‘(∃x).~fx’, among others. We must not
introduce it first for one class of cases, then for another, for it
would then be left in doubt whether its meaning is the same in the two
cases and there would be no reason given for using the same kind of
sign-combination in the two cases.</p>
<pre><code> (In short, what Frege said (in Basic Laws of Arithmetic) about the introduction of signs by means of definitions also holds, mutatis mutandis, for the introduction of primitive signs.)</code></pre>
<p>5.452 The introduction of a new aid into the symbolism of logic must
always be an event of consequence. No new aid may be introduced in
logic—with a quite innocent face, so to speak—in brackets or in the
margins.</p>
<pre><code> (This is how definitions and primitive propositions appear in words in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica. Why suddenly words here? Justification is needed. This is missing and is bound to be missing, since the practice is in fact illegitimate.)

 If the introduction of a new aid has proved necessary at a certain point, however, then the question must immediately be asked: Where must this aid now always be applied? Its place in logic must now be explained.</code></pre>
<p>5.453 All numbers in logic have to be justified.</p>
<pre><code> Or rather: it must turn out that there are no numbers in logic.

 There are no pre-eminent numbers.</code></pre>
<p>5.454 In logic there is no juxtaposition, there can be no
classification.</p>
<pre><code> In logic there cannot be degrees of generality and specificity.</code></pre>
<p>5.4541 The solutions of the problems of logic must be simple, for
they set the standard of simplicity.People have always suspected that
there must be a realm of questions whose answers—a priori—lie
symmetrically united in a self-contained, regular structure.A realm in
which the proposition holds: simplex sigillum veri.</p>
<pre><code>    5.46 If the logical signs were introduced correctly, then the sense of all their combinations would thereby also have been introduced; that is, not only ‘pvq’ but also ‘~(pv~q)’, etc. etc. The effect of all possible combinations of brackets would thereby also have been introduced. And it would then have become clear that the real general primitive signs are not ‘pvq’, ‘(∃x).fx’, etc., but the most general form of their combinations.</code></pre>
<p>5.461 Of great significance is the apparently unimportant fact that
pseudo-relations in logic, such as v und ⊃, need brackets, unlike real
relations.</p>
<pre><code> For the use of brackets with these apparently primitive signs already indicates that they are not the real primitive signs. And no one could possibly believe that brackets have an independent meaning.</code></pre>
<p>5.4611 Signs for logical operations are punctuation marks.</p>
<pre><code>    5.47 It is clear that everything that can be said from the outset about the form of all propositions must be capable of being said all at once.

 For all logical operations are already contained in the elementary proposition. For ‘fa’ says the same as ‘(∃x).fx.x = a’.

 Where there is compositionality, there is argument and function, and where these are, there are already all logical constants.

 One could say: the one logical constant is what all propositions, by their nature, have in common with one another.

 But that is the general propositional form.</code></pre>
<p>5.471 The general propositional form is the essence of the
proposition.</p>
<p>5.4711 To specify the essence of the proposition is to specify the
essence of all description, and thus the essence of the world.</p>
<p>5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is the
description of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.</p>
<p>5.473 Logic must take care of itself.</p>
<pre><code> A possible sign must also be able to signify. Everything that is possible in logic is also permitted. (‘Socrates is identical’ thus means nothing, because there is no property that is called ‘identical’. The proposition is nonsensical because we have failed to make some arbitrary determination, not because the symbol in itself is impermissible.)

 In a certain sense, we cannot make mistakes in logic.</code></pre>
<p>5.4731 Self-evidence, of which Russell spoke so much, can only become
dispensable in logic by language itself preventing every logical
mistake.—That logic is a priori consists in this: that we cannot think
illogically.</p>
<p>5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.</p>
<p>5.47321 Occam’s razor is not, of course, an arbitrary rule, nor one
justified by its practical success: it says that unnecessary sign-units
mean nothing.Signs that serve one purpose are logically equivalent,
signs that serve no purpose are logically meaningless.</p>
<p>5.4733 Frege says: every legitimately constructed proposition must
have a sense; and I say: every possible proposition is legitimately
constructed, and if it has no sense, then this can only be because we
have not given a meaning to some of its constituents.(Even if we think
we have done so.)So that is why ‘Socrates is identical’ says nothing,
because we have given no meaning to the word ‘identical’ as adjective.
For when it occurs as the identity sign, it symbolizes in a quite
different way—the signifying relation is a different one; that is, the
symbol in the two cases is also quite different; the two symbols have
only the sign in common with one another accidentally.</p>
<p>5.474 The number of basic operations that are required depends only
on our notation.</p>
<p>5.475 It is simply a matter of constructing a sign-system with a
particular number of dimensions—with a particular mathematical
multiplicity.</p>
<p>5.476 It is clear that the concern here is not with a number of
primitive ideas that have to be signified, but with the expression of a
rule.</p>
