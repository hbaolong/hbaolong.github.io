<h4 id="a-thought-is-a-senseful-proposition.">4 A thought is a senseful
proposition.</h4>
<p>4.001 The totality of propositions is language.</p>
<p>4.002 Human beings possess the ability to construct languages in
which every sense can be expressed, without having any idea of how and
what each word means.—Just as one speaks without knowing how the
individual sounds are produced.</p>
<pre><code> Everyday language is a part of the human organism and no less complicated than it.

 It is humanly impossible to immediately gather from it the logic of language.

 Language disguises thought. And in such a way that the form of the thought that is clothed cannot be inferred from the outer form of the clothing, because the outer form of the clothing is designed for quite other purposes than to allow the form of the body to be recognized.*

 The tacit agreements underlying the understanding of everyday language are enormously complicated.</code></pre>
<p>4.003 Most of the propositions and questions that have been
formulated about philosophical matters are not false but nonsensical. So
we cannot answer questions of this kind at all, but only expose their
nonsensicality. Most of philosophers’ questions and propositions are due
to our not understanding the logic of our language.</p>
<pre><code> (They are of the same kind as the question whether the good is more or less identical than the beautiful.)

 And it is no wonder that the deepest problems are really not problems.</code></pre>
<p>4.0031 All philosophy is ‘critique of language’. (Albeit not in
Mauthner’s sense.*) Russell’s merit is to have shown that the apparent
logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.</p>
<pre><code>    4.01 A proposition is a picture of reality.

 A proposition is a model of reality as we conceive it.*</code></pre>
<p>4.011 At first sight a proposition—as printed out on paper, say—does
not appear to be a picture of the reality it concerns. But neither does
musical notation appear at first sight to be a picture of music, nor our
phonetic (alphabetic) notation a picture of our spoken language.</p>
<pre><code> And yet these sign-languages* prove to be pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.</code></pre>
<p>4.012 It is obvious we have a sense of a proposition of the form
‘aRb’ as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of what is
signified.</p>
<p>4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictoriality, then
we see that this is not confounded by apparent irregularities (as in the
use of ♯ and ♭ in musical notation).</p>
<pre><code> For these irregularities, too, depict what they are intended to express, just in a different way.</code></pre>
<p>4.014 A gramophone record, the musical thought, the musical notation,
the sound waves, all stand to one another in that internal relation of
depicting that holds between language and world.</p>
<pre><code> Common to all of them is the logical construction.

 (Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the fairy tale.* They are all in a certain sense one.)</code></pre>
<p>4.0141 That there is a general rule by which the musician can read
off the symphony from the score, and that there is a rule by which the
symphony can be reconstructed from the line on the gramophone record and
from this again—by means of the first rule—construct the score, is what
constitutes the internal similarity between these apparently very
different things. And this rule is the law of projection which projects
the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule for
translating this language into the language of the gramophone
record.*</p>
<p>4.015 The possibility of all similes, of the whole pictoriality of
our language,* lies in the logic of depiction.</p>
<p>4.016 To understand the essence of a proposition, consider
hieroglyphic script, which depicts the facts that it describes.</p>
<pre><code> And alphabetic script came out of it, without losing what is essential in depiction.

    4.02 We see this from our ability to understand the sense of a propositional sign without its having been explained to us.</code></pre>
<p>4.021 A proposition is a picture of reality: for I know the state of
affairs it represents if I understand the proposition. And I understand
the proposition without its sense having been explained to me.</p>
<p>4.022 A proposition shows its sense.</p>
<pre><code> A proposition shows how things stand if it is true. And it says that they so stand.*</code></pre>
<p>4.023 Reality must be fixed by a proposition to elicit either yes or
no.*</p>
<pre><code> To do this, it must be completely described by the proposition.

 A proposition is a description of a state-of-things.

 Like the description of an object by its external properties, so a proposition describes reality by its internal properties.

 A proposition constructs a world by means of a logical scaffolding and that is how one can actually see in the proposition all the logical features of reality if it is true.* One can draw inferences from a false proposition.</code></pre>
<p>4.024 To understand a proposition is to know what is the case if it
is true.</p>
<pre><code> (One can thus understand it without knowing whether it is true.)

 One understands it if one understands its constituents.</code></pre>
<p>4.025 The translation of one language into another does not proceed
by translating every proposition of one into a proposition of another,
but only the constituents of the proposition are translated.*</p>
<pre><code> (And the dictionary translates not only substantives but also verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions, etc.; and it treats them all alike.)</code></pre>
<p>4.026 The meanings of simple signs (words) must be explained to us
for us to understand them.</p>
<pre><code> With propositions, however, we communicate.*</code></pre>
<p>4.027 It is essential to a proposition that it can convey a new sense
to us.</p>
<pre><code>    4.03 A proposition must convey a new sense with old expressions.

 A proposition conveys a state of affairs to us, and hence must connect essentially to the state of affairs.

 And the connection is precisely that it is its logical picture.

 A proposition only states something insofar as it is a picture.</code></pre>
<p>4.031 In a proposition a state of affairs is put together
experimentally, as it were.</p>
<pre><code> Saying that this proposition has such and such a sense is really saying that this proposition represents such and such a state of affairs.</code></pre>
<p>4.0311 One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, and
they are combined with one another; in this way the whole—like a tableau
vivant—presents a state-of-things.*</p>
<p>4.0312 The possibility of a proposition rests on the principle of the
representation of objects by signs.</p>
<pre><code> My fundamental thought is that the ‘logical constants’ do not represent. That the logic of facts cannot be represented.*</code></pre>
<p>4.032 A proposition is a picture of a state of affairs only insofar
as it is logically articulated.</p>
<pre><code> (The proposition ‘ambulo’ is composite, too, since its stem with a different ending and its ending with a different stem yield different senses.)

    4.04 In a proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as in the state of affairs it represents.

 The two must have the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity. (Compare Hertz’s Mechanics, on Dynamic Models.)*</code></pre>
<p>4.041 This mathematical multiplicity, of course, cannot in its turn
be depicted. One cannot get outside it in depiction.</p>
<p>4.0411 Trying to express, for example, what we express by ‘(x).fx’ by
putting an index before ‘fx’—as in ‘Gen.fx’—wouldn’t work: we would not
know what was being generalized. Trying to register it by an index
‘g’—as in ‘f (xg)’—wouldn’t work either: we would not know the scope of
the generality-sign.</p>
<pre><code> Trying to do it by introducing a mark in the argument-places—as in ‘(G, G).F(G, G)’—wouldn’t work: we could not determine* the identity of the variables. And so on.

 All these modes of signification do not work because they do not have the necessary mathematical multiplicity.</code></pre>
<p>4.0412 For the same reason the idealist’s explanation of the seeing
of spatial relations via ‘spatial spectacles’ doesn’t work, because it
cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.</p>
<pre><code>    4.05 Reality is compared with a proposition.

    4.06 A proposition can be true or false only by being a picture of reality.</code></pre>
<p>4.061 If one does not bear in mind that a proposition has a sense
that is independent of the facts, then one can easily suppose that true
and false are relations between sign and what is signified that are on
an equal footing.</p>
<pre><code> One could then say, for example, that ‘p’ signifies in the true way what ‘~p’ signifies in the false way, etc.</code></pre>
<p>4.062 Can’t we communicate with false propositions as we have done up
to now with true ones? So long as we know that they are meant to be
false. No! For a proposition is true if things are as we say they are by
using it; and if we mean ~p by ‘p’, and things are as we mean it, then
‘p’ in the new conception is true and not false.</p>
<p>4.0621 However, it is important that the signs ‘p’ and ‘~p’ can say
the same. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign
‘~’.</p>
<pre><code> The occurrence of negation in a proposition is not necessarily a mark of its sense (~~p = p).

 The propositions ‘p’ and ‘~p’ have opposite sense, but one and the same reality corresponds to them.</code></pre>
<p>4.063 A picture to explain the concept of truth: black spot on white
paper; the form of the spot can be described by stating for each point
of the surface whether it is white or black. The fact that a point is
black corresponds to a positive fact, that a point is white (not black)
to a negative fact. If I signify a point of the surface (a Fregean
truth-value*), then this corresponds to the supposition that is put up
for judgement, etc. etc.</p>
<pre><code> However, to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know when a point is called black and when white; to be able to say that ‘p’ is true (or false), I must have determined under what circumstances I call ‘p’ true, and I thereby determine the sense of the proposition.

 The point at which the analogy breaks down is now this: we can indicate a point on the paper without even knowing what white and black are; but nothing at all corresponds to a proposition without sense, since it does not signify a thing (truth-value) whose properties are called, say, ‘false’ or ‘true’; the verb of a proposition is not ‘is true’ or ‘is false’—as Frege supposed—but that which is ‘true’ must already contain the verb.</code></pre>
<p>4.064 Every proposition must already have sense; affirmation cannot
give it sense, for what is affirmed is precisely its sense. And the same
holds for negation, etc.</p>
<p>4.0641 One could say: negation already relates to the logical place
that the negated proposition determines.</p>
<pre><code> The negating proposition determines a different logical place than the negated does.

 The negating proposition determines a logical place by means of the logical place of the negated proposition in describing the former as lying outside the latter.

 That the negated proposition can again be negated alone shows that what is negated is already a proposition and not just the preliminary to a proposition.</code></pre>
