What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.*</h4>
<pre><code>    2.01 A state-of-things is a combination of objects (entities, things).*</code></pre>
<p>2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent of a
state-of-things.</p>
<p>2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a
state-of-things, then the possibility of the state-of-things must
already be prefigured* in the thing.</p>
<p>2.0121 It would appear as an accident, as it were, if a state of
affairs were subsequently to fit a thing that could exist in and by
itself.</p>
<pre><code>If things can occur in states-of-things, then this possibility must already lie in them.

(What is logical cannot be merely possible. Logic deals with every possibility and all possibilities are its facts.)

Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all outside space, or temporal objects outside time, so we cannot think of any object outside the possibility of its combination with other objects.

If I can think of an object in the context of a state-of-things, then I cannot think of it outside the possibility of this context.</code></pre>
<p>2.0122 A thing is independent insofar as it can occur in all possible
states of affairs, but this form of independence is a form of connection
with a state-of-things, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for
words to appear in two different ways, on their own and in a
proposition.*)</p>
<p>2.0123 If I know* an object, then I also know all the possibilities
of its occurrence in states-of-things.</p>
<pre><code> (Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)

 A new possibility cannot be found subsequently.</code></pre>
<p>2.01231 To know an object, I do not need to know its external
properties—but I must know all its internal properties.</p>
<p>2.0124 If all objects are given, then all possible states-of-things
are thereby also given.</p>
<p>2.013 Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible
states-of-things. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the
thing without the space.</p>
<p>2.0131 A spatial object must lie in infinite space. (A spatial point
is an argument-place.)</p>
<pre><code> A spot in the visual field need not be red, but it must have some colour: it has, so to speak, a colour space around it. A sound must have some pitch, an object of touch some hardness, and so on.</code></pre>
<p>2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all states of affairs.*</p>
<p>2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in states-of-things is the
form of an object.</p>
<pre><code>    2.02 An object is simple.*</code></pre>
<p>2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a
statement about their constituents and into those propositions that
describe the complexes completely.</p>
<p>2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. That is why they
cannot be composite.</p>
<p>2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had
sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.</p>
<p>2.0212 It would then be impossible to draw up a picture of the world
(true or false).</p>
<p>2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however different from
the real world it may be, must have something—a form—in common with the
real world.</p>
<p>2.023 This fixed form consists simply of the objects.</p>
<p>2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form and not
any material properties. For these are only represented* by
propositions—only formed by the configuration of objects.</p>
<p>2.0232 Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.</p>
<p>2.0233 Two objects of the same logical form—aside from their external
properties—are only distinguished from one another in that they are
different.</p>
<p>2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in which
case one can single it out from others straightaway by a description and
refer to it;* or, instead, there are several things that have all their
properties in common, in which case it is quite impossible to point to
one of them.</p>
<pre><code>For if a thing is not distinguished by anything, then I cannot distinguish it, for otherwise it would be distinguished.</code></pre>
<p>2.024 Substance is what subsists* independently of what is the
case.</p>
<p>2.025 It is form and content.</p>
<p>2.0251 Space, time and colour (colouration) are forms of objects.</p>
<p>2.026 Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the
world.</p>
<p>2.027 The fixed, the subsistent* and the object are one.</p>
<p>2.0271 The object is the fixed, the subsistent; the configuration is
the changing, the inconstant.*</p>
<p>2.0272 The configuration of objects forms the state-of-things.</p>
<pre><code>    2.03 In a state-of-things the objects hang in one another, like the links of a chain.</code></pre>
<p>2.031 In a state-of-things the objects stand to one another in a
determinate way.*</p>
<p>2.032 The way in which the objects connect* in a state-of-things is
the structure of the state-of-things.</p>
<p>2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.</p>
<p>2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the
states-of-things.</p>
<pre><code>    2.04 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things is the world.

    2.05 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things also determines which states-of-things do not obtain.

    2.06 The obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things is reality.

 (The obtaining of states-of-things we also call a positive, the non-obtaining a negative fact.)</code></pre>
<p>2.061 States-of-things are independent of one another.</p>
<p>2.062 From the obtaining or non-obtaining of a state-of-things, the
obtaining or non-obtaining of another cannot be inferred.</p>
<p>2.063 The totality of reality is the world.</p>
