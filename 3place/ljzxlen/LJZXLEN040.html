<h4 id="explanatory-notes">Explanatory Notes</h4>
<p>Motto Motto … Kürnberger. This is cited from an essay by the Austrian
writer Ferdinand Kürnberger (1821–79) entitled ‘Das Denkmalsetzen in der
Opposition’, first published in the Deutsche Zeitung in 1873.</p>
<p>Preface and of what one cannot talk, about that one must be silent:
wovon man nicht reden kann, darüber muß man schweigen. This also forms
the final proposition (7) of the book, the only difference being the use
of ‘reden’ rather than ‘sprechen’. On its translation, see the note to 7
below.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things: Was
der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten. Here—and
throughout—‘Tatsache’ is translated as ‘fact’ (and ‘fact’ is used only
in translating ‘Tatsache’), and ‘Sachverhalt’ as ‘state-of-things’
(which is used only to translate ‘Sachverhalt’). ‘Bestehen’ is
translated here as ‘obtaining’, though elsewhere the verb ‘bestehen’ is
rendered differently, as indicated in the Glossary and explained, where
needed, in the relevant notes below. In the original translation of the
Tractatus, Ramsey and Ogden rendered this proposition as ‘What is the
case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts’. This rightly draws
attention to the connection between a ‘Tatsache’ and a ‘Sachverhalt’
(both are ‘sachlich’ or ‘factual’), but does so in a misleading way,
since it suggests that facts are somehow composed of ‘atomic facts’.
What Wittgenstein actually says is more nuanced: that a fact is the
obtaining of Sachverhalten. Talk of ‘existing’ rather than ‘existence’
here would be marginally better, but ‘obtaining’ (or ‘holding’) is best,
since it carries less implication of ‘composition’. A fact is that a
Sachverhalt obtains or that Sachverhalten obtain. In their later
translation, Pears and McGuinness also render ‘Bestehen’ as ‘existence’,
but this term is more appropriately reserved for ‘Existenz’, which
Wittgenstein only uses seven times (see the Glossary). ‘Sachverhalt’
they translate as ‘state of affairs’, but this has too broad a meaning,
suggesting a more complex state. As 4.21 makes clear, a Sachverhalt is
indeed ‘atomic’—but not a fact. As Wittgenstein says in the proposition
that immediately follows 2, a Sachverhalt is ‘a combination of objects
(entities, things)’ (2.01). So ‘state of things’ seems better than
‘state of affairs’ (as Pears and McGuinness implicitly recognize in
interpolating ‘state of things’ after ‘state of affairs’ in their
translation of 2.01). Hyphens have been added, though, to form
‘state-of-things’, to highlight that what we have here is a unity—and
hence to better reflect Wittgenstein’s use of the single German word
‘Sachverhalt’. In the present translation, ‘state of affairs’ is also
used, but only as the translation of ‘Sachlage’ (which Pears and
McGuinness render as ‘situation’). This brings out the connection
between states-of-things and states of affairs: a state-of-things is an
atomic or elementary state of affairs (but again, not a fact). Cf. the
note to 2.014 below.</p>
<p>2.01 objects (entities, things). The three German terms are
‘Gegenstände’, ‘Sachen’, and ‘Dinge’, translated as ‘objects’,
‘entities’, and ‘things’, respectively. Wittgenstein is clearly using
the terms here as roughly synonymous. ‘Gegenstand’ is translated
throughout as ‘object’, and ‘Ding’ as ‘thing’.</p>
<p>2.012 prefigured: präjudiziert.</p>
<p>Note *. In this translation, the logical weight has also been
represented typographically, by font size, style, and line spacing (in
the case of the propositions n and n.1, n.2, etc.), and indentation of
the decimal numbers. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is
for the reader (and translator) to keep in mind the numbering
system.</p>
<p>2.0122 proposition: Satz. This is the first occurrence of ‘Satz’ in
the (main text of the) Tractatus, and might naturally be translated as
‘sentence’ here, as a linguistic expression in which words occur. But
even here, and in similar cases throughout the text, Wittgenstein has in
mind sentences that (at least purportedly) have a sense and a
truth-value, so that ‘proposition’ is not inappropriate. In both the
notes he left for Russell in October 1913 (partly in English but mostly
translated by Russell himself; NB, App. I) and the notes he dictated to
Moore in April 1914 (NB, App. II), ‘proposition’ is used throughout.
‘Proposition’ was a standard term in British philosophy at the time,
although there was debate about its ‘nature’ and views changed. In his
Principles of Mathematics of 1903, Russell had characterized a
‘proposition’ as ‘anything that is true or that is false’ (pp. 12–13),
but by the time of his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy of 1919,
which appeared just before he met Wittgenstein to discuss the Tractatus
and how it should be translated, he had given it a qualified linguistic
inflection: ‘We mean by a “proposition” primarily a form of words which
expresses what is either true or false. I say “primarily”, because I do
not wish to exclude other than verbal symbols, or even mere thoughts if
they have a symbolic character’ (p. 155). This is compatible with
Wittgenstein’s use of ‘Satz’ in the Tractatus, and he raised no
objections to its rendering as ‘proposition’ in the translation by
Ramsey and Ogden. In the present translation, too, ‘Satz’ is rendered
throughout by ‘proposition’, and ‘proposition’ is only used for ‘Satz’,
so that one can read back the German term. See also the notes to 3.12
and 4.025 below.</p>
<p>2.0123 know: kenne. Unlike ‘wissen’, the other verb that is generally
translated as ‘know’, ‘kennen’ can also mean ‘be acquainted with’.
Wittgenstein himself remarked that 2.0123 could be translated as ‘If I
am acquainted with an object, then I also know …’, but made clear that
he preferred ‘know’ for both uses of ‘kennen’. ‘To be acquainted with’,
he writes, ‘seems to me to imply somehow that one knows a lot about an
object, while to know here just means: I know it but I needn’t know
anything about it’ (LO, p. 59). Cf. the notes to 4.243 and 6.2322
below.</p>
<p>2.014 states of affairs: Sachlagen. Wittgenstein (LO, p. 21)
professed to dislike this translation but did not know what to suggest
instead, though he had wondered about the Latin term ‘status rerum’
(‘state of things’). ‘Sachlage’ is indeed rendered by ‘state of affairs’
in the Ramsey–Ogden translation, though ‘fact’ and ‘circumstance’ are
also used. In the present translation, it is rendered consistently by
‘state of affairs’ (which is only used for ‘Sachlage’, so that one can
read back the German term). There is clearly a connection between
‘Sachlagen’ and ‘Sachverhalten’, which is reflected in their
translations here: ‘states of affairs’ and ‘states-of-things’. A
state-of-things is an elementary or atomic state of affairs. Cf. the
note to 2 above.</p>
<p>2.02 An object is simple: Der Gegenstand ist einfach. This is a good
(and appropriately simple) illustration of one of the most difficult
things in translating German into English, surprising as that might seem
to those who have never done it: translating the definite articles—der,
die, das, etc. One should not assume that they can be rendered
straightforwardly as ‘the’ in all contexts, since the use of the
definite articles in German has a different (and wider) range than the
use of ‘the’ in English. One striking difference between the
Ramsey–Ogden and Pears–McGuinness translations is that the former uses
the definite article much more in translating Wittgenstein’s uses, while
the latter tends to use the indefinite article or pluralize. Ramsey and
Ogden translate ‘Der Gegenstand ist einfach’ as ‘The object is simple’,
for example, while Pears and McGuinness translate it as ‘Objects are
simple’. But the use of the definite article in English can sound more
formal, pompous, or archaic than it is in German (and certainly in
Wittgenstein’s German), in comparable cases, while pluralizing may
wrongly suggest that what we have is an empirical statement. The present
translation uses both definite and indefinite articles, only
occasionally pluralizing or, indeed, omitting altogether, depending on
what sounds most natural in the context. The differences are so subtle
that explanatory notes would become tedious, so the issue is only raised
here (but cf. Wittgenstein’s remarks cited in the notes to 4.464 and
5.1361 below). It should be kept in mind in reading this translation,
however, especially if detailed interpretations are being
considered.</p>
<p>2.0231 represented: dargestellt. With just one exception (see the
Glossary), ‘darstellen’ is translated throughout as ‘represent’. But
here is one case where ‘presented’ (as used in the Ramsey–Ogden
translation) has some rationale, since in being ‘formed by the
configuration of objects’, material properties can be seen as thereby
‘presented by propositions’. But ‘represented’ also works here, and it
is better to reserve ‘present’ for ‘vorstellen’. Cf. the note to 2.201
below.</p>
<p>2.02331 refer to it: darauf hinweisen.</p>
<p>2.024 subsists: besteht. This rendering is needed to make clear the
connection to the use of ‘Bestehende’ in 2.027 and 2.0271 (see the next
two notes).</p>
<p>2.027 the subsistent: das Bestehende. Here it would be misleading to
translate ‘Bestehende’ as ‘existent’ or ‘obtaining’, as ‘contingent’
existence is clearly not meant.</p>
<p>2.0271 The object … inconstant. A contrast is being drawn between the
‘Bestehende’ (‘subsistent’) and the ‘Unbeständige’ (‘inconstant’).</p>
<p>2.031 In a state-of-things the objects stand to one another in a
determinate way: Im Sachverhalt verhalten sich die Gegenstände in
bestimmter Art und Weise zueinander. It is hard to capture the play
between ‘Sachverhalt’ and ‘verhalten sich … zueinander’ in this key
proposition, but using ‘stand to one another’ for the latter captures
the main idea of a ‘state-of-things’.</p>
<p>2.032 connect: zusammenhängen.</p>
<p>2.1 We picture facts: Wir machen uns Bilder der Tatsachen, lit., we
make (to) ourselves, i.e. construct, pictures of facts. In the original
version of 2.1 in the Prototractatus, it read ‘Die Tatsachen begreifen
wir in Bildern’, lit., ‘The facts we grasp in pictures’, which is
compatible with—and arguably reinforces—the translation provided here.
The formulation was changed after 3.001 was added, though when exactly
(and if this was the cause) is unclear. On the translation, see the note
to 3.001 below.</p>
<p>2.11 presents: stellt … vor. This is one of just four uses of the
verb ‘vorstellen’ in the Tractatus, three of which are translated as
‘present’ (the others in 2.15 and 4.0311), one as ‘represent’ (5.631).
See the Glossary and the notes to the relevant propositions below.</p>
<p>2.14 standing to one another: sich … zu einander verhalten. Cf. 2.031
and the note to it above.</p>
<p>2.15 presents: stellt vor. To be consistent with its use in 2.11,
especially, as well as 4.0311, this should be translated as ‘presents’,
even though ‘represents’ would better fit the grammatical structure in
English. The ‘That … that …’ structure must be captured, as Wittgenstein
is talking here about facts.</p>
<p>2.1511 connected: verknüpft.</p>
<p>2.1514 things: Sachen.</p>
<p>2.1515 feelers: Fühler. Wittgenstein explained that by ‘Fühler’ here
‘I meant the things which a butterfly has’ (LO, p. 24).</p>
<p>2.172 it features it: es weist sie auf . ‘Features’ has the double
meaning of ‘possessing’ and ‘manifesting’, which seems appropriate
here.</p>
<p>2.201 A picture … states-of things. This is the first remark in which
both the verbs ‘abbilden’ and ‘darstellen’ are used. The former is
translated throughout by ‘depict’ (which is only used for ‘abbilden’)
and the latter by ‘represent’, with just one exception (and ‘represent’
is only used for ‘darstellen’, with just two exceptions). See the
Glossary for details. The translation by Ramsey and Ogden was not
consistent in this respect, although the two verbs might indeed be used
synonymously in some contexts. But Wittgenstein is careful in his use,
distinguishing them. As 2.201 says, a picture depicts reality by
representing possible states-of-things. Once propositions have been
characterized as pictures, he can then claim that a proposition is true
if what it represents agrees with what it depicts, and false otherwise
(see e.g. 4.021 ff.).</p>
<p>2.223 tell: erkennen; also in 2.224. Its usual meaning of ‘recognize’
does not fit here.</p>
<p>3.001 means: we can picture it: heißt: wir können uns ein Bild von
ihm machen. Wittgenstein had said that he didn’t know how to translate
the latter sentence, but suggested ‘we can imagine it’: ‘because
“imagine” comes from “image” and this is something like picture. In
German it is a sort of pun’ (LO, p. 24). But he may not have appreciated
the (idiomatic) use of ‘picture’ as a verb, which reflects much better
the ‘pun’ of which he speaks.</p>
<p>3.1 perceptibly: sinnlich wahrnehmbar, lit., sense-perceptibly,
i.e. in a way that can be perceived by the senses.</p>
<p>3.12 And a proposition … the world. This makes clear Wittgenstein’s
‘official’ conception of a Satz: a Satzzeichen in its projective
relation to the world. It is this use of ‘Satz’ that is appropriately
captured by ‘proposition’, leaving ‘Satzzeichen’ as ‘propositional
sign’, for which ‘sentence’ could also be used—though that would then
obscure the connection between ‘Satz’ and ‘Satzzeichen’. See the notes
to 2.0122 above and 4.025 below.</p>
<p>3.13 Thus the possibility … expressing it. This is a good example of
the difficulty of translating modal qualifiers such as ‘aber’, ‘allein’,
‘allerdings’, ‘also’, ‘auch’, ‘da’, ‘daher’, ‘darum’, ‘doch’, ‘eben’,
‘ja’, ‘jedenfalls’, ‘nämlich’, ‘obwohl’, ‘schon’, ‘so’, ‘sondern’, and
‘wohl’. They reflect the subtle relationships between the uses of
phrases and sentences and the transitions from one to another, and can
be a devil to translate, since they do not match up easily with English
terms. One of the frequent qualifiers is ‘also’, which Ramsey and Ogden
invariably render, and Pears and McGuinness often render, as
‘therefore’, as here in 3.13. But ‘also’ in German has a range of
meanings, from the deductive through the elucidatory to the exclamatory,
as it might be described. Listing them accordingly, it can mean
‘therefore’, ‘hence’, ‘thus’, or ‘so’, but also ‘that is’, ‘that is to
say’, ‘namely’, or, especially in conversation, even just ‘well’ or
something like ‘okay, then’. There are indeed arguments in the
Tractatus, but it is also a work of elucidation, as Wittgenstein himself
stresses. Often what he does is give variant formulations or a different
aspect of something in clarifying it rather than deducing something
else. In such contexts, ‘that is’ might be a better translation of
‘also’ than ‘therefore’. Here, in 3.13, something intermediate seems
appropriate, and ‘thus’ has thus been used. Although it is hard to pick
up the nuances of the various uses of modal qualifiers in the Tractatus,
a policy of flexibility has been adopted throughout, listening to what
the text says and how it sounds in choosing the best of what may be
several options in English. (‘Therefore’ sounds too harsh and overly
deductive in English here, and ‘thus’ gives a softer, semi-deductive,
and more elucidatory feel.)</p>
<p>means the content of a senseful proposition. Here ‘means’ translates
‘heißt’ and ‘senseful’ translates ‘sinnvoll’, to preserve the connection
with all its cognates, especially ‘sinnlos’ (senseless). The term
‘senseful’ has fallen into relative disuse but deserves to be revived,
just as ‘contentful’ has become more widely used. Cf. the note to 3.326
below.</p>
<p>3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning. Here ‘means’
translates ‘bedeutet’ and ‘meaning’ translates ‘Bedeutung’.</p>
<p>3.221 I can only speak of them, I cannot state them: Ich kann nur von
ihnen sprechen, sie aussprechen kann ich nicht. ‘Aussprechen’ is
translated as ‘state’ here, as in 4.116, 6.421, and 6.5 (see the
relevant notes below); literally, it means ‘pronounce’ or ‘speak out
about’, and might also be rendered as ‘articulate’. It is also
translated as ‘spell out’ in 3.262 (see the relevant note below).</p>
<p>3.23 demand: Forderung.</p>
<p>3.24 The generality-sign contains a prototype.
Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung = generality-sign; Urbild = prototype.</p>
<p>3.261 unpacked: auseinanderlegen. The German term covers both
‘unfold’ and ‘explicate’.</p>
<p>3.262 What … spells out: Was in den Zeichen nicht zum Ausdruck kommt,
das zeigt ihre Anwendung. Was die Zeichen verschlucken, das spricht ihre
Anwendung aus. It is hard to capture the aphoristic style and rhythm of
this; ‘verschlucken’ literally means ‘swallow’, and ‘aussprechen’ has
elsewhere been translated as ‘state’ (3.221, 4.116, 6.421, 6.5; see the
relevant notes). But here ‘hold back’ and ‘spell out’ seem more
appropriate, with the contrast captured by the ‘back’ and the ‘out’.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition … meaning. What we have here is a formulation
of what is now widely known as the context principle (first stated by
Frege in The Foundations of Arithmetic of 1884), and indeed Wittgenstein
himself explicitly requested that ‘Zusammenhang’ here be translated as
‘context’, not ‘connexion’ (LO, p. 24). But it is important to keep in
mind that it still retains the core meaning of ‘connection’, which is
how ‘Zusammenhang’ is best translated elsewhere (2.0122, 2.032, 2.15,
4.03, 4.22, 5.1311, 5.1362, 6.374), with the sole exception of 4.23,
where ‘context’ is also appropriate.</p>
<p>3.315 mean: meinen.</p>
<p>3.316 fixed … fixing. festgesetzt = fixed; Festsetzung = fixing.
Wittgenstein only uses these terms in 3.316, 3.317, and 5.501;
‘determined’ and ‘determination’ are alternative renderings, but these
terms have been reserved for ‘bestimmt’ and ‘Bestimmung’.</p>
<p>3.323 existence: Existenz. This is the first occurrence in the text
of the noun ‘Existenz’, which has been translated throughout as
‘existence’, which has only been used to translate ‘Existenz’ (see the
Glossary), despite the temptation to use it for other words such as
‘Bestehen’ (see e.g. the note to 2 above). 3.323 suggests that we should
indeed be careful here.</p>
<p>3.325 concept-script: Begriffsschrift. ‘Begriffsschrift’ is the name
that Frege gave to his logical notation.</p>
<p>3.326 senseful: sinnvoll. This is rendered as ‘significant’ in the
Ramsey–Ogden translation, which Wittgenstein said he thought was
‘alright’, explaining the meaning of the proposition as follows: ‘that
in order to recognize the symbol in a sign we must look at how this sign
is used significantly in propositions. I.e. we must observe how the sign
is used in accordance with the laws of logical syntax. Thus
“significant” here means as much as “syntactically correct”’ (LO,
p. 59). Reviving ‘senseful’ to capture ‘sinnvoll’ can do just the work
Wittgenstein has in mind, while preserving the links to the relevant
cognate terms; cf. the second note to 3.13 above.</p>
<p>3.328 not needed … Occam’s razor. nicht gebraucht = not needed; Sinn
= point. Occam’s razor, named after William of Ockham (c.1287–1347), is
the methodological principle ‘Do not multiply entities beyond
necessity’.</p>
<p>If everything … does have meaning: Wenn sich alles so verhält als
hätte ein Zeichen Bedeutung, dann hat es auch Bedeutung. Wittgenstein
himself suggested translating this as ‘If everything in the symbolism
works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning’ (LO, p. 39),
which is followed here but with ‘sign-language’ replacing ‘symbolism’
(which is how ‘Zeichensprache’ is translated by Ramsey and Ogden; see
the note to 4.011 below) and capturing the force of the ‘auch’. This is
an example of how Wittgenstein occasionally, as he put it, ‘made the
translation more explicit than the German text. (The original
translation was quite wrong.)’ (LO, p. 25) The choice of ‘works’ is a
particularly apt way to render ‘verhält sich’ and adding ‘in the
symbolism [sign-language]’ makes the idea more explicit.</p>
<p>3.331 This remark …‘theory of types’: Von dieser Bemerkung sehen wir
in Russells „Theory of types“ hinüber. Wittgenstein himself requested
‘into’ rather than ‘to’ in rendering ‘in’ here (LO, pp. 59, 64), but the
present translation offers a more fluent version than Ramsey and Ogden’s
(‘From this observation we get a further view—into Russell’s Theory of
Types’).</p>
<p>3.334 self-explanatory: sich von selbst verstehen. See the note to
6.2341 below.</p>
<p>3.3411 the real name … a name. der eigentliche Name = the real name;
Es würde sich so successive ergeben = It would thus progressively turn
out. What is meant by ‘successive’ here is something like ‘as more and
more examples of symbols are considered’.</p>
<p>3.3442 propositional structure: Satzgefüge. Cf. 4.442, which contains
the only other use of this term.</p>
<p>4.002 Language disguises thought … recognized. There is play here on
‘verkleidet’ (‘disguises’), ‘Kleid’ (‘clothing’), and ‘bekleidet’
(‘clothed’).</p>
<p>4.0031 Albeit not in Mauthner’s sense. The reference here is to the
work of Fritz Mauthner (1849–1923): Beiträge zu einer Kritik der Sprache
(Contributions to a Critique of Language), 3 vols. (Stuttgart: J. G.
Cotta, 1901–3).</p>
<p>4.01 as we conceive it: so wie wir sie uns denken.</p>
<p>4.011 sign-languages: Zeichensprachen. Wittgenstein gave both
‘sign-languages’ and ‘symbolisms’ as alternative translations here, but
expressed preference for the latter (LO, p. 25). But the former is more
literal and less misleading (given his distinction between sign and
symbol), and is adopted here and throughout.</p>
<p>4.014 Like the two youths … in the fairy tale. The reference here is
to ‘Die Goldkinder’, one of the Brothers Grimms’ fairy tales.</p>
<p>4.0141 That there is … record. When Wittgenstein finished the
Tractatus (more or less), there were around a hundred propositions left
over which he was still wondering whether to include or not; see the
account given in §5 of ‘Note on the Text’. In the end only one of these
supplementary propositions (number 72) was included, numbered 4.0141,
elaborating on 4.014. Wittgenstein provided his own translation of this
(LO, pp. 26, 40), which is followed here with some slight improvements
to the English.</p>
<p>4.015 The possibility of all similes, of the whole pictoriality of
our language: Die Möglichkeit aller Gleichnisse, der ganzen
Bildhaftigkeit unserer Ausdrucksweise. The translation of ‘Gleichnisse’
as ‘similes’ (rather than ‘likenesses’) and of ‘Ausdrucksweise’ as
‘language’ (lit., ‘means of expression’) were suggested (albeit
tentatively) by Wittgenstein (LO, p. 26). He also suggested (again,
tentatively) ‘imagery’ for ‘Bildhaftigkeit’, but ‘pictoriality’ is the
better term here, to resonate with all its cognate terms.</p>
<p>4.022 A proposition … stand. Wittgenstein suggested this translation,
and in particular, translating ‘wie es sich verhält’ as ‘how things
stand’. Ramsey and Ogden’s original translation had ‘how things are
connected’, to which Wittgenstein responded that the German phrase ‘is
quite a general expression for any fact; it does not mean things are
connected etc.’ (LO, p. 27). Cf. the second note to 4.023 and the note
to 4.5 below.</p>
<p>4.023 Reality must be fixed by a proposition to elicit either yes or
no: Die Wirklichkeit muß durch den Satz auf ja oder nein fixiert sein.
Wittgenstein wrote of this: ‘This prop[osition] I cannot translate’, but
offered the following explanation: ‘The meaning of it should be that a
prop[osition] determines reality such that by merely affirming or
denying it one can make it agree with reality. A prop[osition]
can〈n〉’t entirely determine reality for it al〈l〉ways can either be
true or false; but it can ONLY be true or false. That means the
prop[osition] determines reality so far that one only needs to say “yes”
or “no” to it, and nothing more, to make it agree with reality. It is
like fixing—say—a shelf on the wall with one nail and saying: now this
is fixed so far that I only need turn it this way or that way and it
will be right. What I have here underlined thus_____or something like it
might serve as a translation if nothing better is suggested’ (LO,
p. 27). The translation here has kept it simple and literal but adding
‘elicit’ to fill out the ‘auf’. Something like ‘so that all that is left
is’ could be inserted before ‘to elicit’ to reflect Wittgenstein’s
longer paraphrase.</p>
<p>A proposition … it is true: Der Satz konstruiert eine Welt mit Hilfe
eines logischen Gerüstes und darum kann man am Satz auch sehen, wie sich
alles Logische verhält, wenn er wahr ist. In commenting on this
proposition, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘“Es verhalt sich so und so” does not
mean “things are connected such and such” (see No 4.022) but it is a
general expression like “such and such is the case”! One might translate
it freely thus: “… and therefore one can actually see in the
prop[osition] all the logical features of reality if it is true”’ (LO,
p. 27). The present translation adopts Wittgenstein’s rendering of ‘wie
sich alles Logische verhält’ as ‘all the logical features of reality’.
Cf. the note to 4.022 above and the note to 4.5 below.</p>
<p>4.025 The translation … translated. Here it might be most natural to
translate the three occurrences of ‘Satz’ by ‘sentence’ rather than
‘proposition’. But in the interests of maximizing one–one correspondence
between ‘Satz’ and ‘proposition’ throughout the translation (so that the
German term can be read back), ‘proposition’ is used here, too. See the
notes to 2.0122 and 3.12 above.</p>
<p>4.026 we communicate: verständigen wir uns, lit., we make ourselves
understood, connecting with the use of ‘verstehen’ (‘understand’) in the
previous sentence.</p>
<p>4.0311 in this way the whole—like a tableau vivant—presents a
state-of-things. Here ‘tableau vivant’ translates ‘lebendes Bild’, lit.,
living picture, and ‘presents’ translates ‘stellt … vor’.</p>
<p>4.0312 The possibility … represented. Vertretung = representation;
vertreten = represent. In other contexts, ‘vertreten’ is translated as
‘stand for’, but this does not work here, and there is no noun in
English corresponding to the verb ‘stand for’.</p>
<p>4.04 Compare … Dynamical Models. This refers to the final section in
chapter 3 of Book II of Heinrich Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics, tr. D.
E. Jones and J. T. Walley (London: Macmillan, 1899).</p>
<p>4.0411 determine: feststellen. In agreeing this translation,
Wittgenstein notes that it has the sense of ‘discover’ here (LO,
p. 69).</p>
<p>4.063 a Fregean truth-value. According to Frege, the Bedeutung
(reference, meaning) of a proposition (Satz) is a truth-value, either
the True or the False, understood as (logical) objects. On his account,
propositions refer to truth-values just as names refer to objects.</p>
<p>4.112 a set of teachings: Lehre. Cf. the note to 6.13 below, where
logic is characterized in the same way.</p>
<p>Philosophy results … becoming clear: Das Resultat der Philosophie
sind nicht ‘philosophische Sätze’, sondern das Klarwerden von Sätzen.
This is a key proposition of the Tractatus, explaining his conception of
philosophy, but is hard to translate. ‘Klarwerden’ literally means
‘becoming clear’. Wittgenstein didn’t like ‘clarification’, which is
appropriate for ‘Klärung’ in the first sentence of 4.112 but not for
‘Klarwerden’. In comments sent to Ogden on 23 April 1922, he writes:
‘Couldn’t one say: “… but the get[t]ing clear of propositions.” Or is
this still more awkward?’ (LO, p. 28) To translate ‘das Klarwerden von
Sätzen’ as ‘the clarification of propositions’ (as Ramsey originally
did, and Pears and McGuinness do in their later translation) suggests
that the objective rather than subjective genitive is intended: the
result is getting clear about propositions. But what Wittgenstein
(arguably) means is the ‘becoming clear’ possessed or achieved by the
propositions themselves—for example, when they show their logical
structure through representation in an adequate logical notation. In
their revised version, Ramsey and Ogden render the phrase as ‘to make
propositions clear’, which is better, but the resultant sentence is
somewhat ungrammatical (‘The result of philosophy is not a number of
“philosophical propositions”, but to make propositions clear’). In an
exchange of letters with Ogden in May 1922, when he answered specific
questions that Ogden had asked him, Wittgenstein writes: ‘This seems to
me wrong now. I think it cannot be the RESULT of philosophy “to make
prop[ositions]s clear”: this can only be it〈’〉s TASK. The result must
be that the prop[ositions]s now have become clear that they ARE clear.
Or can your translation be understood in this way also? If so, it’s all
right. If not rather leave “clarification”. I sup[p]ose one can〈n〉’t
say “the clearing up”. Has this got a slightly different meaning?’ (LO,
p. 49) No changes were made in response to this, and when Wittgenstein
returned the proofs on 4 August 1922, he seems to have accepted the
translation of 4.112 as it then was: ‘If “to make” is better, please put
it in. The whole, of course, is a Zeugma and there ought to be a
substantive after “but” to match with “a number of …”. But I suppose
that can〈n〉’t be done’ (LO, p. 60). The present translation renders
‘das Klarwerden von Sätzen’ as ‘propositions becoming clear’, and in
beginning with ‘Philosophy results in …’ avoids the problem of the
zeugma.</p>
<p>4.114 It should delimit … the thinkable. abgrenzen = delimit;
begrenzen = limit. It is important to translate ‘abgrenzen’ and
‘begrenzen’ differently but connectedly (they are rendered the same in
both the Ramsey–Ogden and Pears–McGuinness translations, as ‘limit’ and
‘set limit’, respectively). ‘abgrenzen’ has more the meaning of
‘demarcate’—of one thing from something different, whereas ‘begrenzen’
just means drawing a Grenze (boundary or limit), either from within or
at any rate without specifying the ‘other side’; cf. 4.113. This
distinction is crucial in Wittgenstein’s thinking, as is made clear in
his preface.</p>
<p>4.115 indicate: bedeuten. ‘bedeuten’ has a wide range of meanings,
somewhat like ‘mean’ does in English, but the respective ranges do not
overlap exactly, so that ‘bedeuten’ is sometimes better translated by a
different English term. Here it (arguably) means something like
‘indicate’ or ‘point to’; ‘signify’ is another possible translation
(used by Pears and McGuinness), but this has been used consistently
throughout for ‘bezeichnen’ (and only ‘bezeichnen’). See the Glossary
for further details of how all the relevant terms have been
translated.</p>
<p>4.116 Everything that can be stated can be stated clearly. sich
aussprechen = state. Cf. 3.221, 6.421, and 6.5, where ‘state’ is also
used, and 3.262, where ‘spell out’ is used (and ‘state’ doesn’t work):
see the relevant notes.</p>
<p>4.121 It features it: er weist sie auf. See the note to 2.172
above.</p>
<p>4.126 real concepts: eigentliche Begriffe.</p>
<p>4.1272 pseudo-concept: Scheinbegriff. Wittgenstein suggested this
translation (LO, p. 29), as well as ‘pseudo-proposition’ for
‘Scheinsatz’, used later in 4.1272.</p>
<p>4.12721 primitive ideas: Grundbegriffe. The term literally means
‘basic concepts’, but the reference is to Russell’s talk of ‘primitive
ideas’ in Principia Mathematica (see esp. *1).</p>
<p>4.128 pre-eminent numbers: ausgezeichneten Zahlen. Ramsey had
originally translated this as ‘special numbers’, to which Wittgenstein
objected as not giving the right meaning: ‘What I meant was that in
Logic there are no numbers which are in any sense more important or of
any greater significance, in any sense preeminent, as compared with the
rest of numbers. Such for instance many believe that the number one is
such a number or the number 3. And if—for instance—there was in Logic a
definite number of primitive prop[ositions] or of primitive ideas—say
the number one or any other—then this number would have, in some sense,
to prevail all through logic and consequently also throughout
philosophy. It would then be a number more important than the rest, an
“ausgezeichnete Zahl”. I have put “preeminent” instead of special. If
this won’t do please alter it. (But don’t leave “special”.)’ (LO, p. 29)
The phrase is also used in 5.453 and 5.553.</p>
<p>4.221 propositional unity: Satzverband. This rendering makes explicit
that what is raised here is the problem of the unity of the proposition,
as it has come to be known. The use of ‘Verband’ (in ‘Satzverband’)
connects with the use of ‘Verbindung’ (‘combination’) in the previous
sentence.</p>
<p>4.23 context: Zusammenhang. Though ‘Zusammenhang’ is best translated
as ‘context’ here, there is a link to its use in 4.22, where it is
(correctly) translated as ‘connection’. See the note to 3.3. If one
wanted to bring out the link between 4.22 and 4.23, one could translate
4.23 as ‘A name occurs in a proposition only when connected in an
elementary proposition’.</p>
<p>4.241 means: heißt.</p>
<p>4.243 If I know … the same: Kenne ich etwa die Bedeutung eines
englischen und eines gleichbedeutenden deutschen Wortes, so ist es
unmöglich, daß ich nicht weiß, daß die beiden gleichbedeutend sind. Both
‘kennen’ and ‘wissen’ are here translated as ‘know’, and
‘gleichbedeutend’ translated by paraphrasing in terms of ‘meaning the
same’. ‘Kennen’ has something of the meaning of ‘be acquainted with’
here; cf. the notes to 2.0123 above and 6.2322 below.</p>
<p>4.411 From the outset: von vornherein. Wittgenstein makes clear (LO,
p. 29; cf. p. 31) that this does not mean ‘a priori’, and suggests
something like ‘from the very beginning’ or ‘even on first sight’
(adopted by Ramsey and Ogden, with ‘at’ replacing ‘on’), but ‘from the
outset’ seems better. Cf. the note to 5.43 below.</p>
<p>4.431 Frege … concept-script. See G. Frege, Begriffsschrift (Halle:
L. Nebert, 1879), §§5–7; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The Frege Reader
(Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 55–63.</p>
<p>4.442 Frege’s ‘judgement stroke’ … true. See G. Frege,
Begriffsschrift (Halle: L. Nebert, 1879), §2; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The
Frege Reader (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 52–3.</p>
<p>4.464 The truth … impossible. Wittgenstein’s comment on translating
this is instructive: ‘Here as in the preceding prop[osition] there is a
great difficulty about the use of “the”. I would rather leave it out
altogether before “tautology” and “contradiction”. But if this is
impossible rather put “a” instead of “the”. So 4.464 would be: “The
truth of tautology is certain, of propositions possible, of
contradiction impossible.” Here I have put “tautology” and
“contradiction” in the SINGULAR and “propositions” in the plural
deliberately because there are in fact no contradictions but there is
only contradiction, for they all mean the same, i.e. nothing. And the
same applies to tautology’ (LO, p. 30). On the general difficulty in
translating the definite articles in German, see the note to 2.02 above;
and cf. the note to 5.1361 below.</p>
<p>4.466 combination of symbols: Zeichenverbindung. This might most
naturally (and consistently with the uses elsewhere) be translated as
‘combination of signs’, but Wittgenstein specifically requested
‘symbols’ here (LO, pp. 60, 65), and this does seem to capture his
meaning better, as 4.4661 helps clarify.</p>
<p>4.5 such and such is the case: Es verhält sich so und so. In his
comments on the draft translation he was sent, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘This
is the only English expression I know for it. Perhaps one could say
“things stand such and such”. The expression must be one used in every
day language to express that something or other is the case’ (LO,
p. 30). Cf. the note to 4.022 and the second note to 4.023 above. The
phrase is also translated this way in 5.552.</p>
<p>5.101 The truth-functions … the following kind. The square brackets
at the end of (most of) the lines that follow were not in the original
German, but Wittgenstein wanted them added in the English translation,
with what is inside them being written in Russell’s symbolism, as in
Principia Mathematica (LO, pp. 30, 42, 60). He also explains that ‘The
expressions in words are not put in brackets except in the case of
tautology and contradiction where they have to stand in round brackets
as they do’ (LO, pp. 30–1). This was presumably to reflect the
‘senseless’ character of tautology and contradiction, as limiting cases
of propositions. Wittgenstein was very sensitive to issues of typography
and layout, and his wishes and instructions have been carefully followed
here.</p>
<p>5.1361 Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus: Der Glaube an
den Kausalnexus ist der Aberglaube [with ‘Aberglaube’ gesperrt,
i.e. with the letters more widely spaced, in the German text]. In
commenting on Ramsey’s original translation, Wittgenstein wrote:
‘“Belief in the causal nexus is superstition” isn’t right. It ought to
be: “Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus”. I didn’t mean to
say that the belief in the causal nexus was one amongst superstitions
but rather that superstition is nothing else than the belief in the
causal nexus. In the German this is expressed by the definite article
before “Aberglaube”’ (LO, p. 31). There is clearly a play here on
‘Glaube’ and ‘Aberglaube’, which cannot be captured in the English
translation. German words that are gesperrt are now generally italicized
in English translation, but Wittgenstein explicitly requested that
‘Superstition’ be left unitalicized.</p>
<p>5.1363 from a proposition’s being self-evident … its self-evidence:
daraus, dass ein Satz uns einleuchtet … das Einleuchten. Here ‘uns
einleuchtet’ literally means ‘is clear to us’ or ‘is evident to us’.</p>
<p>5.143 the empty point at their centre: ihr substanzloser
Mittelpunkt.</p>
<p>5.154 factum: Faktum. ‘Fact’ is used throughout this translation to
render ‘Tatsache’ and only ‘Tatsache’, which has a (semi-)technical
meaning for Wittgenstein and which he did not use here.</p>
<p>5.156 extract: Auszug.</p>
<p>5.43 is surely hard to believe: ist doch von vornherein kaum zu
glauben. In his comments on the original translation here, Wittgenstein
wrote: ‘“von vornherein” doesn’t mean “a priori” but something like
“from the very beginning” but here you had better leave it out
al〈l〉together’ (LO, p. 31). Cf. the note to 4.411 above.</p>
<p>primitive propositions: Grundgesetze, lit., basic laws. ‘Primitive
propositions’ is the term that Russell uses (see esp. Principia
Mathematica, *1), but ‘basic laws’ would also be an appropriate
translation in this context, alluding to Frege’s Grundgesetze der
Arithmetik, since both Frege and Russell are being discussed here. Cf.
5.452, where ‘primitive propositions’ is also used, and 6.127, where
‘basic laws’ is used instead: see the note to 6.127 below.</p>
<p>5.45 occurrence: Dasein.</p>
<p>5.451 what Frege said … primitive signs. See G. Frege, Grundgesetze
der Arithmetik (Jena: H. Pohle, vol. I 1893, vol. II 1903), I, §33; II,
§§58 ff.; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The Frege Reader (Oxford: Blackwell,
1997), 222–3, 260 ff.</p>
<p>5.452 in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica. See, for
example, A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell, Principia Mathematica
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1910–13; up to *56 repr. 1997),
94–7.</p>
<p>5.453 There are no pre-eminent numbers. See the note to 4.128
above.</p>
<p>5.454 juxtaposition: Nebeneinander, lit., next to one another. What
Wittgenstein is rejecting is any kind of genus/species differentiation
in logic, as the second sentence of 5.454 makes clear.</p>
<p>5.4541 simplex sigillum veri. The Latin means ‘simplicity is the sign
of truth’.</p>
<p>5.4733 constructed: gebildete. The verb ‘bilden’ is translated
throughout the 5s from this point on as ‘construct’. Elsewhere, with one
exception (4.002), it is translated as ‘form’ (see the Glossary).</p>
<p>5.501 fixing: Festsetzung. See the note to 3.316 above.</p>
<p>5.511 hooks and manipulations: Haken und Manipulationen.</p>
<p>5.521 separate = trenne. Wittgenstein comments on this in responding
to a question from Ogden: ‘I mean “separate” and not derive’. They were
connected and I separate them’ (LO, pp. 61, 65).</p>
<p>5.53 Identity … identity sign. Gleichheit = identity;
Gleichheitszeichen = identity sign. Elsewhere Wittgenstein talks of
‘Identität’, not ‘Gleichheit’ (as in 5.5301, which immediately follows;
see the Glossary). Presumably, preferring ‘Gleichheit’ here is to make
the connection with his use of ‘Gleichheitszeichen’; but it shows that
he treats ‘Identität’ and ‘Gleichheit’ (‘equality’) as synonymous (as
did Frege).</p>
<p>5.5351 Thus Russell … propositions. See B. Russell, The Principles of
Mathematics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1903), e.g. §§16,
41.</p>
<p>5.552 that such and such is the case: daß sich etwas so und so
verhält. See the note to 4.5 above.</p>
<p>5.553 There is no pre-eminent number. See the note to 4.128
above.</p>
<p>5.5542 what must there be in order that something can be-the-case?:
was muß sein, damit etwas der-Fall-sein kann? Wittgenstein’s own hyphens
have been retained here.</p>
<p>5.5563 All propositions … logical order. Wittgenstein explained this
key idea as follows: ‘By this I meant to say that the prop[ositions]s of
our ordinary language are not in any way logically less correct or less
exact or more confused than prop[ositions]s written down, say, in
Russell[’]s symbolism or any other “Begriffsschrift”. (Only it is easier
for us to gather their logical form when they are expressed in an
appropriate symbolism’ (LO, p. 50; cf. p. 53).</p>
<p>5.62 means: meint.</p>
<p>That the world … limits of my world: Daß die Welt meine Welt ist, das
zeigt sich darin, daß die Grenzen der Sprache (der Sprache, die allein
ich verstehe) die Grenzen meiner Welt bedeuten. There has been much
debate about the supposed ambiguity that hinges on the role of ‘allein’.
Does Wittgenstein mean ‘the only language that I understand’ or ‘the
language that only I understand’? Pears and McGuinness translated the
bracketed phrase as ‘of that language which alone I understand’, which
preserves something of the ambiguity, though suggests more the second
reading. Arguably, though, neither reading expresses Wittgenstein’s
meaning. Ramsey and Ogden translated the phrase as ‘the language which I
understand’, which may look as if it just omits the problematic
‘allein’, but which rather neatly captures the sense of ‘allein’ in the
italicized ‘the’. We know that Wittgenstein checked the translation of
5.62, because he comments (twice) on the first sentence (see LO, pp. 34,
44, 50, 53); but he raised no objections to the translation of this
third sentence. However, ‘the language which I understand’ reads
slightly oddly in English, so it has been simplified here, using the
demonstrative ‘that’ to single out the language I understand. In
referring to ‘the limits of language’, Wittgenstein is ‘only’ referring
to the language I understand, not ‘language in general’, as someone
might (mis)construe it.</p>
<p>5.631 There is no thinking, representing subject: Das denkende,
vorstellende, Subjekt gibt es nicht. A ‘vorstellendes Subjekt’ would be
a subject who has ‘Vorstellungen’ (representations, ideas). The allusion
here is to Schopenhauer’s work, The World as Will [Wille] and
Representation [Vorstellung].</p>
<p>5.6331 There has been a lot of controversy about the diagram here. In
virtually all editions of the Tractatus, from the original German
version and its first translation onwards, the eye is represented by a
small circle within the supposed visual field, albeit at its tapered
‘origin’. In fact, as is clear from Wittgenstein’s correspondence with
Ogden (LO, p. 20) and the manuscript sources, he intended it to be a
small circle outside the visual field, but connected so that the visual
field appears to spread out from the eye. Wittgenstein’s correction was
never made, however. (For the manuscript evidence, see L. Bazzocchi, ‘A
Significant “False Perception” of Wittgenstein’s Draft on Mind’s Eye’,
Acta Analytica, 29 (2014), 255–66.) Arguably, Wittgenstein’s point was
not (simply) the illegitimacy of taking the eye to be part of the visual
field, but of seeing the whole ‘form’ of the visual field as a bounded
space with some kind of ‘origin’ in an eye. (Cf. his claim in 6.4311
that ‘our visual field is limitless’.) This may account for why he did
not press Ogden—and later Ramsey—to correct the picture, as the exact
position of the eye, as long as it was recognizably at the ‘origin’ of
the visual field, was less important than the overall ‘form’ that the
visual field supposedly had.</p>
<p>6.111 the logical proposition. Here ‘jener Satz’, which literally
means ‘that proposition’, is translated as ‘the logical proposition’, to
make clear what is presumably the reference, the proposition ‘every
proposition is either true or false’.</p>
<p>6.121 zero-method: Nullmethode. Wittgenstein explains this as
follows: ‘“Nullmethode” in German is an expression used in physics;
when—for instance—you measure an electric resistance by regulating
another resistance until〈l〉 the galvanometer points to 0 again we call
this a “Nullmethode”. Now there is sure to be an English word for it;
but is it “null-method”? It should rather be “zero-method” but I don’t
know’ (LO, p. 34).</p>
<p>6.124 only the latter expresses: drückt nur dieses aus. This sounds
as (slightly) odd in German as it does in English. Wittgenstein explains
what he means in what immediately follows.</p>
<p>the nature of the absolutely necessary signs itself speaks: sagt die
Natur der naturnotwendigen Zeichen selbst aus. It is not easy to capture
in English the double use of ‘Natur’ here, nor the meaning of ‘sagt …
selbst aus’. Cf. the previous note and the first note to 6.53 below.</p>
<p>6.127 basic laws. Here ‘Grundgesetze’ is translated as ‘basic laws’,
as Frege is referred to in what follows, rather than ‘primitive
propositions’, which is Russell’s term. Cf. the note to 5.43 above.</p>
<p>6.13 Logic … the world. Lehre = set of teachings; Spiegelbild =
mirror image. On ‘Lehre’, cf. the note to 4.112 above, where philosophy
is characterized in the same way.</p>
<p>6.232 Frege says … sense. Frege distinguished between ‘Sinn’ and
‘Bedetung’ in his famous paper ‘Über Sinn und Bedeutung’ (1892). The
Bedeutung of an expression is what it denotes or refers to (an object in
the case of names, a concept or function in the case of concept-words or
function-terms, a truth-value in the case of sentences/propositions).
The Sinn of an expression is the ‘mode of determination’
(‘Bestimmungsweise’) or ‘mode of presentation’ (‘Art des Gegebenseins’)
of its Bedeutung. ‘Sinn’ is unproblematically rendered as ‘sense’, but
the translation of ‘Bedeutung’ has proved highly controversial (see M.
Beaney, ‘Translating “Bedeutung” in Frege’s Writings’, in P. Ebert and
M. Rossberg (eds.), Essays on Frege’s Basic Laws of Arithmetic (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2019), 603–51). Since ‘Bedeutung’ has generally
been rendered as ‘meaning’ in this translation of the Tractatus,
‘Bedeutung’ is also used here.</p>
<p>6.2322 in knowing their meaning, I know whether = indem ich ihre
Bedeuting kenne, weiss ich, ob. Both ‘kennen’ and ‘wissen’ here are
translated as ‘know’. Cf. the notes to 2.0123 and 4.243 above.</p>
<p>6.233 intuition: Anschauung. ‘Anschauung’ is a tricky term to
translate into English, but ‘intuition’ is appropriate here as
Wittgenstein is referring to a debate that is indeed described by
talking of ‘intuition’. In his answer to the question he raises,
followed up in 6.2331, however, he could be seen as subtly
(recommending) changing the meaning of ‘intuition’ by playing more on
other aspects of the meaning of ‘Anschauung’. Cf. the translation of
‘anschaulich’ as ‘perspicuous’ in 6.1203.</p>
<p>6.2341 self-explanatory: sich von selbst verstehen. The German phrase
has arguably two main meanings, one of which might be captured as
‘self-evident’ (as used in the Ramsey–Ogden translation), and the other
as ‘go without saying’ (as used in the Pears–McGuinness translation),
where there might be some implicit—but external—norm. The former does
not fit with Wittgenstein’s talk of a method here, and the norm
presupposed by mathematics is internal, not external; so it has been
translated here as ‘self-explanatory’, which has something of both
meanings. Interestingly, in the draft typescript on which Wittgenstein
added comments, ‘self-intelligible’ is used (LO, p. 54+vii); it is
unclear when and by whom this was changed to ‘self-evident’. The phrase
is also used in 3.334.</p>
<p>6.3 regularity: Gesetzmäßigkeit. The allusion is to Hertz: see the
note to 6.361 below.</p>
<p>6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law. In the
only footnote added to the Ramsey–Ogden translation (other than the one
about the numbering system right at the beginning), we find this remark:
‘I.e. not the form of one particular law, but of any law of a certain
sort (B. R.)’. The ‘B. R.’ shows that it was Bertrand Russell who added
this. It is somewhat bizarre that this was the only one he selected for
explanation in the text!</p>
<p>6.3431 Through their whole logical apparatus: Durch den ganzen
logischen Apparat. This is hard to translate, but Wittgenstein insisted
on ‘through’: ‘Instead of “throughout” it must be “through”. The word is
used here in the same sense as when I say “I speak through a tube” or “I
hear his voice through the wall” etc.’ (LO, p. 35).</p>
<p>6.361 regular connections: gesetzmäßige Zusammenhänge. The use of
‘gesetzmäßige’ picks up on ‘Gesetz’ (‘law’) in 6.36, so ‘law-governed’
might be an appropriate translation, but Wittgenstein (LO, p. 35) wanted
its rendering to reflect the standard English translation in Hertz’s
Principles of Mechanics (see the reference to this in the note to 4.04
above). ‘Regular’ keeps the connotation of being ‘regulated’ by
‘rules’.</p>
<p>6.372 People thus stop … as if they were sacrosanct: So bleiben sie
bei den Naturgesetzen als bei etwas Unantastbarem stehen. In criticizing
the choice of ‘hold fast to’ in Ramsey’s original translation,
Wittgenstein wrote: ‘it should be something like: “So people stop at the
natural laws as at something …”. The prop[osition] means that people
don’t enquire any further, their investigations STOP there as if they
now had explained everything’ (LO, p. 35).</p>
<p>6.421 cannot be stated: nicht aussprechen läßt. The verb
‘aussprechen’ is also translated as ‘state’ in 3.221, 4.116, and 6.5.
Cf. 3.262, where ‘spell out’ is used, and 6.522. See the relevant notes
to these.</p>
<p>6.423 bearer of the ethical: Träger des Ethischen. ‘Träger’ can mean
‘responsible agent’, so the phrase could be translated, more fully, as
‘bearer of responsibility for the ethical’.</p>
<p>6.4311 experienced: erlebt. There is play on ‘Leben’ (‘life’) and
‘erlebt’.</p>
<p>6.4312 Not only … space and time. Wittgenstein admitted the
difficulties in translating this paragraph. He explained what he meant
by the first sentence as follows: ‘If for instance one tries to prove a
proposition in Physics we make certain assumptions and hope that they
will do our business, i.e. that they will prove the point in question,
i.e. that from them our proposition will follow. Now if we find that it
doesn’t follow then what we will say about our assumptions is exactly
what I tried to express. I think one would say something like: “These
assumptions will not do our business” or “they will not prove what we
tried to prove with them”’ (LO, pp. 35–6). He also remarks on the
difficulty in translating ‘Rätsel’, noting that it has two meanings in
German, an ordinary meaning, as illustrated in questions such as ‘Why is
a raven like a writing desk?’, and a ‘higher meaning’, as he puts it, as
when we talk of ‘das Rätsels des Lebens’. He asks Ogden: ‘Now do you use
“riddle” in this second sense also? IF SO, IT IS QUITE RIGHT. Only I
don’t w〈h〉ish that there should be anything ridiculous or profane or
frivolous in the word when used in the connection “riddle of life” etc.’
(LO, p. 36). ‘Riddle’ does indeed have these two meanings in English,
too, so is an appropriate translation. Wittgenstein also uses the
adjective ‘rätselhaft’ in this paragraph, but this has been translated
as ‘mysterious’, since ‘riddlesome’ would be inappropriate, not least in
having rather less of the ‘higher meaning’.</p>
<p>6.5 stated: aussprechen. Cf. 3.221, 4.116, and 6.421, where ‘state’
is also used; 3.262, which has ‘spell out’; and 6.522: see the relevant
notes.</p>
<p>the riddle. Wittgenstein insisted that ‘the’ be italicized and not
just ‘riddle’, commenting that ’It means as much as “the riddle ‘par
excellence’” (LO, p. 37).</p>
<p>6.521 the meaning of life: der Sinn des Lebens.</p>
<p>6.522 There is, though, the ineffable: Es gibt allerdings
Unaussprechliches. ‘Unaussprechliches’ comes from ‘aussprechen’, which
has generally been translated as ‘state’, with the exception of 3.262,
which has ‘spell out’ (see the relevant note above).</p>
<p>6.53 to say nothing except what can be said, that is, propositions of
natural science = Nichts zu sagen, als was sich sagen lässt, also Sätze
der Naturwissenschaft. The phrase ‘was sich sagen lässt’ is most
naturally translated into English as ‘what can be said’, but it
literally means ‘what lets itself say’, illustrating what grammarians
call the ‘middle’ or ‘medium’ voice—as opposed to the ‘active’ or
‘passive’ voice. Recognizing this makes better sense of how Wittgenstein
goes on, in suggesting that what let themselves say are the propositions
of natural science. If he had strictly meant ‘what cannot be said’, he
could have written ‘was gesagt werden kann’ (a construction he uses, for
example, in 4.1212). The middle voice is arguably present, in slightly
different forms, at various points in the Tractatus—for example, in
talking in 6.124 of what ‘expresses’ or ‘itself speaks’ in logic
(cf. the notes to 6.124 above). For detailed discussion, in relation to
the whole idea of ‘showing’, see J.-P. Narboux, ‘Showing, the Medium
Voice, and the Unity of the Tractatus’, Philosophical Topics, 42.2
(2014), 201–62.</p>
<p>whenever someone else … their propositions. This is the first time in
the Tractatus (interesting in itself) in which ‘er’ is used as a generic
third-person singular pronoun (as opposed to being used to refer to a
particular person, such as Russell in 3.331). It is translated here (and
in 6.54) by the generic third-person pronoun ‘they’, which also has a
long-established use as a singular and not just a plural pronoun,
despite false claims (often by those with a sexist agenda) that this is
ungrammatical. (Consider e.g. ‘Every philosopher knows their
Wittgenstein’.) But some generic singular uses of ‘they’ are more
natural than others, although those others are becoming more natural as
more writers avoid unnecessarily gendered language. Wittgenstein almost
certainly had mainly (and perhaps only) men in mind here, but that is no
reason for accentuating the gendering in English, when English has the
resources for avoiding it and is not generally such a gendered language
as German. So ‘they’ and ‘them’ have been used here for ‘er’, ‘ihn’, and
‘ihm’.</p>
<p>6.54 My propositions elucidate when …: Meine Sätze erläutern dadurch,
daß … Ramsey’s original translation of this had run ‘My propositions are
explained in that …’, which Wittgenstein changed to ‘My propositions
elucidate in this way that …’. Ogden then suggested replacing
‘elucidate’ by ‘are elucidated’, on the ground that ‘elucidate’ does not
have an intransitive use (LO, pp. 54, 54+viii). Wittgenstein replied as
follows: ‘Here you misunderstand my meaning entirely. I didn’t mean to
use “elucidate” intransitive[ly]: what I meant to say was: My
prop[osition]s elucidate—whatever they do elucidate—in this way: etc.
Similarly I might have said “My prop[osition]s clarify in this way …”
meaning “My prop[osition]s clarify whatever they do clarify—say, the
prop[osition]s of natural science—in this way: …”. Here clarify is not
used intransitive[ly] al〈l〉though the object is not mentioned. You may
put it thus: “My prop[osition]s elucidate philosophic matters in this
way: …”. This is something like the right meaning. Or “My prop[osition]s
are elucidations in this way: …” but this I suppose is bad. If nothing
better is suggested and my first way of putting it real[l]y won’t do add
“philosophic matters” as above’ (LO, p. 51). Ogden changed ‘elucidate’
to ‘are elucidatory’, so that the published version became: ‘My
propositions are elucidatory in this way: …’. The present translation
stays closer to Wittgenstein’s formulation in German and his original
suggestion in English but simplifying by replacing ‘in this way’ by
‘when’, since ‘elucidate’ seems to work exactly like ‘erläutern’ does:
in its ‘intransitive’ use there is an implicit object, and it is the
propositions themselves that are being said to do the elucidating, as
opposed to just having the property of being ‘elucidatory’. It is also
worth noting that Wittgenstein does not question here the translation of
‘Sätze’ by ‘propositions’. Given that ‘philosophical propositions’ are
to be recognized as nonsensical, on his view, it might be recommended
that we translate ‘Sätze’ by ‘sentences’ instead. But perhaps the very
use of ‘propositions’ here is precisely one of those things that he goes
on to say we must ‘get over’; indeed, it is surely symbolic of what it
is we have to get over to ‘see the world correctly’.</p>
<p>6.54 They must get over these propositions, and then they see the
world correctly. überwinden = get over. ‘Er’ has again been translated
here as ‘they’ (see the second note to 6.53 above). It is obvious that
‘they’ does not refer to Wittgenstein’s propositions.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent: Wovon man
nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen. This was translated by
Ramsey and Ogden as ‘Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent’, which has become canonical, though it is too archaic for the
present translation. What it literally says is ‘Of what one cannot
speak, about that one must be silent’, which might be rephrased as ‘Of
what one cannot speak, one must be silent about’ or ‘About what one
cannot speak of, one must be silent’, but none of these seem elegant
enough for the concluding proposition of what is a carefully crafted
work. ‘About that of which one cannot speak, one must be silent’ might
seem better, but the ‘that’ suggests a definiteness, of what it is that
one cannot speak of, which is absent in the German (it prompts the
question as to what exactly it is). Pears and McGuinness translated it
as ‘What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence’, which is a
neat way of avoiding a dangling preposition as the very last word, or
two prepositions in the first clause, although there is no sense of
‘passing over’ in the German and ‘of’ is arguably better than ‘about’
here. Wittgenstein also uses ‘man’ rather than ‘wir’, which he could
have chosen had he wanted to be less impersonal and more inclusive.
After all, he has just said a lot, so it seems, about what cannot be
spoken of, on his view, so it would be ironic if he were then to say
that we (including him) must be silent. Perhaps he was deliberately
being ironic, but making him say ‘we’ to reflect this would be injecting
an interpretation into the translation.</p>
<p>A looser rendering would be ‘Where one cannot speak, one must be
silent’, leaving the reference of ‘where’ to be indicated by the
context, in other words, as—arguably, at least partly—referring back to
‘the ineffable’ mentioned in 6.522. This suggests another possible
translation: ‘About the ineffable one must be silent’. But this would
also be injecting an interpretation into the translation, even more
explicitly. If we were to allow the back reference (or references) to be
merely implied, however, then the final proposition could be transformed
into something more appropriately aphoristic: ‘Where speaking is
impossible, silence is imperative.’ But this sacrifices some
faithfulness for fluency (and a literary style that is not really
Wittgenstein’s), and it is better to end on either ‘silent’ or ‘silence’
than on an imperious-sounding ‘imperative’.</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness’s translation ended on ‘silence’, so we could
revisit their strategy and amend in line with the points just made:
using ‘of’ rather than ‘about’ and the passive construction to capture
the more impersonal use of ‘man’, and replacing ‘pass over’ by a
different verb, ideally one that is as neutral as possible. One
possibility here would be ‘accept’, yielding ‘What cannot be spoken of
must be accepted in silence’. But even ‘accept’ draws some attention to
itself and is not in the German: it is not itself ‘silent’ on the
attitude we should take to what cannot be spoken of. If we were tempted
to interpret Wittgenstein here, though, then ‘respect’ or ‘acknowledge’
might be appropriate. ‘What cannot be spoken of must be acknowledged in
silence’ is arguably better than Pears and McGuinness’s rendering. But
all of these involve interpretation, and this should especially be
avoided in the case of proposition 7, not just because it is the final,
dramatic conclusion, but also because there has been so much controversy
over the issues it raises.</p>
<p>Can we find a solution to these problems of translation by
considering the corresponding remark in Wittgenstein’s preface? In
stating what the whole sense of the book is, he first says that ‘what
can be said at all can be said clearly’ (was sich überhaupt sagen läßt,
läßt sich klar sagen), and then adds ‘wovon man nicht reden kann,
darüber muß man schweigen’. This is exactly proposition 7, but with
‘reden’ instead of ‘sprechen’. So Wittgenstein is clearly treating
‘reden’ and ‘sprechen’ as synonyms. But ‘sagen’ (‘say’) is also a member
of the cluster of verbs concerned with ‘speaking’, and can be used as a
synonym in certain contexts. Here it would have the advantage that it
does not need a preposition (‘of’ or ‘about’), so we could avoid any
problem of a dangling preposition or too many prepositions.
Wittgenstein’s use of ‘reden’ in his preface might be seen as just a
stylistic variant (fitting the aphoristic structure of ‘wovon … darüber
…’), and the following might therefore sound perfectly natural in
English here: ‘what can be said at all can be said clearly; and about
what cannot be said, one must be silent’. So could we simply adopt this,
too, for proposition 7? The problem, though, is that ‘what cannot be
said’ does not mean the same as ‘what cannot be spoken (or talked) of’,
although it is not easy to say what the subtle differences are (as
Wittgenstein seems to understand the relevant terms)! In 4.1212 he
writes: ‘What can be shown cannot be said.’ This does not say that what
cannot be said can be shown, but some at least of what cannot be said
can be shown. And what is shown is shown through language. (See
e.g. 4.115, 4.121.) So Wittgenstein cannot be taken as recommending that
we must simply be silent about what cannot be said. In any case the
phrase that is translated in the preface as ‘what can be said’ is not
‘was gesagt werden kann’ but ‘was sich sagen läßt’, which literally
means ‘what lets itself be said’. But rephrasing our suggested
translation of the second clause accordingly as ‘about what does not let
itself be said, one must be silent’ would yield a very strange remark.
The contrast between ‘what can be said’ and ‘what cannot be said’ in the
suggested English translation would not capture the actual German. So
here, too, we encounter problems.</p>
<p>After considering all the options, then, the only solution is to keep
the translation as literal as possible. Avoiding the archaic terms
‘whereof’ and ‘thereof’, and either dangling prepositions or two
prepositions in the first clause, leaves just one option: ‘Of what one
cannot speak, about that one must be silent’. The present translation,
throughout, has aimed to maximize both faithfulness and fluency, staying
as close as possible to what Wittgenstein actually says while rendering
it in (modern) English as clearly and naturally as possible. Some
fluency and elegance may sometimes have to be sacrificed for
faithfulness, as in this case, but at least we preserve here the rhythm
and symmetry of the ‘wovon … darüber …’ construction, and the German
original is directly echoed. Where translation is tricky, though,
explanation is expected (and speaking imperative). The final proposition
of the Tractatus provides an instructive case study in the problems of
translation and interpretation. Here, at the end, it is only right to
remind the reader that a translation is only a ladder to understanding
the original text and that there is value in considering variant forms
of expression.</p>
