<h4 id="life-and-works">1. Life and works</h4>
<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on 26 April 1889, the youngest
of eight children, the oldest—Hermine—being fifteen years older than
him. His father was the industrialist Karl Wittgenstein (1847–1913), one
of the wealthiest men in Austria, and his mother was Leopoldine (Poldy)
Wittgenstein (born Kalmus, 1850–1926), who was musically gifted and made
music central to the Wittgenstein household. They were important patrons
of the arts in Viennese society and hosted many concerts in their house.
Music was an important part of Ludwig’s life, and there are comparisons
between written language and musical notation in the Tractatus. But he
wrote little specifically about music, on the ground that such things
should be allowed to speak for themselves. As he later put it, ‘Music
conveys to us itself !’ (BB, p. 178) This idea that certain things
‘speak for themselves’ was fundamental to his philosophy throughout his
life.</p>
<p>Ludwig had three sisters and four brothers. The three oldest brothers
all committed suicide: Hans in 1902, Rudolf in 1904, and Kurt in 1918,
who shot himself rather than surrender to the Italians at the end of the
First World War. Paul Wittgenstein became a well-known pianist, who lost
his right arm in the war but carried on playing with just his left hand.
Ravel later wrote his Concerto for the Left Hand for him. As well as
Hermine, who gradually took over the role of organizing the family, his
sisters were Margarete (Gretl), who was to marry the wealthy American
Jeremy Stonborough and have her wedding portrait painted by Klimt, and
Helene (Lenka), who married Max Salzer and whose daughter Clara married
Ludwig’s later close friend Arvid Sjögren. It was for Margarete that
Ludwig was to design what is now known as the Wittgenstein house in
Vienna in the late 1920s.</p>
<p>Ludwig was educated at home until 1903, when his father changed his
views on how his children should be taught after the death of Hans (but
sadly too late for Rudolf) and sent Ludwig to a Realschule (which
offered a more practical education than a Gymnasium) in Linz. (Adolf
Hitler, who was just six days older than Wittgenstein, also attended
this school from 1900 to 1904, but Hitler was a year behind his year
group and Wittgenstein was a year ahead.) He stayed there until 1906,
when he went to study science and engineering at the technical
university in Berlin, gaining his diploma in May 1908. From there he
moved to Manchester to pursue research in aeronautical engineering,
helping to design a jet engine. It was here that he read Bertrand
Russell’s Principles of Mathematics (1903) and Gottlob Frege’s Basic
Laws of Arithmetic (1893, 1903) and became interested in the foundations
of mathematics, intrigued by the paradox that Russell found in Frege’s
system (see below). In 1909 he wrote to Philip Jourdain, a colleague of
Russell’s at Cambridge, offering a solution to the paradox. Having shown
it to Russell, Jourdain wrote back criticizing the attempted solution,
which discouraged Wittgenstein for a while, but by then the fascination
had taken root and he gradually became more and more obsessed by
philosophical questions.</p>
<p>Having written to Frege in the summer of 1911, Wittgenstein was
invited to visit him in Jena, which he did a few weeks later.
Wittgenstein is reported as saying: ‘At this first meeting with Frege my
own ideas were so unclear that he was able to wipe the floor with me.’
Frege nevertheless encouraged him to come again, and advised him to
study with Russell at Cambridge.1 So it was that Russell got a knock on
his college door on 18 October and the lives of both men changed
dramatically. Wittgenstein attended Russell’s lectures that term,
unofficially, and had discussions with him. He officially registered as
a research student at Trinity College on 1 February 1912 to work with
Russell, and met him regularly until October 1913, when he went to
Norway to work in isolation on the philosophical problems that occupied
him. He visited Frege twice more, on his way back to Vienna from
Cambridge in December 1912 and again in December 1913, on his way back
from Norway, and had fruitful discussions with him. In March 1914 G. E.
Moore (1873–1958), then a lecturer at Cambridge, visited Wittgenstein in
Norway and took notes of the ideas that he had been formulating. These,
together with notes that Wittgenstein had dictated for Russell before he
left for Norway, have survived and shed important light on the
development of his ideas.2</p>
<p>On the outbreak of the First World War Wittgenstein decided to enlist
in the Austrian army and he served both on the front line, winning
awards for bravery, and in an artillery workshop. Throughout the war he
continued to work out his ideas, writing remarks in notebooks, several
of which also survived and were published in 1961 as Notebooks
1914–1916. He had periods of leave in which he selected some of these
remarks and arranged and revised them into what became the Tractatus,
which was essentially complete before he returned at the end of
September 1918 to the Italian Front, where he was captured in early
November 1918 as the war ended. He spent the next ten months in Italian
prisoner-of-war camps, but managed to get a corrected copy of his
manuscript sent to Russell. He was finally released in August 1919, and
met with Russell at The Hague in December 1919 to explain his ideas to
him and enlist his support in getting the Tractatus published, which
eventually appeared in 1921. (For further details of the composition of
the Tractatus and the difficulties Wittgenstein had in getting it
published, see §4 below and the Note on the Text.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein returned to Vienna from the war a changed man. His
father had died in 1913 and he had received a substantial inheritance.
Before the war he had arranged for some of it to be given to various
writers and artists, among them Rainer Maria Rilke, Georg Trakl, and
Oskar Kokoschka, but in 1919 he formally signed all the rest of it over
to his siblings Hermine, Helene, and Paul (Margarete was excluded,
having married into further wealth). From that point on he lived
frugally, often depending, later, on friends to look after him. More
importantly, consistent with his claim in the Tractatus that he had
solved all the problems of philosophy, he gave up philosophy and decided
to become a schoolteacher. Having trained in Vienna, he then taught at
various remote village schools in Lower Austria from 1920 to 1926. Frank
Ramsey (1903–30) visited him twice during this period to discuss the
ideas of the Tractatus with him, and Wittgenstein visited Manchester and
Cambridge in the summer of 1925, but other than this he had limited
philosophical contact. Having been accused of ill-treating some of the
children in the school in which he was then teaching (but subsequently
cleared) in April 1926, Wittgenstein resigned and returned to Vienna.
From 1926 to 1928 he helped design and supervise the building of a house
for his sister Margarete, a house influenced by the modernism of Adolf
Loos (1870–1933) and reflecting Wittgenstein’s own personality, with its
austerity, precision, and attention to detail.</p>
<p>It was during this period that he was also gradually drawn back into
philosophy by meetings with members of the Vienna Circle, a group that
had been formed around Moritz Schlick (1882–1936) to discuss philosophy,
especially philosophy of science and epistemology. Schlick was Professor
of Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature) in Vienna, and the group
became known as the logical positivists (or logical empiricists), famous
for their rejection of metaphysics and for their endorsement of a
‘scientific’ approach to philosophy. The logical positivists, who
included Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), Otto Neurath (1882–1945), and
Friedrich Waismann (1896–1959), were strongly influenced by the
Tractatus, which they had discussed in detail in the mid-1920s, seeing
in Wittgenstein—at least in some respects—a kindred spirit.3 Another
event that played a role in Wittgenstein’s return to philosophy was a
lecture given by the mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881–1966) in
Vienna in March 1928 on intuitionism, which inspired Wittgenstein to
think more deeply about logic and mathematics.</p>
<p>In January 1929 Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge and took up
philosophy again, gradually recognizing the problems in his earlier
views and determined to address them. One of the first results of this
work was ‘Some Remarks on Logical Form’, in which he tried to resolve
one of these problems (see §6.1 below). This paper was published in the
proceedings of the annual conference of the Aristotelian Society and
Mind Association, held in July 1929, although at the conference itself
Wittgenstein talked about something else instead—generality and infinity
in mathematics (WC, p. 172). The paper ended up being not only the first
thing he published after the Tractatus but also the last in his
lifetime. Although he remained occupied with philosophical problems for
the rest of his life, continuing his practice of writing remarks in
notebooks and selecting and revising them into typescripts, he was never
satisfied with what he produced, and nothing more was published until
after his death in 1951.</p>
<p>One such typescript was Philosophical Remarks, not published until
1975, which he wrote for his successful application for a five-year
research fellowship at Trinity College, awarded in December 1930. Here
he began to criticize some of his earlier ideas and develop new forms of
thinking. This was carried forward in all his subsequent writings, from
Philosophical Grammar (published in 1974, dating from 1930–3) and The
Blue and Brown Books (published in 1958, dating from 1933–5) to On
Certainty (published in 1969, dating from the last years of his life,
1949–51). The most famous of all his later works is Philosophical
Investigations, drafts of which he had ready to submit at various points
in the 1940s, but which remained unpublished on his death. It finally
appeared, translated by Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001), who had studied
with Wittgenstein, in 1953. This has often been seen as the mature
statement of his so-called ‘later philosophy’, but few scholars now are
happy with this division of Wittgenstein’s philosophy into ‘early’ and
‘later’. Some have spoken of a ‘middle Wittgenstein’, between the
Tractatus and the Investigations, or of a ‘third Wittgenstein’,
reflected in his work after the Investigations was essentially finished,
represented in On Certainty, among other writings. But the truth is that
Wittgenstein’s ideas evolved continually from 1929, deepening his
critique of the Tractatus and developing a whole range of new ideas,
themes, concerns, and methods, not least in responding to the views of
his contemporaries and earlier thinkers.</p>
<p>During his research fellowship Wittgenstein gave lectures at
Cambridge, on diverse topics from logic and the foundations of
mathematics to aesthetics and religious belief. Notes were made and have
since been published on many of these lectures, and there are numerous
first-hand reports of his lecturing style. Norman Malcolm (1911–90), for
example, who attended his lectures in 1939, writes in his Memoir:</p>
<p>His lectures were given without preparation and without notes. He
told me that once he had tried to lecture from notes but was disgusted
with the result; the thoughts that came out were ‘stale’, or, as he put
it to another friend, the words looked like ‘corpses’ when he began to
read them. In the method that he came to use his only preparation for
the lecture, as he told me, was to spend a few minutes before the class
met, recollecting the course that the inquiry had taken at the previous
meetings. At the beginning of the lecture he would give a brief summary
of this and then he would start from there, trying to advance the
investigation with fresh thoughts. He told me that the only thing that
made it possible for him to conduct his lecture classes in this
extemporaneous way was the fact that he had done and was doing a vast
amount of thinking and writing about all the problems under discussion.
This is undoubtedly true; nevertheless, what occurred in these class
meetings was largely new research.4</p>
<p>In 1936, after his research fellowship had come to an end,
Wittgenstein decided to return to Norway, and he stayed there from
August 1936 to December 1937, with short breaks back in Vienna and
Cambridge. This was when he wrote a draft of the first 188 sections of
the Investigations, and what became Part I of Remarks on the Foundations
of Mathematics (published in 1967, dating from 1937–44), which had
originally been conceived as continuing his discussion in the
Investigations. He returned to Vienna afterwards but left before the
annexation (Anschluss) of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938, when he
was forced to choose between applying for German citizenship (as an
Austrian) or British citizenship. German citizenship was problematic for
the Wittgenstein family because of their Jewish ancestry. While Ludwig’s
maternal grandmother came from an established Austrian Catholic family,
his other grandparents had been born into Jewish families, although his
maternal grandfather had been brought up as a Catholic and both of his
paternal grandparents had converted to Protestantism before they
married. Ludwig decided to go back to lecturing at Cambridge and apply
for British citizenship, and in both of these he was helped by John
Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), the Cambridge economist, who was able to
pull the necessary strings.</p>
<p>In February 1939 Wittgenstein succeeded Moore as Professor of
Philosophy at Cambridge, which secured his British citizenship, gained
in June 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War.
Throughout 1939 he lectured on the foundations of mathematics, lectures
that were attended by Alan Turing (1912–54), the mathematician and
computer scientist, and he continued to teach until 1941, when he was
allowed to contribute to the war effort, working, first, as a porter in
Guy’s Hospital, London, and then in a medical research unit
investigating ‘wound shock’ in Newcastle upon Tyne. In February 1944 he
was called back to Cambridge to work on his book, but was allowed to do
so in Swansea, where one of his students, Rush Rhees (1905–89), was
teaching. He resumed lecturing in the autumn, this time on the
philosophy of psychology, developing further his ideas in the
Investigations. By the middle of 1946, he finally finished what came to
form Part I of the Investigations, and wrote the preface. But the book
was still not submitted for publication, as he continued to develop his
ideas, material that became Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology
(published in 1980, dating from 1945–8).</p>
<p>In 1947 he resigned from his chair at Cambridge. He had never been
happy as a professional philosopher, and over the years he had grown
increasingly disillusioned with academic life. He spent time in Ireland
(in Galway and Dublin) and the United States (staying with Malcolm at
Cornell), before returning to Cambridge where he was diagnosed with
cancer of the prostate in November 1949. He stayed for a while in Oxford
with Anscombe in 1950, but as his health deteriorated, he moved back to
Cambridge to be looked after in the house of his doctor, Edward Bevan.
In his last letter to Malcolm, dated 16 April 1951, he wrote:</p>
<p>An extraordinary thing has happened to me. About a month ago I
suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I
had been absolutely certain that I’d never again be able to do it. It’s
the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has
gone up.—Of course, so far I’ve only worked for about 5 weeks and it may
be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now. (WC, p. 479)</p>
<p>He died a fortnight later, on 29 April 1951. The last entry in his
notebook, in which he reflects on whether one can claim to be dreaming
while drugged (OC, §676), was dated 27 April 1951.</p>
