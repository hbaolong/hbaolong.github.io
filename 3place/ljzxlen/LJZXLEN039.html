<p>The Tree Structure of the Main Propositions of the Tractatus</p>
<p>Top-level</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
<p>Second-level</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case. 1.1 The world is the
totality of facts, not of things.</p>
<p>1.2 The world divides into facts.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things. 2.1
We picture facts.</p>
<p>2.2 A picture has the logical form of depiction in common with what
is depicted.</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought. 3.1 In a proposition a
thought is expressed perceptibly.</p>
<p>3.2 In a proposition a thought can be so expressed that to the
objects of the thought correspond elements of the propositional
sign.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a
proposition does a name have meaning.</p>
<p>3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence
of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituents
themselves, by the existence of the senseful proposition.</p>
<p>3.5 A propositional sign as applied in thinking is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition. 4.1 A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with
the possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement
with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.</p>
<p>4.5 It now appears possible to specify the most general propositional
form: that is, to give a description of the propositions of any
sign-language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol
that fits the description, and that every symbol that fits the
description can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen
accordingly.</p>
<p>It is clear that in the description of the most general propositional
form only what is essential to it may be described—since otherwise it
would not be the most general.</p>
<p>That there is a general propositional form is demonstrated by this:
that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been
foreseen (i.e. constructed). The general form of a proposition is: such
and such is the case.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) 5.1 The
truth-functions can be ordered in series. This is the foundation of
probability theory.</p>
<p>5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one
another.</p>
<p>5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from
elementary propositions.</p>
<p>It is of the essence of a truth-operation that, in the same way as
elementary propositions give rise to their truth-function,
truth-functions give rise to a new one. Every truth-operation generates,
from truth-functions of elementary propositions, another truth-function
of elementary propositions, a proposition. The result of every
truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions is also the result of one truth-operation on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>5.4 This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical
constants’ (in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</p>
<p>5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of
the operation (– – – – – T)(ξ,….) to elementary propositions.This
operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets
and I call it the negation of these propositions.</p>
<p>5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition. 6.1 The propositions of logic are
tautologies.</p>
<p>6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics
are equations, that is, pseudo-propositions.</p>
<p>6.3 The investigation of logic means the investigation of all
regularity. And outside logic all is accident.</p>
<p>6.4 All propositions are of equal value.</p>
<p>6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be
stated. There is no such thing as the riddle. If a question can be posed
at all, then it can also be answered.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
