<h4 id="the-main-structure-of-the-tractatus">4. The main structure of
the Tractatus</h4>
<p>Sometime in the summer of 1915 Wittgenstein began writing a new
notebook (MS 104) which marked a watershed in the evolution of the
Tractatus. Entitling it ‘Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung’
(‘Logical-philosophical Treatise’), he here formulated, right at the
beginning, what were to become the first six main propositions of the
Tractatus, together with 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4
(with slight modifications to some of them). A space was left in the
sixth for the intended formula, which was added later.17 The seventh and
final proposition also came later, added on page 71. Wittgenstein’s
thoughts had clearly reached a point when he needed to take stock and
find a way to organize and develop them into a coherent whole. The
propositions he wrote down and the numbering system he invented provided
a brilliant way to do so. The main propositions formed the core of his
treatise and the decimal notation allowed him to develop it by adding
further remarks in a tree structure, some culled from his other
notebooks, revised as appropriate, and some new.</p>
<p>One can thus see how he insisted, in a letter written to the
publisher Ludwig von Ficker in December 1919 when he was trying to get
the Tractatus published (see Note on the Text, §2), that ‘the decimal
numbers of my remarks absolutely must be printed alongside them, because
they alone make the book perspicuous and clear: without the numbering it
would be an incomprehensible jumble’.18 Now that the key influences on
his thinking have been outlined and a sketch offered of some of his key
early ideas, we can see how his ideas were crystallized and elaborated
in the Tractatus itself, at least as far as its main structure is
concerned.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the main propositions, before looking in turn
at the corresponding propositions at the next level down, those of the
form n.m. Here are the seven main propositions:</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
<p>There is a clear line of thought here. Beginning with the claim that
the world is everything that is the case, we get clarification of what
it is for something to be the case—that is, to be a fact
(Tatsache)—namely, for states-of-things (Sachverhalten) to obtain.19
Next comes a statement about the relationship between facts and
thoughts: a thought is a logical picture of facts; and a thought is in
turn characterized as a senseful proposition. This leads to
clarification of what a proposition is: a truth-function of elementary
propositions; and we are then told what the general form of a
truth-function is, which is in turn characterized as the general
propositional form. That is where the statement of the main propositions
on the opening page of the notebook (MS 104) ends, but already we see
many of the key ideas of the Tractatus reflected here: the conceptions
of a fact, a state-of-things, a (logical) picture, a thought, a
(senseful) proposition, an elementary proposition, a truth-function, and
the general propositional form. Proposition 7 draws a conclusion: that
instead of trying to say something that does not instantiate the general
propositional form (and fulfil the conditions of being a proposition),
we should keep silent. We can see this as indicating the second part of
his treatise that Wittgenstein had described to Ficker: the part that he
had not written (see Note on the Text, §2).</p>
<p>4.1. The Main Structure of the 1s</p>
<p>The first section of the Tractatus, containing the opening
proposition and the 1s that follow, is the shortest in the book. There
are just two propositions of the form 1.m (with 1.2 added later):</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.</p>
<p>1.2 The world divides into facts.</p>
<p>These elaborate on the opening claim that the world is everything
that is the case: the world is made up of facts, not things. This
introduces the notion of a fact (Tatsache), which is fundamental to the
conception of a picture that is explained in the 2s.</p>
<p>4.2. The Main Structure of the 2s</p>
<p>The second section of the Tractatus, comprising the 2s, is much
longer than the first section (though still shorter than the remaining
sections), but there are also only two propositions of the form n.m:</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things. 2.1
We picture facts.</p>
<p>2.2 A picture has the logical form of depiction in common with what
is depicted.</p>
<p>These introduce the idea of a picture and state the basic connection
between a picture and a fact, bringing in the key idea of a common
logical form in depiction.</p>
<p>These ideas are elaborated in the propositions that comment on 2.1
and 2.2, providing a full account of his conception of a picture. What
is missing in 2.1 and 2.2, though, is clarification of the notion of a
state-of-things. This is done in a new kind of subdivision, adding
propositions of the form 2.0m. These are not, however, remarks on
anything numbered 2.0, but are also direct comments on 2. Having
formulated 2.1 and 2.2, Wittgenstein presumably realized that there
needed to be a further level of immediate clarification of 2, so he
inserted propositions between 2 and 2.1. Here are the propositions of
the form 2.0m:</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.
2.01 A state-of-things is a combination of objects (entities,
things).</p>
<p>2.02 An object is simple.</p>
<p>2.03 In a state-of-things the objects hang in one another, like the
links of a chain.</p>
<p>2.04 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things is the world.</p>
<p>2.05 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things also determines
which states-of-things do not obtain.</p>
<p>2.06 The obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things is
reality.</p>
<p>These summarize Wittgenstein’s conception of a state-of-things, with
further elucidation and argument provided in the lower-level
propositions (2.011, etc.). With this done, he could then rely on it
elaborating his account of pictures in the 2.1s and 2.2s, as in
describing them as presenting the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things (2.11, 2.201).</p>
<p>4.3. The Main Structure of the 3s</p>
<p>The third section of the Tractatus, comprising the 3s, is longer than
the first two sections combined (though shorter than each of the
remaining sections), and contains five propositions of the form 3.m
(with 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 added later):</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought. 3.1 In a proposition a
thought is expressed perceptibly.</p>
<p>3.2 In a proposition a thought can be so expressed that to the
objects of the thought correspond elements of the propositional
sign.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a
proposition does a name have meaning.</p>
<p>3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence
of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituents
themselves, by the existence of the senseful proposition.</p>
<p>3.5 A propositional sign as applied in thinking is a thought.</p>
<p>We have here an initial clarification of Wittgenstein’s conception of
a proposition as expressing a thought. 3.1 and the remarks that follow
(of the form 3.1m.) provide an excellent illustration of his method in
crafting the Tractatus. 3.1 had originally read: ‘The perceptible
expression of a thought is a propositional sign.’ Its final form is
sharper, focusing on the key concept of a proposition, with the 3.1s
elaborating on it. Two are especially significant. In 3.12 we are told
that ‘a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective relation
to the world’ (italics added). This makes clear that ‘Satz’, at least in
the 3s (and in most other places), should not be translated as
‘sentence’. What would correspond to ‘sentence’ is ‘propositional sign’
(‘Satzzeichen’). A proposition, on Wittgenstein’s view, expresses a
thought through a propositional sign. Arguably, though, even
‘Satzzeichen’, as Wittgenstein understands it, does not merely mean
‘sentence’. In 3.14 we read: ‘A propositional sign consists in this,
that its elements, the words, stand to one another in it in a
determinate way. A propositional sign is a fact.’ This crystallizes one
of Wittgenstein’s earliest insights, found in his notes of 1913 (as we
saw in §3.7 above) and reiterated in 3.1432: ‘Not: “The complex sign
‘aRb’ says that a stands in the relation R to b”; but: That ‘a’ stands
in a certain relation to ‘b’ says that aRb.’ In isolation (as it is in
the notes from which it is drawn), this is very cryptic, but we now see
that it is an illustration of his conception of propositions as facts.
Only facts can represent facts. The obtaining of states-of-things in the
world is represented by the obtaining of relations between the elements
of a propositional sign as they are projected in thought.</p>
<p>What has just been said is further elaborated in the 3.2s; and 3.3
states what is now known as the context principle, first formulated by
Frege in The Foundations of Arithmetic in arguing that the meaning of
number terms can only be given by defining the sense of a proposition in
which number terms occur.20 Wittgenstein generalizes the principle,
taking it to hold of all names, and puts it to different work, not least
in diagnosing what goes wrong in Russell’s paradox (briefly stated in
the 3.33s). 3.5, concluding the 3s, leads neatly into the 4s.</p>
<p>As in the 2s, we also have propositions of the form n.0m, elucidating
his conception of thinking, such as in claiming that we cannot think
anything illogical (3.03, defended in the lower-level propositions that
follow), as well as a single proposition of the form n.00m, connecting
the idea of a state-of-things in the 2s with 3: ‘“A state-of-things is
thinkable” means: we can picture it’ (3.001).</p>
<p>4.4. The Main Structure of the 4s</p>
<p>The fourth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 4s, is the second
longest section, but with section 3, it forms the philosophical heart of
the work. Significantly, in this respect, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 were
all transferred unchanged into the final version of the Tractatus. Only
4.5 was subsequently added. Here they are (with 4.5 drastically
shortened):</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition. 4.1 A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with
the possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement
with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.</p>
<p>4.5 It now appears possible to specify the most general propositional
form … The general form of a proposition is: such and such is the
case.</p>
<p>Section 2 had explained the conception of a fact as the obtaining of
states-of-things, which can be pictured in thought. Section 3 had
elaborated the idea of picturing in elucidating the conception of a
proposition as a propositional sign—understood as itself a fact—in its
projective relation to the world. Except for the 2.02s (in a different
context), however, there is no mention of propositions in section 2, and
there is no mention at all of states-of-things in section 3. The
connection between them is only made in 4.1: ‘A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.’ This is
undoubtedly one of the key and most distinctive claims of the Tractatus.
The claim is anticipated in 2.11: ‘A picture presents a state of affairs
in logical space, the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.’
But it is only once the conceptions of both a picture and a proposition
have been clarified, enabling propositions to be seen as a kind of
picture, that ‘picture’ in 2.11 can be replaced by ‘proposition’.</p>
<p>4.2 brings in the conception of the sense of a proposition,
characterized here as its agreement and disagreement with the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things,
and 4.3 introduces two new notions, of truth-possibilities and of
elementary propositions, although the latter had been defined (appearing
for the first time) in 4.21 (so immediately after 4.2): ‘The simplest
proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the obtaining of a
state-of-things.’ This makes the crucial connection between elementary
propositions and states-of-things (which can indeed now be seen as
‘atomic’ states of affairs), and leads Wittgenstein to formulate 4.4 as
following from (and summarizing) 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.</p>
<p>In a parenthetical remark in his notebooks dated 3 June 1915,
Wittgenstein wrote: ‘The liberating Word [das erlösende Wort], by the
way, has not yet been spoken here’ (NB, p. 54; cf. pp. 39, 40).
Wittgenstein was concerned throughout his life to find the ‘liberating’
word, which he later characterized as ‘the word that finally permits us
to grasp what until then had constantly and intangibly weighed on our
consciousness’ (BT, p. 302e). The remark in his notebooks was written
just before he came up with his plan for the Tractatus. In starting his
new notebook (MS 104) with a formulation of propositions 1, 1.1, 2, 2.1,
2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5, and 6, he seems to have
found a constellation of liberating words, a liberating core, around
which he could construct his treatise.</p>
<p>4.5 was only formed later, out of several remarks originally numbered
as 4.4301, 4.43011, 4.43012, and 4.4303 (as they can be found in the
Prototractatus, as later reconstructed by scholars from MS 104). It is
one of only two propositions of the form n.m that are amongst the
longest in the Tractatus, but draws an important conclusion from the
core remarks we have just considered. It also connects back to the very
first proposition: ‘The world is everything that is the case.’ Language
is now seen as saying what is the case (whether truly or falsely).
Wittgenstein insisted that the last sentence in 4.5, ‘Es verhält sich so
und so’, be translated ‘Such and such is the case’, not ‘Things are
combined in such and such a way’, as Ramsey had first rendered it,
commenting that ‘The expression must be one used in every day language
to express that something or other is the case’ (LO, p. 30; see the
explanatory note to 4.5).</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein says in the second paragraph of 4.5, the most general
propositional form must indeed be maximally general, to include all
genuine propositions. But if all propositions represent the obtaining
and non-obtaining of states-of-things, asserted by elementary
propositions, whose truth-possibilities thus determine the
truth-possibilities of every proposition, then all propositions do
indeed make some claim about how the world is, that such and such is the
case. The 4s have provided the philosophical rationale for this, and the
5s will provide a more technical logical account.</p>
<p>As in section 3, we also have propositions both of the form n.0m and
of the form n.00m. The 4.00s talk about language in general, ending in
the claim that all philosophy is ‘critique of language’, and
complimenting Russell for having shown that the apparent logical form of
a proposition need not be its real one (4.0031; see §2.2 above). The
4.0s make further remarks about a proposition being a picture or model
of reality (4.01), which explains how we can understand a proposition
without having its sense explained to us (4.02), how a proposition can
convey a new sense to us with old expressions (4.03), and how it can be
true or false (4.06), among other things.</p>
<p>4.5. The Main Structure of the 5s</p>
<p>The fifth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 5s, is the
longest, supplying the technical apparatus to make more precise
Wittgenstein’s claim about the general proposition form and clarifying
his conception of a logical operation. Only 5 had appeared in his
initial formulation of the main propositions of the Tractatus, and here
there is the most change from the version of this section that emerged
from his original manuscript (MS 104, reconstructed to form the
Prototractatus) to the final version. Here is the final version (with
only the first sentence of 5.3 given):</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) 5.1 The
truth-functions can be ordered in series. This is the foundation of
probability theory.</p>
<p>5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one
another.</p>
<p>5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions… .</p>
<p>5.4 This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical
constants’ (in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</p>
<p>5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of
the operation (– – – – – T)(ξ, … .) to elementary propositions. This
operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets
and I call it the negation of these propositions.</p>
<p>5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>
<p>5 is the key claim of section 5, and indeed, one of the key claims of
the whole book. Except for a solitary mention in 3.3441, 5 marks the
first appearance of the notion of a truth-function, and this is
explained in 5.1, drawing out some of its implications, such as for
probability theory. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary
propositions if its truth-value (truth or falsity) is determined by the
truth-values of the elementary propositions. To take one of the simplest
examples, the truth-value of the conjunction ‘p andandandand q’ (‘p.q’
in the Russellian notation that Wittgenstein uses) is determined by the
truth-values of ‘p’ and ‘q’: it is true if both ‘p’ and ‘q’ are true and
false in the other three cases (5.101). We can also say that p (as well
as q) follows from p andandandand q (5.12 ff.).</p>
<p>To say that a proposition is a truth-function of other propositions
is to say that they stand in internal relations to one another, which
can be brought out by seeing the proposition as generated from the other
propositions by a logical operation, as explained in the 5.2s. In 5.25
Wittgenstein remarks that operation and function must not be confused,
which is itself confusing given his talk of truth-functions. But what he
means here is a propositional function, which cannot be its own argument
(as he stressed in 3.333 in his diagnosis of Russell’s paradox), while
the result of an operation can become its own base (5.251). So
truth-functions are functions in a broader sense. Truth-functions of
propositions are results of what he calls truth-operations on other
propositions, the bases of the operations (5.234). This is summarized in
the full version of 5.3, the second of the two propositions of the form
n.m that are amongst the longest in the book.</p>
<p>5.4 draws a conclusion that reinforces the ‘fundamental thought’ he
had expressed in 4.0312, that the ‘logical constants’ do not represent,
that is, are not ‘logical objects’. He offers a number of arguments in
what follows. One relies on the interdefinability of the various logical
connectives (5.42), which conflicts with the idea that any primitive
ideas must be independent of one another (5.451). As he claims at
several points in the Tractatus, there are no ‘pre-eminent numbers’ in
logic (5.453; cf. 4.128, 5.553). Frege and Russell had taken two logical
connectives as primitive in their (propositional) logic: negation and
the conditional in Frege’s Begriffsschrift, negation and conjunction in
the system of Principia Mathematica. But this is arbitrary. In fact, as
Henry Sheffer had shown in 1913, we can actually make do with just one
logical connective, symbolized as ‘|’, understood as ‘neither … nor’.21
‘p|q’ is true if neither ‘p’ nor ‘q’ is true and false in all other
cases. All the other logical connectives can be defined in terms of
Sheffer’s stroke ‘|’. ‘~p’ (negation) can be defined as ‘p|p’ (neither p
nor p), for example, and ‘p andandandand q’ (conjunction) as
‘<sub>p|</sub>q’ (neither not p nor not q) and hence ‘(p|p)|(q|q)’. But
there is nothing uniquely ‘primitive’ about Sheffer’s stroke.</p>
<p>What he says here, however, might seem to conflict with what he goes
on to say in 5.5 in introducing his N-operator, symbolized as ‘()’. This
generalizes Sheffer’s stroke, extending its use to the infinite
case—where there may be an infinite number of elementary propositions
(which cannot be ruled out by logic, according to Wittgenstein). If
every proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions, and we
can make do with a single logical operator, then every proposition can
be generated by successive applications of the N-operator to elementary
propositions. But Wittgenstein’s position is not that this is therefore
the one primitive logical constant, but that it merely reflects the
ideal logical notation for understanding the general propositional form.
This is clarified in the 5.5s, when he tries to show (controversially)
how general propositions (5.52 ff.), (apparent) identity statements
(5.53 ff.), and propositions such as ‘A believes that p’ (5.54 ff.) can
be handled in his logical notation.</p>
<p>5.6 returns us to the question of the limits of language, broached in
the preface to the Tractatus, cryptically anticipated in the 4.11s, and
cryptically answered in 4.51: ‘Suppose that I am given all elementary
propositions; then the question arises as to what propositions I can
form from them. And the answer is all propositions and this is how they
are limited.’ The limits of language and hence of the world are drawn
from within language. Those limits are shown by the general
propositional form, by all propositions being truth-functions of the
elementary propositions.</p>
<p>In the original version of the 5s, there were many propositions of
the forms n.00m and n.0m, but all were renumbered and reordered, with
the exception of the two that become 5.01 and 5.02.</p>
<p>4.6. The Main Structure of the 6s</p>
<p>The sixth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 6s, is the third
longest, and after capturing the general form of a proposition in a
single formula, Wittgenstein considers various kinds of propositions
that do not fit the formula and offers an account of how they should be
regarded.</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition. 6.1 The propositions of logic are
tautologies.</p>
<p>6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics
are equations, that is, pseudo-propositions.</p>
<p>6.3 The investigation of logic means the investigation of all
regularity. And outside logic all is accident.</p>
<p>6.4 All propositions are of equal value.</p>
<p>6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be
stated. There is no such thing as the riddle. If a question can be posed
at all, then it can also be answered.</p>
<p>The sixth section of the Tractatus gave Wittgenstein the most trouble
and underwent the most changes during its composition. As noted above,
the formula in proposition 6 was only filled in later. Initially, it
seems, Wittgenstein had been thinking that what eventually became 6.1
would be the main proposition 6. Section 6 was originally conceived as
entirely about logic, ending on what is now 6.13 (the last proposition
of the 6.1s, combining 6.13 and 6.131 of the Prototractatus): ‘Logic is
not a set of teachings [Lehre] but a mirror image of the world. Logic is
transcendental.’ The conclusion to the whole book was thus to be the
claim that logic is transcendental. (On the idea of the transcendental,
see the discussion of Schopenhauer in §2.3 above.22)</p>
<p>In July 1916 Wittgenstein began to think more about ethics, prompted
by especially harrowing experiences on the warfront. This led to the
decision to add a further subsection consisting of the following remarks
numbered 6.2: ‘Ethics does not consist of propositions. All propositions
are of equal value.’ These were to become 6.42 and 6.4 of the Tractatus,
respectively, with 6.42 derived from 6.4 via 6.41, which suggests that
‘Ethics does not consist of propositions’ was seen as the conclusion to
subsection 6.2 corresponding to the conclusion that ‘Logic is
transcendental’ at the end of the 6.1s. In due course Wittgenstein also
remarks that ‘Ethics is transcendental’, which becomes part of 6.421,
making clear that a comparison is being drawn between ethics and
logic.</p>
<p>At the same time we have the first appearance of proposition 7: ‘Of
what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.’ We can see this
anticipated in remarks Wittgenstein makes in the notebook he began in
April 1916 (so not MS 104). In the entry dated 30 July, after discussing
the question ‘why should I live happily?’, which revealingly he
describes as a ‘tautological question’, he goes on: ‘All this is really
in some sense deeply mysterious! It is clear that ethics cannot be
stated [sich nicht aussprechen läßt]’ (NB, p. 78). This second remark
also ends up as part of 6.421, and it is but a step from this to
proposition 7. What all this suggests is that it was his thinking that
both ethics and logic are transcendental that led him to formulate what
became the overall conclusion to the Tractatus. Proposition 7 was not
intended, at least originally, to be a conclusion to anything that is in
the 6.5s, as that final subsection had not yet been conceived. (That is
not to say that, once the 6.5s had been incorporated, proposition 7
could not function as a conclusion to them as well.)</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Wittgenstein was also continuing to think
about the general propositional form, which he later admitted in the
Philosophical Investigations was the part of his earlier work that had
given him the most headache (PI, §65). In a remark written on 9 July
1916 he makes clear why he thinks that there must be such a form: ‘If
the most general propositional form could not be given, then a moment
would have to come when we suddenly had a new experience, a logical one,
so to speak’ (NB, 75). The problem is still exercising him in November
1916. ‘That it is possible to establish the general propositional form
is just to say: every possible form of proposition must be foreseeable’
(NB, p. 89). His thought is very simple: if we have learnt (our)
language, then we will understand any possible proposition we may come
across in the future, so it must have a general form that enables us to
do this. He then goes on to identify the concept ‘and so on’ as the key
to establishing this form, a concept he takes as equivalent to the
concept of an operation: ‘The concept of an operation is quite generally
that according to which signs can be constructed according to a rule’
(NB, p. 90). There is no further clue in the notebook in which this is
written as to what exactly the formula is, and the notebook ends soon
after (the last entry is dated 10 January 1917, though with no entries
made between 2 December and 7 January). But we can see Wittgenstein
getting closer to the formula that was eventually added to MS 104, which
cannot have happened before December 1916.</p>
<p>Even when Wittgenstein did come up with the formula that found its
way into the Tractatus, however, the explanation he gives in 6.001 and
6.002 is inadequate, as Russell recognized when he read it. On this,
Russell gives the following helpful account in his introduction to the
Tractatus, diplomatically rectifying the explanation:</p>
<p>Mr Wittgenstein’s explanation of his symbolism at this point is not
quite fully given in the text. The symbol he uses is</p>
<p>The following is the explanation of this symbol:</p>
<pre><code> stands for all atomic propositions.

 stands for any set of propositions.

 stands for the negation of all the propositions making up .

The whole symbol [] means whatever can be obtained by taking any selection of atomic propositions, negating them all, then taking any selection of the set of propositions now obtained, together with any of the originals—and so on indefinitely. This is, he says, the general truth-function and also the general form of proposition. What is meant is somewhat less complicated than it sounds. The symbol is intended to describe a process by the help of which, given the atomic propositions, all others can be manufactured. The process depends upon:

(a) Sheffer’s proof that all truth-functions can be obtained out of simultaneous negation, i.e. out of ‘not-p and not-q’;

(b) Mr Wittgenstein’s theory of the derivation of general propositions from conjunctions and disjunctions;

(c) The assertion that a proposition can only occur in another proposition as argument to a truth-function.</code></pre>
<p>Given these three foundations, it follows that all propositions which
are not atomic can be derived from such as are, by a uniform process,
and it is this process which is indicated by Mr Wittgenstein’s
symbol.</p>
<p>Establishing the general form of a proposition was one of the major
goals of the Tractatus, but once it had been achieved, it brought about
further changes to the structure of the work. The subsection on ethics
was moved to begin at 6.4, to make room for two new subsections, one on
mathematics beginning with 6.2 and one on scientific laws beginning with
6.3. A final subsection on philosophy was then also added beginning with
6.5. The motivation for these is clear. With the general form of a
proposition now established, with all propositions seen as resulting
from the successive application of the N-operator to elementary
propositions, questions naturally arise about the status of (apparent)
propositions that cannot be so generated. These include logical
propositions, mathematical propositions, scientific laws, ethical
propositions, and philosophical propositions. Wittgenstein devotes a
subsection to each of them before concluding with 7.</p>
<p>All these propositions lack sense, according to Wittgenstein, since
to have sense just is to have the general form of a proposition. But it
would be too quick to dismiss all of them as nonsensical. Logical
propositions are characterized as senseless, not nonsensical, since they
are tautologies, which say nothing but show the logical properties of
language and the world. Mathematical propositions also have a status
somewhere between senseful and nonsensical propositions. But he
characterizes them not as tautologies but as equations, though they also
show the logic of the world (6.21), and not explicitly as nonsensical
but as pseudo-propositions, since they express no thoughts (6.2). He
presumably stops short of calling them nonsensical because they help us
draw inferences outside mathematics (6.211). Wittgenstein is not a
logicist (taking mathematical propositions to be logical propositions),
but he does describe mathematics as a logical method. Scientific laws
and principles also have an intermediate status, many of them being
construed by Wittgenstein as offering forms within which to cast
empirical propositions (6.32–6.36).</p>
<p>When it comes to ethical and other value propositions (such as in
aesthetics), the account is rather different. Value lies outside the
world, he claims, and what goes on here is more a matter of the attitude
we take to the world. A happy person will experience the world
differently from an unhappy person (6.43), and experiencing it as a
‘limited whole’ is the mystical feeling, he writes (6.45). With
philosophy, the account is different again. It is only in this final
subsection that Wittgenstein uses the term ‘nonsensical’ (‘unsinnig’),
once in 6.51 in characterizing scepticism and then, most notoriously of
all, in 6.54 in describing the propositions of the Tractatus themselves.
Since this is the most controversial issue of all in discussions of the
Tractatus, we will devote the whole of §5 of this Introduction to
it.</p>
<p>4.7. Proposition 7</p>
<p>We finally come to proposition 7: ‘Of what one cannot speak, about
that one must be silent.’23 As noted above, it was first formulated as a
conclusion to the dual claims that logic and ethics are transcendental.
As such it is impossible to speak of them, according to Wittgenstein,
since no propositions about them are possible. But the logical structure
of the world is shown by logical propositions, and one’s ethical or
religious attitude, we might also suggest (drawing out the implication
of what Wittgenstein says), is shown by our behaviour towards others and
our feelings about the world. Wittgenstein undoubtedly felt, however,
that there was too much ‘gassing’, as he put it in his letter to Ficker,
about all this, especially ethics, which is why he wanted to recommend
that people just keep quiet about such matters. (‘Schweigen’ can mean
not just ‘be silent’ but also ‘shut up’.) His treatise ended up being
conceived, at least for such people as Ficker, as providing an argument
for this recommendation.</p>
<p>Let us conclude, then, by emphasizing the importance of recognizing
the tree structure of the Tractatus. Not only did this structure
facilitate the composition of the Tractatus, but it also facilitates our
understanding if we follow out each line of thinking along one of the
sequential branches, beginning with 1 to 7 and then looking in turn at
all the propositions of the form n.m, n.0m, and n.00m, before
progressing to the lower-level propositions. Some of these can also be
considered separately, if we wish to understand particular propositions
on the higher levels (such as in reading 2.11 to 2.19 in understanding
his claim in 2.1 that ‘We picture facts’), or we can then proceed to a
full reading. As Wittgenstein claimed in his letter to Ficker, the
treatise does indeed become perspicuous and clear once we attend to the
numbering, and we can thereby build up an understanding of the work, as
this section has hopefully shown. The brilliance of the construction of
the Tractatus has not been appreciated as much as it should. It is an
intellectual creation of the highest order, the tree structure creating
the logical space in which his ideas found their expression and meaning.
It is the greatest example of a philosophical work of art in the
twentieth century, and deserves to be read and understood as such.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>A book of nonsense?</li>
</ol>
<p>The outstanding problem for readers and interpreters of the Tractatus
is undoubtedly Wittgenstein’s notorious claim in 6.54 that the
propositions in his book are nonsensical. If he is right, then why
should we bother to read it? Given his conception of propositions as
pictures representing states of affairs and his specification of the
general propositional form, his claim seems an unavoidable conclusion,
since one is hard pressed to find any of his propositions representing
states of affairs. Yet, as we have just seen, a whole range of
propositions—in logic, mathematics, science, ethics, and aesthetics—are
thereby excluded, and Wittgenstein seems careful not to call them
‘nonsensical’ (‘unsinnig’). In the 6s the only other remark in which the
term is used is 6.51, and both 6.51 and 6.54 are comments on 6.5, which
opens with the claim that ‘When an answer cannot be stated, neither can
the question be stated.’ Wittgenstein goes on to say in 6.51 that
‘Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries
to doubt where nothing can be asked.’ Since scepticism is a
philosophical position, it is what we say in doing philosophy that
Wittgenstein seems to want to claim is nonsensical (cf. 4.003). But if
the Tractatus itself is a work of philosophy, then how much of what he
says himself is nonsensical?</p>
<p>Over the last twenty years there has been heated debate about how
seriously we must take Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.54. A group of ‘new
Wittgensteinians’, as they have been called, or ‘resolute readers’, as
some have preferred to call themselves, have urged that we must take it
very seriously indeed and not ‘chicken out’ in trying to find a way to
treat nonsense as illuminating.24 The purpose of the Tractatus, they
claim, is ‘therapeutic’: by working through the book, we are brought to
recognize how the metaphysical claims we may be inclined to make are
illusory. We have already seen examples of such metaphysical claims,
such as Frege made in distinguishing between concept and object and
Russell made in expounding his theory of types. The Tractatus is indeed
concerned with diagnosing what goes wrong here, and it is significant
that seven of the fifteen occurrences of ‘nonsensical’ in the book occur
in the 4.12s, where Wittgenstein’s diagnosis is offered (see the
Glossary to identify all the occurrences).</p>
<p>The resolute readers are quite right to emphasize these and similar
passages (such as the 5.473s), which form the core of Wittgenstein’s
critique of Frege and Russell, and much light has been shed on the
Tractatus by the various readings that have been offered and the
responses that they have provoked. But we are on slippery ground, as
Wittgenstein’s diagnosis and critique relies on distinctions that he
himself draws—most notably, between saying and showing and between real
and formal concepts. It is then natural to ask whether his own
statements and explanations of these should also count as
nonsensical—and in turn, of course, whether this also applies to what
the resolute readers say about it all.</p>
<p>Opponents of resolute readings stress that Wittgenstein, both before,
in, and after the Tractatus, seems not to have regarded what he was
trying to show as entirely illusory, but rather as merely ineffable. In
the preface, for example, he states unashamedly that ‘the truth of the
thoughts conveyed here is unassailable and definitive’, although he
admits how little is achieved once the problems of philosophy have been
solved ‘in essence’. He clearly thought that something was shown in his
work, and it is the conception of showing that holds the key to
understanding what he was doing, difficult as that is to explain.</p>
<p>We cannot do justice to the debate between resolute readers and their
critics in this Introduction, let alone settle it. But one further
aspect should be mentioned here. The resolute reading was motivated by
dissatisfaction with what was called the ‘traditional reading’,
according to which Wittgenstein did indeed advance metaphysical claims
in the Tractatus, especially in sections 1 and 2 in talking of the
world, facts, states-of-things, simple objects, and so on. On the
resolute reading, these were only made as part of his therapeutic
strategy: by the end we are meant to see them as nonsensical and hence
to discard them. But there is an intermediate position here:
Wittgenstein did not think of them at the time as metaphysical and hence
nonsensical, or at any rate as nonsensical as the claims made by Frege
and Russell, but simply as the way to elucidate his dual conception of
propositions as pictures and of the general propositional form. They
show the form of the world, without which logic and language (as we know
it) would not be possible: they are the barest minimum of transcendental
conditions. In this respect it is significant that all the propositions
in the first two sections (with just a couple of exceptions in the case
of the lowest-level propositions) were only formulated by Wittgenstein
in the process of coming up with and developing his plan for the
Tractatus, in other words, once he finally felt clear about his core
conception of propositions as pictures. On 2 August 1916, so shortly
after this plan had been hatched, he remarks: ‘My work has expanded from
the foundations of logic to the essence of the world’ (NB, p. 78). This
may sound metaphysical but the context suggests more of a concern to
identify the transcendental conditions of our language and thought—and
only through this of the world.</p>
<p>This intermediate position may be unstable, and in retrospect we can
certainly see the claims he made as both metaphysical and problematic—as
he himself did when he revisited his work later. A remark he makes in
the Philosophical Investigations is revealing: ‘The results of
philosophy are the discovery of some piece of plain nonsense and the
bumps that the understanding has got by running up against the limits of
language. They—these bumps—make us see the value of that discovery’ (PI,
§119). Wittgenstein had stated explicitly in his preface to the
Tractatus that his aim had been to draw a limit to language (and hence
to the expression of thoughts) from within language. But the temptation
to overstep these limits in doing so is irresistible, and it was perhaps
inevitable that he did so himself in the Tractatus. None of this
invalidates his project, however, as long as we appreciate what he was
trying to do. As he said in 6.54, ‘My propositions elucidate when
someone who understands me finally recognizes them as nonsensical by
using them to climb up, over, and out of them’ (italics added). In the
end, their disputed status as ‘nonsensical’ is far less important than
what we can learn from them, and this is dependent on the effort that
each of us makes to understand him.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Wittgenstein’s later critique of the Tractatus</li>
</ol>
<p>After the publication of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein maintained, by
and large, his philosophical silence until he was gradually tempted back
into philosophy by discussions with members of the Vienna Circle. In
1929 he returned to Cambridge and began re-assessing his old ideas and
developing new ones. The story of his later development is long and
complex and all that can be done here is to select some of the key ideas
and themes and outline what transformations occurred. We shall focus on
four moves: from a monistic conception of logic to a pluralist view of
what he called language-games; from the acceptance of subsistent simple
objects to recognition of the role of samples; from concern with
signification to a much greater emphasis on use in understanding
meaning; and from preoccupation with the general propositional form to
exploring the diversity of particular propositional forms.25</p>
<p>6.1. From Logic to Language-Games</p>
<p>The first problem in his earlier views that Wittgenstein attempted to
solve on his return to philosophy concerned the supposed logical
independence of elementary propositions (4.211). ‘A is red’, said of a
point, might seem to be an obvious example of an elementary proposition,
but this contradicts ‘A is green’. Wittgenstein had recognized the
problem in his notebooks (NB, pp. 81, 91), but had assumed that physics
would provide the analysis to show how it was logically impossible for
something to be both red and green (6.3751). In ‘Some Remarks on Logical
Form’ (1929), he tried to solve the problem by suggesting that numbers
must somehow enter into the logical forms of colour propositions to
reflect the degree of quality involved, such as position along a
spectrum. But since identifying their logical form would then depend on
the results of scientific investigation, this contradicted his
fundamental assumption that logic must take care of itself (5.473). He
disowned the paper before it was even published (see §1 above) and came
to believe, instead, that elementary propositions could be divided into
Satzsysteme, or systems of propositions, only one member of which could
be true in any given situation. Only propositions from different systems
would be logically independent.</p>
<p>What the problem of colour exclusion forced Wittgenstein to recognize
was that there are forms of logical inference that cannot be handled
within his theory of truth-functions. ‘A is red; therefore A is not
green’ is just one such inference. The rules for the logical connectives
are thus only part of a much more complex set of rules (cf. WVC, pp. 74,
76; PR, pp. 109, 111). The new project that this then suggests—to
provide an account of the logic of the various Satzsysteme—was to
develop into the description and elucidation of what he called
‘language-games’ in his later work. There may be language-games for
using colour terms, for describing shapes, for counting, for talking
about our feelings, and so on. Each language-game would have its own set
of rules, which may or may not be formalizable into a logical theory,
even if there might be some basic logical rules (such as modus ponens)
that are still followed. Rules from different language-games might also
interfere with one another, generating further confusions for the
philosopher to clear up.</p>
<p>6.2. From Simples to Samples</p>
<p>In thinking further about colour propositions Wittgenstein also
explored representing them geometrically—assigning them a position along
certain colour axes, as illustrated by the two diagrams below (cf. PR,
p. 278; WLL, p. 8).</p>
<p>‘Every statement about colours’, Wittgenstein remarks, ‘can be
represented by means of such symbols. If we say that four elementary
colours would suffice, I call such symbols of equal status elements of
representation. These elements of representation are the “objects”’
(WVC, p. 43). The reference here is to his conception of simple objects
in the Tractatus, and within a year he is talking of these ‘elements of
representation’ as samples. ‘What I once called “objects”, simples, were
simply what I could refer to without running the risk of their possible
non-existence; i.e. that for which there is neither existence nor
non-existence, and that means: what we can speak about no matter what
may be the case’ (PR, p. 72). He goes on: ‘If I want to tell someone
what colour some material is to be, I send him a sample, and obviously
this sample belongs to language’ (PR, p. 73). A particular set of
objects may indeed be presupposed by a given language-game, then, but
these objects are not the simples of the Tractatus but the samples that
function as the elements of representation, as part of the symbolism
itself.</p>
<p>In his later Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein discusses
simples and samples in §§39–64. §50 is the key section. In asking what
it is to attribute existence to an element, he writes:</p>
<p>There is one thing of which one can state neither that it is 1 metre
long, nor that it is not 1 metre long, and that is the standard metre in
Paris.—But this is, of course, not to ascribe any remarkable property to
it, but only to mark its peculiar role in the game of measuring with a
metre-rule.—Suppose that samples of colour were preserved in Paris like
the standard metre. So we explain that “sepia” means the colour of the
standard sepia which is kept there hermetically sealed. Then it will
make no sense to state of this sample either that it is of this colour
or that it is not.</p>
<pre><code>We can put it like this: This sample is an instrument of the language, by means of which we make colour statements. In this game, it is not something that is represented, but is a means of representation… . And to say “If it did not exist, it could have no name” is to say as much and as little as: if this thing did not exist, we could not use it in our language-game.—What looks as if it had to exist is part of the language. It is a paradigm in our game; something with which comparisons are made. And this may be an important observation; but it is none the less an observation about our language-game—our mode of representation.   (PI, §50)</code></pre>
<p>Denying that the standard metre is a metre long might seem absurd,
but if measuring something as a metre long requires laying the standard
metre alongside it (if this is the language-game we play), then we
cannot measure the standard metre itself. To explain Wittgenstein’s idea
further, consider the following inference:</p>
<p>Assuming that (a), (b), and (c) have sense, the inference is clearly
valid. But what if ‘X’ is replaced by ‘the standard metre’? According to
Wittgenstein, (b) now lacks sense, but this does not mean that the
inference becomes invalid, since (b) simply drops out altogether: (c)
can be directly inferred from (a). If Y is the same length as the
standard metre, then it is one metre long. On Wittgenstein’s account,
(b) is now the expression of a rule, licensing the passage from (a) to
(c), rather than a premise in itself.</p>
<p>There is an obvious comparison here with the inference we considered
in §3.4 above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>P</p></li>
<li><p>P ⊃ Q</p>
<pre><code>______</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Q</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is also a valid inference, but if we replace ‘Q’ by ‘P ∨ Q’ (‘P
or Q’), we can now infer (3) directly from (1): (2) is no longer a
required premise, but is simply an expression of the rule licensing the
inference (i.e. ‘From “P” infer “P ∨ Q”’). This was, of course, one of
Wittgenstein’s key ideas in the Tractatus: logical propositions such as
‘P ⊃ P ∨ Q’ are senseless, merely showing that a certain inference is
valid (cf. 6.1201, 6.1221, 6.1264). Although he came to reject the idea
that all logical propositions are truth-functional tautologies, he
continued to believe that logical propositions—understood as expressions
of inferential rules—lacked sense.</p>
<p>6.3. From Signifying to Use</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s discussion of the standard metre is embedded in a
broader critique of what he took to be an underlying assumption of his
Tractatus, that ‘a name ought really to signify a simple’, as he puts it
in §39 of the Philosophical Investigations. The meaning of a name, he
argues, is not the object to which it refers to on a given occasion.
That is to mistake its meaning with its bearer: a name does not lose its
meaning when its bearer dies (PI, §40). It is in this context that
Wittgenstein makes one of his most famous later claims: ‘For a large
class of cases of the employment of the word “meaning”—though not for
all—this word can be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its
use in the language’ (PI, §43). This is often seen to mark a radical
change from his view in the Tractatus, but even there he had stressed
that ‘To recognize the symbol by its sign, one must pay attention to the
senseful use’ (3.326).</p>
<p>What happens, then, when the samples that are part of the symbolism
of a particular language-game are destroyed? The language-game itself
changes and may eventually stop being played altogether. Imagine that
all the red things in our environment vanish overnight. Initially we may
rely on our memory to continue to talk of red things, but over time we
will be unable to explain the use of ‘red’ to others, such as those who
are born later, and the language-game may wither away (cf. PI, §§56–7).
It is tempting to suppose that if we can talk of red things at all, then
there must be some universal property (some Platonic form) of redness
that ‘exists timelessly’. In resisting the temptation to make such
metaphysical statements, Wittgenstein considers treating ‘Red exists’ as
saying no more than ‘“Red” has a meaning’ and ‘Red does not exist’ as
saying no more than ‘“Red” does not have a meaning’, propositions about
our use of language (PI, §58). Commenting on the latter, though, he goes
on:</p>
<p>Only we do not want to say that that expression [‘Red does not
exist’] says this, but that this is what it would have to be saying if
it made sense—that the expression actually contradicts itself in the
attempt to say that just because red exists ‘in and of itself’. Whereas
the only contradiction lies in something like this: the sentence looks
as if it were about the colour, while it is supposed to be saying
something about the use of the word “red”.—In reality, however, we quite
readily say that a particular colour exists, and that is as much as to
say that something exists that has that colour. And the first expression
is no less accurate than the second. (PI, §58)</p>
<p>We see here a significant transformation of his approach in the
Tractatus. Rather than treating a sentence such as ‘Red exists’ (or
‘Simple objects exist’) as saying something that, strictly speaking, can
only be shown, he considers the actual use of such sentences, which may
make perfect sense on a given occasion, such as in just meaning ‘Red
things exist’. It is the philosopher who gives them a misleading spin or
uses them in confused or confusing ways. As Wittgenstein says, ‘What we
do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use’
(PI, §116). What he had previously assigned to the realm of ‘showing’ he
now realizes can be elucidated by carefully describing our various uses
of language.</p>
<p>6.4. From the General Propositional form to Particular Propositional
Forms</p>
<p>In 4.5 of the Tractatus Wittgenstein characterized the general form
of a proposition as: ‘such and such is the case [es verhält sich so und
so]’. In §114 of the Investigations he comments directly on this: ‘That
is the kind of proposition one repeats to oneself countless times. One
thinks that one is tracing nature over and over again, and one is merely
tracing round the frame through which we look at it.’ In §115 he goes
on: ‘A picture held us captive. And we couldn’t get outside it, for it
lay in our language, and language seemed only to repeat it to us
inexorably.’ In its place, Wittgenstein urges us to recognize the
diversity of propositional forms, or as he prefers to express it, of the
different kinds of uses of the things we call ‘signs’ (‘Zeichen’),
‘words’ (‘Worte’), and ‘sentences’ (‘Sätze’, where ‘sentence’ is now the
appropriate translation of ‘Satz’). The term ‘language-game’ is
introduced in this context, to emphasize that ‘the speaking of language
is part of an activity, or of a form of life’ (PI, §23). He gives
examples to illustrate the variety of language-games: giving orders,
describing an object, reporting an event, making up a story, guessing
riddles, translating, and so on (PI, §23).</p>
<p>Here too, though, there are anticipations of the diversity of
propositional forms in the 6.3s. Wittgenstein talks in 6.341, for
example, of different nets for describing the world. In describing the
world, the resulting propositions are presumably all still seen as
exemplifying the general propositional form; but on his return to
philosophy, he was soon emphasizing that function–argument form, just
like subject–predicate form, is only a norm of representation, a mould
into which things are squeezed (see e.g. PR, pp. 136–7). Representing
all propositions as truth-functions of elementary propositions is itself
such a mould, a frame that Wittgenstein had mistakenly taken to be
tracing nature itself.</p>
<p>His use of ‘picture’ in §115 is also significant, for it marks a
different concern with ‘pictures’ in his later work. On his later view,
his conception of propositions as pictures is itself a picture, a way of
seeing something that may seem irresistible, that seems to force itself
upon us (cf. PI, §140), but which may mislead us in all sorts of ways.
What he says in the Investigations about such ‘pictures’ applies to his
conception of propositions as pictures: ‘A picture is conjured up which
seems to fix the sense unambiguously. The actual use, compared with that
traced out by the picture, seems like something muddied’ (PI, §426). At
the same time, Wittgenstein takes an interest in the ambiguity of
(drawn) pictures such as the duck–rabbit picture (PI, PPF, §xi), which
we can see either as a duck or as a rabbit. Yet again, we have an
anticipation of this interest in 5.5423 of the Tractatus, but his
concern with aspect perception takes on methodological significance, as
part of his later philosophical project is aimed at getting us to
recognize new aspects of things, or aspects that had become hidden
because of their familiarity (PI, §129), in dissolving philosophical
problems or puzzlement.</p>

<li>The significance of the Tractatus in the history of philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Wittgenstein is often described as having inaugurated the linguistic
turn in philosophy, which began with the Tractatus and continued through
his later work. All philosophy, he had declared in 4.0031, is ‘critique
of language’. Language disguises thought (4.002) and the aim is to
uncover the real logical form of propositions, which may well be much
more complex than their surface grammatical form. But as Wittgenstein
says in this context, it was Russell’s merit to have shown this, in his
theory of descriptions, and we should also see Frege as helping
inaugurate the linguistic turn in his analysis of number statements.
Wittgenstein’s central role in the linguistic turn is indisputable,
however, and the linguistic turn itself has formed a central thread in
the development of analytic philosophy, more generally. Even among those
who have returned to systematic metaphysical theorizing, careful
attention to language is still an essential part.</p>
<p>When we consider the more detailed level, however, assessment of the
significance of the Tractatus becomes more complex. One of the first
reviews, and certainly the most substantial and insightful, was by
Ramsey in 1923, and his own subsequent work on philosophy and the
foundations of mathematics was heavily influenced by the Tractatus—and
the conversations he later had with Wittgenstein (see Note on the Text,
§6). Ramsey tragically died in 1930, however, at the age of just 26,
although his own legacy has lived on.</p>
<p>The Tractatus was also a major influence on the logical
positivists—the members of the Vienna Circle. They took over
Wittgenstein’s conception of logical propositions as tautologies and
approved of what they saw as his wholesale repudiation of metaphysics.
But they stayed silent about his conception of showing, and focused more
on scientific verifiability as the criterion for senseful propositions
(although this was also influenced by discussions with Wittgenstein that
they later had). When logical positivism was imported into Britain
through the work of A. J. Ayer, in his iconoclastic Language, Truth and
Logic of 1936, Wittgenstein’s view of ethics influenced the emergence of
emotivism, the view that ethical (and aesthetic and religious)
propositions are neither true nor false (since they cannot be verified)
but are merely expressions of emotion. The distinction between fact and
value was to become a fundamental issue in the heated debates about
ethics that subsequently took place.</p>
<p>In Britain, in the decade that followed the publication of the
Tractatus, inspired also by Russell’s lectures on ‘The Philosophy of
Logical Atomism’ (1918), members of what came to be called the Cambridge
School of Analysis undertook analyses of all kinds of propositions in an
endeavour to uncover their ‘real’ logical form, and engaged in debate
about the nature of analysis. Key figures here were Susan Stebbing
(1885–1943) and John Wisdom (1904–93). By the mid-1930s, however,
scepticism about the whole project of reductive analysis grew and
philosophers began focusing more on clarificatory conceptual analysis,
aimed at resolving philosophical problems in a piecemeal fashion rather
than seeking to develop any systematic account. This proceeded alongside
the development of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and his own critique
of the Tractatus, which influenced philosophers through attendance at
his lectures and notes that were made of those lectures, as well as
dictated material such as the Blue and Brown Books.</p>
<p>With the rise of Nazi Germany, many of the logical
positivists—including Carnap, Hans Reichenbach (1891–1953), Herbert
Feigl (1902–88), Carl Hempel (1905–97), and Gustav Bergmann
(1906–87)—emigrated to the United States, and this boosted the interest
there in the Tractatus, in the areas of both mathematical logic and
philosophy. Max Black (1909–88), who moved to the USA in 1940 and
published the first companion to the Tractatus in 1964, Norman Malcolm,
who had studied with Wittgenstein (see §1 above), Wilfrid Sellars
(1912–89), Donald Davidson (1917–2003), Hilary Putnam (1926–2016), and
Stanley Cavell (1926–2018) are just some of the leading American
philosophers who were significantly influenced by Wittgenstein’s
work.</p>
<p>The impact of the Tractatus was not restricted to Europe and North
America, however. To take just the case of China, it was first
translated into Chinese as early as 1927 by Zhang Shenfu (1893–1986),
partly inspired by Russell’s visit to Beijing in 1920–1. Russell’s
lectures there fuelled the development of mathematical logic and
analytic philosophy in the years that followed, led by the so-called
‘new realist school’ at Tsinghua University. Two philosophers were
especially influential: Jin Yuelin (1895–1984), who visited Britain in
1922 and founded the School of Philosophy at Tsinghua in 1926, and Hung
Tscha (1909–92), who had been a member of the Vienna Circle, writing his
doctorate under Schlick’s supervision, before returning to China in 1937
to promote logical positivism. One of Jin’s students was Wang Hao
(1921–95), who was to go on to do his PhD with W. V. O. Quine
(1908–2000) at Harvard and become a distinguished logician with a deep
interest in Wittgenstein’s philosophy.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, what came to be called ‘ordinary language
philosophy’, pursued not only by Wittgenstein, whose Philosophical
Investigations was finally published in 1953, but also by philosophers
such as Gilbert Ryle (1900–76) and J. L. Austin (1911–60) at Oxford,
dominated the scene in Britain and gained a hold in North America. At
the same time, interest in Frege’s work took off, with translations
appearing for the first time, and this led to a renewal of interest in
the Tractatus. Whereas, before, Wittgenstein had been associated more
with Russell, as the joint architects of the project of logical atomism,
the influence of Frege began to be stressed, spearheaded by Elizabeth
Anscombe and later by Cora Diamond. Anscombe’s ground-breaking book on
the Tractatus was published in 1959, and a series of important articles
by Diamond began appearing in the late 1970s, which inspired the ‘new
Wittgensteinian’ debate outlined in §5 above. Her later articles were
collected in her aptly named Reading Wittgenstein with Anscombe
(2019).</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein’s later writings were published, debate about the
continuities and discontinuities in the development of his thinking
intensified. Today there is scholarly consensus that his earlier ideas
were not rejected altogether, but there is much less agreement not just
about the details of this development but also about the assessment of
his ideas. When Michael Dummett published his pioneering book on Frege,
Frege: Philosophy of Language, in 1973, arguing that Frege should be
seen as the founder of modern (truth-conditional) semantic theory,
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus was co-opted onto this programme, and
Wittgenstein’s later critique of his earlier ideas became part of the
debate about the viability of theories of meaning. In some quarters his
Tractatus is now valued far more highly than any of his later work,
echoing a view that Russell famously expressed in comparing
Wittgenstein’s earlier and later work:</p>
<p>The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted
to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems
of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so
I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the
contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have
invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary.26</p>
<p>This is deeply unfair, however. The seriousness of Wittgenstein’s
thinking comes out throughout his life, and if anyone can be called a
philosophical genius, then it is surely him. One way to show that
Russell is wrong is to bring out the continuities in Wittgenstein’s
philosophy. The most fundamental continuity is his concern with the
limits of language and thought. Philosophy is the discipline that works
at the very cutting-edge of thinking, forging new conceptual tools and
creating richer forms of expression in making sense of our evolving
world, thought, and language, while continually negotiating the
boundaries between sense and nonsense. Inevitably, one transgresses the
boundaries in trying to find them, and such transgression may even be
necessary to critique and transform our conceptual schemes.
Wittgenstein, more than perhaps any other philosopher, was acutely aware
of the drive to philosophize and the dangers it inevitably brings, and
deeply sensitive to the phenomenology of philosophical thinking. The
Tractatus crystallizes the thoughts that he had about all this in the
earliest period of his intellectual life and set the agenda not only for
his own subsequent thinking but also for much of the philosophizing that
was inspired by the linguistic turn that he played such a central role
in inaugurating.</p>

<p>19 On the translation of proposition 2 and of ‘Sachverhalten’, in
particular, see the relevant explanatory note, where there is
clarification of Wittgenstein’s conception, complementing what follows
here.</p>
<p>20 Frege, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik, §62.</p>
<p>21 There are in fact two Sheffer functions, ‘neither … nor’ (NOR) and
‘not both’ (NAND). Sheffer originally used ‘|’ for the former, but ‘↓’
is now standardly used for this (and called the Peirce arrow), with ‘|’
reserved for ‘not both’ (and which is what is now called the Sheffer
stroke, rather confusingly in the present context). Wittgenstein uses
‘|’ in 5.101 when he symbolizes ‘neither p nor q’, and this (Sheffer’s
original) usage is followed here.</p>
<p>22 To avert possible misunderstanding at this point, though, what is
‘transcendental’, understood as the limits (or conditions of
possibility) of language, thought, and the world, must be distinguished
from what is ‘transcendent’, as what (supposedly) lies outside those
limits, the idea of which Wittgenstein rejects.</p>
<p>23 On the issues involved in translating this key proposition, see
the explanatory note to it.</p>
