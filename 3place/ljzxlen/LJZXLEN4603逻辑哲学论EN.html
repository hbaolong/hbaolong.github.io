<p>TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS</p>
<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was born into a wealthy Austrian
family at the centre of Vienna’s cultural life at the end of the
nineteenth century. The youngest of eight children, he was educated at
home until he was 14, and studied mechanical engineering in Berlin from
1906 to 1908 and then aeronautical engineering in Manchester from 1908
to 1911. During this time, he became interested in the foundations of
mathematics, inspired by the writings of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand
Russell. Recommended by Frege to study with Russell, he enrolled as a
research student at Cambridge in February 1912 and worked with Russell
until he went to Norway in October 1913 to develop his ideas. On the
outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Austro-Hungarian army,
fighting on the Eastern and Italian Fronts. Drawing on remarks made in
notebooks throughout this period, the text of what became the Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus was essentially completed during a period of leave
in 1918. Captured at the end of the war in Italy, he spent ten months in
Italian prisoner-of-war camps before returning to Vienna in August 1919.
Having given away a considerable inheritance, he trained as a
schoolteacher and taught in various Austrian villages from 1920 to 1926.
The Tractatus was published in German in 1921 and in English in 1922,
translated by Frank Ramsey. Its publication established Wittgenstein’s
renown and his influence as a philosopher grew, particularly amongst
members of the Vienna Circle and in Cambridge. He returned to Cambridge
in 1929 to be awarded a doctorate and a fellowship at Trinity College.
In 1939 he succeeded G. E. Moore as Professor of Philosophy at
Cambridge, a position he held until resigning in 1947. He died of cancer
in 1951. Posthumous publication of Philosophical Investigations (1953),
On Certainty (1969), and a substantial Nachlass contributed to
Wittgenstein’s position as a central figure in the development of the
analytic tradition in philosophy.</p>
<p>Michael Beaney is Professor of History of Analytic Philosophy at the
Humboldt University in Berlin, Regius Chair of Logic at the University
of Aberdeen in Scotland, and Visiting He Lin Chair Professor of
Philosophy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Educated at Oxford, he
taught at various universities in London and Yorkshire before taking up
his current posts. He is the editor of The Oxford Handbook of the
History of Analytic Philosophy and author of Analytic Philosophy: A Very
Short Introduction. As well as the history of analytic philosophy, his
research interests include Chinese philosophy, creativity,
historiography, and philosophical methodology.</p>
<h4 id="preface-and-acknowledgements">Preface and Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>In my second year as an undergraduate at Oxford, at an introduction
to transcendental meditation, I met someone who had just moved to
Oxford, having given up his studies in philosophy at Cambridge. He told
me that the only book worth reading was Wittgenstein’s Philosophical
Investigations. I bought a copy at Blackwells on the way back and began
reading it straightaway. I was gripped, and Wittgenstein has been with
me ever since. Wittgenstein’s Later Philosophy was one of the options
available as a PPE student, and I took it in my final year with Peter
Hacker, who initiated me into its mysteries. Peter may well regard some
of the views I now have on Wittgenstein as heretical, but I am grateful
to him for challenging me both then and in all his subsequent writing to
read Wittgenstein with the utmost scholarly care. Since the opening
sections of Wittgenstein’s Investigations discuss his earlier ideas, I
was inevitably led to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. That text is
notoriously difficult, but the received view in Oxford at the time was
that it contained a set of assumptions and claims that Wittgenstein
spent the rest of his life criticizing. Although he had officially
rejected metaphysics in the Tractatus, there were still some lingering
metaphysical assumptions, and these had to be rooted out as well by a
more ‘grammatical’ investigation.</p>
<p>As a postgraduate, I continued to work on Wittgenstein’s philosophy
but now realized the importance of Russell’s and especially Frege’s work
in understanding what Wittgenstein had been attempting to achieve in the
Tractatus. He both develops some of their views and offers a powerful
critique of others, and it became clear that there was more continuity
between his early and later philosophy than many believed. Some of the
ideas of the Tractatus continue to influence philosophers today, while
others are transformed in subtle ways in his later work, which is only
gradually being appreciated. My doctoral dissertation was on Frege and
Wittgenstein, and I have been teaching and writing about their thought
and the history of analytic philosophy, more generally, ever since. One
of my favourite subjects at school had been German, for which I have to
thank my teacher Ian Waters, and I translated some of Frege’s work for
the edition I published in 1997, The Frege Reader. This made available,
in a single volume, a selection of the key texts that are essential to
understanding analytic philosophy today—and Wittgenstein’s philosophy,
in particular.</p>
<p>In September 2018, Luciana O’Flaherty of OUP contacted me to ask
about publishing the Tractatus in the World’s Classics series, since it
would be out of copyright in 2022, seventy years after Wittgenstein’s
death, and if so, whether a new translation was preferable to the
original one. I assured her that the Tractatus should be included in the
series, as the classic of early twentieth-century analytic philosophy,
and that a new translation was essential. Having translated some of
Frege’s writings, I offered to translate it myself, not least as I used
my own translations of it anyway, or revised those of others, in my
teaching and writing. Luciana welcomed the offer and we met to discuss
the project. I am grateful to Luciana for all her advice and support in
guiding this project through from beginning to end.</p>
<p>I prepared a first draft of the translation in teaching a course on
the Tractatus at the Humboldt University in Berlin in Summer Semester
2020. I circulated a document with three columns—the original German, my
draft translation, and notes on the translation. The aim of the course
was not just to make sense of the Tractatus but also to appreciate the
issues involved in philosophical translation. The participants, many of
whom were native German speakers, were encouraged to comment on the
translation, which helped in improving it. I thank the following for
their valuable contributions: Andreas Berghaus, Sophia Bobic, Simon
Brausch, Rebecca Eilfort, Joao Fidalgo, Milan Hartwig, Solveig Hepp, Ben
Jähnert, Xiaolan Liang, Moritz Markowski, Lea Mosandl, Ben Rangnick, Tom
Raysmith, Josephine Schulze, Peter Schwarz, Lukas Sonnabend, Martin
Spielhagen, Myriam Stihl, Troy Vine, Arjun Wendrich, Christoph Werner,
Bastian Wessalowski, Tao Xu, and Jiantao Zhang. The course was one of
the most enjoyable that I have taught (despite having to do so online
during the pandemic) and our discussions were instructive. The native
German speakers often disagreed about what certain terms meant, which
showed the importance of consulting widely, with the interpretive issues
explained. We also considered alternative renderings and how they might
be back translated into German, which helped us appreciate
Wittgenstein’s actual formulations. In the end, though, the translator
must rely on their own interpretation of the text and their
native-speaker knowledge of the language into which they are translating
to find the best rendering. So I take full responsibility for any errors
or infelicities that remain.</p>
<p>That same summer of 2020 I co-organized with David Stern a two-day
online workshop on translating the Tractatus, supported by a grant from
the British Society for the History of Philosophy, for which I record
our thanks. David had told me at a conference on Wittgenstein the
previous autumn that he was doing a new translation of the Tractatus for
Cambridge University Press, as part of a project that involved
(re)translation of Wittgenstein’s writings leading up to the Tractatus.
We agreed to collaborate, not on the translation itself, on which we had
different views (such as on the rendering of ‘Satz’) and different
constraints (such as our primary intended readership), but on thinking
about the principles of translation to be followed. We invited various
Wittgenstein scholars with an interest in issues of translation and
interpretation, with a view to co-editing a collection of papers on the
subject. The participants in the workshop were Cora Diamond, Philip
Ebert, Juliet Floyd, Jim Klagge, Michael Kremer, Alfred Nordman, Martin
Pilch, Alois Pichler, Erich Reck, Katia Saporiti, Joachim Schulte, Hans
Sluga, Mark Textor, and two of my PhD students, Troy Vine and Thomas
Raysmith, who made notes on the meetings. David and I each circulated in
advance a paper formulating our views on translating the Tractatus, and
we received extremely helpful feedback, for which we are both very
grateful. I am also indebted to David for the exchanges we have had, and
our ongoing collaboration on the edited collection. I have not yet seen
a draft of his translation, other than of a few key propositions, but I
look forward to that, as a valuable complement to my own. The more good
translations there are of a text, the more one can triangulate on its
meaning.</p>
<p>Following the workshop I circulated various drafts of the
translation, as I continued to revise it, not just to the participants
in the workshop but to several others, including Wolfgang Kienzler, Han
Linhe, Jiang Yi, David Hyder, Joshua Eisenthal, and Sophia Arbeiter. I
also gave a talk on translating the Tractatus at an online conference
organized by Huang Min at Sun Yat-sen University in China in November
2021. I thank all those who sent me comments (including those just
named), often on specific terms and passages on which they had
particular views. I did not always follow their advice, but it helped in
coming to what I hope were the right decisions. I would especially like
to thank Wolfgang Kienzler and Martin Pilch for detailed email exchange
on numerous passages.</p>
<p>Drafts of the editorial material have also been discussed with
various people, including members of the Research Colloquium that I run
at the Humboldt University in Berlin, students taking my online course
on the Tractatus at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and some of my
colleagues at the University of Aberdeen. For comments on this, as well
as on specific points of translation, I am grateful to the following:
Roland Bolz, Paul Cultus, Yael Gazit, Yuchen Guo, Eva Henke, Hang Huang,
Jing Huang, Asher Jiang, Oscar Joffe, Jesper Kallestrup, Louis Kohlmann,
Martha Kunicki, Xiaolan Liang, Matthias Statzkowski, Ulrich Stegmann,
Norman Stockman, Hamid Taieb, Stephan Torre, and Tue Trinh. Three others
deserve special thanks: Cheryl Misak and Martin Pilch (again), who
helped me with the Note on the Text, and Erich Reck, who provided
detailed comments on the penultimate draft of the Introduction.
Responsibility for these as well, of course, remains with me.</p>
<p>As always, I am grateful to my wife Sharon Macdonald and our children
Tara, Thomas, and Harriet, for many discussions over the years as we
have grappled with the German language in our different ways, but
especially for comments on specific issues in translating the Tractatus.
Sharon has read and provided invaluable help on all the editorial
material, as well as the translation itself, and patiently supported me
in the periods of obsessive focus that were required to complete the
various parts.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank all those at OUP who have helped
prepare this book for production, not just Luciana O’Flaherty (again)
but also (and especially in this last stage) Henry Clarke, Bharath
Krishnamoorthy, Daniel Gill, and the eagle-eyed copy-editor Dorothy
McCarthy. I write this Preface almost a century to the day after the
publication of the first English translation of the Tractatus. I hope
that this new translation, and the editorial material provided, will
usher in a new phase in the reception of this extraordinary work.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in
German in 1921 and in English translation in 1922, is one of the most
important philosophical works of the twentieth century and one of the
founding texts of analytic philosophy, which is now the dominant
philosophical tradition in the world. It offers an impressively
integrated account of the relationship between language, logic, and the
world, rooted in the conception of propositions as pictures, that has
had a powerful influence on philosophical thinking ever since. Anyone
who reads the text for the first time, with little knowledge of
Wittgenstein’s philosophical background, however, will struggle to make
much sense of the details. It may strike one as intriguing, exciting,
and profound, but also intimidating and obscure, especially as one
encounters the propositions about logic. There is a crystalline and
aphoristic quality to many of the propositions, which make them
memorable and quotable, not least the famous last proposition, but
exactly what they mean is far from clear. The numbering system suggests
a sophisticated organization, yet one struggles to understand how
everything fits together. And most notoriously, by the time one gets to
the end of the book, we find Wittgenstein telling us that the
propositions of the Tractatus are nonsense, which we have to get over if
we are to see the world correctly. Does he really mean that all of the
propositions are nonsense, and if some are not, then which ones and how
do we tell? How can we understand nonsensical propositions at all, and
what on earth are we then to make of the book?</p>
<p>With all the controversy and variety of interpretations that the book
has generated over the last century, purists may wish to insist that any
new edition of the Tractatus should present the text exactly as it
originally appeared (and ideally, if in translation, then with the
original German on facing pages) with no scholarly apparatus, to ensure
that editorial bias does not colour the reader’s understanding. The only
exception might be to allow the original introduction by Bertrand
Russell, with whom Wittgenstein had worked in developing his earliest
ideas. This had been felt necessary to ensure publication, since, at the
time, Wittgenstein (at least as a philosopher) was almost completely
unknown, while Russell was one of the most famous living philosophers of
all. (See the Note on the Text, which follows.) Wittgenstein had never
been happy with Russell’s introduction, however, and more than enough
time has elapsed for a new introduction, with the proper editorial
apparatus that we have now come to expect for fresh editions of classic
texts, especially in this Oxford World’s Classics series. Although
fierce disputes continue within the scholarly community about the
interpretation of the Tractatus, there is enough consensus about many of
the ideas and themes for an account that reflects this to help a reader
find their way through the text on a first reading, and the disputes can
be presented in such a way as to enable a reader to make up their own
mind. One aim of this new Introduction is to provide just such an
account, but it will also place the Tractatus in the wider context of
Wittgenstein’s life and works, the main influences on him, and its place
in the history of philosophy.</p>
<p>Before turning to his life and works, a few words must first be said
about the new translation that has been done for this edition. (A fuller
account is provided in the Note on the Text.) The original translation,
although appearing under the name of C. K. Ogden, was in fact mainly
done by F. P. Ramsey, and was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in
1922. Although Wittgenstein himself advised on the translation, it shows
signs of its age, and is clunky in many places. A second translation, by
D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness, was published in 1961 and revised in
1974, also published by Routledge and Kegan Paul. This improves on the
earlier translation in several key respects, but also introduces new
inadequacies and occasionally strays too far from the original German
text in trying to be more fluent (perhaps a sign of its being done in
the heyday of ‘ordinary language philosophy’ in Oxford). A fresh
translation is certainly needed, benefiting from the extensive debate
about Wittgenstein’s Tractatus that has taken place over the last
century, much of which has also involved discussion about the merits of
the two translations. A glossary and explanatory notes are also
provided, which were not included in either of the first two
translations, to help the understanding of key terms and passages and to
alert the reader to significant issues of interpretation that depend on
the exact rendering of the German original.</p>
<h4 id="life-and-works">1. Life and works</h4>
<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on 26 April 1889, the youngest
of eight children, the oldest—Hermine—being fifteen years older than
him. His father was the industrialist Karl Wittgenstein (1847–1913), one
of the wealthiest men in Austria, and his mother was Leopoldine (Poldy)
Wittgenstein (born Kalmus, 1850–1926), who was musically gifted and made
music central to the Wittgenstein household. They were important patrons
of the arts in Viennese society and hosted many concerts in their house.
Music was an important part of Ludwig’s life, and there are comparisons
between written language and musical notation in the Tractatus. But he
wrote little specifically about music, on the ground that such things
should be allowed to speak for themselves. As he later put it, ‘Music
conveys to us itself !’ (BB, p. 178) This idea that certain things
‘speak for themselves’ was fundamental to his philosophy throughout his
life.</p>
<p>Ludwig had three sisters and four brothers. The three oldest brothers
all committed suicide: Hans in 1902, Rudolf in 1904, and Kurt in 1918,
who shot himself rather than surrender to the Italians at the end of the
First World War. Paul Wittgenstein became a well-known pianist, who lost
his right arm in the war but carried on playing with just his left hand.
Ravel later wrote his Concerto for the Left Hand for him. As well as
Hermine, who gradually took over the role of organizing the family, his
sisters were Margarete (Gretl), who was to marry the wealthy American
Jeremy Stonborough and have her wedding portrait painted by Klimt, and
Helene (Lenka), who married Max Salzer and whose daughter Clara married
Ludwig’s later close friend Arvid Sjögren. It was for Margarete that
Ludwig was to design what is now known as the Wittgenstein house in
Vienna in the late 1920s.</p>
<p>Ludwig was educated at home until 1903, when his father changed his
views on how his children should be taught after the death of Hans (but
sadly too late for Rudolf) and sent Ludwig to a Realschule (which
offered a more practical education than a Gymnasium) in Linz. (Adolf
Hitler, who was just six days older than Wittgenstein, also attended
this school from 1900 to 1904, but Hitler was a year behind his year
group and Wittgenstein was a year ahead.) He stayed there until 1906,
when he went to study science and engineering at the technical
university in Berlin, gaining his diploma in May 1908. From there he
moved to Manchester to pursue research in aeronautical engineering,
helping to design a jet engine. It was here that he read Bertrand
Russell’s Principles of Mathematics (1903) and Gottlob Frege’s Basic
Laws of Arithmetic (1893, 1903) and became interested in the foundations
of mathematics, intrigued by the paradox that Russell found in Frege’s
system (see below). In 1909 he wrote to Philip Jourdain, a colleague of
Russell’s at Cambridge, offering a solution to the paradox. Having shown
it to Russell, Jourdain wrote back criticizing the attempted solution,
which discouraged Wittgenstein for a while, but by then the fascination
had taken root and he gradually became more and more obsessed by
philosophical questions.</p>
<p>Having written to Frege in the summer of 1911, Wittgenstein was
invited to visit him in Jena, which he did a few weeks later.
Wittgenstein is reported as saying: ‘At this first meeting with Frege my
own ideas were so unclear that he was able to wipe the floor with me.’
Frege nevertheless encouraged him to come again, and advised him to
study with Russell at Cambridge.1 So it was that Russell got a knock on
his college door on 18 October and the lives of both men changed
dramatically. Wittgenstein attended Russell’s lectures that term,
unofficially, and had discussions with him. He officially registered as
a research student at Trinity College on 1 February 1912 to work with
Russell, and met him regularly until October 1913, when he went to
Norway to work in isolation on the philosophical problems that occupied
him. He visited Frege twice more, on his way back to Vienna from
Cambridge in December 1912 and again in December 1913, on his way back
from Norway, and had fruitful discussions with him. In March 1914 G. E.
Moore (1873–1958), then a lecturer at Cambridge, visited Wittgenstein in
Norway and took notes of the ideas that he had been formulating. These,
together with notes that Wittgenstein had dictated for Russell before he
left for Norway, have survived and shed important light on the
development of his ideas.2</p>
<p>On the outbreak of the First World War Wittgenstein decided to enlist
in the Austrian army and he served both on the front line, winning
awards for bravery, and in an artillery workshop. Throughout the war he
continued to work out his ideas, writing remarks in notebooks, several
of which also survived and were published in 1961 as Notebooks
1914–1916. He had periods of leave in which he selected some of these
remarks and arranged and revised them into what became the Tractatus,
which was essentially complete before he returned at the end of
September 1918 to the Italian Front, where he was captured in early
November 1918 as the war ended. He spent the next ten months in Italian
prisoner-of-war camps, but managed to get a corrected copy of his
manuscript sent to Russell. He was finally released in August 1919, and
met with Russell at The Hague in December 1919 to explain his ideas to
him and enlist his support in getting the Tractatus published, which
eventually appeared in 1921. (For further details of the composition of
the Tractatus and the difficulties Wittgenstein had in getting it
published, see §4 below and the Note on the Text.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein returned to Vienna from the war a changed man. His
father had died in 1913 and he had received a substantial inheritance.
Before the war he had arranged for some of it to be given to various
writers and artists, among them Rainer Maria Rilke, Georg Trakl, and
Oskar Kokoschka, but in 1919 he formally signed all the rest of it over
to his siblings Hermine, Helene, and Paul (Margarete was excluded,
having married into further wealth). From that point on he lived
frugally, often depending, later, on friends to look after him. More
importantly, consistent with his claim in the Tractatus that he had
solved all the problems of philosophy, he gave up philosophy and decided
to become a schoolteacher. Having trained in Vienna, he then taught at
various remote village schools in Lower Austria from 1920 to 1926. Frank
Ramsey (1903–30) visited him twice during this period to discuss the
ideas of the Tractatus with him, and Wittgenstein visited Manchester and
Cambridge in the summer of 1925, but other than this he had limited
philosophical contact. Having been accused of ill-treating some of the
children in the school in which he was then teaching (but subsequently
cleared) in April 1926, Wittgenstein resigned and returned to Vienna.
From 1926 to 1928 he helped design and supervise the building of a house
for his sister Margarete, a house influenced by the modernism of Adolf
Loos (1870–1933) and reflecting Wittgenstein’s own personality, with its
austerity, precision, and attention to detail.</p>
<p>It was during this period that he was also gradually drawn back into
philosophy by meetings with members of the Vienna Circle, a group that
had been formed around Moritz Schlick (1882–1936) to discuss philosophy,
especially philosophy of science and epistemology. Schlick was Professor
of Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature) in Vienna, and the group
became known as the logical positivists (or logical empiricists), famous
for their rejection of metaphysics and for their endorsement of a
‘scientific’ approach to philosophy. The logical positivists, who
included Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), Otto Neurath (1882–1945), and
Friedrich Waismann (1896–1959), were strongly influenced by the
Tractatus, which they had discussed in detail in the mid-1920s, seeing
in Wittgenstein—at least in some respects—a kindred spirit.3 Another
event that played a role in Wittgenstein’s return to philosophy was a
lecture given by the mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881–1966) in
Vienna in March 1928 on intuitionism, which inspired Wittgenstein to
think more deeply about logic and mathematics.</p>
<p>In January 1929 Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge and took up
philosophy again, gradually recognizing the problems in his earlier
views and determined to address them. One of the first results of this
work was ‘Some Remarks on Logical Form’, in which he tried to resolve
one of these problems (see §6.1 below). This paper was published in the
proceedings of the annual conference of the Aristotelian Society and
Mind Association, held in July 1929, although at the conference itself
Wittgenstein talked about something else instead—generality and infinity
in mathematics (WC, p. 172). The paper ended up being not only the first
thing he published after the Tractatus but also the last in his
lifetime. Although he remained occupied with philosophical problems for
the rest of his life, continuing his practice of writing remarks in
notebooks and selecting and revising them into typescripts, he was never
satisfied with what he produced, and nothing more was published until
after his death in 1951.</p>
<p>One such typescript was Philosophical Remarks, not published until
1975, which he wrote for his successful application for a five-year
research fellowship at Trinity College, awarded in December 1930. Here
he began to criticize some of his earlier ideas and develop new forms of
thinking. This was carried forward in all his subsequent writings, from
Philosophical Grammar (published in 1974, dating from 1930–3) and The
Blue and Brown Books (published in 1958, dating from 1933–5) to On
Certainty (published in 1969, dating from the last years of his life,
1949–51). The most famous of all his later works is Philosophical
Investigations, drafts of which he had ready to submit at various points
in the 1940s, but which remained unpublished on his death. It finally
appeared, translated by Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001), who had studied
with Wittgenstein, in 1953. This has often been seen as the mature
statement of his so-called ‘later philosophy’, but few scholars now are
happy with this division of Wittgenstein’s philosophy into ‘early’ and
‘later’. Some have spoken of a ‘middle Wittgenstein’, between the
Tractatus and the Investigations, or of a ‘third Wittgenstein’,
reflected in his work after the Investigations was essentially finished,
represented in On Certainty, among other writings. But the truth is that
Wittgenstein’s ideas evolved continually from 1929, deepening his
critique of the Tractatus and developing a whole range of new ideas,
themes, concerns, and methods, not least in responding to the views of
his contemporaries and earlier thinkers.</p>
<p>During his research fellowship Wittgenstein gave lectures at
Cambridge, on diverse topics from logic and the foundations of
mathematics to aesthetics and religious belief. Notes were made and have
since been published on many of these lectures, and there are numerous
first-hand reports of his lecturing style. Norman Malcolm (1911–90), for
example, who attended his lectures in 1939, writes in his Memoir:</p>
<p>His lectures were given without preparation and without notes. He
told me that once he had tried to lecture from notes but was disgusted
with the result; the thoughts that came out were ‘stale’, or, as he put
it to another friend, the words looked like ‘corpses’ when he began to
read them. In the method that he came to use his only preparation for
the lecture, as he told me, was to spend a few minutes before the class
met, recollecting the course that the inquiry had taken at the previous
meetings. At the beginning of the lecture he would give a brief summary
of this and then he would start from there, trying to advance the
investigation with fresh thoughts. He told me that the only thing that
made it possible for him to conduct his lecture classes in this
extemporaneous way was the fact that he had done and was doing a vast
amount of thinking and writing about all the problems under discussion.
This is undoubtedly true; nevertheless, what occurred in these class
meetings was largely new research.4</p>
<p>In 1936, after his research fellowship had come to an end,
Wittgenstein decided to return to Norway, and he stayed there from
August 1936 to December 1937, with short breaks back in Vienna and
Cambridge. This was when he wrote a draft of the first 188 sections of
the Investigations, and what became Part I of Remarks on the Foundations
of Mathematics (published in 1967, dating from 1937–44), which had
originally been conceived as continuing his discussion in the
Investigations. He returned to Vienna afterwards but left before the
annexation (Anschluss) of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938, when he
was forced to choose between applying for German citizenship (as an
Austrian) or British citizenship. German citizenship was problematic for
the Wittgenstein family because of their Jewish ancestry. While Ludwig’s
maternal grandmother came from an established Austrian Catholic family,
his other grandparents had been born into Jewish families, although his
maternal grandfather had been brought up as a Catholic and both of his
paternal grandparents had converted to Protestantism before they
married. Ludwig decided to go back to lecturing at Cambridge and apply
for British citizenship, and in both of these he was helped by John
Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), the Cambridge economist, who was able to
pull the necessary strings.</p>
<p>In February 1939 Wittgenstein succeeded Moore as Professor of
Philosophy at Cambridge, which secured his British citizenship, gained
in June 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War.
Throughout 1939 he lectured on the foundations of mathematics, lectures
that were attended by Alan Turing (1912–54), the mathematician and
computer scientist, and he continued to teach until 1941, when he was
allowed to contribute to the war effort, working, first, as a porter in
Guy’s Hospital, London, and then in a medical research unit
investigating ‘wound shock’ in Newcastle upon Tyne. In February 1944 he
was called back to Cambridge to work on his book, but was allowed to do
so in Swansea, where one of his students, Rush Rhees (1905–89), was
teaching. He resumed lecturing in the autumn, this time on the
philosophy of psychology, developing further his ideas in the
Investigations. By the middle of 1946, he finally finished what came to
form Part I of the Investigations, and wrote the preface. But the book
was still not submitted for publication, as he continued to develop his
ideas, material that became Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology
(published in 1980, dating from 1945–8).</p>
<p>In 1947 he resigned from his chair at Cambridge. He had never been
happy as a professional philosopher, and over the years he had grown
increasingly disillusioned with academic life. He spent time in Ireland
(in Galway and Dublin) and the United States (staying with Malcolm at
Cornell), before returning to Cambridge where he was diagnosed with
cancer of the prostate in November 1949. He stayed for a while in Oxford
with Anscombe in 1950, but as his health deteriorated, he moved back to
Cambridge to be looked after in the house of his doctor, Edward Bevan.
In his last letter to Malcolm, dated 16 April 1951, he wrote:</p>
<p>An extraordinary thing has happened to me. About a month ago I
suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I
had been absolutely certain that I’d never again be able to do it. It’s
the first time after more than 2 years that the curtain in my brain has
gone up.—Of course, so far I’ve only worked for about 5 weeks and it may
be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now. (WC, p. 479)</p>
<p>He died a fortnight later, on 29 April 1951. The last entry in his
notebook, in which he reflects on whether one can claim to be dreaming
while drugged (OC, §676), was dated 27 April 1951.</p>
<h4 id="influences-on-wittgenstein">2. Influences on Wittgenstein</h4>
<p>In 1931 Wittgenstein wrote in his notebook of the influences upon
him:</p>
<p>I think there is some truth in my idea that I am really only
reproductive in my thinking. I think I have never invented a line of
thinking but that it was always provided for me by someone else
andandandand I have done no more than passionately taken it up for my
work of clarification. That is how Boltzmann, Hertz, Schopenhauer,
Frege, Russell, Kraus, Loos, Weininger, Spengler, Sraffa have influenced
me. (CV, p. 16)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein does not do justice here to his own creativity but the
list of influences is revealing. He had originally just written ‘Frege,
Russell, Spengler, Sraffa’, but then added the other names above the
line. Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), through his main work, The Decline of
the West, published in two volumes in 1918 and 1922, only influenced him
after the Tractatus was finished, and Piero Sraffa (1898–1983) only
influenced him on his return to Cambridge in 1929. As far as the
Tractatus is concerned, Wittgenstein’s greatest debt is undoubtedly to
Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1882–1970), both of whom
he singles out in his preface to the Tractatus. Here he did indeed
passionately take up their lines of thinking in his work of
clarification. We will consider the influence of Frege and Russell in
turn,5 before looking, much more briefly, at the influence of Heinrich
Hertz (1857–94), Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), and Arthur Schopenhauer
(1788–1860).</p>
<p>2.1. Frege’s Influence</p>
<p>Frege is one of the main founders of modern logic—of what is now
known as predicate or quantificational logic, a form of logic
(understood here as logical theory) that quickly proved to be far more
powerful than traditional logic, which had combined (Aristotelian)
syllogistic theory and (Stoic) propositional logic. Propositional logic,
which is now seen as more basic, and on which Frege also built, concerns
the logical relations between propositions, represented as ‘p’, ‘q’,
‘r’, etc., and their logical compounds, propositions combined by means
of one or more logical connectives, such as ‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if …
then …’, yielding ‘not p’, ‘p and q’, ‘p or q’, ‘if p, then q’, and so
on. Here is just a sample of the logical relations that obtain between
such propositions and their compounds. The conjunctive proposition ‘p
and q’, for example, implies the disjunctive proposition ‘p or q’
(though not vice versa), which we can represent as the conditional
proposition ‘If p and q, then p or q’. ‘If p, then q’ is equivalent to
‘if not q, then not p’ (its contrapositive), and ‘p and q’ is equivalent
to ‘not (not p or not q)’, showing the interdefinability of the logical
connectives. The various relations can be formulated as logical laws.
For example, ‘not (p and not p)’ is the law (or principle) of
non-contradiction: a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.
‘p or not p’ is the law of excluded middle: of any proposition, either
it or its negation is true. It is natural to think that logical laws
tell us something, but one of Wittgenstein’s most important claims in
the Tractatus is that logical propositions (logical laws and all that
follows from them) are senseless, a claim that was seen as clarifying
their status (see below).</p>
<p>Syllogistic theory is concerned with the logical relations between
four specific kinds of proposition, ‘All As are Bs’, ‘No As are Bs’,
‘Some As are Bs’, and ‘Some As are not Bs’, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent
the relevant predicate (what is being attributed to something), and
‘all’, no’, and ‘some’ are quantifier terms, stating how much of
something is under consideration. Here again there are logical relations
to make explicit: ‘All As are Bs’ implies ‘Some As are Bs’, for example,
while contradicting ‘Some As are not Bs’ (as Aristotle construed these).
While traditional logic gave a coherent account of these kinds of
proposition, however, it had difficulty handling propositions with more
than one quantifier, such as ‘All philosophers respect some logician’.
Frege’s achievement was to invent a notation for quantification that
enabled him to formalize propositions involving multiple
quantification.</p>
<p>Frege’s key move lay in extending function–argument analysis from
mathematics to logic. In analytic geometry, in representing a line as y
= ax + b, we exhibit y as a function of x, where x represents the
argument of the function and a and b are constants, a being the gradient
of the line and b the point where the line cuts the y-axis on a graph.
If a = 2 and b = 3, for example, then we have the function y = 2x + 3:
for argument x = 1, the value of the function is 5; for x = 2, y = 7,
and so on. Frege generalized the idea: not just mathematical equations
but all propositions can be analysed in function–argument terms. Take
the simplest kind of proposition, ascribing a predicate to a subject,
such as ‘Gottlob is human’. Traditional logic had analysed this as
having the form ‘S is P’, with ‘S’ representing the subject (‘Gottlob’)
and ‘P’ the predicate (‘human’), connected by the copula (‘is’). Frege,
however, analysed it as having the form ‘Fa’, with ‘a’ representing the
argument (‘Gottlob’) and ‘Fx’ the function (‘x is human’), the variable
x indicating where the argument term goes to complete the proposition.
‘Gottlob is human’ is thus taken to be the value of the functional
expression ‘x is human’ for the argument term ‘Gottlob’.</p>
<p>Relational propositions are analysed similarly, in this case as
functions of two or more arguments. In analysing ‘Gottlob is shorter
than Bertrand’, for example, ‘Gottlob’ and ‘Bertrand’ are taken as the
argument terms and ‘x is shorter than y’ as the relational expression,
symbolized as ‘Rxy’ or ‘xRy’. The power of function–argument analysis,
however, only fully comes out in analysing propositions involving
quantifiers. Take the proposition ‘All logicians are human’. In
traditional logic this was seen as having the same form as ‘Gottlob is
human’, the subject being ‘all logicians’ rather than ‘Gottlob’, and the
copula plural (‘are’) rather than singular (‘is’). But on Frege’s
analysis, it has a very different form, symbolized in modern notation as
‘(∀x) (Lx ⊃ Hx)’, read as ‘For all x, if x is a logician, then x is
human’. Here what we have are two functional expressions, ‘x is a
logician’ and ‘x is human’, joined by the logical connective ‘if … then
…’ (symbolized by ‘⊃’) and bound by the universal quantifier (‘for all
x’, represented using an inverted ‘A’). (In the notation that
Wittgenstein takes over from Russell, the universal quantifier is
symbolized simply by ‘(x)’ rather than ‘(∀x)’.6)</p>
<p>‘Some logicians are human’ is also analysed as having a more complex
quantificational form, symbolized in modern notation as ‘(∃x) (Lx
andandandand Hx)’, read as ‘There is some x such that x is a logician
and x is human’. Again what we have here are two functional expressions
joined by a logical connective, in this case ‘and’ (symbolized by
‘andandandand’) and bound by the existential quantifier (‘there is some
x’, represented using a backwards ‘E’). (In the notation that
Wittgenstein takes over from Russell, ‘and’ is symbolized by the full
stop ‘.’ rather than ‘andandandand’. ‘(∃x)’ is used for the existential
quantifier.) With such notation, propositions involving multiple
quantification can be formalized. ‘All philosophers respect some
logician’, for example, turns out to be ambiguous, depending on whether
we are claiming that there is some (at least one) logician whom every
philosopher respects or merely that, for any philosopher, there is some
logician whom they respect (not necessarily the same one).
Quantificational logic provides a neat way of clarifying this
ambiguity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>(∃y) (Ly andandandand (∀x) (Px ⊃ Rxy)).</p></li>
<li><p>(∀x) (Px ⊃ (∃y) (Ly andandandand Rxy)).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first can be read as ‘There is some y such that y is a logician
and for all x, if x is a philosopher, then x respects y’, and the second
as ‘For all x, if x is a philosopher, then there is some y such that y
is a logician and x respects y’. The difference in meaning is reflected
in the order of the quantifiers—either ∃∀ or ∀∃. Furthermore, their
logical relations are different, reflected in their asymmetry: while the
second can be inferred from the first, the first cannot be inferred from
the second (mistakenly thinking that it can is known as the quantifier
shift fallacy).</p>
<p>We see here an excellent example of the power of Frege’s logic. The
use of quantificational notation clarifies the relevant logical
relations and facilitates the drawing and testing of inferences. Frege
called the logical notation he created ‘Begriffsschrift’ (literally,
‘concept-script’), a term that Wittgenstein takes over in the Tractatus,
though he criticizes the precise form that Frege’s (and Russell’s)
notation took (see e.g. 3.325, 5.533). On Wittgenstein’s view, it is
only once ‘everything is in order in our sign-language’ that we attain a
correct logical conception (4.1213). So here, too, one can see him as
taking up in his work of clarification the line of thinking that Frege
invented.</p>
<p>In doing so, Wittgenstein also endorsed function–argument analysis:
‘I construe a proposition—like Frege and Russell—as a function of the
expressions contained in it’ (3.318). But once again, his own account of
this was rather different from theirs. For Frege, the most fundamental
logical relation was the relation of an object’s falling under a
concept, expressed in the most basic kind of thought we can have, such
as in thinking that Gottlob is human: applying the concept human,
understood as a function (‘x is human’), to the particular object named
Gottlob (the name filling the argument-place in the functional
expression). Wittgenstein left it open what the basic kinds of thoughts
were, however: this would be revealed by logical analysis. They might be
relational propositions of the form ‘Rxy’ or ‘Rxyz’ instead. But he
assumed that there was an ultimate level to be reached, comprising what
he called ‘elementary propositions’ (4.21), each understood as a
function of names (4.24). In elaborating on this, he drew on one of the
central ideas of the Tractatus, that a proposition should be seen as a
picture of a state of affairs (2.11 ff.). We will return to this in the
next section.</p>
<p>As to the relationship between elementary propositions and other,
more complex propositions, here, too, he saw a functional relationship:
‘A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions’ (5). He
elaborates this conception in the rest of the 5s (the remarks that
comment on 5), and we will return to this in §4. Once again, then, we
can see Wittgenstein as ‘clarifying’ the line of thinking opened up by
the possibility of function–argument analysis. At the root of this, for
Frege, was the fundamental logical relation of an object’s falling under
a concept, but we can see Wittgenstein as taking the more general idea
of a functional relation itself as the most fundamental.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s account of all this, as elaborated in the Tractatus,
was intended to overcome the various problems that he saw in Frege’s
logic and philosophy—and, as we will shortly see, also in Russell’s
logic and philosophy. Two of the key problems concern Frege’s
distinction between object and concept and what is now known as
Russell’s paradox. The latter will be taken up in discussing Russell’s
influence, so let us consider the first here. Frege regarded the
distinction between object and concept as absolute, characterizing it,
metaphorically, by describing objects as ‘saturated’ and concepts as
‘unsaturated’, reflecting the fact that while an object is represented
by a name, formalized by a letter such as ‘a’, a concept is represented
by a functional expression of the form ‘( ) is F’, where the gap
indicates the argument-place where the name goes, yielding the sentence
‘a is F’, formalized as ‘Fa’, representing the thought that a is F.
Names and concept-words (functional expressions) perform different
semantic roles, which Frege took to indicate an ontological distinction
between object and concept.</p>
<p>Notoriously, however, this distinction was not something that Frege
could formalize in his Begriffsschrift, which he had envisaged as
capable of expressing, in principle, every possible kind of thought. We
might suggest expressing the distinction in ordinary language by saying
‘No objects are concepts’ or, equivalently, ‘No concepts are objects’,
but attempting to formalize this, say, as ‘For all x, if x is an object,
then it is not the case that x is a concept’ (‘(∀x) (Ox ⊃ ~Cx)’,
symbolizing ‘not’ by ‘~’), presupposes that both names (of objects) and
concept-words can go in the argument-place (replacing the variable ‘x’)
in both ‘x is an object’ and ‘x is a concept’. But if ‘x’ is replaced by
a concept-word of the form ‘( ) is F’, then we get ‘( ) is F is an
object’ and ‘( ) is F is a concept’, neither of which is a well-formed
sentence (and would remain ill-formed even if the gap was filled, to
yield, say, ‘a is F is an object’ and ‘a is F is a concept’). So there
is a genuine problem in trying to state the distinction between object
and concept. (Objections might in turn be raised to how the foregoing
explanation is formulated, or to other attempts to state or explain the
distinction.)</p>
<p>The problem raised here is not just a problem for Frege or confined
to just one kind of statement. Wittgenstein recognized this early on in
his thinking. In the notes dictated to Moore in April 1914, he remarks:
‘In order that you should have a language which can express or say
everything that can be said, this language must have certain properties;
and when this is the case, that it has them can no longer be said in
that language or any language’ (NB, 108). In many ways we can see here
the whole project of the Tractatus: to try to say what these properties
are, while recognizing that—ultimately—they cannot be said at all. The
penultimate proposition (6.54) of the Tractatus is already anticipated.
Frege had tried to explain his distinction, on which he felt his whole
logic was based, but had himself realized the difficulties in doing
so—especially in his 1892 essay ‘On Concept and Object’, which
Wittgenstein knew well. In clarifying Frege’s line of thinking in this
case, Wittgenstein generalized the problem and attempted to address
it.</p>
<p>It is in these notes to Moore that he introduces (for the first time)
his key distinction between saying (sagen) and showing (zeigen). Indeed,
the notes open with the claim: ‘Logical so-called propositions show
[the] logical properties of language and therefore of [the] Universe,
but say nothing’ (NB, 108; cf. 6.12). It would be tempting to treat ‘No
objects are concepts’ as just such a logical proposition, showing the
distinction between object and concept that Frege took to underpin his
logical language. On Wittgenstein’s view, however, this temptation
should be resisted, since the concepts of object and of concept are what
he calls formal concepts, different from ‘real’ concepts such as the
concept human. Something is an object, for example, if it can be named
and fall under real concepts; and something is a real concept if it can
be represented by a functional expression and applied to objects.
Something is not an object or concept in virtue of falling under the
supposed concept of object or of concept, respectively. Formal concepts,
he held, were pseudo-concepts, and should not be confused with real
concepts (4.126–4.1274).</p>
<p>According to Wittgenstein, then, when we think it through, ‘No
objects are concepts’ turns out to be nonsense, although, in seeing how
this is so, we are led to recognize the roles that names and
concept-words play in our language, the difference between them being
shown in our different uses of the two kinds of expression.
Distinguishing—in his work of clarification—between formal and real
concepts may also help us in appreciating how many of the things we are
tempted to say in ‘explaining’ such apparent statements as ‘No objects
are concepts’ are problematic and, strictly speaking, nonsensical. (As
we will see, though, he does allow for a genuine category of ‘logical
propositions’, which he characterizes as senseless rather than
nonsensical.)</p>
<p>2.2. Russell’s Influence</p>
<p>Let us now turn to Russell’s influence, beginning with the paradox
that bears his name. This arose in the context of what is called Frege’s
logicist project: the attempt to demonstrate that arithmetic can be
reduced to logic. Frege’s invention of quantificational logic had been
the first step, enabling him to formalize mathematical propositions,
where multiple quantification is prevalent, as in ‘Every number has a
successor’, and give a logical analysis of mathematical reasoning, such
as mathematical induction. The next step was to define the natural
numbers, an informal account of which he gave in his philosophical
masterpiece, The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884).</p>
<p>The essential idea was to define numbers as classes or extensions of
concepts. What is called the extension of a concept is the class or set
of things that fall under that concept. Under the concept human, for
example, fall Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, etc. All of these objects
(people) are members of the class of humans—the extension of the concept
human. According to Frege, this class is itself a kind of object, not a
‘concrete’ (empirical, spatio-temporal) object but an ‘abstract’
object—in this case a logical object, since the idea of a class had
traditionally been seen as a logical notion. The task was then to find
suitable logical concepts. Again, traditionally, two of the most
fundamental concepts of logic are the concepts of identity and of
negation. Take the concept of identity, or more precisely, the concept
of being identical with itself. (Wittgenstein came to reject this
conception of identity (5.53 ff.), but Frege—and Russell—accepted it.)
Every object is identical with itself (so it might obviously seem), in
other words, every object falls under the concept identical with itself.
So the corresponding class has as its members all objects. Now let us
add the concept of negation to form the concept not identical with
itself. Nothing is not identical with itself. So the corresponding class
here has no members at all. This is what logicians call the ‘null
class’, and is here defined purely by means of logical concepts, as the
class of things that are not self-identical.</p>
<p>This null class can then be used to define the first of the natural
numbers, the number 0. The simplest definition is to identify the number
0 with the null class, as is done in modern set theory. Frege offers a
more complicated definition, identifying the number 0 with the class of
classes that have the same number of members as the null class, for
reasons that we need not go into here—except to note his appeal to a
class of classes, which we will pick up shortly. Let us accept the
simplest definition. We can then form the concept is identical with 0
(i.e. the concept is identical with the null class). Here the
corresponding class has just one member, namely, 0 (the null class
itself). This class (the class of things that are identical with 0) is
distinct from its sole member (0, i.e. the null class), since the former
has one member and the latter has no members, so we can identify the
number 1 with this class (the class of things that are identical with
0). We now have two objects, and can then form the concept is identical
with 0 or 1 (using the additional logical concept of disjunction). This
gives us a corresponding class which we can identify with the number 2,
and so on. Starting with the null class, then, and using only logical
concepts, we can define all the natural numbers.</p>
<p>The strategy is ingenious. What could possibly go wrong? Let us
identify two of the key assumptions. First, there is the principle that
for every concept, there is a class of things that fall under it. (If
nothing falls under it, then there is still a class—the null class.)
Second, there is the assumption that classes are themselves objects, in
which case they can also be members of classes. All we need is a
relevant concept under which they fall. The concept class is one such
concept, which means that a class can be a member of itself, as indeed
the class of classes is.</p>
<p>These assumptions, however, lead to a contradiction. Consider the
class of humans. This class is not itself a human, so the class is not a
member of itself. Consider the class of non-humans. This class, too, is
not a human, but in this case it means that it is a member of itself. So
classes divide into those that are members of themselves and those that
are not members of themselves. Consider now the class of all classes
that are not members of themselves. Is this a member of itself or not?
If it is, then since it is the class of all classes that are not members
of themselves, it is not. If it is not, then since this is the defining
property of the classes it contains, it is. We have a contradiction.</p>
<p>This contradiction is now known as Russell’s paradox, since it was
Russell who discovered and first informed Frege of it in writing to him
in June 1902. Given that Frege had defined numbers in terms of
classes—and indeed, classes of classes, as noted above—determined by
logically legitimate concepts, Russell’s paradox was potentially
devastating. Frege recognized its seriousness immediately, and although
he tried to respond to it in the appendix to the second volume of his
Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1903), in which he had been trying to
demonstrate the logicist thesis formally, using his Begriffsschrift, it
soon led to his abandoning the logicist project. Russell, however,
persevered, and developed what he called the theory of types to resolve
it.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the intricacies of the theory as it was eventually
formulated in Principia Mathematica, which Russell wrote with A. N.
Whitehead (1861–1947), his former teacher and then colleague at
Cambridge, the essential idea is that there is a hierarchy of objects
and classes. At the most basic level, there are ‘genuine’
objects—objects such as humans, horses, apples, cups, pens, and so on.
At the next level, there are classes of objects—such as the class of
humans and the class of non-humans (which contains all those genuine
objects that are not humans). Then there are classes of classes of
objects, and so on up the hierarchy. The key point is that something at
any given level can only be a member of a class at the next level up.
This automatically rules out any class being a member of itself; so
Russell’s paradox cannot be generated.</p>
<p>In explaining his theory of types, however, Russell said just the
kinds of thing that Wittgenstein found problematic. Consider the
statement ‘No (genuine) objects are first-level classes’. This is just
as nonsensical as the statement ‘No objects are concepts’ considered
above, and for an analogous reason. To say that something is a
first-level class is to say that it is a member of the class of
first-level classes, but this latter class is a second-level class and
one cannot (sensefully) say or deny of any genuine object that it is a
member of a second-level class, only of a first-level class. In trying
to state the theory of types we violate the very type-restrictions it
encodes. In saying, for example, that ‘Gottlob (as an object) is not a
(first-level) class’, we appear to be saying something about the meaning
of the name ‘Gottlob’, that it (i.e. Gottlob himself) does not have the
property of being a (first-level) class. But this is not how to get
across the relevant type-restrictions, which are shown by our senseful
use of the relevant expressions (3.326). In 3.33 Wittgenstein writes:
‘In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role; it
must permit being drawn up without talk of the meaning of a sign; it
should presuppose only the description of the expressions.’ This gives
us insight, he immediately goes on to say, into Russell’s theory of
types: ‘Russell’s error is shown in his having to talk of the meaning of
signs in drawing up the rules for them’ (3.331).</p>
<p>The theory of types, however, was only one part of Russell’s response
to the paradox. The other main part was his theory of descriptions,
which was intended to address the problem of how definite descriptions,
that is, terms of the form ‘the F’, can contribute to the meaning and
truth-value of propositions in which they occur when they lack—or appear
to lack—a meaning themselves. ‘The class of all classes that are not
members of themselves’ seems meaningful and yet there can be no such
class. If classes are not genuine objects at all, as Russell came to
believe, then what do class terms refer to, and how do we manage to say
true or false things about classes? Analysis of our talk of classes is
clearly called for.</p>
<p>Let us consider Russell’s own famous example of a proposition
involving a definite description:</p>
<p>(K1) The present King of France is bald.</p>
<p>If we were to treat this as having the form ‘S is P’, in accord with
traditional subject–predicate analysis, then we would regard ‘the
present King of France’ as the subject term. But if there is no King of
France, then what is the proposition about? A non-existent object? An
object that has existence in some other sense, say, as ‘subsistence’?
How can we understand such a proposition if the subject term fails to
refer? Can it have a truth-value in such a case?</p>
<p>In ‘On Denoting’, published in 1905, Russell introduced his theory of
descriptions to answer these questions. On the account he offered
(reconstructed here), (K1) is analysed into a conjunction of the
following three propositions, each of which can be readily formalized in
quantificational logic (given in square brackets afterwards), with ‘K’
representing the concept King of France and ‘B’ the concept bald:</p>
<p>(Ka) There is at least one King of France. [(∃x) Kx]</p>
<p>(Kb) There is at most one King of France. [(∀x) (∀y) (Kx andandandand
Ky ⊃ y = x)]</p>
<p>(Kc) Whatever is King of France is bald. [(∀x) (Kx ⊃ Bx)]</p>
<p>Each of these constituent propositions has a quantificational
structure, and can be interpreted as saying something about a concept,
not an object. (Ka) says that the concept King of France is instantiated
(by at least one object), and (Kb) says that it is instantiated by at
most one object (roughly speaking, that were it to seem as if two
objects fell under the concept, then they would actually be the same
object). Taken together, (Ka) and (Kb) thus say that the concept King of
France is uniquely instantiated. (Kc) says that whatever instantiates
the concept King of France also instantiates the concept bald.</p>
<p>Putting all three together, we have:</p>
<p>(K2) There is one and only one King of France and whatever is King of
France is bald.</p>
<p>Formalizing this (and simplifying) yields:</p>
<p>(K3) (∃x) (Kx andandandand (∀y) (Ky ⊃ y = x) andandandand Bx).</p>
<p>This can then be interpreted as saying that the concept King of
France is uniquely instantiated and whatever instantiates this concept
also instantiates the concept bald.</p>
<p>With this analysis we can now answer our earlier questions. The
surface grammatical form of (K1) is misleading: it has a much more
complex logical form. It is not about a non-existent or subsistent
object, but about a concept; and all we need to grasp to understand the
proposition are the two relevant concepts, the concept King of France
and the concept bald, as well as the relevant logical ideas
(conjunction, implication, identity, and existential and universal
quantification). Where there is no King of France, that is, where the
subject term fails to refer, the first conjunct of the analysis—(Ka)—is
false, thereby making (K1) false. So (K1) still comes out as having a
truth-value.</p>
<p>Russell’s theory of descriptions has often been taken—rightly—as a
paradigm of analysis, although it arguably only offers a correct account
of certain uses of definite descriptions. Wittgenstein endorsed it in a
letter to Russell in late 1913: ‘your “Theory of Descriptions” is quite
CERTAINLY correct, even though the individual primitive signs in it are
not at all the ones you thought’ (WC, p. 59). Its philosophical
significance lies in the distinction it made explicit between
grammatical form and logical form. As Wittgenstein put it in the
Tractatus, ‘Russell’s merit is to have shown that the apparent logical
form of a proposition need not be its real one’ (4.0031). (K1) looks as
if it is a simple subject–predicate proposition, misleading us into
thinking that there is a King of France (or must exist in some sense if
we can talk about it), but it turns out to have a more complex,
quantificational structure. We understand it, not by knowing who the
present King of France is (since there is no such person), but by
understanding the relevant concepts—and the existential and universal
quantification involved.</p>
<p>Russell’s approach here had built on Frege’s analysis of number
statements. One of the central claims of Frege’s logicism was that a
number statement is an assertion about a concept.7 In saying that
Jupiter has four moons, for example, one is saying that the concept moon
of Jupiter has four instances,8 which can be readily formalized in
quantificational logic. We can adopt a similar approach in analysing our
talk of classes. Consider the following simple example:</p>
<p>(C1) The class of logicians is a subclass of the class of humans.</p>
<p>Do classes have to ‘exist’ for (C1) to be true? Not at all, on
Russell’s view, since this can be seen as equivalent to, and hence
analysed as (on the lines of (Kc) above), the following:</p>
<p>(C2) Whatever falls under the concept logician falls under the
concept human. [(∀x) (Lx ⊃ Hx)]</p>
<p>(C1), in other words, is just another way of saying that all
logicians are humans, and what (C2) makes clear is that we understand
such a proposition by grasping the concepts logician and human together
with the relevant logical concepts. Classes, on Russell’s view, are
logical fictions, formed from more basic logical concepts in accordance
with certain logical principles. The details need not concern us further
here.</p>
<p>Russell’s theory of descriptions, as well as the analyses that Frege
and Russell provided of mathematical propositions, opened up the
possibility of a whole programme of analysis, ‘reducing’ propositions
that might puzzle or mislead us in one way or another to more basic
propositions whose understanding is (supposedly) less problematic.
Russell called the most basic propositions of all ‘atomic propositions’,
and Wittgenstein called them ‘elementary propositions’. The project of
logical atomism, as it came to be called, was thus to clarify both the
nature of these basic propositions and the process by which complex
propositions were formed from them. This was the main task of
clarification that Wittgenstein took up in response to the lines of
thinking opened up by Frege and Russell, convinced as he soon became
that it was only by doing this that he could show what was wrong with
Russell’s paradox.</p>
<p>2.3. The Influence of Hertz, Boltzmann, and Schopenhauer</p>
<p>There are three others on Wittgenstein’s list of 1931 who also had an
influence on the ideas of the Tractatus, and they deserve mention here
as well. Of the three, only Hertz’s name appears in the Tractatus—in
4.04 and 6.361. Hertz was a German physicist whose key work, The
Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form, was published
posthumously in 1894, which Wittgenstein may have come across at school
and would certainly have been familiar with while studying engineering
in Berlin and Manchester. Hertz conceived scientific theories as
pictorial representations or models, and laid down three criteria for
their acceptability: logical permissibility, correctness, and
appropriateness.9 Hertz’s ‘picture theory’ helped shape Wittgenstein’s
own account of pictures, although it is hard to say exactly how, since
Hertz is only named once in this context. The third criterion is
mentioned under the characterization ‘logical multiplicity’ in 4.04,
where Wittgenstein refers to Hertz’s Mechanics.</p>
<p>Hertz’s influence is much more visible in the 6.3s, where the idea of
different forms of describing the world is considered. Hertz had
discussed three different systems of mechanics, including the one he
advocated. His proposed system replaced Newton’s laws with a single
fundamental law, together with a hypothesis of invisible masses, from
which the rest of mechanics could be derived.10 There is an allusion to
this in 6.343, without mention of either Hertz or his hypothesis (though
they are mentioned in the notebook entry from which this remark came;
NB, p. 36). We can also speculate that both Wittgenstein’s idea of a
general propositional form and his appeal to simple objects (see below)
were inspired by Hertz’s mechanics.</p>
<p>Hertz’s greatest influence on Wittgenstein was arguably his more
philosophical views. In discussing the problems we get into in trying to
reconcile the various relations that have accumulated around the ideas
of force and electricity, Hertz writes:</p>
<p>We have an obscure feeling of this and want to have things cleared
up. Our confused wish finds expression in the confused question as to
the nature of force and electricity. But the answer which we want is not
really an answer to this question. It is not by finding out more and
fresh relations and connections that it can be answered; but by removing
the contradictions existing between those already known, and thus
perhaps by reducing their number. When these painful contradictions are
removed, the question as to the nature of force will not have been
answered; but our minds, no longer vexed, will cease to ask illegitimate
questions.11</p>
<p>This finds a direct echo in Wittgenstein’s own remarks about
philosophy in the Tractatus (see 4.003, 4.112, and especially the 6.5s).
Wittgenstein took up some of Hertz’s lines of thinking, then, not so
much to clarify ideas that Hertz had (though he partly does that) but to
apply them in clarifying the problems he found in Frege’s and Russell’s
work.</p>
<p>Boltzmann was an Austrian physicist who founded statistical
mechanics. As well as a two-volume work on this, he also published a
collection of his popular writings (1905), which Wittgenstein owned and
read. Wittgenstein had apparently wanted to study with Boltzmann in
Vienna after school, but Boltzmann’s suicide in September 1906 resulted
in his going to Berlin instead. Like Hertz, Boltzmann developed a
‘picture theory’ of science, which may also have helped shape
Wittgenstein’s account of pictures, but it was again his more
philosophical views that arguably had the greatest influence. Boltzmann
claimed that certain philosophical questions, such as about the value of
life or the most fundamental laws of physics, were illegitimate,
reflecting the mind’s tendency to ‘overshoot’. If philosophy could thus
create a system, Boltzmann wrote, such that ‘it stood out clearly when a
question is not justified so that the drive towards asking it would
gradually die away, we should at one stroke have resolved the most
obscure riddles and philosophy would become worthy of the name of queen
of the sciences’.12 There is an echo of this in 6.5 and 6.521 of the
Tractatus, and Wittgenstein may well have drawn inspiration from
Boltzmann in developing just such a philosophical ‘system’.</p>
<p>Much has been made of Schopenhauer’s influence on Wittgenstein. He
apparently read Schopenhauer’s major work, The World as Will and
Representation (1818), at the age of 16, and was attracted to its
epistemological idealism. Schopenhauer’s philosophy has to be understood
as a response to Kant’s philosophy. According to Kant, the world as we
experience it—the phenomenal world—is formed by both the spatio-temporal
framework and the conceptual scheme that we impose on it. This is his
so-called transcendental idealism, specifying the conditions for
knowledge to be possible at all. There is sensory input that we work on,
so Kant also claimed to be an empirical realist. But he maintained, too,
that there is a noumenal world, comprising ‘things-in-themselves’, lying
behind the phenomenal world, which somehow gives rise to the sensory
content that we synthesize into knowledge. This is what the philosophers
who came after him, including Schopenhauer, criticized. To regard
things-in-themselves as ‘giving rise’ to the phenomenal world amounts to
projecting the concept of causality outside its legitimate (empirical)
domain.</p>
<p>Instead, Schopenhauer argued that the world should be conceived as
both will (Wille) and representation (Vorstellung), understood as two
aspects, the operation of the will taking over the work of Kant’s
‘noumenal causality’. Knowledge of will, as a non-rational impulse, is
gained through introspection, according to Schopenhauer. In being aware
of our body, for example, we perceive it both as a physical object and
as something we can move by willing. Schopenhauer’s account has
solipsistic implications, and both these and his general conception of
the will are clearly in the background to Wittgenstein’s remarks in the
5.6s. Schopenhauer is not named in the Tractatus, but he is mentioned
once in the surviving notebooks:</p>
<pre><code>Good and evil only enter through the subject. And the subject does not belong to the world but is a limit of the world.

One could say (following Schopenhauer): The world of representation is neither good nor bad; only the willing subject is. (NB, p. 79).13</code></pre>
<p>The second sentence of this becomes 5.632, but immediately after
these remarks in the notebooks, Wittgenstein goes on: ‘I am aware of the
complete unclarity of all these propositions.’ The issue of whether
Wittgenstein himself was an idealist of some kind in the Tractatus, and
what his attitude to solipsism was, is fiercely debated. But
Wittgenstein’s own comment here makes one cautious about any
interpretation.</p>
<h4 id="wittgensteins-key-early-ideas">3. Wittgenstein’s key early
ideas</h4>
<p>Before outlining the main structure of the Tractatus and its central
claims, let us briefly consider some of the key ideas that Wittgenstein
developed in response to Frege and Russell that were later incorporated
into the Tractatus. The selection here has been governed by the aim of
elucidating some of the most characteristic themes of the Tractatus.</p>
<p>3.1. Repudiation of Logical Constants</p>
<p>In one of his earliest letters to Russell, dated 22 June 1912,
Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>Logic is still in the melting-pot but one thing gets more and more
obvious to me: The prop[osition]s of Logic contain ONLY APPARENT
variables and whatever may turn out to be the proper explanation of
apparent variables, its consequences must be that there are NO logical
constants.</p>
<pre><code>Logic must turn out to be of a TOTALLY different kind than any other science.   (WC, p. 30; NB, p. 120)</code></pre>
<p>In his own earliest work, Russell had held that any meaningful term
must denote something, what it denotes constituting its meaning. This
included the logical connectives, ‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’, and so on. Even
when the theory of descriptions showed how some phrases could be
‘analysed away’ to avoid the assumption that they must denote something
for sentences in which they occur to have meaning, he did not take this
to apply to the logical connectives themselves.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein explains why he rejects Russell’s view at the very
beginning of the notes that he left for Russell before departing to
Norway in October 1913: ‘One reason for thinking the old notation
[i.e. Russell’s] wrong is that it is very unlikely that from every
proposition p an infinite number of other propositions not-not-p,
not-not-not-not-p, etc. should follow’ (NB, p. 93). The thinking is
straightforward: if ‘not’ denoted something, then ‘not-not-p’ would say
something different from just ‘p’; and then it would indeed seem
remarkable that we can deduce an infinite number of different
propositions from just one proposition. When this remark found its way
into 5.43 of the Tractatus, itself a comment on 5.4, where Wittgenstein
denies that there are ‘logical objects’, he diagnoses the error: ‘All
propositions of logic, however, say the same. Namely, nothing.’ Further
reasons for this denial are given in other remarks in the 5.4s.</p>
<p>If the logical connectives do not denote anything, then what are
they? Wittgenstein’s answer is that they are operations, an idea that
first emerges in his notebooks on 13 December 1914 and is made explicit
on 23 January 1915: ‘Negation is an operation… . An operation, of
course, does not state anything, only its result; and this depends on
its object’ (NB, p. 39). Wittgenstein’s account of operations is given
in the 5.2s. One crucial idea is that an operation can ‘vanish’, as he
puts it (5.254); that is, it can cancel itself out, explaining why
‘not-not-p’ is equivalent to just ‘p’.</p>
<p>3.2. Propositional Unity and The Theory of Types</p>
<p>At the time that Wittgenstein was working with Russell in Cambridge,
Russell conceived a proposition as some kind of complex entity composed
of simpler entities. But this raised the question of the unity of such a
proposition. If the only constituents of a proposition are objects, then
how do they combine to generate a meaningful proposition? As
Wittgenstein was to put it, what makes ‘Socrates is mortal’ meaningful
but ‘mortality is Socrates’ meaningless? Frege’s answer was clear:
concepts are ‘unsaturated’, reflected in the fact that the concept-word,
represented here by ‘( ) is mortal’, contains a ‘gap’ indicating where
the proper name goes to complete the sentence.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein recognized what is in effect Frege’s solution to the
problem of the unity of the proposition. Reporting on a meeting he had
had with Frege in December 1912, he wrote to Russell: ‘I had a long
discussion with Frege about our Theory of Symbolism of which, I think,
he roughly understood the general outline … The complex-problem is now
clearer to me and I hope very much that I may solve it’ (WC, p. 36; NB,
p. 121). On 16 January 1913, he then elaborates:</p>
<p>I have changed my views on “atomic” complexes: I now think that
Qualities, Relations (like Love) etc. are all copulae! That means I for
instance analyse a subject-predicate prop[osition], say, “Socrates is
human” into “Socrates” and “Something is human”, (which I think is not
complex). The reason for this, is a very fundamental one: I think that
there cannot be different Types of things! In other words whatever can
be symbolized by a simple proper name must belong to one type. And
further: every theory of types must be rendered superfluous by a proper
theory of symbolism: For instance if I analyse the prop[osition]
Socrates is mortal into Socrates, Mortality and (∃x,y) εI (x,y) I want a
theory of types to tell me that “Mortality is Socrates” is nonsensical,
because if I treat “Mortality” as a proper name (as I did) there is
nothing to prevent me to make the substitution the wrong way round. But
if I analyse [it] (as I do now) into Socrates and (∃x)x is mortal or
generally into x and (∃x)ϕ(x) it becomes impossible to substitute the
wrong way round, because the two symbols are now of a different kind
themselves. What I am most certain of is not however the correctness of
my present way of analysis, but of the fact that all theory of types
must be done away with by a theory of symbolism showing that what seem
to be different kinds of things are symbolized by different kinds of
symbols which cannot possibly be substituted in one another’s places. I
hope I have made this fairly clear! (WC, p. 38; NB, pp. 121–2)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s ‘analysis’ here differs from Frege’s, and he did
indeed come to reject this analysis as well as Frege’s; in the
Tractatus, he writes that elementary propositions ‘consist of names in
immediate combination’ (4.221). But the essential idea that there are
different ‘kinds’ of things that can only be shown by a correct
symbolism remained. The distinction between saying and showing is not
formulated explicitly until April 1914 (see §2.1 above, and below), but
it is clearly implicit in this letter. It provides a good example of a
line of thinking found in Frege’s philosophy, which Wittgenstein then
used in clarifying a problem in Russell’s work—and in this case, too, as
we have seen, in Frege’s own attempts to explain his concept/object
distinction.14</p>
<p>3.3. Showing and The Ideal Notation</p>
<p>As mentioned in §2.1 above, the distinction between saying and
showing first appears in the notes Wittgenstein dictated to Moore in
April 1914. Here is the opening remark again together with the remark
that follows:</p>
<p>Logical so-called propositions show [the] logical properties of
language and therefore of [the] Universe, but say nothing.</p>
<pre><code>This means that by merely looking at them you can see these properties; whereas, in a proposition proper, you cannot see what is true by looking at it. (NB, p. 108)</code></pre>
<p>What logical propositions show are the inferential relations between
ordinary propositions, rooted in their own logical structure. He goes on
to describe logical propositions as tautologies: while true, they say
nothing. One might object, however, to the suggestion that we can see
that they are true merely by looking at them; but here is where
Wittgenstein’s concern with an ideal notation comes in. The diagrams
that appear in 6.1203 of the Tractatus are attempts he made to show the
logical properties of propositions with what he called his ab-notation
(cf. NB, p. 115). More successful, though, is his use of truth-tables to
display the truth-conditions of propositions, as explained in 4.31 and
4.4s (and cf. 5.101). This is now an established method in propositional
logic of seeing whether a proposition is a tautology. If the final
column in a truth-table representing a proposition displays only Ts,
then the proposition is a tautology (and if only Fs, then a
contradiction).</p>
<p>It is important at this point to correct a major error of
interpretation that Russell made in his introduction to Wittgenstein’s
Tractatus. In explaining how to understand the book, he writes:</p>
<p>Mr Wittgenstein is concerned with the conditions for a logically
perfect language—not that any language is logically perfect, or that we
believe ourselves capable, here and now, of constructing a logically
perfect language, but that the whole function of language is to have
meaning, and it only fulfils this function in proportion as it
approaches to the ideal language which we postulate.15</p>
<p>This misconstrues Wittgenstein’s project, and it is not surprising
that Wittgenstein was unhappy with Russell’s introduction. Wittgenstein
was not concerned with an ideal language, but with an ideal notation, a
notation that made as clear as possible the logical structure that our
ordinary language already has, as a condition of being useable—of making
sense—at all. In 5.5563 he writes: ‘All propositions of our everyday
language are in fact, just as they are, in perfect logical order.—That
most simple idea that we have to get across here is not a likeness of
the truth but the whole truth itself.’ Language may disguise thought
(4.002), but that is why we need a ‘critique of language’ to uncover the
real logical form of propositions (4.0031). Wittgenstein’s main concern
was to show how language is already logically perfect, which he thought
we would see once we properly understand the nature of the
proposition.</p>
<p>3.4. The Senselessness of Logical Propositions</p>
<p>After characterizing logical propositions in his notes of April 1914
as tautologies, Wittgenstein goes on to describe them as ‘forms of
proof: they show that one or more propositions follow from one (or
more)’ (NB, p. 109). Since this remark is incorporated into 6.1264 and
holds the key to his claim that logical propositions are senseless, let
us consider a simple example of a logical inference to explain this, a
logical inference of the following form:</p>
<p>‘Q’ follows logically from ‘P’ and ‘P ⊃ Q’ (‘If P, then Q’), by a
rule of inference called modus ponens, one of the most basic rules of
logical inference.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine someone objecting that since the inference depends
on this rule, it should be made explicit in the reasoning. How might we
formulate this rule? The obvious suggestion would be to write ‘(P
andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’ (‘If P and (if P, then Q), then Q’). So let
us add this as the supposed missing premise:</p>
<p>If we do this, however, then an infinite regress threatens. Should we
not add as a further premise ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q ) andandandand ((P
andandandand (P ⊃ Q )) ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’, and so on? How can we ever draw a
valid inference?16</p>
<p>Clearly, something has gone wrong. ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’
cannot be seen as a missing premise: the inference in its original
formulation is perfectly valid as it is. The rule of modus ponens
governs the inference but is not part of it. For every rule of inference
there is some corresponding logical proposition, but such logical
propositions have a quite different status to the premises of an
inference. (If an argument is compared to a house built of bricks, then
rules of inference are like the mortar that holds the bricks together
and not the bricks themselves.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein makes this point by saying that logical propositions
lack sense, in other words, are senseless. Unlike ‘P’, ‘P ⊃ Q’ and ‘Q’,
all of which may have sense, ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’ is
senseless, since it adds nothing to the inference. It is a form of
proof, as Wittgenstein puts it, showing that ‘Q’ follows from ‘P’ and ‘P
⊃ Q’. But in showing such inferential relations, logical propositions
are not nonsense. The distinction between senselessness and nonsense was
only explicitly drawn in the first draft of the Tractatus (see below),
but it is just another way of characterizing the unique nature of
logical propositions.</p>
<p>3.5. Simple Objects</p>
<p>In the 2.02s of the Tractatus Wittgenstein notoriously claims that
there must be simple objects if the world is to have substance and
empirical propositions are to have sense. This is an issue that occupied
Wittgenstein throughout his early thinking. If a proposition is to have
an analysis at all, it would seem, then it must bottom out into basic
(elementary) propositions, whose constituent names must denote something
if they and the complex propositions they form are to have a meaning. A
number of different lines of thought converge on the claim that there
must be simple objects, and we will focus here on just one, which is
easy to motivate from Russell’s theory of descriptions.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a basic proposition, which has the simplest form we
can imagine, stating that an object a has the property F. The
proposition ‘a is F’ is true if a does indeed have the property F, and
is false if it does not. But what if ‘a’ does not, in fact, denote
anything in the world (like ‘the present King of France’)? Then either
‘a is F’ is meaningless or else we have to treat ‘a’ as a disguised
definite description and analyse it in accordance with Russell’s theory
of descriptions, which would mean that it is not, after all, a basic
proposition: it would be a conjunction of three simpler propositions. So
if basic propositions are possible at all, propositions that cannot be
further analysed, then their constituent names must denote: there must
be simple objects to be the meanings of these names. Wittgenstein never
gave examples of simple objects, but he thought that there must be such
objects as the necessary condition for the propositions of our language
to have sense. Other lines of thought leading to this claim are given in
the 3.2s, quite a few of which have sources in his notebooks.</p>
<p>3.6. The Bipolarity of Propositions</p>
<p>Another idea that Wittgenstein had very early on, explained in his
notes of 1913, concerns what he called the bipolarity of propositions:
to understand a proposition we must know both what is the case if it is
true and what is the case if it is false (NB, pp. 94, 98). This was
important in his attempt to get clear about ‘the mystery of negation’,
as he put it: ‘This is not how things are, and yet we can say how things
are not’ (NB, p. 30). Russell had held that there had to be both
‘positive’ and ‘negative’ facts, to act as the meanings of propositions
and their negations, respectively. But this leaves unexplained the
connection that there must nevertheless be between the corresponding
positive and negative fact. In his notes of 1913, Wittgenstein suggests
a better account: p and not-p have the same meaning (explaining the
connection) but opposite sense (NB, pp. 95, 103).</p>
<p>By the time we get to the Tractatus, this claim has been modified:
‘The propositions “p” and “~p” have opposite sense, but one and the same
reality corresponds to them’ (4.0621). Wittgenstein no longer talks of
propositions having meaning; it is only names that have meaning. But
propositions (unlike names) do have sense, which he characterizes as the
state of affairs represented. If that state of affairs obtains, then the
proposition is true; if it does not obtain, then the proposition is
false. Here what is important is that we can understand a proposition,
i.e. grasp its sense, without knowing its truth-value: it is ‘reality’
that determines whether it is true or false (4.02 ff.).</p>
<p>This account also helps explain how the logical connectives ‘enter
into’ propositions without being actual constituents. For if
understanding a proposition requires knowing what is the case if it is
false as well as what is the case if it is true, then understanding it
involves grasp of negation. Given the interdefinability of the logical
connectives, knowledge of all of them—and of logic, generally—is
implicitly presupposed in understanding even the most basic
propositions.</p>
<p>3.7. Propositions as Facts</p>
<p>According to Russell, propositions signify facts, but propositions
themselves he regarded as complexes (of objects or terms). But how can
complexes signify facts, which seem to be a different category—or
‘type’—of thing? Wittgenstein’s answer is that propositions, too, are
facts. In his notes of 1913, he writes: ‘In “aRb” it is not the complex
that symbolises but the fact that the symbol “a” stands in a certain
relation to the symbol “b.” Thus facts are symbolised by facts, or more
correctly: that a certain thing is the case in the symbol says that a
certain thing is the case in the world’ (NB, p. 96; cf. pp. 98, 106).
This is repeated in his notes of 1914 (pp. 111, 116), and later in
3.1432 of the Tractatus: ‘Not: “The complex sign ‘aRb’ says that a
stands in the relation R to b”; but: That ‘a’ stands in a certain
relation to ‘b’ says that aRb.’ Here it is embedded in a broader
discussion of propositions as facts, which we can thus see as
elaborating on his criticism of Russell’s view.</p>
<p>3.8. Propositions as Pictures</p>
<p>On 29 September 1914 Wittgenstein wrote in his notebook:</p>
<p>The general concept of a proposition carries with it a quite general
concept of the co-ordination of proposition and state-of-things
[Sachverhalt]: The solution to all my questions must be extremely
simple.</p>
<pre><code>In a proposition a world is put together experimentally. (As when in a Parisian law-court a car accident is represented by dolls, etc.) (NB, p. 7)</code></pre>
<p>Wittgenstein had apparently read about the Parisian law case in a
magazine report and it was the trigger for him to think of propositions
themselves as models or pictures of the world. We can see his thinking
this through in the remarks that follow:</p>
<p>Instead of saying that this proposition has such and such a sense,
one can say that this proposition represents such and such a
state-of-things!</p>
<pre><code>It depicts it logically.

Only thus can the proposition be true or false: only by being a picture of a state-of-things can it agree or not agree with reality… .

The proposition only states something insofar as it is a picture!   (NB, p. 8)</code></pre>
<p>In the first three sentences Wittgenstein is already connecting the
idea of propositions as pictures to his existing conception of a
proposition as having sense (representing a state-of-things) and meaning
(depicting reality), and agreeing or not agreeing with reality (just as
a picture can). The fourth expresses the insight he has now had.</p>
<p>It was not all plain sailing, however. He continues to develop what
is essentially an analogy, with all the ups and downs that would
inevitably be expected. In mid-April 1915, for example, he writes:</p>
<p>I cannot get from the essence of a proposition to the individual
logical operations!!!</p>
<pre><code>I just cannot bring out how far a proposition is a picture of a state-of-things!

I am almost ready to give up all efforts.   (NB, p. 41)</code></pre>
<p>On 9 May he has the hint of an answer: ‘A proposition is a picture of
a fact. I can devise different pictures of a fact. (The logical
operations serve to do this.)’ (NB, p. 46). Four days later he writes:
‘Just don’t pull the knot tight before being sure of having got hold of
the right end’ (NB, p. 47). Whatever the exact development of his
thinking in this period, though, it does seem that he was gradually
getting closer to the point when he could finally start pulling the knot
tight in bringing together all his ideas.</p>
<h4 id="the-main-structure-of-the-tractatus">4. The main structure of
the Tractatus</h4>
<p>Sometime in the summer of 1915 Wittgenstein began writing a new
notebook (MS 104) which marked a watershed in the evolution of the
Tractatus. Entitling it ‘Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung’
(‘Logical-philosophical Treatise’), he here formulated, right at the
beginning, what were to become the first six main propositions of the
Tractatus, together with 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4
(with slight modifications to some of them). A space was left in the
sixth for the intended formula, which was added later.17 The seventh and
final proposition also came later, added on page 71. Wittgenstein’s
thoughts had clearly reached a point when he needed to take stock and
find a way to organize and develop them into a coherent whole. The
propositions he wrote down and the numbering system he invented provided
a brilliant way to do so. The main propositions formed the core of his
treatise and the decimal notation allowed him to develop it by adding
further remarks in a tree structure, some culled from his other
notebooks, revised as appropriate, and some new.</p>
<p>One can thus see how he insisted, in a letter written to the
publisher Ludwig von Ficker in December 1919 when he was trying to get
the Tractatus published (see Note on the Text, §2), that ‘the decimal
numbers of my remarks absolutely must be printed alongside them, because
they alone make the book perspicuous and clear: without the numbering it
would be an incomprehensible jumble’.18 Now that the key influences on
his thinking have been outlined and a sketch offered of some of his key
early ideas, we can see how his ideas were crystallized and elaborated
in the Tractatus itself, at least as far as its main structure is
concerned.</p>
<p>Let us first consider the main propositions, before looking in turn
at the corresponding propositions at the next level down, those of the
form n.m. Here are the seven main propositions:</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
<p>There is a clear line of thought here. Beginning with the claim that
the world is everything that is the case, we get clarification of what
it is for something to be the case—that is, to be a fact
(Tatsache)—namely, for states-of-things (Sachverhalten) to obtain.19
Next comes a statement about the relationship between facts and
thoughts: a thought is a logical picture of facts; and a thought is in
turn characterized as a senseful proposition. This leads to
clarification of what a proposition is: a truth-function of elementary
propositions; and we are then told what the general form of a
truth-function is, which is in turn characterized as the general
propositional form. That is where the statement of the main propositions
on the opening page of the notebook (MS 104) ends, but already we see
many of the key ideas of the Tractatus reflected here: the conceptions
of a fact, a state-of-things, a (logical) picture, a thought, a
(senseful) proposition, an elementary proposition, a truth-function, and
the general propositional form. Proposition 7 draws a conclusion: that
instead of trying to say something that does not instantiate the general
propositional form (and fulfil the conditions of being a proposition),
we should keep silent. We can see this as indicating the second part of
his treatise that Wittgenstein had described to Ficker: the part that he
had not written (see Note on the Text, §2).</p>
<p>4.1. The Main Structure of the 1s</p>
<p>The first section of the Tractatus, containing the opening
proposition and the 1s that follow, is the shortest in the book. There
are just two propositions of the form 1.m (with 1.2 added later):</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>
<p>1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.</p>
<p>1.2 The world divides into facts.</p>
<p>These elaborate on the opening claim that the world is everything
that is the case: the world is made up of facts, not things. This
introduces the notion of a fact (Tatsache), which is fundamental to the
conception of a picture that is explained in the 2s.</p>
<p>4.2. The Main Structure of the 2s</p>
<p>The second section of the Tractatus, comprising the 2s, is much
longer than the first section (though still shorter than the remaining
sections), but there are also only two propositions of the form n.m:</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things. 2.1
We picture facts.</p>
<p>2.2 A picture has the logical form of depiction in common with what
is depicted.</p>
<p>These introduce the idea of a picture and state the basic connection
between a picture and a fact, bringing in the key idea of a common
logical form in depiction.</p>
<p>These ideas are elaborated in the propositions that comment on 2.1
and 2.2, providing a full account of his conception of a picture. What
is missing in 2.1 and 2.2, though, is clarification of the notion of a
state-of-things. This is done in a new kind of subdivision, adding
propositions of the form 2.0m. These are not, however, remarks on
anything numbered 2.0, but are also direct comments on 2. Having
formulated 2.1 and 2.2, Wittgenstein presumably realized that there
needed to be a further level of immediate clarification of 2, so he
inserted propositions between 2 and 2.1. Here are the propositions of
the form 2.0m:</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.
2.01 A state-of-things is a combination of objects (entities,
things).</p>
<p>2.02 An object is simple.</p>
<p>2.03 In a state-of-things the objects hang in one another, like the
links of a chain.</p>
<p>2.04 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things is the world.</p>
<p>2.05 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things also determines
which states-of-things do not obtain.</p>
<p>2.06 The obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things is
reality.</p>
<p>These summarize Wittgenstein’s conception of a state-of-things, with
further elucidation and argument provided in the lower-level
propositions (2.011, etc.). With this done, he could then rely on it
elaborating his account of pictures in the 2.1s and 2.2s, as in
describing them as presenting the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things (2.11, 2.201).</p>
<p>4.3. The Main Structure of the 3s</p>
<p>The third section of the Tractatus, comprising the 3s, is longer than
the first two sections combined (though shorter than each of the
remaining sections), and contains five propositions of the form 3.m
(with 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 added later):</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought. 3.1 In a proposition a
thought is expressed perceptibly.</p>
<p>3.2 In a proposition a thought can be so expressed that to the
objects of the thought correspond elements of the propositional
sign.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a
proposition does a name have meaning.</p>
<p>3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence
of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituents
themselves, by the existence of the senseful proposition.</p>
<p>3.5 A propositional sign as applied in thinking is a thought.</p>
<p>We have here an initial clarification of Wittgenstein’s conception of
a proposition as expressing a thought. 3.1 and the remarks that follow
(of the form 3.1m.) provide an excellent illustration of his method in
crafting the Tractatus. 3.1 had originally read: ‘The perceptible
expression of a thought is a propositional sign.’ Its final form is
sharper, focusing on the key concept of a proposition, with the 3.1s
elaborating on it. Two are especially significant. In 3.12 we are told
that ‘a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective relation
to the world’ (italics added). This makes clear that ‘Satz’, at least in
the 3s (and in most other places), should not be translated as
‘sentence’. What would correspond to ‘sentence’ is ‘propositional sign’
(‘Satzzeichen’). A proposition, on Wittgenstein’s view, expresses a
thought through a propositional sign. Arguably, though, even
‘Satzzeichen’, as Wittgenstein understands it, does not merely mean
‘sentence’. In 3.14 we read: ‘A propositional sign consists in this,
that its elements, the words, stand to one another in it in a
determinate way. A propositional sign is a fact.’ This crystallizes one
of Wittgenstein’s earliest insights, found in his notes of 1913 (as we
saw in §3.7 above) and reiterated in 3.1432: ‘Not: “The complex sign
‘aRb’ says that a stands in the relation R to b”; but: That ‘a’ stands
in a certain relation to ‘b’ says that aRb.’ In isolation (as it is in
the notes from which it is drawn), this is very cryptic, but we now see
that it is an illustration of his conception of propositions as facts.
Only facts can represent facts. The obtaining of states-of-things in the
world is represented by the obtaining of relations between the elements
of a propositional sign as they are projected in thought.</p>
<p>What has just been said is further elaborated in the 3.2s; and 3.3
states what is now known as the context principle, first formulated by
Frege in The Foundations of Arithmetic in arguing that the meaning of
number terms can only be given by defining the sense of a proposition in
which number terms occur.20 Wittgenstein generalizes the principle,
taking it to hold of all names, and puts it to different work, not least
in diagnosing what goes wrong in Russell’s paradox (briefly stated in
the 3.33s). 3.5, concluding the 3s, leads neatly into the 4s.</p>
<p>As in the 2s, we also have propositions of the form n.0m, elucidating
his conception of thinking, such as in claiming that we cannot think
anything illogical (3.03, defended in the lower-level propositions that
follow), as well as a single proposition of the form n.00m, connecting
the idea of a state-of-things in the 2s with 3: ‘“A state-of-things is
thinkable” means: we can picture it’ (3.001).</p>
<p>4.4. The Main Structure of the 4s</p>
<p>The fourth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 4s, is the second
longest section, but with section 3, it forms the philosophical heart of
the work. Significantly, in this respect, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 were
all transferred unchanged into the final version of the Tractatus. Only
4.5 was subsequently added. Here they are (with 4.5 drastically
shortened):</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition. 4.1 A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with
the possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement
with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.</p>
<p>4.5 It now appears possible to specify the most general propositional
form … The general form of a proposition is: such and such is the
case.</p>
<p>Section 2 had explained the conception of a fact as the obtaining of
states-of-things, which can be pictured in thought. Section 3 had
elaborated the idea of picturing in elucidating the conception of a
proposition as a propositional sign—understood as itself a fact—in its
projective relation to the world. Except for the 2.02s (in a different
context), however, there is no mention of propositions in section 2, and
there is no mention at all of states-of-things in section 3. The
connection between them is only made in 4.1: ‘A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.’ This is
undoubtedly one of the key and most distinctive claims of the Tractatus.
The claim is anticipated in 2.11: ‘A picture presents a state of affairs
in logical space, the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.’
But it is only once the conceptions of both a picture and a proposition
have been clarified, enabling propositions to be seen as a kind of
picture, that ‘picture’ in 2.11 can be replaced by ‘proposition’.</p>
<p>4.2 brings in the conception of the sense of a proposition,
characterized here as its agreement and disagreement with the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things,
and 4.3 introduces two new notions, of truth-possibilities and of
elementary propositions, although the latter had been defined (appearing
for the first time) in 4.21 (so immediately after 4.2): ‘The simplest
proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the obtaining of a
state-of-things.’ This makes the crucial connection between elementary
propositions and states-of-things (which can indeed now be seen as
‘atomic’ states of affairs), and leads Wittgenstein to formulate 4.4 as
following from (and summarizing) 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.</p>
<p>In a parenthetical remark in his notebooks dated 3 June 1915,
Wittgenstein wrote: ‘The liberating Word [das erlösende Wort], by the
way, has not yet been spoken here’ (NB, p. 54; cf. pp. 39, 40).
Wittgenstein was concerned throughout his life to find the ‘liberating’
word, which he later characterized as ‘the word that finally permits us
to grasp what until then had constantly and intangibly weighed on our
consciousness’ (BT, p. 302e). The remark in his notebooks was written
just before he came up with his plan for the Tractatus. In starting his
new notebook (MS 104) with a formulation of propositions 1, 1.1, 2, 2.1,
2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5, and 6, he seems to have
found a constellation of liberating words, a liberating core, around
which he could construct his treatise.</p>
<p>4.5 was only formed later, out of several remarks originally numbered
as 4.4301, 4.43011, 4.43012, and 4.4303 (as they can be found in the
Prototractatus, as later reconstructed by scholars from MS 104). It is
one of only two propositions of the form n.m that are amongst the
longest in the Tractatus, but draws an important conclusion from the
core remarks we have just considered. It also connects back to the very
first proposition: ‘The world is everything that is the case.’ Language
is now seen as saying what is the case (whether truly or falsely).
Wittgenstein insisted that the last sentence in 4.5, ‘Es verhält sich so
und so’, be translated ‘Such and such is the case’, not ‘Things are
combined in such and such a way’, as Ramsey had first rendered it,
commenting that ‘The expression must be one used in every day language
to express that something or other is the case’ (LO, p. 30; see the
explanatory note to 4.5).</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein says in the second paragraph of 4.5, the most general
propositional form must indeed be maximally general, to include all
genuine propositions. But if all propositions represent the obtaining
and non-obtaining of states-of-things, asserted by elementary
propositions, whose truth-possibilities thus determine the
truth-possibilities of every proposition, then all propositions do
indeed make some claim about how the world is, that such and such is the
case. The 4s have provided the philosophical rationale for this, and the
5s will provide a more technical logical account.</p>
<p>As in section 3, we also have propositions both of the form n.0m and
of the form n.00m. The 4.00s talk about language in general, ending in
the claim that all philosophy is ‘critique of language’, and
complimenting Russell for having shown that the apparent logical form of
a proposition need not be its real one (4.0031; see §2.2 above). The
4.0s make further remarks about a proposition being a picture or model
of reality (4.01), which explains how we can understand a proposition
without having its sense explained to us (4.02), how a proposition can
convey a new sense to us with old expressions (4.03), and how it can be
true or false (4.06), among other things.</p>
<p>4.5. The Main Structure of the 5s</p>
<p>The fifth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 5s, is the
longest, supplying the technical apparatus to make more precise
Wittgenstein’s claim about the general proposition form and clarifying
his conception of a logical operation. Only 5 had appeared in his
initial formulation of the main propositions of the Tractatus, and here
there is the most change from the version of this section that emerged
from his original manuscript (MS 104, reconstructed to form the
Prototractatus) to the final version. Here is the final version (with
only the first sentence of 5.3 given):</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) 5.1 The
truth-functions can be ordered in series. This is the foundation of
probability theory.</p>
<p>5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one
another.</p>
<p>5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions… .</p>
<p>5.4 This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical
constants’ (in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</p>
<p>5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of
the operation (– – – – – T)(ξ, … .) to elementary propositions. This
operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets
and I call it the negation of these propositions.</p>
<p>5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>
<p>5 is the key claim of section 5, and indeed, one of the key claims of
the whole book. Except for a solitary mention in 3.3441, 5 marks the
first appearance of the notion of a truth-function, and this is
explained in 5.1, drawing out some of its implications, such as for
probability theory. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary
propositions if its truth-value (truth or falsity) is determined by the
truth-values of the elementary propositions. To take one of the simplest
examples, the truth-value of the conjunction ‘p andandandand q’ (‘p.q’
in the Russellian notation that Wittgenstein uses) is determined by the
truth-values of ‘p’ and ‘q’: it is true if both ‘p’ and ‘q’ are true and
false in the other three cases (5.101). We can also say that p (as well
as q) follows from p andandandand q (5.12 ff.).</p>
<p>To say that a proposition is a truth-function of other propositions
is to say that they stand in internal relations to one another, which
can be brought out by seeing the proposition as generated from the other
propositions by a logical operation, as explained in the 5.2s. In 5.25
Wittgenstein remarks that operation and function must not be confused,
which is itself confusing given his talk of truth-functions. But what he
means here is a propositional function, which cannot be its own argument
(as he stressed in 3.333 in his diagnosis of Russell’s paradox), while
the result of an operation can become its own base (5.251). So
truth-functions are functions in a broader sense. Truth-functions of
propositions are results of what he calls truth-operations on other
propositions, the bases of the operations (5.234). This is summarized in
the full version of 5.3, the second of the two propositions of the form
n.m that are amongst the longest in the book.</p>
<p>5.4 draws a conclusion that reinforces the ‘fundamental thought’ he
had expressed in 4.0312, that the ‘logical constants’ do not represent,
that is, are not ‘logical objects’. He offers a number of arguments in
what follows. One relies on the interdefinability of the various logical
connectives (5.42), which conflicts with the idea that any primitive
ideas must be independent of one another (5.451). As he claims at
several points in the Tractatus, there are no ‘pre-eminent numbers’ in
logic (5.453; cf. 4.128, 5.553). Frege and Russell had taken two logical
connectives as primitive in their (propositional) logic: negation and
the conditional in Frege’s Begriffsschrift, negation and conjunction in
the system of Principia Mathematica. But this is arbitrary. In fact, as
Henry Sheffer had shown in 1913, we can actually make do with just one
logical connective, symbolized as ‘|’, understood as ‘neither … nor’.21
‘p|q’ is true if neither ‘p’ nor ‘q’ is true and false in all other
cases. All the other logical connectives can be defined in terms of
Sheffer’s stroke ‘|’. ‘~p’ (negation) can be defined as ‘p|p’ (neither p
nor p), for example, and ‘p andandandand q’ (conjunction) as
‘<sub>p|</sub>q’ (neither not p nor not q) and hence ‘(p|p)|(q|q)’. But
there is nothing uniquely ‘primitive’ about Sheffer’s stroke.</p>
<p>What he says here, however, might seem to conflict with what he goes
on to say in 5.5 in introducing his N-operator, symbolized as ‘()’. This
generalizes Sheffer’s stroke, extending its use to the infinite
case—where there may be an infinite number of elementary propositions
(which cannot be ruled out by logic, according to Wittgenstein). If
every proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions, and we
can make do with a single logical operator, then every proposition can
be generated by successive applications of the N-operator to elementary
propositions. But Wittgenstein’s position is not that this is therefore
the one primitive logical constant, but that it merely reflects the
ideal logical notation for understanding the general propositional form.
This is clarified in the 5.5s, when he tries to show (controversially)
how general propositions (5.52 ff.), (apparent) identity statements
(5.53 ff.), and propositions such as ‘A believes that p’ (5.54 ff.) can
be handled in his logical notation.</p>
<p>5.6 returns us to the question of the limits of language, broached in
the preface to the Tractatus, cryptically anticipated in the 4.11s, and
cryptically answered in 4.51: ‘Suppose that I am given all elementary
propositions; then the question arises as to what propositions I can
form from them. And the answer is all propositions and this is how they
are limited.’ The limits of language and hence of the world are drawn
from within language. Those limits are shown by the general
propositional form, by all propositions being truth-functions of the
elementary propositions.</p>
<p>In the original version of the 5s, there were many propositions of
the forms n.00m and n.0m, but all were renumbered and reordered, with
the exception of the two that become 5.01 and 5.02.</p>
<p>4.6. The Main Structure of the 6s</p>
<p>The sixth section of the Tractatus, comprising the 6s, is the third
longest, and after capturing the general form of a proposition in a
single formula, Wittgenstein considers various kinds of propositions
that do not fit the formula and offers an account of how they should be
regarded.</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition. 6.1 The propositions of logic are
tautologies.</p>
<p>6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics
are equations, that is, pseudo-propositions.</p>
<p>6.3 The investigation of logic means the investigation of all
regularity. And outside logic all is accident.</p>
<p>6.4 All propositions are of equal value.</p>
<p>6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be
stated. There is no such thing as the riddle. If a question can be posed
at all, then it can also be answered.</p>
<p>The sixth section of the Tractatus gave Wittgenstein the most trouble
and underwent the most changes during its composition. As noted above,
the formula in proposition 6 was only filled in later. Initially, it
seems, Wittgenstein had been thinking that what eventually became 6.1
would be the main proposition 6. Section 6 was originally conceived as
entirely about logic, ending on what is now 6.13 (the last proposition
of the 6.1s, combining 6.13 and 6.131 of the Prototractatus): ‘Logic is
not a set of teachings [Lehre] but a mirror image of the world. Logic is
transcendental.’ The conclusion to the whole book was thus to be the
claim that logic is transcendental. (On the idea of the transcendental,
see the discussion of Schopenhauer in §2.3 above.22)</p>
<p>In July 1916 Wittgenstein began to think more about ethics, prompted
by especially harrowing experiences on the warfront. This led to the
decision to add a further subsection consisting of the following remarks
numbered 6.2: ‘Ethics does not consist of propositions. All propositions
are of equal value.’ These were to become 6.42 and 6.4 of the Tractatus,
respectively, with 6.42 derived from 6.4 via 6.41, which suggests that
‘Ethics does not consist of propositions’ was seen as the conclusion to
subsection 6.2 corresponding to the conclusion that ‘Logic is
transcendental’ at the end of the 6.1s. In due course Wittgenstein also
remarks that ‘Ethics is transcendental’, which becomes part of 6.421,
making clear that a comparison is being drawn between ethics and
logic.</p>
<p>At the same time we have the first appearance of proposition 7: ‘Of
what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.’ We can see this
anticipated in remarks Wittgenstein makes in the notebook he began in
April 1916 (so not MS 104). In the entry dated 30 July, after discussing
the question ‘why should I live happily?’, which revealingly he
describes as a ‘tautological question’, he goes on: ‘All this is really
in some sense deeply mysterious! It is clear that ethics cannot be
stated [sich nicht aussprechen läßt]’ (NB, p. 78). This second remark
also ends up as part of 6.421, and it is but a step from this to
proposition 7. What all this suggests is that it was his thinking that
both ethics and logic are transcendental that led him to formulate what
became the overall conclusion to the Tractatus. Proposition 7 was not
intended, at least originally, to be a conclusion to anything that is in
the 6.5s, as that final subsection had not yet been conceived. (That is
not to say that, once the 6.5s had been incorporated, proposition 7
could not function as a conclusion to them as well.)</p>
<p>Throughout this period, Wittgenstein was also continuing to think
about the general propositional form, which he later admitted in the
Philosophical Investigations was the part of his earlier work that had
given him the most headache (PI, §65). In a remark written on 9 July
1916 he makes clear why he thinks that there must be such a form: ‘If
the most general propositional form could not be given, then a moment
would have to come when we suddenly had a new experience, a logical one,
so to speak’ (NB, 75). The problem is still exercising him in November
1916. ‘That it is possible to establish the general propositional form
is just to say: every possible form of proposition must be foreseeable’
(NB, p. 89). His thought is very simple: if we have learnt (our)
language, then we will understand any possible proposition we may come
across in the future, so it must have a general form that enables us to
do this. He then goes on to identify the concept ‘and so on’ as the key
to establishing this form, a concept he takes as equivalent to the
concept of an operation: ‘The concept of an operation is quite generally
that according to which signs can be constructed according to a rule’
(NB, p. 90). There is no further clue in the notebook in which this is
written as to what exactly the formula is, and the notebook ends soon
after (the last entry is dated 10 January 1917, though with no entries
made between 2 December and 7 January). But we can see Wittgenstein
getting closer to the formula that was eventually added to MS 104, which
cannot have happened before December 1916.</p>
<p>Even when Wittgenstein did come up with the formula that found its
way into the Tractatus, however, the explanation he gives in 6.001 and
6.002 is inadequate, as Russell recognized when he read it. On this,
Russell gives the following helpful account in his introduction to the
Tractatus, diplomatically rectifying the explanation:</p>
<p>Mr Wittgenstein’s explanation of his symbolism at this point is not
quite fully given in the text. The symbol he uses is</p>
<p>The following is the explanation of this symbol:</p>
<pre><code> stands for all atomic propositions.

 stands for any set of propositions.

 stands for the negation of all the propositions making up .

The whole symbol [] means whatever can be obtained by taking any selection of atomic propositions, negating them all, then taking any selection of the set of propositions now obtained, together with any of the originals—and so on indefinitely. This is, he says, the general truth-function and also the general form of proposition. What is meant is somewhat less complicated than it sounds. The symbol is intended to describe a process by the help of which, given the atomic propositions, all others can be manufactured. The process depends upon:

(a) Sheffer’s proof that all truth-functions can be obtained out of simultaneous negation, i.e. out of ‘not-p and not-q’;

(b) Mr Wittgenstein’s theory of the derivation of general propositions from conjunctions and disjunctions;

(c) The assertion that a proposition can only occur in another proposition as argument to a truth-function.</code></pre>
<p>Given these three foundations, it follows that all propositions which
are not atomic can be derived from such as are, by a uniform process,
and it is this process which is indicated by Mr Wittgenstein’s
symbol.</p>
<p>Establishing the general form of a proposition was one of the major
goals of the Tractatus, but once it had been achieved, it brought about
further changes to the structure of the work. The subsection on ethics
was moved to begin at 6.4, to make room for two new subsections, one on
mathematics beginning with 6.2 and one on scientific laws beginning with
6.3. A final subsection on philosophy was then also added beginning with
6.5. The motivation for these is clear. With the general form of a
proposition now established, with all propositions seen as resulting
from the successive application of the N-operator to elementary
propositions, questions naturally arise about the status of (apparent)
propositions that cannot be so generated. These include logical
propositions, mathematical propositions, scientific laws, ethical
propositions, and philosophical propositions. Wittgenstein devotes a
subsection to each of them before concluding with 7.</p>
<p>All these propositions lack sense, according to Wittgenstein, since
to have sense just is to have the general form of a proposition. But it
would be too quick to dismiss all of them as nonsensical. Logical
propositions are characterized as senseless, not nonsensical, since they
are tautologies, which say nothing but show the logical properties of
language and the world. Mathematical propositions also have a status
somewhere between senseful and nonsensical propositions. But he
characterizes them not as tautologies but as equations, though they also
show the logic of the world (6.21), and not explicitly as nonsensical
but as pseudo-propositions, since they express no thoughts (6.2). He
presumably stops short of calling them nonsensical because they help us
draw inferences outside mathematics (6.211). Wittgenstein is not a
logicist (taking mathematical propositions to be logical propositions),
but he does describe mathematics as a logical method. Scientific laws
and principles also have an intermediate status, many of them being
construed by Wittgenstein as offering forms within which to cast
empirical propositions (6.32–6.36).</p>
<p>When it comes to ethical and other value propositions (such as in
aesthetics), the account is rather different. Value lies outside the
world, he claims, and what goes on here is more a matter of the attitude
we take to the world. A happy person will experience the world
differently from an unhappy person (6.43), and experiencing it as a
‘limited whole’ is the mystical feeling, he writes (6.45). With
philosophy, the account is different again. It is only in this final
subsection that Wittgenstein uses the term ‘nonsensical’ (‘unsinnig’),
once in 6.51 in characterizing scepticism and then, most notoriously of
all, in 6.54 in describing the propositions of the Tractatus themselves.
Since this is the most controversial issue of all in discussions of the
Tractatus, we will devote the whole of §5 of this Introduction to
it.</p>
<p>4.7. Proposition 7</p>
<p>We finally come to proposition 7: ‘Of what one cannot speak, about
that one must be silent.’23 As noted above, it was first formulated as a
conclusion to the dual claims that logic and ethics are transcendental.
As such it is impossible to speak of them, according to Wittgenstein,
since no propositions about them are possible. But the logical structure
of the world is shown by logical propositions, and one’s ethical or
religious attitude, we might also suggest (drawing out the implication
of what Wittgenstein says), is shown by our behaviour towards others and
our feelings about the world. Wittgenstein undoubtedly felt, however,
that there was too much ‘gassing’, as he put it in his letter to Ficker,
about all this, especially ethics, which is why he wanted to recommend
that people just keep quiet about such matters. (‘Schweigen’ can mean
not just ‘be silent’ but also ‘shut up’.) His treatise ended up being
conceived, at least for such people as Ficker, as providing an argument
for this recommendation.</p>
<p>Let us conclude, then, by emphasizing the importance of recognizing
the tree structure of the Tractatus. Not only did this structure
facilitate the composition of the Tractatus, but it also facilitates our
understanding if we follow out each line of thinking along one of the
sequential branches, beginning with 1 to 7 and then looking in turn at
all the propositions of the form n.m, n.0m, and n.00m, before
progressing to the lower-level propositions. Some of these can also be
considered separately, if we wish to understand particular propositions
on the higher levels (such as in reading 2.11 to 2.19 in understanding
his claim in 2.1 that ‘We picture facts’), or we can then proceed to a
full reading. As Wittgenstein claimed in his letter to Ficker, the
treatise does indeed become perspicuous and clear once we attend to the
numbering, and we can thereby build up an understanding of the work, as
this section has hopefully shown. The brilliance of the construction of
the Tractatus has not been appreciated as much as it should. It is an
intellectual creation of the highest order, the tree structure creating
the logical space in which his ideas found their expression and meaning.
It is the greatest example of a philosophical work of art in the
twentieth century, and deserves to be read and understood as such.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>A book of nonsense?</li>
</ol>
<p>The outstanding problem for readers and interpreters of the Tractatus
is undoubtedly Wittgenstein’s notorious claim in 6.54 that the
propositions in his book are nonsensical. If he is right, then why
should we bother to read it? Given his conception of propositions as
pictures representing states of affairs and his specification of the
general propositional form, his claim seems an unavoidable conclusion,
since one is hard pressed to find any of his propositions representing
states of affairs. Yet, as we have just seen, a whole range of
propositions—in logic, mathematics, science, ethics, and aesthetics—are
thereby excluded, and Wittgenstein seems careful not to call them
‘nonsensical’ (‘unsinnig’). In the 6s the only other remark in which the
term is used is 6.51, and both 6.51 and 6.54 are comments on 6.5, which
opens with the claim that ‘When an answer cannot be stated, neither can
the question be stated.’ Wittgenstein goes on to say in 6.51 that
‘Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries
to doubt where nothing can be asked.’ Since scepticism is a
philosophical position, it is what we say in doing philosophy that
Wittgenstein seems to want to claim is nonsensical (cf. 4.003). But if
the Tractatus itself is a work of philosophy, then how much of what he
says himself is nonsensical?</p>
<p>Over the last twenty years there has been heated debate about how
seriously we must take Wittgenstein’s claim in 6.54. A group of ‘new
Wittgensteinians’, as they have been called, or ‘resolute readers’, as
some have preferred to call themselves, have urged that we must take it
very seriously indeed and not ‘chicken out’ in trying to find a way to
treat nonsense as illuminating.24 The purpose of the Tractatus, they
claim, is ‘therapeutic’: by working through the book, we are brought to
recognize how the metaphysical claims we may be inclined to make are
illusory. We have already seen examples of such metaphysical claims,
such as Frege made in distinguishing between concept and object and
Russell made in expounding his theory of types. The Tractatus is indeed
concerned with diagnosing what goes wrong here, and it is significant
that seven of the fifteen occurrences of ‘nonsensical’ in the book occur
in the 4.12s, where Wittgenstein’s diagnosis is offered (see the
Glossary to identify all the occurrences).</p>
<p>The resolute readers are quite right to emphasize these and similar
passages (such as the 5.473s), which form the core of Wittgenstein’s
critique of Frege and Russell, and much light has been shed on the
Tractatus by the various readings that have been offered and the
responses that they have provoked. But we are on slippery ground, as
Wittgenstein’s diagnosis and critique relies on distinctions that he
himself draws—most notably, between saying and showing and between real
and formal concepts. It is then natural to ask whether his own
statements and explanations of these should also count as
nonsensical—and in turn, of course, whether this also applies to what
the resolute readers say about it all.</p>
<p>Opponents of resolute readings stress that Wittgenstein, both before,
in, and after the Tractatus, seems not to have regarded what he was
trying to show as entirely illusory, but rather as merely ineffable. In
the preface, for example, he states unashamedly that ‘the truth of the
thoughts conveyed here is unassailable and definitive’, although he
admits how little is achieved once the problems of philosophy have been
solved ‘in essence’. He clearly thought that something was shown in his
work, and it is the conception of showing that holds the key to
understanding what he was doing, difficult as that is to explain.</p>
<p>We cannot do justice to the debate between resolute readers and their
critics in this Introduction, let alone settle it. But one further
aspect should be mentioned here. The resolute reading was motivated by
dissatisfaction with what was called the ‘traditional reading’,
according to which Wittgenstein did indeed advance metaphysical claims
in the Tractatus, especially in sections 1 and 2 in talking of the
world, facts, states-of-things, simple objects, and so on. On the
resolute reading, these were only made as part of his therapeutic
strategy: by the end we are meant to see them as nonsensical and hence
to discard them. But there is an intermediate position here:
Wittgenstein did not think of them at the time as metaphysical and hence
nonsensical, or at any rate as nonsensical as the claims made by Frege
and Russell, but simply as the way to elucidate his dual conception of
propositions as pictures and of the general propositional form. They
show the form of the world, without which logic and language (as we know
it) would not be possible: they are the barest minimum of transcendental
conditions. In this respect it is significant that all the propositions
in the first two sections (with just a couple of exceptions in the case
of the lowest-level propositions) were only formulated by Wittgenstein
in the process of coming up with and developing his plan for the
Tractatus, in other words, once he finally felt clear about his core
conception of propositions as pictures. On 2 August 1916, so shortly
after this plan had been hatched, he remarks: ‘My work has expanded from
the foundations of logic to the essence of the world’ (NB, p. 78). This
may sound metaphysical but the context suggests more of a concern to
identify the transcendental conditions of our language and thought—and
only through this of the world.</p>
<p>This intermediate position may be unstable, and in retrospect we can
certainly see the claims he made as both metaphysical and problematic—as
he himself did when he revisited his work later. A remark he makes in
the Philosophical Investigations is revealing: ‘The results of
philosophy are the discovery of some piece of plain nonsense and the
bumps that the understanding has got by running up against the limits of
language. They—these bumps—make us see the value of that discovery’ (PI,
§119). Wittgenstein had stated explicitly in his preface to the
Tractatus that his aim had been to draw a limit to language (and hence
to the expression of thoughts) from within language. But the temptation
to overstep these limits in doing so is irresistible, and it was perhaps
inevitable that he did so himself in the Tractatus. None of this
invalidates his project, however, as long as we appreciate what he was
trying to do. As he said in 6.54, ‘My propositions elucidate when
someone who understands me finally recognizes them as nonsensical by
using them to climb up, over, and out of them’ (italics added). In the
end, their disputed status as ‘nonsensical’ is far less important than
what we can learn from them, and this is dependent on the effort that
each of us makes to understand him.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Wittgenstein’s later critique of the Tractatus</li>
</ol>
<p>After the publication of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein maintained, by
and large, his philosophical silence until he was gradually tempted back
into philosophy by discussions with members of the Vienna Circle. In
1929 he returned to Cambridge and began re-assessing his old ideas and
developing new ones. The story of his later development is long and
complex and all that can be done here is to select some of the key ideas
and themes and outline what transformations occurred. We shall focus on
four moves: from a monistic conception of logic to a pluralist view of
what he called language-games; from the acceptance of subsistent simple
objects to recognition of the role of samples; from concern with
signification to a much greater emphasis on use in understanding
meaning; and from preoccupation with the general propositional form to
exploring the diversity of particular propositional forms.25</p>
<p>6.1. From Logic to Language-Games</p>
<p>The first problem in his earlier views that Wittgenstein attempted to
solve on his return to philosophy concerned the supposed logical
independence of elementary propositions (4.211). ‘A is red’, said of a
point, might seem to be an obvious example of an elementary proposition,
but this contradicts ‘A is green’. Wittgenstein had recognized the
problem in his notebooks (NB, pp. 81, 91), but had assumed that physics
would provide the analysis to show how it was logically impossible for
something to be both red and green (6.3751). In ‘Some Remarks on Logical
Form’ (1929), he tried to solve the problem by suggesting that numbers
must somehow enter into the logical forms of colour propositions to
reflect the degree of quality involved, such as position along a
spectrum. But since identifying their logical form would then depend on
the results of scientific investigation, this contradicted his
fundamental assumption that logic must take care of itself (5.473). He
disowned the paper before it was even published (see §1 above) and came
to believe, instead, that elementary propositions could be divided into
Satzsysteme, or systems of propositions, only one member of which could
be true in any given situation. Only propositions from different systems
would be logically independent.</p>
<p>What the problem of colour exclusion forced Wittgenstein to recognize
was that there are forms of logical inference that cannot be handled
within his theory of truth-functions. ‘A is red; therefore A is not
green’ is just one such inference. The rules for the logical connectives
are thus only part of a much more complex set of rules (cf. WVC, pp. 74,
76; PR, pp. 109, 111). The new project that this then suggests—to
provide an account of the logic of the various Satzsysteme—was to
develop into the description and elucidation of what he called
‘language-games’ in his later work. There may be language-games for
using colour terms, for describing shapes, for counting, for talking
about our feelings, and so on. Each language-game would have its own set
of rules, which may or may not be formalizable into a logical theory,
even if there might be some basic logical rules (such as modus ponens)
that are still followed. Rules from different language-games might also
interfere with one another, generating further confusions for the
philosopher to clear up.</p>
<p>6.2. From Simples to Samples</p>
<p>In thinking further about colour propositions Wittgenstein also
explored representing them geometrically—assigning them a position along
certain colour axes, as illustrated by the two diagrams below (cf. PR,
p. 278; WLL, p. 8).</p>
<p>‘Every statement about colours’, Wittgenstein remarks, ‘can be
represented by means of such symbols. If we say that four elementary
colours would suffice, I call such symbols of equal status elements of
representation. These elements of representation are the “objects”’
(WVC, p. 43). The reference here is to his conception of simple objects
in the Tractatus, and within a year he is talking of these ‘elements of
representation’ as samples. ‘What I once called “objects”, simples, were
simply what I could refer to without running the risk of their possible
non-existence; i.e. that for which there is neither existence nor
non-existence, and that means: what we can speak about no matter what
may be the case’ (PR, p. 72). He goes on: ‘If I want to tell someone
what colour some material is to be, I send him a sample, and obviously
this sample belongs to language’ (PR, p. 73). A particular set of
objects may indeed be presupposed by a given language-game, then, but
these objects are not the simples of the Tractatus but the samples that
function as the elements of representation, as part of the symbolism
itself.</p>
<p>In his later Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein discusses
simples and samples in §§39–64. §50 is the key section. In asking what
it is to attribute existence to an element, he writes:</p>
<p>There is one thing of which one can state neither that it is 1 metre
long, nor that it is not 1 metre long, and that is the standard metre in
Paris.—But this is, of course, not to ascribe any remarkable property to
it, but only to mark its peculiar role in the game of measuring with a
metre-rule.—Suppose that samples of colour were preserved in Paris like
the standard metre. So we explain that “sepia” means the colour of the
standard sepia which is kept there hermetically sealed. Then it will
make no sense to state of this sample either that it is of this colour
or that it is not.</p>
<pre><code>We can put it like this: This sample is an instrument of the language, by means of which we make colour statements. In this game, it is not something that is represented, but is a means of representation… . And to say “If it did not exist, it could have no name” is to say as much and as little as: if this thing did not exist, we could not use it in our language-game.—What looks as if it had to exist is part of the language. It is a paradigm in our game; something with which comparisons are made. And this may be an important observation; but it is none the less an observation about our language-game—our mode of representation.   (PI, §50)</code></pre>
<p>Denying that the standard metre is a metre long might seem absurd,
but if measuring something as a metre long requires laying the standard
metre alongside it (if this is the language-game we play), then we
cannot measure the standard metre itself. To explain Wittgenstein’s idea
further, consider the following inference:</p>
<p>Assuming that (a), (b), and (c) have sense, the inference is clearly
valid. But what if ‘X’ is replaced by ‘the standard metre’? According to
Wittgenstein, (b) now lacks sense, but this does not mean that the
inference becomes invalid, since (b) simply drops out altogether: (c)
can be directly inferred from (a). If Y is the same length as the
standard metre, then it is one metre long. On Wittgenstein’s account,
(b) is now the expression of a rule, licensing the passage from (a) to
(c), rather than a premise in itself.</p>
<p>There is an obvious comparison here with the inference we considered
in §3.4 above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>P</p></li>
<li><p>P ⊃ Q</p>
<pre><code>______</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Q</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is also a valid inference, but if we replace ‘Q’ by ‘P ∨ Q’ (‘P
or Q’), we can now infer (3) directly from (1): (2) is no longer a
required premise, but is simply an expression of the rule licensing the
inference (i.e. ‘From “P” infer “P ∨ Q”’). This was, of course, one of
Wittgenstein’s key ideas in the Tractatus: logical propositions such as
‘P ⊃ P ∨ Q’ are senseless, merely showing that a certain inference is
valid (cf. 6.1201, 6.1221, 6.1264). Although he came to reject the idea
that all logical propositions are truth-functional tautologies, he
continued to believe that logical propositions—understood as expressions
of inferential rules—lacked sense.</p>
<p>6.3. From Signifying to Use</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s discussion of the standard metre is embedded in a
broader critique of what he took to be an underlying assumption of his
Tractatus, that ‘a name ought really to signify a simple’, as he puts it
in §39 of the Philosophical Investigations. The meaning of a name, he
argues, is not the object to which it refers to on a given occasion.
That is to mistake its meaning with its bearer: a name does not lose its
meaning when its bearer dies (PI, §40). It is in this context that
Wittgenstein makes one of his most famous later claims: ‘For a large
class of cases of the employment of the word “meaning”—though not for
all—this word can be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its
use in the language’ (PI, §43). This is often seen to mark a radical
change from his view in the Tractatus, but even there he had stressed
that ‘To recognize the symbol by its sign, one must pay attention to the
senseful use’ (3.326).</p>
<p>What happens, then, when the samples that are part of the symbolism
of a particular language-game are destroyed? The language-game itself
changes and may eventually stop being played altogether. Imagine that
all the red things in our environment vanish overnight. Initially we may
rely on our memory to continue to talk of red things, but over time we
will be unable to explain the use of ‘red’ to others, such as those who
are born later, and the language-game may wither away (cf. PI, §§56–7).
It is tempting to suppose that if we can talk of red things at all, then
there must be some universal property (some Platonic form) of redness
that ‘exists timelessly’. In resisting the temptation to make such
metaphysical statements, Wittgenstein considers treating ‘Red exists’ as
saying no more than ‘“Red” has a meaning’ and ‘Red does not exist’ as
saying no more than ‘“Red” does not have a meaning’, propositions about
our use of language (PI, §58). Commenting on the latter, though, he goes
on:</p>
<p>Only we do not want to say that that expression [‘Red does not
exist’] says this, but that this is what it would have to be saying if
it made sense—that the expression actually contradicts itself in the
attempt to say that just because red exists ‘in and of itself’. Whereas
the only contradiction lies in something like this: the sentence looks
as if it were about the colour, while it is supposed to be saying
something about the use of the word “red”.—In reality, however, we quite
readily say that a particular colour exists, and that is as much as to
say that something exists that has that colour. And the first expression
is no less accurate than the second. (PI, §58)</p>
<p>We see here a significant transformation of his approach in the
Tractatus. Rather than treating a sentence such as ‘Red exists’ (or
‘Simple objects exist’) as saying something that, strictly speaking, can
only be shown, he considers the actual use of such sentences, which may
make perfect sense on a given occasion, such as in just meaning ‘Red
things exist’. It is the philosopher who gives them a misleading spin or
uses them in confused or confusing ways. As Wittgenstein says, ‘What we
do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use’
(PI, §116). What he had previously assigned to the realm of ‘showing’ he
now realizes can be elucidated by carefully describing our various uses
of language.</p>
<p>6.4. From the General Propositional form to Particular Propositional
Forms</p>
<p>In 4.5 of the Tractatus Wittgenstein characterized the general form
of a proposition as: ‘such and such is the case [es verhält sich so und
so]’. In §114 of the Investigations he comments directly on this: ‘That
is the kind of proposition one repeats to oneself countless times. One
thinks that one is tracing nature over and over again, and one is merely
tracing round the frame through which we look at it.’ In §115 he goes
on: ‘A picture held us captive. And we couldn’t get outside it, for it
lay in our language, and language seemed only to repeat it to us
inexorably.’ In its place, Wittgenstein urges us to recognize the
diversity of propositional forms, or as he prefers to express it, of the
different kinds of uses of the things we call ‘signs’ (‘Zeichen’),
‘words’ (‘Worte’), and ‘sentences’ (‘Sätze’, where ‘sentence’ is now the
appropriate translation of ‘Satz’). The term ‘language-game’ is
introduced in this context, to emphasize that ‘the speaking of language
is part of an activity, or of a form of life’ (PI, §23). He gives
examples to illustrate the variety of language-games: giving orders,
describing an object, reporting an event, making up a story, guessing
riddles, translating, and so on (PI, §23).</p>
<p>Here too, though, there are anticipations of the diversity of
propositional forms in the 6.3s. Wittgenstein talks in 6.341, for
example, of different nets for describing the world. In describing the
world, the resulting propositions are presumably all still seen as
exemplifying the general propositional form; but on his return to
philosophy, he was soon emphasizing that function–argument form, just
like subject–predicate form, is only a norm of representation, a mould
into which things are squeezed (see e.g. PR, pp. 136–7). Representing
all propositions as truth-functions of elementary propositions is itself
such a mould, a frame that Wittgenstein had mistakenly taken to be
tracing nature itself.</p>
<p>His use of ‘picture’ in §115 is also significant, for it marks a
different concern with ‘pictures’ in his later work. On his later view,
his conception of propositions as pictures is itself a picture, a way of
seeing something that may seem irresistible, that seems to force itself
upon us (cf. PI, §140), but which may mislead us in all sorts of ways.
What he says in the Investigations about such ‘pictures’ applies to his
conception of propositions as pictures: ‘A picture is conjured up which
seems to fix the sense unambiguously. The actual use, compared with that
traced out by the picture, seems like something muddied’ (PI, §426). At
the same time, Wittgenstein takes an interest in the ambiguity of
(drawn) pictures such as the duck–rabbit picture (PI, PPF, §xi), which
we can see either as a duck or as a rabbit. Yet again, we have an
anticipation of this interest in 5.5423 of the Tractatus, but his
concern with aspect perception takes on methodological significance, as
part of his later philosophical project is aimed at getting us to
recognize new aspects of things, or aspects that had become hidden
because of their familiarity (PI, §129), in dissolving philosophical
problems or puzzlement.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The significance of the Tractatus in the history of philosophy</li>
</ol>
<p>Wittgenstein is often described as having inaugurated the linguistic
turn in philosophy, which began with the Tractatus and continued through
his later work. All philosophy, he had declared in 4.0031, is ‘critique
of language’. Language disguises thought (4.002) and the aim is to
uncover the real logical form of propositions, which may well be much
more complex than their surface grammatical form. But as Wittgenstein
says in this context, it was Russell’s merit to have shown this, in his
theory of descriptions, and we should also see Frege as helping
inaugurate the linguistic turn in his analysis of number statements.
Wittgenstein’s central role in the linguistic turn is indisputable,
however, and the linguistic turn itself has formed a central thread in
the development of analytic philosophy, more generally. Even among those
who have returned to systematic metaphysical theorizing, careful
attention to language is still an essential part.</p>
<p>When we consider the more detailed level, however, assessment of the
significance of the Tractatus becomes more complex. One of the first
reviews, and certainly the most substantial and insightful, was by
Ramsey in 1923, and his own subsequent work on philosophy and the
foundations of mathematics was heavily influenced by the Tractatus—and
the conversations he later had with Wittgenstein (see Note on the Text,
§6). Ramsey tragically died in 1930, however, at the age of just 26,
although his own legacy has lived on.</p>
<p>The Tractatus was also a major influence on the logical
positivists—the members of the Vienna Circle. They took over
Wittgenstein’s conception of logical propositions as tautologies and
approved of what they saw as his wholesale repudiation of metaphysics.
But they stayed silent about his conception of showing, and focused more
on scientific verifiability as the criterion for senseful propositions
(although this was also influenced by discussions with Wittgenstein that
they later had). When logical positivism was imported into Britain
through the work of A. J. Ayer, in his iconoclastic Language, Truth and
Logic of 1936, Wittgenstein’s view of ethics influenced the emergence of
emotivism, the view that ethical (and aesthetic and religious)
propositions are neither true nor false (since they cannot be verified)
but are merely expressions of emotion. The distinction between fact and
value was to become a fundamental issue in the heated debates about
ethics that subsequently took place.</p>
<p>In Britain, in the decade that followed the publication of the
Tractatus, inspired also by Russell’s lectures on ‘The Philosophy of
Logical Atomism’ (1918), members of what came to be called the Cambridge
School of Analysis undertook analyses of all kinds of propositions in an
endeavour to uncover their ‘real’ logical form, and engaged in debate
about the nature of analysis. Key figures here were Susan Stebbing
(1885–1943) and John Wisdom (1904–93). By the mid-1930s, however,
scepticism about the whole project of reductive analysis grew and
philosophers began focusing more on clarificatory conceptual analysis,
aimed at resolving philosophical problems in a piecemeal fashion rather
than seeking to develop any systematic account. This proceeded alongside
the development of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and his own critique
of the Tractatus, which influenced philosophers through attendance at
his lectures and notes that were made of those lectures, as well as
dictated material such as the Blue and Brown Books.</p>
<p>With the rise of Nazi Germany, many of the logical
positivists—including Carnap, Hans Reichenbach (1891–1953), Herbert
Feigl (1902–88), Carl Hempel (1905–97), and Gustav Bergmann
(1906–87)—emigrated to the United States, and this boosted the interest
there in the Tractatus, in the areas of both mathematical logic and
philosophy. Max Black (1909–88), who moved to the USA in 1940 and
published the first companion to the Tractatus in 1964, Norman Malcolm,
who had studied with Wittgenstein (see §1 above), Wilfrid Sellars
(1912–89), Donald Davidson (1917–2003), Hilary Putnam (1926–2016), and
Stanley Cavell (1926–2018) are just some of the leading American
philosophers who were significantly influenced by Wittgenstein’s
work.</p>
<p>The impact of the Tractatus was not restricted to Europe and North
America, however. To take just the case of China, it was first
translated into Chinese as early as 1927 by Zhang Shenfu (1893–1986),
partly inspired by Russell’s visit to Beijing in 1920–1. Russell’s
lectures there fuelled the development of mathematical logic and
analytic philosophy in the years that followed, led by the so-called
‘new realist school’ at Tsinghua University. Two philosophers were
especially influential: Jin Yuelin (1895–1984), who visited Britain in
1922 and founded the School of Philosophy at Tsinghua in 1926, and Hung
Tscha (1909–92), who had been a member of the Vienna Circle, writing his
doctorate under Schlick’s supervision, before returning to China in 1937
to promote logical positivism. One of Jin’s students was Wang Hao
(1921–95), who was to go on to do his PhD with W. V. O. Quine
(1908–2000) at Harvard and become a distinguished logician with a deep
interest in Wittgenstein’s philosophy.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, what came to be called ‘ordinary language
philosophy’, pursued not only by Wittgenstein, whose Philosophical
Investigations was finally published in 1953, but also by philosophers
such as Gilbert Ryle (1900–76) and J. L. Austin (1911–60) at Oxford,
dominated the scene in Britain and gained a hold in North America. At
the same time, interest in Frege’s work took off, with translations
appearing for the first time, and this led to a renewal of interest in
the Tractatus. Whereas, before, Wittgenstein had been associated more
with Russell, as the joint architects of the project of logical atomism,
the influence of Frege began to be stressed, spearheaded by Elizabeth
Anscombe and later by Cora Diamond. Anscombe’s ground-breaking book on
the Tractatus was published in 1959, and a series of important articles
by Diamond began appearing in the late 1970s, which inspired the ‘new
Wittgensteinian’ debate outlined in §5 above. Her later articles were
collected in her aptly named Reading Wittgenstein with Anscombe
(2019).</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein’s later writings were published, debate about the
continuities and discontinuities in the development of his thinking
intensified. Today there is scholarly consensus that his earlier ideas
were not rejected altogether, but there is much less agreement not just
about the details of this development but also about the assessment of
his ideas. When Michael Dummett published his pioneering book on Frege,
Frege: Philosophy of Language, in 1973, arguing that Frege should be
seen as the founder of modern (truth-conditional) semantic theory,
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus was co-opted onto this programme, and
Wittgenstein’s later critique of his earlier ideas became part of the
debate about the viability of theories of meaning. In some quarters his
Tractatus is now valued far more highly than any of his later work,
echoing a view that Russell famously expressed in comparing
Wittgenstein’s earlier and later work:</p>
<p>The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted
to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems
of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so
I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the
contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have
invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary.26</p>
<p>This is deeply unfair, however. The seriousness of Wittgenstein’s
thinking comes out throughout his life, and if anyone can be called a
philosophical genius, then it is surely him. One way to show that
Russell is wrong is to bring out the continuities in Wittgenstein’s
philosophy. The most fundamental continuity is his concern with the
limits of language and thought. Philosophy is the discipline that works
at the very cutting-edge of thinking, forging new conceptual tools and
creating richer forms of expression in making sense of our evolving
world, thought, and language, while continually negotiating the
boundaries between sense and nonsense. Inevitably, one transgresses the
boundaries in trying to find them, and such transgression may even be
necessary to critique and transform our conceptual schemes.
Wittgenstein, more than perhaps any other philosopher, was acutely aware
of the drive to philosophize and the dangers it inevitably brings, and
deeply sensitive to the phenomenology of philosophical thinking. The
Tractatus crystallizes the thoughts that he had about all this in the
earliest period of his intellectual life and set the agenda not only for
his own subsequent thinking but also for much of the philosophizing that
was inspired by the linguistic turn that he played such a central role
in inaugurating.</p>

<p>21 There are in fact two Sheffer functions, ‘neither … nor’ (NOR) and
‘not both’ (NAND). Sheffer originally used ‘|’ for the former, but ‘↓’
is now standardly used for this (and called the Peirce arrow), with ‘|’
reserved for ‘not both’ (and which is what is now called the Sheffer
stroke, rather confusingly in the present context). Wittgenstein uses
‘|’ in 5.101 when he symbolizes ‘neither p nor q’, and this (Sheffer’s
original) usage is followed here.</p>
<p>22 To avert possible misunderstanding at this point, though, what is
‘transcendental’, understood as the limits (or conditions of
possibility) of language, thought, and the world, must be distinguished

limits, the idea of which Wittgenstein rejects.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Origin and composition</li>
</ol>
<p>The composition, publication, and English translation of the text of
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus has a complex history that
deserves a separate account of its own.1 Its origin lies in the
notebooks in which Wittgenstein wrote down his thoughts from the time he
began working with Russell at Cambridge in 1912. Before he departed for
Norway in October 1913 he left some notes for Bertrand Russell,
extracted from these notebooks, which were posthumously published as
Appendix 1 of Notebooks 1914–1916.2 In Spring 1914 G. E. Moore visited
him in Norway, where Wittgenstein dictated some further notes, which now
constitute Appendix 2 of the Notebooks. Wittgenstein served in the
Austrian army during the First World War from August 1914 until he was
captured on the Italian Front in November 1918, after which he spent ten
months in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy. Throughout the war he
continued to write down his thoughts in notebooks, some of which have
survived and been translated (by Elizabeth Anscombe) and published as
the main text of the Notebooks.3</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had various periods away from the warfront, either on
leave or working as a military engineer, and during these periods he
composed what eventually became the Tractatus. He began this sometime in
the summer of 1915 when he started a new notebook, which has also
survived and is catalogued as MS 104 in the Wittgenstein archives. On
the first page he wrote down what became the first six main propositions
of the Tractatus, with the formula in the sixth added later, together
with 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. It is at this
point that he introduced his numbering system, according to which a
remark of the form n.1 is a comment on n, n.11 on n.1, and so on. This
system gave him an ingenious method to compose his treatise and not
merely to indicate the ‘logical weight’ of the propositions, as he puts
it in his footnote to the first proposition of the Tractatus. He could
add new remarks consecutively in the notebook but by numbering them he
could indicate their place in the eventual treatise. Some remarks were
indeed new but many were selected from his other notebooks, revised as
appropriate. When the notebook (MS 104) was discovered in Vienna in 1965
by G. H. von Wright, it was edited, translated, and published as the
Prototractatus in 1971,4 with the remarks arranged in the order
indicated by their decimal numbering. It is revealing to see this
earlier version of the Tractatus, but its arrangement obscures the
chronological order in which the remarks were written or added, which is
also helpful for scholars. The original notebook is now available
online, however, with impressive editing by Martin Pilch and others,
which scholars can consult for a more detailed understanding of the
composition of the Tractatus.5</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had a longer leave than normal in the summer of 1918,
and this is when the Tractatus took its final form, under the title
‘Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung’ (‘Logico-Philosophical Treatise’).
There are significant changes from the Prototractatus, as later
constructed, to the Tractatus itself, but the critical edition of the
Tractatus that was published in German in 1989 (LPA) prints each page of
the Tractatus with the corresponding remarks of the Prototractatus (and
remarks from other notebooks) on the facing page, so that comparison can
be made. The Tractatus was essentially finished in August 1918. Several
typed copies were made, one of which was eventually sent by his sister
to Gottlob Frege (arriving in early 1919) and another of which
Wittgenstein took with him to the Italian Front in October 1918. After
capture, Wittgenstein continued to make minor revisions while in
prisoner-of-war camps, and in March 1919 he wrote to Russell telling him
about the book and claiming to have ‘solved our problems finally. This
may sound arrogant but I can’t help believing it’ (WC, p. 89). He
eventually managed to get his corrected version sent to Russell, in June
1919, but in the meantime he received a copy of Russell’s Introduction
to Mathematical Philosophy, which Russell had written while in prison in
1918 and which had been published in March 1919. Wittgenstein was
disappointed to find that it showed no understanding at all, as he saw
it, of his notes from 1913 and 1914, and he wrote back expressing his
hope of meeting Russell in person to explain his ideas (WC, p. 93). This
only became possible once he was freed from the prisoner-of-war camp in
August 1919.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>First attempts at finding a publisher</li>
</ol>
<p>Wittgenstein had first tried to find a publisher as soon as his book
was finished in August 1918. He sent it to Jahoda andandandand Siegel,
the publisher of Karl Kraus’s work, but heard back by the end of October
that it had been rejected. On his return from Italy, he sent it to
Wilhelm Braumüller, the publisher of Otto Weininger’s work, and asked
Russell to send a letter of recommendation in support, which Russell
did. But Braumüller made publication conditional on payment for the
paper and printing, a condition which Wittgenstein refused to accept.
Wittgenstein had been in correspondence with Frege throughout the war,
and although Frege had professed not to understand Wittgenstein’s
treatise when he tried to read it, he nevertheless offered (in a letter
dated 30 September 1919) to help find a publisher.6 What Frege had in
mind was the publisher of the Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen
Idealismus (edited by his Jena colleague Bruno Bauch), in which Frege’s
own paper ‘Der Gedanke’ (1918) had just appeared. But nothing came of
this, either, not least because Frege had recommended that the whole
treatise be revised to make the arguments clearer, something which
Wittgenstein was also unwilling to do.</p>
<p>In October 1919 he then approached Ludwig von Ficker, whom he had got
to know in Vienna before the war in soliciting his help in giving away
some of his inheritance. Ficker was editor of Der Brenner, a literary
periodical, and was in contact with writers and artists such as Rainer
Maria Rilke, Oskar Kokoschka, and Georg Trakl, who then benefited from
Wittgenstein’s largesse. In his initial letter offering his manuscript,
Wittgenstein said only that ‘the work is strictly philosophical and at
the same time literary, but there’s no gassing in it’.7 After a positive
response expressing interest, Wittgenstein sent the manuscript with an
accompanying letter containing a passage that is now frequently quoted,
revealing as it is of the ‘ethical’ dimension of the book:</p>
<p>it will probably be a help to you if I write a few words about my
book. You see, I am quite sure that you won’t get all that much out of
reading it. Because you won’t understand it; its subject matter will
seem quite alien to you. But it isn’t really alien to you, because the
book’s point is an ethical one. I once meant to include in the preface a
sentence which is not in fact there now but which I will write out for
you here, because it will perhaps be a key to the work for you. What I
meant to write, then, was this: My work consists of two parts: the one
presented here plus all that I have not written. And it is precisely
this second part that is the important one. My book draws limits to the
sphere of the ethical from the inside as it were, and I am convinced
that this is the ONLY rigorous way of drawing those limits. In short, I
believe that where many others today are just gassing, I have managed in
my book to put everything firmly into place by being silent about it.
And for that reason, unless I am very much mistaken, the book will say a
great deal that you yourself want to say. Only perhaps you won’t see
that it is said in the book. For now, I would recommend you to read the
preface and the conclusion, because they contain the most direct
expression of the point of the book.8</p>
<p>Ficker, too, however, soon got cold feet (perhaps because of these
words), although he offered to publish it as a special favour if no
other option availed itself. This was also something that Wittgenstein
was not prepared to accept, of course. Ficker said he would ask Rilke if
he could help find another publisher, but nothing came of this, either.
Wittgenstein realized that his best chance lay in convincing Russell of
the value of his work, and he pressed ahead with his arrangements to
travel to The Hague, where he and Russell had agreed to meet for a week
in the middle of December.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Meeting with Russell in December 1919</li>
</ol>
<p>In the lead-up to their meeting in the Netherlands, Wittgenstein and
Russell had exchanged a series of letters. On 13 August 1919 Russell had
written: ‘I am sure you are right in thinking the book of first-class
importance. But in places it is obscure through brevity’ (WC, p. 96). He
raised a number of specific questions, some of which Wittgenstein
briefly answered in his reply of 19 August. But in responding to the
general charge of obscurity, Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>some of your questions want a very lengthy answer and you know how
difficult it is for me to write on logic. That’s also the reason why my
book is so short, and consequently so obscure. But that I can’t
help.—Now I’m afraid you haven’t really got hold of my main contention,
to which the whole business of logical prop[osition]s is only a
corollary. The main point is the theory of what can be expressed
(gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the
same, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by
prop[osition]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the
cardinal problem of philosophy.</p>
<pre><code>I also sent my M.S. to Frege. He wrote to me a week ago and I gather that he doesn’t understand a word of it all. So my only hope is to see you soon and explain all to you, for it is VERY hard not to be understood by a single soul! (WC, p. 98)</code></pre>
<p>This offers an alternative formulation of the point he had made to
Ficker about drawing the limits of thought and ethics from the inside,
expressed in terms of his distinction between saying and showing, and
making explicit that he regards this as the cardinal problem of
philosophy. It also reveals the despair that he was clearly feeling as a
result of both Russell’s and Frege’s failure to appreciate his book, the
primary aim of which had been to solve the problems that he had seen as
arising in their own work.</p>
<p>When Russell and Wittgenstein finally met, for the first time in over
six years, they spent a whole week together. As Russell reported
afterwards, in one of his regular letters to Lady Ottoline Morrell on 20
December:</p>
<p>we discussed his book every day. I came to think even better of it
than I had done; I feel sure it is a really great book, though I do not
feel sure it is right. I told him I could not refute it, and that I was
sure it was either all right or all wrong, which I considered the mark
of a good book; but it would take me years to decide which. This of
course didn’t satisfy him, but I couldn’t say more.</p>
<pre><code>I had felt in his book a flavour of mysticism, but was astonished when I found that he has become a complete mystic. He reads people like Kierkegaard and Angelus Silesius, he seriously contemplates becoming a monk… . He has penetrated deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I think (though he wouldn’t agree) that what he likes best in mysticism is its power to make him stop thinking. I don’t much think he will really become a monk—it is an idea, not an intention. His intention is to be a teacher.9</code></pre>
<p>On a more practical level, Russell promised to do what he could to
get the book published, agreeing to write an introduction to it and
even, so it seemed, to translate it into English himself, so that it
could be published in Britain. Wittgenstein returned to Vienna in good
spirits. As he wrote to Russell on 8 January 1920, ‘I enjoyed our time
together very much and I have the feeling (haven’t you too?) that we did
a great deal of real work during that week’ (WC, p. 113).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Further attempts—and final success—at finding a publisher</li>
</ol>
<p>Back in Vienna, Wittgenstein learnt of a new publisher interested in
his book: Reclam in Leipzig, after contact had been made with them by
his friend, Paul Engelmann. Wittgenstein was hopeful that, with an
introduction by Russell, they would accept it. He wrote to Russell on 19
January 1920 to ask for the introduction, and chased it up on 19 March,
but that was the very day that Russell sent it, the delay caused by a
broken collarbone (WC, pp. 116–17). Wittgenstein replied on 9 April to
thank him, adding that it was now being translated into German to
accompany his book. At the same time, though, he couldn’t help giving
expression to a certain disappointment:</p>
<p>There’s so much of it that I’m not quite in agreement with—both where
you’re critical of me and also where you’re simply trying to elucidate
my point of view. But that doesn’t matter. The future will pass judgment
on us—or perhaps it won’t, and if it is silent that will be a judgment
too. (WC, p. 118)</p>
<p>When the translation into German came back, however, the
disappointment deepened, as he felt obliged to explain to Russell on 6
May:</p>
<p>now you’ll be angry with me when I tell you something: Your
Introduction is not going to be printed and as a consequence my book
probably won’t be either.—You see, when I actually saw the German
translation of the Introduction, I couldn’t bring myself to let it be
printed with my work. All the refinement of your English style was,
obviously, lost in the translation and what remained was superficiality
and misunderstanding. Well, I sent the treatise with your Introduction
to Reclam and wrote saying that I didn’t want the Introduction printed,
it was meant to serve only for his own orientation in relation to my
work. It is now highly probable that as a result Reclam won’t accept my
work (though I’ve had no answer from him yet). But I’ve already
comforted myself on that score, by means of the following argument,
which seems to me unanswerable. Either my piece is a work of the highest
rank, or it is not a work of the highest rank. In the latter (and more
probable) case I myself am in favour of its not being printed. And in
the former case it’s a matter of indifference whether it’s printed
twenty or a hundred years sooner or later. After all, who asks whether
the Critique of Pure Reason, for example, was written in 17x or y. So
really in the former case too my treatise wouldn’t need to be
printed.—And now, don’t be angry! Perhaps it was ungrateful of me but I
couldn’t do anything else. (WC, pp. 119–20)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein correctly anticipated Reclam’s response: the book was
rejected. Russell did not receive the letter until he had returned from
a trip to Russia. With so much correspondence to catch up on, he wrote
back, on 1 July, saying simply, but very generously: ‘I don’t care
twopence about the introduction but I shall be really sorry if your book
isn’t printed. May I try, in that case, to have it printed in England or
America?’ (WC, p. 120). Wittgenstein replied on 7 July telling Russell
that he could do what he liked with it, as long as he indicated any
changes in the text that he made (WC, p. 121). He had by then received
his teaching qualification and was soon to take up a post in an
elementary school in Trattenbach, a remote village in the mountains
south of Vienna.</p>
<p>Russell, however, was about to leave for China, to teach at Peking
University for a year, so he entrusted the job of finding a publisher to
Dorothy Wrinch, with whom he had discussed the book the previous year.
Cambridge University Press, to their shame, turned it down in January
1921, though this may have been because it had been offered without
Russell’s introduction. Wrinch approached the editors of three German
journals. One said that they would only accept psychological and not
philosophical works, one suggested asking again later that year, and the
third was Wilhelm Ostwald, editor of the Annalen der Naturphilosophie,
who replied as follows: ’In any other case I should have declined to
accept the article. But I have such an extremely high regard for Mr
Bertrand Russell, both for his researches and for his personality, that
I will gladly publish Mr Wittgenstein’s article … Mr Bertrand Russell’s
Introduction will be particularly welcome.’10 So it was that
Wittgenstein’s work was finally published, in German, with Russell’s
introduction newly translated, in November 1921, in what turned out to
be the very last issue of Ostwald’s journal.</p>
<p>Russell didn’t hear about its acceptance by Ostwald until he returned
from China at the end of August 1921. Nor did Wittgenstein know anything
about it until Russell wrote to him on 5 November, informing him and
apologizing for the fact that his introduction was also included.
Wittgenstein replied on 28 November, saying: ‘I must admit I am pleased
that my stuff is going to be printed. Even though Ostwald is an utter
charlatan. As long as he doesn’t tamper with it!’ (WC, p. 128) Russell
later assured him that Ostwald’s version was alright, although there
were indeed misprints and errors. More importantly, in his letter of 5
November, Russell also told him of the plan to include his book in a new
series edited by C. K. Ogden, entitled ‘International Library of
Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method’, published by Kegan Paul.
This news went down much better with Wittgenstein: ‘What pleases me most
is that the whole thing is going to appear in England. I hope it may be
worth all the trouble that you and others have taken with it’ (WC,
p. 128).</p>
<p>There was clearly discussion in Cambridge at this time of how to
translate ‘Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung’. Moore had suggested
‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus’, an allusion to Spinoza’s Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus, prompted by Wittgenstein’s talk of viewing the
world ‘sub specie aeterni’ in 6.45. Ogden felt that ‘Philosophical
Logic’ was better as a ‘selling title’, and Russell seemed to agree, so
this became its working title.11 When Wittgenstein finally gave his
opinion on the question (in April 1922), however, he had this to
say:</p>
<p>As to the title I think the latin one is better than the present
title. For al〈l〉though ‘Tractatus logico-philosophicus’ isn’t ideal
still it has something like the right meaning, whereas ‘Philosophical
logic’ is wrong. In fact I don’t know what it means! There is no such
thing as philosophical logic. (Unless one says that as the whole book is
nonsense the title might as well be nonsense too.) (LO, p. 20)</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>First English translation</li>
</ol>
<p>The decision was taken at the very beginning to publish the book in
both German and English: Russell had discussed this with Wittgenstein
when they had met at The Hague in December 1919. They had also agreed,
it seems, on the translation of key terms. Russell had left the passages
he had cited from Wittgenstein’s treatise untranslated when he had first
written his introduction (since the introduction was going to be
translated into German), but these were now translated for the version
that was going to accompany the book in Ogden’s series. He also made
some revisions to the introduction, mainly some additions at the
beginning. The published version of the introduction is dated May
1922.</p>
<p>Russell did not undertake the translation himself, however, despite
what Wittgenstein had understood from their meeting in The Hague; but
nor did Ogden, despite his name being recorded as the translator when
the book was published. The first draft of the translation was done by
F. P. Ramsey, who was just 18 years old when he began it (he turned 19
in February 1922) and a mathematics student at Trinity College
Cambridge. Ramsey had been shown the text and was very interested in it.
Ogden presumably advised him on the translation of the key terms that
Russell and Wittgenstein had discussed. It also appears that Russell
made some changes to the draft translation that Ramsey produced.12
Ramsey worked from an offprint of the Ostwald text, however, with its
various errors, so there were further revisions still to be made.</p>
<p>Ogden sent the draft translation to Wittgenstein in March 1922, and
he replied on 28 March to say that since he did not have the original
corrected German text with him in Trattenbach (the version he had sent
Russell, which had then gone to Ostwald), there would be a delay in
responding (LO, p. 17). He expressed his strong approval, though, of
having the original German included with the English translation. Having
received the German text, he then wrote again to Ogden on 23 April with
corrections to both the German and the English text, sending some twenty
pages of detailed comments on the translation.13 In his covering letter,
he remarks:</p>
<p>The translation as you said, was in many points by far too literal. I
have very often altered it such that now it doesn’t seem to be a
translation of the German at all. I’ve left out some words which occur
in the German text or put in others which don’t occur in the original
etc. etc. But I al〈l〉ways did it in order to translate the sense (not
the words). (LO, p. 19)</p>
<p>He concludes the letter, though, by thanking the translators for
their excellent work, noting that ‘I now understand that the translators
must have had an awful〈l〉 job’ (LO, p. 21).14</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s comments about the ‘far too literal’ character of the
translation were taken on board by Ogden, and provided a reason for
having the original German alongside the English, just as Wittgenstein
wanted. As Ogden explained in a note that was inserted at the very
beginning of the published book:</p>
<p>In rendering Mr Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
available for English readers, the somewhat unusual course has been
adopted of printing the original side by side with the translation. Such
a method of presentation seemed desirable both on account of the obvious
difficulties raised by the vocabulary and in view of the peculiar
literary character of the whole. As a result, a certain latitude has
been possible in passages to which objection might otherwise be taken as
over-literal.</p>
<pre><code>The proofs of the translation and the version of the original which appeared in the final number of Ostwald’s Annalen der Naturphilosophie (1921) have been very carefully revised by the author himself; and the Editor further desires to express his indebtedness to Mr F. P. Ramsey, of Trinity College, Cambridge, for assistance both with the translation and in the preparation of the book for the press.  (TLP, 1922, p. 5)</code></pre>
<p>The vast majority of the revisions that Wittgenstein requested or
suggested in his letter of 23 April were made. In May there was a
further exchange of letters between Ogden and Wittgenstein, in which
Wittgenstein replied to some specific questions that Ogden asked about
the translation. (That Ogden was the driving force in getting the
Tractatus published and the contact person in communicating with
Wittgenstein may have led him to feel justified in taking credit for the
translation. But mention of mere ‘assistance’ in this note belittles
Ramsey’s contribution.) Ogden also enquired about some ‘supplements’, to
which Wittgenstein responded:</p>
<p>When I had finished the book roughly there remained certain
prop[osition]s—about a hundred—about which I was doubtful whether I
should take them in or not. These prop[osition]s were—partly—different
versions of those now contained in the book; for it had often happened
that I had written down a prop[osition] in many different forms, when
the same thought had occurred to me in different ways during the long
time I worked at that business. Another part of the supplements are
merely sketches of prop[osition]s which I thought I might some day take
up again if their thoughts should ever revive in me. That means: The
supplements are exact〈e〉ly what must not be printed. Besides THEY
REAL[L]Y CONTAIN NO ELUCIDATIONS AT ALL, but are still less clear than
the rest of my prop[osition]s. As to the shortness of the book I am
awfully sorry for it; but what can I do?! If you were to squeeze me out
like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me. To let you print the
Ergänzungen would be no remedy. It would be just as if you had gone to a
joiner and ordered a table and he had made the table too short and now
would sell you the shavings and sawdust and other rub[b]ish along with
the table to make up for its shortness. (Rather than print the
Ergänzungen to make the book fatter leave a dozen white sheets for the
reader to swear into[o] when he has purchased the book and can〈n〉’t
understand it.) (LO, p. 46)15</p>
<p>This is deeply revealing of Wittgenstein’s method of work and a
wonderful illustration of his creative use of analogies in making his
points and of his self-deprecation concerning his struggles with
writing. It also has a message to any translator: that various
formulations may have to be tried out in translating a phrase or
sentence before settling on one that best captures the intended sense.
And here an objection might be raised to Wittgenstein’s artistic
perfectionism, which made him reluctant to publish, and even led him to
destroy, what he saw as only rough or draft formulations of his
thoughts, such as he wrote in his notebooks. Those earlier or variant
formulations can certainly be useful to us in attempting to make sense
of his ideas, as long as we recognize, of course, their provisional or
discarded status, as ladders to reach the formulations he preferred.</p>
<p>The proofs of his book were sent to Wittgenstein in July 1922, and he
returned his corrections to them on 4 August (LO, pp. 57–63). The book
was finally published in November, just over four years after he had
completed the manuscript, and on 15 November he acknowledged receipt of
the copies sent to him, commenting ‘They real[l]y look nice. I wish
their contents were half as good as their external ap[p]earance’ (LO,
p. 68).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>From the first to the second edition</li>
</ol>
<p>Ramsey’s translation of the Tractatus was of major significance in
the lives of both Ramsey and Wittgenstein. Shortly after it was
published, Ramsey wrote a critical notice of it for the journal Mind
(1923), which is remarkable in the depth of its appreciation of both its
general concerns and many of its details, when even Frege, Russell, and
Moore had struggled to make sense of it. His work on the translation had
surely contributed to his deeper understanding. The review was finished
in the spring of 1923, and in September that year, Ramsey visited
Wittgenstein in Puchberg, where he was then teaching, and they spent two
weeks together discussing the Tractatus every afternoon. In doing so,
Wittgenstein made various corrections to both the English and the German
texts, which were recorded in Ramsey’s copy of the book.</p>
<p>In a letter to his mother, Ramsey reported that Wittgenstein’s ‘idea
of his book is not that anyone by reading it will understand his ideas,
but that some day someone will think them out again for himself, and
will derive great pleasure from finding in this book their exact
expressions’ (LO, p. 78). He also remarked that ‘Some of his sentences
are intentionally ambiguous having an ordinary meaning and a more
difficult meaning which he also believes’ (LO, p. 78), which Ramsey must
have realized complicates translation. Ramsey kept in contact with
Wittgenstein by letter, and visited him again several times the
following year. There was already discussion then of a second edition of
the Tractatus, incorporating the corrections that Wittgenstein had made,
though the book was not selling as well as Ogden had hoped. The question
came up again of adding further material, but in a letter to Ogden,
Ramsey wrote: ‘He almost certainly wouldn’t agree to any more
explanatory matter, even Russell’s introduction was a strain. I’m sorry
so few have sold’ (LO, p. 86).</p>
<p>It is also clear from a letter he wrote to Wittgenstein on 11
November 1923 that Ramsey had been finding out, on behalf of
Wittgenstein, about the possibility of his submitting the Tractatus to
obtain a degree from Cambridge. It turned out that he would not be able
to fulfil the conditions for a BA but that with another year of
residence in Cambridge (added to the two years he had spent in 1912 and
1913), he would qualify for a PhD (WC, p. 143). When Wittgenstein
finally returned to Cambridge in January 1929, to take up philosophy
again, Ramsey officially became his supervisor and helped him in the
formal process of submitting the Tractatus as a PhD. His viva took place
on 18 June 1929, with Russell and Moore as his two examiners. In his
examiner’s report, Moore concluded: ’I am inclined to think that the
dissertation as a whole is a work of genius, comparable with
acknowledged philosophical masterpieces; but, even if that is not so, I
feel quite sure that its quality is such that it would be a sheer
absurdity not to grant the Ph.D. degree to Mr. Wittgenstein.’16 With his
doctorate awarded, Wittgenstein was eligible for a Research Fellowship
at Trinity College, to which he was appointed at the end of 1930, after
submitting the manuscript on which he had been working over the previous
two years, which was posthumously published in 1975 as Philosophical
Remarks.</p>
<p>A second edition of the Tractatus finally came out in 1933, with most
of the corrections that Wittgenstein had made in Ramsey’s copy in 1923
incorporated. The publisher Kegan Paul sent the proofs to Wittgenstein
in June 1933, to which he made some further corrections, but without
adding any additional material, whether ‘explanatory’ or otherwise.17
The first edition had by then sold out, and the book had established
itself as a philosophical classic.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Second English translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Ogden’s note about the ‘over-literal’ translation in his edition was
quoted above. For those readers with some German the English text could
aid in its comprehension without being taken as providing definitive or
elegant formulations. As Wittgenstein’s influence on the development of
analytic philosophy deepened, however, and scholarly interest in his
writings blossomed after the Second World War, the need for a fresh and
more fluent translation grew. Just such a translation (with an
accompanying German text retained) was provided in 1961 by David Pears
and Brian McGuinness, two philosophers at Oxford, where Wittgenstein’s
influence was perhaps stronger than anywhere else in the world at the
time. Here is how McGuinness later described their motivation:</p>
<p>A whole generation of English-speaking philosophers came to know the
work through a translation which seems to have been not so much
liberated as shackled by the presence of the German on the opposite
page. It reads as if made from a dead language, though that may be
thought to assist the stylistic effect of a revelation which is
certainly one of the aims of the original. A smoother, and perhaps more
philosophical version has been attempted by the present writer with a
colleague.18</p>
<p>Despite what Ogden had said, in the second paragraph of his note,
about the proofs of the original translation being ‘very carefully
revised’ by Wittgenstein himself, however, Pears and McGuinness were
under the impression that Wittgenstein had not played any major role in
this respect. This impression may well have come from Elizabeth
Anscombe, who in her introduction to the Tractatus, first published in
1959, had said this: ‘English readers of the Tractatus may need to be
warned that Ogden’s translation is notoriously very bad. Wittgenstein
told me that he had not checked the whole of this translation, but only
answered a few questions that were put to him about some passages’.19 As
we have seen, this is not true. But the relevant correspondence had not
been published at the time, and the view had certainly formed (at least
in Oxford) that the original translation was ‘notoriously very bad’, as
Anscombe puts it. Anscombe was one of Wittgenstein’s literary executors
and had translated his Philosophical Investigations, which appeared in
1953, two years after his death. She also translated Wittgenstein’s
notebooks from the period 1914–16, which were published in the same year
as the new translation of the Tractatus.</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness’s translation was reviewed in the Times Literary
Supplement on 19 January 1962, and this is what the reviewer said in
talking of ‘the badness of the original translation’:</p>
<p>The difference between the experiences of reading the new and the old
versions is remarkable. It is not that the old is grossly inaccurate,
though it contains inaccuracies, but that it is throughout cloudy,
stilted and unnatural, full of sentences which could not have been
written by a native speaker of English composing in his own tongue.
Exceptionally the sense of the original escapes altogether; but quite
generally the effect is to add to intrinsic difficulty an extra quality
of baffling mysteriousness from which the new translation is entirely
free… . Mr. Pears and Mr. McGuinness, in their happier collaboration,
have not only achieved a clear and natural English but have been
meticulous in their care for accuracy.</p>
<p>A heated debate in the pages of the TLS ensued, which simmered for
years. Mark Haymon responded first on 9 February 1962 stating that
Wittgenstein himself had sanctioned the original translation ‘point by
point’: ’Wittgenstein insisted that those places where it is not an
exact translation of the German should remain because they expressed
what he wished to say better than a more exact translation. It is, of
course, open to anybody to make a new translation in a more modern
idiom, but it is misleading to suggest that such a translation gives a
more accurate rendering of Wittgenstein’s thought.’20</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness replied on 23 February:</p>
<p>It must be obvious to anyone who knows the two languages concerned
that Ogden and Ramsey’s translation contains many mistranslations and
infelicities which cannot possibly have expressed Wittgenstein’s thought
better than the original. If besides these, there are passages where
Wittgenstein composed or retained an English version that represented
his own second thoughts, clearly they ought not to be simply inserted in
what purports to be a translation. We wished to include in our edition a
list of any such passages, but did not succeed in obtaining a list from
Mr. Haymon, who was acting for Ogden’s executors. He has now written to
complain about our silence.</p>
<p>The underlying motivation for the dispute gradually became clear. In
his response on 16 March, Haymon admitted that they had indeed asked for
such a list and that this was offered to them but only in return for an
explicit acknowledgement of ‘the special nature of the original
translation and text and the circumstances of the publication and its
title’. Others contributed to the debate. On 13 April Victor Purcell
supported Haymon’s position in claiming that ‘Ogden’s translation
represents Wittgenstein’s thought at that time more exactly than any new
translation of the German can possibly do’. In the interests of both the
truth as well as justice to Ogden, he went on, ‘it is surely necessary
that any new translation should be accompanied by an account of the
circumstances in which the original translation was made’. (The present
account does just this, in accompanying the new translation offered
here, a century later. It should also be noted, of course, that credit
must be given to Ramsey as well, to whose work on the translation, it
has to be said, Ogden himself failed to do justice.)</p>
<p>Anscombe, Rhees, and von Wright, Wittgenstein’s literary executors,
also entered the fray (in a letter to the Editor of the TLS on 18
February 1965), complaining that they had not been allowed to see
Ogden’s letters from Wittgenstein and requesting that they be made
available. Eventually this material was authorized by Ogden’s estate for
publication, and in a final letter to the TLS on 9 October 1970,
Wittgenstein’s three executors conceded the correctness of what Ogden
had stated in his editorial note of 1922 and admitted that what they had
been led to believe by Wittgenstein in his later life was erroneous.
Anscombe revised the footnote, quoted above, in the fourth edition of
her book as follows: ’Ogden’s translation of the Tractatus has mistakes
which Wittgenstein did not detect. He later said (wrongly) that he did
not work on the translation; he only remembered answering a list of
questions.’21</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s Letters to C. K. Ogden with Comments on the English
Translation of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, edited by G. H. von
Wright, was finally published in 1973, and Pears and McGuinness revised
their translation accordingly (as they say in their new preface). The
second edition appeared in 1974, this time without the German text but
still including Russell’s introduction (with Russell’s own translation
of terms and sentences in the Tractatus left unchanged). Other than a
brief preface and an index (where the German for key terms was given) no
other editorial material was provided.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The present translation</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have seen, two main translations of the Tractatus have been
produced over the last century, the first by Ramsey and Ogden in 1922
(revised in 1933), and the second by Pears and McGuinness in 1961
(revised in 1974). (Scholars have, of course, provided their own
translations, in whole or part, in their own work.) Wittgenstein died in
1951, which means that in 2021, seventy years later, the copyright on
anything he wrote that was published before 1951 lapsed. Anyone is now
free to publish further translations of the Tractatus. The question
naturally arises, though, as to the need for, or value of, another
translation. The answer to the general question here is that there is
indeed value in having more than one translation of any (important)
text, even if some of the existing translations are of high quality; and
if none are of high quality, then of course there is a need for another.
Like works of philosophy themselves, translations are children of their
time, and fresh translations may well be required in new contexts, not
least when more is known about the texts and the contexts. New
translations may offer different perspectives on the text, facilitating
deeper understanding; and they may shake up the complacency that soon
sets in once an existing translation is taken as standard, complacency
which can discourage checking or revisiting the original when
interpretive claims are made, and inhibit alternative readings.</p>
<p>Let me now switch to a first-person register in motivating this new
translation of the Tractatus—as a reminder that any translation is the
work of one or more particular individuals at a particular time and
place. I am convinced that there is room for a fresh translation, and I
certainly hope that what is offered here will have value both to someone
new to Wittgenstein’s work and to scholars of his philosophy. Let me
comment first on the two translations whose story has been told above.
In my view, Ogden’s claim that Wittgenstein himself ‘very carefully
revised’ the proofs of the original translation should not be taken at
face value, despite the error that Anscombe and others clearly made in
denying it altogether. Having gone through, very carefully, all of
Wittgenstein’s correspondence to Ogden and his detailed comments on the
translation, I regard it as an exaggeration to say that it was
‘sanctioned point by point’ by Wittgenstein, as Russell (and Haymon)
claimed. Wittgenstein indicates where he finds the translation wrong,
but he is more hesitant when it comes to suggesting improvements,
recognizing the limitations of his own English. He was fluent in English
but not a native speaker, and it is native-speaker skills that one needs
in refining and polishing a translation. He recognized that the
translation was ‘in many points by far too literal’, as he told Ogden
very explicitly, which is why he wanted the German text included. As
Ogden’s note shows, including the German text provided an excuse for
leaving the translation in its clunky form.</p>
<p>Saying that Wittgenstein ‘authorized’ the translation is too strong;
he ‘allowed’ or ‘accepted’ it, but did not truly ‘endorse’ or ‘sanction’
it. There are many places where the translation lacks fluency, and it
requires a native speaker to identify them all (as opposed to just
having an impression of its being ‘far too literal’).22 Pears and
McGuinness rightly recognized its ‘stilted and unnatural’ character, as
McGuinness put it (quoted above), and with the greater sensitivity to
the nuances of language that Oxford ‘ordinary language philosophy’
encouraged in the period after the Second World War, their own
translation generally reads very well. It sets a high bar for other
translations, but it is not an insuperable bar because it is possible to
learn from, and hence build on, their work. In my view, in their concern
for fluency, in reacting to Ramsey’s translation, they take liberties
with the German text in many places, and some scholars today prefer to
go back and cite the original translation for just this reason. A fine
balance must clearly be struck between faithfulness and fluency, and
this is what I have tried to achieve, above all, in this new
translation.</p>
<p>As in the second edition of Pears and McGuinness’s translation, the
original German text is not included here. The German text is now
readily available online. However, I have provided both explanatory
notes and a glossary, so that the key German terms can always be read
back. Unlike both previous translations, however, the introduction by
Bertrand Russell is not included here (although one helpful passage is
cited in the main Introduction, §4.6). It is wrong about Wittgenstein’s
views, or distorts them, in a number of ways, and Wittgenstein himself
was never happy with it, right from the beginning. A century later, a
fresh contextualization of Wittgenstein’s work is long overdue.</p>

<li>How to read the text</li>
</ol>
<p>In the light of what has been said about its composition and history,
let me conclude by offering some brief advice on how to read the text.
The notebook (MS 104), from which the Prototractatus was constructed,
opened with the main propositions stated separately, and both these and
the general structure of the Tractatus must be kept in mind. The seven
main propositions, of the form n, and all propositions of the form n.1,
have accordingly been set out in the structure that follows the
translation. In one of his letters to Ficker, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘the
decimal numbers of my remarks absolutely must be printed alongside them,
because they alone make the book perspicuous and clear: without the
numbering it would be an incomprehensible jumble’.23 The decimal numbers
are, of course, printed in the present translation, but the numbers
themselves have also been indented in accord with their decimalization
to remind the reader throughout of the relationships between the
propositions and their relative importance.</p>
<p>In a letter to Ottoline Morrell written on 28 May 1912 Russell
reported on a conversation he had had with Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>I told him he ought not simply to state what he thinks true, but to
give arguments for it, but he said arguments spoil its beauty, and that
he would feel as if he was dirtying a flower with muddy hands. He does
appeal to me—the artist in intellect is so very rare. I told him I
hadn’t the heart to say anything against that, and that he had better
acquire a slave to state the arguments. I am seriously afraid that no
one will see the point of anything he writes, because he won’t recommend
it by arguments addressed to a different point of view.24</p>
<p>We have seen how this manifested itself in Wittgenstein’s method of
working: remarks were drafted in his notebooks, from which he would
select and refine the ones that he felt best expressed his insights,
organizing them into sequences and sub-sequences to help convey those
insights. The aim was to present his point of view, with aesthetic
considerations partly governing its presentation.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that there are no arguments in the
Tractatus. On the contrary, there is a wealth of arguments that can be
discerned or reconstructed from what he says. Some of the slave labour
Russell recommended has been done for at least a small selection of
Wittgenstein’s key arguments in §3 of the main Introduction. A sketch
has also been provided in §4 of the basic lines of thinking in the seven
main propositions, as well as in the sequences of the form n.m (and in
one case of a sequence of the form n.0m), not just to shed light on
these lines of thinking but also to encourage the reader to do the same
for every sequence at the lower levels (such as 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and
3.14). As emphasized in concluding §4, it is essential to recognize the
tree structure of the Tractatus and read it accordingly, beginning with
the top-level sequence 1–7 and working down to all the lower-level
sequences, which can be combined as one works down with a ‘straighter’
reading of the book. Nor does this preclude comparing remarks from
different places in the tree structure: other arrangements of
Wittgenstein’s remarks might be useful in answering or clarifying
particular questions. The key is to keep in mind the tree structure
throughout. The arguments can then be discerned and reconstructed.</p>
<p>The Tractatus, then, is not a text that can simply be read from
beginning to end, on the assumption that there is a linear argument, or
a set of linear arguments and sub-arguments, leading one to a conclusion
which is thereby proved. Indeed, part of the point of the penultimate
proposition 6.54 is to make us realize this, redirecting us to what has
gone before and making us rethink it all. In his preface Wittgenstein
wrote: ‘This book will perhaps be understood only by those who have
already thought the thoughts expressed in it themselves—or at any rate
similar thoughts. It is thus not a textbook.’ If a reader has not had
those thoughts, then they will have to be acquired on a first (or
subsequent) reading, helped by relevant ‘background’ reading, so that
understanding the book develops gradually. Its value can only be seen by
working through it. The Tractatus is not a textbook but an exercise
book: a text that has to be thought into a book for oneself.</p>

Introduction, Chronology, and Select Bibliography.</p>
<p>2 There are two main versions of these notes. The so-called Costello
version (which first appeared in the Journal of Philosophy in 1957) was
published in the first edition of the Notebooks (1961), but a version
closer to what Wittgenstein had actually dictated replaced it in the
second edition (1979). For a detailed account of these notes, of both
their textual history and their philosophical content, see Michael
Potter, Wittgenstein’s Notes on Logic (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2009).</p>
<p>3 The published notebooks cover the periods 9/8/1914 to 22/6/1915
(two notebooks) and 15/4/1916 to 10/1/1917 (one notebook). They also
contain a diary written mostly in code, published in 1991 (GT). There
were three, possibly four, additional wartime notebooks, which were
destroyed or are lost (see Georg von Wright, ‘The Origin of the
Tractatus’, in Wittgenstein (Oxford: Blackwell, 1982), §2; Brian
McGuinness, Wittgenstein: A Life. Young Ludwig 1889–1921 (London:
Duckworth, 1988), 212, 264–5).</p>
<p>4 An expanded version of von Wright’s introduction to this became
‘The Origin of the Tractatus’. The account that von Wright provided here
needs to be revised in the light of recent scholarship. See especially
Luciano Bazzocchi, ‘The “Prototractatus” Manuscript and its
Corrections’, in N. Venturinha (ed.), Wittgenstein after his Nachlass
(Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 11–29, and ‘A Better Appraisal
of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Manuscript’, Philosophical Investigations,
38.4 (2015), 333–59; Martin Pilch, ‘A Missing Folio at the Beginning of
Wittgenstein’s MS 104’, Nordic Wittgenstein Review, 4.2 (2015), 65–97.

<p>14 Wittgenstein was under the impression at the time that there was
more than one translator (not including either Ogden or Russell), and
the original plan may well have been to have had someone else assisting
Ramsey, although it was Ramsey alone who ended up doing the first draft
of the whole translation. For further details of this, see Cheryl Misak,
Frank Ramsey (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), 131.</p>
<p>15 One of these ‘supplements’ (no. 72) did indeed find its way into
the Tractatus: 4.0141, its decimal numbering indicating its
supplementary character (LO, p. 26). It does indeed help elucidate
Wittgenstein’s main idea at this point in the text, and it is to be
regretted that many more were not also incorporated.</p>

(London: Hutchinson, 1959), 17 n.</p>
<p>20 These remarks seem to have been taken, more or less word for word,
from a letter written by Russell to F. K. Ogden, C. K. Ogden’s brother,
on 21 November 1960 (Ogden died in 1957): I learn that questions have
arisen as to the authenticity and authority of the English version of
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. I know that this version was sanctioned point
by point by Wittgenstein. There are places where it is not an exact
translation of the German. When I pointed this out to him, he admitted
it, but said that the translation as it stood expressed what he wished
to say better than a more exact translation. It is, of course, open to
anybody to make a new translation in a more modern idiom, but it would
be misleading to suggest that such a translation gave a more exact
accurate rendering of Wittgenstein’s thought at the time than that which
was published. I say this from recollection of careful and minute
discussion with Wittgenstein as to what he wished the English version to
say. (Cited in LO, p. 10)</p>
<p>Presumably Russell had been asked by F. K. Ogden for this
information, which was then handed over to Haymon, C. K. Ogden’s friend
and literary executor. Given his concern with ‘authenticity’, it is
ironic that Haymon plagiarizes Russell without mentioning his source at
all. As to his ‘recollection’, Russell tended to creatively elaborate in
reporting on events in his past (as his autobiography shows), and may
have confused his meeting with Wittgenstein in The Hague before the
translation was even begun by Ramsey and a meeting he had with him in
August 1922 after Wittgenstein had sent back the proofs (see von
Wright’s comments in LO, pp. 10–11).</p>
<p>21 G. E. M. Anscombe, An Introduction to Wittgenstein’s Tractatus,
4th edn. (London: Hutchinson, 1971), 17.</p>
<p>22 In my view, Ramsey did an excellent job as Ogden’s ‘assistant’ in
producing a very competent first draft, and it was Ogden’s
responsibility, especially in taking credit for the translation, to
polish it up into something more fluent. Perhaps his own views about
language contributed to his not doing so. Ogden was to play a leading
role in the Basic English movement, which suggests that he was less
concerned with the nuances of ordinary language than with simply getting
the message across. And in any case, he wanted the book published as
soon as possible, to help launch his new series: the International
Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method. 1922 saw its
first five titles, one of them the Tractatus.</p>

<p>Tractatus</p>
<p>Logico-Philosophicus</p>
<p>Dedicated</p>
<p>to the memory of my friend</p>
<p>David H. Pinsent</p>
<p>Motto:…and everything one knows, not merely heard as rumbling and
roaring, can be said in three words.</p>
<p>Kürnberger*</p>
<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This book will perhaps be understood only by someone who has already
thought the thoughts expressed in it themselves—or at any rate similar
thoughts. It is thus not a textbook. Its purpose would be achieved if it
gave pleasure to one person who read it with understanding.</p>
<p>The book treats the problems of philosophy and shows—I believe—that
the posing of these problems rests on misunderstanding the logic of our
language. The whole sense of the book might be captured in these words:
what can be said at all can be said clearly; and of what one cannot
talk, about that one must be silent.*</p>
<p>The book thus aims to draw a limit to thinking, or rather, not to
thinking but to the expression of thoughts: for to draw a limit to
thinking, we would have to be able to think both sides of this limit
(that is, we would have to be able to think what cannot be thought).</p>
<p>The limit will thus only be drawable in language and what lies on the
other side of the limit will simply be nonsense.</p>
<p>How far my efforts coincide with those of other philosophers I have
no wish to judge. What I have written here makes no claim at all to
novelty in detail; and the reason I give no references is that I am not
concerned with whether what I have thought has already been thought by
someone else before me.</p>
<p>I only want to mention that I am indebted to the magnificent works of
Frege and the writings of my friend Mr Bertrand Russell for a large part
of the stimulation of my thoughts.</p>
<p>If this work has a value, then it consists in two things. First, in
that thoughts are expressed in it, and this value will be greater the
better the thoughts are expressed, the more the nail has been hit on the
head.—Here I am conscious that I have fallen far short of what is
possible, simply because my powers are too weak to accomplish the
task.—May others come and do it better.</p>
<p>On the other hand it seems to me that the truth of the thoughts
conveyed here is unassailable and definitive. I am thus of the view that
the problems in essence have been finally solved. And if I am not
mistaken in this, then the value of this work consists, secondly, in
showing how little is done when these problems are solved.</p>

<h4 id="the-world-is-everything-that-is-the-case.">1* The world is
everything that is the case.</h4>
<pre><code>1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.

    1.11 The world is determined by the facts and by their being all the facts.

    1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case as well as everything that is not the case.

    1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.

1.2 The world divides into facts.

    1.21 Something can be the case or not the case and everything else remain the same.</code></pre>
<h4 id="what-is-the-case-a-fact-is-the-obtaining-of-states-of-things.">2
What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things.*</h4>
<pre><code>    2.01 A state-of-things is a combination of objects (entities, things).*</code></pre>
<p>2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent of a
state-of-things.</p>
<p>2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a
state-of-things, then the possibility of the state-of-things must
already be prefigured* in the thing.</p>
<p>2.0121 It would appear as an accident, as it were, if a state of
affairs were subsequently to fit a thing that could exist in and by
itself.</p>
<pre><code>If things can occur in states-of-things, then this possibility must already lie in them.

(What is logical cannot be merely possible. Logic deals with every possibility and all possibilities are its facts.)

Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at all outside space, or temporal objects outside time, so we cannot think of any object outside the possibility of its combination with other objects.

If I can think of an object in the context of a state-of-things, then I cannot think of it outside the possibility of this context.</code></pre>
<p>2.0122 A thing is independent insofar as it can occur in all possible
states of affairs, but this form of independence is a form of connection
with a state-of-things, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for
words to appear in two different ways, on their own and in a
proposition.*)</p>
<p>2.0123 If I know* an object, then I also know all the possibilities
of its occurrence in states-of-things.</p>
<pre><code> (Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)

 A new possibility cannot be found subsequently.</code></pre>
<p>2.01231 To know an object, I do not need to know its external
properties—but I must know all its internal properties.</p>
<p>2.0124 If all objects are given, then all possible states-of-things
are thereby also given.</p>
<p>2.013 Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible
states-of-things. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the
thing without the space.</p>
<p>2.0131 A spatial object must lie in infinite space. (A spatial point
is an argument-place.)</p>
<pre><code> A spot in the visual field need not be red, but it must have some colour: it has, so to speak, a colour space around it. A sound must have some pitch, an object of touch some hardness, and so on.</code></pre>
<p>2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all states of affairs.*</p>
<p>2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in states-of-things is the
form of an object.</p>
<pre><code>    2.02 An object is simple.*</code></pre>
<p>2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a
statement about their constituents and into those propositions that
describe the complexes completely.</p>
<p>2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. That is why they
cannot be composite.</p>
<p>2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had
sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.</p>
<p>2.0212 It would then be impossible to draw up a picture of the world
(true or false).</p>
<p>2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however different from
the real world it may be, must have something—a form—in common with the
real world.</p>
<p>2.023 This fixed form consists simply of the objects.</p>
<p>2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form and not
any material properties. For these are only represented* by
propositions—only formed by the configuration of objects.</p>
<p>2.0232 Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.</p>
<p>2.0233 Two objects of the same logical form—aside from their external
properties—are only distinguished from one another in that they are
different.</p>
<p>2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in which
case one can single it out from others straightaway by a description and
refer to it;* or, instead, there are several things that have all their
properties in common, in which case it is quite impossible to point to
one of them.</p>
<pre><code>For if a thing is not distinguished by anything, then I cannot distinguish it, for otherwise it would be distinguished.</code></pre>
<p>2.024 Substance is what subsists* independently of what is the
case.</p>
<p>2.025 It is form and content.</p>
<p>2.0251 Space, time and colour (colouration) are forms of objects.</p>
<p>2.026 Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the
world.</p>
<p>2.027 The fixed, the subsistent* and the object are one.</p>
<p>2.0271 The object is the fixed, the subsistent; the configuration is
the changing, the inconstant.*</p>
<p>2.0272 The configuration of objects forms the state-of-things.</p>
<pre><code>    2.03 In a state-of-things the objects hang in one another, like the links of a chain.</code></pre>
<p>2.031 In a state-of-things the objects stand to one another in a
determinate way.*</p>
<p>2.032 The way in which the objects connect* in a state-of-things is
the structure of the state-of-things.</p>
<p>2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.</p>
<p>2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the
states-of-things.</p>
<pre><code>    2.04 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things is the world.

    2.05 The totality of the obtaining states-of-things also determines which states-of-things do not obtain.

    2.06 The obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things is reality.

 (The obtaining of states-of-things we also call a positive, the non-obtaining a negative fact.)</code></pre>
<p>2.061 States-of-things are independent of one another.</p>
<p>2.062 From the obtaining or non-obtaining of a state-of-things, the
obtaining or non-obtaining of another cannot be inferred.</p>
<p>2.063 The totality of reality is the world.</p>
<h4 id="we-picture-facts.">2.1 We picture facts.*</h4>
<pre><code>    2.11 A picture presents* a state of affairs in logical space, the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.

    2.12 A picture is a model of reality.

    2.13 In a picture, the elements of the picture correspond to the objects.</code></pre>
<p>2.131 In a picture, the elements of the picture stand for the
objects.</p>
<pre><code>    2.14 A picture consists in its elements standing to one another* in a determinate way.</code></pre>
<p>2.141 A picture is a fact.</p>
<pre><code>    2.15 That the elements of a picture stand to one another in a determinate way presents* that things stand to one another in this way.

 This connection of the elements of a picture may be called its structure, and the possibility of this structure its form of depiction.</code></pre>
<p>2.151 The form of depiction is the possibility that things stand to
one another in the same way as the elements of the picture do.</p>
<p>2.1511 It is in this way that a picture is connected* to reality; it
reaches up to it.</p>
<p>2.1512 It is laid against reality like a measure.</p>
<p>2.15121 Only the outermost points of the dividing lines touch the
object to be measured.</p>
<p>2.1513 On this conception, the depicting relation that makes it a
picture thus also belongs to the picture.</p>
<p>2.1514 The depicting relation consists of the correlations of the
elements of the picture and the things.*</p>
<p>2.1515 These correlations are, as it were, the feelers* of the
picture’s elements with which the picture touches reality.</p>
<pre><code>    2.16 To be a picture, a fact must have something in common with what is depicted.</code></pre>
<p>2.161 There must be something identical in picture and depicted if
the one is to be capable of being a picture of the other at all.</p>
<pre><code>    2.17 What a picture must have in common with reality to be able to depict it in the way it does—correctly or incorrectly—is its form of depiction.</code></pre>
<p>2.171 A picture can depict any reality whose form it has.</p>
<pre><code> A spatial picture anything spatial, a coloured anything coloured, etc.</code></pre>
<p>2.172 A picture cannot depict, however, its form of depiction; it
features it.*</p>
<p>2.173 A picture represents its object from outside (its standpoint is
its form of representation); this is why a picture represents its object
correctly or incorrectly.</p>
<p>2.174 A picture cannot, however, place itself outside its form of
representation.</p>
<pre><code>    2.18 What any picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality to be able to depict it at all—correctly or incorrectly—is logical form, that is, the form of reality.</code></pre>
<p>2.181 If the form of depiction is logical form, then the picture is a
logical picture.</p>
<p>2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (On the other hand,
not every picture is a spatial picture, for example.)</p>

space.</p>
<p>2.203 A picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs that
it represents.</p>
<pre><code>    2.21 A picture agrees with reality or not; it is correct or incorrect, true or false.

    2.22 A picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsity, through its form of depiction.</code></pre>
<p>2.221 What a picture represents is its sense.</p>
<p>2.222 Its truth or falsity consists in the agreement or disagreement
of its sense with reality.</p>
<p>2.223 To tell* whether a picture is true or false, we must compare it
with reality.</p>
<p>2.224 It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is
true or false.</p>
<p>2.225 No picture is true a priori.</p>
<h4 id="a-logical-picture-of-facts-is-a-thought.">3 A logical picture of
facts is a thought.</h4>
<p>3.001 ‘A state-of-things is thinkable’ means: we can picture it.*</p>
<pre><code>    3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.

    3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs that is thought. What is thinkable is also possible.

    3.03 We cannot think anything illogical, since otherwise we would have to think illogically.</code></pre>
<p>3.031 It was once said that God could create anything except what was
contrary to the laws of logic.—In truth, we could not say of an
‘illogical’ world how it would look.</p>
<p>3.032 Something that ‘contradicts logic’ cannot be represented in
language any more than, in geometry, a figure that contradicts the laws
of space can be represented by its coordinates, or the coordinates can
be specified of a point that does not exist.</p>
<p>3.0321 We can certainly represent a state-of-things spatially that
contravenes the laws of physics but not one that contravenes the laws of
geometry.</p>
<pre><code>    3.04 An a priori correct thought would be one whose possibility ensured its truth.

    3.05 We could only know a priori that a thought is true if its truth could be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).</code></pre>
<h4 id="in-a-proposition-a-thought-is-expressed-perceptibly.">3.1 In a
proposition a thought is expressed perceptibly.*</h4>
<pre><code>    3.11 We use the perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of a possible state of affairs.

 The method of projection is the thinking of the proposition’s sense.

    3.12 I call the sign by means of which we express a thought a propositional sign. And a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.*

    3.13 To the proposition belongs everything that belongs to the projection, but not what is projected.

 Thus the possibility of what is projected, but not what is projected itself.

 In a proposition its sense is thus not yet contained, but it does contain the possibility of expressing it.*

 (‘The content of a proposition’ means the content of a senseful proposition.*)

 In a proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.

    3.14 A propositional sign consists in this, that its elements, the words, stand to one another in it in a determinate way.

 A propositional sign is a fact.</code></pre>
<p>3.141 A proposition is not a mixture of words.—(Just as a musical
theme is not a mixture of notes.)</p>
<pre><code> A proposition is articulate.</code></pre>
<p>3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a set of names cannot.</p>
<p>3.143 That a propositional sign is a fact is disguised by the
ordinary—written or printed—form of expression.</p>
<pre><code> For in a printed proposition, for example, a propositional sign does not look essentially different from a word.

 (Thus it was possible for Frege to call a proposition a composite name.)</code></pre>
<p>3.1431 The essence of a propositional sign becomes very clear if we
think of it as composed of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs,
books) instead of written signs.The relative spatial position of these
things then expresses the sense of the proposition.</p>
<p>3.1432 Not: “The complex sign ‘aRb’ says that a stands in the
relation R to b”; but: That ‘a’ stands in a certain relation to ‘b’ says
that aRb.</p>

In a proposition a thought can be so expressed that to the objects of
the thought correspond elements of the propositional sign.</h4>
<p>3.201 I call these elements ‘simple signs’ and the proposition
‘completely analysed’.</p>
<p>3.202 The simple signs applied in the proposition are called
names.</p>
<p>3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning.* (‘A’ is the
same sign as ‘A’.)</p>
<pre><code>    3.21 The configuration of simple signs in a propositional sign corresponds to the configuration of objects in a state of affairs.

    3.22 A name in a proposition stands for an object.</code></pre>
<p>3.221 Objects I can only name. Signs stand for them. I can only speak
of them, I cannot state them.* A proposition can only say how a thing
is, not what it is.</p>
<pre><code>    3.23 The demand that simple signs be possible is the demand that sense be determinate.*

    3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in an internal relation to a proposition about one of its constituents.

 A complex can only be given by its description, and this will be right or not right. A proposition that mentions a complex will not be nonsensical but simply false if the complex does not exist.

 That a propositional element signifies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We know that not everything is determined by any such proposition. (The generality-sign contains a prototype.*)

 The contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simple symbol can be expressed by a definition.

    3.25 There is one and only one complete analysis of a proposition.</code></pre>
<p>3.251 A proposition expresses what it expresses in a determinate,
clearly specifiable way: a proposition is articulate.</p>
<pre><code>    3.26 A name cannot be dissected further by any definition: it is a primitive sign.</code></pre>
<p>3.261 Every defined sign signifies via those signs by which it is
defined; and the definitions point the way.</p>
<pre><code> Two signs, one primitive sign and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names cannot be unpacked* by definitions. (Nor any sign that has a meaning by itself, independently.)</code></pre>
<p>3.262 What does not get expressed in the signs, their application
shows. What the signs hold back, their application spells out.*</p>
<p>3.263 The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by
elucidations. Elucidations are propositions that contain the primitive
signs. They can therefore only be understood if the meanings of these
signs are already known.</p>

Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition does
a name have meaning.*</h4>
<pre><code>    3.31 Every part of a proposition that characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).

 (The proposition itself is an expression.)

 Expression is everything essential to the sense of a proposition that propositions can have in common with one another.

 An expression marks a form and a content.</code></pre>
<p>3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in
which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of
propositions.</p>
<p>3.312 It is thus represented by the general form of the propositions
that it characterizes.</p>
<pre><code> That is to say, in this form the expression will be constant and everything else variable.</code></pre>
<p>3.313 An expression is thus represented by a variable whose values
are the propositions that contain the expression.</p>
<pre><code> (In the limiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression a proposition.)

 I call such a variable a ‘propositional variable’.</code></pre>
<p>3.314 An expression only has meaning in a proposition. Every variable
can be construed as a propositional variable.</p>
<pre><code> (Even a variable name.)</code></pre>
<p>3.315 If we change a constituent of a proposition into a variable,
then there is a class of propositions that are all the values of the
resulting variable proposition. This class still depends in general on
what we mean,* according to our arbitrary conventions, by parts of the
original proposition. However, if we change into variables all those
signs whose meaning was arbitrarily determined, then there is still such
a class. But this is not now dependent on any convention, only on the
nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical form—a logical
prototype.</p>
<p>3.316 What values a propositional variable may take is fixed.</p>
<pre><code> The fixing of the values is the variable.*</code></pre>
<p>3.317 The fixing of the values of propositional variables is the
specification of the propositions whose common mark is the variable.</p>
<pre><code> The fixing is a description of these propositions.

 The fixing will thus be a matter only of symbols, not of their meaning.

 And only this is essential to the fixing, that it is only a description of symbols and states nothing about what is signified.

 The way in which the propositions are described is inessential.</code></pre>
<p>3.318 I construe a proposition—like Frege and Russell—as a function
of the expressions contained in it.</p>
<pre><code>    3.32 A sign is what can be perceived of the symbol.</code></pre>
<p>3.321 Two different symbols can thus have a sign (written or spoken,
etc.) in common with one another—they then signify in different
ways.</p>
<p>3.322 It can never indicate a common mark of two objects that we
signify them by the same sign but through two different modes of
signification. For the sign, of course, is arbitrary. Two different
signs could just as well be chosen, and what would then remain of
something common in the signification?</p>
<p>3.323 In everyday language it occurs extremely often that the same
word signifies in different ways—that is, belongs to different
symbols—or that two words, which signify in different ways, are applied
in a proposition in ostensibly the same way.</p>
<pre><code> Thus the word ‘is’ appears as a copula, as an identity sign, and as an expression of existence;* ‘exist’ as an intransitive verb like ‘go’; ‘identical’ as an adjective; we talk of something, but also say that something happens.

 (In the proposition ‘Green is green’—where the first word is a person’s name, the last an adjective—these words do not simply have different meaning but involve different symbols.)</code></pre>
<p>3.324 Thus the most fundamental confusions easily arise (of which the
whole of philosophy is full).</p>
<p>3.325 To avoid these errors, we must use a sign-language that
excludes them, by not using the same sign in different symbols, and not
using signs that signify in different ways in ostensibly the same way. A
sign-language, that is, that obeys logical grammar—logical syntax.</p>
<pre><code> (Frege’s and Russell’s concept-script* is one such language, though it still fails to exclude all mistakes.)</code></pre>
<p>3.326 To recognize the symbol by its sign, one must pay attention to
the senseful use.*</p>
<p>3.327 A sign determines a logical form only together with its
logical-syntactic use.</p>
<p>3.328 If a sign is not needed, then it is meaningless. That is the
point of Occam’s razor.*</p>
<pre><code> (If everything in the sign-language works as though a sign had meaning, then it does have meaning.*)

    3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role; it must permit being drawn up without talk of the meaning of a sign; it should presuppose only the description of the expressions.</code></pre>
<p>3.331 This remark gives us insight into Russell’s ‘theory of types’:*
Russell’s error is shown in his having to talk of the meaning of signs
in drawing up the rules for them.</p>
<p>3.332 No proposition can state anything about itself, since a
propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is all there is
to the ‘theory of types’).</p>
<p>3.333 That is why a function cannot be its own argument, since the
function sign already contains the prototype of its argument and thus
cannot contain itself.</p>
<pre><code> For let us suppose that the function F( fx) could be its own argument; there would then be a proposition ‘F(F( fx))’, and in this the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, for the inner has the form ϕ( fx), the outer the form ψ(ϕ( fx)). The two functions only have in common the letter ‘F’, but this by itself signifies nothing.

 This becomes immediately clear if, instead of ‘F(F(u)’, we write ‘(∃ϕ):F(ϕ u).ϕ u=Fu’.

 This resolves Russell’s paradox.</code></pre>
<p>3.334 The rules of logical syntax must be self-explanatory,* once it
is known how every single sign signifies.</p>
<pre><code>    3.34 A proposition has essential and accidental features.

 Accidental are the features that arise from the particular way that the propositional sign is generated. Essential are those that enable the proposition to express its sense.</code></pre>
<p>3.341 The essential in a proposition is thus what all propositions
that can express the same sense have in common.</p>
<pre><code> And so too, in general, the essential in a symbol is what all symbols that can fulfil the same purpose have in common.</code></pre>
<p>3.3411 So one could say: the real name is what all symbols that can
signify an object have in common. It would thus progressively turn out
that no kind of composition is essential to a name.*</p>
<p>3.342 In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but this
is not arbitrary: that when we have determined something arbitrarily,
then something else must be the case. (This arises from the essence of
notation.)</p>
<p>3.3421 A particular mode of signification may be unimportant, but it
is always important that this is a possible mode of signification. And
this is how it is generally in philosophy: the particular proves time
and again to be unimportant, but the possibility of each particular
tells us something about the essence of the world.</p>
<p>3.343 Definitions are rules for translating from one language into
another. Every correct sign-language must be translatable into every
other according to such rules: this is what they all have in common.</p>
<p>3.344 What signifies in a symbol is what is common to all those
symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical
syntax.</p>
<p>3.3441 One can express, for example, what is common to all notations
for truth-functions thus: they have in common that they can all be
replaced—for example—by the notation that uses ‘~p’ (‘not-p’) and ‘p v
q’ (‘p or q’).(This typifies the way in which a specific possible
notation can tell us something general.)</p>
<p>3.3442 The sign for a complex, too, is not resolved arbitrarily in
analysis, so that, say, its resolution might be different in every
propositional structure.*</p>

<p>3.5 A propositional sign as applied in thinking is a thought.</p>
<h4 id="a-thought-is-a-senseful-proposition.">4 A thought is a senseful
proposition.</h4>
<p>4.001 The totality of propositions is language.</p>
<p>4.002 Human beings possess the ability to construct languages in
which every sense can be expressed, without having any idea of how and
what each word means.—Just as one speaks without knowing how the
individual sounds are produced.</p>
<pre><code> Everyday language is a part of the human organism and no less complicated than it.

 It is humanly impossible to immediately gather from it the logic of language.

 Language disguises thought. And in such a way that the form of the thought that is clothed cannot be inferred from the outer form of the clothing, because the outer form of the clothing is designed for quite other purposes than to allow the form of the body to be recognized.*

 The tacit agreements underlying the understanding of everyday language are enormously complicated.</code></pre>
<p>4.003 Most of the propositions and questions that have been
formulated about philosophical matters are not false but nonsensical. So
we cannot answer questions of this kind at all, but only expose their
nonsensicality. Most of philosophers’ questions and propositions are due
to our not understanding the logic of our language.</p>
<pre><code> (They are of the same kind as the question whether the good is more or less identical than the beautiful.)

 And it is no wonder that the deepest problems are really not problems.</code></pre>
<p>4.0031 All philosophy is ‘critique of language’. (Albeit not in
Mauthner’s sense.*) Russell’s merit is to have shown that the apparent
logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.</p>
<pre><code>    4.01 A proposition is a picture of reality.

 A proposition is a model of reality as we conceive it.*</code></pre>
<p>4.011 At first sight a proposition—as printed out on paper, say—does
not appear to be a picture of the reality it concerns. But neither does
musical notation appear at first sight to be a picture of music, nor our
phonetic (alphabetic) notation a picture of our spoken language.</p>
<pre><code> And yet these sign-languages* prove to be pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.</code></pre>
<p>4.012 It is obvious we have a sense of a proposition of the form
‘aRb’ as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of what is
signified.</p>
<p>4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictoriality, then
we see that this is not confounded by apparent irregularities (as in the
use of ♯ and ♭ in musical notation).</p>
<pre><code> For these irregularities, too, depict what they are intended to express, just in a different way.</code></pre>
<p>4.014 A gramophone record, the musical thought, the musical notation,
the sound waves, all stand to one another in that internal relation of
depicting that holds between language and world.</p>
<pre><code> Common to all of them is the logical construction.

 (Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the fairy tale.* They are all in a certain sense one.)</code></pre>
<p>4.0141 That there is a general rule by which the musician can read
off the symphony from the score, and that there is a rule by which the
symphony can be reconstructed from the line on the gramophone record and
from this again—by means of the first rule—construct the score, is what
constitutes the internal similarity between these apparently very
different things. And this rule is the law of projection which projects
the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule for
translating this language into the language of the gramophone
record.*</p>
<p>4.015 The possibility of all similes, of the whole pictoriality of
our language,* lies in the logic of depiction.</p>
<p>4.016 To understand the essence of a proposition, consider
hieroglyphic script, which depicts the facts that it describes.</p>
<pre><code> And alphabetic script came out of it, without losing what is essential in depiction.

    4.02 We see this from our ability to understand the sense of a propositional sign without its having been explained to us.</code></pre>
<p>4.021 A proposition is a picture of reality: for I know the state of
affairs it represents if I understand the proposition. And I understand
the proposition without its sense having been explained to me.</p>
<p>4.022 A proposition shows its sense.</p>
<pre><code> A proposition shows how things stand if it is true. And it says that they so stand.*</code></pre>
<p>4.023 Reality must be fixed by a proposition to elicit either yes or
no.*</p>
<pre><code> To do this, it must be completely described by the proposition.

 A proposition is a description of a state-of-things.

 Like the description of an object by its external properties, so a proposition describes reality by its internal properties.

 A proposition constructs a world by means of a logical scaffolding and that is how one can actually see in the proposition all the logical features of reality if it is true.* One can draw inferences from a false proposition.</code></pre>
<p>4.024 To understand a proposition is to know what is the case if it
is true.</p>
<pre><code> (One can thus understand it without knowing whether it is true.)

 One understands it if one understands its constituents.</code></pre>
<p>4.025 The translation of one language into another does not proceed
by translating every proposition of one into a proposition of another,
but only the constituents of the proposition are translated.*</p>
<pre><code> (And the dictionary translates not only substantives but also verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions, etc.; and it treats them all alike.)</code></pre>
<p>4.026 The meanings of simple signs (words) must be explained to us
for us to understand them.</p>
<pre><code> With propositions, however, we communicate.*</code></pre>
<p>4.027 It is essential to a proposition that it can convey a new sense
to us.</p>
<pre><code>    4.03 A proposition must convey a new sense with old expressions.

 A proposition conveys a state of affairs to us, and hence must connect essentially to the state of affairs.

 And the connection is precisely that it is its logical picture.

 A proposition only states something insofar as it is a picture.</code></pre>
<p>4.031 In a proposition a state of affairs is put together
experimentally, as it were.</p>
<pre><code> Saying that this proposition has such and such a sense is really saying that this proposition represents such and such a state of affairs.</code></pre>
<p>4.0311 One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, and
they are combined with one another; in this way the whole—like a tableau
vivant—presents a state-of-things.*</p>
<p>4.0312 The possibility of a proposition rests on the principle of the
representation of objects by signs.</p>
<pre><code> My fundamental thought is that the ‘logical constants’ do not represent. That the logic of facts cannot be represented.*</code></pre>
<p>4.032 A proposition is a picture of a state of affairs only insofar
as it is logically articulated.</p>
<pre><code> (The proposition ‘ambulo’ is composite, too, since its stem with a different ending and its ending with a different stem yield different senses.)

    4.04 In a proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as in the state of affairs it represents.

 The two must have the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity. (Compare Hertz’s Mechanics, on Dynamic Models.)*</code></pre>
<p>4.041 This mathematical multiplicity, of course, cannot in its turn
be depicted. One cannot get outside it in depiction.</p>
<p>4.0411 Trying to express, for example, what we express by ‘(x).fx’ by
putting an index before ‘fx’—as in ‘Gen.fx’—wouldn’t work: we would not
know what was being generalized. Trying to register it by an index
‘g’—as in ‘f (xg)’—wouldn’t work either: we would not know the scope of
the generality-sign.</p>
<pre><code> Trying to do it by introducing a mark in the argument-places—as in ‘(G, G).F(G, G)’—wouldn’t work: we could not determine* the identity of the variables. And so on.

 All these modes of signification do not work because they do not have the necessary mathematical multiplicity.</code></pre>
<p>4.0412 For the same reason the idealist’s explanation of the seeing
of spatial relations via ‘spatial spectacles’ doesn’t work, because it
cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.</p>
<pre><code>    4.05 Reality is compared with a proposition.

    4.06 A proposition can be true or false only by being a picture of reality.</code></pre>
<p>4.061 If one does not bear in mind that a proposition has a sense
that is independent of the facts, then one can easily suppose that true
and false are relations between sign and what is signified that are on
an equal footing.</p>
<pre><code> One could then say, for example, that ‘p’ signifies in the true way what ‘~p’ signifies in the false way, etc.</code></pre>
<p>4.062 Can’t we communicate with false propositions as we have done up
to now with true ones? So long as we know that they are meant to be
false. No! For a proposition is true if things are as we say they are by
using it; and if we mean ~p by ‘p’, and things are as we mean it, then
‘p’ in the new conception is true and not false.</p>
<p>4.0621 However, it is important that the signs ‘p’ and ‘~p’ can say
the same. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign
‘~’.</p>
<pre><code> The occurrence of negation in a proposition is not necessarily a mark of its sense (~~p = p).

 The propositions ‘p’ and ‘~p’ have opposite sense, but one and the same reality corresponds to them.</code></pre>
<p>4.063 A picture to explain the concept of truth: black spot on white
paper; the form of the spot can be described by stating for each point
of the surface whether it is white or black. The fact that a point is
black corresponds to a positive fact, that a point is white (not black)
to a negative fact. If I signify a point of the surface (a Fregean
truth-value*), then this corresponds to the supposition that is put up
for judgement, etc. etc.</p>
<pre><code> However, to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know when a point is called black and when white; to be able to say that ‘p’ is true (or false), I must have determined under what circumstances I call ‘p’ true, and I thereby determine the sense of the proposition.

 The point at which the analogy breaks down is now this: we can indicate a point on the paper without even knowing what white and black are; but nothing at all corresponds to a proposition without sense, since it does not signify a thing (truth-value) whose properties are called, say, ‘false’ or ‘true’; the verb of a proposition is not ‘is true’ or ‘is false’—as Frege supposed—but that which is ‘true’ must already contain the verb.</code></pre>
<p>4.064 Every proposition must already have sense; affirmation cannot
give it sense, for what is affirmed is precisely its sense. And the same
holds for negation, etc.</p>
<p>4.0641 One could say: negation already relates to the logical place
that the negated proposition determines.</p>
<pre><code> The negating proposition determines a different logical place than the negated does.

 The negating proposition determines a logical place by means of the logical place of the negated proposition in describing the former as lying outside the latter.

 That the negated proposition can again be negated alone shows that what is negated is already a proposition and not just the preliminary to a proposition.</code></pre>

<pre><code>    4.12 A proposition can represent the whole of reality, but it cannot represent what it must have in common with reality to be able to represent it—the logical form.

 To be able to represent the logical form, we would have to be able to position ourselves with a proposition outside logic, that is, outside the world.</code></pre>
<p>4.121 A proposition cannot represent the logical form; the logical
form mirrors itself in the proposition.</p>
<pre><code> What mirrors itself in language, language cannot represent.

 What expresses itself in language we cannot express by means of language.

 It features it.*</code></pre>

same object.If two propositions contradict one another, then their

on.</p>
<p>4.1212 What can be shown cannot be said.</p>
<p>4.1213 Now we understand, too, our feeling that we are in possession
of a correct logical conception once everything is in order in our
sign-language.</p>
<p>4.122 We can talk in a certain sense of formal properties of objects
and states-of-things, or of properties of the structure of facts, and in
the same sense of formal relations and relations of structures.</p>
<pre><code> (Instead of ‘property of a structure’ I also say ‘internal property’; instead of ‘relation of structures’ ‘internal relation’.

 I introduce these expressions to show the ground of the widespread confusion among philosophers between internal relations and real (external) relations.)

 The obtaining of such internal properties and relations, however, cannot be asserted by means of propositions, but shows itself in the propositions that represent the relevant states-of-things and concern the relevant objects.</code></pre>
<p>4.1221 An internal property of a fact we can also call a feature of
the fact. (In the sense in which we speak, say, of facial features.)</p>
<p>4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object
does not have it.</p>
<pre><code> (This blue colour and that one stand in the internal relation of lighter and darker eo ipso. It is unthinkable that these two objects should not stand in this relation.)

 (Here to the shifting use of the words ‘property’ and ‘relation’ there corresponds the shifting use of the word ‘object’.)</code></pre>
<p>4.124 The obtaining of an internal property of a possible state of
affairs is not expressed by a proposition, but expresses itself in the
proposition that represents the state of affairs by an internal property
of the proposition.</p>
<pre><code> It would be just as nonsensical to ascribe a formal property to a proposition as to deny its ascription.</code></pre>
<p>4.1241 Forms cannot be distinguished from one another by saying that
one has this and another has that property, since this presupposes that
it makes sense to predicate the two properties to the two forms.</p>
<p>4.125 The obtaining of an internal relation between possible states
of affairs expresses itself linguistically by an internal relation
between the propositions that represent them.</p>
<p>4.1251 This resolves the dispute ‘whether all relations are internal
or external’.</p>
<p>4.1252 Series that are ordered by internal relations I call
form-series.</p>
<pre><code>The number series is ordered not by an external but by an internal relation.

Just as in the series of propositions‘aRb’,‘(∃x):aRx.xRb’,‘(∃x,y):aRx.xRy.yRb’,and so forth.(If b stands in one of these relations to a, then I call b a successor of a.)</code></pre>
<p>4.126 In the sense in which we speak of formal properties, we can
also talk of formal concepts.</p>
<pre><code> (I introduce this expression to make clear the ground of the confusion of formal concepts with real concepts, which pervades the whole of the old logic.)

 That something falls under a formal concept, as one of its objects, cannot be expressed by a proposition. Rather, it shows itself in the sign for the object itself. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a numerical sign that it signifies a number, etc.)

 Formal concepts, unlike real concepts,* cannot be represented by a function.

 For its marks, the formal properties, are not expressed by functions.

 The expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.

 The sign of the marks of a formal concept is thus a characteristic feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the concept.

 The expression of a formal concept is thus a propositional variable, in which only this characteristic feature is constant.</code></pre>
<p>4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and
its values signify the objects that fall under the concept.</p>
<p>4.1271 Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.For every
variable represents a constant form that all its values have, and which
can be taken as a formal property of these values.</p>
<p>4.1272 The variable name ‘x’ is thus the real sign of the
pseudo-concept* object.Wherever the word ‘object’ (‘thing’, ‘entity’,
etc.) is correctly used, it is expressed in a concept-script by a
variable name.For example, in the proposition ‘There are 2 objects
which…’ by ‘(∃x,y)…’.Wherever it is used differently, that is, as a real
concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions arise.So one cannot say,
for example, ‘There are objects’ as one might say ‘There are books’. Nor
is ‘There are 100 objects’ or ‘There are ℵ0 objects’ any better.And it
is nonsensical to speak of the number of all objects.The same applies to
the words ‘complex’, ‘fact’, ‘function’, ‘number’, etc.They all signify
formal concepts and are represented in a concept-script by variables,
not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell held).Expressions such
as ‘1 is a number’, ‘there is only one zero’ and the like are
nonsensical.(It is just as nonsensical to say ‘There is only one 1’ as
it would be to say ‘2 + 2 at 3 o’clock equals 4’.)</p>
<p>4.12721 A formal concept is already given with an object that falls
under it. So one cannot introduce as primitive ideas* the objects of a
formal concept and the formal concept itself. So one cannot, for
example, introduce as primitive ideas the concept of a function as well
as specific functions (as Russell does), or the concept of number and
particular numbers.</p>
<p>4.1273 If we want to express the general proposition ‘b is a
successor of a’ in a concept-script, then we need for this an expression
for the general term of the form-series:</p>
<p>The general term of a form-series can only be expressed by a
variable, since the concept ‘term of this form-series’ is a formal
concept. (Frege and Russell overlooked this: the way in which they want
to express general propositions such as the above is therefore false; it
contains a vicious circle.)</p>
<pre><code>We can determine the general term of a form-series by giving its first term and the general form of the operation that generates the next term from the preceding term.</code></pre>
<p>4.1274 The question as to the existence of a formal concept is
nonsensical. For no proposition can answer such a question.</p>
<pre><code>(So, for example, one cannot ask: ‘Are there unanalysable subject–predicate propositions?’)</code></pre>
<p>4.128 Logical forms are numberless.</p>

<pre><code>    4.21 The simplest proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the obtaining of a state-of-things.</code></pre>
<p>4.211 A sign of an elementary proposition is that no elementary
proposition can contradict it.</p>
<pre><code>    4.22 An elementary proposition consists of names. It is a connection, a concatenation, of names.</code></pre>
<p>4.221 It is obvious that, in the analysis of propositions, we must
arrive at elementary propositions, which consist of names in immediate
combination.</p>
<pre><code> This raises the question as to how the propositional unity* comes about.</code></pre>
<p>4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every fact
consists of infinitely many states-of-things and every state-of-things
is composed of infinitely many objects, there must still be objects and
states-of-things.</p>
<pre><code>    4.23 A name occurs in a proposition only in the context* of an elementary proposition.

    4.24 Names are the simple symbols; I indicate them by single letters (‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z’).

 I write an elementary proposition as a function of names in the form: ‘fx’, ‘ϕ(x, y)’, etc.

 Or I indicate it by the letters p, q, r.</code></pre>
<p>4.241 If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, then I
express this by placing the sign ‘=’ between them.</p>
<pre><code> ‘a = b’ thus means:* the sign ‘a’ is replaceable by the sign ‘b’.

 (If I introduce a new sign ‘b’ by an equation, by stipulating that it may replace an already known sign ‘a’, then (like Russell) I write the equation —definition—in the form ‘a = b Def.’. A definition is a rule for signs.)</code></pre>
<p>4.242 Expressions of the form ‘a = b’ are thus only representational
aids; they state nothing about the meaning of the signs ‘a’, ‘b’.</p>
<p>4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they
signify the same thing or two different things?—Can we understand a
proposition in which two names occur without knowing whether they mean
the same or different things?</p>
<pre><code> If I know, say, the meaning of an English word and a German word that means the same, then it is impossible for me not to know that they mean the same;* it is impossible that I cannot translate one into the other.

 Expressions such as ‘a = a’, or ones derived from them, are neither elementary propositions nor any other kind of senseful signs. (This will be shown later.)

    4.25 If an elementary proposition is true, then the state-of-things obtains; if an elementary proposition is false, then the state-of-things does not obtain.

    4.26 The specification of all true elementary propositions describes the world completely. The world is completely described by the specification of all elementary propositions plus the specification as to which of them are true and which false.

    4.27 With regard to the obtaining and non-obtaining of n states-of-things there are possibilities.

A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement with the
truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.</h4>
<pre><code>    4.41 The truth-possibilities of elementary propositions are the conditions of the truth and falsity of propositions.</code></pre>
<p>4.411 From the outset* it is likely that the introduction of
elementary propositions is fundamental to the understanding of all other
kinds of proposition. Indeed, the understanding of general propositions
depends palpably on that of elementary propositions.</p>
<pre><code>    4.42 With regard to the agreement and disagreement of a proposition with the truth-possibilities of n elementary propositions there are possibilities.

    4.43 We can express agreement with the truth-possibilities by correlating, say, the letter ‘T’ (‘true’) with them in the schema.

 Absence of this letter means disagreement.</code></pre>
<p>4.431 The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the
truth-possibilities of elementary propositions expresses the
truth-conditions of a proposition.</p>
<pre><code> A proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.

 (Frege was thus quite right in beginning with these in explaining the signs of his concept-script.* It is just that Frege’s explanation of the concept of truth is incorrect: If ‘the True’ and ‘the False’ were really objects and the arguments in ~p etc., then on Frege’s account, the sense of ‘~p’ would in no way be determined.)

    4.44 The sign that arises from correlating the letter ‘T’ with the truth-possibilities is a propositional sign.</code></pre>
<p>4.441 It is clear that no object (or complex of objects) corresponds
to the complex of the signs ‘F’ and ‘T’, any more than to the horizontal
and vertical lines or to brackets.—There are no ‘logical objects’.</p>
<pre><code> This holds similarly, of course, for all signs that express the same as the schemata of ‘T’ and ‘F’.</code></pre>
<p>4.442 This, for example, is a propositional sign:</p>
<pre><code> p q</code></pre>
<p>T T T</p>
<p>F T T</p>
<p>T F</p>
<p>F F T</p>
<pre><code>(Frege’s ‘judgement stroke’ ‘⊢’ is logically quite meaningless; it only indicates for Frege (and Russell) that they hold the propositions so signified to be true.* ‘⊢’ thus forms no part of propositional structure any more than does, say, a proposition’s number. It is impossible for a proposition to state of itself that it is true.)

 If the sequence of truth-possibilities in a schema is fixed once and for all by a rule of combination, then the last column by itself is an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column down as a row, then the propositional sign becomes: ‘(TT_T)(p,q)’ or better ‘(TTFT)(p,q)’.

 (The number of places in the left-hand brackets is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand.)

    4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups of truth-conditions.

 The groups of truth-conditions that pertain to the truth-possibilities of a number of elementary propositions can be ordered in a series.

    4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme cases.

 In one case the proposition is true for all the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth-conditions are tautologous.

 In the second case the proposition is false for all the truth-possibilities: the truth-conditions are contradictory.

 In the first case we call the proposition a tautology, in the second a contradiction.</code></pre>
<p>4.461 A proposition shows what it says, a tautology and a
contradiction show that they say nothing.</p>
<pre><code> A tautology has no truth-conditions, since it is true unconditionally; and a contradiction is true on no condition.

 Tautology and contradiction are senseless.

 (Like a point from which two arrows diverge in opposite directions.)

 (I know nothing about the weather, for example, when I know that it is raining or not raining.)</code></pre>
<p>4.4611 Tautology and contradiction, however, are not nonsensical;
they are part of the symbolism, just like ‘0’ is part of the symbolism
of arithmetic.</p>
<p>4.462 Tautology and contradiction are not pictures of reality. They
do not represent any possible state of affairs. For the former allows
every possible state of affairs, the latter none.</p>
<pre><code> In a tautology the conditions of agreement with the world—the representational relations—cancel one another out, so that it stands in no representational relation to reality.</code></pre>
<p>4.463 The truth-conditions determine the room that a proposition
leaves to the facts.</p>
<pre><code> (A proposition, a picture, a model are, in a negative sense, like a solid body that restricts the freedom of movement of another; in a positive sense, like the space limited by solid substance in which a body finds a place.)

 A tautology leaves open to reality the whole of—infinite—logical space; a contradiction fills the whole of logical space and leaves no point open to reality. Neither of them can therefore determine reality in any way.</code></pre>
<p>4.464 The truth of tautology is certain, of propositions possible, of
contradiction impossible.*</p>
<pre><code> (Certain, possible, impossible: here we have an indication of the gradation that we need in probability theory.)</code></pre>
<p>4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the
same as the proposition. This product is thus identical to the
proposition. For the essence of a symbol cannot be altered without
altering its sense.</p>
<p>4.466 To a determinate logical combination of signs corresponds a
determinate logical combination of their meanings; every arbitrary
combination only corresponds to uncombined signs.</p>
<pre><code> That is, propositions that are true for every state of affairs cannot be combinations of signs at all, since, if they were, only determinate combinations of objects could correspond to them.

 (And where there is no logical combination there is no corresponding combination of objects.)

 Tautology and contradiction are the limiting cases of the combination of symbols,* namely, their dissolution.</code></pre>
<p>4.4661 Admittedly, signs are combined with one another in tautology
and contradiction as well, i.e. they stand in relations to one another,
but these relations are meaningless, inessential to the symbol.</p>

a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.</h4>
<pre><code> It is clear that in the description of the most general propositional form only what is essential to it may be described—since otherwise it would not be the most general.

 That there is a general propositional form is demonstrated by this: that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (i.e. constructed). The general form of a proposition is: such and such is the case.*

    4.51 Suppose that I am given all elementary propositions; then the question arises as to what propositions I can form from them. And the answer is all propositions and this is how they are limited.

    4.52 Propositions are everything that follows from the totality of all elementary propositions (and also, of course, from its being the totality of all). (So, in a certain sense, one could say that all propositions are generalizations of elementary propositions.)

<pre><code> (An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)

    5.01 Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.

    5.02 It is easy to confuse the arguments of functions with the indices of names. For I recognize from both an argument and an index the meaning of the sign that contains them.

 In Russell’s ‘+c’, for example, ‘c’ is an index that indicates that the whole sign is the addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this designation rests on arbitrary convention and instead of ‘+c’ a simple sign could be chosen; in ‘~p’, however, ‘p’ is not an index but an argument: the sense of ‘~p’ cannot be understood without prior understanding of the sense of ‘p’. (In the name ‘Julius Caesar’ ‘Julius’ is an index. The index is always part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it. For example, the Caesar of the gens Julia.)

 The confusion of argument and index underlies, if I am not mistaken, Frege’s theory of the meaning of propositions and functions. For Frege the propositions of logic were names and their arguments the indices of these names.</code></pre>

another in one proposition; rather, these relations are internal and
obtain as soon as, and in virtue of, these propositions obtaining.</p>
<p>5.1311 If we infer q from p v q and ~p, then the relation between the
propositional forms of ‘p v q’ and ‘~p’ is here concealed by the mode of
signification. But if we write, for example, ‘p|q.|.p|q’ instead of ‘p v
q’ and ‘p|p’ instead of ‘~p’ (p|q =neither p nor q), then the inner
connection becomes manifest.(That fa can be inferred from (x).fx shows

<p>5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.</p>

 Contradiction is the outer limit of propositions, tautology the empty point at their centre.*

    5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition ‘r’, Trs the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition ‘s’ that are also truth-grounds of ‘r’, then we call the ratio Trs:Tr the measure of probability that the proposition ‘r’ gives to the proposition ‘s’.</code></pre>

<pre><code> This is therefore not a mathematical factum.*

 If I now say, ‘It is equally probable that I will draw a white as a black ball’, then this is to say, ‘All the circumstances known to me (including the laws of nature hypothetically assumed) give to the occurrence of the one event no more probability than to the occurrence of the other’. That is, they give to each—as is easily gathered from the explanations above—the probability ½.

 What I confirm by the experiment is that the occurrence of the two events is independent of the circumstances of which I know nothing further.</code></pre>
<p>5.155 The unit of a probability proposition is this: the

id="the-structures-of-propositions-stand-in-internal-relations-to-one-another.">5.2
The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one
another.</h4>
<pre><code>    5.21 We can bring out these internal relations in our mode of expression, by representing a proposition as the result of an operation that generates it from other propositions (the bases of the operation).

    5.22 An operation is the expression of a relation between the structures of its result and its bases.

    5.23 An operation is what must happen to a proposition to make another out of it.</code></pre>
<p>5.231 And that will depend, of course, on their formal properties, on
the internal similarity of their forms.</p>
<p>5.232 The internal relation that orders a series is equivalent to the
operation that generates one term from another.</p>
<p>5.233 An operation can only arise where a proposition is generated
from another in a logically significant way; that is, where the logical
construction of the proposition begins.</p>
<p>5.234 Truth-functions of elementary propositions are results of
operations that have the elementary propositions as bases. (I call these
operations truth-operations.)</p>
<p>5.2341 The sense of a truth-function of p is a function of the sense
of p.Negation, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc., etc., are
operations.(Negation reverses the sense of a proposition.)</p>
<pre><code>    5.24 An operation shows itself in a variable; it shows how one can get from one form of proposition to another.

 It gives expression to the difference between the forms.

 (And what is common to the bases and the result of the operation is precisely the bases.)</code></pre>
<p>5.241 An operation does not mark a form but only the difference
between forms.</p>
<p>5.242 The same operation that generates ‘q’ from ‘p’ also generates
‘r’ from ‘q’, and so forth. This can only be expressed by ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’,
etc. being variables that give expression in a general way to certain
formal relations.</p>
<pre><code>    5.25 The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of a proposition.

 For nothing is stated by the operation, only by its result, and this depends on the bases of the operation.

 (Operation and function must not be confused with one another.)</code></pre>
<p>5.251 A function cannot be its own argument, but the result of an
operation can certainly become its own base.</p>
<p>5.252 Only in this way is the progression possible from term to term
in a form-series (from type to type in Russell and Whitehead’s
hierarchies). (Russell and Whitehead did not admit the possibility of
this progression, but made use of it again and again.)</p>
<p>5.2521 The repeated application of an operation to its own result I
call its successive application (‘O’O’O’a’ is the result of three
successive applications of ‘O’ξ’ to ‘a’).In a similar sense I talk of
the successive application of several operations to a number of
propositions.</p>
<p>5.2522 The general term of a form-series a, O’a, O’O’a,…I thus write
as follows: ‘[a, x, O’x]’. This bracketed expression is a variable. The
first term of the bracketed expression is the beginning of the
form-series, the second the form of an arbitrary term x of the series,
and the third the form of the term of the series that immediately
follows x.</p>
<p>5.2523 The concept of the successive application of an operation is
equivalent to the concept ‘and so on’.</p>
<p>5.253 An operation can reverse the effect of another. Operations can
cancel one another.</p>
<p>5.254 An operation can vanish (for example, negation in ‘~~p’; ~~p =
p).</p>

id="all-propositions-are-results-of-truth-operations-on-elementary-propositions.">5.3
All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions.</h4>
<pre><code> A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from elementary propositions.

 It is of the essence of a truth-operation that, in the same way as elementary propositions give rise to their truth-function, truth-functions give rise to a new one. Every truth-operation generates, from truth-functions of elementary propositions, another truth-function of elementary propositions, a proposition. The result of every truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions is also the result of one truth-operation on elementary propositions.

 Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.

    5.31 The schemata in 4.31 also have a meaning, then, when ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, etc. are not elementary propositions.

 And it is easy to see that the propositional sign in 4.442 expresses one truth-function of elementary propositions even when ‘p’ and ‘q’ are truth-functions of elementary propositions.

    5.32 All truth-functions are results of the successive application of a finite number of truth-operations to elementary propositions.</code></pre>
<h4
id="this-shows-that-there-are-no-logical-objects-no-logical-constants-in-freges-and-russells-sense.">5.4
This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical constants’
(in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</h4>
<pre><code>    5.41 For all results of truth-operations on truth-functions are identical whenever they are one and the same truth-function of elementary propositions.

    5.42 That v, ⊃, etc. are not relations in the sense of right and left, etc., is evident.

 The interdefinability of Frege’s and Russell’s ‘primitive signs’ of logic shows in itself that these are not primitive signs and, even more, that they do not signify relations.

 And it is obvious that the ‘⊃’ that we define by means of ‘~’ and ‘v’ is identical with the one by means of which, with ‘~’, we define ‘v’, and that this ‘v’ is identical with the first; and so on.

    5.43 It is surely hard to believe* that from one fact p infinitely many others should follow, namely, ~~p, ~~~~p, etc. And no less remarkable is it that the infinite number of propositions of logic (mathematics) follow from half a dozen ‘primitive propositions’.*

 All propositions of logic, however, say the same. Namely, nothing.

    5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions.

 If an affirmation, for example, can be generated by double negation, then is negation—in some sense—contained in affirmation? Does ‘~~p’ negate ~p, or does it affirm p, or both?

 The proposition ‘~~p’ is not concerned with negation as if it were an object; but the possibility of negation is certainly already presupposed in affirmation.

 And if there were an object called ‘~’, then what ‘~~p’ and ‘p’ say would have to be different. For the one proposition would then be concerned with ~, the other not.</code></pre>
<p>5.441 This vanishing of the apparent logical constants also occurs
where ‘<sub>(∃x).</sub>fx’ says the same as ‘(x).fx’, or ‘(∃x). fx.x =
a’ the same as ‘fa’.</p>
<p>5.442 If a proposition is given to us, then with it are also given
the results of all truth-operations that have it as their base.</p>
<pre><code>    5.45 If there are primitive signs of logic, then a correct logic must make clear their relation to one another and justify their occurrence.* The construction of logic out of its primitive signs must become clear.</code></pre>
<p>5.451 If logic has primitive ideas, then they must be independent of
one another. If a primitive idea is introduced, then it must be
introduced in all combinations in which it occurs whatsoever. It cannot
be introduced, that is, first for one combination and then once more for
another. For example, if negation is introduced, then it must now be the
case that we understand it in propositions of the form ‘~p’ as well as
in propositions such as ‘~(pvq)’, ‘(∃x).~fx’, among others. We must not
introduce it first for one class of cases, then for another, for it
would then be left in doubt whether its meaning is the same in the two
cases and there would be no reason given for using the same kind of
sign-combination in the two cases.</p>
<pre><code> (In short, what Frege said (in Basic Laws of Arithmetic) about the introduction of signs by means of definitions also holds, mutatis mutandis, for the introduction of primitive signs.*)</code></pre>
<p>5.452 The introduction of a new aid into the symbolism of logic must
always be an event of consequence. No new aid may be introduced in
logic—with a quite innocent face, so to speak—in brackets or in the
margins.</p>
<pre><code> (This is how definitions and primitive propositions appear in words in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica.* Why suddenly words here? Justification is needed. This is missing and is bound to be missing, since the practice is in fact illegitimate.)

 If the introduction of a new aid has proved necessary at a certain point, however, then the question must immediately be asked: Where must this aid now always be applied? Its place in logic must now be explained.</code></pre>
<p>5.453 All numbers in logic have to be justified.</p>
<pre><code> Or rather: it must turn out that there are no numbers in logic.

 There are no pre-eminent numbers.*</code></pre>
<p>5.454 In logic there is no juxtaposition,* there can be no
classification.</p>
<pre><code> In logic there cannot be degrees of generality and specificity.</code></pre>
<p>5.4541 The solutions of the problems of logic must be simple, for
they set the standard of simplicity.People have always suspected that
there must be a realm of questions whose answers—a priori—lie
symmetrically united in a self-contained, regular structure.A realm in
which the proposition holds: simplex sigillum veri.*</p>
<pre><code>    5.46 If the logical signs were introduced correctly, then the sense of all their combinations would thereby also have been introduced; that is, not only ‘pvq’ but also ‘~(pv~q)’, etc. etc. The effect of all possible combinations of brackets would thereby also have been introduced. And it would then have become clear that the real general primitive signs are not ‘pvq’, ‘(∃x).fx’, etc., but the most general form of their combinations.</code></pre>
<p>5.461 Of great significance is the apparently unimportant fact that
pseudo-relations in logic, such as v und ⊃, need brackets, unlike real
relations.</p>
<pre><code> For the use of brackets with these apparently primitive signs already indicates that they are not the real primitive signs. And no one could possibly believe that brackets have an independent meaning.</code></pre>
<p>5.4611 Signs for logical operations are punctuation marks.</p>
<pre><code>    5.47 It is clear that everything that can be said from the outset about the form of all propositions must be capable of being said all at once.

 For all logical operations are already contained in the elementary proposition. For ‘fa’ says the same as ‘(∃x).fx.x = a’.

 Where there is compositionality, there is argument and function, and where these are, there are already all logical constants.

 One could say: the one logical constant is what all propositions, by their nature, have in common with one another.

 But that is the general propositional form.</code></pre>
<p>5.471 The general propositional form is the essence of the
proposition.</p>
<p>5.4711 To specify the essence of the proposition is to specify the
essence of all description, and thus the essence of the world.</p>
<p>5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is the
description of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.</p>
<p>5.473 Logic must take care of itself.</p>
<pre><code> A possible sign must also be able to signify. Everything that is possible in logic is also permitted. (‘Socrates is identical’ thus means nothing, because there is no property that is called ‘identical’. The proposition is nonsensical because we have failed to make some arbitrary determination, not because the symbol in itself is impermissible.)

 In a certain sense, we cannot make mistakes in logic.</code></pre>
<p>5.4731 Self-evidence, of which Russell spoke so much, can only become
dispensable in logic by language itself preventing every logical
mistake.—That logic is a priori consists in this: that we cannot think
illogically.</p>
<p>5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.</p>
<p>5.47321 Occam’s razor is not, of course, an arbitrary rule, nor one
justified by its practical success: it says that unnecessary sign-units
mean nothing.Signs that serve one purpose are logically equivalent,
signs that serve no purpose are logically meaningless.</p>
<p>5.4733 Frege says: every legitimately constructed* proposition must
have a sense; and I say: every possible proposition is legitimately
constructed, and if it has no sense, then this can only be because we
have not given a meaning to some of its constituents.(Even if we think
we have done so.)So that is why ‘Socrates is identical’ says nothing,
because we have given no meaning to the word ‘identical’ as adjective.
For when it occurs as the identity sign, it symbolizes in a quite
different way—the signifying relation is a different one; that is, the
symbol in the two cases is also quite different; the two symbols have
only the sign in common with one another accidentally.</p>
<p>5.474 The number of basic operations that are required depends only
on our notation.</p>
<p>5.475 It is simply a matter of constructing a sign-system with a
particular number of dimensions—with a particular mathematical
multiplicity.</p>
<p>5.476 It is clear that the concern here is not with a number of
primitive ideas that have to be signified, but with the expression of a
rule.</p>

id="every-truth-function-is-a-result-of-the-successive-application-of-the-operation-tξ.-to-elementary-propositions.">5.5
Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the
operation (– – – – – T)(ξ,….) to elementary propositions.</h4>
<pre><code> This operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets and I call it the negation of these propositions.</code></pre>
<p>5.501 I indicate a bracket-expression whose terms are
propositions—where the order of the terms is irrelevant— by a sign of
the form ‘()’. ‘ξ’ is a variable whose values are the terms of the
bracket-expression, and the line over the variable indicates that it
stands for all its values in the brackets.</p>
<pre><code> (If ξ thus has, say, the 3 values, P, Q, R, then () = (P, Q, R).)

 The values of the variables are fixed.

 The fixing* is a description of the propositions that the variable stands for.

 How the description of the terms of the bracket-expression is given is inessential.

 We can distinguish three kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration. In this case we can simply replace the variable by its constant values. 2. Specification of a function fx, whose values for all values of x are the propositions to be described. 3. Specification of a formal law according to which the propositions are constructed. In this case the terms of the bracket-expression are all the terms of a form-series.</code></pre>
<p>5.502 Instead of ‘(– – – – – T)(ξ,….)’ I thus write ‘(N()’.</p>
<pre><code> N() is the negation of all the values of the propositional variable ξ.</code></pre>
<p>5.503 Since it is obviously easy to express how propositions can be,
or are not to be, constructed by this operation, this must also be
capable of finding exact expression.</p>
<pre><code>    5.51 If ξ has only one value, then N() = ~p (not p); if it has two values, then N() = ~p.~q (neither p nor q).</code></pre>
<p>5.511 How can logic, all-encompassing and mirroring the world, use
such specific hooks and manipulations?* Only by their all connecting
into an infinitely fine network, to the great mirror.</p>
<p>5.512 ‘~p’ is true if ‘p’ is false. In the true proposition ‘~p’,
then, ‘p’ is a false proposition. So how is it that the stroke ‘~’
brings it into agreement with reality?</p>
<pre><code> What negates in ‘~p’, however, is not the ‘~’ but what is in common to all signs of this notation that negate p.

 That is, the common rule according to which ‘~p’, ‘~~~p’. ‘~pv~p’. ‘~p.~p’, etc. etc. (ad infinitum) are constructed. And it is what is common here that mirrors negation.</code></pre>
<p>5.513 One could say: what is common to all symbols that affirm both p
and q is the proposition ‘p.q’. What is common to all symbols that
affirm either p or q is the proposition ‘p v q’.</p>
<pre><code> So, too, one can say: two propositions are opposed to one another if they have nothing in common with one another; and: every proposition has only one negative, since there is only one proposition that lies wholly outside it.

 This shows itself also in Russell’s notation: that ‘q: p v~ p’ says the same as ‘q’; that ‘p v ~p’ says nothing.</code></pre>
<p>5.514 If a notation is established, then there is in it a rule
according to which all propositions negating p are constructed, a rule
according to which all propositions affirming p are constructed, a rule
according to which all propositions affirming p or q are constructed,
and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their
sense is mirrored.</p>
<p>5.515 It must show itself in our symbols that what is combined with
one another by ‘v’, ‘.’, etc., must be propositions.</p>
<pre><code> And this is indeed the case, since the symbol ‘p’ and ‘q’ itself presupposes ‘v’, ‘~’, etc. If the sign ‘p’ in ‘p v q’ does not stand for a complex sign, then it cannot have sense by itself; but then the signs ‘p v p’, ‘p.p’, etc., which have the same sense as ‘p’, can have no sense either. But if ‘p v p’ has no sense, then neither can ‘p v q’ have sense.</code></pre>
<p>5.5151 Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with
the sign of the positive? Why should one not be able to express a
negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (For example, if ‘a’
does not stand in a particular relation to ‘b’, then this could express
that aRb is not the case.)But even here the negative proposition is
constructed indirectly by means of the positive.The positive proposition
must presuppose the existence of the negative proposition, and
conversely.</p>
<pre><code>    5.52 If the values of ξ are all the values of a function fx for all values of x, then N() = ~(∃x).fx.</code></pre>
<p>5.521 I separate the concept all from the truth-function.*</p>
<pre><code> Frege and Russell introduced generality in connection with logical product or logical sum. It thus became hard to understand the propositions ‘(∃x).fx’ and ‘(x).fx’, in which both ideas are incorporated.</code></pre>
<p>5.522 The peculiarity of the generality-sign is, first, that it
points to a logical prototype, and second, that it highlights
constants.</p>
<p>5.523 The generality-sign occurs as an argument.</p>
<p>5.524 If objects are given, then all objects are thereby also given
to us.</p>
<pre><code> If elementary propositions are given, then all elementary propositions are thereby also given.</code></pre>
<p>5.525 It is incorrect to paraphrase the proposition ‘(∃x).fx’ as ‘fx
is possible’, as Russell does.</p>
<pre><code> The certainty, possibility, or impossibility of a state of affairs is not expressed by a proposition but by an expression’s being a tautology, a senseful proposition, or a contradiction.

 That precedent to which one invariably wants to appeal must already lie in the symbol itself.</code></pre>
<p>5.526 One can describe the world completely by fully generalized
propositions, that is, without correlating from the outset any name with
a particular object.</p>
<pre><code> To then arrive at the usual mode of expression, one simply has to say, after an expression ‘there is one and only one x that…’, and this x is a.</code></pre>
<p>5.5261 A fully generalized proposition is composite like every other
proposition. (This is shown in our having to mention ‘ϕ’ and ‘x’
separately in ‘(∃x, ϕ).ϕx’. Both stand independently in signifying
relations to the world as in an ungeneralized proposition.) A mark of a
composite symbol: it has something in common with other symbols.</p>
<p>5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition alters something in
the general construction of the world. And the scope that is left open
to its construction by the totality of elementary propositions is
precisely that which the quite general propositions limit.(If an
elementary proposition is true, then, at any rate, one more elementary
proposition is thereby true.)</p>
<pre><code>    5.53 Identity of object I express by identity of sign and not by means of an identity sign.* Difference of objects by difference of signs.</code></pre>
<p>5.5301 That identity is not a relation between objects is
self-evident. This becomes very clear if one considers, for example, the
proposition ‘(x): fx. ⊃. x = a’. What this proposition says is simply
that only a satisfies the function f, and not that only such things that
have a certain relation to a satisfy the function f.Of course, one could
say that it is only a that has this relation to a, but in order to
express this, we would need the identity sign itself.</p>
<p>5.5302 Russell’s definition of ‘=’ doesn’t work, because according to
it one cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common.
(Even if this proposition is never correct, it still has sense.)</p>
<p>5.5303 Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical
is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself
says nothing at all.</p>
<p>5.531 I thus write not ‘f (a,b). a = b’ but ‘f (a,a)’ (or ‘f (b,b)’).
And not ‘f (a,b). ~a = b’ but ‘f (a,b)’.</p>
<p>5.532 And analogously: Not ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). x = y’, but ‘(∃x). f
(x,x)’; and not ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). ~x = y’, but ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y)’.</p>
<pre><code> (So instead of Russell’s ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y)’: ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). v. (∃x). f (x,x)’.)</code></pre>
<p>5.5321 Instead of ‘(x): fx. ⊃. x = a’ we thus write, for example,
‘(∃x). fx. ⊃. fa: ~(∃x,y). fx. fy’.And the proposition ‘only one x
satisfies f ( )’ reads: ‘(∃x). fx: ~(∃x,y). fx. fy’.</p>
<p>5.533 The identity sign is thus not an essential constituent of a
concept-script.</p>
<p>5.534 And now we see that pseudo-propositions such as ‘a = a’, ‘a = b
. b = c. ⊃. a = c’, ‘(x). x = x’, ‘(∃x). x = a’, etc., cannot even be
written down in a correct concept-script.</p>
<p>5.535 This also resolves all the problems that were connected with
such pseudo-propositions.</p>
<pre><code> All the problems that Russell’s ‘axiom of infinity’ raises can already be solved here.

 What the axiom of infinity tries to say would express itself in language by there being infinitely many names with a different meaning.</code></pre>
<p>5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use
expressions of the form ‘a = a’ or ‘p⊃p’ and the like. And indeed this
happens when one wants to talk of a prototype—of proposition, thing,
etc. Thus Russell, in The Principles of Mathematics, had rendered the
nonsense ‘p is a proposition’ in symbols as ‘p⊃p’ and placed it as
hypothesis before certain propositions so that their argument-places
could only be filled by propositions.*(It is nonsense, from the start,
to place the hypothesis p⊃p before a proposition to ensure that its
arguments have the correct form, because the hypothesis for a
non-proposition as argument becomes not false but nonsensical, and
because the proposition itself becomes nonsensical by the incorrect kind
of argument—in other words, it protects itself from incorrect arguments
just as well, or poorly, as attaching a senseless hypothesis for this
purpose.)</p>
<p>5.5352 Likewise one has tried to express ‘There are no things’ by
‘~(∃x). x = x’. But even if this were a proposition, would it not be
true as well if indeed ‘there were things’ but these were not identical
with themselves?</p>
<pre><code>    5.54 In the general propositional form a proposition occurs in a proposition only as the base of truth-operations.</code></pre>
<p>5.541 At first sight it looks as if a proposition could occur in
another in a different way as well.</p>
<pre><code> Especially in certain propositional forms in psychology, such as ‘A believes that p is the case’ or ‘A thinks p’, etc.

 That is, superficially, it looks here as if the proposition p stood in a kind of relation to an object A.

 (And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore, etc.) these propositions have been construed in just this way.)</code></pre>
<p>5.542 It is clear, however, that ‘A believes that p’, ‘A thinks p’,
‘A says p’ are of the form ‘“p” says p’: and this does not concern a
correlation of a fact with an object, but the correlation of facts by
means of a correlation of their objects.</p>
<p>5.5421 This also shows that there is no such thing as the soul—the
subject, etc.—as construed in the superficial psychology of today.A
composite soul, that is, would no longer be a soul.</p>
<p>5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition ‘A
judges p’ must show that it is impossible to judge nonsense. (Russell’s
theory does not satisfy this condition.)</p>
<p>5.5423 To perceive a complex is to perceive that its constituents
stand to one another in such and such a way.This may also explain how
the figurecan be seen as a cube in two ways, and all similar
appearances. For we really do see two different facts.(If I look first
at the a corners and only fleetingly at the b ones, then the a corners
appear in front, and conversely.)</p>
<pre><code>    5.55 We must now answer a priori the question as to all possible forms of elementary propositions.

 An elementary proposition consists of names. Since we cannot specify the number of names with different meaning, however, we cannot specify the composition of the elementary proposition either.</code></pre>
<p>5.551 Our basic principle is that every question that can be decided
at all by logic must be capable of being decided straightaway.</p>
<pre><code> (And if we find ourselves having to answer such a problem by looking at the world, then this shows that we are on the wrong track altogether.)</code></pre>
<p>5.552 The ‘experience’ that we need to understand logic is not that
such and such is the case,* but that something is; that, however, is
precisely not an experience.</p>
<pre><code> Logic is prior to every experience—that something is so.

 It is prior to the how, not prior to the what.</code></pre>
<p>5.5521 And if this were not so, then how could we apply logic? One
could say: if there were a logic even if there were no world, then how
could there be a logic given that there is a world?</p>
<p>5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between different
numbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how is
that to be decided?—By experience?</p>
<pre><code> (There is no pre-eminent number.*)</code></pre>
<p>5.554 The specification of any particular form would be completely
arbitrary.</p>
<p>5.5541 It is supposed to be specifiable a priori whether, for
example, I can get into a position where I have to signify something
with a sign for a 27-place relation.</p>
<p>5.5542 But may we even ask this? Can we establish a sign form and not
know whether something can correspond to it?Does the question have a
sense: what must there be in order that something can be-the-case?*</p>
<p>5.555 It is clear that we have a concept of an elementary proposition
irrespective of its particular logical form.</p>
<pre><code> Where one can construct symbols according to a system, however, there the system is what is logically important and not the individual symbols.

 And how would it even be possible for me, in logic, to deal with forms that I can invent; rather, I must deal with whatever makes it possible for me to invent them.</code></pre>
<p>5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementary
propositions. Only what we ourselves construct can we foresee.</p>
<p>5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects. The
limit shows itself again in the totality of elementary propositions.The
hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.</p>
<p>5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be
elementary propositions, then everyone who understands propositions in
their unanalysed form must know it.</p>
<p>5.5563 All propositions of our everyday language are in fact, just as
they are, in perfect logical order.*—That most simple idea that we have
to get across here is not a likeness of the truth but the whole truth
itself.(Our problems are not abstract but perhaps the most concrete that
there are.)</p>
<p>5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions
there are.</p>
<pre><code> What lies in its application logic cannot anticipate.

 This is clear: logic must not conflict with its application.

 Yet logic has to be in contact with its application.

 Thus logic and its application must not overlap one another.</code></pre>
<p>5.5571 If I cannot specify a priori the elementary propositions, then
trying to specify them must lead to obvious nonsense.</p>
<h4 id="the-limits-of-my-language-mean-the-limits-of-my-world.">5.6 The
limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</h4>
<pre><code>    5.61 Logic pervades the world; the limits of the world are also its limits.

 So we cannot say in logic: there is this and this in the world, but not that.

 For this would apparently presuppose that we are excluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case since otherwise logic would have to go beyond the limits of the world—for it would have to view these limits from the other side as well.

 What we cannot think, we cannot think; so we cannot say what we cannot think either.

    5.62 This remark provides the key to deciding the question to what extent solipsism is a truth.

 For what solipsism means* is quite correct; it is just that it cannot be said but only shows itself.

 That the world is my world shows itself in that the limits of language (of that language I understand) mean the limits of my world.*</code></pre>
<p>5.621 World and life are one.</p>
<pre><code>    5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.)</code></pre>
<p>5.631 There is no thinking, representing subject.*</p>
<pre><code> If I wrote a book, ‘The world as I found it’, then this would also have to report on my body and say which parts of it obey my will and which not, etc.; for this is a method of isolating the subject, or rather, of showing that, in an important sense, there is no subject—for of this alone could there be no talk in this book.</code></pre>
<p>5.632 The subject does not belong to the world but is a limit of the
world.</p>
<p>5.633 Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be found?</p>
<pre><code> You say that this is just like the case of the eye and the visual field. But you don’t actually see the eye itself.

 And nothing in the visual field lets you infer that it is seen by an eye.</code></pre>
<p>5.6331 For the visual field does not have a form such as this:*</p>
<p>5.634 Connected with this is that no part of our experience is a
priori as well.</p>
<pre><code> Everything we see could also be otherwise.

 Everything we can describe at all could also be otherwise.

 There is no order of things a priori.

    5.64 One sees here that solipsism, strictly followed through, coincides with pure realism. The self of solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and what is left is the reality coordinated with it.</code></pre>
<p>5.641 Thus there really is a sense in which philosophy can address
the self non-psychologically.</p>
<pre><code> The self enters philosophy through this, that ‘the world is my world’.

 The philosophical self is not the human being, not the human body or the human soul, with which psychology is concerned, but the metaphysical subject, the limit—not a part—of the world.</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-general-form-of-a-truth-function-is-.">6 The general form of
a truth-function is: [].</h4>
<pre><code> This is the general form of a proposition.</code></pre>
<p>6.001 This simply says that every proposition is a result of the
successive application of the operation to elementary propositions.</p>
<p>6.002 If we are given the general form of how a proposition is
constructed, then we are thereby also given the general form of how one
proposition can be generated from another by an operation.</p>
<pre><code>    6.01 The general form of an operation is thus: .

 This is the most general form of transition from one proposition to another.

    6.02 And in this way we arrive at numbers: I define

According to these sign-rules we thus write the series x, Ω’x, Ω’ Ω’x, Ω’ Ω’ Ω’x, …

 as follows : Ω0,x, Ω0+1,x, Ω0+1+1,x, Ω0+1+1+1,x, …

 So instead of ‘[x, ξ, Ω’ ξ]’ I write:

 And define:</code></pre>
<p>6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.</p>
<p>6.022 The concept of number is simply what is common to all numbers,
the general form of a number.</p>
<pre><code> The concept of number is the variable number.

 And the concept of numerical equality is the general form of all particular numerical equalities.

    6.03 The general form of a whole number is: [0, ξ, ξ +1].</code></pre>
<p>6.031 The theory of classes is quite superfluous in mathematics.</p>
<pre><code> Connected with this is that the generality that we need in mathematics is not accidental generality.</code></pre>
<h4 id="the-propositions-of-logic-are-tautologies.">6.1 The propositions
of logic are tautologies.</h4>
<pre><code>    6.11 The propositions of logic thus say nothing. (They are the analytic propositions.)</code></pre>
<p>6.111 Theories which make propositions of logic appear contentful are
always false. One might suppose, for example, that the words ‘true’ and
‘false’ signify two properties among other properties, and it would then
appear as a remarkable fact that every proposition has one of these
properties. This seems far from obvious, just as the proposition ‘all
roses are either yellow or red’, say, sounds far from obvious, even if
it were true. For the logical proposition* then entirely acquires the
character of a proposition of natural science and this is a sure sign
that it has been misconstrued.</p>
<p>6.112 The correct explanation of logical propositions must give them
a unique status among all propositions.</p>
<p>6.113 It is the characteristic mark of logical propositions that one
can recognize from the symbol alone that they are true, and this fact
comprises the whole of philosophy of logic. And so, too, is it one of
the most important facts that non-logical propositions do not permit
their truth or falsity to be recognized from the proposition alone.</p>
<pre><code>    6.12 That the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the formal—logical—properties of language, of the world.

 That its constituents, so connected, yield a tautology is what characterizes the logic of its constituents.

 For propositions, connected in a particular way, to yield a tautology, they must have particular structural properties. That they yield a tautology so combined thus shows that they have these structural properties.</code></pre>
<p>6.1201 For example, that the propositions ‘p’ and ‘~p’ yield a
tautology in the combination ‘<sub>(p. </sub>p)’ shows that they
contradict one another. That the propositions ‘p⊃q’, ‘p’ and ‘q’
combined together in the form ‘(p⊃q).(p):⊃:(q)’ yield a tautology shows
that q follows from p and p⊃q. That ‘(x).fx:⊃:fa’ is a tautology shows
that fa follows from (x).fx, etc. etc.</p>
<p>6.1202 It is clear that one could also use contradictions instead of
tautologies for the same purpose.</p>
<p>6.1203 To recognize a tautology as such, in cases in which no
generality-sign occurs in the tautology, one can make use of the
following perspicuous method: instead of ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, etc., I write
‘TpF’, ‘TqF’, ‘TrF’, etc. I express the truth-combinations by means of
brackets, for example:</p>
<p>and the correlation of the truth or falsity of the whole proposition
with the truth-combinations of the truth-arguments by means of lines in
the following way:</p>
<pre><code>This sign, for example, would thus represent the proposition p⊃q. Now I want to test whether the proposition ~(p.~q) (law of contradiction), for example, is a tautology. The form ‘~ξ’ is written in our notation as</code></pre>
<p>and the form ‘ξ ‧η’ thus:</p>
<p>The proposition ~ (p . ~q) is therefore written thus:</p>
<pre><code>If we substitute ‘p’ for ‘q’ here and examine the combination of the outermost T and F with the innermost, then the result is that the truth of the whole proposition is correlated with all the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.</code></pre>
<p>6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties of
propositions by combining them into propositions that say nothing.</p>
<pre><code> This method could also be called a zero-method.* In a logical proposition propositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, and the state of equilibrium then shows how these propositions have to be constituted logically.</code></pre>
<p>6.122 From this it follows that we can even do without logical
propositions, since in an appropriate notation we can recognize the
formal properties of propositions by merely looking at the
propositions.</p>
<p>6.1221 For example, if two propositions ‘p’ and ‘q’ in the
combination ‘p⊃q’ yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows
from p.That ‘q’ follows from ‘p⊃q.p’, for example, we see from the two
propositions themselves, but we can also show it like this: by combining
them into ‘p⊃q.p:⊃:q’ and then showing that this is a tautology.</p>
<p>6.1222 This sheds light on the question why logical propositions
cannot be confirmed by experience, any more than they can be refuted by
experience. Not only must a proposition of logic be incapable of being
refuted by any possible experience but it must also be incapable of
being confirmed by any possible experience.</p>
<p>6.1223 Now it becomes clear why it was often felt as if the ‘logical
truths’ had to be ‘postulated’ by us: for we can postulate them inasmuch
as we can postulate an adequate notation.</p>
<p>6.1224 It also becomes clear now why logic was called the theory of
forms and of inference.</p>
<p>6.123 This is clear: logical laws must not themselves in turn be
subject to logical laws.</p>
<pre><code> (There is not, as Russell supposed, a distinct law of contradiction for each ‘type’, but one is enough, since it is not applied to itself.)</code></pre>
<p>6.1231 The mark of a logical proposition is not its general
validity.For to be general is only to be accidentally valid for all
things. For an ungeneralized proposition can be tautological just as
well as a generalized one.</p>
<p>6.1232 Logical generality could be called essential, as opposed to
that accidental generality of, say, the proposition ‘All humans are
mortal’. Propositions such as Russell’s ‘axiom of reducibility’ are not
logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they
could only be true by happy accident.</p>
<p>6.1233 A world can be imagined in which the axiom of reducibility is
not valid. It is clear, however, that logic has nothing to do with the
question whether our world is actually like this or not.</p>
<p>6.124 Logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or
rather, they represent it. They ‘concern’ nothing. They presuppose that
names have meaning and elementary propositions have sense: and this is
their connection with the world. It is clear that it must show something
about the world that certain combinations of symbols—which essentially
have a particular character—are tautologies. This is the key point. We
say that something is arbitrary in the symbols we use, something is not.
In logic only the latter expresses:* but this is to say that, in logic,
it is not we who express what we want by means of signs, but rather
that, in logic, the nature of the absolutely necessary signs itself
speaks:* if we know the logical syntax of any sign-language, then all
propositions of logic are already given.</p>
<p>6.125 It is possible, and even according to the old conception of
logic, to give from the outset a description of all ‘true’ logical
propositions.</p>
<p>6.1251 That is why there can never be surprises in logic.</p>
<p>6.126 Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be worked out by
working out the logical properties of the symbol.</p>
<pre><code> And we do this when we ‘prove’ a logical proposition. For, without concern for sense or meaning, we form the logical proposition from others according to mere sign-rules.

 The proof of logical propositions consists in our producing them from other propositions by successive application of certain operations that always generate further tautologies from the first ones. (And indeed, only tautologies follow from a tautology.)

 Of course, this way of showing that its propositions are tautologies is by no means essential to logic. Simply because the propositions from which the proof proceeds must themselves show without proof that they are tautologies.</code></pre>
<p>6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (That is why no
surprise.)</p>
<p>6.1262 Proof in logic is only a mechanical aid for easier recognition
of a tautology, where it is complicated.</p>
<p>6.1263 For it would be quite remarkable if one could prove a senseful
proposition logically from others, and a logical proposition as well. It
is clear from the outset that logical proof of a senseful proposition
and proof in logic must be two quite different things.</p>
<p>6.1264 A senseful proposition states something, and its proof shows
that this is so; in logic every proposition is the form of a proof.Every
proposition of logic is a modus ponens represented in signs. (And one
cannot express the modus ponens by a proposition.)</p>
<p>6.1265 One can always construe logic so that every proposition is its
own proof.</p>
<p>6.127 All propositions of logic have equal status, without essential
division into basic laws* and derived propositions.</p>
<pre><code> Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.</code></pre>
<p>6.1271 It is clear that the number of ‘logically basic laws’ is
arbitrary, since one could derive logic from one basic law by simply
forming the logical product, for example, of Frege’s basic laws. (Frege
would perhaps say that this basic law would no longer be immediately
self-evident. But it is remarkable that so exact a thinker as Frege
appealed to the degree of self-evidence as criterion for a logical
proposition.)</p>
<pre><code>    6.13 Logic is not a set of teachings but a mirror image of the world.*

 Logic is transcendental.</code></pre>
<h4 id="mathematics-is-a-logical-method.">6.2 Mathematics is a logical
method.</h4>
<pre><code> The propositions of mathematics are equations, that is, pseudo-propositions.

    6.21 A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.</code></pre>
<p>6.211 In life it is never mathematical propositions that we need;
rather, we use mathematical propositions only to infer, from
propositions that do not belong to mathematics, other propositions that
likewise do not belong to mathematics.</p>
<pre><code> (In philosophy the question ‘For what do we really use this word, this proposition?’ leads time and again to valuable insights.)

    6.22 The logic of the world, which the propositions of logic show in tautologies, mathematics shows in equations.

    6.23 If two expressions are connected by the equality sign, then that means that they are substitutable by one another. Whether this is the case, however, must show itself in the two expressions themselves.

 The logical form of two expressions is characterized by their being substitutable by one another.</code></pre>
<p>6.231 It is a property of affirmation that it can be construed as
double negation.</p>
<pre><code> It is a property of ‘1 + 1 + 1 + 1’ that it can be construed as ‘(1 + 1) + (1 + 1)’.</code></pre>
<p>6.232 Frege says that the two expressions have the same meaning but
different sense.*</p>
<pre><code> What is essential about an equation, however, is that it is not necessary to show that the two expressions that are combined by the equality sign have the same meaning, since this makes itself manifest in the two expressions themselves.</code></pre>
<p>6.2321 And, that the propositions of mathematics can be proved means
simply that their correctness can be seen without what they express
having to be compared with the facts for their correctness to be
seen.</p>
<p>6.2322 The identity of meaning of two expressions cannot be asserted.
For to be able to assert anything about their meaning, I must know their
meaning: and in knowing their meaning, I know whether they mean the same
or something different.*</p>
<p>6.2323 An equation only marks the standpoint from which I regard the
two expressions, that is, from the standpoint of their sameness of
meaning.</p>
<p>6.233 The question whether intuition is needed for the solution of
mathematical problems must be answered by saying that language itself
provides the necessary intuition here.*</p>
<p>6.2331 The process of calculation conveys precisely this
intuition.Calculation is not an experiment.</p>
<p>6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.</p>
<p>6.2341 What is essential in mathematical method is working with
equations. For it is on the basis of this method that every proposition
of mathematics must be self-explanatory.*</p>
<pre><code>    6.24 The method of mathematics by which it arrives at its equations is the method of substitution.

 For equations express the substitutability of two expressions and we proceed from a number of equations to new equations by substituting expressions by others in accordance with the equations.</code></pre>

<pre><code>    6.31 The so-called law of induction cannot possibly be a logical law, since it is obviously a senseful proposition.—And that is why it cannot be an a priori law either.

    6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.*</code></pre>
<p>6.321 ‘Law of causality’, that is a generic name. And just as, in
mechanics, we say that there are minimum-laws, such as that of least
action, so in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causal
form.</p>
<p>6.3211 It was suspected that there had to be some ‘law of least
action’ even before it was known exactly how it went. (Here, as always,
what is a priori certain turns out to be something purely logical.)</p>
<pre><code>    6.33 We do not believe a priori in a law of conservation, but we do know a priori the possibility of a logical form.

    6.34 All propositions such as the principle of sufficient reason, of continuity in nature, of the least effort in nature, etc. etc., are all a priori insights about the possible forms that the propositions of science can take.</code></pre>
<p>6.341 Newtonian mechanics, for example, imposes a unified form on the
description of the world. Imagine a white surface on which there are
irregular black spots. We now say: whatever picture results from this, I
can always get as close as I want to its description by covering the
surface by a sufficiently fine square mesh and then saying of each
square whether it is white or black. In this way I will have imposed a
unified form on the description of the surface. The form is up to me, as
I could have used a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh with the
same success. It might be that the description is made simpler by means
of a triangular net; that is, it might be that the surface can be
described more precisely with a coarser triangular net than with a finer
square one (or conversely), and so on. To the different nets correspond
different systems for describing the world. Mechanics determines a form
of describing the world by saying: all propositions that describe the
world must be obtained in a given way from a number of given
propositions—the axioms of mechanics. It thereby provides the building
blocks for the construction of the scientific edifice and says: whatever
edifice you want to erect, you must somehow assemble with these and only
these building blocks.</p>
<pre><code> (Just as we must be able to write down any number we want, in the number system, so we must be able to write down any proposition of physics we want, in the system of mechanics.)</code></pre>
<p>6.342 And now we see the relative position of logic and mechanics.
(The net could also consist of different kinds of figures such as of
triangles as well as hexagons.) That a picture like that mentioned above
can be described by a net of a given form states nothing about the
picture. (For this holds of every picture of this kind.) But what does
characterize the picture is that it can be completely described by a
specific net with a specific fineness of grain.</p>
<pre><code> So, too, that it can be described by Newtonian mechanics states nothing about the world; but what does state something is that it can be described in precisely the way that it is actually described in a given case. What also says something about the world is that it can be described more simply by one mechanics than by another.</code></pre>
<p>6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct, following one plan, all
the true propositions that we need for describing the world.</p>
<p>6.3431 Through their whole logical apparatus* the laws of physics
still speak of the objects of the world.</p>
<p>6.3432 We should not forget that the description of the world by
mechanics is always quite general. There is never mention, for example,
of particular material points, but always only of any such points.</p>
<pre><code>    6.35 Even though the spots in our picture are geometrical figures, geometry can say nothing at all, of course, about their actual form and position. The net, though, is purely geometrical, and all its properties can be specified a priori.

 Laws, such as the principle of sufficient reason, etc., are about the net, not what the net describes.

    6.36 If there were a law of causality, then it might go like this: ‘There are laws of nature’.

 But that, of course, cannot be said; it shows itself.</code></pre>
<p>6.361 In Hertz’s terminology one could say: only regular connections*
are thinkable.</p>
<p>6.3611 We cannot compare any process with the ‘passage of time’—there
is no such thing—but only with another process (such as the movement of
a chronometer).The description of a sequence in time is thus only
possible by relying on another process.Something quite analogous holds
for space. When it is said, for example, that neither of two (mutually
exclusive) events occur, because there is no cause explaining why the
one should occur rather than the other, in reality it has to do with our
being unable to describe one of the two events at all unless there is
some asymmetry. And if there is such an asymmetry, then we can regard
this as the cause for the occurrence of the one and the non-occurrence
of the other.</p>
<p>6.36111 The Kantian problem of the right and left hand, which cannot
be made to coincide, already exists in the plane, and even in
one-dimensional space, where the two congruent figures a and b cannot be
made to coincide without being moved out of this space.</p>
<p>Right and left hand are in fact completely congruent. And that they
cannot be made to coincide has nothing to do with it.A right-hand glove
could be put on the left hand, if it could be turned in four-dimensional
space.</p>
<p>6.362 What can be described can happen, too, and what the law of
causality is supposed to exclude cannot even be described.</p>
<p>6.363 The process of induction consists in adopting the simplest law
with which to bring our experiences into accord.</p>
<p>6.3631 This process, however, has no logical but only a psychological
grounding.It is clear that there is no ground for believing that the
simplest case would actually even occur.</p>
<p>6.36311 That the sun will rise tomorrow is a hypothesis; and that is
to say: we do not know whether it will rise.</p>
<pre><code>    6.37 There is no compulsion for one thing to happen because something else has happened. There is only logical necessity.</code></pre>
<p>6.371 Underlying the entire modern worldview is the illusion that the
so-called laws of nature are explanations of natural phenomena.</p>
<p>6.372 People thus stop at the laws of nature as if they were
sacrosanct,* like the ancients did at God and Fate.</p>
<pre><code> And they are both right—and wrong. The ancients were at least clearer insofar as they recognized a clear endpoint, while the new system tries to make it appear as if everything were explained.</code></pre>
<p>6.373 The world is independent of my will.</p>
<p>6.374 Even if everything we wish were to happen, this would still
only happen, so to speak, by the grace of Fate, for there is no logical
connection between will and world that guaranteed this, and the supposed
physical connection is not something that we could, in turn, will
ourselves.</p>
<p>6.375 Just as there is only logical necessity, so too there is only
logical impossibility.</p>
<p>6.3751 For example, for two colours to be in one place in the visual
field at the same time is impossible—logically impossible— for it is
excluded by the logical structure of colour.Consider how this
contradiction manifests itself in physics—roughly like this: that a
particle cannot have two velocities at the same time; that is, that it
cannot be in two places at the same time; that is, that particles in
different places at one time cannot be identical.(It is clear that the
logical product of two elementary propositions can be neither a
tautology nor a contradiction. The statement that a point in the visual
field has two different colours at the same time is a
contradiction.)</p>
<h4 id="all-propositions-are-of-equal-value.">6.4 All propositions are

<pre><code>    6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside it. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it happens; there is no value in it—and if there were, then it would be of no value.

 If there is a value that is of value, then it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.

 What makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.

 It must lie outside the world.

    6.42 That is why there cannot be propositions of ethics.

 Propositions cannot express anything higher.</code></pre>
<p>6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be stated.*</p>
<pre><code> Ethics is transcendental.

 (Ethics and aesthetics are one.)</code></pre>
<p>6.422 The first thought in drawing up an ethical law of the form
‘Thou shalt…’ is: and what if I don’t do it? It is clear, though, that
ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary
sense. So this question as to the consequences of an action must be
irrelevant.—At least, these consequences must not be events. For
something must still be right in the posing of this question. That is,
there must be a kind of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but these
must lie in the action itself.</p>
<pre><code> (And it is also clear that the reward must be something pleasant and the punishment something unpleasant.)</code></pre>
<p>6.423 Of the will as the bearer of the ethical* we cannot speak.</p>
<pre><code> And only psychology is interested in the will as phenomenon.

    6.43 If good or bad willing changes the world, then it can only change the limits of the world, not the facts—not that which can be expressed by language.

 In short, the world must thereby become an altogether different one. It must, so to speak, wax or wane as a whole.

 The world of the happy is a different one from that of the unhappy.</code></pre>
<p>6.431 Just as in death, the world does not change but ends.</p>
<p>6.4311 Death is not an event in life. Death is not experienced.*If
eternity is understood not as endless temporal duration but as
timelessness, then someone who lives in the present lives eternally.Our
life is endless just as our visual field is limitless.</p>
<p>6.4312 Not only does temporal immortality of the human soul—that is
to say, its eternal survival after death—lack any kind of warrant but,
most crucially, its assumption fails entirely to achieve the intended
result. For is a riddle thereby solved by my eternal survival? Is this
eternal life not just as mysterious as our present one? The solution to
the riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time.*(It is
not problems of natural science that have to be solved.)</p>
<p>6.432 How the world is, is of no concern at all for what is higher.
God does not reveal himself in the world.</p>
<p>6.4321 The facts all pertain only to the problem, not to the
solution.</p>
<pre><code>    6.44 Not how the world is, but that it is, is the mystical.

    6.45 Viewing the world sub specie aeterni is viewing it as a—limited—whole.

 Feeling the world as a limited whole is the mystical feeling.</code></pre>
<p>6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be
stated.*</p>
<pre><code> There is no such thing as the riddle.*

 If a question can be posed at all, then it can also be answered.

    6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to doubt where nothing can be asked.

 For there can be doubt only where there is a question, a question only where there is an answer, and an answer only where something can be said.

    6.52 We feel that even if all possible scientific questions were answered, the problems of life would remain completely untouched. To be sure, not a single question would then be left; and precisely this is the answer.</code></pre>
<p>6.521 The solution to the problem of life is found in the vanishing
of the problem.</p>
<pre><code> (Is this not the reason why those to whom the meaning of life* became clear after prolonged doubt, could not then say in what this meaning consisted?)</code></pre>
<p>6.522 There is, though, the ineffable.* This shows itself, it is the
mystical.</p>
<pre><code>    6.53 The correct method in philosophy would really be this: to say nothing except what can be said, that is, propositions of natural science*—that is, something that has nothing to do with philosophy; and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to them that they had not given a meaning to certain signs in their propositions.* This method would be unsatisfying to them—they would not have the feeling that we were teaching them philosophy—but this would be the only strictly correct one.

    6.54 My propositions elucidate* when someone who understands me finally recognizes them as nonsensical by using them to climb up, over, and out of them. (They must throw away the ladder, so to speak, having used it to climb up.)

 They must get over these propositions, and then they see the world correctly.*</code></pre>

<p>The Tree Structure of the Main Propositions of the Tractatus</p>
<p>Top-level</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case.</p>

<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
<p>Second-level</p>
<p>1 The world is everything that is the case. 1.1 The world is the
totality of facts, not of things.</p>
<p>1.2 The world divides into facts.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things. 2.1
We picture facts.</p>
<p>2.2 A picture has the logical form of depiction in common with what
is depicted.</p>
<p>3 A logical picture of facts is a thought. 3.1 In a proposition a
thought is expressed perceptibly.</p>
<p>3.2 In a proposition a thought can be so expressed that to the
objects of the thought correspond elements of the propositional
sign.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a
proposition does a name have meaning.</p>
<p>3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence
of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituents
themselves, by the existence of the senseful proposition.</p>
<p>3.5 A propositional sign as applied in thinking is a thought.</p>
<p>4 A thought is a senseful proposition. 4.1 A proposition represents
the obtaining and non-obtaining of states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with
the possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the
possibilities of the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</p>
<p>4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement
with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.</p>
<p>4.5 It now appears possible to specify the most general propositional
form: that is, to give a description of the propositions of any
sign-language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol
that fits the description, and that every symbol that fits the
description can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen
accordingly.</p>
<p>It is clear that in the description of the most general propositional
form only what is essential to it may be described—since otherwise it
would not be the most general.</p>
<p>That there is a general propositional form is demonstrated by this:
that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been
foreseen (i.e. constructed). The general form of a proposition is: such
and such is the case.</p>
<p>5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An
elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.) 5.1 The
truth-functions can be ordered in series. This is the foundation of
probability theory.</p>
<p>5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one
another.</p>
<p>5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function arises from
elementary propositions.</p>
<p>It is of the essence of a truth-operation that, in the same way as
elementary propositions give rise to their truth-function,
truth-functions give rise to a new one. Every truth-operation generates,
from truth-functions of elementary propositions, another truth-function
of elementary propositions, a proposition. The result of every
truth-operation on the results of truth-operations on elementary
propositions is also the result of one truth-operation on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on elementary
propositions.</p>
<p>5.4 This shows that there are no ‘logical objects’, no ‘logical
constants’ (in Frege’s and Russell’s sense).</p>
<p>5.5 Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of
the operation (– – – – – T)(ξ,….) to elementary propositions.This
operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets
and I call it the negation of these propositions.</p>
<p>5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.</p>
<p>6 The general form of a truth-function is []. This is the general
form of a proposition. 6.1 The propositions of logic are
tautologies.</p>
<p>6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics
are equations, that is, pseudo-propositions.</p>
<p>6.3 The investigation of logic means the investigation of all
regularity. And outside logic all is accident.</p>
<p>6.4 All propositions are of equal value.</p>
<p>6.5 When an answer cannot be stated, neither can the question be
stated. There is no such thing as the riddle. If a question can be posed
at all, then it can also be answered.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent.</p>
<h4 id="explanatory-notes">Explanatory Notes</h4>
<p>Motto Motto … Kürnberger. This is cited from an essay by the Austrian
writer Ferdinand Kürnberger (1821–79) entitled ‘Das Denkmalsetzen in der
Opposition’, first published in the Deutsche Zeitung in 1873.</p>
<p>Preface and of what one cannot talk, about that one must be silent:
wovon man nicht reden kann, darüber muß man schweigen. This also forms
the final proposition (7) of the book, the only difference being the use
of ‘reden’ rather than ‘sprechen’. On its translation, see the note to 7
below.</p>
<p>2 What is the case, a fact, is the obtaining of states-of-things: Was
der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von Sachverhalten. Here—and
throughout—‘Tatsache’ is translated as ‘fact’ (and ‘fact’ is used only
in translating ‘Tatsache’), and ‘Sachverhalt’ as ‘state-of-things’
(which is used only to translate ‘Sachverhalt’). ‘Bestehen’ is
translated here as ‘obtaining’, though elsewhere the verb ‘bestehen’ is
rendered differently, as indicated in the Glossary and explained, where
needed, in the relevant notes below. In the original translation of the
Tractatus, Ramsey and Ogden rendered this proposition as ‘What is the
case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts’. This rightly draws
attention to the connection between a ‘Tatsache’ and a ‘Sachverhalt’
(both are ‘sachlich’ or ‘factual’), but does so in a misleading way,
since it suggests that facts are somehow composed of ‘atomic facts’.
What Wittgenstein actually says is more nuanced: that a fact is the
obtaining of Sachverhalten. Talk of ‘existing’ rather than ‘existence’
here would be marginally better, but ‘obtaining’ (or ‘holding’) is best,
since it carries less implication of ‘composition’. A fact is that a
Sachverhalt obtains or that Sachverhalten obtain. In their later
translation, Pears and McGuinness also render ‘Bestehen’ as ‘existence’,
but this term is more appropriately reserved for ‘Existenz’, which
Wittgenstein only uses seven times (see the Glossary). ‘Sachverhalt’
they translate as ‘state of affairs’, but this has too broad a meaning,
suggesting a more complex state. As 4.21 makes clear, a Sachverhalt is
indeed ‘atomic’—but not a fact. As Wittgenstein says in the proposition
that immediately follows 2, a Sachverhalt is ‘a combination of objects
(entities, things)’ (2.01). So ‘state of things’ seems better than
‘state of affairs’ (as Pears and McGuinness implicitly recognize in
interpolating ‘state of things’ after ‘state of affairs’ in their
translation of 2.01). Hyphens have been added, though, to form
‘state-of-things’, to highlight that what we have here is a unity—and
hence to better reflect Wittgenstein’s use of the single German word
‘Sachverhalt’. In the present translation, ‘state of affairs’ is also
used, but only as the translation of ‘Sachlage’ (which Pears and
McGuinness render as ‘situation’). This brings out the connection
between states-of-things and states of affairs: a state-of-things is an
atomic or elementary state of affairs (but again, not a fact). Cf. the
note to 2.014 below.</p>
<p>2.01 objects (entities, things). The three German terms are
‘Gegenstände’, ‘Sachen’, and ‘Dinge’, translated as ‘objects’,
‘entities’, and ‘things’, respectively. Wittgenstein is clearly using
the terms here as roughly synonymous. ‘Gegenstand’ is translated
throughout as ‘object’, and ‘Ding’ as ‘thing’.</p>
<p>2.012 prefigured: präjudiziert.</p>
<p>Note *. In this translation, the logical weight has also been
represented typographically, by font size, style, and line spacing (in
the case of the propositions n and n.1, n.2, etc.), and indentation of
the decimal numbers. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is
for the reader (and translator) to keep in mind the numbering
system.</p>
<p>2.0122 proposition: Satz. This is the first occurrence of ‘Satz’ in
the (main text of the) Tractatus, and might naturally be translated as
‘sentence’ here, as a linguistic expression in which words occur. But
even here, and in similar cases throughout the text, Wittgenstein has in
mind sentences that (at least purportedly) have a sense and a
truth-value, so that ‘proposition’ is not inappropriate. In both the
notes he left for Russell in October 1913 (partly in English but mostly
translated by Russell himself; NB, App. I) and the notes he dictated to
Moore in April 1914 (NB, App. II), ‘proposition’ is used throughout.
‘Proposition’ was a standard term in British philosophy at the time,
although there was debate about its ‘nature’ and views changed. In his
Principles of Mathematics of 1903, Russell had characterized a
‘proposition’ as ‘anything that is true or that is false’ (pp. 12–13),
but by the time of his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy of 1919,
which appeared just before he met Wittgenstein to discuss the Tractatus
and how it should be translated, he had given it a qualified linguistic
inflection: ‘We mean by a “proposition” primarily a form of words which
expresses what is either true or false. I say “primarily”, because I do
not wish to exclude other than verbal symbols, or even mere thoughts if
they have a symbolic character’ (p. 155). This is compatible with
Wittgenstein’s use of ‘Satz’ in the Tractatus, and he raised no
objections to its rendering as ‘proposition’ in the translation by
Ramsey and Ogden. In the present translation, too, ‘Satz’ is rendered
throughout by ‘proposition’, and ‘proposition’ is only used for ‘Satz’,
so that one can read back the German term. See also the notes to 3.12
and 4.025 below.</p>
<p>2.0123 know: kenne. Unlike ‘wissen’, the other verb that is generally
translated as ‘know’, ‘kennen’ can also mean ‘be acquainted with’.
Wittgenstein himself remarked that 2.0123 could be translated as ‘If I
am acquainted with an object, then I also know …’, but made clear that
he preferred ‘know’ for both uses of ‘kennen’. ‘To be acquainted with’,
he writes, ‘seems to me to imply somehow that one knows a lot about an
object, while to know here just means: I know it but I needn’t know
anything about it’ (LO, p. 59). Cf. the notes to 4.243 and 6.2322
below.</p>
<p>2.014 states of affairs: Sachlagen. Wittgenstein (LO, p. 21)
professed to dislike this translation but did not know what to suggest
instead, though he had wondered about the Latin term ‘status rerum’
(‘state of things’). ‘Sachlage’ is indeed rendered by ‘state of affairs’
in the Ramsey–Ogden translation, though ‘fact’ and ‘circumstance’ are
also used. In the present translation, it is rendered consistently by
‘state of affairs’ (which is only used for ‘Sachlage’, so that one can
read back the German term). There is clearly a connection between
‘Sachlagen’ and ‘Sachverhalten’, which is reflected in their
translations here: ‘states of affairs’ and ‘states-of-things’. A
state-of-things is an elementary or atomic state of affairs. Cf. the
note to 2 above.</p>
<p>2.02 An object is simple: Der Gegenstand ist einfach. This is a good
(and appropriately simple) illustration of one of the most difficult
things in translating German into English, surprising as that might seem
to those who have never done it: translating the definite articles—der,
die, das, etc. One should not assume that they can be rendered
straightforwardly as ‘the’ in all contexts, since the use of the
definite articles in German has a different (and wider) range than the
use of ‘the’ in English. One striking difference between the
Ramsey–Ogden and Pears–McGuinness translations is that the former uses
the definite article much more in translating Wittgenstein’s uses, while
the latter tends to use the indefinite article or pluralize. Ramsey and
Ogden translate ‘Der Gegenstand ist einfach’ as ‘The object is simple’,
for example, while Pears and McGuinness translate it as ‘Objects are
simple’. But the use of the definite article in English can sound more
formal, pompous, or archaic than it is in German (and certainly in
Wittgenstein’s German), in comparable cases, while pluralizing may
wrongly suggest that what we have is an empirical statement. The present
translation uses both definite and indefinite articles, only
occasionally pluralizing or, indeed, omitting altogether, depending on
what sounds most natural in the context. The differences are so subtle
that explanatory notes would become tedious, so the issue is only raised
here (but cf. Wittgenstein’s remarks cited in the notes to 4.464 and
5.1361 below). It should be kept in mind in reading this translation,
however, especially if detailed interpretations are being
considered.</p>
<p>2.0231 represented: dargestellt. With just one exception (see the
Glossary), ‘darstellen’ is translated throughout as ‘represent’. But
here is one case where ‘presented’ (as used in the Ramsey–Ogden
translation) has some rationale, since in being ‘formed by the
configuration of objects’, material properties can be seen as thereby
‘presented by propositions’. But ‘represented’ also works here, and it
is better to reserve ‘present’ for ‘vorstellen’. Cf. the note to 2.201
below.</p>
<p>2.02331 refer to it: darauf hinweisen.</p>
<p>2.024 subsists: besteht. This rendering is needed to make clear the
connection to the use of ‘Bestehende’ in 2.027 and 2.0271 (see the next
two notes).</p>
<p>2.027 the subsistent: das Bestehende. Here it would be misleading to
translate ‘Bestehende’ as ‘existent’ or ‘obtaining’, as ‘contingent’
existence is clearly not meant.</p>
<p>2.0271 The object … inconstant. A contrast is being drawn between the
‘Bestehende’ (‘subsistent’) and the ‘Unbeständige’ (‘inconstant’).</p>
<p>2.031 In a state-of-things the objects stand to one another in a
determinate way: Im Sachverhalt verhalten sich die Gegenstände in
bestimmter Art und Weise zueinander. It is hard to capture the play
between ‘Sachverhalt’ and ‘verhalten sich … zueinander’ in this key
proposition, but using ‘stand to one another’ for the latter captures
the main idea of a ‘state-of-things’.</p>
<p>2.032 connect: zusammenhängen.</p>
<p>2.1 We picture facts: Wir machen uns Bilder der Tatsachen, lit., we
make (to) ourselves, i.e. construct, pictures of facts. In the original
version of 2.1 in the Prototractatus, it read ‘Die Tatsachen begreifen
wir in Bildern’, lit., ‘The facts we grasp in pictures’, which is
compatible with—and arguably reinforces—the translation provided here.
The formulation was changed after 3.001 was added, though when exactly
(and if this was the cause) is unclear. On the translation, see the note
to 3.001 below.</p>
<p>2.11 presents: stellt … vor. This is one of just four uses of the
verb ‘vorstellen’ in the Tractatus, three of which are translated as
‘present’ (the others in 2.15 and 4.0311), one as ‘represent’ (5.631).
See the Glossary and the notes to the relevant propositions below.</p>
<p>2.14 standing to one another: sich … zu einander verhalten. Cf. 2.031
and the note to it above.</p>
<p>2.15 presents: stellt vor. To be consistent with its use in 2.11,
especially, as well as 4.0311, this should be translated as ‘presents’,
even though ‘represents’ would better fit the grammatical structure in
English. The ‘That … that …’ structure must be captured, as Wittgenstein
is talking here about facts.</p>
<p>2.1511 connected: verknüpft.</p>
<p>2.1514 things: Sachen.</p>
<p>2.1515 feelers: Fühler. Wittgenstein explained that by ‘Fühler’ here
‘I meant the things which a butterfly has’ (LO, p. 24).</p>
<p>2.172 it features it: es weist sie auf . ‘Features’ has the double
meaning of ‘possessing’ and ‘manifesting’, which seems appropriate
here.</p>
<p>2.201 A picture … states-of things. This is the first remark in which
both the verbs ‘abbilden’ and ‘darstellen’ are used. The former is
translated throughout by ‘depict’ (which is only used for ‘abbilden’)
and the latter by ‘represent’, with just one exception (and ‘represent’
is only used for ‘darstellen’, with just two exceptions). See the
Glossary for details. The translation by Ramsey and Ogden was not
consistent in this respect, although the two verbs might indeed be used
synonymously in some contexts. But Wittgenstein is careful in his use,
distinguishing them. As 2.201 says, a picture depicts reality by
representing possible states-of-things. Once propositions have been
characterized as pictures, he can then claim that a proposition is true
if what it represents agrees with what it depicts, and false otherwise
(see e.g. 4.021 ff.).</p>
<p>2.223 tell: erkennen; also in 2.224. Its usual meaning of ‘recognize’
does not fit here.</p>
<p>3.001 means: we can picture it: heißt: wir können uns ein Bild von
ihm machen. Wittgenstein had said that he didn’t know how to translate
the latter sentence, but suggested ‘we can imagine it’: ‘because
“imagine” comes from “image” and this is something like picture. In
German it is a sort of pun’ (LO, p. 24). But he may not have appreciated
the (idiomatic) use of ‘picture’ as a verb, which reflects much better
the ‘pun’ of which he speaks.</p>
<p>3.1 perceptibly: sinnlich wahrnehmbar, lit., sense-perceptibly,
i.e. in a way that can be perceived by the senses.</p>
<p>3.12 And a proposition … the world. This makes clear Wittgenstein’s
‘official’ conception of a Satz: a Satzzeichen in its projective
relation to the world. It is this use of ‘Satz’ that is appropriately
captured by ‘proposition’, leaving ‘Satzzeichen’ as ‘propositional
sign’, for which ‘sentence’ could also be used—though that would then
obscure the connection between ‘Satz’ and ‘Satzzeichen’. See the notes
to 2.0122 above and 4.025 below.</p>
<p>3.13 Thus the possibility … expressing it. This is a good example of
the difficulty of translating modal qualifiers such as ‘aber’, ‘allein’,
‘allerdings’, ‘also’, ‘auch’, ‘da’, ‘daher’, ‘darum’, ‘doch’, ‘eben’,
‘ja’, ‘jedenfalls’, ‘nämlich’, ‘obwohl’, ‘schon’, ‘so’, ‘sondern’, and
‘wohl’. They reflect the subtle relationships between the uses of
phrases and sentences and the transitions from one to another, and can
be a devil to translate, since they do not match up easily with English
terms. One of the frequent qualifiers is ‘also’, which Ramsey and Ogden
invariably render, and Pears and McGuinness often render, as
‘therefore’, as here in 3.13. But ‘also’ in German has a range of
meanings, from the deductive through the elucidatory to the exclamatory,
as it might be described. Listing them accordingly, it can mean
‘therefore’, ‘hence’, ‘thus’, or ‘so’, but also ‘that is’, ‘that is to
say’, ‘namely’, or, especially in conversation, even just ‘well’ or
something like ‘okay, then’. There are indeed arguments in the
Tractatus, but it is also a work of elucidation, as Wittgenstein himself
stresses. Often what he does is give variant formulations or a different
aspect of something in clarifying it rather than deducing something
else. In such contexts, ‘that is’ might be a better translation of
‘also’ than ‘therefore’. Here, in 3.13, something intermediate seems
appropriate, and ‘thus’ has thus been used. Although it is hard to pick
up the nuances of the various uses of modal qualifiers in the Tractatus,
a policy of flexibility has been adopted throughout, listening to what
the text says and how it sounds in choosing the best of what may be
several options in English. (‘Therefore’ sounds too harsh and overly
deductive in English here, and ‘thus’ gives a softer, semi-deductive,
and more elucidatory feel.)</p>
<p>means the content of a senseful proposition. Here ‘means’ translates
‘heißt’ and ‘senseful’ translates ‘sinnvoll’, to preserve the connection
with all its cognates, especially ‘sinnlos’ (senseless). The term
‘senseful’ has fallen into relative disuse but deserves to be revived,
just as ‘contentful’ has become more widely used. Cf. the note to 3.326
below.</p>
<p>3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning. Here ‘means’
translates ‘bedeutet’ and ‘meaning’ translates ‘Bedeutung’.</p>
<p>3.221 I can only speak of them, I cannot state them: Ich kann nur von
ihnen sprechen, sie aussprechen kann ich nicht. ‘Aussprechen’ is
translated as ‘state’ here, as in 4.116, 6.421, and 6.5 (see the
relevant notes below); literally, it means ‘pronounce’ or ‘speak out
about’, and might also be rendered as ‘articulate’. It is also
translated as ‘spell out’ in 3.262 (see the relevant note below).</p>
<p>3.23 demand: Forderung.</p>
<p>3.24 The generality-sign contains a prototype.
Allgemeinheitsbezeichnung = generality-sign; Urbild = prototype.</p>
<p>3.261 unpacked: auseinanderlegen. The German term covers both
‘unfold’ and ‘explicate’.</p>
<p>3.262 What … spells out: Was in den Zeichen nicht zum Ausdruck kommt,
das zeigt ihre Anwendung. Was die Zeichen verschlucken, das spricht ihre
Anwendung aus. It is hard to capture the aphoristic style and rhythm of
this; ‘verschlucken’ literally means ‘swallow’, and ‘aussprechen’ has
elsewhere been translated as ‘state’ (3.221, 4.116, 6.421, 6.5; see the
relevant notes). But here ‘hold back’ and ‘spell out’ seem more
appropriate, with the contrast captured by the ‘back’ and the ‘out’.</p>
<p>3.3 Only a proposition … meaning. What we have here is a formulation
of what is now widely known as the context principle (first stated by
Frege in The Foundations of Arithmetic of 1884), and indeed Wittgenstein
himself explicitly requested that ‘Zusammenhang’ here be translated as
‘context’, not ‘connexion’ (LO, p. 24). But it is important to keep in
mind that it still retains the core meaning of ‘connection’, which is
how ‘Zusammenhang’ is best translated elsewhere (2.0122, 2.032, 2.15,
4.03, 4.22, 5.1311, 5.1362, 6.374), with the sole exception of 4.23,
where ‘context’ is also appropriate.</p>
<p>3.315 mean: meinen.</p>
<p>3.316 fixed … fixing. festgesetzt = fixed; Festsetzung = fixing.
Wittgenstein only uses these terms in 3.316, 3.317, and 5.501;
‘determined’ and ‘determination’ are alternative renderings, but these
terms have been reserved for ‘bestimmt’ and ‘Bestimmung’.</p>
<p>3.323 existence: Existenz. This is the first occurrence in the text
of the noun ‘Existenz’, which has been translated throughout as
‘existence’, which has only been used to translate ‘Existenz’ (see the
Glossary), despite the temptation to use it for other words such as
‘Bestehen’ (see e.g. the note to 2 above). 3.323 suggests that we should
indeed be careful here.</p>
<p>3.325 concept-script: Begriffsschrift. ‘Begriffsschrift’ is the name
that Frege gave to his logical notation.</p>
<p>3.326 senseful: sinnvoll. This is rendered as ‘significant’ in the
Ramsey–Ogden translation, which Wittgenstein said he thought was
‘alright’, explaining the meaning of the proposition as follows: ‘that
in order to recognize the symbol in a sign we must look at how this sign
is used significantly in propositions. I.e. we must observe how the sign
is used in accordance with the laws of logical syntax. Thus
“significant” here means as much as “syntactically correct”’ (LO,
p. 59). Reviving ‘senseful’ to capture ‘sinnvoll’ can do just the work
Wittgenstein has in mind, while preserving the links to the relevant
cognate terms; cf. the second note to 3.13 above.</p>
<p>3.328 not needed … Occam’s razor. nicht gebraucht = not needed; Sinn
= point. Occam’s razor, named after William of Ockham (c.1287–1347), is
the methodological principle ‘Do not multiply entities beyond
necessity’.</p>
<p>If everything … does have meaning: Wenn sich alles so verhält als
hätte ein Zeichen Bedeutung, dann hat es auch Bedeutung. Wittgenstein
himself suggested translating this as ‘If everything in the symbolism
works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning’ (LO, p. 39),
which is followed here but with ‘sign-language’ replacing ‘symbolism’
(which is how ‘Zeichensprache’ is translated by Ramsey and Ogden; see
the note to 4.011 below) and capturing the force of the ‘auch’. This is
an example of how Wittgenstein occasionally, as he put it, ‘made the
translation more explicit than the German text. (The original
translation was quite wrong.)’ (LO, p. 25) The choice of ‘works’ is a
particularly apt way to render ‘verhält sich’ and adding ‘in the
symbolism [sign-language]’ makes the idea more explicit.</p>
<p>3.331 This remark …‘theory of types’: Von dieser Bemerkung sehen wir
in Russells „Theory of types“ hinüber. Wittgenstein himself requested
‘into’ rather than ‘to’ in rendering ‘in’ here (LO, pp. 59, 64), but the
present translation offers a more fluent version than Ramsey and Ogden’s
(‘From this observation we get a further view—into Russell’s Theory of
Types’).</p>
<p>3.334 self-explanatory: sich von selbst verstehen. See the note to
6.2341 below.</p>
<p>3.3411 the real name … a name. der eigentliche Name = the real name;
Es würde sich so successive ergeben = It would thus progressively turn
out. What is meant by ‘successive’ here is something like ‘as more and
more examples of symbols are considered’.</p>
<p>3.3442 propositional structure: Satzgefüge. Cf. 4.442, which contains
the only other use of this term.</p>
<p>4.002 Language disguises thought … recognized. There is play here on
‘verkleidet’ (‘disguises’), ‘Kleid’ (‘clothing’), and ‘bekleidet’
(‘clothed’).</p>
<p>4.0031 Albeit not in Mauthner’s sense. The reference here is to the
work of Fritz Mauthner (1849–1923): Beiträge zu einer Kritik der Sprache
(Contributions to a Critique of Language), 3 vols. (Stuttgart: J. G.
Cotta, 1901–3).</p>
<p>4.01 as we conceive it: so wie wir sie uns denken.</p>
<p>4.011 sign-languages: Zeichensprachen. Wittgenstein gave both
‘sign-languages’ and ‘symbolisms’ as alternative translations here, but
expressed preference for the latter (LO, p. 25). But the former is more
literal and less misleading (given his distinction between sign and
symbol), and is adopted here and throughout.</p>
<p>4.014 Like the two youths … in the fairy tale. The reference here is
to ‘Die Goldkinder’, one of the Brothers Grimms’ fairy tales.</p>
<p>4.0141 That there is … record. When Wittgenstein finished the
Tractatus (more or less), there were around a hundred propositions left
over which he was still wondering whether to include or not; see the
account given in §5 of ‘Note on the Text’. In the end only one of these
supplementary propositions (number 72) was included, numbered 4.0141,
elaborating on 4.014. Wittgenstein provided his own translation of this
(LO, pp. 26, 40), which is followed here with some slight improvements
to the English.</p>
<p>4.015 The possibility of all similes, of the whole pictoriality of
our language: Die Möglichkeit aller Gleichnisse, der ganzen
Bildhaftigkeit unserer Ausdrucksweise. The translation of ‘Gleichnisse’
as ‘similes’ (rather than ‘likenesses’) and of ‘Ausdrucksweise’ as
‘language’ (lit., ‘means of expression’) were suggested (albeit
tentatively) by Wittgenstein (LO, p. 26). He also suggested (again,
tentatively) ‘imagery’ for ‘Bildhaftigkeit’, but ‘pictoriality’ is the
better term here, to resonate with all its cognate terms.</p>
<p>4.022 A proposition … stand. Wittgenstein suggested this translation,
and in particular, translating ‘wie es sich verhält’ as ‘how things
stand’. Ramsey and Ogden’s original translation had ‘how things are
connected’, to which Wittgenstein responded that the German phrase ‘is
quite a general expression for any fact; it does not mean things are
connected etc.’ (LO, p. 27). Cf. the second note to 4.023 and the note
to 4.5 below.</p>
<p>4.023 Reality must be fixed by a proposition to elicit either yes or
no: Die Wirklichkeit muß durch den Satz auf ja oder nein fixiert sein.
Wittgenstein wrote of this: ‘This prop[osition] I cannot translate’, but
offered the following explanation: ‘The meaning of it should be that a
prop[osition] determines reality such that by merely affirming or
denying it one can make it agree with reality. A prop[osition]
can〈n〉’t entirely determine reality for it al〈l〉ways can either be
true or false; but it can ONLY be true or false. That means the
prop[osition] determines reality so far that one only needs to say “yes”
or “no” to it, and nothing more, to make it agree with reality. It is
like fixing—say—a shelf on the wall with one nail and saying: now this
is fixed so far that I only need turn it this way or that way and it
will be right. What I have here underlined thus_____or something like it
might serve as a translation if nothing better is suggested’ (LO,
p. 27). The translation here has kept it simple and literal but adding
‘elicit’ to fill out the ‘auf’. Something like ‘so that all that is left
is’ could be inserted before ‘to elicit’ to reflect Wittgenstein’s
longer paraphrase.</p>
<p>A proposition … it is true: Der Satz konstruiert eine Welt mit Hilfe
eines logischen Gerüstes und darum kann man am Satz auch sehen, wie sich
alles Logische verhält, wenn er wahr ist. In commenting on this
proposition, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘“Es verhalt sich so und so” does not
mean “things are connected such and such” (see No 4.022) but it is a
general expression like “such and such is the case”! One might translate
it freely thus: “… and therefore one can actually see in the
prop[osition] all the logical features of reality if it is true”’ (LO,
p. 27). The present translation adopts Wittgenstein’s rendering of ‘wie
sich alles Logische verhält’ as ‘all the logical features of reality’.
Cf. the note to 4.022 above and the note to 4.5 below.</p>
<p>4.025 The translation … translated. Here it might be most natural to
translate the three occurrences of ‘Satz’ by ‘sentence’ rather than
‘proposition’. But in the interests of maximizing one–one correspondence
between ‘Satz’ and ‘proposition’ throughout the translation (so that the
German term can be read back), ‘proposition’ is used here, too. See the
notes to 2.0122 and 3.12 above.</p>
<p>4.026 we communicate: verständigen wir uns, lit., we make ourselves
understood, connecting with the use of ‘verstehen’ (‘understand’) in the
previous sentence.</p>
<p>4.0311 in this way the whole—like a tableau vivant—presents a
state-of-things. Here ‘tableau vivant’ translates ‘lebendes Bild’, lit.,
living picture, and ‘presents’ translates ‘stellt … vor’.</p>
<p>4.0312 The possibility … represented. Vertretung = representation;
vertreten = represent. In other contexts, ‘vertreten’ is translated as
‘stand for’, but this does not work here, and there is no noun in
English corresponding to the verb ‘stand for’.</p>
<p>4.04 Compare … Dynamical Models. This refers to the final section in
chapter 3 of Book II of Heinrich Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics, tr. D.
E. Jones and J. T. Walley (London: Macmillan, 1899).</p>
<p>4.0411 determine: feststellen. In agreeing this translation,
Wittgenstein notes that it has the sense of ‘discover’ here (LO,
p. 69).</p>
<p>4.063 a Fregean truth-value. According to Frege, the Bedeutung
(reference, meaning) of a proposition (Satz) is a truth-value, either
the True or the False, understood as (logical) objects. On his account,
propositions refer to truth-values just as names refer to objects.</p>
<p>4.112 a set of teachings: Lehre. Cf. the note to 6.13 below, where
logic is characterized in the same way.</p>
<p>Philosophy results … becoming clear: Das Resultat der Philosophie
sind nicht ‘philosophische Sätze’, sondern das Klarwerden von Sätzen.
This is a key proposition of the Tractatus, explaining his conception of
philosophy, but is hard to translate. ‘Klarwerden’ literally means
‘becoming clear’. Wittgenstein didn’t like ‘clarification’, which is
appropriate for ‘Klärung’ in the first sentence of 4.112 but not for
‘Klarwerden’. In comments sent to Ogden on 23 April 1922, he writes:
‘Couldn’t one say: “… but the get[t]ing clear of propositions.” Or is
this still more awkward?’ (LO, p. 28) To translate ‘das Klarwerden von
Sätzen’ as ‘the clarification of propositions’ (as Ramsey originally
did, and Pears and McGuinness do in their later translation) suggests
that the objective rather than subjective genitive is intended: the
result is getting clear about propositions. But what Wittgenstein
(arguably) means is the ‘becoming clear’ possessed or achieved by the
propositions themselves—for example, when they show their logical
structure through representation in an adequate logical notation. In
their revised version, Ramsey and Ogden render the phrase as ‘to make
propositions clear’, which is better, but the resultant sentence is
somewhat ungrammatical (‘The result of philosophy is not a number of
“philosophical propositions”, but to make propositions clear’). In an
exchange of letters with Ogden in May 1922, when he answered specific
questions that Ogden had asked him, Wittgenstein writes: ‘This seems to
me wrong now. I think it cannot be the RESULT of philosophy “to make
prop[ositions]s clear”: this can only be it〈’〉s TASK. The result must
be that the prop[ositions]s now have become clear that they ARE clear.
Or can your translation be understood in this way also? If so, it’s all
right. If not rather leave “clarification”. I sup[p]ose one can〈n〉’t
say “the clearing up”. Has this got a slightly different meaning?’ (LO,
p. 49) No changes were made in response to this, and when Wittgenstein
returned the proofs on 4 August 1922, he seems to have accepted the
translation of 4.112 as it then was: ‘If “to make” is better, please put
it in. The whole, of course, is a Zeugma and there ought to be a
substantive after “but” to match with “a number of …”. But I suppose
that can〈n〉’t be done’ (LO, p. 60). The present translation renders
‘das Klarwerden von Sätzen’ as ‘propositions becoming clear’, and in
beginning with ‘Philosophy results in …’ avoids the problem of the
zeugma.</p>
<p>4.114 It should delimit … the thinkable. abgrenzen = delimit;
begrenzen = limit. It is important to translate ‘abgrenzen’ and
‘begrenzen’ differently but connectedly (they are rendered the same in
both the Ramsey–Ogden and Pears–McGuinness translations, as ‘limit’ and
‘set limit’, respectively). ‘abgrenzen’ has more the meaning of
‘demarcate’—of one thing from something different, whereas ‘begrenzen’
just means drawing a Grenze (boundary or limit), either from within or
at any rate without specifying the ‘other side’; cf. 4.113. This
distinction is crucial in Wittgenstein’s thinking, as is made clear in
his preface.</p>
<p>4.115 indicate: bedeuten. ‘bedeuten’ has a wide range of meanings,
somewhat like ‘mean’ does in English, but the respective ranges do not
overlap exactly, so that ‘bedeuten’ is sometimes better translated by a
different English term. Here it (arguably) means something like
‘indicate’ or ‘point to’; ‘signify’ is another possible translation
(used by Pears and McGuinness), but this has been used consistently
throughout for ‘bezeichnen’ (and only ‘bezeichnen’). See the Glossary
for further details of how all the relevant terms have been
translated.</p>
<p>4.116 Everything that can be stated can be stated clearly. sich
aussprechen = state. Cf. 3.221, 6.421, and 6.5, where ‘state’ is also
used, and 3.262, where ‘spell out’ is used (and ‘state’ doesn’t work):
see the relevant notes.</p>
<p>4.121 It features it: er weist sie auf. See the note to 2.172
above.</p>
<p>4.126 real concepts: eigentliche Begriffe.</p>
<p>4.1272 pseudo-concept: Scheinbegriff. Wittgenstein suggested this
translation (LO, p. 29), as well as ‘pseudo-proposition’ for
‘Scheinsatz’, used later in 4.1272.</p>
<p>4.12721 primitive ideas: Grundbegriffe. The term literally means
‘basic concepts’, but the reference is to Russell’s talk of ‘primitive
ideas’ in Principia Mathematica (see esp. *1).</p>
<p>4.128 pre-eminent numbers: ausgezeichneten Zahlen. Ramsey had
originally translated this as ‘special numbers’, to which Wittgenstein
objected as not giving the right meaning: ‘What I meant was that in
Logic there are no numbers which are in any sense more important or of
any greater significance, in any sense preeminent, as compared with the
rest of numbers. Such for instance many believe that the number one is
such a number or the number 3. And if—for instance—there was in Logic a
definite number of primitive prop[ositions] or of primitive ideas—say
the number one or any other—then this number would have, in some sense,
to prevail all through logic and consequently also throughout
philosophy. It would then be a number more important than the rest, an
“ausgezeichnete Zahl”. I have put “preeminent” instead of special. If
this won’t do please alter it. (But don’t leave “special”.)’ (LO, p. 29)
The phrase is also used in 5.453 and 5.553.</p>
<p>4.221 propositional unity: Satzverband. This rendering makes explicit
that what is raised here is the problem of the unity of the proposition,
as it has come to be known. The use of ‘Verband’ (in ‘Satzverband’)
connects with the use of ‘Verbindung’ (‘combination’) in the previous
sentence.</p>
<p>4.23 context: Zusammenhang. Though ‘Zusammenhang’ is best translated
as ‘context’ here, there is a link to its use in 4.22, where it is
(correctly) translated as ‘connection’. See the note to 3.3. If one
wanted to bring out the link between 4.22 and 4.23, one could translate
4.23 as ‘A name occurs in a proposition only when connected in an
elementary proposition’.</p>
<p>4.241 means: heißt.</p>
<p>4.243 If I know … the same: Kenne ich etwa die Bedeutung eines
englischen und eines gleichbedeutenden deutschen Wortes, so ist es
unmöglich, daß ich nicht weiß, daß die beiden gleichbedeutend sind. Both
‘kennen’ and ‘wissen’ are here translated as ‘know’, and
‘gleichbedeutend’ translated by paraphrasing in terms of ‘meaning the
same’. ‘Kennen’ has something of the meaning of ‘be acquainted with’
here; cf. the notes to 2.0123 above and 6.2322 below.</p>
<p>4.411 From the outset: von vornherein. Wittgenstein makes clear (LO,
p. 29; cf. p. 31) that this does not mean ‘a priori’, and suggests
something like ‘from the very beginning’ or ‘even on first sight’
(adopted by Ramsey and Ogden, with ‘at’ replacing ‘on’), but ‘from the
outset’ seems better. Cf. the note to 5.43 below.</p>
<p>4.431 Frege … concept-script. See G. Frege, Begriffsschrift (Halle:
L. Nebert, 1879), §§5–7; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The Frege Reader
(Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 55–63.</p>
<p>4.442 Frege’s ‘judgement stroke’ … true. See G. Frege,
Begriffsschrift (Halle: L. Nebert, 1879), §2; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The
Frege Reader (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), 52–3.</p>
<p>4.464 The truth … impossible. Wittgenstein’s comment on translating
this is instructive: ‘Here as in the preceding prop[osition] there is a
great difficulty about the use of “the”. I would rather leave it out
altogether before “tautology” and “contradiction”. But if this is
impossible rather put “a” instead of “the”. So 4.464 would be: “The
truth of tautology is certain, of propositions possible, of
contradiction impossible.” Here I have put “tautology” and
“contradiction” in the SINGULAR and “propositions” in the plural
deliberately because there are in fact no contradictions but there is
only contradiction, for they all mean the same, i.e. nothing. And the
same applies to tautology’ (LO, p. 30). On the general difficulty in
translating the definite articles in German, see the note to 2.02 above;
and cf. the note to 5.1361 below.</p>
<p>4.466 combination of symbols: Zeichenverbindung. This might most
naturally (and consistently with the uses elsewhere) be translated as
‘combination of signs’, but Wittgenstein specifically requested
‘symbols’ here (LO, pp. 60, 65), and this does seem to capture his
meaning better, as 4.4661 helps clarify.</p>
<p>4.5 such and such is the case: Es verhält sich so und so. In his
comments on the draft translation he was sent, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘This
is the only English expression I know for it. Perhaps one could say
“things stand such and such”. The expression must be one used in every
day language to express that something or other is the case’ (LO,
p. 30). Cf. the note to 4.022 and the second note to 4.023 above. The
phrase is also translated this way in 5.552.</p>
<p>5.101 The truth-functions … the following kind. The square brackets
at the end of (most of) the lines that follow were not in the original
German, but Wittgenstein wanted them added in the English translation,
with what is inside them being written in Russell’s symbolism, as in
Principia Mathematica (LO, pp. 30, 42, 60). He also explains that ‘The
expressions in words are not put in brackets except in the case of
tautology and contradiction where they have to stand in round brackets
as they do’ (LO, pp. 30–1). This was presumably to reflect the
‘senseless’ character of tautology and contradiction, as limiting cases
of propositions. Wittgenstein was very sensitive to issues of typography
and layout, and his wishes and instructions have been carefully followed
here.</p>
<p>5.1361 Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus: Der Glaube an
den Kausalnexus ist der Aberglaube [with ‘Aberglaube’ gesperrt,
i.e. with the letters more widely spaced, in the German text]. In
commenting on Ramsey’s original translation, Wittgenstein wrote:
‘“Belief in the causal nexus is superstition” isn’t right. It ought to
be: “Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus”. I didn’t mean to
say that the belief in the causal nexus was one amongst superstitions
but rather that superstition is nothing else than the belief in the
causal nexus. In the German this is expressed by the definite article
before “Aberglaube”’ (LO, p. 31). There is clearly a play here on
‘Glaube’ and ‘Aberglaube’, which cannot be captured in the English
translation. German words that are gesperrt are now generally italicized
in English translation, but Wittgenstein explicitly requested that
‘Superstition’ be left unitalicized.</p>
<p>5.1363 from a proposition’s being self-evident … its self-evidence:
daraus, dass ein Satz uns einleuchtet … das Einleuchten. Here ‘uns
einleuchtet’ literally means ‘is clear to us’ or ‘is evident to us’.</p>
<p>5.143 the empty point at their centre: ihr substanzloser
Mittelpunkt.</p>
<p>5.154 factum: Faktum. ‘Fact’ is used throughout this translation to
render ‘Tatsache’ and only ‘Tatsache’, which has a (semi-)technical
meaning for Wittgenstein and which he did not use here.</p>
<p>5.156 extract: Auszug.</p>
<p>5.43 is surely hard to believe: ist doch von vornherein kaum zu
glauben. In his comments on the original translation here, Wittgenstein
wrote: ‘“von vornherein” doesn’t mean “a priori” but something like
“from the very beginning” but here you had better leave it out
al〈l〉together’ (LO, p. 31). Cf. the note to 4.411 above.</p>
<p>primitive propositions: Grundgesetze, lit., basic laws. ‘Primitive
propositions’ is the term that Russell uses (see esp. Principia
Mathematica, *1), but ‘basic laws’ would also be an appropriate
translation in this context, alluding to Frege’s Grundgesetze der
Arithmetik, since both Frege and Russell are being discussed here. Cf.
5.452, where ‘primitive propositions’ is also used, and 6.127, where
‘basic laws’ is used instead: see the note to 6.127 below.</p>
<p>5.45 occurrence: Dasein.</p>
<p>5.451 what Frege said … primitive signs. See G. Frege, Grundgesetze
der Arithmetik (Jena: H. Pohle, vol. I 1893, vol. II 1903), I, §33; II,
§§58 ff.; tr. in M. Beaney, ed., The Frege Reader (Oxford: Blackwell,
1997), 222–3, 260 ff.</p>
<p>5.452 in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica. See, for
example, A. N. Whitehead and B. Russell, Principia Mathematica
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1910–13; up to *56 repr. 1997),
94–7.</p>
<p>5.453 There are no pre-eminent numbers. See the note to 4.128
above.</p>
<p>5.454 juxtaposition: Nebeneinander, lit., next to one another. What
Wittgenstein is rejecting is any kind of genus/species differentiation
in logic, as the second sentence of 5.454 makes clear.</p>
<p>5.4541 simplex sigillum veri. The Latin means ‘simplicity is the sign
of truth’.</p>
<p>5.4733 constructed: gebildete. The verb ‘bilden’ is translated
throughout the 5s from this point on as ‘construct’. Elsewhere, with one
exception (4.002), it is translated as ‘form’ (see the Glossary).</p>
<p>5.501 fixing: Festsetzung. See the note to 3.316 above.</p>
<p>5.511 hooks and manipulations: Haken und Manipulationen.</p>
<p>5.521 separate = trenne. Wittgenstein comments on this in responding
to a question from Ogden: ‘I mean “separate” and not derive’. They were
connected and I separate them’ (LO, pp. 61, 65).</p>
<p>5.53 Identity … identity sign. Gleichheit = identity;
Gleichheitszeichen = identity sign. Elsewhere Wittgenstein talks of
‘Identität’, not ‘Gleichheit’ (as in 5.5301, which immediately follows;
see the Glossary). Presumably, preferring ‘Gleichheit’ here is to make
the connection with his use of ‘Gleichheitszeichen’; but it shows that
he treats ‘Identität’ and ‘Gleichheit’ (‘equality’) as synonymous (as
did Frege).</p>
<p>5.5351 Thus Russell … propositions. See B. Russell, The Principles of
Mathematics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1903), e.g. §§16,
41.</p>
<p>5.552 that such and such is the case: daß sich etwas so und so
verhält. See the note to 4.5 above.</p>
<p>5.553 There is no pre-eminent number. See the note to 4.128
above.</p>
<p>5.5542 what must there be in order that something can be-the-case?:
was muß sein, damit etwas der-Fall-sein kann? Wittgenstein’s own hyphens
have been retained here.</p>
<p>5.5563 All propositions … logical order. Wittgenstein explained this
key idea as follows: ‘By this I meant to say that the prop[ositions]s of
our ordinary language are not in any way logically less correct or less
exact or more confused than prop[ositions]s written down, say, in
Russell[’]s symbolism or any other “Begriffsschrift”. (Only it is easier
for us to gather their logical form when they are expressed in an
appropriate symbolism’ (LO, p. 50; cf. p. 53).</p>
<p>5.62 means: meint.</p>
<p>That the world … limits of my world: Daß die Welt meine Welt ist, das
zeigt sich darin, daß die Grenzen der Sprache (der Sprache, die allein
ich verstehe) die Grenzen meiner Welt bedeuten. There has been much
debate about the supposed ambiguity that hinges on the role of ‘allein’.
Does Wittgenstein mean ‘the only language that I understand’ or ‘the
language that only I understand’? Pears and McGuinness translated the
bracketed phrase as ‘of that language which alone I understand’, which
preserves something of the ambiguity, though suggests more the second
reading. Arguably, though, neither reading expresses Wittgenstein’s
meaning. Ramsey and Ogden translated the phrase as ‘the language which I
understand’, which may look as if it just omits the problematic
‘allein’, but which rather neatly captures the sense of ‘allein’ in the
italicized ‘the’. We know that Wittgenstein checked the translation of
5.62, because he comments (twice) on the first sentence (see LO, pp. 34,
44, 50, 53); but he raised no objections to the translation of this
third sentence. However, ‘the language which I understand’ reads
slightly oddly in English, so it has been simplified here, using the
demonstrative ‘that’ to single out the language I understand. In
referring to ‘the limits of language’, Wittgenstein is ‘only’ referring
to the language I understand, not ‘language in general’, as someone
might (mis)construe it.</p>
<p>5.631 There is no thinking, representing subject: Das denkende,
vorstellende, Subjekt gibt es nicht. A ‘vorstellendes Subjekt’ would be
a subject who has ‘Vorstellungen’ (representations, ideas). The allusion
here is to Schopenhauer’s work, The World as Will [Wille] and
Representation [Vorstellung].</p>
<p>5.6331 There has been a lot of controversy about the diagram here. In
virtually all editions of the Tractatus, from the original German
version and its first translation onwards, the eye is represented by a
small circle within the supposed visual field, albeit at its tapered
‘origin’. In fact, as is clear from Wittgenstein’s correspondence with
Ogden (LO, p. 20) and the manuscript sources, he intended it to be a
small circle outside the visual field, but connected so that the visual
field appears to spread out from the eye. Wittgenstein’s correction was
never made, however. (For the manuscript evidence, see L. Bazzocchi, ‘A
Significant “False Perception” of Wittgenstein’s Draft on Mind’s Eye’,
Acta Analytica, 29 (2014), 255–66.) Arguably, Wittgenstein’s point was
not (simply) the illegitimacy of taking the eye to be part of the visual
field, but of seeing the whole ‘form’ of the visual field as a bounded
space with some kind of ‘origin’ in an eye. (Cf. his claim in 6.4311
that ‘our visual field is limitless’.) This may account for why he did
not press Ogden—and later Ramsey—to correct the picture, as the exact
position of the eye, as long as it was recognizably at the ‘origin’ of
the visual field, was less important than the overall ‘form’ that the
visual field supposedly had.</p>
<p>6.111 the logical proposition. Here ‘jener Satz’, which literally
means ‘that proposition’, is translated as ‘the logical proposition’, to
make clear what is presumably the reference, the proposition ‘every
proposition is either true or false’.</p>
<p>6.121 zero-method: Nullmethode. Wittgenstein explains this as
follows: ‘“Nullmethode” in German is an expression used in physics;
when—for instance—you measure an electric resistance by regulating
another resistance until〈l〉 the galvanometer points to 0 again we call
this a “Nullmethode”. Now there is sure to be an English word for it;
but is it “null-method”? It should rather be “zero-method” but I don’t
know’ (LO, p. 34).</p>
<p>6.124 only the latter expresses: drückt nur dieses aus. This sounds
as (slightly) odd in German as it does in English. Wittgenstein explains
what he means in what immediately follows.</p>
<p>the nature of the absolutely necessary signs itself speaks: sagt die
Natur der naturnotwendigen Zeichen selbst aus. It is not easy to capture
in English the double use of ‘Natur’ here, nor the meaning of ‘sagt …
selbst aus’. Cf. the previous note and the first note to 6.53 below.</p>
<p>6.127 basic laws. Here ‘Grundgesetze’ is translated as ‘basic laws’,
as Frege is referred to in what follows, rather than ‘primitive
propositions’, which is Russell’s term. Cf. the note to 5.43 above.</p>
<p>6.13 Logic … the world. Lehre = set of teachings; Spiegelbild =
mirror image. On ‘Lehre’, cf. the note to 4.112 above, where philosophy
is characterized in the same way.</p>
<p>6.232 Frege says … sense. Frege distinguished between ‘Sinn’ and
‘Bedetung’ in his famous paper ‘Über Sinn und Bedeutung’ (1892). The
Bedeutung of an expression is what it denotes or refers to (an object in
the case of names, a concept or function in the case of concept-words or
function-terms, a truth-value in the case of sentences/propositions).
The Sinn of an expression is the ‘mode of determination’
(‘Bestimmungsweise’) or ‘mode of presentation’ (‘Art des Gegebenseins’)
of its Bedeutung. ‘Sinn’ is unproblematically rendered as ‘sense’, but
the translation of ‘Bedeutung’ has proved highly controversial (see M.
Beaney, ‘Translating “Bedeutung” in Frege’s Writings’, in P. Ebert and
M. Rossberg (eds.), Essays on Frege’s Basic Laws of Arithmetic (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2019), 603–51). Since ‘Bedeutung’ has generally
been rendered as ‘meaning’ in this translation of the Tractatus,
‘Bedeutung’ is also used here.</p>
<p>6.2322 in knowing their meaning, I know whether = indem ich ihre
Bedeuting kenne, weiss ich, ob. Both ‘kennen’ and ‘wissen’ here are
translated as ‘know’. Cf. the notes to 2.0123 and 4.243 above.</p>
<p>6.233 intuition: Anschauung. ‘Anschauung’ is a tricky term to
translate into English, but ‘intuition’ is appropriate here as
Wittgenstein is referring to a debate that is indeed described by
talking of ‘intuition’. In his answer to the question he raises,
followed up in 6.2331, however, he could be seen as subtly
(recommending) changing the meaning of ‘intuition’ by playing more on
other aspects of the meaning of ‘Anschauung’. Cf. the translation of
‘anschaulich’ as ‘perspicuous’ in 6.1203.</p>
<p>6.2341 self-explanatory: sich von selbst verstehen. The German phrase
has arguably two main meanings, one of which might be captured as
‘self-evident’ (as used in the Ramsey–Ogden translation), and the other
as ‘go without saying’ (as used in the Pears–McGuinness translation),
where there might be some implicit—but external—norm. The former does
not fit with Wittgenstein’s talk of a method here, and the norm
presupposed by mathematics is internal, not external; so it has been
translated here as ‘self-explanatory’, which has something of both
meanings. Interestingly, in the draft typescript on which Wittgenstein
added comments, ‘self-intelligible’ is used (LO, p. 54+vii); it is
unclear when and by whom this was changed to ‘self-evident’. The phrase
is also used in 3.334.</p>
<p>6.3 regularity: Gesetzmäßigkeit. The allusion is to Hertz: see the
note to 6.361 below.</p>
<p>6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law. In the
only footnote added to the Ramsey–Ogden translation (other than the one
about the numbering system right at the beginning), we find this remark:
‘I.e. not the form of one particular law, but of any law of a certain
sort (B. R.)’. The ‘B. R.’ shows that it was Bertrand Russell who added
this. It is somewhat bizarre that this was the only one he selected for
explanation in the text!</p>
<p>6.3431 Through their whole logical apparatus: Durch den ganzen
logischen Apparat. This is hard to translate, but Wittgenstein insisted
on ‘through’: ‘Instead of “throughout” it must be “through”. The word is
used here in the same sense as when I say “I speak through a tube” or “I
hear his voice through the wall” etc.’ (LO, p. 35).</p>
<p>6.361 regular connections: gesetzmäßige Zusammenhänge. The use of
‘gesetzmäßige’ picks up on ‘Gesetz’ (‘law’) in 6.36, so ‘law-governed’
might be an appropriate translation, but Wittgenstein (LO, p. 35) wanted
its rendering to reflect the standard English translation in Hertz’s
Principles of Mechanics (see the reference to this in the note to 4.04
above). ‘Regular’ keeps the connotation of being ‘regulated’ by
‘rules’.</p>
<p>6.372 People thus stop … as if they were sacrosanct: So bleiben sie
bei den Naturgesetzen als bei etwas Unantastbarem stehen. In criticizing
the choice of ‘hold fast to’ in Ramsey’s original translation,
Wittgenstein wrote: ‘it should be something like: “So people stop at the
natural laws as at something …”. The prop[osition] means that people
don’t enquire any further, their investigations STOP there as if they
now had explained everything’ (LO, p. 35).</p>
<p>6.421 cannot be stated: nicht aussprechen läßt. The verb
‘aussprechen’ is also translated as ‘state’ in 3.221, 4.116, and 6.5.
Cf. 3.262, where ‘spell out’ is used, and 6.522. See the relevant notes
to these.</p>
<p>6.423 bearer of the ethical: Träger des Ethischen. ‘Träger’ can mean
‘responsible agent’, so the phrase could be translated, more fully, as
‘bearer of responsibility for the ethical’.</p>
<p>6.4311 experienced: erlebt. There is play on ‘Leben’ (‘life’) and
‘erlebt’.</p>
<p>6.4312 Not only … space and time. Wittgenstein admitted the
difficulties in translating this paragraph. He explained what he meant
by the first sentence as follows: ‘If for instance one tries to prove a
proposition in Physics we make certain assumptions and hope that they
will do our business, i.e. that they will prove the point in question,
i.e. that from them our proposition will follow. Now if we find that it
doesn’t follow then what we will say about our assumptions is exactly
what I tried to express. I think one would say something like: “These
assumptions will not do our business” or “they will not prove what we
tried to prove with them”’ (LO, pp. 35–6). He also remarks on the
difficulty in translating ‘Rätsel’, noting that it has two meanings in
German, an ordinary meaning, as illustrated in questions such as ‘Why is
a raven like a writing desk?’, and a ‘higher meaning’, as he puts it, as
when we talk of ‘das Rätsels des Lebens’. He asks Ogden: ‘Now do you use
“riddle” in this second sense also? IF SO, IT IS QUITE RIGHT. Only I
don’t w〈h〉ish that there should be anything ridiculous or profane or
frivolous in the word when used in the connection “riddle of life” etc.’
(LO, p. 36). ‘Riddle’ does indeed have these two meanings in English,
too, so is an appropriate translation. Wittgenstein also uses the
adjective ‘rätselhaft’ in this paragraph, but this has been translated
as ‘mysterious’, since ‘riddlesome’ would be inappropriate, not least in
having rather less of the ‘higher meaning’.</p>
<p>6.5 stated: aussprechen. Cf. 3.221, 4.116, and 6.421, where ‘state’
is also used; 3.262, which has ‘spell out’; and 6.522: see the relevant
notes.</p>
<p>the riddle. Wittgenstein insisted that ‘the’ be italicized and not
just ‘riddle’, commenting that ’It means as much as “the riddle ‘par
excellence’” (LO, p. 37).</p>
<p>6.521 the meaning of life: der Sinn des Lebens.</p>
<p>6.522 There is, though, the ineffable: Es gibt allerdings
Unaussprechliches. ‘Unaussprechliches’ comes from ‘aussprechen’, which
has generally been translated as ‘state’, with the exception of 3.262,
which has ‘spell out’ (see the relevant note above).</p>
<p>6.53 to say nothing except what can be said, that is, propositions of
natural science = Nichts zu sagen, als was sich sagen lässt, also Sätze
der Naturwissenschaft. The phrase ‘was sich sagen lässt’ is most
naturally translated into English as ‘what can be said’, but it
literally means ‘what lets itself say’, illustrating what grammarians
call the ‘middle’ or ‘medium’ voice—as opposed to the ‘active’ or
‘passive’ voice. Recognizing this makes better sense of how Wittgenstein
goes on, in suggesting that what let themselves say are the propositions
of natural science. If he had strictly meant ‘what cannot be said’, he
could have written ‘was gesagt werden kann’ (a construction he uses, for
example, in 4.1212). The middle voice is arguably present, in slightly
different forms, at various points in the Tractatus—for example, in
talking in 6.124 of what ‘expresses’ or ‘itself speaks’ in logic
(cf. the notes to 6.124 above). For detailed discussion, in relation to
the whole idea of ‘showing’, see J.-P. Narboux, ‘Showing, the Medium
Voice, and the Unity of the Tractatus’, Philosophical Topics, 42.2
(2014), 201–62.</p>
<p>whenever someone else … their propositions. This is the first time in
the Tractatus (interesting in itself) in which ‘er’ is used as a generic
third-person singular pronoun (as opposed to being used to refer to a
particular person, such as Russell in 3.331). It is translated here (and
in 6.54) by the generic third-person pronoun ‘they’, which also has a
long-established use as a singular and not just a plural pronoun,
despite false claims (often by those with a sexist agenda) that this is
ungrammatical. (Consider e.g. ‘Every philosopher knows their
Wittgenstein’.) But some generic singular uses of ‘they’ are more
natural than others, although those others are becoming more natural as
more writers avoid unnecessarily gendered language. Wittgenstein almost
certainly had mainly (and perhaps only) men in mind here, but that is no
reason for accentuating the gendering in English, when English has the
resources for avoiding it and is not generally such a gendered language
as German. So ‘they’ and ‘them’ have been used here for ‘er’, ‘ihn’, and
‘ihm’.</p>
<p>6.54 My propositions elucidate when …: Meine Sätze erläutern dadurch,
daß … Ramsey’s original translation of this had run ‘My propositions are
explained in that …’, which Wittgenstein changed to ‘My propositions
elucidate in this way that …’. Ogden then suggested replacing
‘elucidate’ by ‘are elucidated’, on the ground that ‘elucidate’ does not
have an intransitive use (LO, pp. 54, 54+viii). Wittgenstein replied as
follows: ‘Here you misunderstand my meaning entirely. I didn’t mean to
use “elucidate” intransitive[ly]: what I meant to say was: My
prop[osition]s elucidate—whatever they do elucidate—in this way: etc.
Similarly I might have said “My prop[osition]s clarify in this way …”
meaning “My prop[osition]s clarify whatever they do clarify—say, the
prop[osition]s of natural science—in this way: …”. Here clarify is not
used intransitive[ly] al〈l〉though the object is not mentioned. You may
put it thus: “My prop[osition]s elucidate philosophic matters in this
way: …”. This is something like the right meaning. Or “My prop[osition]s
are elucidations in this way: …” but this I suppose is bad. If nothing
better is suggested and my first way of putting it real[l]y won’t do add
“philosophic matters” as above’ (LO, p. 51). Ogden changed ‘elucidate’
to ‘are elucidatory’, so that the published version became: ‘My
propositions are elucidatory in this way: …’. The present translation
stays closer to Wittgenstein’s formulation in German and his original
suggestion in English but simplifying by replacing ‘in this way’ by
‘when’, since ‘elucidate’ seems to work exactly like ‘erläutern’ does:
in its ‘intransitive’ use there is an implicit object, and it is the
propositions themselves that are being said to do the elucidating, as
opposed to just having the property of being ‘elucidatory’. It is also
worth noting that Wittgenstein does not question here the translation of
‘Sätze’ by ‘propositions’. Given that ‘philosophical propositions’ are
to be recognized as nonsensical, on his view, it might be recommended
that we translate ‘Sätze’ by ‘sentences’ instead. But perhaps the very
use of ‘propositions’ here is precisely one of those things that he goes
on to say we must ‘get over’; indeed, it is surely symbolic of what it
is we have to get over to ‘see the world correctly’.</p>
<p>6.54 They must get over these propositions, and then they see the
world correctly. überwinden = get over. ‘Er’ has again been translated
here as ‘they’ (see the second note to 6.53 above). It is obvious that
‘they’ does not refer to Wittgenstein’s propositions.</p>
<p>7 Of what one cannot speak, about that one must be silent: Wovon man
nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen. This was translated by
Ramsey and Ogden as ‘Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent’, which has become canonical, though it is too archaic for the
present translation. What it literally says is ‘Of what one cannot
speak, about that one must be silent’, which might be rephrased as ‘Of
what one cannot speak, one must be silent about’ or ‘About what one
cannot speak of, one must be silent’, but none of these seem elegant
enough for the concluding proposition of what is a carefully crafted
work. ‘About that of which one cannot speak, one must be silent’ might
seem better, but the ‘that’ suggests a definiteness, of what it is that
one cannot speak of, which is absent in the German (it prompts the
question as to what exactly it is). Pears and McGuinness translated it
as ‘What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence’, which is a
neat way of avoiding a dangling preposition as the very last word, or
two prepositions in the first clause, although there is no sense of
‘passing over’ in the German and ‘of’ is arguably better than ‘about’
here. Wittgenstein also uses ‘man’ rather than ‘wir’, which he could
have chosen had he wanted to be less impersonal and more inclusive.
After all, he has just said a lot, so it seems, about what cannot be
spoken of, on his view, so it would be ironic if he were then to say
that we (including him) must be silent. Perhaps he was deliberately
being ironic, but making him say ‘we’ to reflect this would be injecting
an interpretation into the translation.</p>
<p>A looser rendering would be ‘Where one cannot speak, one must be
silent’, leaving the reference of ‘where’ to be indicated by the
context, in other words, as—arguably, at least partly—referring back to
‘the ineffable’ mentioned in 6.522. This suggests another possible
translation: ‘About the ineffable one must be silent’. But this would
also be injecting an interpretation into the translation, even more
explicitly. If we were to allow the back reference (or references) to be
merely implied, however, then the final proposition could be transformed
into something more appropriately aphoristic: ‘Where speaking is
impossible, silence is imperative.’ But this sacrifices some
faithfulness for fluency (and a literary style that is not really
Wittgenstein’s), and it is better to end on either ‘silent’ or ‘silence’
than on an imperious-sounding ‘imperative’.</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness’s translation ended on ‘silence’, so we could
revisit their strategy and amend in line with the points just made:
using ‘of’ rather than ‘about’ and the passive construction to capture
the more impersonal use of ‘man’, and replacing ‘pass over’ by a
different verb, ideally one that is as neutral as possible. One
possibility here would be ‘accept’, yielding ‘What cannot be spoken of
must be accepted in silence’. But even ‘accept’ draws some attention to
itself and is not in the German: it is not itself ‘silent’ on the
attitude we should take to what cannot be spoken of. If we were tempted
to interpret Wittgenstein here, though, then ‘respect’ or ‘acknowledge’
might be appropriate. ‘What cannot be spoken of must be acknowledged in
silence’ is arguably better than Pears and McGuinness’s rendering. But
all of these involve interpretation, and this should especially be
avoided in the case of proposition 7, not just because it is the final,
dramatic conclusion, but also because there has been so much controversy
over the issues it raises.</p>
<p>Can we find a solution to these problems of translation by
considering the corresponding remark in Wittgenstein’s preface? In
stating what the whole sense of the book is, he first says that ‘what
can be said at all can be said clearly’ (was sich überhaupt sagen läßt,
läßt sich klar sagen), and then adds ‘wovon man nicht reden kann,
darüber muß man schweigen’. This is exactly proposition 7, but with
‘reden’ instead of ‘sprechen’. So Wittgenstein is clearly treating
‘reden’ and ‘sprechen’ as synonyms. But ‘sagen’ (‘say’) is also a member
of the cluster of verbs concerned with ‘speaking’, and can be used as a
synonym in certain contexts. Here it would have the advantage that it
does not need a preposition (‘of’ or ‘about’), so we could avoid any
problem of a dangling preposition or too many prepositions.
Wittgenstein’s use of ‘reden’ in his preface might be seen as just a
stylistic variant (fitting the aphoristic structure of ‘wovon … darüber
…’), and the following might therefore sound perfectly natural in
English here: ‘what can be said at all can be said clearly; and about
what cannot be said, one must be silent’. So could we simply adopt this,
too, for proposition 7? The problem, though, is that ‘what cannot be
said’ does not mean the same as ‘what cannot be spoken (or talked) of’,
although it is not easy to say what the subtle differences are (as
Wittgenstein seems to understand the relevant terms)! In 4.1212 he
writes: ‘What can be shown cannot be said.’ This does not say that what
cannot be said can be shown, but some at least of what cannot be said
can be shown. And what is shown is shown through language. (See
e.g. 4.115, 4.121.) So Wittgenstein cannot be taken as recommending that
we must simply be silent about what cannot be said. In any case the
phrase that is translated in the preface as ‘what can be said’ is not
‘was gesagt werden kann’ but ‘was sich sagen läßt’, which literally
means ‘what lets itself be said’. But rephrasing our suggested
translation of the second clause accordingly as ‘about what does not let
itself be said, one must be silent’ would yield a very strange remark.
The contrast between ‘what can be said’ and ‘what cannot be said’ in the
suggested English translation would not capture the actual German. So
here, too, we encounter problems.</p>
<p>After considering all the options, then, the only solution is to keep
the translation as literal as possible. Avoiding the archaic terms
‘whereof’ and ‘thereof’, and either dangling prepositions or two
prepositions in the first clause, leaves just one option: ‘Of what one
cannot speak, about that one must be silent’. The present translation,
throughout, has aimed to maximize both faithfulness and fluency, staying
as close as possible to what Wittgenstein actually says while rendering
it in (modern) English as clearly and naturally as possible. Some
fluency and elegance may sometimes have to be sacrificed for
faithfulness, as in this case, but at least we preserve here the rhythm
and symmetry of the ‘wovon … darüber …’ construction, and the German
original is directly echoed. Where translation is tricky, though,
explanation is expected (and speaking imperative). The final proposition
of the Tractatus provides an instructive case study in the problems of
translation and interpretation. Here, at the end, it is only right to
remind the reader that a translation is only a ladder to understanding
the original text and that there is value in considering variant forms
of expression.</p>
