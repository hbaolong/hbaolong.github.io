<h4 id="influences-on-wittgenstein">2. Influences on Wittgenstein</h4>
<p>In 1931 Wittgenstein wrote in his notebook of the influences upon
him:</p>
<p>I think there is some truth in my idea that I am really only
reproductive in my thinking. I think I have never invented a line of
thinking but that it was always provided for me by someone else
andandandand I have done no more than passionately taken it up for my
work of clarification. That is how Boltzmann, Hertz, Schopenhauer,
Frege, Russell, Kraus, Loos, Weininger, Spengler, Sraffa have influenced
me. (CV, p. 16)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein does not do justice here to his own creativity but the
list of influences is revealing. He had originally just written ‘Frege,
Russell, Spengler, Sraffa’, but then added the other names above the
line. Oswald Spengler (1880–1936), through his main work, The Decline of
the West, published in two volumes in 1918 and 1922, only influenced him
after the Tractatus was finished, and Piero Sraffa (1898–1983) only
influenced him on his return to Cambridge in 1929. As far as the
Tractatus is concerned, Wittgenstein’s greatest debt is undoubtedly to
Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) and Bertrand Russell (1882–1970), both of whom
he singles out in his preface to the Tractatus. Here he did indeed
passionately take up their lines of thinking in his work of
clarification. We will consider the influence of Frege and Russell in
turn,5 before looking, much more briefly, at the influence of Heinrich
Hertz (1857–94), Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), and Arthur Schopenhauer
(1788–1860).</p>
<p>2.1. Frege’s Influence</p>
<p>Frege is one of the main founders of modern logic—of what is now
known as predicate or quantificational logic, a form of logic
(understood here as logical theory) that quickly proved to be far more
powerful than traditional logic, which had combined (Aristotelian)
syllogistic theory and (Stoic) propositional logic. Propositional logic,
which is now seen as more basic, and on which Frege also built, concerns
the logical relations between propositions, represented as ‘p’, ‘q’,
‘r’, etc., and their logical compounds, propositions combined by means
of one or more logical connectives, such as ‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if …
then …’, yielding ‘not p’, ‘p and q’, ‘p or q’, ‘if p, then q’, and so
on. Here is just a sample of the logical relations that obtain between
such propositions and their compounds. The conjunctive proposition ‘p
and q’, for example, implies the disjunctive proposition ‘p or q’
(though not vice versa), which we can represent as the conditional
proposition ‘If p and q, then p or q’. ‘If p, then q’ is equivalent to
‘if not q, then not p’ (its contrapositive), and ‘p and q’ is equivalent
to ‘not (not p or not q)’, showing the interdefinability of the logical
connectives. The various relations can be formulated as logical laws.
For example, ‘not (p and not p)’ is the law (or principle) of
non-contradiction: a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.
‘p or not p’ is the law of excluded middle: of any proposition, either
it or its negation is true. It is natural to think that logical laws
tell us something, but one of Wittgenstein’s most important claims in
the Tractatus is that logical propositions (logical laws and all that
follows from them) are senseless, a claim that was seen as clarifying
their status (see below).</p>
<p>Syllogistic theory is concerned with the logical relations between
four specific kinds of proposition, ‘All As are Bs’, ‘No As are Bs’,
‘Some As are Bs’, and ‘Some As are not Bs’, where ‘A’ and ‘B’ represent
the relevant predicate (what is being attributed to something), and
‘all’, no’, and ‘some’ are quantifier terms, stating how much of
something is under consideration. Here again there are logical relations
to make explicit: ‘All As are Bs’ implies ‘Some As are Bs’, for example,
while contradicting ‘Some As are not Bs’ (as Aristotle construed these).
While traditional logic gave a coherent account of these kinds of
proposition, however, it had difficulty handling propositions with more
than one quantifier, such as ‘All philosophers respect some logician’.
Frege’s achievement was to invent a notation for quantification that
enabled him to formalize propositions involving multiple
quantification.</p>
<p>Frege’s key move lay in extending function–argument analysis from
mathematics to logic. In analytic geometry, in representing a line as y
= ax + b, we exhibit y as a function of x, where x represents the
argument of the function and a and b are constants, a being the gradient
of the line and b the point where the line cuts the y-axis on a graph.
If a = 2 and b = 3, for example, then we have the function y = 2x + 3:
for argument x = 1, the value of the function is 5; for x = 2, y = 7,
and so on. Frege generalized the idea: not just mathematical equations
but all propositions can be analysed in function–argument terms. Take
the simplest kind of proposition, ascribing a predicate to a subject,
such as ‘Gottlob is human’. Traditional logic had analysed this as
having the form ‘S is P’, with ‘S’ representing the subject (‘Gottlob’)
and ‘P’ the predicate (‘human’), connected by the copula (‘is’). Frege,
however, analysed it as having the form ‘Fa’, with ‘a’ representing the
argument (‘Gottlob’) and ‘Fx’ the function (‘x is human’), the variable
x indicating where the argument term goes to complete the proposition.
‘Gottlob is human’ is thus taken to be the value of the functional
expression ‘x is human’ for the argument term ‘Gottlob’.</p>
<p>Relational propositions are analysed similarly, in this case as
functions of two or more arguments. In analysing ‘Gottlob is shorter
than Bertrand’, for example, ‘Gottlob’ and ‘Bertrand’ are taken as the
argument terms and ‘x is shorter than y’ as the relational expression,
symbolized as ‘Rxy’ or ‘xRy’. The power of function–argument analysis,
however, only fully comes out in analysing propositions involving
quantifiers. Take the proposition ‘All logicians are human’. In
traditional logic this was seen as having the same form as ‘Gottlob is
human’, the subject being ‘all logicians’ rather than ‘Gottlob’, and the
copula plural (‘are’) rather than singular (‘is’). But on Frege’s
analysis, it has a very different form, symbolized in modern notation as
‘(∀x) (Lx ⊃ Hx)’, read as ‘For all x, if x is a logician, then x is
human’. Here what we have are two functional expressions, ‘x is a
logician’ and ‘x is human’, joined by the logical connective ‘if … then
…’ (symbolized by ‘⊃’) and bound by the universal quantifier (‘for all
x’, represented using an inverted ‘A’). (In the notation that
Wittgenstein takes over from Russell, the universal quantifier is
symbolized simply by ‘(x)’ rather than ‘(∀x)’.6)</p>
<p>‘Some logicians are human’ is also analysed as having a more complex
quantificational form, symbolized in modern notation as ‘(∃x) (Lx
andandandand Hx)’, read as ‘There is some x such that x is a logician
and x is human’. Again what we have here are two functional expressions
joined by a logical connective, in this case ‘and’ (symbolized by
‘andandandand’) and bound by the existential quantifier (‘there is some
x’, represented using a backwards ‘E’). (In the notation that
Wittgenstein takes over from Russell, ‘and’ is symbolized by the full
stop ‘.’ rather than ‘andandandand’. ‘(∃x)’ is used for the existential
quantifier.) With such notation, propositions involving multiple
quantification can be formalized. ‘All philosophers respect some
logician’, for example, turns out to be ambiguous, depending on whether
we are claiming that there is some (at least one) logician whom every
philosopher respects or merely that, for any philosopher, there is some
logician whom they respect (not necessarily the same one).
Quantificational logic provides a neat way of clarifying this
ambiguity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>(∃y) (Ly andandandand (∀x) (Px ⊃ Rxy)).</p></li>
<li><p>(∀x) (Px ⊃ (∃y) (Ly andandandand Rxy)).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first can be read as ‘There is some y such that y is a logician
and for all x, if x is a philosopher, then x respects y’, and the second
as ‘For all x, if x is a philosopher, then there is some y such that y
is a logician and x respects y’. The difference in meaning is reflected
in the order of the quantifiers—either ∃∀ or ∀∃. Furthermore, their
logical relations are different, reflected in their asymmetry: while the
second can be inferred from the first, the first cannot be inferred from
the second (mistakenly thinking that it can is known as the quantifier
shift fallacy).</p>
<p>We see here an excellent example of the power of Frege’s logic. The
use of quantificational notation clarifies the relevant logical
relations and facilitates the drawing and testing of inferences. Frege
called the logical notation he created ‘Begriffsschrift’ (literally,
‘concept-script’), a term that Wittgenstein takes over in the Tractatus,
though he criticizes the precise form that Frege’s (and Russell’s)
notation took (see e.g. 3.325, 5.533). On Wittgenstein’s view, it is
only once ‘everything is in order in our sign-language’ that we attain a
correct logical conception (4.1213). So here, too, one can see him as
taking up in his work of clarification the line of thinking that Frege
invented.</p>
<p>In doing so, Wittgenstein also endorsed function–argument analysis:
‘I construe a proposition—like Frege and Russell—as a function of the
expressions contained in it’ (3.318). But once again, his own account of
this was rather different from theirs. For Frege, the most fundamental
logical relation was the relation of an object’s falling under a
concept, expressed in the most basic kind of thought we can have, such
as in thinking that Gottlob is human: applying the concept human,
understood as a function (‘x is human’), to the particular object named
Gottlob (the name filling the argument-place in the functional
expression). Wittgenstein left it open what the basic kinds of thoughts
were, however: this would be revealed by logical analysis. They might be
relational propositions of the form ‘Rxy’ or ‘Rxyz’ instead. But he
assumed that there was an ultimate level to be reached, comprising what
he called ‘elementary propositions’ (4.21), each understood as a
function of names (4.24). In elaborating on this, he drew on one of the
central ideas of the Tractatus, that a proposition should be seen as a
picture of a state of affairs (2.11 ff.). We will return to this in the
next section.</p>
<p>As to the relationship between elementary propositions and other,
more complex propositions, here, too, he saw a functional relationship:
‘A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions’ (5). He
elaborates this conception in the rest of the 5s (the remarks that
comment on 5), and we will return to this in §4. Once again, then, we
can see Wittgenstein as ‘clarifying’ the line of thinking opened up by
the possibility of function–argument analysis. At the root of this, for
Frege, was the fundamental logical relation of an object’s falling under
a concept, but we can see Wittgenstein as taking the more general idea
of a functional relation itself as the most fundamental.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s account of all this, as elaborated in the Tractatus,
was intended to overcome the various problems that he saw in Frege’s
logic and philosophy—and, as we will shortly see, also in Russell’s
logic and philosophy. Two of the key problems concern Frege’s
distinction between object and concept and what is now known as
Russell’s paradox. The latter will be taken up in discussing Russell’s
influence, so let us consider the first here. Frege regarded the
distinction between object and concept as absolute, characterizing it,
metaphorically, by describing objects as ‘saturated’ and concepts as
‘unsaturated’, reflecting the fact that while an object is represented
by a name, formalized by a letter such as ‘a’, a concept is represented
by a functional expression of the form ‘( ) is F’, where the gap
indicates the argument-place where the name goes, yielding the sentence
‘a is F’, formalized as ‘Fa’, representing the thought that a is F.
Names and concept-words (functional expressions) perform different
semantic roles, which Frege took to indicate an ontological distinction
between object and concept.</p>
<p>Notoriously, however, this distinction was not something that Frege
could formalize in his Begriffsschrift, which he had envisaged as
capable of expressing, in principle, every possible kind of thought. We
might suggest expressing the distinction in ordinary language by saying
‘No objects are concepts’ or, equivalently, ‘No concepts are objects’,
but attempting to formalize this, say, as ‘For all x, if x is an object,
then it is not the case that x is a concept’ (‘(∀x) (Ox ⊃ ~Cx)’,
symbolizing ‘not’ by ‘~’), presupposes that both names (of objects) and
concept-words can go in the argument-place (replacing the variable ‘x’)
in both ‘x is an object’ and ‘x is a concept’. But if ‘x’ is replaced by
a concept-word of the form ‘( ) is F’, then we get ‘( ) is F is an
object’ and ‘( ) is F is a concept’, neither of which is a well-formed
sentence (and would remain ill-formed even if the gap was filled, to
yield, say, ‘a is F is an object’ and ‘a is F is a concept’). So there
is a genuine problem in trying to state the distinction between object
and concept. (Objections might in turn be raised to how the foregoing
explanation is formulated, or to other attempts to state or explain the
distinction.)</p>
<p>The problem raised here is not just a problem for Frege or confined
to just one kind of statement. Wittgenstein recognized this early on in
his thinking. In the notes dictated to Moore in April 1914, he remarks:
‘In order that you should have a language which can express or say
everything that can be said, this language must have certain properties;
and when this is the case, that it has them can no longer be said in
that language or any language’ (NB, 108). In many ways we can see here
the whole project of the Tractatus: to try to say what these properties
are, while recognizing that—ultimately—they cannot be said at all. The
penultimate proposition (6.54) of the Tractatus is already anticipated.
Frege had tried to explain his distinction, on which he felt his whole
logic was based, but had himself realized the difficulties in doing
so—especially in his 1892 essay ‘On Concept and Object’, which
Wittgenstein knew well. In clarifying Frege’s line of thinking in this
case, Wittgenstein generalized the problem and attempted to address
it.</p>
<p>It is in these notes to Moore that he introduces (for the first time)
his key distinction between saying (sagen) and showing (zeigen). Indeed,
the notes open with the claim: ‘Logical so-called propositions show
[the] logical properties of language and therefore of [the] Universe,
but say nothing’ (NB, 108; cf. 6.12). It would be tempting to treat ‘No
objects are concepts’ as just such a logical proposition, showing the
distinction between object and concept that Frege took to underpin his
logical language. On Wittgenstein’s view, however, this temptation
should be resisted, since the concepts of object and of concept are what
he calls formal concepts, different from ‘real’ concepts such as the
concept human. Something is an object, for example, if it can be named
and fall under real concepts; and something is a real concept if it can
be represented by a functional expression and applied to objects.
Something is not an object or concept in virtue of falling under the
supposed concept of object or of concept, respectively. Formal concepts,
he held, were pseudo-concepts, and should not be confused with real
concepts (4.126–4.1274).</p>
<p>According to Wittgenstein, then, when we think it through, ‘No
objects are concepts’ turns out to be nonsense, although, in seeing how
this is so, we are led to recognize the roles that names and
concept-words play in our language, the difference between them being
shown in our different uses of the two kinds of expression.
Distinguishing—in his work of clarification—between formal and real
concepts may also help us in appreciating how many of the things we are
tempted to say in ‘explaining’ such apparent statements as ‘No objects
are concepts’ are problematic and, strictly speaking, nonsensical. (As
we will see, though, he does allow for a genuine category of ‘logical
propositions’, which he characterizes as senseless rather than
nonsensical.)</p>
<p>2.2. Russell’s Influence</p>
<p>Let us now turn to Russell’s influence, beginning with the paradox
that bears his name. This arose in the context of what is called Frege’s
logicist project: the attempt to demonstrate that arithmetic can be
reduced to logic. Frege’s invention of quantificational logic had been
the first step, enabling him to formalize mathematical propositions,
where multiple quantification is prevalent, as in ‘Every number has a
successor’, and give a logical analysis of mathematical reasoning, such
as mathematical induction. The next step was to define the natural
numbers, an informal account of which he gave in his philosophical
masterpiece, The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884).</p>
<p>The essential idea was to define numbers as classes or extensions of
concepts. What is called the extension of a concept is the class or set
of things that fall under that concept. Under the concept human, for
example, fall Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, etc. All of these objects
(people) are members of the class of humans—the extension of the concept
human. According to Frege, this class is itself a kind of object, not a
‘concrete’ (empirical, spatio-temporal) object but an ‘abstract’
object—in this case a logical object, since the idea of a class had
traditionally been seen as a logical notion. The task was then to find
suitable logical concepts. Again, traditionally, two of the most
fundamental concepts of logic are the concepts of identity and of
negation. Take the concept of identity, or more precisely, the concept
of being identical with itself. (Wittgenstein came to reject this
conception of identity (5.53 ff.), but Frege—and Russell—accepted it.)
Every object is identical with itself (so it might obviously seem), in
other words, every object falls under the concept identical with itself.
So the corresponding class has as its members all objects. Now let us
add the concept of negation to form the concept not identical with
itself. Nothing is not identical with itself. So the corresponding class
here has no members at all. This is what logicians call the ‘null
class’, and is here defined purely by means of logical concepts, as the
class of things that are not self-identical.</p>
<p>This null class can then be used to define the first of the natural
numbers, the number 0. The simplest definition is to identify the number
0 with the null class, as is done in modern set theory. Frege offers a
more complicated definition, identifying the number 0 with the class of
classes that have the same number of members as the null class, for
reasons that we need not go into here—except to note his appeal to a
class of classes, which we will pick up shortly. Let us accept the
simplest definition. We can then form the concept is identical with 0
(i.e. the concept is identical with the null class). Here the
corresponding class has just one member, namely, 0 (the null class
itself). This class (the class of things that are identical with 0) is
distinct from its sole member (0, i.e. the null class), since the former
has one member and the latter has no members, so we can identify the
number 1 with this class (the class of things that are identical with
0). We now have two objects, and can then form the concept is identical
with 0 or 1 (using the additional logical concept of disjunction). This
gives us a corresponding class which we can identify with the number 2,
and so on. Starting with the null class, then, and using only logical
concepts, we can define all the natural numbers.</p>
<p>The strategy is ingenious. What could possibly go wrong? Let us
identify two of the key assumptions. First, there is the principle that
for every concept, there is a class of things that fall under it. (If
nothing falls under it, then there is still a class—the null class.)
Second, there is the assumption that classes are themselves objects, in
which case they can also be members of classes. All we need is a
relevant concept under which they fall. The concept class is one such
concept, which means that a class can be a member of itself, as indeed
the class of classes is.</p>
<p>These assumptions, however, lead to a contradiction. Consider the
class of humans. This class is not itself a human, so the class is not a
member of itself. Consider the class of non-humans. This class, too, is
not a human, but in this case it means that it is a member of itself. So
classes divide into those that are members of themselves and those that
are not members of themselves. Consider now the class of all classes
that are not members of themselves. Is this a member of itself or not?
If it is, then since it is the class of all classes that are not members
of themselves, it is not. If it is not, then since this is the defining
property of the classes it contains, it is. We have a contradiction.</p>
<p>This contradiction is now known as Russell’s paradox, since it was
Russell who discovered and first informed Frege of it in writing to him
in June 1902. Given that Frege had defined numbers in terms of
classes—and indeed, classes of classes, as noted above—determined by
logically legitimate concepts, Russell’s paradox was potentially
devastating. Frege recognized its seriousness immediately, and although
he tried to respond to it in the appendix to the second volume of his
Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1903), in which he had been trying to
demonstrate the logicist thesis formally, using his Begriffsschrift, it
soon led to his abandoning the logicist project. Russell, however,
persevered, and developed what he called the theory of types to resolve
it.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the intricacies of the theory as it was eventually
formulated in Principia Mathematica, which Russell wrote with A. N.
Whitehead (1861–1947), his former teacher and then colleague at
Cambridge, the essential idea is that there is a hierarchy of objects
and classes. At the most basic level, there are ‘genuine’
objects—objects such as humans, horses, apples, cups, pens, and so on.
At the next level, there are classes of objects—such as the class of
humans and the class of non-humans (which contains all those genuine
objects that are not humans). Then there are classes of classes of
objects, and so on up the hierarchy. The key point is that something at
any given level can only be a member of a class at the next level up.
This automatically rules out any class being a member of itself; so
Russell’s paradox cannot be generated.</p>
<p>In explaining his theory of types, however, Russell said just the
kinds of thing that Wittgenstein found problematic. Consider the
statement ‘No (genuine) objects are first-level classes’. This is just
as nonsensical as the statement ‘No objects are concepts’ considered
above, and for an analogous reason. To say that something is a
first-level class is to say that it is a member of the class of
first-level classes, but this latter class is a second-level class and
one cannot (sensefully) say or deny of any genuine object that it is a
member of a second-level class, only of a first-level class. In trying
to state the theory of types we violate the very type-restrictions it
encodes. In saying, for example, that ‘Gottlob (as an object) is not a
(first-level) class’, we appear to be saying something about the meaning
of the name ‘Gottlob’, that it (i.e. Gottlob himself) does not have the
property of being a (first-level) class. But this is not how to get
across the relevant type-restrictions, which are shown by our senseful
use of the relevant expressions (3.326). In 3.33 Wittgenstein writes:
‘In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role; it
must permit being drawn up without talk of the meaning of a sign; it
should presuppose only the description of the expressions.’ This gives
us insight, he immediately goes on to say, into Russell’s theory of
types: ‘Russell’s error is shown in his having to talk of the meaning of
signs in drawing up the rules for them’ (3.331).</p>
<p>The theory of types, however, was only one part of Russell’s response
to the paradox. The other main part was his theory of descriptions,
which was intended to address the problem of how definite descriptions,
that is, terms of the form ‘the F’, can contribute to the meaning and
truth-value of propositions in which they occur when they lack—or appear
to lack—a meaning themselves. ‘The class of all classes that are not
members of themselves’ seems meaningful and yet there can be no such
class. If classes are not genuine objects at all, as Russell came to
believe, then what do class terms refer to, and how do we manage to say
true or false things about classes? Analysis of our talk of classes is
clearly called for.</p>
<p>Let us consider Russell’s own famous example of a proposition
involving a definite description:</p>
<p>(K1) The present King of France is bald.</p>
<p>If we were to treat this as having the form ‘S is P’, in accord with
traditional subject–predicate analysis, then we would regard ‘the
present King of France’ as the subject term. But if there is no King of
France, then what is the proposition about? A non-existent object? An
object that has existence in some other sense, say, as ‘subsistence’?
How can we understand such a proposition if the subject term fails to
refer? Can it have a truth-value in such a case?</p>
<p>In ‘On Denoting’, published in 1905, Russell introduced his theory of
descriptions to answer these questions. On the account he offered
(reconstructed here), (K1) is analysed into a conjunction of the
following three propositions, each of which can be readily formalized in
quantificational logic (given in square brackets afterwards), with ‘K’
representing the concept King of France and ‘B’ the concept bald:</p>
<p>(Ka) There is at least one King of France. [(∃x) Kx]</p>
<p>(Kb) There is at most one King of France. [(∀x) (∀y) (Kx andandandand
Ky ⊃ y = x)]</p>
<p>(Kc) Whatever is King of France is bald. [(∀x) (Kx ⊃ Bx)]</p>
<p>Each of these constituent propositions has a quantificational
structure, and can be interpreted as saying something about a concept,
not an object. (Ka) says that the concept King of France is instantiated
(by at least one object), and (Kb) says that it is instantiated by at
most one object (roughly speaking, that were it to seem as if two
objects fell under the concept, then they would actually be the same
object). Taken together, (Ka) and (Kb) thus say that the concept King of
France is uniquely instantiated. (Kc) says that whatever instantiates
the concept King of France also instantiates the concept bald.</p>
<p>Putting all three together, we have:</p>
<p>(K2) There is one and only one King of France and whatever is King of
France is bald.</p>
<p>Formalizing this (and simplifying) yields:</p>
<p>(K3) (∃x) (Kx andandandand (∀y) (Ky ⊃ y = x) andandandand Bx).</p>
<p>This can then be interpreted as saying that the concept King of
France is uniquely instantiated and whatever instantiates this concept
also instantiates the concept bald.</p>
<p>With this analysis we can now answer our earlier questions. The
surface grammatical form of (K1) is misleading: it has a much more
complex logical form. It is not about a non-existent or subsistent
object, but about a concept; and all we need to grasp to understand the
proposition are the two relevant concepts, the concept King of France
and the concept bald, as well as the relevant logical ideas
(conjunction, implication, identity, and existential and universal
quantification). Where there is no King of France, that is, where the
subject term fails to refer, the first conjunct of the analysis—(Ka)—is
false, thereby making (K1) false. So (K1) still comes out as having a
truth-value.</p>
<p>Russell’s theory of descriptions has often been taken—rightly—as a
paradigm of analysis, although it arguably only offers a correct account
of certain uses of definite descriptions. Wittgenstein endorsed it in a
letter to Russell in late 1913: ‘your “Theory of Descriptions” is quite
CERTAINLY correct, even though the individual primitive signs in it are
not at all the ones you thought’ (WC, p. 59). Its philosophical
significance lies in the distinction it made explicit between
grammatical form and logical form. As Wittgenstein put it in the
Tractatus, ‘Russell’s merit is to have shown that the apparent logical
form of a proposition need not be its real one’ (4.0031). (K1) looks as
if it is a simple subject–predicate proposition, misleading us into
thinking that there is a King of France (or must exist in some sense if
we can talk about it), but it turns out to have a more complex,
quantificational structure. We understand it, not by knowing who the
present King of France is (since there is no such person), but by
understanding the relevant concepts—and the existential and universal
quantification involved.</p>
<p>Russell’s approach here had built on Frege’s analysis of number
statements. One of the central claims of Frege’s logicism was that a
number statement is an assertion about a concept.7 In saying that
Jupiter has four moons, for example, one is saying that the concept moon
of Jupiter has four instances,8 which can be readily formalized in
quantificational logic. We can adopt a similar approach in analysing our
talk of classes. Consider the following simple example:</p>
<p>(C1) The class of logicians is a subclass of the class of humans.</p>
<p>Do classes have to ‘exist’ for (C1) to be true? Not at all, on
Russell’s view, since this can be seen as equivalent to, and hence
analysed as (on the lines of (Kc) above), the following:</p>
<p>(C2) Whatever falls under the concept logician falls under the
concept human. [(∀x) (Lx ⊃ Hx)]</p>
<p>(C1), in other words, is just another way of saying that all
logicians are humans, and what (C2) makes clear is that we understand
such a proposition by grasping the concepts logician and human together
with the relevant logical concepts. Classes, on Russell’s view, are
logical fictions, formed from more basic logical concepts in accordance
with certain logical principles. The details need not concern us further
here.</p>
<p>Russell’s theory of descriptions, as well as the analyses that Frege
and Russell provided of mathematical propositions, opened up the
possibility of a whole programme of analysis, ‘reducing’ propositions
that might puzzle or mislead us in one way or another to more basic
propositions whose understanding is (supposedly) less problematic.
Russell called the most basic propositions of all ‘atomic propositions’,
and Wittgenstein called them ‘elementary propositions’. The project of
logical atomism, as it came to be called, was thus to clarify both the
nature of these basic propositions and the process by which complex
propositions were formed from them. This was the main task of
clarification that Wittgenstein took up in response to the lines of
thinking opened up by Frege and Russell, convinced as he soon became
that it was only by doing this that he could show what was wrong with
Russell’s paradox.</p>
<p>2.3. The Influence of Hertz, Boltzmann, and Schopenhauer</p>
<p>There are three others on Wittgenstein’s list of 1931 who also had an
influence on the ideas of the Tractatus, and they deserve mention here
as well. Of the three, only Hertz’s name appears in the Tractatus—in
4.04 and 6.361. Hertz was a German physicist whose key work, The
Principles of Mechanics Presented in a New Form, was published
posthumously in 1894, which Wittgenstein may have come across at school
and would certainly have been familiar with while studying engineering
in Berlin and Manchester. Hertz conceived scientific theories as
pictorial representations or models, and laid down three criteria for
their acceptability: logical permissibility, correctness, and
appropriateness.9 Hertz’s ‘picture theory’ helped shape Wittgenstein’s
own account of pictures, although it is hard to say exactly how, since
Hertz is only named once in this context. The third criterion is
mentioned under the characterization ‘logical multiplicity’ in 4.04,
where Wittgenstein refers to Hertz’s Mechanics.</p>
<p>Hertz’s influence is much more visible in the 6.3s, where the idea of
different forms of describing the world is considered. Hertz had
discussed three different systems of mechanics, including the one he
advocated. His proposed system replaced Newton’s laws with a single
fundamental law, together with a hypothesis of invisible masses, from
which the rest of mechanics could be derived.10 There is an allusion to
this in 6.343, without mention of either Hertz or his hypothesis (though
they are mentioned in the notebook entry from which this remark came;
NB, p. 36). We can also speculate that both Wittgenstein’s idea of a
general propositional form and his appeal to simple objects (see below)
were inspired by Hertz’s mechanics.</p>
<p>Hertz’s greatest influence on Wittgenstein was arguably his more
philosophical views. In discussing the problems we get into in trying to
reconcile the various relations that have accumulated around the ideas
of force and electricity, Hertz writes:</p>
<p>We have an obscure feeling of this and want to have things cleared
up. Our confused wish finds expression in the confused question as to
the nature of force and electricity. But the answer which we want is not
really an answer to this question. It is not by finding out more and
fresh relations and connections that it can be answered; but by removing
the contradictions existing between those already known, and thus
perhaps by reducing their number. When these painful contradictions are
removed, the question as to the nature of force will not have been
answered; but our minds, no longer vexed, will cease to ask illegitimate
questions.11</p>
<p>This finds a direct echo in Wittgenstein’s own remarks about
philosophy in the Tractatus (see 4.003, 4.112, and especially the 6.5s).
Wittgenstein took up some of Hertz’s lines of thinking, then, not so
much to clarify ideas that Hertz had (though he partly does that) but to
apply them in clarifying the problems he found in Frege’s and Russell’s
work.</p>
<p>Boltzmann was an Austrian physicist who founded statistical
mechanics. As well as a two-volume work on this, he also published a
collection of his popular writings (1905), which Wittgenstein owned and
read. Wittgenstein had apparently wanted to study with Boltzmann in
Vienna after school, but Boltzmann’s suicide in September 1906 resulted
in his going to Berlin instead. Like Hertz, Boltzmann developed a
‘picture theory’ of science, which may also have helped shape
Wittgenstein’s account of pictures, but it was again his more
philosophical views that arguably had the greatest influence. Boltzmann
claimed that certain philosophical questions, such as about the value of
life or the most fundamental laws of physics, were illegitimate,
reflecting the mind’s tendency to ‘overshoot’. If philosophy could thus
create a system, Boltzmann wrote, such that ‘it stood out clearly when a
question is not justified so that the drive towards asking it would
gradually die away, we should at one stroke have resolved the most
obscure riddles and philosophy would become worthy of the name of queen
of the sciences’.12 There is an echo of this in 6.5 and 6.521 of the
Tractatus, and Wittgenstein may well have drawn inspiration from
Boltzmann in developing just such a philosophical ‘system’.</p>
<p>Much has been made of Schopenhauer’s influence on Wittgenstein. He
apparently read Schopenhauer’s major work, The World as Will and
Representation (1818), at the age of 16, and was attracted to its
epistemological idealism. Schopenhauer’s philosophy has to be understood
as a response to Kant’s philosophy. According to Kant, the world as we
experience it—the phenomenal world—is formed by both the spatio-temporal
framework and the conceptual scheme that we impose on it. This is his
so-called transcendental idealism, specifying the conditions for
knowledge to be possible at all. There is sensory input that we work on,
so Kant also claimed to be an empirical realist. But he maintained, too,
that there is a noumenal world, comprising ‘things-in-themselves’, lying
behind the phenomenal world, which somehow gives rise to the sensory
content that we synthesize into knowledge. This is what the philosophers
who came after him, including Schopenhauer, criticized. To regard
things-in-themselves as ‘giving rise’ to the phenomenal world amounts to
projecting the concept of causality outside its legitimate (empirical)
domain.</p>
<p>Instead, Schopenhauer argued that the world should be conceived as
both will (Wille) and representation (Vorstellung), understood as two
aspects, the operation of the will taking over the work of Kant’s
‘noumenal causality’. Knowledge of will, as a non-rational impulse, is
gained through introspection, according to Schopenhauer. In being aware
of our body, for example, we perceive it both as a physical object and
as something we can move by willing. Schopenhauer’s account has
solipsistic implications, and both these and his general conception of
the will are clearly in the background to Wittgenstein’s remarks in the
5.6s. Schopenhauer is not named in the Tractatus, but he is mentioned
once in the surviving notebooks:</p>
<pre><code>Good and evil only enter through the subject. And the subject does not belong to the world but is a limit of the world.

One could say (following Schopenhauer): The world of representation is neither good nor bad; only the willing subject is. (NB, p. 79).13</code></pre>
<p>The second sentence of this becomes 5.632, but immediately after
these remarks in the notebooks, Wittgenstein goes on: ‘I am aware of the
complete unclarity of all these propositions.’ The issue of whether
Wittgenstein himself was an idealist of some kind in the Tractatus, and
what his attitude to solipsism was, is fiercely debated. But
Wittgenstein’s own comment here makes one cautious about any
interpretation.</p>
