<h4 id="the-propositions-of-logic-are-tautologies.">6.1 The propositions
of logic are tautologies.</h4>
<pre><code>    6.11 The propositions of logic thus say nothing. (They are the analytic propositions.)</code></pre>
<p>6.111 Theories which make propositions of logic appear contentful are
always false. One might suppose, for example, that the words ‘true’ and
‘false’ signify two properties among other properties, and it would then
appear as a remarkable fact that every proposition has one of these
properties. This seems far from obvious, just as the proposition ‘all
roses are either yellow or red’, say, sounds far from obvious, even if
it were true. For the logical proposition* then entirely acquires the
character of a proposition of natural science and this is a sure sign
that it has been misconstrued.</p>
<p>6.112 The correct explanation of logical propositions must give them
a unique status among all propositions.</p>
<p>6.113 It is the characteristic mark of logical propositions that one
can recognize from the symbol alone that they are true, and this fact
comprises the whole of philosophy of logic. And so, too, is it one of
the most important facts that non-logical propositions do not permit
their truth or falsity to be recognized from the proposition alone.</p>
<pre><code>    6.12 That the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the formal—logical—properties of language, of the world.

 That its constituents, so connected, yield a tautology is what characterizes the logic of its constituents.

 For propositions, connected in a particular way, to yield a tautology, they must have particular structural properties. That they yield a tautology so combined thus shows that they have these structural properties.</code></pre>
<p>6.1201 For example, that the propositions ‘p’ and ‘~p’ yield a
tautology in the combination ‘<sub>(p. </sub>p)’ shows that they
contradict one another. That the propositions ‘p⊃q’, ‘p’ and ‘q’
combined together in the form ‘(p⊃q).(p):⊃:(q)’ yield a tautology shows
that q follows from p and p⊃q. That ‘(x).fx:⊃:fa’ is a tautology shows
that fa follows from (x).fx, etc. etc.</p>
<p>6.1202 It is clear that one could also use contradictions instead of
tautologies for the same purpose.</p>
<p>6.1203 To recognize a tautology as such, in cases in which no
generality-sign occurs in the tautology, one can make use of the
following perspicuous method: instead of ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, etc., I write
‘TpF’, ‘TqF’, ‘TrF’, etc. I express the truth-combinations by means of
brackets, for example:</p>
<p>and the correlation of the truth or falsity of the whole proposition
with the truth-combinations of the truth-arguments by means of lines in
the following way:</p>
<pre><code>This sign, for example, would thus represent the proposition p⊃q. Now I want to test whether the proposition ~(p.~q) (law of contradiction), for example, is a tautology. The form ‘~ξ’ is written in our notation as</code></pre>
<p>and the form ‘ξ ‧η’ thus:</p>
<p>The proposition ~ (p . ~q) is therefore written thus:</p>
<pre><code>If we substitute ‘p’ for ‘q’ here and examine the combination of the outermost T and F with the innermost, then the result is that the truth of the whole proposition is correlated with all the truth-combinations of its argument, its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.</code></pre>
<p>6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties of
propositions by combining them into propositions that say nothing.</p>
<pre><code> This method could also be called a zero-method.* In a logical proposition propositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, and the state of equilibrium then shows how these propositions have to be constituted logically.</code></pre>
<p>6.122 From this it follows that we can even do without logical
propositions, since in an appropriate notation we can recognize the
formal properties of propositions by merely looking at the
propositions.</p>
<p>6.1221 For example, if two propositions ‘p’ and ‘q’ in the
combination ‘p⊃q’ yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows
from p.That ‘q’ follows from ‘p⊃q.p’, for example, we see from the two
propositions themselves, but we can also show it like this: by combining
them into ‘p⊃q.p:⊃:q’ and then showing that this is a tautology.</p>
<p>6.1222 This sheds light on the question why logical propositions
cannot be confirmed by experience, any more than they can be refuted by
experience. Not only must a proposition of logic be incapable of being
refuted by any possible experience but it must also be incapable of
being confirmed by any possible experience.</p>
<p>6.1223 Now it becomes clear why it was often felt as if the ‘logical
truths’ had to be ‘postulated’ by us: for we can postulate them inasmuch
as we can postulate an adequate notation.</p>
<p>6.1224 It also becomes clear now why logic was called the theory of
forms and of inference.</p>
<p>6.123 This is clear: logical laws must not themselves in turn be
subject to logical laws.</p>
<pre><code> (There is not, as Russell supposed, a distinct law of contradiction for each ‘type’, but one is enough, since it is not applied to itself.)</code></pre>
<p>6.1231 The mark of a logical proposition is not its general
validity.For to be general is only to be accidentally valid for all
things. For an ungeneralized proposition can be tautological just as
well as a generalized one.</p>
<p>6.1232 Logical generality could be called essential, as opposed to
that accidental generality of, say, the proposition ‘All humans are
mortal’. Propositions such as Russell’s ‘axiom of reducibility’ are not
logical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, if true, they
could only be true by happy accident.</p>
<p>6.1233 A world can be imagined in which the axiom of reducibility is
not valid. It is clear, however, that logic has nothing to do with the
question whether our world is actually like this or not.</p>
<p>6.124 Logical propositions describe the scaffolding of the world, or
rather, they represent it. They ‘concern’ nothing. They presuppose that
names have meaning and elementary propositions have sense: and this is
their connection with the world. It is clear that it must show something
about the world that certain combinations of symbols—which essentially
have a particular character—are tautologies. This is the key point. We
say that something is arbitrary in the symbols we use, something is not.
In logic only the latter expresses:* but this is to say that, in logic,
it is not we who express what we want by means of signs, but rather
that, in logic, the nature of the absolutely necessary signs itself
speaks:* if we know the logical syntax of any sign-language, then all
propositions of logic are already given.</p>
<p>6.125 It is possible, and even according to the old conception of
logic, to give from the outset a description of all ‘true’ logical
propositions.</p>
<p>6.1251 That is why there can never be surprises in logic.</p>
<p>6.126 Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be worked out by
working out the logical properties of the symbol.</p>
<pre><code> And we do this when we ‘prove’ a logical proposition. For, without concern for sense or meaning, we form the logical proposition from others according to mere sign-rules.

 The proof of logical propositions consists in our producing them from other propositions by successive application of certain operations that always generate further tautologies from the first ones. (And indeed, only tautologies follow from a tautology.)

 Of course, this way of showing that its propositions are tautologies is by no means essential to logic. Simply because the propositions from which the proof proceeds must themselves show without proof that they are tautologies.</code></pre>
<p>6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (That is why no
surprise.)</p>
<p>6.1262 Proof in logic is only a mechanical aid for easier recognition
of a tautology, where it is complicated.</p>
<p>6.1263 For it would be quite remarkable if one could prove a senseful
proposition logically from others, and a logical proposition as well. It
is clear from the outset that logical proof of a senseful proposition
and proof in logic must be two quite different things.</p>
<p>6.1264 A senseful proposition states something, and its proof shows
that this is so; in logic every proposition is the form of a proof.Every
proposition of logic is a modus ponens represented in signs. (And one
cannot express the modus ponens by a proposition.)</p>
<p>6.1265 One can always construe logic so that every proposition is its
own proof.</p>
<p>6.127 All propositions of logic have equal status, without essential
division into basic laws* and derived propositions.</p>
<pre><code> Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.</code></pre>
<p>6.1271 It is clear that the number of ‘logically basic laws’ is
arbitrary, since one could derive logic from one basic law by simply
forming the logical product, for example, of Frege’s basic laws. (Frege
would perhaps say that this basic law would no longer be immediately
self-evident. But it is remarkable that so exact a thinker as Frege
appealed to the degree of self-evidence as criterion for a logical
proposition.)</p>
<pre><code>    6.13 Logic is not a set of teachings but a mirror image of the world.*

 Logic is transcendental.</code></pre>
