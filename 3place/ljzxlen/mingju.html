correctly used, it is expressed in a concept-script by a variable
name.For example, in the proposition ‘There are 2 objects which…’ by
‘(∃x,y)…’.Wherever it is used differently, that is, as a real
concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions arise.So one cannot say,
for example, ‘There are objects’ as one might say ‘There are books’. Nor
is ‘There are 100 objects’ or ‘There are ℵ0 objects’ any better.And it
is nonsensical to speak of the number of all objects.The same applies to
the words ‘complex’, ‘fact’, ‘function’, ‘number’, etc.They all signify
formal concepts and are represented in a concept-script by variables,
not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell held).Expressions such
as ‘1 is a number’, ‘there is only one zero’ and the like are
nonsensical.(It is just as nonsensical to say ‘There is only one 1’ as
it would be to say ‘2 + 2 at 3 o’clock equals 4’.)</p></li>

<li><p>proposition must have a sense; and I say: every possible
proposition is legitimately constructed, and if it has no sense, then
this can only be because we have not given a meaning to some of its
constituents.(Even if we think we have done so.)So that is why ‘Socrates
is identical’ says nothing, because we have given no meaning to the word
‘identical’ as adjective. For when it occurs as the identity sign, it
symbolizes in a quite different way—the signifying relation is a
different one; that is, the symbol in the two cases is also quite
different; the two symbols have only the sign in common with one another
accidentally.</p></li>

<li><p>(It is nonsense, from the start, to place the hypothesis p⊃p
before a proposition to ensure that its arguments have the correct form,
because the hypothesis for a non-proposition as argument becomes not
false but nonsensical, and because the proposition itself becomes
nonsensical by the incorrect kind of argument—in other words, it
protects itself from incorrect arguments just as well, or poorly, as
attaching a senseless hypothesis for this purpose.)</p></li>
