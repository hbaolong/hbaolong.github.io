<h4 id="the-truth-functions-can-be-ordered-in-series.">5.1 The
truth-functions can be ordered in series.</h4>
<pre><code> This is the foundation of probability theory.</code></pre>
<p>5.101 The truth-functions of any number of elementary propositions
can be written down in a schema of the following kind:*</p>
<pre><code> (TTTT) (p,q) Tautology (If p, then p; and if q, then q.) [p⊃p. q⊃q]</code></pre>
<p>(FTTT) (p,q) in words: Not both p and q. [~(p.q)]</p>
<p>(TFTT) (p,q) „ „ If q, then p. [q⊃p]</p>
<p>(TTFT) (p,q) „ „ If p, then q. [p⊃q]</p>
<p>(TTTF) (p,q) „ „ p or q. [pvq]</p>
<p>(FFTT) (p,q) „ „ Not q.[~ q]</p>
<p>(FTFT) (p,q) „ „ Not p. [~p]</p>
<p>(FTTF) (p,q) „ „ p or q, but not both. [p.~q: v : q.~p]</p>
<p>(TFFT) (p,q) „ „ If p, then q; and if q, then p. [p≡q]</p>
<p>(TFTF) (p,q) „ „ p</p>
<p>(TTFF) (p,q) „ „ q</p>
<p>(FFFT) (p,q) „ „ Neither p nor q. [<sub>p.</sub>q or p|q]</p>
<p>(FFTF) (p,q) „ „ p and not q. [p.~q]</p>
<p>(FTFF) (p,q) „ „ q and not p. [q.~p]</p>
<p>(TFFF) (p,q) „ „ p and q. [p.q]</p>
<p>(FFFF) (p,q) Contradiction (p and not p; and q and not q.)
[p.<sub>p. q.</sub>q]</p>
<pre><code> Those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments that make a proposition true I will call its truth-grounds.

    5.11 If the truth-grounds that are common to a number of propositions are all also truth-grounds of a particular proposition, then we say that the truth of this proposition follows from the truth of those propositions.

    5.12 In particular, the truth of a proposition ‘p’ follows from the truth of another proposition ‘q’ if all truth-grounds of the second are truth-grounds of the first.</code></pre>
<p>5.121 The truth-grounds of the one are contained in those of the
other; p follows from q.</p>
<p>5.122 If p follows from q, then the sense of ‘p’ is contained in the
sense of ‘q’.</p>
<p>5.123 If a god creates a world in which certain propositions are
true, then he thereby creates a world in which all their consequences
are true as well. And similarly he could not create a world in which a
proposition ‘p’ is true without creating all its objects.</p>
<p>5.124 A proposition affirms every proposition that follows from
it.</p>
<p>5.1241 ‘p.q’ is one of the propositions that affirm ‘p’ and at the
same time one of the propositions that affirm ‘q’.Two propositions are
opposed to one another if there is no senseful proposition that affirms
them both.Every proposition that contradicts another negates it.</p>
<pre><code>    5.13 That the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of other propositions can be seen from the structure of the propositions.</code></pre>
<p>5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of
others, then this expresses itself through relations in which the forms
of these propositions stand to one another; that is to say, we do not
need to first put them in these relations by combining them with one
another in one proposition; rather, these relations are internal and
obtain as soon as, and in virtue of, these propositions obtaining.</p>
<p>5.1311 If we infer q from p v q and ~p, then the relation between the
propositional forms of ‘p v q’ and ‘~p’ is here concealed by the mode of
signification. But if we write, for example, ‘p|q.|.p|q’ instead of ‘p v
q’ and ‘p|p’ instead of ‘~p’ (p|q =neither p nor q), then the inner
connection becomes manifest.(That fa can be inferred from (x).fx shows
that the generality is present also in the symbol ‘(x).fx’.)</p>
<p>5.132 If p follows from q, then I can take q to infer p, deduce p
from q.</p>
<pre><code> The kind of inference is to be gathered from the two propositions alone.

 Only they themselves can justify the inference.

 ‘Laws of inference’, which are supposed—e.g. by Frege and Russell—to justify inferences, are senseless, and would be superfluous.</code></pre>
<p>5.133 All deduction proceeds a priori.</p>
<p>5.134 From an elementary proposition no other can be deduced.</p>
<p>5.135 In no way can an inference be drawn from the obtaining of any
one state of affairs to the obtaining of another, completely different
state of affairs.</p>
<p>5.136 There is no causal nexus that would justify such an
inference.</p>
<p>5.1361 We cannot infer future events from present ones.Superstition
is the belief in the causal nexus.*</p>
<p>5.1362 Freedom of the will consists in not yet being able to know
future actions. We could only know them if causality were an inner
necessity, like that of logical inference.—The connection between
knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity.(‘A knows that
p is the case’ is senseless if p is a tautology.)</p>
<p>5.1363 If it does not follow from a proposition’s being self-evident
that it is true, then its self-evidence is no justification, either, for
our belief in its truth.*</p>
<pre><code>    5.14 If a proposition follows from another, then the latter says more than the former, the former less than the latter.</code></pre>
<p>5.141 If p follows from q and q from p, then they are one and the
same proposition.</p>
<p>5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.</p>
<p>5.143 Contradiction is what is common to propositions that no
proposition has in common with another. Tautology is what is common to
all propositions which have nothing in common with one another.</p>
<pre><code> Contradiction vanishes, so to speak, outside, tautology inside all propositions.

 Contradiction is the outer limit of propositions, tautology the empty point at their centre.*

    5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition ‘r’, Trs the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition ‘s’ that are also truth-grounds of ‘r’, then we call the ratio Trs:Tr the measure of probability that the proposition ‘r’ gives to the proposition ‘s’.</code></pre>
<p>5.151 In a schema like that above in 5.101, let Tr be the number of
the ’T’s in the proposition r, Trs the number of the ’T’s in the
proposition s that are in the same columns as ’T’s of the proposition r.
The proposition r then gives to the proposition s the probability:
Trs:Tr.</p>
<p>5.1511 There is no special object that is peculiar to probability
propositions.</p>
<p>5.152 Propositions that have no truth-arguments in common with one
another we call independent of one another.</p>
<pre><code> Two elementary propositions give one another the probability ½.

 If p follows from q, then the proposition ‘q’ gives to the proposition ‘p’ the probability 1. The certainty of logical inference is a limiting case of probability.

 (Application to tautology and contradiction.)</code></pre>
<p>5.153 A proposition is in itself neither probable nor improbable. An
event occurs or it does not occur; there is no middle case.</p>
<p>5.154 Suppose that in an urn there are just as many white as black
balls (and no others). I draw one ball after another and put them back
again in the urn. I can then establish by experiment that the numbers of
drawn black and white balls converge as the draw continues.</p>
<pre><code> This is therefore not a mathematical factum.*

 If I now say, ‘It is equally probable that I will draw a white as a black ball’, then this is to say, ‘All the circumstances known to me (including the laws of nature hypothetically assumed) give to the occurrence of the one event no more probability than to the occurrence of the other’. That is, they give to each—as is easily gathered from the explanations above—the probability ½.

 What I confirm by the experiment is that the occurrence of the two events is independent of the circumstances of which I know nothing further.</code></pre>
<p>5.155 The unit of a probability proposition is this: the
circumstances—of which I know nothing more—give to the occurrence of a
definite event such and such a degree of probability.</p>
<p>5.156 Probability is thus a generalization.</p>
<pre><code> It involves a general description of a propositional form.

 Only when certainty is lacking do we use probability.—That is, when we do not fully know a fact, but do know something about its form.

 (A proposition can indeed be an incomplete picture of a certain state of affairs, but it is always a complete picture.)

 A probability proposition is, as it were, an extract* from other propositions.</code></pre>
