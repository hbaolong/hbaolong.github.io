<h4 id="wittgensteins-key-early-ideas">3. Wittgenstein’s key early
ideas</h4>
<p>Before outlining the main structure of the Tractatus and its central
claims, let us briefly consider some of the key ideas that Wittgenstein
developed in response to Frege and Russell that were later incorporated
into the Tractatus. The selection here has been governed by the aim of
elucidating some of the most characteristic themes of the Tractatus.</p>
<p>3.1. Repudiation of Logical Constants</p>
<p>In one of his earliest letters to Russell, dated 22 June 1912,
Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>Logic is still in the melting-pot but one thing gets more and more
obvious to me: The prop[osition]s of Logic contain ONLY APPARENT
variables and whatever may turn out to be the proper explanation of
apparent variables, its consequences must be that there are NO logical
constants.</p>
<pre><code>Logic must turn out to be of a TOTALLY different kind than any other science.   (WC, p. 30; NB, p. 120)</code></pre>
<p>In his own earliest work, Russell had held that any meaningful term
must denote something, what it denotes constituting its meaning. This
included the logical connectives, ‘not’, ‘and’, ‘or’, and so on. Even
when the theory of descriptions showed how some phrases could be
‘analysed away’ to avoid the assumption that they must denote something
for sentences in which they occur to have meaning, he did not take this
to apply to the logical connectives themselves.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein explains why he rejects Russell’s view at the very
beginning of the notes that he left for Russell before departing to
Norway in October 1913: ‘One reason for thinking the old notation
[i.e. Russell’s] wrong is that it is very unlikely that from every
proposition p an infinite number of other propositions not-not-p,
not-not-not-not-p, etc. should follow’ (NB, p. 93). The thinking is
straightforward: if ‘not’ denoted something, then ‘not-not-p’ would say
something different from just ‘p’; and then it would indeed seem
remarkable that we can deduce an infinite number of different
propositions from just one proposition. When this remark found its way
into 5.43 of the Tractatus, itself a comment on 5.4, where Wittgenstein
denies that there are ‘logical objects’, he diagnoses the error: ‘All
propositions of logic, however, say the same. Namely, nothing.’ Further
reasons for this denial are given in other remarks in the 5.4s.</p>
<p>If the logical connectives do not denote anything, then what are
they? Wittgenstein’s answer is that they are operations, an idea that
first emerges in his notebooks on 13 December 1914 and is made explicit
on 23 January 1915: ‘Negation is an operation… . An operation, of
course, does not state anything, only its result; and this depends on
its object’ (NB, p. 39). Wittgenstein’s account of operations is given
in the 5.2s. One crucial idea is that an operation can ‘vanish’, as he
puts it (5.254); that is, it can cancel itself out, explaining why
‘not-not-p’ is equivalent to just ‘p’.</p>
<p>3.2. Propositional Unity and The Theory of Types</p>
<p>At the time that Wittgenstein was working with Russell in Cambridge,
Russell conceived a proposition as some kind of complex entity composed
of simpler entities. But this raised the question of the unity of such a
proposition. If the only constituents of a proposition are objects, then
how do they combine to generate a meaningful proposition? As
Wittgenstein was to put it, what makes ‘Socrates is mortal’ meaningful
but ‘mortality is Socrates’ meaningless? Frege’s answer was clear:
concepts are ‘unsaturated’, reflected in the fact that the concept-word,
represented here by ‘( ) is mortal’, contains a ‘gap’ indicating where
the proper name goes to complete the sentence.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein recognized what is in effect Frege’s solution to the
problem of the unity of the proposition. Reporting on a meeting he had
had with Frege in December 1912, he wrote to Russell: ‘I had a long
discussion with Frege about our Theory of Symbolism of which, I think,
he roughly understood the general outline … The complex-problem is now
clearer to me and I hope very much that I may solve it’ (WC, p. 36; NB,
p. 121). On 16 January 1913, he then elaborates:</p>
<p>I have changed my views on “atomic” complexes: I now think that
Qualities, Relations (like Love) etc. are all copulae! That means I for
instance analyse a subject-predicate prop[osition], say, “Socrates is
human” into “Socrates” and “Something is human”, (which I think is not
complex). The reason for this, is a very fundamental one: I think that
there cannot be different Types of things! In other words whatever can
be symbolized by a simple proper name must belong to one type. And
further: every theory of types must be rendered superfluous by a proper
theory of symbolism: For instance if I analyse the prop[osition]
Socrates is mortal into Socrates, Mortality and (∃x,y) εI (x,y) I want a
theory of types to tell me that “Mortality is Socrates” is nonsensical,
because if I treat “Mortality” as a proper name (as I did) there is
nothing to prevent me to make the substitution the wrong way round. But
if I analyse [it] (as I do now) into Socrates and (∃x)x is mortal or
generally into x and (∃x)ϕ(x) it becomes impossible to substitute the
wrong way round, because the two symbols are now of a different kind
themselves. What I am most certain of is not however the correctness of
my present way of analysis, but of the fact that all theory of types
must be done away with by a theory of symbolism showing that what seem
to be different kinds of things are symbolized by different kinds of
symbols which cannot possibly be substituted in one another’s places. I
hope I have made this fairly clear! (WC, p. 38; NB, pp. 121–2)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s ‘analysis’ here differs from Frege’s, and he did
indeed come to reject this analysis as well as Frege’s; in the
Tractatus, he writes that elementary propositions ‘consist of names in
immediate combination’ (4.221). But the essential idea that there are
different ‘kinds’ of things that can only be shown by a correct
symbolism remained. The distinction between saying and showing is not
formulated explicitly until April 1914 (see §2.1 above, and below), but
it is clearly implicit in this letter. It provides a good example of a
line of thinking found in Frege’s philosophy, which Wittgenstein then
used in clarifying a problem in Russell’s work—and in this case, too, as
we have seen, in Frege’s own attempts to explain his concept/object
distinction.14</p>
<p>3.3. Showing and The Ideal Notation</p>
<p>As mentioned in §2.1 above, the distinction between saying and
showing first appears in the notes Wittgenstein dictated to Moore in
April 1914. Here is the opening remark again together with the remark
that follows:</p>
<p>Logical so-called propositions show [the] logical properties of
language and therefore of [the] Universe, but say nothing.</p>
<pre><code>This means that by merely looking at them you can see these properties; whereas, in a proposition proper, you cannot see what is true by looking at it. (NB, p. 108)</code></pre>
<p>What logical propositions show are the inferential relations between
ordinary propositions, rooted in their own logical structure. He goes on
to describe logical propositions as tautologies: while true, they say
nothing. One might object, however, to the suggestion that we can see
that they are true merely by looking at them; but here is where
Wittgenstein’s concern with an ideal notation comes in. The diagrams
that appear in 6.1203 of the Tractatus are attempts he made to show the
logical properties of propositions with what he called his ab-notation
(cf. NB, p. 115). More successful, though, is his use of truth-tables to
display the truth-conditions of propositions, as explained in 4.31 and
4.4s (and cf. 5.101). This is now an established method in propositional
logic of seeing whether a proposition is a tautology. If the final
column in a truth-table representing a proposition displays only Ts,
then the proposition is a tautology (and if only Fs, then a
contradiction).</p>
<p>It is important at this point to correct a major error of
interpretation that Russell made in his introduction to Wittgenstein’s
Tractatus. In explaining how to understand the book, he writes:</p>
<p>Mr Wittgenstein is concerned with the conditions for a logically
perfect language—not that any language is logically perfect, or that we
believe ourselves capable, here and now, of constructing a logically
perfect language, but that the whole function of language is to have
meaning, and it only fulfils this function in proportion as it
approaches to the ideal language which we postulate.15</p>
<p>This misconstrues Wittgenstein’s project, and it is not surprising
that Wittgenstein was unhappy with Russell’s introduction. Wittgenstein
was not concerned with an ideal language, but with an ideal notation, a
notation that made as clear as possible the logical structure that our
ordinary language already has, as a condition of being useable—of making
sense—at all. In 5.5563 he writes: ‘All propositions of our everyday
language are in fact, just as they are, in perfect logical order.—That
most simple idea that we have to get across here is not a likeness of
the truth but the whole truth itself.’ Language may disguise thought
(4.002), but that is why we need a ‘critique of language’ to uncover the
real logical form of propositions (4.0031). Wittgenstein’s main concern
was to show how language is already logically perfect, which he thought
we would see once we properly understand the nature of the
proposition.</p>
<p>3.4. The Senselessness of Logical Propositions</p>
<p>After characterizing logical propositions in his notes of April 1914
as tautologies, Wittgenstein goes on to describe them as ‘forms of
proof: they show that one or more propositions follow from one (or
more)’ (NB, p. 109). Since this remark is incorporated into 6.1264 and
holds the key to his claim that logical propositions are senseless, let
us consider a simple example of a logical inference to explain this, a
logical inference of the following form:</p>
<p>‘Q’ follows logically from ‘P’ and ‘P ⊃ Q’ (‘If P, then Q’), by a
rule of inference called modus ponens, one of the most basic rules of
logical inference.</p>
<p>Let us now imagine someone objecting that since the inference depends
on this rule, it should be made explicit in the reasoning. How might we
formulate this rule? The obvious suggestion would be to write ‘(P
andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’ (‘If P and (if P, then Q), then Q’). So let
us add this as the supposed missing premise:</p>
<p>If we do this, however, then an infinite regress threatens. Should we
not add as a further premise ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q ) andandandand ((P
andandandand (P ⊃ Q )) ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’, and so on? How can we ever draw a
valid inference?16</p>
<p>Clearly, something has gone wrong. ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’
cannot be seen as a missing premise: the inference in its original
formulation is perfectly valid as it is. The rule of modus ponens
governs the inference but is not part of it. For every rule of inference
there is some corresponding logical proposition, but such logical
propositions have a quite different status to the premises of an
inference. (If an argument is compared to a house built of bricks, then
rules of inference are like the mortar that holds the bricks together
and not the bricks themselves.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein makes this point by saying that logical propositions
lack sense, in other words, are senseless. Unlike ‘P’, ‘P ⊃ Q’ and ‘Q’,
all of which may have sense, ‘(P andandandand (P ⊃ Q)) ⊃ Q’ is
senseless, since it adds nothing to the inference. It is a form of
proof, as Wittgenstein puts it, showing that ‘Q’ follows from ‘P’ and ‘P
⊃ Q’. But in showing such inferential relations, logical propositions
are not nonsense. The distinction between senselessness and nonsense was
only explicitly drawn in the first draft of the Tractatus (see below),
but it is just another way of characterizing the unique nature of
logical propositions.</p>
<p>3.5. Simple Objects</p>
<p>In the 2.02s of the Tractatus Wittgenstein notoriously claims that
there must be simple objects if the world is to have substance and
empirical propositions are to have sense. This is an issue that occupied
Wittgenstein throughout his early thinking. If a proposition is to have
an analysis at all, it would seem, then it must bottom out into basic
(elementary) propositions, whose constituent names must denote something
if they and the complex propositions they form are to have a meaning. A
number of different lines of thought converge on the claim that there
must be simple objects, and we will focus here on just one, which is
easy to motivate from Russell’s theory of descriptions.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a basic proposition, which has the simplest form we
can imagine, stating that an object a has the property F. The
proposition ‘a is F’ is true if a does indeed have the property F, and
is false if it does not. But what if ‘a’ does not, in fact, denote
anything in the world (like ‘the present King of France’)? Then either
‘a is F’ is meaningless or else we have to treat ‘a’ as a disguised
definite description and analyse it in accordance with Russell’s theory
of descriptions, which would mean that it is not, after all, a basic
proposition: it would be a conjunction of three simpler propositions. So
if basic propositions are possible at all, propositions that cannot be
further analysed, then their constituent names must denote: there must
be simple objects to be the meanings of these names. Wittgenstein never
gave examples of simple objects, but he thought that there must be such
objects as the necessary condition for the propositions of our language
to have sense. Other lines of thought leading to this claim are given in
the 3.2s, quite a few of which have sources in his notebooks.</p>
<p>3.6. The Bipolarity of Propositions</p>
<p>Another idea that Wittgenstein had very early on, explained in his
notes of 1913, concerns what he called the bipolarity of propositions:
to understand a proposition we must know both what is the case if it is
true and what is the case if it is false (NB, pp. 94, 98). This was
important in his attempt to get clear about ‘the mystery of negation’,
as he put it: ‘This is not how things are, and yet we can say how things
are not’ (NB, p. 30). Russell had held that there had to be both
‘positive’ and ‘negative’ facts, to act as the meanings of propositions
and their negations, respectively. But this leaves unexplained the
connection that there must nevertheless be between the corresponding
positive and negative fact. In his notes of 1913, Wittgenstein suggests
a better account: p and not-p have the same meaning (explaining the
connection) but opposite sense (NB, pp. 95, 103).</p>
<p>By the time we get to the Tractatus, this claim has been modified:
‘The propositions “p” and “~p” have opposite sense, but one and the same
reality corresponds to them’ (4.0621). Wittgenstein no longer talks of
propositions having meaning; it is only names that have meaning. But
propositions (unlike names) do have sense, which he characterizes as the
state of affairs represented. If that state of affairs obtains, then the
proposition is true; if it does not obtain, then the proposition is
false. Here what is important is that we can understand a proposition,
i.e. grasp its sense, without knowing its truth-value: it is ‘reality’
that determines whether it is true or false (4.02 ff.).</p>
<p>This account also helps explain how the logical connectives ‘enter
into’ propositions without being actual constituents. For if
understanding a proposition requires knowing what is the case if it is
false as well as what is the case if it is true, then understanding it
involves grasp of negation. Given the interdefinability of the logical
connectives, knowledge of all of them—and of logic, generally—is
implicitly presupposed in understanding even the most basic
propositions.</p>
<p>3.7. Propositions as Facts</p>
<p>According to Russell, propositions signify facts, but propositions
themselves he regarded as complexes (of objects or terms). But how can
complexes signify facts, which seem to be a different category—or
‘type’—of thing? Wittgenstein’s answer is that propositions, too, are
facts. In his notes of 1913, he writes: ‘In “aRb” it is not the complex
that symbolises but the fact that the symbol “a” stands in a certain
relation to the symbol “b.” Thus facts are symbolised by facts, or more
correctly: that a certain thing is the case in the symbol says that a
certain thing is the case in the world’ (NB, p. 96; cf. pp. 98, 106).
This is repeated in his notes of 1914 (pp. 111, 116), and later in
3.1432 of the Tractatus: ‘Not: “The complex sign ‘aRb’ says that a
stands in the relation R to b”; but: That ‘a’ stands in a certain
relation to ‘b’ says that aRb.’ Here it is embedded in a broader
discussion of propositions as facts, which we can thus see as
elaborating on his criticism of Russell’s view.</p>
<p>3.8. Propositions as Pictures</p>
<p>On 29 September 1914 Wittgenstein wrote in his notebook:</p>
<p>The general concept of a proposition carries with it a quite general
concept of the co-ordination of proposition and state-of-things
[Sachverhalt]: The solution to all my questions must be extremely
simple.</p>
<pre><code>In a proposition a world is put together experimentally. (As when in a Parisian law-court a car accident is represented by dolls, etc.) (NB, p. 7)</code></pre>
<p>Wittgenstein had apparently read about the Parisian law case in a
magazine report and it was the trigger for him to think of propositions
themselves as models or pictures of the world. We can see his thinking
this through in the remarks that follow:</p>
<p>Instead of saying that this proposition has such and such a sense,
one can say that this proposition represents such and such a
state-of-things!</p>
<pre><code>It depicts it logically.

Only thus can the proposition be true or false: only by being a picture of a state-of-things can it agree or not agree with reality… .

The proposition only states something insofar as it is a picture!   (NB, p. 8)</code></pre>
<p>In the first three sentences Wittgenstein is already connecting the
idea of propositions as pictures to his existing conception of a
proposition as having sense (representing a state-of-things) and meaning
(depicting reality), and agreeing or not agreeing with reality (just as
a picture can). The fourth expresses the insight he has now had.</p>
<p>It was not all plain sailing, however. He continues to develop what
is essentially an analogy, with all the ups and downs that would
inevitably be expected. In mid-April 1915, for example, he writes:</p>
<p>I cannot get from the essence of a proposition to the individual
logical operations!!!</p>
<pre><code>I just cannot bring out how far a proposition is a picture of a state-of-things!

I am almost ready to give up all efforts.   (NB, p. 41)</code></pre>
<p>On 9 May he has the hint of an answer: ‘A proposition is a picture of
a fact. I can devise different pictures of a fact. (The logical
operations serve to do this.)’ (NB, p. 46). Four days later he writes:
‘Just don’t pull the knot tight before being sure of having got hold of
the right end’ (NB, p. 47). Whatever the exact development of his
thinking in this period, though, it does seem that he was gradually
getting closer to the point when he could finally start pulling the knot
tight in bringing together all his ideas.</p>
