<ol type="1">
<li>Origin and composition</li>
</ol>
<p>The composition, publication, and English translation of the text of
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus has a complex history that
deserves a separate account of its own.1 Its origin lies in the
notebooks in which Wittgenstein wrote down his thoughts from the time he
began working with Russell at Cambridge in 1912. Before he departed for
Norway in October 1913 he left some notes for Bertrand Russell,
extracted from these notebooks, which were posthumously published as
Appendix 1 of Notebooks 1914–1916.2 In Spring 1914 G. E. Moore visited
him in Norway, where Wittgenstein dictated some further notes, which now
constitute Appendix 2 of the Notebooks. Wittgenstein served in the
Austrian army during the First World War from August 1914 until he was
captured on the Italian Front in November 1918, after which he spent ten
months in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy. Throughout the war he
continued to write down his thoughts in notebooks, some of which have
survived and been translated (by Elizabeth Anscombe) and published as
the main text of the Notebooks.3</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had various periods away from the warfront, either on
leave or working as a military engineer, and during these periods he
composed what eventually became the Tractatus. He began this sometime in
the summer of 1915 when he started a new notebook, which has also
survived and is catalogued as MS 104 in the Wittgenstein archives. On
the first page he wrote down what became the first six main propositions
of the Tractatus, with the formula in the sixth added later, together
with 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. It is at this
point that he introduced his numbering system, according to which a
remark of the form n.1 is a comment on n, n.11 on n.1, and so on. This
system gave him an ingenious method to compose his treatise and not
merely to indicate the ‘logical weight’ of the propositions, as he puts
it in his footnote to the first proposition of the Tractatus. He could
add new remarks consecutively in the notebook but by numbering them he
could indicate their place in the eventual treatise. Some remarks were
indeed new but many were selected from his other notebooks, revised as
appropriate. When the notebook (MS 104) was discovered in Vienna in 1965
by G. H. von Wright, it was edited, translated, and published as the
Prototractatus in 1971,4 with the remarks arranged in the order
indicated by their decimal numbering. It is revealing to see this
earlier version of the Tractatus, but its arrangement obscures the
chronological order in which the remarks were written or added, which is
also helpful for scholars. The original notebook is now available
online, however, with impressive editing by Martin Pilch and others,
which scholars can consult for a more detailed understanding of the
composition of the Tractatus.5</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had a longer leave than normal in the summer of 1918,
and this is when the Tractatus took its final form, under the title
‘Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung’ (‘Logico-Philosophical Treatise’).
There are significant changes from the Prototractatus, as later
constructed, to the Tractatus itself, but the critical edition of the
Tractatus that was published in German in 1989 (LPA) prints each page of
the Tractatus with the corresponding remarks of the Prototractatus (and
remarks from other notebooks) on the facing page, so that comparison can
be made. The Tractatus was essentially finished in August 1918. Several
typed copies were made, one of which was eventually sent by his sister
to Gottlob Frege (arriving in early 1919) and another of which
Wittgenstein took with him to the Italian Front in October 1918. After
capture, Wittgenstein continued to make minor revisions while in
prisoner-of-war camps, and in March 1919 he wrote to Russell telling him
about the book and claiming to have ‘solved our problems finally. This
may sound arrogant but I can’t help believing it’ (WC, p. 89). He
eventually managed to get his corrected version sent to Russell, in June
1919, but in the meantime he received a copy of Russell’s Introduction
to Mathematical Philosophy, which Russell had written while in prison in
1918 and which had been published in March 1919. Wittgenstein was
disappointed to find that it showed no understanding at all, as he saw
it, of his notes from 1913 and 1914, and he wrote back expressing his
hope of meeting Russell in person to explain his ideas (WC, p. 93). This
only became possible once he was freed from the prisoner-of-war camp in
August 1919.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>First attempts at finding a publisher</li>
</ol>
<p>Wittgenstein had first tried to find a publisher as soon as his book
was finished in August 1918. He sent it to Jahoda andandandand Siegel,
the publisher of Karl Kraus’s work, but heard back by the end of October
that it had been rejected. On his return from Italy, he sent it to
Wilhelm Braumüller, the publisher of Otto Weininger’s work, and asked
Russell to send a letter of recommendation in support, which Russell
did. But Braumüller made publication conditional on payment for the
paper and printing, a condition which Wittgenstein refused to accept.
Wittgenstein had been in correspondence with Frege throughout the war,
and although Frege had professed not to understand Wittgenstein’s
treatise when he tried to read it, he nevertheless offered (in a letter
dated 30 September 1919) to help find a publisher.6 What Frege had in
mind was the publisher of the Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen
Idealismus (edited by his Jena colleague Bruno Bauch), in which Frege’s
own paper ‘Der Gedanke’ (1918) had just appeared. But nothing came of
this, either, not least because Frege had recommended that the whole
treatise be revised to make the arguments clearer, something which
Wittgenstein was also unwilling to do.</p>
<p>In October 1919 he then approached Ludwig von Ficker, whom he had got
to know in Vienna before the war in soliciting his help in giving away
some of his inheritance. Ficker was editor of Der Brenner, a literary
periodical, and was in contact with writers and artists such as Rainer
Maria Rilke, Oskar Kokoschka, and Georg Trakl, who then benefited from
Wittgenstein’s largesse. In his initial letter offering his manuscript,
Wittgenstein said only that ‘the work is strictly philosophical and at
the same time literary, but there’s no gassing in it’.7 After a positive
response expressing interest, Wittgenstein sent the manuscript with an
accompanying letter containing a passage that is now frequently quoted,
revealing as it is of the ‘ethical’ dimension of the book:</p>
<p>it will probably be a help to you if I write a few words about my
book. You see, I am quite sure that you won’t get all that much out of
reading it. Because you won’t understand it; its subject matter will
seem quite alien to you. But it isn’t really alien to you, because the
book’s point is an ethical one. I once meant to include in the preface a
sentence which is not in fact there now but which I will write out for
you here, because it will perhaps be a key to the work for you. What I
meant to write, then, was this: My work consists of two parts: the one
presented here plus all that I have not written. And it is precisely
this second part that is the important one. My book draws limits to the
sphere of the ethical from the inside as it were, and I am convinced
that this is the ONLY rigorous way of drawing those limits. In short, I
believe that where many others today are just gassing, I have managed in
my book to put everything firmly into place by being silent about it.
And for that reason, unless I am very much mistaken, the book will say a
great deal that you yourself want to say. Only perhaps you won’t see
that it is said in the book. For now, I would recommend you to read the
preface and the conclusion, because they contain the most direct
expression of the point of the book.8</p>
<p>Ficker, too, however, soon got cold feet (perhaps because of these
words), although he offered to publish it as a special favour if no
other option availed itself. This was also something that Wittgenstein
was not prepared to accept, of course. Ficker said he would ask Rilke if
he could help find another publisher, but nothing came of this, either.
Wittgenstein realized that his best chance lay in convincing Russell of
the value of his work, and he pressed ahead with his arrangements to
travel to The Hague, where he and Russell had agreed to meet for a week
in the middle of December.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Meeting with Russell in December 1919</li>
</ol>
<p>In the lead-up to their meeting in the Netherlands, Wittgenstein and
Russell had exchanged a series of letters. On 13 August 1919 Russell had
written: ‘I am sure you are right in thinking the book of first-class
importance. But in places it is obscure through brevity’ (WC, p. 96). He
raised a number of specific questions, some of which Wittgenstein
briefly answered in his reply of 19 August. But in responding to the
general charge of obscurity, Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>some of your questions want a very lengthy answer and you know how
difficult it is for me to write on logic. That’s also the reason why my
book is so short, and consequently so obscure. But that I can’t
help.—Now I’m afraid you haven’t really got hold of my main contention,
to which the whole business of logical prop[osition]s is only a
corollary. The main point is the theory of what can be expressed
(gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the
same, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by
prop[osition]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the
cardinal problem of philosophy.</p>
<pre><code>I also sent my M.S. to Frege. He wrote to me a week ago and I gather that he doesn’t understand a word of it all. So my only hope is to see you soon and explain all to you, for it is VERY hard not to be understood by a single soul! (WC, p. 98)</code></pre>
<p>This offers an alternative formulation of the point he had made to
Ficker about drawing the limits of thought and ethics from the inside,
expressed in terms of his distinction between saying and showing, and
making explicit that he regards this as the cardinal problem of
philosophy. It also reveals the despair that he was clearly feeling as a
result of both Russell’s and Frege’s failure to appreciate his book, the
primary aim of which had been to solve the problems that he had seen as
arising in their own work.</p>
<p>When Russell and Wittgenstein finally met, for the first time in over
six years, they spent a whole week together. As Russell reported
afterwards, in one of his regular letters to Lady Ottoline Morrell on 20
December:</p>
<p>we discussed his book every day. I came to think even better of it
than I had done; I feel sure it is a really great book, though I do not
feel sure it is right. I told him I could not refute it, and that I was
sure it was either all right or all wrong, which I considered the mark
of a good book; but it would take me years to decide which. This of
course didn’t satisfy him, but I couldn’t say more.</p>
<pre><code>I had felt in his book a flavour of mysticism, but was astonished when I found that he has become a complete mystic. He reads people like Kierkegaard and Angelus Silesius, he seriously contemplates becoming a monk… . He has penetrated deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I think (though he wouldn’t agree) that what he likes best in mysticism is its power to make him stop thinking. I don’t much think he will really become a monk—it is an idea, not an intention. His intention is to be a teacher.9</code></pre>
<p>On a more practical level, Russell promised to do what he could to
get the book published, agreeing to write an introduction to it and
even, so it seemed, to translate it into English himself, so that it
could be published in Britain. Wittgenstein returned to Vienna in good
spirits. As he wrote to Russell on 8 January 1920, ‘I enjoyed our time
together very much and I have the feeling (haven’t you too?) that we did
a great deal of real work during that week’ (WC, p. 113).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Further attempts—and final success—at finding a publisher</li>
</ol>
<p>Back in Vienna, Wittgenstein learnt of a new publisher interested in
his book: Reclam in Leipzig, after contact had been made with them by
his friend, Paul Engelmann. Wittgenstein was hopeful that, with an
introduction by Russell, they would accept it. He wrote to Russell on 19
January 1920 to ask for the introduction, and chased it up on 19 March,
but that was the very day that Russell sent it, the delay caused by a
broken collarbone (WC, pp. 116–17). Wittgenstein replied on 9 April to
thank him, adding that it was now being translated into German to
accompany his book. At the same time, though, he couldn’t help giving
expression to a certain disappointment:</p>
<p>There’s so much of it that I’m not quite in agreement with—both where
you’re critical of me and also where you’re simply trying to elucidate
my point of view. But that doesn’t matter. The future will pass judgment
on us—or perhaps it won’t, and if it is silent that will be a judgment
too. (WC, p. 118)</p>
<p>When the translation into German came back, however, the
disappointment deepened, as he felt obliged to explain to Russell on 6
May:</p>
<p>now you’ll be angry with me when I tell you something: Your
Introduction is not going to be printed and as a consequence my book
probably won’t be either.—You see, when I actually saw the German
translation of the Introduction, I couldn’t bring myself to let it be
printed with my work. All the refinement of your English style was,
obviously, lost in the translation and what remained was superficiality
and misunderstanding. Well, I sent the treatise with your Introduction
to Reclam and wrote saying that I didn’t want the Introduction printed,
it was meant to serve only for his own orientation in relation to my
work. It is now highly probable that as a result Reclam won’t accept my
work (though I’ve had no answer from him yet). But I’ve already
comforted myself on that score, by means of the following argument,
which seems to me unanswerable. Either my piece is a work of the highest
rank, or it is not a work of the highest rank. In the latter (and more
probable) case I myself am in favour of its not being printed. And in
the former case it’s a matter of indifference whether it’s printed
twenty or a hundred years sooner or later. After all, who asks whether
the Critique of Pure Reason, for example, was written in 17x or y. So
really in the former case too my treatise wouldn’t need to be
printed.—And now, don’t be angry! Perhaps it was ungrateful of me but I
couldn’t do anything else. (WC, pp. 119–20)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein correctly anticipated Reclam’s response: the book was
rejected. Russell did not receive the letter until he had returned from
a trip to Russia. With so much correspondence to catch up on, he wrote
back, on 1 July, saying simply, but very generously: ‘I don’t care
twopence about the introduction but I shall be really sorry if your book
isn’t printed. May I try, in that case, to have it printed in England or
America?’ (WC, p. 120). Wittgenstein replied on 7 July telling Russell
that he could do what he liked with it, as long as he indicated any
changes in the text that he made (WC, p. 121). He had by then received
his teaching qualification and was soon to take up a post in an
elementary school in Trattenbach, a remote village in the mountains
south of Vienna.</p>
<p>Russell, however, was about to leave for China, to teach at Peking
University for a year, so he entrusted the job of finding a publisher to
Dorothy Wrinch, with whom he had discussed the book the previous year.
Cambridge University Press, to their shame, turned it down in January
1921, though this may have been because it had been offered without
Russell’s introduction. Wrinch approached the editors of three German
journals. One said that they would only accept psychological and not
philosophical works, one suggested asking again later that year, and the
third was Wilhelm Ostwald, editor of the Annalen der Naturphilosophie,
who replied as follows: ’In any other case I should have declined to
accept the article. But I have such an extremely high regard for Mr
Bertrand Russell, both for his researches and for his personality, that
I will gladly publish Mr Wittgenstein’s article … Mr Bertrand Russell’s
Introduction will be particularly welcome.’10 So it was that
Wittgenstein’s work was finally published, in German, with Russell’s
introduction newly translated, in November 1921, in what turned out to
be the very last issue of Ostwald’s journal.</p>
<p>Russell didn’t hear about its acceptance by Ostwald until he returned
from China at the end of August 1921. Nor did Wittgenstein know anything
about it until Russell wrote to him on 5 November, informing him and
apologizing for the fact that his introduction was also included.
Wittgenstein replied on 28 November, saying: ‘I must admit I am pleased
that my stuff is going to be printed. Even though Ostwald is an utter
charlatan. As long as he doesn’t tamper with it!’ (WC, p. 128) Russell
later assured him that Ostwald’s version was alright, although there
were indeed misprints and errors. More importantly, in his letter of 5
November, Russell also told him of the plan to include his book in a new
series edited by C. K. Ogden, entitled ‘International Library of
Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method’, published by Kegan Paul.
This news went down much better with Wittgenstein: ‘What pleases me most
is that the whole thing is going to appear in England. I hope it may be
worth all the trouble that you and others have taken with it’ (WC,
p. 128).</p>
<p>There was clearly discussion in Cambridge at this time of how to
translate ‘Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung’. Moore had suggested
‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus’, an allusion to Spinoza’s Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus, prompted by Wittgenstein’s talk of viewing the
world ‘sub specie aeterni’ in 6.45. Ogden felt that ‘Philosophical
Logic’ was better as a ‘selling title’, and Russell seemed to agree, so
this became its working title.11 When Wittgenstein finally gave his
opinion on the question (in April 1922), however, he had this to
say:</p>
<p>As to the title I think the latin one is better than the present
title. For al〈l〉though ‘Tractatus logico-philosophicus’ isn’t ideal
still it has something like the right meaning, whereas ‘Philosophical
logic’ is wrong. In fact I don’t know what it means! There is no such
thing as philosophical logic. (Unless one says that as the whole book is
nonsense the title might as well be nonsense too.) (LO, p. 20)</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>First English translation</li>
</ol>
<p>The decision was taken at the very beginning to publish the book in
both German and English: Russell had discussed this with Wittgenstein
when they had met at The Hague in December 1919. They had also agreed,
it seems, on the translation of key terms. Russell had left the passages
he had cited from Wittgenstein’s treatise untranslated when he had first
written his introduction (since the introduction was going to be
translated into German), but these were now translated for the version
that was going to accompany the book in Ogden’s series. He also made
some revisions to the introduction, mainly some additions at the
beginning. The published version of the introduction is dated May
1922.</p>
<p>Russell did not undertake the translation himself, however, despite
what Wittgenstein had understood from their meeting in The Hague; but
nor did Ogden, despite his name being recorded as the translator when
the book was published. The first draft of the translation was done by
F. P. Ramsey, who was just 18 years old when he began it (he turned 19
in February 1922) and a mathematics student at Trinity College
Cambridge. Ramsey had been shown the text and was very interested in it.
Ogden presumably advised him on the translation of the key terms that
Russell and Wittgenstein had discussed. It also appears that Russell
made some changes to the draft translation that Ramsey produced.12
Ramsey worked from an offprint of the Ostwald text, however, with its
various errors, so there were further revisions still to be made.</p>
<p>Ogden sent the draft translation to Wittgenstein in March 1922, and
he replied on 28 March to say that since he did not have the original
corrected German text with him in Trattenbach (the version he had sent
Russell, which had then gone to Ostwald), there would be a delay in
responding (LO, p. 17). He expressed his strong approval, though, of
having the original German included with the English translation. Having
received the German text, he then wrote again to Ogden on 23 April with
corrections to both the German and the English text, sending some twenty
pages of detailed comments on the translation.13 In his covering letter,
he remarks:</p>
<p>The translation as you said, was in many points by far too literal. I
have very often altered it such that now it doesn’t seem to be a
translation of the German at all. I’ve left out some words which occur
in the German text or put in others which don’t occur in the original
etc. etc. But I al〈l〉ways did it in order to translate the sense (not
the words). (LO, p. 19)</p>
<p>He concludes the letter, though, by thanking the translators for
their excellent work, noting that ‘I now understand that the translators
must have had an awful〈l〉 job’ (LO, p. 21).14</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s comments about the ‘far too literal’ character of the
translation were taken on board by Ogden, and provided a reason for
having the original German alongside the English, just as Wittgenstein
wanted. As Ogden explained in a note that was inserted at the very
beginning of the published book:</p>
<p>In rendering Mr Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
available for English readers, the somewhat unusual course has been
adopted of printing the original side by side with the translation. Such
a method of presentation seemed desirable both on account of the obvious
difficulties raised by the vocabulary and in view of the peculiar
literary character of the whole. As a result, a certain latitude has
been possible in passages to which objection might otherwise be taken as
over-literal.</p>
<pre><code>The proofs of the translation and the version of the original which appeared in the final number of Ostwald’s Annalen der Naturphilosophie (1921) have been very carefully revised by the author himself; and the Editor further desires to express his indebtedness to Mr F. P. Ramsey, of Trinity College, Cambridge, for assistance both with the translation and in the preparation of the book for the press.  (TLP, 1922, p. 5)</code></pre>
<p>The vast majority of the revisions that Wittgenstein requested or
suggested in his letter of 23 April were made. In May there was a
further exchange of letters between Ogden and Wittgenstein, in which
Wittgenstein replied to some specific questions that Ogden asked about
the translation. (That Ogden was the driving force in getting the
Tractatus published and the contact person in communicating with
Wittgenstein may have led him to feel justified in taking credit for the
translation. But mention of mere ‘assistance’ in this note belittles
Ramsey’s contribution.) Ogden also enquired about some ‘supplements’, to
which Wittgenstein responded:</p>
<p>When I had finished the book roughly there remained certain
prop[osition]s—about a hundred—about which I was doubtful whether I
should take them in or not. These prop[osition]s were—partly—different
versions of those now contained in the book; for it had often happened
that I had written down a prop[osition] in many different forms, when
the same thought had occurred to me in different ways during the long
time I worked at that business. Another part of the supplements are
merely sketches of prop[osition]s which I thought I might some day take
up again if their thoughts should ever revive in me. That means: The
supplements are exact〈e〉ly what must not be printed. Besides THEY
REAL[L]Y CONTAIN NO ELUCIDATIONS AT ALL, but are still less clear than
the rest of my prop[osition]s. As to the shortness of the book I am
awfully sorry for it; but what can I do?! If you were to squeeze me out
like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me. To let you print the
Ergänzungen would be no remedy. It would be just as if you had gone to a
joiner and ordered a table and he had made the table too short and now
would sell you the shavings and sawdust and other rub[b]ish along with
the table to make up for its shortness. (Rather than print the
Ergänzungen to make the book fatter leave a dozen white sheets for the
reader to swear into[o] when he has purchased the book and can〈n〉’t
understand it.) (LO, p. 46)15</p>
<p>This is deeply revealing of Wittgenstein’s method of work and a
wonderful illustration of his creative use of analogies in making his
points and of his self-deprecation concerning his struggles with
writing. It also has a message to any translator: that various
formulations may have to be tried out in translating a phrase or
sentence before settling on one that best captures the intended sense.
And here an objection might be raised to Wittgenstein’s artistic
perfectionism, which made him reluctant to publish, and even led him to
destroy, what he saw as only rough or draft formulations of his
thoughts, such as he wrote in his notebooks. Those earlier or variant
formulations can certainly be useful to us in attempting to make sense
of his ideas, as long as we recognize, of course, their provisional or
discarded status, as ladders to reach the formulations he preferred.</p>
<p>The proofs of his book were sent to Wittgenstein in July 1922, and he
returned his corrections to them on 4 August (LO, pp. 57–63). The book
was finally published in November, just over four years after he had
completed the manuscript, and on 15 November he acknowledged receipt of
the copies sent to him, commenting ‘They real[l]y look nice. I wish
their contents were half as good as their external ap[p]earance’ (LO,
p. 68).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>From the first to the second edition</li>
</ol>
<p>Ramsey’s translation of the Tractatus was of major significance in
the lives of both Ramsey and Wittgenstein. Shortly after it was
published, Ramsey wrote a critical notice of it for the journal Mind
(1923), which is remarkable in the depth of its appreciation of both its
general concerns and many of its details, when even Frege, Russell, and
Moore had struggled to make sense of it. His work on the translation had
surely contributed to his deeper understanding. The review was finished
in the spring of 1923, and in September that year, Ramsey visited
Wittgenstein in Puchberg, where he was then teaching, and they spent two
weeks together discussing the Tractatus every afternoon. In doing so,
Wittgenstein made various corrections to both the English and the German
texts, which were recorded in Ramsey’s copy of the book.</p>
<p>In a letter to his mother, Ramsey reported that Wittgenstein’s ‘idea
of his book is not that anyone by reading it will understand his ideas,
but that some day someone will think them out again for himself, and
will derive great pleasure from finding in this book their exact
expressions’ (LO, p. 78). He also remarked that ‘Some of his sentences
are intentionally ambiguous having an ordinary meaning and a more
difficult meaning which he also believes’ (LO, p. 78), which Ramsey must
have realized complicates translation. Ramsey kept in contact with
Wittgenstein by letter, and visited him again several times the
following year. There was already discussion then of a second edition of
the Tractatus, incorporating the corrections that Wittgenstein had made,
though the book was not selling as well as Ogden had hoped. The question
came up again of adding further material, but in a letter to Ogden,
Ramsey wrote: ‘He almost certainly wouldn’t agree to any more
explanatory matter, even Russell’s introduction was a strain. I’m sorry
so few have sold’ (LO, p. 86).</p>
<p>It is also clear from a letter he wrote to Wittgenstein on 11
November 1923 that Ramsey had been finding out, on behalf of
Wittgenstein, about the possibility of his submitting the Tractatus to
obtain a degree from Cambridge. It turned out that he would not be able
to fulfil the conditions for a BA but that with another year of
residence in Cambridge (added to the two years he had spent in 1912 and
1913), he would qualify for a PhD (WC, p. 143). When Wittgenstein
finally returned to Cambridge in January 1929, to take up philosophy
again, Ramsey officially became his supervisor and helped him in the
formal process of submitting the Tractatus as a PhD. His viva took place
on 18 June 1929, with Russell and Moore as his two examiners. In his
examiner’s report, Moore concluded: ’I am inclined to think that the
dissertation as a whole is a work of genius, comparable with
acknowledged philosophical masterpieces; but, even if that is not so, I
feel quite sure that its quality is such that it would be a sheer
absurdity not to grant the Ph.D. degree to Mr. Wittgenstein.’16 With his
doctorate awarded, Wittgenstein was eligible for a Research Fellowship
at Trinity College, to which he was appointed at the end of 1930, after
submitting the manuscript on which he had been working over the previous
two years, which was posthumously published in 1975 as Philosophical
Remarks.</p>
<p>A second edition of the Tractatus finally came out in 1933, with most
of the corrections that Wittgenstein had made in Ramsey’s copy in 1923
incorporated. The publisher Kegan Paul sent the proofs to Wittgenstein
in June 1933, to which he made some further corrections, but without
adding any additional material, whether ‘explanatory’ or otherwise.17
The first edition had by then sold out, and the book had established
itself as a philosophical classic.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Second English translation</li>
</ol>
<p>Ogden’s note about the ‘over-literal’ translation in his edition was
quoted above. For those readers with some German the English text could
aid in its comprehension without being taken as providing definitive or
elegant formulations. As Wittgenstein’s influence on the development of
analytic philosophy deepened, however, and scholarly interest in his
writings blossomed after the Second World War, the need for a fresh and
more fluent translation grew. Just such a translation (with an
accompanying German text retained) was provided in 1961 by David Pears
and Brian McGuinness, two philosophers at Oxford, where Wittgenstein’s
influence was perhaps stronger than anywhere else in the world at the
time. Here is how McGuinness later described their motivation:</p>
<p>A whole generation of English-speaking philosophers came to know the
work through a translation which seems to have been not so much
liberated as shackled by the presence of the German on the opposite
page. It reads as if made from a dead language, though that may be
thought to assist the stylistic effect of a revelation which is
certainly one of the aims of the original. A smoother, and perhaps more
philosophical version has been attempted by the present writer with a
colleague.18</p>
<p>Despite what Ogden had said, in the second paragraph of his note,
about the proofs of the original translation being ‘very carefully
revised’ by Wittgenstein himself, however, Pears and McGuinness were
under the impression that Wittgenstein had not played any major role in
this respect. This impression may well have come from Elizabeth
Anscombe, who in her introduction to the Tractatus, first published in
1959, had said this: ‘English readers of the Tractatus may need to be
warned that Ogden’s translation is notoriously very bad. Wittgenstein
told me that he had not checked the whole of this translation, but only
answered a few questions that were put to him about some passages’.19 As
we have seen, this is not true. But the relevant correspondence had not
been published at the time, and the view had certainly formed (at least
in Oxford) that the original translation was ‘notoriously very bad’, as
Anscombe puts it. Anscombe was one of Wittgenstein’s literary executors
and had translated his Philosophical Investigations, which appeared in
1953, two years after his death. She also translated Wittgenstein’s
notebooks from the period 1914–16, which were published in the same year
as the new translation of the Tractatus.</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness’s translation was reviewed in the Times Literary
Supplement on 19 January 1962, and this is what the reviewer said in
talking of ‘the badness of the original translation’:</p>
<p>The difference between the experiences of reading the new and the old
versions is remarkable. It is not that the old is grossly inaccurate,
though it contains inaccuracies, but that it is throughout cloudy,
stilted and unnatural, full of sentences which could not have been
written by a native speaker of English composing in his own tongue.
Exceptionally the sense of the original escapes altogether; but quite
generally the effect is to add to intrinsic difficulty an extra quality
of baffling mysteriousness from which the new translation is entirely
free… . Mr. Pears and Mr. McGuinness, in their happier collaboration,
have not only achieved a clear and natural English but have been
meticulous in their care for accuracy.</p>
<p>A heated debate in the pages of the TLS ensued, which simmered for
years. Mark Haymon responded first on 9 February 1962 stating that
Wittgenstein himself had sanctioned the original translation ‘point by
point’: ’Wittgenstein insisted that those places where it is not an
exact translation of the German should remain because they expressed
what he wished to say better than a more exact translation. It is, of
course, open to anybody to make a new translation in a more modern
idiom, but it is misleading to suggest that such a translation gives a
more accurate rendering of Wittgenstein’s thought.’20</p>
<p>Pears and McGuinness replied on 23 February:</p>
<p>It must be obvious to anyone who knows the two languages concerned
that Ogden and Ramsey’s translation contains many mistranslations and
infelicities which cannot possibly have expressed Wittgenstein’s thought
better than the original. If besides these, there are passages where
Wittgenstein composed or retained an English version that represented
his own second thoughts, clearly they ought not to be simply inserted in
what purports to be a translation. We wished to include in our edition a
list of any such passages, but did not succeed in obtaining a list from
Mr. Haymon, who was acting for Ogden’s executors. He has now written to
complain about our silence.</p>
<p>The underlying motivation for the dispute gradually became clear. In
his response on 16 March, Haymon admitted that they had indeed asked for
such a list and that this was offered to them but only in return for an
explicit acknowledgement of ‘the special nature of the original
translation and text and the circumstances of the publication and its
title’. Others contributed to the debate. On 13 April Victor Purcell
supported Haymon’s position in claiming that ‘Ogden’s translation
represents Wittgenstein’s thought at that time more exactly than any new
translation of the German can possibly do’. In the interests of both the
truth as well as justice to Ogden, he went on, ‘it is surely necessary
that any new translation should be accompanied by an account of the
circumstances in which the original translation was made’. (The present
account does just this, in accompanying the new translation offered
here, a century later. It should also be noted, of course, that credit
must be given to Ramsey as well, to whose work on the translation, it
has to be said, Ogden himself failed to do justice.)</p>
<p>Anscombe, Rhees, and von Wright, Wittgenstein’s literary executors,
also entered the fray (in a letter to the Editor of the TLS on 18
February 1965), complaining that they had not been allowed to see
Ogden’s letters from Wittgenstein and requesting that they be made
available. Eventually this material was authorized by Ogden’s estate for
publication, and in a final letter to the TLS on 9 October 1970,
Wittgenstein’s three executors conceded the correctness of what Ogden
had stated in his editorial note of 1922 and admitted that what they had
been led to believe by Wittgenstein in his later life was erroneous.
Anscombe revised the footnote, quoted above, in the fourth edition of
her book as follows: ’Ogden’s translation of the Tractatus has mistakes
which Wittgenstein did not detect. He later said (wrongly) that he did
not work on the translation; he only remembered answering a list of
questions.’21</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s Letters to C. K. Ogden with Comments on the English
Translation of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, edited by G. H. von
Wright, was finally published in 1973, and Pears and McGuinness revised
their translation accordingly (as they say in their new preface). The
second edition appeared in 1974, this time without the German text but
still including Russell’s introduction (with Russell’s own translation
of terms and sentences in the Tractatus left unchanged). Other than a
brief preface and an index (where the German for key terms was given) no
other editorial material was provided.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The present translation</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have seen, two main translations of the Tractatus have been
produced over the last century, the first by Ramsey and Ogden in 1922
(revised in 1933), and the second by Pears and McGuinness in 1961
(revised in 1974). (Scholars have, of course, provided their own
translations, in whole or part, in their own work.) Wittgenstein died in
1951, which means that in 2021, seventy years later, the copyright on
anything he wrote that was published before 1951 lapsed. Anyone is now
free to publish further translations of the Tractatus. The question
naturally arises, though, as to the need for, or value of, another
translation. The answer to the general question here is that there is
indeed value in having more than one translation of any (important)
text, even if some of the existing translations are of high quality; and
if none are of high quality, then of course there is a need for another.
Like works of philosophy themselves, translations are children of their
time, and fresh translations may well be required in new contexts, not
least when more is known about the texts and the contexts. New
translations may offer different perspectives on the text, facilitating
deeper understanding; and they may shake up the complacency that soon
sets in once an existing translation is taken as standard, complacency
which can discourage checking or revisiting the original when
interpretive claims are made, and inhibit alternative readings.</p>
<p>Let me now switch to a first-person register in motivating this new
translation of the Tractatus—as a reminder that any translation is the
work of one or more particular individuals at a particular time and
place. I am convinced that there is room for a fresh translation, and I
certainly hope that what is offered here will have value both to someone
new to Wittgenstein’s work and to scholars of his philosophy. Let me
comment first on the two translations whose story has been told above.
In my view, Ogden’s claim that Wittgenstein himself ‘very carefully
revised’ the proofs of the original translation should not be taken at
face value, despite the error that Anscombe and others clearly made in
denying it altogether. Having gone through, very carefully, all of
Wittgenstein’s correspondence to Ogden and his detailed comments on the
translation, I regard it as an exaggeration to say that it was
‘sanctioned point by point’ by Wittgenstein, as Russell (and Haymon)
claimed. Wittgenstein indicates where he finds the translation wrong,
but he is more hesitant when it comes to suggesting improvements,
recognizing the limitations of his own English. He was fluent in English
but not a native speaker, and it is native-speaker skills that one needs
in refining and polishing a translation. He recognized that the
translation was ‘in many points by far too literal’, as he told Ogden
very explicitly, which is why he wanted the German text included. As
Ogden’s note shows, including the German text provided an excuse for
leaving the translation in its clunky form.</p>
<p>Saying that Wittgenstein ‘authorized’ the translation is too strong;
he ‘allowed’ or ‘accepted’ it, but did not truly ‘endorse’ or ‘sanction’
it. There are many places where the translation lacks fluency, and it
requires a native speaker to identify them all (as opposed to just
having an impression of its being ‘far too literal’).22 Pears and
McGuinness rightly recognized its ‘stilted and unnatural’ character, as
McGuinness put it (quoted above), and with the greater sensitivity to
the nuances of language that Oxford ‘ordinary language philosophy’
encouraged in the period after the Second World War, their own
translation generally reads very well. It sets a high bar for other
translations, but it is not an insuperable bar because it is possible to
learn from, and hence build on, their work. In my view, in their concern
for fluency, in reacting to Ramsey’s translation, they take liberties
with the German text in many places, and some scholars today prefer to
go back and cite the original translation for just this reason. A fine
balance must clearly be struck between faithfulness and fluency, and
this is what I have tried to achieve, above all, in this new
translation.</p>
<p>As in the second edition of Pears and McGuinness’s translation, the
original German text is not included here. The German text is now
readily available online. However, I have provided both explanatory
notes and a glossary, so that the key German terms can always be read
back. Unlike both previous translations, however, the introduction by
Bertrand Russell is not included here (although one helpful passage is
cited in the main Introduction, §4.6). It is wrong about Wittgenstein’s
views, or distorts them, in a number of ways, and Wittgenstein himself
was never happy with it, right from the beginning. A century later, a
fresh contextualization of Wittgenstein’s work is long overdue.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>How to read the text</li>
</ol>
<p>In the light of what has been said about its composition and history,
let me conclude by offering some brief advice on how to read the text.
The notebook (MS 104), from which the Prototractatus was constructed,
opened with the main propositions stated separately, and both these and
the general structure of the Tractatus must be kept in mind. The seven
main propositions, of the form n, and all propositions of the form n.1,
have accordingly been set out in the structure that follows the
translation. In one of his letters to Ficker, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘the
decimal numbers of my remarks absolutely must be printed alongside them,
because they alone make the book perspicuous and clear: without the
numbering it would be an incomprehensible jumble’.23 The decimal numbers
are, of course, printed in the present translation, but the numbers
themselves have also been indented in accord with their decimalization
to remind the reader throughout of the relationships between the
propositions and their relative importance.</p>
<p>In a letter to Ottoline Morrell written on 28 May 1912 Russell
reported on a conversation he had had with Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>I told him he ought not simply to state what he thinks true, but to
give arguments for it, but he said arguments spoil its beauty, and that
he would feel as if he was dirtying a flower with muddy hands. He does
appeal to me—the artist in intellect is so very rare. I told him I
hadn’t the heart to say anything against that, and that he had better
acquire a slave to state the arguments. I am seriously afraid that no
one will see the point of anything he writes, because he won’t recommend
it by arguments addressed to a different point of view.24</p>
<p>We have seen how this manifested itself in Wittgenstein’s method of
working: remarks were drafted in his notebooks, from which he would
select and refine the ones that he felt best expressed his insights,
organizing them into sequences and sub-sequences to help convey those
insights. The aim was to present his point of view, with aesthetic
considerations partly governing its presentation.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that there are no arguments in the
Tractatus. On the contrary, there is a wealth of arguments that can be
discerned or reconstructed from what he says. Some of the slave labour
Russell recommended has been done for at least a small selection of
Wittgenstein’s key arguments in §3 of the main Introduction. A sketch
has also been provided in §4 of the basic lines of thinking in the seven
main propositions, as well as in the sequences of the form n.m (and in
one case of a sequence of the form n.0m), not just to shed light on
these lines of thinking but also to encourage the reader to do the same
for every sequence at the lower levels (such as 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and
3.14). As emphasized in concluding §4, it is essential to recognize the
tree structure of the Tractatus and read it accordingly, beginning with
the top-level sequence 1–7 and working down to all the lower-level
sequences, which can be combined as one works down with a ‘straighter’
reading of the book. Nor does this preclude comparing remarks from
different places in the tree structure: other arrangements of
Wittgenstein’s remarks might be useful in answering or clarifying
particular questions. The key is to keep in mind the tree structure
throughout. The arguments can then be discerned and reconstructed.</p>
<p>The Tractatus, then, is not a text that can simply be read from
beginning to end, on the assumption that there is a linear argument, or
a set of linear arguments and sub-arguments, leading one to a conclusion
which is thereby proved. Indeed, part of the point of the penultimate
proposition 6.54 is to make us realize this, redirecting us to what has
gone before and making us rethink it all. In his preface Wittgenstein
wrote: ‘This book will perhaps be understood only by those who have
already thought the thoughts expressed in it themselves—or at any rate
similar thoughts. It is thus not a textbook.’ If a reader has not had
those thoughts, then they will have to be acquired on a first (or
subsequent) reading, helped by relevant ‘background’ reading, so that
understanding the book develops gradually. Its value can only be seen by
working through it. The Tractatus is not a textbook but an exercise
book: a text that has to be thought into a book for oneself.</p>

Introduction, Chronology, and Select Bibliography.</p>
<p>2 There are two main versions of these notes. The so-called Costello
version (which first appeared in the Journal of Philosophy in 1957) was
published in the first edition of the Notebooks (1961), but a version
closer to what Wittgenstein had actually dictated replaced it in the
second edition (1979). For a detailed account of these notes, of both
their textual history and their philosophical content, see Michael
Potter, Wittgenstein’s Notes on Logic (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2009).</p>
<p>3 The published notebooks cover the periods 9/8/1914 to 22/6/1915
(two notebooks) and 15/4/1916 to 10/1/1917 (one notebook). They also
contain a diary written mostly in code, published in 1991 (GT). There
were three, possibly four, additional wartime notebooks, which were
destroyed or are lost (see Georg von Wright, ‘The Origin of the
Tractatus’, in Wittgenstein (Oxford: Blackwell, 1982), §2; Brian
McGuinness, Wittgenstein: A Life. Young Ludwig 1889–1921 (London:
Duckworth, 1988), 212, 264–5).</p>
<p>4 An expanded version of von Wright’s introduction to this became
‘The Origin of the Tractatus’. The account that von Wright provided here
needs to be revised in the light of recent scholarship. See especially
Luciano Bazzocchi, ‘The “Prototractatus” Manuscript and its
Corrections’, in N. Venturinha (ed.), Wittgenstein after his Nachlass
(Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 11–29, and ‘A Better Appraisal
of Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Manuscript’, Philosophical Investigations,

Wittgenstein’s MS 104’, Nordic Wittgenstein Review, 4.2 (2015), 65–97.

<p>14 Wittgenstein was under the impression at the time that there was
more than one translator (not including either Ogden or Russell), and
the original plan may well have been to have had someone else assisting
Ramsey, although it was Ramsey alone who ended up doing the first draft
of the whole translation. For further details of this, see Cheryl Misak,
Frank Ramsey (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), 131.</p>
<p>15 One of these ‘supplements’ (no. 72) did indeed find its way into
the Tractatus: 4.0141, its decimal numbering indicating its
supplementary character (LO, p. 26). It does indeed help elucidate
Wittgenstein’s main idea at this point in the text, and it is to be
regretted that many more were not also incorporated.</p>

(London: Hutchinson, 1959), 17 n.</p>
<p>20 These remarks seem to have been taken, more or less word for word,
from a letter written by Russell to F. K. Ogden, C. K. Ogden’s brother,
on 21 November 1960 (Ogden died in 1957): I learn that questions have
arisen as to the authenticity and authority of the English version of
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. I know that this version was sanctioned point
by point by Wittgenstein. There are places where it is not an exact
translation of the German. When I pointed this out to him, he admitted
it, but said that the translation as it stood expressed what he wished
to say better than a more exact translation. It is, of course, open to
anybody to make a new translation in a more modern idiom, but it would
be misleading to suggest that such a translation gave a more exact
accurate rendering of Wittgenstein’s thought at the time than that which
was published. I say this from recollection of careful and minute
discussion with Wittgenstein as to what he wished the English version to
say. (Cited in LO, p. 10)</p>
<p>Presumably Russell had been asked by F. K. Ogden for this
information, which was then handed over to Haymon, C. K. Ogden’s friend
and literary executor. Given his concern with ‘authenticity’, it is
ironic that Haymon plagiarizes Russell without mentioning his source at
all. As to his ‘recollection’, Russell tended to creatively elaborate in
reporting on events in his past (as his autobiography shows), and may
have confused his meeting with Wittgenstein in The Hague before the
translation was even begun by Ramsey and a meeting he had with him in

<p>22 In my view, Ramsey did an excellent job as Ogden’s ‘assistant’ in
producing a very competent first draft, and it was Ogden’s
responsibility, especially in taking credit for the translation, to
polish it up into something more fluent. Perhaps his own views about
language contributed to his not doing so. Ogden was to play a leading
role in the Basic English movement, which suggests that he was less
concerned with the nuances of ordinary language than with simply getting
the message across. And in any case, he wanted the book published as
soon as possible, to help launch his new series: the International
Library of Psychology, Philosophy and Scientific Method. 1922 saw its
first five titles, one of them the Tractatus.</p>
