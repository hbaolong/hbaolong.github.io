<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in
German in 1921 and in English translation in 1922, is one of the most
important philosophical works of the twentieth century and one of the
founding texts of analytic philosophy, which is now the dominant
philosophical tradition in the world. It offers an impressively
integrated account of the relationship between language, logic, and the
world, rooted in the conception of propositions as pictures, that has
had a powerful influence on philosophical thinking ever since. Anyone
who reads the text for the first time, with little knowledge of
Wittgenstein’s philosophical background, however, will struggle to make
much sense of the details. It may strike one as intriguing, exciting,
and profound, but also intimidating and obscure, especially as one
encounters the propositions about logic. There is a crystalline and
aphoristic quality to many of the propositions, which make them
memorable and quotable, not least the famous last proposition, but
exactly what they mean is far from clear. The numbering system suggests
a sophisticated organization, yet one struggles to understand how
everything fits together. And most notoriously, by the time one gets to
the end of the book, we find Wittgenstein telling us that the
propositions of the Tractatus are nonsense, which we have to get over if
we are to see the world correctly. Does he really mean that all of the
propositions are nonsense, and if some are not, then which ones and how
do we tell? How can we understand nonsensical propositions at all, and
what on earth are we then to make of the book?</p>
<p>With all the controversy and variety of interpretations that the book
has generated over the last century, purists may wish to insist that any
new edition of the Tractatus should present the text exactly as it
originally appeared (and ideally, if in translation, then with the
original German on facing pages) with no scholarly apparatus, to ensure
that editorial bias does not colour the reader’s understanding. The only
exception might be to allow the original introduction by Bertrand
Russell, with whom Wittgenstein had worked in developing his earliest
ideas. This had been felt necessary to ensure publication, since, at the
time, Wittgenstein (at least as a philosopher) was almost completely
unknown, while Russell was one of the most famous living philosophers of
all. (See the Note on the Text, which follows.) Wittgenstein had never
been happy with Russell’s introduction, however, and more than enough
time has elapsed for a new introduction, with the proper editorial
apparatus that we have now come to expect for fresh editions of classic
texts, especially in this Oxford World’s Classics series. Although
fierce disputes continue within the scholarly community about the
interpretation of the Tractatus, there is enough consensus about many of
the ideas and themes for an account that reflects this to help a reader
find their way through the text on a first reading, and the disputes can
be presented in such a way as to enable a reader to make up their own
mind. One aim of this new Introduction is to provide just such an
account, but it will also place the Tractatus in the wider context of
Wittgenstein’s life and works, the main influences on him, and its place
in the history of philosophy.</p>
<p>Before turning to his life and works, a few words must first be said
about the new translation that has been done for this edition. (A fuller
account is provided in the Note on the Text.) The original translation,
although appearing under the name of C. K. Ogden, was in fact mainly
done by F. P. Ramsey, and was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in
1922. Although Wittgenstein himself advised on the translation, it shows
signs of its age, and is clunky in many places. A second translation, by
D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness, was published in 1961 and revised in
1974, also published by Routledge and Kegan Paul. This improves on the
earlier translation in several key respects, but also introduces new
inadequacies and occasionally strays too far from the original German
text in trying to be more fluent (perhaps a sign of its being done in
the heyday of ‘ordinary language philosophy’ in Oxford). A fresh
translation is certainly needed, benefiting from the extensive debate
about Wittgenstein’s Tractatus that has taken place over the last
century, much of which has also involved discussion about the merits of
the two translations. A glossary and explanatory notes are also
provided, which were not included in either of the first two
translations, to help the understanding of key terms and passages and to
alert the reader to significant issues of interpretation that depend on
the exact rendering of the German original.</p>
