A proposition represents the obtaining and non-obtaining of
states-of-things.</h4>
<pre><code>    4.11 The totality of true propositions is natural science in total (or the totality of the natural sciences).</code></pre>
<h5 id="什么是自然科学">什么是自然科学？</h5>
<p>4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.</p>
<pre><code> (The word ‘philosophy’ must mean something that stands above or below, but not next to, the natural sciences.)</code></pre>
<p>4.112 The purpose of philosophy is the logical clarification of
thoughts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>clarification,英 [ˌklærəfɪˈkeɪʃn] 美 [ˌklærəfɪˈkeɪʃn]

<p>Philosophy is not a set of teachings but an activity.</p>
<p>A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.</p>
<p>Philosophy results not in ‘philosophical propositions’ but in
propositions becoming clear.</p>
<p>Philosophy should make clear and delimit sharply thoughts that are
otherwise, as it were, cloudy and blurred.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>4.1121 Psychology is no more akin to philosophy than is any other
natural science.Theory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.Does
not my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought
processes, which philosophers considered so essential to philosophy of
logic? Only they usually got entangled in inessential psychological
investigations, and there is an analogous danger as well with my
method.</p>
<p>4.1122 Darwinian theory has no more to do with philosophy than has
any other hypothesis of natural science.</p>
<p>4.113 Philosophy limits the disputable realm of natural science.</p>
<p>4.114 It should delimit the thinkable and thereby the
unthinkable.</p>
<pre><code> It should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable.</code></pre>
<p>4.115 It will indicate the unsayable by clearly representing the
sayable.</p>
<p>4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly.
Everything that can be stated can be stated clearly.</p>
<pre><code>    4.12 A proposition can represent the whole of reality, but it cannot represent what it must have in common with reality to be able to represent it—the logical form.

 To be able to represent the logical form, we would have to be able to position ourselves with a proposition outside logic, that is, outside the world.</code></pre>
<p>4.121 A proposition cannot represent the logical form; the logical
form mirrors itself in the proposition.</p>
<pre><code> What mirrors itself in language, language cannot represent.

 What expresses itself in language we cannot express by means of language.

 A proposition shows the logical form of reality.

 It features it.</code></pre>
<p>4.1211 A proposition ‘fa’ thus shows that the object a occurs in its
sense, two propositions ‘fa’ and ‘ga’ show that they are both about the
same object.If two propositions contradict one another, then their
structure shows this; likewise, if one follows from the other. And so
on.</p>
<p>4.1212 What can be shown cannot be said.</p>
<p>4.1213 Now we understand, too, our feeling that we are in possession
of a correct logical conception once everything is in order in our
sign-language.</p>
<h6 id="第一天读到这里">第一天读到这里</h6>
<p>4.122 We can talk in a certain sense of formal properties of objects
and states-of-things, or of properties of the structure of facts, and in
the same sense of formal relations and relations of structures.</p>
<pre><code> (Instead of ‘property of a structure’ I also say ‘internal property’; instead of ‘relation of structures’ ‘internal relation’.

 I introduce these expressions to show the ground of the widespread confusion among philosophers between internal relations and real (external) relations.)

 The obtaining of such internal properties and relations, however, cannot be asserted by means of propositions, but shows itself in the propositions that represent the relevant states-of-things and concern the relevant objects.</code></pre>
<p>4.1221 An internal property of a fact we can also call a feature of
the fact. (In the sense in which we speak, say, of facial features.)</p>
<p>4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object
does not have it.</p>
<pre><code> (This blue colour and that one stand in the internal relation of lighter and darker eo ipso. It is unthinkable that these two objects should not stand in this relation.)

 (Here to the shifting use of the words ‘property’ and ‘relation’ there corresponds the shifting use of the word ‘object’.)</code></pre>
<p>4.124 The obtaining of an internal property of a possible state of
affairs is not expressed by a proposition, but expresses itself in the
proposition that represents the state of affairs by an internal property
of the proposition.</p>
<pre><code> It would be just as nonsensical to ascribe a formal property to a proposition as to deny its ascription.</code></pre>
<p>4.1241 Forms cannot be distinguished from one another by saying that
one has this and another has that property, since this presupposes that
it makes sense to predicate the two properties to the two forms.</p>
<p>4.125 The obtaining of an internal relation between possible states
of affairs expresses itself linguistically by an internal relation
between the propositions that represent them.</p>
<p>4.1251 This resolves the dispute ‘whether all relations are internal
or external’.</p>
<p>4.1252 Series that are ordered by internal relations I call
form-series.</p>
<pre><code>The number series is ordered not by an external but by an internal relation.

Just as in the series of propositions‘aRb’,‘(∃x):aRx.xRb’,‘(∃x,y):aRx.xRy.yRb’,and so forth.(If b stands in one of these relations to a, then I call b a successor of a.)</code></pre>
<p>4.126 In the sense in which we speak of formal properties, we can
also talk of formal concepts.</p>
<pre><code> (I introduce this expression to make clear the ground of the confusion of formal concepts with real concepts, which pervades the whole of the old logic.)

 That something falls under a formal concept, as one of its objects, cannot be expressed by a proposition. Rather, it shows itself in the sign for the object itself. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a numerical sign that it signifies a number, etc.)

 Formal concepts, unlike real concepts, cannot be represented by a function.

 For its marks, the formal properties, are not expressed by functions.

 The expression of a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.

 The sign of the marks of a formal concept is thus a characteristic feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the concept.

 The expression of a formal concept is thus a propositional variable, in which only this characteristic feature is constant.</code></pre>
<h6 id="第二天读到这里">第二天读到这里</h6>
<p>4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and
its values signify the objects that fall under the concept.</p>
<p>4.1271 Every variable is the sign of a formal concept.For every
variable represents a constant form that all its values have, and which
can be taken as a formal property of these values.</p>
<p>4.1272 The variable name ‘x’ is thus the real sign of the
pseudo-concept object.Wherever the word ‘object’ (‘thing’, ‘entity’,
etc.) is correctly used, it is expressed in a concept-script by a
variable name.For example, in the proposition ‘There are 2 objects
which…’ by ‘(∃x,y)…’.Wherever it is used differently, that is, as a real
concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions arise.So one cannot say,
for example, ‘There are objects’ as one might say ‘There are books’. Nor
is ‘There are 100 objects’ or ‘There are ℵ0 objects’ any better.And it
is nonsensical to speak of the number of all objects.The same applies to
the words ‘complex’, ‘fact’, ‘function’, ‘number’, etc.They all signify
formal concepts and are represented in a concept-script by variables,
not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell held).Expressions such
as ‘1 is a number’, ‘there is only one zero’ and the like are
nonsensical.(It is just as nonsensical to say ‘There is only one 1’ as
it would be to say ‘2 + 2 at 3 o’clock equals 4’.)</p>
<p>4.12721 A formal concept is already given with an object that falls
under it. So one cannot introduce as primitive ideas the objects of a
formal concept and the formal concept itself. So one cannot, for
example, introduce as primitive ideas the concept of a function as well
as specific functions (as Russell does), or the concept of number and
particular numbers.</p>
<p>4.1273 If we want to express the general proposition ‘b is a
successor of a’ in a concept-script, then we need for this an expression
for the general term of the form-series:</p>
<p>The general term of a form-series can only be expressed by a
variable, since the concept ‘term of this form-series’ is a formal
concept. (Frege and Russell overlooked this: the way in which they want
to express general propositions such as the above is therefore false; it
contains a vicious circle.)</p>
<pre><code>We can determine the general term of a form-series by giving its first term and the general form of the operation that generates the next term from the preceding term.</code></pre>
<p>4.1274 The question as to the existence of a formal concept is
nonsensical. For no proposition can answer such a question.</p>
<pre><code>(So, for example, one cannot ask: ‘Are there unanalysable subject–predicate propositions?’)</code></pre>
<p>4.128 Logical forms are numberless.</p>
<pre><code> That is why there are no pre-eminent numbers in logic and why there is no philosophical monism or dualism, etc.</code></pre>
