Only a proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition does
a name have meaning.*</h4>
<pre><code>    3.31 Every part of a proposition that characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).

 (The proposition itself is an expression.)

 Expression is everything essential to the sense of a proposition that propositions can have in common with one another.

 An expression marks a form and a content.</code></pre>
<p>3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in
which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of
propositions.</p>
<p>3.312 It is thus represented by the general form of the propositions
that it characterizes.</p>
<pre><code> That is to say, in this form the expression will be constant and everything else variable.</code></pre>
<p>3.313 An expression is thus represented by a variable whose values
are the propositions that contain the expression.</p>
<pre><code> (In the limiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression a proposition.)

 I call such a variable a ‘propositional variable’.</code></pre>
<p>3.314 An expression only has meaning in a proposition. Every variable
can be construed as a propositional variable.</p>
<pre><code> (Even a variable name.)</code></pre>
<p>3.315 If we change a constituent of a proposition into a variable,
then there is a class of propositions that are all the values of the
resulting variable proposition. This class still depends in general on
what we mean,* according to our arbitrary conventions, by parts of the
original proposition. However, if we change into variables all those
signs whose meaning was arbitrarily determined, then there is still such
a class. But this is not now dependent on any convention, only on the
nature of the proposition. It corresponds to a logical form—a logical
prototype.</p>
<p>3.316 What values a propositional variable may take is fixed.</p>
<pre><code> The fixing of the values is the variable.*</code></pre>
<p>3.317 The fixing of the values of propositional variables is the
specification of the propositions whose common mark is the variable.</p>
<pre><code> The fixing is a description of these propositions.

 The fixing will thus be a matter only of symbols, not of their meaning.

 And only this is essential to the fixing, that it is only a description of symbols and states nothing about what is signified.

 The way in which the propositions are described is inessential.</code></pre>
<p>3.318 I construe a proposition—like Frege and Russell—as a function
of the expressions contained in it.</p>
<pre><code>    3.32 A sign is what can be perceived of the symbol.</code></pre>
<p>3.321 Two different symbols can thus have a sign (written or spoken,
etc.) in common with one another—they then signify in different
ways.</p>
<p>3.322 It can never indicate a common mark of two objects that we
signify them by the same sign but through two different modes of
signification. For the sign, of course, is arbitrary. Two different
signs could just as well be chosen, and what would then remain of
something common in the signification?</p>
<p>3.323 In everyday language it occurs extremely often that the same
word signifies in different ways—that is, belongs to different
symbols—or that two words, which signify in different ways, are applied
in a proposition in ostensibly the same way.</p>
<pre><code> Thus the word ‘is’ appears as a copula, as an identity sign, and as an expression of existence;* ‘exist’ as an intransitive verb like ‘go’; ‘identical’ as an adjective; we talk of something, but also say that something happens.

 (In the proposition ‘Green is green’—where the first word is a person’s name, the last an adjective—these words do not simply have different meaning but involve different symbols.)</code></pre>
<p>3.324 Thus the most fundamental confusions easily arise (of which the
whole of philosophy is full).</p>
<p>3.325 To avoid these errors, we must use a sign-language that
excludes them, by not using the same sign in different symbols, and not
using signs that signify in different ways in ostensibly the same way. A
sign-language, that is, that obeys logical grammar—logical syntax.</p>
<pre><code> (Frege’s and Russell’s concept-script* is one such language, though it still fails to exclude all mistakes.)</code></pre>
<p>3.326 To recognize the symbol by its sign, one must pay attention to
the senseful use.*</p>
<p>3.327 A sign determines a logical form only together with its
logical-syntactic use.</p>
<p>3.328 If a sign is not needed, then it is meaningless. That is the
point of Occam’s razor.*</p>
<pre><code> (If everything in the sign-language works as though a sign had meaning, then it does have meaning.*)

    3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role; it must permit being drawn up without talk of the meaning of a sign; it should presuppose only the description of the expressions.</code></pre>
<p>3.331 This remark gives us insight into Russell’s ‘theory of types’:*
Russell’s error is shown in his having to talk of the meaning of signs
in drawing up the rules for them.</p>
<p>3.332 No proposition can state anything about itself, since a
propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is all there is
to the ‘theory of types’).</p>
<p>3.333 That is why a function cannot be its own argument, since the
function sign already contains the prototype of its argument and thus
cannot contain itself.</p>
<pre><code> For let us suppose that the function F( fx) could be its own argument; there would then be a proposition ‘F(F( fx))’, and in this the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, for the inner has the form ϕ( fx), the outer the form ψ(ϕ( fx)). The two functions only have in common the letter ‘F’, but this by itself signifies nothing.

 This becomes immediately clear if, instead of ‘F(F(u)’, we write ‘(∃ϕ):F(ϕ u).ϕ u=Fu’.

 This resolves Russell’s paradox.</code></pre>
<p>3.334 The rules of logical syntax must be self-explanatory,* once it
is known how every single sign signifies.</p>
<pre><code>    3.34 A proposition has essential and accidental features.

 Accidental are the features that arise from the particular way that the propositional sign is generated. Essential are those that enable the proposition to express its sense.</code></pre>
<p>3.341 The essential in a proposition is thus what all propositions
that can express the same sense have in common.</p>
<pre><code> And so too, in general, the essential in a symbol is what all symbols that can fulfil the same purpose have in common.</code></pre>
<p>3.3411 So one could say: the real name is what all symbols that can
signify an object have in common. It would thus progressively turn out
that no kind of composition is essential to a name.*</p>
<p>3.342 In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but this
is not arbitrary: that when we have determined something arbitrarily,
then something else must be the case. (This arises from the essence of
notation.)</p>
<p>3.3421 A particular mode of signification may be unimportant, but it
is always important that this is a possible mode of signification. And
this is how it is generally in philosophy: the particular proves time
and again to be unimportant, but the possibility of each particular
tells us something about the essence of the world.</p>
<p>3.343 Definitions are rules for translating from one language into
another. Every correct sign-language must be translatable into every
other according to such rules: this is what they all have in common.</p>
<p>3.344 What signifies in a symbol is what is common to all those
symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical
syntax.</p>
<p>3.3441 One can express, for example, what is common to all notations
for truth-functions thus: they have in common that they can all be
replaced—for example—by the notation that uses ‘~p’ (‘not-p’) and ‘p v
q’ (‘p or q’).(This typifies the way in which a specific possible
notation can tell us something general.)</p>
<p>3.3442 The sign for a complex, too, is not resolved arbitrarily in
analysis, so that, say, its resolution might be different in every
propositional structure.*</p>
