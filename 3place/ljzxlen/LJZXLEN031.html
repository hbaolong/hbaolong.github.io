Every truth-function is a result of the successive application of the
operation (– – – – – T)(ξ,….) to elementary propositions.</h4>
<pre><code> This operation negates each and every proposition in the right-hand brackets and I call it the negation of these propositions.</code></pre>
<p>5.501 I indicate a bracket-expression whose terms are
propositions—where the order of the terms is irrelevant— by a sign of
the form ‘()’. ‘ξ’ is a variable whose values are the terms of the
bracket-expression, and the line over the variable indicates that it
stands for all its values in the brackets.</p>
<pre><code> (If ξ thus has, say, the 3 values, P, Q, R, then () = (P, Q, R).)

 The values of the variables are fixed.

 The fixing* is a description of the propositions that the variable stands for.

 How the description of the terms of the bracket-expression is given is inessential.

 We can distinguish three kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration. In this case we can simply replace the variable by its constant values. 2. Specification of a function fx, whose values for all values of x are the propositions to be described. 3. Specification of a formal law according to which the propositions are constructed. In this case the terms of the bracket-expression are all the terms of a form-series.</code></pre>
<p>5.502 Instead of ‘(– – – – – T)(ξ,….)’ I thus write ‘(N()’.</p>
<pre><code> N() is the negation of all the values of the propositional variable ξ.</code></pre>
<p>5.503 Since it is obviously easy to express how propositions can be,
or are not to be, constructed by this operation, this must also be
capable of finding exact expression.</p>
<pre><code>    5.51 If ξ has only one value, then N() = ~p (not p); if it has two values, then N() = ~p.~q (neither p nor q).</code></pre>
<p>5.511 How can logic, all-encompassing and mirroring the world, use
such specific hooks and manipulations?* Only by their all connecting
into an infinitely fine network, to the great mirror.</p>
<p>5.512 ‘~p’ is true if ‘p’ is false. In the true proposition ‘~p’,
then, ‘p’ is a false proposition. So how is it that the stroke ‘~’
brings it into agreement with reality?</p>
<pre><code> What negates in ‘~p’, however, is not the ‘~’ but what is in common to all signs of this notation that negate p.

 That is, the common rule according to which ‘~p’, ‘~~~p’. ‘~pv~p’. ‘~p.~p’, etc. etc. (ad infinitum) are constructed. And it is what is common here that mirrors negation.</code></pre>
<p>5.513 One could say: what is common to all symbols that affirm both p
and q is the proposition ‘p.q’. What is common to all symbols that
affirm either p or q is the proposition ‘p v q’.</p>
<pre><code> So, too, one can say: two propositions are opposed to one another if they have nothing in common with one another; and: every proposition has only one negative, since there is only one proposition that lies wholly outside it.

 This shows itself also in Russell’s notation: that ‘q: p v~ p’ says the same as ‘q’; that ‘p v ~p’ says nothing.</code></pre>
<p>5.514 If a notation is established, then there is in it a rule
according to which all propositions negating p are constructed, a rule
according to which all propositions affirming p are constructed, a rule
according to which all propositions affirming p or q are constructed,
and so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols and in them their
sense is mirrored.</p>
<p>5.515 It must show itself in our symbols that what is combined with
one another by ‘v’, ‘.’, etc., must be propositions.</p>
<pre><code> And this is indeed the case, since the symbol ‘p’ and ‘q’ itself presupposes ‘v’, ‘~’, etc. If the sign ‘p’ in ‘p v q’ does not stand for a complex sign, then it cannot have sense by itself; but then the signs ‘p v p’, ‘p.p’, etc., which have the same sense as ‘p’, can have no sense either. But if ‘p v p’ has no sense, then neither can ‘p v q’ have sense.</code></pre>
<p>5.5151 Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with
the sign of the positive? Why should one not be able to express a
negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (For example, if ‘a’
does not stand in a particular relation to ‘b’, then this could express
that aRb is not the case.)But even here the negative proposition is
constructed indirectly by means of the positive.The positive proposition
must presuppose the existence of the negative proposition, and
conversely.</p>
<pre><code>    5.52 If the values of ξ are all the values of a function fx for all values of x, then N() = ~(∃x).fx.</code></pre>
<p>5.521 I separate the concept all from the truth-function.*</p>
<pre><code> Frege and Russell introduced generality in connection with logical product or logical sum. It thus became hard to understand the propositions ‘(∃x).fx’ and ‘(x).fx’, in which both ideas are incorporated.</code></pre>
<p>5.522 The peculiarity of the generality-sign is, first, that it
points to a logical prototype, and second, that it highlights
constants.</p>
<p>5.523 The generality-sign occurs as an argument.</p>
<p>5.524 If objects are given, then all objects are thereby also given
to us.</p>
<pre><code> If elementary propositions are given, then all elementary propositions are thereby also given.</code></pre>
<p>5.525 It is incorrect to paraphrase the proposition ‘(∃x).fx’ as ‘fx
is possible’, as Russell does.</p>
<pre><code> The certainty, possibility, or impossibility of a state of affairs is not expressed by a proposition but by an expression’s being a tautology, a senseful proposition, or a contradiction.

 That precedent to which one invariably wants to appeal must already lie in the symbol itself.</code></pre>
<p>5.526 One can describe the world completely by fully generalized
propositions, that is, without correlating from the outset any name with
a particular object.</p>
<pre><code> To then arrive at the usual mode of expression, one simply has to say, after an expression ‘there is one and only one x that…’, and this x is a.</code></pre>
<p>5.5261 A fully generalized proposition is composite like every other
proposition. (This is shown in our having to mention ‘ϕ’ and ‘x’
separately in ‘(∃x, ϕ).ϕx’. Both stand independently in signifying
relations to the world as in an ungeneralized proposition.) A mark of a
composite symbol: it has something in common with other symbols.</p>
<p>5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition alters something in
the general construction of the world. And the scope that is left open
to its construction by the totality of elementary propositions is
precisely that which the quite general propositions limit.(If an
elementary proposition is true, then, at any rate, one more elementary
proposition is thereby true.)</p>
<pre><code>    5.53 Identity of object I express by identity of sign and not by means of an identity sign.* Difference of objects by difference of signs.</code></pre>
<p>5.5301 That identity is not a relation between objects is
self-evident. This becomes very clear if one considers, for example, the
proposition ‘(x): fx. ⊃. x = a’. What this proposition says is simply
that only a satisfies the function f, and not that only such things that
have a certain relation to a satisfy the function f.Of course, one could
say that it is only a that has this relation to a, but in order to
express this, we would need the identity sign itself.</p>
<p>5.5302 Russell’s definition of ‘=’ doesn’t work, because according to
it one cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common.
(Even if this proposition is never correct, it still has sense.)</p>
<p>5.5303 Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical
is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself
says nothing at all.</p>
<p>5.531 I thus write not ‘f (a,b). a = b’ but ‘f (a,a)’ (or ‘f (b,b)’).
And not ‘f (a,b). ~a = b’ but ‘f (a,b)’.</p>
<p>5.532 And analogously: Not ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). x = y’, but ‘(∃x). f
(x,x)’; and not ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). ~x = y’, but ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y)’.</p>
<pre><code> (So instead of Russell’s ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y)’: ‘(∃x,y). f (x,y). v. (∃x). f (x,x)’.)</code></pre>
<p>5.5321 Instead of ‘(x): fx. ⊃. x = a’ we thus write, for example,
‘(∃x). fx. ⊃. fa: ~(∃x,y). fx. fy’.And the proposition ‘only one x
satisfies f ( )’ reads: ‘(∃x). fx: ~(∃x,y). fx. fy’.</p>
<p>5.533 The identity sign is thus not an essential constituent of a
concept-script.</p>
<p>5.534 And now we see that pseudo-propositions such as ‘a = a’, ‘a = b
. b = c. ⊃. a = c’, ‘(x). x = x’, ‘(∃x). x = a’, etc., cannot even be
written down in a correct concept-script.</p>
<p>5.535 This also resolves all the problems that were connected with
such pseudo-propositions.</p>
<pre><code> All the problems that Russell’s ‘axiom of infinity’ raises can already be solved here.

 What the axiom of infinity tries to say would express itself in language by there being infinitely many names with a different meaning.</code></pre>
<p>5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use
expressions of the form ‘a = a’ or ‘p⊃p’ and the like. And indeed this
happens when one wants to talk of a prototype—of proposition, thing,
etc. Thus Russell, in The Principles of Mathematics, had rendered the
nonsense ‘p is a proposition’ in symbols as ‘p⊃p’ and placed it as
hypothesis before certain propositions so that their argument-places
could only be filled by propositions.*(It is nonsense, from the start,
to place the hypothesis p⊃p before a proposition to ensure that its
arguments have the correct form, because the hypothesis for a
non-proposition as argument becomes not false but nonsensical, and
because the proposition itself becomes nonsensical by the incorrect kind
of argument—in other words, it protects itself from incorrect arguments
just as well, or poorly, as attaching a senseless hypothesis for this
purpose.)</p>
<p>5.5352 Likewise one has tried to express ‘There are no things’ by
‘~(∃x). x = x’. But even if this were a proposition, would it not be
true as well if indeed ‘there were things’ but these were not identical
with themselves?</p>
<pre><code>    5.54 In the general propositional form a proposition occurs in a proposition only as the base of truth-operations.</code></pre>
<p>5.541 At first sight it looks as if a proposition could occur in
another in a different way as well.</p>
<pre><code> Especially in certain propositional forms in psychology, such as ‘A believes that p is the case’ or ‘A thinks p’, etc.

 That is, superficially, it looks here as if the proposition p stood in a kind of relation to an object A.

 (And in modern epistemology (Russell, Moore, etc.) these propositions have been construed in just this way.)</code></pre>
<p>5.542 It is clear, however, that ‘A believes that p’, ‘A thinks p’,
‘A says p’ are of the form ‘“p” says p’: and this does not concern a
correlation of a fact with an object, but the correlation of facts by
means of a correlation of their objects.</p>
<p>5.5421 This also shows that there is no such thing as the soul—the
subject, etc.—as construed in the superficial psychology of today.A
composite soul, that is, would no longer be a soul.</p>
<p>5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition ‘A
judges p’ must show that it is impossible to judge nonsense. (Russell’s
theory does not satisfy this condition.)</p>
<p>5.5423 To perceive a complex is to perceive that its constituents
stand to one another in such and such a way.This may also explain how
the figurecan be seen as a cube in two ways, and all similar
appearances. For we really do see two different facts.(If I look first
at the a corners and only fleetingly at the b ones, then the a corners
appear in front, and conversely.)</p>
<pre><code>    5.55 We must now answer a priori the question as to all possible forms of elementary propositions.

 An elementary proposition consists of names. Since we cannot specify the number of names with different meaning, however, we cannot specify the composition of the elementary proposition either.</code></pre>
<p>5.551 Our basic principle is that every question that can be decided
at all by logic must be capable of being decided straightaway.</p>
<pre><code> (And if we find ourselves having to answer such a problem by looking at the world, then this shows that we are on the wrong track altogether.)</code></pre>
<p>5.552 The ‘experience’ that we need to understand logic is not that
such and such is the case,* but that something is; that, however, is
precisely not an experience.</p>
<pre><code> Logic is prior to every experience—that something is so.

 It is prior to the how, not prior to the what.</code></pre>
<p>5.5521 And if this were not so, then how could we apply logic? One
could say: if there were a logic even if there were no world, then how
could there be a logic given that there is a world?</p>
<p>5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between different
numbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how is
that to be decided?—By experience?</p>
<pre><code> (There is no pre-eminent number.*)</code></pre>
<p>5.554 The specification of any particular form would be completely
arbitrary.</p>
<p>5.5541 It is supposed to be specifiable a priori whether, for
example, I can get into a position where I have to signify something
with a sign for a 27-place relation.</p>
<p>5.5542 But may we even ask this? Can we establish a sign form and not
know whether something can correspond to it?Does the question have a
sense: what must there be in order that something can be-the-case?*</p>
<p>5.555 It is clear that we have a concept of an elementary proposition
irrespective of its particular logical form.</p>
<pre><code> Where one can construct symbols according to a system, however, there the system is what is logically important and not the individual symbols.

 And how would it even be possible for me, in logic, to deal with forms that I can invent; rather, I must deal with whatever makes it possible for me to invent them.</code></pre>
<p>5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementary
propositions. Only what we ourselves construct can we foresee.</p>
<p>5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects. The
limit shows itself again in the totality of elementary propositions.The
hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.</p>
<p>5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be
elementary propositions, then everyone who understands propositions in
their unanalysed form must know it.</p>
<p>5.5563 All propositions of our everyday language are in fact, just as
they are, in perfect logical order.*—That most simple idea that we have
to get across here is not a likeness of the truth but the whole truth
itself.(Our problems are not abstract but perhaps the most concrete that
there are.)</p>
<p>5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions
there are.</p>
<pre><code> What lies in its application logic cannot anticipate.

 This is clear: logic must not conflict with its application.

 Yet logic has to be in contact with its application.

 Thus logic and its application must not overlap one another.</code></pre>
<p>5.5571 If I cannot specify a priori the elementary propositions, then
trying to specify them must lead to obvious nonsense.</p>
