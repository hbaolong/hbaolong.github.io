<h4 id="preface-and-acknowledgements">Preface and Acknowledgements</h4>
<p>In my second year as an undergraduate at Oxford, at an introduction
to transcendental meditation, I met someone who had just moved to
Oxford, having given up his studies in philosophy at Cambridge. He told
me that the only book worth reading was Wittgenstein’s Philosophical
Investigations. I bought a copy at Blackwells on the way back and began
reading it straightaway. I was gripped, and Wittgenstein has been with
me ever since. Wittgenstein’s Later Philosophy was one of the options
available as a PPE student, and I took it in my final year with Peter
Hacker, who initiated me into its mysteries. Peter may well regard some
of the views I now have on Wittgenstein as heretical, but I am grateful
to him for challenging me both then and in all his subsequent writing to
read Wittgenstein with the utmost scholarly care. Since the opening
sections of Wittgenstein’s Investigations discuss his earlier ideas, I
was inevitably led to the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. That text is
notoriously difficult, but the received view in Oxford at the time was
that it contained a set of assumptions and claims that Wittgenstein
spent the rest of his life criticizing. Although he had officially
rejected metaphysics in the Tractatus, there were still some lingering
metaphysical assumptions, and these had to be rooted out as well by a
more ‘grammatical’ investigation.</p>
<p>As a postgraduate, I continued to work on Wittgenstein’s philosophy
but now realized the importance of Russell’s and especially Frege’s work
in understanding what Wittgenstein had been attempting to achieve in the
Tractatus. He both develops some of their views and offers a powerful
critique of others, and it became clear that there was more continuity
between his early and later philosophy than many believed. Some of the
ideas of the Tractatus continue to influence philosophers today, while
others are transformed in subtle ways in his later work, which is only
gradually being appreciated. My doctoral dissertation was on Frege and
Wittgenstein, and I have been teaching and writing about their thought
and the history of analytic philosophy, more generally, ever since. One
of my favourite subjects at school had been German, for which I have to
thank my teacher Ian Waters, and I translated some of Frege’s work for
the edition I published in 1997, The Frege Reader. This made available,
in a single volume, a selection of the key texts that are essential to
understanding analytic philosophy today—and Wittgenstein’s philosophy,
in particular.</p>
<p>In September 2018, Luciana O’Flaherty of OUP contacted me to ask
about publishing the Tractatus in the World’s Classics series, since it
would be out of copyright in 2022, seventy years after Wittgenstein’s
death, and if so, whether a new translation was preferable to the
original one. I assured her that the Tractatus should be included in the
series, as the classic of early twentieth-century analytic philosophy,
and that a new translation was essential. Having translated some of
Frege’s writings, I offered to translate it myself, not least as I used
my own translations of it anyway, or revised those of others, in my
teaching and writing. Luciana welcomed the offer and we met to discuss
the project. I am grateful to Luciana for all her advice and support in
guiding this project through from beginning to end.</p>
<p>I prepared a first draft of the translation in teaching a course on
the Tractatus at the Humboldt University in Berlin in Summer Semester
2020. I circulated a document with three columns—the original German, my
draft translation, and notes on the translation. The aim of the course
was not just to make sense of the Tractatus but also to appreciate the
issues involved in philosophical translation. The participants, many of
whom were native German speakers, were encouraged to comment on the
translation, which helped in improving it. I thank the following for
their valuable contributions: Andreas Berghaus, Sophia Bobic, Simon
Brausch, Rebecca Eilfort, Joao Fidalgo, Milan Hartwig, Solveig Hepp, Ben
Jähnert, Xiaolan Liang, Moritz Markowski, Lea Mosandl, Ben Rangnick, Tom
Raysmith, Josephine Schulze, Peter Schwarz, Lukas Sonnabend, Martin
Spielhagen, Myriam Stihl, Troy Vine, Arjun Wendrich, Christoph Werner,
Bastian Wessalowski, Tao Xu, and Jiantao Zhang. The course was one of
the most enjoyable that I have taught (despite having to do so online
during the pandemic) and our discussions were instructive. The native
German speakers often disagreed about what certain terms meant, which
showed the importance of consulting widely, with the interpretive issues
explained. We also considered alternative renderings and how they might
be back translated into German, which helped us appreciate
Wittgenstein’s actual formulations. In the end, though, the translator
must rely on their own interpretation of the text and their
native-speaker knowledge of the language into which they are translating
to find the best rendering. So I take full responsibility for any errors
or infelicities that remain.</p>
<p>That same summer of 2020 I co-organized with David Stern a two-day
online workshop on translating the Tractatus, supported by a grant from
the British Society for the History of Philosophy, for which I record
our thanks. David had told me at a conference on Wittgenstein the
previous autumn that he was doing a new translation of the Tractatus for
Cambridge University Press, as part of a project that involved
(re)translation of Wittgenstein’s writings leading up to the Tractatus.
We agreed to collaborate, not on the translation itself, on which we had
different views (such as on the rendering of ‘Satz’) and different
constraints (such as our primary intended readership), but on thinking
about the principles of translation to be followed. We invited various
Wittgenstein scholars with an interest in issues of translation and
interpretation, with a view to co-editing a collection of papers on the
subject. The participants in the workshop were Cora Diamond, Philip
Ebert, Juliet Floyd, Jim Klagge, Michael Kremer, Alfred Nordman, Martin
Pilch, Alois Pichler, Erich Reck, Katia Saporiti, Joachim Schulte, Hans
Sluga, Mark Textor, and two of my PhD students, Troy Vine and Thomas
Raysmith, who made notes on the meetings. David and I each circulated in
advance a paper formulating our views on translating the Tractatus, and
we received extremely helpful feedback, for which we are both very
grateful. I am also indebted to David for the exchanges we have had, and
our ongoing collaboration on the edited collection. I have not yet seen
a draft of his translation, other than of a few key propositions, but I
look forward to that, as a valuable complement to my own. The more good
translations there are of a text, the more one can triangulate on its
meaning.</p>
<p>Following the workshop I circulated various drafts of the
translation, as I continued to revise it, not just to the participants
in the workshop but to several others, including Wolfgang Kienzler, Han
Linhe, Jiang Yi, David Hyder, Joshua Eisenthal, and Sophia Arbeiter. I
also gave a talk on translating the Tractatus at an online conference
organized by Huang Min at Sun Yat-sen University in China in November
2021. I thank all those who sent me comments (including those just
named), often on specific terms and passages on which they had
particular views. I did not always follow their advice, but it helped in
coming to what I hope were the right decisions. I would especially like
to thank Wolfgang Kienzler and Martin Pilch for detailed email exchange
on numerous passages.</p>
<p>Drafts of the editorial material have also been discussed with
various people, including members of the Research Colloquium that I run
at the Humboldt University in Berlin, students taking my online course
on the Tractatus at Tsinghua University in Beijing, and some of my
colleagues at the University of Aberdeen. For comments on this, as well
as on specific points of translation, I am grateful to the following:
Roland Bolz, Paul Cultus, Yael Gazit, Yuchen Guo, Eva Henke, Hang Huang,
Jing Huang, Asher Jiang, Oscar Joffe, Jesper Kallestrup, Louis Kohlmann,
Martha Kunicki, Xiaolan Liang, Matthias Statzkowski, Ulrich Stegmann,
Norman Stockman, Hamid Taieb, Stephan Torre, and Tue Trinh. Three others
deserve special thanks: Cheryl Misak and Martin Pilch (again), who
helped me with the Note on the Text, and Erich Reck, who provided
detailed comments on the penultimate draft of the Introduction.
Responsibility for these as well, of course, remains with me.</p>
<p>As always, I am grateful to my wife Sharon Macdonald and our children
Tara, Thomas, and Harriet, for many discussions over the years as we
have grappled with the German language in our different ways, but
especially for comments on specific issues in translating the Tractatus.
Sharon has read and provided invaluable help on all the editorial
material, as well as the translation itself, and patiently supported me
in the periods of obsessive focus that were required to complete the
various parts.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank all those at OUP who have helped
prepare this book for production, not just Luciana O’Flaherty (again)
but also (and especially in this last stage) Henry Clarke, Bharath
Krishnamoorthy, Daniel Gill, and the eagle-eyed copy-editor Dorothy
McCarthy. I write this Preface almost a century to the day after the
publication of the first English translation of the Tractatus. I hope
that this new translation, and the editorial material provided, will
usher in a new phase in the reception of this extraordinary work.</p>
