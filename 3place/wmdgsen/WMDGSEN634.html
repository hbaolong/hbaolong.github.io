<p>1815-40</p>
<p>I. THE FAMILY</p>
<p>H IS mother survived him by fifteen years, dying at the age of
eighty-six.</p>
<p>Her career was almost a summary of motherhood through the ages:
uncertain mate, many children, joys and sorrows, fulfillment and
bereave- ment, horror and loneliness, wonderment and hope. She had seen
all the triumphs, riches, and misfortunes of her children, had saved for
the day when they might need her; “Who knows but I may one day have to
pro - vide for all these kings?” 1 She lived ab stemiously to the end,
protected and honored by the Pope whom her son had abused. From the
standpoint of the race she was the strongest and sanest of all the
Bonapartes.</p>
<p>Joseph, her oldest child, fond of books and money, happily married to
Julie Clary, loved and burdened by his imperial brother, served him to
the best of his limited ability, found a refuge in America after the
Empire col- lapsed, returned to Europe, lived in rural peace near Genoa,
and died in Florence in 1844, aged seventy-six.</p>
<p>Lucien, after rising to place under the Directory, and helping his
brother to overthrow it, opposed Napoleon’s dictatorship, married
against the im - perial will, abandoned the scramble for power, became a
papal prince, sailed for America, was captured by a British ship, was
kept under surveillance in England, found his way to Napoleon’s side in
the Hundred Days, defended him in the chambers, fled to Rome after the
Second Abdication, and died at Viterbo in 1 840.</p>
<p>Louis Bonaparte, after abandoning his Holland throne, and separating
from Hortense, lived in Bohemia, Austria, and Italy, and died six years
be- fore his third son became Emperor Napoleon III.</p>
<p>Jerome enjoyed his royal wealth in Westphalia, failed as a general in
the first month of the Russian campaign, returned to his throne, lost it
to the Allies in 1813, fought valiantly at Waterloo, and was almost the
last French- man to leave the field of defeat. 2 After the Second
Abdication he wandered from country to country, returned to France in
1847, saw his nephew rise to power, became president of the Senate under
Napoleon III, and died in i860 after seventy-six years of a full life in
an age when every year was a decade in events.</p>
<p>Elisa Bonaparte Bacciocchi was the oldest and ablest of Napoleon’s
three</p>
<p>770</p>
<p>CHAP, xl) afterward 77 1</p>
<p>sisters. We have noted her success as ruler of Tuscany, the cultural
Attica of Italy. When it became evident that her brother could not
withstand the united Allies, she withdrew to Naples, and joined her
sister Caroline in help- ing Murat to preserve his throne.</p>
<p>Murat, after leading the cavalry for Napoleon at Leipzig, returned to
Naples, entered into an alliance with Austria (January 8, 1814), and
pledged the use of his army to the coalition against Napoleon, in
exchange for Aus- tria’s support of has authority in Naples. The Allies
refused to sanction this pact. When Napoleon escaped from Elba, Murat
risked everything by appealing to all Italy to join him in a war of
independence against all foreign rule (March 30, 1815). His wife,
Caroline, and her sister Elisa left him and found refuge in Vienna.
Murat was defeated at Tolentino by an Austrian army (May 2) and fled to
France, then to Corsica; Ferdinand IV recovered his Neapolitan throne.
After the battle of Waterloo, Murat, now a man without a country,
crossed from Corsica to Calabria with a handful of men, was captured,
court-martialed, and shot (October 13). Napoleon at St. Helena descr
ibed him fondly but mercilessly as “the bravest of men in the face of
the enemy, incomparable on the batdefield, but a fool in his actions
everywhere else.” 3</p>
<p>The most interesting of Napoleon’s relatives was his sister Pauline
(1780 -</p>
<p>1825). She was fated to spread happiness and trouble, for she was
rated the most beautiful woman of her time. The men who saw her never
forgot her, and the women who saw her never forgave her. She was not
well adapted for monogamy, but she was apparendy a loving wife to her
first husband, General Leclerc, sharing his danger and yellow fever in
St.-Domingue. When he died (1802) she returned to Paris; after a decent
period of mourn- ing she grew a new wealth of hair, bathed in five
gallons of fresh milk every day, 4 opened a salon, and charmed husbands
by her beauty, and some by her generosity. Napoleon, who himself was
chastely moved by her Pheidian form, hurried to marry her to the rich
and handsome Prince Ca- millo Borghese (1803).</p>
<p>In Florence (1805) Canova asked her to pose for a statue of Diana the
huntress; she was inclined to consent; but when she heard that Diana had
asked Jupiter to endow her with eternal virginity, she laughed the idea
away. She was persuaded, however, to pose for a nearly nude figure of
Venus Victrix, which has made the Galleria Borghese one of the most
frequented places in Rome. Borghese himself, conscious of his
inadequacy, left for his military duties as an officer under Napoleon.
Pauline amused herself scan- dalously, with some injury to her health,
but there is no clear evidence that she contracted syphilis. 5</p>
<p>This scandalous goddess was also a model of kindness, except to
Josephine, against whom all the Bonapartes except Napoleon waged
unremitting war. She gave abundantly, won many lasting friendships, even
among her dis- carded lovers, and was more loyal to Napoleon than any
other Bonaparte except her mother. She went out of her way to meet and
console her un- happy brother on his journey to Frejus in 1814, and soon
she followed him</p>
<p>77 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XL</p>
<p>o Elba. There she played hostess for him, and enlivened his life, and
that of the island, with her parties, plays, and joie de vivre. When he
left for the last gamble she gave him her finest necklace. Marchand
managed to get it through to St. Helena. She was planning to go there
when she received news of Napoleon’s death. She survived him by only
four years, surrendering to cancer 6 (June 5, 1825) at the age of
forty-four. Her husband forgave her sins, rejoined her in her last year,
and closed her eyes when she died.</p>
<p>Josephine had died (May 29, 1814) of a chill caught while receiving a
visit from Czar Alexander at Malmaison. 7 Her daughter, Hortense de
Beau- harnais (1783-1837), after her separation from Louis Bonaparte,
had been protected by the Emperor, and later by the Czar. She did not
live to see her son become Napoleon III. Hortense’s brother, Eugene,
remained faithful t o his adoptive father until the First Abdication;
five days thereafter he retired with his wife to Munich, and was
joyfully received by his father-in-law, the King of Bavaria. When he
died there (February 21, 1824), aged only forty- three, all factions
united in honoring him.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, taken from France against her will, was received in
Vienna as a fauldess princess rescued from a sacrificial altar. She was
allowed to keep Meneval as her devoted gentleman-in-waiting, and he did
his best to counter the influences that daily sought to detach her from
fidelity to Napoleon. Meneval tells us that in her five weeks in Vienna
she received several letters from her husband, found no way of sending a
reply, but secretly hoped to join him in Elba. 8 Her father, fearful for
her health in a Vienna preparing for a triumphant Congress of the
Allies, sent her to take the waters at Aix- les-Bains; and on July 1,
1814, he appointed Count Adam von Neipperg to join her there as her
personal aide. Though he was thirty-nine and she only twenty-two,
propinquity had its way, and she accepted him as a lover when all chance
seemed gone of reunion with Napoleon. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna
awarded her the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla. Neipperg
accompanied her, and shared in the government. In 1817 she bore him a
daughter. Napoleon heard of this in St. Helena, but he never took her
pic- ture down from the wall of his Longwood room, and, as we have seen,
spoke of her tenderly in his will. After Napoleon’s death she married
Neip - perg, and lived with him in apparently faithful union till his
death (1829). She married again in 1834, and died in 1847. All
circumstances considered, she seems to have been a good woman, not
deserving of the stones that have been thrown upon her memory.</p>
<p>Her son by Napoleon — called “King of Rome” (the traditional title of
the heir to the Holy Roman Emperor) and “L’Aiglon” (the young eagle)—
had been separated from his mother on leaving Paris, had been
rechristened Duke of Reichstadt, and had been kept at the court of
Vienna under constant tute- lage in Hapsburg traditions. He remained
faithful to the memory of his father, dreamed of having someday a
kingdom of his own, suffered from re- peated illnesses, and died of
pulmonary tuberculosis, in the Palace of Schon- brunn, Vienna, on July
22, 1 83 2, at the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>CHAP. XL)</p>
<p>AFTERWARD</p>
<p>773</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>HOMECOMING</li>
</ol>
<p>Even as that pretty visage faded from French memory the image of
Napo- leon himself took on a new living form in recollection and
imagination. As time closed old wounds, and filled the places — in
families, fields, and shops — of those millions who had gone to the wars
and never returned, the picture of the age of Napoleon grew brighter and
more heroic beyond any remem- bered precedent in secular history.</p>
<p>First of all, the old soldiers recalled their exploits and forgot
their</p>
<p>“groans”; they embellished Napoleon’s victories, and seldom blamed
him for a defeat; they loved him as probably no other commander has ever
been loved. The aging grenadier became an oracle in his village, and was
en- shrined in a thousand poems, tales, and songs. In “Le Vieux Drapeau”
(The Old Standard) and a hundred other lays Pierre de Beranger
(1780-1857) idealized Napoleon and his campaigns, and satirized the
domineering nobles and the land-hungry bishops with such point and verve
that he was im- prisoned by the Bourbon government (1821, 1828). Victor
Hugo wrote an “Ode to the Column,” celebrating the Vendome pillar and
its historical re - liefs and crowning figure of the Emperor, taken down
(1815) and then restored (1833). Balzac, in Le Medecin de campagne
(1833), vividly pic- tured a proud veteran denouncing the Bourbons for
issuing the report that Napoleon was dead; on the contrary, he affirmed,
Napoleon was still alive, and was “the child of God made to be the
father of the soldier.” 9 Stendhal not only sprinkled his novels with
praise of Napoleon, he published in 1837 a Vie de Napoleon whose tenor
was announced in the preface — “The love of Napoleon is the only passion
that is left in me”; and he called Napoleon “the greatest man the world
has seen since Caesar.” 10</p>
<p>Napoleon would probably have accepted this estimate, with some uncer-
tainty about Caesar. He had never lost hope that France would come back
to him. He solaced his exile with the hope that Gallic resentment of his
im- prisonment would restore French devotion to him. “When I am gone,”
he to ld O’Meara, “there will be a reaction in my favor…. It is my
martyrdom that will restore the crown of France to my dynasty…. Ere
twenty years have elapsed, when I am dead and buried, you will see
another revolution in France.” 11 Both of these p redictions were
fulfilled.</p>
<p>So he dictated his memoirs to revitalize his image, and they served
their purpose well. His account of the battle of Waterloo, told to
Gourgaud, was smuggled out of St. Helena and was published in Paris in
1820; Las Cases tells us that it made a sensation. 12 In 182 1-22 six
more volumes of his dictated autobiography were issued in France.
Rapidly the Emperor’s own story made its way, and played a major part in
molding the “legend” that made him, dead, a living force in France.</p>
<p>His companions became his apostles. O’Meara defended him bravely</p>
<p>774</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XL</p>
<ol start="1822" type="1">
<li>in the land of his sturdiest enemies. Las Cases made him faultless
in four volumes (1823) that became the bible of the new inspiring creed.
The Comte de Montholon’s extensive report did not appear till 1847,
Gourgaud’s and Bertrand’s only after their deaths; but meanwhile their
living testimony fed the faith. Montholon brought back, also, the
Emperor’s “Deathbed In - struction s to His Son,” recommending virtues
that might improve upon the imperial past: caution, moderation,
constitutional rule, freedom of the press, and, toward the world, a
policy of peace. Now, too, came a favorite coun- sel: “Let my son often
read, and reflect on, history; this is the only true philosophy.”
13</li>
</ol>
<p>Even in the testimony of his devout companions the great Emperor,
amid the irritations of confinement and disease, had developed the
faults natural to old age; but these weaknesses were now forgotten in
the perspective of his martial triumphs, his administrative legacy, and
the penetrating sharpness of his mind. He had in effect repudiated most
of the Revolution, replacing liberty with absolutism, equality with
aristocracy, fraternity with discipline; but in his refurbished image he
was again the Son of the Revolution, and the Jacobins, once his devoted
and persecuted enemies, now gathered around his memory. But, while
Napoleon was purifying his record with punish- ment, the Bourbon rule
that had replaced him outwore its initial acceptance; Louis XVIII,
himself a reasonable man, touched with the Enlightenment, had allowed
his court to be dominated by royalists who had forgiven noth- ing and
wanted everything, including their old estates and authority, and a
government unhampered by representative institutions. Resistance had
been met with a “White Terror” of spies and hunts and hasty executions.
Old soldiers could not forget the hounding and shooting of Ney. Against
all this the Army still cherished its memory of the Petit Caporal who
had chatted with conscripts around a campfire, who had promoted them
without class prejudice or bureaucratic delay, and who had made the
Grande Armee the terror of kings and the pride of France. The peasants
remembered that Na- poleon had protected them against the demands of the
nobility and the clergy; the proletariat had prospered under his rule;
the middle classes had grown in wealth and social acceptance. Millions
of Frenchmen felt that with all his autocracy Napoleon had preserved the
essentials of the Revolution: the end of feudalism and its toilsome
tolls and dues; the opening of advance- ment to ability of whatever
class; the equality of all before the law; the administration of justice
according to explicit, written, and nationally uni- form law.</p>
<p>So, within twenty years after his death, Napoleon had been reborn,
and again dominated t he minds and imagination of men. “The world
belongs to Napoleon,” wrote Chateaubriand; “… living, he failed to win
the world; dead, he possesses it.” 14 The modest Revolution of 1830 was
helped by the new Bonapartist sentiment. The direct Bourbon line ended
with the abdica- tion of Charles X; the new King, Louis Philippe, of the
Orleanist branch of the Bourbons, was the son of Louis-Philippe- Joseph,
Due d’ Orleans, who had called himself Philippe-Lgalite and had voted
for the execution of</p>
<p>CHAP. XL)</p>
<p>AFTERWARD</p>
<p>775</p>
<p>Louis XVI. The new King for a time courted the support of the Bona-
partists; he adopted the tricolor emblems of the imperial regime, and
ordered the restoration of the figure of Napoleon to the top of the
Vendome Col- umn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the dead man’s will had been published, and its second
clause seemed to be the final imperial command: “It is my wish that my
ashes may repose on the banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French
people, whom I have loved so well.” Throughout France, quietly here and
there, then more widely and audibly, rose the appeal of the nation:
“Bring him home!” Let France give its hero the funeral that such a man
deserved: let the Triumph of the Ashes (so it came to be called) redeem
the shame of that dreary imprisonment! The cry reached the government;
its Minister of For- eign Affairs, Louis-Adolphe Thiers (1797-1877) —
who would write the greatest of all histories of Napoleon,* and who was
to be elected (in 1871) first president of the Third Republic — was
apparently the one who suggested to his associates, and then, with them,
to the King: Let us ask Great Britain’s consent for the removal of
Napoleon’s remains to Paris. Louis Philippe agreed; to identify himself
with such a move would win the hearts of the French people. The Cabinet
sounded out the heads of the British govern- ment. Lord Palmerston
replied at once and handsomely: “The government of her Britannic Majesty
hopes that the promptness of its answer may be considered in France as a
proof of its desire to blot out the last trace of those national
animosities which, during the lifetime of the Emperor, armed Eng- land
and France against each other.” 15</p>
<p>The King commissioned his son Francois, Prince de Joinville, to go to
St. Helena, and bring back the remains of Napoleon. On July 7, 1840, the
Prince sailed from Toulon on the Belle Poule, accompanied by Generals
Bertrand and Gourgaud, the Comte de Las Cases, and Napoleon’s most inti
- mate servant, Marchand, who together would decide the authenticity of
the corpse. They reached St. Helena on October 8; after many formalities
they saw the body exhumed; they identified it; and on November 30 they
arrived with it at Cherbourg.</p>
<p>There began what was surely the longest funeral in history. The
coffin was transferred to the steamer Normandie , which took it to Val
de la Haye, on the Seine below Rouen; there it was transferred to a
river barge, on which a small temple had been improvised; under this
temple — guarded, one at each corner, by Bertrand, Gourgaud, Las Cases,
and Marchand — the coffin was borne in leisurely state up the Seine,
stopping at major towns for celebra- tions on the bank. 16 At
Courbevoie, four miles north of Paris, it was trans- ferred to a
decorated funeral coach, which was drawn in a procession of soldiers,
sailors, and diverse dignitaries through Neuilly, and under the Arc de
Triomphe, and along the Champs-Llysees lined on either side by ap-
plauding and rejoicing multitudes. 17 Late on that bitter-cold day,
December 15, 1840, the corpse at last reached its destination, the
magnificently domed</p>

<p>77 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XL</p>
<p>church of the Hotel des Invalides. The aisles and nave were crowded
with thousands of silent spectators as twenty-four seamen bore the heavy
coffin to the altar, where the Prince de Joinville addressed his father
the King: “Sire, I present to you the body of the Emperor of France”; to
which Louis Philippe replied, “I receive it in the name of France.”
Bertrand laid Napo - leon’s sword upon the coffin; Gourgaud added the
Emperor’s hat; a requiem Mass was sung to Mozart’s music; and the
Emperor was at l ast where he had wished his remains to be — in the
heart of Paris, on the banks of the Seine.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>PERSPECTIVE</li>
</ol>
<p>Recovering from him, we too, authors and readers, fulfill his
prediction — that the world would greet his death with an exhalation of
relief. He was an exhausting force, a phenomenon of energy contained and
explosive, a rising, burning, waning flame that consumed those who
touched him intimately. We have not found in history another soul that
burned so intensely and so long. That will, at first so hesitant,
fearful, and morose, discovered its weap- ons and resources in a
piercing mind and eye; it became confident, rash, im- perious, rioting
in grasp and power; until the gods, seeing no measure in him, bound
lesser wills in union to pursue him, comer him, seize him, and chain him
to a rock until his fire should bum out. This was one of the great
dramas of history, and still awaits its Aeschylus.</p>
<p>But even in his lifetime he had a Hegel, who, unblinded by frontiers,
saw in him a world force — the compulsion of events and circumstances
speaking through a man — forging fragments into a unity, and chaos into
effective sig- nificance. Here — first in France, then in Central Europe
— was the “Zeitgeist, or Spirit of the Time: the need and command for
order, ending the dis- ruptive excess of individualistic liberty and
fragmented rule. In this sense Napoleon was a progressive force,
establishing political stability, restoring morality, disciplining
character, modernizing, clarifying, codifying law, protecting life and
property, ending or mitigating feudalism, reassuring peasants, aiding
industry, maintaining a sound currency, cleansing and im- proving
administration and the judiciary, encouraging science and art (but
discouraging literature and chaining the press), budding schools,
beautifying cities, repairing some of the ravages of war. Helped by his
prodding, Europe advanced half a century during the fifteen years of his
rale.</p>
<p>He was not the most powerful and enduring force of his time. Stronger
was the Industrial Revolution, which made Great Britain rich enough in
iron and gold to implement and finance Napoleon’s fall, then made Europe
vigorous enough to master the globe, then made America resourceful
enough to rescue and replenish Europe, then… Only less strong than the
Industrial Revolution, but far stronger and more lasting than the “Son
of the Revolution,” was the revolution that began in France in 1789 and
then spread its effects through Europe in the replacement of feudal
bonds and dues with individual rights, and the worldwide action of the
rival hungers</p>
<p>CHAP. XL)</p>
<p>AFTERWARD</p>
<p>777</p>
<p>hat found clearest voice in the French Revolution: the hunger for
freedom — of movement, growth, enterprise, worship, thought, speech, and
press; and the hunger for equality — of access to opportunity,
education, health, and legal justice. These hostile hungers have taken
their turn in dominating the history of modem man: the hunger for
liberty, to the detriment of equality, was the recurrent theme of the
nineteenth century in Europe and America; the hunger for equality, at
the cost of liberty, has been the dominant aspect of European and
American history in the twentieth century. The French Revolution, and
the American Revolution as interpreted by Jefferson, car- ried liberty
to excess, freeing individualism to the point of a destructive dis -
order, and freeing superior ability to repeated crises of concentrated
wealth. Napoleon provided the discipline that checked political,
economic, and moral disorder in postrevolutionary France; no discipline
has checked similar disorder in our times.</p>
<p>When Napoleon, after the Peace of Tilsit (1807), carried order to
excess, subordinating statesmanship to the will to power, he no longer
represented the spirit of the time. He imitated and joined the absolute
Continental mon- archies that he had fought; he envied and courted the
aristocracy that scorned him and plotted to destroy him; he became a
reactionary force when France was again hungering for freedom and
calling for democracy.</p>
<p>It is another humor of history that whereas in his lifetime Napoleon
had served to embody his country’s need for order after a riot of
freedom, he became again after his death — and by the power of his
remodeling legend — the Son of the Revolution, the enemy of absolutism
and aristocracy, the symbol of revolt, the manageable mouthpiece of the
recurrent cry for lib- erty. In 1799 opportunity and character had made
him a dictator almost larger than history; after 1815 and his
imprisonment, and still more after 1821 and his death, public
imagination remade him, for half a century, into the most persuasive
apostle of freedom. Few great men have remained, after death, what they
had been during their lives.</p>
<p>Was he a warmonger? Was he responsible for those successive and accu-
mulating wars, those millions of youths snuffed out with nothing but the
anesthesia of battle to ease their passing, and those millions of
desolate women to whom they never returned? Hear him. He confessed to
having enjoyed generalship, because he had been trained to military art,
and prac- ticed it well; but how often he had longed to be free from war
in order to practice his other art — of administration, of turning the
chaos of life into productive order by establishing a strong structure
of law and mo- rality! How many times he had offered to treat for peace,
and had been insulted and rebuffed! The Italians had welcomed him as a
liberator, both in 1796 and in 1800; the Austrians had resubjected them
while he was in Egypt; the Austrians had attacked him while he was busy
on the Channel, and Prussia and Russia had joined in that attack without
his having injured them. Austria had again attacked him while he was
fighting in Spain; Russia had violated her pledge to support him in such
a situation; Russia at Tilsit had pledged observance of the Continental
Blockade against British goods,</p>
<p>77 8 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XL</p>
<p>which was the only way in which France could retaliate against
British blockade of French ports, and British capture of French vessels
and colonies. British gold had financed coalition after coalition
against him, even when his other enemies were inclined to peace; the
British government had treated him like a criminal despite his voluntary
surrender, whereas he himself had always dealt humanely and courteously
with enemy officers captured in battle. His enemies had resolved to
destroy him because he had won a kingdom by his own services and labors
instead of by the accident of birth.</p>
<p>So ran Napoleon’s defense. English historians, usually fair, German
his - torians, usually accurate, and many French historians, usually
patriotic (Michelet, Lanfrey, Taine, Lefebvre), unite in condemning the
Corsican. He was a usurper, who profited from the execution of Louis
XVI, and the collapse of the corrupt Directory, to seize the throne that
belonged to Louis XVIII; such usurpations could not be tolerated, since
they disturbed a political stability precious to all the nations of
Europe. His invitations to peace conferences were not taken seriously,
since they concealed intolerable demands like recognition of French
control of Switzerland and Italy, and, later, of the German Rhineland.
His skill in war tempted him to wage war, so that he was a constant
threat not only to the peace-preserving balance of power but to the
whole political structure of European life. The enormous indemnities
which he exacted after his victories left the defeated govern- ments
incapable of financing any further resistance to his fantastic dream of
uniting all Europe under French sovereignty and Napoleonic rule; they
were quite justified in accepting British subsidies. The capture of
French colonies as a means of bringing France to her senses was quite in
accord with the practice of governments in eighteenth-century wars.
Could Catholic governments like that of Austria agree to live under
domination by an obvi- ous atheist who was ruthlessly persecuting the
Pope who had consecrated him, and who had no weapon but his piety?
Napoleon had been generously treated by the Allies after his first
abdication; he had violated his agreement by leaving Elba and compelling
Europe to spend millions in revenues, and thousands of lives, to subdue
and capture him; England and her allies were justified in isolating him
beyond likelihood of his disturbing the peace of Europe again.</p>
<p>Truth is seldom simple; often it has a right and a left hand, and
moves on two feet. Was there ever, since Ashoka, a major war in which
one nation ad- mitted the superior justice of the enemy’s cause? It is
part of the average citizen’s nature to m ake his God a particeps
criminis in the wars of his coun- try. No superstate would solve the
problem, for some of our greatest wars have been civil. The best we may
hope for is to persuade more and more men and women to require their
governments to submit more and more of their disputes to an
international court or a league of nations; but we must not expect any
nation to submit to arbitration of what it considers a matter of life
and death. Self-preservation remains the basic law of life.</p>
<p>Within that limit the philosopher may seek to practice his trade,
which is to understand and forgive. We can understand Emperor Francis
II, shorn</p>
<p>CHAP. XL)</p>
<p>AFTERWARD</p>
<p>779</p>
<p>by Napoleon of half his state, driven from his lovely capital,
returning to it still loved by his people, but humiliated and despoiled.
We can understand a good Catholic being shocked by the harsh treatment
of a gentle Pope — who would later ask the Allies to soften the
conditions of his persecutor’s imprisonment. We can understand Czar
Alexander’s reluctance to sacrifice his country’s commerce to Napoleon’s
Continental Blockade. We can under - stand England’s resolve to defend
that balance of power upon which its security from external domination
depended. And we can understand France’s defense of the man who had
rescued its government and morals from suicidal chaos, who had broadened
its borders by brilliant victories, and had brought it unprecedented
glory.</p>
<p>No, this fascinating man was no mere ogre of murder and destruction.
He was led by his will to power, by the unchecked immensity of his
dream; he was an autocrat confident that he knew better than their
citizens what was good for France and Europe. But he was also, in his
own fashion, a generous man, quick to forgive, secretly tender,
hesitating for years before divorcing the frail Josephine. And we may
say for him that he suffered and atoned, in his diseases and his
doctors, in his retreat from Russia, in his living death on
St. Helena.</p>
<p>He remains the outstanding figure of his time, with something noble
about him that survives despite his selfishness in power and his
occasional descents from grandeur in defeat. He thought we should not
see his like again for five hundred years. We hope not; and yet it is
good — and enough — to behold and suffer, once in a millennium, the
power and limits of the human mind.</p>
