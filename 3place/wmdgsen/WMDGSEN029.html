The Political and Moral Foundations</h4>
<p>A tentative approach</p>
<p>I F, NOW, we try to picture the Japan that died in 1853, we
should</p>
<p>remember that it may be as hard to understand, as it might be to
fight, a people five thousand miles distant, and differing from us in
color and language, government and religion, manners and morals,
character and ideals, literature and art. Hearn was more intimate with
Japan than any other Western writer of his time, and yet he spoke of
“the immense diffi - culty of perceiving and comprehending what
underlies the surface of Japa- nese life.” 1 “Your information about
us,” a genial Japanese essayist re - minds the Occident, “is based on
the meagre translations of our immense literature, if not on the
unreliable anecdotes of passing travelers…. We Asiatics are often
appalled by the curious web of facts and fancies which has been woven
concerning us. We are pictured as living on the perfume of the lotus, if
not on mice and cockroaches.” 2 What follows, therefore, is a tentative
approach — based upon the briefest direct acquaintance — to Jap- anese
civilization and character; each student must correct it by long and
personal experience. The first lesson of philosophy is that we may all
be mistaken.</p>
<p>I. THE SAMURAI</p>
<p>The powerless emperor — The powers of the “shogun”— The sword of the
“Samurai”— The code of the “Samurai”— “Hara - kiri”—</p>
<p>The Forty- seven “ Ronin”— A commuted sentence</p>
<p>Theoretically at the head of the nation was the divine emperor. The
actually ruling house — the hereditary shogunate — allowed the emperor
and his court 5,000 a year for maintaining the impressive and useful
fiction of uninterrupted rule.* Many people of the court practised some
domestic handicraft to sustain themselves: some made umbrellas, others
made chop-</p>
<ul>
<li>This sum, however, was probably equivalent to a quarter of a million
dollars in current American money.</li>
</ul>
<p>845</p>
<p>846 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xsticks, or toothpicks, or playing cards. The Tokugawa shoguns made
it a principle to leave the emperor no authority whatever, to seclude
him from the people, to surround him with women, and to weaken him with
effem- inacy and idleness. The imperial family yielded its powers
gracefully, and contented itself with dictating the fashions of
aristocratic dress.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile the shogun luxuriated in the slowly growing wealth of</p>
<p>Japan, and assumed prerogatives normally belonging to the emperor.
When he was borne through the streets in his ox-carriage or palanquin
the police required every house along the route, and all the shutters of
upper windows, to be closed; all fires were to be extinguished, all dogs
and cats were to be locked up, and the people themselves were to kneel
by the roadside with their heads upon their hands and their hands upon
the ground. 4 The shogun had a large personal retinue, including four
jesters, and eight cultured ladies dedicated to entertain him without
reserve. 5 He was advised by a cabinet of twelve members: a “Great
Senior,” five</p>
<p>“Seniors” or ministers, and six “Sub - Elders” who formed a junior
council. As in China, a Board of Censors supervised all administrative
offices, and kept watch upon the feudal lords. These lords, or Daimyo
(“Great</p>
<p>Name”), formally acknowledged allegiance only to the emperor; and
some of them, like the Shimadzu family that ruled Satsuma, successfully
limited the shogun’s authority, and finally overthrew it.</p>
<p>Below the lords were the baronets, and below these the squires; and
serving the lords were a million or more Samurai — sword-bearing guards-
men. The basic principle of Japanese feudal society was that every
gentle- man was a soldier, and every soldier a gentleman;* here lay the
sharpest difference between Japan and that pacific China which thought
that every gentleman should be a scholar rather than a warrior. Though
they loved, and partly formed themselves on, such swashbuckling novels
as the Chin- ese Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Samurai scorned mere
learning, and called the literary savant a book-smelling sot. 7 They had
many privi- leges: they were exempt from taxation, received a regular
stipend of rice from the baron whom they served, and performed no labor
except occa- sionally to die for their country. They looked down upon
love as a</p>
<p>graceful game, and preferred Greek friendship; they made a business
of gambling and brawling, and kept their swords in condition by paying
the executioner to let them cut off condemned heads.* His sword, in
Iyeyasu’s famous phrase, was “the soul of the Samurai” and found
remarkably fre - quent expression despite prolonged national peace. He
had the right, ac-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 847</p>
<p>cording to Iyeyasu,’ to cut down at once any member of the lower
classes who offended him; and when his steel was new and he wished to
make trial of it, he was as likely to try it on a beggar as on a dog. 10
“A famous swordsman having obtained a new sword,” says Longford, “took
up his place by the Nihon Bashi (the central bridge of Yedo) to await a
chance of testing it. By and by a fat peasant came along, merrily drunk,
and the swordsman dealt him the Nashi-wari (pear-splitter) so
effectively that he cut him right through from the top of his head down
to the fork. The peasant continued on his way, not knowing that anything
had happened to him, till he stumbled against a coolie, and fell in two
neatly severed pieces.” 11 Of such trivial consequence is the
difference, so troublesome to philosophers, between the One and the
Many.</p>
<p>The Samurai had other graces than this jolly despatch with which they
transformed time into eternity. They accepted a stem code of honor —
Bushido* or the Way of the Knight — whose central theory was its defini-
tion of virtue: “the power of deciding upon a certain course of conduct
in accordance with reason, without wavering; to die when it is right to
die, to strike when it is right to strike.” 10 They were tried by their
own</p>
<p>A word coined by the late Inazo Nitobe.</p>
<p>848 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. YYT</p>
<p>XThe final law of Bushido was hara-kiri — suicide by disembowelment.
The occasions when this would be expected of a Samurai were almost be-
yond count, and the practice of it so frequent that little notice was
taken of it. If a man of rank had been condemned to death he was
allowed, as an expression of the emperor’s esteem, to cut through his
abdomen from left to right and then down to the pelvis with the small
sword which he always carried for this purpose. If he had been defeated
in battle, or had been com- pelled to surrender, he was as like as not
to rip open his belly. ( Hara-kiri means belly-cutting; it is a vulgar
word seldom used by the Japanese, who prefer to call it seppuku.) When,
in 1895, Japan yielded to European pres- sure and abandoned Liaotung,
forty military men committed hara-kiri in protest. During the war of
1905 many officers and men in the Japanese navy killed themselves rather
than be captured by the Russians. If his su- perior did something
offensive to him, the good Samurai might gash himself to death at his
master’s gate. The art of seppuku— the. precise ritual of rip- ping —
was one of the first items in the education of Samurai youth; and the
last tribute of affection that could be paid to a friend was to stand by
him and cut off his head as soon as he had carved his paunch.” Out of
this train - ing, and the traditions bound up with it, has come some
part of the Japa- nese soldier’s comparative fearlessness of death.*</p>
<p>Murder, like suicide, was allowed occasionally to replace the
law.</p>
<p>Feudal Japan economized on policemen not only by having many bonzes,
but by allowing the son or brother of a murdered man to take the law
into his own hand; and this recognition of the right of revenge, though
it begot half the novels and plays of Japanese literature, intercepted
many crimes. The Samurai, however, usually felt called upon to commit
hara-kiri after exercising this privilege of personal revenge. When the
famous Forty- seven Ronin (“Wave Men”— i.e., unattached Samurai), to
avenge a death, had cut off the head of Kotsuke no Suke with supreme
courtesy and the most refined apologies, they retired in dignity to
estates named by the Shogun, and neatly killed themselves (1703).
Priests returned Kotsuke’s head to his retainers, who gave them this
simple receipt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hara-kiri was forbidden to women and plebeians; but women were
allowed to com- mit jigaki — i.e., they were permitted, as a protest
against an offense, to pierce the throat with a dagger, and to sever the
arteries by a single thrust. Every woman of quality re- ceived technical
training in the art of cutting her throat, and was taught to bind her
iower limbs together before killing herself, lest her corpse should be
found in an im- modest position. 18</li>

<p>Saito Kunai</p>
<p>This is probably the most famous and typical event in the history of
Japan, and one of the most significant for the understanding of Japanese
char- acter. Its protagonists are still, in the popular view, heroes and
saints; to this day pious hands deck their graves, and incense never
ceases to rise before their resting place. 19</p>
<p>Towards the end of Iyeyasu’s regency two brothers, Sakon and Naiki,
twenty-four and seventeen years of age respectively, tried to kill him
be- cause of wrongs which they felt that he had inflicted upon their
father. They were caught as they entered the camp, and were sentenced to
death. Iyeyasu was so moved by their courage that he commuted their
sentences to self-disembowelment; and in accord with the customs of the
time he included their younger brother, the eight-year-old Hachimaro, in
this merciful decree. The physician who attended the boys has left us a
de- scription of the scene:</p>
<p>When they were all seated in a row for final despatch, Sakon turned
to the youngest and said — “Go thou first, for I wish to be sure
that</p>
<p>hou doest it right.” Upon the little one’s replying that, as he
had</p>
<p>never seen seppuku performed, he would like to see his brothers do
it, and then he could follow them, the older brothers smiled between
their tears: — “Well said, little fellow. So canst thou well boast
of</p>
<p>being our father’s child.” When they had placed him between them,
Sakon thrust the dagger into the left side of his abdomen and said —
“Look, brother! Dost understand now? Only, don’t push the</p>
<p>dagger too far, lest thou fall back. Lean forward, rather, and
keep</p>
<p>hy knees well composed.” Naiki did likewise, and said to the boy—</p>
<p>“Keep thine eyes open, or else thou mayst look like a dying
woman.</p>
<p>If thy dagger feels anything within and thy strength fails, take
cour-</p>
<p>age, and double thy effort to cut across.” The child looked from</p>
<p>one to the other, and when both had expired, he calmly half de-</p>
<p>nuded himself and followed the example set him on either hand. 30</p>
<p>850</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XH. THE LAW</p>
<p>The first code — Group responsibility — Punishments</p>
<p>The legal system of Japan was a vigorous supplement to private
assassi- nation and revenge. It had its origins partly in the ancient
usages of the people, partly in the Chinese codes of the seventh
century; law accom- panied religion in the migration of culture from
China to Japan.* 1 Tenchi Tenno began the formulation of a system of
laws which was completed and promulgated under the boy Emperor Mommu in
702. In the feudal epoch this and other codes of the imperial age fell
into disuse, and each fief legislated independently, the Samurai
recognized no law beyond the will and decrees of his Daimyo. a</p>
<p>Until 1721 it was the custom of Japan to hold the entire family
re-</p>
<p>sponsible for the good behavior of each member, and, in most
localities, to charge each family in a group of five with responsibility
for all. The grown sons of an adult who had been condemned to be
crucified or burned were executed with him, and his younger sons, on
coming of age, were banished. 23 Ordeal was used in medieval trials, and
torture re- mained popular, in its milder forms, till modem times. The
Japanese used the rack on some Christians, in vengeful imitation of the
Inquisition; but more often their subtle minds were content to bind a
man with ropes into a constrained position that became more agonizing
with every minute.” Whippings for trifling offenses were frequent, and
death could be earned by any one of a great variety of crimes. The
Emperor Shomu (724-56) abolished capital punishment and made compassion
the rule of govern- ment; but crime increased after his death, and the
Emperor Konin (770-</p>
<ol start="81" type="1">
<li>not only restored the death penalty, but decreed that thieves should
be publicly scourged until they died.® Capital punishment also took the
form of strangling, beheading, crucifixion, quartering, burning, or
boiling in oil.” Iyeyasu put an end to the old custom of pulling a
condemned man in two between oxen, or binding him to a public post and
inviting each passer-by to take a turn in cutting through him, from
shoulder to crotch, with a saw. 21 Iyeyasu laid it down that the
frequent resort to severe punishments proved not the criminality of the
people so much as the corruption and incompetence of the officials.”
Yoshimune was dis - gusted to find that the prisons of his time had no
sanitary arrangements, and that among the prisoners were several whose
trials, though begun</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 851</p>
<p>sixteen years back, were still unfinished, so that the accusations
against them were forgotten, and the witnesses were dead. 30 This most
enlightened of the shoguns reformed the prisons, improved and
accelerated judicial procedure, abolished family responsibility, and
labored sedulously for years to formulate the first unified code of
Japanese feudal law (1721).</p>

<li>THE TOILERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Castes — An experiment in the nationalization of land — State
fixing</p>
<p>of wages — A famine — Handicrafts — Artisans and guilds</p>
<p>In the imperial age society had been divided into eight sei or
castes; in the feudal epoch these were softened into four classes:
Samurai , artisans, peasants, and merchants — the last being also, in
social ranking, least. Be- neath these classes was a large body of
slaves, numbering some five per cent of the population, and composed of
criminals, war-captives, or chil- dren seized and sold by kidnappers, or
children sold into slavery by their parents.* 30 Lower even than these
slaves was a caste of pariahs known as Eta, considered despicable and
unclean by Buddhist Japan because they acted as butchers, tanners and
scavengers. 33</p>
<p>The great bulk of the population (which numbered in Yoshimune’s</p>
<p>days some thirty millions), was composed of peasant proprietors,
intensive- ly cultivating that one- eighth of Japan’s mountainous soil
which lends it - self to tillage, f In the Nara period the state
nationalized the land, and rented it to the peasant for six years or, at
most, till death; but the govern- ment discovered that men did not care
to improve or properly care for land that might in a short time be
assigned to others; and the experiment ended in a restoration of private
ownership, with state provision of funds in the spring to finance the
planting and reaping of the crops. 33 Despite this aid, the life of the
peasant was not one of degenerative ease. His farm was a tiny tract, for
even in feudal days one square mile had to support two thousand men. 3 *
He had to contribute annually to the state thirty days of forced labor,
during which death by a spear-thrust might be the penalty of a moment’s
idleness. The government took from him, in</p>

<p>$ During the months of July and August a siesta was permitted from
noon till four o’clock. Sick workers were fed by the state, and free
coffins were provid ed for those who died during the corvee</p>

<p>Xaxes and levies of many kinds, 6% of his product in the seventh
century, 72% in the twelfth, and 40% in the nineteenth. 87 His tools
were of the simplest sort; his clothing was poor and slight in the
winter, and usually nothing at all in the summer; his furniture was a
rice-pot, a few bowls, and some chopsticks; his home was a hut so flimsy
that half a week sufficed to build it. 88 Every now and then earthquakes
leveled his cottage, or famine emptied his frame. If he worked for
another man his wages, like all wages in Tokugawa Japan, were fixed by
the government; 89 but this did not pre- vent them from being cruelly
low. In one of the most famous works of Japanese literature — Kamo
Chomei’s Hojoki — the author describes, as crowded into the eight years
between 1177 and 1185, an earthquake, a famine, and a fire that almost
destroyed Kyoto.* His eyewitness account of the famine of 1 181 is one
of the classic examples of Japanese prose:</p>
<p>In all the provinces people left their lands and sought other
parts,</p>
<p>or, forgetting their homes, went to live among the hills. All kinds
of</p>
<p>prayers were begun, and even religious practices which were un-</p>
<p>usual in ordinary times were revived, but to no purpose whatever.</p>
<p>… The inhabitants of the capital offered to sacrifice their valuables
of all kinds, one after another (for food), but nobody cared to look</p>
<p>at them…. Beggars swarmed by the roadsides, and our ears were</p>
<p>filled with the sound of their lamentations…. Everybody was</p>
<p>dying of hunger; and as time went on our condition became as des-</p>
<p>perate as that of the fish in the small pool of the story. At last
even</p>
<p>respectable-looking people wearing hats, and with their feet covered,
might be seen begging importunately from door to door. Some-</p>
<p>imes, while you wondered how such utterly wretched creatures</p>
<p>could walk at all, they fell down before your eyes. By garden
walls</p>
<p>or on the roadsides countless persons died of famine, and as
their</p>
<p>bodies were not removed, the world was filled with evil odors. As</p>
<p>heir bodies changed there were many sights which the eyes could</p>
<p>not endure to see…. People who had no means pulled down their</p>
<p>houses and sold the materials in the market. It was said that a
load</p>
<p>for one man was not enough to provide him with sustenance for a</p>
<p>single day. It was strange to see, among this firewood, pieces</p>
<p>adorned in places with vermilion, or silver, or gold leaf….
Another</p>
<p>very pitiable thing was that when there were a man and a woman</p>
<p>•The worst of the many fires in Japanese history was that which
completely wiped</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS</p>
<p>who were strongly attached to each other, the one whose love was</p>
<p>he greater, and whose devotion was the more profound, always died
first. The reason was that they put themselves last, and, whether</p>
<p>man or woman, gave up to the dearly beloved one anything which</p>
<p>hey might chance to have begged. As a matter of course, parents</p>
<p>died before their children. Again, infants might be seen clinging
to</p>
<p>he breast of their mother, not knowing that she was already dead.</p>
<p>… The number of those who died in central Kyoto during the</p>
<p>fourth and fifth months alone was 42,300“</p>

Kaempfer’s bright picture of Japanese handicrafts as he saw them in the
Kyoto of 1691:</p>
<p>Kyoto is the great magazine of all Japanese manufactures and</p>
<p>commodities, and the chief mercantile town in the Empire. There is
scarce a house in this large capital where there is not something</p>
<p>made or sold. Here they refine copper, coin money, print books,</p>

<p>All the arts and industries of China had long since been imported
into Japan; and as today Japan begins to excel her Western instructors
in economy and efficiency of mechanical production , 42 so during the
Toku- gawa Shogunate her handicraftsmen began to rival, and sometimes to
excel, the Chinese and Koreans from whom they had learned their art.

<p>Xson, and often took the name of their craft; and, again as in our
Middle Ages, great guilds were formed, not so much of simple workers as
of masters who mercilessly exploited the artisans, and zealously
restricted the admission of new members to the guilds.“ One of the most
powerful of the guilds was that of the money-changers, who accepted
deposits, issued vouchers and promissory notes, made loans to commerce,
industry and government, and (by 1636) performed all the major functions
of finance.“ Rich merchants and financiers rose to prominence in the
cities, and began to look with jealous eye upon the exclusive political
power of a feudal aris- tocracy that angered them by scorning the
pursuit of gold. Slowly,</p>
<p>hroughout the Tokugawa era, the mercantile wealth of the nation grew,
until at last it was ready to cooperate with American gifts and European
guns in bursting the shell of the old Japan.</p>

<p>This most important people in the contemporary political world is</p>
<p>modest in stature, averaging five feet three-and-a-half inches for
the men, four feet ten-and-a-half inches for the women. One of their
great warriors, Tamura Maro, was d escribed as “a man of very fine
figure,… five feet</p>
<p>Cosmetics are popular and ancient in Japan as elsewhere; even in the
arly days of Kyoto’s leadership every male of quality rouged his cheeks,
powdered his face, sprinkled his clothes with perfume, and carried a
mirror with him wherever he went. 47 Powder has been for centuries the
female complexion of Japan; the Lady Sei Shonagon, in her Pillow
Sketches (ca. 991 a.d.), says demurely: “I bent my head down and hid my
face with my sleeve at the risk of brushing off my powder and appearing
with</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX ) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 855</p>
<p>a spotted face.”“ 8 Fashi onable ladies rouged their cheeks, colored
their nails, and occasionally gilded the lower lip; to complete their
toilette six- teen articles were required in the seventeenth century,
and twenty in the eighteenth. They recognized fifteen styles of front
hair and twelve styles of back hair; they shaved their eyebrows, painted
“crescent moons” or other forms in their place, or substituted for them
two little black spots high up on the forehead, to match their
artificially blackened teeth. To construct he architecture of a woman’s
hair was a task that took from two to six hours of expert labor. In the
Heian epoch the majority of the men shaved the crown of the head,
gathered the rest in a queue, and laid the queue athwart the crown so as
to divide it into equal halves. Beards, though sparse, were a necessity;
those who had none by nature wore false ones, and a pair of tweezers for
the care of the beard was furnished to every guest at any fashionable
house. 49</p>
<p>Japanese costume, in the Nara age, imitated the Chinese, with tunic
and trousers covered by a tight robe. In the Kyoto period the robe
became looser and multiple; men as well as women wore from two to twenty
superimposed robes, whose colors were determined by the rank of the
wearer, and provided many prismatic displays at the edges of the
sleeves. At one time the lady’s sleeves reached below her knees, and
bore, each of them, a little bell that tinkled as she walked. On days
when the streets were wet from rain or snow they walked on wooden
slippers raised by wooden cleats an inch or so above the earth. In the
Tokugawa era dress became so extravagant that the shoguns , careless of
history, tried to check it by sumptuary laws; silk-lined and em-
broidered breeches and socks were outlawed, beards were forbidden,
certain ways of wearing the hair were proscribed, and at times the
police were in- structed to arrest anyone wearing fine garments in the
street. Occasionally these laws were obeyed; for the most part they were
circumvented by the in- genuity of human folly. 60 In time the rage for
plural robes abated, and the Japanese became one of the most simply,
modestly and tastefully dressed of</p>
<p>Nor did they yield to any other nation in habits of cleanliness.
Among those who could afford it clothes were changed three times a day;
and poor as well as rich bathed the body daily. 61 * In the villages the
people bathed in rubs outside their doors in summer, while gossiping
industriously with their neighbors. 62 Hot baths at no degrees
Fahrenheit were used as a method of keeping warm in winter. Diet was
simple and wholesome until luxury came;</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1905 Tokyo had 1100 public baths, in which 500,000 persons bathed
daily for 1 % cents. 68</li>

<p>856 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xhe early Chinese descriptions of the Japanese noted that “they are a
long - lived race, and persons who have reached one hundred years are
very com- mon.” 84 The staple food of the people was rice, to which were
added fish, vegetables, sea-weed, fruit and meat according to income.
Meat was a rare dish except among the aristocracy and the soldiery. On a
regimen of rice, a little fish and no meat, the coolie developed good
lungs and tough muscles, and could run from fifty to eighty miles in
twenty-four hours without dis- tress; when he added meat he lost this
capacity. 55 * The emperors of the Kyoto period made pious efforts to
enforce Buddhist dietary laws by forbid- ding the slaughter or eating of
animals; but when the people found that the priests themselves
clandestinely violated these laws, they took to meat as a delicacy, and
used it to excess whenever their means permitted. 87</p>
<p>To the Japanese, as to the Chinese and the French, fine cooking was
an essential grace of civilization. Its practitioners, like artists and
philosophers, divided into warring schools, and fought one another with
recipes. Table manners became at least as important as religion;
elaborate enactments pre- scribed the order and quantity of bites, and
the posture of the body at each stage of the meal. Ladies were forbidden
to make a sound while eating or drinking; but men were expected to
indicate their appreciation of a host’s generosity by a little grateful
belching. 58 The diners sat on one or two heels on mats, at a table
raised but a few inches above the floor; or the food might be laid upon
the mat, without any table at all. Usually the meal was begun with a hot
drink of rice-wine; for had not the poet Tahito declared, far back in
the seventh century, that sake was the one solution for all the problems
of life?</p>
<p>That which the seven sages sought,</p>
<p>Those men of olden times,</p>
<p>Was sake y beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>Instead of holding forth</p>
<p>Wisely, with grave mien,</p>

life while con- tinuing to eat large quantities of rice are succumbing
to digestive disorders. 6 ®</li>

<p>Even the jewel that sparkles in the night</p>
<p>Is less to us than the uplifting of the heart</p>
<p>Which comes by drinking sake.™</p>
<p>More sacred than sake, to the aristocracy, was tea. This gracious
remedy for the tastelessness of boiled water was introduced from China
into Japan, unsuccessfully in 805, successfully in 1191. At first the
people shunned the leaf as a poison, and would have nothing to do with
it; but when a few cups of the outlandish beverage quickly cleared the
head of a shogun who had drunk too much sake the night before, the
Japanese recognized the utility of tea. Its costliness added to its
charm: tiny jars of it were given as precious gifts, even to reward
warriors for mighty deeds of valor, and the fortunate possessors
gathered their friends about them to share the royal drink. The Japanese
made a graceful and complex ceremony out of tea- drinking, and Rikyu
-established for it six inviolable rules that raised it to a cult. The
signal bidding the guests to enter the tea pavilion, said Rikyu, must be
given by wooden clappers; the ablution bowl must be kept con- stantly
filled with pure water; any guest conscious of inadequacy or inele-
gance in the furniture or the surroundings must leave at once, and as
quietly as possible; no trivial gossip was to be indulged in, but only
matters of noble and serious import were to be discussed; no word of
deceit or flattery should pass any lip; and the affair should not last
beyond four hours. No tea-pot was used at such Cha-no- yu (“hot water
for tea”)</p>
<p>reunions; powdered tea was placed in a cup of choice design, hot
water was added, and the cup was passed from guest to guest, each wiping
its rim carefully with a napkin. When the last drinker had consumed the
last drop the cup was passed around again, to be critically examined as
a work of ceramic art. 80 In this way the tea-ceremony stimulated the
potters to produce ever lovelier cups and bowls, and helped to form the
manners of the Japanese into tranquillity, courtesy and charm.*</p>
<p>Flowers, too, became a cult in Japan, and the same Rikyu who formu-
lated the ritual of tea valued his flowers as much as his cups. When he
heard that Hideyoshi was coming to see his famous collection of chrysan-
themums, Rikyu destroyed all the blossoms in his garden but one, so
that</p>
<ul>
<li>The tea-crop, of course, is now one of the important products of
Japan. The Dutch East India Co. appears to have brought Europe its first
tea in 1610, and to have sold it at some.00 a pound. Jonas Hanway, in
1756, argued that European men were losing their stature, and women
their beauty, through the drinking of tea; and reformers de- nounced the
custom as a filthy barbarism. 61</li>
</ul>
<p>858 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xhis might shine unrivaled before the terrible shogun *“ 2 The art of
flower- arrangement grew step by step with “Teaism” in the fifteenth and
six - teenth centuries, and became in the seventeenth an independent
devotion. “Flower - masters” arose who taught men and women how flowers
should be grown in the garden and placed in the home; it was not enough,
they said, to admire the blossoms, but one must learn to see as much
loveliness in the leaf, the bough or the stalk as in the flower, as much
beauty in one flower as in a thousand; and one must arrange them with a
view not merely to color but to grouping and line.“ Tea, flowers,
poetry, and the dance became requisites of womanhood among the
aristocracy of Japan.</p>
<p>Flowers are the religion of the Japanese; they worship them with
sacri- ficial fervor and national accord. They watch for the blossoms
appropri- ate to each season; and when, for a week or two in early
April, the cherry- tree blooms, all Japan seems to leave its work to
gaze at it, or even to make pilgrimages to places where the miracle is
most abundant and complete, t The cherry-tree is cultivated not for any
fruit but for its blossom — the emblem of the faithful warrior ready to
die for his country at the moment of his fullest life. 05 Criminals en
route to execution will sometimes ask for a flower. 00 The Lady Chiyo,
in a famous poem, tells of a girl who came to draw water from a well,
but, finding bucket and rope entwined with con- volvuli, went elsewhere
for water rather than break the tendrils.“ “The heart of man,” says
Tsurayuki, “can never be understood; but in my native village the
flowers give forth their perfume as before.” 08 These simple lines are
among the greatest of Japanese poems, for they express in perfect and
irreducible form a profound characteristic of a race, and one of the
rare conclusions of philosophy. Never has another people shown such love
of nature as one finds in Japan; nowhere else have men and women
accepted so completely all natural moods of earth, sky and sea; nowhere
else have men so carefully cultivated gardens, or nourished plants in
their growth, or tended them in the home. Japan did not have to wait for
a Rousseau or a Wordsworth to tell it that mountains were sublime, or
that lakes might be beautiful. There is hardly a dwelling in Japan
without a vase of flowers in it, and hardly a poem in Japanese
literature without a landscape in its lines. As Oscar Wilde thought that
England should</p>
<p>The Taiko and the Tea-Master loved each other like geniuses. The
first accused the other of dishonesty, and was accused in turn of
seducing Rikyu’s daughter. In the end Rikyu committed hara- kiri ’ “</p>

fall.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 859</p>
<p>not fight France because the French wrote perfect prose, so America
might seek peace to the end with a nation that thirsts for beauty almost
as pas- sionately as it hungers for power.</p>
<p>The art of gardening was imported from China along with Buddhism and
tea; but here again the Japanese transformed creatively what they had
absorbed through imitation. They found an esthetic value in asymmetry, a
new charm in the surprises of unhackneyed forms; they dwarfed trees and
shrubs by confining their roots in pots, and with impish humor and
tyrannical affection trained them into shapes that might within a garden
wall represent the wind-twisted trees of stormy Japan; they searched the
craters of their volcanoes and the most precipitous shores of their seas
to find rocks fused into metal by hidden fires, or moulded by patient
breakers into quaint and gnarled forms; they dug little lakes, channeled
roving rivulets, and crossed them with bridges that seemed to spring
from the natural growth of the woods; and through all these varied
formations they wore, with imperceptible design, footpaths that would
lead now to star- tling novelties and now to cool and silent
retreats.</p>
<p>Where space and means allowed they attached their homes to their
gardens rather than their gardens to their homes. Their houses were
frail but pretty; earthquakes made tall buildings dangerous, but the
carpenter and woodworker knew how to bind eaves, gables and lattices
into a dwell- ing ascetically simple, esthetically perfect, and
architecturally unique. Here were no curtains, sofas, beds, tables or
chairs, no obtrusive display of the dweller’s wealth and luxury, no
museum of pictures, statuary or bric -a- brac; but in some alcove a
blossoming branch, on the wall a silk or paper painting or specimen of
calligraphy, on the matted floor a cushion fronted by a lectern and
flanked by a bookcase on one side and an arm-rest on the other, and,
hidden in a cupboard, mattresses and coverings to be spread on the floor
when the time should come to sleep. Within such modest quarters, or in
the peasant’s fragile hut, the Japanese family lived, and through all
storms of war and revolution, of political corruption and religious
strife, carried on the life and civilization of the Sacred Isles.</p>

<p>The paternal autocrat — The status of woman — Children — Sexual</p>

<p>For the real source of social order, in the Orient even more than in
the West, was the family; and the omnipotence of the father, in Japan as
throughout the East, expressed not a backward condition of society but a
preference for familial rather than political government. The individual
was less important in the East than in the Occident because the state
was weaker, and required a strongly organized and disciplined family to
take the place of a far-reaching and pervasive central authority.
Freedom was conceived in terms of the family rather than of the
individual; for (the family being the economic unit of production as
well as the social unit of order) success or failure, survival or death,
came not to the separate per- son but to the family. The power of the
father was tyrannical, but it</p>
<p>had the painless grace of seeming natural, necessary, and human. He
could dismiss a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law from the patriarchal
household, while keeping the grandchildren with him; he could kill a
child convicted of unchastity or a serious crime; he could sell his
children into slavery or prostitution;* and he could divorce his wife
with a word.™ If he was a simple commoner he was expected to be
monogamous; but if he belonged to the higher classes he was entitled to
keep concubines, and no notice was to be taken of his occasional
infidelities.’ 1 When Christianity entered</p>
<p>As in China, the position of woman was higher in the earlier than in
the later stages of the civilization. Six empresses appear among the
rulers of the imperial age; and at Kyoto women played an important,
indeed a lead- ing, role in the social and literary life of the nation.
In that heyday of Japanese culture, if we may hazard hypotheses in such
esoteric fields, the wives outstripped their husbands in adultery, and
sold their virtue for an epigram.” The Lady Sei Shonagon describes a
youth about to send a love - note to his mistress, but interrupting it
to make love to a passing girl; and this amiable essayist adds: “I
wonder if, when this lover sent his letter, tied with a dewy spray of
hagi flower, his messenger hesitated to present it to the lady because
she also had a guest?”’* Under the influence of feudal militarism, and

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xlapse was not synonymous with ruin. The most famous of Japanese
novels, the Genji Monogatari, is an epic of aristocratic seduction; and
the most famous of Japanese essays, the Pillow Sketches of the Lady Sei
Shonagon, reads in places like a treatise on the etiquette of sin. 88
The desires of the flesh were looked upon as natural, like hunger and
thirst, and thousands of men, many of them respectable husbands,
crowded, at night, the Yoshi- wara, or “Flower District,” of Tok yo.
There, in the most orderly dis-</p>
<p>orderly houses in the world, fifteen thousand trained and licensed
cour- tesans sat of an evening behind their lattices, gorgeously attired
and powder-white, ready to provide song, dance and venery for unmated or
ill-mated men. 88</p>
<p>The best educated of the courtesans were the geisha girls, whose very
name indicated that they were persons (sha) capable of an artistic per-
formance (gei). Like the hetairai of Greece they affected literature as
well as love, and seasoned their promiscuity with poetry. The Shogun
Iyenari (1787-1836), who had already (1791) forbidden mixed bathing as
occasionally encouraging immorality, 84 issued a rigorous edict against
the geisha in 1822, describing her as “a female singer who, ma
gnificently appareled, hires herself out to amuse guests at restaurants,
ostensibly by dancing and singing, but really by practices of a very
different char-</p>
<p>acter.” 88 These women were henceforth to be classed as prostitutes,
along with those “numberless wenches” who, in Kaempfer’s day, filled
every tea-shop in the village and every inn on the road. 88
Nevertheless, parties and families continued to invite the geisha to
provide entertainment at social affairs; finishing schools were
established where older geisha trained young apprentices in their varied
arts; and periodically, at the Kaburenjo, teachers and pupils served
ceremonial tea, and gave a public performance of their more presentable
accomplishments. Parents hard put to support their dau ghters sometimes,
with their manipulated “consent,” apprenticed</p>
<p>These customs, however startling, do not differ essentially from the
habits and institutions of the Occident, except perhaps in candor,
refine- ment and grace. The vast majority of Japanese girls, we are
assured, re- mained as chaste as the virgins of the West. 88 Despite
such frank arrange- ments the Japanese managed to live lives of
comparative order and</p>

<p>decency, and though they did not often allow love to determine
marriage for life, they were capable of the tenderest affection for the
objects of their desire. Instances are frequent, in the current history
as well as in the imaginative literature of Japan, where young men and
women have killed themselves in the hope of enjoying in eternity the
unity forbidden them by their parents on earth.” Love is not the major
theme of Japanese</p>
<p>poetry, but here and there its note is struck with unmatched
simplicity, sincerity and depth.</p>

<p>On the Sea of Ise</p>
<p>Were but flowers.</p>
<p>That I might gather them</p>
<p>And bring them as a gift to my love.“</p>
<p>And, again with characteristic mingling of nature and feeling, the
great Tsurayuki tells in four lines the story of his rejected love:</p>
<p>Naught is so fleeting as the cherry-flower,</p>
<p>You say… yet I remember well the hour</p>

<p>Religion in Japan — The transformation of Buddhism — The</p>

<p>That same devotion which speaks in patriotism and love, in affection
for parents, children, mate and fatherland, inevitably sought in the
uni- verse as a whole some central power to which it might attach itself
in loyalty, and through which it might derive some value and
significance larger than one person, and more lasting than one life. The
Japanese are only a moderately religious people — not profoundly and
overwhelmingly religious like the Hindus, nor passionately and
fanatically religious like the tortured saints of medieval Catholicism
or the warring saints of the Reformation; and yet they are distinctly
more given to piety and prayer, and a happy-ending philosophy, than
their sceptical cousins across the Yellow Sea.</p>
<p>864 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>XBuddhism came from its founder a cloud of pessimistic exhortation,
inviting men to death; but under the skies of Japan it was soon trans-
formed into a cult of protecting deities, pleasant ceremonies, joyful
festivals, Rousseauian pilgrimages, and a consoling paradise. It is true
that there were hells too in Japanese Buddhism — indeed, one hundred and
twenty-eight of them, designed for every purpose and enemy. There was a
world of demons as well as of saints, and a personal Devil ( Oni ) with
horns, flat nose, claws and fangs; he lived in some dark, northeastern
realm, to which he would, now and then, lure women to give him pleasure,
or men to provide him with proteins. 92 But on the other hand there were
Bodhisattwas ready to transfer to human beings a portion of the grace
they had accumulated by many incarnations of virtuous living; and there
were gracious deities, like Our Lady Kwannon and the Christlike Jizo,
who were the very essence of divine tenderness. Worship was only partly
by prayer at the household altars and the temple shrines; a large part
of it consisted of merry processions in which religion was subordinated
to gayety, and piety took the form of feminine fashion-displays and
mascu- line revelry. The more serious devotee might cleanse his spirit
by praying for a quarter of an hour under a waterfall in the depth of
winter; or he might go on pilgrimages from shrine to shrine of his sect,
meanwhile feast- ing his soul on the beauty of his native land. For the
Japanese could</p>
<p>choose among many varieties of Buddhism: he might seek
self-realization and bliss through the quiet practices of Zen
(“meditation”); he might follow the fiery Nichiren into the Lotus Sect,
and find salvation through learning the “Lotus Law”; he might join the
Spirit Sect, a nd fast and</p>
<p>pray until Buddha appeared to him in the flesh; he might be comforted
by the Sect of the Pure Land, and be saved by faith alone; or he might
find his way in patient pilgrimage to the monastery of Koyasan, and
attain paradise by being buried in ground made holy by the bones of Kobo
Daishi, the great scholar, saint and artist who, in the ninth century,
had founded Shingon, the Sect of the True Word.</p>
<p>All in all, Japanese Buddhism was one of the pleasantest of man’s
myths. It conquered Japan peacefully, and complaisantly found room,
within its theology and its pantheon, for the doctrines and deities of
Shinto: Buddha was amalgamated with Amaterasu, and a modest place was
set apart, in Buddhist temples, for a Shinto shrine. The Buddhist
priests of the earlier centuries were men of devotion, learning and
kindliness, who pro- foundly influenced and advanced Japanese letters
and arts; some of them</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 86 f</p>
<p>were great painters or sculptors, and some were scholars whose
painstak- ing translation of Buddhist and Chinese literature proved a
fertile stimulus to the cultural development of Japan. Success, however,
ruined the later priests; many became lazy and greedy (note the jolly
caricatures so often made of them by Japanese carvers in ivory or wood)
; and some traveled so far from Buddha as to organize their own armies
for the establishment or maintenance of political power.” Since they
were providing the first necessity of life — a consolatory hope — their
industry flourished even when others decayed; their wealth grew from
century to century, while the poverty of the people remained.” The
priests assured the faithful that a man of forty could purchase another
decade of life by paying forty temples to say masses in his name; at
fifty he could buy ten years more by engaging fifty temples; at sixty
years sixty temples — and so till, through insufficient piety, he
died.*” Under the Tokugawa regime the monks drank bibu - lously, kept
mistresses candidly, practised pederasty, f and sold the cozier places
in the hierarchy to the highest bidders.”</p>
<p>During the eighteenth century Buddhism seems to have lost its hold
upon the nation; the shoguns went over to Confucianism, Mabuchi and
Moto-ori led a movement for the restoration of Shinto, and scholars like
Ichikawa and Arai Hakuseki attempted a rationalist critique of religious
belief. Ichikawa argued boldly that verbal tradition could never be
quite as trustworthy as written record; that writing had not come to
Japan until almost a thousand years after the supposed origin of the
islands and their inhabitants from the spear-drops and loins of the
gods; that the claim of the imperial family to divine origin was merely
a political device; and that if the ancestors of men were not human
beings they were much more likely to have been animals than gods.” The
civilization of the old Japan, like so many others, had begun with
religion and was ending with phi- losophy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“It was mainly in seasons when people were starving,” says
Murdoch, “or dying in tens of thousands from pestilence, that the monks
in the great Kyoto and Nara monas- teries fared most sumptuously; for it
was in times like these that believers were most lavish in their gifts
and benefactions.” 06</p></li>
<li><p>“In 1454… boys were often sold to the priests, who shaved their
eyebrows, powdered their faces, dressed them in female garb, and put
them to the vilest of uses; for since the days of Yoshimitsu, who had
set an evil example in this as in so many other matters, the practice of
pederasty had become very common, especially in the monasteries,
although it was by no means confined to them.” 07</p></li>

<p>Philosophy, like religion, came to Japan from China. And as Buddhism
had reached Nippon six hundred years after its entrance into the Middle
Flowery People’s Kingdom, so philosophy, in the form of Sung Con -</p>
<p>fucianism, awoke to consciousness in Japan almost four hundred years
after China had given it a second birth. About the middle of the
sixteenth century a scion of Japan’s most famous family, Fujiwara
Seigwa, discon - tent with the knowledge that he had received as a monk,
and having heard of great sages in China, resolved to go and study
there. Intercourse with China having been forbidden in 1552, the young
priest made plans to cross the water in a smuggling vessel. While
waiting in an inn at the port he overheard a student reading aloud, in
Japanese, from a Chinese volume on Confucius. Seigwa was overjoyed to
find that the book was Chu Hsi’s commentary on “The Great Learning.”
“This,” he exclaimed, “is what I have so long desired.” By sedulous
searching he obtained a copy of this and other products of Sung
philosophy, and became so absorbed in their discussions that he forgot
to go to China. Within a few years he had gath- ered about him a group
of young scholars, who looked upon the Chinese philosophers as the
revelation of a brave new world of secular thought. Iyeyasu heard of
these developments, and asked Seigwa to come and ex- pound to him the
Confucian classics; but the proud priest, preferring the quiet of his
study, sent a brilliant pupil in his place. Nevertheless the more
active-minded youths of his time made a pathway to his door, and his
lec- tures attracted so much attention that the Buddhist monks of Kyoto
com- plained, saying it was an outrage that anyone but an orthodox and
practis- ing priest should deliver public lectures or teach the people.”
0 The matter was simplified by Seigwa’s sudden death (1619).</p>
<p>The pupil whom he had sent to Iyeyasu soon outranked him in fame and
influence. The first Tokugawa shoguns took a fancy to Hayashi Razan, and
made him their counsellor and the formulator of their public pro-
nouncements. Iyemitsu set a fashion for the nobility by attending</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 867</p>
<p>Hayashi’s lectures in 1630; and soon the young Confucian had so
filled his hearers with enthusiasm for Chinese philosophy that he had no
trouble in winning them from both Buddhism and Christianity to the
simple moral creed bequeathed to the Far East by the sage of Shantung.
Christian theol- ogy, he told them, was a medley of incredible fancies,
while Buddhism was a degenerative doctrine that threatened to weaken the
fibre and morale of the Japanese nation. “You priests,” said Razan,
“maintain that this world is impermanent and ephemeral. By your
enchantments you cause people to forget the social relations; you make
an end of all the duties and all the proprieties. Then you proclaim:
‘Man’s path is full of sins; leave your father and mother, leave your
master, leave your children, and seek for salvation.’ Now I tell you
that I have studied much; but I have nowhere fo und that there was a
path for a man apart from loyalty to one’s lord, and of filial piety
towards one’s parents.” 101 Hayashi was enjoying an old age of quiet
renown when the great fire of Tokyo, in 1657, included him among its
hundred thousand casualties. His disciples ran to warn him of the
danger, but he merely nodded his head, and turned back to his book. When
the flames were actually around him he ordered a palanquin, and was
carried away in it while still reading his book. Like countless others,
he passed that night under the stars; and three days later he died of
the cold that he had caught during the conflagration.</p>
<p>Nature sought to atone for his death by giving Japan, in the
following year, one of the most enthusiastic of Confucians. Muro Kyuso
chose as his patron deity the God of Learning. Before Michizane’s shrine
he spent, in his youth, an entire night in prayer; and then he dedicated
himself to knowledge with youthful resolutions strangely akin to those
of his con- temporary, Spinoza.*</p>
<p>I will arise every morning at six o’clock and retire each evening

<p>he desire for fame or gain.</p>
<p>Engraving these rules on my heart I will attempt to follow them.</p>
<p>The gods be my witness. 103</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kyuso did not preach a scholastic seclusion, but with
the broad-mindedness of a Goethe directed character into the stream of
the world:</p>
<p>Seclusion is one method, and is good; but a superior man rejoices</p>
<p>when his friends come. A man polishes himself by association with</p>
<p>others. Every man who desires learning should seek to be polished</p>
<p>in this way. But if he shuts himself away from everything and</p>
<p>everybody, he is guilty of violating the great way…. The Way of</p>
<p>he Sages is not sundered from matters of everyday life…. Though the
Buddhists withdraw themselves from human relations, cutting</p>
<p>out the relation of master and subject, parent and child, they
are</p>
<p>not able to cut out love from themselves…. It is selfishness to
seek</p>
<p>happiness in the future world…. Think not that God is something</p>
<p>distant, but seek for him in your own hearts; for the heart is
the</p>
<p>abode of God. 103</p>
<p>The most attractive of these early Japanese Confucians is not usually
classed among the philosophers, for like Goethe and Emerson he had the
skill to phrase his wisdom gracefully, and jealous literature claims him
for her own. Like Aristotle Kaibara Ekken was the son of a physician,
and</p>
<p>passed from medicine to a cautious empirical philosophy. Despite a
busy public career, including many official posts, he found time to
become the greatest scholar of his day. His books numbered more than a
hundred, and made him known throughout Japan; for they were written not
in Chi- nese (then the language of his fellow philosophers) but in such
simple Japanese that any literate person might understand them. Despite
his learn- ing and renown he had, along with the vanity of every writer,
the humility of every sage. Once, says tradition, a passenger on a
vessel plying along the Japanese coast undertook to lecture to his
fellow travelers on the ethics of Confucius. At first every one attended
with typical Japanese curiosity and eagerness to learn; but as the
speaker went on his audience, finding him a bore who had no nose for
distinguishing a live fact from a dead one,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX ) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 869</p>
<p>melted swiftly away, until only one listener remained. This solitary
audi- tor, however, followed the discourse with such devout
concentration that the lecturer, having finished, inquired his name.
“Kaibara Ekken,” was the quiet reply. The orator was abashed to discover
that for an hour or more he had been attempting to instruct in
Confucianism the most celebrated Confucian master of the age. 10 *</p>
<p>Ekken’s philosophy was as free from theology as K’ung’s, and
clung</p>
<p>agnostically to the earth. “Foolish men, while doing crooked things,
offer their prayers to q uestionable gods, striving to obtain
happiness.” 106 With him philosophy was an effort to unify experience
into wisdom, and desire into character; and it seemed to him more
pressing and important to unify character than to unify knowledge. He
speaks with strangely contempo- rary pertinence:</p>
<p>The aim of learning is not merely to widen knowledge but to</p>
<p>form character. Its object is to make us true men, rather than
learned men…. The moral teaching which was regarded as the trunk of</p>
<p>all learning in the schools of the olden days is hardly studied in
our</p>
<p>schools today, because of the numerous branches of study
required.</p>
<p>No longer do men deem it worth while to listen to the teachings
of</p>
<p>he hoary sages of the past. Consequently the amiable relations be-
tween master and servant, superior and inferior, older and younger are
sacrificed on the altar of the god called “Individual Right.”…</p>
<p>The chief reason why the teachings of the sages are not more appre-
ciated by the people is because scholars endeavor to show off their</p>
<p>learning, rather than to make it their endeavor to live up to the</p>
<p>eachings of the sages. 109</p>
<p>The young men of his time seem to have reproved him for his conserva-
tism, for he flings at them a lesson which every vigorous generation has
to relearn.</p>
<p>Children, you may think an old man’s words wearisome; yet,</p>
<p>when your father or grandfather teaches, do not turn your head</p>
<p>away, but listen. Though you may think the tradition of your</p>
<p>family stupid, do not break it into pieces, for it is the
embodiment</p>
<p>of the wisdom of your fathers. 107</p>
<p>Perhaps he deserved reproof, for the most famous of his books, the
Onna Daikaku, or “The Great Learning for Women,” had a strong
reactionary</p>
<p>8yO THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xinfluence on the position of women in Japan. But he was no gloomy
preacher intent on finding sin in every delight; he knew that one task
of the educator is to teach us how to enjoy our environment, as well as
(if we can) to understand and control it.</p>
<p>Do not let a day slip by without enjoyment…. Do not allow</p>
<p>yourself to be tormented by the stupidity of others…. Remember</p>
<p>hat from its earliest beginnings the world has never been free from
fools…. Let us not then distress ourselves, nor lose our pleasure,</p>
<p>even though our own children, brothers and relations, happen to be
selfish, ignoring our best efforts to make them otherwise…. Sake is the
beautiful gift of Heaven. Drunk in small quantities it expands</p>
<p>he heart, lifts the downcast spirit, drowns cares, and improves
the</p>
<p>health. Thus it helps a man and also his friends to enjoy
pleasures.</p>
<p>But he who drinks too much loses his respectability, becomes
over-</p>
<p>alkative, and utters abusive words like a madman…. Enjoy sake by
drinking just enough to give you a slight exhilaration, and thus enjoy
seeing flowers when they are just bursting into bloom. To drink too</p>
<p>much and spoil this great gift of Heaven is foolish. 108</p>
<p>Like most philosophers, he found the last refuge of his happiness in
nature.</p>
<p>If we make our heart the fountain-head of pleasure, our eyes and</p>
<p>ears the gates of pleasure, and keep away base desires, then our</p>
<p>pleasure shall be plentiful; for we can then become the master of</p>
<p>mountains, water, moon and flowers. We do not need to ask any</p>
<p>man for them, neither, to obtain them, need we pay a single sen;</p>
<p>hey have no specified owner. Those who can enjoy the beauty in</p>
<p>he Heaven above and the Earth beneath need not envy the luxury</p>
<p>of the rich, for they are richer than the richest…. The scenery
is</p>
<p>constantly changing. No two mornings or two evenings are quite</p>
<p>alike…. At this moment one feels as if all the beauty of the
world</p>
<p>had gone. But then the snow begins to fall, and one awakens the</p>
<p>next morning to find the village and the mountains transformed into
silver, while the once bare trees seem alive with flowers…. Winter
resembles the night’s sleep, which restores our strength and
energy….</p>
<p>Loving flowers, I rise early;</p>
<p>Loving the moon, I retire late….</p>
<p>Men come and go like passing streams;</p>
<p>But the moon remains throughout the ages. 109</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 87 1</p>
<p>In Japan, even more than in China, the influence of Confucius on
philo- sophic thought overwhelmed all the resistance of unplaced rebels
on the one hand, and mystic idealists on the other. The Shushi school of
Seigwa, Razan and Ekken took its name from Chu Hsi, and followed his
orthodox and conservative interpretation of the Chinese classics. For a
time it was opposed by the Oyomei school, which took its lead from Wang
Yang- ming, # known to Nippon as Oyomei. Like Wang, the Japanese
philosophers of Oyomei sought to deduce right and wrong from the
conscience of the individual rather than from the traditions of society
and the teachings of the ancient sages. “I had for many years been a
devout believer in Shushi says Nakaye Toju (1608- 48), “when, by the
mercy of Heaven, the col - lected works of Oyomei were brought for the
first time to Japan. Had it not been for the aid of their teaching, my
life would have been empty and barren.’” 0 So Nakaye devoted himself to
expounding an idealist monism, in which the world was a unity of ki and
n — of things (or “modes”) and reason or law. God and this unity were
one; the world of things was his body, the universal law was his soul.”
Like Spinoza, Wang Yang -ming and the Scholastics of Europe, Nakaye
accepted this universal law with a kind of amor dei intellectual is, and
accounted good and evil as human terms and prejudices describing no
objective entities; and, again strangely like Spinoza, he found a
certain immortality in the contemplative union of the individual spirit
with the timeless laws or reason of the world.</p>
<p>Man’s mind is the mind of the sensible world, but we have another</p>
<p>mind which is called conscience. This is reason itself, and does
not</p>
<p>belong to form (or “mode”). It is infinite and eternal. As our con
-</p>
<p>science is one with (the divine or universal) reason, it has no
begin-</p>
<p>ning or end. If we act in accord with (such) reason or
conscience,</p>
<p>we are ourselves the incarnations of the infinite and eternal, and
have eternal life.”</p>
<p>Nakaye was a man of saintly sincerity, but his philosophy pleased
neither the people nor the government. The Shogunate trembled at the
notion that every man might judge for himself what was right and what
was wrong. When another exponent of Oyomei , Kumazawa Banzan, passed
from metaphysics to politics, and criticized the ignorance and idleness
of the Samurai, an order was sent out for his arrest. Kumazawa,
recognizing</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>872 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Xhe importance of the heels as especially philosophical organs, fled
to the mountains, and passed most of his remaining years in sylvan
obscurity. 1 “ In 1795 an edict went forth against the further teaching
of the Oyomei philosophy; and so docile was the mind of Japan that from
that time on Oyomei concealed itself within the phrases of Confucianism,
or entered as a modest component into that military Zen which, by a
typical paradox of history, transformed the pacific faith of Buddha into
the inspiration of patriotic warriors.</p>
<p>As Japanese scholarship developed, and became directly acquainted
with the writings of Confucius rather than merely with his Sung inter-
preters, men like Ito Jinsai and Ogyu Sorai established the Classical
School of Japanese thought, which insisted on going over the heads of
all com- mentators to the great K’ung himself. Ito Jinsai’s family did
not agree with him about the value of Confucius; they taunted him with
the impractica- bility of his studies, and predicted that he would die
in poverty. “Scholar - ship,” they told him, “belongs to the Chinese. It
is useless in Japan. Even though you obtain it you cannot sell it. Far
better become a physician and make money.” The young student listened
without hearing; he forgot the rank and wealth of his family, put aside
all material ambition, gave his house and property to a younger brother,
and went to live in solitude so that he might study without distraction.
He was handsome, and was some- times mistaken for a prince; but he
dressed like a peasant and shunned the public eye. “Jinsai,” says a
Japanese historian,</p>
<p>was very poor, so poor that at the end of the year he could not</p>
<p>make New Year’s rice cakes; but he was very calm about it. His</p>
<p>wife came, and kneeling down before him said: “I will do the house -
work under any circumstances; but there is one thing that is unbear-
able. Our boy Genso does not understand the meaning of our</p>
<p>poverty; he envies the neighbor’s children their rice cakes. I
scold</p>
<p>him, but my heart is tom in two.” Jinsai continued to pore over
his</p>
<p>books without making any reply. Then, taking off his garnet ring,</p>
<p>he handed it to his wife, as much as to say, “Sell this, and buy
some</p>
<p>rice cakes.” 1 “</p>
<p>At Kyoto Jinsai opened a private school, and lectured there for forty
years, training, all in all, some three thousand students in philosophy.
He spoke occasionally of metaphysics, and described the universe as a
living organ- ism in which life always overrode death; but like
Confucius he had a warm prejudice in favor of the terrestrial
practical.</p>
<p>873</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS</p>
<p>That which is useless in governing the state, or in walking in
the</p>
<p>way of human relations, is useless…. Learning must be active and</p>
<p>living; learning must not be mere dead theory or speculation….</p>
<p>Those who know the way seek it in their daily life…. If apart</p>
<p>from human relations we hope to find the way, it is like trying
to</p>
<p>catch the wind…. The ordinary way is excellent; there is no more</p>
<p>excellent in the world.™</p>
<p>After the death of Jinsai his school and work were carried on by his
son, Ito Togai. Togai laughed at fame, and said: “How can you help
calling a man, whose name is forgotten as soon as he dies, an animal or
sand? But is it not a mistake for man to be eager to make books, or
construct sentences, in order that his name m ay be admired, and may not
be forgotten?”“ He wrote two hundred and forty-two volumes; but for the
rest he lived a life of modesty and wisdom. The critics complained that
these books were strong in what Moliere called virtus dormitiva;
nevertheless Toga i’s pupils pointed out that he had written two hundred
and forty-two books without saying an unkind word of any other
philosopher. When he died they placed this enviable epitaph upon his
tomb:</p>
<p>He did not talk about the faults of others….</p>
<p>He cared for nothing but books.</p>
<p>His life was uneventful.“</p>
<p>The greatest of these later Confucians was Ogyu Sorai; as he himself
put the matter, “From the time of Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan, how
few scholars have been my equal!” Unlike Togai he enjoye d controversy,
and spoke his mind violently about philosophers living or dead. When an
in- quiring young man asked him, “What do you like besides reading?” he
answered, “There is nothing better than eating burnt beans and
criticizing the great men of J apan.” “Sorai,” said Namikawa Ten jin,
“is a very great man, but he thinks that he knows all that there is to
be known. This is a bad habit.”“ Ogyu could be modest when he wished:
all the Japanese, he said, explicitly including himself, were
barbarians; only the Chinese were civilized; and “if there is anything
that ought to be said, it has already been</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>874</p>
<p>(chap. XXI</p>
<p>XHobbes refuting Rousseau before Rousseau’s birth, flung his laughing
logic at Jinsai, who had announced that man is naturally good. On the
contrary, said Sorai, man is a natural villain, and grasps whatever he
can reach; only artificial morals and laws, and merciless education,
turn him into a tolerable citizen.</p>
<p>As soon as men are bom, desires spring up. When we cannot</p>
<p>realize our desires, which are unlimited, struggle arises; when</p>
<p>struggle arises, confusion follows. As the ancient kings hated
con-</p>
<p>fusion, they founded propriety and righteousness, and with these</p>
<p>governed the desires of the people…. Morality is nothing but the</p>
<p>necessary means for controlling the subjects of the Empire. It
did</p>
<p>not originate with nature, nor with the impulses of man’s heart, but
it was devised by the superior intelligence of certain sages, and</p>
<p>authority was given to it by the state. 1 *</p>
<p>As if to confirm the pessimism of Sorai, Japanese thought in the
century that followed him fell even from the modest level to which its
imitation of Confucius had raised it, and lost itself in a bitter
ink-shedding war between the idolaters of China and the worshipers of
Japan. In this battle of the ancients against the modems the modems won
by their superior admira- tion of antiquity. The Kangakusha, or (pro-)
Chinese scholars, called their own country barbarous, argued that all
wisdom was Chinese, and con- tented themselves with translating and
commenting upon Chinese litera- ture and philosophy. The Wagakusha, or
(pro-) Japanese scholars, de- nounced this attitude as obscurantist and
unpatriotic, and called upon the nation to turn its back upon China and
renew its strength at the sources of its own poetry and history. Mabuchi
attacked the Chinese as an inherently vicious people, exalted the
Japanese as naturally good, and attributed the lack of early or native
Japanese literature and philosophy to the fact that the Japanese did not
need instruction in virtue or intelligence.*</p>
<p>Inspired by a visit to Mabuchi, a young physician by the name of
Moto- ori Norinaga devoted thirty-four years to writing a
forty-four-volume commentary on the Kojiki, or “Records of Ancient
Events”— the classical</p>
<ul>
<li>From Sir E. Satow’s paraphrase of Mabuchi’s teaching: “In ancient
times, when men’s dispositions were straightforward, a complicated
system of morals was unnecessary…. In those days it was unnecessary to
have a doctrine of right and wrong. But the Chinese, being bad at heart…
were only good on the outside, and their bad acts became of such
magnitude that society was thrown into disorder. The Japanese, being
straightforward, could do without teaching. 1 ®</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XXIX) POLITICAL AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS 875</p>
<p>repository of Japanese, especially of Shinto, legends. This
commentary, the Kojiki-den, was a virorous assault upon everything
Chinese, in or out of Japan. It boldly upheld the literal truth of the
primitive stories that re- counted the divine origin of the Japanese
islands, emperors and people; and under the very eyes of the Tokugawa
regents it stimulated among the in- tellectuals of Japan that movement
back to their own language, ways and traditions which was ultimately to
revive Shinto as against Buddhism, and restore the supremacy of the
emperors over the shoguns. “Japan,” wrote Moto- ori, “is the country w
hich gave birth to the Goddess of the Sun, Amaterasu; and this fact
proves its superiority over all other countries.” 1 * 2 His pupil Hirata
carried on the argument after Moto- ori’s death:</p>
<p>It is most lamentable that so much ignorance should prevail as to</p>
<p>he evidences of the two fundamental doctrines that Japan is the</p>
<p>country of the gods, and her inhabitants the descendants of the</p>
<p>gods. Between the Japanese people and the Chinese, Hindus, Rus-</p>
<p>sians, Dutch, Siamese, Cambodians, and other nations of the world,
there is a difference of kind rather than of degree. It was not out
of</p>
<p>vainglory that the inhabitants of this country called it the land
of</p>
<p>he gods. The gods who created all countries belonged, without ex-</p>
<p>ception, to the Divine Age, and were all born in Japan, so that</p>
<p>Japan is their native country, and all the world acknowledges the</p>
<p>appropriateness of the title. The Koreans were the first to
become</p>
<p>acquainted with this truth, and from them it was gradually
diffused</p>
<p>hrough the globe, and accepted by everyone…. Foreign countries were
of course produced by the power of the creator gods, but they were not
begotten by Izanagi and Izanami, nor did they give birth</p>
<p>o the Goddess of the Sun, which is the cause of their inferiority. 1
®</p>
<p>Such were the men and the opinions that established the Sonno Jo-i
movement to “honor the Emperor and expel the foreign barbarians.” In the
nineteenth century that movement inspired the Japanese people to
overthrow the Shogunate and reestablish the supremacy of the Divine
House. In the twentieth it plays a living role in nourishing that
fiery</p>
<p>patriotism which will not be content until the Son of Heaven rules
all the fertile millions of the resurrected East.</p>
