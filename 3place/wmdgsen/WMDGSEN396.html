<h4 id="chapter-xii">CHAPTER XII</h4>
<p>Emilia and the Marches</p>
<p>1378-1534</p>
<p>I. CORREGGIO</p>
<p>F IFTY miles south of Verona one comes to the old Via Emilia, or Emi-
lian Way, which ran 175 miles from Piacenza through Parma, Reggio,
Modena, Bologna, Imola, Forli, and Cesena to Rimini.* We pass over
Piacenza and (for the moment) Parma, to note a little commune eight
miles northeast of Reggio, and sharing its name. Correggio is one of
several towns in Italy that are remembered only through some genius to
whom they gave a cognomen. Its ruling family also was called Correggio;
one member was the Niccolo da Correggio who wrote genteel verses for
Beatrice and Isa- bella d’Este. It was a place where you might expect
genius to be born and to die, but not to stay, for it had no significant
art, or clear tradition, to give to ability instruction and form. But in
the first decades of the sixteenth century the house of Correggio was
headed by Count Gilbert X, and his wife, Veronica Gambara, was one of
the great ladies of the Renaissance. She could speak Latin, knew
Scholastic philosophy, wrote a commentary on patristic theo logy,
composed delicate Petrarchian verses, was called “the tenth Muse.” She
made her little court a salon for artists and poets, and helped to
spread that romantic worship of woman which was now re- placing, among
the upper classes of Italy, the medieval worship of Mary, and was
molding Italian art toward the representation of feminine charms. On
September 3, 1528, she wrote to Isabella d’Este that “our Messer An -
tonio Allegri has just finished a masterpiece picturing Magdalen in the
desert, and ex pressing in full the sublime art of which he is a great
master.” 1</p>
<p>It was this Antonio Allegri who unwittingly stole the name and made
the fame of his town, though his family name might have well expressed
the joyous nature of his art. His father was a small landed proprietor,
prosper- ous enough to win for his son a bride with a dowry of 257
ducats (425?).</p>
<ul>
<li>All these, with Ferrara and Ravenna, constitute the modern
compartimento of Emilia. Southeast of Rimini are the Marches, or
frontier provinces, of Pesaro and Urbino, Ancona, Macerata, and Ascoli
Piceno.</li>
</ul>
<p>327</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>3*8</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>When Antonio showed a flair for drawing and painting he was
apprenticed to his uncle Lorenzo Allegri. Who taught him further we do
not know; some say that he went to Ferrara to study with Francesco de’
Bianchi -Fer- rari, then to the studios of Francia and Costa at Bologna,
then with Costa to Mantua, where he felt the influence of the massive
frescoes of Mantegna. In any case he spent most of his life in Correggio
in comparative obscurity, and presumably he was the only one in the town
who suspected that he would be ranked among the “immortals.” He seems to
have studied the engravings that Marcantonio Raimondi had made from
Raphael, and prob- ably saw, if only in copy, the chief works of
Leonardo. All these influences entered into his completely individual
style.</p>
<p>The sequence of his subjects corresponds to the decline of
religion</p>
<p>among the literate classes of Italy in the first quarter of the
sixteenth cen- tury, and the rise of secular patronage and themes. His
early works, even when painted for private purchasers, told again, and
mostly for churches, the Christian story: The Adoration of the Magi,
where the Virgin has the pretty, girlish face that Correggio later
confined to subordinate characters; The Holy Family ; The Madonna of
St. Francis, still traditional in all its features; The Repose on the
Return from Egypt, freshly original in com- position, coloring, and
characterization; La Zingarella, where the Virgin, leaning fondly over
her babe, is drawn with full Correggian grace; and The Madonna Adoring
Her Child, which makes The infant the radiant source of the scene’s
illumination.</p>
<p>His pagan turn came through an odd commission. In 1518 Giovanna da
Piacenza, abbess of the convent of San Paolo in Parma, engaged him to
decorate her apartment. She was a lady of more pedigree than piety; she
chose as theme of the frescoes chaste Diana, goddess of the hunt. Over
the fireplace Correggio portrayed Diana in a splendid chariot; above
her, in sixteen radial sections converging in the cupola, he painted
scenes from classical mythology; in one a dog, too passionately hugged
by a child, ex- presses with a remarkably pictured eye his fear of being
choked with love, and shames by his alert beauty all the human and
divine figures scattered about. From this time forward the human body,
mostly nude, became for Correggio the chief element in pictorial
decoration, and pagan motives entered into even his Christian themes.
The abbess had converted him from Christianity.</p>
<p>His success made a stir in Parma, and brought him lucrative
assignments. About 1519 he painted The Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine
(Naples); the Virgin and the saint were here unspeakably beautiful; and
yet, four</p>
<p>CHAP.XIl) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 329</p>
<p>years later, Correggio surpassed them when he used the same subject
for the picture that is one of the treasures of the Louvre — lovely
faces, an al- luring landscape, the magic play of light and shade upon
flowing raiment and waving hair.</p>
<p>In 1 520 Correggio accepted an arduous commission from Parma — to
paint frescoes in the cupola and over the tribune and side chapels of a
new Bene- dictine abbey church, San Giovanni Evangelista. He toiled on
this task for four years, and in 1523 he moved with his wife and
children to Parma to be nearer his work. In the dome he represented the
Apostles, seated com- fortably in a circle on soft clouds, and fixing
their gaze upon a Christ whose foreshortened figure, seen from below,
gives an astonishing illusion of distance. The splendor of this dome is
in the superbly modeled figures of the Apostles, some of them quite
nude, rivaling the gods of Pheidias, and perhaps echoing in their
muscular splendor the figures that Michelangelo had painted on the
Sistine Chapel ceiling twelve years before. In a spandrel between two
arches a powerful St. Ambrose discusses theology with an Apostle John
who is as handsome as any Parthenon ephebus. Luscious youthful forms,
theoretically angels, fill the interstices with angelic faces, buttocks,
legs, and thighs. The Greek revival, already old in humanism and
Manutius, is here in full swing in Christian art.</p>
<p>In 1522 the great cathedral of Parma opened its doors to the young
artist, and contracted to pay him a thousand ducats (f 1 2,500) to paint
the chapels, apse, choir, and dome. On this assignment he worked at
intervals through eight years, from 1526 till his death. For the dome he
chose the Assump- tion of the Virgin, and shocked many of the cathedral
canons by making this culminating picture a whirling panorama of human
flesh. In the center the Virgin, reclining on the air, floats up to
heaven with arms outstretched to meet her Son; around and beneath her a
heavenly host of Apostles, dis- ciples, and saints — magnificent figures
worthy of Raphael at his best — seems to puff her upward with the breath
of adoration; and supporting her is a choir of angels looking remarkably
like healthy boys and girls in all the splendor of youthful nudity;
these are the loveliest adolescent nudes in Italian art. One of the
canons, confused by so many arms and legs, de- nounced the painting as
“a fricassee of frogs”; apparently other member s of the chapter were
dubious about this melee of human flesh celebrating a virgin; and
Correggio’s work on the cathedral seems to have been inter - rupted for
a time.</p>
<p>He was now (1530) advancing in middle age, and longed for the peace
of a settled life. He bought some acres outside Correggio, became, like
his</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>father, a landed proprietor, and strove to support his family and his
farm with his brush. During and after his major enterprises he produced
a series of religious pictures, almost every one of them masterly:
Magdalen Read- ing; The Virgin of St. Sebastian — the fairest Virgin in
Correggio; The Madonna della Scodella — “with a bowl” and an
incomparable Bambino; The Madonna di San Girolamo, sometimes called II
Giorno or Day, in which the Jerome is worthy of Michelangelo, and the
angel holding a book before the Child is a vision of girlish beauty, and
the Magdalen laying her cheek upon the Child’s thigh is the purest and
tenderest of sinners, and the warm rich reds and yellows make a canvas
worthy of Titian at his best; and finally a companion picture, The
Adoration of the Shepherds, which fancy has called La Notte, Night. What
interested Correggio in these pictures was not the religious sentiment
but the esthetic values — the adoring devo- tion of the young mother,
herself so comely with oval face, glossy hair, dropped eyelids, slender
nose, thin lips, full bosom; or the masculine mus- cles of athletic
saints; or the demure loveliness of Magdalen, or the rosy flesh of a
child. Correggio, coming down from cathedral scaffolds, re- freshed
himself with composite visions of beauties that might be.</p>
<p>About 1523 a series of commissions from Federigo II Gonzaga invited
the full expression of the pagan element in his art. Wishing to court
the favor of Charles V, the Marquis ordered picture after picture, sent
them as gifts to the Emperor, and received his coveted bauble, the title
of duke. For him, schooled in the paganism of Rome, Correggio painted a
succes- sion of mythological subjects, commemorating Olympian triumphs
of love or desire. In The Education of Eros Venus blindfolds Cupid (lest
the hu- man race should die) ; in Jupiter and Antiope the god, disguised
as a satyr, advances upon the lady as she lies in naked slumber on the
grass; in Dana’e a winged herald prepares for Jupiter’s coming by
undraping the fair maid, while beside her bed two putti play in happy
indifference to the morality of the gods; in lo Jupiter descends from
his boredom in a concealing cloud and clasps with omnipotent hand a
plump lady who hesitates gracefully and ends by yielding to the
compliment of desire. In The Rape of Ganymede a pretty boy is flown to
heaven by an eagle in haste to meet the needs of the ambidextrous god of
gods. In Leda and the Swan the lover is a swan, but the motive is the
same. Even in The Virgin and St. George two naked Cupids romp before the
Virgin, and St. George, in his flashing mail, is the physical ideal of
Renaissance youth.</p>
<p>We must not conclude that Correggio was merely a sensualist with a
flair for painting flesh. He loved beauty perhaps immoderately, and in
these</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 331</p>
<p>mythologies he stressed the surface of it too exclusively; but in his
Madon- nas he had done justice to a profounder beauty. He himself, while
his brush romped through Olympus, lived like an orderly bourgeois,
devoted to his family, and seldom leaving home except to work. “He was
content with little,” Vasari tells us, “and lived as a good Christian
should.” He is reported to have been timid and melancholy; who would not
be melan- choly coming every day into a world of deformed adults from a
haunting dream of loveliness?</p>
<p>Perhaps some quarrel arose about payment for the work in the
cathedral. When Titian visited Parma he heard echoes of the dispute, and
gave his opinion that if the dome could be inverted and filled with
ducats they would not adequately pay for what Correggio had painted
there. In any case the payme nts were curiously involved in the artist’s
premature death.</p>
<p>For so short a life his achievement was stupendous, far greater than
all that Leonardo, or Titian, or Michelangelo, or anyone but Raphael
could show in their first forty years. Correggio equals them all in
grace of line, the soft modeling of contour^, in portraying the living
texture of human flesh. His coloring has a liquid and radiant quality,
alive with reflections and transparencies, softer — with its violet,
orange, rose, blue, and silver hues — than the glaring brilliance of the
later Venetians. He was a master of chiaroscuro, of light and shade in
their endless combinations and revela- tions; in some of his Madonnas
matter becomes almost a form and function of light. He experimented
bravely with schemes of composition — pyra- midal, diagonal, circular;
but in his cupola frescoes he let unity slip through a superabundance of
Apostolic and angelic legs. He played too fondly with foreshortenings,
so that the figures in his cupolas, though drawn as science might
require, seem huddled and cramped and ungainly, like the ascending
Christ of San Giovanni Evangelista. On the other hand he cared nothing
for mechanics, so that many of his characters, like Micawber, lack all
visible means of support. He painted some religious subjects with ex-
quisite tenderness, but his prevailing interest was in the body — its
beauty, movements, attitudes, joys; and his later pictures symbolized
the triumph of Venus over the Virgin in sixteenth-century Italian
art.</p>
<p>His influence in Italy and France was rivaled only by Michelangelo’s.
In the later sixteenth century the Bolognese school of painting, led by
the</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>332</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>Carracci, took him as their model; and their followers, Guido Reni
and Domenichino, founded upon Correggio an art of physical excellence
and sensual sentiment. Charles Le Brun and Pierre Mignaud imported into
France, and deployed in Versailles, a rosy voluptuous style of
decoration through pagan figures, darting Cupids, and chubby cherubim.
Correggio, rather than Raphael, conquered France, and left upon its art
an influence that lasted till Watteau.</p>
<p>In Parma itself his work was continued, and then transformed, by
Fran- cesco Mazzuoli, called by Italian whim il Parmigianino — the
Parmesan. Born an orphan (1504), he was reared by two uncles who were
painters, so that his talent ripened rapidly. At seventeen he was
commissioned to decorate a chapel of that same church — San Giovanni
Evangelista — in which Correggio was painting the dome; in these
frescoes his style achieved an almost Correggian grace, to which he
added his own peculiar love of fine raiment. About this time he painted
a remarkable portrait of himself as seen in a mirror; this is one of the
most engaging autorittrati in art, reveal- ing a lad of refinement,
sensitivity, and pride. When Parma was besieged by papal troops his
uncles packed up this and others of his pictures, and sent Francesco
with them to Rome (1523) to study the works of Raphael and Michelangelo,
and seek the favor of Pope Clement VII. He was on the way to full
success when the sack of Rome forced him to flee to Bologna (1527).
There a fellow artist robbed him of all his engravings and designs.
Presumably by this time his protective uncles had died. He earned his
bread by painting for Pietro Aretino the queenly Madonna della Rosa,
formerly in Dresden, and for some nuns the Santa Margherita, which still
survives in Bologna. When Charles V came there to reorganize a devas-
tated Italy, Francesco made a portrait of him in oils; the Emperor liked
it, and might have made the artist’s fortune, but Parmigianino took the
por - trait back to his studio to give it a few finishing touches, and
never saw Charles again.</p>
<p>He returned to Parma (1531), and received a commission to paint a
vault in the church of the Madonna della Steccata. He was now at the top
of his powers, and his incidental products were of a high order: a
Turkish Slave who looks more like a princess; a Marriage of
St. Catherine matching Correggio’s handling of this theme, with children
of unearthly beauty; and an anonymous portrait allegedly of his mistress
Antea, described as one of the most famous courtesans of the time, but
here angelically demure, with robes too gorgeous for anyone less than a
queen.</p>
<p>EMILIA AND THE MARCHES</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>But now Parmigianino, perhaps goaded on by his misfortunes and pov-
erty, became ardently interested in alchemy, and neglected his painting
to set up furnaces for the improvisation of gold. The ecclesiastics of
San Giovanni, unable to recall him to his work there, ordered his arrest
for violation of contract. The painter fled to Casalmaggiore, lost
himself in alembics and crucibles, let his beard grow, neglected his
person and his health, caught a chill and fever, and died as suddenly as
Correggio (1540).</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>BOLOGNA</li>
</ol>
<p>If we pass over Reggio and Modena in unseemly haste it is not because
they had no cherished heroes of sword or brush or pen. In Reggio an
Augustinian monk, Ambrogio Calepino, compiled a dictionary of Latin and
Italian, which in successive editions grew into a polyglot lexicon of
eleven languages (1590). Little Carpi had a handsome cathedral designed
by Baldassare Peruzzi (1514). Modena had a sculptor, Guido Mazzoni, who
shocked his townsmen by the realism of a terra-cotta Cristo morto; and
the fifteenth-century choir stalls of the eleventh-century cathedral
matched the beauty of the fagade and campanile. Pellegrino da Modena,
who worked with Raphael in Rome and then returned to his native city,
might have become a painter of note had he not been murdered by ruffians
bent upon killing his son. Doubtless Renaissance violence snuffed out in
their growth a regiment of potential geniuses.</p>
<p>Bologna, standing at a main crossing of Italy’s trade routes,
continued to prosper, though her intellectual leadership was passing to
Florence as hu- manism dethroned Scholasticism. Her university was now
only one of many in Italy, and could no longer read the law to pontiffs
and emperors; but its medical school was still supreme. The popes
claimed Bologna as one of the Papal States, and Cardinal Albornoz had
passingly enforced the claim (1360); but the schism of the Church
between rival popes (1378-1417) reduced papal control to a technicality.
A rich family, the Bentivogli, rose to political mastery, and maintained
throughout the fifteenth century a mild dictatorship, which observed
republican forms and acknowledged but ignored the overlordship of the
popes. As capo or head of the Senate, Gio- vanni Bentivoglio governed
Bologna for thirty-seven years (1469-1506) with sufficient wisdom and
justice to win the admiration of princes and the affection of the
people. He paved streets, improved roads, and built canals; he helped
the poor with gifts, and organized public works to mitigate un-
employment; he actively supported the arts. It was he who brought
Lo-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>renzo Costa to Bologna; for him and his sons Francia painted;
Filelfo, Guarino, Aurispa, and other humanists were welcomed to his
court. Dur- ing the later years of his rule, embittered by a conspiracy
to depose him, he used harsh methods to maintain his ascendancy, and
forfeited the good will of the people. In 1506 Pope Julius II advanced
upon Bologna with a papal army, and demanded his abdication. He yielded
peaceably, was allowed to depart intact, and died in Milan two years
later. Julius agreed that Bologna should thenceforth be ruled by its
Senate, subject to veto, by a papal legate, of legislation opposed by
the Church. The rule of the popes proved more orderly and liberal than
that of the Bentivogli; local self-government was unhindered; and the
university enjoyed remarkable academic freedom. Bologna remained a papal
state, in fact as well as name, till the advent of Napoleon (1796).</p>
<p>Renaissance Bologna was proud of its civic architecture. The guild of
merchants raised an elegant Mercanzia, or Chamber of Commerce (1382^,
and the lawyers rebuilt (1384) their imposing Palazzo dei Notari. The
nobles built handsome palaces like the Bevilacqua, where the Council of
Trent would hold its sittings in 1547, and the Palazzo Pallavicini,
described by a contemporary as “not unworthy of kings.” 3 The massive
Palazzo del Podesta, seat of the government, received a new fa9ade
(1492), and Bra- mante designed a stately spiral staircase for the
Palazzo Comunale. Many facades had arcades on the street level, so that
one might walk for miles in the heart of the city without being exposed
— except at crossings — to sun or rain.</p>
<p>While in the university skeptics like Pomponazzi questioned the
immor- tality of the soul, the people and their rulers built new
churches, adorned or repaired old ones, and brought hopeful offerings to
miracle-working shrines. The Franciscan friars added to their
picturesque church of San Francesco one of the fairest campaniles in
Italy. The Dominicans enriched their church of San Domenico with choir
stalls painstakingly carved and inlaid by Fra Damiano of Bergamo; and
they engaged Michelangelo to carve four figures for the ornate area or
tabernacle in which the bones of their founder were zealously preserved.
The great pride and tragedy of Bolognese art was the cathedral of San
Petronio. Far back in the fifth century this Petronius had served the
city as its bishop, and had been deeply loved for his beneficence. In 1
307 many worshipers claimed to have been healed of blindness, deafness,
or other infirmities by washing the diseased parts with water from the
well beneath his shrine. Soon the city had to provide accommodations for
hundreds of pilgrims seeking cures. In 1388</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 335</p>
<p>the communal council decreed that a church should be built for San
Pe- tronio, and on a scale that would humble the Florentines and their
duomo; it was to be 700 by 460 feet, with a dome rising to 500 feet from
the ground. Money proved less ample than pride; only nave and aisles to
the transept were completed, and only the lower part of the fagade. But
that lower part is a masterpiece that attests the noble aspirations and
taste of Renais- sance art. The portal jambs and architrave were carved
with reliefs (1425-</p>

of compari- son with Michelangelo’s FietL These works of Iacopo della
Quercia of Siena were an inspiration to Michelangelo, and he might have
been saved from the muscular exaggerations of his sculptural style had
he accepted more of the classic purity in della Quercia’s designs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sculpture rivaled architecture in Bologna. Properzia de’ Rossi carved
a bas-relief for the fagade of San Petronio; it won such praise that
when Clement VII came to Bologna he asked to see her; but she had died
in that week. Alfonso Lombardi, whose reliefs won Michelangelo’s praise,
stepped into history on the coattails of Titian. Learning that Charles
V, during the conference at Bologna (1530), was to sit for Titian, he
persuaded the painter to take him along as a servant; and while Titian
painted, Alfonso, partly concealed behind him, modeled the Emperor in
stucco. Charles spied him, and asked to see his work; he liked it, and
asked Alfonso to copy it in marble. When Charles paid Titian a thousand
crowns he bade him give half to Alfonso. Lombardi brought the finished
marble to Charles at Genoa, and received an additional three hundred
crowns. Now famous, Alfonso was taken to Rome by Cardinal Ippolito de’
Medici, and was commissioned by him to carve tombs for Leo X and Clement
VII. But the Cardinal died in 1535; and Alfonso, losing his commissions
and his patron, followed him, within a year, to the grave.</p>
<p>Painting, in fourteenth-century Bologna, was chiefly illumination;
and when it graduated into murals it followed a stiff Byzantine style.
It was apparently two artists from Ferrara who aroused Bolognese
painters from the rigor mortis of Byzantium. When Francesco Cossa came
to make his home in Bologna (1470) there was still in his painting a
certain Mante- gnesque severity and sculptural hardness of line, but he
had learned to in- fuse his figures with feeling as well as dignity, to
set them in motion, and to bathe them in a living play of light. Lorenzo
Costa arrived in Bologna</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>33&lt;5</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>when he was a lad of twenty-three (1483), and he stayed there for
twenty- six years. He took a studio in the same house as Francia; the
two men became fast friends, and influenced each other to mutual
advantage; some- times they painted a picture together. Costa won the
praise and ducats of Giovanni Bentivoglio by painting an excellent
Madonna Enthroned in San Petronio. When Giovanni fled at the approach of
the terrible Julius</p>
<p>(1506), Costa accepted an invitation to succeed Mantegna at
Mantua.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Francesco Francia was making himself the head and crown of
the Bolognese school. His father was Marco Raibolini, but as surnames
were loose in Italy, Francesco became known by the name of the goldsmith
to whom he was apprenticed. For many years he practised the goldsmith’s
art, silverwork, niello, enameling, and engraving. He was made master of
the mint, and engraved the coins of the city for both Bentivoglio and
the popes; and his coins were so distinguished by their beauty that they
became collectors’ items, bringing high prices soon after his death.
Vasari describes him as a lovable man, “so pleasant in conversation that
he could divert the most melancholy individuals, and won the affection
of princes and lords and all who knew him.” 4</p>
<p>We cannot say what turned Francia to painting. Bentivoglio discovered
his talent, and commissioned him — already forty-nine — to paint an
altarpiece for a chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore (1499). The dictator was
pleased, and engaged Francia to decorate his palace with murals. They
were de- stroyed when the populace sacked the palace in 1507, but we
have Vasari’s word for it that these and other frescoes “brought Francia
such reverence in the cit y that he was reckoned as a god.” 5
Commissions poured in upon him, and perhaps he accepted too many to
allow his best potentialities to mature. Mantua, Reggio, Parma, Lucca,
and Urbino received panels from his brush; the Pinacoteca Bolognese has
a roomful of them; Verona has a Holy Family, Turin an Entombment, the
Louvre a Crucifixion, London a Dead Christ and a striking portrait of
Bartolommeo Bianchini, the Morgan Library a Virgin and Child, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art a delightful portrait of Federigo Gonzaga in
youth. None of these is of the first order, but each is gracefully
drawn, softly colored, and suffused with a tenderness and piety that
makes them heralds of Raphael.</p>
<p>Francia’s epistolary friendship with Raphael is one of the pleasa
ntest epi- sodes of the Renaissance. Timoteo Viti was among Francia’s
pupils at Bologna (1490- 5), and became at Urbino one of Raphael’s early
teachers;</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 337</p>
<p>cused himself as too old, but he wrote a sonnet in Raphael’s praise.
Raphael sent him a letter (September 5, 1508) rich in Renaissance
courtesy:</p>
<p>M. Francesco mio caro:</p>
<p>I have just received your portrait, brought to me in good con-</p>
<p>dition … for which I thank you very warmly. It is most beautiful,</p>
<p>so lifelike that I sometimes mistake, believing myself to be with you
and to hear your words. I pray you to excuse and pardon the delay</p>
<p>and postponement of my self-portrait, which, because of important and
incessant occupation, I have not yet been able to execute with</p>
<p>my own hand in accordance with our agreement. . . . However, I</p>
<p>send you meanwhile another drawing, of the Nativity, done amid</p>
<p>so many other things that I blush for it; I do this trifle rather in
sign</p>
<p>of obedience and love than for anything else. If in exchange I
shall</p>
<p>receive 〔the drawing of〕 your story of Judith I shall place it
among</p>
<p>the things that are dearest and most precious to me.</p>
<p>Monsignor il Datario expects your little Madonna with great anx-</p>
<p>iety, and Cardinal Riario the large one. … I look for them with</p>
<p>that pleasure and satisfaction with which I see and praise all
your</p>
<p>works, never seeing any others more beautiful, or more devout and
well done, than yours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile take courage, take care of yourself with your wonted</p>
<p>prudence, and be assured that I feel your afflictions as if they
were</p>
<p>my own. Continue to love me as I love you with all my heart.</p>
<p>Always entirely at your service,</p>
<p>Your Raffaelle Sancio . 7</p>
<p>We may allow here for some mannerly flourish, but that this mutual
af- fection was real appears from another letter, in which Raphael sent
his famous St. Cecilia to Francia, to be placed in a chapel at Bologna,
and asked him, “as a friend, to correct .any errors he might find in
it.” 8 Vasari relates that when Francia saw the picture he was so
overwhelmed by its beauty, and so painfully recognized his own
inferiority, that he lost all will to paint, grew ill, and presently
died, in the sixty-seventh year of his age (1517). This is one of many
dubious deaths in Vasari; but he adds, graciously, that there were other
theories.</p>
<p>Perhaps, before his death, Francia saw some engravings made in Rome
by his pupil Marcantonio Raimondi from the drawings of Raphael. Visiting
Venice, Mark saw some engravings by Albrecht Diirer on copper or wood.
He spent almost all his travel money buying thirty-six wood engravings
by the Nuremberg master on the Passion of Christ; he copied them on
copper,</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>made prints from the copies, and sold the prints as Diirer’s works.
Going to Rome, he engraved on copper a drawing by Raphael, so faithfully
that the painter allowed a great number of his drawings to be engraved,
and prints to be made and sold. Raimondi copied also the paintings of
Raphael and others, transferred the copy to copper, and sold the prints.
While he made a living in this novel way, the artists of Europe, without
visiting Italy, could now know the design of the famous paintings of the
Renaissance masters. Finiguerra, Raimondi, and their successors did for
art what Guten- berg and Aldus Manutius and others did for scholarship
and literature: they built new lines of communication and transmission,
and offered to youth at least the outlines of its heritage.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>ALONG THE EMILIAN WAY</li>
</ol>
<p>Eastward from Bologna lies a string of minor towns that contributed
their commensurate luster to the total splendor of the Renaissance.
Little Imola had its Innocenzo da Imola, who studied with Francia, and
left a Holy Family almost worthy of Raphael. Faenza gave its name and
partial industry to faience; there — as in Gubbio, Pesaro, Castel
Durante, and Ur- bino — Italian potters in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries perfected the art of coating earthenware with opaque enamel,
and painting thereon, with metallic oxides, designs that on firing
became brilliant purples, greens, and blues. Forli (anciently Forum
Livii) was made famous by two painters and one virile heroine. Melozzo
da Forli we defer to Rome, his favorite theater of operations. His pupil
Marco Palmezzano painted the old Chris- tian themes for a hundred
churches or patrons, and left us a deceptively charming portrait of
Caterina Sforza.</p>
<p>Born out of wedlock to Galeazzomaria Sforza, Duke of Milan, Caterina
married the cruel and rapacious Girolamo Riario, despot of Forli. In
1488 his subjects rebelled, killed him, and captured Caterina and her
children; but troops loyal to her held the citadel. She promised her
captors, if re- leased, to go and persuade these soldiers to surrender;
they agreed, but kept her children as hostages. Once in the castle she
had its gates closed, and vigorously directed the resistance of the
garrison. When the rebels threat- ened to kill her children unless she
and her men submitted, she defied them, and told them from the ramparts
that she had another child in her womb, and could easily conceive more.
Lodovico of Milan sent troops who ef- fected her rescue; the rebellion
was mercilessly suppressed; and Caterina’s</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 339</p>
<p>son Ottaviano was made lord of Forli under his mother’s iron thumb.
We shall meet her again.</p>
<p>North and south of the Emilian Way two ancient capitals survive: Ra-
venna, once the retreat of Roman emperors, and San Marino, the inex-
tinguishable republic. Around the ninth-century convent of St. Marinus
(d. 366) a tiny settlement formed, which, from its once easily
defensible perch on a rocky mountain top, remained immune to all the
condottieri of the Renaissance. Its independence was formally recognized
by Pope Ur- ban VIII in 1631, and endures by the courtesy of the Italian
government, which finds little there to tax. Ravenna recaptured a
passing prosperity after the Venetians took it in 1441; Julius II
reclaimed it for the papacy in 1509; and three years later a French
army, having won a famous battle near by, felt entitled to sack the city
so thoroughly that it never recovered until the Second World War, which
shattered it again. There, on a com- mission from Bernardo Bembo, father
of the poet cardinal, Pietro Lom- bardo designed the tomb (1483) that
houses Dante’s bones.</p>
<p>Rimini — where the Emilian Way, just south of the Rubicon, reached
its Adriatic end — entered violently into Renaissance history through
its ruling family, the Malatestas — Evil Heads. They appear first toward
the end of the tenth century as lieutenants of the Holy Roman Empire,
governing the Marches of Ancona for Otho III. By playing Guelf and
Ghibelline factions against each other, and making obeisance now to the
emperor, now to the pope, they acquired actual, though not formal,
sovereignty over Ancona, Rimini, and Cesena, and ruled them as despots
acknowledging no morals except those of intrigue, treachery, and the
sword. Machiavelli’s Prince was a feeble echo of their reality — blood
and iron turned into ink, like Bis- marck into Nietzsche. It was a
Malatesta, Giovanni, who, in a monogamous moment, killed his wife
Francesca da Rimini and his brother Paolo (1285). Carlo Malatesta
established the repute of the family in the patronage of arts and
letters. Sigismondo Malatesta carried the dynasty to its zenith of
power, culture, and assassination. His many mistresses gave him several
children, in some instances with disturbing simultaneity. 9 He married
thrice, and killed two wives on pretext of adultery. 10 He was alleged
to have made his daughter pregnant, to have attempted sodomy with his
son, who repelled him with drawn dagger, 11 and to have wreaked his lust
upon the corpse of a German lady who had preferred death to his embrace;
12 however we have for these exploits only the word of his foes. To his
final mistress, Isotta degli Atti, he gave unwonted devotion and
ultimately mar-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>(chap. XII</p>
<p>riage; and after her death he set up in the church of San Francesco a
monu- ment marked Dime lsottae sacrum — “Sacred to the Divine Isotta.”
He seems to have denied God and immortality; he thought it a merry prank
to fill with ink the holy-water stoup of a church, and to watch the
worship- ers bespatter themselves as they entered. 13</p>
<p>Crime had not enough varieties to exhaust his energy. He was an able
general, known for reckless bravery, and for resolute endurance of all
the hardships incident to military life. He wrote poetry, studied Latin
and Greek, supported scholars and artists, and delighted in their
company. He was especially fond of Leon Battista Alberti, the Leonardo
before da Vinci, and commissioned him to transform the cathedral of San
Francesco into a Roman temple. Leaving the thirteenth-century Gothic
church intact, Al- berti fronted it with a classic fagade modeled on the
Arch of Augustus erected at Rimini 27 b.c.; he planned to cover the
choir with a dome, but this was never built; the result is an unpleasant
torso, called by contem- poraries Tempio Malatestiano. The art with
which Sigismondo had the interior refinished was a paean to paganism. In
a brilliant fresco by Piero della Francesca, Sigismondo was shown
kneeling before his patron saint; but this was almost the only Christian
symbol left in the church. In one of the chapels Isotta was buried; and
on the tomb an inscription was placed twenty years before her death: “To
Isotta of Rimini, in beauty and virtue the glory of Italy.” In another
chapel were representations of Mars, Mer - cury, Saturn, Diana, and
Venus. The walls of the church were carved with marble reliefs of a high
order, chiefly by Agostino di Duccio, representing satyrs, angels,
singing boys, and personified arts and sciences, and embla- zoned with
the initials of Sigismondo and Isotta. Pope Pius II, a lover of the
class ics, described the new structure as a “nobile templum … so filled
with pagan symbols that it seemed the shrine not of Christians but of
infi- dels worshiping heathen deities.” 14</p>
<p>At the Peace of Mantua (1459) Pius compelled Sigismondo to restore
his principalities to the Church. When the doughty despot renewed his
hold upon them, Pius hurled a bull of excommunication at him, charging
him with heresy, parricide, incest, adultery, rape, perjury, treason,
and sacri- lege. 15 Sigismondo laughed at the bull, saying that it had
not perceptibly lessened his enjoyment of food and wine. 18 But the
patience, arms, and strategy of the scholar Pope proved too much for
him; in 1463 he knelt in penitence before a papal legate, surrendered
his realm to the Church, and received absolution. Still afire with
energy, he took command of a Ve- netian army, won several victories
against the Turks, and returned to</p>
<p>EMILIA AND THE MARCHES</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>341</p>
<p>’Ri mini with what seemed to him a prize as precious as the bones of
the greatest saint — the ashes of the philosopher Gemistus Pletho, the
Greek Platonist who had in effect proposed the replacement of
Christianity with a Neoplatonic pagan faith. Sigismondo buried his
treasure in a splendid tomb alongside his Tempio. Three years later
(1468) he died. We must not forget him in our composite image of the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>If Sigismondo represented that small but influential minority which
had more or less openly ceased to accept the medieval Christian creed,
we need only follow the Adriatic down from Rimini into the Marches to
Loreto to find a living symbol of the old religion still warm in Italian
hearts. Every year during the Renaissance, as in our times, thousands of
earnest pilgrims traveled to Loreto to visit the Casa Santa, or Holy
House, in which, they were told, Mary and Joseph and Jesus had lived in
Nazareth, and which, said the marvelous legend, had been miraculously
transported by angels first to Dalmatia (1291), then (1294) over the
Adriatic to a laurel grove (lauretum) near Recanati. Around the little
stone house a marble screen was built from designs by Bramante, and
Andrea Sansovino added sculp- tural decorations; and over the Casa a
church called the santuario was raised by Giuliano da Maiano and
Giuliano da Sangallo (i468f). On a small altar inside the Holy House was
a figure of Mary and her Child in black cedar, which piety ascribed to
the artist hand of Luke the Evangelist. Consumed by fire in 1921, the
group was replaced by a reproduction, adorned with jewels and precious
stones; and silver lamps keep lights burning before it day and night.
This too was part of the Renaissance.</p>

<li>URBINO AND CASTIGLIONE</li>
</ol>
<p>Twenty miles inland from the Adriatic, midway between Loreto and
Rimini, hidden aloft on a scenic spur of the Apennines, the little
principality of Urbino — forty miles square — was in the fifteenth
century one of the most civilized centers on the earth. That fortunate
territory, two hundred years before, had come into the possession of a
family — the Montefeltri — that made fortunes as condottieri, and spent
them as wisely as they were darkly earned. In a remarkable reign of
thirty-eight years (1444-82) Federigo da Montefeltro ruled Urbino with a
skill and justice unequaled even by Lo- renzo the Magnificent. He began
judiciously by being a pupil of Vittorino da Feltre, and his life was
the finest encomium that noble teacher ever received. While governing
Urbino he hired himself out as a general to</p>
<p>34 2</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>Naples, Milan, Florence, and the Church. He never lost a battle, and
never allowed war to touch his own soil. He captured a town by forging a
letter, and sacked Volterra with superfluous thoroughness; yet he was
reputed the most merciful commander of the time. In civil life he was a
man of high honor and fidelity. He earned enough as a condottiere to
administer his state without oppressively taxing his people; he walked
unarmed and unprotected among them, confident of their affectionate
loyalty. Every morning he gave audience, in a garden open on all sides,
to any who wished to speak to him; in the afternoon he rendered
judgment, in the Latin tongue. He relieved the destitute, dowered orphan
girls, filled his granaries in time of plenty, sold grain cheaply in
time of dearth, and forgave the debts of impoverished purchasers. He was
a good husband, a good father, a gener- ous friend.</p>
<p>In 1468 he built for himself, his court, and the five hundred members
of his government a palace that served not so much as a bastion of
defense as a center of administration and a citadel of letters and arts.
Luciano</p>
<p>Laurana, a Dalmatian, designed it so well that Lorenzo de’ Medici
sent Baccio Pontelli to make drawings of it. A fagade of four stories,
with four superimposed arches in the center and a machicolated tower at
each side; an inner cortile of graceful arcades; rooms now mostly bare
but still reveal- ing, by their irremovable carvings and magnificent
fireplaces, the taste and luxury of the time; this was the center of the
court where Castiglione molded his Courtier. The rooms that most
delighted Federigo were those in which he gathered his library, and
discoursed with the artists, scholars, and poets who enjoyed his
friendship and patronage. He himself was the most widely accomplished
man in the state. He preferred Aristotle to Plato, and knew the Ethics,
Politics, and Physics thoroughly. He put his- tory above philosophy,
doubtless feeling that he could learn more about life by studying the
record of human behavior than by tracing the web of human theory. He
loved the classics without surrendering his Christianity; he read the
Fathers and the Scholastics, and heard Mass every day; in peace as well
as war he was a foil to Sigismondo Malatesta. His library was as well
provided with patristic and medieval literature as with classic works.
For fourteen years he kept thirty copyists transcribing Greek and Latin
manu- scripts, until his library was the fullest in Italy outside the
Vatican. He agreed with his librarian, Vespasiano da Bisticci, that no
printed book should be allowed entry to the collection; for they thought
of a book as a work of art in binding, lettering, and illumination, as
well as a vehicle of ideas; and almost every book in the palace was
carefully handwritten on</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 343</p>
<p>vellum, illustrated with miniatures, and bound in crimson leather
with silver clasps.</p>
<p>Miniature painting was a favorite art at Urbino. The Vatican Library,
which purchased Federigo’s collection, prizes particularly two volumes
of the “Urbino Bible” which the Duke commissioned Vespasiano and others
to illustrate, bidding them, says Vespasiano, to “make this most
excellent of all books as rich and worthy as possible.” 17 To adorn the
palace walls Federigo brought in tapestry weavers and the painters
Justus van Ghent from Flanders, Pedro Berruguete from Spain, Paolo
Uccello from Florence, Piero della Francesca from Borgo San Sepolcro,
and Melozzo da Forli; here Melozzo painted two of his finest pictures
(one now in London, the other in Berlin), showing the cultivation of the
“sciences” (i.e., literature and</p>
<p>Federigo had few enemies, many friends. Pope Sixtus IV made him a
duke (1474), Henry VII of England made him a Knight of the Garter.</p>
<p>When he died (1482) he bequeathed a flourishing principality and an
in- spiring tradition of justice and peace. His son Guidobaldo did his
best to follow in his steps, but disease interfered with his military
pursuits, and left him an invalid through most of his life. In 1488 he
married Elisabetta Gonzaga, sister-in-law of Isabella, Marchioness of
Mantua. Elisabetta too was a frequent invalid, made timid and gentle by
physical weakness. Per- haps she was relieved to find that her husband
was impotent; 19 she was content, she said, to live with him as a
sister; 20 and on that basis they avoided the quarrels of man and wife.
She became his mother rather than his sister, cared for him tenderly,
never deserted him in his tragic tribulations. Her letters to Isabella
are all the more precious because they reveal a delicacy of feeling, a
warmth of family attachment, that are sometimes ignored in moral
appraisals of the Renaissance. When, after a fortnight’s visit at Ur -
bino in 1494, the lively Isabella returned to Mantua, Elisabetta sent
after her this touching note:</p>
<p>Your departure made me feel not only that I had lost a dear
sister,</p>
<p>but that life itself had gone from me. I know not how else to
soften</p>
<p>my grief, except by writing every hour to you, and telling you on</p>
<p>paper all that my lips desire to say. If I could express the sorrow
I</p>
<p>feel, I believe that you would come back out of compassion for
me.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XII</p>
<p>And if I did not fear to vex you, I would follow you myself. But</p>
<p>since both these things are impossible from the respect which I owe
to Your Highness, all I can do is to beg you earnestly to remember</p>
<p>me sometimes, and to know that I bear you always in my heart . 21</p>
<p>One of the questions discussed at the court of Guidobaldo and
Elisabetta was, “After perseverance, what is the best proof of love?”
The answer was, “The sharing of joys and griefs.” 22 The young couple
gave plentiful proof. In November, 1502, Caesar Borgia, after
flourishing protestations of friend- ship for Guidobaldo, suddenly
turned his army up the road to Urbino, claiming that principality as a
fief of the Church. The ladies of Urbino brought to the Duke their
diamonds and pearls, their necklaces, bracelets, and rings, to finance
an impromptu mobilization for defense. But Borgia’s treachery had left
no time for effective resistance; what troops could now be mustered
would be easy victims of the trained and ruthless force that was
advancing; the bloodshed would be useless. Duke and Duchess left their
power and wealth, fled to Citta del Castello and thence to Mantua, where
Isabella received them with loving commiseration. Borgia, fearing that
Guidobaldo would organize an army there, demanded that Isabella and her
Marquis should dismiss the exiles; and to protect Mantua Guidobaldo and
Elisabetta moved on to Venice, whose fearless Senate gave them pro-
tection and sustenance. A few months later Borgia and his father, Alex-
ander VI, were struck down with acute malarial fever in Rome; the Pope
died; Caesar recovered, but his finances collapsed. The people of Urbino
rose against his garrison, drove it from the city, and joyously welcomed
the return of Guidobaldo and Elisabetta (1503). The Duke adopted his
nephew Francesco Maria della Rovere as heir to his throne; and as Fran-
cesco was nephew also to Pope Julius II, the little principality
remained for a decade secure.</p>
<p>In the five ensuing years (1504-8) the court of Urbino became the
cul- tural model and paragon of Italy. Though fond of the classics,
Guidobaldo encouraged the literary use of Italian; and it was at his
court that one of the earliest Italian comedies — Bibbiena’s Calandra —
received its first performance (c. 1508). Sculptors and painters carved
and painted scenery for the occa- sion; the spectators sat on carpets;
an orchestra, hidden behind the stage, provided music; children sang a
prelude; ballets were danced between the acts; at the close a Cupid
recited some verses, viols played a song without words, and a quartet
sang a hymn to love. For though Urbino’s was the most moral court in
Italy, it was also the center of the movement that raised</p>
<p>EMILIA AND THE MARCHES</p>
<p>CHAP. XIl)</p>
<p>woman upon a pedestal, and liked to talk of love — Platonic or
unphilosophi- cal. The leading spirits in the cultural life of the court
were Elisabetta, who had no viable alternative to Platonic love, and
Emilia Pio, who remained to the end of her life the chaste and grieving
widow of Guidobaldo’s brother. A livelier element was contributed to the
circle by Bembo the poet and Bibbiena the dramatist; an esthetic dash by
a famous singer, Bernardino Accolti, called Unico Aretino — “the one and
only Arezzian”— and the sculptor Cristoforo Romano, whom we have met in
Milan. A seasoning of noble blood was provided by Giuliano de’ Medici,
son of Lorenzo;</p>
<p>Ottaviano Fregoso, soon to be Doge of Genoa; his brother Federigo,
des- tined to be a cardinal; Louis of Canossa, soon to be papal nuncio
to France. Others now and then joined the group: high ecclesiastics,
generals, bureau- crats, poets, scholars, artists, philosophers,
musicians, distinguished visitors. This varied company gathered in the
evening in the salon of the Duchess, gossiped, danced, sang, played
games, and conversed. There the art of conversation — the polite and
urbane, serious or humorous consideration of significant matters —
reached its Renaissance peak.</p>
<p>It was this genteel company that Castiglione described and idealized
in one of the most famous books of the Renaissance — // Cortigiano, The
Cour- tier, by which he meant the gentleman. He was himself an exemplary
gentleman: a good son and husband, a man of honor and decency even amid
the dissolute society of Rome, a diplomat esteemed by friend and foe, a
loyal friend who never had an unkind word for anyone, a gentleman in the
best definition as a man always considerate of all. Raphael caught his
inmost character astonishingly well in the superb portrait that hangs in
the Louvre: a wistful meditative face, dark hair and soft blue eyes; too
guileless to be successful in diplomacy except by the sheer charm of his
integrity; clearly a man who would love beauty, in woman and art, in
manners and style, with the sensitiveness of a poet and the
comprehension of a philosopher.</p>
<p>He was the son of Count Cristoforo Castiglione, who held an estate in
the territory of Mantua, and had married a Gonzaga relative of the
Marquis Francesco. At eighteen (1496) he was sent to the court of
Lodovico at Milan, and pleased everyone by his good nature, good
manners, and versa- tile excellence in athletics, letters, music, and
art. When his father died his mother urged him to marry and attend to
the perpetuation of his line; but though Baldassare could write most
elegantly of love, he was too Platonic for matrimony; and he kept his
mother waiting seventeen years before he yielded to her counsel. He
joined the army of Guidobaldo, achieved noth-</p>

<p>ing but a broken ankle, convalesced in the ducal palace at Urbino,
and remained there for eleven years, enamored of the mountain air, the
courtly company, the gracious conversation, and Elisabetta. She was not
beautiful, she was six years older than he, and almost as heavy, but her
gentle spirit captivated Iris’, he kept her picture behind a mirror in
his room, and com- posed secret sonnets in her praise. 23 Guidobaldo
eased the situation by sending him on a mission to England ( 1 506) ;
but Baldassare seized the first excuse to hurry back. The Duke perceived
that there was no harm in him, and graciously consented to form with him
and Elisabetta a Platonic menage h trois. Castiglione stayed on till the
Duke’s death (1508), con - tinued in chaste devotion to the widow, and
remained at Urbino until Leo X deposed the nephew of Guidobaldo and put
upon the ducal throne a nephew of his own (1517).</p>
<p>He returned to his little patrimony near Mantua, and disinterestedly
married Ippolita Torelli, twenty-three years his junior. Then he began
to fall in love with her, first as a child, then as a mother; he
perceived that he had never really known woman, or himself, before, and
the new experi- ence brought him a profound and unprecedented happiness.
But Isabella persuaded him to serve as Mantuan ambassador in Rome; he
went reluc- tantly, leaving his wife behind in the care of his mother.
Soon across the divisive Apennines a tender letter came:</p>
<p>I have given birth to a little girl. I do not think you will be
dis-</p>
<p>appointed. But I have been much worse than before. I have had</p>
<p>three bad spells of fever; I am better now, and I hope it will not
re-</p>
<p>turn. I will write no more, as I am not very well yet, and I
commend</p>
<p>myself to you with all my heart. — From your wife who is a little
ex-</p>
<p>hausted with the pain, from your Ippolita. 24</p>
<p>Ippolita died shortly after writing this letter, and Castiglione’s
love of li fe died with her. He continued to serve Isabella and the
Marquis Federigo in Rome; but even at the polished court of Leo X he
missed not only the peace of his Mantuan home but the integrity,
kindliness, and grace that had made the Urbino circle almost the
embodiment of his ideals.</p>
<p>He had begun in Urbino (1508), he finished in Rome, the book that</p>
<p>carried him down to posterity. Its purpose was to analyze the
conditions that produced, and the conduct that distinguished, a
gentleman. Castiglione imagined that fine company at Urbino discussing
the subject; perhaps he reported, nicely refined, some of the
conversations he had heard there; he used the names of the men and women
who had spoken there, and gave</p>
<p>CHAP. XII ) EMILIA AND THE MARCHES 347</p>
<p>them sentiments agreeing with their characters; so he put into the
mouth of Bembo a paean to Platonic love. He sent the manuscript to
Bembo, ask- ing if the now exalted secretary of the pope had objections
to this use of his name; the genial Bembo had none. Even so the timid
author kept his book unpublished till 1528; then, a year before his
death, he surrendered it to the world only because some friends forced
his hand by circulating copies of it in Rome. Within ten years it was
translated into French; and in 1561 Sir Thomas Hoby made it a quaint and
piquant English classic, which every educated Elizabethan read.</p>
<p>Castiglione was not quite sure, but he inclined to believe that the
first requisite of a gentleman must be gentle birth; i.e., it would be
very difficult for one to acquire good manners, and an easy grace of
body and mind, except by being reared among persons already possessing
these qualities; aristocracy seemed a necessary depository, nursery, and
vehicle of manners, standards, and taste. Secondly, the gentleman must,
early in life, become a good horseman, and learn the arts of war;
enthusiasm for peaceful arts and letters must not be carried to the
point of weakening in the citizens the martial qualities without which a
nation is soon enslaved. Too much war, however, can make a man a brute;
he needs, along with the hardening hardships of soldiering, the refining
influence of women. “No court, how great soever it be, can have any
sightliness or brightness in it, or mirth, without women; nor any
courtier can be gracious, pleasant, or hardie 〔brave〕, nor at any time
undertake any gallant enterprise of chivalrie, unless he be stirred with
the conversation and love … of women.” 23 To wield this civilizing
influence woman must as far as possible be feminine, avoiding all
imitation of the male in carriage, manners, speech, or dress. She must
discipline her body to comeliness, her speech to kindness, her soul to
gentleness; therefore she should learn music, dancing, literature, and
the art of entertaining; in this way she may achieve that inner beauty
of spirit which is the stimulating object and genesis of true love. “The
body, where beauty shineth, is not the fountain whence beauty springeth
. . . because beauty is bodiless.” 26 “Love is nothing else but a
certain coveting to enjoy beauty”; 27 but “whoso thinketh in possessing
the body to enjoy beauty, he is far deceived.” 28 The book ends by
transforming the lusty chivalry of the Middle Ages into that pale
Platonic love which is the last disappoint- ment that a woman will
forgive.</p>
<p>The ideal world of refined culture and mutual consideration that
Casti- glione had conceived collapsed in the brutal sack of Rome (1527).
“Many times,” reads a passage toward the end of his book, “abundance of
wealth</p>
<p>348 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XII</p>
<p>is cause of great destruction, as in poor Italy, which hath been, and
still is, a prey and booty in the teeth of strange nations, as well for
the ill govern- ment as for the abundance of rich es in it.” 29 He could
in some measure reproach himself for the disaster. Clement VII sent him
(1524) as papal nuncio to Madrid to reconcile Charles V to the papacy;
Clement’s own behavior made the mission difficult, and it failed. When
the news reached Spain that the troops of the Emperor had invaded Rome,
imprisoned the Pope, and destroyed half the wealth and grace that Julius
and Leo and a thousand artists had created there, life flowed out of
Baldassare Castiglione as from a severed vein; and at Toledo in 1529,
aged but fifty-one, the gentlest gentleman of the Renaissance passed
away.</p>
<p>His body was taken to Italy, and his mother, “who against her will
sur - vives her son,” raised a tomb to his memory in the church of Santa
Maria delle Grazie outside of Mantua. Giulio Romano designed the
monument, and Bembo composed for it an elegent inscription; but the
finest words engraved on the stone were the verses that Castiglione
himself had com- posed for the grave of his wife, whose remains were
now, in accordance with his will, brought to lie beside his own:</p>
<p>Non ego nunc vivo coniunx dulcissima vitam</p>
<p>corpore namque tuo fata meam abstulerunt,</p>
<p>sed vitam tumulo cum tecum condar in isto,</p>
<p>iungenturque tuis ossibus ossa mea:</p>
<p>“I do not live now, O sweetest spouse, for fate has taken my life
from your body; but I shall live when I am laid in the same tomb with
you, and my bones are joined with yours.” 30</p>
