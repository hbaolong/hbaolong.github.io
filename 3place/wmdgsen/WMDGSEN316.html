<p>Medieval Music</p>
<p>326-1300</p>
<p>I. THE MUSIC OF THE CHURCH</p>
<p>W E have done the cathedral injustice. It was not the cold and empty
tomb that the visitor enters today. It functioned. Its worshipers found
in it not only a work of art but the consoling, strengthening presence
of Mary and her Son. It received the monks or canons who many times each
day stood in the choir stalls and sang the canonical Hours. It heard the
importu- nate litanies of congregations seeking divine mercy and aid.
Its nave and aisles guided the processions that carried before the
people the image of the Virgin or the body and blood of their God. Its
great spaces echoed solemnly with the music of the Mass. And the music
was as vital as the church edifice itself, more deeply stirring than all
the glory of glass or stone. Many a stoic soul, doubtful of the creed,
was melted by the music, and fell on his knees before the mystery that
no words could speak.</p>
<p>The evolution of medieval music concurred remarkably with the
develop- ment of architectural styles. As the early churches passed in
the seventh cen- tury from the ancient domed or basilican forms to a
simple masculine Romanesque, and in the thirteenth century to Gothic
complexity, elevation, and ornament, so Christian music kept till
Gregory I (540-604) the ancient monodic airs of Greece and the Near
East, passed in the seventh century to Gregorian or plain chant, and
flowered in the thirteenth century into poly- phonic audacities rivaling
the balanced strains of a Gothic cathedral.</p>
<p>The barbarian invasions in the West, and the resurgence of
Orientalism in the Near East, combined to break the tradition of Greek
musical notation through letters placed above the words; but the four
Greek “modes”— Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian — survived, and
begot by division the octoechos , or “eight manners” of musical composi
tion — contemplative, re- strained, grave, solemn, cheerful, joyful,
spirited, or ecstatic. The Greek lan- guage persisted for three
centuries after Christ in the church music of the West, and still
remains in the Kyrie eleison. Byzantine music took form un- der
St. Basil, mated Greek and Syrian chants, reached its height in the
hymns of Romanus ( c . 495) and Sergius ( c . 620), and made its
greatest conquest in Russia.</p>
<p>895</p>
<p>896 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>Some early Christians opposed the use of music in religion, but it
soon ap- peared that a religion without music could not survive in
competition with creeds that touched man’s sensitivity to song. The
priest learned to sing the Mass, and inherited some of the melodies of
the Hebrew cantor. Deacons and acolytes were taught to chant responses;
some were technically trained in a schola lectorum, which under Pope
Celestine I (422-32) became a schola cantorum. Such trained singers
formed great choirs; that of St. Sophia’s had 25 cantors and 111
“lectors,” mostly boys. 1 Congregational singing spread from East to
West; the men alternated with the women in antiphonal song, and joined
with them in the Alleluia. The psalms they sang were thought to echo or
imitate on earth the hymns of praise sung before God by the angels and
saints in paradise. St. Ambrose, despite the apostolic counsel that
women should be silent in church, introduced antiphonal singing to his
diocese; “psalms are sweet for every age, and becoming to either sex,”
said this wise administrator; “they create a great bond of unity when
all the people raise their voices in one choir.” 2 Augustine wept when
he heard the Milan con - gregation singing Ambrose’s hymns, and verified
St. Basil’s dictum that the listener who surrenders to the pleasure of
music will be drawn to religious emotion and piety. 3 The “Ambrosian
chant” is still used in Milan churches today.</p>
<p>A tradition universally accepted in the Middle Ages, and now, after
long doubts, generally received, 4 ascribes to Gregory the Great and his
aides a re- form and canonical determination of Roman Catholic music,
resulting in the establishment of the “Gregorian chant” as the official
music of the Church for six centuries. Hellenistic and Byzantine strains
combined with Hebrew melodies of Temple or synagogue to mold this Roman
or plain chant. It was monodic — one song — music; no matter how many
voices participated, they</p>
<p>Before the eleventh century the only musical notation used by the
Gre- gorian chant consisted of small signs derived from the Greek accent
marks, and placed over the words to be sung. These “neumes” (airs,
breaths) indi - cated a rise or fall of tone, but not the degree of rise
or fall, nor the duration of the note; such matters had to be learned by
oral transmission and the memorizing of an enormous body of liturgical
song. No instrumental ac- companiment was allowed. Despite these
limitations — perhaps because of them — Gregorian chant became the most
impressive feature of the Christian ritual. The modern ear, accustomed
to complex harmony, finds these old chants monotonous and thin;. they
carry on a Greek, Syrian, Hebrew, Arab</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIl)</p>
<p>MEDIEVAL MUSIC</p>
<p>897</p>
<p>tradition of monody which only the Oriental ear can appreciate today.
Even so, the chants sung in a Roman Catholic cathedral during Holy Week
reach to the heart with a directness and weird power withheld from music
whose complications divert the ear instead of moving the soul.</p>
<p>Gregorian chant spread through Western Europe like another conversion
to Christianity. Milan rejected it, as it likewise resisted papal
authority; and southern Spain long preserved its “Mozarabic” chant,
formed by Ch ristians under Moslem rule, and still used in a part of
Toledo Cathedral. Charle- magne, who loved unity like a ruler, replaced
the Gallican with the Gre- gorian chant in Gaul, and established schools
of Roman church music at Metz and Soissons. The Germans, however, with
throats formed by climate and needs quite different from the Italian,
had trouble with the more deli- cate strains of the chant. Said John the
Deacon: “Their coarse voices, which roar like thunder, cannot execute
soft modulations, because their throats are hoarse with too much
drinking.” 5</p>
<p>Perhaps the Germans deprecated the fioritura that from the eighth
century forward embellished the Gregorian chant with “tropes” and
“sequences.” The trope or turn began as a composition of words for a
melisma, making this easier to remember. Later it became an
interpolation of words and music into a Gregorian chant, as when the
priest sang not Kyrie eleison but Kyrie ( fons pietatis, a quo bona
cuncta procedunt) eleison. The Church permitted such embellishments, but
never accepted them into the official liturgy. Bored monks amused
themselves by composing or singing such interpolations, until there were
so many tropes that books known as “tropers” were published to teach or
preserve the favored ones. The music of the ecclesiastical drama grew
out of such tropes. Sequences were tropes designed to follow the Alle-
luia of the Mass. The custom had grown of prolonging the final vowel of
this word in a long melody known as a iubilus or chant of joy; in the
eighth century various texts were written for these inserted melodies.
The composi- tion of tropes and sequences became a highly developed art,
and gradually changed Gregorian chant into an ornate form uncongenial to
its original spirit a nd “plain” intent.* This evolution ended the
purity and dominance of Gregorian chant in that same twelfth century
which saw the transition from Romanesque to Gothic in the architecture
of the West.</p>
<p>The multiplication of complex compositions demanded for their
transmis- sion a better notation than that which plain chant had used.
In the tenth cen- tury Odo, Abbot of Cluny, and Notker Balbulus, a monk
of St. Gall, resur- rected the Greek device of naming notes by letters.
In the eleventh century an anonymous writer described the use of the
first seven capitals of the Latin</p>

<p>(chap. XXXIII</p>
<p>alphabet for the first octave of a scale, the corresponding
lower-case Latin letters for the second octave, and Greek letters for
the third.® About 1040 Guido of Arezzo, a monk of Pomposa (near
Ferrara), gave their present strange names to the first six notes of the
scale by taking the first syllables of each half-line of a hymn to John
the Baptist:</p>
<p>Ut queant laxis resonate floris</p>
<p>Mira gestorum famuli tuorum,</p>
<p>Solve polluti labii reatum.</p>
<p>This “solmization,” or naming of the musical tones by the syllables
ut (or do), re, mi, fa, sol, la, became part of the inexorable heritage
of Western youth.</p>
<p>More vital was Guid o’s development of a musical staff. About 1000
the practice had arisen of using a red line to indicate the note now
represented by F ; later a second line, yellow or green, was added to
represent C. Guido, or someone shortly before him, extended these lines
to make a staff of four lines, to which later teachers added a fifth.
With this new staff and the ut, re, mi, wrote Guido, his choir boys
could learn in a few days what formerly had taken them many weeks. It
was a simple but epochal advance, which earned for Guido the title of
inventor musicae, and a splendid statue still to be seen in Arezzo’s
public square. The results were revolutionary. Singers were free from
the task of memorizing the whole musical liturgy; music could be more
readily composed, transmitted, and preserved; the performer could now
read music at sight and hear it with the eye; and the composer, no
longer bound to keep close to traditional melodies lest singers refuse
to mem- orize his work, could venture upon a thousand experiments. Most
important of all, he could now write polyphonic music, in which two or
more voices could simultaneously sing or play different but harmonizing
strains.</p>
<p>We owe to our medieval forebears still another invention that made
mod- ern music possible. Tones could now be determined by dots placed on
or between the lines of the staff, but these signs gave no hint as to
how long a note was to be held. Some system for measuring and denoting
the duration of each note was indispensable to the development of
contrapuntal music — the simultaneous and harmonious procedure of two or
more independent melo- dies. Perhaps some knowledge had seeped up from
Spain of Arab treatises by al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Avicenna, and other
Moslems who had dealt with meas- ured music or mensural notation. 7 At
some time in the eleventh century 8 Franco of Cologne, a priest
mathematician, wrote a treatise Ars cantus mensurabilis, in which he
gathered up the suggestions of earlier theory and practice, and laid
down essentially our present system for indicating the duration of
musical notes. A square-headed virga or rod, formerly used as a neume,
was chosen to represent a long note; another neume, the punctum or
point, was enlarged into a lozenge to represent a short note; these
signs were</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIIIj MEDIEVAL MUSIC 899</p>
<p>in time altered; tails were added; by trial and error, through a
hundred ab- surdities, our simple mensural notation was evolved.</p>
<p>These vital developments opened a wide door to polyphonic music. Such
music had been written before Franco, but crudely. Toward the close of
the ninth century we find a musical practice called “organizing”— the
singing of concords by concurring voices. Little is heard of it again
till the end of the tenth century, when we find the names organum and
symphonia applied to such compositions for two voices. The organum was a
liturgical piece, in which an old monodic strain was carried or “held”
by the tenor (who was therefore so named), while another voice added a
harmonizing melody. A variant of this form, the conductus, gave the
tenor a new or popular tune, and conducted another voice in a concurrent
air. In the eleventh century the composers took a step as bold in its
way as the Gothic balancing of thrusts: they wrote harmonies in which
the “conducted” voice did not slavishly ac - company the tenor in the
rise or fall of the melody, but ventured upon other harmonies through
notes not necessarily moving in a parallel line with the cantus firmus
of the tenor. This declaration of independence became almost a rebellion
when the second voice accompanied the ascending melody of the tenor with
a descending movement. This harmony by contrast, and fluent resolution
of momentary discords, became a passion with composers, almost a law;
so, about 1 100, John Cotton wrote: “If the main voice is ascending, the
accompanying part shall descend.” 9 Finally, in the motet (apparently a
diminutive from the French mot, a word or phrase), three, four, five,
even six different voices were made to sing in a complex weave of
individual melo- dies whose diverse but concordant strains crossed and
merged in a vertical- horizontal web of harmony as subtle and graceful
as the converging arches of a Gothic vault. By the thirteenth century
this Ars antiqua of polyphony had built the foundations of modern
musical composition.</p>
<p>In that exciting century the enthusiasm for music rivaled the
interest in architecture and philosophy. The Church looked askance upon
polyphony; she distrusted the religious effect of music becoming a lure
and end in itself; John of Salisbury, bishop and philosopher, called a
halt to complexity of composition; Bishop Guillaume Durand branded the
motet as “disorganized music”; Roger Bacon, a rebel in science, d
eplored the vanishing of the stately Gregorian chant. The Council of
Lyons (1274) denounced the new music; and Pope John XXII (1324) issued a
papal condemnation of discantus, or polyphony, on the ground that the
innovating composers “chop up the melo - dies … so that these rush
around ceaselessly, intoxicating the ear without quieting it, and
disturbing devotion instead of evoking it.” 10 But the revo - lution
continued. In one citadel of the Church — Notre Dame de Paris — the
choirmaster Leoninus, about 1180, composed the finest organa of his
time; and his successor Perotinus was guilty of compositions for three
or four voices. Polyphony, like Gothic, spread from France to England
and Spain.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>900</p>
<p>(chap. XXXIII</p>
<p>Giraldus Cambrensis (1146?-! 2 20) reported two-part singing in
Iceland, and said of his native Wales what one might say of it
today:</p>
<p>In their songs they do not utter the tunes uniformly . . . but
mani-</p>
<p>foldly — in many manners and many notes; so that in a multitude of
singers, such as it is the custom of this people to bring together,
as</p>
<p>many songs are to be heard as there are singers to be seen, and a
vari- ous diversity of parts, finally coming together in one consonance
and organic melody. 11</p>
<p>In the end the Church bowed to the infallibility of the Zeitgeist ,
accepted polyphony, made it a powerful servant of the faith, and
prepared it for its Renaissance victories.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MUSIC OF THE PEOPLE</li>
</ol>
<p>The impulse to rhythm expressed itself in a hundred forms of secular
mu- sic and dance. The Church had her reasons for fearing this instinct
uncon- trolled; it allied itself naturally with love, the great rival of
religion as a source of song; and the hearty earthiness of the medieval
mind, when the priest was out of sight, inclined it to a freedom,
sometimes an obscenity, of text that shocked the clergy, and provoked
councils to vain decrees. The goliards, or wandering scholars, found or
composed music for their paeans to woman and wine, and their scandalous
parodies of sacred ritual; manuscripts circulated containing solemn
music for the hilarious words of the Miss a de potatoribus — the Mass of
the Topers — and the Offlcium ribaldorum — z Prayer Book for Roisterers.
12 Love songs were as popular as today. Some were as tender as a nymph’s
orisons; some were seduction dialogues with delicate accompani - ments.
And of course there were war songs, calculated to forge unity through
vocal unison, or to anesthetize the pursuit of glory with hypnotic
rhythm. Some music was folk song, composed by anonymous genius, and
appropri- ated — perhaps transformed — by the people. Other popular
music was the product of professional skill using all the arts of
polyphony learned in the liturgy of the Church. In England a favorite
and complex form was the roundel, in which one voice began a melody, a
second began the same or a harmonizing melody when the first had reached
an agreed point, a third chimed in after the second was on its way, and
so on, until as many as six voices might be running the rounds in a
lively contrapuntal fugue.</p>
<p>Almost the oldest roundel known is the famous “Sumer is i - cumen
in,” probably composed by a Reading monk about 1240. Its six-part
complexity shows polyphony already at home among the people. The words
still live with the spirit of a century in which all medieval
civilization was coming to flower:</p>

<p>Sing cuccu, sing cuccu, nu! Sing cuckoo now, sing cuckoo,</p>
<p>Sing cuckoo, sing cuckoo, now!</p>
<p>Such a song must have been congenial to the minstrels or jongleurs
who wandered from town to town, from court to court, even from land to
land; we hear of minstrels from Constantinople singing in France, of
English glee- men singing in Spain. A performance by minstrels was a
usual part of any formal festivity; so Edward I of England engaged 426
singers for the wed- ding of his daughter Margaret. 13 Such minstrel
groups often sang part songs, sometimes of bizarre complexity. Usually
the songs were composed — words and music — by troubadours in France,
trovatori in Italy, minnesingers in Germany. Most medieval poetry before
the thirteenth century was written to be sung; “a poem without music,”
said the troubadour Folquet, “is a mill without water.” 14 Of 2600
troubadour songs extant, we have the music of 264, usually in the form
of neumes and ligatures on a four- or five-line staff. The bards of
Ireland and Wales probably played instruments, and sang.</p>
<p>In the manuscripts that preserve the Cantigas or canticles collected
by Alfonso X of Castile several illustrations show musicians in Arab
dress per- forming on Arab instruments; the pattern of many of the songs
is Arabic; 15 possibly the music, as well as the early themes and poetic
forms, of the trouba- dours was derived from Moorish songs and melodies
passing through Chris- tian Spain into Southern France. 10 Returning
Crusaders may have brought Arab musical forms from the East; it is to be
noted that the troubadours ap- pear about 1 100, contemporary with the
First Crusade.</p>
<p>Startling is the variety of medieval musical instruments. Percussion
instru- ments — bells, cymbals, timbrels, the triangle, the bombulum,
the drum; string instruments — lyre, cithera, harp, psaltery, noble,
organistrum, lute, guitar, vielle, viola, monochord, gigue; wind
instruments — pipe, flute, hautboy, bag- pipe, clarion, flageolet,
trumpet, horn, organ: these are a selection out of hundreds; everything
was there for hand or finger, foot or bow. Some of</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXIII</p>
<p>them had survived from Greece, some had come, in form and name, from
Islam, like the rebec, lute, and guitar; many were precious examples of
me- dieval artistry in metal, ivory, or wood. The usual instrument of
the minstrel was the vielle, a short violin played with an archer’s
curved -back bow. Be- fore the eighth century most organs were
hydraulic; but Jerome in the fourth century described a pneumatic organ;
17 and Bede (673-735) wrote of or- gans with “brass pipes filled with
air from bellows, and uttering a grand and most sweet melody.” 18
St. Dunstan ( c . 925 -88) was accused of sorcery when he built an
Aeolian harp that played when placed against a crack in the wall. 19 In
Winchester Cathedral, about 950, an organ was installed having
twenty-six bellows, forty-two bellows-blowers, and four hundred pipes;
the keys were so Gargantuan that the organist had to strike them with
fists pro- tected by thickly padded gloves. 20 Milan had an organ whose
pipes were of silver; Venice had one with pipes of gold. 21</p>
<p>All notion of medieval hell-stricken gloom vanishes before a
