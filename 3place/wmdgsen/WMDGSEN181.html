<p>325-529</p>
<p>I. BRITAIN BECOMES ENGLAND: 325-577</p>
<p>U NDER Roman rule every class in Britain flourished except the
peasant proprietors. The large estates grew at the expense of small
holdings; the free peasant was in many cases bought out, and became a
tenant farmer, or a proletarian in the towns. Many peasants supported
the Anglo-Saxon invaders against the landed aristocracy. 1 Otherwise,
Roman Britain pros- pered. Cities multiplied and grew, wealth mounted; 2
many homes had cen- tral heating and glass windows; 3 many magnates had
luxurious villas. British weavers already exported those excellent
woolens in which they still lead the world. A few Roman legions, in the
third century, sufficed to maintain exter- nal security and internal
pegpe.</p>
<p>But in the fourth and fifth centuries security was threatened on
every front: on the north by the Piets of Caledonia; on the east and
south by Norse and Saxon raiders; on the west by the unsubdued Celts of
Wales and the adventurous Gaels and “Scots” of Ireland. In 364 - 7
“Scot” and Saxon coastal raids increased alarmingly; British and Gallic
troops repelled them, but Stilicho had to repeat the process a
generation later. In 381 Maximus, in 407 the usurper Constantine, took
from Britain, for their personal purposes, legions needed for home
defense, and few of these men returned. Invaders began to pour over the
frontiers; Britain appealed to Stilicho for help (400) , but he was
fully occupied in driving Goths and Huns from Italy and Gaul. When a
further appeal was made to the Emperor Honorius he answered that the
British must help themselves as best they could. 4 “In the year 409,”
says Bede, “the Romans ceased to rule in Britain.” 5</p>
<p>Faced with a large-scale invasion of Piets, the British leader
Vortigern invited some North German tribes to come to his help. 6 Saxons
came from the region of the Elbe, Angles from Schleswig, Jutes from
Jutland. Tradition — perhaps legend — reports that the Jutes arrived in
449 under the command of two brothers suspiciously named Hengist and
Horsa — i.e., stallion and mare. The vigorous Germans drove back the
Piets and “Scots,” received tracts of land as reward, noted the military
weakness of Britain, and sent the joyful word to their fellows at home.
7 Uninvited German hordes landed on Britain’s shores; they were resisted
with more courage than skill; they alter -</p>

<p>nately advanced and retired through a century of guerrilla war;
finally the Teutons defeated the British atDeorham (577), and made
themselves masters of what would later be called Angle-land — England.
Most Britons thereafter</p>
<p>If we would feel the fever of those bitter days we must turn from
history to the legends of Arthur and his knights, and their mighty blows
to “break the heathen and uphold the Christ.” St. Gildas, a Welsh monk,
in a strange</p>
<p>when Vortimer [Vortigern’ s brother] died, the strength of the</p>
<p>Britons decayed, and they would soon have perished altogether had not
Ambrosius, the sole survivor of the Romans,… quelled the pre- sumptuous
barbarians with the powerful aid of the warlike Arthur.</p>
<p>Arthur long upheld the sinking state, and roused the broken
spirit</p>
<p>of his countrymen to war. Finally, at Mt. Badon, relying on an</p>
<p>image of the Virgin which he had affixed to his armor, he engaged</p>
<p>900 of the enemy single-handed, and dispersed them with incredible
slaughter. 10</p>
<p>Let us agree that it is incredible. We must be content with accepting
Arthur as in essentials a vague but historical figure of the sixth
century, probably not a saint, probably not a king. 11 The rest we must
resign to Chretien of Troyes, the delectable Malory, and the chaste
Tennyson.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>IRELAND: 160-529</li>
</ol>
<p>The Irish believe — and we cannot gainsay them — that their island of
“mists and mellow fruitfulness” was first peopled by Greeks and Scythian
s a thou- sand or more years before Christ, and that their early
chieftains — Cuchalain, Conor, Conall — were sons of God. 12 Himilco,
the Phoenician explorer, touched Ireland about 510 b.c., and described
it as “populous and fertile.” 13 Perhaps in the fifth century before
Christ some Celtic adventurers from Gaul or Britain or both crossed into
Ireland, and conquered the natives, of whom we know nothing. The Celts
apparently brought with them the iron culture of Hallstatt, and a strong
kinship organization that made the individual too proud of his clan to
let him form a stable state. Clan fought clan, kingdom fought kingdom,
for a thousand years; between such wars the members of a clan fought one
another; and when they died, good Irishmen, before St. Patrick came,
were buried upright ready for battle, with faces turned toward their
foes. 14 Most of the kings died in battle, or by assassination. 15
Perhaps out of eugenic obligation, perhaps as vicars of gods who
required first fruits, these ancient kings, according to Irish
tradition, had the right to deflower every bride before yielding her to
her husband. King Conchobar was praised for his especial devotion to
this duty. 10 Each clan kept a record of its mem- bers and their
genealogy, its king s and battles and antiquities, “from the beginning
of the world.” 17</p>
<p>The Celts established themselves as a ruling class, and distributed
their clans in five kingdoms: Ulster, North Leinster, South Leinster,
Munster, Connaught. Each of the five kings was sovereign, but all the
clans accepted Tara, in Meath, as the national capital. There each king
was crowned; and there, at the outset of his reign, he convened the Feis
or convention of the notables of all Ireland to pass legislation binding
on all the kingdoms, to cor- rect and record the clan genealogies, and
to register these in the national archives. To house this assembly King
Cormac mac Airt, in the third century, built a great hall, whose
foundations can still be seen. A provincial council — the Aonach, or
Fair — met annually or triennially in the capital of each king- dom,
legislated for its area, imposed taxes, and served as a district court.
Games and contests followed these conventions: music, song, jugglery,
farces, story-telling, poetry recitals, and many marriages brightened
the occasion, and a large part of the population shared in the
festivity. From this distance, which lends enchantment to the view, such
a reconciliation of central government and local freedom seems almost
ideal. The Feis continued till 560; the Aonach till 1 168.</p>
<p>The first character whom we may confidently count as historical is
Tua- thal, who ruled Leinster and Meath about a.d. 160. King Niall
(c. 358) invaded Wales and carried off immense booty, raided Gaul, and
was killed</p>
<p>CHAP. IV) EUROPE TAKES FORM 83</p>
<p>(by an Irishman) on the river Loire; from him descended most of the
later Irish kings (O’Neills). In the fifth year of the reign of his son
Laeghaire</p>
<p>Christianity had come to Ireland a generation or more before Patrick.
An old chronicle, confirmed by Be de, writes, under the year 43 1 :
“Palladius is ordained by Pope Celestine, and is sent as their first
bishop to the Irish be- lievers in Christ.” 20 Palladius, however, died
within the year; and the honor of making Ireland unalterably Catholic
fell to her patron saint.</p>
<p>He was born in the village of Bonnaventa in western England, of a
middle class family, about 389. As the son of a Roman citizen, he was
given a Roman name, Patricius. He received only a modest education, and
apologized for his rusticitas-, but he studied the Bible so faithfully
that he could quote it from memory to almost any purpose. At sixteen he
was captured by “Scot” (Irish) raiders and taken to Ireland, where for
six years he served as a herder of pigs. 21 In those lonely hour s
“conversion” came to him; he passed from re - ligious indifference to
intense piety; he describes himself as rising every day before dawn to
go out and pray in whatever weather — hail or rain or snow. At last he
escaped, found his way to the sea, was picked up, desolate, by sailors,
and was carried to Gaul, perhaps to Italy. He worked his way back to
England, rejoined his parents, and lived with them a few years. But
some- thing called him back to Ireland — perhaps some memory of its
rural loveliness, or the hearty kindliness of its people. He interpreted
the feeling as a divine message, a call to convert the Irish to
Christianity. He went to Lerins and Auxerre, studied for the priesthood,
and was ordained. When news reached</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>Auxerre that Palladius was dead, Patrick was made a bishop, dowered
with relics of Peter and Paul, and sent to Ireland (43 2 ).</p>
<p>He found there, on the throne of Tara, an enlightened pagan,
Laeghaire. Patrick failed to convert the king, but won full freedom for
his mission. The Druids opposed him, and showed the people their magic;
Patrick met them with the formulas of the exorcists — a minor clerical
order — whom he had brought with him to cast out demons. In the
Concessions that he wrote in his old age Patrick tells of the perils he
encountered in his work: twelve times his life was in danger; once he
and his companions were seized, held captive a fortnight, and threatened
with death; but some friends persuaded the captors to set them free. 22
Pious tradition tells a hundred fascinating stories of his miracles: “he
gave sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf,” says Nennius, 23
“cleansed the lepers, cast out devils, redeemed captives, raised nine
persons from the dead, and w rote 365 books.” But probably it was
Patrick’s character, rather than his wonders, that converted the Irish —
the undoubting confidence of his belief, and the passionate persistence
of his work. He was not a patient man; he could dispense maledictions
and benedictions with equal readiness; 24 but even this proud dogmatism
convinced. He ordained priests, built churches, established monasteries
and nunneries, and left strong spiritual garrisons to guard his
conquests at every turn. He made it seem a supreme adventure to enter
the ecclesiastical state; he gathered about him men and women of courage
and devotion, who endured every privation to spread the good news that
man was redeemed. He did not convert all Ire- land; some pockets of
paganism and its poetry survived, and leave traces to this day; but when
he died (461) it could be said of him, as of no other, that one man had
converted a nation.</p>
<p>Only second to him in the affection of the Irish people stands the
woman who did most to consolidate his victory. St. Brigid, we are told,
was the daughter of a slave and a king; but we know nothing definite of
her before 476, when she took the veil. Overcoming countless obstacles,
she founded the “Church of the Oak Tree”— Cill-dara — at a spot still so
named, Kildare; soon it developed into a monastery, a nunnery, and a
school as famous as that which grew at Patrick’s Armagh. She died about
525, honored through - out the island; and 10,000 Irish women still bear
the name of the “Mary of the Gael.” A ge neration later St. Ruadhan laid
a curse upon Tara; sifter 558, when King Diarmuid died, the ancient
halls were abandoned, and Ireland’s kings, still pagan in culture,
became Christian in creed.</p>

<li>The Last Days of Classic Gaul: 310-480</li>
</ol>
<p>Gaul, in the fourth and fifth centuries, was materially the most
prosperous, intellectually the most advanced, of Roman provinces in the
West. The soil was generous, the crafts were skilled, the rivers and the
seas bore a teeming trade. State-supported universities flourished at
Narbonne, Arles, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lyons, Marseille, Poitiers, and
Trier; teachers and orators, poets and sages enjoyed a status and
acclaim usually reserved for politicians and pugilists. With Ausonius
and Sidonius, Gaul took over the literary leadership of Europe.</p>
<p>Decimus Magnus Ausonius was the poet and embodiment of this Gallic
Silver Age. He was born at Bordeaux about 310, son of its leading
physician. He received his education there, and later told the world, in
generous hex- ameters, the virtues of his teachers, remembering their
smiles and forgetting their blows. 25 In the even tenor of his years he
too became a professor at Bordeaux, taught “grammar” (i.e., literature)
and “rhetoric” (i.e., oratory and philosophy) for a generation, and
tutored the future Emperor Gratian. The sincere affection with which he
writes of his parents, uncles, wife, chil- dren, and pupils suggests a
home and a life like that of a nineteenth-century university town in the
United States. He describes pleasantly the house and fields that he
inherited from his father, and where he hopes to spend his declining
years. He says to his wife, in the early years of their marriage: “Let
us live always as we live now, and let us not abandon the names that we
have given each other in our first love…. You and I must always remain
young, and you shall always be beautiful to me. We must keep no count of
the years.” 26 Soon, however, they lost the first child that she gave
him. Years later he commemorated it lovingly: “I will not leave you
unwept, my first - born child, called by my name. Just as you were
practicing to change your babbling into the first words of childhood… we
had to mourn your death. You lie on your great- grandfather’s bosom,
sharing his grave.” 27 His wife died early in their happy marriage,
after giving him a daughter and a son. He was so deeply bound to her
that he never married again; and in his old age he described with fresh
grief the pain of his loss, and the somber silence of the house that had
known the care of her hands and the cadence of her His poems pleased his
time by their tender sentiment, their rural pictures, the purity of
their Latin, the almost Virgilian smoothness of their verse. Paulinus,
the future saint, compared his prose with Cicero’s, and Symmachus could
not find in Virgil anything lovelier than Ausonius’ Mosella. The poet
had grown fond of that river while with Gratian at Trier; he describes
it as</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>running through a very Eden of vineyards, orchards, villas, and
prospering farms; for a time he makes us feel the verdure of its banks
and the music of its flow; then, with all-embracing bathos, he indites a
litany to the amiable fish to be found in the stream. This Whitmanesque
passion for cataloguing rela- tives, teachers, pupils, fish is not
redeemed by Whitman’s omnivorous feeling and lusty philosophy; Ausonius,
after thirty years of grammar, could hardly burn with more than literary
passions. His poems are rosaries of friendship, litanies of praise; but
those of us who have not known such alluring uncles or seductive
professors are rarely exalted by these doxologies.</p>
<p>When Valentinian I died (375), Gratian, now Emperor, called his old
tutor to him, and showered him and his with political plums. In quick
suc- cession Ausonius was prefect of Illyricum, Italy, Africa, Gaul;
finally, at sixty-nine, consul. At his urging, Gratian decreed state aid
for education, for poets and physicians, and for the protection of
ancient art. Through his in- fluence Symmachus was made prefect of Rome,
and Paulinus a provincial governor. Ausonius mourned when Paulinus
became a saint; the Empire, threatened everywhere, needed such men.
Ausonius too was a Christian, but not too seriously; his tastes,
subjects, meters, and mythology were blithely pagan.</p>
<p>At seventy the old poet returned to Bordeaux, to live another twenty
years. He was now a grandfather, and could match the filial poems of his
youth with the grandparental fondness of age. “Be not afraid,” he
counsels his grandson, “though the school resound with many a stroke,
and the old master wears a scowling face; let no outcry, or sound of
stripes, make you quake as the morning hours move on. That he brandishes
the cane for a scep- ter, that he has a full outfit of birches… is but
the outward show to cause idle fears. Your father and mother went
through all this in their day, and have lived to soothe my peaceful and
serene old age.” 28 Fortunate Ausonius, to have lived and died before
the barbarian flood!</p>
<p>Apollinaris Sidonius was to Gallic prose in the fifth century what
Ausonius had been to Gallic poetry in the fourth. He burst upon the
world at Lyons (432), where his father was prefect of Gaul. His
grandfather had filled the same office, and his mother was a relative of
that Avitus who would become emperor in 455, and whose daughter Sidonius
would marry in 452. It would have been difficult to improve upon these
arrangements. Papianilla brought him as dowry a luxurious villa near
Clermont. His life for some years was a round of visits to and from his
aristocratic friends. They were people of culture and refinement, with a
flair for gambling and idleness; 29 they lived in their country houses,
and seldom soiled their hands with politics; they were quite incapable
of protecting their luxurious ease against the invading Goths. They did
not care for city life; already French and British wealth was pre-
ferring the country to the town. In these sprawling villas — some with
125</p>
<p>EUROPE TAKES FORM</p>
<p>CHAP, iv)</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>rooms — all comforts and elegances were gathered: mosaic floors,
columned halls, landscape murals, sculptures in marble and bronze, great
fireplaces and baths, gardens and tennis courts, 30 and environing woods
in which ladies and gentlemen might hunt with all the glamour of
falconry. Nearly every villa bad a good library, containing the classics
of pagan antiquity and some re- spectable Christian texts. 31 Several of
Sidonius’ friends were book collectors; and doubtless there were in
Gaul, as in Rome, rich men who valued good bindings above mere contents,
and were satisfied with the culture they could get from the covers of
their books.</p>
<p>Sidonius illustrates the better side of this genteel life —
hospitality, courtesy, good cheer, moral decency, with a touch of
chiseled poetry and melodious prose. When Avitus went to Rome to be
emperor, Sidonius accompanied him, and was chosen to deliver the
welcoming panegyric (456). He returned to Gaul a year later with Avitus
deposed; but in 468 we find him in Rome again, holding the high office
of prefect of the city amid the last convulsions of the state. Moving
comfortably through the chaos, he described the high society of Gaul and
Rome in letters modeled upon those of Pliny and Sym- machus, and
matching them in vanity and grace. Literature now had little to say, and
said it with such care that nothing remained but form and charm. At
their best there is in these letters that genial tolerance and
sympathetic understanding of the educated gentleman which has adorned
the literature of France since the days when it was not yet French.
Sidonius brought into Gaul the Roman love for gracious causeries. From
Cicero and Seneca through Pliny, Symmachus, Macrobius, and Sidonius to
Montaigne, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Renan, Sainte-Beuve, and Anatole
France is one line, almost, by bountiful avatars, one mind.</p>
<p>Lest we misrepresent Sidonius we must add that he was a good
Christian and a brave bishop. In 469, unexpectedly and unwillingly, he
found himself precipitated from lay status to the episcopacy of
Clermont. A bishop in those days had to be a civil administrator as well
as a spiritual guide; and men of experience and wealth like Ambrose and
Sidonius had qualifications that proved more effective than theological
erudition. Having little of such learn- ing, Sidonius had few anathemas
to bestow; instead, he gave his silver plate to the poor, and forgave
sins with an alarming readiness. From one of his letters we perceive
that the prayers of his flock were sometimes interrupted by
refreshments. 32 Reality broke into this pleasant life when Euric, King
of the Visigoths, decided to annex Auvergne. Each summer, for four
years, the Goths laid siege to Clermont, its capital. Sidonius fought
them with diplomacy and prayer, but failed; when at last the city fell
he was taken captive, and was imprisoned in a fortress near Carcassonne
(475). Two years later he was released and restored to his see. How long
he survived we do not know; but already at forty- five he wished to be
“delivered from the pains and burdens of present life by a holy death.”
33 He had lost fait h in the</p>

<p>With the death of Sidonius the night of barbarism closed down upon
Gaul. We must not exaggerate that darkness. Men still retained economic
skills, traded goods, minted coinage, composed poetry, and practiced
art; and under Euric (466-84) and Alaric II (484-507) the Visigothic
kingdom in southwestern Gaul was sufficiently orderly, civilized, and
progressive to draw praise from Sidonius himself. 34 In 506 Alaric II
issued a Breviarium, or summary, of laws for his realm; it was a
comparatively enlightened code, reducing to rule and reason the
relations between the Romano-Gallic popu- lation and its conquerors. A
like code was enacted (510) by the Burgundian kings who had peaceably
established their people and power in southeastern Gaul. Until the
revival of Roman law at Bologna in the eleventh century, Latin Europe
would be governed by Gothic and Burgundian codes, and the kindred laws
of the Franks.</p>
<p>History picks up the Franks in 240, when the Emperor Aurelian
defeated them near Mainz. The Ripuarian Franks — “of the bank”— settled
early in the fifth century on the west slopes of the Rhine; they
captured Cologne (463), made it their capital, and extended their power
in the Rhine valley from Aachen to Metz. Some Frank tribes remained on
the east side of the river, and gave their name to Franconia. The Salic
Franks may have taken their distinguishing name from the river Sala (now
Ijssel) in the Netherlands. Thence they moved south and west, and about
356 occupied the region be- tween the Meuse, the ocean, and the Somme.
For the most part their spread was by peaceful migration, sometimes by
Roman invitation to settle sparsely occupied lands; by these diverse
ways northern Gaul had become half Frank by 430. They brought their
Germanic language and pagan faith with them; so that during the fifth
century Latin ceased to be the speech, and Christianity the religion, of
the peoples along the lower Rhine.</p>
<p>The Salic Franks described themselves, in the prologue to their
“Salic Law,” as “the glorious people, wise in council, noble in body,
radiant in health, excelling in beauty, daring, quick, hardened… this is
the people that shook the cruel yoke of the Romans from its neck.” 33
They considered themselves not barbarians but self-liberated freemen;
Frank meant free, enfranchised. They were tall and fair; knotted their
long hair in a tuft on the head, and let it fall thence like a horse’s
tail; wore mustaches but no beards; bound their tunics at the waist with
leather belts covered with segments of enameled iron; from this belt
hung sword and battle-ax, and articles of toilet like scissors and
combs. 30 The men, as well as the women, were fond of</p>
<p>EUROPE TAKES FORM</p>
<p>CHAP, iv)</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>jewelry, and wore rings, armlets, and beads. Every able-bodied male
was a warrior, taught from youth to run, leap, swim, and throw his lance
or ax to its mark. Courage was the supreme virtue, for which murder,
rapine, and rape might be readily forgiven. But history, by telescoping
one dramatic event into the next, leaves a false impression of the
Franks as merely warriors. Their conquests and battles were no more
numerous, and far less extensive and destructive, than our own. Their
laws show them engaged in agriculture and handicrafts, making
northeastern Gaul a prosperous and usually peaceful rural society.</p>
<p>The Salic Law was formulated early in the sixth century, probably in
the same generation that saw Justinian’s full development of Roman law.
We are told that “four venerable chieftains” wrote it, and that it was
exami ned and approved by three successive assemblies of the people. 37
Trial was largely by “compurgation” and ordeal. A sufficient number of
qualified witnesses attesting the good character of a defendant cleared
him of any charge of which he was not evidently guilty. The number of
witnesses required varied with the enormity of the- alleged crime:
seventy-two could free a supposed murderer, but when the chastity of a
queen of France was in question, three hundred nobles were needed to
certify the paternity of her child. 38 If the matter at issue still
stood in doubt, the law of ordeal was invoked. The ac- cused, bound hand
and foot, might be flung into a river, to sink if innocent, to float if
guilty (for the water, having been exorcised by religious ceremony,
would reject a sinful person) ; 39 or the accused would be made to walk
bare- foot through fire or over red-hot irons; or to hold a red-hot iron
in his hand for a given time; or to plunge a bare arm into boiling water
and pluck out an object from the bottom. Or accuser and accused would
stand with arms out- stretched in the form of a cross, until one or the
other proclaimed his guilt by letting his arm fall with fatigue; or the
accused would take the consecrated wafer of the Eucharist and, if
guilty, would surely be struck down by God; or trial by combat would
decide between two freemen when legal evidence still left a reasonable
doubt. Some of these ordeals were old in history: the Avesta indicates
that the ordeal of boiling water was used by the ancient Persians; the
laws of Manu (before a.d. ioo) mention Hindu ordeals by sub- mersion;
and ordeals by fire or hot irons appear in Sophocles’ Antigone. 40 The
Semites rejected ordeals as impious, the Romans ignored them as super-
stitious; the Germans developed them to the full; the Christian Church
reluctantly accepted them, and surrounded them with religious ceremony
and solemn oath.</p>
<p>Trial by combat was as old as ordeal. Saxo Grammaticus describes it
as compulsory in Denmark in the first century a.d.; the laws of the
Angles, Saxons, Franks, Burgundians, and Lombards indicate its general
use among them; and St. Patrick found it in Ireland. When a Roman
Christian com- plained to the Burgundian King Gundobad that such a trial
would decide not</p>

<p>guilt but skill, the King replied: “Is it not true that the issue of
wars and</p>
<p>For nearly every crime had its price: the accused or convicted man
might usually absolve himself by paying a wergild or “man - payment”—
one third to the government, two thirds to the victim or his family. The
sum varied with the social rank of the victim, and an economical
criminal had to take many facts into -consideration. If a man immodestly
stroked the hand of a woman he was to be fined fifteen denarii (.25) ; #
if he so stroked her upper arm, he paid thirty-five denarii (.25); if he
touched her unwilling bosom he paid forty-five denarii (.75) , 42 This
was a tolerable tariff in comparison with other fines: 2500 denarii (75)
for the assault and robbery of a Frank by a Roman, 1400 for the assault
and robbery of a Roman by a Frank, 8000 denarii for killing a Frank,
4000 for killing a Roman: 43 so low had the mighty Roman fallen in the
eyes of his conquerors. If, as not seldom happened, satis- factory
compensation was not received by the victim or his relatives, they might
take their own revenge; in this way vendettas might leave a trail of
blood through many generations. Wergild and judicial combat were the
best expedients that primitive Germans could devise to wean men from
vengeance to law.</p>
<p>The most fa mous clause in the Salic Law read: “Of Salic land no
portion of the inheritance shall go to a woman” (lix, 6) ; on this
basis, in the four - teenth century, France would reject the claim of
the English King Edward III to the French throne through his mother
Isabelle; whereupon would follow the Hundred Years’ War. The clause
applied only to realty, which was presumed to require for its protection
the military power of a male. In general the Salic Law did no service to
women. It exacted a double wergild for their murder, 44 valuing them as
the possible mothers of many men. But (like early Roman law) it kept
women under the perpetual wardship of father, husband, or son; it made
death the penalty for adultery by the wife, but asked no penalty of the
adulterous male; 45 and it permitted divorce at the husband’s whim. 46
Custom, if not law, allowed polygamy to the Frank kings.</p>

<li>The Salic Law (xiv) equates the denarius as one-fortieth of a
solidus, which then contained one sixth of an ounce of gold, or.83 in
the United States of America in 1946. The medieval scarcity of gold and
currency gave to the sums mentioned in the text a much greater purchas -
ing or punishing power than they would have today.</li>

<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>9 1</p>
<p>The first Frank king known by name was the Chlodio who attacked</p>
<p>Cologne in 43 1 ; Aetius defeated him, but Chlodio succeeded in
occupying Gaul as far west as the Somme, and making Tournai his capital.
A possibly legendary successor, Merovech (“Son of the Sea”?), gave his
name to the Merovingian dynasty, which ruled the Franks till 751.
Merovech’s son Chil - deric seduced Basina, wife of a Thuringian king;
she went to be his queen, saying she knew no man wiser, stronger, or
handsomer. The child of their union was Clovis, who founded France and
gave his name to eighteen French kings.*</p>
<p>Clovis inherited the Merovingian throne in 481, aged fifteen. His
realm was then a mere corner of Gaul; other Frank tribes ruled the
Rhineland, and the Visigothic and Burgundian kingdoms in southern Gaul
had been made fully independent by the fall of Rome. Northwest Gaul,
still nominally under Roman power, was left defenseless. Clovis invaded
it, captured towns and dignitaries, accepted ransoms, sold spoils,
bought troops, supplies, and arms, advanced to Soissons, and defeated a
“Roman” army (486). During the next ten years he extended his conquests
till they touched Brittany and the Loire. He won over the Gallic
population by leaving them in possession of their lands, and the
orthodox Christian clergy by respecting their creed and their wealth. In
493 he married a Christian, Clothilde, who soon converted him from
paganism to Nicene Christianity. Remi, bishop and saint, baptized him at
Reims before an audience of prelates and notables judiciously invited
from all Gaul; and 3000 soldiers followed Clovis to the font. Perhaps
Clovis, longing to reach the Mediterranean, thought France was worth a
Mass. The orthodox population in Visigothic and Burgundian Gaul now
looked</p>
<p>askance at their Arian rulers, and became the secret or open allies
of the young Frank king.</p>
<p>Alaric II saw the oncoming tide, and tried to turn it back with fair
words. He invited Clovis to a conference; they met at Amboise, and
pledged last- ing friendship. But Alaric, returning to Toulouse,
arrested some orthodox bishops for conspiring with the Franks. Clovis
summoned his martial assem- bly and said: “I take it very hard that
these Arians hold part of Gaul. Let us go with God’s help and conquer
them.” 47 Alaric defended himself as well as he could with a divided
people; he was defeated at Vouille, near Poitiers (507), and was slain
by Clovis’ hand. “After Clovis had spent the winter in Bordeaux,” says
Gregory of Tours, “and had taken all t he treasures of Alaric from
Toulouse, he went to besiege Angouleme. And the Lord gave him such grace
that the walls fell down of their own accord”; 48 here, so soon, is the
characteristic note of the medieval chronicler. Sigebert, the old king
of the R ipuarian Franks, had long been an ally of Clovis. To Sigebert’s
son Clovis now suggested the advantages that would come from Sigebert’s
death. The</p>
<p>Chlodwig, Ludwig, Clovis, Louis are one name.</p>
<p>92 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. IV</p>
<p>son killed his father; Clovis sent professions of friendship to the
patricide, and agents to murder him; this having been attended to,
Clovis marched to Cologne, and persuaded the Ripuarian chieftains to
accept him as their king. “Every day,” says Gregory, “God caused his
enem ies to fall beneath his hand… because he walked with a right heart
before the Lord, and did the things that were pleasing in His sight.”
49</p>
<p>The conquered Arians were readily converted to the orthodox faith,
and their clergy, by omitting an iota, were allowed to retain their
clerical rank. Clovis, rich with captives, slaves, spoils, and
benedictions, moved his capital to Paris. There, four years later, he
died, old at forty-five. Queen Clothilde, having helped to make Gaul
France, “came to Tours after the death of her husband, and served there
in the church of St. Martin, and dwelt in the place with the greatest
chastity and kindness all the days of her life.” 80</p>

</ol>
<p>Clovis, who had longed for sons, had too many at his death. To avoid
a war of succession he divided his kingdom among them: Childebert
received the region of Paris, Chlodomer that of Orleans, Chlotar that of
Soissons, Theodoric that of Metz and Reims. With barbarian energy they
continued the policy of unification by conquest. They took Thuringia in
530, Bur- gundy in 534, Provence in 536, Bavaria and Swabia in 555; and
Chlotar I, outliving his brothers and inheriting their kingdoms,
governed a Gaul vaster than any later France. Dying (561), he redivided
Gaul into three parts: the Reims and Metz region, known as Austrasia
(i.e., East) , went to his son Sige- bert; Burgundy to Gunthram; and to
Chilperic the Soissons region, known asNeustria (i.e., Northwest).</p>
<p>From the day of Clovis’ marriage the history of France has been
bisexual, mingling love and war. Sigebert sent costly presents to
Athanagild, Visi- gothic king of Spain, and asked for his daughter
Brunhilda; Athanagild, fearing the Franks even when they bore gifts,
consented; and Brunhilda came to grace the halls of Metz and Reims
(566). Chilperic was envious; all. that he had was a simple wife,
Audovera, and a rough concubine, Fredegunda. He asked Athanagild for
Brunhilda’s sister; Galswintha came to Soissons, and Chilperic loved
her, for she had brought great treasures. But she was older than her
sister. Chilperic returned to the arms of Fredegunda; Gal- swintha
proposed to go back to Spain; Chilperic had her strangled (567).
Sigebert declared war upon Chilperic, and defeated him; but two slaves
sent by Fredegunda assassinated Sigebert. Brunhilda was captured,
escaped, crowned her young son Childebert II, and ruled ably in his
name.</p>
<p>Chilperic is described to us as “the Nero and Herod of our time,”
ruthless, murderous, lecherous, gluttonous, greedy for gold. Gregory of
Tours, our</p>
<p>EUROPE TAKES FORM</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>sole authority for this portrait, partly explains it by making him
also the Frederick II of his age. Chilperic, he tells us, scoffed at the
idea of three per- sons in one God, and at the conception of God as like
a man; held scandalous discussions with Jews; protested against the
wealth of the Church and the political activity of the bishops; annulled
wills made in favor of churches; sold bishoprics to the highest bidders;
and tried to remove Gregory himself from the see of Tours. 51 The poet
Fortunatus described the same king as a synthesis of virtues, a just and
genial ruler, a Cicero of eloquence; but Chil- peric had rewarded
Fortunatus’ verse. 52</p>
<p>Chilperic was stabbed to death in 584, possibly by an agent of
Brunhilda. He left an infant son, Chlotar II, in whose stead Fredegunda
ruled Neustria with as much skill, perfidy, and cruelty as any man of
the time. She sent a young cleric to kill Brunhilda; when he returned
unsuccessful she had his hands and feet cut off; but these items too are
from Gregory. 53 Meanwhile the nobles of Austrasia, encouraged by
Chlotar II, raised revolt after revolt against the imperious Brunhilda;
she controlled them as well as she could by diplomacy tempered with
assassination; finally they deposed her, aged eighty, tortured her for
three days, tied her by hair, hand, and foot to the tail of a horse, and
lashed the horse to flight (614). Chlotar II inherited all three
kingdoms, and the Frank realm was again one.</p>
<p>From this red chronicle we may exaggerate the barbarism that darkened
Gaul hardly a century after the urbane and polished Sidonius; men must
find some substitute for elections. The unifying work of Clovis was
undone by his descendants, as that of Charlemagne would be; but at least
government continued, and not all Gauls could afford the polygamy and
brutality of their kings. The apparent autocracy of the monarch was
limited by the power of jealous nobles; he rewarded their services in
administration and war with estates on which they were practically
sovereign; and on these great demesnes began the feudalism that would
fight the French monarchy for a thousand years. Serfdom grew, and
slavery received a new lease of life from new wars. Industry passed from
the towns to the manors; the towns shrank in size, and fell under the
control of the feudal lords; commerce was still active, but hindered by
unstable currencies, highway brigandage, and the rise of feudal tolls.
Famine and pestilence fought successfully against the eager reproduc-
tiveness of men.</p>
<p>The Frank chieftains intermarried with what remained of the
Gallo-</p>
<p>Roman senatorial class, and generated the aristocracy of France. It
was in these centuries a nobility of force, relishing war, scorning
letters, proud of its long beards and silken robes, and almost as
polygamous as any Moslem save Mohammed. Seldom has an upper class shown
such contempt for moral- ity. Conversion to Christianity had no effect
upon them; Christianity seemed to them merely an expensive agency of
rule and popular pacification; and in “the triumph of barbarism and
religion” barbarism dominated for five cen -</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>uries. Assassination, patricide, fratricide, torture, mutilation,
treachery, adultery, and incest mitigated the boredom of rule.
Chilperic, we are told, ordered every joint in Sigila the Goth to be
burned with white-hot irons, and each limb to be torn from its socket.
54 Charibert had as mistresses two sisters, one a nun; Dagobert (628-39)
had three wives at once. Sexual ex- cesses perhaps accounted for the
exceptional sterility of the Merovingian kings: of Clovis’ four sons
only Chlotar had issue; of Chlotar’s four sons only one had a child. The
kings married at fifteen, and were exhausted at thirty; many of them
died before the age of twenty-eight. 55 By 6 14 the Merovingian house
had spent its energy, and was ready to be replaced.</p>
<p>Amid this chaos education barely survived. By 600 literacy had become
a luxury of the clergy. Science was almost extinct. Medicine remained,
for we hear of court physicians; but among the people magic and prayer
seemed better than drugs. Gregory, Bishop of Tours (538? — 94) ,
denounced as sinful the use of medicine instead of religion as a means
of curing illness. In his own sickness he sent for a physician, but soon
dismissed him as ineffectual; then he drank a glass of water containing
dust from St. Martin’s tomb, and was completely cured. 56 Gregory
himself was the chief prose writer of his time. He knew personally
several Merovingian kings, and occasionally served as their emissaries;
his History of the Franks is a crude, disorderly, preju- diced,
superstitious, and vivid firsthand account of the later Merovingian age.
His Latin is corrupt, vigorous, direct; he apologizes for his bad
grammar, and hopes that sins of grammar will not be punished on Judgment
Day. 57 He accepts miracles and prodigies with the trustful imagination
of a child or the genial shrewdness of a bishop; “we shall mingle
together in our tale the miraculous doings of the saints and the
slaughters of the nations.” 58 In 587, he assures us, snakes fell from
the sky, and a village with all its buildings and inhabitants suddenly
disappeared. 50 He denounces everything in anyone guilty of unbelief or
of injury to the Church; but he accepts without flinching the
barbarities, treacheries, and immoralities of the Church’s faithful
sons. His prejudices are frank, and can be easily discounted. The final
impression is one of engaging simplicity.</p>
<p>After him the literature of Gaul becomes predominantly religious in
con- tent, barbarous in language and form — with one shining exception.
Venantius Fortunatus ( c. 530-610) was born in Italy and educated at
Ravenna; at thirty-five he moved to Gaul, wrote lauds for its bishops
and queens, and developed a platonic affection for Radegunda, wife of
the first Chlotar. When she founded a convent Fortunatus became a
priest, her chaplain, and finally bishop of Poitiers. He wrote pretty
poems in honor of potentates and saints; twenty-nine to Gregory of
Tours; a life of St. Martin in heroic verse; above all, some sonorous
hymns, of which one, Pange lingua , inspired Thomas Aquinas to a similar
theme and still higher performance, while another, Vexilla regis, became
a lasting part of Catholic liturgy. He mingled</p>

<p>feeling admirably with poetic skill; reading his fresh and genial
lines we discover the existence of kindliness, sincerity, and the
tenderest sentiment amid the royal brutalities of the Merovingian
age.</p>

<li>VISIGOTHIC SPAIN: 456-7 1 1</li>
</ol>
<p>In 420, as we have seen, the Visigoths of Gaul recaptured Spain from
the Vandals, and returned it to Rome. But Rome could not defend it;
eighteen years later the Suevi emerged from their hills in the
northwest, and overran the peninsula. The Visigoths under Theodoric II
(456) and Euric (466) came down again across the Pyrenees, reconquered
most of Spain, and this time kept the country as their own. A Visigothic
dynasty ruled Spain there- after till the coming of the Moors.</p>
<p>At Toledo the new monarchy built a splendid capital and gathered an
opulent court. Athanagild (564-7) and Leovigild (568-86) were strong
rulers, who defeated Frank invaders in the north and Byzantine armies in
the south; it was the wealth of Athanagild that won for his daughters
the privi- lege of being murdered as Frank queens. In 589 King Recared
changed his faith, and that of most Visigoths in Spain, from Arian to
orthodox Christian- ity; perhaps he had read the history of Alaric II.
The bishops now became the chief support of the monarchy, and the chief
power in the state; by their superior education and organization they
dominated the nobles who sat with them in the ruling councils of Toledo;
and though the king’s authority was theoretically absolute, and he chose
the bishops, these councils elected him, and exacted pledges of policy
in advance. Under the guidance of the clergy a system of laws was
promulgated (634) which was the most competent and least tolerant of all
the barbarian codes. It improved procedure by weighing the evidence of
witnesses rather than the character certificates of friends; it applied
the same laws to Romans and Visigoths alike, and established the
principle of equality before the law. 00 But it rejected freedom of
worship, demanded orthodox Christianity of all inhabitants, and
sanctioned a long and bitter persecution of the Spanish Jews.</p>
<p>Through the influence of the Church, which retained Latin in her
sermons and liturgy, the Visigoths, within a century after their
conquest of Spain, forgot their Germanic speech, and corrupted the Latin
of the peninsula into the. masculine power and feminine beauty of the
Spanish tongue. Monastic and episcopal schools provided education,
mostly ecclesiastical but partly classical; and academies rose at
Vaclara, Toledo, Saragossa, and Seville. Poetry was encouraged, drama
was denounced as obscene — which it was. The only name surviving from
the literature of Gothic Spain is that of Isidore of Seville (
c. 560-636). An edifying legend tells how a Spanish lad, reproved for
mental sluggishness, ran away from home, and, tired with wandering,</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>(chap. IV</p>
<p>sat down by a well. His eye was caught by the deep furrow in a stone
at the edge; a passing maiden explained that the furrow was worn by the
attrition of the rope that lowered and raised the buck et. “If,” said
Isidore to himself, “by daily use the soft rope could penetrate the
stone, surely perseverance could overcome the dullness of my brain.” He
returned to his father’s house, and became the learned Bishop of
Seville. 61 Actually we know little of his life. Amid the chores of a
conscientious cleric he found time to write half a dozen books. Perhaps
as an aid to memory he compiled through many years a medley of passages,
on all subjects, from pagan and Christian au- thors; his friend Braulio,
Bishop of Saragossa, urged him to publish these excerpts; yielding, he
transformed them into one of the most influential books of the Middle
Ages — Etymologiarum sive originum libri xx ( Twenty Books of
Etymologies or Origins) — now a volume of 900 octavo pages. It is an
encyclopedia, but not alphabetically arranged; it deals successively
with grammar, rhetoric, and logic as the “trivium”; then with
arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy as the “quadrivium”; then
with medicine, law, chronology, theology, anatomy, physiology, zoology,
cosmography, physical geography, architecture, surveying, mineralogy,
agriculture, war, sports, ships, costumes,.furniture, domestic utensils…
; and under each topic it defines, and seeks the origin of, the basic
terms. Man, we learn, is called homo because God made him from the earth
(humus); the knees are genua because in the foetus they lie opposite the
cheeks ( genae ). 02 Isidore was an industrious, if indiscriminate,
scholar; he knew considerable Greek, was fa- miliar with Lucretius
(rarely mentioned in the Middle Ages), and preserved in extracts many
passages of pagan literature that would otherwise have been lost. His
work is a farrago of weird etymologies, incredible miracles, fanciful
allegorical interpretations of the Scriptures, science and history
distorted to prove moral principles, and factual errors that a little
observation would have set straight. His book stands as a lasting
monument to the ignorance of his Of the arts in Visigothic Spain almost
nothing remains. Apparently Toledo, Italica, Cordova, Granada, Merida,
and other cities had fine churches, palaces, and public buildings,
designed in classic styles but distinguished by Christian symbols and
Byzantine ornament. 63 In the palaces and cathedral of Toledo, according
to Arab historians, Arab conquerors found twenty-five gold and jeweled
crowns; an illuminated Psalter written upon gold leaf with ink made of
melted rubies; tissues inwoven, armor inlaid, swords and daggers
studded, vases filled, with jewelry; and an emerald table inwrought with
silver and gold — one of many costly gifts of the Visigothic rich to

the popu- lace. Property was concentrated in the hands of a few; the
great gulf between rich and poor, between Christian and Jew, divided the
nation into three states; and when the Arabs came, the poor and the Jews
connived at the over- throw of a monarchy and a Church that had ignored
their poverty or op- pressed their faith.</p>
<p>In 708, on the death of the feeble king Witiza, the aristocracy
refused the throne to his children, but gave it to Roderick. The sons of
Witiza fled to Africa, and asked the aid of Moorish chieftains. The
Moors made some tenta- tive raids upon the Spanish coast, found Spain
divided and almost defenseless, and in 7 1 1 came over in fuller force.
The armies of T ariq and Roderick joined battle on the shores of Lake
Janda in the province of Cadiz; part of the Visi- gothic forces went
over to the Moors; Roderick disappeared. The victorious Moslems advanced
to Seville, Cordova, Toledo; several towns opened their gates to the
invaders. The Arab general Musa established himself in the capital
(713), and announced that Spain now belonged to the prophet Mohammed and
the caliph of Damascus.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Theodoric</li>
</ol>
<p>When Attila’s empire crumbled at his death (453) the Ostrogoths whom
he had subdued regained their independence. The Byzantine emperors paid
them to drive other German barbarians westward, rewarded them with Pan-
nonia, and took Theodoric, the seven-year-old son of their King
Theodemir, to Constantinople as a hostage for Ostrogothic fidelity. In
eleven years at the Byzantine court Theodoric acquired intelligence
without education, absorbed the arts of war and government, but
apparently never learned to write.® 4 He won the admiration of the
Emperor Leo I; and when Theodemir died (475) , Leo recognized Theodoric
as king of the Ostrogoths.</p>
<p>Leo’s successor Zeno, fearful that Theodoric might trouble Byzantium,
suggested to him the conquest of Italy. Odoacer had formally
acknowledged, actually ignored, the Eastern emperors; Theodoric, Zeno
hoped, might bring Italy back under Byzantine rule; in any case the two
leaders of dangerous tribes would amuse each other while Zeno studied
theology. Theodoric liked — some say propounded — the idea. As Zeno’s
patricius he led the Ostrogoths, including 20,000 warriors, across the
Alps (488). The orthodox bishops of Italy, disliking Odoacer’s Arianism,
supported the Arian invader as rep - resenting an almost orthodox
emperor. With their help Theodoric broke Odoacer’s sturdy resistance in
five years of war, and persuaded him to a compromise peace. He invited
Odoacer and his son to dine with him at’</p>

<p>In this environment of security and peace Latin literature in Italy
had its final fling. Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus (48o?-573)
served as sec- retary to both Odoacer and Theodoric. At the latter’s
suggestion he wrote</p>
<p>The career of Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (47 5 P-524)
paralleled that of Cassiodorus, except in longevity. Both were born of
rich Roman fam- ilies, served Theodoric as ministers, labored to build a
bridge between pagan- ism and Christianity, and wrote dreary books that
were read and treasured for a thousand years. Boethius’ father was
consul in 483; his father -in-law, Symmachus the Younger, was descended
from the Symmachus who had fought for the Altar of Victory. He received
the best education that Rome could give, and then spent eighteen years
in the schools of Athens. Returning to his Italian villas, he buried
himself in study. Resolved to save the elements of a classical culture
that was visibly dying, he gave his time — the scholar’s most grudging
gift — to summarizing in lucid Latin the works of Euclid on geometry, of
Nicomachus on arithmetic, of Archimedes on mechanics, of Ptolemy on
astronomy…. His translation of Aristotle’s Organon, or logical
treatises, and of Porphyry’s Introduction to the C ategories of
Aristotle pro- vided the leading texts and ideas of the next seven
centuries in logic, and set the stage for the long dispute between
realism and nominalism. Boethius tried his hand also at theology: in an
essay on the Trinity he defended the ortho- dox Christian doctrine, and
laid down the principle that where faith and</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>reason conflict, faith should prevail. None of these writings repays
reading today, but it would be hard to exaggerate their influence on
medieval thought.</p>
<p>Moved by his family’s tradition of public service, Boethius dragged
him - self from these abstruse pursuits into the whirlpool of political
life. He rose rapidly; became consul, then patricius, then master of the
offices — i.e., prime minister (5 22)’. He distinguished himself by both
his philanthropy and his eloquence; men compared him with Demosthenes
and Cicero. But eminence makes enemies. The Gothic officials at the
court resented his sympathy with the Roman and the Catholic population,
and aroused the suspicions of the King. Theodoric was now sixty-nine,
failing in health and mind, wondering how to transmit in stability the
rule of an Arian Gothic family over a nation nine tenths Roman and eight
tenths Catholic. He had reason to believe that both the aristocracy and
the Church were his foes, who impatiently awaited his death. In 523
Justinian, Byzantine regent, issued an edict banishing all Manicheans
from the Empire, and barring from civil or military office all pagans
and heretics — including all Arians except Goths. Theodoric suspected
that the exception was intended to disarm him, but would be withdrawn at
the first opportunity; and he judged the decree a poor return for the
full liberties that he had accorded to the orthodox creed in the West.
Had he not raised to the highest offices that same Boethius who had
written an anti- Arian tract on the Trinity? In this very year 523 he
had given to the church of St. Peter two magnificent chandeliers of
solid silver as a gesture of cour- tesy to the pope. However, he had
offended a great part of the population by protecting the Jews; when
mobs destroyed synagogues in Milan, Genoa, and Rome, he had rebuilt the
synagogues at public expense. 69</p>
<p>It was in this conjuncture of events that word reached Theodoric of a
senatorial conspiracy to depose him. Its leader, he was told, was
Albinus, president of the Senate and friend of Boethius. The generous
scholar hastened to Theodoric, guaranteed the innocence of Albinu s, and
said: “If Albinus is a criminal, I and the whole Senate are equally
guilty.” Three men of blem - ished reputation accused Boethius of
sharing in the plot, and they adduced a document, bearing Boethius’
signature, which invited the Byzantine Em - pire to reconquer Italy.
Boethius denied all charges, and rejected the docu- ment as a forgery;
later, however, he admitted: “Had there been any hopes of liberty I
should have freely indulged them. Had I known of a conspiracy against
the King… you w ould not have known of it from me.” 70 He was arrested
(523).</p>
<p>Theodoric sought some understanding with the Emperor. In words</p>
<p>worthy of a philosopher king he wrote to Justin:</p>
<p>To pretend to dominion over the conscience is to usurp the pre-</p>
<p>rogative of God. By the nature of things the power of sovereigns
is</p>
<p>confined to political government; they have no right of
punishment</p>
<p>except over those who disturb the public peace. The most
dangerous</p>

<p>IOI</p>
<p>CHAP. IV)</p>
<p>heresy is that of a sovereign who separates himself from part of
his</p>
<p>subjects because they believe not according to his belief. 71</p>
<p>Justin replied that he had a right to refuse office to men whose
loyalty he could not trust, and that the order of society required unity
of belief. The Arians of the East appealed to Theodoric to protect them.
He asked Pope John I to go to Constantinople and intercede for the
dismissed Arians; the Pope protested that this was no mission for one
pledged to destroy heresy; but Theodoric insisted. John was received
with such honors in Constanti- nople, and returned with such empty
hands, that Theodoric accused him of treason, and flung him into jail,
where, a year later, he died. 72</p>
<p>Meanwhile Albinus and Boethius had been tried before the King,
adjudged guilty, and sentenced to death. The frightened Senate passed
decrees re- pudiating them, confiscating their property, and approving
the penalty. Symmachus defended his son-in-law, and was himself
arrested. Boethius, in prison, now composed one of the most famous of
medieval books — De consolatione philosophiae. In its alternation of
undistinguished prose and charming verse no tear finds voice; there is
only a Stoic resignation to the unaccountable whims of fortune, and an
heroic attempt to reconcile the mis- fortunes of good men with the
benevolence, omnipotence, and prescience of God. Boethius reminds
himself of all the blessings that life has showered upon him — wealth,
and a “noble father -in- law, and a chaste wife,” and ex - emplary
children; he recalls his dignities, and the proud moment when he
thrilled with his eloquence a Senate whose presiding consuls were both
of them his sons. Such bliss, he tells himself, cannot last forever;
fortune must balance it now and then with a chastening blow; and so much
happiness can forgive so fatal a calamity. 73 And yet such recalled
felicity can sharpen affliction: “in all adversity of fortune,” says
Boethius in a line that Dante made Francesca echo, “it is the most
unhappy kind of misf ortune to have been happy.” 74 He asks Dame
Philosophy— whom he personifies in medieval style — where real happiness
lies; he discovers that it does not lie in wealth or glory, pleasure or
power; and he concludes that there is no true or secure happines s
except in union with God; “blessedness is one with divinity.” 75
Strangely, there is no suggestion, in this book, of personal
immortality, no reference to Christianity or to any specifically
Christian doctrine, no line that might not have been written by Zeno,
Epictetus, or Aurelius. The last work of pagan philosophy was written by
a Christian who, in the hour of death, remembered Athens rather than
Golgotha.</p>
<p>On October 23, 524, his executioners came. They tied a cord around
his head, and tightened it till his eyes burst from their sockets; then
they beat him with clubs till he died. A few months later Symmachus was
put to death. According to Procopius, 70 Theodoric wept for the wrong he
had done to Boethius and Symmachus. In 526 he followed his victims to
the grave.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. IV</p>
<p>His kingdom died soon after him. He had nominated his grandson Atha-
laric to succeed him; but Athalaric being only ten years old, his mother
Amalasuntha ruled in his name. She was a woman of considerable education
and many accomplishments, a friend and perhaps a pupil of Cassiodorus,
who now served her as he had served her father. But she leaned too much
toward Roman ways to please her Gothic subjects; and they objected to
the classical studies with which, in their views, she was enfeebling the
King. She yielded the boy to Gothic tutors; he took to sexual
indulgence, and died at eighteen. Amalasuntha associated her cousin
Theodahad with her on the throne, having pledged him to let her rule.
Presently he deposed and imprisoned her. She appealed to Justinian, now
Byzantine Emperor, to come to her aid. Belisarius came.</p>
