<h4 id="chapter-xvii-the-arts-in-england">CHAPTER XVII The Arts in
England</h4>
<p>I. THE ARTISTS</p>
<p>T HE words art and artist, which in guild days had been applied to
any craft or craftsman, changed their meaning in the eighteenth century
as crafts and guilds were replaced by industries and workingmen; now
they were applied to the practice and practitioners of music,
decoration, ceramics, drawing, engraving, painting, sculpture, and
architecture. Likewise the word genius, which had signified some innate
and characteristic quality, or some supernatural spirit, now
increasingly denoted a transcendent native ability, or its possessors;
like miracle and act of God, it became a convenient substi- tute for a
natural and specific explanation of an unusual person or event.</p>
<p>The transition to industry, commerce, and city life brought a further
de- cline in aristocratic patronage of art; however, we must note that
moneyed men supported Wordsworth and Coleridge, and Lord Egremont opened
his manor house at Petworth to Turner as a refuge from London. George
III had helped to establish (1768) the Royal Academy of Art with a gift
of five thousand pounds and handsome quarters in Somerset House. Its
forty mem- bers were not made automatically immortals like their French
models, but they were raised to the gentry with the title of (e) squire,
and though their new dignity could not be passed on to their offspring,
it helped to improve the social standing of major artists in Britain.
The Academy organized classes in anatomy, drawing, painting, sculpture,
and architecture. Inevitably an institution supported by a conservative
monarch became a citadel of tradi- tion and respectability. Innovative
artists denounced it, and became so numerous, and won such acclaim, that
in 1805 some nobles and bankers financed the organization of the British
Institution for the Development of the Fine Arts, which held periodic
exhibitions, awarded prizes, and provided a lively competition for the
Royal Academy. Guided, angered, and nour- ished by these rival forces,
British art produced excellent works in every field.</p>
<p>No; music was an exception; it was barren of memorable compositions
in this period. England was keenly conscious of this dearth, and made up
for it in some measure by generous appreciation of composers coming to
her from the Continent; so she gave Haydn a warm welcome in 1790 and
again in</p>

<p>The minor arts flourished without flair. They continued to produce

<p>ceramics. Benjamin Smith molded iron into an ornate candelabrum for
pre- sentation by the city of London to the Duke of Wellington. 1 John
Flaxman, besides making classical designs for Wedgwood pottery,
fashioned the fa- mous Trafalgar Cup to commemorate Nelson’s victory, 2
and he was both sculptor and architect of the massive monument to Nelson
in St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>Sculpture, however, was almost a minor art in England, perhaps
because it favored a nudity uncongenial to the national climate and
morality. In 1 80 1 Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, while serving
as British envoy to the Porte, persuaded the Turkish authorities in
Athens to let him remove from the Acropolis “any pieces of stone with
old inscriptions or figures thereon.” Interpreting this like a lord,
Lord Elgin removed the great frieze of the Parthenon, and many marble
busts, and transported them, in ship after ship, 1803-12, to England. He
was denounced by Byron and others as a rapacious vandal, but he was
vindicated by a committee of Parliament, and the “Elgin marbles” were
bought by the nation for / 35,000 (much less than Elgin paid for them),
and were deposited in the British Museum. 3</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ARCHITECTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>The marbles shared in supporting the classic wave against the Gothic
rip- ples in the war of architectural styles; a thousand columns —
Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian — advanced to oppose the amateur efforts of
Walpole and Beckford to restore the pointed arches and towered
battlements so dear to medieval knights and saints. Even in secular
structures the columns won; Sir William Chambers’ Somerset House (1775
ff.) is a spreading Parthenon, and many a country house looks like a
Greek peristyle guarding a Roman palace; let James Wyatt’s Ashridge Park
mansion (1806 -13) serve as a stately instance of the kind. In 1792 the
future Sir John Soane, son of a bricklayer, began to rebuild the Bank of
England behind a Corinthian portico, combining the Arch of Constantine
with the Temple of the Sun or Moon.</p>
<p>The Gothic revival inaugurated by Horace Walpole’s Strawberry
Hill</p>
<p>(1748-73) could not maintain itself against the avalanche of pillars,
domes, and pediments. William Beckford was the romantic hero of this
medieval trance. Born rich of a father who twice became mayor of London,
he was given more education than he could stand: he received piano
lessons from</p>
<p>he young Mozart, architectural training from Sir William Chambers,
and history via the Grand Tour. At Lausanne he bought the library of
Edward Gibbon. After some ambisexual scandals he married Lady Margaret
Gordon, who died in childbirth. Meanwhile he had written Vathek, the
most power- ful of the Oriental mystery novels that were swelling the
Romantic wave; it was published in English and French (1786-87), and won
high praise from Byron. Helped by Wyatt, Beckford began in 1796 to build
a Gothic abbey at his Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, filled it with art
and books, and lived there, hermitically sealed, from 1807 to 1822. Then
he sold it, and shortly after- ward its collapse revealed basic faults
in its structure and design. He died</p>
<p>378 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>at Bath in 1844, aged eighty- five. John Hoppner’s sympathetic
portrait ( c. 1800) preserves a spirit poetic, mystic, and humane.</p>
<p>John Nash lightened the heaviness of British architecture by adding a
bit of rococo gaiety. Well seconded by Humphry Repton as landscape gar-
dener, he designed country estates with a distribution of cottages,
bowers, dairies, in French, Indian, Chinese styles. They pleased the
bored nobles and gentry; Nash became rich, and won the patronage of the
lavish Prince. In 1 8 1 1 he was commissioned to rebuild a mile of
Regent Street to run from the Regent’s Carlton House in a sweeping curve
out to the countryside. Nash varied the lines with crescents and
terraces, interspersed open spaces of grass and trees between the
building groups, and used Ionic columns to grace the curve of the
avenue. (Most of the work has been demolished to allow more buildings
and less grass.) It was a brilliant essay in town planning, but its cost
shocked a nation that was half starving itself to defeat Napoleon.
Nevertheless the delighted Regent engaged Nash to restore the Royal
Pavilion at Brighton, which had been a favorite resort of the Prince and
his friends. Nash accomplished the task between 1815 and 1823, at a cost
of £ 1 60,000. He rebuilt the pavilion in Hindu-Moorish style, with
tentlike domes and flanking minarets. Its banquet hall was remodeled
with a convex ceiling and Chinese decoration, including lotus-and-dragon
chandeliers cost- ing j£ 4,290.* The first impression was one of bizarre
splendor; the final judg- ment condemned the excess in ornament and
cost.</p>
<p>In 1820 the Regent became George IV. Soon he commissioned Nash to
rebuild Buckingham House as a royal palace. Amid the destitution and
near- bankruptcy that had followed the victory over Napoleon, Nash
labored and spent until the royal wastrel died (1830). Then the
exuberant architect was summoned by the new government to explain his
expenditures and some alleged defects in the construction. Seldom had
England been so splendid, or so poor.</p>

<li>FROM CARTOONS TO CONSTABLE</li>
</ol>
<p>During twenty years of war a thousand British artists had struggled
to feed their families and their dreams. Not the humblest of them in
reward and fame were the caricaturists who filled the press with
cartoons of the passing scene. Napoleon was a blessing to these impish
geniuses, for their daily satires of “Little Boney”— or the
“Mediterranean mulatto,” as the Morning Post called him 5 — were shots
in the arm to a weary “war effort,” and pricks in the pride of the
fuming Emperor.</p>
<p>Greatest of these acupunctors was Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827). Born
to a rich but speculative trader, he was amply encouraged in his talent
for drawing. After studying at the Royal Academy, he enrolled in the
Lcole de PAcademie Royale in Paris, returned to England, and soon won
acclaim by his drawings. Suddenly impoverished by the ruin of his father
in gam- bling, he was reanimated by a French aunt who sent him X 3
5,000. Free to</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>THE ARTS IN ENGLAND</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>satirize the absurdities and hypocrisies of his time, he drew
caricatures of a duchess kissing a butcher for his vote, a fat parson
receiving a pig as tithe from a half-starved peasant, a group of naval
officers hunting whores ashore. He went on to draw extensive and complex
pictures — Vauxhall Gardens, Comforts of Bath, and a hilarious series,
nationally famous, The Tours of Dr. Syntax. His anger at politicians,
roisterers, and dolts led him to exag- gerate the forgivable
exaggerations of caricature. Many of his drawings had to be cleansed of
their obscenity; his satire lost all healing pity; his later work
breathed scorn of the human race, as if there had never been a loving
mother or a generous man.</p>
<p>Even more popular were the caricatures of James Gillray (1757-1815);
people fought at the bookstores to get the first copies of his cartoons.
6 Like Rowlandson he studied at the Royal Academy, and became a finished
artist, vivid in imagination but firm in line. He put nearly all his art
at the service of the war: he pictured Napoleon as a pygmy, and
Josephine as a fishwife; he represented Fox, Sheridan, and Horne Tooke
(supporters of the French Revolution) as waiting, in a London club, upon
a victorious Revolutionary general. Reprints of his satires — crude in
concept, finished in form — circu- lated throughout Europe, and shared
in dethroning Napoleon. 7 He died sev- enteen days before Waterloo.</p>
<p>There were many good engravers in that generation, but William Blake
cut deeply enough to survive time’s obliterations. He developed his own
methods, and even tried to replace print by etching text and
illustration to- gether into copper plates. But his pen outran his
graver, and in the end he spoke through poetry.</p>
<p>He was a rebel because he resented his poverty; because the Academy
re- fused to recognize engravers as artists as well as artisans, or to
admit their works to its exhibitions; and because he heartily rejected
its injunctions to cleave to the rules, traditions, and proprieties of
art. “The Enquiry in Eng - land,” he declared (c. 1808), “is not whether
a Man has talents and genius, but whether he is Passive and Politic and
a Virtuous Ass and obedient to Noblemen’s Opinions in Art. If he is, he
is a God Man. If not, he must be starved.” 8 He neared this at times,
since he received only pittances for draw - ings and engravings that in
the London of 1918 fetched ,ooo. 9 His twenty-two plates illustrating
the Book of Job kept him alive at two pounds per week from 1823 to 1825;
they were sold to J. Pierpont Morgan (1907) for £ 5,600; they are among
the finest engravings in history.</p>
<p>Blake was a complex cross between pagan and puritan, classic and
roman- tic. He was enthralled by Michelangelo’s statuary and Sistine
Chapel ceiling. He too felt the splendor of the healthy human body; he
symbolized it in the print (1780) entitled “Glad Day”— a youth
diaphanously clothed, knowing the joy of bounding vitality. Sex plays
only a modest part in his art; it en- tered assertively in his poems,
but moderately in his life; he had a helpful and loving wife, who made
fidelity bearable. His drawings were at first strictly classical, rating
line above color, and form over fancy; but as he advanced in years, and
in love with the Old Testament, he let his pencil roam into</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>imaginary figures overwhelmingly robed, and faces worn by the riddles
of life. 10</p>
<p>In his last years he engraved seven plates for an edition of Dante;
on his deathbed (1827) he made one more print of God as “The Ancient of
Days” creating the world. It was through his almost supernatural
imagination, as well as through the finesse of his line, that he became,
a generation after his death, the proclaimed progenitor of the
Pre-Raphaelite School. We shall meet him again.</p>
<p>Among the painters the vital question, sometimes involving bread and
but- ter, was: How far should they conform to the advice and tastes of
the Academy? Some of its professors gave their highest approval to
historical subjects, as revealing famous characters in memorable events.
Others praised portraiture as probing and revealing character — and as
pleasing contributory notables who wished to be preserved in oil. Very
few of the Academic fra- ternity cared for genre pictures, for these
smelled of the commonalty. Least approval of all was accorded to
landscape paintings; a Constable, who had lost his heart to them, had to
labor in obscurity till he was fifty-three before the Academy allowed
him full membership.</p>
<p>In 1792 Sir Joshua Reynolds died, and the Academy chose as its
president an American domiciled in England. Benjamin West had been born
in Spring- field, Pennsylvania, in 1738. He showed such artistic talent
in youth that generous neighbors sent him to study in Philadelphia, then
to Italy. After imbibing the classical tradition there in galleries and
ruins, he moved to Lon- don (1763), painted some lucrative portraits,
pleased George III, and ad- vanced to historical themes. His Death of
Wolfe (1771), who had snatched Canada from Montcalm and France, shocked
the Academy by picturing modern figures in modern dress; but the elders
admitted that naif a continent was worth an obeisance to pantaloons.</p>
<p>Another American, John Singleton Copley, born near Boston in 1738,
won fame with his portraits of John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and the Cop-
ley family. In 1775 he moved to London, and soon reached his peak with
The Death of Chatham (1779). To escape from the neoclassical
idealization of historical figures, he painted the scene with a
courageous realism which — though it troubled the Academy — effected a
revolution in English painting.</p>
<p>The education of the Academy was continued by Johann Heinrich Fiissli
of Zurich, who in 1764, aged twenty- three, became Henry Fuseli of Lon-
don. Encouraged by Reynolds, he left England in 1770 for eight years of
study in Italy. His flair for heterodox flights of the imagination was
not quite cured by classic models and norms. When he returned to London
he dis- turbed some sleeping beauties with The Nightmare ( 1 78 1 ), in
which a lovely woman dreams that she is approached by a terrifying
fiend. (A copy of this hung in Sigmund Freud’s study.) Despite himself
and his sarcastic wit, Fuseli became a professor in the Academy, where
his lectures eased the transition to Romance and the
Pre-Raphaelites.</p>
<p>The difficulty of making a living by painting nature was illustrated
by</p>

<p>THE ARTS IN ENGLAND</p>
<p>3 8l</p>
<p>he careers of John Hoppner (1758-1810) and John Crome (1768-1821).
Hoppner starved as a lover of landscapes, and then flourished as a
painter of portraits, almost rivaling Lawrence in sitters and fees.
Nelson sat for him; so did Wellington, Walter Scott, and sundry lords;
St. James’s Palace is rich with Hoppner’s legacy. — Crome remained in
his native Norwich nearly all his fifty-three years. He worked for a
time as a sign painter; studied the pic- tures of Hobbema and other
Dutch masters; and learned from them to relish the simple scenes of
common life. Too poor to travel, he sought his subjects in the rural
hinterland of Norwich. There he found the perspective which he painted
in his finest landscape, Mousehold Heath. Art and philosophy needed no
more.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830) followed the primrose path of por-
traiture. The son of an innkeeper, he received little schooling, little
artistic training; it must have disconcerted the Academy to observe how
well he succeeded without them. He had an almost natural flair for
quickly catching a likeness and putting it down — in boyhood at Bristol
with his pencil, in youth at Bath with pastel; only when he moved to
London (1786) did he work with oils. Perhaps his physical charm and
happy spirits opened hearts and doors to him. While still but twenty he
was commissioned to go to Windsor and portray Queen Charlotte Sophia. He
succeeded so diplomati- cally (for she was no beauty) that he was
elected to associate membership in the Academy at twenty-two, and to
full membership at twenty-five. A hun- dred notables competed to sit for
him. He r ejected Cromwell’s advice to paint the warts as well as the
dimples; there was no gold in warts. He im- proved the features of his
sitters, who protested not; and what his ladies lacked in beauty he made
up by clothing them in gossamer finery, endowing them with lovely hands
and fascinating eyes, and casting them in some dra- matic pose. Typical
of his work is the handsome and striking figure he made of the Prince
Regent in 1815. Sometimes, as in the Pinkie of the Huntington Gallery,
he achieved a pleasant whimsy, but we miss in his male portraits the
strong character that Reynolds had found or fashioned in his sitters.
Lawrence earned much, gave generously, and became the idol of his age.
When he died a distinguished cortege escorted him to St. Pa ul’s.</p>
<p>John Constable (1776-1837) insisted on painting landscapes, and
earned no bride till forty. His father was a Sussex miller who indulged
his son’s talent for drawing and painting, and financed two years of
study for him in London. But John’s development was slow; by 1797 he
felt that he deserved</p>
<p>Perhaps he read Wordsworth’s poems about the sc enery around Lake
Windermere, for he too saw God in every leaf. In 1 806 he toured the
Lake District, which let him study mountains embraced by mists, and
fields happy</p>
<p>3 8 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>under tranquil rains. He returned to London strengthened in his
resolve to devote his art to nature. He said of his landscapes that he
hoped “to give to one brief moment, caught from fleeting time, a lasting
and sober existence.” 11 Meanwhile he received incidental commissions
that kept him in food and lodging. In 1 8 1 1 , at last, he produced his
first acclaimed masterpiece — Ded- ham Vale, an Essex panorama under a
midday sun.</p>
<p>In that year, it seems, he fell in love with Maria Bickell, who
welcomed his attentions; but her father forbade her to stoop to so low
an income as Constable then earned. Not till five years later, when his
father’s death left him an assuring income, did he venture to press his
suit. Her father relented, Constable carried off his bartered bride, and
flattered her with a portrait that now brightens a Tate Gallery wall.
Thereafter he painted the finest landscapes that English art had yet
produced — not as exciting as Turner’s, but conveying, with a loving
detail that honored every leaf, the peace and green wealth of the
English countryside. In that happy period he submitted to the Academy
Flatford Mill (1817), The White Horse (1819), The Hay Wain (wagon)
(1821), Salisbury Cathedral (1823), and The Cornfield (1826). Each was a
masterpiece, and won faint praise.</p>
<p>In 1824 he submitted The Hay Wain for exhibition in the Paris Salon,
and in 1825 The White Horse was shown at Lille. Each won a gold medal,
and French critics hailed Constable as a master. The London Royal Acad-
emy, caught short, at last gave him full membership (1829).</p>
<p>The honor came too late to mean much to him, for in that year his
wife died, of tuberculosis probably aggravated by London’s soot.
Constable con - tinued to produce such arresting landscapes as Valley
Farm and W’aterloo Bridge, but nearly all his later work reflected an
enduring grief. He wore mourning until his sudden death.</p>

<p>Joseph Mallord William Turner was as proud as his name, and never al-
lowed a hostile critic or a shattered love to disturb his march to
unquestioned mastery.</p>
<p>He was born on April 23, 1775, perhaps sharing the day and the month
with Shakespeare. His father was a barber whose shop in Maiden Lane, be-
hind Covent Garden, was hardly a fit spot for a landscape artist’s
growth. According to an early biographer, 12 Maiden Lane was a “dim
defile,” paved with mud, crowded with noisy traffic, and torn with
vendors’ cries. Across from the barbershop was an inn, the Oder Cellar,
whose habitues sang in prophetic atonality. Add that William’s sister
was soon to die, and his mother was going mad. Nature and circumstances
made some amends by giving the boy a tough frame and will, a realistic
mind, and an unshakable self- confidence, which, conjoined, withstood,
for seventy-six years, crises, critics, and germs. /</p>
<p>His father saw in him signs of a talent ill-adjusted to Maiden Lane.

<p>sent William, aged ten, to live with an uncle — and attend school —
in Brent- wood, Middlesex. Within two years the boy had produced
drawings that his proud father hung in and around the barbershop, and
offered for sale. A clergyman customer recommended some of them to an
Academic friend. Soon William was given a trial at the Academy; he did
well; he was ac- cepted as a student at the age of fourteen, and, a year
later, was allowed to display a watercolor at the exhibition.</p>
<p>In vacation time, during the years 1789-92, he toured the countryside
with his sketchbook, going as far afield as Oxford, Bristol, Wales;
those eager sketches of land, sun, and sea are still visible in the
British Museum. At nineteen he was selling his drawings to magazines; at
twenty-one he be- gan to exhibit his oil paintings at the Academy; at
twenty-four he was elected an associate, at twenty-seven a full, member.
Made economically in- dependent by his sales, he opened (1800) a
spacious studio at 64 Hurly Street; and there his father came to live
with him as his attendant and busi- ness agent. This love affair
harmonized well with the artist’s disinclination for marriage. He was
not physically or facially attractive, and had little charm of manner.
He was a man absorbed. For almost half a century he dominated English
art, overwhelming competition with the abundance and brilliance of his
work.</p>
<p>Biographers ease their task of understanding him by dividing him into
three periods. In the first (1787-1820) he inclined to historical
subjects, but transformed them into studies of sun and sea. In 1799 he
was among the four painters who, in the Academy exhibition, celebrated
Nelson’s demolition of Napoleon’s fleet at Abukir. In 1802 he made his
first trip abroad. As the packet neared Calais it found the waves too
high and violent to allow dock- ing. Turner and some other passengers
managed to reach shore in a rowboat. There he took out his sketchbook
and outlined the complex scene of the vessel struggling against the
storm; a year later he exhibited in London his massive canvas, Calais
Pier, in which he gave full play to his fondness for dark clouds, angry
seas, and brave men. From France he hurried on to Switzerland to make
four hundred drawings of mountains challenging the sky. His sketchbooks
became his second memory.</p>
<p>When he returned to London he found the Academic critics complaining
that he laid colors down too thickly, recklessly, confusedly, and in
combi- nations violating all sane precedent; that his methods ignored
the norms taught by the late Sir Joshua Reynolds for following Old
Masters and ob- serving traditional rules. Turner honored the memory of
the kindly dictator, but he obeyed the dictates of his own character.
Henceforth he was in art the clearest voice of the Romantic revolt
against age-old subjects, obsolete rules, and the stifling of experiment
and imagination by custom and reality. He replied to his critics by
exhibiting in his studio The Shipwreck (1804) — a merciless
visualization of nature’s mastery over man. It was acclaimed. A year
later he won British hearts by celebrating Nelson’s victory at
Trafalgar. The picture was a confusion of ships, the elements, and men;
but so had the battle been. Nevertheless, the critics voiced a widely
felt bewilderment:</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>Turner was all color, no line; even the color seemed to have been
splashed about formlessly, and yet made a subject in itself; the
edifices and the human beings on his canvases were blotches of
obscurity, dots denoting insignifi- cance, as if the artist had been
obsessed by the helplessness of man against a nature enraged. There were
pleasant exceptions, as in The Sun Rising through Mist (1807); but in
Hannibal Crossing the Alps (1812) all sense of man’s heroism seemed lost
in the black and yellow clouds swirling above soldiers cringing in fear.
Was this wild artist an enemy of the human race?</p>
<p>Turner went on his way wielding his brush “with force and verve,
appar- ently resolved to sweep man and life from the earth, leaving
nothing but sun, clouds, mountains, and raging seas. He was not entirely
a misanthrope; he was capable of warm affection, and developed a quiet
friendship with Sir Thomas Lawrence, his opposite in practice and
theory. But he recognized no nobility except genius, and had few
delusions about the common man. He liked nis work and his privacy,
feeling, like Leonardo, that “if you are all alone you will be all
yourself.” He had no ascertainable faith in any super- natural world.
His god was nature, and he gave it his kind of adoration — not of its
wisdom and beauty, as in Wordsworth, but of its pertinacity and power;
and he knew that it would engulf him too, and man, in its own grim time.
He did not bother much about morality. He had a mistress or two, but
kept them decently private. He made some nude drawings of an erotic
character; these, falling into Ruskin’s han d, were at once destroyed.
He loved money, commanded high fees, and left a fortune. He was a rough
diamond, solitaire.</p>
<p>His middle period (1820-33) began with a sun-pursuing trip to
Italy.</p>
<p>During those six months he made fifteen hundred drawings; after his
return to England he turned some of them into new essays in color,
light, and shade, like The Bay of Baiae (1823), where even the shadows
speak. Again inFrance (1821), he made illuminating watercolors of the
Seine. In 1825-26 he wandered through Belgium and Holland and brought
home sketches, some of which became the paintings Cologne and Dieppe,
now in the Frick Collection in New York. Occasionally, in the 1830s, he
enjoyed the hos- pitality of Lord Egremont at Petworth; as usual he hid
himself with his work, but he gave his host a moment’s immortality with
The Lake at Sunset.</p>
<p>In the final period (1834-45) °f his fertility he surrendered more
and more to the lure of light; recognizable objects almost disappeared;
what re- mained was a fascinated study of color, radiance, and shade.
Occasionally he let objects play a leading role, as in The Fighting T
enter air e Towed to Her Last Berth (1839) after many a blast for
Britain; or the proud locomotive announcing a century of iron horses in
Rain, Steam, and Speed ( 1 844). When the Houses of Parliament burned
down in 1834 Turner sat nearby, making sketches for his later painting
of the spectacle. Crossing from Har- wich his ship ran into a madness of
wind and snow; the aging artist had him- self lashed to the mast for
four hours that he might burn into his memory the details and terror of
the scene; 13 later he fused the confusion into a fury of white paint
called The Snowstorm (1842). Then (1843), as a final tri- umph, he
pictured The Sun of V enice Going Out to Sea.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII ) THE ARTS IN ENGLAND 385</p>
<p>His last years were darkened by a mounting consensus of condemnation,
mitigated by a paean of praise from a master of English prose. One
critic dismissed Th e Snowstorm as “soapsuds and whitewash”; 14 another
summed up the artist’s final period as the work of “a diseased eye and
reckless hand”; and Punch proposed a general title for any picture by
Turner: “A Typhoon Bursting in a Simoon over the Whirlpool of Maelstrom,
Norway, with a Ship on Fire, an Eclipse, and the Effect of a Lunar
Rainbow.” 15 After half a century of labor, the grand and brilliant
oeuvre seemed to be despised and rejected by the merciless judgment of
conservative taste.</p>
<p>Then, in May, 1843, John Ruskin, aged twenty-four, issued the first
vol- ume of Modern Painters, whose persistent and enthusiastic themes
were the superiority of William Turner over all other modern landscape
painters, and the complete veracity of Turner’s pictures as a report on
the external world. Turner was not offended to find himself exalted
above Claude Lor- rain, who had been the inspiration of his youth; but
as he read on he began to wonder would not this eulogy harm him by its
elongation and excess. For a time it did; critics lauded Ruskin’s prose
but questioned his judgment and counseled a more balanced view. Ruskin
was not to be restrained; he re- turned again and again, in volume after
volume, to the enterprise of defend- ing and expounding Turner, until he
had given the artist almost a third of the book’s two thousand pages. In
the end he won his battle, and lived to see his idol acclaimed as one of
the creative enlargers of modern art.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Turner died, December 19, 1851, and was buried in
St. Paul’s. His will left his artistic remains to the nation — three
hundred paintings, three hundred watercolors, nineteen thousand drawings
— and left his un- spent earnings, £ 140,000, to a fund for needy
artists. (His surviving rela- tives obtained annulment of the will, and
divided the money among them- selves and their lawyers.)</p>
<p>Perhaps his greatest legacy was his pictorial discovery of light. In
that same generation that heard Thomas Young formulate his wave theory
of light, Turner spread over Europe luminescent paintings and
watercolors proclaiming that light is an object as well as a medium, and
that it deserves representation in its diverse forms, colors,
components, and effects. This was impressionism before the
Impressionists; and perhaps Manet and Pissarro, when they visited London
in 1870, saw some of Turner’s spectacular illu - minations. 16 Seven
years later Degas, Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir sent to a London art
dealer a letter saying that in their studies of “the fugitive phe -
nomena of light” they did not forget that they had been “preceded in
this path by a great master of the English School, the illustrious
Turner.” 17</p>
