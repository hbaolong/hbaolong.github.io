<p>The Mental Elements of Civilization</p>
<p>I. LETTERS</p>
<p>Language — Its animal background — Its human origins — Its devel-</p>
<p>opment — Its results — Education — Initiation — W riting — Poetry</p>
<p>I N the beginning was the word, for with it man became man. Without
those strange noises called common nouns, thought was limited to in-
dividual objects or experiences sensorily — for the most part visually —
re- membered or conceived; presumably it could not think of classes as
distinct from individual things, nor of qualities as distinct from
objects, nor of objects as distinct from their qualities. Without words
as class names one might think of this man, or that man, or that man;
one could not think of Man, for the eye sees not Man but only men, not
classes but particular things. The beginning of humanity came when some
freak or crank, half animal and half man, squatted in a cave or in a
tree, cracking his brain to invent the first common noun, the first
sound-sign that would signify a group of like objects: house that would
mean all houses, man that would mean all men, light that would mean
every light that ever shone on land or sea. From that moment the mental
development of the race opened upon a new and endless road. For words
are to thought what tools are to work; the product depends largely on
the growth of the tools . 1</p>
<p>Since all origins are guesses, and de fontibus non disputandum,
the</p>
<p>imagination has free play in picturing the beginnings of speech.
Perhaps the first form of language — which may be defined as
communication through signs — was the love-call of one animal to
another. In this sense the jungle, the woods and the prairie are alive
with speech. Cries of warn- ing or of terror, the call of the mother to
the brood, the cluck and cackle of euphoric or reproductive ecstasy, the
parliament of chatter from tree to tree, indicate the busy preparations
made by the animal kingdom for the august speech of man. A wild girl
found living among the animals in a forest near Chalons, France, had no
other speech than hideous screeches and howls. These living noises of
the woods seem meaningless to our</p>
<p>7 *</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 73</p>
<p>provincial ear; we are like the philosophical poodle Riquet, who says
of M. Bergeret: “Everything uttered by my voice means something; but
from my master’s mouth comes much nonsense.” Whitman and Craig
discovered a strange correlation between the actions and the
exclamations of pigeons; Dupont learned to distinguish twelve specific
sounds used by fowl and doves, fifteen by dogs, and twenty-two by homed
cattle; Garner found that the apes carried on their endless gossip with
at least twenty different sounds, plus a repertory of gestures; and from
these modest vocabularies a few steps bring us to the three hundred
words that suffice some unpretentious men.’</p>
<p>Gesture seems primary, speech secondary, in the earlier transmission
of thought; and when speech fails, gesture comes again to the fore.
Among the North American Indians, who had countless dialects, married
couples were often derived from different tribes, and maintained
communication and accord by gestures rather than speech; one couple
known to Lewis Morgan used silent signs for three years. Gesture was so
prominent in some Indian languages that the Arapahos, like some modem
peoples, could hardly converse in the dark . 3 Perhaps the first human
words were interjections, expressions of emotion as among animals; then
demonstrative words accompanying gestures of direction; and imitative
sounds that came in time to be the names of the objects or actions that
they simulated. Even after indefinite millenniums of linguistic changes
and complications every language still contains hundreds of imitative
words — roar, rush, murmur, tremor, giggle, groan, hiss, heave, hum,
cackle, etc.* The Tecuna tribe, of ancient Brazil, had a perfect verb
for sneeze: haitschu? Out of such beginnings, perhaps, came the
root-words of every language. Renan reduced all Hebrew words to five
hundred roots, and Skeat nearly all European words to some four hundred
stems, t</p>

onomatopoeia still remains a refuge in linguistic emergencies. The
Englishman eating his first meal in China, and wishing to know the
character of the meat he was eat- ing, inquired, with Anglo-Saxon di
gnity and reserve, “Quack, quack?” To which the Chinaman, shaking his
head, answered cheerfully, “Bow - wow .” 4</h1>
<p>fE.g., divine is from Latin divus, which is from deus, Greek theos,
Sanskrit dev a, meaning god; in the Gypsy tongue the word for god, by a
strange prank, becomes devel. Historically goes back to the Sanskrit
root vid, to know; Greek oida, Latin video (see), French voir (see),
German wissen (know), English to wit; plus the suffixes tor (as in
author, praetor, rhetor ), ic, al, and ly ( =like ). Again, the Sanskrit
root ar, to plough, gives the Latin arare, Russian orati, English to ear
the land, arable, art , oar, and perhaps the word Aryan — the ploughers
. 9</p>
<p>74 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>The languages of nature peoples are not necessarily primitive in any
sense of simplicity; many of them are simple in vocabulary and
structure, but some of them are as complex and wordy as our own, and
more highly or- ganized than Chinese . 7 Nearly all primitive tongues,
however, limit them- selves to the sensual and particular, and are
uniformly poor in general or abstract terms. So the Australian natives
had a name for a dog’s tail, and an - other name for a cow’s tail; but
they had no name for tail in general . 8 The Tasmanians had separate
names for specific trees, but no general name for tree; the Choctaw
Indians had names for the black oak, the white oak and the red oak, but
no name for oak, much less for tree. Doubtless many gen- erations passed
before the proper noun ended in the common noun. In many tribes there
are no separate words for the color as distinct from the colored object;
no words for such abstractions as tone, sex, species, space, spirit,
instinct, reason, quantity, hope, fear, matter, consciousness, etc.®
Such abstract terms seem to grow in a reciprocal relation of cause and
effect with the development of thought; they become the tools of
subtlety and the symbols of civilization.</p>
<p>Bearing so many gifts to men, words seemed to them a divine boon and
a sacred thing; they became the matter of magic formulas, most
reverenced when most meaningless; and they still survive as sacred in
mysteries where, e.g., the Word becomes Flesh. They made not only for
clearer thinking, but for better social organization; they cemented the
generations mentally, by providing a better medium for education and the
transmission of knowl- edge and the arts; they created a new organ of
communication, by which one doctrine or belief could mold a people into
homogeneous unity. They opened new roads for the transport and traffic
of ideas, and immensely accelerated the tempo, and enlarged the range
and content, of life. Has any other in- vention ever equaled, in power
and glory, the common noun?</p>
<p>Next to the enlargement of thought the greatest of these gifts of
speech was education. Civilization is an accumulation, a treasure-house
of arts and wisdom, manners and morals, from which the individual, in
his devel- opment, draws nourishment for his mental life; without that
periodical reacquisition of the racial heritage by each generation,
civilization would die a sudden death. It owes its life to
education.</p>
<p>Education had few frills among primitive peoples; to them, as to the
animals, education was chiefly the transmission of skills and the
training of character; it was a wholesome relation of apprentice to
master in the ways of life. This direct and practical tutelage
encouraged a rapid growth in the</p>
<p>CHAP, v) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 75</p>
<p>primitive child. In the Omaha tribes the boy of ten had already
learned nearly all the arts of his father, and was ready for life; among
the Aleuts the boy of ten often set up his own establishment, and
sometimes took a wife; in Nigeria children of six or eight would leave
the parental house, build a hut, and provide for themselves by hunting
and fishing. 10 Usually this educational process came to an end with the
beginning of sexual life; the precocious maturity was followed by an
early stagnation. The boy, under such conditions, was adult at twelve
and old at twenty-five. 11 This does not mean that the “savage” had the
mind of a child; it only means that he had neither the needs nor the
opportunities of the modem child; he did not enjoy that long and
protected adolescence which allows a more nearly com- plete transmission
of the cultural heritage, and a greater variety and flexibility of
adaptive reactions to an artificial and unstable environment.</p>
<p>The environment of the natural man was comparatively permanent; it
called not for mental agility but for courage and character. The
primitive father put his trust in character, as modern education has put
its trust in intellect; he was concerned to make not scholars but men.
Hence the initia- tion rites which, among nature peoples, ordinarily
marked the arrival of the youth at maturity and membership in the tribe,
were designed to test cour- age rather than knowledge; their function
was to prepare the young for the hardships of war and the
responsibilities of marriage, while at the same time they indulged the
old in the delights of inflicting pain. Some of these initia- tion tests
are “too terrible and too revolting to be seen or told.” 13 Among the
Kaffirs (to take a mild example) the boys who were candidates for ma-
turity were given arduous work by day, and were prevented from sleeping
by night, until they dropped from exhaustion; and to make the matter
more certain they were scourged “frequently and mercilessly until blood
spurted from them.’’ A considerable prop ortion of the boys died as a
re- sult; but this seems to have been looked upon philosophically by the
elders, perhaps as an auxiliary anticipation of natural selection. 13
Usually these initiation ceremonies marked the end of adolescence and
the preparation for marriage; and the bride insisted that the bridegroom
should prove his capacity for suffering. In many tribes of the Congo the
initiation rite centered about circumcision; if the youth winced or
cried aloud his relatives were thrashed, and his promised bride, who had
watched the ceremony care- fully, rejected him scornfully, on the ground
that she did not want a girl for her husband. 14</p>
<p>Little or no use was made of writing in primitive education. Nothing
surprises the natural man so much as the ability of Europeans to com-
municate with one another, over great distances, by making black
scratches</p>
<p>76 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>upon a piece of paper . 15 Many tribes have learned to write by
imitating their civilized exploiters; but some, as in northern Africa,
have remained letterless despite five thousand years of intermittent
contact with literate nations. Simple tribes living for the most part in
comparative isolation, and knowing the happiness of having no history,
felt little need for writing. Their memories were all the stronger for
having no written aids; they learned and retained, and passed on to
their children by recitation, what- ever seemed necessary in the way of
historical record and cultural trans- mission. It was probably by
committing such oral traditions and folk-lore to writing that literature
began. Doubtless the invention of writing was met with a long and holy
opposition, as something calculated to undermine morals and the race. An
Egyptian legend relates that when the god Thoth revealed his discovery
of the art of writing to King Thamos, the good King denounced it as an
enemy of civilization. “Children and young</p>
<p>people,” protested the monarch, “who had hitherto been forced to
apply themselves diligently to learn and retain whatever was taught
them, would cease to apply themselves, and would neglect to exercise
their memories.” 1 ’ Of course we can only guess at the origins of this
wonderful toy. Per- haps, as we shall see, it was a by-product of
pottery, and began as identify- ing “trade - marks” on vessels of clay.
Probably a system of written signs was made necessary by the increase of
trade among the tribes, and its first forms were rough and conventional
pictures of commercial objects and accounts. As trade connected tribes
of diverse languages, some mutually intelligible mode of record and
communication became desirable. Pre- sumably the numerals were among the
earliest written symbols, usually taking the form of parallel marks
representing the fingers; we still call them fingers when we speak of
them as digits. Such words as five, the German ftinf and the Greek pente
go back to a root meaning hand ; 17 so the Roman numerals indicated
fingers, “V” represented an expanded hand, and “X” was merely two “V’s”
connected at their points. Writing was in its beginnings — as it still
is in China and Japan — a form of drawing, an art. As men used gestures
when they could not use words, so they used pictures to transmit their
thoughts across time and space; every word and every letter known to us
was once a picture, even as trade-marks and the signs of the zodiac are
to this day. The primeval Chinese pictures that preceded writing were
called ku-voan — literally, “gesture - pictures.” Totem poles were
pictograph writing; they were, as Mason suggests, tribal</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>autographs. Some tribes used notched sticks to help the memory</p>
<p>or to convey a message; others, like the Algonquin Indians, not only
notched the sticks but painted figures upon them, making them into min-
iature totem poles; or perhaps these poles were notched sticks on a
grandiose scale. The Peruvian Indians kept complex records, both of
numbers and ideas, by knots and loops made in diversely colored cords;
perhaps some light is shed upon the origins of the South American
Indians by the fact that a similar custom existed among the natives of
the Eastern Archipelago and Polynesia. Lao-tse, calling upon the Chinese
to return to the simple life, proposed that they should go back to their
primeval use of knotted cords . 18</p>
<p>More highly developed forms of writing appear sporadically among na-
ture men. Hieroglyphics have been found on Easter Island, in the South
Seas; and on one of the Caroline Islands a script has been discovered
which consists of fifty-one syllabic signs, picturing figures and ideas
. 19 Tradition tells how the priests and chiefs of Easter Island tried
to keep to themselves all knowledge of writing, and how the people
assembled annually to hear the tablets read; writing was obviously, in
its earlier stages, a mysterious and holy thing, a hieroglyph or sacred
carving. We cannot be sure that these Polynesian scripts were not
derived from some of the historic civilizations. In general, writing is
a sign of civilization, the least uncertain of the pre- carious
distinctions between civilized and primitive men.</p>
<p>Literature is at first words rather than letters, despite its name;
it arises as clerical chants or magic charms, recited usually by the
priests, and trans- mitted orally from memory to memory. Carmina , as
the Romans named poetry, meant both verses and charms; ode , among the
Greeks, meant originally a magic spell; so did the English rune and lay
, and the German Lied . Rhythm and meter, suggested, perhaps, by the
rhythms of nature and bodily life, were apparently developed by
magicians or shamans to pre- serve, transmit, and enhance the “magic
incantations of their verse .” 20 The Greeks attributed the first
hexameters to the Delphic priests, who were be- lieved to have invented
the meter for use in oracles . 21 Gradually, out of these sacerdotal
origins, the poet, the orator and the historian were differ- entiated
and secularized: the orator as the official lauder of the king or solic-
itor of the deity; the historian as the recorder of the royal deeds; the
poet as the singer of originally sacred chants, the formulator and
preserver of heroic legends, and the musician who put his tales to music
for the instruction of populace and kings. So the Fijians, the Tahitians
and the New Cale-</p>
<p>donians had official orators and narrators to make addresses on
occasions of</p>

<p>Origins — Mathematics — Astronomy — Medicine — Surgery</p>
<p>In the opinion of Herbert Spencer, that supreme expert in the
collection of evidence post judicium , science, like letters, began with
the priests, originated in astronomic observations, governing religious
festivals, and was preserved in the temples and transmitted across the
generations as part of the clerical heritage . 23 We cannot say, for
here again beginnings elude us, and we may only surmise. Perhaps
science, like civilization in general, began with agriculture; geometry,
as its name indicates, was the measurement of the soil; and the
calculation of crops and seasons, necessi- tating the observation of the
stars and the construction of a calendar, may have generated astronomy.
Navigation advanced astronomy, trade de- veloped mathematics, and the
industrial arts laid the bases of physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 79</p>
<p>Counting was probably one of the earliest forms of speech, and in
many tribes it still presents a relieving simplicity. The Tasmanians
counted up to two: “Parmery, calabawa, cardia”— i.e., “one, two,
plenty”; the Gua - ranis of Brazil adventured further and said: “One,
two, three, four, in - numerable.” The New Holland ers had no words for
three or jour; three they called “two - one”; jour was “two - two.”
Damara natives would not exchange two sheep for four sticks, but
willingly exchanged, twice in succession, one sheep for two sticks.
Counting was by the fingers; hence the decimal system. When — apparently
after some time — the idea of twelve was reached, the number became a
favorite because it was so pleasantly divisible by five of the first six
digits; and that duodecimal system was bom which obstinately survives in
English measurements today: twelve months in a year, twelve pence in a
shilling, twelve units in a dozen, twelve dozen in a gross, twelve
inches in a foot. Thirteen, on the other hand, refused to be divided,
and became disreputable and unlucky forever. Toes added to fingers
created the idea of twenty or a score; the use of this unit in reckoning
lingers in the French quatre-vingt (four twenties) for</p>
<p>eighty .“ Other parts of the body served as standards of measurement:
a hand for a “span,” a thumb for an inch (in French the two words are
the same), an elbow for a “cubit,” an arm for an “ell,” a foot for a
foot. At an early date pebbles were added to fingers as an aid in
counting; the survival of the abacus, and of the “little stone”
(calculus) conce aled in the word calculate, reveal to us how small,
again, is the gap between the simplest and the latest men. Thoreau
longed for this primitive simplicity, and well expressed a universally
recurrent mood: “An honest man has hardly need to count more than his
ten fingers, or, in extreme cases he may add his toes, and lump the
rest. I say, let our affairs be as two or three, and not as a hundred or
a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your
accounts on your thumb- nail .” 25</p>
<p>The measurement of time by the movements of the heavenly bodies was
probably the beginning of astronomy; the very word measure, like the
word month (and perhaps the word man — the measurer), goes back
apparently to a root denoting the moon.” Men measured time by moons long
before they counted it by years; the sun, like the father, was a com-
paratively late discovery; even today Easter is reckoned according to
the phases of the moon. The Polynesians had a calendar of thirteen
months, regulated by the moon; when their lunar year diverged too
flagrantly</p>
<p>80 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>from the procession of the seasons they dropped a moon, and the
balance was restored” But such sane uses of the heavens were
exceptional;</p>
<p>astrology antedated — and perhaps will survive — astronomy; simple
souls are more interested in telling futures than in telling time. A
myriad of super- stitions grew up anent the influence of the stars upon
human character and fate; and many of these superstitions flourish in
our own day.* Per- haps they are not superstitions, but only another
kind of error than science.</p>
<p>Natural man formulates no physics, but merely practises it; he cannot
plot the path of a projectile, but he can aim an arrow well; he has no
chemical symbols, but he knows at a glance which plants are poison and
which are food, and uses subtle herbs to heal the ills of the flesh.
Perhaps we should employ another gender here, for probably the first
doctors were women; not only because they were the natural nurses of the
men, nor merely because they made midwifery, rather than venality, the
oldest profession, but because their closer connection with the soil
gave them a superior knowledge of plants, and enabled them to develop
the art of medicine as distinct from the magic-mongering of the priests.
From the earliest days to a time yet within our memory, it was the woman
who healed. Only when the woman failed did the primitive sick resort to
the medicine-man and the shaman J*</p>
<p>It is astonishing how many cures primitive doctors effected despite
their theories of disease.” To these simple people disease seemed to be
possession of the body by an alien power or spirit — a conception not
essentially differ- ent from the germ theory which pervades medicine
today. The most popular method of cure was by some magic incantation
that would pro- pitiate the evil spirit or drive it away. How perennial
this form of therapy is may be seen in the story of the Gadarene swine.”
a Even now epilepsy is regarded by many as a possession; some
contemporary religions prescribe forms of exorcism for banishing
disease, and prayer is recognized by most living people as an aid to
pills and drugs. Perhaps the primitive practice was based, as much as
the most modern, on the healing power of sugges- tion. The tricks of
these early doctors were more dramatic than those of their more
civilized successors: they tried to scare off the possessing demon by
assuming terrifying masks, covering themselves with the skins</p>

<p>of animals, shouting, raving, slapping their hands, shaking rattles,
and sucking the demon out through a hollow tube; as an old adage put it,
“Nature cures the disease while the remedy amuses the patient.” The
Brazilian Bororos carried the science to a higher stage by having the
father take the medicine in order to cure the sick child; almost
invariably the child got well. 80</p>
<p>Along with medicative herbs we find in the vast pharmacopoeia of</p>
<p>primitive man an assortment of soporific drugs calculated to ease
pain or to facilitate operations. Poisons like curare (used so
frequently on the</p>
<p>tips of arrows), and drugs like hemp, opium and eucalyptus are older
than history; one of our most popular anesthetics goes back to the
Peruvian use of coca for this purpose. Cartier tells how the Iroquois
cured scurvy with the bark and leaves of the hemlock spruce. 81
Primitive surgery knew a variety of operations and instruments.
Childbirth was well managed; fractures and wounds were ably set and
dressed. 88 By means of obsidian knives, or sharpened flints, or fishes’
teeth, blood was let, abscesses were drained, and tissues were
scarified. Trephining of the skull was practised by primitive
medicine-men from the ancient Peruvian Indians to the modem Melanesians;
the latter averaged nine successes out of every ten operations, while in
1786 the same operation was invariably fatal at the Hotel-Dieu in Paris.

<p>We smile at primitive ignorance while we submit anxiously to the ex-
pensive therapeutics of our own day. As Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>
<p>wrote, after a lifetime of healing:</p>
<p>There is nothing men will not do, there is nothing they have not</p>
<p>done, to recover their health and save their lives. They have

<p>mitted to be half-drowned in water and half-choked with gases, to</p>
<p>be buried up to their chins in earth, to be seared with hot irons
like</p>
<p>galley-slaves, to be crimped with knives like codfish, to have
needles thrust into their flesh, and bonfires kindled on their skin, to
swallow all sorts of abominations, and to pay for all this as if to be
singed</p>
<p>and scalded were a costly privilege, as if blisters were a blessing
and leeches a luxury. 8 *</p>

<p>Summary of the primitive preparation for</p>
<p>civilization</p>
<p>After fifty thousand years of art men still dispute as to its sources
in instinct and in history. What is beauty? — why do we admire it? — why
do we endeavor to create it? Since this is no place for psychological
discourse we shall answer, briefly and precariously, that beauty is any
quality by which an object or a form pleases a beholder. Primarily and
originally the object does not please the beholder because it is
beautiful, but rather he calls it beautiful because it pleases him. Any
object that satisfies desire will seem beautiful: food is beautiful —
Thais is not beautiful — to a starving man. The pleasing object may as
like as not be the beholder himself; in our secret hearts no other form
is quite so fair as ours, and art begins with the adornment of one’s own
exquisi te body. Or the pleasing object may be the desired mate; and
then the esthetic — beauty-feeling — sense takes on the in- tensity and
creativeness of sex, and spreads the aura of beauty to every- thing that
concerns the beloved one — to all forms that resemble her, all colors
that adorn her, please her or speak of her, all ornaments</p>
<p>and garments that become her, all shapes and motions that recall</p>
<p>her symmetry and grace. Or the pleasing form may be a desired</p>
<p>male; and out of the attraction that here draws frailty to worship
strength comes that sense of sublimity — satisfaction in the presence of
power — which creates the loftiest art of all. Finally nature herself —
with our cooperation — may become both sublime and beautiful; not only
because it simulates and suggests all the tenderness of women and all
the strength of men, but because we project into it our own feelings and
fortunes, our love of others and of ourselves — relishing in it the
scenes of our youth, enjoying its quiet solitude as an escape from the
storm of life, living with it through its almost human seasons of green
youth, hot maturity, “mellow fruitfulness” and cold decay, and
recognizing it vaguely as the mother that lent us life and will receive
us in our death.</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 83</p>
<p>Art is the creation of beauty; it is the expression of thought or
feeling in a form that seems beautiful or sublime, and therefore arouses
in us some reverberation of that primordial delight which woman gives to
man, or man to woman. The thought may be any capture of life’s
significance, the feel - ing may be any arousal or release of life’s
tensions. The form may satisfy us through rhythm, which falls in
pleasantly with the alternations of our breath, the pulsation of our
blood, and the majestic oscillations of winter and summer, ebb and flow,
night and day; or the form may please us through symmetry, which is a
static rhythm, standing for strength and recalling to us the ordered
proportions of plants and animals, of women and men; or it may please us
through color, which brightens the spirit or intensifies life; or
finally the form may please us through veracity — be- cause its lucid
and transparent imitation of nature or reality catches some mortal
loveliness of plant or animal, or some transient meaning of circum-
stance, and holds it still for our lingering enjoyment or leisurely
under- standing. From these many sources come those noble superfluities
of life — song and dance, music and drama, pottery and painting,
sculpture and architecture, literature and philosophy. For what is
philosophy but an art —one more attempt to give “significant form” to
the chaos of experience?</p>
<p>If the sense of beauty is not strong in primitive society it may be
because the lack of delay between sexual desire and fulfilment gives no
time for that imaginative enhancement of the object which makes so much
of the object’s beauty. Primitive man seldom thinks of selecting women
because of what we should call their beauty; he thinks rather of their
usefulness, and never dreams of rejecting a strong-armed bride because
of her ugli- ness. The Indian chief, being asked which of his wives was
loveliest,</p>
<p>apologized for never having thought of the matter. “Their faces,” he
said, with the m ature wisdom of a Franklin, “might be more or less
handsome, but in other respects women are all the same.” Where a sense
of beauty is present in primitive man it sometimes eludes us by being so
different from our own. “All Negro races that I know,” says Reichard,
“account a woman beautiful who is not constricted at the waist, and when
the body from the arm-pits to the hips is the same breadth — ‘like a
ladder,’ says the Coast Negro.” Elephantine ears and an overhanging
stomach are feminine charms to some African males; and throughout Africa
it is the fat woman who is accounted loveliest. In Nigeria, says Mungo
Park, “corpulence and beauty seem to be terms nearly synonymous. A woman
of even moderate</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>pretensions must be one who cannot walk without a slave under each
arm to support her; and a perfect beauty is a load for a camel.” “Most
savages,” says Briffault, “have a preference for what we should regard
as one of the most unsightly features in a woman’s form, namely, long,
hanging breasts .” 35 “It is well known,” says Darwin, “that with many
Hottentot</p>
<p>Indeed it is highly probable that the natural male thinks of beauty
in terms of himself rather than in terms of woman; art begins at home.
Primi- tive men equaled modern men in vanity, incredible as this will
seem to women. Among simple peoples, as among animals, it is the male
rather than the female that puts on ornament a nd mutilates his body for
beauty’s sake. In Australia, says Bonwick, “adornments are almost
entirely monop - olized by men”; so too in Melanesia, New Guinea, New
Caledonia, New Britain, New Hanover, and among the North American
Indians . 37 In some tribes more time is given to the adornment of the
body than to any other business of the day . 33 Apparently the first
form of art is the artificial color- ing of the body — sometimes to
attract women, sometimes to frighten foes. The Australian native, like
the latest American belle, always carried with him a provision of white,
red, and yellow paint for touching up his beauty now and then; and when
the supply threatened to run out he undertook expeditions of some
distance and danger to renew it. On ordinary days he contented himself
with a few spots of color on his cheeks, his shoulders and his breast;
but on festive occasions he felt shamefully nude unless his entire body
was painted.”</p>
<p>In some tribes the men reserved to themselves the right to paint the
body; in others the married .women were forbidden to paint their necks.“
But women were not long in acquiring the oldest of the arts — cosmetics.
When Captain Cook dallied in New Zealand he noticed that his sailors,
when they returned from their adventures on shore, had artificially red
or yellow noses; the paint of the native Helens had stuck to them .* 1
The</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 85</p>
<p>Fellatah ladies of Central Africa spent several hours a day over
their toilette: they made their fingers and toes purple by keeping them
wrapped all night in henna leaves; they stained their teeth alternately
with blue, yellow, and purple dyes; they colored their hair with indigo,
and penciled their eyelids with sulphuret of antimony . 43 Every Bongo
lady carried in her dressing- case tweezers for pulling out eyelashes
and eyebrows, lancet-shaped hair- pins, rings and bells, buttons and
clasps . 48</p>
<p>The primitive soul, like the Periclean Greek, fretted over the
transi-</p>
<p>toriness of painting, and invented tattooing, scarification and
clothing as more permanent adornments. The women as well as the men, in
many tribes, submitted to the coloring needle, and bore without
flinching even the tat- tooing of their lips. In Greenland the mothers
tattooed their daughters early, the sooner to get them married off . 44
Most often, however, tattooing itself was considered insufficiently
visible or impressive, and a number of tribes on every continent
produced deep scars on their flesh to make them- selves lovelier to
their fellows, or more discouraging to their enemies. As Theophile
Gautier put it, “having no clothes to embroider, they embroid - ered
their skins .” 45 Flints or mussel shells cut the flesh, and often a
ball of earth was placed within the wound to enlarge the scar. The
Torres Straits natives wore huge scars like epaulets; the Abeokuta cut
themselves to pro- duce scars imitative of lizards, alligators or
tortoises . 40 “There is,” says Georg, “no part of the body that has not
been p erfected, decorated, dis- figured, painted, bleached, tattooed,
reformed, stretched or squeezed, out of vanity or desire for ornament .”
47 The Botocudos derived their name from a plug ( botoque ) which they
inserted into the lower lip and the ears in the eighth year of life, and
repeatedly replaced with a larger plug until the opening was as much as
four inches in diameter . 48 Hottentot women trained the labia minora to
assume enoromous lengths, so producing at last the “Hottentot apron” so
greatly admired by their men . 49 Ear-rings and nose-rings were de
rigueur; the natives of Gippsland believed that one who died without a
nose-ring would suffer horrible torments in the next life . 50 It is all
very barbarous, says the modern lady, as she bores her ears for rings,
paints her lips and her cheeks, tweezes her eyebrows, reforms her
eyelashes, powders her face, her neck and her arms, and compresses her
feet. The tattooed sailor speaks with superior sympathy of the “savages”
he has known; and the Continental student, horrified by primitive
mutilations, sports his honorific scars.</p>
<p>Clothing was apparently, in its origins, a form of ornament, a sexual
deterrent or charm rather than an article of use against cold or shame .
61</p>
<p>86 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. V</p>
<p>The Cimbri were in the habit of tobogganing naked over the snow . 62
When Darwin, pitying the nakedness of the Fuegians, gave one of them a
red cloth as a protection against the cold, the native tore it into
strips, which he and his companions then used as ornaments; as Cook had
said of them, tunelessly, they were “content to be naked, but ambitious
to be fine .” 58 In like manner the ladies of the Orinoco cut into
shreds the materials given them by the Jesuit Fathers for clothing; they
wore the ribbons so made around their necks, but insisted that “they
would be ashamed to wear clothing .” 54 An old author describes the
Brazilian natives as usually naked, and adds: “Now alreadie some doe
weare apparell, but esteem it so lit tle that they weare it rather for
fashion than for honesties sake, and because they are commanded to weare
it; … as is well seene by some that some- times come abroad with
certaine garments no further than the navell, with- out any other thing,
or others onely a cap on their heads, and leave the other garments at
home .” 85 When clothing became something more than an adornment it
served partly to indicate the married status of a loyal wife, partly to
accentuate the form and beauty of woman. For the most part primitive
women asked of clothing precisely what later women have asked — not that
it should quite cover their nakedness, but that it should enhance or
suggest their charms. Everything changes, except woman and man.</p>
<p>From the beginning both sexes preferred ornaments to clothing. Primi-
tive trade seldom deals in necessities; it is usually confined to
articles of adornment or play.“ Jewelry is one of the most ancient
elements of civili- zation; in tombs twenty thousand years old, shells
and teeth have been found strung into necklaces.” From simple beginnings
such embellishments soon reached impressive proportions, and played a
lofty role in life. The Galla women wore rings to the weight of six
pounds, and some Dinka women carried half a hundredweight of decoration.
One African belle wore cop- per rings which became hot under the sun, so
that she had to employ an attendant to shade or fan her. The Queen of
the Wabunias on the Congo wore a brass collar weighing twenty pounds;
she had to lie down every now and then to rest. Poor women who were so
unfortunate as to have only light jewelry imitated carefully the steps
of those who carried great burdens of bedizenment . 68</p>
<p>The first source of art, then, is akin to the display of colors and
plumage on the male animal in mating time; it lies in the desire to
adorn and beautify</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 87</p>
<p>the body. And just as self-love and mate-love, overflowing, pour out
their surplus of affection upon nature, so the impulse to beautify
passes from the personal to the external world. The soul seeks to
express its feeling in objec- tive ways, through color and form; art
really begins when men undertake to beautify things. Perhaps its first
external medium was potte ry. The potter’s wheel, like writing and the
state, belongs to the historic civilizations; but even without it
primitive men — or rather women — lifted this ancient industry to an
art, and achieved merely with clay, water and deft fingers an
astonishing sym- metry of form; witness the pottery fashioned by the
Baronga of South Africa , 89 or by the Pueblo Indians.“</p>
<p>When the potter applied colored designs to the surface of the vessel
he had formed, he was creating the art of painting. In primitive hands
painting is not yet an independent art; it exists as an adjunct to
pottery and statuary. Nature men made colors out of clay, and the
Andamanese made oil colors by mixing ochre with oils or fats . 61 Such
colors were used to ornament weapons, imple- ments, vases, clothing, and
buildings. Many hunting tribes of Africa and Oceania painted upon the
walls of their caves or upon neighboring rocks vivid representations of
the animals that they sought in the chase . 82</p>
<p>Sculpture, like painting, probably owed its origin to pottery: the
potter found that he could mold not only articles of use, but imitative
figures that might serve as magic amulets, and then as things of beauty
in themselves. The Eskimos carved caribou antlers and walrus ivory into
figurines of animals and men . 68 Again, primitive man sought to mark
his hut, or a totem-pole, or a grave with some image that would indicate
the object worshiped, or tfie person deceased; at first he carved merely
a face upon a post, then a head, then the whole post; and through this
filial marking of graves sculpture be- came an art . 64 So the ancient
dwellers on Easter Island topped with enormous monolithic statues the
vaults of their dead; scores of such statues, many of them twenty feet
high, have been found there; some, now prostrate in ruins, were
apparently sixty feet tall.</p>
<p>How did architecture begin? We can hardly apply so magnificent a term
to the construction of the primitive hut; for architecture is not mere
building, but beautiful building. It began when for the first time a man
or a woman thought of a dwelling in terms of appearance as well as of
use. Probably this effort to give beauty or sublimity to a structure was
directed first to graves rather than to homes; while the commemorative
pillar developed into statuary, the tomb grew into a temple. For to
primitive thought the dead were more important and powerful than the
living; and, besides, the dead could remain settled in one place, while
the living wandered too often to warrant their raising permanent
homes.</p>
<p>Even in early days, and probably long before he thought of carving
objects or building tombs, man found pleasure in rhythm, and began to
develop the</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. V</p>
<p>crying and warbling, the prancing and preening, of the animal into
song and dance. Perhaps, like the animal, he sang before he learned to
talk , 05 and danced as early as he sang. Indeed no art so characterized
or expressed primitive man as the dance. He developed it from primordial
simplicity to a complexity unrivaled in civilization, and varied it into
a thousand forms. The great festivals of the tribes were celebrated
chiefly with communal and in- dividual dancing; great wars were opened
with martial steps and chants; the great ceremonies of religion were a
mingling of song, drama and dance. What seems to us now to be forms of
play were probably serious matters to early men; they danced not merely
to express themselves, but to offer suggestions to nature or the gods;
for example, the periodic incitation to abundant repro- duction was
accomplished chiefly through the hypnotism of the dance. Spencer derived
the dance from the ritual of welcoming a victorious chief home from the
wars; Freud derived it from the natural expression of sensual desire,
and the group technique of erotic stimulation; if one should assert,
with similar narrowness, that the dance was born of sacred rites and
mummeries, and then merge the three theories into one, there might
result as definite a conception of the origin of the dance as can be
attained by us today.</p>
<p>From the dance, we may believe, came instrumental music and the
drama. The making of such music appears to arise out of a desire to mark
and accen- tuate with sound the rhythm of the dance, and to intensify
with shrill or rhythmic notes the excitement necessary to patriotism or
procreation. The instruments were limited in range and accomplishment,
but almost endless in variety: native ingenuity exhausted itself in
fashioning horns, trumpets, gongs, tamtams, clappers, rattles,
castanets, flutes and drums from horns, skins, shells, ivory, brass,
copper, bamboo and wood; and it ornamented them with elabo- rate carving
and coloring. The taut string of the bow became the origin of a hundred
instruments from the primitive lyre to the Stradivarius violin and the
modern pianoforte. Professional singers, like professional dancers,
arose among the tribes; and vague scales, predominantly minor in tone,
were de- veloped . 06</p>
<p>With music, song and dance combined, the “savage” created for us the
drama and the opera. For the primitive dance was frequently devoted to
mimicry; it imitated, most simply, the movements of animals and men, and
passed to the mimetic performance of actions and events. So some
Australian tribes staged a sexual dance around a pit ornamented with
shrubbery to rep- resent the vulva, and, after ecstatic and erotic
gestures and prancing, cast their spears symbolically into the pit. The
northwestern tribes of the same island played a drama of death and
resurrection differing only in simplicity from the medieval mystery and
modern Passion plays: the dancers slowly sank to the ground, hid their
heads under the boughs they carried, and simulated</p>
<p>CHAP. V) MENTAL ELEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION 89</p>
<p>death; then, at a sign from their leader, they rose abruptly in a
wild triumphal chant and dance announcing the resurrection of the soul.”
In like manner a thousand forms of pantomime described events
significant to the history of the tribe, or actions important in the
individual life. When rhythm dis- appeared from these performances the
dance passed into the drama, and one of the greatest of art-forms was
born.</p>
<p>In these ways precivilized men created the forms and bases of
civiliza- tion. Looking backward upon this brief survey of primitive
culture, we find every element of civilization except writing and the
state. All the modes of economic life are invented for us here: hunting
and fishing, herd- ing and tillage, transport and building, industry and
commerce and finance. All the simpler structures of political life are
organized: the clan, the fam- ily, the village community, and the tribe;
freedom and order — those hostile foci around which civilization
revolves — find their first adjustment and rec- onciliation; law and
justice begin. The fundamentals of morals are estab- lished: the
training of children, the regulation of the sexes, the inculcation of
honor and decency, of manners and loyalty. The bases of religion are
laid, and its hopes and terrors are applied to the encouragement of
morals and the strengthening of the group. Speech is developed into
complex languages, medicine and surgery appear, and modest beginnings
are made in science, literature and art. All in all it is a picture of
astonishing creation, of form rising out of chaos, of one road after
another being opened from the animal to the sage. Without these
“savages,” and their hundred thou - sand years of experiment and
groping, civilization could not have been. We owe almost everything to
them — as a fortunate, and possibly degen- erate, youth inherits the
means to culture, security and ease through the long toil of an
unlettered ancestry.</p>
