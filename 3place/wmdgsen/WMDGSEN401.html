<h4 id="chapter-xvii">CHAPTER XVII</h4>
<p>Julius II</p>
<p>1 5 ° 3 _I 3</p>
<p>I. THE WARRIOR</p>
<p>I F we place before us Raphael’s searching and profound portrait of
Ju - lius II, we shall see at once that Giuliano della Rovere was one of
the strongest personalities that ever reached the papal chair. A massive
head bent with exhaustion and tardy humility, a wide high brow, a large
pug- nacious nose, grave, deep-set, penetrating eyes, lips tight with
resolution, hands heavy with the rings of authority, face somber with
the disillusion- ments of power: this is the man who for a decade kept
Italy in war and turmoil, freed it from foreign armies, tore down the
old St. Peter’s, brought Bramante and a hundred other artists to Rome,
discovered, developed, and directed Michelangelo and Raphael, and
through them gave to the world a new St. Peter’s and the Sistine Chapel
ceiling, and the stanze of the Vatican.</p>
<p>His violent temper presumably characterized him from his first
breath. Born near Savona (1443) a nephew of Sixtus IV, he reached the
cardinalate at twenty-seven, and fumed and fretted in it for
thirty-three years before being promoted to what had long seemed to him
his manifest due. He paid no more regard to his vow of celibacy than
most of his colleagues; 1 his master of ceremonies at the Vatican later
reported that Pope Julius would not allow his foot to be kissed because
it was disfigured ex morbo gallico — with the French disease. 2 He had
three illegitimate daughters, 3 but he was too busy fighting Alexander
to find time for the unconcealed parental fondness that in Alexander so
offended the cherished hypocrisies of man- kind. He disliked Alexander
as a Spanish intruder, denied his fitness for the papacy, called him a
swindler and a usurper, 4 and did all he could to unseat him, even to
inviting France to invade Italy.</p>
<p>He seemed made as a foil and contrast to Alexander. The Borgia Pope
was jovial, sanguine, good-natured (if we except a possible poisoning or
two); Julius was stern, Jovian, passionate, impatient, readily moved to
anger, passing from one fight to another, never really happy except at
war.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>Alexander waged war by proxy, Julius in person; the sexagenarian Pope
became a soldier, more at ease in military garb than in pontifical
robes, loving camps and besieging towns, having guns pointed and
assaults de- livered under his commanding eyes. Alexander could play,
but Julius moved from one enterprise to another, never resting.
Alexander could be a diplomat; Julius found it extremely difficult, for
he liked to tell people what he thought of them; “often his language
overstepped all bounds in its rudeness and violence,” and “ this fault
increased perceptibly as he grew older.” 5 His courage, like his
language, knew no limits; stricken with illness time and again in his
campaigns, he would confound his enemies by recov- ering and leaping
upon them once more.</p>
<p>Like Alexander, he had had to buy a few cardinals to ease his way to
the papacy, but he denounced the practice in a bull of 1505. If in this
matter he did not reform with inconvenient precipitation, he rejected
nepotism al- most completely, and rarely appointed relatives to office.
In selling church benefices and promotions, however, he followed
Alexander’s example, and his grants of indulgences shared with the
building of St. Peter’s in angering Germany. 6 He managed his revenues
well, financed war and art simultane- ously, and left Leo a surplus in
the treasury. In Rome he restored social order, which had declined in
Alexander’s later years, and he governed the States of the Church with
wise appointments and policies. He allowed the Orsini and the Colonna to
reoccupy their castles, and sought to tie these powerful families to
loyalty by marriages with his relatives.</p>
<p>When he came to power he found the States of the Church in turmoil,
and half the work of Alexander and Caesar Borgia undone. Venice had
seized Faenza, Ravenna, and Rimini (1503); Giovanni Sforza had returned
to Pesaro; the Baglioni were again sovereign in Perugia and the
Bentivogli in Bologna; the loss of revenues from these cities threatened
the solvency of the Curia. Julius agreed with Alexander that the
spiritual independence of the Church required her continued possession
of the Papal States; and he began with Alexander’s mistake by asking the
help of France— and of Germany and Spain to boot — against his Italian
enemies. France consented to send eight thousand men in exchange for
three red hats; Naples, Mantua, Urbino, Ferrara, and Florence pledged
small detachments. In August, 1506, Julius left Rome at the head of his
own modest force — four hundred cavalry, his Swiss guards, and four
cardinals. Guidobaldo, the restored Duke of Urbino, was in military
command of the papal troops, but the Pope rode at their head in person —
a sight not seen in Italy for many cen- turies past. Gianpaolo Baglioni,
calculating that he could not defeat such a</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>443</p>
<p>coalition, came to Orvieto, surrendered to the Pope, and asked
forgiveness. “I forgive your mortal sins,” growled Julius, “but the
first venial sin you commit, I will make you pay for them all.” 7
Trusting to h is religious au- thority, Julius entered Perugia with only
a small guard, and before his soldiers could reach the gates; Baglioni
might have ordered his men to arrest him and close the gates, but he
dared not. Machiavelli, who was on hand, marveled tha t Baglioni should
lose a chance “to do a deed which would have left an eternal memory. He
might have been the first to show priests how little a man is esteemed
who lives and rules as they do. He would have done a deed whose
greatness would have outweighed all its infamy and all the danger which
might have followed.” 8 Machiavelli, like most Italians, objected to the
temporal power of the papacy, and to popes who were also kings. But
Baglioni valued his neck, and possibly his soul, more than his
posthumous fame.</p>
<p>Julius spent little time in Perugia; his real goal was Bologna. He
led his little army over the rough roads of the Apennines to Cesena, and
then turned upon Bologna from the east while the French attacked it from
the west. Julius reinforced the attack by issuing a bull of
excommunication against the Bentivogli and their adherents, and offering
a plenary indulgence to any man who should kill any of them; this was a
new brand of war. Giovanni Bentivoglio fled, and Julius entered the city
borne in a litter on men’s shoulders, and hailed by the people as a
liberator from tyranny (Nov. ii, 1506). He bade Michelangelo make a
colossal statue of him for the portal of San Petronio, and then returned
to Rome. There he rode through the streets in a triumphal car, and was
greeted as a victorious Caesar.</p>
<p>But Venice still held Faenza, Ravenna, Rimini, and failed to estimate
properly the martial spirit of the Pope. Risking Italy to get the
Romagna, Julius invited France, Germany, and Spain to help him subdue
the Queen of the Adriatic. We shall see later how vigorously they
responded in the League of Cambrai (1508) — seeking not to help Julius
but to dismember Italy; in joining them Julius allowed his justifiable
resentment against Ven- ice to overcome his love of Italy. While his
allies attacked Venice with armies, Julius aimed at her one of the most
forthright bulls of excommuni- cation and interdict in history. He won;
Venice restored the stolen cities to the Church, and accepted the most
humiliating terms; her envoys re- ceived absolution, and the removal of
the interdict, in a long ceremony that sorely tried their knees (1510).
Regretting his invitation to the French, Julius now reversed his policy
to expelling them from Italy, and convinced himself that God was
reversing the divine policy accordingly. When the</p>
<p>444 THE Renaissance (chap, xvii</p>
<p>French ambassador announced to him a French victory over the
Venetians, and added, “God willed it,” Julius angrily retorted, “The
devil willed it!” 9</p>
<p>Now he turned his martial eye to Ferrara. Here was an acknowledged
papal fief, but through Alexander’s concessions at Lucrezia’s betrothal
it paid only a token tribute to the papacy; moreover Duke Alfonso, after
joining in war against Veni ce at the Pope’s behest, refused to make
peace at his behest, and remained an ally of France. Julius resolved
that Ferrara must become wholly a papal state. He began his campaign
with another bull of excommunication (1510), by which the son-in-law of
one pope became to another a “son of iniquity and a root of perdition.”
Without much difficulty Julius, with Venetian aid, took Modena. While
his troops were resting there the Pope made the mistake of going to
Bologna. Sud- denly news came to him that a French army, instructed to
help Alfonso, was at the gates. The papal forces were too distant to
help him; within Bologna were only nine hundred soldiers; and the people
of the city, who had been oppressed by the papal legate Cardinal
Alidosi, could not be relied upon to offer resistance to the French.
Sick abed with fever, Julius for a moment despaired, and thought of
drinking poison; 10 he was about to sign a humiliating peace with France
when Spanish and Venetian reinforcements arrived. The French retreated,
and Julius sped them on their way with a lusty excommunication for one
and all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ferrara had armed itself so strongly that Julius judged his
forces inadequate to take it. Not to be cheated of military glory, he
led his troops in person to besiege Mirandola, a northern outpost of the
Ferrara duchy ( 1 5 1 1 ) . Though now sixty-eight he tramped through
deep snow, violated precedent by campaigning in winter, presided over
councils of strategy, directed operations and the placement of cannon,
inspected his troops, relished the life of a soldier, and let no man
surpass him in martial oaths and jests. 11 Sometimes the troops laughed
at him; more often they applauded his courage. When enemy fire killed a
servant at his side, he move d to other quarters; when these too were
reached by Mirandola’s artillery, he returned to his first station,
shrugging his bent shoulders at the danger of death. Mirandola
surrendered after two weeks of resistance. The Pope ordered that all
French soldiers found in the city should be put to death; perhaps by
mutual arrangement none was found. He protected the city from pillage,
and preferred to feed and finance his army by selling eight new
cardinalates. 12</p>
<p>He sought rest in Bologna, but there he was soon again besieged by
the French. He fled to Rimini, and the French restored the Bentivogli
to</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>445</p>
<p>power. The people cheered the return of their ousted despots; they
de- molished the castle that Julius had built, threw down the statue
that Mi- chelangelo had made of him, and sold it as bronze scrap to
Alfonso of Ferrara; the grim Duke cast it into a cannon, which he
christened La Giulia in honor of the Pope. Julius launched another bull,
excommunicating all who had shared in the overthrow of papal authority
at Bologna. The French troops responded by retaking Mirandola. At Rimini
Julius found affixed to the door of San Francesco a document signed by
nine cardinals, which summoned a general council to meet at Pisa on
September i, 15 1 1, to examine into the conduct of the Pope.</p>
<p>Julius returned to Rome broken in health, overwhelmed with disaster,
but not bowing to defeat. Says Guicciardini:</p>
<p>Though the Pontiff found himself so grossly deceived by his flat-</p>
<p>tering hopes, yet he seemed in his deportment to resemble what the
fabulous writers have reported of Antaeus, who, as often as he was
disabled by the force of Hercules, on touching the ground recovered
still greater strength and vigor. Adversity had the same effect on the
Pope; for when he seemed to be most depressed and most dejected, he
recovered his spirits, and rose again with greater firmness and con-
stancy of mind, and with more pertinacious resolution. 13</p>
<p>To counter the disaffected cardinals, he published a call for a
general coun- cil to meet at the Lateran Palace on April 19, 1512. He
labored night and day to build a formidable alliance against France. He
was approaching success when he was seized with a severe illness (August
17, 1511). For three days he hovered near death; on August 2 1 he
remained unconscious so long that the cardinals prepared for a conclave
to choose his successor; at the same time Pompeo Colonna, Bishop of
Rieti, appealed to the Roman people to rise against papal rule of their
city, and re- establish Rienzo’s republic. But on the 22nd Julius
regained consciousness; overruling his doctors, he drank a substantial
draft of wine; he surprised all, and disap- pointed many, by recovering;
the republican movement faded away. On October 5 he announced that he
had formed a Holy League of the papacy, Venice, and Spain; on November
17 Henry VIII joined it for England. So reinforced, he deposed from
their dignities the cardinals who had signed the summons to Pisa, and
forbade such a council to meet. At the command of the French king the
Florentine Signory gave permission for the banned council to meet at
Pisa; Julius declared war upon Florence, and plotted to restore the
Medici. A group of twenty-seven ecclesiastics, with represent-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>atives of the king of France and some French universities, met at
Pisa (November 5, 1 5 1 1 ) ; but the inhabitants were so threatening,
and Florence so reluctant, that the council retired to Milan (November
12). There, un- der the protection of the French garrison, the
schismatic councilors could bear in timid safety the taunts of the
people.</p>
<p>Having won this battle of the bishops, Julius turned again to war. He
purchased the alliance of the Swiss, who despatched an army to attack
the French at Milan; the attack failed, and the Swiss returned to their
cantons. On Easter Sunday, April 11, 1512, the French under Gaston de
Foix, de- cisively helped by Alfonso’s artillery, overwhelmed the compo
site army of the League at Ravenna; practically all the Romagna passed
under French control. Julius’ cardinals begged him to make peace; he
refused. The council at Milan celebrated the victory by proclaiming the
Pope deposed; Julius laughed. On May 2 he was carried in his litter to
the Lateran Palace, where he opened the Fifth Lateran Council. He soon
left it to its own slow development while he hurried back to battle.</p>
<p>On May 17 he announced that Germany had joined the Holy League
against France. The Swiss, repurchased, entered Italy through the Tirol,
and advanced to meet a French army disorganized by victory and the death
of their leader. Now outnumbered, the French abandoned Ravenna, Bo-
logna, even Milan; and the schismatic cardinals retreated to France.
Once more the Bentivogli fled, and Julius was master of Bologna and the
Ro- magna. He seized the opportunity to take also Parma and Piacenza;
and now he could hope to win Ferrara, which could no longer rely on aid
from France. , Alfonso offered to come to Rome and ask for absolution
and terms of peace if the Pope would give him a safe-conduct. Julius
did, Alfonso came, and was graciously absolved; but when he refused to
exchange Fer- rara for little Asti, Julius pronounced his safe-conduct
invalid, and threat- ened him with- imprisonment and arrest. Fabrizio
Colonna, who had conveyed the safe-conduct to the Duke, felt that his
own honor was in- volved; he helped Alfonso to escape from Rome; after
arduous adventures Alfonso made his way back to Ferrara, and there
resumed the arming of his forts and walls.</p>
<p>And now at last the demonic energy of the warrior Pope ran out. Late
in January, 15 1 3, he took to his bed with a complication of ailments.
Mer- ciless gossip said that his troub le was an aftermath of the
“French disease”; others that it came from immoderate eating and
drinking. 14 When no treat- ment availed to reduce his fever, he
reconciled himself to death, gave in- structions for his funeral, urged
the Lateran Council to go on with its work without interruption,
confessed himself a great sinner, bade farewell to his</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>cardinals, and died with the same courage with which he had lived
(Febru- ary 20, 1 5 1 3). All Rome mourned him, and an unprecedented
throng came to bid him good-by, and to kiss the feet of the corpse.</p>
<p>We cannot estimate his place in history until we have studied him as
the liberator of Italy, as the builder of St. Peter’s, and as the
greatest patron of art that the papacy has ever known. But his
contemporaries were right in viewing him chiefly as a statesman and a
warrior. They feared his incalcu- lable energy, his terribilitd, his
curses and apparently unappeasable wrath; but they sensed behind all his
violence a spirit capable of compassion and love.* They saw him
defending the Papal States as unscrupulously and ruthlessly as the
Borgias, but with no view to aggrandize his family; all but his enemies
applauded his aims, even when they shuddered at his language and mourned
bis means. He did not govern the reclaimed states as well as Caesar
Borgia had done, for he was too fond of war to be a good adminis-
trator; but his conquests were lasting, and the Papal States remained
hence- forth loyal to the Church until the revolution of 1870 ended the
temporal power of the popes. Julius sinned — like Venice, Lodovico,
Alexander — by calling foreign armies into Italy; but he succeeded
better than his prede- cessors and successors in freeing Italy from
these powers when they had served his turn. Perhaps he weakened Italy in
saving it, and taugbt the “barbarians” that they might fight out their
quarrels on the sunny plains of Lombardy. There were elements of cruelty
in his greatness; he was misled by acquisitiveness in attacking Ferrara
and in taking Piacenza and Parma; he dreamed not only of preserving the
legitimate possessions of the Church but of making himself tbe master of
Europe, the dictator to kings. Guicciardini condemned him for “bringing
empire to the Apostolic See by arms and the shedding of Christian blood,
rather than troubling himself to set an example of holy life”; 16 but it
could hardly be expected of Julius, in his place and age, that he should
abandon the Papal States to Venice and other assailants, and risk the
survival of the Church on purely spiritual grounds, when all the world
about him recognized no rights but those that armed themselves with
power. He was what he had to be in the circum- stances and atmosphere of
his time; and his time forgave him.</p>
<p>IT. ROMAN ARCHITECTURE: 1492-1513</p>
<p>The most lasting part of his work was his patronage of art. Under him
the Renaissance moved its capital from Florence to Rome, and there</p>

</ul>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>reached its zenith in art, as under Leo X it would reach its peak in
litera- ture and scholarship. Julius did not care much for literature;
it was too quiet and feminine for his temperament; but the monumental in
art ac- corded well with his nature and life. So he subordinated all
other arts to architecture, and left a new St. Peter’s as an index of
his spirit and a symbol of the Church whose secular power he had saved.
That he should have financed Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, and a
hundred more, as well as a dozen wars, and have left 700,000 florins in
the papal treasury, is one of the wonders of history, and one of the
causes of the Reformation.</p>
<p>No other man ever brought so many artists to Rome. It was he, for</p>
<p>example, who invited Guillaume de Marcillat from France to set up the
fine stained-glass windows of Santa Maria del Popolo. It was
characteristic of his vast conceptions that he should try to reconcile
Christianity and pa- ganism in art as Nicholas V had done in letters;
for what are the stanze of Raphael but a pre-established harmony of
classic mythology and philoso- phy, Hebrew theology and poetry,
Christian sentiment and faith? And what could better represent the union
of pagan and Christian art and feeling than the portico and dome, the
interior columns, statuary, paintings, and tombs of St. Peter’s?
Prelates and nobles, bankers and merchants, now crowd ing into an
enriched Rome, followed the Pope’s lead, and built pal - aces with
almost imperial splendor in opulent rivalry. Broad avenues were cut
through or from the chaos of the medieval city; hundreds of new streets
were opened; one of them still bear s the great Pope’s name. Ancient
Rome rose out of its ruins, and became again the home of a Caesar.</p>
<p>St. Peter’s aside, it was, in Rome, an age of palaces rather than
of</p>
<p>churches. Exteriors were uniform and plain: a vast rectangular facade
of brick or stone or stucco, a portal of stone usually carved in some
decorative design; on each floor uniform rows of windows, topped with
triangular or elliptical pediments; and almost always a crowning cornice
whose elegant configuration was a special test and care of the
architect. Behind this unpretentious front the millionaires concealed a
luxury of ornament and display seldom revealed to the jealous popular
eye: a central well, usually surrounded or divided by a broad staircase
of marble; on the ground floor, simple rooms for transacting business or
storing goods; on the first (our second) floor, the piano no bile, the
spacious halls for reception and enter- tainment, and galleries of art,
with pavements of marble or sturdy colored tile; the furniture, carpets,
and textiles of exquisite material and form; the walls strengthened with
marble pilasters, the ceilings coffered in circles, triangles, diamonds,
or squares; and on walls and ceilings paintings by</p>

<p>famous artists, usually of pagan themes — for fashion now decreed
that Christian gentlemen, even of the cloth, should live amid scenes
from clas- sical mythology; and on the upper floors the private chambers
for lords and ladies, for liveried lackeys, for children and nurses,
tutors and governesses and maids. Many men were rich enough to have,
besides their palaces, rural villas as refuges from the city’s din or
summer heat; and these villas too might conceal sybaritic glories of
ornament and comfort, and mural master- pieces by Raphael, Peruzzi,
Giulio Romano, Sebastiano del Piombo. . . . This palace and villa
architecture was in many ways a selfish art, in which the wealth drawn
from unseen and countless laborers and distant lands vaunted itself in
gaudy decoration for a few; in this respect ancient Greece and medieval
Europe had shown a finer spirit, devoting their wealth not to private
luxury but to the temples and cathedrals that were the possession,
pride, and inspiration of all, the home of the people as well as the
house of God.</p>
<p>Of the architects outstanding at Rome in the pontificates of
Alexander VI and Julius II two were brothers, and a third was their
nephew. Giuliano da Sangallo began as a military engineer in the
Florentine army; passed to the service of Ferrante of Naples; and became
a friend of Giuliano della Rovere in the early days of the latter’s
cardinalate. For Giuliano, the cardinal, Giuliano the architect turned
the abbey of Grottaferrata into a castle- fortress; probably at Al
exander’s behest he designed the great coffered ceiling of Santa Maria
Maggiore, and gilded it with the first gold brought from America. He
accompanied Cardinal della Rovere into exile, built a palace for him in
Savona, went with him to France, and returned to Rome when his patron at
last became pope. Julius invited him to submit plans for the new
St. Peter’s; when those of Bramante were preferred the old architect
reproached the new Pope, but Julius knew what he wanted. Sangallo
outlived both Bramante and Julius, and was later appointed ad- minister
et coadiutor to Raphael in the building of St. Peter’s; but he died two
years later. Meanwhile his younger brother Antonio da Sangallo had also
come from Florence, as architect and military engineer for Alexander VI,
and had built the imposing church of Santa Maria di Loreto for Julius;
and a nephew, Antonio Picconi da Sangallo, had begun (1512) the most
magnificent of the Renaissance palaces of Rome — the Palazzo
Farnese.</p>
<p>The greatest name in the architecture of this age was that of Donato
Bramante. He was already fifty-six when he came from Milan to Rome
(1499), but his study of the Roman ruins fired him with youthful zeal to
apply classical forms to Renaissance building. In the court of a
Franciscan</p>
<p>45 °</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>convent near San Pietro in Montorio he designed a circular Tempietto,
or Little Temple, with columns and cupola so classical in form that
architects studied and measured it as if it had been a newly discovered
masterpiece of ancient art. From that beginning Bramante passed through
a succession of chefs-d V oeuvre : the cloister of Santa Maria della
Pace, the elegant cortile of San Damaso . . . Julius overwhelmed him
with assignments, both as architect and as military engineer. Bramante
laid out the Via Giulia, finished the Belvedere, began the Loggie of the
Vatican, and. designed a new St. Peter’s. He was so interested in his
work that he cared little for money, and Julius had to command him to
accept appointments whose revenue would main- tain him; 17 some rivals,
however, accused him of embezzling papal funds and using shoddy
materials in his buildings. 18 Others described him as a jovial and
generous soul, whose home became a favorite resort of Perugino, Si-
gnorelli, Pinturicchio, Raphael, and other artists in Rome.</p>
<p>The Belvedere was a summer palace built for Innocent VIII, and
situated on a hill some hundred yards away from the rest of the Vatican.
It took its name from the beautiful view ( bel vedere) that extended
before it; and it gave its name to various sculptures that were housed
in it or its court. Julius had long been a collector of ancient art; his
prize possession was an Apollo discovered during the pontificate of
Innocent VIII; when he became Pope he placed it in the cortile of the
Belvedere, and the Apollo Belvedere became one of the famous statues of
the world. Bramante gave the palace a new fa§ade and garden court, and
planned to connect it with the Vatican proper by a series of picturesque
structures and gardens, but both he and Julius died before the plan
could be carried out.</p>
<p>If we attribute the Reformation proximately to the sale of
indulgences for the building of St. Peter’s, the most momentous event in
the ponti ficate of Julius was the demolition of the old St. Peter’s and
the beginning of the new. According to the received tradition the old
church had been built by Pope Sylvester I (326) over the grave of the
Apostle Peter near the Circus of Nero. In that church many emperors,
from Charlemagne on- ward, had been crowned, and many popes. Repeatedly
enlarged, it was, in the fifteenth century, a spacious basilica with
nave and double aisles, flanked with smaller churches, chapels, and
convents. But by the time of Nicholas V it showed the wear of eleven
centuries; cracks veined its walls, and men feared that it might at any
moment collapse, perhaps upon a con- gregation. So in 1452 Bernardo
Rossellino and Leon Battista Alberti were commissioned to strengthen the
edifice with new walls. The work had hardly begun when Nicholas died;
and succeeding popes, needing funds for crusades, suspended it. In 1505,
after considering and rejecting various</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>45 1</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>other plans, Julius II determined to tear down the old church, and
build an entirely new shrine over what was said to be St. Peter’s grave.
He invited several architects to submit designs. Bramante won with a
proposal to rear a new basilica on the plan of a Greek cross (with arms
of equal length), and to crown its transept crossing with a vast dome;
in the famous phrase ascribed to him, he would raise the dome of the
Pantheon upon the basilica of Constantine. In Bramante’s intent the new
majestic edifice would cover 28,900 square yards — 1 1,600 more than the
area covered by St. Peter’s to - day. Excavation was begun in April, 1
506. On April 1 1 Julius, aged sixty- three, descended a long and
trembling rope ladder to a great depth to lay the foundation stone. The
work progressed slowly as Julius and his funds were more and more
absorbed in war. In 1514 Bramante died, happily not knowing that his
design would never be carried out.</p>
<p>Many good Christians were shocked at the thought of destroying the
venerable old cathedral. Most of the cardinals were strongly opposed,
and many artists complained that Bramante had recklessly shattered the
fine columns and capitals of the ancient nave when with better care he
might have taken them down intact. A satire published three years after
the archi- tect’s death told how Bramante, on reaching St. Peter’s gate,
had been severely rebuked by the Apostle, and had been refused
admittance to Para- dise. But, said the satirist, Bramante did not like
the arrangement of Para- dise anyway, n or the steep approach to it from
the earth. “I will build a new, broad, and commodious road, so that old
and feeble souls may travel on horseback. And then I will make a new
Paradise, with delightful resi- dences for the blessed.” When Peter
rejected th is proposal Bramante of- fered to go down to hell and build
a new and better inferno, since the old one must by this time be almost
burned out. But Peter returned to the question: “Tell me, seriously,
what made you destroy my church?” Bra - mante tried to comfort him:
“Pope Leo will build you a new one.” “Well, then,” said the Apostle,
“you must wait at the gate of Paradise until it is finished.” 19</p>
<p>It was finished in 1626.</p>

<p>After Bramante’s death Leo X named to succeed him, as architectural

years old, too young to bear on his shoulders the weight of Bramante’s

<p>452</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>His good fortune began when he was born to Giovanni de’ Santi, then
the leading painter at Urbino. Some pictures survive from Giovanni’s
brush; they suggest an indifferent talent; but they show that Raphael-
named after the fairest of the archangels — was brought up in the odor
of painting. Visiting artists like Piero della Francesca often stayed at
Gio- vanni’s home; and Giovanni was sufficiently familiar with the art
of his time to write intelligently of a dozen Italian, and some Flemish,
painters and sculptors in his Rhymed Chronicle of Urbino. Giovanni died
when Raphael was only eleven, but apparently the father had already
begun to transmit the art to his son. Probably Timoteo Viti, who
returned to Urbino from Bologna in 1495 after studying with Francia,
continued the instruction, and brought to Raphael what he had learned
from Francia, Tura, and Costa. Meanwhile the boy grew up in circles that
had access to the court; and that refined society that Castiglione was
to describe in The Courtier was begin- ning to spread among the lettered
classes of Urbino the graces of character, manners, and speech that
Raphael would illuminate with his art and his life. The Ashmolean Museum
at Oxford has a remarkable drawing attributed to Raphael in the period
between 1497 and 1 500, and traditionally supposed to be a
self-portrait. The face almost of a girl, the soft eyes of a poet: these
are the features that we shall meet again, darker and a little wistful,
in the en- gaging self-portrait ( c . 1506) in the Pitti Gallery.</p>
<p>Picture the youth of the earlier portrait passing at sixteen from
quiet and orderly Urbino to a Perugia where despotism and violence were
the order of the day. But Perugino was there, whose fame was filling
Italy; Raffael- lo’s guardian uncles felt that the boy’s manifest talent
deserved instruc - tion from the best painters in Italy. They could have
sent him to Leo- nardo at Florence, where he might have imbibed some
deepening strain of that master’s esoteric lore; but there was something
peculiar about the great</p>
<p>breathed.</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>When Perugino went again to Florence (1502) Raphael remained in</p>
<p>Perugia, and fell heir to the demand that his master had developed
for re- ligious pictures. In 1503 he painted for the church of
St. Francis a Coro- nation of the Virgin, now in the Vatican: the
Apostles and Magdalen, standing around an empty sarcophagus, gaze upward
to where, on a pave- ment of clouds, Christ places a cr own upon Mary’s
head, while graceful angels celebrate her with the music of lute and
tambourines. There are many signs of immaturity in the picture: heads
insufficiently individualized, faces inexpressive, hands ill formed,
fingers rigid, and Christ Himself, ob- viously older than His pretty
mother, moving as awkwardly as a commence- ment graduate. But in the
angel musicians — the grace of their motion, the flow of their
draperies, the soft contour of their features — Raphael gives a pledge
of his future.</p>
<p>The picture was apparently successful, for in the following year
another church of San Francesco, in Citta di Castello, some thirty miles
from Pe- rugia, ordered from him a similar picture — a Sposalizio or
Marriage of the Virgin (Brera). It repeats some figures from the earlier
painting, and copies the form of a similar picture by Perugino. But the
Virgin herself has now the peculiar mark and grace of Raphael’s women—
the head modestly in- clined, the oval face tender and demure, the
smooth curve of shoulder and arm and raiment; behind her is a woman more
buxom and alive, blonde and lovely; to the right a youth in tight garb
shows that Raphael has studied the human form sedulously; and now all
the hands are well drawn, and some are beautiful.</p>
<p>About this time Pinturicchio, who had made Raphael’s acquaintance in
Perugia, invited him to Siena as assistant. There Raphael made sketches
and cartoons for some of the brilliant frescoes with which Pinturicchio,
in the library of the cathedral, tol d such portions of Aeneas Sylvius’
story as befitted a pope. In that library Raphael was struck by an
antique statuary group, The Three Graces, that Cardinal Piccolomini had
brought from Rome to Siena; the young artist made a hasty drawing of it,
apparently to help his memory. He seems to have recognized in these
three nudes a dif- ferent world and morality than those that had been
impressed upon him in Urbino and Perugia — a world in which woman was a
joyful goddess of beauty rather than the sorrowful Mother of God, and in
which the worship of beauty was considered as legitimate as the
exaltation of purity and inno- cence. The pagan side of Raphael, which
would later paint rosy nudes in the bathroom of a cardinal, and place
Greek philosophers beside Christian saints in the chambers of the
Vatican, developed now in quiet company</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>454</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>with that aspect of his nature and his art which would produce The
Mass of Bolsena and The Sistine Madonna. In Raphael, more than in any
other hero of the Renaissance, the Christian faith and the pagan rebirth
would live in harmonious peace.</p>
<p>Shortly before or after his visit to Siena he returned briefly to
Urbino. There he painted for Guidobaldo two pictures that probably
symbolized the Duke’s triumph over Caesar Borgia: a St. Michael and a
St. George, both now in the Louvre. Never before, so far as we know, had
the artist succeeded so well in representing action; the figure of
St. George drawing his sword back to strike, while his horse rears up in
terror and the dragon claws at the knight’s leg, is startling in its
vigor and yet pleasing in its grace.</p>
<p>And now Florence called him, as it had called Perugino and a hundred
other young painters. He seemed to feel that unless he could live for a
while in that stimulating hive of competition and criticism, and learn
at first hand the latest developments in line and composition and color,
in fresco and tempera and oil, he would never be more than a provincial
painter, talented but limited, and fated at last for obscure domesticity
in the town of his birth. Late in 1 504 he set out for Florence.</p>
<p>He behaved there with his usual modesty; studied the ancient
sculptures and architectural fragments that had been gathered into the
city; went to the Carmine and copied Masaccio; sought out and pored over
the famous cartoons that Leonardo and Michelangelo had made for
paintings in the Hall of Council in the Palazzo Vecchio. Perhaps he met
Leonardo; cer- tainly for a time he yielded to that elusive master’s
influence. It seemed to him now that beside Leonardo’s Adoration of the
Magi, Mona Lisa, and The Virgin, Child, and St. Anne, the paintings of
the Ferrara, Bologna, Siena, Urbino schools were struck with the rigor
of death, and even the Madonnas of Perugino were pretty puppets,
immature young women of the countryside suddenly endowed with an
uncongenial divinity. How had Leonardo acquired such grace of line, such
subtlety of countenance, such shades of coloring? In a portrait of
Maddalena Doni (Pitti) Raphael ob- viously imitated the Mona Lisa; he
omitted the smile, for Madonna Doni apparently had none; but he pictured
well the robust form of a Florentine matron, the soft, plump, ringed
hands of moneyed ease, and the rich weave and color of the garments that
dignified her form. About the same time he painted her husband, Angelo
Doni, dark, alert, and stern.</p>
<p>From Leonardo he passed to Fra Bartolommeo, visited him in his cell
at</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>455</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>San Marco, wondered at the tender expression, the warm feeling, the
soft contours, the harmonious composition, the deep, full colors, of the
melan- choly friar’s art. Fra Bartolommeo would visit Raphael in Rome in
1514, and wonder in his turn at the swift ascent of the modest artist to
the pinna- cle of fame in the capital of the Christian world. Raphael
became great partly because he could steal with the innocence of
Shakespeare, could try one method and manner after another, take from
each its precious element, and blend these gleanings, in the fever of
creation, into a style unmistakably his own. Bit by bit he absorbed the
rich tradition of Italian painting; soon he would bring it to
fulfillment.</p>
<p>Already in this Florentine period (1504-5, 1506-7) he was painting
pic- tures now famous throughout Christendom and beyond. The Budapest
Museum has a Portrait of a Young Man, perhaps a self-portrait, with the
same beret and side glance of the eyes as in the autoritratto of the
Pitti Gal- lery. When Raphael was but twenty-three he painted the lovely
Madonna del Granduca (Pitti), whose perfectly oval face, and silken
hair, and small mouth, and Leonardesque eyelids lowered in pensive
affection, were framed in a warm contrast of green veil and red robe;
Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, found such pleasure in
contemplating this picture that he took it with him on his travels —
whence its name. Quite as beautiful is the Ma- donna del Cardellino — of
the Goldfinch (Uffizi); the Infant Jesus is no masterpiece of conception
of design, but the playful St. John, arriving triumphantly with the
captured bird, is a delight to mind and eye, and the face of the Virgin
is an unforgettable representation of a y oung mother’s tolerant
tenderness. Raphael gave this painting as a wedding present to Lorenzo
Nasi; in 1 547 an earthquake crushed Nasi’s mansion and broke the
picture into fragments; the pieces were so cleverly reunited that only a
Berenson, seeing it in the Uffizi, could surmise its vicissitudes. The
Ma- donna in the Meadow (Vienna) is a less successful variant; here,
however, Raphael gives us a remarkable landscape, bathed in the soft
blue light of an evening falling quietly upon green fields, unruffled
stream, towered town, and far-off hills. La Belle Jardiniere (Louvre)
hardly deserves to be the most famous of the Florentine Madonnas; it
almost duplicates the Madonna of the Meadow, makes the Baptist absurd
from nose to foot, and only re- deems itself with an ideal Infant
standing with chubby feet upon the Vir- gin’s bare foot, and looking up
at her with loving confidence. The last and most ambitious of them in
this period was the Madonna del Baldacchino (Pitti) — the Virgin Mother
enthroned under a canopy ( baldacchino ), with</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>456</p>
<p>( chap . XVII</p>
<p>two angels parting its folds, two saints at each side, two angels
singing at her feet; all in all a conventional performance, famous only
because it is Raphael’s.</p>
<p>In 1505 he interrupted his stay in Florence to visit Perugia and
execute two commissions there. For the nuns of St. Anthony he painted an
altar- piece which is now one of the most precious pictures in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Within a frame beautifully
carved, the</p>
<p>Virgin sits on a throne, looking like Wordsworth’s “nun breathless
with adoration”; in her lap the Child raises a hand to bless the infant
St. John; two exquisite female figures — St. Cecilia and St. Catherine
of Alexandria- flank the Virgin; in the foreground St. Peter frowns and
St. Paul reads; and above, in a lunette, God the Father, surrounded by
angels, blesses the Mother of His Son, and with one hand upholds the
world. In one panel of the predella Christ prays on the Mount of Olives
while the Apostles sleep; and in another Mary supports the dead Christ
while Magdalen kisses His pierced feet. The perfect composition of the
ensemble, the appealing fig- ures of the female saints, meditative and
wistful, the powerful conception of the passionate Peter, and the unique
vision of Christ on the Mount, make this “Colonna” Madonna the first
indubitable masterpiece of Raphael. In that same year 1506 he painted a
less imposing picture, a Madonna (Na- tional Gallery, London) for the
Ansidei family: the Virgin, straitly en- throned, teaches the Child how
to read; at her left St. Nicholas of Bari, gorgeous in his episcopal
robes, is also studious; at her right the Baptist, sud- denly thirty
while his playmate is still an infant, points the traditional finger of
the Forerunner at the Son of God.</p>
<p>From Perugia Raphael seems to have gone again to Urbino ( 1 506) .
Now he painted for Guidobaldo a second St. George (Leningrad), this time
with a lance; a handsome young knight sheathed in armor whose gleaming
blue displays another phase of Raphael’s skill. Probably on the same
visit he painted for his friends the most familiar of his self-portraits
(Pitti) : black beret over long black locks; face still youthful, and
with no trace yet of beard; long nose, small mouth, soft eyes;
altogether a haunting face, that might have been Keats’s— revealing a
spirit clean and fresh, and sensitive to every beauty in the world.</p>
<p>Late in 1506 he returned to Florence. There he painted some of his
less renowned pictures — St. Catherine of Alexandria (London) , and the
“Nic - colini Cowper” Madonna and Child (Washington). About 1780 the
third Earl Cowper smuggled this out of Florence in the lining of his
carriage; it is not one of Raphael’s fi nest, but Andrew Mellon paid
50,000 to add it to</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>his collection (1928). 20 A far greater picture was begun by Raphael
at Florence in 1507: The Entombment of Christ (Borghese Gallery). It was
ordered for the church of San Francesco in Perugia by Atalanta Baglioni,
who, seven years before, had knelt in the street over her own dying son;
perhaps through Mary’s grief she expressed her own. Taking Perugino’s
Deposition as his model, Raphael grouped his figures in a masterly
compo- sition, almost with the power of Mantegna: the emaciated dead
Christ, borne in a sheet by a virile and muscular youth and a bearded
straining man; a splendid head of Joseph of Arimathea; a lovely Magdalen
leaning in horror over the corpse; Mary fainting into the arms of
attendant women; every body in a different attitude, yet all rendered
with anatomical verity and Correggian grace; a somber symphony of reds,
blues, browns, and greens mingling in a luminous unity, with a
Giorgionesque landscape show- ing the three crosses of Golgotha under an
evening sky.</p>
<p>In 1 508 Raphael received at Florence a call that changed the current
of his life. The new Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria della Rovere, was a
nephew of Julius II; Bramante, a distant relative of Raphael, was now a
favorite with the Pope; apparently both the Duke and the architect
recom- mended Raphael to Julius; soon an invitation was sent the young
painter to come to Rome. He was glad to go, for Rome, not Florence was
now the exciting and stimulating center of the Renaissance world.
Julius, who had lived for four years in the Borgia apartment, had tired
of seeing Giulia Farnese playing Virgin on the wall; he wished to move
into the four cham- bers once used by the admirable Nicholas V ; and he
wanted these stanze or rooms to be decorated with paintings congenial to
his heroic stature and aims. In the summer of 1 508 Raphael went to
Rome.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Raphael and Julius II: 1508-13</li>
</ol>
<p>Rarely since Pheidias had so many great artists gathered in one city
and year. Michelango was carving figures for Julius’ gigantic tomb, and
was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling; Bramante was designing the new
St. Peter’s; Fra Giovanni of Verona, master woodworker, was carving
doors and chairs and bosses for the stanze; Perugino, Signorelli,
Peruzzi, Sodoma, Lotto, Pinturicchio had already painted some of the
walls; and Ambro- gio Foppa, called Caradosso, the Cellini of his age,
was making gold in every way.</p>
<p>Julius assigned to Raphael the Stanza della Segnatura, so called
because usually in this room the Pope heard appeals and signed pardons.
He was so</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>458</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>pleased with the youth’s first paintings here, and saw in him so
excellent and pliable an agent to execute the grand conceptions that
seethed in the papal brain, that he dismissed Perugino, Signorelli, and
Sodoma, ordered their paintings whitewashed, and offered to Raphael the
opportunity to paint all the walls of the four rooms. Raphael persuaded
the Pope to retain some of the work done by the earlier artists; most of
it, however, was covered over, so that the major paintings might have
the unity of one mind and hand. For each room Raphael received 1200
ducats (5,000?); and on the two rooms that he did for Julius he spent
four and a half years. He was now twenty-six.</p>
<p>The plan for the Stanza della Segnatura was lordly and sublime:
the</p>
<p>paintings were to represent the union of religion and philosophy, of
classic culture and Christianity, of Church and state, of literature and
law, in the civilization of the Renaissance. Probably the Pope conceived
the general plan, and chose the subjects in consultation with Raphael
and the scholars of his court — Inghirami and Sadoleto, later Bembo and
Bibbiena. In the great semicircle formed by one side wall Raphael
pictured religion in the persons of the Trinity and the saints, and
theology in the form of the Fa- thers and Doctors of the Church
discussing the nature of the Christian faith as centered in the doctrine
of the Eucharist. How carefully he prepared himself for this first test
of his ability to paint on a monumental scale may be seen from the
thirty preliminary studies that he made for this Disputa del Sacramento.
He recalled Fra Bartolo mmeo’s Last Judgment in Santa Maria Nuova at
Florence, and his own Adoration of the Trinity in San Severo at Perugia;
and on them he modeled his design.</p>
<p>The result was a panorama so majestic as almost to convert the most
ob- durate skeptic to the mysteries of the faith. At the top of the
arch, radial lines, converging upward, make the uppermost figures seem
to bend for- ward; at the bottom the converging lines of a marble
pavement give the picture depth. At the summit God the Father — a
solemn, kindly Abraham — holds up the globe with one hand, and with the
other blesses the scene; below Him the Son sits, naked to the waist, as
in a shell; on His right Mary in humble adoration, on His left the
Baptist still carrying his shepherd’s staff crowned with a cross;
beneath Him a dove represents the Holy Spirit, third person of the
Trinity; everything is here. Seated on a fluffy cloud around the Saviour
are twelve magnificent figures of Old Testament or Christian history:
Adam, a bearded Michelangelesque athlete, almost nude; Abraham; a
stately Moses holding the tables of the Law; David, Judas Maccabaeus,
Peter and Paul, St. John writing his evangel, St. James the</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>Greater, St. Stephen, St. Lawrence, and two others of debated
identity; among them, and in the clouds — everywhere except in the
beards — cherubim and seraphim dart in and out, and angels weave through
the air on the wings of song. Dividing and uniting this celestial
assembly from an earthly throng below are two cherubim holding the
Gospel, and a monstrance displaying the Host. Around this a varied
assemblage of theologians gathers to con- sider the problems of
theology: St. Jerome with his Vulgate and his lion; St. Augustine
dictating The City of God ; St. Ambrose in his episcopal robes; Popes
Anacletus and Innocent III; the philosophers Aquinas, Bonaventura, and
Duns Scotus; the dour Dante crowned as if with thorns; the gentle Fra
Angelico; the angry Savonarola (another Julian revenge on Alexander VI)
; and finally, in a corner, bald and ugly, Raphael’s protecting friend
Bra - mante. In all these human figures the young artist has achieved an
astonish- ing degree of individualization, making each face a credible
biography; and in many of them a degree of superhuman dignity ennobles
the whole pic- ture and theme. Probably never before had painting so
successfully con- veyed the epic sublimity of the Christian creed.</p>
<p>But could the same youth, now twenty-eight, represent with equal
force and grandeur the role of science and philosophy among men? We have
no evidence that Raphael had ever done much reading; he spoke with his
brush and listened with his eyes; he lived in a world of form and color
in which words were trivial things unless they issued in the significant
actions of men and women. He must have prepared himself by hurried
study, by dipping into Plato and Diogenes Laertius and Marsilio Ficino,
and by humble con- versation with learned men, to rise now to his
supreme conception, The School of Athens — half a hundred figures
summing up rich centuries of Greek thought, and all gathered in an
immortal moment under the coffered arch of a massive pagan portico.
There, on the wall directly facing the apotheosis of theology in the
Disputa, is the glorification of philosophy: Plato of the Jovelike brow,
deep eyes, flowing white hair and beard, with a finger pointing upward
to his perfect state; Aristotle walking quietly be- side him, thirty
years younger, handsome and cheerful, holding out his hand with downward
palm, as if to bring his master’s soaring idealism back to earth and the
possible; Socrates counting off his arguments on his fingers, with armed
Alcibiades listening to him lovingly; Pythagoras trying to im- prison in
harmonic tables the music of the spheres; a fair lady who might be
Aspasia; Heraclitus writing Ephesian riddles; Diogenes lying carelessly
dis - robed on the marble steps; Archimedes drawing geometries on a
slate for four absorbed youths; Ptolemy and Zoroaster bandying globes; a
boy at the</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>left running up eagerly with books, surely seeking an autograph; an
assidu- ous lad seated in a corner taking notes; peeking out at the
left, little Federigo of Mantua, Isabella’s son and Julius’ pet;
Bramante again; and hiding mod - estly, almost unseen, Raphael himself,
now sprouting a mustache. There are many more, about whose identity we
shall let leisurely pundits dispute; all in all, such a parliament of
wisdom had never been painted, perhaps never been conceived, before. And
not a word about heresy, no philosophers burned at the stake; here,
under the protection of a Pope too great to fuss about the difference
between one error and another, the young Christian has suddenly brought
all these pagans together, painted them in their own character and with
remarkable understanding and sympathy, and placed them where the
theologians could see them and exchange fallibilities, and where the
Pope, between one document and another, might contemplate the
co-operative process and creation of human thought. This painting and
the Disputa are the ideal of the Renaissance — pagan antiquity and
Christian faith living together in one room and harmony. These rival
panels, in the sum of their conception, composition, and technique, are
the apex of Euro- pean painting, to which no man has ever risen
again.</p>
<p>A third wall remained, smaller than the other two, and so broken by a
casement window that unity of pictorial subject seemed impossible there.
It was a brilliant choice to let that surface picture poetry and music;
so a chamber heavily laden with theology and philosophy was made light
and bright with the world of harmonious imagination, and gentle melodies
could sing silently through the centuries across that room where
unappeal- able decisions gave life or death. In this fresco of
Parnassus, Apollo, seated under some laurel trees atop the sacred mount,
draws from his viol “ditties of no tone”; and at his right a Muse
reclines in graceful ease, baring a lovely breast to the saints and
sages on the adjacent walls; and Homer recites his hexameters in blind
ecstasy, and Dante looks with unreconciled severity even at this goodly
company of graces and bards; and Sappho, too beautiful to be Lesbian,
strums her cithara; and Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Tibullus, and other
singers chosen by time mingle with Petrarch, Boccaccio, Ariosto,
Sannazaro, and lesser voices of more recent Italy. So the young artist
sug- gested that “life without music would be a mistake ,” 21 and that
the strains and visions of poetry might lift men to heights as lofty as
the myopia of wisdom and the impudence of theology.</p>
<p>On the fourth wall, also pierced by a window, Raphael honored the
place of law in civilization. In the lunette he painted figures of
Prudence, Force, and Moderation; on one side of the casement he
represented civil law in the</p>

<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>form of The Emperor Justinian Promulgating the Pandects, and on the
other, canon law in the person of Pope Gregory IX Promulgating the De-
cretals. Here, to flatter his irascible master, he pictured Julius as
Gregory, and achieved another powerful portrait. In the circles,
hexagons, and rec- tangles of the ornate ceiling he painted little
masterpieces like The Judg- ment of Solomon, and symbolic figures of
theology, philosophy, jurispru- dence, astronomy, and poetry. With these
and similar cameos, and some medallions left by Sodoma, the great Stanza
della Segnatura was complete. Raphael had exhausted himself there, and
never attained to such colossal excellence again. By 151 1, when he
began the next room — now called the Stanza d’Eliodoro from its central
picture — the conceptual inspiration of Pope and artist seemed to lose
force and fire. Julius could hardly be ex- pected to dedicate his entire
apartment to a glorification of a union between classic culture and
Christianity; it was natural now that he should devote a few walls to
commemorating scenes in Scriptural and Christian story. Per- haps to
symbolize his expected expulsion of the French from Italy, he chose for
one side of the chamber the vivid description, in the Second Book of
Maccabees, of how Heliodorus and his pagan cohorts, attempting to ab-
scond with the treasury of the Jerusalem Temple (186 b.c.), were over-
whelmed by three angel warriors. Against an architectural background of
great pillars and receding arches the high priest Onias, kneeling at the
altar, begs divine aid. On the right a mounted angel, with irresistible
wrath, tramples down the robber general, while two other heavenly
rescuers ad- vance to attack the fallen infidel, whose stolen coins
spill out upon the pavement. On the left, with sublime disdain of
chronology, Julius II sits enthroned in calm majesty, watching the
expulsion of the invaders; at his feet a crowd of Jewish women mingle
incongruously with Raphael (now bearded and solemn) and his friends
Marcantonio Raimondi the engraver and Giovanni di Foliari, a member of
the papal secretariat. It is hardly as exalting a fresco as the Disputa
or The School of Athens; it is too visibly devoted, at the cost of
compositional unity, to the celebration of one pon- tiff and a passing
theme; but it is still a masterpiece, vibrating with action, stately
with architecture, and almost rivaling Michelangelo in the display of
angry and muscular anatomies.</p>
<p>On another wall Raphael painted The Mass of Bolsena. About 1263 a
Bohemian priest of Bolsena (near Orvieto), who had doubted that the sac-
ramental wafer was really transformed into the body and blood of Christ,
was amazed to see drops of blood ooze from the Host that he had just
con- secrated in the Mass. In commemoration of this miracle Pope Urban
IV</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>462</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVII</p>
<p>ordered the erection of a cathedral at Orvieto, and the annual
celebration of the Corpus Christi feast. Raphael painted the scene with
brilliance and mastery. The priestly skeptic gazes at the bleeding Host,
while the acolytes behind him start at the sight; women and children at
one side, Swiss guards at the other, unable to see the miracle, are
visibly unmoved; Cardinals Riario and Schinner and other ecclesiastics
stare at the scene in mingled astonish- ment and terror; across from the
altar, kneeling on a prie-dieu carved with grotesques, Julius II looks
on in quiet dignity, as if he had known all along that the Host would
bleed. Technically this is one of the best of the stanze frescoes:
Raphael has distributed his figures skillfully around and above the
window that mounts into the wall; he has designed them with firmness of
line and careful execution; and he has brought to flesh and drapery a
new depth and warmth of coloring. The figure of the kneeling Julius is a
re- vealing portrait of the Pope in his final year. Still the warrior
strong and stern, still the proud King of Kings, he is a man worn with
his toils and combats, clearly marked for death.</p>
<p>During these major labors (1508-13) Raphael produced several memora-
ble Madonnas. The Virgin with the Diadem (Louvre) reverts to the Um-
brian style of modest piety. The Madonna della Casa Alba — literally
“the Lady of the White House”— is a graceful study in pink and green and
gold, with the large and flowing lines of Mi chelangelo’s sibyls; Andrew
Mellon contributed ,166,400 to the Soviet Government in exchange for
this pic- ture (1936). The Madonna di Foligno (Vatican) shows a lovely
Virgin and Child in the clouds, a ghastly Baptist pointing to her, a
stout St. Jerome presenting to her the donor of the picture, Sigismondo
de’ Conti of Foligno and Rome; here Raphael, under the influence of the
Venetian Sebastiano del Piombo, achieves a new splendor of luminous
color. The Madonna della Pesce (Prado) is altogether beautiful: in the
face and mood of the Virgin; in the Child — never surpassed by Raphael;
in the youthful Tobit presenting to Mary the fish whose liver has
restored his father’s sight; in the robe of the angel who guides him; in
the patriarchal head of St. Jerome. In composition, color, and light
this painting can bear comparison with the Sistine Madonna itself.</p>
<p>Finally Raphael in this period raised portrait painting to a height
that only Titian would reach again. The portrait was a characteristic
product of the Renaissance, and corresponds to the proud liberation of
the indi- vidual in that flamboyant age. Raphael’s portraits are not
numerous, but they all stand on the highest level of the art. One of the
finest is Bindo Alto- viti. Who could surmise that this gentle but alert
youth, healthy and clear- JULIUS II</p>

<p>463</p>
<p>eyed, and as pretty as a girl, was no poet but a banker, and a
generous patron of artists from Raphael to Cellini? He was twenty-two
when so portrayed; in 1556 he died at Rome after a noble but disastrous
and ex- hausting effort to save the independence of Siena from Florence.
And of course to this period belongs the greatest of all portraits, the
Julius 11 of the Uffizi Gallery (c. 1512). We cannot say that this is
the original that first came from Raphael’s hand; possibly it is a
studio replica; and the marvelous copy in the Pitti Palace was made by
none other than that rival portraitist, Titian. The fate of the original
is unknown.</p>
<p>Julius himself died before the Stanza cTEliodoro was finished, and
Raph- ael wondered whether the great plan of the four stanze would be
carried out. But how could a pope like Leo X, wedded to art and poetry
almost as deeply as to religion, hesitate? The young man from Urbino was
to find in Leo his most loyal friend; the living genius of happiness was
to know under a happy pope his happiest years.</p>

<p>We have left to the last Julius’ favorite painter and sculptor, a man
rival - ing him in temper and tenibilitd, in power and depth of spirit —
the greatest and saddest artist in the records of mankind.</p>
<p>Michelangelo’s father was Lodovico di Lionardo Buonarroti Simoni, po
- desta or mayor of the little town of Caprese, on the road from
Florence to Arezzo. Lodovico claimed distant kinship with the counts of
Canossa, one of whom was pleased to acknowledge the relation; Michael
always prided himself on having a liter or two of noble blood; but
ruthless research has proved him mistaken. 22</p>
<p>Born at Caprese on March 6, 1475, and named, like Raphael, after an
archangel, Michelangelo was the second of four brothers. He was put out.
to nurse near a marble quarry at Settignano, so that he breathed the
dust of sculpture from his birth; he remarked later that he had sucked
in chisels and hammers with his nurse’s milk. 23 When he was six months
old the family moved to Florence. He received some schooling there,
enough to enable him, in after years, to write good Italian verse. He
learned no Latin, and never fell so completely under the hypnosis of
antiquity as did many artists of the time; he was Hebraic not classic,
Protestant in spirit rather than Catholic.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>He preferred drawing to writing — which is a corruption of drawing.
His father mourned the preference, but finally yielded to it, and
apprenticed Michael, aged thirteen, to Domenico Ghirlandaio, then the
most popular painter in Florence. The contract bound the youth to stay
with Domenico three years “to learn the art of painting”; he was to
receive six florins the first year, eight the second, ten the third, and
presumably shelter and food. The boy supplemented Ghirlandaio’s
instruction by keeping his eyes open as he wandered through Florence,
seeing in everything some object for art. “Thus,” reports his friend
Condivi, “he used to frequent the fish market and study the shape and
hues of fishes’ fins, the color of their eyes, and so for every part
belonging to them; all which details he reproduced with the utmost
diligence in his painting.” 24</p>
<p>He had been with Ghirlandaio hardly a year when a combination of na-
ture and chance turned him to sculpture. Like many other art students he
had free access to the gardens in which the Medici had disposed their
col- lections of antique statuary and architecture. He must have copied
some of these marbles with especial interest and skill, for when
Lorenzo, wishing to develop a school of sculpture in Florence, asked
Ghirlandaio to send him some students of promise in that direction,
Domenico gave him Francesco Granacci and Michelangelo Buonarroti. The
boy’s father hesitated to let him make the change from one art to the
other; he feared that his son would be put to cutting stone; and indeed
Michael was so used for a time, block- ing out marble for the Laurentian
Library. But soon the boy was carving statues. All the world knows the
story of Michael’s marble faun: how he chiseled a stray piece into the
figure of an old faun; how Lorenzo, passing, remarked that so old a faun
would hardly have so complete a set of teeth; and how Michael remedied
the fault at one blow by knocking a tooth out of the upper jaw. Pleased
with the boy’s product and aptitude, Lorenzo took him into his home and
treated him as his son. For two years (1490-2) the young artist lived in
the Palazzo Medici, regularly ate at the same table with Lorenzo,
Politian, Pico, Ficino, and Pulci, heard the most enlightened talk about
politics, literature, philosophy and art. Lorenzo assigned him a good
room, and allowed him five ducats (2.50?) a month for his personal
expenses. Whatever works of art Michael might produce remained his own,
to dispose of as he wished.</p>
<p>These years in the Medici Palace might have been a period of pleasant
growth had it not been for Pietro Torrigiano. Pietro one day took
offense at Michael’s banter, and (so he told Cellini) , “clenching my
fist, I gave him such a blow on the nose that I felt bone and cartilage
go down like biscuit</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>beneath my knuckles; and this mark of mine he will carry to the
grave.” 25 It was so: Michelangelo for the next seventy-four years
showed a nose broken at the bridge. It did not sweeten his temper.</p>
<p>In those same years Savonarola was preaching his fiery gospel of
puritan reform. Michael went often to hear him, and never forgot those
sermons, or the cold thrill that ran through his youthful blood as the
prior’s angry cry, announcing the doom of corrupt Italy, pierced the
stillness of the crowded cathedral. When Savonarola died, something of
his spirit lingered in Michelangelo: a horror of the moral decay about
him, a fierce resent- ment of despotism, a somber presentiment of doom.
Those memories and fears shared in forming his character, in guiding his
chisel and his brush; lying on his back under the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel, he remembered Savonarola; painting The Last Judgment, he
resurrected him, and hurled the friar’s fulminations down the
centuries.</p>
<p>In 1492 Lorenzo died, and Michael returned to his father’s house. He
continued his sculpture and painting, and now added a strange experience
to his education. The prior of the hospital of Santo Spirito allowed
him, in a private room, to dissect corpses. Michael performed so many
dissections that his stomach revolted, and for a time he could hardly
hold any food or drink. But he learned anatomy. He had an absurd chance
to show his knowledge when Piero de’ Medici asked him to mold a gigantic
snow man in the court of the palace. Michael complied, and Piero
persuaded him to live again in the Casa Medici (January, 1494).</p>
<p>Late in 1494 Michelangelo, in one of his many hectic moves, fled
through the winter snow of the Apennines to Bologna. One story says that
he was warned of Piero’s coming fall by the dream of a friend; perhaps
his own judgment predicted that event; in any case Florence might not
then be safe for one so favored by the Medici. At Bologna he studied
carefully the re- liefs by Iacopo della Quercia on the facade of San
Petronio. He was en- gaged to finish the tomb of St. Dominic, and carved
for it a graceful</p>
<p>Kneeling Angel; then the organized sculptors of Bologna sent him
warning that if he, a foreigner and interloper, continued to take work
out of their hands, they would dispose of him by one or another of the
many devices open to Renaissance initiative. Meanwhile Savonarola had
taken charge of Florence, and virtue was in the air. Michael returned
(1495).</p>
<p>He found a patron in Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, of the collateral
branch of the Medici. For him he carved a Sleeping Cupid, which had a
strange history. Lorenzo suggested that he treat the surface to make it
look like an antique; Michael complied; Lorenzo sent it to Rome, where
it was sold for</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>thirty ducats to a dealer who sold it for two hundred to Raffaello
Riario, Cardinal di San Giorgio. The Cardinal discovered the cheat, sent
back the Cupid, recovered his ducats. It was later sold to Caesar
Borgia, who gave it to Guidobaldo of Urbino; Caesar reclaimed it on
taking that city, and sent it to Isabella d’Este, who described it as
“without a peer among the works of modern times.” 20 Its later history
is unknown.</p>
<p>With all his versatile ability Michael found it hard to earn a living
by art in a city where there were almost as many artists as citizens. An
agent of Riario invited him to Rome, assuring him that the Cardinal
would give him employment, and that Rome was full of wealthy patrons. So
in 1496 Mi- chelangelo moved hopefully to the capital, and received a
place in the household of the Cardinal. Riario did not prove generous;
but Iacopo Gallo, a banker, commissioned Michael to carve a Bacchus and
a Cupid. One is in the Bargello at Florence, the other in the Victoria
and Albert Museum in London. The Bacchus is an unpleasant representation
of the young god of wine in a state of bibbling intoxication; the head
is too small for the body, as may be fitting in a toper; but the body is
well designed, and smooth with an androgynous softness of texture. The
Cupid is a crouching youth, more like an athlete than a god of love;
possibly Michelangelo did not name it so incongruously; as sculpture it
is excellent. Here, almost at the outset, the artist distinguished his
work by showing the figure in a moment and attitude of action. The Greek
preference for repose in art was alien to him, except in the Pieta; so —
with the same exception — was the Greek flair for universality — for
depicting general types; Michelangelo chose rather to portray an
individual imaginary in conception, realistic in detail. He did not
imitate the antique, except in costumes; his work was characteristically
his own, no renaissance, but a unique creation.</p>
<p>The greatest product of this first stay in Rome was the Pieta that is
now one of the glories of St. Peter’s. The contract for it was signed by
Cardinal Jean de Villiers, French ambassador at the papal court (1498);
the fee was to be 450 ducats (,625 ?); the time allowed, one year; and
Michael’s banker friend added his own generous guarantees:</p>
<p>I, Iacopo Gallo, pledge my word to his most reverend Lordship</p>
<p>that the said Michelangelo will finish the said work within one year,
and that it shall be the finest work in marble which Rome today can
show, and that no master of our day shall be able to produce a better.
And in like manner … I pledge my word to the said Michelangelo</p>
<p>that the most reverend Cardinal will disburse the payments accord-
ing to the articles above engrossed . 27</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>467</p>
<p>There are some blemishes in this glorious group of the Virgin Mother
holding her dead Son in her lap: the drapery seems excessive, the
Virgin’s head is small for her body, her left hand is extended in an
inappropriate gesture; her face is that of a young woman clearly younger
than her Son. To this last complaint Michelangelo, as reported by
Condivi, made answer: Do you not know that chaste women maintain their
freshness far</p>
<p>longer than the unchaste? How much more would this be the case</p>
<p>with a virgin into whose breast there never crept the least
lascivious desire which would affect the body! Nay, I will go further,
and</p>
<p>hazard the belief that this unsullied bloom of youth, besides
being</p>
<p>maintained in her by natural causes, may have been miraculously</p>
<p>wrought to convince the world of the virginity and perpetual
purity</p>
<p>of the Mother. 28</p>
<p>It is a pleasant and forgivable fancy. The spectator is soon
reconciled to that gentle face, untorn by agony, calm in her grief and
love, the bereaved mother resigned to the will of God, and consoled by
holding for some final moments the dear body here cleansed of its
wounds, freed from its indig- nities, resting in the lap of the woman
that bore it, and beautiful even in death. All the essence and tragedy
and redemption of life are in this simple group: the stream of births by
which woman carries on the race; the cer- tainty of death as the penalty
for every birth; and the love that ennobles our mortality with kindness,
and challenges every death with new birth. Francis I was right when he
pronounced this the finest achievement of Michelangelo. 29 In all the
history of sculpture no man has ever surpassed it, except, perhaps, the
unknown Greek who carved the Demeter of the British Museum.</p>
<p>The success of the Pietd brought Michelangelo not only fame, which he
humanly enjoyed, but money, which his relatives were ready to enjoy with
him. His father had lost, with the fall of the Medici, the little
sinecure that Lorenzo the Magnificent had given him; Michael’s older
brother had en - tered a monastery; the two younger brothers were
improvident, and Mi- chael became now the main support of the family. He
complained of this necessity, but gave generously.</p>
<p>Probably because the disordered finances of his relatives called him,
he returned to Florence in 1501. A unique assignment came to him in
August of that year. The Operai or Board of Works at the cathedral owned
a block of Carrara marble thirteen and a half feet high, but so
irregularly shaped that it had lain unused for a hundred years. The
Board asked Mi-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>468</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>chelangelo could a statue be chiseled out of it. He agreed to try;
and on August 16 the Operai del Duomo and the Arte della Lana (the
Wool</p>
<p>Guild) signed the contract:</p>
<p>That the worthy master Michelangelo . . . has been chosen to</p>
<p>fashion, complete, and finish to perfection that male statue
called</p>
<p>II gigante, of nine cubits in height . . . that the work shall be
com-</p>
<p>pleted within two years dating from September, at a salary of six</p>
<p>golden florins per month; that what is needed for the accomplish-</p>
<p>ment of this task, as workmen, timbers, etc., shall be supplied
him</p>
<p>by the Operai; and when the statue is finished the Guild consuls and
the Operai . . . shall estimate whether he deserve a larger recompense,
and this shall be left to their consciences. 30</p>
<p>The sculptor toiled on the refractory material for two and a half
years; with heroic labor he drew from it, using every inch of its
height, his David. On January 25, 1504, the Operai assembled a council
of the leading artists in Florence to consider where II gigante , as
they called the David, should be placed: Cosimo Roselli, Sandro
Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Giuliano and Antonio da Sangallo,
Filippino Lippi, David Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Giovanni Piffero (father
of Cellini), and Piero di Cosimo. They could not agree, and finally they
left the matter to Michelangelo; he asked that the statue be placed on
the platform of the Palazzo Vecchio. The Signory con- sented; but the
task of moving The Giant from the workshop near the cathedral to the
Palazzo took forty men four days; a gateway had to be heightened by
breaking a wall above it before the colossus could pass; and twenty-one
additional days were spent in raising it into place. For 369 years it
stood on the open and uncovered porch of the Palazzo, subject to
weather, urchins, and revolution. For in a sense it was a radical
pronuncia- mento, symbol of the proud restored republic, stern threat to
usurpers. The Medici, returning to power in 1513, left it untouched; but
in the uprising that again deposed them (1527) a bench thrown from a
window of the Palace broke the statue’s left arm. Francesco Salviati and
Giorgio Vasari, then lads of sixteen, gathered and preserved the pieces,
and a later Medici, Duke Cosimo, had these fragments put together and
replaced. In 1873, after the statue had suffered erosion from the
weather, David was labori- ously transferred to the Accademia delle
Belle Arti, where it occupies the place of honor as the most popular
figure in Florence.</p>
<p>It was a tour de force, and as such can hardly be overpraised; the
me- chanical difficulties were brilliantly overcome. Esthetically one
may pick a few flaws: the right hand is too large, the neck too long,
the left leg over-</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>469</p>
<p>long below the knee, the left buttock does not swell as any proper
buttock should. Piero Soderini, head of the republic, thought the nose
excessive; Vasari tells the story — perhaps a legend — how Michelangelo,
hiding some marble dust in his hand, mounted a ladder, pretended to
chisel off a bit of the nose while leaving it intact, and let the marble
dust fall from his hand before the Gonfalonier, who then pronounced the
statue much improved. The total effect of the work silences criticism:
the splendid frame, not yet swollen with the muscles of Michelangelo’s
later heroes, the fin ished texture of the flesh, the strong yet refined
features, the nostrils tense with excite- ment, the frown of anger and
the look of resolution subtly tinged with dif- fidence as the youth
faces the fearsome Goliath and prepares to fill and cast his sling —
these share in making the David, with one exception,* the most famous
statue in the world. Vasari thought it “surpassed all other statues
ancient and modern, Latin or Greek.” 31</p>
<p>The Duomo Board paid Michelangelo a total of 400 florins for the
David. Allowing for the depreciation of currency between 1400 and 1 500,
we may equate this roughly at 000 in the money of 1952; it seems a
rather small sum for thirty months’ work; presumably he accepted other
commissions during that time. Indeed the Board and Guild themselves,
while David was in process, engaged him to carve statues, six and a half
feet high, of the twelve Apostles, to be placed in the cathedral. He was
allowed twelve years for the work, was to be paid two florins a month,
and a house was to be built for his free occupancy. Of these statues the
sole survivor is a St. Matthew, only half emerged from the block of
stone, like some figure by Rodin. Looking at it in the Florence Academy,
we understand better what Michelangelo meant wh en he defined sculpture
as the art “that works by force of taking away”; and again, in one of
his poems: “In hard and craggy stone the mere removal of the surface
gives being to a figure, which ever grows the more the stone is hewn
away.” 32 He often sp oke of himself as searching to find the figure
concealed in the stone, knocking the surface away as if seeking a miner
buried in fallen rock.</p>
<p>About 1 505 he carved for a Flemish merchant the Madonna that sits in
the church of Notre Dame at Bruges. It has been highly praised, but it
is one of the artist’s poorer works— the drapery simple and dignified,
the head of the Child quite out of proportion to the body, the face of
the Virgin pouting and mournful as if she felt that it was all a
mistake. Still stranger is the homely Virgin in the Madonna painted
(1505) for Angelo Doni. In truth Michelangelo did not care much for
beauty; he was interested in</p>
<p>• Which should be the Hermes of Praxiteles but more probably is the
Statue of Liberty in the harbor of New York.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>470</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>bodies, preferably male, and represented them sometimes with all the
de- fects of their seen forms, sometimes in a way to convey some sermon
or idea, but seldom with a view to catching beauty and imprisoning it in
last- ing stone. In this Doni Madonna he offends good taste by placing a
row of naked youths on a parapet behind the Virgin. Not that he was
pagan- izing; he was apparently a sincere, even a puritan, Christian;
but here, as in The Last Judgment, his fascination with the human body
triumphed over his piety. He was deeply interested, too, in the anatomy
of position, in what happens to limbs, extremities, frame, and muscles
when the body changes its pose. So here the Virgin leans backward,
apparently to receive the Child over her shoulder from St. Joseph. It is
excellent sculpture, but lifeless and almost colorless painting.
Michelangelo was to protest, time and again, that painting was not his
forte.</p>
<p>Therefore he must have felt no great pleasure when Soderini invited
him (1504) to paint a mural in the Hall of the Great Council of the
Palazzo Vecchio, while his bete noire, Leonardo da Vinci, was to paint
an opposite wall. He disliked Leonardo for a hundred reasons — for his
aristocratic man- ners, his costly and pretentious dress, his retinue of
pretty youths, perhaps for his greater success and fame, till then, as a
painter. Angelo was not sure that he, a sculptor, could rival Leonardo
in painting; it was courageous of him to try. For his preliminary
cartoon he set up a panel of linen-backed paper 288 square feet in area.
He had made some progress on this sketch when a summons came to him from
Rome: Julius needed the best sculptor to be found in Italy. The Signory
fumed, but let Michelangelo go (1505). Perhaps he was not sorry to leave
the pencil and the brush, and return to the laborious art that he
loved.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Michelangelo and Julius 11 : 1505-13</li>

<p>He must have seen at once that he would be miserable with Julius,
they were so much alike. Both had temper and temperament: the Pope
imperi- ous and fiery, the artist somber and proud. Both were Titans in
spirit and aim, acknowledging no superior, admitting no compromise,
passing from one grandiose project to another, stamping their
personalities on their time, and laboring with such mad energy that when
both were dead all Italy seemed exhausted and empty.</p>
<p>Julius, following the example long since set by the cardinals, wanted
for his bones a mausoleum whose size and splendor should proclaim his
great- ness even to distant and forgetful posterity. He looked with envy
upon the beautiful tomb that Andrea Sansovino had just carved for
Cardinal Ascanio</p>
<p>JULIUS II</p>
<p>47 1</p>
<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>Sforza in Santa Maria del Popolo. Michael proposed a colossal
monument twenty-seven feet in length and eighteen in width. Forty
statues would adorn it: some symbolizing the redeemed Papal States; some
personifying Painting, Architecture, Sculpture, Poetry, Philosophy,
Theology — all made captive by the irresistible Pope; others depicting
his major predecessors, as, for example, Moses; two would picture angels
— one weeping at Julius’ re - moval from the earth, the other smiling at
his entrance into heaven. At the top would be a handsome sarcophagus for
the mortal papal remains. Along the surfaces of the monument would run
bronze reliefs recounting the achievements of the Pope in war,
government, and art. All this was to stand in the tribune of
St. Peter’s. It was a design that would use many tons of marble, many
thousands of ducats, many years of the sculptor’s life. Julius approved,
gave Angelo two thousand ducats for the purchase of marble, and sent him
off to Carrara instructed to pick the finest veins. While there Michael
noted a hill overlooking the sea, and conceived the idea of carving the
mount into a colossal human figure, which, lighted at the top, would
serve as a beacon to distant mariners; but Julius’ tomb called him back
to Rome. When the marble that he had bought arrived, and was piled up in
a square by his lodgings near St. Peter’s, people marveled at its
quantity and cost, and Julius rejoiced.</p>
<p>The drama became tragedy. Bramante, desiring money for the new
St. Peter’s, looked askance at this titanic project; moreover he feared
that Mi- chelangelo would replace him as the Pope’s favorite artist; he
used his in - fluence to divert papal funds and passion from the
proposed tomb. For his part Julius was planning war upon Perugia and
Bologna (1506), and found Mars an expensive god; the tomb should wait
for peace. Meanwhile Angelo had received no salary, had spent on marble
all that Julius had advanced him, had paid out of his own pocket to
furnish the house that the Pope had provided for him. He went to the
Vatican on Holy Saturday, 1506, to ask for money; he was told to return
on Monday; he did, and was told to re- turn on Tuesday; like rebuffs met
him on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; on Friday he was turned away
with the blunt statement that the Pope did not wish to see him. He went
home and wrote a letter to Julius:</p>
<p>Most Blessed Father: I have been turned out of the Palace today</p>
<p>by your orders; wherefore I give you notice that from this time
for-</p>
<p>ward, if you want me, you must look for me elsewhere than at</p>
<p>Rome. 33</p>
<p>He gave instructions for the sale of the furniture he had bought, and
took horse toward Florence. At Poggibonsi he was overtaken by couriers

<p>472</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>ing a letter from the Pope, which commanded him to return at once to
Rome. If we may accept his own account (and he was an unusually honest
man) he sent back a reply that he would come only when the Pope agreed
to fulfill the conditions of their understanding for the tomb. He
continued to Florence.</p>
<p>Now he resumed work on the immense cartoon for The Battle of Pisa. He
chose as his subject no actual warfare, but the moment when the sol-
diers, who had been swimming in the Arno, were suddenly called to
action. Michael was not concerned with battles; he wanted to study and
portray the nude male form in every position; here was his chance. He
showed some men emerging from the river, others running to their
weapons, oth- ers struggling to pull up stockings on wet legs, others
leaping or riding on horseback, others hurriedly adjusting their armor,
some running stark naked to the fight. There was no landscape
background; Michelangelo never cared for landscape, or for anything in
nature except the human form. When the cartoon was finished it was put
alongside Leonardo’s in the Hall of the Pope in Santa Maria Novella.
There the rival sketches be- came a school for a hundred artists —
Andrea del Sarto, Alonso Berruguete, Raphael, Iacopo Sansovino, Perino
del Vaga, and a hundred more. Cellini, who copied Michelangelo’s cartoon
about 1513, described it with youthful enthusiasm as “so splendid in
action that nothing survives of ancient or modern art which touches the
same point of lofty excellence. Though the divine Michel Agnolo in later
life finished that great 〔Sistine〕 Chapel, he never rose halfway to
the same pitch of power.” 14</p>
<p>We cannot say as much. The picture was never painted, the cartoon is
lost, and only minor fragments survive of the many copies made. While
Angelo was working on the sketch Pope Julius sent message after message
to the Florentine Signory, commanding them to send him back to Rome.
Soderini, loving the artist and fearing for his safety in Rome,
temporized. After the third letter from the Pope he begged Angelo to
obey, saying that his obstinacy endangered the peaceful relations
between Florence and the papacy. Michael demanded a safe-conduct, to be
signed by the Cardinal ofVolterra. During the delay Julius captured
Bologna (November, 1506). Now he sent to Florence a peremptory order
that Michelangelo should come to Bologna for an important commission.
Armed with a letter from Soderini to Julius, which begged the Pope to
“show him love and treat him gently,” Michael went once more over the
snows of the Apen nines. Julius received him with a heavy frown, ordered
from the room a bishop who pre- sumed to rebuke the artist for
disobedience, gave Angelo a grumbling par-</p>

<p>CHAP. XVII )</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>don, and a characteristic assignment. “I wish you to make my statue
on a large scale in bronze. I mean to place it on the facade of San
Petronio.” 35 Michael was glad to get back to sculpture, though not
confident of his abil- ity to cast successfully a sitting figure
fourteen feet in height. Julius pro- vided a thousand ducats for the
work; Angelo reported later that he had spent all but four ducats on
materials, so that he had for himself only that reward for two years of
labor in Bologna. The task was as heartbreaking as that which Cellini
described for casting the Loggia Perseus. “I work night and day,” the
sculptor wrote to his brother Buonarroto; “if I had to begin the whole
thing over again I do not think I could survive it.” 36 In February,
1508, the statue was raised to its place above the main portal of the
cathedral. In March Michael returned to Florence, probably praying that
he might never see Julius again. Three years later, as we have seen, the
statue was melted into cannon.</p>
<p>Almost at once the Pope sent for him. Angelo went back to Rome, and
was chagrined to find that Julius wanted him not to carve the great tomb
but to paint the ceiling of the chapel of Sixtus IV. He hesitated to
face the problems of perspective and foreshortening in painting a
ceiling sixty-eight feet above the floor; he protested again that he was
a sculptor, not a painter; in vain he recommended Raphael as a better
man for the work. Julius com- manded and coaxed, pledging a fee of 3000
ducats (7,500?); Michael feared the Pope and needed the money. Still
murmuring, “This is not my trade,” he undertook the arduous and
uncongenial task. He sent to Flor - ence for five assistants trained in
design; tore down the clumsy scaffolding that Bramante had raised,
erected his own, and set to work measuring and charting the ten thousand
square feet of the ceiling, planning the general design, making cartoons
for each separate space, including spandrels, pen- dentives, and
lunettes; in all there were to be 343 figures. Many preliminary studies
were made, some from living models. When the final form of a cartoon was
finished it was carried carefully up the scaffolding and was ap- plied,
face outward, to the freshly plastered surface of its corresponding
place; the lines of the composition were then pricked through the
drawing into the plaster, the cartoon was removed, and the sculptor
began to paint.</p>
<p>For over four years — from May, 1 508, to October, 1 5 1 2 — Angelo
worked on the Sistine ceiling. Not continuously; there were
interruptions of un- certain length, as when he went to Bologna to
besiege Julius for more funds. And not alone: he had helpers to grind
the colors, prepare the plaster, per- haps to draw or paint some minor
features; parts of the frescoes reveal in- ferior hands. But the five
artists whom he had summoned to Rome were</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>474</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>soon dismissed; Angelo’s style of conception, design, and coloring
was so different from theirs and the traditions of Florence that he
found them more hindrance than aid. Besides, he did not know how to get
along with others, and it was one of his consolations, up there on the
scaffold, that he was alone; there he could think, in pain but in peace;
there he could ex- emplify Leonardo’s saying: “If you are alone you will
be whol ly your</p>
<p>own.” To the technical difficulties Julius added himself by his
impatience to have the great work completed and displayed. Picture the
old Pope mounting the frail frame, drawn up to the platform by the
artist, expressing admiration, always aski ng, “When will it be
finished?” The reply was a lesson in integrity: “When I shall have done
all that I believe required to satisfy art .” 37 To which Julius
retorted angrily: “Do you want me to hurl you from this scaffold ?” 38
Yielding later to the pa pal impatience, Angelo took down the
scaffolding before all final touches had been applied. Then Julius
thought that a little gold should be added here and there, but the weary
artist persuaded him that gold trimmings would hardly become the
Prophets or the Apostles. When for the last time Michael descended from
the scaffold he was exhausted, emaciated, prematurely old. A story says
that his eyes, long accustomed to the subdued illumination of the
chapel, could hardly bear the light of the sun ; 39 and another story
that he found it now easier to read by looking upward than by holding
the page beneath his eyes . 40</p>
<p>The original plan of Julius for the ceiling had been merely a series
of Apostles; Michelangelo prevailed upon him to allow an ampler and
nobler scheme. He divided the convex vault into over a hundred panels by
pic- turing columns and moldings between them; and he enhanced the
tridimen- sional illusion with lusty youthful figures upholding the
cornices or seated on capitals. In the major panels, running along the
crest of the ceiling, Angelo painted episodes from Genesis: the initial
act of creation separates light from darkness; the sun, moon, and
planets come into being at the command of the Creator — a majestic
figure stern of face, powerful of body, with beard and robes flying in
the air; the Almighty, even finer in form and feature than in the
previous panel, extends His right arm to create Adam, while with the
left arm He holds a very pretty angel — this panel is Mi- chelang elo’s
pictorial masterpiece; God, now a much older and patriarchal</p>

<p>CHAP. XVIl)</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>ets pronouncing doom, not to the evangelists expounding the gospel of
love.</p>
<p>In the spandrels of alternate arches Angelo painted magnificent
figures of Daniel, Isaiah, Zecharia, Joel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jonah. In
the other span- drels he pictured the pagan oracles that were believed
to have foretold Christ: the graceful Libyan Sibyl, holding an open book
of the future; the dark, unhappy, powerful Cumaean Sibyl; the studious
Persian; the Delphic and Erythrean Sibyls; these too are such paintings
as rival the sculptures of Pheidias; indeed, all these figures suggest
sculpture; and Michelangelo, con- scripted into an alien art, transforms
it into his own. In the large triangle at one end of the ceiling, and in
two others at the other end, the artist still stayed in the Old
Testament, with the raising of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, the
victory of David over Goliath, the hanging of Haman, the beheading of
Holofernes by Judith. Finally, as if by concession and after- thought,
in the lunettes and arched recesses above the windows, Angelo painted
scenes expounding the genealogy of Mary and Christ.</p>
<p>No one of these pictures quite equals Raphael’s School of Athens in
con - ception, drawing, color, and technique; but taken all together,
they consti- tute the greatest achievement of any man in the history of
painting. The total effect of repeated and careful contemplation is far
greater than in the case of the Stanze. There we feel a happy perfection
of artistry, and an urbane union of pagan and Christian thought. Here we
do not merely per- ceive technical accomplishment — in the perspective,
the foreshortenings, the unrivaled variety of attitudes; we feel the
sweep and breath of genius, al- most as creative as in the wind-swept
figure of the Almighty raising Adam out of the earth.</p>
<p>Here again Michelangelo has given his ruling passion free rein;
and</p>
<p>though the place was the chapel of the popes, the theme and object of
his art was the human body. Like the Greeks, he cared less for the face
and its expression than for the whole physical frame. On the Sistine
ceiling are half a hundred male, a few female, nudes. There are no
landscapes, no vegetation except in picturing the creation of plants, no
decorative ara- besques; as in Signorelli’s frescoes at Orvieto, the
body of man becomes the sole means of decoration as well as of
representation. Signorelli was the one painter, as Iacopo della Quercia
was the one sculptor, from whom Michel- angelo cared to learn. Every
little space left free in the ceiling by the gen- eral pictorial plan is
occupied by a nude figure, not so much beautiful as athletic and strong.
There is no sexual suggestion in them, only the persist- ent display of
the human body as the highest embodiment of energy, vi- tality, life.
Though some timid souls protested against this profusion of</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>476</p>
<p>(chap. XVII</p>
<p>nudity in the house of God, Julius made no recorded objection; he was
a man as broad as his hatreds, and he recognized great art when he saw
it. Perhaps he understood that he had immortalized himself not by the
wars that he had won, but by giving the strange and incalculable
divinity fretting in Angelo freedom to disport itself on the papal
chapel vault.</p>
<p>Julius died four months after the completion of the Sistine ceiling.
Mi- chelangelo was then nearing his thirty-eighth birthday. He had
placed himself at the head of all Italian sculptors by his David and
Pietd; by this ceiling he had equaled or surpassed Raphael in painting;
there seemed no other world left for him to conquer. Surely even he
hardly dreamed that he had over half a century yet to live, that his
most famous painting, his most mature sculpture, were yet to be done. He
mourned the passing of the great Pope, and wondered whether Leo would
have as sure an instinct as Julius for the noble in art. He retired to
his lodgings, and bided his time.</p>
