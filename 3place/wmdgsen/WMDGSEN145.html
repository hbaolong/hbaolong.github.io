<h4 id="chapter-xxvii-the-apostles">CHAPTER XXVII The Apostles</h4>
<p>A.D. 30-95</p>
<p>I. PETER</p>
<p>C HRISTIANITY arose out of Jewish apocalyptic — esoteric revelations
of the coming Kingdom; it derived its impetus from the personality</p>
<p>and vision of Christ; it gained strength from the belief in his
resurrection, and the promise of eternal life; it received doctrinal
form in the theology of Paul; it grew by the absorption of pagan faith
and ritual; it became a triumphant Church by inheriting the organizing
patterns and genius of Rome.</p>
<p>The apostles were apparently unanimous in believing that Christ would
soon return to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.* “ The end of
all things is near,” says the first epistle of Peter; “be serious and
collected,</p>
<p>• Our chief guide for this period is the Acts of the Apostles. It is
universally agreed that</p>
<p>Of the seven letters ascribed in the New Testament to the Twelve
Apostles, criticism in - clines to accept the first of Peter as
substantially genuine, 2 to identify the author of the epistles of John
with the disputed author of the Fourth Gospel; and to reject the rest as
of doubtful authenticity.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>57 &lt;5 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVn</p>
<p>They believed that they had received from Christ or the Holy
Spirit</p>
<p>miraculous powers of inspiration, healing, and speech. Many sick and
infirm persons came to them; some were cured, says Mark, 8 by anointing
with oil — always a popular treatment in the East. The author of Acts
draws a touch- ing picture of the trustful communism in which these
early Christians lived:</p>
<p>There was but one heart and soul in the multitude who had become
believers, and not one of them claimed anything that belonged to him as
his own, but they shared everything they had with one another.</p>
<p>… No one among them was in any want, for any who owned lands</p>
<p>or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds and put them at the
disposal of the Apostles; then they were shared with everyone in pro-
portion to his need. 0</p>
<p>As the number of proselytes increased, the apostles, by a laying on
of hands, ordained seven deacons to administer the affairs of the
community. For some time the Jewish authorities tolerated the sect as
small and harmless; but a s the “Nazarenes” multiplied in a few years
from 120 to 8000, 10 the priests became alarmed. Peter and others were
arrested and questioned by the Sanhedrin; the Sadducees wished to
condemn them to death, but a Pharisee named Gamaliel — probably the
teacher of Paul — advised a sus- pended judgment; as a compromise the
prisoners were flogged and released. A little later (a.d. 30?) Stephen,
one of the ordained deacons, was sum- moned before the Sanhedrin on the
charge that he had “used abusive lan - guage about Moses and about God.”
11 He defended himself with reckiess vehemence:</p>
<p>You stubborn people, with heathen hearts and ears, you are always
opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your forefathers did! Which of the</p>
<p>prophets did not your forefathers persecute? They killed the men</p>
<p>who foretold the coming of the righteous one, whom you have now
betrayed and killed — you who had the Law given you by angels, and did
not obey it! 12 *</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin, in a rage, had him dragged outside the city and stoned
to death. A young Pharisee named Saul aided the attack; thereafter he
went from house to house in Jerusalem, seized adherents of “the Way,”
and put them in jail. 18</p>
<p>The Jewish converts of Greek name and culture, who had had Stephen as
their leader, fled to Samaria and Antioch, where they established strong
Chris- tian communities. Most of the apostles, apparently spared in this
persecution</p>
<p>The speeches of Stephen, Peter, Paul, and others in Acts may have
been invented by the author, after the general custom of ancient
historians.</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>because they still observed the Law, remained in Jerusalem with the
Judaic Christians. While Peter carried the Gospel to the towns of Judea,
James “the Just,” “the brother of the Lord,” became the head of the now
reduced and impoverished church in Jerusalem. James practiced the Law in
all its severity, and rivaled the Essenes in asceticism; he ate no meat,
drank no wine, had only one garment, and never cut his hair or beard.
For eleven years, under his guid- ance, the Christians were left
undisturbed. About 41 another James, the son of Zebedee, was beheaded;
Peter was arrested, but escaped. In 62 James the Just was himself put to
death. Four years later the Jews revolted against Rome. The Jerusalem
Christians, too convinced of the coming “end of the world” to care about
politics, left the city and established themselves in pagan and
pro-Roman Pella, on the farther bank of the Jordan. From that hour
Judaism and Chris- tianity parted. The Jews accused the Christians of
treason and cowardice, and the Christians hailed the destruction of the
Temple by Titus as a fulfillment of Christ’s prophecy. Mutual hatred
enflamed the two faiths, and wrote some of their most pious
literature.</p>
<p>Thereafter Judaic Christianity waned in number and power, and yielded
the new religion to be transformed by the Greek mind. Galilee, where
Christ had lived nearly all his life, and where the Magdalene and the
other women who had been among the first to follow him were now lost in
obscurity, turned a deaf ear to the preachers who proclaimed the
Nazarene as the Son of God. The Jews, who thirsted for liberty, and
reminded themselves daily that “the Lord is One,” were repelled by a
Messiah who ignored their struggle for independence, and were
scandalized by the announcement that a god had been bom in a cave or
stable in one of their villages. Judaic Christianity survived for five
centuries in a little group of Syriac Christians called Ebionim ( “the
poor”), who practiced Christian poverty and the full Jewish Law. At the
end of the second century the Church condemned them as heretics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the apostles and disciples had spread the Good News,
chiefly among the Jews of the Dispersion, 14 from Damascus to Rome.
Philip made converts in Samaria and Caesarea, John developed a strong
church in Ephesus, and Peter preached in the cities of Syria. Like most
of the apos- tles, Peter took a “sister” with him on his missions to
serve as his wife a nd aide. 15 He healed the sick so successfully that
at Samaria a magician, Simon Magus, offered him money for a share in his
mysterious powers. At Joppa he raised Tabitha from apparent death; at
Caesarea he won a Roman cen- turion to Christianity. A vision, says the
Book of Acts, convinced him that he should accept pagan as well as
Jewish converts; and from this time for- ward, with some amiable
vacillations, he contented himself with baptizing, rather than also
circumcizing, non-Jewish proselytes. We feel some of the ardor of these
early missionaries in the first epistle of Peter:</p>
<p>578 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVII</p>
<p>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those [Christian Jews] who</p>
<p>are scattered as foreigners over Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia,</p>
<p>and Bithynia… God bless you and give you perfect peace….</p>
<p>My dearly beloved, I pray you as aliens and exiles, to live
upright</p>
<p>lives among the gentiles so that… they may, from observing the</p>
<p>uprightness of your conduct, come to praise God…. Submit to</p>
<p>all human authority for the Master’s sake…. Live like free men,</p>
<p>but do not make your freedom an excuse for wrong doing….</p>
<p>Servants, be submissive to your masters, and perfectly respectful to
them; not only to those who are kind and considerate, but also to</p>
<p>hose who are unreasonable. You married women, likewise, must be
submissive to your husbands, so that any who refuse to believe…</p>
<p>may be won over when they see how chaste and submissive you are.</p>
<p>You must not adopt the external attractions of arranging your
hair</p>
<p>or wearing jewelry; you must be a quiet and gentle spirit. You
mar-</p>
<p>ried men also must be considerate to your wives; show deference to
women as the weaker sex, sharing the gift of life with you…. Re-</p>
<p>urn not evil for evil…. Above all keep your love for one another</p>
<p>strong, for love covers a multitude of sins. 10</p>
<p>We do not know when and by what stages Peter made his way to Rome.
Jerome ( ca. 390) dates his first arrival there as early as 42. The
tradition that he played a leading role in establishing the Christian
community in the capital has survived all criticism. 17 Lactantius
speaks of Peter’s coming to Rome in Nero’s reign; 18 probably the
apostle visited the city on divers occasions. He free and Paul in prison
labored as rivals to win converts there, until both of them suffered
martyrdom, perhaps in the same year 64. 10 Origen reports that Peter
“was crucified head downward, for he had asked that he might suffer that
way,” 20 per haps hoping that in that position death would come sooner,
or (said the opinion of the faithful) holding himself unworthy to die in
the same manner as Christ. Ancient texts testify that his wife was
killed with him and that he had to see her led to execution. 21 A later
story named Nero’s Circus, on the Vatican field, as the place of his
death. Over the site the Cathedral of St. Peter rose, and claimed to
enshrine his bones.</p>
<p>His missions in Asia Minor and Rome must have helped to preserve many
Judaic elements in Christianity. Through him and the other apostles it
inherited Jewish monotheism, puritanism, and eschatology. Through them
and Paul the Old Testament became the only Bible that first-century
Chris- tianity knew. Till 70 Christianity was preached chiefly in
synagogues or among Jews. The form, ceremony, and vestments of Hebrew
worship passed down into Christian ritual. The Paschal lamb of sacrifice
was subli-</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>mated in the Agnus Dei — the expiatory Lamb of God — of the Catholic
Mass. The appointment of elders ( presbyteri , priests) to govern the
churches was adopted from Jewish methods of administering the synagogue.
Many Judaic festivals — e.g., Passover and Pentecost — were accepted
into the Christian calendar, however altered in content and date. The
Jewish Dispersion aided the rapid dissemination of Christianity; the
frequent movement of Jews from city to city, and their connections
throughout the Empire, co-operated with commerce, Roman roads, and the
Roman peace, to open a path for the Christian faith. In Christ and Peter
Christianity was Jewish; in Paul it became half Greek; in Catholicism it
became half Roman. In Protestantism the Judaic element and emphasis were
restored.</p>

<li>The Persecutor</li>
</ol>
<p>The founder of Christian theology was bom at Tarsus, in Cilicia,
about the tenth year of our era. His father was a Pharisee, and brought
up the youth in the fervent principles of that sect; the Apostle of the
Gentiles never ceased to consider himself a Pharisee, even after he had
rejected the Judaic Law. The father was also a Roman citizen, and
transmitted the precious franchise to his son. Probably the name Paul
was the Greek, equivalent of the Hebrew Saul, so that both names
belonged to the apostle from infancy. 22 He did not receive a classical
education, for no Pharisee would have per- mitted such outright
Hellenism in his son, and no man with Greek training would have written
the bad Greek of the Epistles. Nevertheless, he learned to speak the
language with sufficient fluency to address an Athenian au- dience, and
he occasionally referred to famous passages iri Greek literature. We may
believe that some Stoic theology and ethics passed from the uni- versity
environment of Tarsus into the Christianity of Paul. So he uses the
Stoic term pneuma (breath) for what his English translators call spirit.
Like most Greek cities, Tarsus had followers of the Orphic or other
mystery religions, who believed that the god they worshiped had died for
them, had risen from the grave, and would, if appealed to by lively
faith and proper ritual, save them from Hades, and share with them his
gift of eternal and blessed life. 23 The mystery religions prepared the
Greeks for Paul, and Paul for the Greeks.</p>
<p>After the youth had learned the trade of tentmaking, and had received
instruction in the local synagogue, his father sent him to Jerusalem,
where, Paul tells us, he was “educated at the feet of Gamaliel according
to the</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>(chap, xxvn</p>
<p>strict manner of the Law.” 24 Gamaliel was reputedly the grandson of
Hillel; he succeeded Hillel as president of the Sanhedrin, and carried
on the tradi- tion of interpreting the Law with a lenient regard for the
frailty of man- kind. Stricter Pharisees were shocked to find him gazing
appreciatively even upon pagan women. 25 He was so learned that the
Jews, who keenly honor scholarship, called him “the beauty of the Law,”
and gave to him first, as to only six men after him, the title of
rabban, “our master.” From him and others Paul learned that shrewd and
subtle, sometimes casuistic and sophisti- cal, manner of Biblical
interpretation which was to disport itself in the Talmud. Despite Paul’s
initiation into Hellenis m he remained to the end a Jew in mind and
character, uttered no doubt of the Torah’s inspiration, and proudly
maintained the divine election of the Jews as the medium of man’s
salvation.</p>
<p>He describes himself as “insignificant in appearance,” 20 and adds:
“to keep me from being too much elated, a bitter physical affliction was
sent me”; 27 he does not further specify. Tradition pictured him at
fifty as a bent and bald and bearded ascetic, with vast forehead, pale
face, stern coun- tenance, and piercing eyes; Diirer imagined him so in
one of the greatest drawings of all time; but in truth these
representations are literature and art, not history.</p>
<p>His mind was of a type frequent among Jews: penetrating and
passionate rather than genial and urbane; emotional and imaginative
rather than objec- tive and impartial; he was powerful in action because
he was narrow in thought. Even more than Spinoza he was a “God -
intoxicated man,” con - sumed with religious enthusiasm in the literal
sense of this word — holding “a god within.” He believed himself
divinely inspired, and endowed with the ability to work miracles. He was
also a practical soul, capable of laborious organization, impatiently
patient in founding and preserving Christian com- munities. As in so
many men, his faults and virtues were near allied and mutually
indispensable. He was impetuous and courageous, dogmatic and decisive,
domineering and energetic, fanatical and creative, proud before man and
humble before God, violently wrathful and capable of the ten- derest
love. He advised his followers to “bless them that persecute you,” but
he could hope that his enemies — “the party of circumcision”— “would get
themselves emasculated.” 28 He knew his failings, struggled against
them, and beg ged his converts to “put up with a little folly from me.”
29 The post - script to his first epistle to the Corinthians sums him
up: “This farewell I, Paul, add in my own hand. A curse upon anyone who
has no love for the Lord! Lord, come quickly! The blessing of the Lord
Jesus be with you! My love be with you all.” He was what he had to be to
do what he did.</p>
<p>He began by attacking Christianity in the name of Judaism, and
ended</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>5 8l</p>
<p>by rejecting Judaism in the name of Christ; at every moment he was an
apostle. Shocked by Stephen’s disrespect for the Law, he joined in
killing him, and led the first persecution of Christians in Jerusalem.
Hearing that the new faith had made converts in Damascus, he obtained
authorization from the high priest to go there, arrest all “who belonged
to the Way,” and bring them in chains to Jerusalem (a.d. 31?). 80 It may
be that the fervor of his persecution was due to secret doubts; he could
be cruel, but not with- out remorse; possibly the vision of Stephen
stoned to death, perhaps even some youthful glimpse of Golgotha,
troubled his memory and his journey, and fevered his imagination. As his
party neared Damascus, says the Acts,</p>
<p>a sudden light flashed upon him from heaven, and he fell to the</p>
<p>ground. Then he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why do</p>
<p>you persecute me?” “Who are you, sir?” he asked. “I am Jesus,”…</p>
<p>said the voice…. Saul’s fellow -travelers stood speechless, for
they</p>
<p>heard the voice but could not see anyone. When he got up from the
ground and opened his eyes he could see nothing. They had to take him by
the hand and lead him into Damascus. For three days he could not see.
81</p>
<p>No one can say what natural processes underlay this pivotal
experience The fatigue of a long journey, the strength of the desert
sun, perhaps a stroke of heat lightning in the sky, acting by
accumulation upon a frail and possibly epileptic body, and a mind
tortured by doubt and guilt, may have brought to culmination the
half-conscious process by which the pas- sionate denier became the
ablest preacher of Stephen’s Christ. Hip Greek environment in Tarsus had
spoken of a Soter or Saviour who redeemed mankind; his Jewish lore had
told of a Messiah to come; how could he be sure that this mysterious and
fascinating Jesus, for whom men were ready to die, was not the promised
one? When, weak and still blind at the end of his journey, he felt upon
his face the kindly, soothing hands of a converted Jew, “something like
sca les dropped from his eyes, and his sight was re- stored; he got up
and was baptized, and after taking some food, regained his strength.” 32
A few days later he entered the synagogues of Damascus, and told their
congregations that Jesus was the Son of God.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Missionary</li>
</ol>
<p>The governor of Damascus, urged by the offended Jews, issued an order
for Paul’s arrest; Paul’s new friends lowered him in a basket over the
city walls. For three years, he tells us, he preached Christ in the
hamlets of Arabia. Returning to Jerusalem, he won the forgiveness and
friendship of Peter, and.</p>
<p>5^2 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXVH</p>
<p>lived with him for a while. Most of the apostles distrusted him, but
Barnabas, himself a recent convert, gave him a cordial hand, and
persuaded thejerusa- lem church to commission its persecutor as a bearer
of the Good News that the Messiah had come and would soon establish the
Kingdom. The Greek- speaking Jews to whom he brought the Gospel tried to
kill him, and the apostles, perhaps fearing that his ardor would
endanger them all, sent him to Tarsus.</p>
<p>For eight years he was lost to history in his native city; and
perhaps again he felt the influence of the mystic salvation theology
popular among the Greeks. Then Barnabas came and asked his aid in
ministering to the church at Antioch. Working together (43-44?), they
made so many converts that Antioch soon led all other cities in the
number of its Christians. There for the first time the “Believers,”
“Disciples,” “Brethren,” or “Saints,” as they had called themselves,
received from the pagans, perhaps in scorn, the name Christianoi —
followers of the Messiah or Anointed One. There too, for the first time,
gentiles (i.e., people of the gentes or nations) were won to the new
faith. Most of these were “God - fearers,” predominantly women, who had
already accepted the monotheism, and in some part the ritual, of the
Jews.</p>
<p>The Antioch converts were not as poor as those in Jerusalem; a con-
siderable minority belonged to the merchant class. With the enthusiasm
of a youthful and growing movement, they raised a fund to spread the
Gospel. The elders of the church “laid their hands upon” Barnabas and
Paul, and sent them out on what history, unduly belittling Barnabas,
calls the “first missionary journey of Saint Paul” (45 -47? ). They
sailed to Cyprus, and met with encouraging success among the many Jews
of that island. From Paphos they took ship to Perga in Pamphylia, and
traveled over dan- gerous mountain roads to Antioch in Pisidia. The
synagogue gave them a courteous hearing; but when they began to preach
to gentiles as well, the orthodox Jews persuaded the municipal officers
to banish the missionaries. Similar difficulties developed at Iconium;
and at Lystra Paul was stoned, d ragged out of the town, and left for
dead. Still “full of the joy of the Holy Spirit,” Paul and Barnabas
carried the Gospel to Derbe. Then they returned</p>
<p>For some leading disciples of Jerusalem, hearing that the two
preachers were accepting gentile converts without requiring
circumcision, had come to Antioch “to teach the brethren that unless
they were circumcized as Moses prescribed, they could not be saved.” 33
To the Jew circumcision was not so much a ritual of health as a holy
symbol of his people’s ancient covenant with God; and the Christian Jew
was appalled at the thought of breaking</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>

<p>hat covenant. For their part Paul and Barnabas realized that if these
emis- saries had their way, Christianity would never be accepted by any
signifi- cant number of gentiles; it would remain “a Jewish heresy” (as
Heine was to call it), and would fade out in a century. They went down
to Jerusalem (50?) and fought the matter out with the apostles, nearly
all of whom were still faithful worshipers in the Temple. James was
reluctant to consent; Peter defended the two missionaries; finally it
was agreed that pagan prose- lytes should be required only to abstain
from immorality and from the eating of sacrificial or strangled animals.
84 Apparently Paul eased the way by promising financial support for the
impoverished community at Jerusa- lem from the swelling funds of the
Antioch church. 85</p>
<p>The issue, however, was too vital to be so easily laid. A second
group of orthodox Jewish Christians came from Jerusalem to Antioch,
found Peter eating with gentiles, and persuaded him to separate himself,
with the con- verted Jews, from the uncircumcized proselytes. We do not
know Peter’s side of this episode; Paul tells us that “he withstood
Peter to his face” at Antioch, 86 and accused him of hypocrisy; perhaps
Peter had merely wished, like Paul, to be “all things to all men.”</p>
<p>Probably in the year 50 Paul left on his second missionary journey.
He had quarreled with Barnabas, who now disappeared from history in his
native Cyprus. Revisiting his churches in Asia Minor, Paul attached to
himself at Lystra a young disciple named Timothy, whom he came to love
with a profound affection that had long been starved for an object.
Together they went through Phrygia and Galatia as far north as
Alexandria Troas. Here Paul made the acquaintance of Luke, an
uncircumcized proselyte to Judaism, a man of good mind and heart,
probably the author of the Third Gospel and the Book of Acts — both
designed to soften the conflicts that from the beginning marked the
history of Christianity. From Troas Paul, Timothy, and another aide,
Silas, sailed to Macedonia, for the first time touching European soil.
At Philippi, where Antony had conquered Brutus, Paul and Silas were
arrested as disturbers of the peace, were scourged and jailed, but were
freed on the discovery that they were Roman citizens. Pass- ing on to
Thessalonica, Paul went to the synagogue, and for three Sabbaths
preached to the Jews. A few were convinced, and organized a church;
others roused the town against Paul on the ground that he was
proclaiming a new king; and his friends had to spirit him away to Beraea
during the night. There “the Jews received the message with great
eagerness”; but the Thessalonians came to denounce Paul as an enemy of
Judaism, and he took ship for Athens (51?), discouraged and alone.</p>
<p>Here, in the heart of pagan religion, science, and philosophy, he
found himself quite friendless. There were few Jews to give him a
hearing; he</p>
<p>584 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP.XXVII</p>
<p>had to take his stand in the market place, like any modern haranguer
of city crowds, and compete with a dozen rivals for passing ears. Some
lis- teners argued with him; some laughed at him, and asked, “What is
this rag - picker trying to make out?” 87 Several were interested, and
led him up to the Areopagus, or Hill of Mars, for a quieter hearing. He
told them how he had noted, in Athens, an altar inscribed “To an Unknown
God”; this dedication, which probably expressed the desire of the donors
to thank, appease, or enlist the aid of a god of whose name they were
not certain, Paul interpreted as a confession of ignorance concerning
the nature of God. He proceeded with high eloquence:</p>
<p>Whom therefore ye worship though ye know him not, him I de-</p>
<p>clare unto you. God, who made the world and all things therein</p>
<p>… dwells not in temples made with hands…. It is he that giveth</p>
<p>life and breath unto all…. And he made of one blood all the nations
of mankind… that they should seek God, if haply they might feel</p>
<p>after him, though he be not far from us; for in him we live and move
and have our being, as certain also of your own poets have said.*</p>
<p>… Forasmuch, then, as we are the offspring of God, we ought not</p>
<p>o think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
graven by the art and device of man. Howbeit, those past times of
ignorance God hath overlooked; but now he commandeth all men everywhere
to repent, because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge</p>
<p>he world… by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof he</p>
<p>hath given assurance unto all, in that he hath raised him from
the</p>
<p>dead. 38</p>
<p>It was a brave effort to reconcile Christianity with Greek
philosophy.! Nevertheless, it impressed only a few; the Athenians had
heard too many ideas to have much enthusiasm for any. Paul left the city
in disappointment and went to Corinth, where commerce had gathered a
substantial com- munity of Jews. He stayed there eighteen months
(51-52?), earning his living as a tentmaker, and preaching every Sabbath
in the synagogue. The leader of the synagogue was converted, and so many
others that the alarmed Jews indicted Paul before the Roman governor,
Gallio, on the charge of “trying to induce people to worship God in ways
that are against the law.” Gallio repl ied: “As it is only a question of
words and titles and your own law, you must look after it yourselves; I
will not decide such matters”; and he dismissed them from the court. The
two parties fell to blows, “but Gallio paid no attention.” 80 Paul
offered his gospel to the gentiles of Corinth, and made many converts
among them. Christianity may have seemed to</p>

<p>5 85</p>
<p>hem an acceptable variation of the mystery faiths that had so often
told them of resurrected saviors; possibly in accepting it they
assimilated it to these beliefs, and influenced Paul to interpret
Christianity in terms familiar to the Hellenistic mind.</p>
<p>From Corinth Paul went to Jerusalem (53?) to “salute the church.”
Soon, however, he was off on his third missionary journey, visiting the
Christian communities in Antioch and Asia Minor, and reinvigorating them
with his fervor and confidence. At Ephesus he spent two years, and “did
such extraor - dinary wonders” that many looked upon him as a miracle
-worker, and sought to cure ailments by applying to the sick the linens
Paul had used. The manufacturers of the images that pagan worshipers
dedicated in the Temple of Artemis found their trade slackening; perhaps
Paul had repeated here his Athenian indictment of image worship, or
idolatry. One Demetrius, who made silver models of the great shrine for
pious pilgrims, organized a protest against Paul and the new faith, and
led to the city theater a crowd of Greeks whose catchword, repeated for
two hours, was “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” A local official
dissolved the gathering, but Pau l thought it the better part of valor
to leave for Macedonia.</p>
<p>He spent some happy months with the little congregations he had
founded in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beraea. Hearing that dissension
and immoral- ity were disordering the church at Corinth, he not only
reprimanded it in several epistles, but went down to it in person (56?)
to face his detractors. They had accused him of profiting materially
from his preaching, laughed at his visions, and renewed the demand that
all Christians should obey the Jewish Law. Paul reminded the turbulent
community that he had every- where earned his living with the work of
his hands; and as to material profit, what had he not suffered from his
missions? — eight floggings, one stoning, three shipwrecks, and a
thousand dangers from robbers, patriots, and streams. 40 Amid this
turmoil word was brought him that the “party of the</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXVII</p>

<li>The Theologian</li>
</ol>
<p>The leaders of the mother church gave him “a hearty welcome” ( 57?);
but privately they admonished him:</p>
<p>You see, brother, how many thousand believers there are among</p>
<p>he Jews, all of them zealous upholders of the Law. They have been</p>
<p>old that you teach all Jews who live among the heathen to turn away
from Moses, that you tell them not to circumcize their children, nor to
observe the old customs…. They will be sure to hear that you</p>
<p>have come. So do what we tell you. We have four men here who are
under a vow. Join them, undergo the rites of purification with them, and
pay their expenses…. Then everybody will understand that</p>
<p>here is no truth in the stories told about you, but that you
yourself</p>
<p>observe the Law. 41</p>
<p>Paul took the advice in good spirit, and went through the rites of
purifica- tion. But when some Jews saw him in the Temple they raised an
outcry against him as “the man who teaches everybody everywhere against
our people and the Law.” A mob seized him, dragged him from the Temple,
and “were trying to kill him” when a squad of Roman sol diers rescued
him by arrest. Paul turned to speak to the crowd, and affirmed both his
Judaism and his Christianity. They shouted for his death. The Roman
officer ordered him to be flogged, but desisted when he learned of
Paul’s Roman citizenship. The next day he brought the prisoner before
the Sanhedrin. Paul addressed it, proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and won
some support; but his excited opponents again sought to do him violence,
and the officer withdrew him into the barracks. That night a nephew of
Paul came to warn him that forty Jews had vowed not to eat or drink
until they had killed him. The officer, fearing a disturbance that would
compromise him, sent Paul in the night to the procurator Felix at
Caesarea.</p>
<p>Five days later the high priest and some elders came up from
Jerusalem, and accused Paul of being “a pest and a disturber of the
peace among Jews all over the world.” Paul admitted that he was
preaching a new religion, but added: “I believe everything that is
taught in the Law.” Feli x dismissed the accusers; nevertheless, he kept
Paul under house arrest — accessible to friends — for two years
(58-60?), hoping, perhaps, for a substantial bribe. When Festus
succeeded Felix he suggested that Paul should stand trial before him at
Jerusalem. Fearing that hostile environment, Paul exercised his rights
as a Roman citzen, and demanded trial before the emperor. King Agrippa,
passing through Caesarea, gave him another hearing, and judged</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVII )</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>him “mad with great learning,” but otherwise innocent; “he might be
let go,” said Agrippa, “if he had not appealed to the emperor.” Paul was
put on a trading vessel, which sailed so leisurely that it encountered a
winter storm before it could reach Italy. Through fourteen days of
tempest, we are told, he gave crew and passengers an encouraging example
of a man superior to death and confident of rescue. The ship broke to
pieces on Malta’s rocks, but all on board swam safely to shore. Three
months later Paul arrived in Rome (61?).</p>
<p>The Roman authorities treated him leniently, awaiting his accusers
from Palestine, and Nero’s leisure to hear the case. He was allowed to
live in a house of his choosing, with a soldier to guard him; he could
not move about freely, but he could receive whomever he wished. He
invited the leading Jews of Rome to come to him; they heard him
patiently, but when they perceived that in his judgment the observance
of the Jewish Law was not necessary to salvation, they turned away; the
Law seemed to them the indispensable prop and solace of Jewish life.
“Understand, then,” said Paul, “that this message of God’s salvation has
been sent to the heathen. They will listen to it!” 42 His attitude
offended also the Christian community that</p>
<p>He found some solace in sending long and tender letters to his
distant flocks. For ten years now he had written such epistles; there
were doubtless many more than have come down to us under his name.* They
did not come directly from his pen; he dictated them, often adding a
postscript in his own rough hand; he left them apparently unrevised,
with all their repetitions, obscurities, and bad grammar on their head.
Nevertheless, the depth and sincerity of their feeling, their angry
devotion to a great cause, their pro- fusion of noble and memorable
speech make them the most forceful and eloquent letters in a ll
literature; even Cicero’s charm seems slight beside this passionate
faith. Here are strong words of love from one to whom his churches were
his fiercely protected children; violent attacks upon his numberless
enemies; reprimands to sinners, backsliders, and divisive dis- putants;
and everywhere tender exhortations.</p>
<p>• Of these we may regard the letters to the Galatians, Corinthians,
and Romans as authentic; probably also those to the Thcssalonians,
Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon; perhaps even the epistle to the
Ephesians. 43</p>

<p>Be filled with thanksgiving. Let the presence of Christ dwell in
you,</p>
<p>a well-spring of abounding wisdom; teach and encourage one another
with hymns and songs of the spiritual life; make music in your hearts in

<p>Here are great phrases that all Christendom quotes and cherishes:
“the letter</p>
<p>I have made myself everyone’s slave, so as to win over all the
more.</p>
<p>To the Jews I have become like a Jew to win Jews… to those</p>

<p>have become all things to all men, that I might save some of
them.</p>
<p>I do it all for the sake of the Good News, that I may share its
blessings with the rest. 48</p>
<p>These epistles were preserved, and often publicly read, by the
congrega- tions to which they were addressed. By the end of the first
century many of them were widely known; Clement of Rome refers to them
in 97, Ignatius and Polycarp soon afterwards; gradually they entered
into the subtlest theology of the Church. Moved by his own somber spirit
and remorse, and his transforming vision of Christ; influenced perhaps
by Platonist and Stoic denunciations of matter and the body as evil;
recalling, it may be, Jew ish and pagan customs of sacrificing a
“scapegoat” for the sins of the people, Paul created a theology of which
none but the vaguest warrants can be found in the words of Christ: that
every man bom of woman inherits the guilt of Adam, and can be saved from
eternal damnation only by the atoning death of the Son of God.* 50 Such
a conception was more agreeable to the pagans than to the Jews. Egypt,
Asia Minor, and Hellas had long since believed in gods — Osiris, Attis,
Dionysus — who had died to redeem mankind; such titles as So ter
(Savior) and Eleutherios (Deliverer) had been applied to these deities;
and the word Kyrios (Lord), used by Paul of Christ, was the term given
in Syrian-Greek cults to the dying and redeem- ing Dionysus. 52 The
gentiles of Antioch and other Greek cities, never having</p>
<p>• The ancient Jews shared with the Canaanites, Moabites, Phoenicians,
Carthaginians, and other petmles the custom of sacrificing a child, even
a beloved son, to appease the wrath of Heaven. In the course of time a
condemned criminal might be substituted. In Babylonia he was dressed in
royal robes to represent the son of the king, and was then scourged and
hanged. A similar sacrifice took place in Rhodes at the feast of Cronus.
The offering of a lamb or kid at the Passover was probably a civilized
mitigation of ancient human sacrifice. “On the day of atonement,” says
Frazer, “the Jewish high pnest laid both his hands on the head of a live
goat, confessed over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
and having thereby transferred the sins of the people to the beast, sent
it away into the wilderness.” 61</p>

<p>589</p>
<p>known Jesus in the flesh, could only accept him after the manner of
their savior gods. “Behold,” said Paul, “I show you a mystery.” 63</p>
<p>Paul added to this popular and consoling theology certain mystic con-
ceptions already made current by the Book of Wisdom and the philosophy
of Philo. Christ, said Paul, is “the wisdom of God,” 54 the first -born
Son of God; “he is before all things, in him all things exist… through
him all things have been created.” BB He is not the Jewish Messiah who
will deliver Israel from bondage; he is the Logos whose death will
deliver all men. Through these interpretations Paul could neglect the
actual life and sayings of Jesus, which he had not direcdy known, and
could stand on an equality with the immediate apostles, who were no
match for him in metaphysical speculation; he could give to the life of
Christ, and to the life of man, high roles in a magnificent drama that
embraced all souls and all eternity. More- over, he could answer the
troublesome questions of those who asked why Christ, if very god, had
allowed himself to be put to death: Christ had died to redeem a world
lost to Satan by Adam’s sin; he had to die to break the bonds of death
and open the gates of heaven to all who should be touched by the grace
of God.</p>
<p>Two factors, said Paul, determine who shall be saved by Christ’s
death: divine election and humble faith. God chooses from all eternity
those whom he will bless with his grace, and those whom he will damn. 50
Nevertheless, Paul bestirred himself to awaken faith as a rod to catch
God’s grace; only through such “assurance of things longed for,” such
“confidence in things unseen,” 57 can the soul experience that profound
change which makes a new man, unites the believer with Christ, and
allows him to share in the fruits of Christ’s death. Good works and the
performance of all the 613 precepts of the Jewish Law will not suffice,
said Paul; they cannot remake the inner man, or wash the soul of sin.
The death of Christ had ended the epoch of the Law; now there should no
more be Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female, for “in union
with Christ Jesus you are all one.” 88 As to good works combined with
faith, Paul never tired of inculcating them; and the most famous words
ever spoken about love are his own:</p>
<p>Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not</p>
<p>love, I am become as sounding brass or tinkling cymbal. And though I
have the gift of preaching, and understand all mysteries, and have</p>
<p>all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I can move moun-
tains; if I have not love I am nothing. And though I give away
every-</p>
<p>hing that I am, and give myself, but do it in pride, not love, it
profits me nothing. Love is patient and kind. It is not envious or
boastful.</p>
<p>… It does not insist on its rights…. It never fails. So faith,
hope</p>
<p>and love endure, these three; and the greatest of these is love.

<p>He spoke bravely, but he was desolate. One ancient tradition said
that he was freed, went to Asia and Spain, preached again, and once more
found himself a prisoner in Rome; probably he was never freed. Without
wife or children to comfort him, with all friends gone but one, only his
faith could</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>chap, xxvn)</p>
<p>59 *</p>
<p>support him; and perhaps that too was shaken. Like the other
Christians of his age, he hhd lived on the hope of seeing Christ return.
He had written to the Philippians: “We are eagerly awaiting the coming
of a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ…. The Lord is coming soon.” 07 And to
the Corin - thians: “The appointed time has grown very short. From now
on, those who have wives should live as though they had none… and those
who buy anything as if they did not own it…. For the present shape of
the world is passing away… Maranatha! Lord, come quickly!” 68 But in his
second epistle to the Thessalonians he reproved them for neglecting the
affairs of this world in expectation of Christ’s early advent; the
coming will be delayed until the “Adversary”— Satan — “makes his
appearance and pro - claims himself to be God.” 89 We surmise from his
last letters that he had struggled, during his imprisonment, to
reconcile his early faith with the long delay in the Farousia or Second
Appearance. More and more he put his hope beyond the grave, and made for
his own solace the great adjustment that saved Christianity — the
transformation of the belief in Christ’s earthly return into the hope of
union with him in heaven after death. Apparently he was tried again, and
convicted; Caesar and Christ came face to face, and Caesar won for a
day. We do not know the precise charge; probably now, as at
Thessalonica, Paul was accused of “disobeying the emperor’s decrees, and
claiming that someone else called Jesus is king.” 70 This was a crime of
maiestas, punishable with death. We have no ancient record of the trial;
but Tertullian, writing about 200, reports that Paul was beheaded at
Rome; and Origen, about 220, writes that “Paul suffered martyrdom in
Rome under Nero.” 71 Probably, as a Roman citizen, he had the honor of a
distinct execution, and was not mingled with the Christians crucified
after the fire of 64. Tradition united him with Peter in a simultaneous,
though separate, martyrdom; and a touching legend pictured the great
rivals meeting in friendship on the road to death. Over the place on the
Via Ostia, where the Church believed that Paul had found peace, a shrine
was raised in the third century. Remade in ever fairer form, it stands
today as the basilica of San Paolo fuori le Mura — St. Paul beyond the
Walls.</p>
<p>It is a fit symbol of his victory. The emperor who condemned him died
a coward’s death, and soon nothing survived of his inordinate works. But
from the defeated Paul came the theological structure of Christianity,
as from Paul and Peter the astonishing organization of the Church. Paul
had found a dream of Jewish eschatology, confined in Judaic Law; he had
freed and broadened it into a faith that could move the world. With the
patience of a statesman he had interwoven the ethics of the Jews with
the meta- physics of the Greeks, and had transformed the Jesus of the
Gospels into the Christ of theology. He had created a new mystery, a new
form of the</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>59 *</p>
<p>(chap. XXVII</p>
<p>resurrection drama, which would absorb and survive all the rest. He
had replaced conduct with creed as the test of virtue, and in that sense
had begun the Middle Ages. It was a tragic change, but perhaps humanity
had willed it so; only a few saints could achieve the imitation of
Christ, but many souls could rise to faith and courage in the hope of
eternal life.</p>
<p>The influence of Paul was not immediately felt. The communities that
he had established were tiny isles in a pagan sea. The church at Rome
was Peter’s, and remained faithful to his memory. For a century after
Paul’s death he was almost forgotten. But when the first generations of
Christianity had passed away, and the oral tradition of the apostles
began to fade, and a hundred heresies disordered the Christian mind, the
epistles of Paul provided the framework for a stabilizing system of
belief that united the scattered congregations into a powerful
Church.</p>
<p>Even so, the man who had detached Christianity from Judaism was still
so essentially Jewish in intensity of character and sternness of
morality that the Middle Ages, adopting paganism into a colorful
Catholicism, saw no kindred spirit in him, built few churches to him,
seldom sculptured his figure or used his name. Fifteen centuries went by
before Luther made Paul the Aposde of the Reformation, and Calvin found
in him the somber texts of the predestinarian creed. Protestantism was
the triumph of Paul over Peter; Fundamentalism is the triumph of Paul
over Christ.</p>
<ol start="13" type="a">
<li>JOHN</li>
</ol>
<p>The accidents of history have transmitted Paul to us in comparative
clarity, and have left the apostle John in obscurity and mystery.
Besides three epistles, two major works have come down to us under his
name. Criticism tentatively assigns the Book of Revelation to the year
69-70, 72 and to another John, “the Presbyter” mentioned by Papias
(135). 78 Justin Martyr (135) attributes th is powerful Apocalypse to
the “beloved” apostle; 74 but as early as the fourth century Eusebius 76
noted that some scholars doubted its authenticity. The author must have
been a man of considerable prominence, for he addresses the churches of
Asia in a tone of menacing authority. If the apostle wrote it (and we
may provisionally continue to think so), we can understand why, like his
brother James, he was called Boanerges, Son of Thunder. In Ephesus,
Smyrna, Pergamum, Sardis, and other cities of Asia Minor, John, rather
than Peter or Paul, was looked upon as the highest head of the Church.
Tradition as reported by Eusebius 70 held that John had been banished to
Patmos by Domitian, and had on that Aegean</p>

<p>isle written both the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. He lived to
so great an age that people said he would never die.</p>
<p>In form Revelation resembles the books of Daniel and Enoch. Such</p>
<p>prophetic-symbolic visions were a literary device frequently used by
the Jews of the age; there were several other apocalypses (“hidden
things revealed”), but this one surpassed all the rest in lurid
eloquence. Starting</p>
<p>In a succession of visions the author sees the punishments that will
fall upon Rome and its empire. A plague of locusts will for five months
torture all inhabitants except the 144,000 Jews who have on their
foreheads the sign of Christianity. 77 Other angels will empty “the
seven vials of God’s wrath” upon the earth, afflicting men with terrible
sores, and turning the sea “into blood like a dead man’s,” so that
“every living thing in the sea” will die. Another angel will let loose
the full heat of the sun upon all unrepentant men ; another will cover
the earth with darkness; four angels will lead “twice 10,000 times
10,000” knights to slaughter a third of mankind. Four horsemen will ride
forth to “kill the people with sword, famine, death, and the wild
animals of the earth.” 78 A great earthquake will tumble the planet into
ruins; huge hailstones will fall upon the surviving infidels, and Rome
will be utterly destroyed. The kings of the earth will come together on
the plains of Armageddon to make their last stand against God; but they
will be overwhelmed in death. Satan and his cohorts, everywhere
defeated, will be plunged into Hell. Only true Christians will be saved
from these calamities; and those who have suffered for Christ’s sake,
who have been “washed in the blood of the Lamb,” 70 will receive
abounding reward.</p>
<p>After a thousand years Satan will be released to prey again upon
mankind; sin will mount again in an unbelieving world; and the forces of
evil will make a last effort to undo the work of God. But they will once
more be overcome, and this time Satan and his followers will be cast
into Hell for- ever. Then will come the Last Judgment, when all the dead
will be raised</p>

<p>from their graves, and the drowned will be drawn up out of the seas.
On that dread day all “whose names are not found in the Book of Life”
will be “flung into… a burning lake of fire and brimstone.” 80 The
faithful will “gather for God’s great banquet, and will eat the bodies
of kings, com - manders, mighty men… the bodies of all men, slaves or
freemen, high or low,” 81 who have not heeded the call of Christ. A new

<p>The influence of the Book of Revelation was immediate, enduring, and
profound. Its prophecies of salvation for loyal believers, and of
punishment for their enemies, became the sustenance of a persecuted
Church. Its theory of the millennium solaced those who mourned the long
delay in the second coming of Christ. Its vivid images and brilliant
phrases entered into both the popular and the literary speech of
Christendom. For nineteen centuries men have interpreted the events of
history as fulfillments of its visions; and in some recesses of the
white man’s world it still gives its dark colors and bitter flavor to
the creed of Christ.</p>
<p>It seems incredible that the Apocalypse and the Fourth Gospel should
have come from the same hand. The Apocalypse is Jewish poetry, the
Fourth Gospel is Greek philosophy. Perhaps the apostle wrote Revelation
in justifi- able wrath afte r Nero’s persecution, and the Gospel in the
mellow meta - physics of his old age (a.d. 90? ). His memories of the
Master may by this time have faded a bit, so far as one could ever
forget Jesus; and doubtless in the isles and cities of Ionia he had
heard many an echo of Greek mysticism and philosophy. Plato had set a
theme by picturing the Ideas of God as the patterns on which all things
were formed; the Stoics had combined these Ideas into the Logos
Spermatikos or fertilizing wisdom of God; the Neo- Pythagoreans had made
the Ideas a divine person; and Philo had turned them into the Logos or
Reason of God, a second divine principle, through which God created, and
communicated with, the world. If we reread the famous exordium of the
Fourth Gospel with all this in mind, and retain the Logos of the Greek
original in place of the translation Word, we perceive at once that John
has joined the philosophers:</p>
<p>In the beginning was the Logos; the Logos was with God, and the</p>
<p>Logos was God…. All things were made by the Logos; without</p>
<p>THE APOSTLES</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIl)</p>
<p>him nothing was made that was made. It was by him that all things</p>
<p>came into existence…. So the Logos became flesh and blood, and</p>
<p>dwelt amongst us.</p>
<p>Just as Philo, learned in Greek speculation, had felt a need to
rephrase Judaism in forms acceptable to the logic-loving Greeks, so
John, having lived for two generations in a Hellenistic environment,
sought to give a Greek philosophical tinge to the mystic Jewish doctrine
that the Wisdom of God was a living being , 83 and to the Christian
doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah. Consciously or not, he continued
Paul’s work of detaching Christianity from Judaism. Christ was no longer
presented as a Jew, living more or less under the Jewish Law; he was
made to address the Jews as “you,” and to speak of their Law as “yours”;
he was not a Messiah sent “to save the lost sheep of Israel,” he was the
coeternal Son of God; not merely the future judge of mankind, but the
primeval creator of the universe. In this perspective the Jewish life of
the man Jesus could be put into the back- ground, faded almost as in
Gnostic heresy; and the god Christ was assimilated to the religious and
philosophical traditions of the Hellenistic mind. Now the pagan world —
even the anti-Semitic world — could accept him as its own.</p>
<p>Christianity did not destroy paganism; it adopted it. The Greek mind,
dying, came to a transmigrated life in the theology and liturgy of the
Church; the Greek language, having reigned for centuries over
philosophy, became the vehicle of Christian literature and ritual; the
Greek mysteries passed down into the impressive mystery of the Mass.
Other pagan cultures con- tributed to the syncretist result. From Egypt
came the ideas of a divine trinity, the Last Judgment, and a personal
immortality of reward and pun- ishment; from Egypt the adoration of the
Mother and Child, and the mystic theosophy that made Neoplatonism and
Gnosticism, and obscured the Chris- tian creed; there, too, Christian
monasticism would find its exemplars and its source. From Phrygia came
the worship of the Great Mother; from Syria the resurrection drama of
Adonis; from Thrace, perhaps, the cult of Dionysus, the dying and saving
god. From Persia came millennarianism, the “ages of the world,” the
“final conflagration,” the dualism of Satan and God, of Darkness and
Light; already in the Fourth Gospel Christ is the “Light shining in the
darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.” 84 The Mithraic ritual
so closely resembled the eucharistic sacrifice of the Mass that
Christian fathers charged the Devil with inventing these similarities to
mislead frail minds. 85 Christianity was the last great creation of the
ancient pagan world.</p>
