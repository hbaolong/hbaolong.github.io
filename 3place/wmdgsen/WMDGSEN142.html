<h4 id="chapter-xxiv-the-hellenistic-revival">CHAPTER XXIV The
Hellenistic Revival</h4>
<p>I. ROMAN EGYPT</p>
<p>E GYPT should have been the happiest of lands, for not only was the
earth freely nourished by the Nile, but the country was the most self-
sufficient in the whole Mediterranean basin — rich in cereals and
fruits, cut- ting three crops a year, unexcelled in its industries,
exporting to a hundred nations, and seldom disturbed by foreign or civil
war. And yet — perhaps for these reasons — “The Egyptians,” Josephus
notes, “appear never in all their history to have enjoyed one day of
freedom.” 1 Their wealth tempted, their semitropical lassitude suffered,
one despot or conqueror after another through fifty centuries.</p>
<p>Rome classed Egypt not as a province but as the property of the
emperor, and ruled it through a prefect responsible only to him. Native
Greek officials administered the three divisions — Lower, Middle, and
Upper Egypt, and the thirty- six “nomes” or counties; and the official
language remained Greek. No attempt was made to urbanize the population,
for Egypt’s imperial function was to be the granary of Rome. Large
tracts of land were taken from the priests and turned over to Roman or
Alexandrian capitalists to be worked as latifundia by fellaheen
accustomed to merciless exploitation. The state capitalism of the
Ptolemies was continued in reduced form. Every step in the agricultural
process was planned and controlled by the state: proliferating
bureaucrats determined what crops should be sown and in what quantities,
annually allotted the requi- site seed, received the product into
government warehouses ( thesauroi , treas- uries), exported Rome’s
quota, took out t axes in kind, and sold the rest to the market. Corn
and flax were state monopolies from seed to sale; so, at least in the
Fayum, was the production of bricks, perfumes, and sesame oil. 2 Private
enter- prise was permitted in other fields, but under ubiquitous
regulation. All mineral resources were owned by the state, and the
quarrying of marble and precious stones was a governmental
privilege.</p>
<p>Domestic industry, already old in Egypt, now expanded in the towns —
Ptolema’is, Memphis, Thebes, Oxyrhynchus, Sa’is, Bubastis, Naucratis,
Heliopolis; in Alexandria it was half the life of the vibrant capital.
Apparendy the paper industry had reached the capitalist stage, for
Strabo tells how the owners of the papyrus plantations limited
production to lift the price. 8 Priests used the temple precincts as
factories and turned out fine linens for their own use and</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 499</p>
<p>for the market. Slaves outside of domestic service were few in Egypt,
since “free” workers wer e paid only a notch above nudity and
starvation. Sometimes the workers wfcnt on strike ( anachoresis ,
secession) — they left their tasks and took sanctuary on temple grounds,
whence they were coaxed by hunger or fair words. Occasionally wages were
raised, prices went up, and all was as before. Guilds were permitted,
but they were mostly of tradesmen and managers; the government used them
as agents for the collection of taxes and for the organiza- tion of
forced labor on dikes, canals, and other public works.</p>
<p>Internal trade was active but slow. Roads were poor, and land
transport moved on men, donkeys, or camels — which now replaced horses
as draft animals in Africa. Much traffic went by inland waterways. A
great canal, 1 50 feet wide, completed in Trajan’s reign, bound the
Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean through the Nile and the Red Sea,
from whose ports at Arsinoe, Myos Hormos, and Berenice ships left daily
for Africa or India. The banking system that financed production and
trade was under full governmental control. Each nome capital had a state
bank, which acted as a receiver of taxes and repository of public funds.
Loans were made to farmers, industry, and business by the gov- ernment,
by priests from temple treasuries, and by private lending associations.
4 Taxes were laid upon every product, process, sale, export, or import,
even upon graves and burials; and additional assessments were levied
from time to time, in kind from the poor, in liturgies from the rich.
From Augustus to Trajan the country — or its masters — prospered; after
that zenith it succumbed to the dis- couragement and exhaustion of
endless tribute and taxation and the lethargy of a regimented
economy.</p>
<p>Outside of Alexandria and Naucratis Egypt remained sullenly, silently
Egyptian; Romanization hardly touched it beyond the mouths of the Nile;
and even Alexandria, which had been the greatest of Greek cities, was
assum- ing in our second century the character, languages, and odor of
an Oriental metropolis. Of Egypt’s 8,500,000 population its capital had
now some 800,- 000 5 (in 1930, 573,000), second only to Rome; in
industry and commerce it was first. Everyone in Alexandria is busy, says
a letter questionably Hadrian’s; everyone has a trade; even the lame and
the blind find work to do. 0 Here, among a thousand other articles,
glass, paper, and linen were pro- duced on a large scale. Alexandria was
the clothing and fashion center of the age, setting the styles and
making the goods. Its great harbor had nine miles of wharves, from which
its merchant fleet wove a web of commerce over many seas. It was also a
tourist center, equipped with hotels, guides, and interpreters for
visitors coming to see the Pyramids and the majestic temples of Thebes.
The main avenue, sixty-seven feet wide, was lined for three miles with
colonnades, arcades, and alluring shops displaying the fanci- est
products of ancient crafts. At many intersections there were spacious
squares or circles named plateai , “broad” (ways)— whence the Italian
piazza</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>and our plaza and place. Imposing structures adorned the central
thorough- fares — a large theater, an Emporium or exchange, temples to
Poseidon, Caesar, and Saturn, a celebrated Serapcum or Temple of
Serapis, and a group of university buildings known over the world as the
Museum, or Home of the Muses. Of the five sections into which the city
was divided, one was almost wholly given to the palaces, gardens, and
administrative buildings of the Ptolemies, now used by the Roman
prefect. Here, in a pretty mausoleum, lay the city’s founder, Alexander
the Great, preserved in honey and encased in glass.</p>
<p>Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, Italians, Arabs, Phoenicians, Persians,
Ethiopi- ans, Syrians, Libyans, Cilicians, Scythians, Indians, Nubians —
nearly every Mediterranean people had its quota in Alexandria. They made
a volatile and inflammable mixture, quarrelsome and disorderly,
intellectually clever and irreverently witty, shameless in speech,
skeptical and superstitious, loose in morals and gay in mood,
fanatically fond of the theater, music, and public games. Dio Chrysostom
describes life there as “a continuous revel… of dancers, whistlers, and
murderers.” 8 The canals were alive with merry - makers in gondolas at
night on their five-mile sail to the amusement suburb at Canopus. There
were musical contests that rivaled the horse races in raising excitement
and claques.</p>
<p>If we may believe Philo,® forty per cent of the city’s population
was</p>
<p>Jewish. Most Alexandrian Jews were employed in industry and trade,
and lived in great poverty; 10 many were merchants, a few were
moneylenders, some were rich enough to win enviable places in the
government. Originally confined to one fifth of the city, they had now
overflowed to occupy two fifths. They were governed by their own laws
and ciders, and Rome con- firmed the privileges that the Ptolemies had
given them to ignore any ordi- nance that conflicted with their
religion. They gloried in their magnificent central synagogue, a
colonnaded basilica so vast that a system of signals had to be used to
secure proper response at proper times from worshipers too distant from
the sanctuary to hear the words of the priest. 11 According to Josephus
the moral life of the Alexandrian Jews was exemplary compared with the
sexual looseness of the “pagan” population. 13 They had an active
intellectual culture and contributed substantially to philosophy,
historiog- raphy, and science. Racial hostility agitated the city at
various times; we find in Josephus’ tract Against Apion (an anti
-Semitic leader) all the causes, arguments, and legends that disturb the
relations of Jew and gentile today. In a.d. 38 a mob of Greeks invaded
the synagogues and insisted on placing in each of them a statue of
Caligula as a god. The Roman prefect, Avillius Flaccus, annulled the
Alexandrian citizenship of the Jews and ordered those of them who lived
outside the original Jewish section to return to it within</p>
<p>THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>JOI</p>
<p>a few days. When these had elapsed the Greek populace burned down 400
Jewish homes, and killed or clubbed Jews, outside the ghetto; and
thirty- eight members of the Jewish gerousia or senate were arrested and
publicly scourged in a theater. Thousands of Jews lost their homes,
their businesses, or their savings. Flaccus’ successor submitted the
matter to the Emperor, and two separate delegations — five Greeks and
five Jews — went to Rome (a.d. 40) to plead their causes before
Caligula. He died before he could judge. Claudius restored the rights of
the Jews in Alexandria, confirmed them in their municipal citizenship,
and sternly bade both factions keep the peace.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>PHILO</li>
</ol>
<p>The leader of the Jewish delegation to Caligula was the philosopher
Philo, brother of the arabarch, or manager of the Jewish export trade in
Alexandria. Eusebius describes him as belonging to an ancient priestly
family. 13 We know hardly anything else of his life; but his pious and
gener- ous character stands out in the many works that he wrote to
expound Judaism to the Greek world. Brought up in a sacerdotal
atmosphere, in- tensely loyal to his people, and yet fascinated by Greek
philosophy, he made it the aim of his life to reconcile the Scriptures
and customs of the Jews with Greek ideas and above all with the
philosophy of “the most holy” Plato. He adopted for his purpose the
principle that all events, characters, doc- trines, and laws in the Old
Testament have an allegorical as well as a literal meaning and symbolize
certain moral or psychological truths; by this method he was able to
prove anything. He wrote indifferently in Hebrew, but so well in Greek
that his admirers said, “Plato writes like Philo.” 14</p>
<p>He was a theologian rather than a philosopher, a mystic whose intense
piety presaged Plotinus and the medieval mind. God, in Philo, is the
essential being of the world, incorporeal, eternal, indescribable;
reason can know his existence, but can ascribe no quality to him, since
every quality is a limita- tion. To conceive him as having human form is
a concession to the sensuous imagination of men. God is everywhere;
“what place can a man find where God is not?” 15 But he is not
everything: matter is also eternal and increat e; however, it has no
life, motion, or form until infused with the divine force. To create the
world by giving form to matter, and to establish relations with man, God
used a host of intermediary beings, called angels by the Jews, daimones
by the Greeks, and Ideas by Plato. These, says Philo, may popu- larly be
conceived as persons, though really they exist only in the Divine Mind,
as the thoughts and powers of God. 18 Together these powers con- stitute
what the Stoics called the Logos, or Divine Reason creating and</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>(chap. XXIV</p>
<p>guiding the world. Fluctuating between philosophy and theology,
between ideas and personifications, Philo sometimes thinks of the Logos
as a person; in a poetic moment he calls the Logos “th e first- begotten
of God,” 17 son of God by the virgin Wisdom , 18 and says that through
the Logos God has revealed himself to man. Since the soul is part of
God, it can through reason rise to a mystic vision not quite of God, but
of the Logos. Perhaps, if we could free ourselves from the taint of
matter and sense, and by ascetic exer- cises and long contemplation
become for a moment pure spirit, we might for an ecstatic moment see God
himself. 19</p>
<p>Philo’s Logos was one of the most influential ideas in the history
of</p>
<p>hought. Its antecedents in Heracleitus, Plato, and the Stoics are
obvious; presumably he knew the recent Jewish literature that had made a
distinct person of the Wisdom of God as creator of the world; and he
must have been impressed by those lines in Proverbs (vin, 22) where
Wisdom says, “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before
his works of old. I was set up from everlasting… or ever the earth was.”
Philo was a contemporary of Christ; he apparently never heard of him;
but he shared unknowingly in forming Christian theology. The rabbis
frowned upon his allegorical interpretations as likely to be used as an
excuse for neglecting literal obedience to the Law; they suspected the
Logos doctrine as a retreat from monotheism; and they saw in Philo’s
passion for Greek philosophy a threat of cultural assimilation, racial
dilution, and consequent disappearance, of the dispersed Jews. But the
Fathers of the Church admired the Jew’s con - templative devotion, made
abundant use of his allegorical principles to answer the critics of the
Hebrew Scriptures, and joined with Gnostics and Neo-Platonists in
accepting the mystical vision of God as the crown of human enterprise.
Philo had tried to mediate between Hellenism and Judaism. From the
Judaic point of view he had failed; from the historical point of view he
had succeeded; and the result was the first chapter of the Gospel of
John.</p>

<li>THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>In science Alexandria was the unchallenged head of the Hellenistic
world. Claudius Ptolemy must be ranked among the most influential
astronomers of antiquity, for despite Copernicus the world is still
Ptolemaic in its speech. Bom at Ptolemais on the Nile (whence his name),
he lived most of his life at Alexandria, where he made observations from
a. d. 1 27 to 15 1. The world remembers him chiefly for his rejection of
Aristarchus’ theory that the earth</p>
<p>THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>503</p>
<p>Arabs referred to the work with a Greek superlative as Al- megiste,
“The Greatest”; arjd the Middle Ages corrupted the phrase into Almagest,
by which the book is known to history. It ruled the skies till
Copernicus upset the world. And yet Ptolemy did not claim to do more
than systematize the work and observation of previous astronomers,
Hipparchus above all. He pictured the universe as spherical and as daily
revolving around a spherical, motionless earth. Strange as this view
seems to us (though there is no telling what some future Copernicus will
do to our present Ptolemies), the geo- centric hypothesis made it
possible to compute the position of the stars and planets more
accurately than the heliocentric conception could do in the state of
astronomic knowledge at the time. 20 Ptolemy suggested further a theory
of eccentrics to explain the orbits of the planets, and discovered the
evection, or orbital aberration, of the moon. He measured the moon’s dis
- tance from the earth by the parallax method still in use, and
calculated it as fifty- nine times the earth’s radius. This is
approximately our current reckon - ing; but Ptolemy followed Poseidonius
in underestimating the diameter of the earth.</p>
<p>Just as the Syntaxis gathered ancient astronomy into its final form,
so Ptolemy’s Geographical Outline summarized antiquity’s knowledge of
the earth’s surface. Here, too, his industrious tables of latitude and
longitude for the major cities of the globe were vitiated by accepting
Poseidonius’ modest estimate of the earth; but to this encouraging
mistake, as transmitted by Ptolemy, Columbus owed his belief in the
possibility of reaching the Indies in a practicable time by sailing
west. 21 Ptolemy was the first to use the terms parallels and meridians
in geography; and in his maps he successfully pro- jected a spherical
upon a flat surface. But he was a mathematician rather than an
astronomer or a geographer; his work consisted chiefly in mathematical
formulations. In the Syntaxis he drew up an excellent table of chords.
He divided the radius of the earth into sixty partes minutae primae
(“first small parts”), which became our “minutes,” and subdivided e ach
of these into sixty partes minutae secundae (“second small parts”), now
our “seconds.” Though he made many mistakes, Ptolemy had the temper and
patience of a true scientist. He tried to rest all conclusions upon
observation — too seldom his own. In one field he carried out a long
series of experiments: his Optica, a study of refraction, has been
acclaimed as “the most remarkable experi - mental research of
antiquity.” 22 It is significant that this greatest astronomer,</p>
<p>Meanwhile a minor Archimedes was giving the classic world a second
chance to stage an industrial revolution. A brilliant inventor or
compiler, of</p>
<p>504 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>whom we know only the one name, Hero, issued in this age* at
Alexandria a long succession of treatises on mathematics and physics, of
which several have been preserved through Arabic translations. He warned
his readers frankly that the theorems and inventions which he presented
were not neces- sarily his own, but were the accumulations of centuries.
In the Dioptra he described an instrument like the theodolite, and
formulated principles for measuring, by surveying, the distances to
inaccessible points. In the Me- chanica he considered the uses and
combinations of simple devices like the wheel, axle, lever, pulley,
wedge, and screw. In the Pneumatica he studied air pressure in
seventy-eight experiments, most of them playful tricks; e.g., he showed
how either wine or water could be made to flow from the same small
orifice in the bottom of a jug by closing one or the other of the air
holes at the top of the divided container.</p>
<p>From these amusements he was led on to make a force pump, a
fire-engine pump with piston and valves, a hydraulic clock, a water
organ, and a steam engine. In this contraption the steam from heated
water was passed into a globe by a tube, and escaped through curved
outlets at opposite sides, causing the globe to revolve in a direction
contrary to that of the expelled steam. Hero’s keen sense of humor kept
him from developing this invention to industrial uses. He employed steam
to support a ball in mid-air, to make a mechanical bird sing, to cause a
statue to blow a horn. So in the Catoptrica he studied the reflection of
light and showed how to construct mirrors that would enable a person to
see his back, or appear with head downward, or with three eyes, two
noses, etc. He told magicians how to perform tricks by concealed
apparatus. He made water pour from a font when a coin was inserted in
the slot. He constructed a hidden machine by which heated water
overflowed into a bucket, whose increasing weight, by pulleys, opened
temple doors. In these and a hundred other ways Hero succeeded in being
a thaumaturgist, and failed to become a Watt.</p>
<p>Alexandria had long since been the chief center of medical education.
There were famous schools of medicine at Marseilles, Lyons, Saragossa,
Athens, Antioch, Cos, Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamum; but medical stu-
dents came to the Egyptian capital from every province. Even as late as
the fourth century, when Egypt was in decline, Ammianus Marcellinus
wrote that “it is enough to commend a physician’s skill if he can say
that he was trained at Alexandria.” 24 Specialization was progressing;
“no one can be a universal physician,” said Philostratus (ca. a.d. 225)
; “there must be special - ists for wounds, fevers, eyes, consumption.”
25 Dissection of cadavers was practiced at Alexandria, and there seem to
have been cases of human vivi- * His date is disputed. Pauly-Wissowa

<p>section. 20 Surgery was probably as well developed there in the first
century a. d. as anywhere in Europe before the nineteenth century. Women
physi- cians were not rare; one of them, Metrodora, wrote an extant
treatise on diseases of the womb. 27 Great names adorned the medical
history of this age: Rufus of Ephesus, who described the anatomy of the
eye, distinguished between motor and sensory nerves, and improved
methods for stopping the flow of blood in surgery; Marinus of
Alexandria, famous for his operations on the skull; and Antyllus, the
greatest ophthalmologist of the time. Dios- corides of Cilicia ( a.
d. 40-90) wrote a Materia Medica which scientifically described 600
medical plants so well that his book remained the chief author- ity on
its subject until the Renaissance. He recommended medicated pes- saries
for contraception ; 28 and his recipe for wine of mandragora to produce
surgical anesthesia was successfully applied in 1874. 20</p>
<p>Soranus of Ephesus, about a. d. i 16, published a treatise on the
diseases of women and the birth and care of children; it ranks only
below the Hippo- cratic collection and the works of Galen among the
extant products of an- cient medicine. He describes a vaginal speculum
and an obstetric chair, gives an excellent anatomy of the uterus, offers
almost modem dietetic and opera- tive advice, such as bathing the eyes
of the newborn child with oil , 30 sug- gests half a hundred
contraceptive devices, mostly by vaginal medication , 31 and (unlike
Hippocrates) allows abortion where delivery would endanger the mother’s
life. 32 Soranus was the greatest gynecologist of antiquity; no advance
was made on his work till Pare, fifteen centuries after him. If all his
forty treatises were extant we should probably rank him with Galen.</p>
<p>The most famous physician of the period was the son of a Pergamese
architect, who named him Galenus, i.e., quiet and peaceable, in the hope
that he would not take after his mother. 33 At fourteen the youth found
his first love in philosophy, from whose dangerous lure he was never
freed. At seventeen he turned to medicine, studied in Cilicia,
Phoenicia, Palestine, Cyprus, Crete, Greece, and Alexandria (a mobility
typical of ancient schol- ars), served as a surgeon in the gladiatorial
school at Pergamum, and prac- ticed for a time in Rome (a.d. 164-68).
There his successful cures brought him many rich patients, and his
lectures drew distinguished audiences. His repute rose to such a point
that people wrote to him from every province for medical advice; and he
confidently prescribed by mail. His good father, for- getting the
purpose of his name, had counseled him to join no sect or party and
always to tell the truth. Galen obeyed, exposed the ignorance and
venality of many physicians in Rome, and in a few years had to flee from
his enemies. Marcus Aurelius called him back to care for young Commodus
(169) and tried to take him on a Marcomannic campaign; but Galen was</p>
<p>50 6 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>clever enough to be soon back in Rome. Thereafter we know nothing of
him except his works.</p>
<p>He was almost as voluminous as Aristotle. Of 500 volumes ascribed to
him some 1 18 have survived, covering in 20,000 pages all branches of
medi- cine and several fields of philosophy. They are of little medical
value today, but they abound in incidental information and in the
vitality of a vigorous and controversial spirit. His fondness for
philosophy had given him a bad habit of drawing large deductions from
small inductions; his faith in his own knowledge and powers often
betrayed him into a dogmatism impossible to a scientific mind; and his
great authority prolonged for centuries the life of serious errors.
Nevertheless, he was an accurate observer and the most experime ntal of
ancient physicians. “I confess the disease from which I have suffered
all my life — to trust… no statements until, so far as possible, I have
tested them for myself.” 34 Forbidden by the Roman government to dissect
the human body alive or dead, he dissected and vivisected animals, and
sometimes too readily concluded to human anatomy from a study of apes,
dogs, cows, and pigs.</p>
<p>Despite his limitations Galen made more contributions to anatomy than
any other observer in antiquity. He described accurately the bones of
the cranium and the spinal column, the muscular system, the lacteal
vessels, the ducts of the lingual and submaxillary glands, and the
valves of the heart. He showed that an excised heart can continue to
beat outside the body; he proved that the arteries contain blood, not
air (as the Alexandrian school had taught for 400 years). He missed
anticipating Harvey; he thought that most of the blood traveled forth as
well as back in the veins, while the re- mainder, mixed with air from
the lungs, moved to and fro in the arteries. He was the first to explain
the mechanism of respiration, and brilliantly con- jectured that the
principal element in the air we breathe is also that which is active in
combustion. 35 He differentiated pleurisy and pneumonia, described
aneurism, cancer, and tuberculosis, and recognized the infectious nature
of the last. Above all, he founded experimental neurology. He made the
first experimental sections of the spinal cord, determined the sensory
and motor functions of each segment, understood the sympathetic system,
recognized seven of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves, and caused
aphasia at will by cutting the laryngeal nerve. He showed that injuries
to one side of the brain produce derangements in the opposite side of
the body. He cured the sophist Pausanias of numbness in the fourth and
fifth fingers of the left hand by stimulating the brachial plexus in
which the ulnar nerve arises that controls those fingers. 36 He was so
skilled in symptomatology that he preferred to diagnose without
questioning the patient. 37 He made much use of diet, exercise, and
massage, but he was also an expert on drugs and traveled widely</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 507</p>
<p>o secure rare medicines. He condemned the prescription of offal and
urine, still popular with some of his contemporaries , 88 recommended
dried cicadas for colic, applied goat dung to a tumor, and gave a long
list of illnesses that could be cured by theriac — a famous drug made as
an antidote for Mith- ridates the Great, daily imbibed by Marcus
Aurelius, and containing the flesh of snakes. 89</p>
<p>He tarnished his record as an experimentalist by a torrent of
precipitate theory. He ridiculed magic and spells, accepted divination
by dreams, and thought that the phases of the moon affected the
condition of patients. He took up Hippocrates’ notion of the four humors
(blood and phlegm, black and yellow bile),* added a dash of Pythagoras’
doctrine of four elements (earth, air, fire, and water), and tried to
reduce all diseases to derangement of these humors or these elements. He
was a firm vitalist, convinced that a pneuma, a vital breath or spirit,
pervaded and activated every part of the body. Mechanistic
interpretations of biology had been advanced by several physicians, as
for example by Asclepiades, who held that physiology should be treated
as a branch of physics; Galen objected that whereas a machine is merely
the sum of its parts, an organism implies the purposive control of the
parts by the whole. And just as purpose alone can explain the origin,
structure, and function of organs, so the universe, Galen thought, can
be understood only as the expression and instrument of some divine plan.
God, however, operates solely through natural laws; there are no
miracles, and the best revelation is Nature herself.</p>
<p>Galen’s teleology and monotheism won him favor with Christians, as
later with Moslems. Nearly all his writings were lost to Europe in the
chaos of the barbarian invasions, but in the East they were preserved by
Arab scholars, and were translated from Arabic into Latin from the
eleventh cen- tury onward. Galen became then an uncriticizcd authority,
an Aristotle for medieval medicine.</p>
<p>The last creative age of Greek science ended with Ptolemy and Galen.
Experiment ceased, dogma ruled; mathematics relapsed into restatements
of geometry, biology into Aristotle, natural science into Pliny; and
medicine marked time until the Arab and Jewish physicians of the Middle
Ages re- newed the noblest of the sciences.</p>

been able</p>
<p>Cf. the emphasis of current medicine on glandular secretions.</p>
<p>508 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>o conquer the mysterious peninsula. Arabia Deserta knew only Arab
nomads, but in the southwest a mountain range and its streams gave
milder temperatures and fruitful vegetation to Arabia Felix, the Yemen
of today. In those recesses the little kingdom of Saba hid, the Sheba of
the Bible, so rich in frankincense and myrrh, cassia and cinnamon, aloes
and nard, senna and gum and precious stones that the Sabateans could
build at Mariaba and elsewhere cities proud with temples, palaces, and
colonnades. 40 Arab merchants not only sold Arab products at high
prices, but carried on a caravan trade with northwestern Asia and an
active commerce by sea with Egypt, Parthia, and India. In 25 b.c.
Augustus sent Aelius Gallus to absorb the kingdom into the Empire; the
legions failed to take Mariaba and returned to Egypt decimated by
disease and heat. Augustus contented himself with destroying the Arab
port at Adana (Aden) and thereby secured control of the trade between
Egypt and India.</p>
<p>The main commercial route running north from Mariaba went through the
northwest comer of the peninsula, known to the ancients as Arabia
Petraea from its capital at Petra, some forty miles south of Jerusalem.
The city had been named from the circle of steep crags within which it
was strategically placed. There, in the second century b.c., the
Nabatean Arabs established a kingdom that slowly grew rich on passing
caravans, until its rule extended from Leuce Come on the Red Sea along
the eastern border of Palestine through Gerasa and Bostra to Damascus.
Under King Aretas IV (9 b.c.-a.d. 40) the country reached its zenith;
Petra became a Hellenistic city, Aramaic in speech, Greek in art,
Alexandrian in the splendor of its streets. To this time belong the
finest of the giant tombs that were carved into the rocks outside the
city — crude but powerful fagades of double-tiered Greek colonnades,
sometimes a hundred feet in height. After Trajan annexed Arabia Petraea
into the Empire ( 106), Bostra became the capital of the province of
Arabia, and raised in its turn the architectural symbols of wealth and
power. Petra decayed as Bostra and Palmyra became the crossroads of the
desert caravans, and the great t ombs lapsed into “the nightstalls of
nomad flocks.” 41</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the great Empire was its numerous and
populous cities. Never again till our own century has urbanization been
so pronounced. Lucullus, Pompey, Caesar, Herod, Hellenistic kings and
Roman emperors prided themselves on founding new cities and embellishing
old ones. So, moving north- ward along the eastern Mediterranean coast,
one could hardly go twenty miles without encountering a city-Raphia
(Rafa), Gaza, Ascalon, Joppa (Jaffa) Apollonia, Samaria-Sebaste, and
Caesarea (Kaisaria). These cities, though in Palestine, were half Greek
in population and predominantly Greek in language, culture, and
institutions; they were Hellenistic bridgeheads in the pagan invasion of
Judea. Herod spent large sums making Caesarea worthy of Augustus, for
whom it was named; he provided it with a fine harbor, a lofty temple, a
theater, an amphitheater, “sumptuous palaces, and many edifices of white
stone.” 42 ’ Farther inland were other Greek Palestinian cities-Livias,
Philadelphia, Gerasa</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL S°9</p>
<p>(Djcrasch), and Gadara (Katra). At Gerasa stand a hundred columns of
the colonnade that lined the main street; and the ruins of temples,
theater, baths, and aqueduct proclaim the affluence of the town in the
second century a.d.</p>
<p>Gadara, where the remains of two theaters echo with memories of Greek
plays, was famous for its schools, professors, and authors. Here, in the
third century b.c., had lived Menippus, the Cynic philosopher and
humorist whose satires taught that everything is vain except an upright
life, and gave a model to Lucilius, Varro, and Horace. Here in his
“Syrian Athens,” some hundred years before Christ, Meleager, the
Anacreon of the age, polished epigrams to fair ladies and handsome boys
and wore out his pen with love.</p>
<p>Brightly the goblet smiles since rested here</p>
<p>Zenophila’s sweet mouth, to Love so dear.</p>
<p>How blest would she to mine her rose-lips place,</p>
<p>And drink my soul out in a long embrace. 43</p>
<p>One of these flames, too soon snuffed out, burned with especial
brightness in his memory — Heliodora, whom he loved in Tyre.</p>
<p>I’ll twine white violets, and the myrtle green;</p>
<p>Narcissus will I twine, and lilies sheen;</p>
<p>I’ll twine swee t crocus, and the hyacinth blue;</p>
<p>And last I’ll twine the rose, love’s token true:</p>
<p>That all may form a wreath of beauty, meet</p>
<p>To deck my Heliodora’s tresses sweet. 44</p>
<p>Now “Hades has snatched her, and the dust has tarnished her flower in
bloom. O Mo ther Earth, I pray thee, clasp her gently to thy breast.”
45</p>
<p>Meleager immortalized himself by gathering into a “garland” (
Stephanos ) the elegiac verse of Greece from Sappho to Meleager; out of
this and like collections grew, by merger, the Greek Anthology * Here is
the Greek epigram at its best and worst, polished like a jewel or empty
as a pose; it was unwise to pluck these 4000 “flowers” from their
branches to make this fading wreath. Some of the verses commemorate
forgotten great men, or famous statues, or dead relatives; some, so to
speak, are autotaphs, as when a woman who died of triplets says pithily,
“After this let women pray for children.” 46 Some are barbs aimed at
physicians, shrews, undertakers, pedagogues, cuckolds; or the miser who,
fainting, is revived by the smell of a penny; or the grammarian whose
grandchild displayed successively all three gen- ders; 47 or the
pugilist who retires, marries, and gets more blows than he ever</p>
<p>• Meleager’s Stephanos was combined in our sixth c entury with the
Musa Paid ike, a homo- sexual anthology compiled by Strabo of Sardis (50
b.c.). Subsequent additions were made, chiefly of Christian verse; and
the Anthology was given its present form at Constantinople about a.d.

<p>received in the ring; or the dwarf who, carried off by a mosquito,
thinks he is suffering the rape of Ganymede. A single epigram celebrates
“that famous woman who slept with only one man.” Others dedicate
offerings to the gods: Lais hangs up her mirror as useless now that it
does not show her as she was; Nicias, after fifty years of serving men,
surrenders her complaisant girdle to Venus. Some stanzas glorify the
arterial dilation of wine as wiser than wisdom. One honors the unceasing
monogamy of the adulterer who was buried by a wreck in the arms of his
mistress. Some are pagan dirges on the brevity of life; some are
Christian assurances of a happy resurrection. Most of them, of course,
toast the beauty of women and boys and sing the painful ecstasy of love:
everything that later literature has said about amorous itching is here
said in brief and in full, with more than Elizabethan conceits. Meleager
makes a mosquito his pander by charging it with a message to his lady of
the hour. And his townsman Philodemus, philosophic mentor of Cicero,
tunes a melancholy note to his Xantho:</p>
<p>White waxen cheeks, soft scented breast.</p>
<p>Deep eyes wherein the Muses nest.</p>
<p>Sweet lips that perfect pleasure bring —</p>
<p>Sing me your song, pale Xantho, sing….</p>
<p>Too soon the music ends. Again,</p>

<p>With perfumed fingers touch the string;</p>
<p>O Love’s delight, pale Xantho, sing. 48</p>
<p>V. THE SYRIANS</p>
<p>Northward along the coast lay the ancient cities of Phoenicia, part,
with Palestine, of the province of Syria. Their industrious workers
skilled in handicrafts, their favored position as traditional ports of
trade, their rich and subtle merchants sending ships and agents
everywhere, had kept them alive through all the vicissitudes of a
thousand years. Tyre (Sur) had taller dwellings than Rome’s 40 and worse
slums; it stank with the smell of its dye - ing establishments, but it
consoled itself with the thought that the whole world bought its richly
colored textiles, above all its purple silks. Sidon had probably
discovered the art of blowing glass and now specialized in glass and
bronze. Berytus (Beirut) was distinguished for its schools of medicine,
rhetoric, and law; very likely from this university the great jurists
Ulpian and Papinian went to Rome.</p>
<p>No province of the Empire surpassed Syria in industry and prosperity.
Where now 3,000,000 inhabitants find a precarious existence, 10,000,000
lived in Trajan’s</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 5 II</p>
<p>ime. 50 Half a hundred cities here enjoyed the pure water, the public
baths, the underground drainage system, the clean markets, the gymnasia
and palaestras, the lectures and music, the schools and temples and
basilicas, the porticoes and arches, the public statuary and picture
galleries, characteristic of the Hellenistic cities in the first century
after Christ. 51 The oldest of them was Damascus, over the Lebanons from
Sidon, fortified by the surrounding desert, and turned almost into a
garden by the spreading arms and tributaries of a stream gratefully
called “the river of gold.” Many caravan routes converged here, and
poured into the</p>
<p>Returning over the Anti-Lebanon hills and moving north over dusty
roads, the modem traveler is astonished to find, in the tiny village of
Baalbek, the ruins of two majestic temples and a propylaeum, once the
pride of Heliopolis, the Greco-Roman-Syrian City of the Sun. Augustus
planted a small colony there, and the town grew as the sacred seat of
Baal the Sun-God and as the meeting point of roads to Damascus, Sidon,
and Beirut. Under Antoninus Pius and his successors Roman, Greek, and
Syrian architects and engineers raised, on the site of an old Phoenician
temple to Baal, an imposing shrine to Iuppiter Heliopoli- tanus. It was
built of huge monoliths from a quarry a mile away; one block measures
sixty-two by fourteen by eleven feet, and contains enough stone for a
commodious house. Fifty-one marble steps 150 feet wide lead up to the
propylaeum, a Corinthian portico. Beyond a colonnaded forecourt and
court rose the main temple, of which fifty-eight columns still tower
sixty-two feet into the air. Near it are the remains of a smaller
temple, variously attributed to Venus, Bacchus, and Demeter; nineteen of
its columns survive, and a handsome portal delicately carved.
Resplendent in their solitary grandeur under the unclouded sun, the
columns of these temples are among the fairest extant works of man.
Seeing them we feel, better than in Italy, the grandeur that was Rome,
the wealth and courage, skill and taste that could build, in so many
scattered cities, temples greater and more majestic than the crowded
capital ever knew.</p>
<p>A similar sight meets the traveler who strikes eastward across the
desert from Homs, the ancient Emesa, to Tadmor, which the Greeks
translated into Palmyra, City of a Myriad Palms. Its fortunate position
and fertile soil around two gushing springs on the roads from Emesa and
Damascus to the Euphrates made it grow in affluence until it was one of
the major cities of the East; and its distance from other settlements
enabled it to maintain practical independence despite nominal allegiance
to Seleucid kings or Roman emperors. Its wide central thoroughfare was
flanked by shady porticoes containing 454 columns; and at the four main
crossings were stately arches, of which one remains to let us judge the
rest. The glory of the city was the Temple of the Sun, dedicated (a.d.
30) to the supreme trinity of Bel (Baal), Yarhibol (the sun), and
Aglibol (the moon). Its size continued Assyrian traditions of immensity.
Its court, the largest in the Empire, had an unrivaled colonnade 4000
feet long, much of it composed of Corinthian columns running four
abreast. Within the court and the temple were</p>
<p>512 CAESAR AND CHRIST ( CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>paintings and sculptures whose extant examples reveal the approach of
Palmyra to Parthia in art as in geography.</p>
<p>A main route eastward from Palmyra reached the Euphrates at
Dura-Europus. There (a.d. ioo) the merchants shared their gains with the
Palmyrene trinity by rearing a temple half Greek and half Indian; and an
eastern painter adorned the walls with frescoes that vividly illustrate
the Oriental origin of Byzantine and early Christian art. 52 Farther
north on the great river were other important crossing towns at
Thapsacus and Zeugma. Turning westward from Thapsacus the traveler
passed through Beroea (Aleppo) and Apamea to the Mediterranean at
Laodicea — still keeping its ancient name as Latakia, and still an
active port. Between it and Apamea the river Orontes flowed north,
between shores largely pre-empted by rich estates, to Antioch (Antakia),
capital of Syria. The river, and a great network of roads, brought the
goods of the East to Antioch, while its Mediterranean port, Seleucia
Pieria, fourteen miles down the stream, brought in the products of the
West. Most of the city rose on a mountain slope and had the Orontes at
its feet; it was a picturesque location, that helped Antioch rival
Rhodes as the most beautiful city of the Hellenic East. It had a system
of street lighting that made it safe and brilliant at night. The main
avenue, four and a half miles long, was paved with granite and had a
covered colonnade on either side, so that people could walk from one end
of the town to the other immune to rain and sun. Pure water was supplied
in abundance to every home. The complex population of 600,000 Greeks,
Syrians, and Jews was notoriously gay, pursuing pleasure relentlessly,
laughing at the pompous Romans who came to govern them, oscillating
between the circus and the amphitheater, the brothels and the baths, and
taking full advantage of Daphne, their famous suburban park. Festivals
were numerous, and Aphrodite had a share in all of them. During the
feast of Brumalia, lasting through most of December, the whole city,
says a contemporary, resembled a tavern, and the streets rang all night
with song and revelry. 53 There were schools of rhetoric, philosophy,
and medicine, but Antioch was not a center of learning. Its populace
lived intensely for the day; and when it needed religion it flocked to
astrologers, magicians, miracle-workers, and charlatans.</p>
<p>The general picture of Syria under Roman rule is one of prosperity
more continuous than in any other province. Most of the workers were
freemen, except in domestic service. The upper classes were Hellenized,
the lower re- mained Oriental; in the same town Greek philosophers
rubbed elbows with temple prostitutes and emasculated priests; and even
till Hadrian children were now and then offered as sacrifices to the
gods. 54 Sculpture and painting took on a semi-Oriental, half-medieval
face and form. The Greek language prevailed in government and
literature, but native tongues — chiefly Aramaic — remained the speech
of the people. Scholars were plenty and made the world ring with their
moment’s fame. Nicolaus of Damascus, besides mentoring Antony,
Cleopatra, and Herod, undertook the weary task of writing a universal
history — a labor, he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI v) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 5*3</p>
<p>ells us, that Hercules himself would have shunned. 55 Time in its
tenderness has buried all his works, as at its leisure it will cover
ours.</p>

<li>ASIA MINOR</li>
</ol>
<p>North of Syria was the client kingdom-later the province — of
Commagene, with a populous capital at Samosata, Lucian’s childhood home.
Across the Euphrates stood the little realm of Osrhoene; Rome fortified
its capital, Edessa (Urfa), as a base against Parthia; we shall hear
more of it in Christian days. Westward from Syria one passed into
Cilicia (as now into Turkey) at Alex- andria Issi (Alexandretta). This,
Cicero’s province, was highly civilized along the southern Asia Minor
coast, but still barbarous in the Taurus hills. Tarsus (Tersous), the
capital, was “no mean city,” said its son Saint Paul, but was re -
nowned for its schools and philosophers.</p>
<p>Over against Cilicia, in the Mediterranean, the island of Cyprus
pursued its immemorial life of mining copper, cutting cypress, building
ships, and bearing patiently a succession of conquerors. The lucrative
mines were owned by Rome and worked by slaves. Galen describes how in
his time a mine there collapsed and crushed hundreds of workers — a
periodical incident in the geological basis of human comforts and
powers.</p>
<p>North of Cilicia lay arid and mountainous Cappadocia, mining precious
metals, and raising wheat, cattle, and slaves for export. West of it,
Lycaonia would enter into history with the visits of Saint Paul to
Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium. Again north was Galatia, settled and named
by the Gauls in the third century b.c.; its most famous product was the
Black Stone of Pessinus, sent to Rome as a symbol of Cybele; its chief
city was Ancyra, capital of the Plittites 3500 years ago, and of Turkey
today. West of Cilicia, the province of Pisidia counted fine cities
within its borders, like Xanthus, now recovering from its mass suicide
before Brutus, and Aspendus, whose theater is so well preserved that one
easily imagines it filling again to hear Menander or Euripides.</p>
<p>West and north of Pisidia was the province of “Asia,” divided into
Phrygia, Caria, Lydia, and Mysia. Here, where the civilization of Ionia
still flourished after a thousand years, Philostratus counted 500 towns,
with a total population far greater than the region supports today. The
countryside was fertile, the crafts had grown in skill from age to age,
and the ports profited from the development of rich markets in Italy,
Africa, Spain, and Gaul. Phrygia was mountainous, but it boasted large
cities like Apamea Celaenae — ranked by Strabo as second only to Ephesus
in “Asia”— and Laodicea, fortunate in its philanthropic philosophers and
millionaires. Cnidus was yet important enough to make an alliance with
Rome; but Halicarnassus had declined from Herodotus to Dionysius — an
excellent literary critic, an uncritical historian. Miletus was no
longer in its prime, though still an active port; the oracle of Apollo
in the temple at near-by</p>
<p>514 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Didyma continued to answer questions with puzzles; and the
storytellers of the region were weaving those amorous picaresque
“Milesian tales” that would soon develop into the Greek novel. Priene
was a minor town, but its citizens vied honorably in making it fair with
fine buildings. Here, in the first century b.c., a woman, Phile, was
elected to the highest municipal office; the influence of wealth and
Rome was raising the status of woman in Hellenic lands. Magnesia on the
Maeander had what many rated as the most nearly perfect temple in Asia —
dedicated to Artemis ( 1 29 b.c.), and designed by Hermogenes, the
supreme architect of the age. At Mycale the koinon , or Commons, still
met annually as a general council and religious union for Ionia.</p>
<p>Of the islands lying off the Carian coast Cos prospered with its silk
industry and its medical school, rich with traditions of Hippocrates,
and Rhodes (i.e., the Rose) was even in her decline the most beautiful
city of the Greek world. When, after the Civil War, Augustus sought to
relieve the distress of the eastern cities by allowing the cancellation
of all debts, Rhodes refused to avail herself of the expedient and met
all her obligations faithfully. As a result she rapidly regained her
place as banker to the Aegean trade and became again a halfway port for
vessels plying between Asia and Egypt. The city was celebrated for its
fallen Colossus, its handsome buildings, its famous statuary, its clean
and orderly streets, its competent aristocratic government, its
celebrated schools of rhetoric and philosophy. Here Apollonius Molo
taught Caesar and Cicero those arts of style which through them
influenced all later Latin prose.</p>
<p>The most famous Rhodian of this period was Poseidonius, the last
great synthetic mind of antiquity. Bom at Syrian Apamea (135 b.c.), he
first earned fame as a long-distance runner. After studying under
Panaetius in Athens he made Rhodes his home, served her as magistrate
and ambassador, traveled into many provinces, returned to Rhodes, and
drew such men as Pompey and Cicero to his lectures on the Stoic
philosophy. At 83 he went to live in Rome and died there a year later.
His lost Universal History — covering Rome and its possessions from 144
to 82 b.c. — was ranked by ancient scholars as equal to the work of
Polybius. His report of his travels in Gaul and his treatise On the
Ocean were basic sources for Strabo. His calculation of the sun’s
distance from the eart h- 52, 000, 000 miles — was closer than that of
any other ancient student to our modem reckoning. He went to Cadiz to
study the tides, and explained them by the joint action of the sun and
the moon. He underestimated the distance across the Atlantic and
predicted that one sailing from Spain would come to India after 8000
miles. Despite his wide acquaintance with natural science, he accepted
many of the spiritualistic ideas of his tim e — daimones, divination,
astrology, telepathy, and the power of the soul to rise to a mystic
union with God, whom he defined as the Life-Force of the world. Cicero
too generously ranked him as the greatest of the Stoics; we might also
consider him a forerunner of the Neo-Platonists, a bridge from Zeno to
Plotinus.</p>
<p>Following the coast of Asia northward from Caria, the traveler
entered Lydia</p>

<p>and its greatest city, Ephesus. It flourished under the Romans as
never before. Though Pergamum was the formal capital of “Asia,” Ephe sus
became the seat of the Roman proconsul and his staff; it was also the
main port of the province and the meeting place of the provincial
assembly. Its polyglot population of 225,000 ranged from philanthropic
sophists to a noisy and superstitious rabble. The streets were well
paved and lighted and had miles of shady porticoes. There were the usual
public buildings, some unearthed as late as 1894: a “museum” or
scientific center, a medical school, a library with a strangely baroque
fa9ade, and a theater that seated 56,000 persons; here Demetrius the
image-maker would arouse the populace against Saint Paul. The center
(and chief bank) of the city was the Temple of Artemis, surrounded by
128 columns each the gift of a king. The eunuch priests were attended by
virgin priestesses and a swarm of slaves; the rites were a mixture of
Oriental and Greek; the barbarous statue that rep- resented the goddess
had two rows of supernumerary breasts, symbolizing fer- tility. The
Festival of Artemis made all May a month of rejoicing, feasting, and
games.</p>
<p>Smyrna, despite its fishermen, had a better atmosphere. Apollonius of
Tyana, who traveled far and wide, called it “the most beautiful city
under the sun.” 59 It was proud of its long, straight streets, its
double-tiered colonnades, its library, and its university. One of its
most famous sons, Aelius Aristides (a.d. i 17-187), described it in
terms that reveal the splendor of these Roman-Hellenistic cities. Go
from east to west, and you will pass from temple to temple</p>
<p>and from hill to hill along a street fairer than its name (the
Golden</p>
<p>Way). Stand on the acropolis: the sea flows beneath you, the suburbs

exhibitions is beyond telling, and the variety of her handicrafts.</p>

<p>Aelius was one of many rhetors and sophists whose fame drew students
to Smyrna from all Hellas. His teacher Polemo was so great (says
Philostratus) “that he talked with cities as his inferiors, with
emperors as not his superiors, and with the gods as his equals.” 01 When
he lectured in Athens Herodes Atticus, his greatest rival in opulent
eloquence, attended as an admiring pupil. In payment for the privilege
Herodes sent him 150,000 drachmas (0,000); when Polemo failed to thank
him a friend suggested that he felt underpaid; Herodes sent 100,000
more, which Polemo quietly accepted as his due. Polemo used his for-
tune to embellish his adopted city; he took part in its government,
harmonized its factions, and served it as ambassador. Tradition says
that finding his arthritis</p>

<p>Sardis, Croesus’ ancient capital, was still “a great city” in
Strabo’s time. Cicero was impressed by the splendor and refinement of
Mytilene, and in the third cen- tury Longus described it in terms
suggestive of Venice. 03 Pergamum shone with the great altar and costly
buildings raised by the Attalid kings out of a treasury fattened by the
labor of slaves in state forests, fields, mines, and factories. Attalus
III anticipated Roman expansion and social revolution by bequeathing his
realm to Rome in 133 b.c. Aristonicus, son of King Eumenes II by a
concubine, de- nounced the bequest as forced, called the slaves and the
free poor to revolt, defeated a Roman army (132), captured many cities,
and planned a socialist state with the help of Blossius, teacher of the
Gracchi. The neighboring kings of Bithynia and Pontus, and the business
classes of the occupied cities, joined Rome in suppressing the
rebellion, and Aristonicus died in a Roman dungeon. This uprising, and
the Mithridatic Wars, interrupted the cultural life of Pergamum for half
a century, and Antony despoiled its famous library to re- imburse
Alexandria for the volumes burned durin g Caesar’s stay. Pergamum must
have recovered by Vespasian’s time, for the elder Pliny judged it the
most brilliant city in Asia. It enjoyed a new flurry of building under
the Antonines, and developed in its Asclepicum a medical school from
which Galen went forth to cure the world.</p>
<p>Farther north Alexandria Troas was made a Roman colony by Augustus in
memory of Rome’s supposed Trojan origin— which gave Rome a convenient
claim to all these parts. On a near-by hill (Hissarlik) old Troy was
rebuilt as new Ilium, and became a goal for tourists to whom guides
pointed out the exact spot of every exploit in the Iliad, and the cave
where Paris had judged Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena. On the Propontis
Cyzicus built ships and sent out a ubiquitous merchant fleet rivaled
only by that of Rhodes. Here Hadrian built a Temple of Persephone which
was one of the glories of Asia. Its columns, says Dio Cassius, were six
feet in diameter and seventy-five feet high, yet each was a single block
of stone 04 Rising from a hill, it towered so high that Aelius counted

<p>Along the northern shores of Asia Minor sprawled Bithynia and Pontus,
mountainous in the interior, but rich in timber and minerals. Here a
mixture of Thracians, Greeks, and Iranians overlay an antique Hittite

<p>a Persian noble, piously called Mithridates, carved a kingdom for
himself out of Cappadocia and Pontus, and founded a dynasty of virile
Hellenizing monarchs, with capitals at Comana Pontica and Sinope. Their
rule spread until it impinged upon Roman economic and political
interests. The result- ing Mithridatic Wars are fitly named from the
redoubtable king who united western Asia and European Greece in a revolt
which, if it had succeeded, would have changed the face of history.</p>
<p>Mithridates VI had inherited the throne of Pontus as a boy of eleven.
His mother and his guardians, seeking to supplant him, tried to kill
him. He fled from the palace, disguised himself, and for seven years
lived in the woods as a hunter, dressed in skins. About 1 1 5 b.c. a
coup d’etat deposed his mother and restored him to power. Surrounded by
the conspiracies characteristic of Oriental courts, he took the
precaution of drinking a little poison every day, until he had developed
immunity to most of the varieties available to his intimates. In the
course of his experiments he discovered many antidotes. From these his
interest spread to medicine, on which he compiled data of such value
that Pompey had them translated into Latin. His wild and exact- ing life
had given him strength of body as well as of will; he grew to so large a
frame that he sent his suit of armor to Delphi to amuse the worshipers.
He was an expert horseman and warrior, could (we are assured) run fast
enough to overtake a deer, drove a sixteen-horse chariot, and rode 1 20
miles in a day. 05 He prided himself on being able to outeat and
outdrink any man, and he attended to a numerous harem. Roman historians
tell us that he was cruel and treacherous and slew his mother, his
brother, three sons, and three daughters ; 60 but Rome has not
transmitted his side of this tale. He was a man of some culture, could
speak twenty-two languages, and never used an interpreter ; 07 he
studied Greek literature, was fond of Greek music, en- riched Greek
temples, and had Greek scholars, poets, and philosophers at his court;
he collected works of art and issued coins of surpassing excellence. But
he shared in the sensuality and coarseness of his half -barbarian
environ- ment and accepted the superstitions of his time. He defended
himself against Rome not with the far-seeing maneuvers of a great
general or statesman, but with the impromptu courage of an animal at
bay.</p>
<p>Such a man could not be content with the reduced kingdom relinquished
by his mother. With the help of Greek officers and mercenaries he con-
quered Armenia and the Caucasus, passed over the Kuban River and the
Strait of Kerch into the Crimea, and brought under his sway all the
Greek cities on the east, north, and west coast of the Black Sea. As the
collapse of Greek military power had left these communities almost
defenseless against the barbarians of their hinterland, they received
the Greek phalanxes of</p>
<p>Jl8 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>Mithridates as saviors. The subject cities included Sinope (Sinob),
Trapezus (Trebizond), Panticapaeum (Kerch), and Byzantium; but Bithynian
con- trol of the Hellespont (Dardanelles) left the Mediterranean
commerce of Pontus at the mercy of hostile kings. When Nicomedes II of
Bithynia died (94 b.c.), his two sons contested the succession. One of
them sought’ the aid of Rome, the other, Socrates, appealed to the
Pontic king. Mithridates took advantage of the factional strife in Italy
to invade Bithynia and en- throne Socrates. Rome, unwilling to see the
Bosporus in hostile hands, ordered Mithridates and Socrates out of
Bithynia. Mithridates complied, Socrates refused. The Roman governor of
Asia deposed him and crowned Nicomedes III. The new ruler, encouraged by
the Roman proconsul Manius Aquilius, invaded Pontus, and the First
Mithridatic War began (88-84 b.c.).</p>
<p>Mithridates felt that his sole chance of survival lay in arousing
the</p>
<p>Hellenic East to revolt against its Italian overlords. He announced
himself as the liberator of Hellas and sent troops to free the Greek
cities of Asia, if necessary by force. Opposed by the business classes
of the towns, he courted the democratic parties with promises of
semisocialistic reforms. Meanwhile his navy of 400 ships destroyed the
Roman Black Sea fleet, and his army of 290,000 men overwhelmed the
forces of Nicomedes and Aquilius. To ex- press his scorn of Roman
avarice, 08 the victorious king poured molten gold down the throat of
the captured Aquilius — fresh from his triumph over the revolted slaves
of Sicily. The Greek cities of Asia Minor, shorn of Roman defense,
opened their gates to the armies of Mithridates and declared their
allegiance to his cause. At his suggestion, on an appointed day, they
slew all Italians — 80,000 men, women, and children — whom they found
within their walls (88 b.c.). Says Appian:</p>
<p>The Ephesians tore away the fugitives who had taken refuge in</p>
<p>he Temple of Artemis and were clasping the images of the goddess, and
slew them. The Pergamenes shot with arrows the Romans who</p>
<p>had sought sanctuary in the Temple of Aesculapius. The people of</p>
<p>Adramyttium followed into the sea those who sought to escape by</p>
<p>swimming, and killed them and drowned their children. The in-</p>
<p>habitants of Caunus (in Caria) pursued the Italians who had taken</p>
<p>refuge about the statue of Vesta, killed the children before
their</p>
<p>mothers’ eyes, then the mothers, then the men…. By which it was</p>
<p>made plain that it was as much hatred of the Romans as fear of Mith-
ridates that impelled these atrocities. 00</p>
<p>Doubtless the poorer classes, who had borne the brunt of Roman
domina- tion, took the lead in this mad massacre; the propertied
classes, long pro- tected by Rome, must have trembled at so wild an
uprising of revenge.</p>
<p>THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL</p>

<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>Mithridates sought to appease the well to do by exempting the Greek
cities from taxes for five years and giving them complete home rule. At
the same time, however, he “proclaimed the canceling of debts,” says
Appian, 70 “freed the slaves, confiscated many estates, and
redistributed the land.” Leading men in the communities formed a
conspiracy against him; he discovered it and had 1600 of them killed.
The lower classes, aided by philosophers and university professors, 71
seized power in many Greek cities, even in Athens and Sparta, and
declared war against both Rome and wealth. The Greeks of Delos, in an
ecstasy of freedom, slaughtered 20,000 Italians in one day. The fleet of
Mithridates captured the Cyclades, and his armies took posses- sion of
Euboea, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace. The defection of rich “Asia”
stopped the flow of tribute to the Roman treasury and of inter est to
Roman investors, and plunged Italy into a financial crisis that had
something to do with the revolutionary movement of Satuminus and Cinna.
Italy itself was divided, for the Samnites and Lucanians sent offers of
alliance to the Pontic king.</p>
<p>Faced with war and revolution everywhere, the Senate sold the accumu-
lated gold and silver of Rome’s temples to finance Sulla’s troops. We
must not tell again how Sulla captured Athens, defeated the rebel
armies, saved the Empire for Rome, and gave Mithridates a lenient peace.
The King withdrew to his Pontic capital and quietly organized another
army and fleet. Murena, the Roman legate in Asia, decided to attack him
before he grew stronger. When, in this Second Mithridatic War (83-81),
Murena was defeated, Sulla reprimanded him for violating the treaty and
ordered hostilities ended. Six years later Nicomedes III bequeathed
Bithynia to Rome. Mithridates realized that his own kingdom would soon
be swallowed up if the Roman power, already controlling the Bosporus,
should reach the borders of Paphlagonia and Pontus. In the Third
Mithridatic War (75-63) he made a last effort, fought for twelve years
against Lucullus and Pompey, was betrayed by his allies and aides, and
fled to the Crimea. There the old warrior, now in his sixty-ninth year,
tried to organize an army to cross the Balkans and invade Italy from the
north. His son Phamaces revolted against his authority, his army refused
the venture, and the deserted king tried to kill himself. The poison
that he took failed to work because he had inured his system to it, and
his hands were too weak to press home the blade from whose point he
invited death. His friends and proteges, commissioned by his son to kill
him, ended his life with their swords and spears.</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>PROSE</li>
</ol>
<p>It speaks well for Roman rule that the cities of Asia Minor recovered
so rapidly from the intermittent fever of these wars. Nicomedia became
the capital of the province of Bithynia-Pontus and later the imperial
seat of Diocletian; Nicaea would be immortalized by the most important
council in the history of the Christian Church. The two cities so
rivaled one another in building that Trajan had to send the younger
Pliny to draw them back from bankruptcy. Nicomedia made her offering to
literature in Flavius Arrianus, whom we have seen recording the
discourses of Epictetus. Governor of Cappadocia for six years, archon of
Athens for one, Arrian yet found time to write many histories, of which
only the Anabasis of Alex- ander remains, with an appendix of Indica. It
was written in clear and simple Greek, for Arrian took Xenophon as his
exemplar in style as well as life. “This work,” he says, with die bold
vanity of the ancients, “i s, and has been from my youth up, equivalent
to native land, and family, and public office for me; and therefore I do
not deem myself unworthy to rank among the greatest authors in the Greek
language.” 72</p>
<p>Other cities along the Black Sea had goodly buildings and famous
scholars. Myrlca had 320,000 inhabitants; 73 Amastris (Amasra) impressed
Pliny as “a neat and lovely city,” known for its fine box trees; Sinope
flourished as a fishing center and an outlet for the timber and minerals
of its countryside; Amisus (Samsun) and Trapezus made a living by
trading across the waters with Scythia (southern Russia); and Amasea
(Amasia) gave birth and a home to antiquity’s most celebrated
geographer.</p>
<p>Strabo came of a rich family, related, he assures us, to the Pontic
kings. He suffered from a peculiar squint still known by his name. 74 He
traveled extensively, apparently on diplomatic missions, and used every
opportunity to gather geographical or historical information. He wrote a
lost history con- tinuing Polybius; and in 7 b.c. he issued his great
Geography, of whose seventeen books time has preserved nearly all. Like
Arrian he begins by pro- claiming the virtues of his work:</p>
<p>I ask pardon of my readers, and appeal to them not to fasten the</p>
<p>blame for the length of my discussion upon me rather than upon those
who earnestly desire knowledge of things famous and ancient….</p>
<p>In this work I must leave untouched what is small, and devote my</p>
<p>attention to what is noble and great… useful or memorable or</p>
<p>entertaining. And just as, in judging the merits of colossal
statues,</p>
<p>we do not examine each individual part with minute care, but
rather</p>
<p>THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL</p>
<p>521</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV)</p>
<p>consider the general effect… so should this my book he judged.</p>
<p>For it, too, is a colossal work… worthy of a philosopher. 76</p>
<p>He borrows frankly from Polybius and Poseidonius, less frankly from
Eratosthenes, brings them all sharply to account for their errors, and
sug- gests that his own should be blamed on his sources. 70 But he
acknowledges his sources with rare candor and usually selects them with
discrimination. He notes that the extension of the Roman Empire has
widened geographical knowledge, but believes that there are whole
continents still unknown — possibly in the Atlantic. He believes that
the earth is spheroidal (but the word probably meant spherical), and
that if one were to sail westward from Spain he would in time come to
India. He describes coastlines as always changing through erosion or
eruption and conjectures that subterranean disturbances may someday
sever Suez and unite the seas. His work was a brave summary of the
global knowledge of his age and must be ranked as one of the major
achievements of ancient science.</p>
<p>Far more renowned than Strabo in his time was Dio Chrysostom — Dio of
the Golden Mouth (a.d. 40-120). His family had long been distinguished
in Prusa; his grandfather had exhausted a fortune in gifts to the
Bithynian city and then had made another; his father had gone through
the same experience; and Dio followed in their steps. 77 He became an
orator and a sophist, went to Rome, was converted to Stoicism by
Musonius Rufus, and was banished from Italy and Bithynia by Domitian
(82). Forbidden the use of his property or income, he wandered for
thirteen years from country to country as a penniless philosopher,
refusing money for his discourses, and earning his bread for the most
part by the work of his hands. When Domitian was succeeded by Nerva,
Dio’s exile w as changed into honors; Nerva and Trajan befriended him
and gave his city many favors at his request. He returned to Prusa and
devoted most of his wealth to beautifying it. Another philosopher
accused him of embezzling public funds; he was tried by Pliny and
appears to have been exonerated.</p>
<p>Dio left behind him eighty orations. For us today they contain more
wind than meat; they suffer from empty amplification, deceptive
analogies, and rhetorical tricks; they stretch half an idea to half a
hundred pages; no wonder a weary listener complained, “You are letting
the sun go down with your interminable questions.” 78 But the man had
charm and eloquence, else he could hardly have become the most
celebrated orator of the century, for whose speeches men w ould
interrupt a war. “I don’t know what you mean,” said the honest Trajan,
“but I love you as myself.” 79 The barbarians on the Borysthenes
(Dnieper) heard him as gladly as the Greeks gathered at Olym- pia, or
the excitable Alexandrians; an army about to revolt against Nerva
was</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>522</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>mollified into acceptance by the impromptu address of the half-naked
exile.</p>
<p>Probably what drew people to him was not his fine Attic Greek, but
the courage of his denunciations. Almost alone in pagan antiquity he
condemned prostitution; and few writers of his time so openly attacked
the institution of slavery. (He was a bit vexed, however, when he found
that his slaves had run away.) 80 His address to the Alexandrians was a
castigation of their lux- ury, superstition, and vice. He chose Ilium as
the scene of an oration in which he argued that Troy had never existed
and that “Homer was the boldest liar in history.” In the heart of Rome
he expounded the case of the countryside against the city, painted in
vivid narrative a touching picture of rural poverty, and warned his
audience that the land was being neglected and the agricultural basis of
civilization was in decay. At Olympia, amid a multi- tude of fanatical
worldlings, he reproved the atheists and epicureans of the day. Though
popular conceptions of deity may be absurd, said Dio, the wise man will
understand that the simple mind needs simple ideas and pictorial
symbols. In truth no man can conceive the form of the Supreme Being, and
even Pheidias’ noble statue was an anthropomorphic assumption as unwar -
rantable as the primitive identification of God with a star or a tree.
We can- not know what God is, but we have an innate conviction that he
exists, and we feel that philosophy without religion is a dark and
hopeless thing. The only real freedom is wisdom — i.e., the knowledge of
what is right and what is wrong; the road to freedom lies not through
politics or revolution, but through philosophy; and true philosophy
consists not in the speculations of books, but in the faithful practice
of honor and virtue according to the dic- tates of that inmost voice
which is, in some mystic sense, the word of God in the heart of man.

<li>THE ORIENTAL TIDE</li>
</ol>
<p>Religion, which had bided its time and nourished its roots through
all the learned or ribald skepticism of the Periclean and Hellenistic
periods, now in the second century resumed its immemorial sway as
philosophy, baffled by infinity and human hope, confessed its
limitations and abdicated its author- ity. The people themselves had
never lost their faith; most of them accepted in outline the Homeric
description of the afterlife , 82 sacrificed religiously before
undertaking a voyage, and still placed an obol in the mouth of the dead
to pay his passage across the Styx. Roman statecraft welcomed the aid of
established priesthoods and sought popular support by building costly
tem- ples to local gods. Throughout Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor,
the wealth of the clergy continued to grow. Hadad and Atargatis were
still worshiped by the Syrians and had an awesome shrine at Hierapolis;
the resurrection of</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIV) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 523</p>
<p>he god Tammuz was still hailed in the towns of Syria with the c ry,
“Adonis [i.e., the Lord] is risen,” and his ascension into heaven was
celebrated in the closing scenes of his festival. 88 Similar ceremonies
commemorated in Greek ritual the agony, death, and resurrection of
Dionysus. From Cappadocia the worship of the goddess Ma had spread into
Ionia and Italy; her priests (called fanatici as belonging to the fanum,
or temple) danced dizzily to the sound of trumpets and drums, slashed
themselves with knives, and sprinkled the goddess and her devotees with
their blood. 84 The making of new deities went on assiduously; Caesar
and the emperors, Antinoiis and many local worthies, were deified (i.e.,
canonized) in life or death. Cross-fertilized by trade and war,
pantheons were everywhere in flower, and prayers rose hope- fully in a
thousand tongues to a thousand gods. Paganism was not one re- ligion; it
was a jungle of rival creeds, often merging in eclectic confusion.</p>
<p>The worship of Cybele held its ground in Lydia and Phrygia, Italy and
Africa and elsewhere, and its priests, as before, emasculated themselves
in imitation of her beloved Attis. At her spring festival her worshipers
fasted, prayed, and mourned the death of Attis; her priests cut their
arms and drank their own blood; and a solemn procession bore the young
god to his grave. But on the morrow the streets rang with exultant
shouts as the people cele- brated the resurrection of Attis and the
renewal of the earth. “Take courage,</p>
<p>Even more widely honored than Cybele was the Egyptian goddess Isis,
the sorrowing mother, the loving comforter, the bearer of the gift of
eternal life. All the Mediterranean peoples knew how her great spouse
Osiris had died and had risen from the dead; in nearly every great city
on that historic sea this happy resurrection was commemorated with
gorgeous pageantry, and jubilant worshipers sang, “We have found Osiris
again.” 87 Isis was represented in pictures and statues as holding her
divine child Horus in her arms, and devout litanies hailed her as “Queen
of Heaven,” “Star of the Sea,” and “Mother of God.” 88 Of all pagan
cults this came nearest to Chris - tianity in the tenderness of its
story, the refinement of its ritual, the solemnity and yet joyful
atmosphere of its chapels, the moving music of its vespers, the
conscientious ministry of its white-robed and tonsured priests , 80 the
honors and opportunities with which it charmed and comforted women, the
universal welcome it gave to every nationality and every class. The
religion of Isis spread from Egypt to Greece in the fourth century b.c.,
to Sicily in the third, to Italy in the second, and then to all parts of
the Empire; her icons have been found on the Danube, the Rhine, and the
Seine, and a temple to</p>
<p>524 CAESAR AND CHRIST (CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>her has been unearthed in London. 00 The Mediterranean soul has never
ceased to worship the divine creativeness and maternal solicitude of
woman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the masculine cult of Mithras was passing from Persia to
the most distant Roman frontiers. In the later Zoroastrian theology
Mithras was the son of Ahura-Mazda, the God of Light. He, too, was the
god of light, of truth, purity, and honor; sometimes he was identified
with the sun and led the cosmic war against the powers of darkness,
always he mediated between his father and his followers, protecting and
encouraging them in life’s struggle with evil, lies, uncleanliness, and
the other works of Ahriman, Prince of Darkness. When Pompey’s soldiers
brought this religion from Cappadocia to Europe a Greek artist pictured
Mithras as kneeling on the back of a bull and plunging a poniard into
its neck; this representation be- came the universal symbol of the
faith. The seventh day of each week was held sacred to the sun-god; and
towards the end of December his followers celebrated the birthday of
Mithras “the Invincible Sun,” who, at the winter solstice, had won his
annual victory over the forces of darkness, and day by day would now
give longer light. 91 Tertullian speaks of a Mithraic priest- hood with
a “high pontiff,” and of celibates and virgins serving the god; daily
sacrifice was offered at his altar, worshipers partook of consecrated
bread and wine, and the climax of the ceremony was signaled by the
sound- ing of a bell. 02 A flame was kept ever burning before the crypt
in which the young god was represented felling the bull. Mithraism
preached a high morality and pledged its “soldiers” to a lifelong war
against evil in every</p>
<p>Each of the great cults of the Mediterranean region had “mysteries,”
which were usually ceremonies of purification, sacrifice, initiation,
revela- tion, and regeneration, centering about the death and
resurrection of the god. New members were admitted into the worship of
Cybele by being placed naked in a pit over which a bull was slain; the
blood of the sacrificed animal, falling upon the candidate, purified him
of sin and gave him a new</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIV ) THE HELLENISTIC REVIVAL 525</p>
<p>spiritual and eternal life. The genitals of the bull, representing
his sacred fer- tility, were placed in a consecrated vessel and were
dedicated to the god- dess. 04 Mithraism had a similar rite, known to
the classic world as the tauro- bolium , or throwing of the bull.
Apuleius described in ecstatic terms the degrees of initiation into the
service of Isis — the long novitiate of fasting, continence, and prayer,
the purifying submersion in holy water, and at last the mystic vision of
the goddess offering everlasting bliss. At Eleusis the candidate was
required to confess his sins (which discouraged Nero), ab- stain for a
time from certain foods, bathe in the bay for spiritual as well as
physical cleansing, and then offer sacrifice, usually of a pig. For
three days, at the Feast of Demeter, the initiates mourned with her the
snatching of her daughter into Hades, and meanwhile lived on consecrated
cakes and a mystic mixture of flour, water, and mint. On the third night
a religious drama represented the resurrection of Persephone, and the
officiating priest prom- ised a like rebirth to every purified soul. 95
Varying the theme under Hindu or Pythagorean influence, the Orphic sect
throughout Greek lands taught that the soul is imprisoned in a
succession of sinful bodies and can be released from this degrading
reincarnation by rising to ecstatic union with Dionysus. At their
gatherings the members of the Orphic brotherhood drank the blood of a
bull sacrificed to — and identified with — the dying and atoning savior.
Communal partaking of sacred food or drink was a frequent feature of
these Mediterranean faiths. Often the food was thought to take on, by
sanctifica- tion, the powers of the god, which were then magically
conveyed to the communicant. 00</p>
<p>All sects assumed the possibility of magic. The Magi had disseminated
their art through the East and had given a new name to old jugglery. The
Mediterranean world was rich in magicians, miracleworkers, oracles,
astrol- ogers, ascetic saints, and scientific interpreters of dreams.
Every unusual oc- currence was widely hailed as a divine portent of
future events. Askesis , which the Greeks had used to denote the
athletic training of the body, came now to mean the spiritual taming of
the flesh; men scourged themselves, mutilated themselves, starved
themselves, or bound themselves to one place with chains; some of them
died through self-torture or self-denial. 07 In the Egyptian desert near
Lake Mareotis a group of Jews and non-Jews, male and female, lived in
solitary cells, avoided sexual relations, met on the Sabbath for common
prayer, and called themselves Therapeutae, healers of the soul. 98
Millions believed that the writings ascribed to Orpheus, Hermes,
Pythagoras, the sibyls, etc., had been dictated or inspired by a god.
Preachers claiming divine inspiration traveled from city to city,
performing apparently miraculous cures. Alexander of Abonoteichus
trained a serpent to hide its head under his arm and allow a half-human
mask to be affixed to its tail; he</p>
<p>CAESAR AND CHRIST</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIV</p>
<p>announced that the serpent was the god Asclepius come to earth to
serve as an oracle; and he amassed a fortune by interpreting the sounds
made by reeds inserted in the false head.“</p>
<p>Beside such charlatans there were probably thousands of sincere
preachers of the pagan faiths. Early in the third century Philostratus
painted an ideal- ized picture of such a man in his Life of Apollonius
of Tyana. At sixteen Apollonius adopted the strict rule of the
Pythagorean brotherhood, renounc- ing marriage, meat, and wine, never
shaving his beard, and keeping silence for five years. 100 He
distributed his patrimony among his relatives and wandered as a
penniless monk through Persia, India, Egypt, western Asia, Greece, and
Italy. He imbibed the lore of the Magi, the Brahmans, and the Egyptian
ascetics. He visited temples of any creed, implored the priests to
abandon the sacrifice of animals, worshiped the sun, accepted the gods,
and taught that behind them there was one supreme unknowable deity. His
life of abne- gation and piety led his followers to claim that he was
the son of a god, but he described himself simply as the son of
Apollonius. Tradition credited him with many miracles: he walked through
closed doors, understood all languages, cast out demons, and raised a
girl from the dead. 101 But he was a philosopher rather than a magician.
He knew and loved Greek literature and expounded a simple but e xacting
morality. “Grant me,” he prayed the gods, “to have little and to desire
nothing.” Asked by a king to choose a gift, he answered, “Dried fruit
and bread.” 102 Preaching reincarnation, he bade his followers injure no
living creature and eat no flesh. He exhorted them to shun enmity,
slander, jealousy, and hatred; “if we are philosophers,” he told them,
“we cannot hate our fellow men.” 103 “Sometimes,” says Philostratus, “he
discussed communism and taught that men ought to support one an -
other.” 104 He was accused of sedition and witchcraft, came of his own
accord to Rome to answer these charges before Domitian, was imprisoned,
and escaped. He died about a.d. 98, at an advanced age. His followers
claimed that he had appeared to them after his death and had then
ascended bodily into heaven. 105</p>
<p>What were the qualities that won half of Rome, half the Empire, to
these new faiths? Partly their classless, raceless character; they
accepted all na- tionalities, all freemen, and all slaves, and rode with
consoling indifference over inequalities of pedigree and wealth. Their
temples were made spacious to welcome the people as well as to enshrine
the god. Cybele and Isis were mother-goddesses acquainted with grief,
who mourned like millions of bereaved women; they could understand what
the Roman deities seldom knew — the emptied hearts of the defeated. The
desire to return to the mother is stronger than the impulse to depend
upon the father; it is the mother name that comes spontaneously to the
lips in great joy or distress; therefore</p>

<p>5*7</p>
<p>men as well as women found comfort and refuge in Isis and Cybele.
Even today the Mediterranean worshiper appeals more often to Mary than
to the Father or the Son; and the lovely prayer that he most frequently
repeats is addressed not to the Virgin but to the Mother, blessed in the
fruit of her womb.</p>
<p>The new faiths not only entered more deeply into the heart; they
appealed more colorfully to the imagination and the senses with
processions and chants alternating between sorrow and rejoicing, and a
ritual of impressive symbolism that brought fresh courage to spirits
heavy with the prose of life. The new priesthoods were filled not by
politicians occasionally don- ning sacerdotal garb, but by men and women
of all ranks, graduating through an ascetic novitiate to continual
ministration. By their help the soul conscious of wrongdoing could be
purified; sometimes the body racked with illness could be healed by an
inspiring word or ritual; and the mysteries at which they officiated
symbolized the hope that even death might be over- come.</p>
<p>Once men had sublimated their longing for grandeur and continuance in
the glory and survival of their family and their clan, and then of a
state that was their creation and collective self. Now the old clan
lines were melting away in the new mobility of peace; and the imperial
state was the spiritual embodiment only of the master class, not of the
powerless multitude of men. Monarchy at the top, frustrating the
participation and merger of the citizen in the state, produced
individualism at the bottom and through the mass. The promise of
personal immortality, of an endless happiness after a life of
subjection, poverty, tribulation, or toil, was the final and
irresistible attrac- tion of the Oriental faiths and of the Christianity
that summarized, absorbed, and conquered them. All the world seemed
conspiring to prepare the way for Christ.</p>
