<h4 id="chapter-xviii">CHAPTER XVIII</h4>
<p>Leo</p>
<p>X1513-21</p>
<p>I. THE BOY CARDINAL</p>
<p>T HE Pope that gave his name to one of the most brilliant and immoral
ages in the history of Rome owed his ecclesiastical career to the po-
litical strategy of his fathe r. Lorenzo de’ Medici had been almost
destroyed by Sixtus IV ; he hoped that the power of his family, and the
security of his progeny in Florence, would be helped by having a Medici
sitting in the college of cardinals, in the inner circles of the Church.
He destined his second son for the ecclesiastical state almost from
Giovanni’s infancy. At seven (1482) the boy was given the tonsure; soon
he was dowered with benefices in commendam: i.e., he was made absentee
beneficiary of church properties, and received their surplus revenue. At
the age of eight he was given the abbacy of Font Douce in France; at
nine the rich abbey of Pas- signano, at eleven the historic abbey of
Monte Cassino; before his election to the papacy Giovanni had collected
sixteen such benefices. 1 At eight he was appointed protonotary
apostolic; at fourteen he was made a cardinal.* The young prelate was
provided with all the education available to a millionaire’s son. He
grew up amid scholars, poets, statesmen, and philos - ophers; he was
tutored by Marsilio Ficino; he learned Greek from Deme- trius
Chalcondyles, philosophy from Bernardo da Bibbiena, who became one of
his cardinals. From the collections of art, and the conversations about
art, in or around his father’s palace h e imbibed that taste for the
beautiful which was almost a religion to him in his mature years. From
his father, perhaps, he learned the profuse and sometimes reckless
generosity, and the gay, almost epicurean, manner of life, which were to
distinguish his cardinalate and his pontificate, with far-reaching
results to the Christian world. At thirteen he entered the university
that his father had re-estab- lished at Pisa; there, for three years, he
studied philosophy and theology,</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be recalled that one might become a cardinal without being
a priest, and that cardinals were chosen for their political ability and
connections rather than for religious qualities.</li>
</ul>

<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>478</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>canon and civil law. When, at sixteen, he was allowed openly to join
the college of cardinals in Rome, Lorenzo sent him off (March 12, 1492)
with one of the most interesting letters in history:</p>
<p>You, and all of us who are interested in your welfare, ought to</p>
<p>esteem ourselves highly favored by Providence, not only for the</p>
<p>many honors and benefits bestowed on our house, but more particu-
larly for having conferred upon us, in your person, the greatest</p>
<p>dignity we have ever enjoyed. This favor, in itself so important,
is</p>
<p>rendered still more so by the circumstances with which it is
accom-</p>
<p>panied, and especially by the consideration of your youth and of our
situation in the world. The first thing that I would therefore suggest
to you is, that you ought to be grateful to God, and continually to</p>
<p>recollect that it is not through your merits, your prudence, or
your</p>
<p>solicitude, that this event has taken place, but through His
favor,</p>
<p>which you can only repay by a pious, chaste, and exemplary life;</p>
<p>and that your obligations to the performance of these duties are
so</p>
<p>much the greater, as in your early years you have given some reason-
able expectation that your riper age may produce such fruits. . . .</p>
<p>Endeavor, therefore, to alleviate the burden of your early
dignity</p>
<p>by the regularity of your life, and by your perseverance in those</p>
<p>studies which are suitable to your profession. It gave me great
satis- faction to learn that in the course of the past year you had
fre-</p>
<p>quently, of your own accord, gone to communion and confession;</p>
<p>nor do I conceive that there is any better way of obtaining the favor
of heaven than by habituating yourself to a performance of these and
similar duties. . . .</p>
<p>I well know that as you are now to reside at Rome, that sink of</p>
<p>all iniquity, the difficulty of conducting yourself by these
admoni-</p>
<p>tions will be increased. The influence of example is itself
prevalent;</p>
<p>but you will probably meet with those who will particularly en-</p>
<p>deavor to corrupt and incite you to vice; because, as you may
your-</p>
<p>self perceive, your early attainment to so great a dignity is not</p>
<p>observed without envy, and those who could not prevent your re-</p>
<p>ceiving that honor will secretly endeavor to diminish it, by
inducing</p>
<p>you to forfeit the good estimation of the public; thereby
precipi-</p>
<p>tating you into that gulf into which they have themselves fallen;
in</p>
<p>which attempt the consideration of your youth will give them a</p>
<p>confidence of success. To these difficulties you ought to oppose</p>
<p>yourself with the greater firmness as there is at present less
virtue</p>
<p>amongst your brethren of the college. I acknowledge indeed that</p>
<p>several of them are good and learned men, whose lives are
exemplary,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>X479</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>and whom I would recommend to you as patterns of your conduct.</p>
<p>By emulating them you will be so much the more known and es-</p>
<p>teemed, in proportion as your age, and the peculiarity of your situa-
tion, will distinguish you from your colleagues. Avoid, however,</p>
<p>. . . the imputation of hypocrisy; guard against all ostentation,
either in your conduct or in your discourse; affect not austerity, nor
even</p>
<p>appear too serious. This advice you will, I hope, in time under-</p>
<p>stand and practise better than I can express it.</p>
<p>Yet you are not unacquainted with the great importance of the</p>
<p>character which you have to sustain, for you well know that all
the</p>
<p>Christian world would prosper if the cardinals were what they ought
to be; because in such a case there would always be a good pope,</p>
<p>upon which the tranquillity of Christendom so materially depends.</p>
<p>Endeavor then to render yourself such that if all the rest
resembled</p>
<p>you we might expect this universal blessing. To give you
particular</p>
<p>directions as to your behavior and conversation would be a matter</p>
<p>of no small difficulty. I shall therefore only recommend that in</p>
<p>your intercourse with the cardinals and other men of rank your</p>
<p>language be unassuming and respectful. . . . On this your first
visit</p>
<p>to Rome it will, however, be more advisable for you to listen to oth-
ers than to speak much yourself. . . .</p>
<p>On public occasions let your equipage and dress be rather below</p>
<p>than above mediocrity. A handsome house and a well ordered family
will be preferable to a great retinue and a splendid residence. . . .
Silk and jewels are not suitable for persons in your station. Your
taste</p>
<p>will be better shown in the acquisition of a few elegant remains
of</p>
<p>antiquity, or in the collecting of handsome books, and by your
at-</p>
<p>tendants being learned and well bred rather than numerous. Invite</p>
<p>others to your house oftener than you receive invitations.
Practise</p>
<p>neither too frequently. Let your own food be plain, and take
suffi-</p>
<p>cient exercise, for those who wear your habit are soon liable,
with-</p>
<p>out great caution, to contract infirmities. . . . Confide in others
too</p>
<p>little rather than too much. There is one rule which I would
recom-</p>
<p>mend to your attention in preference to all others: Rise early in
the</p>
<p>morning. This will not only contribute to your health, but will</p>
<p>enable you to arrange and expedite the business of the day; and
as</p>
<p>there are various duties incident to your station, such as the
perform- ance of divine service, studying, giving audience, etc., you
will find</p>
<p>the observance of this admonition productive of the greatest utility.
… You will probably be desired to intercede for the favors of the</p>
<p>Pope on particular occasions. Be cautious, however, that you trouble
him not too often; for his temper leads him to be most liberal to
those</p>
<p>480</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>who weary him least with their solicitations. This you must observe,
lest you should give him offense, remembering also at times to con-
verse with him on more agreeable topics; and if you should be</p>
<p>obliged to request some kindness from him, let it be done with that
modesty and humility which are so pleasing to his disposition. Fare-
well. 2</p>
<p>Lorenzo died less than a month later, and Giovanni had hardly reached
the “sink of iniquity” when he hurried back to Florence to support his
elder brother Piero in a precarious inheritance of political authority.
It was one of Giovanni’s rare misfortunes that he was again in Florence
when Piero fell. To escape the indiscriminate wrath of the citizens
against the Medici family he disguised himself as a Franciscan friar,
made his way un- recognized through hostile crowds, and applied for
admission to the mon- astery of San Marco, which his forebears had
lavishly endowed, but which was at the time under the command of his
father’s enemy, Savonarola. The friars refused him admission. He hid for
a time in a suburb, and then made his way over the mountains to join his
brothers in Bologna. Disliking Alex- ander VI, he avoided Rome; for six
years he lived as a fugitive or an exile, but apparently never out of
funds. With his cousin Giulio (later Clem- ent VII) and some friends he
visited Germany, Flanders, and France. Fi- nally, reconciling himself to
Alexander, he took up his residence in Rome (1500).</p>
<p>Everybody there liked him. He was modest, affable, and unostenta-</p>
<p>tiously generous. He sent substantial gifts to his old teachers
Politian and Chalcondyles. He collected books and works of art, and even
his ample income hardly sufficed for his aid to poets, artists,
musicians, and scholars. He enjoyed all the arts and graces of life;
nevertheless Guicciardini, who lost no love on the popes, described him
as “having the reputation of a chaste person, and of unblameable
manners”; 3 and Aldus Manutius compli - mented him on his “pious and
irreproachable life.” 4</p>
<p>His vicissitudes were resumed when Julius II appointed him papal
legate to govern Bologna and the Romagna (1511). He accompanied the
papal army to Ravenna; walked unarmed amid the battle, encouraging the
sol- diers; stayed too long on the field of defeat, administering the
sacraments to the dying; and was captured by a Greek detachment in the
service of the victorious French. Taken as a prisoner to Milan, he was
pleased to note that even the French soldiers paid little attention to
the schismatic Cardinals and their peregrinating council, but came
eagerly to him for his blessing, his absolution, perhaps his purse. He
escaped from his lenient captors,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>joined the Spanish-papal forces that sacked Prato and took Florence,
and shared with his brother Giuliano in the restoration of the Medici to
power (1512). A few months later he was called to Rome to take part in
selecting a successor to Julius.</p>
<p>He was still only thirty-seven, and could hardly have expected that
he himself would be chosen pope. He entered the conclave in a litter,
suffer- ing from an anal fistula. 5 After a week of debate, and
apparently without simony, Giovanni de’ Medici was elected (March 11,
1513), and took the name of Leo X. He was not yet a priest, but this
defect was remedied on March 15.</p>
<p>Everybody was surprised and delighted. After the dark intrigues
of</p>
<p>Alexander and Caesar Borgia, and the wars and turbulence and tantrums
of Julius, it was a relief that a young man already distinguished for
his easy- going good nature, his tact and courtesy, and his opulent
patronage of let- ters and art, was now to lead the Church, presumably
in the ways of peace. Alfonso of Ferrara, so relentlessly fought by
Julius, had no fear in coming to Rome. Leo reinvested him with all his
ducal dignities, and the grateful prince held the stirrup as Leo mounted
a horse to ride in the coronation procession of March 17. These
inauguration ceremonies were lavish be- yond any precedent, costing
100,000 ducats. 6 The banker Agostino Chigi provided a float on which a
Latin inscription proclaimed hopefully: “Once Venus” (Alexander)
“reigned, then Mars” (Julius), “now Pallas” (Wis - dom) “rules.” A
pithier epigram ran the rounds: “Mars was, Pallas is, I, Venus, will
always be.” 7 Poets, sculptors, painters, goldsmiths rejoiced; humanists
promised themselves a revival of the Augustan Age. Never had a man
mounted the pontifical chair under more favorable auspices of pub- lic
approbation.</p>
<p>Leo himself, if we may believe the scribblers of the time, said
pleasantly to his brother Giuliano: Godiamoci il papato, poiche Dio ci
I’ha dato —“ Let us enjoy the papacy, since God has given it to us.” 8
The remark, possibly apocryphal, indicated no irreverence, but a blithe
spirit, ready to be gen- erous as well as happy, and ingenuously
unaware, amid its good fortune, that half of Christendom was swelling
with revolt against the Church.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE HAPPY POPE</li>
</ol>
<p>He began with excellent measures. He forgave the cardinals who had
staged the anticouncil of Pisa and Milan; that threat of schism ended.
He promised — and kept his promise — to refrain from touching the
estates left</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>by cardinals. He reopened the Lateran Council, and welcomed the dele-
gates in his own graceful Latin. He effected some minor ecclesiastical
re- forms, and reduced taxes; but his edict calling for larger reforms
(May 3,</p>
<ol start="1514" type="1">
<li>encountered so much opposition from the functionaries whose in- com
es it would abate that he made no strenuous effort to enforce it. 9 “I
will think the matter over,” he said, “and see how I can satisfy every -
body.” 10 This was his character, and his character was his fate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Raphael’s portrait of him (Pitti), painted between 1517 and 1519, is
not as well known as that of Julius, but that was partly Leo’s fault:
there were</p>
<p>The basic quality in Leo, born of his fortunate life, was good
nature. He had a pleasant word for everybody, saw the best side of
everybody except the Protestants (whom he could not begin to
understand), and gave so gen- erously to so many that even this profuse
philanthropy, involving heavy drafts on Christian purses, shared in
causing the Reformation. We hear much of his courtesy, his tact, his
amiability, his cheerful temper even in sickness and pain. (His fistula,
repeatedly operated upon, always returned, and sometimes made locomotion
an agony.) So far as he could, he let oth- ers lead their own lives. His
initial moderation and kindliness yielded to severity when he discovered
some cardinals plotting against his life. At times he was relentlessly
hard, as with Francesco Maria della Rovere of Urbino and Gianpaolo
Baglioni of Perugia. 11 He could lie like a diplomat when he had to, and
now and then bettered the instruction of the treacher- ous statesmanship
that enmeshed him. More often he was humane, as when he forbade (in
vain) the enslavement of American Indians, and did his best</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>to check the Inquisitorial ferocity of Ferdinand the Catholic. 12
Despite his general worldliness he fulfilled conscientiously all his
religious duties, ob- served the fasts, and recognized no inherent
contradiction between religion and gaiety. He has been charged with
saying to Bembo: “It is well known to all ages how profitable this fable
of Christ has been to us”; but the sole authority for this is a violent
polemic work, The Pageant of Popes, written about 1574 by an obscure
Englishman, John Bale; and the freethinking Bayle and the Protestant
Roscoe alike reject the story as itself a fable. 13</p>
<p>His enjoyments ranged from philosophy to buffoons. He had learned at
his father’s table to appreciate poe try, sculpture, painting, music,
callig- raphy, illumination, textiles, vases, glass — all the forms of
the beautiful ex- cept perhaps their source and norm, woman; and though
his enjoyment of the arts was too indiscriminate to be a guide to taste,
his patronage of artists and poets carried on in Rome the magnanimous
traditions of his ancestors in Florence. He was too easygoing to take
philosophy to heart; he knew how precarious all conclusions are, and did
not bother his head with meta- physics after his college days. At meals
he had books read to him, usually of history, or he listened to music.
There his taste was sure; he had a good ear and a melodious voice. He
kept several musicians at his court, and paid them lavishly. The
improvisatore Bernardo Accolti (called Unico Aretino because of his
birth in Arezzo and his unequaled facility in impromptu poetry and
music) was able, with the fees that Leo paid him, to buy the little
duchy of Nepi; a Jewish lute player earned a castle and the title of
count; the singer Gabriele Merino was made an archbishop. 14 Under Leo’s
care and encouragement the Vatican choir reached an unprecedented de-
gree of excellence. Raphael rightly pictured the Pope as reading a book
of sacred music. Leo collected musical instruments for their beauty as
well as their tone. One was an organ adorned with alabaster, and judged
by Castiglione to be the loveliest that he had ever seen or heard.</p>
<p>Leo liked also to keep at his court a number of jesters and buffoons.
This accorded with the custom of his father and of contemporary kings,
and did not altogether shock a Rome that loved laughter only next to
wealth and venery; to our hindsight it seems offensive that jests light
or coarse should have echoed through the papal court while the
Reformation raged in Ger- many. It amused Leo to see one of his monk
buffoons swallow a pigeon at a mouthful, or forty eggs in succession. 15
He received with pleasure from a Portuguese embassy a white elephant —
brought from India — which genu- flected thrice on meeting His Holiness.
16 To bring him a person whose wit, deformity, or imbecility could
refresh his mirth was an open sesame to his</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>heart . 17 He seems to have felt that to indulge in such diversions
now and then would distract him from physical pain, relieve his mind of
cosmic wor- ries, and prolong his life . 18 There was something
disarmingly childlike about him. Occasionally he would play cards with
cardinals, allow the public to sit in as spectators, and then distribute
gold pieces to the crowd.</p>
<p>Above all other amusements he loved to hunt. It controlled his
tendency to corpulence, and allowed him to enjoy the open air and the
countryside after being a prisoner of the Vatican. He kept a large
stable, with a hun- dred grooms. It was his custom to devote nearly all
of October to the chase. His physicians highly approved of his
addiction, but his master of ceremonies, Paris de Grassis, complained
that the Pope kept his heavy boots on so long that “no one can kiss his
feet”— at which Leo laughed heartily . 19 We get a kindlier view of the
Pope than in Raphael’s picture when we read how the peasants and
villagers would come to greet him as he passed along their roads, and
would offer him their modest gifts — which were so hand- somely returned
by the pontiff that the people eagerly awaited his hunting trips. To the
poor girls among them he gave marriage dowries; he paid the debts of the
sick or aged, or the parents of large families . 29 These simple folk
loved him more sincerely than the 2000 persons who made up his me- nage
at the Vatican.*</p>
<p>But Leo’s court was no mere focus of amusement and hilarity. It was
also the meeting place of responsible statemen, and Leo was one of them;
it was the center of the intellect and wit of Rome, the place where
scholars, educators, poets, artists, and musicians were welcomed or
housed; the scene of solemn ecclesiastical functions, ceremonious
diplomatic receptions, costly banquets, dramatic or musical
performances, poetical recitations, and exhibitions of art. It was
without question the most refined court in the world at that time. The
labors of popes from Nicholas V to Leo himself in the improvement and
adornment of the Vatican, in the assemblage of liter- ary and artistic
genius, and of the ablest ambassadors in Europe, made the court of Leo
the zenith not of the art (for that had come under Julius) but of the
literature and brilliance of the Renaissance. In mere quantity of cul-
ture history had never seen its equal, not even in Periclean Athens or
Au- gustan Rome . 22</p>
<p>The city itself prospered and expanded as Leo’s gathered gold
flowed</p>
<ul>
<li>On these hunts Leo’s favorite retreat was the Villa Magliana. Built
for Sixtus IV, en- larged by Innocent VIII and Julius II, it was adorned
for Julius with frescoes of Apollo and the Muses by the Umbrian Giovanni
di Pietro (Lo Spagna). For its chapel Raphael (be- tween 1513 and 1520)
designed three frescoes, of which two survive in the Louvre; probably
they were painted by Lo Spagna from Raphael’s cartoons. 21</li>

<p>along its economic arteries. In thirteen years after his accession,
said the Venetian ambassador, ten thousand houses were built in Rome,
chiefly by newcomers from northern Italy following the migration of the
Renaissance. Florentines in particular crowded in to pick plums from a
Florentine pon- tificate. Paolo Giovio, who moved in Leo’s court,
estimated the population of Rome at 85,ooo. 2s It was not yet so fair a
city as Florence or Venice, but it was now by common consent the hub of
Western civilization; Marcello Alberini, in 1527, called it “the
rendezvous of the world.” 24 Leo, amid amusements and foreign affairs,
regulated the importation and price of food, abrogated monopolies and
“corners,” reduced taxes, administered justice impartially, struggled to
drain the Pontine marshes, promoted agriculture in the Campagna, and
continued the work of Alexander and Julius in open- ing or improving
streets in Rome. 30 Like his father in Florence, he provided circenses
as well as panem — engaged artists to plan gorgeous pageants, en-
couraged the masked festivities of Carnival, even allowed Borgian bull-
fights to be staged in St. Pet er’s square. He wished the people to
share in the happiness and jollity of the new Golden Age.</p>
<p>The city took its cue from the Pope, and let joy be unconfined.
Prelates, poets, parasites, panders, and prostitutes hurried to Rome to
drink the golden rain. The cardinals — dowered by the pontiffs, and
above all by Leo, with innumerable benefices that sent them revenues
from all parts of Latin Christendom — were now far richer than the old
nobility, which was sinking into economic and political decay. Some
cardinals had an income of 30,000 ducats a year (75, 000,). 31 They
lived in stately palaces manned by as many as three hundred servants 32
and adorned with every art and luxury known to the time. They did not
quite think of themselves as ecclesiastics; they were statemen,
diplomats, administrators; they were the Roman Senate of the Roman
Church; and they proposed to live like senators. They smiled at those
foreigners who expected of them the abstinence and continence of
priests. Like so many men of their age, they judged conduct not by moral
but by esthetic standards; a few commandments might be broken with im-
punity if it was done with courtesy and taste. They surrounded
themselves with pages, musicians, poets, and humanists, and now and then
dined with courtly courtesans. 33 They mourned that their salons were
normally wom- anless; “all Rome,” according to Cardinal Bibbiena, “says
that nothing is wanting here but a Madonna to hold a court.” 34 They
envied Ferrara, Ur - bino, and Mantua, an d rejoiced when Isabella
d’Este came to spread her robes and feminine graces over their unisexual
feast.</p>

<p>height, and patronage was opulent. There had been cultivated circles
in the smaller capitals, and Castiglione preferred the quiet coterie of
Urbino to the cosmopolitan, noisier, flashier civilization of Rome. But
Urbino was a tiny island of culture; this was a stream, a sea. Luther
came and saw it, and was shocked and repelled; Erasmus came and saw it,
and was charmed to ecstasy. 35 A hundred poets proclaimed that the
Satumia regna had re- turned.</p>
<p>hi. scholars</p>
<p>On November 5, 1513, Leo issued a bull uniting two impoverished
insti- tutions of learning: the Studium sacri palatii — the College of
the Holy Palace, i.e., the Vatican — and the Studium urbis, or City
College; these now became the University of Rome, and were housed in a
building soon known as the Sapienza. 36 These schools had prospered
under Alexander but lan- guished under Julius, who diverted their funds
to war, and preferred a sword to a book. Leo supported the new
University handsomely until he too was enmeshed in the expensive game of
competitive destruction. He brought in a bevy of devoted scholars, so
that soon the institution had eighty-eight professors — fifteen in
medicine alone — receiving from fifty to 530 florins (25 to 625?) a
year. Leo, in these early years of his pon- tificate, did everything
that he could to make the combined colleges the most scholarly and
flourishing university in Italy.</p>
<p>It was one of his credits that he established the study of Semitic
lan- guages. A chair in the University of Rome was devoted to the
teaching of Hebrew, and Teseo Ambrogio was appointed to teach Syriac and
Chaldaic in the University of Bologna. Leo welcomed the dedication of a
Hebrew grammar composed by Agacio Guidacerio. Learning that Sante
Pagnini was translating the Old Testament from the original Hebrew into
Latin, he asked to see a specimen, liked it, and undertook at once the
expense of the laborious enterprise.</p>
<p>It was Leo, too, who restored Greek studies, which had begun to
decline. He invited to Rome the old scholar John Lascaris, who had been
teaching Greek in Florence, France, and Venice; and with him he
organized a Greek Academy in Rome, distinct from the University. To
Lascaris’ pupil</p>
<p>Marcus Musurus, chief aide to Manutius, Bembo wrote for Leo (August

<p>disposition, who may compose a seminary of liberal studies, and from
whom the Italians may derive the proper use and knowledge of the Greek
tongue .” 37 A month later Manutius published the edition of Plato that
Musurus had completed, and the great printer dedicated the work to the
Pope. Leo responded by granting to Aldus, for fifteen years, the
exclusive privilege of reprinting the Greek or Latin books that Aldus
had already issued, or would in that period publish; all who should
encroach upon this privilege were by that deed excommunicated and
subject to penalties; this privilegium ad imprimendum solum was the
Renaissance way of giving to a printer a copyright on the editions that
he had paid to prepare. Leo added to the privilege an earnest
recommendation that the Aldine publications should be moderately priced;
they were. The Greek college was established in the house of the Colocci
on the Quirinal, and a press was set up there to print textbooks and
scholia for the students. A similar “Medicean</p>
<p>Academy” for Greek studies was about the same time founded in
Florence.</p>
<p>The Pope’s enthusiasm for the classics was almost a religion. He

<p>plenary indulgence . 39</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>Leo gave the purloined manuscript to Filippo Beroaldo, with
instructions to correct and edit the text, and print it in an elegant
but convenient form. Said Leo in this letter of instruction:</p>
<p>We have been accustomed, even in our early years, to think that</p>
<p>nothing more excellent or useful has been given by the Creator to</p>
<p>mankind — if we except only the knowledge and true worship of</p>
<p>Himself — than these studies, which not only lead to the ornament</p>
<p>and guidance of human life, but are applicable and useful to
every</p>
<p>particular situation, consoling in adversity, pleasing and
honorable</p>
<p>in prosperity; insomuch that without them we should be deprived</p>
<p>of all the grace of life and all the polish of society. The security
and</p>
<p>extension of these studies seem chiefly to depend on two circum-</p>
<p>stances: the number of learned men, and the ample supply of excel-
lent texts. As to the first of these we hope, with the divine
blessing,</p>
<p>to show still more evidently our earnest desire and disposition
to</p>
<p>reward and honor their merits, this having been for a long time past
our chief delight. . . . With respect to the acquisition of books,
we</p>
<p>return thanks to God that in this also an opportunity is now afforded
us of promoting the advantage of mankind. 4 *</p>
<p>Leo thought that the judgment of the Church should determine what
literature would advantage mankind, for he renewed Alexander’s edict for
the episcopal censorship of books.</p>
<p>In the sack of the Medici Palace (1494) some of the books collected
by Leo’s ancestors had been dispersed. Most of them, however, had been
bought by the monks of San Marco; and these salvaged volumes Leo, while
still a cardinal, had repurchased for 2652 ducats (3,150?), and had
trans- ferred to his palace in Rome. This Laurentian Library was
returned to Florence after Leo’s death; we shall see its further fortune
later.</p>
<p>The Vatican Library had now swollen to such proportions as to need a
corps of scholars for its care. When Leo acceded to the papacy the head
librarian was Tommaso Inghirami — a nobleman and poet, a
conversationalist noted for wit and brilliance in a society of brilliant
wits, and an actor whose success in the part of Phaedra in Seneca’s
Hippolytus earned him the nick - name of Fedra. When he died in a street
accident in 15 16 he was replaced as bibliotecario by Filippo Beroaldo,
who divided his affections between Tacitus and the learned courtesan
Imperia, and wrote such excellent Latin poetry as to receive six
independent translations into French, one by Cle- ment Marot. Girolamo
Aleandro or Aleander, who became librarian in 1519, was a man of temper,
learning, and ability. He spoke Latin and</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>489</p>
<p>Greek, and Hebrew so fluently that Luther mistakenly pronounced him a
Jew. At the Diet of Augsburg (1520) he strove with more passion than
wisdom to halt the Protestant tide. Paul III made him a cardinal (1538),
but four years later Aleander died through too assiduous care of his
health and too frequent use of medicine. 41 He was highly indignant at
being taken off at sixty-two, and scandalized his friends with his
exasperation at the ways of Providence. 42</p>
<p>Private libraries were now numerous in Rome. Aleander himself had a
considerable collection, which he bequeathed to Venice. Cardinal
Grimani, envied by Erasmus, had eight thousand volumes, in a variety of
languages; he willed these books to the church of San Salvador in
Venice, where they were destroyed by fire. Cardinal Sadoleto had a
precious library, which he put on a ship to send to France; it was lost
at sea. Bembo’s library was rich in Provengal poets and original
manuscripts — e.g., of Petrarch; this collec- tion passed to Urbino,
thence to the Vatican. Rich laymen like Agostino Chigi and Bindo
Altoviti imitated the popes and the cardinals in collecting books,
engaging artists, and supporting poets and scholars.</p>
<p>These abounded in Leo’s Rome beyond any precedent or later parallel.
Many cardinals were themselves scholars; some, like Egidio Canisio,
Sado- leto, and Bibbiena, had been made cardinals because they were
scholars of long service to the Church. Most of the cardinals in Rome
acted as patrons, usually by rewarding dedications; and the homes of
Cardinals Riario, Gri- mani, Bibbiena, Alidosi, Petrucci, Farnese,
Soderini, Sanseverino, Gonzaga, Canisio, and Giulio de’ Medici were
surpassed only by the papal court as meeting places for the intellectual
and artistic talent of the city. Castiglione, whose genial nature made
friends with both the amiable Raphael and the dour and unapproachable
Michelangelo, maintained a modest salon of his own.</p>
<p>Leo, of course, was the patron par excellence. No one who could turn
a good Latin epigram went away from him giftless. As in the days of
Nicholas V, scholarship — but now also poetry — constituted a claim to
some place in the vast officialdom of the Church. Lesser lights became
apostolic scribes, abbreviatores, brief-writers; brighter luminaries
rose to be canons, bishops, protonotaries; stars like Sadoleto and Bembo
became secretaries to the Pope; some, like Sadoleto and Bibbiena, were
made cardinals. Cice- ronian oratory again resounded in Rome; epistles
rose and fell in cadenced periods; Virgilian and Horatian verse flowed
in a thousand rivulets into the Tiber as their final destination. Bembo
set the stylistic standard pontifically; “far better to speak like
Cicero^’ he wrote to Isabella d’Este, “than to be</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>pope.” 43 His friend and colleague , Iacopo Sadoleto, shamed most of
the humanists by combining an impeccable Latin style with impeccable
morals. There were many men of high integrity among the cardinals of
this age, and Leo’s humanists were, by and large, of finer temper and
life than t hose of the preceding generation. 44 Some, however, remained
pagan in every- thing but their professed creed. It was an unwritten law
that whatever one believed or doubted, no gentleman would utter anything
critical of a Church that was morally so tolerant, and so munificent a
patron.</p>
<p>Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena was a composite of all these qualities —
scholar, poet, dramatist, diplomat, connoisseur, conversationalist,
pagan, priest, and cardinal. Raphael’s portrait catches only a part of
him— his sly eyes and sharp nose; it covers his baldness with a red hat,
and his gaiety with an unwonted gravity. He was light of foot and word
and spirit, escaping from every vicissitude with a smile. Employed by
Lorenzo the Magnificent as secretary and tutor, h e shared with
Lorenzo’s sons the flight of 1494; but he showed his cleverness by going
to Urbino, charming that urbane circle with his epigrams, and using some
of his leisure to write and stage a risque play — Calandra (c. 1508),
the oldest of Italian prose comedies. Julius II brought him to Rome.
Bernardo managed Leo’s election with so little fuss and friction that
Leo at once made him apostolic protonotary, and the next day treasurer
of the papal household, and six months later cardinal. His dignities did
not prevent him from serving Leo as connoisseur of arts and organizer of
festival pageantry. His play was performed before the Pope, who enjoyed
it with a good stomach. Sent as papal nuncio to France, he fell in love
with Francis I, and had to be recalled as too sensitive for a diplomat.
When Raphael decorated his bathroom, it was, by the Cardinal’s choice,
with the History of Venus and Cupid, a series of pictures recount- ing
the triumphs of love; nearly all done in true antique Pompeian style,
and overleaping Christianity into a world that had never heard of
Christ. Leo, pretending not to notice the Venus in Bibbiena, was
faithful to him to the end.</p>
<p>Leo relished drama in all its comic forms and degrees, from the
simplest farce to the subtlest double-entendres of Bibbiena and
Machiavelli. In the first year of his pontificate he opened a theater on
the Capitol. There, in 1518, he witnessed a performance of Ariosto’s 1
Suppositi, and laughed heartily at the equivocal jests that stemmed from
the plot — the effort of a youth to seduce a maiden. 45 Such gala
performances were more than mere comedy; they included artistic stage
settings (in this case the scenery was painted by Raphael), a ballet,
and entr’acte music by a chorus and an or - chestra of lutes, violas,
cornets, bagpipes, fifes, and a small organ.</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>To Leo’s pontificate belongs one of the major historical works of the
Renaissance. Paolo Giovio was a native of Como. There, and in Milan and
Rome, he practised medicine; but, inspired by the literary excitement
that greeted Leo’s accession, he gave his leisure hours to writing a
Latin history of his own times — i.e., from the invasion of Italy by
Charles VIII to Leo’s pontificate. He was allowed to read the first
sections to Leo, who, with his customary lavishness, pronounced it the
most eloquent and elegant historical writing since Livy, and rewarded
him at once with a pension. After Leo’s death Giovio used what he called
his “pen of gold” to w rite a eulogistic life of his dead patron, and
his “pen of iron” to indict Pope Adrian VI, who ignored him. Meanwhile
he continued to labor at his immense Historiae sui temporis, finally
carrying it to 1547. When Rome was sacked in 1527 he hid his manuscript
in a church; it was found by a soldier, who then asked the author to buy
his own book; Paolo was saved from this indignity by Clement VII, who
persuaded the thief to accept, in lieu of more immediate payment, a
benefice in Spain; Giovio himself was made bishop of Nocera. His
History, and the biographies that he added to it, were acclaimed for
their fluent and vivid style, but were denounced for their careless
inaccura- cies and their flagrant prejudice. Giovio blithely confessed
that he praised or condemned the persons of his story according as they
or their relatives had or had not lubricated his palm. 40</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>POETS</li>
</ol>
<p>The chief glory of this age was its poetry. As in samurai Japan
everyone from peasant to emperor, so in Leo’s Rome everyone from the
pontiff to his clowns wrote verse; and nearly everybody insisted on
reading his latest lines to the tolerant Pope. He loved clever
improvisation, and was himself an expert in that game. Poets pursued him
everywhere with outstretched rhymes; usually he rewarded them somehow;
on occasion he would content himself by replying with an extempore Latin
epigram. A thousand books were dedicated to him. For one he gave Angelo
Colocci 400 ducats</p>
<p>(,000?); but to Giovanni Augurelli, who presented him with a poetical
treatise — Chrysopoeia, or the art of making gold by alchemy — he sent
an empty purse. He did not have time to read all the books whose
dedications he accepted; one such was an edition of the fifth-century
Roman poet Rutilius Namatianus, who advocated the suppression of
Christianity as an enervating poison, and demanded a return to the
worship of the virile pagan gods. 47 To Ariosto — who may have seemed to
Leo sufficiently cared for in Ferrara — he gave merely a bull forbidding
the pirating of his verses. Ariosto</p>
<p>49 1 THE RENAISSANCE (CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>was peeved, having hoped for a gift commensurate with the length of
his epic.</p>
<p>Having lost Ariosto, Leo contented himself too readily with poets of
duller radiance and shorter breath. His generosity often misled him into
rewarding superficial talents as liberally as genius. Guido Postumo
Silvestri, a noble of Pesaro, had fought vigorously, and written
violently, against Alexander and Julius for seizing Pesaro and Bologna;
now he addressed to Leo an elegant elegiac poem comparing the happiness
of Italy under the new Pope with its turmoil and misery in the preceding
reigns; the apprecia- tive pontiff restored to him his confiscated
estates, and made him a com- panion in the papal hunts; but Guido soon
died (said some contemporaries) of eating too lavishly at Leo’s table.
48 Antonio Tebaldeo, who had already made a name for himself as a poet
in Naples, rushed to Rome on Leo’s election, and (says an uncertain
tradition) received five hundred ducats from Leo for an appetizing
epigram; 49 in any case the Pope gave him the superintendence and tolls
of the bridge of Sorga, so that “it may enable Tebaldeo to support
himself in affluence.” 50 But money, though it may finance the talent of
scholars, seems rarely to feed the genius of poets. Tebaldeo wrote more
epigrams, became dependent upon Bembo’s charity after Leo’s death, and
took permanently to his bed, “having no other com - plaint,” said a
friend, “than the loss of his relish for wine.” He lived a long time at
ease on his back, and died at seventy-four.</p>
<p>Francesco Maria Molza of Modena acquired some proficiency in verse
before Leo’s elevation; but hearing of the Pope’s poetic philanthropy,
he left his parents, wife, and children, and migrated to Rome, where he
forgot them in an infatuation for a Roman lady. He composed an eloquent
pasto- ral poemetto entitled La ninja Tiberina in praise of Faustina
Mancini, and was severely wounded by an unknown assassin. He left Rome
after Leo’s death, and at Bologna joined the retinue of Cardinal
Ippolito de’ Medici, who was said to maintain three hundred poets,
musicians, and wits at his court. Molza’s Italian poems were the most
elegant of the time, not except - ing Ariosto’s. His Canz oni equaled
those of Petrarch in style, and surpassed them in fire; for Molza
repeatedly fell out of one amorous conflagration into another, and
perpetually burned. He died of syphilis in 1 544.</p>
<p>Two major minor poets honored Leo’s reign. The career of Marcantonio
Flaminio shows the period in pleasant lights — the unfailing kindness of
the Pope to men of letters, the unenvious friendship of Flaminio,
Navagero, Fracastoro, and Castiglione, though all four were poets, and
the clean lives led by these men in an age when sexual license was
widely condoned. Flaminio was bom at Serravalle in the Veneto, son of
Gianantonio Flaminio,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>himself a poet. Violating a thousand precedents, the father trained
and encouraged the boy to poetry, and sent him at sixteen to present to
Leo a poem written by the youth urging a crusade against the Turks. Leo
had no taste for crusades, but he liked the verses, and provided for the
boy’s further education in Rome. Castiglione took him in hand, and
brought him to Urbino (1515); later the father sent his son to study
philosophy at Bo- logna; finally the poet settled down at Viterbo under
the patronage of the English Cardinal Reginald Pole. He had the
distinction of declining two high appointments — as cosecretary, with
Sadoleto, to Leo, and as secretary to the Council of Trent. Despite
suspicion of sympathizing with the Prot- estant Reformation, he was
handsomely supported by several cardinals. Through all his
peregrinations he longed for the peaceful life and clean air of his
father’s villa near Imola. His poems— nearly all in Latin, and nearly
all in the brief form of odes, eclogues, elegies, hymns, and Horatian
epistles to friends — return again and again to his love of old rural
haunts:</p>
<p>lam vos revisam, iam iuvabit arbores</p>
<p>manu paterna consitas</p>
<p>videre, iam libebit in cubiculo</p>
<p>molles mire somnulos &gt;A —</p>
<p>“Now I shall see you again; now it will delight me to behold the
trees planted by my father’s hand; and I shall rejoice to w oo a little
quiet sleep in my little room.” He complained of being a prisoner in the
tumult of Rome, and envied a friend whom he pictured as hiding in a
village retreat, reading “Socratic books,” and “giving no thought to the
shallow honors conferred b y the vulgar crowd.” 52 He dreamt of
strolling in green valleys with the Georgies of Virgil and the idyls of
Theocritus as his companions. His most touching lines were written to
his dying father:</p>
<p>Vixisti, genitor, bene ac be ate,</p>
<p>nec pauper, neque dives, eruditus</p>
<p>satis, et satis eloquens, valente</p>
<p>semper corpore, mente sana, amicis</p>
<p>iucundus, pietate singulari.</p>

<p>ad divum proficisceris beatas</p>
<p>or as; i, genitor, tuumque natum</p>
<p>olympi cito siste tecum in arce . B3</p>
<p>“You have lived, father, well and happily, neither poor nor rich,
learned enough, eloquent enough, always of strong body and healthy mind;
genial, and of unrivaled piety. Now, having completed eighty years, you
move on</p>
<p>494 THE renaissance (chap, xviii</p>
<p>to the blessed shores of the gods. Go, father, and soon take your son
with you to the high seat of heaven.”</p>
<p>Marco Girolamo Vida proved a more pliable poet for Leo’s purposes.
Born in Cremona, well schooled in Latin, he became so skilled in that
language that he could write it gracefully even in didactic poems De
arte poetica, or on the growth of silkworms, or on the game of chess.
Leo was so pleased with this Sacchiae ludus that he sent for Vida,
loaded him with emoluments, and begged him to crown the literature of
the age with a Latin epic on the life of Christ. So Vida began his
Christiad, which happy Leo died too soon to see. Clement VII continued
Leo’s patronage of Vida, giving him a bishopric to feed on, but Clement
too died before the publica- tion of the epic (1535). Though a monk when
he began it, and a bishop when he finished it, Vida could not refrain
from those classical mythologi- cal allusions that were in the very air
of Leo’s time, but may appear incon - gruous to those who are forgetting
the mythology of Greece and Rome and are making Christianity a literary
mythology in its turn. Vida speaks of God the Father as Superum Pater
nimbipotens — “the cloud -compelling Father of the gods”— and as
Regnator Olympi — “Ruler of Olympus”; he regularly describes Jesus as
her os; he brings in gorgons, harpies, centaurs, and hydras to demand
the death of Christ. So noble a theme deserved its own congenial poetic
form rather than an adaptation of the Aeneid. The finest lines in Vida
are addressed not to Christ in the Christiad but to Virgil in the De
arte poetica:</p>

<p>V. THE RECOVERY OF CLASSIC ART</p>
<p>The pagan spirit of the age was enhanced by the presence and
salvaging of classic art. Poggio, Biondo, Pius II, and others had
denounced the dem- olition of classic structures, but it persisted
nevertheless, and probably in- creased as the influx of money enabled
Rome to build new and larger edifices with the ruins of the old.
Builders continued to throw ancient marbles into furnaces to produce
lime. Paul II used the stone wall of the Colosseum for the palace of San
Marco; Sixtus IV pulled down the temple of Hercules, and turned a Tiber
bridge into cannon balls. The temple of the Sun provided the material
for a chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore, for two public fountains, and for
a papal palace in the Quirinal. Artists them- selves were unconscious
vandals; Michelangelo used one of the columns of the temple of Castor
and Pollux to form a pedestal for the equestrian statue of Marcus
Aurelius, and Raphael took part of another column from the same temple
to make a statue of Jonah. The material for the Sistine Chapel was
quarried from the mausoleum of Hadrian. Practically all the marble used
in raising St. Peter’s was taken from classic buildings; and to the same
new shrine went the podium, steps, and pediment of the temple of Anto-
ninus and Faustina, the triumphal arches of Fabius Maximus and Augustus,
and the temple of Romulus, son of Maxentius. In just four years, 1546-9,
the new builders destroyed or dismantled the temples of Castor and
Pollux, Julius Caesar, and Augustus. 55 The destroyers argued that there
were enough pagan monuments left; that the neglected ruins took up
valuable space and interfered with the orderly rebuilding of the city;
and that the appropriated materials were in most cases used to erect
Christian churches just as beautiful as the ruins, and presumably more
pleasing to God. Mean- while the imperceptible inhumations of time had
buried the Forum and other historic sites under successive layers of
dust, debris, and vegetation, so that the Forum was at places
forty-three feet below the level of the surrounding city; it was largely
abandoned to pasturage, and was called Campo Vaccino — the cow field.
Time is the greatest vandal of them all.</p>
<p>The influx of artists and humanists retarded the rate of demolition,
and generated movements for the preservation of the old monuments. Popes
collected pagan sculpture and architectural fragments into the Vatican
and Capitoline Museums. Poggio, the Medici, Pomponius Laetus, bankers,

<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>dinals gathered into private collections whatever of worth they could
ac- quire of the ancient remains. Many classic sculptures found their
way into private palaces and gardens, and stayed there till the
nineteenth century; hence such names as the Barberini Faun , the
Ludovisi Throne, the Farnese Hercules.</p>
<p>All Rome was thrilled when excavators unearthed (1506), near the
Baths of Titus, a new and complex sculptural group. Julius II sent
Giuliano da Sangallo to examine it, and Michelangelo went along. As soon
as Giuliano saw the statue he cried out, “This is the Laocoon mentioned
by Pliny.” Julius bought it for the Belvedere Palace, paying the finder
and his son a lifetime annuity of 600 ducats (,500?); so precious had
classic sculptures become. Such rewards encouraged art prospectors. A
year later one of these found another ancient group, Hercules ’with the
Infant Telephus; soon afterward the Sleeping Ariadne was unearthed. The
enthusiasm for recovering ancient manuscripts was now equaled by the
eagerness to re- cover lost works of ancient art. Both of these
sentiments were strong in Leo. It was in his pontificate that excavators
found the so-called Antinous, and the statues of the Nile and the Tiber;
and these were placed in the Vatican Museum. Leo bought back, whenever
he could, the gems, cameos, and other dispersed works of art once
possessed by the Medici, and placed these too in the Vatican. Supported
by his patronage, and starting with the previous work of Fra Giocondo
and others, Iacopo Mazochi and Francesco Albertini copied, through four
years, all the inscriptions they could find on Roman remains, and
published them as Epigrammata antiquae urbis Romae (1521) — an event in
classical archeology.</p>
<p>In 1 5 1 5 Leo appointed Raphael superintendent of antiquities.
Helped by Mazochi, Andrea Fulvio, Fabio Calvo, Castiglione, and others,
the young painter formed an ambitious archeological plan. In 1518 he
addressed to Leo a letter adjuring the Pontiff to use the authority of
the Church for the preservation of all classi cal remains. The words may
be Castiglione’s, the passion has the ring of Raphael:</p>
<p>When we reflect upon the divinity of those antique souls, . . .</p>
<p>when we see the corpse of this noble city, mother and queen of the
world, so miserably mangled, . . . how many pontiffs have permitted the
ruin and defacement of the ancient temples, statues, arches and other
buildings, the glory of their founders! … I dare say that all</p>
<p>this new Rome that we now behold, however grand it is and beauti- ful
and adorned with palaces, churches, and other edifices, has been
cemented with lime made from the ancient marbles. . . .</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>The letter recalls how much destruction has taken place even during
Raphael’s ten years in Rome. It surveys the history of architecture, de-
nounces the crude barbarism of the Romanesque and Gothic styles (here
called the Gothic and the Teutonic), and exalts the Greco-Roman orders
as models of perfection and taste. Finally it proposes that a corps of
experts should be formed, that Rome should be divided into the fourteen
regions anciently designated by Augustus, and that in each of these
regions a careful survey and record should be made of all classic
remains. Raphael’s early death, soon followed by Leo’s, d elayed for a
long time this majestic enter- prise.</p>
<p>The influence of the recovered relics was felt in every branch of art
and thought. That influence worked on Brunellesco, Alberti, Bramante;
now it became supreme, until in Palladio it completely and almost
servilely copied ancient forms. Ghiberti and Donatello had tried to
model classi- cally. Michelangelo achieved the classic manner perfectly
in his Brutus, but for the rest he remained his passionate and unclassic
self. Literature transformed Christian theology into pagan mythology,
and replaced para- dise with Olympus. In painting the classic influence
took the form of pagan subjects and — even in Christian themes — pagan
nudes; Raphael himself, dar- ling of the popes, painted Psyches,
Venuses, and Cupids on palace walls; and classic designs and arabesques
mounted the pillars and ran along the cornices and friezes of a thousand
buildings in Rome.</p>
<p>The classical triumph expressed itself most clearly in the new
St. Peter’s.</p>
<p>The cost will amount to a million gold ducats; the Pope has ordered
60,000 for the works. He thinks of nothing else. He has associated</p>
<p>me with an experienced monk who has passed his eightieth year.</p>

<p>Fra Giocondo died July i, 1515; and on the same day Giuliano da</p>
<p>Sangallo withdrew from the group of designers. Raphael, left supreme,
undertook to replace Bramante’s ground plan with a Latin cross, of un -
equal arms, and sketched a cupola that Antonio da Sangallo (nephew of
Giuliano) proved too heavy for its supporting pillars. In 1517 Antonio
was appointed coarchitect with Raphael. Disputes arose now at every
step, and Raphael, burdened with pictorial engagements, lost interest in
the under- taking. Meanwhile Leo ran short of funds, tried to raise more
by issuing indulgences, and as a result found a German Reformation on
his hands (1517). St. Peter’s made no substantial progress until
Michelangelo was put in charge of it in 1546.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MICHELANGELO AND LEO</li>
</ol>
<p>XJulius II had left funds to his executors for the completion, on a
smaller scale, of the tomb that Michelangelo had designed for him. The
artist worked at this task through the first three years of Leo’s
pontificate, and received from the executors, in those years, 6100
ducats (6,250?). Most of what remains of the monument was probably
produced in this period, along with the Christ Risen of Santa Maria
sopra Minerva — a handsome naked athlete whom later taste clothed in a
loincloth of bronze. A letter written by Michelangelo in May, 1518,
tells how Signorelli came to his studio and borrowed eighty giulii
(00?), which he never returned, and adds: “He found me working on a
marble statue four cubits in height, which has the hands bound behind
the back.” 57 This was presumably one of the Prigioni or Captivi
intended to represent the cities or arts made cap- tive by the warrior
Pope. A statue in the Louvre fits the description: a muscular figure
wearing only a loincloth, and with arms so tightly bound at the back
that the cords eat into the flesh. Near it is a finer Captive, naked
except for a narrow band about the breast; here the musculature is not
ex- aggerated; the body is a symphony of health and beauty; this is
Greek perfection. Four unfinished Schiavi or Slaves in the Florence
Academy were apparently intended as caryatids to support the
superstructure of the tomb. The aborted tomb is now in Julius’ church of
San Pietro in Vincoli: a magnificent massive throne, pillars elegantly
carved, and a seated Moses</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>— an ill-proportioned monster of beard and horns and wrathful brow,
hold- ing the Tables of the Law. If we choose to believe an improbable
story in Vasari, Jews could be seen on any Saturday entering the
Christian church “to worship this figure, not as a work of the human
hand, but as something divine.” 58 On Moses’ left is a Leah, on his
right a splendid Rachel — statues that Michael called “the Active and
the Contemplative Life.” The remain - ing figures of the tomb were
indifferently carved by his aides: above the Moses a Madonna, and at her
feet the half-recumbent effigy of Julius II, crowned with the papal
tiara. The whole monument is a torso, the pain- fully interrupted work
of scattered years from 1506 to 1545, confused, enormous, incongruous,
and absurd.</p>
<p>While these figures were being chiseled out, Leo — perhaps during a
stay in Florence — conceived the idea of finishing the church of San
Lorenzo there. This was the shrine of the Medici, containing the tombs
of Cosimo, Lorenzo, and many other members of the family. Brunellesco
had built the church, but had left the fa9ade unfinished. Leo asked
Raphael, Giuliano da Sangallo, Baccio d’Agnolo, Andrea and Iacopo
Sansovino to submit plans for completing the front. Michelangelo,
apparently of his own accord, sent in a plan of his own, which Leo
accepted as the best; hence the Pope cannot be blamed, as so many have
blamed him, for diverting Michael from Julius’ tomb. Leo sent him to
Florence, whence he went to Carrara to quarry tons of marble. Back in
Florence, he hired assistants for the work, quarreled with them, sent
them packing, and brooded inactively in his uncongenial role as
architect. Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici, Leo’s cousin, appropriated some
of the idle marble for work on the cathedral; Michael fumed, but still
dallied. At last (1520) Leo freed him from the contract, and required no
accounting of the funds that had been advanced to the artist. When
Sebastiano del Piombo asked the Pope to give Angelo further assignments,
Leo excused himself. He recognized Michelangelo’s supremacy in art, but,
he said, “he is an alarming man, as you yourself see, and there is no
getting on with him.” Sebastiano reported the conversation to his
friend, adding: “I told His Holiness that your alarming ways did no man
any harm, and that it was only your devotion to the great work to which
you have given yourself that made you seem terrible to others.” 59</p>
<p>What was this famous terribilita? It was, first of all, energy, a
wild</p>
<p>consuming force that tortured Michelangelo’s body, but sustained it,
for eighty-nine years; and second, a power of will that kept that energy
har- nessed and directed to one purpose — art — ignoring almost
everything else. Now energy directed by a unifying will is almost the
definition of genius. The energy that looked upon formless stone as a
challenge, and clawed and</p>

<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>hammered and chiseled it con furia till it took on a revealing
significance, was the same force that swept angrily over the distracting
trivialities of life, took no thought of clothing or cleanliness or
superficial courtesies, and advanced to its end, if not blindly yet with
blinders, over broken promises, broken friendships, broken health, at
last over a broken spirit, leaving the body and mind shattered, but the
work done — the greatest painting, the greatest sculpture, and some of
the greatest architecture, of the time. “If God assist me,” he said, “I
shall produc e the finest thing that Italy has ever</p>
<p>noo w</p>
<p>seen.</p>
<p>He was the least prepossessing figure in an age brilliant with
proud</p>
<p>beauty of person and splendor of dress. Middle height, broad
shoulders, slim frame, large head, high brow, ears protruding beyond the
cheeks, temples bulging out beyond the ears, drawn and somber face,
crushed nose, sharp, small eyes, grizzly hair and beard — this was
Michelangelo in his prime. He wore old clothing, and clung to it till it
became almost part of his flesh; and he seems to have obeyed half of his
father’s advice: “See that you do not wash. Have yourself rubbed down,
but do not wash .” 81 Though rich, he lived like a poor man, not only
frugally but penuriously. He ate what- ever he found at hand, sometimes
dining on a crust of bread. At Bologna he and his three workmen occupied
one room, slept in one bed. “While he was in full vigor,” says Condivi,
“he usually went to bed with his clothes on, even to the tall boots,
which he has always worn because of a chronic tendency to cramp. … At
certain seasons he has kept these boots on for such a length of time
that when he drew them off, the skin came away together with the leather
.” 62 As Vasari puts it, “he had no mind to undress merely that he might
have to dr ess again .” 63</p>
<p>While he prided himself on his supposed noble lineage, he preferred
the poor to the rich, the simple to the intellectual, the toil of a
worker to the leisure and luxuries of wealth. He gave most of his
earnings to maintain his shiftless relatives. He liked solitude; he
found it intolerable to make small talk with third-rate minds; wherever
he was, he followed his own train of thought. He cared little for
beautiful women, and saved a fortune by continence. When a priest
expressed regret that Michelangelo had not married and begotten
children, he replied: “I have only too much of a wife in my art, and she
has given me trouble enough. As to my children, they are the works that
I shall leave; and if they are not worth much, they will at least live
for some time .” 64 He could not bear women about the house. He
preferred males both for companionship and for art. He painted</p>
<p>women, but always in their maternal maturity, not in the bright
charm</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>501</p>
<p>of their youth; it is remarkable that both he and Leonardo were
apparently insensitive to the physical beauty of woman, who has seemed
to most artists the very embodiment and fountainhead of beauty. There is
no evidence that he was homosexual; apparently all the energy that might
have gone into sex was in his case used up in work. At Carrara he spent
the day, from early morn, in the saddle, directing the stonecutters and
road makers; and the evening in his cabin by lamplight, studying plans,
calculating costs, projecting the morrow’s tasks. He had periods of
apparent sluggishness, and then suddenly the fever of creation would
possess him again, and everything else would be ignored, even the sack
of Rome.</p>
<p>Absorbed in work, he gave himself little time for friendship, though
he had devoted friends. “Rarely did any friend or other person eat at
his table.” 65 He was content with the company of his faithful servant
Fran - cesco degli Amadori, who for twenty-five years took care of him,
and for many years sh ared his bed. Michael’s gifts made Francesco a
rich man, and the artist was heartbroken at his death (1555). For others
he had a bad temper and a sharp tongue, criticized rudely, took offense
readily, suspected everybody. He called Perugino a fool, and expressed
his opinion about Francia’s paintings by telling Francia’s handsome son
that his father made better forms by night than by day. 69 He was
jealous of Raphael’s success and popularity. Though the two artists
respected each other, their sup- porters divided into feuding cabals;
and Iacopo Sansovino sent Michael a letter of violent abuse, saying,
“May the day be cursed on which you ever</p>

<p>Leo neglected Michelangelo partly because he liked men and women of
equable temper, and partly because he had no great love for
architecture</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>

<p>or the massive in art; he preferred a gem to a cathedral, and
miniatures to monuments. He kept Caradosso, Santi de Cola Sabba, Michele
Nardini, and many other goldsmiths busy making jewelry, cameos, medals,
coins, sacred vessels. At his death he left a collection of precious
stones, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, pearls, tiaras, miters,
and pectorals worth 204,655 duc- ats — over ,500,000; we should
remember, however, that most of these had been inherited from his
predecessors, and that they constituted a portion of the papal treasury
immune to depreciations of the currency.</p>
<p>He invited a score of painters to Rome, but Raphael was almost the
only one that he really cared for. He tried Leonardo, and dismissed him
as a dawdler. Fra Bartolommeo came to Rome in 1514, and painted a
St. Peter and a St. Paul ; but the air and excitement disagreed with
him, and he soon returned to the peace of his Florentine monastery. Leo
liked the work of Sodoma, but hardly dared let that reckless rake roam
too freely about the Vatican. Sebastiano del Piombo was appropriated by
Leo’s cousin, Giulio de’ Medici.</p>
<p>Raphael agreed with Leo in both temperament and taste. Both were
amiable epicureans who made Christianity a pleasure and took their
heaven here; but both worked as hard as they played. Leo plied the happy
artist with tasks: the completion of the stanze, the designing of
cartoons for the Sistine Chapel tapestries, the decoration of the
Vatican Loggie, the building of St. Peter’s, the preservation of classic
art. Raphael accepted these com - missions with good cheer and appetite,
and found time, besides, to paint a score of religious pictures, several
series of pagan frescoes, and half a hun- dred Madonnas and portraits
any one of which would have assured him wealth and fame. Leo abused his
complaisance by asking him to arrange fetes, to paint the scenery for a
play, to make a portrait of a beloved elephant. 71 Perhaps overwork, as
well as love, brought Raphael to an early death.</p>
<p>But he was now in the fullness of his powers and the bloom of his
pros- perity. In a letter (July 1, 1514) to his “dear Uncle Simone . . .
who art d ear to me as a father,” and who had reproached him for
persistent bache - lorhood, he writes in a mood of happy
self-confidence:</p>
<p>As for a wife, I must tell you that I am daily thankful that I
did</p>
<p>not take the one you destined for me, or, indeed, any other. In
this</p>
<p>instance I have been wiser than you . . . and I am sure that you must
now see that I am better as I am. I have capital in Rome worth 3000
ducats, and an assured income of fifty more. His Holiness allows me a
salary of 300 ducats for superin tending the rebuilding of
St. Peter’s,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>X503</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>which will not fail me as long as I live. . . . Besides this, they
give me</p>
<p>whatever I ask for my works. I have commenced the decoration of</p>
<p>a large hall for His Holiness, for which I am to get 1200 golden</p>
<p>crowns. Thus you must see, my dear uncle, that I do honor to my</p>
<p>family as well as to my country . 72</p>
<p>At thirty-one he was entering into conscious manhood. He had grown a
dark beard, perhaps to disguise his youth. He lived in comfort, even
splendor, in a palace built by Bramante and bought by Raphael for three
thousand ducats. He dressed in the style of a young aristocrat. On his
visits to the Vatican he was accompanied by a princely retinue of pupils
and clients. Michelangel o reproved him, saying, “You go about with a
suite, like a general”; to which Raphael replied, “And you go about
alone, like a hangman .” 73 He was still a good -natured youth, free
from envy but eager with emulation, not quite as modest as before (how
could he be?), but always helpful to others, presenting masterpieces to
his friends, and even serving as Maecenas and patron to artists less
fortunate or gifted than him- self. But on occasion his wit could be
sharp enough. When two cardinals, visiting his studio, amused themselves
by picking flaws in his pictures — say- ing, for example, that the faces
of the Apostles were too red — he replied: “Do not be surprised at that,
your eminences; I painted them so deliber - ately; may we not think that
they can blush in heaven when they see the Church governed by such men
as you ?” 74 However, he could take correc - tion without resentment, as
in the plans for St. Peter’s. He could flatter a succession of artists
by imitating tbeir excellences, without ever losing his own independence
and originality. He did not need solitude in order to be himself.</p>
<p>His morals were not quite up to his manners. He could not have
painted women so attractively had he not been powerfully attracted by
their charms. He wrote love sonnets on the back of his drawings for the
Disputa. He had a concatenation of mistresses, but everybody, including
the Pope, seemed to think that so great an artist had a right to such
amusements. Va- sari, after describing Raphael’s sexual promisc uity,
apparently saw no con- tradiction in remarking, two pages later, that
“those who copy his virtuous life will be rewarded in heaven .” 75 When
Castiglione asked Raphael where he found the models for the beautiful
women whom he painted, he replied that he created them in his
imagination out of the diverse elements of beauty present in different
women ; 76 hence he needed a large variety of samples. Nevertheless
there is a healthy, life-enhancing tone in his character and his works,
a unity, peace, and serenity in his career, amid the conflicts,
divi-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>sions, envies, and recriminations of the age. He ignored the politics
that were consuming Leo and Italy, perhaps feeling that the repetitious
con- tentions of parties and states for power and privilege are the
monotonous froth of history, and that nothing matters but devotion to
goodness, beauty, and truth.</p>
<p>Raphael left the pursuit of truth to more reckless spirits, and
contented himself with the ser vice of beauty. In the first years of
Leo’s reign he continued the decoration of the Stanza d’Eliodoro. By
some whim of circumstance — and to symbolize the expulsion of the
barbari from Italy — Julius had chosen, for the second main mural of the
room, the historic meeting of Attila and Leo I (452). Raphael’s drawing
had already given the first Leo the features of the second Julius when
the tenth Leo came to the papal throne. The drawing was revised, and Leo
became Leo. More successful than this vast assemblage is the smaller
picture that Raphael painted in an arch over a window of the same room.
Here the new Pope, perhaps to commemorate his escape from the French at
Milan, suggested as topic the deliverance of Peter from prison by an
angel. Raphael used all his compositional artistry to give unity and
life to a story broken by the casement into three scenes: on the left
the sleeping guards, at the top an angel waking Peter, at the right the
angel leading the drowsy and bewil- dered Apostle to freedom. The
radiance of the angel illuminating the cell, shining upon the soldiers’
armor and blinding their eyes, and the crescent</p>
<p>The young artist was avid of every new technique. Bramante, without
Michelangelo’s permission, had secretly taken his friend to see the
frescoes of the Sistine vault before they were finished. Raphael was
deeply im- pressed; perhaps, with the modesty that still accompanied his
pride, he felt himself in the presence of a genius more powerful, if
less gracious, than his own. He let the new influence move him in the
themes and forms of the ceiling frescoes in the room of Helidorus: God
Appearing to Noah, Abra- ham’s Sacrifice, Jacob’s Dream, and The Burning
Bush. It shows again in the Prophet Isaiah that he painted for the
church of St. Augustine.</p>
<p>In 1514 he began work on the room known from its main picture as the
Stanza dell ’ lncendio del Borgo. A medieval legend told how Pope Leo
III (795-816), merely by making the sign of the cross, had put out a
fire that threatened to consume the Borgo — i.e., the borough of Rome
around the Vatican. Probably Raphael made only the cartoon for this
mural, and assigned the painting of it to his pupil Gianfrancesco Penni.
Even so it is a powerful composition, in Raphael’s best episodic
narrative style. Mingling</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>X505</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>classical and Christian story, Raphael showed, on the left, a
handsome and muscular Aeneas carrying to safety his old but muscular
father Anchises. Another nude male, perfectly drawn, hangs from the top
of the wall of the burning building, ready to drop; the influence of
Michelangelo is evident in these three nudes. Adore Raphaelesque is an
excited mother leaning over the wall to hand her infant to a man
stretching up on tiptoe from below. Between magnificent columns groups
of women beseech the aid of the Pope, who from a balcony calmly bids the
fire cease. Raphael here is still at the top of his line.</p>
<p>For the remaining pictures in the room Raphael drew the cartoons,
per- haps helped even in this by his pupils. From these cartoons Perino
del Vaga painted, over the window, The Oath of Leo 111 exculpating
himself before Charlemagne (800); on the exit wall another and greater
pupil, Giulio Romano — the only native Roman prominent in Renaissance
art — pictured The Battle of Ostia, in which Leo IV (looking remarkably
like Leo X)</p>
<p>turned back the invading Saracens (849) ; and in other spaces the
able pupils painted idealized portraits of sovereigns who had deserved
well of the Church. In a final picture, The Coronation of Charlemagne,
Leo X be- comes Leo III; and Francis I, here painted as Charlemagne,
achieves by proxy his ambition to be emperor. The picture echoe d Leo’s
meeting with Francis at Bologna the year before (1516).</p>
<p>Raphael made some preliminary sketches for the fourth stanza, the
Sala di Costantino; the paintings were executed after his death under
the patron- age of Clement VII. Meanwhile Leo X urged him to begin the
decoration of the Loggie — i.e., the open galleries built by Bramante to
surround the court of St. Damasus in the Vatican. Raphael himself had
completed the construction of these galleries; now (15 17-9) he designed
for the ceiling of one gallery fifty-two frescoes retelling the Bible
story from the Creation to the Last Judgment. The actual painting was
delegated to Giulio Romano, Gianfrancesco Penni, Perino del Vaga,
Polidoro Caldara da Caravaggio, and others; while Giovanni da Udine
decorated pilasters and arch soffits with delightful pictures and
arabesques in stucco and paint. These Loggie frescoes sometimes used
themes already treated on the Sistine ceiling, but with a lighter hand
and in a homelier and more cheerful spirit, seeking not grandeur or
sublimity, but pleasant episodes like Adam and Eve and their children
enjoying the fruits of Eden, Abraham visited by three angels, Isaac
embracing Rebecca, Jacob and Rachel at the well, Joseph and Potiphar’s
wife, the finding of Moses, David and Bathsheba, the adoration of the
shepherds. These little paintings, of course, cannot compare with
Michel-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>506</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>angelo’s; they are in a different world and genre— a world of
feminine grace, not of masculine strength; they are the sign of the
lighthearted Raphael in his last five years, while the Sistine ceiling
is Michelangelo in the culmina- tion of his powers.</p>
<p>Perhaps Leo was a bit jealous of the ceiling and the glory that it
had shed upon the reign of Julius. Soon after his accession he conceived
the idea of commemorating his own pontificate by ad rning the walls of
the Sistine Chapel with tapestries. There were no weavers in Italy who
could match those of Flanders, and Leo thought there were no painters in
Flanders who could equal Raphael. He commissioned the artist (1515) to
draw ten car- toons describing scenes from the Acts of the Apostles.
Seven of these car- toons were bought at Brussels by Rubens (1630) for
Charles I of England, and are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London. They are among the most remarkable drawings ever made. Raphael
lavished here all his knowledge of composition, anatomy, and dramatic
effect; in the whole range of drawing few pieces surpass The Miraculous
Draught of Fishes, Christ’s Charge to Peter, The Death of Ananias, Peter
Healing the Lame Man, or Paul Preaching at Athens — though in this last
the fine figure of Paul is stolen from Masaccio’s frescoes in
Florence.</p>
<p>The ten cartoons were sent to Brussels, and there Bernaert van Orley,
who had been a pupil of Raphael in Rome, superintended the transference
of the designs to silk and wool. In the short space of three years seven
of the tapestries were completed, and all ten were finished by 1520. On
De- cember 26, 1519, seven were hung on the Sistine walls, and the elite
of Rome were invited to see them. They created a furore. Paris de
Grassis noted in his diary: “The whole chapel was struck dumb by the
sight of these hangings; by universal consent there is nothing more
beautiful in the world.” 77 Each tapestry had cost a total of 2000
ducats (5,000); the expenditure for the ten helped to deplete Leo’s
finances, and to induce the further sale of indulgences and offices.*
Leo must have felt that now he and Raphael had met Julius and
Michelangelo in a battle of art in the same chapel, and had carried off
the prize.</p>

<li>At Leo’s death the tapestries were pawned to ease the papal
insolvency; at the sack of Rome they were seriously injured; one was cut
into fragments, and two were sold to Con- stantinople. All were restored
to the Sistine Chapel by 1554; and every year, on the feast of Corpus
Christi, they were exhibited to the people in the Piazza di San Pietro.
Louis XIV had them copied in oils. Seized by the French in 1798, they
were again returned to the Vatican in 1808. They are now displayed there
in a hall of their own, the Galleria degli Arazzi, or Hall of the
Arrases.</li>

<p>Michelangelo’s in eighty -nine — makes it difficult to summarize him
justly, for nearly every product was a masterpiece deserving
commemoration. He designed mosaics, woodwork, jewelry, medals, pottery,
bronze vessels and reliefs, perfume boxes, statues, palaces.
Michelangelo was disturbed when he heard that Raphael had made a model,
and that from this the Florentine sculptor Lorenzetto Lotti had carved
in marble, a statue of Jonah riding the whale; but the result reassured
him — Raphael had strayed unwisely out of his pictorial element. He did
better in architecture, for there his friend Bramante guided him. About
1514, when he was put in charge of St. Pe- ter’s, he had his friend
Fabio Calvo trans late Vitruvius for him into Italian; and from that
time he was an ardent lover of classical architectural styles and forms.
His continuation of Bramante’s Loggie so pleased Leo that the Pope made
him director of all the architectural and artistic departments of the
Vatican. Raphael built some undistinguished palaces in Rome, and shared
in designing the elegant Villa Madama for Cardinal Giulio de’</p>
<p>Medici; this, however, was chiefly the work of Giulio Romano as
architect and painter, and of Giovanni da Udine as decorator. Raphael’s
one surviv - ing architectural masterpiece is the Palazzo Pandolfini,
built from his plans after his death; it is still among the finest
palaces in Florence. With sublime indifference he turned his talents to
the service of his friend the banker Chigi, and built for him a chapel
in the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, and for his horses such stables
(Stalle Chigiane, 1514) as might have served for a palace. To understand
Raphael, and Leo’s Rome, we must pause for a moment and look at the
egregious Chigi.</p>
<ol start="8" type="I">
<li>AGOSTINO CHIGI</li>
</ol>
<p>He typified a new group in Rome: rich merchants or bankers, usually
of non-Roman origin, whose wealth put the old Roman nobility in the
shade, and whose generosity to artists and writers was exceeded only by
that of popes and cardinals. Born in Siena, he had imbibed financial
subtlety with his daily food. By the age of forty-three he was chief
Italian moneylender to republics and kingdoms, Christian or infidel. He
financed trade with a dozen countries including Turkey, and by lease
from Julius II acquired a monopoly in alum and salt. 78 In 151 1 he gave
Julius an additional reason for war on Ferrara — Duke Alfonso had dared
to sell salt at a lower price than Agostino could afford to take. 79 His
firm had branch houses in every major Italian town, and in
Constantinople, Alexandria, Cairo, Lyons, London, Amsterdam. A hundred
vessels sailed under his flag; twenty thousand men</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>508</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>were in his pay; a half-dozen sovereigns sent him gifts; his best
horse was from the Sultan; when he visited Venice (to which he had lent
125,000 ducats), he was seated next to the doge. 80 Asked by Leo X to
estimate his wealth, he answered, perhaps for reasons of tax, that it
was impossible; however, his annual income was reckoned to be 70,000
ducats (75,000). His silver plate and jewelry equaled in quantity that
of all the Roman nobility combined. His bedstead was carved in ivory and
encrusted with gold and precious stones. The fixtures of his bathroom
were of solid sil- ver. 81 He had a dozen palaces and villas, of which
the most ornate was the Villa Chigi, on the west bank of the Tiber.
Designed by Baldassare Peruzzi, adorned with paintings by Peruzzi,
Raphael, Sodoma, Giulio Romano, and Sebastiano del Piombo, it was hailed
by the Romans, on its completion in 1512, as the lordliest palace in
Rome.</p>
<p>The Chigi banquets had almost the reputation that those of Lucullus
had gained in Caesar’s time. In the stables that Raphael had just
completed, and before they were occupied by handsomer beasts than men,
Agostino entertained Pope Leo and fourteen cardinals, in 1518, with a
repast that proudly cost him 2000 ducats (5,000?). At that distinguished
function eleven massive silver plates were stolen, presumably by
servants in the retinue of the guests. Chigi forbade any search, and
expressed courteous astonishment that so little had been stolen. 82 When
the feast was over, the silk carpet, the tapestries, and the fine
furniture were removed, and a hun- dred horses filled the stalls.</p>
<p>A few months later the banker gave another dinner, this time in the
loggia of the villa, projecting out over the river. After each course
all the silver used in serving it was thrown into the Tiber before the
eyes of the guests, to assure them that no plate would be used twice.
After the banquet Chigi’s servants drew up the silver from the net that
had secretly been lowered into the stream beneath the windows of the
loggia. 83 At a dinner given in the main hall of the villa on August 28,
1519, each guest — including Pope Leo and twelve cardinals — was served
on silver or gold plate faultlessly engraved with his own motto, crest,
and coat of arms, and was fed with special fish, game, vegetables,
fruits, delicacies, and wines freshly imported for the occasion from his
own country or locality.</p>
<p>Chigi tried to atone for this plebeian display of wealth by an
openhanded support of literature and art. He financed the editing of
Pindar by the scholar Cornelio Benigno of Viterbo, and set up in his own
home a press for its printing; and the Greek type cut for that press
excelled in beauty that which Aldus Manutius had used in publishing the
Odes two years</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>509</p>
<p>before. This was the first Greek text printed in Rome (1515). A year
later the same press issued a correct edition of Theocritus. Though
himself a man of modest education, Agostino prided himself on his
friendship with Bembo, Giovio, even Aretino; in this last case the Roman
adage, pecunia non olet — “money does not smell”— included a transitive
verb. Next to money and his mistress, Chigi loved all the forms of
beauty that art had fashioned. He rivaled Leo in commissions to artists,
and led him a merry pace in the pagan interpretation of the Renaissance.
He collected into his palaces and villas such quantities of art as would
have furnished a museum. He seems to have thought of his villa as not
merely his home, but as a public gallery of art, to which the public
might occasionally be admitted.</p>
<p>In that villa, at the aforementioned dinner on August 28, 1519, Leo
him- self officiating, Chigi at last married the faithful mistress with
whom he had lived for the preceding eight years. Eight months later he
died, within a few days of the death of Raphael. His estate, valued at
800,000 ducats (0,000,000? ) was divided chiefly among his children.
Lorenzo, the oldest son, led a life of dissipation, and was adjudged
insane in 1553. The Villa Chigi was sold to the second Cardinal
Alessandro Farnese for a small sum about 1580, and from that time bore
the name of Farnesina.</p>
<ol start="9" type="I">
<li>RAPHAEL: THE LAST PHASE</li>
</ol>
<p>Raphael had accepted minor commissions from the jolly banker as early
as 1510. In 1514 he painted a fresco for him in the church of Santa
Maria della Pace. The space provided was narrow and irregular; Raphael
made it seem adequate by distributing in it four sibyls — Cumaean,
Persian, Phryg- ian, Tiburtine — pagan oracles here sterilized with
attendant angels. They are graceful figures, since Raphael could hardly
draw anything without grace; Vasari thought they were the young master’s
finest work. They are a weak imitation of Angelo’s sibyls, except for
the Tiburtine; here the priestess, haggard with age and frightened by
the evil fortune she is fore- telling, is a figure of original and
dramatic power. According to a story not traceable beyond the
seventeenth century, some misunderstanding arose be- tween Raphael and
Chigi’s treasurer ab out the fee for these sibyls. Raphael had received
five hundred ducats, but, when finished, claimed an additional payment.
The treasurer thought the five hundred already paid were all that were
due. Raphael suggested that the treasurer should appoint a competent
artist to evaluate the frescoes; the official chose Michelangelo;
Raphael agreed. Michelangelo, despite his supposed jealousy of Raphael,
judged</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>5 IO</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>that each head in the picture was worth one hundred ducats. When the
astonished treasurer brought this judgment to Chigi the banker ordered
him to pay Raphael at once four hundred additional ducats. “Be
tender</p>
<p>Chigi had to be careful, for in that same year Raphael was painting
for him a delectable fresco in the Villa Chigi — The Triumph of Galatea.
The story was taken from Politian’s Giostra: Polyphemus, the one -eyed
Cy- clops, tries to seduce the nymph Galatea by his songs and flute; she
turns from him in disdain — as if to say, Who would marry an artist? —
and gives the reins to two dolphins who pull her shell-like vessel out
to sea. At her left a robust nymph is gaily seized by a powerful Triton,
while from the clouds cupids shoot superfluous arrows to encourage love.
Here the pagan Renaissance is in full swing, and Raphael enjoys himself
picturing women as his bright imagination thought they should be
formed.</p>
<p>In 1516 he adorned the bathroom of Cardinal Bibbiena with frescoes
glorifying Venus and the triumphs of love. In 1517 he disported himself
still more voluptuously in designs for the ceiling and pendentives of
the Villa Chigi’s central hall. Here he adapted his genial fancy to a
tale from Apuleius’ Metamorphoses. Psyche, daughter of a king, arouses
by her beauty the envy of Venus; the spiteful goddess bids her son Cupid
inspire Psyche with a passion for the most contemptible man to be found.
Cupid descends to the earth to fulfill his mission, but falls in love
with Psyche at first touch. He visits her in the dark, and bids her
repress her curiosity as to who he is. Inevitably she rises from her bed
one night, lights a lamp, and is delighted to see that she has been
sleeping with the most handsome of the gods. In her excitement she lets
a drop of hot oil fall upon his divine shoul- der. He awakes, berates
her for her curiosity, and leaves her in anger, not realizing that lack
of curiosity by a woman in such cases would demoralize society. Psyche
wanders over the earth disconsolate. Venus imprisons Cupid for
disobeying his mother, and complains to Jupiter that celestial
discipline is deteriorating. Jupiter sends Mercury to fetch Psyche, who
then becomes the abused slave of Venus. Cupid escapes from his confine-
ment, and begs Jove to grant him Psyche. The puzzled god, torn as usual
between opposing prayers, summons the Olympian deities to debate the
matter. He himself, susceptible to youthful male charms, sides with
Cupid; the complaisant gods vote to free Psyche, to make her a goddess,
and to give her to Cupid; and in the final scene they celebrate with an
ambrosial banquet</p>
<p>LEO</p>

<p>5 “</p>
<p>the nuptials of Cupid and Psyche. We are assured that the story is a
pious allegory, in which Psyche represents the human soul, which, when
purified by suffering, is admitted to paradise. But Raphael and Chigi
saw in the myth no religious symbolism, but a chance to contemplate
perfect male and female form s. Yet there is in Raphael’s sensualism a
refinement and grace</p>
<p>Never were pagan and Christian so agreeably merged as in Raphael.
This same worldly youth who lived like a prince and loved many women
tran- siently, and (if one may venture such an anomaly) frolicked on
ceilings with male and female nudes, painted in these same years ( 1 5 1
3-20) some of the most appealing pictures in the gamut of history. With
all his guileless sensualism he always returned to the Madonna as his
favorite theme; fifty times he pictured her. Sometimes a pupil helped
him, as in the Madonna deir Impannata; but for the most part he worked
on this type of painting with his own hand, and with a touch of the old
Umbrian piety. Now</p>

Piacenza: # a perfect pyramidal composition; the convincing realism of
the old martyr St. Sixtus; the demure St. Barbara, a bit too beautiful
and too splendidly gowned; the Virgin’s green robe, over a touch of red,
blown by heaven’s winds; the Child quite human in His disheveled
innocence; the simple rosy face of the Madonna, a little sad and
wondering (as if La For- narina, who may have posed for this picture,
realized her disqualifications) ; the curtains drawn aside by angels
behind the Virgin, admitting her to paradise: this is the favorite
picture of all Christendom, the most widely loved product of Raphael’s
hand. Almost as fine, and perhaps more moving despite its traditional
form, is The Holy Family under the Oak Tree</li>

Correggio’s Holy Night , Giorgione’s Venus , and some 920,000 other art
objects, it was taken from Germany by the victorious Russians after the
Second World War . 85</li>

timidly against her, as if he had heard some myth of massacred

<p>Raphael painted relatively few pictures of Christ. His buoyant
spirit</p>
<p>shrank from the contemplation or portrayal of suffering; or perhaps,
like Leonardo, he realized the impossibility of representing the divine.
In 1517, probably with the collaboration of Penni, he painted Christ
Bearing the Cross for the convent of Santa Maria dello Spasimo in
Palermo, whence the picture came to be called Lo Spasimo di Sicilia.
According to Vasari it had an adventurous career: the ship that carried
it to Sicily was lost in a storm; the crated painting floated safely
over the waters, and landed at Genoa; “even the fury of the winds and
waves,” said Vasari, “respected such paint - ing.” It was shipped again,
and was set up in Palermo, where “it became</p>
<p>To this crowded period belongs the St. Cecilia, almost as popular as
the Sistine Madonna. A Bolognese lady, in the fall of 1513, announced
that she had heard heavenly voices bidding her dedicate a chapel to
St. Cecilia in the church of San Giovanni del Monte. A relative
undertook to build the chapel, and asked his uncle Cardinal Lorenzo
Pucci to order from Raphael, for a thousand gold scudi, an appropriate
picture for the altar. Delegating to Giovanni da Udine the
representation of the musical instruments, Raphael finished the painting
in 1516, and sent it to Bologna, as we have seen, with a kindly letter
to Francia. We need not believe that Francia was mortally stricken by
its beauty to feel the splendor of the work, its sense of music as
something almost celestial, its St. Paul in a “brown study,” its
St. John in almost girlish ecstasy, its lovely Cecilia, its still
lovelier Magdalen — here transformed into charming innocence — and the
living lights and shadows on the drapery and on Magdalen’s feet.</p>
<p>Now, too, came some masterly portraits. The Baldassare Castiglione
(Louvre) is one of Raphael’s most conscientious efforts, endlessly
enticing, among his portraits second only to the Julius II. One sees
first the strange fluffy headdress, then the furry robe and profuse
beard, and imagines the man to be some Moslem poet or philosopher, or a
rabbi seen by Rembrandt; then the soft eyes and mouth and clasped hands
reveal the tender-minded,</p>

<p>sentimental, bereaved minister of Isabella at Leo’s court; one should
linger over this portrait before reading The Courtier. The Bibbiena
shows the Cardinal in his later years, tired of his Venuses and
reconciled to Chris- tianity.</p>
<p>La donna velata is not incontestably Raphael’s, yet it is almost
certainly the picture that Vasari describes as a portrait of Raphael’s
mistress. Her features are those that he used for the Magdalen, even the
Cecilia, of St. Cecilia, perhaps for the Sistine Madonna — here dark and
demure, a long veil falling from her head, a circlet of gems around her
neck, and lucious robes wrapped loosely about her form. Probably by
Raphael, but not so clearly representing his mistress as older views
claimed, is La Fomarina in the Bor- ghese Gallery. The word means a
woman baker, or a baker’s wife or</p>
<p>daughter; but such names, like Smith or Carpenter, prove nothing of
the bearer’s occupation. This lady is not especially attractive; one
misses in her the modest look that makes more charming such immodest
revelations.* It seems incredible that the modest V eiled Lady should be
the same person as this bold dispenser of hurried joys; but, after all,
Raphael had more mis- tresses than one.</p>
<p>Yet he was more faithful to his mistress than artists — who are more
sensi- tive to beauty than to reason — can be expected to be. When
Cardinal Bib- biena urged him to marr y Maria Bibbiena, the Cardinal’s
niece, Raphael, indebted to him for rich commissions, gave unwilling
consent (1514); but he delayed from month to month and from year to year
the keeping of this troth; and tradition relates that Maria, so
repeatedly put off, died of a broken heart. 87 Vasari suggests that
Raphael delayed in hope of being made a cardinal; to such an elevation
marriage was a major — a mistress a negligible — impediment. Meanwhile
the artist seems to have kept his mistress within close reach of
wherever he was working. When the distance between the Villa Chigi,
where Raphael was designing the History of Psyche, and his mistress’
dwelling led to much loss of time, the banker had the lady installed in
an apartment of the villa; “that,” says Vasari, “is why the work was
finished.” 88 We do not know if it was with this mistress that Raphael
in - dulged in the “unusually wild debauch” to which V asari ascribes
his death. 89</p>
<p>His last picture was one of his supreme interpretations of the Gospel
story. In 1517 Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici commissioned both Raphael and
Sebastiano del Piombo to paint altarpieces for the cathedral of Nar-
bonne, of which Francis I had made him bishop. Sebastiano had long felt

<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>that his talent was at least equal to Raphael’s though so much less
recog - nized; here was his chance to prove himself. He chose as subject
the raising of Lazarus, and secured the help of Michelangelo in making
his design. Spurred by the competition, Raphael rose to his final
triumph. He took for his theme Matthew’s account of the episode on Mt.
Tabor:</p>
<p>And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother,</p>
<p>and brought them up into a high mountain apart, and was transfig-</p>
<p>ured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment
was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and
Elias talking with him. . . . And when they returned to the</p>
<p>multitude there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him</p>
<p>and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and</p>
<p>sore vexed; for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into
the</p>
<p>water. And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not
cure</p>
<p>him . 90</p>
<p>Raphael took both of these scenes and united them, with excessive
strain on the unities of time arid place. Above the mountain top the
figure of Christ appears soaring in the air, His face transfigured with
ecstasy, His garments made shining white by light from heaven; on one
side of Him Moses, on the other Elias; and beneath them, lying on a
plateau, the three favored Apos- tles. At the foot of the mountain a
desperate father pushes forward his in- sane boy; the mother and another
woman, both of them classic in their beauty, kneel beside the boy and
beg a cure from the nine Apostles who are gathered at the left. One of
these is startled out of his concentration on a book; another points to
the transfigured Christ, and suggests that only He can cure the boy. It
is usual to praise the splendor of the upper part of the picture,
presumably finished by Raphael, and to deprecate a certain coarse- ness
and violence in the lower group, which was painted by Giulio Ro- mano;
but two of the finest figures are in the lower foreground — the dis-
turbed reader, and a kneeling woman with bare shoulder and gleaming
drapery.</p>
<p>Raphael began work on the Transfiguration in 1517, but had not
finished it when he died. We can not say how much truth there is in
Vasari’s ac - count, written some thirty years after the event:</p>
<p>Raphael continued his secret pleasures beyond all measure. After</p>
<p>an unusually wild debauch he returned home with a severe fever,</p>
<p>and the doctors believed him to have caught a chill. As he did
not</p>
<p>confess the cause of his disorder, the doctors imprudently let
blood,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>X515</p>
<p>CHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>thus enfeebling him when he needed restoratives. Accordingly he</p>
<p>made his will, first sending his mistress out of the house like a
Chris- tian, leaving her the means to live honestly. He then divided
his</p>
<p>things among his pupils, Giulio Romano, of whom he was always</p>
<p>very fond, Giovanni Francesco Penni of Florence, and some priest</p>
<p>of Urbino, a relation. . . . Having confessed and shown
penitence,</p>
<p>he finished the course of his life on the day of his birth, Good
Friday, at the age of thirty-seven (April 6, 1520). 91</p>
<p>The priest who had come to shrive him refused to enter the sick room
until Raphael’s mistress had left the house; perhaps the priest felt
that her continued presence would suggest on Raphael’s part a lack of
the contrition required before absolution. Driven away even from the
funeral cortege, she fell into a melancholy that threatened insanity;
and Cardinal Bibbiena per- suaded her to become a nun. All the artists
of Rome followed the dead youth to his grave. Leo mourned the loss of
his beloved painter; and a papal secretary and poet, the Bembo who could
be so eloquent in both Latin and Ital ian, put aside all rhetoric in
writing an epitaph for Raphael’s tomb in the Pantheon:</p>
<p>ILLE HIC EST RAPHAEL</p>
<p>—“He who is here is Raphael.” It was enough.</p>
<p>In the opinion of his contemporaries he was the greatest painter of
his age. He produced nothing equal in sublimity to the Sistine ceiling,
but Michelangelo produced nothing equal in total beauty to the fifty
Madonnas of Raphael. Michelangelo was the greater artist, because great
in three fields, and deeper in-thought and art. When he said of Rap
hael, “He is an example of what profound study can bring forth ,” 92 he
probably meant</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>516</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>As artist in the sense of technician, no one surpassed him; in the
arrange- ment of elements in a picture, the rhythm of masses, the smooth
flow of line, no one has equaled him. His life was a devotion to form.
Consequently he tended to remain on the surface of things. Except in his
portrait of Julius II, he did not probe into the mysteries or
contradictions of life or creed; Leo- nardo’s subtlety and
Michelangelo’s sense of tragedy were alike meaningless to him; the lust
and joy of life, the creation and possession of beauty, the loyalty of
friend and lover, were enough. Ruskin was right: there was now and then
in Gothic sculpture and the “Pre - Raphaelite” painting of Italy and
Flanders a simplicity, sincerity, and sublimity of faith and hope that
sink deeper into the soul than the pretty Madonnas and voluptuous
Venuses of Raphael. And yet the Julius II and the Pearl Madonna are
anything but superficial; they reach to the heart of male ambition and
female tenderness; the Julius is greater and profounder than the Mona
Lisa.</p>
<p>Leonardo puzzles us, Michelangelo frightens us, Raphael gives us
peace. He asks no questions, raises no doubts, evokes no terrors, but
offers us the loveliness of life like an ambrosial drink. He admits no
conflict between intellect and feeling, nor between body and soul;
everything in him is a harmony of opposites, making a Pythagorean music.
His art idealizes all that it touches: religion, woman, music,
philosophy, history, even war. Himself fortunate and happy, he radiated
serenity and grace. In the arbi- trary analogies of genius he finds his
place just below the greatest, but with them: Dante, Goethe, Keats;
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart; Michelangelo, Leo- nardo, Raphael.</p>
<p>X. LEO POLITICUS</p>
<p>It was a pity that amid all this art and literature Leo had to play
politics. But he was head of a state, and lived at a time when the
powers beyond the Alps had ambitious leaders, large armies, and lusty
generals; at any moment Louis XII of France and Ferdinand the Catholic
might agree to divide Italy as they had agreed to divide the Kingdom of
Naples. To meet these threats — and incidentally to strengthen the Papal
States and aggrandize his family — Leo planned to combine Florence
(which he already ruled through his brother Giuliano and his nephew
Lorenzo) with Milan, Piacenza, Parma, Modena, Ferrara, and Urbino into a
new and powerful federation to be ruled by loyal Medici; to unite these
with the existing States of the Church as a barrier to aggression from
the north; if possible, to secure by marriage, for some member of his
house, the succession to the throne of Naples; and,</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP, xvm)</p>
<p>with an Italy so welded into strength, to lead Europe in one more
crusade against the ever threatening Turks. Machiavelli, who had no
prejudice in favor of Christianity or the popes, warmly approved of this
plan, at least so far as concerned the unification and protection of
Italy; this was the leading idea of The Prince.</p>
<p>Pursuing these aims with very limited military means at his disposal,
Leo used all the methods of statecraft and diplomacy employed by the
princes of his day. It was inconvenient that the head of a Christian
Church should have to lie, break faith, steal, and kill; but by the
common consent of kings these procedures were indispensable to the
preservation of a state. Leo, a Medici first and a pope afterward,
played the game as well as his corpulence, his fistula, his hunts, his
liberalities, and his finances would allow. All the kings denounced him,
disappointed that he would not behave like a saint; “Leo,” said
Guicciardini, “deceived the expectations conceived of him at his
accession, since he appeared to be endowed with greater prudence, but
with much less goodness, than all had imagined.” 93 For a long time his
enemies thought that his Machiavellian subtlety was due to the influence
of his cousin Giulio (the future Clement VII), or to Cardinal Bibbiena;
but as events matured it became clear that they had to deal with Leo
himself, not a lion but a fox, suave and slippery, cunning and
incalculable, grasping and devious, sometimes frightened and often
hesitant, but, in the last resort, capable of decision, resolution, and
persistent policy.</p>
<p>Let us leave his relations with the transalpine states to a later
chapter, confine ourselves here to Italian affairs, and deal with these
summarily, for the art of Leo’s time is a much more living thing than
its politics. He had a great advantage over his predecessors, for
Florence, which had opposed Alexander and Julius, was now happy to be
part of his realm, since he gave its citizens many papal plums; and when
he visited the city of his ancestors it raised a dozen artistic arches
to welcome him. From that point cPappui, and from Rome, he deployed his
diplomats and patronage and troops to swell his state. In 1514 he
secured Modena. In 1515 Francis I prepared to invade Italy and take
Milan; Leo organized an army and an Italian alliance to resist him, and
ordered the Duke of Urbino, as a vassal of the Holy See and a general in
the service of the Church, to join him at Bologna with all the forces he
could muster. The Duke, Francesco Maria della Rovere, flatly refused to
come, though Leo had recently advanced him money to pay his troops. The
Pope with some reason suspected him of having a secret understanding
with France. 94 As soon as his hands were freed from foreign
entanglements, Leo summoned Francesco to Rome; the Duke in-</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>518</p>
<p>(chap, xvin</p>
<p>stead fled to Mantua. Leo excommunicated him, and listened unmoved to
the entreaties and messages of Elisabetta Gonzaga and Isabella d’Este,
aunt and mother-in-law of the reckless prince; papal troops took Urbino
un- resisted, Francesco was declared deposed, and Leo’s nephew Lorenzo
be - came Duke of Urbino (1516). A year later the people of the city
rose and expelled Lorenzo; Francesco organized an army and recaptured
his duchy; Leo was hard put to it to raise funds and forces to recapture
it in turn; he succeeded after eight months of war, but the cost
exhausted the papal treas- ury, and turned the good will of Italy
against the Pope and his grasping family.</p>
<p>Francis I took the opportunity to win the friendship of the Pope, and
proposed a marriage between Lorenzo, the restored Duke of Urbino, and M
adeleine de La Tour d’ Auvergne, who had a charming income of 10,000
crowns (25,000?) a year. Leo agreed; Lorenzo went to France (1518), like
an echo of Borgia, and brought back Madeleine and her dowry. A year
later she died in giving birth to a daughter Caterina, the future Queen
Cath- erine de Medicis of France; and shortly thereafter Lorenzo himself
died, allegedly of a sexual disease contracted in France. 95 Leo now
declared Ur- bino a papal state, and sent a legate to govern it.</p>
<p>During these complications he had had to bear with two bitter signs
of his political weakness and growing unpopularity. One of his generals,
Gianpaolo Baglioni, ruler of Perugia by papal grace, had gone over to
Francesco Maria, taking Perugia with him; Leo later lured Gianpaolo to
Rome with a safe-conduct, and had him put to death (1520). Baglioni had
shared also in a conspiracy, led by Alfonso Petrucci and other
cardinals, to assassinate the Pope (1517). These cardinals had made such
demands upon Leo as even his generosity could not meet; Petrucci,
moreover, raged be- cause his brother, with Leo’s connivance, had been
ousted from the govern - ment of Siena. He planned at first to kill Leo
with his own hand, but was persuaded instead to bribe Leo’s physician to
poison the Pope while treating his fistula. The plot was discovered; the
physician and Petrucci were exe- cuted, and several accomplice cardinals
were imprisoned and deposed; some were released on paying enormous
fines.</p>
<p>Leo’s need for money was now so uring his once happy reign. His gifts
to relatives, friends, artists, writers, and musicians, his lavish
maintenance of an unprecedented court, the insatiable demands of the new
St. Peter’s, the expense of the Urbino war and the preparation for a
crusade, were leading him to bankruptcy. His regular revenue of 420,000
ducats (,250,000?) a year from fees, annates, and tithes was completely
inadequate, and yet was</p>
<p>LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIII )</p>
<p>5*9</p>
<p>always more difficult to secure from a Europe resentful of
ecclesiastical collections flowing to Rome. To replenish his treasury
Leo created 1353 new and saleable offices, for which the appointees paid
a total of 889,000 ducats (1,112,500?). We must not be too virtuous
about this; most of the offices were sinecures whose modest toil could
be delegated to subordi- nates; the sums paid for these appointments
were in effect loans to the pa- pacy; the salaries, averaging ten per
cent per year on the initial payment, were interest on the loans; Leo
was selling what we would now designate as government bonds; 0 “ and he
would doubtless have urged that he paid a much handsomer return than
governments pay today. However, he sold not only these sinecures, but
even the highest offices, like that of papal chamberlain. 97 In July, 1
5 1 7, he named thirty-one new cardinals, many of them men of ability,
but most of them chosen frankly for their capacity to pay for the honor
and power. So Cardinal Ponzetti — physician, scholar, author — paid
30,000 ducats; alto gether Leo’s pen on this occasion brought half a
million ducats into the treasury. 98 Even blas£ Italy was shocked; and
in Germany the story of the transaction shared in the anger of Luther’s
revolt (October, 1517). When, in this momentous year, Sultan Selim con-
quered Egypt for the Ottoman Turks, Leo appealed in vain for a crusade.
In his blind eagerness he sent agents throughout Christendom to offer
ex- traordinary indulgences in return for contrition, confession, and
contribu- tion to the expenses of the proposed crusade.</p>
<p>Sometimes he borrowed money at forty per cent from the bankers of
Rome, who charged him such rates because they feared that his careless
administration of papal finances would ensure bankruptcy. As security
for some of these loans be pledged his silver plate, his tapestries, his
jewels. He rarely thought of economizing, and when he did it was by
defaulting on the salaries of his Greek Academy and the University of
Rome; as early as 1 5 1 7 the former was closed for lack of funds. He
continued his intemperate benevolence, sending rich subsidies to
monasteries, hospitals, and charitable institutions throughout
Christendom, heaping dignities and funds upon the Medici, and feeding
his guests Lucullanly while himself eating and drinking in moderation.
99 All in all he spent during his pontificate 4,500,000 ducats
(6,250,000?), and died owing 400,000 more. A pasquinade expressed the
opinion of Rome: “Leo has eaten up three pontificates: the treasury of
Julius II, the reve nues of Leo, and those of his successor.” 100 When
he died Rome experienced one of the worst financial crashes in its
history.</p>
<p>His final year was rife with war. Having regained Urbino and Perugia,
it seemed to him that control of Ferrara and the Po was indispensable to
the</p>
<p>520</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVIII</p>
<p>security of the Papal States, and their capacity to check France at
Milan. Duke Alfonso had given the requisite casus belli by sending
troops and artillery to Francesco Maria for use against the Pope.
Alfonso, though ill, and well-nigh exhausted after a generation of papal
hostility, fought on with his usual courage, and was saved by Leo’s
death.</p>
<p>The Pope too was ill in August, 1521, partly from the pain of his
fistula, partly from the worries and excitement of war. He recovered,
but fell sick again in October. In November he was well enough to be
taken out to his country villa at Magliana. There the news reached him
that the papal- imperial army had captured Milan from the French. On the
25th he re- turned to Rome, and was given the wild reception accorded
only to victors in war. He walked too much that day, perspiring till his
clothes were drenched. The next morning he was put to bed with fever.
Now he</p>
<p>rapidly grew worse, and realized that his end was near. On December 1
he was cheered by intelligence that Piacenza and Parma had in their turn
been taken by the papal forces; once he had declared that he would
gladly give his life for the addition of those cities to the States of
the Church. At midnight, December 1-2, 1521, he died, ten days before
completing his forty-fifth year. Many of the attendants, and some
members of the Medici family, carried off from the Vatican everything
they could lay their hands on. Guicciardini, Giovio, and Castiglione
thought that he had been poi- soned, perhaps at the instigation of
Alfonso or Francesco Maria; but ap- parently he died of malarial fever,
like Alexander VI. 101</p>
<p>Alfonso rejoiced at the news, and struck a new medal ex ore
leonis,</p>
<p>“from the jaws of the lion.” Francesco Maria returned to Urbino, and
was once more restored to his throne. In Rome the bankers despoiled
them- selves. The Bini firm had lent Leo 200,000 ducats, the Gaddi
32,000, the Ricasoli 10,000; moreover, Cardinal Pucci had lent him
150,000, and Car- dinal Salviati 8o,ooo; 102 the cardinals would have
first claim on anything salvaged; and Leo had died worse than bankrupt.
Some others joined in condemning the dead Pope as a maladministrator of
great wealth. But nearly all Rome mourned him as the most generous
benefactor in its his- tory. Artists, poets, and scholars knew that the
heyday of their good fortune had passed, though they had no suspicion
yet of the extent of their disaster. Said Paolo Giovio: “Kn owledge,
art, the common well-being, the joy of living — in a word, all good
things — have gone down into the grave with Leo.” 103</p>
<p>He was a good man ruined by his virtues. Erasmus had rightly praised
his kindness and humanity, his magnanimity and learning, his love and
LEO</p>
<p>XCHAP. XVIIl)</p>
<p>5 21</p>
<p>support of the arts, and had called Leo’s pontificate an age of gold
. 104 But Leo was too habituated to gold. Raised in a palace, he learned
luxury as well as art; he never labored for his income, though he faced
perils bravely; and when the revenues of the papacy were placed in his
trust they slipped through his careless fingers while he basked in the
happiness of recipients, or planned expensive wars. Proceeding on the
lines laid down by Alexander and Julius, and inheriting their
achievements, he made the Papal States stronger than ever, but he lost
Germany by his extravagance and his ex- actions. He could see the beauty
of a vase, but not the Protestant Reforma- tion taking shape beyond the
Alps; he paid no attention to a hundred warnings sent him, but asked for
more gold from a nation already in revolt. He was a glory and a disaster
to the Church.</p>
<p>He was the most generous, but not the most enlightened, of patrons.
With all his patronage no great literature arose in his reign. Ariosto
and Machiavelli were beyond him, though he could appreciate Bembo and
Politian. His taste in art was not as sure and lordly as that of Julius;
it was not to him that we owe St. Peter’s or The School of Ath ens. He
loved beautiful form too much, too little the revealing significance
that great art clothes in beautiful form. He overworked Raphael,
underestimated Leo- nardo, and could not, like Julius, find a way
through Michelangelo’s temper to his genius. He liked comfort too much
to be great. It is a pity to judge him so harshly, for he was
lovable.</p>
<p>The age received his name, and perhaps rightly; for though he rather
took than gave its stamp, it was he who brought from Florence to Rome
the Medicean heritage of wealth and taste, the princely patronage that
he had seen in his father’s house; and with that wealth, and papal
sanction, he pro - vided an exciting stimulus to such literature and art
as excelled in style and form. His example stirred a hundred other men
to seek out talent, support it, and set northern Europe a precedent and
standard of apprecation and worth. He more than any other pope protected
the remains of classic Rome, and encouraged men to rival them. He
accepted the pagan enjoy- ment of life, and yet, in his own conduct,
remained remarkably continent in an uninhibited age. His support of the
Roman humanists helped to spread into France their cultivation of
classic literature and form. Under his aegis Rome became the throbbing
heart of European culture; thither the artists flocked to paint or carve
or build, the scholars came to study, the poets to sing, the men of wit
to sparkle. “Before I forget thee, Rome,” wrote Erasmus, “I must plunge
into the river of Lethe. . . . What pr ecious freedom, what treasures in
the way of books, what depths of knowledge</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>(chap. XVIII</p>
<p>among the learned, what beneficial social intercourse! Where else
could one find such literary society, or such versatility of talent in
one and the same place ?” 105 The gentle Castiglione, the polished
Bembo, the learned Lascaris, Fra Giocondo, Raphael, the Sansovini and
Sangalli, Sebastiano and Michelangelo — where shall we find again, in
one city and decade, such a company?</p>
