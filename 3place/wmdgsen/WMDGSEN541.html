Flower</h4>
<p>1775-1805</p>
<p>I. WIELAND SEQUEL: 1775-1813</p>
<p>M OZART, seeing Wieland at Mannheim in 1777, described his face as
“frightfully ugly, covered with pockmarks, and he had a long nose;</p>
<p>… aside from that he is… a most gifted fellow…. People stare at</p>
<p>him as if he had dropped from heaven.” 1 The stormy petrels of Sturm
und Drang disliked him because he laughed at their rebel ecstasies, but
Weimar liked him because he sweetened his satires with grace and a
general absolu- tion for mankind, and because he bore with good humor
the repeated irrup- tion of new stars in the literary sky where he could
have claimed priority. Goethe’s autobiography commemorated him
gratefully. 2 Schiller at first encounter thought him vain and
melancholy; but “the footing on which he at once placed himself toward
me shows confidence, love, and esteem.” 3 “We will shortly open our
hearts to each other,” said the older to the younger poet; “we will
assist each other in turn”; 4 and he proved faithful to this promise.
“Wieland and I draw daily closer together…. He never omits an occasion
for saying a kind word.” 5</p>
<p>Wieland competed successfully with the newcomers by issuing in 1780 a
poetic romance, Oberon, about a knight who is rescued from a hundred
fairies, and from the quagmire charms of an overheated queen, by the
magic wand of the prince of fairies. When Goethe had to sit for a
portrait, and wished to remain quiet for an hour, he asked Wieland to
read parts of the epic to him. “Never,” Wieland reported, “have I seen
anyone so happy over the work of another as Goethe was.” 6 John Quincy
Adams translated the poem while he was United States minister to Prussia
in 1797-1801, and James Planche took from it the libretto for Weber’s
opera (1826).</p>
<p>The March, 1798, number of Wieland’s Neue teutsche Merkur
contained</p>
<p>On January 25, 1813, Goethe wrote in his diary, “Wieland buried
today,” and sent the news to a friend at Karlsbad: “Our good Wieland has
left us.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>… On September 3 we still quite festively celebrated his eightieth
birth- day. There was a beautiful balance of tranquillity and activity
in his life. With a remarkable deliberateness, without any impassioned
striving or cry- ing, he contributed an infinite amount to the
intellectual culture of the na- tion.” 8</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>HERDER AND HISTORY: 1777-1803</li>
</ol>
<p>“I have just left Herder,” Schiller wrote in July, 1787. “… His
conver - sation is brilliant, his language warm and powerful; but his
feelings are swayed by love and hate.” 9</p>
<p>Herder’s duties at Weimar were multifarious, and allowed him little
time for writing. As chaplain to the Duke he performed the baptisms,
confirma- tions, marriages, and funerals of the ducal family and the
court. As General- superintendent of the duchy he supervised clerical
conduct and appoint- ments, attended consistory meetings, and preached
sermons as orthodox as his private doubts would permit. The schools of
the duchy were under his management, and became a model for all Germany.
These responsibilities, added to his fistula and general ill-health,
made him irritable, and gave his conversation, now and then, what Goethe
called a “vicious bite.” 10 For three</p>
<p>Amid his administrative chores Herder pursued primitive poetry, gath-
ered specimens from a dozen nations, and from Orpheus to Ossian, and
pub- lished them in an anthology, Volkslieder (1778), which became a
fountain- head of the Romantic movement in Germany. While Goethe was
preparing a return to classical ideals, forms, and styles, and to
restraint of emotion by intellect, Herder counseled a reaction against
eighteenth-century rationalism and seventeenth-century formalism to
medieval faith, legends, lays, and ways.</p>
<p>In 1778 the Bavarian Academy offered a prize for the best essay “On
the Effects of Poetry upon the Customs an d Morals of the Nations.”
Herder’s contribution was crowned, and was published by the Academy in
1781. It</p>
<p>578</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>raced what the author considered the deterioration of poetry, among
the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the North Europeans, from an early bardic
ex- pression of popular history, feelings, and ideas, in free and
flowing rhythms, into a “refined” and scholastic exercise, counting
syllables, wrenching rhymes, venerating rules, and losing the vitality
of the people in the deaden- ing artificialities of city life. The
Renaissance, Herder held, had taken liter- ature away from the people
and imprisoned it in courts, and printing had replaced the living
minstrel with the book. In anot her essay, “On the Spirit of Hebrew
Poetry” (1783), Herder, who had made himself a good Hebra - ist,
proposed that the Book of Genesis should be read as poetry, not as sci-
ence; and he suggested that such poetry could convey as much truth
through symbo lism as science does through “fact.”</p>
<p>His religious faith struggled to maintain itself despite his wide
reading in science and history. In his first year at Weimar he was
suspected of being an atheist, a freethinker, a Socinian, an
“enthusiast” (mystic). 18 He had read the Wolfenbiittel Fragments of
Reimarus as published by Lessing, and was suf- ficiently impressed to
doubt the divinity of Christ. 19 He was not an atheist, but he accepted
Spinoza’s pantheism. He told Jacobi in 1784, “I do not rec - og nize an
extramundane God.” 20 He followed Lessing in studying and de - fending
Spinoza; “I must confess that this philosophy makes me very happy.” 21
He devoted to Spinoza the opening chapters of Gott, einige Ge - sprache
(God, Some Conversations, 1787); in this treatise God lost personal form
and became the energy and spirit of the universe, unknowable except in
the order of the world and the spiritual consciousness of man. 22
However, in tracts addressed to the clergy Herder accepted the
supernatural quality of Christ’s miracles, and the immortality of the
soul. 23</p>
<p>He brought the scattered elements of his philosophy into a
comparatively ordered whole in a massive masterpiece which he modestly
entitled ldeen zur Philosophic der Geschichte der Menschheit ( Ideas for
a Philosophy of the History of Mankind), one of the epochal, seminal
books of the eight- eenth century. It appeared in four parts in 1784,
1785, 1787, and 1791. That so vast an undertaking should have neared
completion amid Herder’s official responsibilities is evidence of a
strong character and a good wife. So Herder wrote to Hamann, May 10,
1784: “In my whole life I have not written any work with so many
troubles and exhaustions from within, and so many dis- turbances from
without, as I have this one; so that if my wife, who is the real autor
autoris [author of the author] of my writings — and Goethe, who
accidentally got to see Book I — had not incessantly encouraged me and
urged me on, everything would have remained in the Hades of the un-
born.” 24</p>
<p>Part I begins with a frankly secular story of “creation,” based on
current astronomy and geology, and making no use of the Bible except as
poetry. Life did not evolve from matter, for matter itself is alive.
Body and mind are not separate and opposed substances, they are two
forms of one force, and every cell in every organism contains, in some
degree, both forms. There is no external design visible in nature, but
there is an internal design — the mys-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>erious and “perfect determination” of each seed to develop into a
specific organism with all its own complex and characteristic parts.
Herder does not derive man from lower animals, but he sees him as a
member of the animal kingdom, fighting like other organisms for
sustenance and survival. Man be- came man by taking erect stature, which
developed in him a sensory system based upon sight and hearing rather
than upon smell and taste; forefeet be- came hands, free for grasping,
mam pulation, comprehension, thought. The highest product of God or
nature is the conscious mind acting with reason and freedom, and
destined to immortality.</p>
<p>Part II of the Ideen starts with the assumption that man is by nature
good; it renews the argument for the relative excellence and happiness
of primitive societies, and deprecates the Kantian — later Hegelian —
notion that the state is the goal of human development. Herder despised
the state as he knew it. “In great states,” he wrote, “hundreds must go
hungry so that one can strut and wallow in luxury; tens of thousands are
oppressed and driven to death so that one crowned fool or wise man can
carry out his fancy.” 25</p>
<p>In Part III Herder praised Athens for its comparative democracy,
which allowed culture to spread into many strata of the population.
Rome, building its wealth on conquest and slavery, developed a narrow
culture that left the people in poverty and ignorance. In all this
history Herder saw no Provi- dence; it was too evil to be divine. God,
being one with nature, lets matters take their course according to
natural law and human stupidity. Neverthe- less, by the very struggle
for existence, some progress emerges from the chaos; mutual aid, social
order, morals, and law are developed as means of survival, and man moves
slowly toward a humane humanity. Not that there is a continuous line of
progress; this cannot be, for each national culture is a unique entity,
with its own inherent character, its own language, religion, moral code,
literature, and art; and, like any organism, each culture, barring
accidents, tends to grow to its natural maximum, after which it declines
and dies. There is no guarantee that later cultures will excel earlier
ones, but the contributions of each culture are better transmitted to
its successors, and so the human heritage grows.</p>
<p>Part IV lauds Christianity as the mother of Western civilization. The
me- dieval papacy served a good purpose in checking the despotism of
rulers and the individualism of states; the Scholastic philosophers,
though they wove meaningless webs with ponderous words, sharpened the
terms and tools of reason; and the medieval universities gathered,
preserved, and transmitted much of Greek and Roman culture, something
even of Arabic and Persian science and philosophy. So the intellectual
community grew too numerous and subtle for the custodians of power; the
cake of custom was broken, and the modern mind declared itself free.</p>
<p>Between the third and fourth installments of the Ideen Herder
realized his long-deferred hope of seeing Italy. Johann Friedrich Hugo
von Dalberg, Catholic privy councilor to the Archbishop-Elector of
Trier, invited Her- der to accompany him on a grand tour, all expenses
paid. The Duke of Saxe- Weimar — and Caroline — gave him leave of
absence, and Herder left Weimar</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>August 7, 1788. When he joined Dalberg in Augsburg he found that Dal-
berg’s mistress was an important member of the party. Her presence and
her demands shared with ill-health in souring the trip for Herder. In
October Anna Amalie arrived in Rome; Herder left Dalberg and joined her
entour- age. He liked Angelica Kauffmann too much for Caroline’s liking,
and Caro - line’s letters spoke too often and fondly of Goethe. Herder,
having heard of Goethe’s life in Rome, resumed his bite: “My journey
here,” he wrote, “has unfortunately made Goethe’s selfish existence,
which is inwardly altogether</p>
<p>He returned to Weimar July 9, 1789. Five days later the Bastille
fell, and Herder changed his writing plans. He completed Part IV of the
Ideen, then put the book aside, and, instead, wrote Brief e zur
Beforderung der Humani- tdt ( Letters for the Advancement of Humanity ,
1793-97). He began with cautiously approving the French Revolution; he
welcomed the collapse of French feudalism, and shed no tears over the
secularization of the Catholic Church in France. 27 When the Duke and
Goethe went off to face the French at Valmy, and came back sore with
defeat. Herder suppressed those early Brief e, and devoted the remainder
to praise of geniuses safely dead.</p>
<p>In his old age he lost none of his relish for intellectual combat. He
coun- tered Kant’s criticism of the Ideen with an incisive attack upon
the Critique of Pure Reason. He called that book a monstrous jugglery of
words with metaphysical phantoms, like “synthetic judgments a priori”;
he denied the</p>
<p>Goethe largely agreed wit h Herder’s criticism of Kant, but this did
not protect him from an occasional bite. When the two were staying under
the same roof at Jena in 1803 Goethe read, to a gathering that included
Herder, some parts of his new drama, Die natiirliche Tochter. Herder
praised the play to others, but when the author asked for his opinion he
could not resist a pun about the boy that Goethe’s mistress had borne
him: “I like your natu - ral son better than your Natural Daughter.”
Goethe did not appreciate the wit. The two men never saw each other
again. Herder retired into the seclu- sion of his Weimar home, and died
there December 18, 1803 — two years be- fore Schiller, ten before
Wieland, twenty-nine before Goethe. Duke Karl August, who had often been
offended by him, had him buried with high honors in the Church of Sts.
Peter and Paul.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>GOETHE COUNCILOR: 1 775-86</li>
</ol>
<p>Goethe was welcomed to Weimar by all but the politicians. “I must
tell you,” wrote Wieland to Lavater, November 13, 1775, “that Goethe has
been</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>5 8l</p>
<p>with us since Tuesday last, and that within three days I have
conceived so deep an affection for this magnificent person — I so
thoroughly see into him, feel and understand him — as you can far better
imagine than I can de- scribe.” 28 In that same month a member of the
court wrote to Goethe’s par - ents: “Conceive of your son as the most
intimate friend of our dear Duke,</p>
<p>… loved to adoration, too, by all the goo d ladies hereabout.” 29</p>
<p>But there were clouds. The Duke relished wild hunts and drinking;
Goethe at first accompanied him in both; Klopstock publicly charged the
poet with corrupting a virtuous prince. Luise feared that Goethe would
alienate her husband from her; actually he used his influence to bring
the Duke back to the Duchess despite the fact that the marriage had not
been one of love. Some officials distrusted Goethe as a Sturm und Drang
radical with pagan beliefs and romantic dreams. Several gladiators of
that movement — Lenz, Klinger, and more — rushed to Weimar, introduced
themselves as Goethe’s friends, and clamored for plums. When Goethe took
a fancy to a garden house — outside the city gate but near the ducal
castle — Karl August lost Goethe some public good will by evicting the
tenants so that Goethe might move in (April 21, 1776). There the poet
found relief from court etiquette, and learned to grow vegetables and
flowers. For three years he lived there all the year round, then only in
the summer till 1782, when he moved to a spacious mansion in the town to
attend to his mounting duties as a member of the government.</p>
<p>The Duke had thought of him as a poet, and had invited him to Weimar
as a literary ornament to his court. But he perceived that the
twenty-six- year-old author of a rebel play and a tearful romance was
becoming a man of practical judgment. He appointed Goethe to a Bureau of
Works, and asked him to look into the condition and operation of the
mines at Ilmenau. Goethe did this with such assiduity and intelligence
that Karl August deter- mined to add him to the Privy Council that
administered the duchy. A sen- ior member protested against this sudden
infusion of poetry, and threatened to resign. The Duke and the Dowager
appeased him, and on June 1 1, 1776, Goethe became Geheimer Legationsr
at — privy councilor of legation — at an annual salary of twelve hundred
thalers. He reduced his attentions to the ladies. “For long now,”
Wieland informed Merck on June 24, “from the moment that he decided to
devote himself to the Duke and the Duke’s af -</p>
<p>fairs, he has behaved with faultless wisdom and with worldly
circumspec- tion.” 30 In 1778 Goethe was advanced to the then peaceful
post of minister of war, and in 1799 to full membership in the Privy
Council. He attempted some reforms, but found himself thwarted by vested
interests at the top and public apathy below; soon he himself was a
complete conservative. In 1781 he was made president of the Ducal
Chamber. In 1782 he was given by Jo- seph II a patent of nobility, and
became von Goethe. “In those days,” he told Eckermann forty- five years
later, “I felt so satisfied with myself that if I had</p>
<p>been made a prince I should not have thought the change so very
remark- able.” 31</p>
<p>Interwoven with his political career was the most lasting, intense,
and</p>
<p>582 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XXIII</p>
<p>poignant love affair in his life. Hear Dr. Johann Zimmermann’ s quite
un- medical description of one of his patients in November, 1775:</p>
<p>The Baroness von Stein, wife of the Chamberlain and Master of the
Horse, has extraordinarily large black eyes of the highest beauty. Her
voice is gentle and repressed. No one can fail to mark on her face…
seriousness, gentleness, kindliness,… virtue, and profound sensibility.
The manners of the court, which she possesses to perfection, have been
transformed in her case into rare and high simplicity. She is very
pious, with a touching and almost ecstatic ele- vation of soul. From her
exquisite carriage and her almost professional skill in dancing one
would hardly infer the tranquil moonlight… which fills her heart with
peace. She is thirty-three years old. She has several children, and weak
nerves. Her cheeks are red, her hair quite black, her complexion… of an
Italian hue. 32</p>
<p>Born in 1742, Charlotte von Schardt had married Baron Josias Gottlob
von Stein in 1764. By 1772 she had borne seven children, of whom four
were now dead. When Goethe met her she was still ailing from repeated
pregnan- cies, and her sense of frailty entered into the modesty and
diffidence of her character. Goethe idealized her, for he had the blood
of a youth and the imagination of a poet, accustomed and commissioned to
embellish reality, yet he did not exceed her physician in glorifying
her. She was something new in his rosary of women: she was an
aristocrat, in whom fine manners seemed inborn, and Goethe saw her as
enshrined in nobility. It was one re- sult of their relationship that
she transmitted to him the manners of her class, and schooled him in
self-possession, ease, moderation, and courtesy. She was grateful for
his love as restoring her interest in life, but she accepted it as a
woman of breeding receives the adoration of a youth seven years younger
than herself — as the growth pains of an eager spirit seeking experi-
ence and fulfillment.</p>
<p>It was not love at first sight; six weeks after joining the Weimar
circle he was still writing verses about “lovely Lili” Schonemann. 33
But on December</p>
<p>She wrote many letters in return, but from this first period only one
sur- vives. “I had so detached myself from the world, but now it grows
dear to me again, dear through you. My heart reproaches me; I feel that
I torment both myself and you. Six months ago I was so ready to die, and
I am ready no longer.” 35 He was in ecstasy. “There is no explanation
for what this woman does to me,” he told Wieland, “… unless you accept
the theory of transmigration. Oh, yes, once we were man and wife!” 36 He
took the matrimonial privilege of quarreling and making up. Charlotte to
Zimmer- mann, May, 1776: “He stormed away fr om me a week ago, and then

<p>urned with overflowing love…. What will he end by making of me?” 37
Apparently she insisted upon their love remaining Platonic, and he was
too passionate to leave it so. “If I am not to live with you,” he told
her, “your love avails me no more than that of others who are absent.”
38 But on the</p>
<p>alone.” 39</p>
<p>He was desolate when she went to far-north Pyrmont for a cure, but
when she returned she visited him at Ilmenau (August 5-6, 1776). On Au-
gust 8 he wrote: “Your presence has had a wondrous effect upon me…. When
I think that you were here in my cave with me, and that I held your
hand, while you leaned over me… Your relationship to me is both sacred
and strange…. There are no words for it, and the eyes of men cannot
perceive it.” 40 Almost five years after their first meeting he was
still warm. S o, on September 12, 1780, lonely in Zillbach: “Whenever I
awake from my dreams, I find that I still love you and long for you.
Tonight, as we were riding along and saw the lit windows of a house
ahead, I thought: If only she were there to be our hostess. This is a
rotten hole, and yet, if I could live quietly here all winter long with
you, I’d like it very well.” 41 And on March 12, 1781:</p>
<p>My soul has so grown into yours that, as you know, I am inseparably
tied to you, and neither height nor depth can part us. I wish there were
some vow or sacrament which would bind me to you visibly and according
to some law. How precious that would be! And surely my novitiate was
long enough for me to take all due thought… The Jews have cords which
they bind about their arms in the act of prayer. Thus I bind about my
arm your dear cord when I address my prayer to you, and desire you to
impart to me your goodness, wis- dom, moderation, and patience.</p>
<p>Some have interpret ed the expired “novitiate,” or period of
probation, as indicating Charlotte’s physical surrender; 42 and yet he
wrote to her, six years later: “Dear Lotte, you do not know what
violence I have done to myself, and still do, and how the thought that I
do not possess you… ex- hausts and consumes me.” 43 If consummation came
the secret was well kept. Baron von Stein, who did not die till 1793,
bore with the liaison with the courtesy of an eighteenth-century
gentleman. Occasionally Goethe ended his l etters with “Regards to
Stein.” 44</p>
<p>He had learned to love her children too, feeling more and more keenly
the lack of his own. In the spring of 1783 he persuaded her to allow her
ten- year-old boy, Fritz, to stay with him for extended visits, even to
accompany him on long trips. One of her letters to Fritz (September,
1783) shows her maternal side, and the human hearts behind the
dehumanized fa9ade of his- tory:</p>
<p>I am so glad that you don’t forget me out in the beautiful world, and
that you write me in tolerably, though not very well- formed, letters.
Since you’re staying much longer than I expected, I’m afraid that your
clothes won’t be looking very well. If they get soiled, and you too,
tell Privy Councilor Goethe just to throw my dear little Fritz into the
water…. Try to appreciate your good luck, and do your best to please the
Councilor by your behavior. Your father wishes to be remembered to you.

<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>B y 1785 Goethe’s passion had subsided into long silences. In May,
1786, Charlotte complained that “Goethe thinks a great deal and says
nothing.” 46 She was now forty-four, he was thirty-seven, and was
retiring into himself. Often he went to Jena to get away from the Weimar
court and seek reju- venation among students. He had always refreshed
himself with nature, climbing the Brocken (a 3,747-foot peak in the Harz
Mountains, long asso- ciated with the Faust legend), and traveling with
the Duke in Switzerland (September, 1779, to January, 1780). Sometimes,
in retrospect, he felt that “during the first ten years of my official
and court life at Weimar I scarcely accomplished anything” 47 in the way
of literature or science. But it was good that the poet had been crossed
with the administrator, and that the half- spoiled youth and faithless
lover had been disciplined by the responsibilities of office and the
deferment of amorous victory. He made use of every experi- ence, and
grew with every defeat. “The best thing about me is that deep inner
stillness in which I live and grow, despite the world, and through which
I gain what the world can never take fronj me.” 48 Nothing was lost on
him; everything found expression somewhere in his works; finally he was
all the best of intellectual Germany fused into an integrated whole.</p>
<p>Two of his greatest poems belong to this period: the marriage of
philos- ophy and religion, poetry and prose, in Die Natur-, and the most
perfect of his lyrics — the second of those called “Wanderers
Nachtlied”— which he carved on the walls of a hunting lodge on September
7, 1780, 49 perhaps in a mood of restless longing:</p>
<p>jber alien Gipfeln</p>
<p>1st Ruh;</p>
<p>In alien Wipfeln</p>
<p>Sparest du</p>
<p>Kaum einen Hauch;</p>
<p>Die Vogelein schnveigen im W aide.</p>
<p>W arte nur! Balde</p>
<p>Ruhest du auch.</p>
<p>O’er all the hilltops</p>
<p>Is quiet now;</p>
<p>In all the treetops</p>
<p>Hearest thou</p>
<p>Hardly a breath;</p>
<p>The birds are asleep in the trees.</p>
<p>Wait: soon like these</p>
<p>Thou too shalt rest. 50</p>
<p>Another of Goethe’s famous lyrics belongs to this stage of his
development: the somber “Erlkonig” which Schubert put to music. When has
the child’s sense of mystic beings pervading nature been more vividly
expressed than in t his swift fantasy of the dying child who sees the
“king of the elves” com - ing to snatch it from the arms of its
father?</p>
<p>Now, too, Goethe wrote in prose three dramas: Egmont (1775), Iphige-
nie auf Tauris (1779), and Torquato Tasso (1780) — fruit enough for five
political years. Egmont was not produced till 1788. Iphigenie was
presented at the Weimar theater on April 6, 1779 (six weeks before the
premiere of Gluck’s opera of the same name) ; but it was so transformed,
as well as versi - fied, during G oethe’s stay in Rome that it will be
better viewed as a product of Goethe’s classic phase. Tasso also was
remodeled and versified in Italy, but it belongs here as part of
Goethe’s enchantment with Charlotte von Stein. On April 19, 1781, he
wrote to her: “All that Tasso says is addressed to you.” 51 Taking him
at his word, she identified herself with Leonora, Goethe with Tasso, and
Karl August with the Duke of Ferrara.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>585</p>
<p>Goethe readily accepted the legend that Tasso’s mental breakdown at
the Ferrara court was intensified, if not brought on, by an unhappy love
affair with a sister of Alfonso II (r. 1559-97) 52 He doubtless had
himself in mind when he described the workin g of Tasso’s poetic
mind:</p>
<p>His eye scarce lingers on this earthly scene;</p>
<p>To nature’s harmony his ear is tuned.</p>
<p>What history offers, and what life presents,</p>
<p>His bosom promptly and with joy receives.</p>
<p>The widely scattered is by him combined,</p>
<p>And his quick feeling animates the dead….</p>
<p>Thus, moving in his own enchanted sphere,</p>
<p>The wondrous man doth still allure us on</p>
<p>To wander with him and partake his joy.</p>
<p>Though seeming to approach us, he remains</p>
<p>Remote as ever; and perchance his eye,</p>
<p>Resting on us, sees spirits in our place. 53</p>
<p>And Leonora, the stately princess who accepts the poet’s love but
bids him restrain his ardor within protocol, may well be Charlotte von
Stein holding Goethe’s passion this side of adultery. Tasso proclaims—
and here both poets speak —</p>
<p>Whatever in my song doth reach the heart</p>
<p>And find an echo there, I owe to one,</p>
<p>And one alone! No image undefined</p>
<p>Hovered before my soul, approaching now</p>
<p>In radiant glory, to retire again.</p>
<p>I have myself, with mine own eyes, beheld</p>
<p>The type of every virtue, every grace. 54</p>
<p>Duke Alfonso resembles Karl August in patience with the poet’s
tantrums, amours, and reveries, and, like him, mourns the poet’s delay
in finishing a promised masterpiece:</p>
<p>After each slow advance he leaves his task;</p>
<p>He ever changeth, and can ne’er conclude 55 —</p>
<p>which well describes Goethe’s piecemeal composition, and his
procrastina - tion with Wilhelm Meister and Faust. Another princess
praises Alfonso — Karl August for giving Tasso-Goethe a chance to mature
by contact with affairs: and here rise famous lines:</p>
<p>Es bildet ein Talent sich in der Stille;</p>
<p>Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt.</p>
<p>“Talent forms itself in quiet; character takes form in the stream of

<p>He often thought of Italy as an escape from a situation that
threatened his mind. About this time, in the first form of Wilhelm
Meister, he com-</p>
<p>5^6 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>posed for Mignon a song of longing that fitted his own hopes rather
than Mignon’s:</p>
<p>Kennst du das Land , wo die Zitronen bliihn ,</p>
<p>Im dunken Laub die Gold-Orangen gliihn ,</p>
<p>Ein sanfter Wind vom blauen Himmel weht,</p>
<p>Die Myrte still und hoch der Lorbeer steht:</p>
<p>Kennst du es wohl? Dahin! Dahinl</p>
<p>Mocht ich mit dir , O mein Geliebte , ziehn!*</p>
<p>Weimar was beautiful, but it was not warm. And the cares of office
rasped the poet’s soul; “ ’tis a bitter way of earning one’s bread to
have to try to es - tablish harmony among the discords of the world.” 57
Court life wearied him; “I have nothing in common with these people, nor
they with me.” 58 He had been partly estranged from the Duke, unable to
keep the ducal pace of hunt- ing and wenching. His one great love had
been worn thin by time and quar- rels. He felt that he had to break away
from these many bonds, to seek a new orientation and perspective. He
asked the Duke for a leave of absence. The Duke consented, and agreed to
continue Goethe’s salary. To raise ad - ditional funds Goethe sold to
Goschen of Leipzig the right to publish an edi- tion of his collected
works. Only 602 sets were bought; Goschen lost 1,720 thalers in the
enterprise.</p>
<p>On September 1, 1786, Goethe wrote to Charlotte from Karlsbad:</p>
<p>Now a final farewell. I want to repeat to you that I love you dearly…
and that your assurance that you are again taking pleasure in my love
renews the joy of my life. I have borne much in silence hitherto, but I
have desired noth- ing more intensely than that our relationship might
take a form over which no circumstance could have power. If that cannot
be, I would not dwell where you are, but rather be alone in that world
into which I now go forth. 59</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>GOETHE IN ITALY: 1 786-88</li>
</ol>
<p>He traveled under a pseudonym, “M. Jean - Philippe Moller,” for
he</p>
<p>wished to be freed from the inconveniences of fame. He was
thirty-seven years old, but he came with even more than the bright
expectancy of youth, and much better prepared, knowing something of
Italy’s history and art. On September 1 8 he wrote to Herder, “I hope to
return a newborn person,” and to Karl August, “I hope to bring back a
thoroughly cleansed and far better equipped human being.” To these and
other friends he sent “Letters from Italy” that still have in them the
allegrezza of Italian life. He prefaced them with the old motto Auch in
Arkadien — ht too was now in Arcady. We have seen elsewhere how grateful
he was for the sunshine; “I believe in God again!” he cried out as he
entered Italy. 60 But he loved the Italian people too, their open faces
and hearts, the naturalness of their lives, the passion and jollity of
their speech. Being a scientist as well as a poet, he made note of</p>
<p>“Know you the land where the lemon trees bloom, where the golden
oranges glow in the</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>meteorological peculiarities, geological formations, mineral
specimens, vari- eties of animals and plants; he liked even the lizards
that darted over the rocks.</p>
<p>He was so eager to reach Rome that he passed hurriedly through
Venezia, Lombardy, and Tuscany. But he stopped long enough in Vicenza to
feel the classic simplicity and power of Palladio’s architecture. He
strongly reaf - firmed his antipathy to Gothic: “from all taste for
those… tobacco -pipe shafts, our little steeple-crowned towers and
foliated terminals,… I am now, thank God, set free forever!… Palladio
has opened the road for me to every… art.” 61 Through that road he went
back to Vitruvius, whom he studied in an edition by Galiani, our witty
friend from Naples and Paris. The classical style now became a passion
with him, coloring his works and thought, re-forming some past
productions, like Iphigenie and Tasso, into classic mold and line. In
Venice the baroque palaces seemed immodestly garish, too femininely
elegant; and even from the Renaissance fagades he turned to the relics
of classic architecture and statuary in the museums. But his warm blood
responded to the color and pride of Veronese and Titian.</p>
<p>In Ferrara he sought in vain the palace where Tasso had been
confined. After three days in Bologna and only three hours in Florence,
he rushed on through Perugia and Terni and Citta di Castello, and on
October 29, 1786, he rode through the Porta del Popolo into Rome. Now he
felt a passing mo- ment of modesty. “All roads are open to me, because I
walk in a spirit of humility.” 62</p>
<p>Not yet master of spoken Italian, he sought out the German colony,
and especially the artists, for he aspired to learn at least the
elements of drawing, painting, and sculpture. Angelica Kauffmann admired
his enthusiasm and good looks; she painted a portrait of him, stressing
his black hair, lofty fore- head, and clear eyes. He formed an intimate
friendship with Johann Hein- rich Wilhelm Tischbein, who handed him down
to us, in the famous Goethe in der Cawpagna , 63 reclining at ease as if
he had conquered Arcady. Long before coming to Italy Goethe had
corresponded with this painter; they met for the first time on November
3, when they converged in the Piazza San Pietro; the poet recognized the
artist, and introduced himself simply: “I am Goethe.” 64 Tischbein
described him in a letter to Lavater:</p>
<p>I found him to be quite what I had expected. The only thing that
surprised me was the gravity and tranquillity of one of such vivid
sensibility, and also that he is able to be at ease and at home in all
circumstances. What pleases me still more is the simplicity of his life.
All he asked me to provide for him was a little room where he could
sleep and work without interruption; and the very simplest fare…. Now he
sits in that little room and works at his Iphigenie from early in the
morning till nine o’clock. Then he goes out to study the great works of
art. 65</p>
<p>Tischbein often guided him in these explorations, had drawings made
for him, and secured for him copies of the more famous paintings; Goethe
him- self made sketches of what he especially wished to recall. He tried
his hand at sculpture, and modeled a head of Hercules. He admitted that
he had no</p>
<p>588</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>alent for the plastic arts, but he felt that these experiments gave
him a bet- ter sense of form, and helped him to visualize what he wished
to describe. 66 He pored over Winckelmann’s History of Ancient Art - ,
“Here on the spot I find it highly valuable…. Now at last my mind can
rise to the greatest and purest creations of art with calm
consideration.” 67 “The history of the</p>
<p>It was in this classic rapture that he rewrote Iphigenie auf T auris
in verse (1787), resolved to rival Racine, even Euripides himself. Still
cherishing the embers of the fire that Charlotte von Stein had ignited
in him, he poured into the speeches of the Greek princess something of
the tenderness and self- control of the German baroness. He told the old
story well, with all its complications of mythology and genealogy; he
intensified the drama by por- traying the Scythian king favorably; and
he dared to change the ending to accord with the idea — rare among the
Greeks — that one has moral obligations even to “barbarians.” Only those
who can read German fluently can appre - ciate Goethe’s performance; yet
Hippolyte Taine, a Frenchman, a supreme critic, and presumably familiar
with Racine’s dramas, said: “I place no mod - ern work a bove Goethe’s
Iphigenie auf T auris.” 72</p>
<p>The memories of Charlotte in this play, and still more in Torquato
Tasso, which he rewrote in Rome, revived his feeling for her. She had
been deeply wounded by his sudden flight to Italy, and by his leaving
her boy in charge of a servant; she at once took Fritz back, and
demanded the return of all the letters she had written to Goethe. He
wrote apologetically from Rome (De- cember 8, 13, and 20, 178 6); she
sent him (December 18) a note of “bitter - sweet” reproof; he answered
(December 23): “I cannot express to you how it pierces my heart that you
are ill, and ill through my fault. Forgive me. I myself fought with
death and life, and no tongue can speak the things that went on within
me.” Finally.she relented. “Now,” he wrote on February 1, 1787, “I can
go to work in a happier mood, since I have a letter from you in which
you say that you love and take delight in my letters.”</p>
<p>In that month he and Tischbein went to Naples. He ascended

<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>wice; on his second attempt a minor eruption covered his head and
shoul- ders with ashes. He reveled in the classic ruins at Pompeii, and
marveled at the simple majesty of the Greek temples at Paestum.
Returning to Rome, he took ship to Palermo, went on to study the classic
temples at Segeste and Girgenti (Agrigento), stood in the Greek theater
at Taormina, and was back in Rome in June. More and more in love with
“the most remarkable city in the whole world,” 73 he persuaded Duke Karl
August to continue his salary to the end of 1787. When that extension
expired, he slowly recon- ciled himself to the North. He left Rome on
April 25, 1788, traveled lei- surely through Florence, Milan, and Como,
and reached Weimar on June 18. Every day he wondered how the Duke, the
court, and Charlotte would re- ceive a Goethe who felt himself
transformed.</p>
<p>V. GOETHE WAITING: 1 788-94</p>
<p>With the absent poet’s cons ent the Duke had appointed a new
president of the Council; now, at his own request, Goethe was relieved
of all official duties except as minister of education, and henceforth
he served the Council only in an advisory capacity. The Duke was kind,
but he had taken other in- timates, and he did not like the
semirepublican sentiments of the rewritten Egmont. The reading public
had almost forgotten Goethe; it had taken up a new poet called Schiller,
and had enthusiastically applauded a play, The Robbers , full of that
Sturm-und-Drang rebelliousness and violence which now seemed absurd and
immature to a poet ready to preach classic order and restraint.
Charlotte von Stein received him coldly; she resented his long ab-
sence, his leisurely return, his persistent rapture about Italy; and
perhaps she had heard of those models in Rome. Their first meeting after
his arrival was “utterly false in tone,” she wrote, “and nothing but
boredom was ex - changed between us.” 74 She left for a stay in
Kochberg, and Goethe was free to think of Christiane Vulpius.</p>
<p>She came into his life on July 12, 1788, bearing a message from
her</p>
<p>brother. She was twenty-three years old, and worked in a factory
making artificial flowers. Goethe was struck with her fresh spirit, her
simple mind, her budding womanhood. He invited her to his garden house
as his house- keeper, and soon made her his mistress. She had no
education, and “cannot understand poetry at all,” said Goethe, 75 but
she yielded herself trustfully, and gave him the physical fulfillment
that Charlotte had apparently refused. In November, 1789, when she was
nearing motherhood, he took her into his Weimar home, and openly made
her his wife in all but name. Charlotte and the court were shocked at
his crossing class lines and his failure to veil the illicit relation;
this reaction caused him and Christiane much grief; but the Duke, an old
hand with mistresses, served as godfather to the child that was born on
Christmas Day, 1789, and Herder, stem but forgiving, chris- tened it
August.</p>
<p>Goethe, so often a lover but only now a father, found much happiness
in</p>
<p>590</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>“the little man” and “das kleine Weib,” the little woman. She kept
house for him, she listened to him lovingly even when she did not
understand him, and she gave him health. “Since she first crossed this
threshold,” he told a friend, “I have had nothing but joy of her.” 76
Her only fault in his eyes was that she loved wine even more than he
did, and that it sometimes led her to al- most uncontrolled merriment.
She frequented the theater, and went to many dances while Goethe stayed
home and celebrated her in his Romische Ele- gien (1789-90), written in
the manner of Propertius and with the morals of Catullus. There is
nothing mournful about these “Roman elegies”; they get their names from
their “elegiac” meter of alternating hexameters and pentam - eters; and
they concern not Rome but a merry widow through whose dis- guise we see
Christiane herself.</p>
<p>All that thy sacred walls, eternal Rome, hold within them</p>
<p>Teemeth with life; but to me all is still silent and dead.</p>
<p>Oh, who will whisper unto me? — when shall I see at the casement</p>
<p>That one beauteous form, which, while it scorcheth, revives?…</p>
<p>Do not repent, mine own love, that thou so soon didst surrender!</p>
<p>Trust me; 1 deem thee not bold; reverence only I feel….</p>
<p>Alexander and Caesar and Henry and Frederick, the mighty.</p>
<p>On me would gladly bestow half of the glory they earned,</p>
<p>Could I but grant unto them one night on the couch where I’m
lying;</p>
<p>But they by Orcus’ night sternly, alas, are heKTdown.</p>
<p>Therefore rejoice, O thou living one, blest in thy love-lighted
homestead.</p>
<p>Ere the dark Lethe’s sad wave wetteth thy fugitive foot. 77</p>
<p>That pretty widow may have been a Roman memory, but the warmth of
these lines came from Christiane. After all, was he not studying
art?</p>
<p>Yet it is studious too with sensitive hand</p>
<p>To mark her bosom’s lovely curves, and let</p>
<p>Wise fingers glide down the smooth thigh, for thus</p>
<p>I master the antique sculptor’s craft, reflect,</p>
<p>Compare, and apprehend to come and see</p>
<p>With feeling eye, and feel with seeing hand. 78</p>
<p>The Weimar ladies were not pleased by this cheapening exposure of
their charms, and the stately Charlotte mourned the degeneration of her
Galahad. Even Karl August was a bit disturbed, but was soon appeased.
When the Dowager Duchess was returning from Italy he sent Goethe to
Venice to escort her home. His stay there (March to June, 1790) was
protracted un- comfortably; he longed for Christiane, and vented his
irritation with Italian shopkeepers and hygiene in V enezianische
Epigramme — the least attractive of his works.</p>
<p>On his return from Venice he found that the French Revolution was</p>
<p>arousing the youth of Germany to ecstasy, and the rulers to fear.
Many of his friends, including Wieland and Herder, were applauding the
overthrow of monarchical absolutism in France. Goethe, perceiving that
all thrones were threatened, took his stand beside the Duke, and
counseled caution; so many people, he said, were “runn ing about with
bellows in their hands, when, it seems to me, they had better be looking
for cold- water jugs” to</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>control the fire. 79 He obeyed the order of Karl August to accompany
him in the campaign of the First Coalition against France. He was
present at the battle of Valmy (September 20, 1792), stood calmly under
fire, and shared in the defeat. A German officer recorded in his diary
that when the poet- councilor was asked to comment on the event, he a
nswered, “From today and from this place begins a new epoch in the
history of the world” 80 ; we have no confirmation of this story. In any
case, back in Weimar, Goethe wrote vigorously against the Revolution,
which was entering the period (1792-94) of its excesses and
savagery.</p>
<p>These developments confirmed in Goethe the natural turn of the matur-
ing mind from a zest for liberty to a love of order. As any fool can be
origi- nal, so Goethe felt that “any fool can live arbitrarily,” 81 sa
fely violating customs or laws because others observe them. He had no
enthusiasm for democracy; if ever such a system should actually be
practiced it would be the sovereignty of simplicity, ignorance,
superstition, and barbarity. He was kindly and generous within his
sphere, and spent part of his income in secret charities, 82 but he
shrank from the crowd. In the presence of multitudes or strangers he
withdrew proudly and timidly within himself, and found his only
happiness in his home. In these unsettling years (1790-94) he fell into
a somber torpor from which he was aroused by the touch of Schiller’s
ardent youth and the competition of his pen.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>SCHILLER WAITING: 1 787-94</li>
</ol>
<p>When Schiller reached Weimar Goethe was in Italy. The almost
penniless poet admitted jealousy of the absent councilor. “While he is
painting in Italy, the Toms, Dicks, and Harrys are sweating for him like
beasts of bur- den. He is squandering a salary of 1,800 thalers there,
and here they have to work double tides for half the money.” 83 On
August 12, 1787, he wrote</p>
<p>Goethe is spoken of here by many with a sort of devotion, and is even
more loved and admired as a man than as an author. Herder says he has a
most clear judgment, great depth of feeling, and the purest sentiments….
According to Herder, Goethe is free from all spirit of intrigue; he has
never done harm to anyone…. In his political transactions he acts openly
and boldly…. Herder says that as a man of affairs Goethe is more
deserving of admiration than as a poet,… that he has a mind large enough
for any- thing. 84</p>
<p>The Duke was away when Schiller came, but Anna Amalie and Charlotte
von Stein received him cordially. Wieland told him that he “was wanting
in polish, clearness, and taste,” 85 and offered to polish him; soon the
eager poet was contributing to Wieland’s Teutsche Merkur. He found more
intimate entertainment with Charlotte von Kalb, who, like the other
Charlotte, had a broad- minded husband. “People begin to whisper pretty
loudly here about my connection with Charlotte…. Herr von Kalb has
written to me. He</p>
<p>592</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>comes here at the end of September, and his arrival will greatly
influence my arrangements. His friendship for me remains unchanged,
which is aston- ishing, for he loves his wife, and is aware of my
intimacy with her…. But he can never for one moment doubt her fidelity….
He still remains the honest, goodhearted fellow he always was.” 86</p>
<p>On August 27, 1787, Don Carlos had its premiere in Hamburg. Schiller
was too fond of Weimar to attend. This, his first play in verse, was
both praised and condemned as a surrender to the style of French
tragedy, but it lacked the dramatic unity required by Aristotelian
rules. It began with the conflict between Philip II and his son for the
love of Elizabeth of Valois; then, mid-play, the center of interest
shifted to the struggle of the Nether- lands to free themselves from
Spanish suzerainty and Alva’s cruelty. Schiller tried to give an
impartial portrait of Philip, and Protestant readers applauded the
appeal of Marquis Posa to the King:</p>
<p>Your Majesty,</p>
<p>I lately passed through Flanders and Brabant —</p>
<p>So many rich and blooming provinces,</p>
<p>Filled with a valiant, great, and honest people!</p>
<p>To be the father of a race like this</p>
<p>I thought must be divine indeed! And then</p>
<p>I stumbled on a heap of burned men’s bones!…</p>
<p>Restore us all you have deprived us of,</p>
<p>And, generous and strong, let happiness</p>
<p>Flow from your horn of plenty; let man’s mind</p>
<p>Ripen in your vast empire,… and become</p>

<p>The end and object of the monarch’s care,</p>
<p>Bound by no duty save a brother’s love. 87</p>
<p>Despite the success of Don Carlos, Schiller for a long time abandoned
drama. In 1786 he had written to Korner: “History has with each
successive day new attractions for me…. I wish I had studied nothing
else for ten years together; I think I should have been another sort of
being. Do you think there is yet time to make up for what I have lost?”
88 He could not sup - port himself, much less a family, on the proceeds
of occasional plays that even after an applauded premiere might wither
to an early death. Perhaps some successful work of history would give
him sufficient reputation as a scholar to win a professorship in the
University of Jena. There he would be only fourteen miles from Weimar,
and still within the jurisdiction and bounty of the Duke.</p>
<p>So, after finishing Don Carlos, he gave his pen to a Geschichte des
Abfalls der V ereinigten Niederlande ( History of the Fall of the United
Nether- lands). As Schiller could not read Dutch, he relied on secondary
authorities, from whose narratives he put together a compilation of no
lasting worth. Korner criticized Volume I (1788) with his usual honesty:
“The present work, with all its talent, does not bear the stamp of that
genius of which you are capable.” 89 Schiller abandoned the Netherlands;
no second volume came.</p>

<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>

<p>On July 1 8, 1788, Goethe returned from Italy, and in September met
Schiller in suburban Rudolstadt. Schiller reported to Korner: “The high
idea I had conceived of him is not lessened in the slightest degree,…
but I doubt if we shall ever draw very close to each other…. He is so
far ahead of me… that we cannot meet on the road. His whole life from
the very beginning has run in a direction contrary to mine. His world is
not my world. On some points our notions are diametrically opposed.” 90
And indeed the two poets seemed providentially designed to dislike each
other. Goethe, thirty-nine, had arrived and matured; Schiller,
twenty-nine, was climbing and experimenting; only in proud egotism did
they agree. The younger man was of the people, poor, writing
semirevolutionary lines; the other was rich, a man of rank and state, a
privy councilor deprecating revolution. Schiller was just emerging from
Sturm und Drang; he was the voice of feeling, senti- ment, freedom,
romance; Goethe, wooing Greece, was all for reason, re- straint, order,
and the classic style. In any case, it is not natural for authors to
like one another; they are reaching for the same prize.</p>
<p>When they returned to Weimar, Goethe and Schiller lived only a short
walk from each other, but they did not communicate. Matters were wors-
ened by the appearance of Schiller’s hostile review of Goethe’s Egmont.
Goethe decided that “little Athens” was not large enough to contain both
of them. In December, 1788, he recommended Schiller for a chair in
history at Jena. Schiller gladly accepted, and called on Goethe to thank
him, but in February, 1789, he wrote to Korner:</p>
<p>It would make me unhappy to be a great deal in Goethe’s society. He
never warms even toward his best friends; nothing attaches him. I verily
believe he is an egotist of the first water. He possesses the talent of
putting men under an obligation to him by small as well as great acts of
courtesy, but he always manages to remain free himself…. I look upon him
as the personification of a well-calculated system of unbounded
selfishness. Men should not tolerate such a being near them. He is
hateful to me for this reason, though I cannot do otherwise than admire
his mind, and think nobly of him. He has aroused in me a curious mixture
of hatred and love. 91</p>
<p>On May 1 1, 1789, Schiller took up his duties at Jena, and on May 26
he delivered his “inaugural address” on “What Is, and to What End Does
One Study, Universal History?” Admission being free, the audience proved
far too large for the room assigned, and the professor moved with his
auditors in a gay stampede to a hall at the other end of town.’ This
lecture was highly praised; “the students gave me a serenade that night,
and three rounds of cheers”; 92 but enrollment for the course— for which
admission was charged — was small, and Schiller’s scholastic income was
meager.</p>
<p>He added to it by writing. In 1789-91 he brought out, in three
install- ments, Geschichte des Dreissigjahrigen Krieges ( History of the
Thirty Years’ War). Here he was at home at least with the language,
though again he was too harassed to go to the primary sources, and his
predilection for judging and philosophizing colored and halted the tale.
Nevertheless Wie- land hailed the work as indica ting Schiller’s
“capacity for rising to a level</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>594</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>with Hume, Robertson, and Gibbon.” 93 Seven thousand copies of Volume
I were sold in its first year.</p>
<p>Schiller now felt that he could indulge his longing for a home, and
for a woman to give him love and care. He had had a brief glimpse of
Charlotte and Caroline von Lengefeld at Mannheim in 1784. He saw them
again at Rudolstadt in 1787; “Lotte” was living there with her mother,
and Caroline, unhappily married, was living next door. “Both, without
being pretty,” - cepting them with a loving heart.” 95 They were married
on February 22, 1790, and took a modest home in Jena. Lotte brought her
own income of two hundred thalers a year, gave him four children, and
proved, through all his tribulations, a patient and tender wife. “My
heart swims in happiness,” he wrote, “and my mind draws fresh strength
and vigor.” 98</p>
<p>He worked hard, preparing two lectures a week, writing articles,
poems, and history. For months he labored fourteen hours a day. 97 In
January, 1791, he suffered two spells of “catarrhal fever,” involving
gastric pains and ex- pectoration of blood. For eight days he lay in
bed, his stomach rejecting all food. Students helped Lotte to care for
him, and “vied with one another as to who should sit up with me at
night…. The Duke sent me half a dozen of old Madeira, which, with some
Hungarian wine, has done me good serv- ice.” 98 In May he was attacked
by “a fearful spasm, with symptoms of suffo - cation, so that I could
not but think that my last moment had come…. I took farewell of my loved
ones, and thought to pass away any minute…. Strong doses of opium,
camphor, and musk, and the application of blisters, relieved me most.”
99</p>
<p>A false report of his death alarmed his friends, and reached even to
Copen- hagen. There — on suggestions from Karl Reinhold and Jens
Baggesen — two Danish noblemen, Duke Friedrich Christian of Holstein-
Augustenburg and Count Ernst von Schimmelmann, offered Schiller an
annual gift of a thou- sand thalers for three years. He received it
gratefully. The university ex- cused him from teaching, but he lectured
to a small private circle. Part of his new leisure he gave, at
Reinhold’s urging, to the study of Kant’s philosophy, which he accepted
almost completely, to Goethe’s amusement and Herder’s disgust, and
perhaps with some detriment to Schiller’s poetry.</p>
<p>Now (1793) he sent forth his long essay On Grace and Dignity, which
began the romantic cultivation of die schone Seele. “A beautiful soul”
he de - fined as one in which “rea son and the senses, duty and
inclination, are in harmony, and are outwardly expressed in grace.” 100
The Copenhagen donors must have been alarmed to receive, as some return
for their gift, a little vol-</p>

<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>ume entitled Brief e iiber die dsthetische Erziehung des Menschen (
Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Mankind, 1793- 94) • Starting with
Kant’s con - ception of the sense of beauty as a disinterested
contemplation of harmonious forms, Schiller argued (with Shaftesbury)
that “the feeling developed by the beautiful refines manners,” and the
aesthetic sense becomes one with morality. — It is a consolation to
read, in this pronouncement from Weimar’s halcyon days, that Schiller
(like Goethe) thought his generation decadent, sunk in “profound moral
degradation.” 101</p>
<p>When he turned back from philosophy to poetry he found it difficult
to recapture “that boldness and living fire I formerly possessed;…
critical discussion has spoiled me.” 102 But he insisted that “the poet
is the only au - thentic human being; the best philosopher is a mere
caricature compared with him”; 103 and he exalted to the plane of
celestial inspiration the function of the poet to teach and raise
mankind. In a long ode, Die Kiinstler ( The Artists, 1789), he described
poets and artists as guiding mankind to the union of beauty with
morality and truth. In another poem, Die Gotter Griechen- lands ( The
Gods of Greece, 1788) he lauded the Greeks for their aesthetic
sensibility and artistic creations, and argued, with cautious obscurity,
that the world had become gloomy and ugly since the replacement of
Hellenism by Christianity. He was already falling under Goethe’s spell,
as Goethe had</p>
<p>Probably in both Schiller and Goethe the romantification of Hellas
was an escape from Christianity. Despite some pious passages Schiller,
as well as Goethe, belonged to the Aufklarung; he accepted the
eighteenth-century faith in salvation by human reason rather than by
divine grace. He retained a deistic belief in God — personal only in
poetry — and a misty immortality. He rejected all churches, Protestant
as well as Catholic. He could not bear sermons, even Herder’s. In an
epigram entitled “Mein Glaube” (My Faith) he wrote two famous lines:</p>
<p>Welche Religion ich bekenne? Keine von alien</p>
<p>Die du mir nennst. Und warum keine? Aus Religion.</p>
<p>—“Which religion do I acknowledge? None of all those that you name to
me. And why none? Because of religion.” 104 tie wrote to Goethe, July 9,
1796: “A healthy and beautiful nature— as you yourself say — requires no
moral code, no law for its nature, no political metaphysics. You might
as well have added that it requires no godhead, no idea of immortality
where- with to support and maintain itself.” Nevertheless there were
factors of imagination and tenderness in him that drew him back toward
Christianity:</p>
<p>I find that Christianity virtually contains the first elements of
what is highest and noblest; and its various outward forms seem
distasteful and repulsive to us only because they are misrepresentations
of the highest…. No sufficient emphasis has been placed upon what this
religion can be to a beautiful mind, or rather what a beautiful mind can
make of it…. This explains why this re- ligion is so successful with
feminine natures, and why it is that only in women is it at all
supportable. 105</p>

<p>Schiller was not, like Goethe, physically built for thorough
paganism. His face was handsome but pale, his frame tall but thin and
frail. He distrusted the diurnal vacillations of the weather, and
preferred to sit in his room smoking and taking snuff. He contrasted
himself with Goethe as idea versus nature, imagination versus intellect,
sentiment versus objective thought. 106 He was at once timid and proud,
shrinking from hostility but always fight- ing back; occasionally
irritable and impatient, 107 perhaps because aware that his time was
running out; often critical of others, sometimes envious. 108 He had a
tendency to moralize about everything, and to take a high idealistic
tone. It is a relief to find him enjoying the eroticism of Diderot’s Les
Bijoux indiscrets , m He analyzed his own talent well in an early letter
to Goethe:</p>
<p>The poetic mind generally got the better of me when I ought to have
phi- losophized, and my philosophical mind when I wished to poetize.
Even now it often happens that imagination intrudes upon my
abstractions, and cold rea- son upon my poetical productions. If I could
obtain such mastery over these two powers as to assign to each its
limits [as Goethe did], I might yet look for- ward to a happy fate. But,
alas, just when I have begun to know and to use my moral energies
rightly, illness seizes me, and threatens to undermine my physical
powers. 110</p>
<p>His ailment returned with fury in December, 1793; he recovered, but
the sense that he could not be cured, and must expect recurrent
seizures, dark- ened his mood. On December 10 he wrote to Korner: “I
struggle against this with all the force of my mind,… but I am always
driven back…. The uncertainty of my prospects;… doubts of my own genius,
which is not sustained and encouraged by contact with others; the total
absence of that intellectual conversation which has become a necessity
to me”: these were the mental accompaniments of his physical trials. He
looked with long- ing, from Jena to Weimar, to the enviably healthy
Goethe, that mens sana in corpore sano; there, Schiller felt, was the
man who could give him stimu- lus and support, if only the ice between
them would melt, if only that four- teen-mile barrier would fall
away!</p>

</ol>
<p>It fell for a moment when, in June, 1794, both men attended in Jena a
session of the Society for Natural History. Encountering Goethe as they
left the hall, Schiller remarked that the biological specimens exhibited
at the conference lacked life, and could offer no real help to
understanding nature. Goethe emphatically agreed, and the conversation
kept them together till they reached Schiller’s home. “The talk induced
me to go in” with him, Goethe later recalled. “I expounded to h im… The
Metamorphosis of Plants”— a treatise in which Goethe had argued that all
plants were varia- tions of one primitive type, the Urpflanze, and that
nearly all parts of a plant were variations or developments of the leaf.
“He heard… all this w ith much interest and distinct apprehension; but
when I had done he shook his</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>597</p>
<p>head and said, ‘This is not experiment, it is an idea’ i.e., it was a
theory not yet verified by observation or test. The comment nettled
Goethe, but he saw that Schiller had a mind of his own, and his respect
for him grew. Schiller’s wife, “whom I had loved and valued since her
childhood, did her best to strengthen our reciprocal u nderstanding.”
111</p>
<p>In May of 1794 Schiller had signed a contract to edit a literary
monthly to be called Die Horen. (The Horae, in Greek mythology, were the
god- desses of the seasons.) He hoped to enlist as contributors Kant,
Fichte, Klop- stock, Herder, Jacobi, Baggesen, Korner, Reinhold, Wilhelm
von Hum- boldt, August Wilhelm von Schlegel, and — best catch of all —
Goethe. On June 3 he sent to Weimar a letter addressed to
“Hochwohlgeborener Herr, Hochzuverehrender Herr Geheimer Rat” (High and
Well born Sir, Highly Honored Sir Privy Councilor) a prospectus of the
proposed magazine, and added: “The enclosed paper expresses the wish of
a number of men, whose esteem for you is unbounded, that you would honor
the periodical with con- tributions from your pen, in regard to the
value of which there can be but one voice among us. We feel, your
Excellency, that your consent to support this undertaking will be a
guarantee of its success.” 112 Goethe replied that</p>
<p>So began a correspondence that is among the treasures of literary
history, and a friendship whose exchange of respect and aid, lasting for
eleven years —till Schiller’s death— should enter into our estimate of
mankind. Perhaps the most revealing of the 999 extant letters is the
fourth (August 23, 1794), in which Schiller, after several meetings with
Goethe, analyzed with both courtesy and candor, both modesty and pride,
the differences between their minds:</p>
<p>My recent conversations with you have put the whole store of my ideas
in motion…. Many things about which I could not come to a right
understand- ing with myself have received new and unexpected light from
the contempla- tion I have had of your mind (for so I call the general
impression of your ideas upon me). I needed the object , the body, to
several of my speculative ideas, and you have put me on the track for
finding it. Your calm and clear way of looking at things keeps you from
getting lost in the side roads into which speculation, as well as
arbitrary imagination… are so apt to lead me astray. Your correct
intuition grasps all things, and that far more perfectly than what is
laboriously sought for by analysis…. Minds like yours seldom know how
far they have penetrated, and how little cause they have to borrow from
phi- losophy, which in fact can only learn from them…. Although I have
done so at a distance, I have long watched the course which your mind
has pur- sued….You seek for the necessary in nature, but… you look at
nature as a whole when seeking to get light thrown on her individual
parts; you look for the explanation of the individual in the totality of
all her various manifesta- tions. 114</p>
<p>Goethe’s answer (August 27) cleverly avoided an analysis of
Schiller’s mind:</p>
<p>59^ ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>For my birthday, which occurred this week, I could have received no
more agreeable gift than your letter, in which, with a friendly hand,
you sum up my existence, and in which, by your sympathy, you encourage
me to a more assiduous and active use of my powers…. It will be a
pleasure to unfold to you at leisure what your conversation has been to
me; how I too regard those days as an epoch in my life; for it seems to
me that after so unexpected a meet- ing we cannot but wander on in life
together.</p>
<p>Goethe followed this up (September 4) with an invitation to Schiller
to come and spend some days with him in Weimar. “You could take up any
kind of work you like without being disturbed. We would converse to-
gether at convenient hours,… and I think we would not part without some
profit. You should live exactly as you like, and as much as possible as
if you were in your own home.” Schiller readily accepted, but warned
Goethe that “the asthmatic spasms from which I suffer oblige me to stay
in bed all morning, since they leave me no peace at night.” So, from
September</p>
<p>There followed three months of preparation for the first number of
Die Horen. This appeared on January 24, 1795; the second, on March 1;
the rest monthly for three years. Goethe reported from Weimar (March
18): “Peo - ple are running after it, snatching the numbers from one
another’s hands; we could not want mo re for a beginning.” On April 10
Schiller informed Goethe: “Kant has written me a very friendly letter,
but begs for a delay in sending his contributions…. I am glad we have
induced the old bird to join us.” Goethe asked that his own pieces be
unsign ed, for they included several of his Roman Elegies, and he knew
that their lusty sensuality would seem unbecoming in a privy
councilor.</p>
<p>In the rash enthusiasm of success Schiller persuaded Goethe to join
him in another periodical, Der Musenalmanach, which appeared yearly from
1796 to 1800. The liveliest pieces in this were the Xenien that the two
poets wrote on the model of Martial’s Xenia — epigrams written as gifts
to guests. Schiller described the project to Korner: “The whole affair
consists in a conglomera- tion of epigrams, of which each is a single
couplet. They are chiefly wild and impish satires, especially against
authors and their works, interspersed here and there by sudden flashes
of poetical or philosophical ideas. There will be no less than six
hundred of such monodistichs.” 115 Goethe had sug - gested this plan as
a way to strike back at their critics, to make fun of pom- pous authors
and bourgeois tastes, and to stir the German reading public to a keener
interest in literature; they would send these “gifts” into the camp of
the Philistines “like foxes with burning tails.” 116 The epigrams were
un -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl)</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>signed, and some of them were the joint product of the two
conspirators. Since many of these burning tails were directed at authors
or controversies now forgotten, time has extinguished their fire; but
one of them, by Goethe, especially merits remembrance:</p>
<p>Immer strebe zum G arizen, und kannst du selber kein Ganzes</p>
<p>Werden, als dienendes Glied schliess an ein Ganzes dich an!</p>
<p>—“Always strive for the whole, and if you yourself cannot become a
whole, tie yourself to some whole as a serving part.” Another distich,
usually cred - ited to Schiller, extends the thought:</p>
<p>V or dem Tod erschrickst du? Du wiinschest unsterblich zu leben?</p>
<p>Leb’ im Ganzen! Wenn du lange dahin bist, es bleibt.</p>
<p>—“You are frightened by death? You wish to live undying? Live in the
Whole! When you are long gone hence, it will remain.” The satirical
part</p>
<p>It was done. In these years of their developing friendship Goethe and
Schiller wrote some of their finest poems: Goethe “The Bride of Corinth”
and “The God and the Bayadere”; Schiller “The Walk” (1795), “The</p>
<p>Cranes of Ibycus” (1797), and “The Song of the Bell” (1800).
Schiller</p>
<p>added a major essay Vber naive und sentimentalische Dichtung (1795),
and Goethe sent forth Wilhelm Meisters Lehr jahre (1796).</p>
<p>By “naive and sentimental poetry” Schiller meant poetry born of objec
- tive perception versus poetry developed by reflective feeling;
secretly he was comparing Goethe and Schiller. The “naive” poet is not
simple or superficial or deluded; he is one who is so readily adjusted
to the external world that he feels no opposition between himself and
nature, but approaches reality through direct and unhesitating
intuition; Schiller cites Homer and Shake- speare as examples. As
civilization becomes more complex and artificial, poetry loses this
objective immediacy and subjective harmony; conflict en- ters the soul,
and the poet has to recapture through imagination and feeling — as an
ideal remembered or hoped for — this concord and union of the self with
the world; poetry becomes reflective, clouded with thought. 118 Schiller
believed that most Greek poetry was of the naive or direct sort, and
most modern poetry the result of discord, disunity, and doubt. The ideal
poet is he who will fuse both the simple and the reflective approaches
in one vision and poetic form. Goethe later pointed out that this essay
became a fountain- head of the debate between classical and Romantic
literature and art.</p>
<p>The embryology of Wilhelm Meisters Lehr jahre illustrates Goethe’s
method of creation. He conceived the story in 1777, completed Book I in
1778, put it aside, and did not finish Book II until July, 1782. He
worked on Book III until November of that year, and on Book IV till
November, 1783;</p>
<p>6oo</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>Books V and VI dragged along for three years more. He called these
six books “Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung,” and read parts of
them to friends; then he laid them aside. He took up the tale again in
1791 on the urging of Herder and Anna Amalie; added two books by June,
1794; sub- mitted the growing manuscript to Schiller, who sent back
criticisms, sug- gestions, and encouragement as the pages came; it was
almost a picture of a midwife assisting at a long-overdue birth. At
last, in 1796, the whole was delivered to the press. No wonder the final
product was slightly deformed, weak in structure, adipose and confused,
excellent only in parts and in its mirroring of Goethe’s uncertain
wandering amid conflicting interests and vague ideals. That decisiveness
and self-confidence which Schiller ascribed to him were the proud
concealment of internal vacillation and strife.</p>
<p>Lehrjahre — “learning years”— expressed the period of apprenticeship
in the German guilds; through that time of tutelage Wilhelm became
Meister, master; so the meandering theme of the novel is Wilhelm’s slow
an d painful apprenticeship in the guild of life. Because of the puppet
shows Goethe had loved as a child, and his continuing interest in the
theater, he tied the tale to a troupe of actors passing through a dozen
towns and a hundred vicissitudes as lessons in living and pictures of
German ways. Faithful to his own un- faithfulness, he made his hero
enter upon the scene by deserting his mistress Marianne. Wilhelm is not
an alluring character. He lets himself be carried from one situation or
idea to another by the whim of circumstance or the power of personality;
it is the woman who takes the initiative in his love af- fairs. Born a
bourgeois, he flounders in admiration for men of noble birth, and humbly
hopes that these will someday recognize the aristocracy of the mind.
Philine is more attractive: a pretty actress who waltzes lightly from
love to love, but graces her erotic tourism with a contagious gaiety and
an absolving unconsciousness of sin. Unique is little Mignon, who
follows her old father dutifully as he strums his harp in
penny-gathering peregrinations. Goethe describes her as speaking “very
broken German,” 119 but puts into her mouth that perfect song, “Kennst
du das Land.” She falls in adolescent love with Wilhelm, who loves her
as a child, and she dies in grief when she sees him in Theresa’s arms.
Ambroise Thomas plucked her out of these eight hundred pages to make of
her a sad and delightful opera ( 1 866).</p>
<p>Schiller praised the calm serenity of the style in Wilhelm Meisters
Lehr- jahre, and the truth to life in the description of a wandering
troupe; but he pointed out contradictions in chronology, psychological
improbabilities, of- fenses against taste, and faults in
characterization and design. 120 He proposed changes in the plot, and
gave his ideas as to how the story should end. 121 Goethe assured him,
“I shall certainly comply with your just wishes as far as I possibly
can”; 122 but he confessed to E ckermann, thirty-three years later, that
it was all he could do to protect his novel from Schiller’s influence.
123 Other critics were less friendly; one described the book as a
brothel on tour; and Charlotte von Stein complained that “when Goethe
deals with lofty emotions he always flings some dirt at them, as if to
deprive human nature of any pretensions to the divine.” 124 The novel
did not deserve these indiscrimi -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII )</p>
<p>WEIMAR IN FLOWER</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>nate censures; it has many pleasant pages, and can still carry the
interest of readers freed from the tumult of the world.</p>
<p>On March 23, 1796, Schiller went again to Weimar as Goethe’s guest.
There they worked together for the theater. Goethe was a strict manager,
chose the plays to be presented, and trained the actors. “All that was
morbid, weak, lachrymose, or sentimental, as well as all that was
frightful, horrible, or offensive to decorum, was utterly excluded.” 125
The audience was usually confined to the court, except when some
students were invited from Jena. August von Schlegel remarked, acidly:
“Germany has two national theaters</p>
<p>Schiller returned to Jena April 12, stimulated by his renewed contact
with the stage to revert from history, philosophy, and incidental poetry
to the drama. He had long thought of writing a play on Wallenstein;
Goethe urged him to proceed with it. In November Goethe went to Jena,
and lived for some time in daily communication with Schiller. Back in
Weimar, Goethe wrote: “Do not fail to make use of your best hours, so as
to get on with your tragedy, that we may begin to discuss it.” 127</p>
<p>While Schiller worked on Wallenstein , Goethe, stirred to rivalry by
the success of Johann Heinrich Voss’s verse idyl of German life and
sentiment, Luise (1795), tried his hand at this favorite genre, and
published in 1798 Hermann und Dorothea. Hermann is the strong and
healthy, shy and quiet son of a bilious father and tender mother, who
keep the Golden Inn and an extensive farm in a village near the Rhine.
They learn that hundreds of refu- gees are approaching from a frontier
town captured by the French; the fam- ily make up parcels of clothing
and food, which Hermann conveys to the refugees. He finds among them a
lass with “swelling bosom” and “neatly shaped ankles,” 128 who is
serving them with aid and comfort. He falls in love with her, and, after
due tribulations, brings her home to his parents as his bride. The story
is told in fluent hexameters; vignettes of rural life give color to the
tale; calls for the expulsion of the French invaders pleased patriotic
Germans who had found Iphigenie auf Tauris and Torquato Tasso foreign
and recondite; and the little epic gave new popularity to an author who,
since Werther, had had few readers outside the Saxe- Weimar duchy.</p>
<p>Schiller’s star was in the ascendant from 1798 to 1800. On November
28, 1796, he wrote to Korner: “I am still brooding seriously over
Wallenstein, but the unfortunate work is still before me, shapeless and
endless.” He began it in prose, put it aside, then started it again in
verse. The material was partly familiar to him from his studies for his
History of the Thirty Years’ War, but it was so abundant, so complex in
characters and events, that he aban- doned the attempt to compress it
into five acts. He decided to preface the drama with a one-act prologue
called Wallensteins Lager ( Wallenstein’s Camp), and to divide the
remainder into two plays. Die Piccolomini ex- pounded the plot to depose
the rebellious general, and set it off with a fiery love affair between
Wallenstein’s daughter and the son of a l eader in the plot. The final
and essential drama would be Wallensteins Tod.</p>
<p>6 02</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>When Goethe read the prologue he was so struck by the realistic por-
trayal of an army camp, and the clever preparation for later
developments, that he insisted on staging Wallensteins Lager in the
Weimar theater (Octo- ber 12, 1798) before Die Piccolomini was complete;
perhaps it was a subtle way of keeping the poet to his task. Early in
1799 Schiller went to Weimar to stage Die Piccolomini; it had its
premiere on January 30, and was well re- ceived; he returned to Jena and
worked feverishly on The Death of Wallen- stein. A letter of March 19,
1799, reveals the mood of a writer emerging from the ardor of creation:
“I have long dreaded the moment when I should be rid of my work, much as
I wished that moment would come; and in fact I feel my present freedom
to be worse than the state of bondage that I have been in heretofore.
The mass which has hitherto drawn and held me to it has now gone, and I
feel as if I were hanging indefinitely in empty space.”</p>
<p>Excitement enough came with the rehearsals and premiere (April
20,</p>
<ol start="1799" type="1">
<li>of Wallensteins Tod. Its success was complete; even the highly
criti- cal Weimar audience felt that it had witnessed a masterpiece of
dramatic presentation. Schiller had now reached the peak of his
development. He had shortened the speeches and intensified the action;
he had drawn all the lead- ing characters with vitality and power; he
had brought all the threads of the plot together in the tragic
denouement — the ignominious death of a great man ruined by limitless
ambition and pride. Schiller felt that he could now stand on an equality
with Goethe; 129 and in the field of drama he was justi- fied. Probably
at Goethe’s suggestion, the Duke added two hundred thalers to Schiller’s
pension, and invited him to reside in Weimar. On December 3, 1799, the
family moved to a house so close to Goethe’s that for a time the two
poets saw each other every day. 130</li>

<p>Meanwhile, carried onward by his triumph, Schiller had flung himself
into another play. “Thank God!” he wrote to Korner on May 8, 1799, “ I
have already hit upon a new subject for a tragedy.” For his Maria Stuart
he studied the historical background, but he laid no claim to writing
history; he proposed to write a play using history as material and
background. He re- arranged events and chronology for dramatic
consistency and effect; he stressed the unpleasant elements in
Elizabeth’s character, and made Mary an almost immaculate heroine; and
he brought the two queens face to face in a dramatic confrontation.
History knows of no such meeting, but the scene is one of the most
powerful in the literature of the stage. When it was presented at
Weimar, June 14, 1800, Schiller was again exalted with success. By July
he was at work on Die Jungfrau von Orleans. Here too he revised history
to his purpose: in place of burning the Maid he pictured Joan as es-
caping from her English captors, rushing into battle to rescue her king,
and dying in victory on the field. The premiere at Leipzig (September
18, 1801) was the greatest triumph that Schiller ever had.</p>
<p>Was Goethe jealous of his friend’s sudden rise to ascendancy on the
Ger - man stage? He rejoiced over it, and twenty-eight years later he
still judged Wallensteins Tod “so great that there is nothing else like
it of the kind.” 131 However, he did not rank his rival as high in
poetry as in drama; he felt that</p>

<p>Schiller had clouded his poetry with philosophy, and had never quite
mas- tered the music of verse. 132 When some admirers of Schiller wished
to stage a tribute to him in the Weimar theater, Goethe forbade it as
too ostenta- tious. 133 In July, 1 800, he went to Jena for seclusion
and study, while Schiller remained in Weimar; but on November 23
Schiller still spoke in terms of friendship unimpaired. He ranked Goethe
as “the most gifted man since Shakespeare…. In the six years of our
intimacy no slightest doubt of his integrity ever arose. He possessed
the highest veracity and sense of honor, and the deepest earnestness in
the pursuit of what is right and good.” 134 “I wish,” he added, “that I
could justify Goethe as warmly in respect of his domestic relations!…
Through false notions of what constitutes domestic happiness, and
through an unhappy fear of marriage, he has slipped into an entanglement
which oppresses him and makes him wretched in his very home, and which
he is too weak and softhearted to shake off. This is his only vulnerable
spot.” Schiller’s wife , like the other ladies of Weimar, would not
receive Christiane in her home, and Schiller rarely mentioned Christiane
in his extant communications with Goethe.</p>
<p>Despite these flaws in the friendship of the Dioskuren, as they were
some- times called, it at least proved that a classic and a Romantic
genius might live in harmony. They sent messages to each other almost
every day; they fre- quently had supper together; Goethe often put his
carriage at Schiller’s dis - posal; he sent to Sch iller “a portion of
the order which my wine merchant</p>
<p>In the final years of their alliance each was handicapped by disease.
For the first three months of 1801 Goethe suffered from nervousness,
sleepless- ness, violent influenza, and abscesses that for a time closed
his eyes. At one stage he was unconscious for so long that Weimar
expected his death. On January 12 Charlotte von Stein wrote to her son
Fritz: “I did not know that</p>
<p>In 1 802 Schiller, now prosperous from the rising proceeds of his
acted and published plays, bought a home in Weimar for 7,200 gulden, and
Goethe, then in Jena, helped him to sell the house he had lived in
there. On March 17,</p>
<p>6°4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>1803, Schiller produced Die Braut von Messina, a self-confessed 139
attempt to rival Sophocles’ Oedipus by portraying, with a divided
chorus, the strife of two brothers in love with a woman who turns out to
be their sister. The play did not please. Goethe experienced a similar
setback when, in 1803, he staged Die naturliche T ochter.</p>
<p>Among the spectators at a performance of The Natural Daughter was a
brilliant and volatile lady, Germaine Necker, Mme. de Stael, who was
gath- ering material for her book De F Allemagne. She saw Schiller for
the first time in December, 1803,</p>
<p>in the salon of the Duke and Duchess of Weimar, in a society as
enlightened as it is exalted. He read French very well, but he had never
spoken it. I main- tained with some warmth the superiority of our
dramatic system over that of all others; he did not refuse to enter the
lists with me, without feeling any un- easiness from the difficulty and
slowness with which he expressed himself in French…. I soon discovered
so many ideas through the impediment of his words, I was so struck with
the simplicity of his character,… I found him so modest,… so animated,
that I vowed him, from that moment, a friendship full of admiration.
140</p>
<p>Schiller prepared Goethe for her: “She represents the intellectual
culture of France in its purity…. The only trouble with her is her quite
extraordi- nary volubility. One has to turn oneself into one
concentrated organ of hear- ing in order to follow her.” 141 He brought
her to Goethe on December 24. Goethe reported: “A most interesting hour.
I didn’t get a chance to say a word. She speaks well, but far too much.”
Her own report was identical ex - cept for a slight change: she said
that Goethe had talked so much that she had not had a chance to speak
one syllable. 142 Her book served as a revelation to France of Germany
as “the native land of thought.” “It is impossible,” she wrote, “that
the German writers, the best -informed and the most reflecting men in
Europe, should not deserve a moment’s attention to be bestowed upon
their literature and their philosophy.” 143</p>
<p>Resolved to win back the audience that had rejected The Bride of Mes-
sina, Schiller, at Goethe’s suggestio n, chose for his next drama the
popular story of William Tell. He was soon on fire with the theme.
“After he had gathered all necessary material,” Goethe recalled in 1820,
“he sat down to work and… did not get up from his chair until the play
was finished. If weariness overcame him he laid his head on his arm and
slept a while. So soon as he awoke he asked… for strong black coffee to
keep himself awake. So the play was written in six weeks.” 144</p>
<p>Schiller accepted as history the legend of a William Tell who had led
the revolt of the Swiss against Austria in 1308. The revolt was real; so
was Gessler, the hated Austrian bailiff. Gessler, in the legend,
promised Tell full pardon if he proved his famed prowess with bow and
arrow by shooting an apple from his boy’s head. Tell placed two arrows
in his belt; with the first he shot the apple; Gessler asked for what he
had intended the second; Tell answered, “For you if the first should
strike my son.” The play was ac - claimed at Weimar on March 17, 1804,
and soon thereafter everywhere;</p>

<p>Switzerland adopted it as part of its national lore. Published, the
play sold seven thousand copies in a few weeks. Schiller was now more
famous than Goethe.</p>
<p>But he had less than a year of life left to him. In July, 1804, he
had so violent an attack of colic that his doctor feared for his death
and Schiller hoped for it. He recovered slowly, and began another play,
Demetrius (the “false Dmitri” of Russian history). On April 28, 1805, he
saw Goethe for the last time; from that meeting Goethe returned to his
home and himself fell seriously ill with colic. On the twenty- ninth
Schiller’s final sickness be - gan. Heinrich Voss reported: “Hi s eyes
were sunk deep in his head, and every nerve twitched convulsively.” 145
The unhealthy tensions of literary effort, the inflammation of his
bowels, and the decay of his lungs joined to destroy him. “Schiller
never drank much,” said Goethe later; “ he was very temperate, but in
such hours of bodily weakness he was obliged to stimulate his powers
with spirituous liquors.” 148 On May 9 Schiller met death with a strange
calm: he bade farewell to his wife, his four children, and his friends;
then he fell asleep, and did not wake again. An autopsy showed the left
lung completely destroyed by tuberculosis, the heart degenerated, the
liver, the kidney, and the intestines all diseased. The doctor told the
Duke: “Under the circumstances we cannot help wondering how the poor man
could have lived so long.” 147</p>
<p>Goethe was so ill at the time that no one dared tell him of
Schiller’s death. On May 10 Christiane’s sobbing revealed it to him. “I
thought I was losing my own life,” he wrote to Zelter, “and instead I
lost a friend who was the very half of my existence.” 148 With what
remained he came to his own ful - fillment.</p>
