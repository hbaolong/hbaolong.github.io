<h4 id="chapter-xxi-1724-1804">CHAPTER XXI 1724-1804</h4>
<p>I. PROLEGOMENA</p>
<p>I F Frederick the Great had not lived we might never have had
Immanuel Kant. The Critique of Pure Reason and Religion within the
Limits of</p>
<p>Reason Alone were made possible by Frederick’s skepticism and
toleration; within two years after Frederick’s death Kant was silenced
by the Prussian government.</p>
<p>Like Frederick, Kant was a child of the Enlightenment, and — despite
all his strategic wavering — held by reason to the end; but also, like
Rousseau, he was part of the Romantic movement, laboring to reconcile
reason with feel- ing, philosophy with religion, morality with revolt.
He received an infusion of Pietism from his parents, and crossed it with
the rationalism of Christian von Wolff; he absorbed the heresies of the
philosophes, and crossed them with the “Profession of Faith of the
Savoyard Vicar” in Rmile  he inherited the subtle psychology of Locke,
Leibniz, Berkeley, and Hume, and used it in an attempt to save science
from Hume and religion from Voltaire. He ordered his life with bourgeois
regularity, and hailed the French Revolution. Isolated in East Prussia,
he felt and summed up all the mental currents of his time.</p>
<p>He was born in Konigsberg (April 22, 1724), far from
clarity-loving</p>
<p>France and misty with the sea. Some doubt has been cast upon the
Scottish origin of the family, but Kant himself tells us that his
grandfather, “at the end of the last… century (I know not for what
cause) emigrated from Scotland to Prussia.” 1 His father, Johann Georg
Cant, married Anna Reuter; Immanuel (i.e., God with us) was the fourth
of their eleven children. He took his Christian name from the saint of
his birth day; he changed his sur- name from Cant to Kant to prevent the
Germans from pronouncing it “Tsant.” 2 All the family was brought up in
the Pietist sect, which, like Eng - lish Methodism, stressed faith,
repentance, and immediate appeal to God, as against the orthodox
Lutheran worship in church with a mediating priest.</p>
<p>A Pietist preacher had established at Konigsberg a Collegium
Frederici- anum; Immanuel attended this from his eighth to his sixteenth
year. The school day began at 5:30 a.m. with a half hour of prayer;
every class hour ended with prayer; an hour every morning was devoted to
religious instruc- tion, with emphasis on the fires of hell; history was
taught chiefly from the Old Testament, Greek solely from the New. Sunday
was given largely to religious devotions. It was an education that
produced virtue in some of its graduates, hypocrisy in others, and
perhaps a somber spirit in most. Kant</p>
<p>53 1</p>
<p>53 2 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>later resented this heavy dose of piety and terror; fear and
trembling, he said, overcame him when he recalled those days. 3</p>
<p>In 1740 he moved on to the University of Konigsberg. Here his
favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen, who, though a Pietist, introduced
Kant to the “rationalism” of Wolff. Knutzen had read the English deists;
he condemned them but he discussed them, and he left some deistic doubts
in at least one pupil. When, after six years at the university, Kant was
invited to enter the Lutheran ministry, he refused despite the promise
of early advancement to a comfortable post. 4 Instead, for nine years,
he lived in poverty, tutoring in private families, and continuing to
study. His interest till 1770 was rather in science than in theology.
Lucretius was one of his favorite authors. 5</p>
<p>In 1755 Kant received the doctoral degree, and was allowed to lecture
in the university as a Frivatdozent, or private teacher, recompensed
only by such fees as his students chose to pay. He continued in that
insecure status for fifteen years. Twice in that long novitiate his
applications for a profes- sorship were rejected. He remained poor,
moving from one boardinghouse to another, never daring to marry, never
having a home of his own till he was fifty-nine. 6 He lectured on a wide
variety of topics, probably to attract a greater range of students, and
he had to make himself clear in order to sur- vive. Kant as a teacher
must have been quite different from Kant the author, so famous for
obscurity. Herder, who was one of his pupils (1762-64), de- scribed him
thirty years later with grateful memory:</p>
<p>I have had the good fortune to know a philosopher who was my teacher.
In the prime of life he possessed the joyous courage of youth, and this
also, as I believe, attended him to extreme old age. His open,
thoughtful brow was the seat of untroubled cheerfulness and joy, his
conversation was full of ideas and most suggestive. He had at his
service jest, witticism, and humorous fancy, and his lectures were at
once instructive and most entertaining. With the same spirit in which he
criticized Leibniz, Wolff, Baumgarten,… and Hume, he investigated the
natural laws of Newton, Kepler, and the physicists. In the same way he
took up the writings of Rousseau…. No cabal or sect, no prejudice or
reverence for a name, had the slightest influence with him in opposition
to the extension and promotion of truth. He encouraged and gently
compelled his hearers to think for themselves; despotism was foreign to
his disposition. This man, whom I name with the greatest gratitude and
reverence, is Immanuel Kant; his image stands before me, and is dear to
me. 7</p>
<p>If we were to remember Kant chiefly by his work before his
fifty-seventh year (1781), we should think of him as rather a scientist
than a philosopher — though these two terms were not yet separate. His
first published work, Gedanken von der wahren Schdtzung der lebendigen
Krdfte ( Thoughts on the True Evaluation of Dynamic Forces , 1747), is a
learned discussion of whether the force of a body in motion is to be
measured (as Descartes and Euler held) by mv, the mass times the
velocity, or (as Leibniz held) by mv 1 , the mass times the square of
the velocity; a remarkable performance for a lad of twenty-three. Seven
years later came an essay on whether the time of the earth’s daily
rotation is altered by the ebb and flow of the tides. In the same year
Kant published Die Frage, ob die Welt veralte ( The Question</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>533</p>
<p>Whether the Earth Is Aging ) ; here we have our modern solicitude
over the sun’s daily loss of energy and the future congealing of our
earth.</p>
<p>In a brilliant treatise of 1755, Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und
Theorie des Himmels , the venturesome youth of thirty- one offered “a
general history of nature and theory of the heavens.” It was published
anonymously and was dedicated to Frederick the Great; perhaps Kant
feared trouble from the theologians and hoped for protection from the
King. He reduced all the operations of earth and sky to mechanical laws,
but argued that the result, by its co-ordination and beauty, proved the
existence of a supreme intelli- gence. To explain the origin of the
solar system Kant proposed his “nebular hypothesis”:</p>
<p>I assume that all the material of our solar system… was, at the
beginning of all things, decomposed into its primary elements, and
filled the whole space… in which the bodies formed out of it now
revolve…. In space so filled, a universal repose could last only a
moment…. The scattered elements of a denser kind, by their attractive
force, gather from… around them all the matter of less specific gravity;
these elements themselves, together with the material which they have
united with them, collect in those points where par- ticles of a still
denser kind are found; these in like manner join still denser particles,
and so on….</p>
<p>But nature has other forces,… by which these particles repel one
another, and which, by their conflict with attractions, bring forth that
movement which is, as it were, the lasting life of nature…. This force
of repulsion is mani- fested in the elasticity of vapors, the effluence
of strong-smelling bodies, and the diffusion of all spirituous matters.
It is by this force that the elements, which may be falling to the point
that attracts them, are turned sideways… from their movement in a
straight line; and their perpendicular fall thereby issues in a circular
movement around the center to which they are falling. 8 Kant believed
that all the stars had been gathered — or were being gathered — into
such systems of planets and suns; and he added a significant phrase: u
Die Schopfung ist niemals vollendet”— creation is never complete; it is
ever going on. 9</p>
<p>This nebular hypothesis of 1755, as well as its emendation by Laplace
(1796), is as rich in difficulties as most subsequent theories of
origins; yet in the judgment of a famous living astronomer, “Kant’s
treatise on cosmogony was, I believe, the finest objective summary of
science up to that time.” 10 For us the significance of the essay is in
its indication that Kant was no mys- tic metaphysician but a man
fascinated by science, and struggling to recon- cile scientific method
with religious belief. This is the essence of his labors to the end.</p>
<p>In 1756, stirred like Voltaire to the depths of his philosophy by the
Lisbon disaster of 1755, Kant published three essays on earthquakes, and
one on a theory of winds. In 1757 he issued an “Outline and Announcement
of a Course of Lectures on Physical Geography”; and in 1758, a “New
Doctrine of Motion and Rest.” Then, his interest widening, he sent to
the press short treatises on optimism (1759), the syllogism (1762), and
“diseases of the head” (1764)— here suggesting that the increasing
division of labor might by</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>monotonous repetitions produce insanity. In 1763 he moved into
theology with a treatise, The Only Possible Ground for Proving the
Existence of God; obviously he was uncomfortable over the tottering of
his religious faith. In 1764, eight ye ars after Burke’s similar
disquisition, he offered Ob - servations on the Feeling of the Beautiful
and the Sublime.</p>
<p>At times he thought of extending his evolutionary cosmogony to
biology; he was familiar with the idea that new forms had evolved from
older ones through changes in the conditions of life; 11 and he accepted
the view that the human anatomy was originally adapted to four-legged
locomotion. 12 Yet he drew back from a fully mechanistic biology. “I
also have at times steered into the gulf, assuming here blind natural
mechanics as the ground of ex- planation, and I believed I could
discover a passage to the simple and natural conception. But I
constantly made shipwreck of reason, and I have there- fore preferred to
venture upon the boundles s ocean of ideas.” 13 Rudolph Raspe (author of
Baron Munchausen’s Travels ) had recently discovered, and had in 1765
published, Leibniz’ long -lost Nouveaux Essais sur Ventende- ment humain
; Kant could read this in French; it shared in turning him to- ward
epistemology. He did not quite abandon his interest in science; as late
as 1785 he composed an essay On Volcanoes in the Moon. But the internal
conflict between his scientific studies and his inherited theology
impelled him to seek a reconciliation in philosophy.</p>
<p>Probably his new direction was caused in part by the offer (1770) of
a professorship in logic and metaphysics. The salary was small for a man
of forty-six — 167 thalers per year, rising slowly to 225 in 1786;
incidental serv- ices as “senator” and “senior of the faculty” raised
this in 1789 to 726 thalers. Custom required a newly appointed professor
to deliver in Latin an inaugu- ral discourse. Kant chose a difficult
subject — De Mundi sensibilis et intelligi- bilis Forma et Principiis
(On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World).
Kant used the Scholastic terminology that still pre- vailed in the
German universities. By “sensible world” he meant the world as perceived
by the senses; he would later call this also the phenomenal world, or
world of appearances. By “intelligible world” he meant the world as
conceived by the intellect or reason; this he would later call the “nou
- menal,” or thinkable, world. We seek to understand the sensible world
by applying to it the subjective concepts of space and time through
mathematics and the sciences; we seek to understand the conceivable
world by going be- yond the senses, through intellect and metaphysics,
to the supersensual sources and causes of the sensible world. Here Kant
already laid down his basic theses: that space and time are not
objective or sensible objects, but are forms of perception inherent in
the nature and structure of the mind; and that the mind is no passive
recipient and product of sensations, but is an active agent — with
inherent modes and laws of operation — for transforming sensations into
ideas.</p>
<p>Kant considered this seminal dissertation as “the text on which
something further is to be said in the following work.” This statement,
in a letter of 1771 to Marcus Herz, shows that the philosopher was
already planning the</p>

<p>KANT</p>
<p>535</p>
<p>Kritik der reinen Verminft. After twelve years of work on that
immense treatise he gave it to the world in 1781, dedicated to Karl von
Zedlitz, min- ister of education and ecclesiastical affairs under
Frederick the Great. Ze’d- litz, like the King, was a child of the
Aufklarung, and supported the free- dom of the press. His protection
would be precious if the theologians should perceive, behind Kant’s
esoteric vocabulary and apparently orthodox con - clusions, one of the
most destructive analyses that the Christian theology has ever
received.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, 1 78 1</li>
</ol>
<p>If the world finds this book difficult, it may be because of Kant’s
method of work. He wrote to Moses Mendelssohn (August 16, 1783) that
though the volume was “the result of reflection which occupied me for at
least twelve years, I brought it to completion in the greatest haste
within four or five months, giving the closest attention to the
contents, but with little thought of the exposition, or of rendering it
easy of comprehension by the reader — a decision which I have never
regretted, since otherwise, had I longer delayed and sought to give it a
more popular form, the work would probably never have been completed at
all.” 14 Clarity takes time, and Kant was not sure that he had the time.
He deliberately omitted illustrative exam- ples lest they swell his
book; “these are necessary only from a popular point of view, and this
work can never be made suitable for popular consump- tion.” 15 So he
wrote for the trade, and trusted to others to dilute him into
digestibility. Though Christian von Wolff had preceded him in writing
phi- losophy in German, that language was still crude in phrasing shades
of thought, and it had not established a technical terminology. At
almost every step Kant had to invent a German translation of a Latin
term, and in many cases even Latin lacked terms for the distinctions and
subtleties he wished to express. He confused his readers by giving new
meanings to old words, and sometimes forgetting his redefinitions. The
first hundred pages are toler- ably clear; the rest is a philosophical
conflagration in which the untutored reader will see nothing but
smoke.</p>
<p>The title itself needed clarification. Who could have known that
Kritik der reinen Vernunft meant a critical and judicial examination of
reason as independent of experience? Kritik meant not only analysis and
exposition, it also meant judgment, as in its Greek parent krinein, to
judge. Kant proposed to describe sensation, perception, idea, and
reason, and to set, for each of these, its proper bounds and
jurisdiction. Further, he hoped to show that reason can give us
knowledge independently of any confirmatory experi- ence, as when we
know that six times six equals thirty-six, or that an effect must have a
cause. These are examples of “pure reason”— i.e., of a priori knowledge
— i.e., of knowledge requiring no experiential proof. “The faculty of
knowledge from a priori principles may be called pure reason, and the
general investigation of its possibility and bounds [constitutes] the
critique of pure reason.” 16 Kant believed that such an investigation
would involve all</p>
<p>53&lt;5</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>he problems of metaphysics, and he was confident that “there is not a
sin gle metaphysical problem which has not been solved, or for the
solution of which the key at least has not been supplied” in this
Critique. 1 ’’ He thought that his only danger was “not that of being
refuted, but of not being under - stood.” 18</p>
<p>What had drawn him into so heroic an adventure? One might have sup-
posed that the exaltation of reason by the French Enlightenment — the
as- sumption of the philosophes that faith must submit to reason — and
the havoc so inflicted upon Christian theology, had been the provocative
cause of Kant’s determination to study the origin, operation, and limits
of reason. That motive played its part, as stated in Kant’s preface to
the second edi - tion; 19 but that same preface made it clear that his
chosen enemy was all “dogmatism” whatever— i.e., all systems of thought,
orthodox or heretical, evolved by an unscrutinized reason. He named as
“the greatest of all dog - matical philosophers” Christian von Wolff,
who had undertak en to prove the doctrines of Christianity, and the
philosophy of Leibniz, by reason alone. All attempts to demonstrate the
truth or falsity of religion by pure reason were, to Kant, forms of
dogmatism; and he condemned as “the dogmatism of metaphysics” any system
of science or philosophy or theology that had not first submitted to a
critical examination of reason itself.</p>
<p>He accused his own thinking, till 1770, as guilty of such dogmatism.
From such unscrutinized speculations, he tells us, he was awakened by
reading Hume — probably the Enquiry concerning the Human Understanding ,
of which a German translation had appeared in 1755. Hume had argued that
all reasoning depended upon the notion of cause; that in actual
experience we perceive not causation but only sequence; and that
therefore all science, phi- losophy, and theology rest on an idea —
cause — which turns out to be an in- tellectual supposition, not a
perceived reality. “I freely admit,” wrote Kant, “it was David Hume’s
remark that first, many years ago, interrupted my dogmatic slumber and
gave a completely different direction to my inquiries in the field of
speculative philosophy.” 20 How could the concept of cause be rescued
from the lowly status of uncertain supposition in which Hume had left
it? Only, said Kant, by showing that it is a priori, independent of
experience, one of those categories, or forms of thought, which, though
not necessarily innate, are part of the inherent structure of the mind.
# So he set himself to overcome both the dogmatism of Wolff and the
skepticism of Hume by a criticism — a critical examination — that would
at once describe, delimit, and restore the authority of reason. These
three stages — dogmatism, skepticism, criticism — were, in Kant’s view,
the three ascending phases in the evolution of modern philosophy.</p>
<p>Loving definitions, distinctions, and classifications, using long
words to shorten speech, Kant divided all knowledge into empirical
(dependent upon</p>
<p>In a letter to Garv e, 1798, Kant gave a later explanation of his
“awakening”: “The antinomies of pure reason [the difficulties involved
in either believing or disbelieving in God, free will, or immortality]…
first aroused me from my dogmatic slumber and drove me to a critique of
reason.” 21</p>

<p>KANT</p>
<p>537</p>
<p>experience) and transcendental (independent of, and therefore
transcending, experience). He agreed that all knowledge begins with
experience, in the sense that some sensation must precede and arouse the
operations of thought; but he believed that the moment experience begins
it is molded by the struc- ture of the mind through its inherent forms
of “intuition” (perception) or conception. The inherent forms of
“intuition” are the universal forms that experience takes in our outward
sensation as space, and in our inward sensi- bility as time.</p>
<p>Likewise there are inherent forms of conception or thought, which are
in- dependent of experience and mold it; Kant called them categories,
and divided them with fond and suspicious symmetry into four triplets:
three categories of quantity — unity, plurality, and totality; three
categories of quality — reality, negation, and limitation; three twin
categories of relation- substance and quality, cause and effect,
activity and passivity; and three twin categories of modality —
possibility and impossibility, existence and nonexist- ence, necessity
and contingency. Every perception falls into one or more of these basic
forms or molds of thought. Perception is sensation interpreted by the
inherent forms of space and time; knowledge is perception transformed by
the categories into a judgment or an idea. Experience is not a passive
ac- ceptance of objective impressions upon our senses; it is the product
of the mind actively working upon the raw material of sensation.</p>
<p>Kant tried to counter Hume’s skepticism of causation by making the
cause - and-effect relation not an objective reality but an intrinsic
form of thought; as such it is independent of experience, and is not
subject to the uncertainty of empirical ideas. Yet it is a necessary
part of all experience, since we cannot understand experience without
it. Hence “the concept of cause involves the character of necessity,
which no experience can yield.” 22 Kant supposed that by this
leger-de-plume he had saved science from that humiliating limita- tion
to probability to which Hume had condemned it. Indeed, he argued, it is
the human mind, and not nature, that establishes the universal “laws of
nature,” by endowing some of our generalizations— like those of mathe-
matics — with qualities of universality and necessity not objectively
perceived. “We ourselves introduce tha t order and regularity in the
appearance which we entitle ‘nature.’ We could never find them in
appearances had we not our - selves, by the nature of our own mind,
originally set them there.” 23 The “laws of nature” are not objective
entities but mental constructs useful in handling experience.</p>
<p>All knowledge takes the form of ideas. In this sense the idealist is
right: the world, for us, is merely our ideas. Since we know matter only
as and through ideas, materialism is logically impossible, for it
attempts to reduce the directly known (ideas) to the unknown or
indirectly known. But the idealist is wrong if he believes that nothing
exists except our ideas; for we know that ideas can be produced by
sensations, and we cannot explain all sensations without assuming, for
many of them, an external cause. As our knowledge is limited to
phenomena or appearances — i.e., to the form the external cause takes
after being molded by our modes of perception and con- ception — we can
never know the objective nature of that external cause ; 24 it</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>must remain for us a mysterious Ding-an-sich, a thing-in- itself, a
“noumenon” conceived but never perceived. The external world exists, but
in its ultimate reality it is unknowable. 25</p>
<p>The soul too is real but unknowable. We never perceive it as an
entity additional to the mental states that we perceive; it too is a
noumenon, neces- sarily conceived as the reality behind the individual
self, the moral sense, and the forms and processes of the mind. The
sense of self mingles with every mental state, and provides continuity
and personal identity. The conscious- ness of self (“apperception”) is
the most intimate of all our experiences; and</p>
<p>We cannot prove by pure or theoretical reason (as Wolff tried to do)
that the individual soul is immortal, or that the will is free, or that
God ex- ists; but neither can we by pure reason disprove these beliefs
(as some skeptics thought to do). Reason and the categories are equipped
to deal only with phenomena or appearances, external or internal; we
cannot apply them to the thing-in-itself — the reality behind sensations
or the soul behind ideas. When we try to prove or disprove the dogmas of
faith we fall into “para - logisms” (fallacies) or “antinomies”—
inherent contradictions. We end in equal absurdities if we hold that the
world had or had not a beginning; that the will is or is not free; or
that a necessary or supreme being does or does not exist. Kant expressed
with unwonted eloquence the argument from de- sign , 28 but he concluded
that “the utmost that the argument can prove is an architect… who is
always very much hampered by the adaptability of the material in which
he works, not a creator… to whose idea everything is subject.” 28</p>
<p>And yet how can we rest content with so baffling a conclusion — that
free will, immortality, and God can be neither proved nor disproved by
pure reason? There is (Kant urges) something in us deeper than reason,
and that is our irrefutable consciousness that consciousness, mind, and
soul are not material, and that the will is in some measure, however
mysteriously and il- logically, free; and we cannot be long content to
think of the world as a senseless sequence of evolution and dissolution
without moral significance or inherent mind. How can we justify our will
to believe? Partly (says Kant) by the intellectual usefulness of belief
— by its offering us some guidance in the interpretation of phenomena,
as well as some philosophical sanity and re- ligious peace.</p>
<p>The things of the world must be viewed as if they received their
existence from a highest intelligence. The idea [of God] is thus really
a heuristic, not an ostensive, concept [it is an assumption helpful to
discovery and understanding, but it is not a demonstration]…. In the
domain of theology we must view everything as if the sum of all
appearances (the sensible world itself) had a single, highest, and
all-sufficient ground beyond itself — namely, a self-subsistent.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>original, creative reason. For it is in the light of this idea of a
creative reason that we so guide the empirical employment of our reason
as to secure its great- est possible extension…. The only determinate
concept which the purely speculative reason gives us of God is, in the
strictest sense, deistic; that is, reason does not determine the
objective validity of such a concept, but yields only the idea of
something which is the ground of the highest and necessary unit of all
empirical reality. 30</p>
<p>But a more imperative reason for religious belief, in Kant’s view, is
that su ch belief is indispensable to morality. “If there is no
primordial being dis - tinct from the world, if the world is… without an
Author, if our will is not free, if the soul is… perishable like matter,
then moral ideas and prin- ciples lose all validity.” 31 If moral
character and social order are not to depend entirely on fear of the
law, we must support religious belief, if only as a regu- lative
principle; we must act as if we knew that there is a God, that our souls
are immortal, that our wills are free. 32 Moreover, as an aid to thought
and morals, “we are justified in representing the cause of the world in
terms of a subtle anthropomorphism (without which we could not think
anything whatever in regard to it), namely, as a being that has
understanding, feel- ings of pleasure and displeasure, and desires and
volitions corresponding to these.” 33</p>
<p>So the famous Critique concludes, leaving opposite schools of thought
comforted and displeased. The skeptics could argue that Kant had
justified agnosticism, and could scorn his reinstatement of God as a
supplement to the police. The buffeted theologians reproached him for
admitting so much to the infidels, and rejoiced that religion had
apparently survived its perilous passage through Kant’s labyrinthine
mind. In 1786 Karl Reinhold described the turmoil:</p>
<p>The Critique of Pure Reason has been proclaimed by the dogmatists as
the attempt of a skeptic who undermines the certainty of all knowledge;
by the skeptics as a piece of arrogant presumption that undertakes to
erect a new form of dogmatism upon the ruins of previous systems; by the
supematuralists as a subtly plotted artifice to displace the historical
foundations of religion, and to establish naturalism without polemic; by
the naturalists as a new prop for the dying philosophy of faith; by the
materialists as an idealistic contradiction of the reality of matter; by
the spiritualists as an unjustifiable limitation of all knowledge to the
corporeal world, concealed under the name of the domain of experience..
, 34</p>
<p>Almost all these schools of thought attacked the book, giving it fame
if only as a succes de scandale. Even its difficulty exalted it, making
it a challenge that every up-to-date mind had to meet. Soon the
sesquipedalia verba of Kant were in every learned mouth.</p>
<p>He could not understand why his critics could not understand him. Had
he not defined every basic term over and over again? (Yes, and how vari-
ously!) In 1783 he answered the attacks by rephrasing the Critique in
what he thought was a simpler form; and he defiantly entitled his
rejoinder Pro- legomena to Every Future Metaphysic That Will Be Able to
Appear as</p>
<p>54° ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XXI</p>
<p>Science. Before his Critique, he claimed, there had been no real
metaphysics at all, for no system had prefaced itself with a critical
scrutiny of its instru- ment-reason. If some readers could not
understand the Kritik, that might be because th ey were not quite up to
it; “in such a case one should apply one’s mental gifts to another
object”; after all, “there is no need for everybody to study
metaphysics.” 35 The old professor had humor and pride, and temper too.
As it proceeded, the Prolegomena became as difficult as the Critique.
The controversy continued under the tolerant regime of Frederick the
Great. Kant had written in the Critique some eloquent passages on the
no- bility of reason, and its right to freedom of expression. 36 In
1784, still relying on protection by Frederick and Zedlitz, he published
an essay entitled Was ist Aufklarung? He defined the Enlightenment as
freedom and independence of thought, and took as his motto and counsel
Sapere aude — ’Dare to know.” He regretted that intellectual liberation
was so retarded by the conservatism of the majority. “If we ask whether
we live in an enlightened [ aufgeklart ] age, the answer is no”; we live
only “in an age of enlightening” ( Aufkldr - ung ). He hailed Frederick
as the embodiment and protector of the German Enlightenment, as the one
monarch who had told his subjects, “Reason as you will.” 37</p>
<p>This may have been written in the hope that Frederick’s successor
would keep to the policy of toleration. But Frederick William II
(1786-97) was more interested in the power of the state than in the
freedom of the mind. When a second edition of the Critique of Pure
Reason was prepared (1787) Kant modified some passages, and tried to
soften his heresies with an apolo- getic preface: “I have found it
necessary to deny knowledge [of things in themselves] in order to make
room for faith…. Criticism alone can sever the root of materialism,
fatalism, atheism, freethinking, fanaticism, and super- stition.” 38 He
had reason for caution. On July 9, 1788, Johann Christian von Wollner,
“minister for the Lutheran Department,” issued a Religions edikt which
explicitly rejected religious toleration as responsible for the
loosening of morals, and threatened with expulsion from their pulpits or
chairs all preachers or teachers who deviated from orthodox
Christianity. It was in this atmosphere of reaction that Kant published
his second Critique.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON, 1788</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the first Critique had argued that pure reason could not prove
the freedom of the will, and since, in Kant’s view, morality required
such free - dom, the operations of reason seemed to have left morality,
like theology, without a rational basis. Worse yet, the Enlightenment
had sapped the reli- gious foundation of morals by questioning the
existence of a rewarding and punishing God. How could civilization
survive if these traditional supports of morality collapsed? Kant felt
that he himself, as an avowed disciple of the Aufklarung, was obligated
to find some rational ground for a moral code. In a preliminary essay,
Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>541</p>
<p>( Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, 1785), he rejected the
attempt of freethinkers to base morality upon the experience of the
individual or the race; such an a posteriori derivation would deprive
moral principles of that universality and absoluteness which, in his
judgment, a sound ethic required. With characteristic self- confidence
he announced: “It is clear that all moral conceptions have their seat
and origin completely a priori in the reason.” 39 His second major work,
Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, proposed to find and elucidate that
seat and origin. It would analyze the a priori elements in morality as
the first Critique had analyzed the a priori elements in knowledge.</p>
<p>Every individual (Kant argues) has a conscience, a sense of duty, a
con- sciousness of a commanding moral law. “Two things fill the mind
with ever new and increasing admiration and awe… : the starry heavens
above, and the moral law within.” 40 This moral consciousness often
conflicts with our sensual desires, but we recognize that it is a higher
element in us than the pursuit of pleasure. It is not the product of
experience, it is a part of our in- herent psychological structure, like
the categories; it is an internal tribunal present in every person in
every race. 41 And it is absolute; it commands us unconditionally,
without exception or excuse, to do the right for its own sake, as an end
in itself, not as a means to happiness or reward or some other good. Its
imperative is categorical.</p>
<p>That categorical imperative takes two forms. “Act so that the maxim
of thy will can always hold good as a principle of universal
legislation”; act in such a way that if all others should act like you,
everything would be well; this [variation of the G olden Rule] is the
“fundamental law of the pure prac - tical reason,” 42 and is “the
formula of an absolutely good will.” 43 In a second formulation, “So act
as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person or in that of any
other, in every case as an e nd, never only as a means,” 44 Kant pro -
claimed a principle more revolutionary than anything in the American or
French declaration of the rights of man.</p>
<p>The sense of moral obligation is additional evidence for some freedom
of the will. How could we have this consciousness of duty if we were not
free to do or not to do, if our actions were merely links in an
unbreakable chain of mechanical cause and effect? Without free will
personality is meaning- less; if personality is meaningless, so is life;
and if life is meaningless, so is the universe. 45 Kant recognizes the
apparently inescapable logic of determinism; and how can a free choice
intervene in an objective world which (he con- fesses) is apparently
governed by mechanical laws? 46 His reply is a master- piece of
obscurity. Mechanical law, he reminds us, is a mental construct, a
scheme which the mind, through its category of causality, imposes upon
the world of space and time as a device for dealing with it
consistently. Since we have limited the categories to the world of
phenomena, and since we have admitted that we do not know the nature of
the noumenal world — the thing- in-itself behind the phenomena — we
cannot assume that the laws which we construct for the phenomena hold
also for the ultimate reality. And as we have admitted that we know, in
ourselves, only the phenomenal self — only the world of perceptions and
ideas — and do not know the nature of the inner</p>
<p>542 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>and noumenal soul, we cannot assume that the laws of cause and effect
that seem to govern the actions of our bodies (including our brains)
apply also to the volitions of the ultimate spiritual reality behind our
mental processes. Behind the mechanisms of the phenomenal world of space
and of ideas in time there may be freedom in the spaceless and timeless
noumenal world of ulti- mate outer or inner reality. Our actions and
ideas are determined once they enter the world of perceivable physical
or mental events; they may still be free in their origin in the
unperceivable soul; “in this way freedom and nature</p>
<p>After all (says Kant), why should we not give primacy to the
practical over the speculative reason? Science, which seems to reduce us
to automata, is ultimately a speculation — a gamble on the permanent
validity of conclusions and methods that are always changing. We are
justified in feeling that the will in man is more basic than the
intellect; the intellect is an instrument forged by the will for dealing
with the external and mechanical world; it should not be the master of
the personality that uses it. 48</p>
<p>But if the moral sense warrants us in assuming a measure of free
will, it also warrants us in believing in the immortality of the soul.
For our moral sense urges us on to a perfection that is repeatedly
frustrated by our sensual impulses; we cannot achieve this perfection in
our short earthly life; we must assume, if there is any justice in the
world, that we shall be granted, for our moral fulfillment, a continued
life after death. If this also assumes that a just God exists, this too
is warranted by practical reason. Earthly happiness does not always
accord with virtue; we feel that somewhere the balance between virtue
and happiness will be restored; and this is possible only by supposing
that there is a deity who will effect this reconciliation. “Accordingly
the existence of a cause of all nature, distinct from nature itself, and
containing the principle of… the exact harmony of happiness with
morality, is also postulated” by the practical reason. 49</p>
<p>Kant inverted the usual procedure: instead of deriving the moral
sense and code from God (as the theologians had done), he deduced God
from the moral sense. We must conceive our duties not as “arbitrary
ordinances of a foreig n will, but as essential laws of every free will
in itself”; however, since that will and God both belong to the noumenal
world, we should accept these duties as divine commands. “We shall not
look upon [moral] actions as obligatory because they are commands of
God, but we shall regard them as divine commands because we have an
inward obligation to them.” 50</p>
<p>If all this will-ful thinking is slightly obscure, it may be because
Kant was not very enthusiastic about his attempt to reconcile Voltaire
with Rousseau. The Critique of Pure Reason had gone even further than
Voltaire in con- fessing that pure reason cannot prove free will,
immortality, or God. But Kant had found in Rousseau’s d octrines — of
the weakness of reason, the pri- macy of feeling, and the derivation of
religion from man’s moral sense— a possible escape from agnosticism,
moral disintegration, and Wollner’s police.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>He thought that Roussea u had awakened him from “dogmatic slumber” in
ethics as Hume had done in metaphysics. 51 The first Critique belonged
to the Aufklarung; the second belonged to the Romantic movement; the
attempt to combine both was one of the subtlest performances in the
history of philoso- phy. Heine credited the attempt to solicitude for
popular needs: the professor saw his faithful servant Lampe weeping over
the death of God; “then Im - manuel Kant had compassion, and showed
himself not only a great philoso- pher b ut also a good man, and half
kindly, half ironically he said: ‘Old Lampe must have a God, or he
cannot be happy;… for my part the practical rea- son may, then,
guarantee the existence of God.’” 52</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>CRITIQUE OF JUDGMENT, 1790</li>
</ol>
<p>Kant himself must have been dissatisfied with his arguments, for in a
Kritik der Urteilskraft he returned to the problem of mechanism versus
free will, and advanced to the conflict between mechanism and design; to
which he added complex dissertations on beauty, sublimity, genius, and
art. It is not an appetizing brew.</p>
<p>Urteilskraft — the power of judgment — “is in general the faculty of
thinking the particular as contained in the universal”; it is the act of
bringing an ob - ject, idea, or event under a class, or principle, or
law. The first Critique had tried to bring all ideas under the a priori
universal categories; the second had sought to bring all ethical
concepts under a universal a priori moral sense; the third undertook to
find a priori principles for our aesthetic judgments — of order, beauty,
or sublimity in nature or art. 53 “I venture to hope that the difficulty
of unraveling a problem so involved in its nature may serve as an excuse
for a certain amount of hardly avoidable obscurity i n its solution.”
54</p>
<p>“Dogmatic” philosophy had attempted to find an objective element in
beauty; Kant feels that here, especially, the subjective element is
pre-eminent. Nothing is beautiful or sublime but feeling makes it so. We
ascribe beauty to any object the contemplation of which gives us
disinterested pleasure — i.e., a pleasure free from all personal desire;
so we derive aesthetic, but no other, satisfaction from a sunset, a
Raphael, a cathedral, a flower, a concerto, or a song. But why do
certain objects or experiences give us this disinterested pleasure?
Probably because we see in them a union of parts functioning suc-
cessfully in a harmonious whole. In the case of the sublime we are
pleased by grandeur or power that does not threaten us; so we feel
sublimity in the sky or the sea, but not if their turbulence endangers
us.</p>
<p>Our appreciation of beauty or sublimity is increased by accepting
teleol- ogy — i.e., by recognizing in organisms an inherent adaptation
of parts to the needs of the whole, and by feeling in nature a divine
wisdom behind the co- ordination and harmony, the grandeur and power.
And yet science aims at just the opposite — to show that all objective
nature operates through mechan- ical laws, without submission to any
external design. How can w@v reconcile these two approaches to nature?
By accepting both mechanism and teleology</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>insofar as they help us as “heuristic” principle s — as assumptions
that facilitate understanding or research. The mechanical principle
helps us most in investi- gating inorganic substances; the teleological
principle serves best in studying organisms. In these there are powers
of growth and reproduction that baffle mechanical explanation; there is
a visible adaptation of parts to the purposes of the organ or the
organism, as of the claws for grasping and of the eyes for sight. It
would be wise to recognize that neither mechanism nor design can be
shown to be universally true. In a sense science itself is teleological,
since it assumes an intelligible order, regularity, and unity in nature,
as if a divine mind had organized it and sustains it. 55</p>
<p>Kant acknowledged many difficulties in viewing man and the world as
products of divine design.</p>
<p>The first thing that would have to be expressly arranged in a system
ordered with a view to a final whole of natural beings on the earth
would be their habitat — the soil or element on or in which they are
intended to thrive. But a more intimate knowledge of the nature of this
basic condition of all organic production shows no trace of any causes
but those acting altogether without design, and in fact tending toward
destruction rather than calculated to pro- mote genesis of forms, order,
and ends. Land and sea not only contain memori- als of mighty primeval
disasters that have overtaken them and all their brood of living forms,
but their entire structure — the strata of the land and the coast lines
of the sea — has all the appearances of being the outcome of the wild
and all- subduing forces of a nature working in a state of chaos. 58</p>
<p>And yet again, if we abandon all notion of design in nature we take
all moral meaning out of life; life becomes a silly succession of
painful births and agonizing deaths, in which, for the individual, the
nation, and the race, noth- ing is certain except defeat. We must
believe in some divine design if only to maintain our sanity. And since
teleology proves merely a struggling artifi- cer instead of a divine and
omnipotent benevolence, we must rest our faith in life upon a moral
sense that has no warrant except through belief in a just God. With that
creed we may believe — though we cannot prove — that the just man is the
final end of creation, the noblest product of the grand and mysterious
design. 57</p>
<p>V. RELIGION AND REASON, 1 793</p>
<p>Kant was never content with his hesitant as if theology. In 1791, in
a little book On the Failure of All Philosophical Attempts at Theodicy ,
he repeated that “our reason is altogether incapable of giving insight
into the relation be - tween the world… and the highest Wisdom.” He
added a caution, per - haps to himself: “The philosopher should not play
the part of a spe cial pleader in this matter; he should not defend any
cause whose justice he is unable to grasp, and which he cannot prove by
means of the modes of thought peculiar to philosophy.” 58</p>
<p>He returned to the problem again in a series of essays which brought
him into open defiance of the Prussian government. The first of them,
“On Radi -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXl)</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>cal Evil,” was printed in the Berliner Monatsschrift for April, 1792.
The censor allowed its publication on the ground that “only deep
-thinking schol- ars read the writings of Kant,” 59 but he refused to
allow the second essay, “On the Contest between the Good and Evil
Principles for the Control of Man.” Kant resorted to a st ratagem.
German universities had the privilege of sanctioning books and articles
for publication; Kant submitted the second, third, and fourth essays to
the philosophical faculty at the University of Jena (then controlled by
Goethe and Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar, and having Schiller on its
staff) ; the faculty gave its imprimatur; and with this all four essays
were printed at Konigsberg in 1793 under the title Die Reli- gion
innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft ( Religion within the Lim-
its of Reason Alone ).</p>
<p>The first lines announce the pervading theme: “So far as morality is
based upon the conception of man as a free agent, who, just because he
is free, blinds himself through his reason to unconditioned laws, it
stands in need neither of the idea of another Being over him for him to
apprehend his duty, nor of an incentive, other than the law itself, for
him to do it…. Hence for its own sake morality does not need religion at
all.” 60 Kant promises obedience to the authorities, and admits the need
of censorship, but he urges that censorship “shall create no disturbance
in the field of the sciences.” 61 The invasion of science by theology,
as in the case of Galileo, “might arrest all the endeavors of human
reason…. Philosophical theology… must have complete freedom so far as
its science reaches.” 62</p>
<p>Kant derives the problems of morality from man’s twofold inheritance
of good and evil tendencies. “That a corrupt propensity must indeed be
rooted in man need not be formally proved in view of the multitude of
crying ex- amples which experience… puts before our eyes.” 63 He does
not agree</p>
<p>How did the “radical evil in human nature” begin? Not through
“original sin”; “surely of all the explanat ions of the spread and
propagation of this evil through all members and generations of our
race, the most inept is that which describes it as descending to us as
an inheritance from our first parents.” 66 Probably the “evil”
propensities were strongly r ooted in man by their neces- sity to his
survival in primitive conditions; only in civilization — in organized
society — do they become vices; and there they require not suppression
but control. 67 “Natural inclinations, considered in themselves, are
good , that is, not a matter for reproach; and not only is it futile to
want to exterminate them, but to do so would be harmful and blameworthy.
Rather let them be tamed, and instead of clashing with one another they
can be brought into that harmony in a wh oleness which is called
happiness.” 68</p>
<p>546</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Moral good is also innate, as evidenced by the universal moral sense;
but it is at first only a need, which must be developed by moral
instruction and arduous discipline. The best religion is not one that
excels in the careful observance of ritual worship but rather one that
most influences men toward a moral life. 69 A religion of reason bases
itself not upon a divine revelation, but upon a sense of duty
interpreted as the divinest element in man. 70 Religion may legitimately
organize itself into a church, 71 it may seek to define its creed
through sacred scriptures, it may rightly worship Christ as the most
Godlike of men, it may promise heaven an d threaten hell, 72 and “no
religion can be conceived which involves no belief in a future life.” 73
But it should not be necessary for a Christian to affirm faith in
miracles, or the divinity of Christ, or the atonement, by Christ’s
crucifixion, for th e sins of mankind, or the pre- destination of souls
to heaven or hell by divine grace given with no regard to good or evil
works. 74 It is “necessary carefully to inculcate some forms of prayer
in children (who still stand in need of the letter)”; 75 bu t petitional
“prayer… as a means of [winning divine] grace is a superstitious illu -
sion.” 76</p>
<p>When a church becomes an institution for compelling belief or
worship; when it assumes to itself the sole right to interpret Scripture
and define mo- rality; when it forms a priesthood claiming exclusive
approaches to God and divine grace; when it makes its worship a magic
ritual possessing miraculous powers; when it becomes an arm of the
government and an agent of intel- lectual tyranny; when it seeks to
dominate the state and to use secular rulers as tools of ecclesiastical
ambition — then the free mind will rise against such a church, and will
seek outside of it that “pure religion of reason” which is the pursuit
of the moral life. 77</p>
<p>This last major work of Kant was marked with the vacillation and
obfusca- tion natural to a man who had no passion for imprisonment.
There is much scholastic verbiage in it, some wondrous logic-chopping
and fantastic theol- ogy. The wonder remains that a man of sixty-nine
should still display such vigor of thought and speech, and such courage
in combat with the united powers of church and state. The conflict
between the philosopher and the King came to a head when (October i,
1794) Frederick William II sent him the following “order in
council.”</p>
<p>Our Most High Person has for a long time observed with great
displeasure how you misuse your philosophy to undermine and debase many
of the most important and fundamental doctrines of the Holy Scriptures
and Christianity; how, namely, you have done this in your book, Religion
within the Limits of Reason Alone…. We demand of you immediately a most
conscientious answer, and expect that in the future, toward the
avoidance of our highest disfavor, you will give no such cause for
offense, but rather, in accord with your duty, employ your talents and
authority so that our paternal purpose may be more and more attained. If
you continue to resist you may certainly expect unpleasant consequences
to yourself. 78</p>
<p>Kant gave a propitiatory reply. He pointed out that his writings were
ad- dressed only to scholars and theologians, whose freedom of thought
should</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>be preserved in the interest of the government itself. His book had
admitted the inadequacy of reason to judge the final mysteries of
religious faith. He concluded with a pledge of obedience: “I hereby, as
your Majesty’s most faithful servant, solemnly declare that henceforth I
will entirely refrain from all public statements on religion, both
natural and revealed, either in lectures or in writings.” When the King
died (1797) Kant felt released from his promise; moreover, Frederick
William III dismissed Wollner (1797), abol- ished the censorship, and
repealed the Religionsedikt of 1788. After the battle Kant summed up its
issues in a booklet, Der Streit der Fakultdten ( The Con- flict of the
Faculties , 1798), in which he repeated his claim that academic freedom
was indispensable to the intellectual growth of a society. Essentially
the little professor in a far-ofF corner of the world had won his battle
against a state having the strongest army in Europe. That state was soon
to collapse, but by 1 800 Kant’s books were the most influential in the
intellectual life of Germany.</p>

<li>THE REFORMER</li>
</ol>
<p>He retired from lecturing in 1797 (aged seventy-three), but till 1798
he continued to issue essays on vital themes. Despite his isolation he
kept in touch with world affairs. When the Congress of Basel assembled
in 1795 to arrange peace among Germany, Spain, and France, Kant took the
occasion (as the Abbe de Saint-Pierre had done with the Congress of
Utrecht in 1713) to publish a brochure Zum ewigen Frieden (On Perpetual
Peace ).</p>
<p>He began modestly by describing “eternal peace” as a fit motto for a
cemetery, and assuring statesmen that he did not expect them to take him
as anything more than a “scholastic pedant who can bring no danger to
the st ate.” 79 Then, setting aside as temporizing trivia the articles
of peace signed at Basel, he drew up, as a committee of one, “six
preliminary articles” out - lining the conditions prerequisite to a
lasting peace. Article I outlawed all secret reservations or addenda to
a treaty. Article II forbade the absorption or domination of any
independent state by another. Article III called for the gradual
elimination of standing armies. Article IV held that no state might
“interfere by force with the constitution of another.” Article VI
required that no state at war with any other should “permit such acts of
hostility as would make mutual trust, in case of a future peace,
impossible, such as the employment of assassins or poisoners,… and the
instigation of rebellion in the enemy state.”</p>
<p>Since no durable peace can be made between states that acknowledge no
limits to their sovereignty, persistent efforts must be made to develop
an international order and so provide a legal substitute for war. So
Kant drew up some “definite articles” for a lasting peace. First, “the
constitution of every state must be republican.” Monarchies and
aristocracies tend to fre - quent wars, because the ruler and the nobles
are usually protected from loss to their lives and property in war, and
so engage in it too readily as “the sport of kings”; in a republic “it
rests with the citizens to determine whether</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>war shall be declared or not,” and they will bear the consequences;
hence “it is not likely that the citizens of a state [a republic] would
ever enter on so costly a game.” 80 Second, “all international right
must be grounded upon a federation of free states.” 81 This should not
be a superstate; “indeed, war is not so incurably bad as the deadness of
a universal monarchy.” 82 Each people should determine its own
government, but the separate states (at least of Eu- rope) should unite
in a confederation empowered to govern their external relations. The
ideal never to be abandoned is the practice by states of the same moral
code that they require of their citizens. Could such a venture pos-
sibly produce more evil than the perpetual practice of international
deceit and violence? In the end, Kant hoped, Machiavelli would be proved
wrong; there need be no contradiction between morality and politics;
only “morals can cut the knot which politics cannot unloose.” 83</p>
<p>Kant obviously had delusions about republics (which have joined in
the most terrible wars of all) ; but we should note that by “republic”
he meant con - stitutional government rather than a complete democracy.
He distrusted the wild impulses of unchained men, 84 and feared
universal suffrage as the em- powerment of unlettered majorities over
progressive minorities and noncon- forming individuals. 85 But he
resented hereditary privilege, class arrogance, and the serfdom
encompassing Konigsberg. He welcomed the American Revolution, which, as
he saw it, was creating a federation of independent states along the
lines that he had proposed for Europe. He followed the French Revolution
with almost youthful enthusiasm, even after the Septem- ber Massacres
and the Terror.</p>
<p>But, like nearly all followers of the Enlightenment, he put more
faith in education than in revolution. Here, as in so many fields, he
felt the influence of Rousseau and the Romantic movement. “We must allow
the child from his earliest years perfect liberty in every respect,…
provided that… he does not interfere with the liberty of others.” 86
Soon he hedged on this perfect liberty; some measure of discipline, he
admitted, is necessary in the formation of character; “neglect of
discipline is a greater evil than neglect of culture, for this last can
be remedied later in life.” 87 Work is the best dis - cipline, and
should be required at all stages of education. Moral education is
indispensable, and should begin early. Since human nature contains the
seed of both good and evil, all moral progress depends upon weeding out
the evil and cultivating the good. This should be done not through
rewards and pun- ishments, but by stressing the concept of duty.</p>
<p>Education by the state is no better than education by the church; the
state will seek to make obedient, pliable, patriotic citizens. It would
be better to leave education to private schools led by enlightened
scholars and public- spirited citizens; 88 hence Kant applauded the
principles and schools of Johann Basedow. He deplored the nationalistic
bias of state schools and textbooks, and hoped for a time when all
subjects would be treated impartially. In 1784 he published an essay,
ldeen zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in zveltburger- licher Absicht (
Ideas for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Stand- point)-, it
sketched the progress of mankind from superstition to enlighten-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>KANT</p>
<p>549</p>
<p>ment, allowed only a minor role to religion, and called for
historians who would rise above nationalism.</p>
<p>Like the philosophes, he warmed his heart with faith in progress,
moral as well as intellectual. In 1793 he chided Moses Mendelssohn for
saying that every advance is canceled by retrogression.</p>
<p>Many proofs may be given that the human race on the whole, and
especially in our own as compared with all preceding times, has made
considerable ad- vances morally for the better. Temporary checks do not
prove anything against this. The cry of the continually increasing
degradation in the race arises just from this, that when one stands on a
higher step of morality he sees fur- ther before him, and his judgment
on what men are, as compared with what they ought to be, is more strict.
89</p>
<p>As Kant ent’.red his last decade (1794) his early optimism suffered
darken- ing, perhaps because of reaction in Prussia and the coalition of
the powers against Revolutionary France. He retired into himself, and
secretly wrote that gloomy Opus postumum which was to be his last
testament to mankind.</p>

</ol>
<p>Physically he was one of the smallest men of his time — just a little
above five feet in height, and made still shorter by a forward curvature
of the spine. His lungs were weak, his stomach ailed; he survived only
by a regular and abstemious regimen. It was characteristic of him that
at seventy he wrote an essay “On the Power of the Mind to Master the
Feeling of Illness by Force of Resolution.” He stress ed the wisdom of
breathing through the nose; one could avoid many colds, and other
mishaps, by keeping his mouth shut. 90 So, in his daily walks, he walked
alone, shunning conversation. He went to bed punctually at ten, rose at
five, and in thirty years (he assures us) never overslept. 91 Twice he
thought of marriage, twice he retreated. But he was not unsociable;
usually he invited one or two guests, most often his pupils — never any
woman — to share his dinner at 1 p.m. He was a professor of geography,
but rarely moved outside Konigsberg; he never saw a mountain, and prob-
ably — near though it was — never saw the sea. 92 He was sustained
through pov- erty and censorship by a pride that only outwardly yielded
to any authority other than his own reason. He was generous, but he was
severe in his judg- ments, and lacked that sense of humor which should
save philosophy from taking itself too seriously. His moral sense rose
at times to an ethical pedantry that held all pleasures suspect until
they had proved themselves virtuous. He cared so little for organized
religion that he attended church only when his academic functions
required it. 93 He seems never to have prayed in his m ature life. 94
Herder reported that Kant’s students based their religious skep - ticism
on Kant’s teaching. 95 “It is indeed true,” Kant wrote to Mendelssohn,
“that I think many things with the clearest conviction, and to my great
satis - faction, which I never have the courage to say, but I never say
anything that I do not think.” 96</p>
<p>55 °</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXI</p>
<p>Till his last years he strove to improve his work. In 1798 he told a
friend: “The task with which I now busy myself has to do with the
transition from the metaphysical basis of the natural sciences to
physics. This problem must be solved, or otherwise here is a gap in the
system of critical philosophy.” 97 But in that letter he described
himself as “incapacitated for intellectual work.” He entered into a long
period of physical decline, accumulating ail - ments, and the loneliness
of unmarried old age. He died on February 12, 1 804. He was buried in
the Konigsberg cathedral, in what is now known as the Stoa Kantiana; and
over his grave were inscribed his words, “The starry heavens above me;
the moral law within me.”</p>
<p>At his death he left a confused mass of writings which were published
as his Opus postumum in 1882-84. In one of these he described the “thing
-in- itself”— the unknowable substratum behind phenomena and ideas — as
“not a real thing,… not an existing reality, but merely a principle… of
the synthetic a priori knowledge of the manifold sense- intuition.” 98
He named it a Gedankending, a thing existing only in our thought. And he
applied the same skepticism to the idea of God:</p>
<p>God is not a substance existing outside me, but merely a moral
relation within me…. The categorical imperative does not assume a
substance issuing its commands from on high, conceived therefore as
outside me, but is a com- mandment or a prohibition of my own reason….
The categorical imperative represents human duties as divine
commandments not in the historical sense, as if [a divine being] had
given commands to men, but in the sense that reason… has power to
command with the authority and in the guise of a divine person…. The
Idea of such a being, before whom all bend the knee, etc., arises out of
the categorical imperative, and not vice versa…. The Ens Summum [Supreme
Being] is an ens rationis [a creation of reason],… not a substance
outside me.“</p>
<p>So the Kantian philosophy, to which Christianity clung so long, in
Germany and later in England, as the last, best hope of theism, ended in
a bleak con- ception of God as a useful fiction developed by the human
mind to explain the apparent absoluteness of moral commands.</p>
<p>Kant’s successors, not knowing his Opus postumum , acc laimed him as
the savior of Christianity, the German hero who had slain Voltaire; and
they magnified his achievement until his influence exceeded that of any
other modem philosopher. One disciple, Karl Reinhold, predicted that
within a century Kant’s r eputation would rival that of Christ. 100 All
Protestant Ger- mans (except Goethe) accepted Kant’s claim that he had
effected a “Co - pernical revolution” in psychology: that instead of
having the mind (the sun) revolve around the object (the earth) he had
made the object (things) revolve around — and depend upon — the mind.
The human ego was flattered by being told that its intrinsic modes of
perception were the determining constituents of the phenomenal world.
Fichte concluded (even before Kant died) that the external world is a
creation of the mind, and Schopenhauer, accepting Kant’s analysis, began
his massive treatise The World as Will and Idea with the announcement
“The world is my idea”— which rather sur- prised Mme. de Stael.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXI )</p>
<p>KANT</p>

<p>Idealists rejoiced that Kant had made materialism logically
impossible by showing mind to be the only reality directly known to us.
Mystics were happy that Kant had restricted science to phenomena, had
barred it from the noumenal and really real world, and had left this
shady realm (whose exist- ence he secretly denied) as the private park
of theologians and philosophers. Metaphysics, which the philosophes had
banished from philosophy, was re- instated as the judge of all science;
and Jean Paul Richter, conceding mastery of the sea to Britain, and of
the land to France, assigned to Germany the mastery of the air. Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel built metaphysical castles upon the transcendental
idealism of Kant; and even Schopenhauer’ s master- piece took its start
from Kant’s emphasis upon the primacy of the will. “See,” said Schiller,
“how a single rich man has given a living to a number of beggars.”
101</p>
<p>German literature, too, soon felt Kant’s influence, for the
philosophy of one age is likely to be the literature of the next.
Schiller buried himself for a while in Kant’s tomes, wrote a letter of
homage to their author, and, in his prose essays, achieved an almost
Kantian obscurity. Obscurity became a fashion in German writing, a coat
of arms attesting membership in the an- cient order of web weavers. “On
the whole,” said Goethe, “philosophical speculation is an injury to the
Germans, as it tends to make their style vague, difficult, and obscure.
The stronger their attachment to certain philosophical schools, the
worse they write.” 102</p>
<p>One would not readily think of Kant as romantic, but his learned-hazy
passages on beauty and sublimity became one of the founts of the
Romantic movement. Schiller’s lectures at Jena, and his Letters on the
Aesthetic Edu - cation of Mankind ( 1 795) — milestones in that movement
— grew out of study- ing Kant’s Critique of Judgment. The subjectivist
interpretation of Kant’s theory of knowledge gave a philosophical basis
to the romantic individualism that flaunted its flag in Sturm und Drang.
The Kantian literary influence crossed to England, and affected
Coleridge and Carlyle; it crossed to New England and gave a name to the
Transcendentalist movement of Emerson and Thoreau. 103 The bent little
professor of geography shook the world as he trod the “Philosopher’s
Walk” in Konigsberg. Certainly he offered to phi - losophy and
psychology the most painstaking analysis of the knowledge process that
history has ever known.</p>
