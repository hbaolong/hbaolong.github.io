<h4 id="chapter-xxviii">CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>
<p>The Early Inquisition</p>
<p>1000-1300</p>
<p>I. THE ALBIGENSIAN HERESY</p>
<p>A NTICLERICALISM rose to a flood at the end of the twelfth
century.</p>
<p>t There were, in the Age of Faith, recesses of religious mysticism
and sentiment that escaped and resented organized sacerdotal
Christianity. Mov- ing perhaps with returning Crusaders, new waves of
Oriental mysticism flowed into the West. From Persia, through Asia Minor
and the Balkans, came echoes of Manichean dualism and Mazdakian
communism; from Islam a hostility to images, an obscure fatalism, and
distaste for priests; and from the failure of the Crusades a secret
doubt as to the divine origin and support of the Christian Church. The
Paulicians, driven westward by Byzantine per- secution, carried through
the Balkans into Italy and Provence their scorn of images, sacraments,
and the clergy; they divided the cosmos into a spiritual world created
by God and a material world created by Satan; and they identi- fied
Satan with the Yahveh of the Old Testament. The Bogomiles (i.e., Friends
of God) took form and name in Bulgaria, and spread especially in Bosnia;
they were attacked by fire and sword at various times in the thir-
teenth century, defended themselves tenaciously, and finally (1463) sur-
rendered not to Christianity but to Islam.</p>
<p>About the year 1000 a sect appeared in Toulouse and Orleans which de-
nied the reality of miracles, the regenerative virtue of baptism, the
presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and the efficacy of prayers to the
saints. They were ignored for a time, then condemned; and thirteen of
their number were burned at the stake in 1023. Similar heresies
developed, and led to uprisings, at Cambrai and Liege (1025), Goslar
(1052), Soissons (1114), Cologne (1146), etc. Berthold of Regensburg
reckoned 150 heretical sects in the thirteenth century. 1 Some were
harmless groups who gathered to read the Bible to one another in the
vernacular without a priest, and to put their own interpretation upon
its disputed passages. Several, like the Humiliati in Italy, the
Beguines and Beghards in the Low Countries, were orthodox in every-
thing except their embarrassing insistence that priests should live in
poverty. The Franciscan movement arose as such a sect, and narrowly
escaped being classed as heretical.</p>
<p>The Waldenses did not escape. About 1 170 Peter Waldo, a rich
merchant</p>
<p>769</p>
<p>77 ° THE AGE OF FAITH ( CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>of Lyons, engaged some scholars to translate the Bible into the
langue d’oc of south France. He studied the translation zealously, and
concluded that Christians should live like the apostles — without
individual property. He gave part of his wealth to his wife, distributed
the remainder among the poor, and began to preach evangelical poverty.
He gathered about him a small group , the “Poor Men of Lyons,” who
dressed like monks, lived in chastity, went barefoot or in sandals, and
pooled their earnings communistically. 2 For a time the clergy made no
objection, and allowed them to read and sing in the churches. 3 But when
Peter thrust his sickle into another man’s harvest in too literal
fulfillment of the Gospel, the archbishop of Lyons sharply reminded him
that only bishops were allowed to preach. Peter went to Rome (1179), and
asked Alexander III for a preaching license. It was granted, on
condition of consent and supervision by the local clergy. Peter resumed
his preaching, apparently without such local consent. His followers
became devotees of the Bible, and learned large sections of it by heart.
Gradually the movement took on an antisacerdotal tinge, rejected all
priesthood, denied the validity of sac- raments administered by a sinful
priest, and attributed to every believer in a state of sanctity the
power to forgive sins! Some members repudiated indul- gences, purgatory,
transubstantiation, and prayer to the saints; one group preached that
“all things should be in common”; 4 another identified the Church with
the scarlet woman of the Apocalypse.® The sect was condemned in 1 1 84.
One part of it, the “Poor Catholics,” was received into the Church in
1206 by Innocent III; the majority persisted in heresy, and spread
through France into Spain and Germany. Probably to check their increase,
a Council of Toulouse in 1229 decreed that no lay folk should possess
scriptural books except the Psalter and the Hours (which were chiefly
psalms) ; nor should they read these except in Latin, for no vernacular
translation had yet been examined and guaranteed by the Church. 6 In the
suppression of the Albi- genses thousands of Waldenses went to the
stake. Peter himself died in Bo- hemia in 1 2 17, apparently by a
natural death.</p>
<p>By the middle of the twelfth century the towns of Western Europe were
honeycombed with heretical sects; “the cities,” said a bishop in 1190,
“are filled with these false prophets”; 7 Milan alone had seventeen new
religions. The leading heretics there were the Patarines — named
apparently from Pa- taria, a poor quarter of the town. The movement
seems to have begun as a protest against the rich; it was turned to
anticlericalism, denounced the simony, wealth, marriage, and concubinage
of the clergy, and proposed, in the words of one leader, that “the
wealth of the clergy be impounded, their property put up at auction; if
they resist, let their houses be given up to pil- lage, and let them and
their bastards be hounded out of the city.” 8 Similar anticlerical
parties rose in Viterbo, Orvieto, Verona, Ferrara, Parma, Pia- cenza,
Rimini 0 At times they dominated the popular assemblies, captured</p>
<p>city governments, and taxed the clergy to pay for civic enterprises.
10 Inno-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE EARLY INQUISITION 77 1</p>
<p>cent III instructed his legate in Lombardy to exact an oath from all
municipal officials that they would not appoint or admit heretics to
office. In 1 2 37 a Mi- lanese mob, “blaspheming and reviling,” polluted
several churches with “un - mentionable filth.” 11</p>
<p>The most powerful of the heretical sects was variously named Cathari,
from the Greek for “pure”; Bulgari, from their Balka n provenance
(whence the abusive term bugger ) ; and Albigenses, from the French town
of Albi, where they were especially numerous. Montpellier, Narbonne, and
Marseille were the first French centers of the heresy, perhaps through
contact with Moslems and Jews, and through frequentation by merchants
from heretical centers in Bosnia, Bulgaria, and Italy. Merchants spread
the movement to Toulouse, Orleans, Soissons, Arras, and Reims, but
Languedoc and Provence remained its strongholds. There French medieval
civilization had reached its height; the great religions mingled in
urbane amity, women were imperiously beautiful, morals were loose,
troubadours spread gay ideas, and, as in Fred- erick’s Italy, the
Renaissance was ready to begin. Southern France was at that time (1200)
composed of practically independent principalities, tenu- ously bound in
theoretical allegiance to the king of France. In this region the counts
of Toulouse were the greatest lords, possessing territories more exten-
sive than those directly owned by the king. The doctrines and practices
of the Cathari were in part a return to primitive Christian beliefs and
ways, partly a vague memory of the Arian heresy that had prevailed in
southern France under the Visigoths, partly a product of Manichean and
other Oriental ideas. They had a black-robed clergy of priests and
bishops called perfecti, who at their ordination vowed to leave parents,
mate, and children, to devote themselves “to God and the Gospel . . .
never to touch a woma n, never to kill an animal, never to eat meat,
eggs, or dairy food, nor anything but fish and vegetables.” # ’The
“believers” ( credentes ) were followers who prom - ised to take these
vows later; they were allowed meanwhile to eat meat and marry, but they
were required to renounce the Catholic Church, to advance toward the
“perfect” life, and to greet any of the perfecti with a triple and
reverent genuflection.</p>
<p>The theology of the Cathari divided the cosmos Manicheanly into Good,
God, Spirit, Heaven; and Evil, Satan, Matter, the material universe.
Satan, not God, created the visible world. All matter was accounted
evil, including the cross on which Christ died, and the consecrated Host
of the Eucharist; Christ spoke only figuratively when He said of the
bread, “This is my</p>
<p>body.” 13 All flesh was matter, and all contact with it was impurity;
all sexual congress was sinful; the sin of Adam and Eve was coitus. 14
Opponents de- scribe the Albigenses as rejecting the sacraments, the
Mass, the veneration of images, the Trinity, and the Virgin Birth;
Christ was an angel, but not one</p>

<li>From a report by the inquisitor Sacchoni. 12 We know the doctrines
and practices of the Cathari only from their enemies; their own
literature was lost or destroyed.</li>

<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>772</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>with God. They repudiated (we are told) the institution of private
property, and aspired to an equality of goods . 15 They made the Sermon
on the Mount the essence of their ethics. They were taught to love their
enemies, to care for the sick and the poor, never to swear, always to
keep the peace; force was never moral, even against infidels; capital
punishment was a capital crime; one should quietly trust that in the end
God would triumph over evil, without using evil means . 16 There was no
hell or purgatory in this theology; every soul would be saved, if only
after many purifying transmigrations. To attain heaven one had to die in
a state of purity; for this it was necessary to receive from a Catharist
priest the consolamentum, a last sacrament which completely cleansed the
soul of sin. Cathari believers (like some early Christians in the case
of baptism) postponed this sacrament to what they judged to be their
final illness. Those who recovered ran a risk of acquiring new impurity
and dying without the consolamentum ; hence it was a great misfortune to
recover after receiving it; and it is charged that the Albigensian
priests, to avert this calamity, persuaded many a recovering patient to
starve himself into paradise. Sometimes, we are assured, they made
matters certain by suffocating a patient with his consent . 17</p>
<p>The Church might have allowed this sect to die of its own suicide had
not the Cathari engaged in active criticism of the Church. They denied
that the Church was the Church of Christ; St. Peter had never come to
Rome, had never founded the papacy; the popes were successors to the
emperors, not to the apostles. Christ had no place to lay His head, but
the pope lived in a palace; Christ was propertyless and penniless, but
Christian prelates were rich; surely, safd the Cathari, these lordly
archbishops and bishops, these worldly priests, these fat monks, were
the Pharisees of old returned to life! The Roman Church, they were sure,
was the Whore of Babylon, the clergy were a Synagogue of Satan, the pope
was Antichrist . 18 They denounced the preachers of crusades as
murderers . 19 Many of them laughed at indulgences and relics. One
group, it is alleged, made an image of the Virgin, ugly, one- eyed, and
deformed, pretended to work miracles with it, secured wide credence for
the imposture, and then revealed the hoax . 20 Many views of the Cathari
were spread on the wings of song by troubadours who resented the ethics
of Christ without quite adopting those of the new sect; all the leading
troubadours except two were considered to be on the side of the
Albigensians; these troubadours made fun of pilgrims, confession, holy
water, the cross; they called the churches “dens of thieves,” and
Catholic priests seemed to them “traitors, liars, and hypocrites.”
21</p>
<p>For some time the Cathari received a broad toleration from the
ecclesiastics and the secular powers of southern France. Apparently the
people were al- lowed to choose freely between the old religion and the
new . 22 Public debates were held between Catholic and Catharist
theologians; one such took place at Carcassonne in the presence of a
papal legate and King Pedro II of Aragon</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE EARLY INQUISITION 773</p>
<p>( i Z04) . In 1 1 67 various branches of the Cathari held a council
of their clergy, attended by representatives from several countries; it
discussed and regulated Catharist doctrine, discipline, and
administration, and adjourned without having been disturbed. 23
Moreover, the nobility found it desirable to weaken the Church in
Languedoc; the Church was rich, and owned much land; the nobles,
relatively poor, began to seize Church property. In 1171 Roger II,
Viscount of Beziers, sacked an abbey, threw the bishop of Albi into
prison, and set a heretic to guard him. When the monks of Allet chose an
abbot un- satisfactory to the Viscount, he burned the monastery and
jailed the abbot; when the latter died the merry Viscount installed his
corpse in the pulpit and persuaded the monks to choose a pleasing
substitute. Raymond Roger, Count of Foix, drove abbot and monks from the
abbey of Pamiers; his horses ate oats from the altar; his soldiers used
the arms and legs of the crucifixes as pestles to grind grain, and
practiced their markmanship upon the image of Christ. Count Raymond VI
of Toulouse destroyed several churches, persecuted the monks of Moissac,
and was excommunicated (1196). But excommunication had become a trifle
to the nobles of southern France. Many of them openly professed, or
liberally protected, the Catharist heresy. 24</p>
<p>Innocent III, coming to the papacy in 1 198, saw in these
developments a threat to both Church and state. He recognized some
excuse for criticism of the Church, but he felt that he could hardly
remain idle when the great ecclesiastical organization for which he had
such lofty plans and hopes, and which seemed to him the chief bulwark
against human violence, social chaos, and royal iniquity, was attacked
in its very foundations, robbed of its posses- sions and dignity, and
mocked with blasphemous travesties. The state too had committed sins and
cherished corruption and unworthy officials, but only fools wished to
destroy it. How could any continuing social order be built on the
principles that forbade parentage and counseled suicide? Could any
economy prosper on the idolatry of poverty and without the incentives of
property? Could the relations of the sexes, and the rearing of children,
be rescued from a wild disorder except by some such institution as
marriage? Catharism seemed to Innocent a mess of nonsense, made
poisonous by the simplicity of the people. What was the sense of a
crusade against infidels in Palestine, when these Albigensian infidels
were multiplying in the heart of Christendom?</p>
<p>Two months after his accession Innocent wrote to the archbishop of
Auch in Gascony:</p>
<p>The little boat of St. Peter is beaten by many storms and tossed</p>
<p>about on the sea. But it grieves me most of all that . . . there are
now arising, more unrestrainedly and injuriously than ever before,
minis- ters of diabolical error who are ensnaring the souls of the
simple. With their superstitions and false inventions they are
perverting the mean- ing of the Holy Scriptures and trying to destroy
the unity of the</p>
<p>774</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>Catholic Church. Since . . . this pestilential error is growing in
Gas-</p>
<p>cony and the neighboring territories, we wish you and your fellow</p>
<p>bishops to resist it with all your might. . . . We give you a strict
com- mand that, by whatever means you can, you destroy all these
heresies, and repel from your diocese all who are polluted by them If
neces-</p>
<p>sary, you may cause the princes and people to suppress them with the
sword. 25</p>
<p>The archbishop of Auch, a man indulgent to others as well as to
himself, seems to have taken no action on this letter; and the
archbishop of Narbonne and the bishop of Beziers resisted the papal
legates that Innocent sent to enforce his decrees. About this time six
noble ladies, led by the sister of the Count of Foix, were converted to
Catharism in a public ceremony attended by many of the nobility.
Innocent replaced his unsuccessful legates with a more resolute agent,
Arnaud, head of the Cistercian monks ( 1 204) ; gave him extraordinary
powers to make inquisition throughout France, and commis- sioned him to
offer a plenary indulgence to the king and nobles of France for aid in
suppressing the Catharist heresy. To Philip Augustus, in return for such
aid, the Pope offered the lands of all who should fail to join in a
crusade against the Albigensians. 26 Philip demurred; he had just
conquered Nor- mandy, and wanted time for digestion. Raymond VI of
Toulouse agreed to use persuasion on the heretics, but refused to join a
war against them. Innocent excommunicated him; he promised to comply,
was absolved, and proved negligent again. “How can we do it?” asked a
knight who had been com - manded by a papal legate to expel the Cathari
fro m their lands. “We have been brought up with these people, we have
kindred among them, and we see them living righteously.” 27 St. Dominic
entered the scene from Spain, preached peaceably against the heretics,
and made converts to orthodoxy by the holiness of his life. 28 Perhaps
the problem could have been met by such means, aided by clerical reform,
had not Pierre de Castelnau, a papal legate, been slain by a knight who
was thereafter protected by Raymond. 29 Inno- cent, who had borne with
patience the frustration of his efforts against the heresy for almost
ten years, now resorted to extreme measures. He excom- municated Raymond
and all his abettors; laid under interdict all lands subject to them,
and offered these lands to any Christian who could seize them. He
summoned Christians from all countries to a crusade against the
Albigensians and their protectors. Philip Augustus allowed many barons
of his realm to enlist, and contingents came from Germany and Italy. To
all participants the same plenary indulgence was promised as to those
who took the cross for Palestine. Raymond asked forgiveness, did public
penance (being scourged, half naked, in the church of St. Gilles), was
absolved again, and joined the holy war (1209).</p>
<p>Most of the population of Languedoc, nobles and commoners alike, re-
sisted the crusaders, seeing in the attack of northern barons and
soldiers of</p>
<p>CHAP.XXVIII) THE EARLY INQUISITION 775</p>
<p>fortune an attempt to seize their lands under cover of religious
zeal; even the orthodox Christians of the south fought the invasion from
the north. 30 When the crusaders approached Beziers they offered to
spare it the horrors of war if it would surrender all heretics listed by
its bishop; the city leaders refused, saying they would rather stand
siege till they should be reduced to eating their children. The
crusaders scaled the walls, captured the town, and slew 20,000 men,
women, and children in indiscriminate massacre; even those who had
sought asylum in the church. 31 Caesarius of Heisterbach, a Cistercian
monk writing twenty years after, is our only authority for the story
that when Arnaud, the papal legate, was asked should Catholics be
spared, he answered, “Kill them all, for God knows His own”; 32 perhaps
he feared tha t all the defeated would profess orthodoxy for the
occasion. Beziers having been burned to the ground, the crusaders, led
by Raymond, advanced to at- tack the fortress of Carcassonne, where
Raymond’s nephew, Count Roger of Beziers, made a final stand. The
fortress was taken, and Roger died of dysentery.</p>
<p>The bravest leader in this siege was Simon de Montfort. Born in
France about 1 1 70, he was the elder son of the lord of Montfort, near
Paris; he became Earl of Leicester through his English mother. Like many
men of that swashbuckling age, he was able to combine great piety with
great wars; he heard Mass every day, was famous for his chastity, and
had served with honor in Palestine. With his small army of 4500 men, and
urged on by the papal legate, he now assaulted town after town, overcame
all resistance, and gave the population a choice between swearing
allegiance to the Roman faith or suffering death as heretics. Thousands
swore, hundreds preferred death. 33 For four years Simon continued his
campaigns, devastating nearly all the ter- ritory of Count Raymond
except Toulouse. In 1215 Toulouse itself surren- dered to him; Count
Raymond was deposed by a council of prelates at Montpellier, and Simon
succeeded to his title and most of his lands.</p>
<p>Innocent III did not quite approve of these proceedings. He was
shocked to find that the crusaders had appropriated the holdings of men
never guilty of heresy, and had robbed and murdered like savage
buccaneers. 34 Taking mercy on Raymond, he assigned him an annuity, and
took under the care of the Church a portion of his lands in trust for
Raymond’s son. Raymond VII, coming of age, recaptured Toulouse; Simon
died in a second siege of the city (1218); the crusade was suspended now
that Innocent had died; and such Albigensian devotees as had survived
came forth to practice and preach again under the lenient rule of the
new Count of Toulouse.</p>
<p>In 1223 Louis VIII of France offered to depose Raymond VII, and
to</p>
<p>crush out all heresy in Raymond’s terr itory, if Honorius III would
allow him to add the region to the royal domain. We do not know the
Pope’s reply. But a new crusade was begun, and Louis was on the verge of
victory when he died at Montpensier (1226). Seizing the opportunity to
make peace with Blanche</p>
<p>77*5 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>of Castile, regent for Louis IX, Raymond offered the hand of his
daughter Jeanne to Louis’ brother Alphonse, with the reversion of
Raymond’s lands to Jeanne and her husband at Raymond’s death. Blanche ,
harassed by rebellious nobles, accepted, and Pope Gregory IX approved on
Raymond’s pledge to suppress all heresy. A treaty of peace was signed at
Paris in 1229, and the Albigensian wars came to an end after thirty
years of strife and devastation. Orthodoxy triumphed, toleration ceased;
and the Council of Narbonne (1229) forbade the possession of any part of
the Bible by laymen. 35 Feudal- ism spread, municipal liberty declined,
the gay age of the troubadours passed away, in southern France. In 1271
Jeanne and Alphonse, who had inherited Raymond’s possessions, died
without issue, and the spacious county of Tou - louse fell to Louis IX
and the French crown. Central France now had free commercial outlets on
the Mediterranean, and France had taken a great step toward unity. This,
and the Inquisition, were the chief results of the Albi- gensian
crusades.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE BACKGROUND OF THE INQUISITION</li>
</ol>
<p>The Old Testament laid down a simple code for dealing with heretics:
they were to be carefully examined; and if three reputable witnesses
testified to their having “gone and served other gods,” the heretics
were to be led out from the city and “stoned with stones till they die”
(Deut. xvii, 25) .</p>
<p>If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams . . . say-
ing, Let us go after other gods . . . that prophet, or that dreamer
of</p>
<p>dreams, shall be put to death. … If thy brother … or thy son, or
thy</p>
<p>daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend which is as thine
own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods .
. . thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shalt
thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou . . . conceal him; but thou shalt
surely kill him (Deut. xiii, 1-9). . . . Thou shalt not suffer a witch
to</p>
<p>live (Exod. xxii, 18).</p>
<p>According to the Gospel of St. John (xv, 6), Jesus accepted this
tradition: “If anyone abide not in me he shall be cast forth as a
branch, and shall wither; and they shall gather him up, and cast him
into the fire, an d he burneth.” Medieval Jewish communities retained
the Biblical law of heresy in theory, but rarely practiced it.
Maimonides adopted it without reserve. 30</p>
<p>The laws of the Greeks made asebeia — failure to worship the gods of
the orthodox Hellenic pantheon — a capital crime; it was by such a law
that Socrates was put to death. In classic Rome, where the gods were
allied with the state in close harmony, heresy and blasphemy were
classed with treason, and were punishable with death. Where no accuser
could be found to de- nounce an offender, the Roman judge summoned the
suspect and made an</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE EARLY INQUISITION 777</p>
<p>inquisitio , or inquiry, into the case; from this procedure the
medieval In- quisition took its form and name. The Eastern emperors,
applying Roman law in the Byzantine world, inflicted the death penalty
upon Manicheans and other heretics. During the Dark Ages in the West,
when Christianity was seldom challenged by its own children, tolerance
increased, and Leo IX held that excommunication should be the only
punishment for heresy . 37 In the twelfth century, as heresy spread,
some ecclesiastics argued that the excom- munication of heretics by the
Church should be followed with their banish- ment or imprisonment by the
state . 38 The revival of Roman law at Bologna in the twelfth century
provided terms, methods, and stimulus for a religious inquisition; and
the canon law of heresy was copied word for word from the fifth law of
the title De haereticis in the Justinian Code . 89 Finally, in the
thirteenth century, the Church took over the law of its greatest enemy,
Frederick II, that heresy should be punished with death.</p>
<p>It was a general assumption of Christians — even of many heretics —
that the Church had been established by the Son of God. On this
assumption any attack upon the Catholic faith was an offense against God
Himself; the con- tumacious heretic could only be viewed as an agent of
Satan, sent to undo the work of Christ; and any man or government that
tolerated heresy was serving Lucifer. Feeling herself an inseparable
part of the moral and po- litical government of Europe, the Church
looked upon heresy precisely as the state looked upon treason: it was an
attack upon the foundations of social order. “The civil law,” said
Innocent III, “punishes traitors with confiscation of their property,
and death. . . . All the more, then, should we excommuni- cate, and
confiscate the property of, those who are traitors to the faith of Jesus
Christ; for it is an infinitely greater sin to offend the divine majesty
than to attack the majesty of the sovereign.” 40 To ecclesiastical
statesmen like Innocent the heretic seemed worse than a Moslem or a Jew;
these lived either outside of Christendom, or by an orderly — and
equally severe — law within it; the alien enemy was a soldier in open
war; the heretic was a traitor within, who undermined the unity of a
Christendom engaged in a gigantic conflict with Islam. Furthermore, said
the theologians, if every man may interpret the Bible according to his
own light (however dim), and make his own individual brand of
Christianity, the religion that held up the frail moral code of Europe
would soon be shattered into a hundred creeds, and lose its efficacy as
a social cement binding natively savage men into a society and a
civilization.</p>
<p>Whether because it shared these views without formulating them, or
be- cause simple souls naturally fear the different or the strange, or
because men enjoy releasing, in the anonymity of the crowd, instincts
normally sup- pressed by individual responsibility, the people
themselves, except in south- ern France and northern Italy, were the
most enthusiastic persecutors; “the mob lynched heretics long before the
Church began to persecut e .” 41 The</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>778</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIIl</p>
<p>orthodox population complained that the Church was too lenient with
heretics. 42 Sometimes it “snatched sectaries from the hands of
protecting</p>
<p>The state, with some reluctance, joined in persecuting heretics
because it feared that government would be impossible without the aid of
a Church inculcating a unified religious belief. Moreover, it suspected
religious heresy to be a cloak for political radicalism, and was not
always wrong. 49 Material considerations may have played a part, for
religious or political heresy threatened the possessions of Church and
state. The public opinion of the upper classes — again excepting
Languedoc — demanded the extirpation of heresy at any cost. 50 Henry VI
of Germany ( 1 1 94) ordered severe punish- ment of heretics, and the
confiscation of their property; and similar edicts were issued by Otto
IV (1210), Louis VIII of France (1226), Florence</p>
<p>(1227), and Milan (1228). The most rigorous code of suppression was
en- acted by Frederick II in 1220-39. Heretics condemned by the Church
were to be delivered to the “secular arm”— the local authorities — and
burned to death. If they recanted they were to be let off with
imprisonment for life. All their property was to be confiscated, their
heirs were to be disinherited, their children were to remain ineligible
to any position of emolument or dignity unless they atoned for their
parents’ sin by denouncing other here - tics. The houses of heretics
were to be destroyed and never rebuilt. 51 The gentle Louis IX placed
similar laws among the statutes of France. Indeed it was the kings who
disputed with the people the distinction of inaugurating the persecution
of heresy. King Robert of France had thirteen heretics burned at Orleans
in 1022; this is the first known case of capital punishment of heresy
since the secular execution of Priscillian in 385. In 1051 Henry III of
Germany hanged several Manicheans or Cathari at Goslar over the pro-
tests of Bishop Wazo of Liege, who argued that excommunication was
enough. 52 In 1183 Count Philip of Flanders, in collaboration with the
arch- bishop of Reims, “sent to the stake a great many nobles, clerics,
knights, peas - ants, young girls, married women, and widows, whose
property they con- fiscated and shared between them.” 53</p>
<p>Normally, before the thirteenth century, inquisition into heresy was
left to the bishops. They were hardly inquisitors; they waited for
public rumor</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE EARLY INQUISITION 779</p>
<p>or clamor to point out the heretics. Summoning them, they found it
difficult to elicit confessions by inquiry; loath to use torture, they
resorted to trial by ordeal, apparently in the sincere belief that God
would work miracles to protect the innocent. St. Bernard approved of
this expedient, and an epis- copal council at Reims (1157) prescribed it
as regular procedure in trials for heresy; but Innocent III forbade it.
In 1185 Pope Lucius III, dissatisfied with the negligence of the bishops
in pursuing heresy, ordered them to visit their parishes at least once a
year, to arrest all suspects, to reckon as guilty any who would not
swear full loyalty to the Church (the Cathari refused to take any oaths)
, and to hand over such recalcitrants to the secular arm. Papal legates
were empowered to depose bishops negligent in stamping out heresy. 54
In- nocent III, in 1 2 1 5, required all civil authorities, on pain of
being themselves indicted for heresy, to swear publicly “to exterminate,
from the la nds subject to their obedience, all heretics who have been
marked out by the Church for animadversio debita —“ due punishment.” Any
prince who neglected this duty was to be deposed, and the pope would
release his subjects from their allegiance. 55 “Due punishment” was as
yet only banishment and confiscation of goods. 50</p>
<p>When Gregory IX mounted the papal throne (1227), he found that de-
spite popular, governmental, and episcopal prosecutions, heresy was
grow- ing; all the Balkans, most of Italy, much of France were so
turbulent with heresy that the Church, so soon after Innocent’s splendid
power, seemed doomed to division and disintegration. As the aged pontiff
saw the matter, the Church, simultaneously fighting Frederick and
heresy, was engaged in a struggle for survival, and was warranted in
adopting the morals and meas- ures of a state of war. Shocked at
learning that Bishop Filippo Paternon, whose diocese extended from Pisa
to Arezzo, had been converted to Cath- arism, Gregory appointed a board
of inquisitors, headed by a Dominican monk, to sit in Florence and bring
the heretics to judgment (1227). This, in effect, was the beginning of
the papal inquisition, though formally the inquisitors were to be
subject to the local bishop. In 1231 Gregory adopted into the law of the
Church Frederick’s legislation of 1224; henceforth Church and state
agreed that impenitent heresy was treason, and should be punished with
death. The Inquisition was now officially established under the control
of the popes.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE INQUISITORS</li>
</ol>
<p>After 1227 Gregory and his successors sent out an increasing number
of special inquisitores to pursue heresy. He favored for this task the
members of the new mendicant orders, partly because the simplicity and
devotion of their lives would counteract the scandals of ecclesiastical
luxury, and partly</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>780</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>because he could not depend upon the bishops; however, no inquisitor
was to condemn a heretic to serious punishment’ without episcopal
consent. So many Dominicans were employed in this work that they were
nicknamed Domini canes — the (hunting) “dogs of the Lord.” 57 Most of
them were men of strict morals, but few had the quality of mercy. They
thought of them- selves not as judges impartially weighing evidence, but
as warriors pursuing the enemies of Christ. Some were careful and
conscientious men like Ber- nard Gui; some were sadists like “Robert the
Dominican,” a converted Pata - rine heretic, who in one day in 1239 sent
180 prisoners to the stake, includ- ing a bishop who, in his judgment,
had given heretics too much freedom. Gregory suspended Robert from
office, and imprisoned him for life. 58</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the inquisitors extended only to Christians; Jews
and Moslems were not summoned unless they were relapsed converts. 59 The
Dominicans made special efforts to convert Jews, but only by peaceful
means. When, in 1256, some Jews were accused of ritual murder, Domini-
can and Franciscan monks risked their own lives to save them from the
mob. 60 The purpose and scope of the Inquisition are best expressed by a
bull of Nicholas III (1280):</p>
<p>We hereby excommunicate and anathematize all heretics — Cathari,
Patarines, Poor Men of Lyons . . . and all others, by whatever name</p>
<p>they may be called. When condemned by the Church they shall be</p>
<p>given over to the secular judge to be punished. … If any, after being
seized, repent and wish to do penance, they shall be imprisoned for life
All who receive, defend, or aid heretics shall be excommuni-</p>
<p>cated. If anyone remains under excommunication a year and a day,</p>
<p>he shall be proscribed If those who are suspected of heresy
cannot</p>
<p>prove their innocence, they shall be excommunicated. If they remain
under the ban of excommunication a year, they shall be condemned as</p>
<p>heretics. They shall have no right of appeal Whoever grants them</p>
<p>Christian burial shall be excommunicated until he makes proper satis-
faction. He shall not be absolved until he has with his own hands dug up
their bodies and cast them forth. . . . We prohibit all laymen to dis-
cuss matters of the Catholic faith; if anyone does so he shall be excom-
municated. Whoever knows of heretics, or of those who hold secret
meetings, or of those who do not conform in all respects to the ortho-
dox faith, shall make it known to his confessor, or to someone else</p>
<p>who will bring it to the knowledge of the bishop or the inquisitor.
If</p>
<p>he does not do so he shall be excommunicated. Heretics and all who
receive, support, or aid them, and all their children to the second gen-
eration, shall not be admitted to an ecclesiastical office. . . . We now
deprive all such of their benefices forever . 61</p>
<p>Inquisitorial procedure might begin with the summary arrest of all
heretics, sometimes also of all suspects; or the visiting inquisitors
might summon the entire adult population of a locality for a preliminary
examination. During</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIIl) THE EARLY INQUISITION 78 1</p>
<p>an initial “time of grace,” about thirty days, those who confessed
heresy and repented were let off with brief imprisonment or some work of
piety or charity. 62 Heretics who did not now confess, but were detected
in this initial inquiry, or by the spies of the Inquisition, 63 or
elsewise, were cited before the inquisitorial court. Normally this court
was composed of twelve men chosen by the local secular ruler from a list
of nominees presented to him by the bishop and the inquisitors; two
notaries and several “servitors” were added. If the accused took this
second chance to confess they received pun- ishments varying with the
degree of their adjudged offense; if they denied their guilt they were
imprisoned. Accused persons might be tried in their absence, or after
their death. Two condemnatory witnesses were required. Confessed
heretics were accepted as witnesses against others; wives and chil- dren
were allowed to testify against, but not for, husbands and fathers. 64
All the accused in a locality were, on demand, allowed to see a combined
list of all accusers, without any specification as to which had accused
whom; it was feared that individual confrontations would lead to the
killing of accusers by friends of the accused; and “in fact,” says Lea,
“a number of witnesses were slain on si mple suspicion.” 65 Usually the
accused man was asked to name his enemies, and any evidence against him
by such men was rejected. 66 False accusers were severely punished. 67
Before 1 300 the accused was not allowed to have legal aid. 68 After
1254 the inquisitors were required by papal decree to submit the
evidence not only to the bishop but also to men of high repute in the
locality, and to decide in agreement with their votes. 69 Some- times a
board of experts ( periti ) was called in to pass on the evidence. In
gen- eral the inquisitors were instructed that it was better to let the
guilty escape than to condemn the innocent, and that they must have
either clear proof or a confession.</p>
<p>Roman law had permitted the eliciting of confessions by torture. It
was not used in the episcopal courts, nor in the first twenty years of
the papal inquisition; but Innocent IV (1252) authorized it where the
judges were convinced of the accused man’s guilt, and later pontiffs
condoned its use. 70 The popes advised that torture should be a last
resort, should be applied only once, and should be kept “this side of
loss of limb and danger of death.” The inquisitors interpreted “only
once” as meaning only once for each examina - tion; sometimes they
interrupted torture to resume examination, and then felt free to torture
anew. Torture was in several cases used to force witnesses to testify,
or to induce a confessing heretic to name other heretics. 71 It took the
form of flogging, burning, the rack, or solitary imprisonment in dark
and narrow dungeons. The feet of the accused might be slowly roasted
over burning coals; or he might be bound upon a triangular frame, and
have his arms and legs pulled by cords wound on a windlass. Sometimes
the diet of the imprisoned man was restricted to weaken his body and
will and render him susceptible to such psychological torture as
alternate promises of mercy</p>
<p>THE AGE OF FAITH</p>
<p>782</p>
<p>(chap. XXVIII</p>
<p>or threats of death. 72 Confessions elicited under torture were
little respected by the inquisitorial court, but this difficulty was met
by having the accused confirm, three hours later, the admissions he had
made under torture; if he refused, the torture could be resumed. In 1286
the officials of Carcassonne sent to Philip IV of France and Pope
Nicholas IV a letter of complaint al- leging the severity of the
tortures used by the inquisitor Jean Galand. Some of Jean’s prisoners
were left for long periods in complete darkness and soli - tude; some
were so manacled that they had to sit in their own filth, and could only
lie on their backs on the cold earth. 73 Some men had been so drawn on
the rack that they had lost the use of their arms and legs; some had
died under torture. 74 Philip denounced these barbarities, and Pope
Clement V (1312) endeavored to moderate the use of torture by
inquisitors; but his cautions were soon ignored. 75</p>
<p>Prisoners who had refused two opportunities to confess and were later
convicted, and those who had relapsed into heresy after recanting, were
im- prisoned for life, or were put to death. Life imprisonment might be
mitigated with certain freedom of movement, visitation, and games; or it
might be enhanced with fasting or chains. 76 Confiscation of property
was an added penalty of conviction after resistance. Usually a part of
the confiscated goods went to the secular ruler of the province, part to
the Church; in Italy one third was given to the informer; in France the
crown took all. These con- siderations stimulated individuals and the
state to join in the hunt, and led to trials of the dead; at any time
the possessions of innocent persons might be seized on the charge that
the testator had died in heresy; this was one of many abuses that popes
vainly denounced. 77 The bishop of Rodez boasted that he had made
100,000 sols in a single campaign against the heretics of his diocese.
78</p>
<p>Periodically the inquisitors, in a fearful ceremony ( sermo
generalis), an- nounced convictions and penalties. The penitents were
placed on a stage in the center of a church, their confessions were
read, and they were asked to confirm them, and to pronounce a formula
abjuring heresy. The celebrant inquisitor then absolved the penitents
from excommunication, and an- nounced the various senten ces. Those who
were to be “relaxed,” or aban - doned to the secular arm, were allowed
another day for conversion; those who confessed and repented, even at
the foot of the stake, were given life imprisonment; the obdurate were
burned to death in the public square. In Spain this entire procedure of
sermo generalis and execution was termed an act of faith, auto-da-fe,
for it was intended to strengthen the orthodoxy of the people and to
reaffirm the faith of the Church. The Church never pro- nounced a
sentence of death; her old motto was ecclesia abhorret a sanguine —“the
Church shrinks from blood”; clerics were forbidden to shed blood. So, in
turning over to the secular arm those whom she had condemned, the Church
confined herself to asking the state authorities to inflict the “due</p>
<p>CHAP. XXVIII ) THE EARLY INQUISITION 783</p>
<p>penalty,” with a caution to avoid “all bloodshed and all danger of
death.”</p>
<p>The number of those sentenced to death by the official Inquisition
was smaller than historians once believed. 80 Bernard de Caux, a zealous
inquisitor, left behind him a long register of cases tried by him; not
one of these was “relaxed.” 81 In seventeen years as an inquisitor
Bernard Gui condemned 930 heretics, forty-five of them to death. 82 At a
sermo generalis in Toulouse in 1310 twenty persons were ordered to go on
pilgrimage, sixty-five were condemned to life imprisonment, eighteen to
death. In an auto-da-fe of 1312 fifty-one were sent on pilgrimage,
eighty-six received various terms of im- prisonment, five were turned
over to the secular arm. 83 The worst tragedies of the Inquisition were
concealed in the dungeons rather than brought to light at the stake.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>RESULTS</li>
</ol>
<p>The medieval Inquisition achieved its immediate purposes. It stamped
out Catharism in France, reduced the Waldenses to a few scattered
zealots, re- stored south Italy to orthodoxy, and postponed by three
centuries the dis- memberment of Western Christianity. France lost to
Italy the cultural leadership of Europe; but the French monarchy,
strengthened by the acqui- sition of Languedoc, grew powerful enough to
subdue the papacy under Boniface VIII, and to imprison it under Clement
V.</p>
<p>In Spain the Inquisition played a minor role before 1300. Raymond of
Penafort, Dominican confessor to James I of Aragon, persuaded him to
admit the Inquisition in 1232. Perhaps to check inquisitorial zeal a
statute of 1233 made the state the chief beneficiary of confiscations
for heresy; in later cen- turies, however, this would prove a heady
stimulus to monarchs who found that inquisition and acquisition were
near allied.</p>
<p>In northern Italy heretics continued to exist in great number. The
ortho- dox majority were too indifferent to join actively in the hunt;
and inde- penderft dictators like Ezzelino at Vicenza and Pallavicino at
Cremona and Milan clandestinely or openly protected heretics. In
Florence the monk Ruggieri organized a military order of orthodox nobles
to support the In- quisition; the Patarines fought bloody battles with
them in the streets, and were defeated ( 1 245) ; thereafter Florentine
heresy hid its head. In 1252 the inquisitor Fra Piero da Verona was
assassinated by heretics at Milan; and his canonization as Peter Martyr
did more to check heresy in north Italy than all the rigors of the
inquisitors. The papacy organized crusades against Ezzelino and
Pallavicino; the one was overthrown in 1259, the other in 1 268. The
triumph of the Church in Italy was, on the surface, complete.</p>
<p>784 THE AGE OF FAITH (CHAP. XXVIII</p>
<p>In England the Inquisition never took hold. Henry II, anxious to
prove his orthodoxy amid his controversy with Becket, scourged and
branded twenty-nine heretics at Oxford ( 1 166) ; 84 for the rest there
was little heresy in England before Wyclif. In Germany the Inquisition
flourished with brief madness, and then died away. In 1212 Bishop Henry
of Strasbourg burned eighty heretics in one day. Most of them were
Waldenses; their leader, Priest John, proclaimed their disbelief in
indulgences, purgatory, and sacer- dotal celibacy, and held that
ecclesiastics should own no property. In 1227 Gregory IX made Conrad, a
priest of Marburg, head of the Inquisition in Germany, and commissioned
him not only to exterminate heresy but to re- form the clergy, whose
immorality was denounced by the Pope as the chief cause of waning faith.
Conrad approached both tasks with outstanding cruelty. He gave all
indicted heretics a simple choice: to confess and be pun- ished, or to
deny and be burned at the stake. When he applied like energy to
reforming the clergy, orthodox and heretics joined to oppose him; he was
killed by the friends of his victims (1233); and the German bishops took
over the Inquisition and domesticated it to a juster procedure. Many
sects, some heretical, some mystical, survived in Bohemia and Germany,
and pre- pared the way for Huss and Luther.</p>
<p>In judging the Inquisition we must see it against the background of a
time accustomed to brutality. Perhaps it can be better understood by our
age, which has killed more people in war, and snuffed out more innocent
lives without due process of law, than all the wars and persecutions
between Caesar and Napoleon. Intolerance is the natural concomitant of
strong faith; tolerance grows only when faith loses certainty; certainty
is murderous. Plato sanctioned intolerance in his Laws; the Reformers
sanctioned it in the sixteenth century; and some critics of the
Inquisition defend its methods when practiced by modern states. The
methods of the inquisitors, including torture, were adopted into the law
codes of many governments; and perhaps our contemporary secret torture
of suspects finds its model in the Inquisition even more than in Roman
law. Compared with the persecution of heresy in Europe from 1227 to
1492, the persecution of Christians by Romans in the first three
centuries after Christ was a mild and humane procedure. Making every
allowance required of an historian and permitted to a Christian, we must
rank the Inquisition, along with the wars and persecutions of our time,
as among the darkest blots on the record of mankind, revealing a
ferocity unknown in any beast.</p>
