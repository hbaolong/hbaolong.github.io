<h4 id="chapter-xv-england-at-work">CHAPTER XV England at Work</h4>
<p>A T the head of the opposition to the Revolution after 1792 — at the
head of the resistance to Napoleon when his other enemies were
collapsing in unwilling alliance or ruinous defeat — stood the
government and the people, the expanding industries and commerce, the
Navy and its Nelson, the mind and will, of England. Not at once, nor all
together; at the outset of the confla- gration the leaders and formative
voices were uncertain and divided, fright- ened or inspired; the poets
and philosophers responded with enthusiasm to the early idealism of the
Revolution, the ardor and courage of its armies; but soon they were
chastened by the angry eloquence of Burke and the news of massacre and
terror in utopia; and as the liberators became conquerors, sub- jecting
half of Europe to the ambitions of France, England saw, as hinging on
the result of the conflict, that balance of Continental Powers upon
which the little island had for centuries depended for its security and
freedom. Slowly the nation came together. Despite the surrender of its
allies, the ob- struction of its trade, the bankruptcy of firms and
financiers, the exhaustion of its toilers, the daily temptation to
accept the terms of that brilliant and terrible Corsican bestriding the
Continent and threatening to cross the Chan- nel with half a million
undefeated warriors — despite this greatest challenge to England since
1066, the King and Parliament stood firm, the nobles and merchants paid
heavy taxes, the man with only a body to give suffered im- pressment
into the Army or Navy, the incomparable seamen of England passed from
mutinies to victories; and the beloved “spot of earth” emerged</p>
<p>We must stand aside for a while from the drama and conflict to
consider the resources of soil and labor, science and letters and art,
mind and creed and character that made possible this victory, this
transformation.</p>
<p>I. A DIFFERENT REVOLUTION</p>
<p>Geography had something to do with it. The climate was not ideal: the
warm air brought by the Gulf Stream’s North Atlantic current fought an
unremitting war with Arctic winds, and the conflict deposited frequent
mists and rains upon Ireland, Scotland, and England, making the soil
fertile, the parks green, the trees majestic, the streets wet; so that a
nasty wit mourned that though the sun never sets upon the British
Commonwealth it never rises on England. Napoleon too succumbed to that
hyperbole; “You have no sun in England,” he told his British physician
Dr. Arnott, who corrected him,</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>“Oh yes we do;… in July and August the sun shines warmly in England.”
1 The mists of their habitat may have clouded the poetry of Blake and
en- veloped Turner, and may have shared in fortifying the character and
insti- tutions of the English people. Their island made them insular,
but it pro- tected them against the shifting winds of doctrine, the fads
of art, the manias of revolution, and the massacres of war that so often
raged across the Conti- nent. They stood steady on their foot of
earth.</p>
<p>If their island was small, the seas that stormed or caressed its
shores called them to far-reaching adventures; a thousand liquid roads
invited men who could pitch and roll and always stand erect. A hundred
distant lands were waiting, with products and markets, to help transform
England from agri- culture to industry, commerce, and worldwide finance.
Innumerable quirks of shoreline offered inlets to oceans seeking peace,
and safe harbors to ves- sels from all the world. In the island itself
there were a dozen navigable rivers, and a hundred canals leading to one
or another of those streams. No Englishman was more than seventy-five
miles from waters that would take him to the sea.</p>
<p>Britain rose to the geographic challenge by making and bearing the
Indus- trial Revolution.* She built merchant ships of a size never
before known, some of them huge “East - Indiamen” for half -a-year
voyages to India and China. She loved the sea possessively as an
extension of England, and fought to the verge of exhaustion for control
of that altera patria against the Span- ish, then the Dutch, now the
French. She cut new paths through the water to and around continents, to
the resources and markets of Africa, India, the Far East, Australia, the
South Pacific, and the two Americas, alien or re- volted, but eager for
trade. Only the Northwest Passage defied these insati- ably seeking
Britons, and sent them home shivering but unbowed.</p>
<p>Those merchant fleets, however, and the roving Navy that protected
them, had to be built with mostly imported lumber; those colonies and
cus- tomers had to be requited for their raw materials, their silver and
gold, their spices, victuals, and exotic fruits, with the products of
British industry; that flourishing commerce had to be cargoed and
financed by the Industrial Revolution. Gradually England, especially
middle and northern, and Scot- land, especially southern, reorganized
their economic life by drawing more and more of their population from
the fields and villages into towns and factories, and from the slow
crafts of home or guild into confined collections of disciplined men,
women, and children, tending and paced by machinery, and producing
manufactured goods for the world.</p>
<p>Enclosures helped the transition. As far back as the twelfth century,
clever Englishmen had reckoned that they could use land more profitably
in large tracts than in small. They bought up individual farms and the
“commons”— those common fields and woods where peasants had
traditionally grazed their cattle and cut their fuel; they worked their
extended properties with hired “hands” under an overseer. In the
fifteenth century they decided that</p>
<p>This has been briefly described in Rousseau and Revolution ,
669-82.</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>341</p>
<p>hey could glean more profit by raising livestock, or, still better,
pasturing sheep, than by plowing the earth; for now they needed fewer
human beings, and found ready markets for carcasses and wool in chilly,
meat-loving Britain, and abroad. More and more peasant proprietors sold
or lost their farms and drifted to the towns; the sturdy yeomanry slowly
disappeared, taking with it some strength and pride from the English
character. By 1800 there were 1 5 million souls in Britain, and 19
million sheep; the sheep, said a wit, are devouring the men. To this
day, traveling in the middle and north- ern counties of England, one is
struck by the scarcity of farms and tillage, and the number of green and
fenced enclosures where the only visible in- habitants are sheep idly
transforming grass into wool, and rewarding with their end products a
grateful soil.</p>
<p>We must not exaggerate; throughout this period (except for the near-
starvation crisis brought on in 18 11 by Napoleon’s Continental
Blockade) English agriculture, increasingly capitalistic and mechanized,
succeeded in feeding England without foreign aid. 2 So confident were
the growers that they persuaded Parliament to pass “Corn Laws” checking,
by severe tariff duties, the import of competing grain. (“Com” then
meant any grain; in England it usually denoted wheat; in Scotland,
oats.) Even so, by 1790, the townward migration of displaced peasants,
aided by impoverished immi- grants from Scotland and Ireland, provided
the labor force that made indus- trialization possible.</p>
<p>Industry was still mostly in homes and craft shops, but most of it
was locally determined and consumed; it was not organized for wholesale
pro- duction that could supply diverse markets spreading across
frontiers. The home or shop worker was at the mercy of the middlemen who
sold him ma- terial and bought his product; his payment was determined
by supply and demand and the hungriest of his competitors; usually his
wife and children had to work with him, from dawn to dark, 3 to keep the
wolf from the door. Some more efficient way had to be found to finance
and organize industry if it was to meet the needs of multiplying
townsfolk, or fill the holds of mer- chantmen seeking foreign goods or
gold.</p>
<p>Inspired by Adam Smith but forgetful of his cautions, English
industry was geared to private enterprise, spurred by the profit motive,
and largely free from governmental regulation. It obtained capital from
its own unspent earnings, from prosperous merchants, from landlords
gathering agricultural revenues and urban rents, and from bankers who
knew how to make money breed by hugging it, and who lent money at lower
rates of interest than their French compeers. So individuals and
associations provided funds for entrepreneurs who proposed to unite the
products of farm and field with the service of machines and the labor
and skills of men, women, and children on a larger scale and to greater
gains than England had ever known. The providers of capital kept watch
on its use, and gave its name to the economic system that was about to
transform the Western world.</p>
<p>It was a risky game. An investment might be ruined by bad management,
price or market fluctuations, style changes, overproduction for
underpaid</p>
<p>34 2</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>consumers, or some new invention cornered by a competitor. The fear
of loss sharpened the greed of gain. The cost of labor had to be kept
minimal; rewards must be offered for inventions; machines must as far as
possible re- place men. Iron must be mined or imported to make machines,
ironclads, bridges, guns. Coal (luckily abundant in England) must be
mined to fuel smelters, purify ores, and toughen iron into steel. As
many machines as pos- sible must be tied to one strong source of power;
that source might be wind, or water, or animals walking a treadmill or
turning a screw; but the best power plant would be a steam engine like
those that James Watt had set up in Matthew Boulton’s plant near
Birmingham (1774). Given enough capital and careful organization, any
number of machines could be operated by one or a few engines; and to
each machine could be attached a man, or a woman, or a child, who would
tend it from twelve to fourteen hours a day for a sub- sistence wage.
The factory system took form.</p>
<p>Soon a thousand smokestacks belched their fumes over rising
industrial centers — Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Glasgow,
Edinburgh. In the Britain of 1750 there had been two cities with fifty
thousand inhabitants; in 1801 there were eight; in 1851 there would be
twenty-nine. Roads were paved to ease the transit of materials, fuels,
and products to factories, mar-, kets, and ports. Stagecoaches were
built to withstand eight passengers and ten miles an hour. 4 About 1808
Thomas Telford, about 181 1 John McAdam (both Scottish engineers)
devised new road surfaces essentially like the macadamized highways of
today. In 1801 George Trevithick built the first steam locomotive to
draw a passenger car on rails. In 1813 George Stephen- son built a
better one; in 1825 he opened the first regular steam railway service —
between Stockton and Darlington. In 1801 a small steamboat began to
operate on a Scottish canal; in 1807 the Boulton and Watt factory con-
structed a passenger steamboat on a model offered by Robert Fulton, who
ran his Clermont from New York to Albany in August of that year. Mean-
while London, Harwich, Newcastle, Bristol, Liverpool, Glasgow were de-
veloping ports and facilities for ocean commerce; and Nelson, at Abukir
and Trafalgar, was winning for England the command of the sea.</p>
<p>In 1801 the government took the first scientific census of Great
Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland), to the dismay of citizens who
resented the invasion of privacy as a prelude to regimentation. 5 The
recorded total showed 10,942,646 souls (the United States then had some
6,000,000). By 1 8 1 1 this had grown to 12,552,144.® Probably the rise
reflected an increase in the food supply, an improvement in medical
service, and a consequent decline in infantile and senile mortality.
London had grown to 1,009,546 in- habitants in 18 1 1, but the largest
and most significant expansion had been in the industrial north and
west. In 181 1 the number of British families engaged in farming or
herding was recorded as 895,998; in trade or manufactures, 1,128,049;
519,168 in other occupations. 7 The government had depressed agriculture
by sanctioning enclosures; it had encouraged industry by favor- ing free
enterprise and a protective tariff, and by forbidding labor unions to
agitate for better wages (1800). It had favored commerce by
improving</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>343</p>
<p>roads and canals, and by building an invincible British Navy.
Merchants, manufacturers, and financiers had acquired great wealth, and
some had earned or bought seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>The economic picture of Britain in 1 800 showed, at the top, an
aristocracy still, but decreasingly, masters of the economy through
ownership of the land; cooperating with them was a Parliament
overwhelmingly noble or gen- teel; swelling below and around them was a
ruthless and enterprising bour- geoisie of merchants and manufacturers
displaying their new riches and bad manners, and clamoring for more
political power; below these the profes- sions, from the most learned
physician to the most courageous or virulent journalist; below them all
a peasantry progressively dispossessed and de- pendent upon relief, and
sunless miners stripping or gutting the earth, and “navvies” engaged in
movable gangs to level roads and dig canals, and a labor pool of hungry,
disorganized, demoralized factory workers writing their tragedy in
polluted skies.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>AT THE BOTTOM</li>
</ol>
<p>If now we review again the condition of the factory workers in the
Britain of 1 800, we must not exaggerate their prominence in the total
picture of the time. Presumably there were many more pleasant scenes in
“Merrie Eng - land.” Factory labor itself was not then the main feature
of British industry; most industrial production was still carried on in
rural or urban homes at individual looms or lathes, or by craftsmen in
their independent shops. The factory system was for the most part
confined to the processing of cotton, linen, or wool. Even as so
limited, its role in the panorama of the age is one of the saddest
episodes in English history.</p>
<p>The factories themselves were rooted in slums and shrouded in their
own effluvia of bilge and fumes. Their interiors were generally dusty
and dirty, ill- ventilated, and ill-lit — till 1805, when, here and
there, gaslighting was in- stalled. The machines were geared to a speed
that required their human at- tendants to keep eyes alert and hands busy
through the twelve or fourteen hours of the working day; like some
latter-day inventions the machine saved labor and spent men. An hour was
allowed for luncheon; thereafter the toil continued, in most cases till
eight o’clock. 8 The labor force was replenished at need from a human
reservoir continually replenished by displaced peas- ants or careless
wombs.</p>
<p>Between deliveries women were preferred to men as factory workers,
and children were preferred to women, as requiring less pay. In 1816, of
10,000 employees in forty-one Scottish mills, 3,146 were men, 6,854 were
women, 4,581 were under eighteen. 9 Still cheaper, and widely favored,
was the labor of orphaned or destitute children sent to the factories by
the Poor Relief administrators. The Factory Act of 1802 tried to
establish some minimal standard for the use of such “apprentices,”
forbidding their employment for more than twelve hours a day; but
Parliament refused to pay the commis-</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>sioners appointed to enforce the act. 10 Generally, child labor
continued in British mills till 1 842. 11</p>
<p>In 1800 the average wage of a London adult male worker was eighteen
shillings per week (about 3.00 in the United States in i960) ; in the
country it was about one-third less. 12 By and large, the wages of a
family were deter- mined by the amount needed to maintain the strength
needed for work; but this was predicated on the wife and child joining
the factory force. 13 Em- ployers argued that wages had to be kept low
to get the workers to come to work; some laborers took weekends of two
or.three days, and when they returned they might be still drowsy with
alcohol in their blood. 14 Only hunger would bring them back to the
machines.</p>
<p>There were certain mitigations. Some employers paid the rent and fuel
ex- penses of their employees. Commodity prices were low — approximately
a third of their average in the Great Britain of i960. 15 Wages
generally rose and fell with prices, until 1793, when war began with
France; then all classes suffered in their incomes, but as the workers
had been kept down to a sub- sistence wage they suffered most.</p>
<p>They lived in towns where air was poisonous, in ghettos that nurtured
dis- ease, in crowded homes — sometimes damp cellars — where sunlight
was a rare intruder, lighting was dim, cleanliness was a mirage,
domestic strife rasped tired nerves, privacy was impossible, and the
only refuge for the woman was piety, and, for the man, the pub.
Drunkenness was hebdomadal. Houses took water from wells and public
pumps; when these ran short the women car- ried water from the nearest
river or canal, which, as like as not, was polluted by industrial,
domestic, or human waste. 16 Sanitation was primitive, sewers were rare:
“I am convinced,” wrote Thorold Rogers in 1890 (when he was professor of
political economy in Oxford), “that at no period of English his - tory
for which authentic records exist, was the condition of manual labor
worse than in the forty years from 1782 to 1821, the period in which
manu- facturers accumulated fortunes rapidly, and in which the rent
[receipts] of agricultural land was double d.” 17 This condition lasted
till the 1 840s. Carlyle, who grew up in Scotland and England between
1795 and 1840, summed up the condition of the British factory worker in
that period by concluding that Britons had been better off when they
were medieval serfs. Industrial prog- ress had left the proletaire so
slight a share in the growing wealth that he was reverting to barbarism
in manners, dress, amusements, and speech. “Civi - lization works its
miracles,” wrote Alexis de Tocqueville on visiting Man - chester;
“civilized man is turned back almost into a savage.” 18 Honor to
Manchester and her fellow cities for the immense advances they have made
since those bitter days.</p>
<p>The Poor Law, first enacted in 1601, often thereafter reformed,
offered some help for the destitute. It was administered by parish
officials who usu- ally gathered the recipients into workhouses. It was
financed by a specific tax on householders, who complained that their
payments were wasted on ne’er -do-wells, encouraging reckless fertility;
they submitted to the impost as insurance against social disorder. In
many districts, after 1795, the rate of</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>relief was adjusted to supplement wages deemed inadequate to
subsistence; some employers took advantage of this to keep wages
low.</p>
<p>Despite such middling mercies the discontent of the workers reached a
danger point as the nineteenth century began. Forbidden, till 1824, to
orga- nize for better pay, they secretly organized; forbidden to strike,
they struck; defeated, they struck again. 19 Reformers like Robert Owen
warned Parlia- ment that unless factory conditions improved, costly
violence would in- crease. Discontent was checked by the renewal of
hostilities with France ( 1 803 ) ; it increased as the war dragged on,
and came to open revolt in 1 8 1 1. It was led not by factory employees
but by lace and stocking weavers oper- ating “frames” in homes and small
shops in or near Nottingham. These men and women could still recall the
open-air life on the farms, and perhaps they idealized it in contrast
with confined work at their looms. They resented their subjection to the
“hosier” who leased them the frames, sold them raw material, and bought
their product at rates determined by him and the sup- pliers of his
stock or capital. Moreover, they feared that even their present jobs
would soon be lost to the spreading factories and their multiple, power-
driven looms. In their mounting fury they resolved to smash, wherever
they could, the machines that symbolized their serfdom.</p>
<p>An obscure and perhaps mythical individual named Ned or King Ludd
organized the angry weavers, and drew up plans for their raids. In the
fall of 18 1 1 separate bands of “Luddites” invaded one d istrict after
another and destroyed all the textile frames they found. The movement
spread from Not- tinghamshire to Lancashire, Derbyshire, and
Leicestershire, and continued through 1812. The machine- wreckers
abstained from injuring persons ex- cept in the case of an employer who
ordered his men to fire upon them; the strikers sought him out and
killed him. Half of England shivered with fright, remembering the French
Revolution. “At this moment,” wrote Robert</p>

<li>THE DISMAL SCIENCE</li>
</ol>
<p>The economists gave little comfort to the workers. Thomas Malthus, in
An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), explained that it is
useless to raise wages, for this would lead to larger families,
increasing the pressure</p>
<p>346 THE AGE OF NAPOLEON (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>of population upon the food supply, and would soon restore the
poverty that must forever result from the natural inequality of men. 21
In a revised but impenitent form (1803) of his famous essay Malthus laid
down his own “iron law of wages”: “The wages of labour will always be
regulated by the proportion of the [labor] supply to the demand.” 22 In
Principles of Political Economy (1820) he warned that thrift might be
carried to excess, since it would reduce investment and production; he
defended “rents” (the returns from property investments) as “the reward
of present valour and wisdom, as well as of past strength or cunning;”
23 and he agreed with Vo ltaire that the luxuries of the rich have the
good effect of providing employment for skilled artisans. In a liberal
moment he recommended public works as a miti- gation of unemployment in
periods of reduced production.</p>
<p>David Ricardo accepted the theorems of his friend Malthus, and built
upon them his own Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817),
which remained for half a century the classical text of what Carlyle was
to call “the dismal science.” 24 Son of a Dutch Jew who had prospered o
n the London Stock Exchange, he was converted to Unitarian Christianity,
mar- ried a Quaker girl, established his own brokerage firm, made a
fortune, retired from business (1815), and wrote several recondite
treatises, especially on finance. In 1819 he was elected to the House of
Commons, where he de- nounced Parliamentary corruption, defended free
assembly, free speech, free trade, trade unions, and warned the
capitalists to watch out lest the landlords of Britain, by their power
to raise rentals, should sooner or later absorb the gains of industry.
In his epochal treatise he argued that a rise in wages is never real,
since it will soon be canceled by a rise in prices due to the in-
creased cost of production; that the proper wage of the laborer is the
amount he needs to subsist and perpetuate (without increasing) his
species. Ricardo left a mite for Marx by defining the value (not the
price) of a commodity by the amount of labor required for its
production.</p>
<p>He was not as dismal as his science. He and Malthus remained fast
friends to the end, though often disagreeing in private and in print.
When both of them had died (Ricardo in 1823, Malthus in 1834), Sir James
Mackintosh (a surviving gleam of the Scottish Enlightenment) said of
them, and of their common source: “I have known Adam Smith slightly,
Ricardo well, and Malthus intimately. Is it not something to say for a
science that its three greatest masters were about the three best men I
ever knew?” 25</p>

<li>ROBERT OWEN: 1771-1858</li>
</ol>
<p>We turn with pleasure to Robert Owen, the successful manufacturer who
tried to make the British economy a love affair between capitalism and
so- cialism.</p>
<p>He was born in Newtown, Wales, where his father was successively sad-
dler, ironmaster^ and postmaster. Robert in boyhood was a physical weak-
ling, but he learned to care for his health, and lived to be
eighty-seven. He</p>

<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>was put to work at the age of nine; at ten he was apprenticed to a
draper in Stamford; at fourteen he became assistant to a draper in
Manchester; at nineteen he was made manager of one of the largest mills
in Lancashire, at an annual salary of three hundred pounds (,500?).
There he remained for eight years, earning a reputation for ability and
integrity. He saved, studied, read with discriminating eagerness, and
made stimulating friendships: with John Dalton and his atomic chemistry,
Robert Fulton with his steamboats, Samuel Coleridge with his radical
ideas and haunting verse. In 1799, aged twenty-eight, he bought from
David Dale, for himself and two partners, a group of textile mills at
New Lanark, near Glasgow, and received as a bonus Dale’s da ughter, who
became his loving wife. She gave him seven children.</p>
<p>New Lanark was a town of about two thousand souls, including some
five hundred children sent there from the poorhouses of Glasgow and
Edin- burgh. As Owen later recalled, “the population lived in idleness,
poverty, and almost every kind of crime; consequently in debt, out of
health, and in misery…. The ignorance and ill-training of these people
had given them habits of drunkenness, theft, falsehood, and
uncleanliness,… with strong national prejudices, both political and
religious, against all attempts on the part of a stranger to improve
their condition.” 26 The little mill town had</p>
<p>He contented himself — alarmed his partners — with a five percent
return on their invested funds. He raised wages, and forbade the
employment of children under ten years of age. He rejected the argument
of Malthus that a rise in wages would increase the pressure of
population upon the food sup- ply, would raise prices, and leave real
wages unchanged; he argued that limit- less edibles from the sea, the
spread of cultivation by increased population, and the multiplication of
inventions and labor productivity would enable the population to eat and
grow and prosper — if the government would adopt the reforms that he
would propose. 27 He opened at New Lanark a company store, which sold
the staples of life practically at cost. He patiently in- structed his
employees not only in the techniques of production but in the art of
life; he assured them that if they would practice mutual consideration
and aid they would enjoy a peace and content such as they had never
experi- enced before. He seems to have won many of his workers to habits
of order, cleanliness, and sobriety. When his partners complained that
he was spend- ing on charity and education money that might have made
higher profits, he dissolved the partnership and formed a new firm
(1813), whose members (one of them Jeremy Bentham) applauded his
experiment and were content with a five percent return on their
investment.</p>
<p>The mills at New Lanark acquired a national — even an international —

<p>ation. The town was far off the main roads — a full day’s ride by
post from Glasgow through mountains and mists; nevertheless thousands of
visitors came to examine the incredible phenomenon of a factory operated
on Chris- tian principles; twenty thousand signed the guest book between
1815 and</p>
<ol start="1825" type="1">
<li>They included writers, reformers, realistic businessmen, princes
like Archdukes Johann and Maximilian of Austria, and, in 1815, Grand
Duke Nicholas (soon to be czar), who approved the operations and the
results, and invited Owen to establish similar factories in Russia.
28</li>
</ol>
<p>After fourteen years of his experiment Owen felt warranted in
proclaim- ing it to the world, for he was confident that its universal
adoption would “give happiness to every human being through all
succeeding generations.” 28 So in 1813 he issued the first of four
essays which, under the general title A New View of Society , became a
major classic in the literature of reform. He offered his proposals in
no combative spirit; he assured the rulers and manufacturers of Britain
that he had no desire for — and no faith in — any vio- lent change; that
his plan threatened no loss to anyone; that, in fact, it would swell the
employer’s returns; and that it might save England from revolution.</p>
<p>He began with a proposition almost fundamental to any basic reform —
that the character of man, supposedly fixed by an ancient and immutable
heredity of competition and conflict, is substantially molded through
child- hood experiences and beliefs. “The greatest of all errors [is]
the notion that individuals form their own characters.” 30 On the
contrary, an individual’s character is formed for him by the thousand
influences impinging upon him [before his birth and] from his birth to
his death. Owen concluded, with an enthusiasm that rejected modifiers:
“Any character, from the best to the worst, from the most ignorant to
the most enlightened, may be given to any community, even to the world
at large, by applying certain means; which are to a great extent at the
command, under the control, of those who pos- sess the government of
nations.” 31 From this principle Owen drew two prop - ositions: one,
that the present possessing classes were not to blame for their
practices and beliefs, since they too were the product of their past and
pres- ent environments; the other, that reform must begin with the
children, and with the improvement and multiplication of schools. Every
effort must be made to bring up children to understand that since no one
individual is to blame for his character or for the condition of society
and industry, each must be considerate of all others: must cooperate
willingly, and must be un- discourageably kind. So, at a time when there
were very few schools in Eng- land for the children of commoners, Owen
proposed that “the governing power of all countries should establish
national plans for the education, and general formation of the
character, of their subjects;… and that without… exception for sect or
party or country.” 32</p>
<p>David Dale had already done much for the education of children in New
Lanark. Owen carried this further by establishing, in one of his
buildings, his “New Institution” (1816) for the transformation of angels
and barbari - ans into Christians without theology. He asked for them
“as soon, almost, as they could walk”; 33 like Plato he feared that the
parents, already formed</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>or deformed, would transmit to their children the aggressive and
competitive spirit of the existing regime. He yielded to mothers who
insisted that chil- dren, in their early years, needed maternal
affection and care. Usually he took them at the age of three, and let
them, weather permitting, play and learn in the open air. The girls, as
well as the boys, were to get the three R’s, but also they would be
instructed in the household arts. The boys would be trained in military
exercises, but, like the girls, they would be taught to sing, dance, and
play some instrument. All this would be subordinated to the for- mation
of moral character, with emphasis on courtesy, kindness, and cooper-
ation. There would be no punishments. 34 At the close of each schoolday
the children would be returned to their parents. They would not be
allowed to work in the factory before they were ten years old.</p>
<p>Apparently there was no religious instruction in Owen’s school, nor
in the evening lectures offered to adults. As a child of the
Enlightenment he was convinced that religion dulled the mind of the
child with superstitions; that intelligence is the supreme virtue; that
widespread education is the only so- lution to social problems; and that
progress, given this aid, is inevitable and limitless. 36 In his mills
and his school no distinction of race or creed was made; “charity and
kindness admit of no exception.” 36 He believed that the methods he
advocated were an attempt to move in the direction of the ethics of
Christ, and he looked forward fervently to the moral utopia that he ex-
pected his principles to bring.</p>
<p>In his fourth essay ( 1 8 1 6) , dedicated to the Prince Regent, he
offered some proposals for legislation. He asked Parliament to
progressively reduce the importation of “spirits” (liquor), to raise
taxes on their consumption, and finally to end the licensing of “gin -
shops” and alehouses, so that drunk - enness would become the luxury or
moneyed fools. He recommended the spread and financing of elementary
schools for the moral betterment of the coming generations. He pleaded
for a “factory act” that would forbid the employment of children under
ten years of age, and the night labor of per- sons under eighteen; that
would regulate the hours and conditions of labor, and would maintain a
system of regular inspection of factories. A govern- mental Department
of Labor should periodically collect statistics of local variations in
the supply and need of labor, and should use this information to
alleviate unemployment. 37 He called for the abolition of the state
lottery as a disgraceful scheme to “entrap the unwary and rob the
ignorant.” 38</p>
<p>He agreed with Malthus that the Poor Laws — which kept the unemployed
and impoverished at a level of subsistence just a step from starvation —
de- graded the recipients of relief, and left them fit for only
fertility and crime. Instead of the workhouses maintained by this
system, Owen proposed (1817) that the state should set up communities,
each of which, with five hundred to fifteen hundred souls, would be
organized by a self-sustaining division of labor to produce its own food
and clothing, and maintain its own school. 39</p>
<p>Having appealed to Parliament with scant result, Owen issued (1818)
an address “To the British Manufacturers,” 40 describing the success of
his sys -</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>THE AGE OF NAPOLEON</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>ern at New Lanark, and urging them to dispense with the employment of
children under twelve years of age. They could not see their way to
doing this; and they resented Owen’s analysis of economic depression as
due to in - ventive productivity outrunning the purchasing power of the
people. They dismissed him as an atheistic visionary who had no real
understanding of the problems that employers had to meet, or of the
human needs that only re- ligion could satisfy.</p>
<p>Finally Owen turned to the laborers themselves, and sought their
support in an “Address to the Working Classes” (1819). He pleased them
by ac - claiming “manual labor, properly directed,” as “the source of
all wealth, and of national prosperity.” 41 But he cautioned them that
England, and its working classes, were not ready for socialism; he
disclaimed any intent to propose that the British government should now
give direct employment to all its working population. 42 He
discountenanced any precipitate measures, and he rejected revolution as
“calculated to generate and call forth all the evil passions of hatred
and revenge.” 43 However, in his 1820 Report to the County of Lanark (a
body of landowners), he declared that what England now needed was not
piecemeal reforms but a basic transformation of the social order. 44</p>
<p>Frustrated in England, he turned hopefully to the United States,
where several religious sects had made some communistic experiments. In
1814 a group of German-American Pietists bought thirty thousand acres
along the Wabash River in the southwestern part of the Indiana
Territory, and de- veloped there a town called Harmonie. By 1825 they
faced bankruptcy. Owen rescued them, and ruined himself, by giving them
forty thousand pounds for the acres and the town, which he renamed New
Harmony. He invited men and women of goodwill to join him there in
establishing a co- operative community. He paid all expenses except for
the school, which was financed by William Maclure. A thousand
enthusiasts came, ate for a year at Owen’s expense, slowly reconciled
them selves to disciplined work, and fell to quarreling about religion
and politics. In 1827, having lost most of his forty thousand pounds, 45
Owen turned over the colony to Maclure, and returned to Britain.</p>
<p>He was not quite finished. He led a movement for the development of
trade unions into guilds that would compete with private enterprise in
pro- ductive industry. The National Operative Builders Union accepted
con- tracts for construction. Other unions followed suit, and in 1833
Owen orga- nized them into a Grand National Consolidated Trades-Union,
which he hoped would gradually supplant British capitalism, and finally
replace the state. Parliament intervened with repressive laws, which
were rigorously en- forced; the banks refused loans; and in 1834 Owen
acknowledged defeat.</p>
<p>His life, which had been so successful in industry, seemed now to
have reached an almost total failure. Religious differences had darkened
his mar- riage; his wife was a fervent Calvinist; when she discovered
that he was an agnostic she worried daily about his inevitable
damnation. Later she urged their son Robert to undertake his father’s
conversion to Calvinism; the re -</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>ENGLAND AT WORK</p>
<p>35 1</p>
<p>suit was that the son’s religious faith suffered considerable
dilution. 46 After returning from America, Owen lived apart from his
wife, though remaining on friendly terms with her. He believed in
divorce, but did not seek one; his devotion was absorbed in his
mission.</p>
<p>He gave his active encouragement to several communities that tried to
practice his principles: at Orbiston in Scotland, at Ralahine in
Ireland, at Queenwood in England. The first disbanded in two years, the
second in three, the third in six. He continued to spread his ideas
through addresses and writings, and lived to see the development of many
consumers’ cooper - atives in the British Isles. He kept busy writing
recommendations for reform to learned bodies, to governmental personnel,
to Queen Victoria. Finally, in 1853, he turned to spiritualism, became
the dupe of various mediums, and held intimate conversations with
Franklin, Jefferson, Shakespeare, Shelley, Napoleon, and the Prophet
Daniel. 47 In 1858, having long outlived his era and himself, he
returned to his native Newtown, and died there in his eighty- eighth
year.</p>
<p>He was a good man, as near to selflessness as any self can be who is
com- pletely certain. He could not quite transcend his ego; he had his
secret pride m power, success, and intellect; his enterprises were
predicated on his per- sonal rule; but he was right in assuming that
competent cooperation requires discipline and authority. The best a man
can do is enlarge his ego to include his kin, his country, his kind, and
so find satisfaction in a widening benef- icence. This, after all, is
what Robert Owen did, on a bravely broadening scale; and that is enough
to range him among the inspiring prophets of a better life.</p>
