<p>XXXThe Mind and Art of Old Japan</p>
<p>I. LANGUAGE AND EDUCATION</p>
<p>The language — Writing — Education</p>
<p>M EANWHILE the Japanese had borrowed their systems of writing and
education from the barbarian Chinese. Their language was peculiarly
their own, presumably Mongolian and akin to the Korean, but not demon-
strably derived from this or any other known tongue. It differed
especially from the Chinese in being polysyllabic and agglutinative, and
yet simple; it had few aspirates, no gutturals, no compound or final
consonants (except ri) and almost every vowel was melodiously long. The
grammar, too, was a natural and easy system; it dispensed with number
and gender in its nouns, with degrees of comparison in its adjectives,
and with personal inflections in its verbs; it had few personal
pronouns, and no relative pronouns at all. On the other hand there were
inflections of negation and mood in adjectives and verbs; troublesome
“postpositions”— modifying suffixes — were used instead of prepositions;
and complex honorifics like “Your humble servant” and “Your Excellency”
took the place of the first and second personal pronouns.</p>
<p>The language dispensed even with writing, apparently, until Koreans
and Chinese brought the art to Japan in the early centuries of our era;
and then the Japanese were content for hundreds of years to express
their Italianly beautiful speech in the ideographs of the Middle
Kingdom. Since a complete Chinese character had to be used for each
syllable of a Japanese word, Japanese writing, in the Nara age, was very
nearly the most laborious ever known. During the ninth century that law
of economy which determines so much of philology brought to the relief
of Japan two simplified forms of writing. In each of them a Chinese
character, shortened into cursive form, was used to represent one of the
forty-seven syllables that constitute the spoken speech of Japan; and
this syllabary of forty-seven characters served instead of an alphabet.*
Since a large part of Japanese literature is in Chinese, and most of the
remainder is written not in the popular syllabary but in a combination
of Chinese characters and native alphabets, few Western scholars</p>

<p>have been able to master it in the original. Our knowledge of
Japanese litera- ture is consequently fragmentary and deceptive, and our
judgments of it can be of Jittle worth. The Jesuits, harassed with these
linguistic barriers, reported that the language of the islands had been
invented by the Devil to prevent the preaching of the Gospel to the
Japanese.* 2</p>
<p>Writing remained for a long time a luxury of the higher classes;
until the latter part of the nineteenth century no pretense was made of
spreading the art among the people. In the Kyoto age the rich families
maintained schools for their children; and the emperors Tenchi and
Mommu, at the beginning of the eighth century, established at Kyoto the
first Japanese university. Gradu- ally a system of provincial schools
was developed under governmental con- trol; their graduates were
eligible to enter the university, and those graduates of the university
who passed the required tests became eligible for public office. The
civil wars of the early feudal period broke down this educa- tional
progress, and Japan neglected the arts of the mind until the Tokugawa
Shogunate reorganized peace and encouraged learning and literature.
Iyeyasu was scandalized to find that ninety per cent of the Samurai
could not read or write. 6 In 1630 Hayashi Razan established at Yedo a
training-school in public administration and Confucian philosophy, which
later developed into the University of Tokyo; and Kumazawa, in 1666,
founded at Shizutani the first provincial college. By allowing teachers
to wear the sword and boast the rank of the Samurai , the government
induced students, doctors and priests to set up private schools in homes
or temples for the provision of elementary education; in 1750 there were
eight hundred such schools, with some forty thousand students. All these
institutions were for the sons of the Samurai ; merchants and peasants
had to be content with popular lecturers, and only prosperous women
received any formal education. Universal education, in Japan as in
Europe, had to wait for the needs and compulsions of an industrial life.

<li>Printing, like writing, came from China as part of Buddhist lore;
the oldest extant examples of printing in the world are some Buddhist
charms block-printed at the com- mand of the Empress Shotoku in the year
770 a.d . 3 Movable type entered from Korea about 1596, but the expense
involved in printing a language still composed of thousands of
characters kept its use from spreading until the Restoration of 1858
opened the doors to European influence. Even today a Japanese newspaper
requires a font of several thousand characters. 4 Japanese typography,
despite these difficulties, is one of the most attractive forms of
printing in our time.</li>

<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXn. POETRY</p>
<p>The “ Many oshu”— The “Kokinshu”— Characteristics of Japanese</p>
<p>poetry — Examples — The game of poetry —</p>
<p>The “hokka” -gamblers</p>
<p>The earliest Japanese literature that has come down to us is poetry,
and the earliest Japanese poetry is by native scholars accounted the
best. One of the oldest and most famous of Japanese books is the
Manyoshu, or “Book of Ten Thousand Leaves,” in which two editors
collected into</p>
<p>twenty volumes some 4,500 poems composed during the preceding four
centuries. Here in particular appeared the work of Hitomaro and Akahito,
the chief poetic glories of the Nara age. When his beloved died, and the
smoke from the funeral pyre ascended into the hills, Hitomaro wrote an
elegy briefer than In Memoriam:</p>
<p>Oh, is it my beloved, the cloud that wanders</p>
<p>In the ravine</p>
<p>Of the deep secluded Hatsuse Mountain?’</p>
<p>A further effort to pres erve Japanese poetry from time’s mortality
was made by the Emperor Daigo, who brought together eleven hundred poems
of the preceding one hundred and fifty years into an anthology known as
the Kokinshu — “Poems Ancient and Modern.” His chief aide was the
poet-scholar Tsurayuki whose preface seems more interesting to us today
than the fragments which the book has brought down to us from his
laconic muse:</p>
<p>The poetry of Japan, as a seed, springs from the heart of man</p>
<p>creating countless leaves of language. … In a world full of
things</p>
<p>man strives to find words to express the impression left on his heart
by sight and sound. . . . And so the heart of man came to find ex-</p>
<p>pression in words for his joy in the beauty of blossoms, his
wonder</p>
<p>at the song of birds, and his tender welcome of the mists that bathe
the landscapes, as well as his mournful sympathy with the evanescent
morning dew. . . . To verse the poets were moved when they saw</p>
<p>the ground white with snowy showers of fallen cherry blossoms on</p>
<p>spring mornings, or heard on autumn evenings the rustle of
falling</p>
<p>leaves; or year after year gazed upon the mirror’s doleful
reflections of the ravages of time, … or trembled as they watched the
ephem-</p>
<p>eral dewdrop quivering on the beaded grass. 8</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 879</p>
<p>Tsurayuki well expressed the recurrent theme of Japanese poetry — the
moods and phases, the blossoming and decay, of nature in isles made
scenic by volcanoes, and verdant with abundant rain. The poets of Japan
delight in the less hackneyed aspects of field and woods and sea — trout
splashing in mountain brooks, frogs leaping suddenly into noiseless
pools, shores without tides, hills cut with motionless mists, or a drop
of rain nestling like a gem in a folded blade of grass. Often they
interweave a song of love with their worship of the growing world, or
mourn elegiacally the brevity of flowers, love and life. Seldom,
however, does this nation of warriors sing of war, and only now and then
does its poetry lift the heart in hymns. After the Nara period the great
majority of the poems were brief; out of eleven hundred in the Kokinshu
all but five were in the pithy tanka form- five lines of five, seven,
five, seven and seven syllables. In these poems there is no rhyme, for
the almost invariable vowel ending of Japanese words would have left too
narrow a variety for the poet’s choice; nor is there any accent, tone or
quantity. There are strange tricks of speech: “pillow words,” or
meaningless prefixes a dded for the sake of euphony; “prefaces,” or
sentences prefixed to a poem to round out its form rather</p>
<p>So we shall be misled if we seek in these anthologies, or in that
Golden Treasury of Japan, the Hyaku-nin-isshu —’ “Single Verses by a
Hundred People”— any heroic or epic strain, any sustained or lyric
flight; these poets.</p>
<p>880 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXlike the rash wits of the Mermaid Tavern, were willing to hang
their lives on a line. So when Saigyo Hoshi, having lost his dearest
friend* became a monk, and mystically found in the shrines at Ise the
solace he was seeking, he wrote no Adonais, nor even a Lycidas, but
these simple lines:</p>
<p>What it is</p>
<p>That dwelleth here</p>
<p>I know not;</p>
<p>Yet my heart is full of gratitude,</p>
<p>And the tears trickle down. ’</p>
<p>And when the Lady Kaga no Chiyo lost her husband she wrote,
merely:</p>
<p>All things that seem</p>
<p>Are but</p>
<p>One dreamer’s dream</p>
<p>I sleep 1 wake</p>
<p>How wide</p>
<p>The bed with none beside.”</p>
<p>Then, having lost also her child, she added two lines:</p>
<p>Today, how far may he have wandered,</p>
<p>The brave hunter of dragon- flies!”</p>
<p>In the imperial circles at Nara and Kyoto the composition of tankas
be- came an aristocratic sport; female chastity, which in ancient India
had re- quired an elephant as its price, was often satisfied, at these
courts, with thirty-one syllables of poetry cleverly turned. 12 It was a
usual thing for the emperor to entertain his guests by handing them
words with which to fashion a poem” and the literature of the time
refers casually to people conversing with one another in acrostic
poetry, or reciting tankas as they walked in the streets.” Periodically,
at the height of the Heian age, the emperor arranged a poetry contest or
tournament, in which as many as fifteen hundred candidates competed
before learned judges in the making of tanka epigrams. In 95 1 a special
Poetry Bureau was established for the management of these jousts, and
the winning pieces in each contest were deposited in the archives of the
institution.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century Japanese poetry felt guilty of
long-windedness, and decided to shorten the tanka — originally the
completion, by one person,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 88l</p>
<p>of a poem begun by another — into the hokku — a “single utterance” of
three lines, boasting of five, seven and five syllables, or seventeen in
all. In the Genroku age (1688-1704) the composition of these hokku
became first a fashion, then a craze; for the Japanese people resembles
the American in an emotional-intellectual sensitivity that makes for the
rapid rise and fall of mental styles. Men and women, merchants and
warriors, artisans and peasants neglected the affairs of life to match
hokku epigrams, con- structed at a moment’s warning. The Japanese, with
whom gambling i s a favorite passion, wagered so much money in
fioMw-composing contests that some enterprising souls made a business of
conducting them, fleecing thousands of devotees daily, until at last the
government was forced to raid these poetical resorts and prohibit this
new mercenary art. 15 The most distinguished master of the hokku was
Matsura Basho (1643-94), whose birth, it seemed to Yone Noguchi, “was
the greatest happening in our Japanese annals.” 10 Basho, a young
Samurai, was so deeply moved by the death of his lord and teacher that
he abandoned the life of the court, re- nounced all physical pleasures,
gave himself to wandering, meditation and teaching, and expressed his
quiet philosophy in fragments of nature poetry highly revered by
Japanese literati as perfect examples of concentrated suggestion:</p>
<p>The old pond,</p>
<p>Aye, and the sound of a frog leaping into the water.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>A stem of grass, whereon</p>
<p>A dragon- fly essayed to light.”</p>

<p>1 . Fiction</p>
<p>Lady Murasaki —The “ Tale of Genji”— lts excellence — Later</p>
<p>Japanese fiction — A humorist</p>
<p>If Japanese poems are too brief for the taste of the Western mind, we
may console ourselves with the Japanese novel, whose masterpieces run
into twenty, sometimes thirty, volumes. 10 The most highly regarded of
them is the Genji Monogatari (literallv and undeniably “Gossip about</p>
<p>882</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXGenji”), which in one edition fills 4,234 pages. 18 This
delightful romance was composed about the year 1001 a.d. by the Lady
Murasaki no-Shikibu. A Fuji war a of ancient blood, she married another
Fujiwara in 997, but was left a widow four years later. She dulled her
sorrow by writing an his- torical novel in fifty-four books. After
filling all the paper she could find, she laid sacrilegious hands upon
the sacred sutras of a Buddhist temple, and used them for manuscript; 88
even paper was once a luxury.</p>
<p>The hero of the tale is the son of an emperor by his favorite
concubine Kiritsubo, who is so beautiful that all the other concubines
are jealous of her, and actually tease her to death. Murasaki, perhaps
exaggerating the male’s capacity for devotion, represents the Emperor as
inconsolable.</p>
<p>As the years went by, the Emperor did not forget his lost lady;</p>
<p>and though many women were brought to the palace in the hope</p>
<p>that he might take pleasure in them, he turned from them all, believ-
ing that there was not anyone in the world like her whom he had</p>
<p>lost. . . . Continually he pined that fate should not have
allowed</p>
<p>them to fulfil the vow which morning and evening was ever talked</p>
<p>of between them, the vow that their lives should be as the twin</p>
<p>birds that share a wing, the twin trees that share a bough. 81</p>
<p>Genji grows up to be a dashing prince, with more looks than morals;
he passes from one mistress to another with the versatility of Tom
Jones, and outmodes that conventional hero by his indifference to
gender. He is a woman’s idea of a man— all sentiment and seduction,
always brooding and languishing over one woman or the next.
Occasionally, “in great unhappi - ness he returned to his wife’s house.”
88 The Lady Murasaki retails his ad - ventures gaily, and excuses him
and herself with irresistible grace:</p>
<p>The young Prince would be thought to be positively neglecting</p>
<p>his duty if he did not indulge in a few escapades; and every one</p>
<p>would regard his conduct as perfectly natural and proper even when it
was such as they would not have dreamed of permitting to ordi-</p>
<p>nary people. … I should indeed be very loath to recount in all
their</p>
<p>detail matters which he took so much trouble to conceal, did I
not</p>
<p>know that if you found that I had omitted anything you would at</p>
<p>once ask why, just because he was supposed to be an emperor’s
son,</p>
<p>I must needs put a favorable showing on his conduct by leaving
out</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ARTOFOLD JAPAN 883</p>
<p>all his indiscretions; and you would soon be saying that this was
no</p>
<p>history but a mere made-up tale designed to influence the judgment of
posterity. As it is, I shall be called a scandal-monger; but that I</p>
<p>cannot help . 28</p>
<p>In the course of his amours Genji falls ill, repents him of his
adventures, and visits a monastery for pious converse with a priest. But
there he sees a lovely princess (modestly named Murasaki), and thoughts
of her distract him as the priest rebukes him for his sins.</p>
<p>The priest began to tell stories about the uncertainty of this
life</p>
<p>and the retributions of the life to come. Genji was appalled to
think</p>
<p>how heavy his own sins had already been. It was bad enough to</p>
<p>think that he would have them on his conscience for the rest of
his</p>
<p>present life. But then there was also the life to come. What
terrible</p>
<p>punishments he had to look forward to! And all the while the priest
was speaking Genji thought of his own wickedness. What a good</p>
<p>idea it would be to turn hermit, and live in some such place! . .
.</p>
<p>But immediately his thoughts strayed to the lovely face which he</p>
<p>had seen that afternoon; and longing to know more of her he asked,
“Who lives with you here ?” 24</p>
<p>By the cooperation of the author Genji’s first wife dies in
childbirth, and he is left free to give first place in his home to his
new princess, Murasaki.* It may be that the excellence of the
translation gives this book an ex- traneous advantage over other
Japanese masterpieces that have been rendered into English; perhaps
Mr. Waley, like Fitzgerald, has improved upon his original. If, for the
occasion, we can forget our own moral code, and fall in with one that
permits men and women, as Wordsworth said of those in Wilhelm Meister,
to “mate like flies in the air,” we shall derive from this Tale of Genji
the most attractive glimpse yet opened to us of the beauties -hidden in
Japanese literature. Murasaki writes with a naturalness and ease that
soon turn her pages into the charming gossip of a cultured friend. The
men and women, above all the children, who move through her leisurely
pages are ingratiatingly real; and the world which she de-</p>
<ul>
<li>The present writer regrets that the brevity of life has prevented
his reading more than the first of the four volumes into which Arthur
Waley has so perfectly translated Murasaki’s tale.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(chap. </p>
<p>XXXscribes, though it is confined for the most part to imperial
palaces and palatial homes, has all the color of a life actually lived
or seen.* It is an aristocratic life, not much concerned with the cost
of bread and love; but within that limitation it is described without
sensational resort to exceptional characters or events. As Lady Murasaki
makes Uma no-Kami say of certain realistic painters:</p>
<p>Ordinary hills and rivers, just as they are, houses such as you
may</p>
<p>see everywhere, with all their real beauty of harmony and form —</p>
<p>quietly to draw such scenes as this, or to show what lies behind</p>
<p>some intimate hedge that is folded away far from the world, and</p>
<p>thick trees upon some unheroic hill, and all this with befitting
care</p>
<p>for composition, proportion and the life — such works demand the</p>
<p>highe st master’s utmost skill, and must needs draw the common</p>
<p>craftsman into a thousand blunders.”</p>
<p>No later Japanese novel has reached the excellence of Genji, or has
had so profound an influence upon the literary development of the
language.” During the eighteenth century fiction had another zenith, and
various novelists succeeded in surpassing the Lady Murasaki in the
length of their tales, or the freedom of their pornography.” Santo
Kioden published in 1791 an Edifying Story Book, but it proved so little
to its purpose that the authorities, under the law prohibiting
indecency, sentenced him to be handcuffed for fifty days in his own
home. Santo was a vendor of tobacco- pouches and quack medicines; he
married a harlot, and made his first repu- tation by a volume on the
brothels of Tokyo. He gradually reformed the morals of his pen, but
could not unteach his public the habit of buying great quantities of his
books. Encouraged, he violated all precedents in the history of Japanese
fiction by demanding payment from the men who pub- lished his works; his
predecessors, it seemed, had been content with an in-</p>
<ul>
<li>Even into the ordinary home our Lady enters with understanding, and
makes Uma no-Kami express, about the year 1000, a modernistic plea for
feminine education: “Then there is the zealous housewife, who,
regardless of her appearance, twists her hair behind her ears, and
devotes herself entirely to the details of our domestic welfare. The hus
- band, in his comings and goings about the world, is certain to see and
hear many things which he cannot discuss with strangers, but would
gladly talk over with an intimate who could listen with sympathy and
understanding, some one who could laugh with him or weep, as need be. It
often happens, too, that some political event will greatly perturb or
amuse him, and he sits apart longing to tell some one about it. But the
wife only says, lightly, ’What is the matter?* and shows no interest.

<p>vitation to dinner. Most of the fiction writers were poor Bohemians,
whom the people classed with actors among the lowest ranks of society.“
Less sensational and more ably written than Kioden’s were the novels of
Kyokutei Bakin (1767-1848), who, like Scott and Dumas, transformed
history into vivid romance. His readers grew so fond of him that he un-
wound one of his stories into a hundred volumes. Hokusai illustrated
some of Bakin’s novels until, being geniuses, they quarreled and
parted.</p>
<p>The j oiliest of these later novelists was Jippensha Ikku (d. 1831),
the Le Sage and Dickens of Japan. Ikku began his adult life with three
mar- riages, of which two were quickly ended by fathers-in-law who could
not understand his literary habits. He accepted poverty with good humor,
and, having no furniture, hung his bare walls with paintings of the
furni- ture he might have had. On holidays he sacrified to the gods with
pictures of excellent offerings. Being presented with a bathtub in the
common interest, he carried it home inverted on his head, and overthrew
with ready wit the pedestrians who fell in his way. When his publisher
came to see him he invited him to take a bath; and while his invitation
was being ac- cepted he decked him self in the publisher’s clothes, and
paid his New Year’s Day calls in proper ceremonial costume. His
masterpiece, the</p>
<p>Hizakurige, was published in twelve parts between 1802 and 1822, and
told a rollicking tale in the vein of The Posthumous Papers of the Pick-
wick Club — Aston calls it “the most humorous and entertaining book in
the Japanese language.”” On his deathbed Ikku enjoined his pupils to
place upon his corpse, before the cremation then usual in Japan, certain
packets which he solemnly entrusted to them. At his funeral, prayers
hav- ing been said, the pyre was lighted, whereupon it turned out that
the packets were full of firecrackers, which exploded merrily. Ikku had
kept his youthful promise that his life would be full of surprises, even
after his death.</p>
<p>2 . History</p>
<p>The historians — Arai Hakuseki</p>
<p>We shall not find Japanese historiography so interesting as its
fiction, though we may have some difficulty in distinguishing them. The
oldest sur- viving work in Japanese literature is the Kojiki, or “Record
of Ancient Things,” written in Chinese characters by Yasumaro in 712;
here legend so often takes the place of fact that the highest Shinto
loyalty would be needed to accept it as history. 31 After the Great
Reform of 645 the government</p>
<p>886 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXthought it advisable to transform the past again; and about 720 a
new history appeared, the Nihongi , or “Record of Nippon,” written in
the Chinese lan - guage, and adorned with passages bravely stolen from
Chinese works and sometimes placed, without any fetichism of chronology,
in the mouths of ancient Japanese. Nevertheless the book was a more
serious attempt to record the facts than the Kojiki had been, and it
provided the foundation for most later histories of early Japan. From
that time to this there have been many histories of the country, each
more patriotic than the last. In 1334 Kitabatake wrote a “History of the
True Succession of the Divine Monarchs”— the Jintoshotoki — on this
modest and now familiar note:</p>
<p>Great Yamato (Japan) is a divine country. It is only our land</p>
<p>whose foundations were first laid by the Divine Ancestor. It
alone</p>
<p>has been transmitted by the Sun Goddess to a long line of her</p>
<p>descendants. There is nothing of this kind in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Therefore it is called the Divine Land. 82</p>
<p>First printed in 1649, this work began that movement for the
restoration of the ancient faith and state which culminated in the
passionate polemics of Moto-ori. The very grandson of Iyeyasu,
Mitsu-kuni, by his Dai Nihonshi (“The Great History of Japan,” 1851)— a
240-volume picture of the imperial and feudal past — played a posthumous
part in preparing his countrymen to overthrow the Tokugawa
Shogunate.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most scholarly and impartial of Japanese historians was
Arai Hakuseki, whose learning dominated the intellectual life of Yedo in
the second half of the seventeenth century. Arai smiled at the theology
of the orthodox Christian missionaries as “very childish,” 33 but he w
as bold enough to ridicule also some of the legends which his own people
mistook for his- tory. 84 His greatest work, the Hankampu , a
thirty-volume history of the Daimyo, is one of the marvels of
literature; for though it must have required much research, it appears
to have been composed within a few months. 85 Arai derived something of
his learning and judgment from his study of the Chinese philosophers.
When he lectured on the Confucian classics the Shogun Iyenobu, we are
told, listened with rapt and reverent attention, in summer refraining
from brushing the mosquitoes from his head, in winter turning his head
away from the speaker before wiping his running nose. 86 In his auto-
biography Arai paints a devout picture of his father, and shows the
Japanese citizen at his simplest and best:</p>
<p>Ever since I came to understand the heart of things, my memory</p>
<p>is that the daily routine of his life was exactly the same. He
never</p>
<p>failed to get up an hour before daybreak. He then had a cold
bath,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 887</p>
<p>and did his hair himself. In cold weather the woman who was my</p>
<p>mother would propose to order hot water for him, but this he would
not allow, as he wished to avoid giving the servants trouble. When</p>
<p>he was over seventy, and my mother also was advanced in years,</p>
<p>sometimes, when the cold weather was unendurable, a lighted</p>
<p>brazier was brought in, and they lay down to sleep with their
feet</p>
<p>against it. Beside the fire was placed a kettle with hot water,
which</p>
<p>my father drank when he got up. Both of them honored the way</p>
<p>of Buddha. My father, when he had arranged his hair and adjusted</p>
<p>his clothing, never neglected to make obeisance to Buddha. . . .</p>
<p>After he was dressed he waited quietly for the dawn, and then went
out to his official duty. … He was never known to betray anger,</p>
<p>nor do I remember that, even when he laughed, he gave way to</p>
<p>boisterous mirth. Much less did he ever descend to violent language
when he had occasion to reprimand anyone. In his conversation he</p>
<p>used as few words as possible. His demeanor was grave. I have</p>
<p>never seen him startled, flurried, or impatient. . . . The room
he</p>
<p>usually occupied he kept cleanly swept, had an old picture hung
on</p>
<p>the wall, and a few flowers which were in season were set out in
a</p>
<p>vase. He would spend the day looking at them. He painted a little</p>
<p>in black and white, not being fond of colors. When in good health</p>
<p>he never troubled the servant, but did everything for himself .

Japanese litera- ture. Here, as in fiction, a woman stands at the top;
for Lady Sei Shona- gon’s “Pillow Sketches” ( Makura Zoshi) is usually
accorded the highest as well as the earliest place in this field.
Brought up in the same court and generation as Lady Murasaki, she chose
to describe the refined and scan- dalous life about her in casual
sketches whose excellence in the original can only be guessed at by us
from the charm that survives in translation. Born a Fujiwara, she rose
to be a lady in waiting to the Empress. On the latter’s death Lady Sei
retired, some say to a convent, others say to poverty. Her book shows no
touch of either. She takes the easy morals of her time according to the
easy judgment of her time, and does not think too highly of spoil-sport
ecclesiastics.</p>

seven feet high, and settled down contentedly to undisturbed philosophy
and a quiet comrade- ship with natural things. An American, reading him,

<li>THE DRAMA</li>
</ol>
<p>The “No” plays — Their character — The popular stage — The</p>
<p>Japanese Shakespeare — Summary judgment</p>
<p>Last of all, and hardest to understand, is the Japanese drama.
Brought up in our English tradition of the theatre, from Henry IV to
Mary of</p>
<p>Scotland, how shall we ever attune ourselves to tolerate what must
seem to us the fustian and pantomime of the No plays of Japan? We must
forget Shakespeare and go back to Everyman, and even farther to the
religious! origins of Greek and modern European drama; then we shall be
oriented to watch the development of the ancient Shinto pantomime, the
ecclesias- tical kagura dance, into that illumination of pantomime by
dialogue which constitutes the No (or lyrical) form of Japanese play.
About the four- teenth century Buddhist priests added choral songs to
their processional pantomimes; then they added individual characters,
contrived a plot to give them action as well as speech, and the drama
was born.“</p>
<p>These plays, like the Greek, were performed in trilogies; and
occasion- ally Kyogen, or farces (“mad words”), were acted in the
intervals, to re - lieve and facilitate the tension of emotion and
thought. The first part of the trilogy was devoted to propitiating the
gods, and was hardly more than a religious pantomime; the second was
performed in full armor, and was designed to frighten all evil spirits
away; the third was of a</p>
<p>milder mood, and sought to portray some charming aspect of nature, or
some delightful phase of Japanese life. 41 The lines were written for
the most part in blank verse of twelve syllables. The actors were men of
stand- ing, even among the aristocracy; a playbill survives which
indicates that Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu all participated as
actors in a No play about 1 580.“ Each actor wore a mask, carved out of
wood with an artistry that makes such masks a prize for the art
collector of today. Scenery was</p>

<p>890 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXmeagre; the passionate imagination of the audience could be relied
upon to create the background of the action. The stories were of the
simplest, and did not matter much: one of the most popular told of the
impover- ished Samurai who, to warm a wandering monk, cut down his most
cher- ished plants to make a fire; whereupon the monk turned out to be
the Regent, and gave the knight a goodly reward. But as we in the West
may go again and again to hear an opera whose story is old and perhaps
ridicu- lous, so the Japanese, even today, weep over this oft-told
tale,“ because the excellence of the acting renews on each occasion the
power and sig- nificance of the play. To the hasty and businesslike
visitor such perform- ances as he may find of these dramatized lyrics
are rather amusing than im- pressive; nevertheless a Japanese poet says
of them: “Oh, what a tragedy</p>
<p>The history of the drama, in most countries, is a gradual change from
the predominance of the chorus to the supremacy of some individual role
— at which point, in most such sequences, development ends. As the his-
trionic art advanced in tradition and excellence in Japan it created
popular personalities who subordinated the play to themselves. Finally
panto- mime and religion sank to a subordinate role, and the drama
became a war of individuals, full of violence and romance. So was born
the kabuki shibai, or popular theatre, of Japan. The first such theatre
was established about the year 1 600 by a nun who, tired of convent
walls, set up a stage at Osaka, and practised dancing for a livelihood.“
As in England and France, the presence of women on the stage seemed
revolting and was forbidden; and since the upper classes (except in safe
disguise) shunned these per- formances, the actors became almost a
pariah caste, with no social incen- tive to keep their profession from
immorality and corruption. Men per- force took the parts of women, and
carried their imitation to such a point as to deceive not only their
audiences but themselves; many of these actors of female roles remained
women off the stage.“ Perhaps because lighting was poor, the actors
painted their faces with vivid colors, and wore robes of gorgeous
designs to indicate and dignify their roles. Back of the stage and about
it, usually, were choral and individual reciters, who sometimes car-
ried on the vocal parts while the actors confined themselves to
pantomime. The audience sat on the matted floor, or in tiers of boxes at
either side.“ CHAP.XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 891</p>
<p>The most famous name in the popular drama of Japan is Chikamatsu
Monzayemon (1653-1724). His countrymen compare him with Shake- speare;
English critics, resenting the comparison, accuse Chikamatsu of
violence, extravagance, bombast, and improbable plots, while granting
him “a certain barbaric vigor and luxuriance”;“ apparently the
similarity is complete. Such foreign plays seem mere melodrama to us,
because either the meaning or the nuances of the language are concealed
from us; but this would probably be the effect of a Shakespearean play
upon one unable to appreciate its language or follow its thought.
Chikamatsu seems to have made undue use of lovers’ suicides to ca p his
climaxes, in the style of Romeo and Juliet; but perhaps with this
excuse, that suicide was almost as popular in Japanese life as on the
stage.</p>
<p>A foreign historian, in these matters, can only report, but cannot
judge. Japanese acting, to a transient observer, seems less complex and
mature, but more vigorous and exalting than the European; Japanese plays
seem more plebeianly melodramatic, but less emasculated with superficial
intellectual- ism, than the plays of France, England and America today.
So, reversely, Japanese poetry seems slight and bloodless, and too
aristocratically refined, to us whose appetite has taken in lyrics of
almost epic length (like Maud), and epics of such dulness that doubtless
Homer himself would nod if he were compelled to read the accumulated
Iliad. The Japanese novel seems sensational and sentimental; and yet two
of the supreme masterpieces of English fiction — Tom Jones and Pickwick
Papers — have apparently their equal counterparts in the Genji
Monogatari and the Hizakurige, and per- haps Lady Murasaki excels in
subtlety, grace and understanding even the great Fielding himself. All
things are dull that are remote and obscure; and things Japanese will
remain obscure to us until we can completely forget our West ern
heritage and completely absorb Japan’s.</p>

<p>The outward forms of Japanese art, like almost every external feature
of Japanese life, came from China; the inner force and spirit, like
every- thing essential in Japan, came from the people themselves. It is
true that the wave of ideas and immigration that brought Buddhism to
Japan in the seventh century brought also, from China and Korea, art
forms and im-</p>

<p>XXXpulses bound up with that faith, and no more original with China
and Korea than with Japan; it is true, even, that cultural elements
entered not only from China and India, but from Assyria and Greece — the
features of the Kamakura Buddha, for example, are more Greco-Bactrian
than Japa- nese. But such foreign stimuli were used creatively in Japan;
its people learned quickly to distinguish beauty from ugliness; its rich
men sometimes prized objects of art more than land or gold,* and its
artists labored with self-effacing devotion. These men, though arduously
trained through a long apprenticeship, seldom received more than an
artisan’s wage; if for a moment wealth came to them they gave it away
with Bohemian reckless- ness, and soon relapsed into a natural and
comfortable poverty.” But only the artist-artisans of ancient Egypt and
Greece, or of medieval China, could rival their industry, taste and
skill.</p>
<p>The very life of the people was instinct with art — in the neatness
of their homes, the beauty of their clothing, the refinements of their
ornaments, and their spontaneous addiction to song and dance. For music,
like life, had come to Japan from the gods themselves; had not Izanagi
and Izanami sung in choruses at the creation of the earth? A thousand
years later the Emperor Inkyo, we read, played on a wagon (a kind of
zither), and his Empress danced, at an imperial banquet given in 419 to
signalize the open- ing of a new palace. When Inkyo died a Korean king
sent eighty musicians to attend the funeral; and these players taught
the Japanese new instru- ments and new modes — some from Korea, some
from China, some from India. When the Daibutsu was installed in the
temple of Todaiji at Nara (752), music from T’ang Chinese masters was
played in the ceremony;</p>

other</p>
<p>onlookers seen feet tread so delicately, nor heads so exquisitely
poised</p>
<p>So moving and beautiful was this dance that at the end of it the
Emperor’s eye s were wet, and all the princes and great gentlemen wept
aloud .” 54</p>
<p>Meanwhile all who could afford it adorned their persons not only with
fine brocades and painted silks, but with delicate objects
characteristic, al- most definitive, of the old Japan. Shrinking ladies
flirted from behind fans of alluring loveliness, while men flaunted
netsuke, inro and expensively carved swords. The inro was a little box
attached to the belt by a cord; it was usually composed of several
infolding cases carefully carved in ivory or wood, and contained
tobacco, coins, writing materials, or other casual necessities. To keep
the cord from slipping under the belt, it was bound at the other end to
a tiny toggle or netsuke (from ne, end, and tsuke, to fasten) , upon
whose cramped surface some artist had fashioned, with lav- ish care, the
forms of deities or demons, philosophers or fairies, birds or reptiles,
fishes or insects, flowers or leaves, or scenes from the life of the
people. Here that impish humor in which J apanese art so far excels all
others found free and yet modest play. Only the most careful examination
can reveal the full subtlety and significance of these representations;
but even a glance at this microcosm of fat women and priests, of agile
monkeys and delightful bugs, cut upon less than a cubic inch of ivory or
wood, brings home to the student the unique and passionately artistic
quality of the Japanese people.*</p>
<p>Hidari (i.e., “left - handed”) Jingaro was the most famous of
Japanese sculptors in wood. Legend told how he had lost an arm and
gotten a name: when an offended conqueror demanded of Jingaro’s Daimyo
the life of his daughter, Jingaro carved a severed head so realistically
that the conqueror ordered the artist’s right hand to be cut of f as
punishment for killing the daughter of his lord . 53 It was Jingaro
whose chisel formed the</p>

<p>elephants and the sleeping cat at the shrine of Iyeyasu at Nikko, and
the “Gate of the Imperial Envoy” at the Nishi -Hongwan Temple in Kyoto.
On the inner panels of this gate the artist told the story of the
Chinese sage who washed his ear because it had been contaminated by a
proposal that he should accept the throne of his country, and the
austere cowherd who quarreled with the sage for thus defiling the
river.“ But Jingaro was merely the most characterful of the now nameless
artists who adorned a thousand structures with lovingly carved or
lacquered wood. The lacquer tree found in the islands a peculiarly
congenial habitat, and was nourished with skilful care. The artisans
sometimes covered with successive coats of lacquer, cotton and lacquer a
form chiseled in wood; but more often they went to the pains of modeling
a statue in clay, making from this a hollow mould, and then pouring into
the mould several layers of lacquer, each thicker than before.“ The
Japanese carver lifted wood to a full equality with marble as a material
for art, and filled shrines, mausolea and palaces with the fairest
wood-decoration known in Asia.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">

</ol>
<p>Temples — Palaces — The shrine of Iyeyasu — Homes</p>
<p>In the year 594 the Empress Suiko, being convinced of the truth
or</p>
<p>utility of Buddhism, ordered the building of Buddhist temples
throughout her realm. Prince Shotoku, who was entrusted with carrying
out this edict, brought in from Korea priests, architects, wood-carvers,
bronze found- ers, clay modelers, masons, gilders, tile-makers, weavers,
and other skilled artisans.“ This vast cultural importation was almost
the beginning of art in Japan, for Shinto had frowned upon ornate
edifices and had counte- nanced no figures to misrepresent the gods.
From that moment Buddhist shrines and statuary filled the land. The
temples were essentially like those of China, but more richly ornamented
and more delicately carved. Here, too, majestic torii, or gateways,
marked the ascent or approach to the sacred retreat; bright colors
adorned the wooden walls, great beams held up a tiled roof gleaming
under the sun, and minor structures — a drum- tower, e. g., or a pagoda
— mediated between the central sanctuary and the surrounding trees. The
greatest achievements of the foreign artists was the group of temples at
Horiuji, raised under the guidance of Prince Shotoku near Nara about the
year 616. It stands to the credit of the most</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 895</p>
<p>living of building materials that one of these wooden edifices has
survived unnumbered earthquakes and outlasted a hundred thousand temples
of stone; and it stands to the glory of the builders that nothing
erected in later Japan has surpassed the simple majesty of this oldest
shrine. Per- haps as beautiful, and only slightly younger, are the
temples of Nara itself, above all the perfectly proportioned Golden Hall
of the Todaiji Temple there; Nara, says Ralph Adams Cram, contains “the
most precious architecture in all Asia.” 50</p>
<p>The next zenith of building in Japan came under the Ashikaga Sho-</p>
<p>gunate. Yoshimitsu, resolved to make Kyoto the fairest capital on
earth, built for the gods a pagoda 360 feet high; for his mother the
Takakura Palace, of which a single door cost 20,000 pieces of gold
(50,000); for himself a Flower Palace, that consumed ,000,000; and the
Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji for the glory of all.“ Hideyoshi too tried
to rival</p>
<p>Kublai Khan, and built at Momoyama a “Palace of Pleasure” which his
whim tore down again a few years after its completion; we may judge its
magnificence from the “day long portal” removed from it to adorn the
temple of Nishi-Hongwan; all day long, said its admirers, one might gaze
at that carved portal without exhausting its excellence. Kano Yeitoku
played Ictinus and Pheidias to Hideyoshi, but adorned his buildings with
Venetian splendor rather than with Attic restraint; never had Japan, or
Asia, seen such abounding decoration before. Under Hideyoshi, too, the
gloomy Castle of Osaka took form, to dominate the Pittsburgh of Japan,
and become the death-place of his son.</p>
<p>Iyeyasu inclined rather to philosophy and letters than to art; but
after his death his grandson, Iyemitsu, content himself with a wooden
shanty for his palace, lavished the resources of Japanese wealth and art
to build around the ashes of Iyeyasu at Nikko the fairest memorial ever
raised to any individual in the Far East. Here, ninety miles from Tokyo,
on a quiet hill reached by a shaded avenue of stately cryptomerias, the
architects of the Shogun laid down first a series of spacious and
gradual approaches, then an ornate but lovely Yo-mei-mon Gate, then, by
a brook crossed with a sacred and untouchable bridge, a series of
mausolea and temples in lacquered wood, femininely beautiful and frail.
The decoration is extrava- gant, the construction is weak, the
omnipresent red paint flares like a hectic rouge amid the modest green
of the trees; and yet a country in- carnadined with blossoms every
spring may need brighter colors to express its spirit than those that
might serve and please a less impassioned race.</p>
<p>896 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXWe cannot quite call this architecture great, for the demon of
earth- quake has willed that Japan should build on a timid scale, and
not pile stones into the sky to crash destructively when the planet
wrinkles its skin. Hence the homes are of wood and seldom rise beyond a
story or two; only the repeated experience of fire and the reiterated
commands of the government prevailed upon the citizens of the cities,
when they could afford it, to cover their wooden cottages and palaces
with roofs of the. The aristocracy, unable to raise their mansions into
the clouds, spread them spaciously over the earth, despite an imperial
edict limiting the size of a dwelling to 240 yards square. A palace, was
rarely one building; usually it was a main structure connected by
covered walks with sub- ordinate edifices for various groups in the
family. There was no distinction of dining-room, living-room or bedroom;
the same chamber could serve any purpose, for at a moment’s notice a
table might be laid down upon the matted floor, or the rolled up bedding
might be taken from its hiding- place and spread out for the night.
Sliding panels or removable partitions separated or united the rooms,
and even the latticed or windowed walls were easily folded up to give
full play to the sun, or the cooling evening air. Pretty blinds of split
bamboo offered shade and privacy. Windows were a luxury; in the poorer
homes the summer light found many open- ings, which in winter were
blocked up with oiled paper to keep out the cold. Japanese architecture
gives the appearance of having been born in the tropics, and of having
been transported too recklesssly into islands that stretch up their
necks to shivering Kamchatka. In the more southern towns these fragile
and simple homes have a style and beauty of their own, and offer
appropriate dwellings for the once gay children of the sun.</p>

<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 897</p>
<p>brilliant that legends arose to commemorate their perfection. So a
peasant, having bought a mirror for the first time, thought that he
recognized in it the face of his dead father; he hid it as a great
treasure, but so often con- sulted it that his suspicious wife ferreted
it out, and was horrified to find in it the picture of a woman about her
own age, who was apparently her husband’s mistress.” Still other
artisans cast tremendous bells, like the forty-nine-ton monster at Nara
(732 a.d.), and brought from them a sweeter tone than our clanging metal
clappers elicit in the West, by strik- ing a boss on the outer surface
of the bell with a swinging beam of wood.</p>
<p>The sculptors used wood or metal rather than stone, since their soil
was poor in granite and marble; and yet, despite all difficulties of
material, they came to surpass their Chinese and Korean teachers in this
most definitive of all the arts — for every other art secretly emulates
sculpture’s patient removal of the inappropriate. Almost the earliest,
and perhaps the greatest, masterpiece of sculpture in Japan is the
bronze Trinity at Horiuji — a Buddha seated on a lotus bud between two
Bodhisattwas, before a screen and halo of bronze only less beautiful
than the stone lacery of Aurangzeb’s screen in the Taj Mahal. We do not
know whose hands</p>
<p>reared these temples and built this statuary; we may admit Korean
teachers, Chinese examples, Indian motives, even Greek influences coming
down from far Ionia across a thousand years; but we are sure that this
Trinity is among the most signal accomplishments in the history of
art.*</p>
<p>Possibly because their stature was short, and their bodies could
hardly contain all the ambitions and capacities of their souls, the
Japanese took pleasure in building colossi, and had better success in
this questionable art than even the Egyptians. In the year 747, an
epidemic of smallpox having broken out in Japan, the Emperor Shomu
commissioned Kimimaro to cast a gigantic Buddha in propitiation of the
gods. For this purpose Kimimaro used 437 tons of bronze, 288 pounds of
gold, 165 pounds of</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the great Shotoku Taishi, statesman and artist, had
something to do with this achievement, for we know that he plied the
chisel, and cut many statues in wood. 63 Kobo Daishi (ca. 816) was a
sculptor as well as a painter, a scholar and a saint; Hokusai, to
suggest his versatility, pictured him wielding five brushes at once,
with hands and feet and mouth. 64 Unkei (1180-1220) made characterful
portrait-busts of him- self and many priests, and carved delightfully
terrible figures of Hell’s Supreme Court,</li>

<p>XXXmercury, seven tons of vegetable wax, and several tons of
charcoal. Two years and seven attempts were required for the work. The
head was cast in a single mould, but the body was formed of several
metal plates soldered together and thickly covered with gold. More
impressive to the foreign eye than this saturnine countenance at Nara is
the Daibutsu of Kamakura, cast of bronze in 1252 by Ono Goroyemon; here,
perhaps be- cause the colossus sits on an elevation in the open air,
within a pleasant entourage of trees, the size seems to accord with the
purpose, and the artist has expressed with remarkable simplicity the
spirit of Buddhist contempla- tion and peace. Once a temple housed the
figure, as still is the case at Nara; but in 1495 a great tidal wave
destroyed both the temple and the town, leaving the bronze philosopher
serene amid widespread destruction, suffer- ing and death. Hideyoshi too
built a colossus at Kyoto; for five years fifty thousand men labored at
this Buddha, and the great Taiko himself, clad in the garb of a common
laborer, sometimes helped them conspicuously at their task. But hardly
had it been erected when, in 1596, an earthquake threw it down, and
scattered the wreckage of its sheltering sanctuary about its head.
Hideyoshi, says Japanese story, shot an arrow at the fallen idol,
saying, scornfully, “I placed you here at great expense, and you cannot
even defend your own temple.” 65</p>
<p>From such colossi to dangling netsuke Japanese sculpture ran the
range of every figure and every size. Sometimes its masters, like
Takamura to- day, gave years of labor to figures hardly a foot tall, and
took delight in representing gnarled octogenarians, jolly gourmands and
philosophic friars. It was good that humor sustained them, for most of
the gains that came from their toil went to their subtle employers
rather than to themselves, and in their larger works they were much
harassed by conventions of sub- ject and treatment laid upon them by the
priests. The priests wanted gods, not courtesans, from the sculptors;
they wished to inspire the people to piety, or to fashion their virtues
with fear, rather than to arouse in them the sense and ecstasy of
beauty. Bound hand and soul to religion, sculp- ture decayed when faith
lost its warmth and power; and, as in Egypt, the stiffness of
conventions, when piety had fled, became the rigor of death.</p>

<p>The Chinese stimulus — The potters of Hizen — Pottery and tea —</p>
<p>How Goto Saijiro brought the art of porcelain from Hizen</p>
<p>to Kaga — The nineteenth century</p>
<p>In a sense it is not quite just to Japan to speak of her importing
civiliza- tion from Korea and China, except in the sense in which
northwestern Europe took its civilization from Greece and Rome. We might
also view all the peoples of the Far East as one ethnic and cultural
unity, in which each part, like the provinces of one country, produced
in its time and place an art and culture akin to and dependent upon the
art and culture of the rest. So Japanese pottery is a part and phase of
Far Eastern ceramics, fundamentally like the Chinese, and yet stamped
with the characteristic delicacy and fineness of all Japanese work.
Until the coming of the Korean artisans in the seventh century, Japanese
pottery was merely an industry, moulding crude materials for common use;
there was, apparently, no glazed pottery in the Far East be- fore the
eighth century, much less any porcelain. 66 The industry became an art
largely as a result of the entrance of tea in the thirteenth century.
Chinese tea-cups of Sung design came in with tea, and aroused the
admiration of the Japanese. In the year 1223 Kato Shirozemon, a Japanese
potter, made his way perilously to China, studied ceramics there for six
years, returned to set up his own factory at Seto, and so far surpassed
all preceding pottery in the islands that Seto-mono , or Seto-ware&gt;
became a generic name for all Japanese pottery, just as chinaware , in
the seventeenth century, became the English term for porcelain. The
Shogun Yoritomo made Shirozemon’s future by setting the fashion of
rewarding minor services with presents of Shirozemon’s tea-jars, filled
with the new marvel of powdered tea. Today the surviving specimens of
this Toshiro-yaki* are accounted almost beyond price; they are swathed
in costly brocade, and kept in boxes of the finest lacquer, while their
owners are spoken of with bated breath as the aristocracy of
connoisseurs. 67</p>
<p>Three hundred years later another Japanese, Shonzui, was lured to
China to study its famous potteries. On his return he established a
factory at Arita, in the province of Hizen. He was harassed, however, by
the difficulty of finding in the soil of his country minerals as well
adapted as those of China to make a fine pate; and it was said of his
products that one of their main ingredients was the bones of his
artisans. Nevertheless Shonzui’s wares of Mohammedan blue were so
excellent that the Chinese potters of the eight- eenth century did their
best to imitate them for export under his counter-</p>

<p>XXXfeited name; and the extant examples of his work are now as highly
valued as the rarest paintings of Japan’s greatest ma sters of the
brush. 68 About 1605 a Korean, Risampei, discovered at Izumi-yama, in
the Arita district, immense deposits of porcelain stone; and from that
moment Hizen became the center of the ceramic industry in Japan. In
Arita, too, labored the famous Kakiemon, who, after learning the art of
enameling from a Chinese ship-master, made his name almost synonymous
with delicately decorated enameled porcelain. Dutch merchants shipped
large quantities of Hizen products to Europe from the port of Arita at
Imari; 44,943 pieces went to Holland alone in the year</p>
<ol start="1664" type="1">
<li>This brilliant Imari-yaki became the rage in Europe, and inspired
Aebregt de Reiser to inaugurate the golden age of Dutch ceramics in his
factories at Delft.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile the rise of the tea ceremony had stimulated a further
develop- ment in Japan. In 1578 Nobunaga, at the suggestion of the
tea-master Rikyu, gave a large order for cups and other tea utensils to
a family of Korean potters at Kyoto. A few years later Hideyoshi
rewarded the family with a gold seal, and made its wares, the Raku-yaki
, almost de rigueur for the ritual of drinking tea. Hideyoshi’s generals
returned from their unsuccessful in - vasion of Korea with numerous
captives, among whom, by a discrimination unusual in warriors, were many
artists. In 1596 Shimazu Yoshihiro brought to Satsuma a hundred skilled
Koreans, including seventeen potters; and these men, with their
successors, established throughout the world the high repu- tation of
Satsuma for that richly colored glazed ware to which an Italian town has
given our name of faience . But the greatest Japanese master in this
branch of the art was the Kyoto potter Ninsei. Not only did he originate
enameled faience, but he gave to his products a grace and proud
restraint that have made them precious to collectors ever since, so that
his mark has been more often counterfeited than that of any other artist
in Japan. 09 Be- cause of his work, decorated faience mounted to the
intensity of a craze in the capital, and in some quarters of Kyoto every
second house was turned into a miniature pottery. 70 Only less famous
than Ninsei was Kenzan, older brother of the painter Korin.</p>
<p>The romance that so often lurks behind ceramics appears in the story
of how Goto Saijiro brought the art of porcelain from Hizen to Kaga. An
excellent bed of potter’s stone having been discovered near the village
of Kutani, the feudal lord of the province resolved to establish a
porcelain in- dustry there; and Goto was sent to Hizen to study its
methods of firing and design. But the secrets of the potters were so
carefully concealed from out- siders that Goto for a while was baffled.
Finally he disguised himself as a servant, and accepted a menial place
in the household of a potter. After three years his master admitted him
to a pottery, and there Goto worked for four</p>
<p>9oi</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX ) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN</p>
<p>years more. Then he deserted the wife whom he had married at Hizen
and the children whom she had borne to him, and fled to Kaga, where he
gave his lord a full report of the methods he had learned. From that
time on (1664) the potters of Kutani became masters, and Kutani-yaki
rivaled the best wares of Japan. 71</p>
<p>The Hizen potteries retained their leadership throughout the
eighteenth century, largely as a result of the benevolent care which the
feudal lord of Hirado lavished upon the workmen in his factories; for a
century ( 1750-</p>
<ol start="1843" type="1">
<li>the blue Michawaki wares of Hirado stood at the head of Japanese
porcelains. In the nineteenth century Zengoro Hozen brought the
leadership to Kyoto by clever imitations that often surpassed his
models, so that some- times it became impossible to decide which was the
original and which was the copy. In the final quarter of the century
Japan developed cloisonne enameling from the crude condition in which it
had remained since its entry from China, and took the lead of the world
in this field of ceramics. 72 Other branches deteriorated during the
same period, for the rising demand of Europe for Japanese pottery led to
a style of exaggerated decoration alien to the native taste, and the
habits engendered in meeting these foreign orders affected the skill and
weakened the traditions of the art. Here, as every- where, the coming of
industry has been for a while a blight; mass produc- tion has taken the
place of quality, and mass consumption has replaced dis- criminating
taste. Perhaps, after invention has run its fertile course, and social
organization and experience have spread the gift of leisure and taught
its creative use, the curse may be turned into a blessing; industry may
lavish comforts upon the majority of men, while the worker, after paying
his lowered tribute of hours to the machine, may once again become an
artisan, and turn the mechanical product, by loving individual
treatment, into a work of personality and art.</li>

<p>902 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXcivilization. The masterpieces of Japanese painting cover a period
of twelve hundred years, are divided amongst a complex multiplicity of
schools, have been lost or injured in the flow of time, and are nearly
all hidden away in private collections in Japan.* Those few chef - d’
oeuvres that are open to alien study are so different in form, method,
style and material from Western pictures that no competent judgment can
be passed upon them by the Occidental mind.</p>
<p>First of all, like their models in China, the paintings of Japan were
once made with the same brush that was used in writing, and, as in
Greece, the word for writing and for painting was originally one;
painting was a</p>
<p>graphic art. This initial fact has determined half the
characteristics of Far Eastern painting, from the materials used to the
subordination of color to line. The materials are simple: ink or
water-colors, a brush, and absorbent paper or silk. The labor is
difficult: the artist works not erect but on his knees, bending over the
silk or paper on the floor; and he must learn to con- trol his stroke so
as to make seventy-one different degrees or styles of touch . 73 In the
earlier centuries, when Buddhism ruled the art of Japan, frescoes were
painted, much in the manner of Ajanta or Turkestan; but nearly all the
extant works of high repute take the form either of makimono (scrolls),
kakemono (hangings), or screens. These pictures were made not to be
arranged indigestibly in picture galleries — for there are no such
galleries in Japan — but to be viewed in private by the owner and . his
friends, or to form a part of some decorative scheme in a temple, a
palace or a home. They were very seldom portraits of specific
personalities; us- ually they were glimpses of nature, or scenes of
martial action, or strokes of humorous or satirical observation of the
ways of animals, women and men.</p>
<p>They were poems of feeling rather than representations of things, and
were closer to philosophy than to photography. The Japanese artist let
realism alone, and rarely tried to imitate the external form of reality.
He scornfully left out shadows as irrelevant to essences, preferring to
paint in plein air, with no modeling play of light and shade; and he
smiled at West- ern insistence on the persp ective reduction of distant
things. “In Japanese painting,” said Hokusai, with philosophic
tolerance, “form and color are represented without any attempt at
relief, but in European methods relief and illusion are sought for .” 74
The Japanese artist wis hed to convey a feel-</p>

<p>ing rather than an object, to suggest rather than to represent; it
was un- necessary, in his judgment, to show more than a few significant
elements in a scene; as in a Japanese poem, only so much should be shown
as would arouse the appreciative mind to contribute to the esthetic
result by its own imagination. The painter too was a poet, and valued
the rhythm of line and the music of forms infinitely more than the
haphazard shape and structure of things. And like the poet he felt that
if he were true to his own feeling it would be realism enough.</p>
<p>It was probably Korea that brought painting to the restless empire
that now has conquered her. Korean artists, presumably, painted the
flowing and colorful frescoes of the Horiuji Temple, for there is
nothing in the known history of Japan before the seventh century that
could explain the sudden native achievement of such faultless
excellence. The next stimulus came directly from China, through the
studies there of the Japanese priests Kobo Daishi and Dengyo Daishi; on
his return to Japan in 806 Kobo Daishi gave himself to painting as well
as to sculpture, literature and piety, and some of the oldest
masterpieces are from his many-sided brush. Buddhism stimulated art in
Japan, as it had done in China; the Z en practice of meditation lent it-
self to brooding creativeness in color and form almost as readily as in
philoso- phy and poetry; and visions of Amida Buddha became as frequent
in Japa- nese art as Annunciations and Crucifixions on the walls and
canvases of the Renaissance. The priest Yeishin Sozu (d. 1017) was the
Fra Angelico and El Greco of this age, whose risings and descendings of
Amida made him the greatest religious painter in the history of Japan.
By this time, however, Kose no-Kanaoka (fl. ca. 950) had begun the
secularization of Japanese paint- ing; birds, flowers and animals began
to rival gods and saints on the scrolls.</p>
<p>But Kose’s brush still thought in Chinese terms, and moved along
Chinese lines. It was not till the suspension of intercourse with China
in the ninth century had given Japan the first of five centuries of
isolation that she began to paint her own scenery and subjects in her
own way. About 1150, under the patronage of imperial and aristocratic
circles at Kyoto, a national school of painting arose which protested
against imported motives and styles, and set itself to decorate the
luxurious homes of the capital with the flowers and landscapes of Japan.
The school had almost as many names as it had masters: Yamato-riu y or
Japanese Style; Waga-riu, again meaning Japanese Style; Kasuga , after
its reputed founder; and finally the Tosa School, after its prin- cipal
representative in the thirteenth century, Tosa Gon-no-kumi; thereafter
to the end of its history the name Tosa was borne by all the artists of
the line. They deserved their nationalist name, for there is nothing in
Chinese</p>
<p>904 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXart that corresponds to the ardor and dash, the variety and humor,
of the narrative scrolls of love and war which came from the brushes of
this group. Takayoshi, about 1010, painted in colors gorgeous
illustrations of the seduc- tive tale of Genji; Toba Sojo amused himself
by drawing lively satires of the priestly and other scoundrels of his
time, under the guise of monkeys and frogs; Fujiwara Takanobu, towards
the end of the twelfth century, finding his high lineage worthless in
terms of rice and sake, turned to the brush for a living, and drew great
portraits of Yoritomo and others, quite unlike any- thing yet done in
China; his son Fujiwara Nobuzane patiently painted the portraits of
thirty- six poets; and in the thirteenth century Kasuga’s son, Keion, or
someone else, drew those animated scrolls which are among the world’s
most brilliant achievements in the field of draughtsmanship.</p>
<p>Slowly these native sources of inspiration seemed to dry up into
conven- tional forms and styles, and Japanese art turned once more for
nourishment to the new schools of painting that had arisen in the China
of the Sung Renaissance. The impulse to imitation was for a time
uncontrolled; Japanese artists who had never seen the Middle Kingdom
spent their lives in painting Chinese characters and scenes. Cho Densu
painted sixteen Rakan ( Lohans , Arhats , Buddhist saints), now among
the treasures of the Freer Gallery in Washington; Shubun took the
precaution of being born and reared in China, so that, on coming to live
in Japan, he could paint Chinese landscapes from memory as well as from
imagination.</p>
<p>It was during this second Chinese mood of Japanese painting that the
greatest figure in all the pictorial art of Japan appeared. Sesshiu was
a Zen priest at Sokokuji, one of the several art schools established by
Yosh- imitsu, the Ashikaga Shogun. Even as a youth he astonished his
townsmen with his draughtsmanship; and legend, not knowing how to
express its awe, told how, when he was tied to a post for misbehavior,
he had drawn with his toes such realistic mice that they came to life
and bit through the cords that bound him . 75 Hungry to know the masters
of Ming China at first hand, he secured credentials from his religious
superiors as well as from the Shogun, and sailed across the sea. He was
disappointed to find that Chinese painting was in decay, but he consoled
himself with the varied life and culture of the great kingdom, and went
back to his own land filled and inspired with a thousand ideas. The
artists and nobles of China, says a pretty tale, accompanied him to the
vessel which was to take him back to Japan, and showered white paper
upon him with requests that he should paint a few strokes, if no more,
upon them and send them</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 905</p>
<p>back; hence, according to this story, his pen name Sesshiu, meaning
“Ship of Snow .” 78 Arrived in Japan, he seems to have been welcomed as
a prince, and to have been offered many emoluments by the Shogun
Yoshimasa; but (if we may believe what we read) he refused these favors,
and retired to his country parish in Choshu. Now he threw off, as if
each were a mo- ment’s trifle, one masterpiece after another, until
nearly every phase of Chinese scenery and life had taken lasting form
under his brush. Seldom had China, never had Japan, seen paintings so
various in scope, so vigorous in conception and execution, so decisive
in line. In his old age the artists of Japan made a path to his door and
honored him, even before his death, as a supreme artist. Today a picture
of Sesshiu is to a Japanese collector what a Leonardo is to a European;
and legend, which transforms in- tangible opinions into pretty tales,
tells how one possessor of a Sesshiu, finding himself caught in a
conflagration beyond possibility of escape, slashed open his body with
his sword, and plunged into his abdomen the priceless scroll — which was
later found unharmed within his half-consumed corpse . 77</p>
<p>The ascendancy of Chinese influence continued among the many artists
patronized by thfe feudal lords of the Ashikaga and Tokugawa Shogunates.
Each baronial court had its official painter, who was commissioned to
train hundreds of young artists who might be turned, at a moment’s
notice, to the decoration of a palace. The temples now were almost
ignored, for art was being secularized in proportion as wealth
increased. Towards the end of the fifteenth century Kano Masanobu
established at Kyoto, under Ashikaga patronage, a school of secular
painters known from his first name, and de- voted to upholding the
severely classical and Chinese traditions in Japanese art. His son, Kano
Motonobu, reached in this direction a mastery second only to that of
Sesshiu himself. A story told of him illustrates admirably the
concentration of mind and purpose that constitutes the greater part of
genius. Having been commissioned to paint a series of cranes, Motonobu
was dis- covered, evening after evening, walking and behaving like a
crane. It turned out that he imitated, each night, the crane that he
planned to paint the fol- lowing day. A man must go to bed with his
purpose in order to wake up to fame. Motonobu’s grandson, Kano Yeitoku,
though a scion of the Kano line, developed under the protection of
Hideyoshi an ornate style all the world away from the restrained
classicism of his progenitors. Tanyu transferred the seat of the school
from Kyoto to Yedo, took service under the Tokugawas, and helped to
decorate the mausoleum of Iyeyasu at Nikko. Gradually,</p>
<p>906 the story of civilization (chap. </p>
<p>XXXdespite these adaptations to the spirit of the times, the Kano
dynasty ex- hausted its impetus, and Japan turned to other masters for
fresh beginnings.</p>
<p>About 1660 a new group of painters arrived on the scene, named, from
its leaders, the Koyetsu-Korin School. In the natural oscillation of
philosophies and styles, the Chinese manners and subjects of Sesshiu and
Kano seemed now conservative and worn out; and the new artists turned to
domestic scenes and motives for their subject-matter and inspiration.
Koyetsu was a man of such diverse talents as bring to mind Carlyle’s jea
lous claim that he had never known any great man who could not have been
any sort of a great man; for he was distinguished as a calligrapher, a
painter, and a designer in metal, lac- quer and wood. Like William
Morris he inaugurated a revival of fine print- ing, and supervised a
village in which his craftsmen pursued their varied arts under his
direction. 78 His only rival for the first place among the painters of
the Tokugawa age was Korin, that astonishing master of trees and
flowers, who, his contemporaries tell us, could with one stroke of his
brush place a leaf of iris upon the silk and make it live. 79 No other
painter has been so purely and completely Japanese, or so typically
Japanese in the taste and delicacy of his work. 5 * 6</p>
<p>The last of the historic schools of Japanese painting in the
strictest sense was founded at Kyoto in the eighteenth century by
Maruyami Okyo. A man of the people, Okyo, stimulated by some knowledge
of European painting, resolved to abandon the now thinned-out idealism
and impressionism of the older style, and to attempt a realistic
description of simple scenes from every- day life. He became especially
fond of drawing animals, and kept many species of them about him as
objects of his brush. Having painted a wild boar, he showed his work to
hunters, and was disappointed to find that they thought his pictured
boar was dead. He tried again and again, until at last they admitted
that the boar might not be dead but merely asleep. 81 Since the
aristocracy at Kyoto was penniless, Okyo had to sell his pictures to the
middle classes; and this economic compulsion had much to do with turning
him to popular subjects, even to the painting of some Kyoto belles. The
older artists were horrified, but Okyo persisted in his unconventional
ways. Mori Sosen accepted Okyo’s naturalistic lead, turned and lived
with the animals in order to portray them faithfully, and became Japan’s
greatest</p>

<p>The “ Ukiyoye ” School — Its founders — Its masters — Hokusai</p>
<p>— Hiroshige</p>
<p>It is another jest of history that Japanese art should be most
widely</p>
<p>known and influential in the West through that one of all its forms
which is least honored in Japan. About the middle of the eighteenth
century the art of engraving, which had come to Japan in the luggage of
Buddhism half a millennium before, was turned to the illustration of
books and the life of the people. The old subjects and methods had lost
the tang of novelty and interest; men were surfeited with Buddhist
saints, Chinese philoso- phers, meditative animals and immaculate
flowers; the new classes that were slowly rising to prominence looked to
art for some reflection of their own affairs, and began to produce
artists willing to meet these demands. Since painting required leisure
and expense, and produced but one picture at a time, the new artists
adapted engraving to their purposes, cut their pictures into wood, and
made as many cheap prints from the blocks as their democratic purchasers
required. These prints were at first colored by hand. Then, about 1740,
three blocks were made: one uncolored, another partly colored rose-red,
the third colored here and there in green; and the paper was impressed
upon each block in turn. Finally, in 1764, Harunobu made the first
polychrome prints, and paved the way for those vivid sketches, by
Hokusai and Hiroshige, which proved so suggestive and stimulating to
culture-weary Europeans thirsting for novelty. So was born the Ukiyoye
School of “Pictures of the Passing World.”</p>
<p>Its painters were not the first who had taken the untitled man as the
object of their art. Iwasa Matabei, early in the seventeenth century,
had shocked the Samurai by depicting, on a six-panel screen, men, women
and children in the unrestrained attitudes of common life; in 1900 this
screen (the Hikone Biobu ) was chosen by the Japanese Government for
exhibi- tion in Paris, and was insured on its voyage for 30,000 yen
(5,000).“ About 1660 Hishikawa Moronobu, a designer of Kyoto dress
patterns, made the earliest block prints, first for the illustration of
books, then as broadsheets scattered among the people, almost like
picture postcards among ourselves today. About 1687 Toru Kujomoto,
designer of posters for the Osaka theatres, moved to Yedo, and taught
the Ukiyoye School (which belonged entirely to the capital) how
profitable it might be to</p>
<p>908 the story of civilization (chap. </p>
<p>XXXmake prints of the famous actors of the day. From the stage the
new ar- tists passed to the brothels of the Yoshiwara, and gave to many
a fragile beauty a taste of immortality. Bare breasts and gleaming limbs
entered with disarming coyness into the once religious and philosophical
sanctu- aries of Japanese painting.</p>
<p>The masters of the developed art appeared towards the middle of the
eighteenth century. Harunobu made prints of twelve or even fifteen
colors from as many blocks, and, remorseful over his early pictures for
the stage, painted with typical Japanese delicacy the graceful world of
happy</p>
<p>youth. Kiyonaga reached the first zenith of artistry in this school,
and wove color and line into the swaying and yet erect figures of
aristocratic women. Sharaku seems to have given only two years of his
life to design- ing prints; but in this short time he lifted himself to
the top of his tribe by his portraits of the Forty-seven Ronin, and his
savagely ironic pictures of the stage’s shooting “stars.” Utamaro, rich
in versatility and genius, mas - ter of line and design, etched the
whole range of life from insects to courtesans; he spent half his career
in the Yoshiwara, exhausted himself in pleasure and work, and earned a
year in jail (1804) by picturing</p>
<p>Hideyoshi with five concubines. 83 Wearied of normal people in normal
at- titudes, Utamaro portrayed his refined and complaisant ladies in
almost spiritual slenderness, with tilted heads, elongated and slanting
eyes, length- ened faces, and mysterious figures wrapped in flowing and
multitudinous robes. A degenerating taste exalted this style into a
bizarre mannerism, and was bringing the Ukiyoye School close to
corruption and decay, when its two most famous masters arose to give it
another half-century of life.</p>

<p>Like most of the Ukiyoye artists he was born of the artisan class,
the son of a mirror-maker. Apprenticed to the artist Shunso, he was
expelled for originality, and went back to his family to live in poverty
and hard- ship throughout his long life. Unable to live by painting, he
peddled food and almanacs. When his house burned down he merely composed
a hokka:</p>
<p>It has burned down;</p>
<p>How serene the flowers in their falling!®</p>
<p>When, at the age of eighty-nine, he was discovered by death, he sur-
rendered reluctantly, saying: “If the gods had given me only ten years
more I could have become a really great painter.” 88</p>
<p>He left behind him five hundred volumes of thirty thousand drawings.
Intoxicated with the unconscious artistry of natural forms, he pictured
in loving and varied repetition mountains, rocks, rivers, bridges,
waterfalls and the sea. Having issued a book of “Thirty - six Views of
Fuji,” he went back, like the fascinated priest of Buddhist legend,* to
sit at the foot of the sacred mount again, and draw “One Hundred Views
of Fuji.” In a series named “The Imagery of the Poets” he returned to
the loftier sub - jects of Japanese art, and showed, among others, the
great Li Po beside the chasm and cascade of Lu. In 1812 he issued the
first of fifteen volumes called Mangwa — a. series of realistic drawings
of the homeliest details of common life, piquant with humor and
scandalous with burlesque. These he flung off without care or effort, a
dozen a day, until he had illustrated every nook and cranny of plebeian
Japan. Never had the nation seen such fertility, such swift and
penetrating conception, such reckless vitality of execution. As American
critics looked down upon Whitman, so Japa- nese critics and art circles
looked down upon Hokusai, seeing only the turbulence of his brush and
the occasional vulgarity of his mind. But</p>

significant scenes which he met on his way. When at last his trip was
finished, he gathered his impressions together in his most famous work —
“The Fifty - three Stations of the Tokaido” (1834). He liked to picture
rain and the night in all their mystic forms, and the only man who
surpassed him in this — Whistler — modeled his nocturnes upon
Hiroshige’s. 88 He too loved Fuji, and made “Thirty - six Views” of the
mountain; but also he loved his native Tokyo, and made “One Hundred
Views of Yedo” shortly before he died. He lived less years than Hokusai,
but yielded up the torch with more content:</p>

<li>JAPANESE ART AND CIVILIZATION</li>
</ol>
<p>A retrospect — Contrasts — An estimate — The doom of the old
Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese print was almost the last phase of that subtle and
delicate civilization which crumbled under the impact of Occidental
industry, just as the cynical pessimism of the Western mind today may be
the final aspect of a civilization doomed to die under the heel of
Oriental industry. Because that medieval Japan which survived till 1853
was harmless to us,</p>
<p>An excellent collection of Hiroshige’s prints may be seen in the
Boston Museum.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 91I</p>
<p>we can appreciate its beauty patronizingly; and it will be hard to
find in a Japan of competing factories and threatening guns the charm
that lures us in the selected loveliness of the past. We know, in our
prosaic moments, that there was much cruelty in that old Japan, that
peasants were poor and workers were oppressed, that women were slaves
there, and might in hard times be sold into promiscuity, that life was
cheap, and that in the end there was no law for the common man but the
sword of the Samurai. But in Europe too men were cruel and women were a
subject class, peasants were poor and workers were oppressed, life was
hard and thought was dangerous, and in the end there was no law but the
will of the lord or the king.</p>
<p>And as we can feel some affection for that old Europe because, in the
midst of poverty, exploitation and bigotry, men built cathedrals in
which every stone was carved in beauty, or martyred themselves to earn
for their successors the right to think, or fought for justice until
they created those civil liberties which are the most precious and
precarious portion of our inheritance, so behind the bluster of the
Samurai we honor the bravery that still gives to Japan a power above its
numbers and its wealth; behind the lazy monks we sense the poetry of
Buddhism, and acknowl- edge its endless incentives to poetry and art;
behind the sharp blow of cruelty, and the seeming rudeness of the strong
to the weak, we recognize the courtliest manners, the most pleasant
ceremonies, and an unrivaled de- votion to nature’s beauty in all her
forms. Behind the enslavement of women we see their beauty, their
tenderness, and their incomparable grace; and amid the despotism of the
family we hear the happiness of children playing in the garden of the
East.</p>
<p>We are not much moved today by the restrained brevity and untrans-
latable suggestiveness of Japanese poetry; and yet it was this poetry,
as well as the Chinese, that suggested the “free verse” and “imagism” of
our time. There is scant originality in Japan’s philosophers, and in her
his - torians a dearth of the high impartiality that we expect of those
whose books are not an annex to their country’s armed or diplomatic
force. But these were minor things in the life of Japan; she gave
herself wisely to the creation of beauty rather than to the pursuit of
truth. The soil she lived on was too treacherous to encourage sublime
architecture, and yet the houses she built “are, from the esthetic point
of view , the most perfect ever designed.”“ No country in modern times
has rivaled her in the grace</p>
<p>912 _ THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP.</p>
<p>XXXfans and parasols, of cups and toys, of inro and netsuke , the
splendor of lacquer and the exquisite carving of wood. No other modem
people has quite equaled the Japanese in restraint and delicacy of
decoration, or in widespread refinement and sureness of taste. It is
true that Japanese porcelain is less highly valued, even by the
Japanese, than that of Sung and Ming; but if only the Chinese product
surpasses it, the work of the Japanese potter still ranks above that of
the modem European. And though Japanese painting lacks the strength and
depth of Chinese, and Japanese prints are mere poster art at their
worst, and at their best the transient redemption of hurried
trivialities with a national perfection of grace and line, nevertheless
it was Japanese rather than Chinese painting, and Japanese prints rather
than Japanese water-colors, that revolutionized pictorial art in the
nineteenth century, and gave the stimulus to a hundred experiments in
fresh creative forms. These prints, sweeping into Europe in the wake of
reopened trade after i860, profoundly affected Monet, Manet, Degas and
Whistler; they put an end to the “brown sauce” that</p>
<p>We hope that this is not quite true; but it was unconsciously true
for the old Japan. She died four years after Hokusai. In the comfort and
peace of her isolation she had forgotten that a nation must keep abreast
of the world if it does not wish to be enslaved. While Japan carved her
inro and flourished her fans, Europe was establishing a science that was
almost entirely unknown to the East; and that science, built up year by
year in laboratories a pparently far removed from the stream of the
world’s affairs, at last gave Europe the mechanized industries that
enabled her to make the goods of life more cheaply — however less
beautifully — than Asia’s skilful artisans could turn them out by hand.
Sooner or later those cheaper goods would win the markets of Asia,
ruining the economic and changing the political life of countries
pleasantly becalmed in the handicraft stage. Worse than that, science
made explosives, battleships and guns that could kill a little more
completely than the sword of the most heroic Samurai ;</p>
<p>CHAP. XXX) THE MIND AND ART OF OLD JAPAN 913</p>
<p>of what use was the bravery of a knight against the dastardly
anonymity of a shell?</p>
<p>There is no more amazing or portentous phenomenon in modem his- tory
than the way in which sleeping Japan, roughly awakened by the can- non
of the West, leaped to the lesson, bettered the instruction, accepted
science, industry and war, defeated all her competitors either in battle
or in trade, and became, within two generations, the most aggressive
nation in the contemporary world.</p>
