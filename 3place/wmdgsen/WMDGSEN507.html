<p>The Church and Reform</p>
<p>i 5 i 7- 6 5</p>
<p>I. ITALIAN PROTESTANT REFORMERS</p>
<p>I N climatically pagan Italy, constitutionally polytheistic, favoring
a genial and artistic faith, populated with undying saints whose awesome
or be- loved effigies moved annually through the streets, and enriched
by the gold that came to the Church from a dozen subject lands, one
should not have expected to find men and women dedicated, sometimes at
mortal risk, to the replacement of that picturesque and hallowed faith
by a somber creed whose political support was the reluctance of northern
nations to fatten Italy with the proceeds of their piety. Yet everywhere
in Italy there were people who felt, even more keenly and intimately
than the Germans, the Swiss, or the English, the abuses that were
demoralizing the Church. And in Italy, more than anywhere else, the
educated classes, though already enjoying some freedom of teaching and
thought, were demanding the liberation of the intellect from even
outward allegiance to the myths that so charmed and disciplined the
populace.</p>
<p>Some of Luther’s writ ings appeared in the bookstalls of Milan in 1 5
19, in Venice in 1520. In St. Mark’s itself a friar dared to preach the
doctrines of Luther. Cardinal Caraffa reported to Pope Clement VII
(1532) that religion was at a low ebb in Venice, that very few Venetians
observed the fasts or went to confession, and that heretical literature
was popular there. Clement himself (1530) described the Lutheran heresy
as widely spread among both clergy and laity in Italy; and in 1535 the
German reformers claimed 30,000 adherents in the homeland of the Church.
1</p>
<p>The highest lady in Ferrara was a fervent Protestant. Renee, daughter
of Louis XII, had imbibed the new ideas partly from Marguerite of
Navarre, partly from her own governess, Mme. Soubise. The Princess
brought this lady with her when she married (1528) Ercole d’Este, who
became (1534) the second duke of that name to rule Ferrara. Calvin
visited her there ( 1536), and intensified her Protestant convictions.
Clement Marot came to her, and, later, Hubert Languet, the Huguenot
publicist. Ercole accepted them all in polite Renaissance fashion until
one of them shouted Idolatria! during the Adoration of the Cross on Holy
Saturday ( 1 536) ; then he let the Inquisition</p>
<p>891</p>
<p>892 the reformation (chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>question them. Calvin and Marot fled; the others appear to have saved
them- selves by affirming their orthodoxy. But after 1540 Renee gathered
a new Protestant entourage, and ceased attendance at Catholic worship.
Ercole soothed the Pope by exiling her to the ducal villa at Consandolo
on the Po; but there too she surrounded herself with Protestants, and
brought up her daughters in the Reformed faith. Ercole, fearing that
Protestant daughters would be worthless pawns in the game of political
marriages, removed them to a convent. Finally he allowed the Inquisition
to indict Renee and twenty- four of her household. She was convicted of
heresy, and was sentenced to life imprisonment (1554). She recanted,
received the Eucharist, and was restored to religious and political
grace; 2 but her real opinions were silently expressed by the melancholy
solitude of her remaining years. After Ercole’s death (1559) she
returned to France, where she made her home at Montargis a refuge for
Huguenots.</p>
<p>Modena, also under Ercole, had a lively Protestant moment. Its A
ccademia of scientists and philosophers allowed great freedom in
discussions, and some of its members, including Vesalius’s pupil and
successor Gabriele Fal - lopio, were suspected of heresy. Paolo Ricci,
an ex-friar, preached openly against the papacy; Lutheran ideas were
debated in the shops, the squares, the churches. Ricci and others were
arrested. Cardinal Sadoleto protected the Academicians, claiming that
they were loyal to the Church, and that they should, as scholars, enjoy
freedom of inquiry; 3 Paul III contented him- self with their signatures
to a profession of faith, but Ercole disbanded the Academy (1546), and
one unrepentant Lutheran was executed at Ferrara (1550). In 1568, as the
Catholic reaction stiffened, thirteen men and one woman were burned for
heresy at Modena.</p>
<p>At Lucca, Pietro Martire Vermigli, Prior of the Austin Canons,
organized a learned academy, brought exceptional teachers to it,
encouraged freedom of discussion, and told his large congregation that
it might look upon the Eucharist as not a miraculous transformation but
a pious remembrance of the Passion of Christ; this out-Luthered Luther.
Summoned for questioning by the chapter of his order at Genoa, he fled
from Italy, denounced the errors and abuses of Catholicism, and accepted
a professorship of divinity at Oxford ( 1 548) . He took a disputed part
in formulating the Book of Com- mon Prayer (1552), left England when
Catholicism returned to power, and died as professor of Hebrew at Zurich
in 1562. Eighteen canons of his priory at Lucca followed him in
abandoning their order and Italy.</p>
<p>Vermigli, Bishop Sorano of Bergamo, and many others had been turned
to the new ideas by Juan de Valdes. He and his brother Alfonso, of high
Castilian lineage, were perhaps the most talented twins in history.
Alfonso, a devotee of Erasmus, became Latin secretary to Charles V, and
wrote a Dialogo de Lactancio (1529) in which he defended the Sack of
Rome, and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVin) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 893</p>
<p>contended that Luther would never have left the Church if, instead of
con- demning him, she had reformed the abuses that he had justly
denounced. Juan contributed to the same volume a Dialogo de Mer curio y
Caron, whose heresies were political: the rich should be made to earn
their living; the poor have a right to share in the income of the rich;
the wealth of a prince belongs to the people, and should not be wasted
in imperialistic or religious wars. 4 Clement VII naturally preferred
Juan, and made him a papal chamberlain at thirty. Juan, however, moved
to Naples, where he devoted himself to writing and teaching. He remained
loyal to the Church, but favored the Lutheran doctrine of justification
by faith, and rated a devout mysticism above any external ritual of
piety. Distinguished men and women gathered around him and accepted his
lead: Vermigli, Ochino, Marcantonio Flaminio the poet, Pietro
Carnesecchi, Vittoria Colonna, Costanza d’Avalos, Duchess of Amalfi,
Isabella Manriquez, sister of the Spanish grand inquisitor, and Giulia
Gonzaga, whose beauty we have already acknowledged. After Juan Valdes’s
death (1541) his pupils scattered through Europe. Some, like Vit - toria
Colonna, stayed in the Church; some developed his teachings into open
heresy. Three minor pupils were beheaded and burned at Naples in 1 564;
Carnesecchi was beheaded and burned at Rome in 1 567. Giulia Gonzaga was
saved by the death of the merciless Paul IV; she entered a convent
(1566), and with her the Neapolitan party of reform came to an end.</p>
<p>Bernardino Ochino went through all the stages of religious
development. Born near the birthplace of St. Catherine in Siena, he
rivaled her piety. He joined the Franciscans, but finding their
discipline too lax for his mood, he transferred to the severer order of
the Capuchins. They marveled at his ascetic self-denial, his passionate
mortification of his flesh; and when they made him their vicar-general
they felt that they had chosen a saint. His ser- mons — in Siena,
Florence, Venice, Naples, Rome — resounded through Italy; nothing like
them in fervor or eloquence had been heard there since Savo- narola a
century before. Charles V went to hear him; Vittoria Colonna was deeply
moved by him; Pietro Aretino, who had sampled almost every sin, was
stirred to passing piety by hearing him. No church was large enough to
hold his listeners. No one dreamed that this man would die a
heretic.</p>
<p>But at Naples he met Valdes, and through him became acquainted with
the works of Luther and Calvin. The doctrine of justification suited his
spirit; he began to hint at it in his sermons. In 1542 he was cited
before the papal nuncio at Venice, and was forbidden to preach. Shortly
afterward Paul III invited him to Rome to discuss the religious views of
some Capu- chins. Ochino may have trusted the enlightened Pope, but he
feared the long arm of the Inquisition, and Cardinal Contarini warned
him of danger. Sud- denly this saint and idol of Italy, meeting Peter
Vermigli in Florence, de- cided, like him, to cross the Alps into
Protestant terrain. A brother of Vittoria</p>
<p>894 THE reformation (chap. xxxvm</p>
<p>Colonna gave him a horse; at Ferrara Renee gave him clothing. He
proceeded through the Grisons to Zurich, thence to Geneva. He applauded
the puritan discipline that Calvin was establishing there, but, his
German being better than his French, he moved on to Basel to Strasbourg
to Augsburg, trying to earn a living by tongue or pen. In 1547 Charles
V, having overwhelmed the Protestants at Miihlberg, entered Augsburg as
master of Germany. He learned that the Capuchin whom he had heard in
Naples was living there as a married man; he ordered the magistrates to
arrest him; they connived at Ochino’s escape. He fled to Zurich and
Basel, and then, when he seemed at the end of his food, he received a
call from Archbishop Cranmer to come to England. There, as a pensioned
prebendary at Canterbury, he labored for six years (1547- 53); he wrote
a book that strongly influenced Milton’s Paradise Lost ; but when Mary
Tudor came to the throne he hurried back to Switzerland.</p>
<p>He secured appointment as pastor of a congregation in Zurich, but his
Unitarian views offended it, and he was dismissed when he published a
dia- logue in which a defender of polygamy seemed to have the better of
the argument against a monogamist. Though it was December (1563), he was
ordered to leave the city within three weeks. Basel refused to let him
stay there; he was allowed a brief sojourn in Nuremberg; soon he set out
with his family for Poland, then by comparison a haven for off-color
thinkers. He preached at Cracow for a while, but was expelled when the
king banished all non-Catholic foreigners (1564). On the way from Poland
to Moravia three of his four children succumbed to pestilence. He
survived them two months, dying at Schackau in December 1564. Almost his
last words were: “I wish to be neither a Bullingerite nor a Calvinist
nor a papist, but simply a Christian.” B Nothing could have been more
dangerous.</p>
<p>It was of course impossible that Italy should go Protestant. The
common people there, though anticlerical, were religious even when they
did not go to church. They loved the time-hallowed ceremonies, the
helping or con- soling saints, the seldom-questioned creed that lifted
their lives from the poverty of their homes to the sublimity of the
greatest drama ever conceived — the redemption of fallen man by the
death of his God. The political domi- nation of Italy by an intensely
religious Spain conspired to keep both penin- sulas Catholic. The wealth
of the papacy was an Italian heirloom and vested interest; any Italian
who proposed to end that tribute-receiving organization seemed to most
Italians to be verging on lunacy. The upper classes quarreled with the
papacy as a political power over Central Italy, but they cherished
Catholicism as a vital aid to social order and peaceful government. They
realized that the glory of Italian art had been bound up with the Church
through the inspiration of her legends and the support of her gold.
Catholi- cism itself had become an art; its sensuous elements had
submerged the ascetic</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIII ) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 895</p>
<p>and the theological; stained glass, incense, music, architecture,
sculpture, painting, even drama — these were all in the Church and of
her, and in their marvelous ensemble they seemed inseparable from her.
The artists and the scholars of Italy did not have to be converted from
Catholicism, for they had converted Catholicism to scholarship and art.
Hundreds, thousands of scholars and artists were supported by bishops,
cardinals, and popes; many humanists, some polite skeptics, had risen to
high position in the Church. Italy loved attainable beauty too much to
despoil itself over unattainable truth. And had those fanatical Teutons,
or that sour popelet in Geneva, 01 that ruthless ogre on the throne of
England, found the truth? What depress- ing nonsense those Reformers
were shouting — just when the intellectual classes in Italy had quite
forgotten hell and damnation! One could under- stand a quiet and private
rejection of Christian theology in favor of a vague and genial deism,
but to replace the mystery of transubstantiation with the horror of
predestination seemed a passage from a heartening symbolism to a
suicidal absurdity. Just now, when the Church had spread her forgiving
wings over the pagan proclivities of the Italian people, Calvin was
calling upon the world to fetter itself in a puritanism that threatened
to exile all gladness and spontaneity from life. And how could Italian
joy and art con- tinue if those barbarous Teutons and Englishmen should
cease to send or bring their coins into Italy?</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ITALIAN CATHOLIC REFORMERS</li>
</ol>
<p>Consequently the Italian argument was all for reform within the
Church. And indeed, loyal churchmen had for centuries admitted —
proclaimed — the need for ecclesiastical reform. The outbreak and
progress of the Reforma- tion gave new urgency to the need and the
demand. “A vast torrent of abuse in hundreds and thousands of pamphlets
and caricatures poured down upon the clergy.” 8 The Sack of Rome touched
the conscience and income of terrified cardinals and populace; a hundred
priests pronounced the calamity a warning from God. Bishop Stafileo,
preaching before the Rota (a judiciary branch of the Curia) in 1528,
explained, almost in Protestant terms, why God had struck the capital of
Christendom: “Because all flesh has become corrupt; we are citizens not
of the holy city of Rome, but of Babylon, the city of corruption.” 7 As
Luther had said.</p>
<p>At an uncertain date shortly before 1517 Giovanni Pietro Caraffa and
Count Gaetano da Thiene founded at Rome the Oratory of the Divine Love —
Oratorio del Divino Amore — foi prayer and self-reform. Half a hundred
prominent men joined it, including Iacopo Sadoleto, Gainmatteo Giberti,
Giuliano Dati. In 1524 Gaetano organized an order of clerks regular —
i.e..</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>896</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>secular priests subjecting themselves to monastic vows. After the
Sack of Rome the Oratory was disbanded, and Caraffa and others entered
the new order, which took the name of Theatines from Caraffa’s episcopal
see of Theate or Chieti. Men of high distinction were admitted — Pietro
Bembo, Marcantonio Flaminio, Luigi Priuli, Gasparo Contarini, Reginald
Pole. . . . All pledged themselves to poverty, care of the sick, and a
strict moral life, “to make up,” said their first historian, “what is
wanting in the clergy, who are corrupted by vice and ignorance to the
ruin of the people.” 8 The mem - bers spread through Italy, and their
example shared with papal and conciliar reforms, with Capuchin and
Jesuit example, in restoring the moral fiber of the Catholic clergy and
the popes. Caraffa led the way by resigning all his benefices, and
distributing his substantial wealth among the poor.</p>
<p>Giberti was in his person and career an image of the Catholic reform.
At the court of Leo X he was a leading humanist; under Clement VII he
was datary or chief secretary to the Curia. Shaken by the catastrophe of
1527, he retired to his bishopric at Verona, and lived like an ascetic
monk while administering his diocese. He was alarmed by the decay of
religion there — the churches dilapidated, preaching rare, priests
ignorant of the Latin in which they said Mass, and the people rarely
using the confessional. By exam- ple, precept, and firm discipline, he
reformed his clergy; soon, says a Catholic historian, “the dungeons were
full of concubinary priests.” 9 Giberti re- established (1531) the
Confraternity della Caritd that had been founded by Cardinal Giuliano
de’ Medici in 1519; he built orphanages, and opened people’s banks to
rescue borrowers from usurers. Similar reforms were car - ried out by
Cardi nal Ercole Gonzaga (son of Isabella d’Este) at Mantua, by Marco
Vida at Alba, by Fabio Vigili at Spoleto, and many other bishops who
knew that the Church must reform or die.</p>
<p>Several of the heroes of the orthodox reform were later canonized by
the Church they had helped to save. St. Philip Neri, a young Florentine
noble, founded at Rome (c. 1540) a peculiar Trinity de ’ Pellegrini:
twelve laymen</p>
<p>CHAP, xxxviii) the church and reform 897</p>
<p>the popular awe for a man who thought that reform was the best answer
to the Reformation. Within his lifetime and his archdiocese, decency was
made fashionable among clergy and laity alike. His influence was felt
throughout Italy, and shared in transforming the cardinals from worldly
aristocrats into devoted priests.</p>
<p>Stimulated by such men, the popes began to give determined attention
to ecclesiastical reform. Early in the pontificate of Paul III the
renowned jurist Giovan Battista Caccia presented to him a treatise on
the reformation of the Church. “I see,” said the preamble, “that our
Holy Mother the Church . . . has been so changed that she seems to have
no tokens of her evangelical character; and no trace can be found in her
of humility, temperance, con- tinence, and Apostolic strength.” 10 Paul
showed his own mood by accepting the dedication of this work. On
November 20, 1534, he appointed Cardinals Piccolomini, Sanseverino, and
Cesi to draw up a program of moral renova- tion for the Church; and on
January 15, 1535, he ordered strict enforcement of Leo X’s reform bulls
of 1513. Enmeshed in papal and Imperia l politics, endangered by the
advance of the Turks, and unwilling, in these crises, to disturb the
structure or functioning of the Curia by radical changes, Paul deferred
active reform; but the men whom he raised to the cardinalate were almost
all known for integrity and devotion. In July 1536, he invited to a
reform conference at Rome Contarini, Caraffa, Sadoleto, Cortese,
Aleander, Pole, Tommaso Badia, and Bishop Federigo Fregose of Gubbio,
all com- mitted to reform, and bade them put into writing the abuses in
the Church, and the means they would recommend to mitigate them.
Sadoleto opened the conference by boldly stating that the popes
themselves, by their sins, crimes, and financial greed, had been the
prime source of ecclesiastical de- terioration. 11 The conference met
almost daily for three months. Its leading spirit, Gasparo Contarini,
was the finest figure in the Counter Reformation. Bom in V enice ( 1 48
3 ) of aristocratic lineage, and educated in liberal Padua, he soon rose
to high position in the Venetian government. He was sent as ambassador
to Charles V in Germany, accompanied him to England and Spain, and then
served the Senate as its representative at the papal court ( 1 527 —
3°). Retiring from politics, he devoted himself to study, and made his
home a meeting place of the best statesmen, churchmen, philosophers, and
humanists in Venice. Though a layman, he pondered ecclesiastical re-
form, and collaborated actively with Caraffa, Giberti, Cortese, and
Pole. All Italy recognized him as a rare combination of intellect and
character. In 1535, without any solicitation on his part, he was made a
cardinal by Paul III, whom he had never met. 12</p>
<p>In March 1537, the commission presented to the Pope its unanimous
Consi lium dilectorum cardinalium de emendanda Ecclesia. This “Counsel
of the Appointed Cardinals on Reforming the Church” exposed with aston
-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>898</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>ishing freedom the abuses in the papal government, and boldly
ascribed them chiefly to “reckless exaggeration of the papal authority
by unscrupulous canonists.” Some popes, the report held, “had assumed
the right to sell eccle - siastical offices, and this simony had spread
venality and corruption so widely through the Church that now the great
organization was on the verge of destruction through men’s lack of trust
in its integrity. The report urged strict supervision of all Curial
activities, a check on dispensations, an end to money payments for them,
a higher standard in all appointments and in eligibility to the
cardinalate and the priesthood, and a prohibition of plural or absentee
holding of benefices. “Throughout the whole world,” the report</p>
<p>We have satisfied our consciences, not without the greatest hope</p>
<p>of seeing, under your pontificate, the Church of God restored. . .
.</p>
<p>You have taken the name of Paul. We hope that you will imitate
his</p>
<p>charity. He was chosen as an instrument to carry Christ’s name to the
heathen; you, we hope, have been chosen to revive in our hearts and
deeds that name long since forgotten among the heathen and by us the
clergy; to heal our sickness, to unite Christ’s sheep again in one</p>
<p>fold, and to avert from our heads the wrath and already threatening
vengeance of God. 18</p>
<p>Paul took in good spirit this aureum consilium, this “golden
counsel,” as many called it, and sent a copy to every cardinal. Luther
translated it into German, and published it as a full justification of
his break with Rome; however, he judged the authors of the document to
be “liars . . . desperate</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 899</p>
<p>thousand objections were raised. Morone warned the Pope that haste in
executing this order might drive some of the bishops, returning to now
pre- dominantly Protestant areas, to join the Lutherans. This actually
occurred in several cases. Soon Paul lost himself in Imperial politics,
and left reform to his successors.</p>
<p>The movement for internal reform triumphed when its leader, Caraffa,
became Paul IV (1555). Monks absent from their monasteries without offi-
cial sanction and clear necessity were commanded to return at once. On
the night of August 22, 1558, the Pope ordered all the gates of Rome
closed, and all vagrant monks arrested; similar procedures were followed
throughout the Papal States, and some offenders were sent to the
galleys. Monasteries were no longer to be assigned in comrnendccm to
support absentee officials with their revenues. Bishops and abbots not
actually serving the Curia in a fixed office were required to return to
their posts or forfeit their income. The holding of plural benefices was
prohibited. All departments of the Curia were bidden to reduce their
fees, and to eliminate any suspicion of simony in appointments to
clerical positions. Having so diminished his own income, Paul made a
further sacrifice by ending the payment of a fee for confirmation to
archiepiscopal dignity. Severe papal edicts were issued against usurers,
actors, and prostitutes; procurers were to be put to death. Daniele da V
olterra was instructed to cover sartorially the more glaring anatomical
features of Michelangelo’s hast Judgment; and it must be admitted that
that gloomy shambles of flesh damned or saved had hardly found a fitting
place over the altar of the popes. Rome now assumed an uncongenial air
of external piety and morality. In Italy — less visibly beyond it — the
Church had reformed her clergy and her morals, while leaving her
doctrines proudly intact. The re- form had been long delayed, but when
it came it was sincere and magnificent.</p>

<li>ST. TERESA AND MONASTIC REFORM</li>
</ol>
<p>A moral regeneration was simultaneously taking place in the monastic
orders. We may imagine their reputation from a remark of the pious and
orthodox Michelangelo, who, when he heard that Sebastian del Piombo was
to paint the figure of a monk in the chapel of San Pietro in Montorio,
advised against it, saying that as the monks had spoiled the world,
which is so large, it would not be surprising if one should spoil the
chapel, which was so small. 16 Gregorio Cortese set himself patiently to
reform the Benedictines at Padua; Girolamo Seripando the Austin Canons;
Egidio Canisio the Augustinian Eremites; Paolo Giustiniani the
Camaldolites.</p>
<p>New monastic orders stressed reform. Antonio Maria Laccaria founded
at Milan (1533) the Clerks Regular of St. Paul, a community of
priests</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>pledged to monastic poverty; they met originally in the church of
St. Bar- nabas, whence they came to be called Bamabites. In 1535
St. Angela organ- ized the Ursuline nuns for the education of girls and
the care of the sick or the poor; and in 1 540 St. John of God
established in Granada the Brothers of Mercy for hospital ministrations.
In 1523 Matteo de’ Bassi, in fervent emulation of St. Francis of Assisi,
determined to observe to the letter the final rule that their founder
had left to the Franciscans. Other friars joined him, and by 1525 their
number encouraged Matteo to ask papal sanction of a new branch of the
Franciscans dedicated to the strictest rule. The provincial of his order
had him imprisoned for disobedience, but Matteo was soon freed, and in
1528 Clement VII confirmed the new order of Capuchins — so named because
the friars wore the same kind of cappuccio or cowl that Francis had
worn. They dressed in the coarsest cloth, lived on bread, vege- tables,
fruit, and water, kept rigorous fasts, dwelt in narrow cells in poor
cottages, never journeyed except on foot, and went barefoot throughout
the year. They distinguished themselves by their selfless care of the
infected in the plague of 1528-29. Their devotion was a factor in
keeping Vittoria Colonna and other incipient Protestants loyal to a
Church that could still produce such ardent Christians.</p>
<p>The most interesting figure in this epoch of monastic reform was a
frail and masterful abbess of Spain. Teresa de Cepeda was the daughter
of a Castilian knight of Avila, a man proud of his puritan rectitude and
his loyalty to the Church; each night he read to his family from the
lives of the saints. 17 The mother, a chronic invalid, brightened her
weary days with chivalric romances, and shared, from her sickbed, the
adventures of Amadis of Gaul. Teresa’s childhood imagination vacillated
betwe en romantic love and saintly martyrdom. At ten she vowed to become
a nun. But, four years later, she blossomed suddenly into a beautiful
young woman, bounding with the joy of life, and forgetting the garb of
the cloister in the colorful dresses that doubled her charms. Admirers
came; she fell tremulously in love with one of them, and was invited to
a tryst. At the crucial moment she took fright, and confessed the dire
plot to her father. As the mother was now dead, Don Alonzo de Cepeda
placed the impressionable girl with the Augustinian nuns at Avila.</p>
<p>Teresa resented the solemn life and discipline of the convent. She
refused to take the vows of a nun, but looked forward impatiently to her
sixteenth birthday, when she would be permitted to leave. But as this
goal approached she fell dangerously ill, and almost died. She
recovered, but her youthful joyousness was gone. Apparently she had
developed a form of hystero-epi- lepsy, perhaps from suppressed
rebellion against constraints alien to her instincts. Attacks recurred,
leaving her exhausted. Her father removed her from the convent, and sent
her to five with her half-sister in the country.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIIl) the church and reform 901</p>
<p>On the way an uncle gave her a volume of St. Jerome. Those vivid
letters described the terrors of hell, and the flirtations of the sexes
as the crowded avenue to eternal damnation. Teresa read anxiously. After
another severe attack she abandoned all thought of worldly happiness,
and resolved to ful- fill her childhood vow. She returned to Avila, and
entered the Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation (1534).</p>
<p>For a while she was happy in the soothing routine of Masses, prayers,
and cleansing confessions; and when she took the sacrament she felt the
bread as veritably Christ on her tongue and in her blood. But she was
disturbed by the lax discipline of the convent. The nuns had not cells
but comfortable rooms; they ate well despite weekly fasts; they adorned
their persons with necklaces, bracelets, and rings; they received
visitors in the parlor, and en- joyed extended vacations outside the
convent walls. Teresa felt that these conditions did not protect her
sufficiently from the temptations and imagi- nations of the flesh.
Perhaps because of these, and her growing discontent, her attacks became
more frequent and painful. Again her father sent her to her sister, and
again, en route, her uncle gave her a religious book, TheT hira
Abecedarium of Francisco de Osuna. It was an A B C of mystical prayer,
praye r without words; for, said the author, “only those who approach
God in silence can be heard and will be given an answer.” 18 In her
rural retreat</p>
<p>An herb doctor tried to cure her, but his concoctions almost killed
her. When she returned to the cloister at Avila (1537) she was near
death, and longed for it. The most violent of her seizures came now; she
fell into a coma that was mistaken for death; for two days she lay cold
and motionless, apparently without breath; the nuns dug a grave for her.
She recovered, but remained so weak that she could digest no solid food,
and could bear no touch. For eight months she lay in the convent
infirmary in almost total paralysis. Her condition slowly improved to
partial paralysis, but “the times when I was not harassed by severe
pains were rare indeed.” 19 She renounced medical treatments, and
resolved to rely entirely on prayer. For three years she suffered and
prayed. Then suddenly, one morning in 1 540, the bedrid- den, seemingly
incurable invalid awoke to find her limbs no longer paralyzed. She rose
and walked. Day by day she joined more actively in the conventual
regimen. Her recovery was acclaimed as a miracle, and she believed it
so. Perhaps prayer had soothed a nervous system overwrought with
conflicting desires, a sense of sin, and a fear of hell; and the quieted
nerves, and the ab- sence of doctors, gave her body unwonted peace.</p>
<p>The Incarnation Convent became famous as the scene of a miraculous
cure. People came from surrounding towns to see the nun whom God had
healed; they left money and gifts for the holy house; the mother
superior</p>
<p>THEREFOR MAT I ON</p>
<p>902</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>encouraged these visits, and bade Teresa show herself when visitors
came. Teresa was troubled to find that she took pleasure in these
visits, this fame, and the presence of handsome men. A sense of sin
returned to her. One day (1542), as she conversed in the parlor with a
man who especially attracted her, she thought she saw Christ standing
beside the visitor. She fell into a trance, and had to be carried to her
cell in a cot.</p>
<p>Through the next sixteen years she continued to have such visions.
They became to her more real than life. In 1558, while absorbed in
prayer, she felt her soul moving out of her body and mounting to heaven,
and there seeing and hearing Christ. These visions no longer exhausted,
they refreshed her. She wrote:</p>
<p>Often, infirm and wrought upon with dreadful pains before the</p>
<p>ecstasy, the soul emerges from it full of health and admirably
disposed for action … as if God had willed that the body itself,
already</p>
<p>obedient to the soul’s desires, should share in the soul’s
happiness.</p>
<p>, . . The soul after such a favor is animated with a degree of
courage so great that if at that moment its body should be torn to
pieces for the cause of God, it would feel nothing but the liveliest
comfort . 20</p>
<p>On another occasion she thought an “exceedingly beautiful angel”
thrust “a long dart of gold,” tipped with fire, “through my heart
several times, so that</p>
<p>So real was the pain that I was forced to moan aloud, yet it was
so</p>
<p>surpassingly sweet that I would not wish to be delivered from it. No
delight of life can give more content. As the angel withdrew the dart,
he left me all burning with a great love of God.* 21</p>
<p>This and other passages in the writings of St. Teresa lend themselves
readily to psychoanalytic interpretations, but no one can doubt the high
sincerity of the saint. Like Ignatius, she was convinced that she saw
God, and that the most recondite problems were made clear to her in
these visions.</p>
<p>One day, being in orison, it was granted me to perceive in one</p>
<p>instant how all things are seen and contained in God. … It is one
of</p>
<p>the most signal of all graces that the Lord has granted me. . . .
Our</p>
<p>Lord has made me comprehend in what way it is that one God can</p>
<p>be in three persons. He made me see it so clearly that I remained as
extremely surprised as I was comforted. . . . And now, when I think</p>
<p>of the Holy Trinity … I experience an unspeakable happiness . 22</p>
<p>Teresa’s sister nuns interpreted her visions as delusions and morbid
fits. 28 Her confessors inclined to the same view, and told her sternly,
“The Devil</p>

<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 903</p>
<p>has deceived your senses.” The townspeople thought her possessed by
demons, called upon the Inquisition to examine her, and proposed that a
priest should drive out her devils by exorcism. A friend advised her to
send the Inquisition an account of her life and visions; now she wrote
her classic Vida. The inquisitors scrutinized it, and pronounced it a
holy document which would strengthen the faith of all who should read
it.</p>
<p>Her position fortified by this verdict, Teresa, now fifty-seven,
determined to reform the order of the Carmelite nuns. Instead of
attempting to restore the old ascetic discipline in the cloister of the
Incarnation, she decided to open a separate convent, to which she
invited such nuns and novices as would accept a regimen of absolute
poverty. The original Carmelites had worn coarse sackcloth, had gone
always barefoot, had eaten frugally and fasted frequently. Teresa
required of her Discalced (shoeless) Carmelites approximately the same
austere rule, not as an end in itself, but as a symbol of humility and
rejection of this tempting world. A thousand obstacles were raised; the
townsmen of Avila denounced the plan as threatening to end all
communication between nuns and relatives. The provincial of the order
refused permission for a new convent. Teresa appealed to Pope Pius V,
and won his consent. She found four nuns to join her, and the new
convent of St. Joseph was consecrated in 1 562 on a narrow street in
Avila. The sisters wore sandals of rope, slept on straw, ate no meat,
and remained strictly within their house.</p>
<p>The 1 80 nuns of the older establishment were not pleased by this
simple exposure of their easy ways. The prioress, holding that Teresa
was bound to her by the vow of obedience, commanded her to resume her
former white robe, put on shoes, and return to the convent of the
Incarnation. Teresa obeyed. She was adjudged guilty of arrogance, and
was confined to her cell. The town council voted to close St. Joseph’s
Convent, and sent four strong men to evict its now leaderless nuns. But
the sandaled maidens said, “God wants us to stay, and so we shall stay”;
and the hardened officers of the law dared not force them. Teresa
frightened the Carmelite provincial by sug- gesting that in frustrating
her plans he was offending the Holy Ghost; he ordered her freed. Four
nuns left with her, and the five women walked through the snow to their
new home. The four original members greeted Teresa happily as Madre. To
nearly all Spain she now became Teresa de Jesu, the intimate of God.</p>
<p>Her rule was loving, cheerful, and firm. The house was closed to the
world; no visitors were allowed; the windows were covered with cloth;
the tiled floor served as beds, tables, and chairs. A revolving disk was
built into the wall; whatever food was placed by the people on its outer
half was gratefully accepted, but the nuns were not permitted to beg.
They eked out their sustenance by spinning and needlework; the products
were placed out-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>

<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>side the convent gate; any buyer might take what he liked and leave
what- ever he liked in return. Despite these austerities new members
came, and one of them was the most beautiful and courted woman in Avila.
The general of the Carmelites, visiting the little cloister, was so
deeply impressed that he asked Teresa to found similar houses elsewhere
in Spain. In 1567, taking a few nuns with her, she traveled in a rude
cart over seventy miles of rough roads to establish a Discalced
Carmelite nunnery at Medina del Campo. The only house offered her was an
abandoned and dilapidated building with crumbling walls and leaking
roof; but when the townspeople saw the nuns trying to live in it,
carpenters and roofers came, unasked and unpaid, to make repairs and
simple furniture.</p>
<p>The prior of the Carmelite monastery at Medina, wishing to reform his
relaxed monks, came to Teresa and asked for her rules of discipline. The
prior was tall, but was accompanied by a youth so short and frail that
Teresa, with the humor that brightened her austerities, exclaimed, as
they left: “Blessed be the Lord, for I have a friar and a half for the
foundation of my new monastery.” 24 The diminutive friar, Juan de Yepis
y Alvarez, was destined to be San Juan de la Cruz, St. John of the
Cross, the soul and glory of the Discalced Carmelite monks.</p>
<p>Teresa’s difficulties were not ended. The provincial of the
Carmelites, per - haps to test her rule and courage, appointed her
prioress of the Incarnation Convent. The nuns there hated her, and
feared that now, in revenge, she would subject them to every
humiliation. But she behaved with such modesty and kindness that one by
one they were won over, and gradually the new and stricter regimen
replaced the old laxity. From this victory Teresa ad- vanced to found a
new cloister in Seville.</p>
<p>The friars of the mitigated rule resolved to stop the extension of
the re- form. Some of them smuggled an agent, as a discalced nun, into
the Seville convent. Soon this woman proclaimed to Spain that Teresa
flogged her nuns and heard confessions as if she were a priest. The
Inquisition was again called upon to investigate her. She was summoned
before the fearful tribunal; it heard her testimony, and gave its
verdict: “You are acquitted of all charges. . . . Go and continue your
work.” 25 But a papal nuncio was won over to her enemies. He denounced
Teresa as “a disobedient, contumacious woman who promulgates pernicious
doctrines under the pretense of devotion, who left her cloister against
the orders of her superiors, who is ambitious, and teaches theology as
though she were a doctor of the Church, in contempt of St. Paul, who
forbade women to teach.” He commanded her to retire to confinement in a
nunnery at Toledo (1575).</p>
<p>Hardly knowing where to turn in this new vicissitude, Teresa wrote to
the King. Philip II had read and loved her Life. He sent a special
courier to invite her to an audience; he heard her, and was convinced of
her saintliness.</p>
<p>chap, xxxvih) the church and reform 905</p>
<p>The nuncio, royally reproved, withdrew his order of restraint on
Teresa, and announced that he had been misinformed.</p>
<p>Amid her travels and tribulations she wrote famous manuals of
mystical devotion: El camino de la perfection ( The Way of Perfection ,
1567), and El castillo interior ( The Interior Castle, 1577). In the
latter she revealed the return of her physical ailments. “It seems as
though many swollen rivers were rushing, within my brain, over a
precipice; and then again, drowned by the noise of the water, are voices
of birds singing and whistling. I weary my brain and increase my
headaches.” 26 Heart attacks recurred, and her stomach found it hard to
retain food. Even so she passed painfully from one to an- other of the
many nunneries she had founded, examining, improving, in- spiring. At
Malaga she was seized with a paralytic fit; she recovered, went on to
Toledo, and had another seizure; she recovered, went on to Segovia,
Valladolid, Palencia, Burgos, Alva. There a hemorrhage of the lungs
forced her to stop. She accepted death cheerfully, confident that she
was leaving a world of pain and evil for the everlasting companionship
of Christ.</p>
<p>After a shameful competition, and successive kidnapings of her corpse
by Alva and Avila, she was buried in the town of her birth. Pious wor-
shipers claimed that her body never decayed, and many miracles were re-
ported at her tomb. In 1 593 the order of Discalced Carmelites received
papal sanction. Famous Spaniards like Cervantes and Lope de Vega joined
in an appeal to the Pope to at least beatify her. It was done (1614),
and eight years later Teresa was pronounced, along with the Apostle
James, one of the two patron saints of Spain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a greater than Teresa had come out of Spain to reform the
Church and move the world.</p>

<li>IGNATIUS LOYOLA</li>
</ol>
<p>Don Inigo de Onez y Loyola was born in the castle of Loyola in
the</p>
<p>Basque province of Guipuzcoa in 1491. He was one of eight sons and
five daughters begotten by Don Beltran de Onez y Loyola, a member of the
higher Spanish nobility. Brought up to be a soldier, Inigo received
little schooling, and showed no interest in religion. His reading was
confined to Amadis of Gaul and like romances of chivalry. At seven he
was sent to serve as a page to Don Juan Velasquez de Cuellar, through
whom he had some access to the royal court. At fourteen he fell in love
with Ferdinand the Catholic’s new queen, Germaine de Foix; and when, in
due course , he was knighted, he chose her as his “Queen of Hearts,”
wore her colors, and dreamed of winning a lace handkerchief from her
hand as prize in a tourna- ment. 27 This did not prevent him from
engaging in the casual amours and</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>906</p>
<p>(chap, xxxvm</p>
<p>brawls that were half a soldier’s life. In the simple and honest
autobiography that he dictated in 1553-56, he made no effort to conceal
these natural es- capades.</p>
<p>His carefree youth came to an end when he was assigned to active
military service at Pamplona, capital of Navarre. Four years he spent
there, dreaming of glory and waking to routine. A chance came to
distinguish himself: the French attacked Pamplona, Inigo heartened the
defense with his bravery; the enemy captured the citadel nevertheless,
and Inigo’s right leg was frac - tured by a cannon ball (May 20, 1521).
The victors treated him kindly, set his bones, and sent him on a
stretcher to his ancestral castle. But the bones had been wrongly set;
they had to be rebroken and reset. The second oper- ation proved more
incompetent than the first, for a stump of bone stuck out from the leg;
a third operation set the bones straight, but the leg was now too short;
and for weeks Inigo bore the torture of an orthopedic stretcher that
kept him helpless and weak and in constant pain.</p>
<p>During the weary months of convalescence he asked for books,
preferably for some exciting tale of knighthood and imperiled
princesses. But the castle library was composed of two books only:
Ludolfus’s Life of Christ, and Flos sanctorum, recounting the lives of
the saints. At first the soldier was bored by these volumes; then the
figures of Christ and Mary grew upon him, and the legends of the saints
proved as wonderful as the epics of courtly love and war; these
cavaliers of Christ were every bit as heroic as the Cabal- leros of
Castile. Gradually the thought formed in his mind that the noblest war
of all was that of Christianity against Islam. In him, as in Dominic,
the intensity of Spanish faith made religion no quiet devotion as in
Thomas a Kempis, but a passion of conflict, a holy war. He resolved to
go to Jerusalem and free the sacred places from infidel control. One
night he had a vision of the Virgin and her Child; thereafter (he later
told Father Gonzalez) no temptation to concupiscence ever assailed him.
28 He rose from his bed, knelt, and vowed to be a soldier of Christ and
Mary till his death.</p>
<p>He had read that the Holy Grail had once been hidden in a castle
at</p>
<p>Montserrat in the province of Barcelona. There, said the most famous
of all romances, Amadis had kept a full night’s vigil before an image of
the Virgin to prepare himself for knighthood. As soon as Inigo could
travel he mounted a mule, and set out for the distant shrine. For a
while he still thought of him- self as a soldier accoutered for physical
combat. But the saints he had read about had had no weapons, no armor,
only the poorest clothes and the firm- est faith. Arrived in Montserrat,
he cleansed his soul with three days of con- fession and penance; he
gave his costly raiment to a beggar, and donned a pilgrim’s robe of
coarse cloth. All the night of March 24 -25, 1522, he spent alone in the
chapel of a Benedictine monastery, kneeling or standing before die altar
of the Mother of God. He pledged himself to perpetual chastity and</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVin) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 907</p>
<p>poverty . The next morning he received the Eucharist, gave his mule
to the monks, and set out on limping foot for Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The nearest port was Barcelona. On the way he stopped at the hamlet
of Manresa. An old woman directed him to a cave for shelter. For some
days he made this his home; and there, eager to surpass the saints in
asceticism, he practiced austerities that brought him close to death.
Repenting the proud care that he had once taken of his appearance, he
ceased to cleanse, cut, or comb his hair — which soon fell out; he would
not trim his nails or bathe his body or wash his hands or face or feet;
29 he lived on such food as he could beg, but never meat; he fasted for
days at a time; he scourged himself thrice daily, and each day spent
hours in prayer. A pious woman, fearful that his austerities would kill
him, had him taken to her home, where she nursed him back to health. But
when he was removed to a cell in a Dominican monastery at Manresa he
resumed his self-flagellation. His remembrance of past sins terrified
him; he waged war against his body as the agent of his sins; he was
resolved to beat all thought of sin out of his flesh. At times the
struggle seemed hopeless, and he thought of suicide. Then visions came
and strength- ened him; at communion he believed that he saw not a wafer
of bread but the living Christ; at another time Christ and His Mother
appeared to him; once he saw the Trinity, and understood by a flash of
insight, beyond words or reason, the mystery of three persons in one G
od; and “at another time,” he tells us, “God permitted him to understand
how He had created the world.” 30 These visions healed the spiritual
conflict that had produced them; he put behind him all worry about his
youthful follies; he relaxed his as- ceticism; and having conquered his
body he could now cleanse it without vanity. From the experience of this
struggle, almost a year long, he designed the Spiritual Exercises by
which the heathen flesh could be subdued to the Christian will. Now he
might present himself before the sacred shrines at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>He set sail from Barcelona in F ebruary 1 5 2 3 . En route he stayed
two weeks in Rome, escaping before its pagan spirit could bend him from
sanctity. On July 14 he took ship from Venice for Jaffa. He suffered a
host of calamities before reaching Palestine, but his continuing visions
sustained him. Jerusalem itself was a tribulation: the Turks who
controlled it allowed Christian visi- tors, but no proselytizing; and
when Inigo proposed to convert the Moslems nevertheless, the Franciscan
provincial who had been charged by the Pope to keep the peace bade the
saint return to Europe. In March 1524, he was back in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Perhaps he felt now that though he was master of his body he was
subject to his imaginations. He determined to chasten his mind with
education. Though now thirty-three, he joined schoolboys in studying
Latin. But the itch to teach is stronger than the will to learn. Soon
Ignatius, as he was scho-</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>908</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>lastically called, began to preach to a circle of pious but charming
women. Their lovers denounced him as a spoil-sport, and beat him
brutally. He moved to Alcala (1526), and took up philosophy and
theology. Here too he taught a little private group, chiefly of poor
women, some of them prostitutes hungering for redemption. He tried to
exorcise their sinful propensities by spiritual exercises, but some of
his pupils fell into fits or trances, and the In- quisition summoned
him. He was imprisoned for two months, 31 but he finally convinced the
inquisitors of his orthodoxy, and was released; however, he was
forbidden to teach. He passed on to Salamanca (1527), and went through a
similar sequence of teaching, trial before the Inquisition, impris -
onment, acquittal, and prohibition of further teaching. Disappointed
with Spain, he set out for Paris, always on foot and in pilgrim garb,
but now driv- ing before him a donkey loaded with books.</p>
<p>At Paris he lived in the poorhouse, and begged in the streets for his
food and tuition. He entered the College de Montaigu, where his sallow,
haggard face, starved body, unkempt beard, and aged clothing made him a
cynosure of unsympathetic eyes; but he pursued his purposes with such
absorbed in- tensity that some students began to reverence him as a
saint. Under his lead they engaged in spiritual exercises of prayer,
penance, and contemplation. In 1529 he transferred to the College
Ste.-Barbe, and there too he gathered disciples. His two roommates came
by different routes to believe in his sanctity. Pierre Favre — Peter
Faber — as a shepherd in the Savoyard Alps, had suffered deeply from
fears superstitious or real, and under their in- fluence he had vowed
perpetual chastity. Now, aged twenty, he concealed under his disciplined
manners a soul struggling feverishly against temptations of the flesh.
Ignatius, though making no pretensions to intellect, had the power of
sensing the interior life of others through the intensity of his own. He
surmised the problem of his younger friend, and assured him that the
impulses of the body could be controlled by a trained will. How train
the will? By spiritual exercises, answered Ignatius. Together they
practiced them.</p>
<p>The other roommate, Francis Xavier, came from Pamplona, where Loyola
had soldiered. He had a long line of distinguished ancestors; he was
hand- some, rich, proud, a gay blade who knew the taverns of Paris and
their girls. 32 He laughed at the two ascetics, and boasted of his
successes with women. Yet he was clever in his studies; he already had
the master’s degree, and was aiming at a doctorate. One day he saw a man
whose face was pocked with syphilis; it gave him pause. Once, when he
was expounding his am- bition to shine in the world, Ignatius quietly
quoted the Gospel to him: “What is a man profited if he gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?” Xavier resented the query, but he could
not forget it. He began to join</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVin) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 909</p>
<p>Loyola and Faber in their spiritual exercises; perhaps his pride
stirred him to equal the other two in power to bear deprivation, cold,
and pain. They scourged themselves, fasted, slept in thin shirts on the
floor of an unheated room; they stood barefoot and almost naked in the
snow, to harden and yet subdue their bodies.</p>
<p>The spiritual exercises that had first taken shape at Manresa now
reached a more definite form. Ignatius modeled them on the Exercitatorio
de la vida espiritual (1500) of Don Garcia de Cisneros, Benedictine
abbot at Montser- rat; 33 but he poured into that mold a fervor of
feeling and imagination that made his little book a moving force in
modern history. Loyola took as his starting point the infallibility of
the Bible and the Church; individual judg- ment in religion, he held,
was the vain and chaos-breeding pretense of proud, weak minds. “We ought
always to be ready to believe that what seems to us white is black if
the hierarchical Church so defines it.” 34 To avoid damna - tion we must
train ourselves to be unquestioning servants of God, and of God’s vicar
on earth, the Church.</p>
<p>As the first spiritual exercise we should recall our many sins, and
consider how much punishment they deserve. Lucifer was condemned to hell
for one sin; and is not our every sin a like rebellion against God? Let
us keep a daily count of our sins by marks on lines that represent the
days, and let us strive each day to reduce the marks. Kneeling in our
darkened room or cell, let us picture hell to ourselves as vividly as we
can; we must conjure up all the horrors of that undying fire; we must
vision the torments of the damned, hear their shrieks of pain and their
cries of despair; we must smell the stinking fumes of burning sulfur and
flesh; we must try to feel those tongues of flame scorching our own
bodies; and then we must ask ourselves. How can we escape that
everlasting agony? Only through the redeeming sacrifice which God
Himself, as Christ, offered on the cross.* Let us then contemplate the
life of Christ, and in every detail; we must make ourselves present in
imagination at those profoundest events in the history of the world. We
must in fancy kneel before the holy figures in that divine epic, and
kiss the hem of their garments. After two weeks of such meditations we
must accompany Christ through every step in His Passion, every station
of the cross; we must pray with Him in Gethsemane, feel ourselves
scourged with Him, spat upon, nailed to the cross; we must suffer every
moment of His agony, must die with Him, lie with Him in the tomb. And in
the fourth week we must picture ourselves rising triumphantly from the
grave, rising at last with Him into heaven. Strengthened by that blessed
vision, we shall be ready to join as dedicated soldiers in the battle to
defeat Satan and win</p>
<p>• Note that Luther went through the same fears of hell, the same
penitential austerities’, the same release through faith in the
redeeming sacrifice of Christ, that motived the careei of Ignatius.</p>

<p>men to Christ; and in that holy war we shall gladly bear every
hardship and joyfully spend our lives.</p>
<p>This call to lifelong devotion found nine students at Paris ready to
accept it. Earnest young men feeling for the first time the
unintelligibility of the world, and longing for some anchor of belief
and hope in a sea of doubts and fears, may have been moved, by the very
extent of the demands made upon them, to put their fate, their lives and
salvation, in Loyola’s plan. He proposed that in due time they should go
together to Palestine, and live there a life as nearly as possible like
Christ’s. On August 15, 1534, Loyola, Faber, Xavier, Diego Laynez,
Alonso Salmeron, Nicolas Bobadilla, Simon Rodriguez, Qaude Le Jay, Jean
Codure, and Paschase Broet, in a little chapel in Montmartre, took the
vows of chastity and poverty, and pledged them- selves, after two years
of further study, to go and live in the Holy Land. They had as yet no
apparent notion of combating Protestantism; Islam seemed to them the
greater challenge. They had no interest in theological disputes; their
aim was sanctity; their movement was rooted in Spanish mysticism rather
than in the intellectual conflicts of the time. The best argument would
be a holy life.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1536-37 they walked through France, over the Alps,
and across Italy to Venice, where they hoped to find passage to Jaffa.
But Venice was at war with the Turks; the trip was impossible. During
the delay Ignatius met Caraffa, and for a time joined the Theatines. His
experi- ence with these devoted priests had some influence in changing
his plan from life in Palestine to service of the Church in Europe. He
and his disciples agreed that if, after a year of waiting, Palestine
should still be closed to them, they would offer themselves to the Pope
for any service that he might assign to them. Faber secured permission
for all of them to be ordained priests.</p>
<p>By this time Loyola was forty-six. He was bald, and still limped
slightly from his wound. His five feet and two inches would have left
him quite unimpressive had it not been for an aristocratic refinement of
features, the sharp nose and chin, the somber, deep-set, piercing black
eyes, the grave, intent countenance; he was already the absorbed and
almost humorless saint. He was no persecutor; though he approved of the
Inquisition, 85 he was rather its victim than its agent. He was stern
but kind; he willingly served the sick in hospitals and plague. His
dream was to win converts not by the pyre or the sword but by catching
character in malleable youth and forming it immovably to faith. Founder
of the most successful educational order in history, he laid little
emphasis on learning or intellect. He was not a theolo- gian, took no
part in the arguments and refinements of the Scholastics; he preferred
direct perception to rational understanding. He did not have to argue
about the existence of God, of Mary and the saints; he was convinced
that he had seen them; he felt them closer to him than any object or
person</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXVIIl) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 911</p>
<p>in his surroundings; in his own way he was a God-intoxicated man. Yet
his mystical experiences did not make him impractical. He could combine
pliancy of means with inflexibility of ends. He would not justify any
means for an end that he held good, but he could bide his time, moderate
his hopes and demands, adjust his methods to characters and conditions,
use diplomacy where needed, judge men shrewdly, choose fit aides and
agents, and manage men as if he were — as he actually thought himself —
a general leading a martial company. He called his little band by a
military term, Compania de Jesu; they were soldiers enlisted for life in
the war against unbelief and the dis- solution of the Church. For their
part, as a matter of course and necessity, they accepted the military
discipline of co-ordinated action under absolute command.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1537 Loyola, Faber, and Laynez set out from Venice
to</p>
<p>Rome to ask papal approval of their plans. They walked all the way,
begged their food, and lived mostly on bread and water. But they sang
psalms happily as they went along, as if they knew that out of their
small number would grow a powerful and brilliant organization.</p>
<p>V. THE JESUITS</p>
<p>Arrived in Rome they did not at once ask audience with the Pope, for
Paul III was immersed in critical diplomacy. They took service in the
Spanish hospital, tended the sick, taught the young. Early in 1538 Paul
received them, and was impressed by their desire to go to Palestine and
live there as exemplary monks; he and some cardinals contributed 210
crowns (,- 2 50? ) to pay the passage of the band When the devotees had
to abandon the idea as impracticable, they returned the money to the
donors. 86 Those members who had remained in the north were summoned to
Rome, and the company now numbered eleven. Paul appointed Faber and
Laynez to pro- fessorships in the Sapienza (the University of Rome),
while Ignatius and the rest devoted themselves to works of charity and
education. Loyola made a special mission of converting prostitutes; with
funds collected from his supporters he founded the House of Martha to
receive such women; and his fervent preaching against sexual
transgressions made him many enemies in Rome.</p>
<p>As new candidates were received into the company, it became desirable
to define its principles and rule. The vow of obedience was added to
those of chastity and poverty; the “general” chosen by them was to be
obeyed only next to the Pope. A fourth vow was taken: to “serve the
Roman Pontiff as God’s vicar on earth,” and “to execute immediately and
without hesitation or excuse all that the reigning Pope or his
successors may enjoin upon them</p>
<p>912 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XXXVIII</p>
<p>for the benefit of souls or for the propagation of the faith”
anywhere in the world. In 1539 Loyola asked Cardinal Contarini to submit
these articles of organization to Paul III, and to request the papal
confirmation of the com- pany as a new order. The Pope was favorable;
some cardinals dissented, thinking the group to be unmanageable
extremists; but Paul overcame their objections, and by the bull Reg
imini militantis ecclesiae (“For the rule of the Church Militant”) he
formally established what the bull called Societas Jesu, the “Society of
Jesus” (September 27, 1 540) . The members were prop - erly called
“Clerks Regular of the Society of Jesus”; the name “Jesuit” did not
appear till 1544, and then chiefly as a satirical term used by Calvin
and other critics; 87 it was never used by Ignatius himself. After his
death the success of the new order deprived the term of its early sting,
and in the six- teenth century it was a badge of honor.</p>
<p>On April 17, 1541, Ignatius was elected general. For several days
there- after he washed dishes and discharged the humblest offices. 88
During his re- maining years (he was now fifty) he made Rome his home,
and the city became the permanent headquarters of the society. Between
1547 and 1552, after much thought and experiment, he drew up the
Constitutions which, with minor changes, are the Jesuit rule today. The
ultimate authority in the order was to lie in t he fully “professed”
members. These would choose two delegates from each province, and these
delegates — together with the provin- cial heads, the general, and his
aides — were to compose the “General Congre - gation.” This would, when
occasion required, e lect a new general, and then it would delegate its
authority to him as long as he should commit no grave offense. He was
given an “admonitor” and four assistants, who were to watch</p>
<p>Candidates for admission were required to pass through two years of
novitiate, in which they would be trained in the purpose and discipline
of the society, go through the spiritual exercises, perform menial
duties, and submit to the superiors in absolute “holy obedience.” They
must put aside their own individual wills, and allow themselves to be
ordered like soldiers and moved about “like corpses”; 89 they must learn
to feel that in obeying their superiors they are obeying God. They must
agree to report the faults of their associates to their superiors, and
to harbor no resentment against being reported themselves. 40 This
discipline was rigorous but discriminating and flexible; rarely did it
break the will or destroy initiative. Apparently the willingness to obey
is the first step in learning to command, for this training produced a
great number of able and enterprising men.</p>
<p>Those who s urvived this trying novitiate would take “simple”—
revocable —vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and would enter the
“second class.” Some of these would remain in that status as lay
brothers; some, as</p>
<p>CHAP.XXXVIIl) THE CHURCH AND REFORM 9 1 3</p>
<p>“formed scholastics,” aspiring to the priesthood, would study
mathematics,</p>
<p>Seldom has an institution borne so definitely the stamp of one
personality. Loyola lived long enough to revise the Constitutions into a
successfully func- tioning rule. From his small, bare room he guided
with severe authority and great skill the movements of his little army
in every quarter of Europe, and many other parts of the globe. The task
of governing the society, and of establishing and administering two
colleges and several charitable foun- dations in Rome, proved too much
for his temper as he aged; and though kind to the weak he became cruelly
harsh to his closest subordinates. 42 He was severest on himself. He
made many a meal from a handful of nuts, a piece of bread, and a cup of
water. Often he left but four hours of the day for sleep, and even
restricted to a daily half-hour the period that he allowed himself for
celestial visions and illumination. 48 When he died (1556) many Romans
felt that a sharp wind had ceased to blow, and perhaps some of his
followers mingled relief with grief. Men could not realize, so soon,
that this indomitable Spaniard would prove to be one of the most
influential men in modern history.</p>
<p>At his death the society had approximately a thousand members, of
whom some thirty- five were “professed.” 44 After disputes that showed
consider - able will to power in Jesuits supposedly broken in will,
Diego Laynez was chosen general (1558); the fact that he had Jewish
ancestors four gener- ations back made him unacceptable to some Spanish
grandees who had some influence in the order. 46 Pope Paul IV, fearful
that the office of Jesuit gen- eral, because of its life tenure, might
grow to rival the papacy, ordered the Constitutions revised to limit the
general’s term to t hree years; but Pius IV revoked the order, and the
general became (as later generations would call him from his black
cassock) the “Black Pope.” After Francis Borgia, Duke</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>914</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>of Gandia, joined the order and dowered it with his wealth, the
society grew rapidly in size and power. When he became its third general
(1565) it had 3,500 members, living in 130 houses in eighteen provinces
or countries.</p>
<p>Europe was but a small sector of its activities. It sent missionaries
to India, China, Japan, and the New World. In North America they were
venture- some and undiscourageable explorers, suffering every
tribulation as a gift of God. In South America they did more than any
other group to develop education and scientific agriculture. In 1541
St. Francis Xavier left Lisbon on a Portuguese vessel, and after a year
of travel and travail reached Goa. There he walked up and down the
streets ringing a hand bell to gather an audience; this accomplished, he
expounded the Christian creed with such sincerity and eloquence, and
illustrated the Christian ethic with such cheer- ful sharing of his
poorest listeners’ life, that he made thousands of converts</p>
<p>The same devotion which the Jesuits showed in foreign missions was
dis- played in their work in Europe. They kept to their posts, and
tended the sick, in times of plague. 60 They preached to all classes,
and accommodated their language to every situation. Their superior
education and good man-</p>
<p>CHAP, xxxvm) the church and reform 915</p>
<p>ners made them the favorite confessors of women and nobles, finally
of kings. They mingled actively in the affairs of the world, but with
prudence and tact; Ignatius advised them that more prudence and less
piety were bet- ter than more piety and less prudence. 61 Usually they
were men of high moral quality; the faults charged against them in a
later period hardly ap- peared in this age. 52 Though they corporately
approved of the Inquisition, 58 they stood aside from it, preferring to
work through education. Their limited number compelled them to leave to
others the instruction of children; they concentrated on secondary
education; and finding the universities pre- empted by other orders, or
the secular or Protestant clergy, they organized their own colleges, and
sought to train selected youths who would be centers of influence in the
next generation. They became the greatest educators of their time.</p>
<p>At important points in Europe they established studia inferiora —
corres- ponding to the German Gymnasien and the French lycSes — and
studia su- periora — colleges. Sometimes, as at Coimbra and Louvain,
they were able to take over existing universities. They shocked their
competitors by giving instruction gratis. The curriculum probably owed
something to the schools set up in Holland and Germany by the Brethren
of the Common Life, some- thing to the Gymnasium of Sturm at Strasbourg,
something to the humanist academies of Germany and Italy. It was based
on the classics and was given in Latin; the use of the vernacular was
forbidden to the students except on holidays. 54 In the higher grades
the Scholastic philosophy was restored. The education of character — of
morals and manners — was given fresh emphasis, and was bound up anew
with religious belief. The traditional faith was in- culcated daily, and
a regimen of prayer, meditation, confession, communion. Mass, and
theology so imbued the students with orthodoxy that few of them, in the
sixteenth century, ever strayed from that beaten path. Humanism was
turned back from paganism to Christianity. The system had serious
defects: it relied too much on memory, and discouraged originality. Like
the other curricula of the time it was deficient in the sciences, and
expurgated history to control the present. And yet so independent a
thinker as Francis Bacon would soon say of the Jesuit schools, “Such as
they are, would that they were ours.” 55 In the next two centuries their
graduates would excel in al- most every walk of life except scientific
research.</p>
<p>By the time of Loyola’s death there were a hundred Jesuit
colleges.</p>
<p>Through education, diplomacy, and devotion, through fervor directed
by discipline, through co-ordination of purposes and skillful variation
of means, the Jesuits turned back the Protestant tide, and recaptured
much of Ger- many, most of Hungary and Bohemia, all of Christian Poland,
for the Church. Rarely has so small a group achieved so much so rapidly.
Year by year its prestige and influence grew, until, within twenty years
of its formal</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>916</p>
<p>(chap. XXXVIII</p>
<p>establishment, it was recognized as the most brilliant product of the
Catho- lic Reform. When at last the Church dared to call that general
council to which all Europe had so long looked for the quieting of its
theological strife and the healing of its religious wounds, it was to a
handful of Jesuits — to their learning, loyalty, discretion,
resourcefulness, and eloquence — that the popes entrusted the defense of
their own challenged authority, and the un- diminished preservation of
the ancient faith.</p>
