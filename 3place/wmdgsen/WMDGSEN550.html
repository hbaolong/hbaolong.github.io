Scene</h4>
<p>i75 6 - 8 9</p>
<p>I. THE PRESS</p>
<p>I N the background were newspapers, magazines, publishers,
circulating libraries, theaters, all multiplying recklessly, bringing to
an ever wider public the conflicts of parties and talents. Several
journals were now born: The Literary Magazine and The Critical Review in
1756, The Public Ledger in 1760. Johnson’s Rambler began in 1750; The
Gentleman’s Magazine , which fed Johnson in his struggling years, had
begun in 1731, and was to survive till 1922. The London newspapers
doubled their number and total circulation in this period. The Monitor
began in 1755, The North Briton in 1761, The Morning Chronicle in 1769,
The Morning Herald in 1780, The Daily Universal Register in 1785,
becoming The Times in 1788. The Public Advertiser struck gold in the
letters of Junius; its circulation rose from 47,500 to 84,000. Most of
the other dailies subsisted on narrow clienteles; so the circulation of
The Times in 1795 was only 4,800. They were more modest in size than in
speech — usually four pages, one of which was given to advertisements.
Johnson in 1759 thought that newspaper ad- vertising had reached its
limit.</p>
<p>Advertisements are now so numerous that they are very negligently
perused, and it is therefore necessary to gain attention by magnificence
of promise, and by eloquence sometimes sublime and sometimes pathetic….
The vendor of the beautifying fluid sells a lotion that repels pimples,
washes away freckles, smooths the skin, and plumps the flesh…. The trade
of advertising is now so near perfection that it is not easy to propose
any improvement. But as every art ought to be exercised in due
subordination to the public good, I cannot but propose it as a moral
question to these masters of the public ear, whether they do not
sometimes play too wantonly with our passions? 1</p>
<p>Printers, booksellers, and publishers were still largely confused in
one profession. Robert Dodsley had published Pope and Chesterfield, and
now printed Walpole and Goldsmith. Thomas Davies had a popular bookshop,
where he allowed leisurely browsing, and Johnson and others came there
to sample the books and ogle the pretty wife. William Strahan won fame
by publishing Johnson’s Dictionary , Smith’s Wealth of Nations , and
Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire — the latter two in the
annus mirabilis</p>
<ol start="1776" type="1">
<li>Oxford established the Clarendon Press in 1781. Booksellers paid
well for good books, but could get hacks to prepare articles and
compilations for a pittance. Says a bookseller in Henry Brooke’s The

<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>

<p>(1766): “I can get one of these gentlemen,… on whose education more
money has been spent than… would maintain a decent family to the end of
the world — I can get one of them to labor like a hackney horse from
morning to night at less wage than I could hire… a porter or shoe-boy
for three hours.” 2 Authors multiplied to saturation of the market,
fought desperately for their starveling share, and satirized one another
with poi- soned ink. Women added to the competition: Mrs. Anna Barbauld,
Sarah Fielding, Mrs. Amelia Opie, Mrs. Elizabeth Inchbald,
Mrs. Elizabeth Mon- tagu, Fanny Burney, Hannah More. A country parson
entered the game and walked away with the prize.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>LAURENCE STERNE</li>
</ol>
<p>He was not made for a parson; he was the son of a soldier, and
was</p>
<p>dragged from post to post for ten years; then and afterward he picked
up enough military lore to make Uncle Toby talk like an old general
about sieges and forts. His mother he later described as “the daughter
of… a poor sutter [peddler] who followed the camp in Flanders.” 3
However, his great-grandfather had been archbishop of York, and the
Sterne family man- aged to get Laurence to Cambridge on a scholarship.
He took his degree there in 1737, but a lung hemorrhage in 1736 foretold
a lifelong struggle with tuberculosis. Ordained an Anglican priest
(1738), he was given a modest vicarage at Sutton-in-the-Forest, near
York. In 1741 he married Elizabeth Lumley, and took her to live with him
in his tattered rectory. She entrusted to him her forty pounds a year;
he invested some of it in land, and it grew.</p>
<p>Otherwise they were miserable. Both were consumptives, and both were
made of nerves. Mrs. Sterne soon concluded that “the largest house in
Eng - land could not contain them both, on account of their turmoils and
dis- putes.” 4 Her cousin, “bluestocking” Elizabeth Mont agu, described
her as a fretful porcupine, “with whom one could avoid a quarrel only by
keeping at a distance.” 5 Two children came; one died, the other, Lydia,
became con - spicuously attached to her mother. Unhappiness increased
when Sterne’s mother and sister, who had been living in poverty in
Ireland, came to York and appealed to him to settle eight pounds a year
upon them out of his wife’s income. The idea aroused no enthusiasm.
Sterne gave his mother some money and begged her to go back to Ireland.
She remained in York. When she was arrested for vagrancy Sterne refused
to bail her out.</p>
<p>After eighteen years of arduous marriage the vicar felt that any
really Christian soul would allow him a little adultery. He fell in love
with Cather- ine Fourmantelle, and swore, “I love you to distraction,
and will love you to eternity.” 6 His wife accused him of infidelity; he
denied it; she came so close to insanity that he put her and Lydia in
care of “a lunatic doctor,” and continued the liaison.</p>
<p>Amid the tumult he wrote one of the most famous books in English
litera-</p>
<p>788</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>ure. His friends, having read some of the manuscript, begged him to
elimi- nate “gross allusions which could be matter of j ust offense,
especially when coming from a clergyman.” Sorrowfully he deleted some
150 pages. The remainder he sent to the press anonymously; it was
published in January, 1760, as The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy
, Gent. Enough scandal and whimsical humor remained in the two volumes
to make them the literary event of the London year. Far off in Ferney
the furor echoed: “A very un - accountable book,” Voltaire reported,
“and an original one; they run mad about it in England.” 7 Hume called
it “the best book that has been writ by any Englishman these thirty
years, bad as it is.” 8 At York, where Sterne’s authorship was an open
secret and many local figures were recognized in the leading characters,
two hundred copies were sold in two days.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe the book, for it has no form or subject, no
head or tail. The title is a trick, for the “Gent.” who tells the story,
and whose “life and opinions” were to be presented, does not get born
until page 209 of Vol- ume IV (of the original nine-volume edition). The
substance of the tale is what happened, or was said, while he was being
conceived, and while he was growing leisurely in the womb. The first
page is the best:</p>
<p>I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they
were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about
when they begot me; had they duly considered how much depended 1 a dii
what they were doing; — that not only the production of a rational Being
was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and
temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his
mind,… might take their turn from the humors and dispositions which were
then uppermost; — Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and
proceeded accordingly, I am verily persuaded I should have made a quite
different figure in the world.</p>
<p>“Pray, my Dear,” quoth my mother, “have you not forgot to wind up the
clock?”— “Good G— !” cried my father,… “D id ever woman, since the crea-
tion of the world, interrupt a man with such a silly question?”</p>
<p>From that contretemps onward the book consists of digressions. Sterne
had no tale to tell, much less that tale of love which is the burden of
most fiction; he wished to amuse himself and the reader with whimsical
discourse on everything, but in no order; he galloped around the big and
little prob- lems of life like a frisky horse in a field. After writing
sixty-four chapters he bethought himself that he had given his book no
preface; he inserted one at that point; this allowed him to make fun of
his critics. He called his method “the most religious, for I begin with
writing the first sentence, and trusting to Almighty God for the
second,” 9 and to free association for the rest. Rabelais had done
something of the sort; Cervantes had allowed Rosi- nante to lead him
from episode to episode; Robert Burton had roamed the world before
anatomizing melancholy. But Sterne raised inconsequence to a method, and
freed all novelists from the need to have a subject or a plot.</p>
<p>The leisure classes of Britain were delighted to see how much ado
could be made about nothing, and how a book could be written in
Anglo-Saxon English in the age of Johnson. Lusty Britons welcomed the
jolly novelty of a clergyman talking about sex and flatulence, and the
slit in Uncle Toby’s</p>
<p>pants. In March, 1760, Sterne went down to London to sip his success;
he</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>789</p>
<p>was happy to find the two volumes sold out; he took /’ 6 3 o for them
and two to come. Even the Sermons of Mr. Y orick, published four months
after Tristram, found ready sale when it was known that Yorick was
Sterne. In- vitations came to the author from Chesterfield, Reynolds,
Rockingham, even Bishop Warburton, who surprised him with fifty guineas,
perhaps to escape adorning some satiric page in future volumes. Sterne
bought a carriage and team, and drove in merry triumph back to York,
where he preached in the great minster. He was presented to a richer
parsonage at Coxwold, fifteen miles from York; he took his wife and
daughter to live with him there; and there, with inconsequential
facility, he wrote Volumes III — IV of Tristram.</p>
<p>In December of that year 1760 he went to London to see these volumes
through the press. They were adversely reviewed, but the edition was
sold out in four months. Now Tristram reached birth by forceps, which
de- formed his nose; whereupon the author sailed forth on a long
discourse on the philosophy of noses, in the style of the most learned
pundits. The shape of a child’s nose, said one authority, was determined
by the softness or hard - ness of the nursing breast: “by sinking into
it,… as into so much butter, the nose was comforted, nourished, plumped
up, refreshed, refocillated.” 10</p>
<p>After half a year in London Sterne returned to his wife, who told him
she had been happier without him. He withdrew into his manuscript, and
wrote Volumes V-VI; in these Tristram was almost forgotten, and Uncle
Toby and Corporal Trim, with their war memories and toy forts, occupied
the stage. In November, 1761, the parson went off again to London, and
on the last day of the year he saw V-VI published. They were well
received. He flirted with Mrs. Elizabeth Vesey, one of the
“bluestockings”; vowed he would give the last rag of his priesthood for
a touch of her divine hand; 11 had a lung hemorrhage, and fled to the
south of France. He stopped long enough in Paris to attend some dinners
at d’Holbach’s “synagogue of athe - ists,” where Diderot took a lasting
fancy to him. Hearing that his wife was ill, and that Lydia was
developing asthma, Sterne invited them to join him in France. All three
settled down near Toulouse (July, 1762).</p>
<p>In March, 1764, he left his wife and daughter, with their consent,
and re- turned to Paris, London, and Coxwold. He wrote Volumes VII- VIII
of T ristram, received advance payment for them, and sent part of the
proceeds to Mrs. Sterne. The new volumes appeared in January, 1765, to
waning ac- claim; the Shandy-Toby vein was running thin. In October
Sterne began a tour of eight months in France and Italy. On his way
north he joined his family in Burgundy; they asked to remain in France;
he paid their expenses and returned to Coxwold (July, 1766). Between
hemorrhages he wrote Volume IX. He went to London to see it born
(January, 1767), and enjoyed the furor caused by his skirting the brink
of sex in describing Uncle T oby’s wooing of Mrs. Wadman. Scandalized
readers wrote to newspapers and the Archbishop of York, demanding that
this shameless parson be unfrocked and evicted; the prelate refused.
Sterne meanwhile collected subscriptions, totaling £ 1,050, for a
promised Sentimental Journey. He sent more money to his wife, and made
love to Elizabeth Draper.</p>
<p>She was the wife of an East India Company official then (March,
1767)</p>
<p>790</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>stationed in India. She had married him at fourteen, when he was
thirty-four. Sterne sent her his books, and proposed to follow them with
his hand and his heart. For a while they saw each other daily, and
exchanged tender mis- sives. The ten “Letters to Eliza” voice the last
sad passion of a man dying of tuberculosis. “ ’Tis true, I am ninety
-five in constitution, and you but twenty- five;… but what I want in
youth I will make up in wit and good humor. Not Swift so loved his
Stella, Scarron his Maintenon, or Waller his Sacha- rissa, as I will
love and sing thee, my wife elect! ’’—for “my wife cannot live long.” 12
Ten minutes after dispatching this letter he had a severe hemorrhage,
and he bled till four in the morning. In April, 1767, Mrs. Draper,
summoned by her husband, sailed for India. From April 1 3 to August 4
Sterne kept a “Journal to Eliza,” a “diary of the miserable feelings of
a person separated from a Lady for whose society he languished.” “I will
take thee on any terms, Eliza! I shall be… so just, so kind to thee, I
will deserve not to be miserable hereafter.” 13 In the journal under
April 2 1 : “Parted with twelve</p>
<p>By June he had recovered, and returned to Coxwold. While writing A
Sentimental Journey he suffered more hemorrhages, and realized that he
had not long to live. He went to London, saw the little book published
(Febru- ary, 1768), and for the last time enjoyed the undiminished
affection of his friends. As T ristram had recalled Rabelais, so the new
volume reflected the rising influence of Richa rdson and Rousseau. But
Sterne’s virtue was less irrefragable than Richardson’s, and his tears
less hot and sincere than Rous - seau’s. Perhaps it was this book, and
Henry Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling (1771), that made sentiment and
sentimental fashionable words in England. Byron thought that Sterne
“preferred whining over a dead ass to relieving a living mother.” 15</p>
<p>While Sterne was enjoying his final triumph in London he caught a
cold, which grew into pleurisy. He wrote to a Mrs. James a pitiful
letter asking her to care for Lydia if Mrs. Sterne should die. Death
came to him on March 1 8, 1768, in an inn on Old Bond Street, with no
friends near. He was fifty-two years old. He had a bit of the mountebank
in him, and made himself “a motley to th e view”; but we can understand
his sensitivity to women, and the strain that an unhappy marriage placed
upon a man capable of such subtle percep- tions and delicate artistry.
He suffered much, gave much, and wrote one of the most peculiar books in
all the history of literature.</p>

<li>FANNY BURNEY</li>
</ol>
<p>A woman briefly rivaled his success in fiction. She was born in 1752
to Charles Burney, the future historian of music. She was brought up on
notes</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>79 1</p>
<p>rather than on letters; till she was eight she could not read; 16 no
one dreamed that she would be a writer. Her mother died when Frances was
nine. As almost all the musicians who performed in London came to her
father’s home, and attracted to it a good portion of the elite, Fanny
acquired edu- cation by listening to words and music. She matured
slowly, was shy and plain, and took forty years to find a husband. When
her famous novel was published (January, 1778) she was twenty-five, and
was so fearful lest it displease her father that she concealed her
authorship. Evelina , or A Young Lady’s Entrance into the World , made a
stir. Anonymity aroused curiosity; rumor said a girl of seventeen had
written it. Johnson, who had been praised in its preface, praised it,
and recommended it to Dr. Burney. Mrs. Thrale complained that it was too
short. When Mrs. Thrale learned the secret it spread over London; Fanny
became a lioness of society; everybody read her book, and “my kind and
most devoted father was so happy in my happi- ness.” 17</p>
<p>Her art lay in describing, with lingering memory and lively
imagination, how the world of London society appeared to an orphaned
girl of seventeen who had been brought up by a rural parson not at all
like Laurence Sterne. Doubtless Fanny too had thrilled to Garrick’s
acting, and had felt as Evelina wrote to her guardian: “Such ease! such
vivacity in his manner! such grace in his motions! such fire and meaning
in his eyes!… And when he danced, O, how I envied Clarinda! I almost
wished to have jumped on the stage and joined them.” 18 London, wearying
of its vice, felt cleansed by the fresh wind blowing from these youthful
pages.</p>
<p>That once famous novel is dead, but the diary that Fanny kept is
still a living part of English literature and history, for it offers a
near view of celebrities from Johnson and George III to Herschel and
Napoleon. Queen Charlotte made Miss Burney her keeper of the robes
(1786), and for the next five years Fanny dressed and undressed her
Majesty. The constrained and narrow life nearly stifled the authoress;
at last her friends rescued her, and in 1793, youth quite gone, she
married a ruined emigre, General d’Ar - blay. She supported him by her
writings and her income; for ten years she lived with him in France and
obscurity, isolated by the intensity of the Rev- olutionary and
Napoleonic wars. In 1814 she was allowed to return to Eng- land and
receive the last blessing of her father, who died at the age of eighty-
eight. She herself lived to that age, into quite a different world,
which did not realize that the famous Jane Austen (died 1817) had taken
her inspira- tion from the forgotten novels of a forgotten lady who was
still alive in 1840.</p>

<li>HORACE WALPOLE</li>
</ol>
<p>“This world,” he said, “is a comedy to those who think, a tragedy to
those who feel.” 19 So he learned to smile at the world, even to humor
his gout. He chronicled his time, but washed his hands of it. He was son
of a prime min- ister, but had no pleasure in politics. He loved women,
from Fanny Burney to the grandest duchesses, but he would have none of
them for a wife, nor</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>792</p>
<p>(so far as we know) for a mistress. He studied philosophy, but
thought the philosophers the bane and bore of the century. One author he
admired with- out reserve for her fine manners and unaffected art — Mme.
de Sevigne; her alone he sought to emulate; and if his letters did not
catch her gay charm and grace, they became, far more than hers, a living
daily history of an age. Though he called them annals of Bedlam, 20 he
wrote them with care, hoping that some of them would give hi m a nook in
man’s remembrance; for even a philosopher who is reconciled to decay
finds it hard to accept oblivion.</p>
<p>Horatio (so he was baptized in 1717) was the youngest of five
children presented to Sir Robert Walpole, the doughty Premier who
sacrificed his reputation by preferring peace to war, but hardly hurt it
by preferring adultery to monogamy. 21 Perhaps to avenge his first wife,
gossipers for a time ascribed Horace’s paternity t o Carr, Lord Hervey,
brother to the ef- feminate John, Lord Hervey of Ickworth — who accused
Sir Robert of at- tempting to seduce Lady Hervey. 22 These matters are
too intricate for present adjudication; we can only say that Horace was
brought up with no imputation, by his relatives, of any undue origin. He
was treated with busy indifference by the Prime Minister, and (he tells
us) was “indulged” with “extreme fondness” by his mother. 23 He was a
very handsome boy, and was dressed like a prince, but he was frail and
diffident, and as sensitive as a girl. When his mother died (1737) many
feared that the twenty-year-old youth would die of grief. Sir Robert
comforted him with governmental sinecures that paid for his son’s fine
clothing, elegant living, and costly collection of art. Horace kept to
the end of his life a latent hostility to his father, but always
defended his politics.</p>
<p>At ten he was sent to Eton, where he learned Latin and French and</p>
<p>formed a friendship with the poet Gray. At seventee n he entered
King’s College, Cambridge; there he learned Italian, and imbibed deism
from Con- yers Middleton. At twenty-two, without taking a degree, he set
out with Gray on a tour of Italy and France. After some wandering they
settled for fifteen mont hs in a Florentine villa as guests of the
British charge d’affaires, Sir Horace Mann. Walpole and Mann never met
again, but they corre- sponded during the next forty-five years
(1741-85). At Reggio Emilia Gray and Walpole quarreled, for Horace had
paid all the bills, and the poet could not forgive the superior
attentions received by the son of the man who was ruling England. In
retrospect Horace took the blame: “I was too young, too fond of my own
diversions,… too much intoxicated by indulgence, van- ity, and the
insolence of my situation,… not to have been inattentive and insensible
to the feelings of one I thought below me; of one, I blush to say it,
that I knew was obl iged to me.” 24 They parted; Walpole nearly died of
remorse, or quinsy; he arranged for Gray’s passage home. They were recon
- ciled in 1745, and most of Gray’s poems were printed by Walpole’s
press at Strawberry Hill. Meanwhile, at Venice, Walpole posed for a
lovely pastel portrait by Rosalba Carriera.</p>
<p>Before reaching England (September 12, 1741 ), Walpole had been
elected to Parliament. There he made a modest and futile speech against
the opposi-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>793</p>
<p>ion that was bringing to an end his father’s long and prosperous
ministry. He was regularly re-elected till 1767, when he voluntarily
withdrew from active politics. Generally he supported the liberal Whig
program: he re- sisted extension of the royal power, recommended a
compromise with Wilkes, and denounced slavery (1750) nine years before
Wilberforce was born. He opposed the political emancipation of English
Catholics on the ground that “papists and liberty are contradictions.”
25 He rejected the Amer - ican case against the Stamp Act, 26 but he
defended the claim of the American colonies to freedom, and prophesied
that the next zenith of civilization would be in America. 27 “Who but
Machiavel,” he wrote (1786), “can pretend that we have a shadow of title
to a foot of land in India?” 28 He hated war, and when the Montgolfier
brothers made their first balloon ascension (1783) he predicted with
horror the extension of war to the skies. “I hope,” he wrote, “these new
mechanic meteors will prove only playthings for the learned or the idle,
and not be converted into engines of destruction to the human race, as
is so often the case of refinements or discoveries in science.” 29</p>
<p>Finding himself too often on the losing side, he decided to spend
most of his time in the country. In 1 747 he rented five acres and a
small house near Twickenham. Two years later he bought the property, and
transformed the building in neo-Gothic style — as we have seen. Into
this medievalized castle he gathered a variety of objects distinguished
by art or history; soon his home was a museum that required a catalogue.
In one room he installed a printing press, where he published in elegant
formats thirty-four books, including his own. Chiefly from Strawberry
Hill he sent out the 3,601 let- ters that survive. He had a hundred
friends, quarreled with nearly all of them, made up, and was as kind as
his delicate irritability would allow. Every day he set out bread and
milk for the squirrels who courted him. He guarded his sinecures and
angled for more, but when his cousin Henry Con- way was dismissed from
office Walpole proposed to share his income with him.</p>
<p>He had a thousand faults, which Macaulay meticulously accumulated in
a brilliant and ungenerous essay. Walpole was vain, fussy, secretive,
capri- cious, proud of his ancestry, and disgusted with his relatives.
His humor tended to satire with sharp teeth. He carried to his grave,
and into his his- tories, his scorn of all who had shared in deposing
his father. He was often wildly biased, as in his descriptions of Lady
Pomfret 30 or Lady Mary Wort- ley Montagu. 31 His fragile frame inclined
him to be something of a dilet- tante. If Diderot, in Sainte- Beuve’s
illuminating phrase, was the most Ger - man of all Frenchmen, Walpole
was the most French of all Englishmen.</p>
<p>He was fearlessly candid about his uncommon tastes and views; he
thought Virgil a bore, and a fortiori, Richardson and Sterne; he called
Dante “a Methodist in Bedlam.” 32 He affected to disdain all authors,
and insisted, like Congreve, that he wrote as a gentleman for his own
amusement, not as a literary laborer dependent upon the merchandizing of
his words. So he wrote to Hume: “You know in England we read their
works, but seldom or never take any notice of authors. We think them
sufficiently paid if their</p>
<p>794</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>books sell, and of course leave them to their colleges and obscurity,
by which means we are not troubled by their vanity and impertinence…. I,
who am an author, must own this conduct very sensible; for in truth we
are a most useless tribe.” 33</p>
<p>But, as he admitted, he too was an author, vain and voluminous. Bored
in his castle, he explored the past as if wishing to sink the roots of
his mind into the richest seams. He drew up a Catalogue of the Royal and
Noble Authors of England (1758) — their nobility would excuse their
authorship, and first- rate men like Bacon and Clarendon could qualify.
He had three hundred copies printed, and gave most of them away; Dodsley
risked an edition of two thousand copies; they sold readily, and
brought^ Walpole such fame as must have made him hang his head in shame.
He compounded his indignity with five volumes of Anecdotes of Tainting
in England (1762-71), an en- gaging compilation which won Gibbon’s
praise.</p>
<p>As if in recreation from such laborious scholarship, Walpole composed
a medieval romance, The Castle of Otranto (1764), which became the
mother of a thousand stories of supernatural wonders and terrors. He
combined mystery with history in Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign
of King Richard III. He contended, like others after him, that Richard
had been maligned by tradition and Shakespeare; Hume and Gibbon called
his argu- ments unconvincing; Walpole repeated them till his death.
Turning to events of which he had firsthand knowledge, he composed
memoirs of the reigns of George II and George III; they are illuminating
but partisan. Im- prisoned in his prejudices, he took a dark view of his
time: “treacherous ministers, mock patriots, complacent parliaments,
fallible prince s.” 34 “I see my country going to ruin, and no man with
brains enough to save it”; 35 this was written in 1768, when Chatham had
just created the British Empire. Fourteen years later, when the King and
Lord North seemed to have ruined it, Walpole concluded: “We are totally
degenerated in every respect, which I suppose is the case of all falling
states”; 36 a generation later the little island defeated Napoleon. All
mankind seemed to Walpole a menagerie of “pigmy, short-lived,… c omical
animals.” 37 He found no comfort in religion. He supported the
Established Church, for it upheld the government that paid his
sinecures, but he frankly termed himself an infidel. 38 “I begin to
think that folly is matter, and cannot be destroyed. Destroy its form,
it takes an- other.” 39</p>
<p>For a while he thought he could find stimulation in France
(September,</p>
<p>1765). All doors were opened to him; Mme. du Deffand welcomed him as
a replacement for d’Alembert. She was sixty -eight, Walpole was
forty-eight, but the interval disappeared as their kindred souls met in
an affectionate ex- change of despair. She was pleased to find that
Walpole agreed with most of what Voltaire said, but would have gone to
the stake to prevent him from saying it; for h e trembled to think what
would happen to Europe’s govern - ments if Christianity collapsed. He
deprecated Voltaire, but he ridiculed Rousseau. It was on this trip to
Paris that he wrote the letter, supposedly from Frederick the Great,
inviting Rousseau to come to Berlin and enjoy more</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII )</p>
<p>T H E LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>795</p>
<p>persecutions. “The copies have spread like wildfire,” and “behold me
a la mode!” 40 — he succeeded Hume as the lion of the salons. He learned
to love the gay and merciless excitement of Paris, but he was consoled
to find “the French ten times more contemptible than we [English] are.”
41</p>
<p>After reaching home (April 22, 1766) he began his long correspondence
with Mme. du Deffand. We shall see later how he fretted lest her
affection make him ridiculous; yet it was probably to see her again that
he revisited Paris in 1767, 1769, 1771, 1775. Her love made him forget
his age, but the death of Gray (July 30, 1771) reminded him of his own
mortality. He sur- prised himself by surviving till 1797. He had no
financial worries; he had in 1784 an income of X 8,000 (00,000?) a year;
42 and in 1791 he succeeded to the title of Lord Orford. But his gout,
which had begun when he was twenty-five, continued to be his tribulation
till the end. Sometimes, we are told, accumulations of “chalk” broke out
from his fingers. 43 He grew parched and stiff in his final years, and
occasionally he had to be carried by his servants from room to room; but
he kept on working and writing, and when visitors came they marveled at
the bright interest in his eyes, the alert- ness of his courtesy, the
gaiety of his speech, the alacrity and clarity of his mind. Almost every
day distinguished people came to see his famous home and varied
collection; Hannah More in 1786, Queen Charlotte in 1795.</p>
<p>Yet it was not at Strawberry Hill, but at his town house in
Berkeley</p>
<p>Square that he passed away, March 2, 1797, in his eightieth year. As
if re- gretting that his memoirs and letters contained so many lines
with a sting, he ordered his manuscripts to be locked in a chest not to
be opened “till the first Earl of Waldegrave that shall attain the age
of thirty-five years shall demand it.” 44 So the memoirs came to be
published only in or after 1822, when all who might have taken offense
would be dead. Some of the letters were published in 1778, more in 1818,
1820, 1840, 1857…. All over the English-reading world there are men and
women who have read every word of those letters, and who treasure them
as among the most delightful legacies of the illuminating century.</p>
<p>V. EDWARD GIBBON</p>
<p>“Good historians,” Walpole wrote to one of them, Robertson, “are the
most scarce of all writers, and no wonder! A good style is not very com-
mon; thorough information is still more rare; and if these meet, what a
chance that impartiality should be added to them!” 45 Gibbon did not
quite meet the last test, but neither did Tacitus, who alone can stand
with him among the supreme historians.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preparation</li>
</ol>
<p>Gibbon wrote or began six autobiographies, which his literary
executor, the first Earl of Sheffield, sewed into remarkably well-knit,
but unduly puri-</p>
<p>796 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP.XXXII</p>
<p>fied, Memoirs (1796), sometimes known as his Autobiography. Also
Gibbon kept a journal, begun in 1761 and continued under diverse titles
till January 28, 1763. These prime sources for his development have been
judged rea- sonably accurate, except for his pedigree.</p>
<p>He spent eight pages detailing a distinguished ancestry; cruel
genealogists have taken it from him. 46 His grandfather, Edward Gibbon
I, was among those directors of the South Sea Company who were arrested
for malfea- sance after that “Bubble” exploded (1721). Of his estate,
which he reckoned</p>
<p>He was born at Putney in Surrey, May 8, 1737. His mother died in 1747
of her seventh pregnancy. The father moved to a rural estate at Buriton,
in Hampshire, fifty-eight miles from London, leaving the boy to be cared
for by an aunt in the grandfather’s house in Putney. T here the future
scholar made much use of the well-stored library. His frequent illnesses
interrupted his progress at Winchester School, but he occupied his
convalescent days with eager reading, mostly of history, especially of
the Near East. “Ma - homet and his Saracens soon fixed my attention;… I
was led from one book to another, till I had ranged round the circle of
Oriental history. Before I was sixteen I had exhausted all that could be
learned in English of the Arabs and Persians, the Ta rtars and Turks.”
49 Hence those fascinating chapters on Mohammed and the early caliphs,
and the capture of Constantinople.</p>
<p>When, aged fifteen, he was sent to Magdalen College, Oxford, “I
arrived with a stock of erudition that might have puzzled a doctor, and
a degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy would have been ashamed.” He
was too sickly to engage in sports, too shy to mingle at ease with other
students. He would have been an apt pupil to a competent teacher. But,
eager to learn, he found no professor eager to teach. Most of the
faculty allowed their scholars to attend the lectures or not, and to
spend half their time in “the temptations of idleness.” 50 They indulged
his “improprieties of conduct, ill - chosen company, late hours, and
incon siderate expense”— even excursions to Bath or London. However, he
“was too young and bashful to enjoy, like a manly Oxonian in town, the
taverns and bagnios of Covent Garden.” 51</p>
<p>The faculty members were all clergymen, who taught and took for</p>
<p>granted the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church. Gibbon was
com- bative and questioned his teachers. It seemed to him that the Bible
and history justified the Catholic Church in its claim to a divine
origin. A Catholic ac- quaintance procured him some u nsettling books,
chiefly Bossuet’s Exposi -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>797</p>
<p>ion of the Catholic Doctrine and the History of the Protestant
Variations; these “achieved my conversion, and I surely fell by a ’noble
hand.” 52 With youthful precipitation he confessed to a Catholic priest,
and was received into the Church of Rome (June 8, 1753).</p>
<p>He notified his father, and was not surprised to be summoned home,
for Oxford accepted no Catholic students, and, according to Blackstone,
for a Protestant to be converted to Roman Catholicism was “high
treason.” The scandalized parent hastily banished the youth to Lausanne,
and arranged to have him stay with a Calvinist pastor. There Edward
lived at first in a mood of sullen obstinacy. But M. Pavilliard, though
not indulgent, was kind, and the boy slowly warmed to him. Moreover, the
pastor was a good classical scholar. Gibbon learned to read and write
French as readily as English, and acquired an easy familiarity with
Latin. Soon he was received into cultured families, whose manners and
conversation were a better education than Ox- ford had given him.</p>
<p>As his French improved he felt the breezes of French rationalism
blowing into Lausanne. When only twenty (1757) he attended with delight
the plays presented by Voltaire in nearby Monrion. “I sometimes supped
with the ac - tors.” 53 He met Voltaire, he began to read Voltaire, he
read Voltaire’s re - cently published Essai sur I’histoire generate (
Essai sur les moeurs ). He pored over Montesquieu’s Esprit des lois
(1748), and the Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur des Romains
et de leur decadence (1734) be- came the starting point of the Decline
and Fall. In any case the influence of the French philosophers, added to
his reading of Hume and the English deists, undermined Gibbon’s
Christianity as well as his Catholicism, and M. Pavilliard’s victory for
the Reformation was canceled by Gibbon’s secret acceptance of the
Enlightenment.</p>
<p>It must have been exhilarating to meet, in the same year (1757), both
Vol- taire and Suzanne Curchod. She was twenty, blond, beautiful, gay,
and lived with her Protestant parents at Crassy, four miles from
Lausanne. She was the leading spirit in the Societe du Printemps — a
group of fifteen or twenty young women who met at one another’s homes,
sang, danced, acted comedies, and flirted judiciously with young men;
Gibbon assures us that “their virgin chastity was never sullied by the
breath of scandal or suspi - cion.” Let him tell the story.</p>
<p>In her short visits to some relations at Lausanne the wit, the
beauty, and erudition of Mile. Curchod were the theme of universal
applause. The report of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity; I saw and
loved. I found her learned without pedantry, lively in conversation,
pure in sentiment, and elegant in man- ners…. Her fortune was humble,
but her family was respectable…. She permitted me to make her two or
three visits at her father’s house. I passed some happy days there,… and
her parents honorably encouraged the connection…. I indulged my dream of
felicity. 54</p>
<p>Apparently they were formally engaged in November, 17 57, 55 but
Suzanne’s consent was conditional on Gibbon’s promise to live in
Switzerland. 56</p>
<p>Meanwhile his father, confident that his son was now a good
Protestant,</p>
<p>798</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>bade him return home and hear the plans that had been made for him.
Gib- bon was not eager to go back, for the father had taken a second
wife; but he obeyed, and reached London May 5, 1758. “I soon discovered
that my fa - ther would not hear of this strange alliance, and that
without his consent I was myself destitute and helpless. After a painful
struggle, I yielded to my fate: I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son.”
57 He conveyed this sigh to Su - zanne by a letter of August 24. His
father settled upon him an annuity of X300. His stepmother earned his
gratitude by bearing no children, and soon he developed an affection for
her. He spent a large part of his income on books, and “gradually formed
a numerous and select library, the founda - tion of my works, and the
best comfort of my life.” 58</p>
<p>He had begun at Lausanne, he finished at Buriton (where he spent his
summers), an Essai sur 1 ’ etude de la litterature, which was published
in Lon- don in 1761 and in Geneva in 1762. Written in French, and
dealing chiefly with French literature and philosophy, it made no stir
in England, but was received on the Continent as a remarkable
performance for a youth of twenty- two. It had some significant ideas on
the writing of history. “The history of empires is that of the misery of
man. The history of knowledge is that of his greatness and happiness…. A
host of considerations makes the last order of study precious in the
eyes of the philosopher.” 59 Hence, “if philosophers are not always
historians, it is at least desirable that historians should be
philosophers.” 60 In his Memoirs Gibbon added: “From earliest yout h I
aspired to the character of an historian.” 61 He cast about for a sub -
ject that would lend itself to philosophy and literature as well as to
history. In the eighteenth century history made no pretense to be a
science; rather, it longed to be an art. Gibbon felt that it was as a
philosopher and an artist that he wished to write history: to deal with
large subjects in a large perspec- tive, and to give to the chaos of
materials philosophical significance and ar- tistic form.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was called from scholarship to action. During the Seven
Years’ War England had been repeatedly in danger of invasion from
France. To prepare against such an emergency the English gentry formed a
militia for defense against invasion or rebellion. Only propertied
persons could serve as officers. Gibbon Senior and Junior were
commissioned as major and captain in June, 1759. Edward III joined his
company in June, 1760, and stayed with it, on and off, till December,
1762, moving from camp to camp. He was ill suite d to military life, and
“tired of companions who had neither - tary career he found his scrotum
expanding with fluid. “I was obliged to - day [September 6, 1762] to
consult Mr. Andrews, a surgeon, in relation to a complaint I had
neglected for some time; it was a swelling in my left testi- cle, which
threatens being a serious affair.” 63 He was bled and physicked, with
only temporary reli ef. This “hydrocele” was to torment him until it
caused his death.</p>
<p>On January 25, 1763, he set out upon a Continental tour. He stopped
some time in Paris, where he met d’Alembert, Diderot, Raynal, and
other</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>799</p>
<p>luminaries of the Enlightenment. “Four days in a week I had a place…
at the hospitable tables of Mesdames Geoffrin and Boccage, of the
celebrated Helvetius, and of the Baron d’OIbach…. Fourteen weeks
insensibly stole away; but had I been rich and independent I should have
prolonged, and perhaps have fixed, my residence at Paris.” 64</p>
<p>In May, 1763, he reached Lausanne, where he remained almost a year.
He saw Mile. Curchod, but, finding her well courted, he made no attempt
to renew his friendship with her. In this second stay in Switzerland, he
con- fesses, “the habits of the militia and the example of my countrymen
betrayed</p>
<p>In April, 1764, he crossed the Alps. He spent three months in
Florence, then went on to Rome. “In the daily labor of eighteen weeks” a
Scotch ex - patriate guided him among the remains of classical
antiquity. “It was at Rome, on the fifteenth of October, 1764, as I sat
musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were
singing vespers in the Temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the
decline and fall of the city first started to my mind. But my original
plan was circumscribed to the decay of the city rather than of the E
mpire.” 66 He came to think of that fateful disin - tegration as “the
greatest, perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of mankind.” 67
After visiting Naples, Padua, Venice, Vicenza, and Verona he returned
through Turin and Lyons and Paris (“another happy fortnight”) to London
(June 25, 1765).</p>
<p>Spending most of his time now at Buriton, he let himself be diverted
into beginning, in French, a history of Switzerland. Hume, having seen
the manuscript in London, wrote to Gibbon (October 24, 1767) begging him
to use English, and predicting that English would soon surpass the
French language in spread and influence; moreover, he warned Gibbon that
his use of the French tongue had led him “into a style more poetical and
figurative and more highly colored, than our language seems to admit of
in historical productions.” 68 Gibbon later admitted: “My ancient
habits… encour - aged me to write in French for the continent of Europe,
but I was conscious myself that my style, above prose and below poetry,
degenerated into a ver- bose and turgid declamation.” 69</p>
<p>The death of his father (November 10, 1770) left him an ample
fortune. In October, 1772, he took up permanent residence in London. “No
sooner was I settled in my house and library than I undertook the
composition of the first volume of my history.” 70 He allowed himself
many distractions— evenings at White’s, attendance at Johnson’s “Club,”
trips to Brighton, Bath, Paris. In 1774 he was elected to Parliament
from a “pocket borough” controlled by a relative. He kept silence amid
the debates in the House of Commons. “I am still mute,” he wrote
(February 25, 1775); “it is more tre - mendous than I imagined; the
great speakers fill me with despair, the bad</p>
<p>8oo</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>ones with terror”; 71 but the “eight sessions that I sat in
Parliament were a school of civil prudence, the first and most essential
virtue of an historian.” 72 Surrounded by the controversy on America, he
voted regularly for the pol- icy of the government; he addressed to the
French nation a Memoir e justifi- catif (1779) presenting England’s case
against her revolting colonies; and he received as reward a seat on the
Board of Trade and Plantations, bringing him ^750 a year. Fox accused
him of profiting by the same kind of political corruption which he
indicated as one cause of the decline of Rome. 73 The wits said George
III had bought Gibbon lest the author record the decline and fall of the
British Empire. 74</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The Book</li>
</ol>
<p>After 1772 Gibbon’s absorbing concern was his history, and he found
it difficult to think seriously about anything else. “Many experiments
were</p>
<p>In 1775 Gibbon offered the manuscript of the first sixteen chapters
to a publisher, who refused it as necessitating a prohibitive price. Two
other booksellers, Thomas Caldwell and William Strahan, pooled their
risks in printing (February 17, 1776) Volume I of The Decline and Fall
of the</p>
<p>Roman Empire. Though it was priced at a guinea (6.00?), the thousand
copies were sold by March 26. A second edition, of fifteen hundred
copies, issued on June 3, was exhausted in three days. “My book was on
every tab le, and almost on every toilette.” 76 The literary world,
usually rent with fac - tional jealousies, united in praising it.
William Robertson sent generous compliments; Hume, in this year of his
death, wrote to the author a letter which, said Gibbon, “overpaid the
labor of ten years.” 77 Horace Walpole, on the day after publication,
announced to William Mason: “Lo, there is just appeared a truly classic
work.”</p>
<p>The book began logically and bravely with three scholarly chapters
de- tailing the geographical extent, the military organization, the
social struc- ture, and the legal constitution of the Roman Empire at
the death of Marcus Aurelius (a.d. i 80). The preceding eighty-four
years, Gibbon felt, had seen the Empire at its peak of official
competence and public content.</p>
<p>If a man were called upon to fix the period in the history of the
world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and
prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from
the death of Domitian [96] to the accession of Commodus [180]. The vast
extent of the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the
guidance of virtue and wisdom. The armies were restrained by the firm
but gentle hand of four successive em- perors whose characters and
authority commanded involuntary respect. The forms of the civil
administration were carefully preserved by Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and
the Antonines, who delighted in the image of liberty, and were pleased
with considering themselves as the accountable ministers of the
laws.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXII )</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>… The labors of these monarchs were overpaid by the… honest pride of
virtue, and by the exquisite delight of beholding the general happiness
of which they were the authors. 78</p>
<p>But Gibbon recognized the “instability of a happiness which must
depend on the character of a single man. The fatal moment was perhaps
approach- ing, when some licentious youth or some jealous tyrant would
abuse… that absolute power.” 79 The “good emperors” had been chosen by
adoptive monarchy — each ruler transmitting his authority to a chosen
and trained</p>
<p>Gibbon thought that the rise of Christianity had contributed to that
de- cline. Here he abandoned the lead of Montesquieu, who had said
nothing like this in his Greatness and decadence of the Romans; Gibbon,
rather, fol- lowed Voltaire. His attitude was thoroughly intellectual;
he had no sym- pathy for mystic rapture or hopeful faith. He expressed
his view in a passage that has a Voltairean flavor: “The various modes
of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the
people as equally true, by the philosopher as equally false, and by the
magistrate as equally useful. And thus toleration produced relig ious
concord.” 80 Gibbon usually avoided any direct expression of hostility
to Christianity. There were still laws on the statute books of England
making such expression a serious crime; e.g., “if any person educated in
the Christian religion shall by writing… deny the Christian religion to
be true, he shall… for the second offense… suffer three years’
imprisonment without bail.” 81 To avoid such inconven - ience Gibbon
developed subtle suggestion and transparent irony as elements in his
style. He carefully pointed out that he would discuss not the primary
and supernatural sources of Christianity, but only the secondary and
natural factors in its origin and growth. Among these secondary factors
he listed “the pure and austere morals of the Christians” in their first
century, but he added, as another cause, “the inflexible (and, if we may
use the expression, the intolerant) zeal of the Christians.” 82 And
while he praised “the union and discipline of the Christian republic,”
he noted that “it gradually formed an independent and increasing state
in the heart of the Roman Empire.” 83 In general he reduced the early
progress of Christianity from a miracle to a natural process; he removed
the phenomenon from theology to history.</p>
<p>How had Christianity made for the decline of Rome? First, by sapping
the faith of the people in the official religion, and thereby
undermining the state which that religion supported and sanctified.
[This, of course, was precisely the argument of the theologians against
the philosophes.] The Roman gov- ernment distrusted the Christians as
forming a secret society hostile to mili- tary service, and diverting
men from useful employments to concentration on heavenly salvation. (The
monks, in Gibbon’s judgment, were idlers who found it easier to beg and
pray than to work.) Other sects could be tolerated because they were
tolerant and did not imperil the unity of the nation; the Christians
were the only new sect that denounced all others as vicious and</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>damned, and openly predicted the fall of “Babylon”— i.e., Rome. 84
Gibbon attributed much of this fanaticism to the Judaic origin of
Christianity, and he followed Tacitus in denouncing the Jews at various
points in his narra- tive. He proposed to interpret Nero’s persecution
of the Christians as really a persecution of the Jews; 85 this theory
has no supporter today. With more success he followed Voltaire in
reducing the number of Christians martyred by the Roman government; he
reckoned them to be two thousand at most; and agreed with Voltaire “that
the Christians, in the c ourse of their intestine dissensions [since
Constantinel, have inflicted far greater severities on each other than
they have experienced from the zeal of infidels”; and “the Church of
Rome defended by violence the empire she had acquired by fraud.” 88</p>
<p>These concluding chapters (xv-xvi) of Volume I aroused many replies
accusing Gibbon of inaccuracy, unfairness, or insincerity. Ignoring his
crit- ics for the time being, he treated himself to an extended vacation
in Paris (May to November, 1777). Suzanne Curchod, become the wife of
the banker and finance minister Jacques Necker, invited him to their
home. She was now too comfortable to resent his having “sighed as a
lover, obeyed as a son”; and M. Necker, so far from being jealous, often
left the former lovers alone and went to business or bed. “Could they
insult me more cruelly?” Gibbon complained. “What an impertinent
security!” Suzanne’s daughter, Germaine (the future Mme. de Stael),
found him such good com- pany that she (aged eleven) tried her budding
arts on him, and offered to marry him so as to keep him in the family.
87 At the Neckers’ he met the Emperor Joseph II; at Versailles he was
presented to Louis XVI, who was said to have shared in translating
Volume I into French. He was feted in the salons, particularly by the
Marquise du Deffand, who found him “gentle and polite,… superior to
nearly all the persons among whom I live,” but pro - nounced his style
“declamatory, oratorical,” and “in the tone of our pro - fessed wits.”
88 He rejected an invitation from Benjamin Franklin, with a card saying
that though he respected the American envoy as a man and a philosopher,
he could not reconcile it with his duty to his King to have any
conversation with a revolted subject. Franklin replied that he had such
high regard for the historian that if ever Gibbon should consider the
decline and fall of the British Empire as a subject, Franklin would be
happy to furnish him with some relevant materials. 89</p>
<p>Back in London, Gibbon prepared a reply to his critics — A
Vindication of Some Passages in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters of
the History of the Decline and. Fall of the Roman Empire (1779). He
dealt briefly and cour- teously with his theological opponents, but he
rose to some temper in han- dling Henry Davies, a youth or twenty-one,
who had in 284 pages accused Gibbon of inaccuracies. The historian
admitted some mistakes, but denied “willful misrepresentations, gross
errors, and servile plagiarisms.” 90 The Vindication was generally
received as a successful rebuttal. Gibbon made no further reply to
criticism except casually in the Memoirs, but he found place for some
conciliatory compliments to Christianity in his later volumes.</p>
<p>His writing was accelerated by the loss of his seat in Parliament

<li>They were quietly received. The barbarian invasions were an old
story, and the long and expert discussions of the heresies that had
excited the Christian Church in the fourth and fifth centuries were of
no interest to a generation of worldly skeptics. Gibbon had sent an
advance copy of Vol- ume II to Horace Walpole; he visited Walpole in
Berkeley Square, and was chagrined to be told that “there is so much of
the Arians and Eunomians and semi-Pelagians… that though you have
written the story as well as it could be written, I fear few will have
patience to read it.” “From that</li>

<p>Volume II recovered life when Constantine came to the front. Gibbon
interpreted the famous conversion as an act of statesmanship. The
Emperor had perceived that “the operation of the wisest laws is
imperfect and pre - carious. They seldom inspire virtue, they c annot
always restrain vice.” Amid the chaos of morals, economy, and government
in the disrupted Empire, “a prudent magistrate might observe with
pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a
pure, benevolent, and universal system of ethics, adapted to every duty
and every condition of life, recommended as the will and reason of the
supreme Deity, and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or
punishments.” 93 That is, Constantine recognized that</p>
<p>He ended Chapter xxxvni and Volume III with a footnote praising</p>
<p>George Ill’s “pure and generous love of science and of mankind.” In
June, 1781, by the aid of Lord North, Gibbon was re-elected to
Parliament, where he resumed his support of the ministry. The fall of
Lord North (1782) brought an end to the Board of Trade, and to Gib bon’s
post therein; “I was stripped of a convenient salary of £750 a year.” 94
When North took a place in the coalition ministry (1783), Gibbon applied
for another sinecure; he received none. “Without additional income I
could not long or prudently mai ntain the style of expense to which I
was accustomed.” 95 He calculated</p>
<p>He had originally planned to end The Decline and Fall with the
conquest of Rome in 476. Bu t after publishing Volume III he “began to
wish for the daily task, the active pursuit, which gave a value to every
book, and an object to every inquiry.” 97 He decided to interpret “Roman
Empire” to</p>
<p>8c&gt;4 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>mean the Eastern as well as the Western Empire, and to continue his
narra- tive to the destruction of Byzantine rule through the conquest of
Constan- tinople by the Turks in 1453. So he added a thousand years to
his scope, and undertook hundreds of new subjects requiring arduous
research.</p>
<p>Volume IV included masterly chapters on Justinian and Belisarius, a
chap- ter on Roman law which won high praise from jurists, and a dreary
chapter on the further wars within Christian theology. “I wish,” wrote
Walp ole, “Mr. Gibbon had never heard of Monophysites, Nestorians, or
any such fools!” 98 In Volume V Gibbon turned with evident relief to the
rise of Mohammed and the Arab conquest of the Eastern Roman Empire, and
he lavished upon the Prophet and the martial caliphs all the impartial
under- standing that had failed him in the case of Christianity. In
Volume VI the Crusades gave him another stirring theme, and the capture
of Constantinople by Mohammed II provided the climax and crown of his
work.</p>
<p>In the final chapter he summarized his labors in a famous sentence:
“I have described the triumph of barbarism and religion.” 99 Like his
unac - knowledged teacher, Voltaire, he saw nothing in the Middle Ages
but crudity and superstition. He pictured the ruinous state of Rome in
1430, and quoted Poggio’s lament, “This spectacle of the world, how it
is fallen, how changed, how defaced!”— the destruction or dilapidation
of classic monu- ments and art, the Forum Romanum overgrown with weeds
and possessed by cattle and swine. And Gibbon concluded sadly: “It was
among the ruins of the Capitol that I first conceived the idea of a work
which has amused and exercised near twenty years of my life, and which,
however inadequate to my own wishes, I finally deliver to the curiosity
and candor of the pub- lic.” And in his Memoirs he recalled that hour of
ambivalent deliverance:</p>
<p>It was on the… night of the 27th of June, 1787, between the hours of
eleven and twelve, that I wrote the last lines of the last page, in a
summer house in my garden. After laying down my pen I took several turns
in… a covered walk of acacias, which commands a prospect of the country,
the lake, and the mountains…. I will not dissemble the emotions of joy
on the recovery of my freedom, and, perhaps, the establishment of my
fame. But my pride was soon humbled, and a sober melancholy was spread
over my mind, by the idea that I had taken an everlasting leave of an
old and agreeable companion, and that whatever might be the future fate
of my History, the life of the historian must be short and precarious.

<p>Gibbon at sixteen was described by M. Pavilliard as “a thin little

<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE LITERARY SCENE 805</p>
<p>disconcerting prominence. Despite his handicaps he was vain of his
appearance and his dress, and prefaced Volume II with his portrait by
Reynolds. He carried a snuffbox at his waist, and tapped it when nervous
or wishing to be heard. He was self-centered, like any man with an
absorbing purpose. But he truthfully claimed: “I am endowed with a
cheerful temperament, a mod - erate sensibility [but no sentiment!], and
a natural disposition to repose.” 103</p>
<p>In 1775 he was elected to “the Club.” He attended f requently but
rarely spoke, disliking Johnson’s idea of conversation. Johnson
commented too audibly on Gibbon’s “ugliness”; 104 Gibbon called the
Great Bear an “oracle,” “an unforgiving enemy,” “a bigoted though
vigorous mind, greedy of every pretext t o hate and persecute those who
dissent from his creed.” 105 Boswell, feeling no mercy for an infidel,
described the historian as “an ugly, affected, disgusting fellow,” who
“poisons our Literary Club for me.” Nevertheless Gibbon must have had
many friends, for in London he dined out almost every night.</p>
<p>He came from Lausanne to London in August, 1787, to supervise the
pub- lication of Volumes IV-VI. They appeared on his fifty-first
birthday, May 8, 1788, and brought him ,£4,000, one of the highest fees
paid to an author in the eighteenth century. “The conclusion of my work
was generally read, and variously judged….Yet, upon the whole, the
History of the Decline and Fall seems to have struck root, both at home
and abroad, and may, per- haps, a hundred years hence, still continue to
be abused.” 106 Already Adam Smith ranked him “at the head of the whole
literary tribe at present existing in Europe.” 107 On June 1 3, 1788,
during the trial of Hastings in Westminster</p>
<p>In July, 1788, Gibbon returned to Lausanne. A year later Dey verdun
died, leaving his home to Gibbon for the duration of the historian’s
life. There, with several servants and an income of £ 1,200 a year,
Gibbon lived at ease, drank much wine, and added to his gout and girth.
“From February 9 to July 1, 1790, I was not able to move from my house
or chair.” 110 To this period belongs the legend that he knelt at the
feet of Mme. de Crousaz with a declaration of love, that she bade him
rise, and that he could not, be- ing too heavy. 111 The sole source of
the story is Mme. de Genlis, whom Sainte- Beuve described as “a woman
with a malicious tongue”; 112 and her own daughter rejected the tale as
due to a confusion of persons. 113</p>
<p>The French Revolution interfered with Gibbon’s tranquillity. Revolu -
tionary sentiments were voiced in the Swiss cantons, and word came of
simi- lar agitation in England. He had good reason to fear the collapse
of the French monarchy, having invested £ 1,300 in a French government
loan. 114 In 1788, in an unlucky prophecy, he had written of the French
monarchy that “it stood founded, as it might seem, on the rock of time,
force, and opin - ion, supported by the triple Aristocracy of the
Church, the Nobility, and</p>
<p>8o6</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>he Parliaments.” 115 He rejoiced when Burke issued Reflections on the
Revo - lution in France ( 1 790) ; he wrote to Lord Sheffield advising
against any re- form in the British political structure; “if you admit
the smallest and most - plored the success of the philosophes in
combating religion; “I have so me- times thought of writing a dialogue
of the dead, in which Lucian, Erasmus, and Voltaire should mutually
acknowledge the danger of exposing an old superstition to the contempt
of the blind and fanatical multitude.” 117 He urged some Portuguese
leaders not to abandon the Inquisition during this crisis that
threatened all thrones. 118</p>
<p>Partly to escape the French Revolutionary army that was nearing Lau-
sanne, partly to seek English surgery, and proximately to comfort Lord
Sheffield on the death of his wife, Gibbon left Lausanne (May 9, 1793)
and hurried to England. There he found Sheffield so busy with politics
as to have rapidly recovered from his grief; “the patient was cured,”
Gibbon wrote, “before the arrival of the doctor.” 119 The historian
himself now submitted to the physicians, for his hydrocele had grown
“almost as big as a small child…. I crawl about with some labor and much
indecency.” 120 One operation drained four quarts of “transparent watery
liquid” from the affected testicle. But the fluid collected again, and a
second tapping drew three quarts. Gib- bon was temporarily relieved, and
resumed dining out. Once more the hy- drocele formed; now it became
septic. On January 13, 1794, a third tapping was made. Gibbon seemed to
be recovering rapidly; the doctor allowed him meat; Gibbon ate some
chicken, and drank three glasses of wine. He was seized with severe
gastric pains, which, like Voltaire, he sought to ease with opium. On
January 16 he died, aged fifty-six.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The Historian</li>
</ol>
<p>Gibbon was not inspiring in his visible person, character, or career;
his greatness was poured into his book, into the grandeur and courage of
its conception, the patience and artistry of its composition, the
luminous maj- esty of the whole.</p>
<p>Yes, Sheridan’s word was right. Gibbon’s style is as luminous as
irony would allow, and it shed light wherever it turned, except where
prejudice darkened his view. His diction was molded by his Latin and
French studies; he found simple Anglo-Saxon words unsuitable to the
dignity of his manner, and often he wrote like an orator — Livy
sharpened with the satire of Tacitus, Burke brightened with the wit of
Pascal. He balanced clauses with the skill and delight of a juggler, but
played the game so often that sometimes it neared monotony. If his style
seems pompous, it fitted the reach and splendor of his theme — the
thousand-year crumbling of the greatest empire the world had ever seen.
The venial sins of his style are lost in the masculine march of the
narrative, the vigor of the episodes, the revealing portraits and
descrip- tions, the magisterial summations that cover a century in a
paragraph, and marry philosophy to history.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl) THE LITERARY SCENE 807</p>
<p>Having undertaken so extensive a subject, Gibbon felt justified in
narrow- ing its limits. “Wars, and the administration of public
affairs,” he said, “are</p>
<p>failed,” in the judgment of Bury, “to bring out the momentous fact
that</p>
<p>His scholarship was immense and detailed. His footnotes are a
treasury of learning lightened with wit. He studied the most recondite
aspects of classi- cal antiquity, including roads, coins, weights,
measures, laws. He made mis- takes which specialists have corrected, but
the same Bury who pointed out his errors added: “If we take into account
the vast range of his work, his accuracy is amazing.” 123 He could not
(like professional historians confining themselves to a small area of
subject, place, and time) burrow into unprinted original sources; to get
his work done he restricted himself to printed ma- terial, and frankly
relied in part on secondary authorities like Ockley’s His - tory of the
Saracens or Tillemont’s Histoire des empereurs and Histoire
ecclesiastique; and some of the authorities he relied upon are now
rejected as untrustworthy. 124 He declared his sources in honest detail,
and thanked them; so, when he passed beyond the time that Tillemont
treated, he said in a footnote: “Here I must take leave forever of that
incomparable guide.” 125</p>
<p>What conclusions did Gibbon reach from his study of history?
Sometimes he followed the philosophes in accepting the reality of
progress: “We may acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age in
the world has increased and still increases the real wealth, the
happiness, the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race.”
126 But in less amiable moments— and perhaps because he had taken war
and politics (and theology) as the substance of history — he judged
history to be “indeed little more than the register of the crimes,
follies, and misfortunes of mankind.”* 127 He saw no design in his -
tory; events are the outcome of unguided causes; they are the
parallelogram of forces of different origin and composite result. In all
this kaleidoscope of events human nature seems to remain unchanged.
Cruelty, suffering, and in- justice have always afflicted mankind, and
always will, for they are written in the nature of man. “Man has much
more to fear from the passions of his fellow creatures than from the
convulsions of the elements.” 129</p>
<p>Child of the Enlightenment, Gibbon longed to be a philosopher, or
at</p>

<p>(CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>least to write history en philosophe. “An enlightened age requires
from the historian some tincture of philosophy and criticism.” 130 He
loved to interrupt his narrative with philosophical comments. But he did
not profess to reduce history to laws, or t o formulate a “philosophy of
history.” On some basic questions, however, he took a stand: he confined
the influence of climate to the early stages of civilization; he
rejected race as a determining factor; 131 and he acknowledged, within
limits, the inf luence of exceptional men. “In human life the most
important scenes will depend upon the character of a single actor…. An
acrimonious humor falling upon a single fiber of one man may prevent or
suspend the misery of nations.” 132 When the Koreish could have
assassinated Mohammed “the lance of an Arab might have changed the
history of the world.” 133 If Charles Martel had not defeated the Moors
at Tours (732) the Moslems might have overrun all Europe; “the
interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of
Oxford, and her pupils might demonstrate to a circumcised people the
sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet. From such calamities
was Christendom delivered by the genius and fort une of one man.” 134
However, for maximum influence on his time, the exceptional individual
must stand upon some wide support. “The effects of personal valor are so
inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory… must depend
upon the degree of skill with which the passions of the multitude are
combined and guided for the service of a single man.” 135</p>
<p>All in all, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire may be ranked as
the supreme book of the eighteenth century, with Montesquieu’s UE sprit
des lois as its closest competitor. It was not the most influential; it
could not compare in effect upon history with Rousseau’s Social Contract
or Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, or Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.
But as a work of literary art it was unsurpassed in its time or kind.
When we ask how Gib- bon came to produce such a masterpiece, we perceive
that it was the acci- dental combination of ambition with money,
leisure, and ability; and we wonder how soon such a combination can be
expected to recur. Never, said another historian of Rome, Barthold
Niebuhr; “Gibbon’s work will never be excelled.” 138</p>

<p>Who would now suppose that in 1760 the most popular of living English
poets was Charles Churchill? Son of a clergyman, and himself ordained an
Anglican priest, he took to the pleasures of London, dismissed his wife,
rolled up debts, and wrote a once famous poem, The Rosciad (1761), which
enabled him to pay his debts, to settle an allowance on his wife, and to
“set up in glaringly unclerical attire as a man about town.” 137 His
poem took its name from Quintus Roscius, who had dominated the Roman
theater in Caesar’s day; it satirized the leading actors of London, and
made Garrick wince; one victim “ran about the town like a stricken
deer.” 138 Churchill</p>

<p>joined Wilkes in the ribald rites of Medmenham Abbey, helped him
write The North Briton , and went to France to share Wilkes’s exile; but
he died at Boulogne (1764) of a drunken debauch, and “with epicurean
indiffer - ence.” 139</p>
<p>Another clergyman, Thomas Percy, lived up to his cloth, became bishop
of Dromore in Ireland, and made a mark on European literature by
rescuing, from the hands of a housemaid who was about to burn it, an old
manuscript that provided one source for his Reliques of Ancient Poetry
(1765). These ballads from medieval Britain appealed to old memories,
and encouraged the romantic spirit — so long subdued by rationalism and
the classic temper — to express itself in poetry, fiction, and art.
Wordsworth dated from these Re- liques the rise of the Romantic movement
in English literature. Macpherson’s Ossian, Chatterton’s poems,
Walpole’s Castle of Otranto and Strawberry Hill, Beckford’s Vathek and
Fonthill Abbey, were varied voices joining in the cry for feeling,
mystery, and romance. For a time the Middle Ages cap- tured the modern
soul.</p>
<p>Thomas Chatterton began his attempt to medievalize himself by
brooding over old parchments which his uncle had found in a Bristol
church. Born in that city (1752) soon after his father’s death, the
sensitive and imaginative boy grew up in a world of his own historic
fancies. He studied a dictionary of Anglo-Saxon words, and composed, in
what he thought was fifteenth- century language, poems which he
pretended to have found in St. Mary Radcliffe Church, and which he
ascribed to Thomas Rowley, an imaginary fifteenth-century monk. In 1769,
aged seventeen, he sent some of these “Rowley poems” to Horace Walpole—
who had himself published Otranto as a medieval original five years
before. Walpole praised the poems and in- vited more; Chatterton sent
more, and asked for help in finding a publisher, and some remunerative
employment in London. Walpole submitted the verses to Thomas Gray and
William Mason, both of whom pronounced them forgeries. Walpole wrote to
Chatterton that these scholars “were by no means sat isfied with the
authenticity of his supposed mss;” and he advised him to put poetry
aside until he could support himself. Then Walpole went off to Paris,
forgetting to return the poems. Chatterton wrote three times for them;
three months passed before they came. 140</p>
<p>The poet went to London (April, 1770) and took an attic room in Brook
Street, Holborn. He contributed pro-Wilkes articles, and some of the
Row- ley poems, to various periodicals, but was so poorly paid
(eightpence per poem) that he could not sustain himself on the proceeds.
He tried and failed to secure a post as surgeon’s assistant on an
African trader. On August 27 he composed a bitter valedictory to the
world:</p>
<p>Farewell, Bristolia’s dingy piles of brick,</p>
<p>Lovers of Mammon, worshipers of trick!</p>
<p>Ye spumed the boy who gave you antique lays,</p>
<p>And paid for learning with your empty praise.</p>
<p>Farewell, ye guzzling aldermanic fools,</p>
<p>By nature fitted for corruption’s tools!…</p>

<p>Farewell, my mother! — cease, my anguish’d soul,</p>
<p>Nor let distraction’s billows o’er me roll!</p>
<p>Have mercy. Heaven! when here I cease to live,</p>
<p>And this last act of wretchedness forgive.</p>
<p>Then he killed himself by drinking arsenic. He was seventeen years
and nine months old. He was buried in a pauper’s grave.</p>
<p>His poems now fill two volumes. Had he called them imitations instead
of originals he might have been recognized as a genuine poet, for some
of the Rowley pieces are as good as most originals of the same genre.
When he wrote in his own name he could indite satiric verses almost
rivaling Pope’s, as in “The Methodist” 141 or— bitterest of all —
seventeen lines lashing Walpole as a heartless sycophant. 142 When his
surviving manuscripts were published (1777) the editor charged Walpole
as partly responsible for the poet’s death; Walpole defended himself on
the ground that he had felt no obligation to help a persistent impostor.
143 Some warmhearted souls like Goldsmith in- sisted that the poems were
genuine; Johnson laughed at his friend, but said: “This is the most
extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowl - edge. It is
wonderful how the whelp has written such things.” 144 Shelley briefly
commemorated the boy in Adonais , 145 and Keats inscribed Endymion to
his memory.</p>
<p>Chatterton escaped from the rugged realities of Bristol and London
via medieval legends and arsenic; William Cowper fled from the London
that Johnson loved into rural simplicity, religious faith, and periodic
insanity. His grandfather was acquitted of murder and became a judge;
his father was an Anglican clergyman; his mother belonged to the same
family that had pro- duced John Donne. She died when he was six, leaving
him melancholy memories of fond solicitude; fifty-three years later,
when a cousin sent him an old picture of her, he recalled, in a tender
poem, 146 the efforts she often made to calm the fears that darkened his
childhood nights.</p>
<p>From those indulgent hands he passed, in his seventh year, to a
boarding school where he became the timid fag of a bully who spared him
no humil- iating task. He suffered from inflammation of the eyes, and
for years he had to be under an oculist’ s care. In 1741, aged ten, he
was sent off to West- minster School in London. At seventeen he began
three years’ service as clerk in a solicitor’s office in Holborn. He was
ripe now for romance; as his cousin Theodora Cowper lived nearby, she
became the idol of his day- dreams. At twenty-one he took quarters in
the Middle Temple, and at twenty-three he was admitted to the bar.
Disliking law, and timid before courts, he fell into a mood of
hypochondria, which was deepened when Theodora’s father forbad e her any
further association with her cousin. Cowper never saw her again, never
forgot her, and never married.</p>
<p>In 1763, faced with the necessity to appear before the House of
Lords, he broke down, became deranged, and tried to kill himself.
Friends sent him to an asylum at St. Albans. After eighteen months he
was released, and took to an almost solitary life at Huntingdon, near
Cambridge; now, he said, he “de -</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>81 1</p>
<p>sired no other communion than with God and Jesus Christ.” 147 He
accepted</p>
<p>This bliss was suddenly ended when the father was killed by a fall
from a horse. The widow and her daughter, taking Cowper with them, moved
to Olney in Buckinghamshire, to be near the famous evangelical preacher
John Newton. He persuaded Cowper to join him in visiting the sick and
writing hymns. One of these “Olney Hymns” contained famous lines:</p>
<p>God moves in a mysterious way</p>
<p>His wonders to perform;</p>
<p>He plants his footsteps in the sea,</p>
<p>And rides upon the storm. 148</p>
<p>But Newton’s hellfire sermons, which had “thrown more than one of his
parishioners off their balance,” intensified rather than allayed the
poet’s theological fears. 149 “God,” said Cowper, “is always formidable
to me but when I see Him disarmed of His sting by having sheathed it in
the body of Christ Jesus.” 150 He proposed to Mrs. Unwin, but a second
attack of in - sanity (1773) prevented the marriage; he recovered after
three years of lov- ing care. In 1779 Newton left Olney, and Cowper’s
piety took a milder turn.</p>
<p>Other women helped Mary Unwin to keep the poet in contact with</p>
<p>earthly things. Lady Austin, widowed but merry, gave up her London
house, moved to Olney, associated with the Unwins, and brought gaiety
where there had been too long a concentration on the occasional
tragedies of life. It was she who told Cowper the story which he turned
into “The Diverting History of John Gilpin” 151 and his wild unwilling
ride. A friend of the family sent the rollicking ballad to a newspaper;
an actor who had succeeded Garrick at the Drury Lane Theatre recited it
there; it became the talk of London, and Cowper had his first taste of
renown. He had never taken himself seriously as a poet; now Lady Austin
urged him to write some substantial work. But on what subject? On
anything, she answered; and, pointing to a sofa, she assigned him the
task of celebrating it in verse. Pleased to be commanded by a charming
woman, Cowper wrote The Task. Pub- lished in 1785, it found welcome
among people who were tired of war and politics and city strife.</p>
<p>It would be a real task to write or read six “books” about a sofa
unless one had the morals of Crebillon fils ; 152 Cowper was sane enough

<p>chairs, he slipped into his favorite subject, which might be summed
up in the poem’s most famous line: “God made the count ry, and man made
the town.” 153 The poet admitted that art and eloquence flourished in
London; he praised Reynolds and Chatham, and marveled at the science
that “meas - ures an atom and now girds the world”; 154 but he
reproached the “queen of cities” f or punishing some small thefts with
death while lavishing honors on “peculators of the public gold.”</p>
<p>Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness.</p>
<p>Some boundless contiguity of shade,</p>
<p>Where rumor of oppression and deceit.</p>
<p>Of unsuccessful or successful war,</p>
<p>Might never reach me more! My ear is pain’d.</p>
<p>My soul is sick, with every day’s report</p>
<p>Of wrong and outrage with which earth is filled. 155</p>
<p>He was horrified by the traffic in slaves; his was one of the first
Englis h voices to denounce the man who</p>
<p>finds his fellow guilty of a skin</p>
<p>Not colored like his own; and having power</p>
<p>To enforce the wrong,…</p>
<p>Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey….</p>
<p>Then what is man? And what man, seeing this,</p>
<p>And having human feelings, does not blush,</p>
<p>And hang his head, to think himself a man ? 156</p>
<p>And yet, he concluded, “England, with all thy faults I love thee
still.” 157 He felt that these faults would be mitigated if England
would return to religion and a rural lif e. “I was a stricken deer that
left the herd”— i.e., he had left London, where “prostitutes elbow us
aside”— and had found healing in faith and nature. Come to the
countryside! See the River Ouse, “slow winding through a level plain”;
the placid cattle, the peasant cottage and its sturdy family, the
village spire pointing grief and hope; hear the splash of waterfalls,
and the morning converse of the birds. In the country every sea- son has
its joy; the spring rains are a blessing, and the winter snow is clean.
How pleasant it is to tramp through the snow and then gather about the
evening fire!</p>
<p>Cowper wrote little of value after The Task. In 1786 he removed
to</p>
<p>nearby Weston Underwood; there he had another half year of insanity.
In 1792 Mrs. Unwin suffered a paralytic stroke; for three years she
lingered as a helpless invalid; Cowper nursed her as she had nursed him,
and in her last month he wrote his lines “To Mary Unwin”:</p>
<p>Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,</p>
<p>Are still more lovely in my sight</p>
<p>Than golden beams of orient light,</p>
<p>My Mary ! 158</p>
<p>In 1794, overcome with care, and with work on his unsuccessful
translation of Homer, he again went mad, and tried to destroy himself.
He recovered,</p>

<p>and was relieved from financial distress by a governmental pension of
£ 300. But on December 17, 1796, Mary Unwin died, and Cowper felt quite
lost and desolate, though he had found a new friend in Theodora’s
sister, Lady Harriet Cowper Hesketh. His final days were obsessed with
religious fears. He died on April 25, 1800, aged sixty-eight.</p>
<p>He belonged to the Romantic movement in literature, and to the evan-
gelical movement in religion. He ended the reign of Pope in poetry, and
pre- pared for Wordsworth; he brought into poetry a naturalness of form
and a sincerity of feeling that stopped the torrent of artificial
couplets which the Augustan Age had let loose upon England. His religion
was a curse to him in its picture of a vengeful God and an unforgiving
hell; yet it may have been religion, as well as maternal instincts, that
led those kindly women to care for this “stricken deer” through all his
griefs and darkenings.</p>

<li>OLIVER GOLDSMITH</li>
</ol>
<p>“Poor Poll” too had his tragedies, but they were not deepened by a
sadistic creed, and were relieved by triumphs in prose and poetry and on
the stage. His father was a humble Anglican curate in an Irish village,
who, by add- ing tillage to theology, earned forty pounds a year. When
Oliver was two years old (1730) the curate was made rector of Kilkenny
West, and the family moved into a house on a main road near Lissoy,
which later renamed itself Auburn in confidence that Goldsmith had had
it in mind when he wrote The Deserted Village.</p>
<p>Oliver went through a succession of elementary schools, and
remembered best a quartermaster turned schoolmaster, who could never
forget his wars, but also told absorbing tales of fairies, banshees, and
ghosts. At the age of nine the boy nearly died of smallpox, which
further disfigured one of the least beautiful faces ever given to a
lovable soul. At fifteen he entered Trin- ity College in Dublin as a
sizar, or working student, wearing a distinguishing costume, performing
menial services, and harassed by a tyrannical tutor. He ran away to
Cork, planning to find passage to America, but his older brother Henry
overtook him and beguiled him back to college. Oliver did well with the
classics, but proved impervious to science; however, he managed to get
his bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>He applied for admission to minor ecclesiastical orders, but
astonished the bishop by appearing in scarlet breeches. Rejected, he
became a tutor, quarreled with his pupil, and again headed for Cork and
America. An uncle intervened by advancing him fifty pounds to go to
London; Oliver lost it all in a gambling house. His relatives were
dismayed by his shiftless incompe- tence, but were charmed by his
gaiety, flute, and songs. A fund was raised to finance his study of
medicine in Edinburgh, then in Leiden. He made some progress, but left
Leiden without a degree. At Paris (he tells us) he attended the chemical
lectures of Rouelle. Then he set out leisurely (17 55), walking through
France, Germany, Switzerland, and north Italy, playing</p>
<p>814 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>his flute at country dances, earning haphazard meals, receiving alms
at mon- astery gates. 159 In January, 1756, he returned to England.</p>
<p>He practiced medicine in London, corrected proofs for Samuel Richard-
son, taught school in Surrey, then settled down in London as a hack
writer, doing odd literary jobs and contributing to magazines. He wrote
in four weeks a Life of Voltaire. In 1759 he persuaded Dodsley to
publish a super- ficial Enquiry into the State of Polite Learning in
Europe. Its comments on theatrical managers gave lasting offense to
Garrick. It argued that ages of creative literature tend to be followed
by ages of criticism, which deduce rules from the practice of creators,
and tend to cramp the style and imagina- tion of new poets. Goldsmith
thought that Europe was in such a state in 1 759 *</p>
<p>A year later he wrote for Newbery’s Public Ledger some “Chinese Let -
ters,” which were republished in 1762 as The Citizen of the World. The
scheme was old: to imagine an Oriental traveler reporting with amusement
and horror the ways of Europeans. So Lien Chi Altangi, in letters to a
friend at home, describes Europe as a disorderly theater of avarice,
ambi- tion, and intrigue. Goldsmith issued the book anonymously, but the
denizens of Fleet Street recognized his style in the simple language,
lively descriptions, and amiable tone. Feeling his fame, he moved to
better quarters at No. 6 Wine Office Court. Having complimented Johnson
in the “Chinese Letters,” he ventured to invite the lexicographer (who
lived just across the way) to supper. Johnson came, and their long
friendship began (May 31, 1761).</p>
<p>One day in October, 1762, Johnson received an urgent message from
Goldsmith, asking for help. He sent a guinea, came shortly afterward,
and found that Goldsmith was about to be arrested for failure to pay his
rent. He asked his friend had he nothing of value to pawn or sell.
Goldsmith gave him a manuscript entitled The Vicar of Wakefield. Johnson
(according to John- son’s account 160 ) bade the landlady wait, brought
the novel to J ohn New- bery, a bookseller, sold it for £ 60, and took
the money to Goldsmith, who paid his rent and celebrated with a bottle
of wine. The bookseller kept the manuscript unpublished for four
years.</p>
<p>In December, 1764, Goldsmith sent forth his first major poem, The
Trav- eller, or A Prospect of Society. He retraced his Continental
wanderings, de- scribed the faults and virtues of each land, and noted
that each country thought itself the best. He gloried in the power of
England (which had just won th e Seven Years’ War), and described the
M.P.S:</p>
<p>Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,</p>
<p>I see the lords of human kind pass by;</p>
<p>but he warned that avarice was tarnishing British rule, that selfish
enclosures were impoverishing the peasantry and dri ving England’s
sturdiest sons to America. He had shown the manuscript to Johnson, who
contributed nine lines, chiefly toward the end, belittling the influence
of politics on the indi - vidual’s happiness, and lauding domestic
joys.</p>
<p>The success of the poem surprised all but Johnson, who helped it by
pro- claiming, “There has not been so fine a poem since Pope’s time” 161
— which</p>

<p>slighted Gray. The publisher made a handsome profit on repeated
editions, but yielded only twenty guineas to the author. Goldsmith moved
to better rooms in the Temple; he bought a new outfit, with purple
breeches, scarlet cloak, a wig, and a cane, and resumed with this
dignity the practice of medi- cine. The experiment did not prosper, and
the success of The Vicar of Wakefield brought him back to
literature.</p>
<p>The bookseller who had bought the manuscript from Johnson felt that
the fresh fame of Goldsmith would carry the strange novel to acceptance.
It appeared in a small edition on March 27, 1766; this was sold out in
two months, and a second edition in three months more; but not till 1774
did the sales repay the publisher’s investment. As early as 1770 Herder
recom - mended it to Goethe, who rated it “one of the best novels ever
written.” 162 Walter Scott agreed. 163 Washington Irving marveled that a
bachelor home- less since his childhood could draw “the most amiable
picture of domestic virtue and all the endearmen ts of the married
state.” 164 Perhaps it was Gold - smith’s exclusion from family life
that made him idealize the home, his un - willing bachelordom that made
him idealize young womanhood, and his anonymous amours that made him
exalt feminine chastity as more precious than life. His fond memories of
his father and his brother furnished the portrait of Dr. Primrose, who,
as “a priest, an husbandman, and the father of a family,… unites in
himself the three greatest characters on earth.” 165 His own wanderings
reappeared in son George, who, like Goldsmith, had ended his travels as
a hack writer in London. The story is incredible and charming.</p>
<p>The proceeds from The Traveller and The Vicar of Wakefield were</p>
<p>soon spent, for Goldsmith was a sieve for currency, and always lived
in the future. He looked with envy upon the fame and fortune that might
come from a successful play. He set his pen to the difficult genre,
called the result The Good-Natured Man, and offered it to Garrick. David
tried to forget the derogatory remarks that Goldsmith had made about
him; he agreed to produce the play. However, it laughed at sentimental
comedies, and these were Garrick’s moneymakers. He proposed changes,
Goldsmith rejected them; Garrick advanced the author forty pounds, but
dallied so long that the reckless author turned the manuscript over to
Garrick’s rival, George Colman, who managed the Covent Garden Theatre.
Colman’s actors dis - paraged the play; Johnson gave it all his support,
attended rehearsals, wrote the prologue. The drama had its premiere on
January 29, 1768; it ran ten nights, and was then withdrawn as only a
moderate success; even so it netted the author £ 500.</p>
<p>Flush for a year, Goldsmith, against Johnson’s advice, moved to a
hand - some apartment in Brick Court, and fitted it so well that he had
to return to hack writing to meet his bills. Now he turned out popular
histories of Rome, Greece, England, and a History of Animated Nature —
all of them poor in scholarship but enriched with gracious prose. When
someone asked why he wrote such books, he answered that they enabled him
to eat, while poetry let him starve. Nevertheless, on May 26, 1770, he
sent forth his masterpiece, The Deserted Village, for which he received
a hundred guineas — a fair price</p>
<p>8 1 6 ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION ( CHAP. XXXII</p>
<p>at that time for a poem only seventeen pages long. It sold out four
editions in three months.</p>
<p>Its theme was the desertion of the countryside by farmers who had
lost their lands through enclosures. It pictured</p>
<p>Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,</p>
<p>Where health and plenty cheered the laboring swain;</p>
<p>it lent all the rosy colors of Goldsmith’s urban imagination to the
peasant prosperity that (he presumed) had preceded the enclosures. He
described the rural scenes, the diverse flowers, “the sheltered cot, the
cultivated farm,”</p>
<p>A man he was to all the country dear,</p>
<p>And passing rich with forty pounds a year-</p>
<p>enough to let him feed the vagrant, save the spendthrift, house the
broken soldier, visit the sick, and comfort the dying.</p>
<p>At church, with meek and unaffected grace,</p>
<p>His looks adorned the venerable place;</p>
<p>Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,</p>
<p>And fools who came to scoff remained to pray.</p>
<p>That schoolmaster who had disciplined the poet’s boyhood was
transformed in r ecollection into a teacher “stern to view”:</p>
<p>Yet he was kind, or if severe in aught,</p>
<p>The love he bore to learning was in fault;…</p>
<p>In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,</p>
<p>For e’en though vanquished he could argue still;…</p>
<p>With words of learned length and thundering sound</p>
<p>Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;</p>
<p>And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,</p>
<p>That one small head could carry all he knew.</p>
<p>This paradise had been ruined, Goldsmith thought, by enclosures; the
peas- ant farm had been turned to pasturage, the peasant families had
fled to the towns or the colonies, and the rural fount of honest virtue
was drying up.</p>
<p>Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</p>
<p>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</p>
<p>Having written the best poem of that generation, Goldsmith now
returned to drama. In 1771 he offered to Colman a new comedy, She Stoops
to Con- quer. Colman dallied as Garrick had done, until Johnson
intervened and almost commanded the manager to stage the play. Garrick,
reconciled, wrote the prologue. After tribulations that almost broke the
author’s spirit, the piece was produced, March 15, 1773. Johnson,
Reynolds, and other friends attended the premiere and led the applause;
Goldsmith himself wandered meanwhile in St. James’s Park, until someone
found him and assured him that his play was a great success. It had a
long run; the benefit nights brought Goldsmith a year of prosperity.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXXIl)</p>
<p>THE LITERARY SCENE</p>
<p>He had now raised himself to a place second only to Johnson among the
English writers of the day, and even to foreign fame. He was a leading
figure in the Club, and dared to differ from Johnson frequently. When
there was talk about animal fables he remarked that it was especially
diffi- cult to make fishes talk like fishes; and “this,” he told
Johnson, “is not so easy as you seem to think; for if you were to make
little fishes talk they would all talk like whales.” 166 The Great Bear
sometimes clawed him cruelly, but loved him none the less, and the
affection was returned despite Gold- smith’s envy of Johnson’s
conversational mastery. He himself had never put his learning in order;
he could not draw on it readily or aptly; he “wrote like an angel,” said
Garrick, “and talked like poor Poll.” 167 Boswell tended to belittle
Goldsmith, but many contemporaries — Reynolds, Burke, Wilkes, Percy —
protested against this as unjust. 168 It was observed that Goldsmith
often spoke well in gatherings where Johnson was not present. 169</p>
<p>His accent, his manners, and his appearance were against him. He had
never lost his Irish brogue. He dressed too carelessly, and sometimes he
sported incongruous polychrome finery. He was vain of his accomplish-
ments, and did not admit Johnson’s superiority to him as a writer. He
was five feet five inches tall, and resented Johnson’s height and bulk.
His good nature shone through his homely face. Reynolds’ portrait did
not idealize him; here were thick lips, a receding forehead, an
advancing nose, and wor- ried eyes. Caricaturists like Henry Bunbury
widened Oliver’s mouth and prolonged his nose; the London Packet
described him as an orangutan; 170 a hundred stories traveled the town
about his blunders of speech and action, and his secret love for pretty
Mary Horneck.</p>
<p>His friends knew that his faults were on the surface, concealing a
spirit of good will, affection, and almost ruinous generosity. Even
Boswell described him as “the most generous -hearted man that exists;
and now that he has had a large supply of gold by his comedy, all the
needy draw upon him.” 171 When he had no more money to give he borrowed
to meet the demands of the poor who applied to him. 172 He appealed to
Garrick (whose forty pounds had not been repaid) to advance him sixty
pounds on the promise of another play; Garrick sent the sum. Goldsmith
owed ,£2,000 at his death. “Was ever poet,” Johnson asked, “so trusted
before?” 173</p>
<p>In 1774, as he was about to leave for one of the several clubs to
which he belonged, he was stricken with fever. He insisted on
prescribing for himself, forgetting Beauclerk’s advice that he should
prescribe only for his enemies; he took a patent medicine, and grew
worse. A doctor was called, too late to save him. He died on April 4,
only forty-five years old. A crowd of mourners gathered about the
corpse, simple men and women who had al- most lived on his charity. He
was buried in the churchyard of the Temple, but his friends insisted
that some memorial to him should be set up in the Abbey. Nollekens
carved the monument, Johnson wrote the epitaph. Better would have been
the poet’s own lines in The Good - Natured Man: “Life at the greatest
and best is but a forward child, that must be humored and coaxed a
little till it falls asleep, and then all the care is over.” 174</p>
