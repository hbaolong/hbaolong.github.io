Arts</h4>
<p>i 6 4 3 - i 7 i 5</p>
<p>I. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARTS</p>
<p>N EVER before or after, excepting perhaps under Pericles, has a gov-
ernment so stimulated, nourished, or dominated art as under Louis</p>
<ol start="14" type="I">
<li>Artes virumqiie cano.</li>
</ol>
<p>Richelieu’s fine taste and judicious purchases had helped the
recovery</p>
<p>The next step was to organize the artists. Here too Mazarin led the
way. In 1648 he founded the Academie de Peinture et de Sculpture; in
1655 this received a charter from the King, and became the first in a
series of acade- mies designed to train artists and direct them into the
service and adorn- ment of the state. Colbert took up where Mazarin left
off, and brought to a head this centralization of French art. Though
himself laying no claim to artistic judgment, he aspired “to make the
arts flourish better in France than anywhere else.” 1 He began by buying
for the King the tapestry works of the Gobelins (1662). In 1664 he
acquired the post of superintendent of buildings, which gave him control
of architecture and its ancillary arts. In that year he reorganized the
Academy of Painting and Sculpture as the Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts.
Henry IV had housed in the Louvre a guild of artisans to adorn the royal
palaces; Colbert made these men the nucleus of the Manufacture Royale
des Meubles de la Couronne — the Royal</p>
<p>8 ?</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap, in</p>
<p>Manufactory of Furniture for the Crown (1667). In 1671 he established
the Academie Royale de 1 ’ Architecture, where artists were induced to
build and decorate in le bon gout approved by the King. In all these
societies the artisans were brought under the direction of artists, and
these under the guidance of one policy and style.</p>
<p>To reinforce the classical bent that French art had received under
Fran- cis I, and cleanse it from Flemish influences, Colbert and Charles
Le Brun set up in Rome the Academie Royale de France (1666). Students
who had won the Prix de Rome in the Paris academies were sent to Italy,
and were maintained there for five years at the expense of the French
government. They were required to rise at five o’clock in the morning
and to retire at</p>
<p>The result of this fostering and nationalization of art was an
impressive, overwhelming production of palaces, churches, statues,
pictures, tapestries, pottery, medallions, engravings, and coins, all
stamped with the pride and taste — often with the features — of Le Roi
Soleil. It was not a subjection of French art to Rome, as some
complained; it was a subjection of Roman art to Louis XIV. The style
aimed to be classical, for that style agreed with the majesty of states
and kings. Colbert poured French money into Italy to buy classical or
Renaissance art. Everything was done to transport the glory of the Roman
emperors to the King and capital of France. The result amazed the
world.</p>
<p>Louis XIV became the greatest patron of art that history has known.
He “gave greater encouragement to the arts” (in the judgmen t of
Voltaire) “than all his fellow kings together.” 2 He was, of course, the
most open - handed collector. He enlarged the number of paintings in his
galleries from two hundred to twenty-five hundred; and many of these
pictures were the product of royal commissions to French artists. He
bought so many pieces of classical or Renaissance sculpture that Italy
feared artistic denudation, and the Pope forbade the further export of
art. Louis engaged men of talent like Girardon or Coysevox to make
copies of statues that he could not buy; and seldom have copies so
rivaled their originals. The palaces, gardens, and parks of Paris,
Versailles, and Marly were peopled with statuary. The surest way to the
King’s favor was to present him with a work of unquesti oned beauty or
established repute; so the city of Arles gave him its famous Venus in
1683. Louis was not stingy; each year, in Voltaire’s estimate, he bought
French art products to the value of 800,000 livres, and made gifts of
them to cities, institutions, and friends, 3 aiming at once to support
the artists and to disseminate a sense of beauty and a feeling for art.
The taste of the King</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>was good, and immensely benefited French art, but it was narrowly
class- ical. When he was shown some paintings by the younger Teniers he
com- manded, “Enlevez - moi ces grotesques! Take away these crudities!”
4 Under his favor artists rose considerably in earnings and social
status. He gave the cue by personally honoring them; and when someone
complained of the patents of nobility that he conferred on the painter
Le Brun and the archi- tect Jules Hardouin- Mansard, he replied, with
some warmth, “I can make twenty dukes or peers in a quarter of an hour,
but it takes centuries to make a Mansard.” 5 Mansard was paid eighty
thousand livres per year; Le Brun reveled in the opulence of his
mansions at Paris, Versailles, and Montmor- ency; Largilliere and Rigaud
received six hundred livres per portrait. “No artist of worth was left
in poverty.” 0</p>
<p>In honoring and rewarding art the provinces emulated the capital, and
nobles followed the lead of the King. The cities developed art schools
of their own — at Rouen, Beauvais, Blois, Orleans, Tours, Lyons, Aix-en-
Provence, Toulouse, Bordeaux. The role of the nobles as patrons
diminished as the state absorbed the available talent, but it continued;
and the trained taste of the most developed aristocracy in Europe
contributed to establish the exquisite style of art productions under
Louis XIV. Men and women bom to privilege and wealth, and reared in good
manners amid handsome surroundings and objects of beauty, acquired
standards and tastes from their elders and their environment; and the
artists had to meet those stand- ards and satisfy those tastes. As
moderation, self-restraint, elegant expression, graceful movement, and
polished form were ideals of the French aristoc- racy in this age, it
demanded these qualities in art; the social structure favored the
classic style. Art profited from these influences and controls, but it
paid a price. It lost touch with the people, it could not express them
as Dutch and Flemish art expressed the Netherlands; it became the voice
not of the nation but of a class, the state, and the King. We shall not
find in the art of this period much warmth or depth of feeling, not the
rich tints and abundant flesh of Rubens, nor the profound shadows
enveloping R embrandt’s rabbis, saints, and financiers; we shall see no
peasants, no workers, no beggars, but only the pretty happiness of the
top of the world.</p>
<p>To the joy of Colbert and his master, they found in Charles Le Brun a
man who could be at once a zealous servant of the government and a
dominating magistrate of this classic style. In 1666, on Colbert’s recom
- mendation, Le Brun was made chief painter to the King, and director of
the Academie des Beaux-Arts; a year later he was put in charge of the
Gobelin factory. He was commissioned to superintend the education and
operation of artists, with a view to developing in their products a
harmony of style distinctive and representative of the reign. With the
help of like- minded subordinates Lc Brun established in the Academy
(1667) the con-</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>feresices, or lectures, by which the principles of the classic style
were inculcated with precepts, examples, and authority. Raphael among
the Ital- ians, Poussin among the French, were the favored models; every
painting was judged by the canons derived from their art. Le Brun and
Sebastien Bourdon formulated these rules; they exalted line above color,
discipline above originality, order above freedom; the task of the
artist was not to copy Nature but to make her beautiful, not to mirror
her disorder, imper- fections, and monstrosities as well as her
incidental loveliness, but to select those features of her that would
enable the soul of man to express its deep- est feelings and highest
ideals. The architects, the painters, the sculptors, the potters, the
woodworkers, the metalworkers, the glassworkers, the en- gravers were to
utter with one harmonious voice the aspirations of France and the
grandeur of the King.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>ARCHITECTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>However, these French artists Italianate had returned from Rome un-
consciously coated with baroque. That now pervasive style has been pre-
viously described; it may be summarized as replacing the calm simplicity
of classic forms with an exuberance of feeling and ornament. While the
classic — more specifically the Hellenistic — ideal was approximated in
the sculpture, painting, and literature of this grand, siecle, the
architecture and decoration borrowed from the elegant and ornate styles
that had triumphed in Italy after the death of Michelangelo (1564). The
King’s builders aimed at the classical and achieved the baroque — at
Versailles the full baroque, in the facades of the Louvre a successful
synthesis of baroque and classical.</p>
<p>The first architectural chef-d’oeuvre of the reign was the Church
of</p>
<p>Val-de-Grace in Paris. Anne of Austria had registered a vow to build
a handsome shrine if God and Louis XIII would give her a son. When her
regency provided her with funds, she engaged Frangois Mansart to draw up
plans. The first stone was laid by Louis XIV, then seven years old,
in</p>
<ol start="1645" type="1">
<li>Mansart’s design was carried out by Lemercier in Italian classic
style, with a dome that is still the admiration of architects. Liberal
Bruant built the Church of St.-Louis-des-Invalides (1670) for the
veterans housed in the Hotel des Invalides; and in 1676 Louvois
commissioned Jules Hardouin- Mansard (grandnephew of Francois Mansart)
to finish the church with a choir and a dome. In elegant beauty that
dome is the architectural master- piece of the reign. Hardouin-Mansard
triumphed again in designing the chapel at Versailles (1699). Here and
at the Invalides his work was com- pleted with luxurious ornament by his
brother-in-law Robert de Cotte, who raised also the Hotel de Ville at
Lyons, the Abbey of St.-Dcnis, and the fagade of St.-Rochc.</li>
</ol>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>TIIE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>9 1</p>
<p>Royal replaced ecclesiastical architecture as the state surpassed the
Church in wealth and prestige. The problem now was to express not devo-
tion but power. In meeting this requirement the Louvre had the advantage
of tradition; many generations had seen it grow, and many kings had
marked its history. Lemercier, working for Mazarin, raised the western
front of the main wing, and began the north wing along the present Rue
de Rivoli. Le Vau, who succeeded him, finished that wing, reconstructed
the fa£ade of the south wing (facing the Seine), and laid the
foundations of the east wing. At this juncture Colbert became
superintendent of build- ings. Rejecting Le Vau’s plans for the east
wing, he conceived the project</p>
<p>Colbert had hoped that the King would move from the cramped quarters
at St.-Germain into the renovated Louvre. But Louis still remembered
that he and his mother had had to flee from the Paris populace during
the Fronde; he thought that the voice of the people was the voice of
violence; and he did not care to subject himself to such checks on his
absolute rule. To the dismay of Colbert he decided to build
Versailles.</p>
<p>Louis XIII had erected there a modest hunting lodge in 1624. Andre Le
Notre saw in the gently rising slope of the site, and its rich
forestation, a tempting chance for garden artistry. In 1662 he presented
to Louis XIV a general plan for the grounds; and if today the buildings
are inferior to the lawns and the lake, the flowers and shrubs and
varied trees, that may be as Le Notre conceived it. It was to be not so
much a masterpiece of architec- ture as an invitation to live outdoors,
amid a nature tamed and improved</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>by art: to breathe the fragrance of flowers and trees, to feast the
eyes and fancied touch on classically sculptured forms, to hunt prey and
women in the woods, to dance and picnic on the grass, to boat on the
canal and the lake, to hear Lully and Moliere under the open sky. Here
was a garden of the gods, built with the pennies of twenty million
Frenchmen who would rarely see it, but who gloried in the glory of their
King. It is pleasant to learn that except on royal occasions the park at
Versailles was open to the public.</p>
<p>The art of landscape gardening, like so much else, had come from
Italy, bringing a hundred devices and surprises; bowers, trellises,
grottoes, caves, grotesques, colored stones, bird houses, statues,
vases, brooks, fountains, waterspouts, even organs played by running
water. Le Notre had already designed the gardens at Vaux for Fouquet;
soon he would design the Jar- dins des Tuileries for the Queen, and the
gardens at St.-Cloud for Madame Henrietta, and the gardens at Chantilly
for Le Grand Conde. At Versailles, from 1662 onward, Louis gave him
carte blanche, and Colbert was appalled at the expense incurred in
transforming a disheveled wilderness into acres of paradise. The King
fell in love with Le Notre, who cared not for money but only for beauty,
and in whom there was no guile. 9 He was the Boileau of gardens,
resolved to turn the “disorder” of nature into order, harmony, and
reasonable, intelligible form. Perhaps he was too insistently classical,
but his creation remains, after three hundred years, one of the meccas
of mankind.</p>
<p>Stil l envious of Fouquet, Louis brought Vaux’s architect, Le Vau, to
en - large the hunting lodge into a royal palace. Jules Hardouin-Mansard
took over the direction in 1670, and..began the vast apartments,
galleries, recep- tion rooms, dance halls, guardrooms, and
administrative offices that are now Versailles. By 1685 there were
thirty-six thousand men and six thousand horses laboring on the
enterprise, sometimes working in night and day shifts. Colbert long ago
had warned the King that such architecture, added to war after war,
would bankrupt the treasury; but in 1679 Louis built another palace at
Marly as an escape from the crowds at Versailles, and in 1687 he added
the Grand Trianon as a retreat for Mme. de Maintenon. He ordered an army
of men, including many of his regular troops, to divert the River Eure
and carry its waters through ninety miles of the “Aqueduct of Maintenon”
to supply the lakes, streams, fountains, and baths of Ver - sailles; in
1688, after huge expenditures, this enterprise was abandoned at the call
of war. All in all, Versailles — buildings, furniture, decoration, gar-
dens, and aqueducts — had by 1690 cost France 200,000,000 francs (00,-
000,000?). 10</p>
<p>Architecturally, Versailles is too complex and haphazard to approach
per- fection. The chapel is brilliant, but such flaunting of decoration
hardly</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>accords with the humility of prayer. Parts of the palace are
beautiful, and the stairways to the gardens are majestic; but the
compulsion laid upon the designers to leave the hunting lodge intact,
merely adding wings and orna- ment, injured the appearance of the whole.
Sometimes the proliferating pile leaves an impression of cold monotony
and labyrinthine repetition — one room after another to a spread of
1,320 frontal feet. The internal ar- rangements seem to have ignored
physiological convenience, and to have presumed upon remarkable
retentive power in noble vesicles. Half a dozen rooms had to be
traversed to reach the goal of desire; no wonder we hear of stairways
and hallways serving in such emergencies. The rooms themselves appear
too small for comfort. Only the Grande Galerie is spacious, extend- ing
320 feet along the garden front. There the decorators deployed all their
skills — hanging Gobelin and Beauvais tapestries, scattering sculpture
along the walls, making every piece of furniture lovingly perfect, and
reflecting all the splendor in those great mirrors that gave the room
its second name, Galerie des Glaces. On the ceiling Le Brun, rising to
the height of his art, painted through five years (1679-84) and
mythological symbols the tri- umphs of the long reign, and unwittingly
its tragedy; for these pictured vic- tories over Spain, Holland, and
Germany were to arouse the Furies against the war-fond King.</p>
<p>Louis lived there, on and off, from 1671, spending part of his time
at Marly, St.-Germain, and Fontainebleau; after 1682 it was his
permanent home. But we do him injustice when we think of Versailles as
his residence and playground; he himself occupied a moderate fraction of
the structure; the rest housed his wife, children, and grandchildren,
his mistresses, the foreign legations, the chief administrators, the
court, and all the servantry required by royalty. Doubtless some part of
the magnificence had a political purpose — to awe the ambassadors, who
were expected to judge from this luxury the resources and power of the
state. They and other visitors were duly impressed, and they spread
through Europe such reports of Versailles’ splendor that it became the
envy and model of a dozen courts and palaces throughout the Continent.
In the aftermath of the reign the great mass seemed to people an
insolent symbol of despotism, a reckless challenge of human pride to
unchanging human fate.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>DECORATION</li>
</ol>
<p>The arts of decoration had never known, even undei the Renaissance
popes, such encouragement and display. Thickly carpeted floors, orna-
mental columns, massive tables and chimneypieces, porcelain vases,
silver candelabra, crystal chandeliers, marble clocks inlaid with gems,
walls</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CIIAP. Ill</p>
<p>paneled or frescoed or hung with pictures or tapestries, cornices
elegantly molded, ceilings coffered or painted — these and a dozen other
forms of art, in Versailles, Fontainebleau, Marly, the Louvre, even in
private palaces, made almost every room a museum of objects charming eye
and soul with the mystery of perfection. From Raphael and his aides —
Giulio Romano, Perino del Vaga, Giovanni da Udine — and the Loggie of
the Vatican, Le Brun and his aides took their palette of gods,
goddesses, Cupids, trophies, emblems, arabesques, garlands of flowers
and leaves, cornucopias of the fruits of the earth, to decorate the
record of the royal triumphs over women and states.</p>
<p>In the style of Louis XIV furniture was lavish and gorgeous; here
classic simplicity yielded to baroque ornament. Chairs were often so
carved, upholstered, and petitpointed as to frighten away all but the
most exquisite bottoms; on the other hand, tables could be heavy and
solid to the point of apparent immobility. Writing tables and
“secretaries” were of an elegance</p>
<p>Tapestry was now specifically a royal art. Not content with
bringing</p>
<p>he Gobelin and Aubusson factories under the King’s control, Colbert
persuaded him also to take over the tapissiers of Beauvais. Tapestries
were still the favored decoration for the walls and screens of palaces
and chateaux, for pageants, tournaments, state ceremonies, and religious
festivals. At Beauvais the Flemish painter Adam van der Meulen designed
an outstanding series, The Conquests of Louis the Great, for which the
artist prepared himself by following the King to the wars, and drawing
or painting on the spot the sites, forts, and villages involved in the
campaigns. The Gobelin factory employed eight hundred artisans, who made
not only tapestry but fine textiles, woodwork, silverwork, metalwork,
and marble marquetry. There, under Le Brun’s direction, were woven the
great</p>
<p>apestries from the cartoons of Raphael’s massive frescoes in the
Stanze of the Vatican. Hardly less renowned were the several series
designed by Le Brun himself: The Elements, The Seasons, The History of
Alexander, The Royal Residences, and The History of the King. The last
group ran</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>o seventeen pieces and took ten years of labor. A superb specimen
still hangs in the Gobelin exhibition rooms — the figures astonishingly
in- dividualized, the details fully visualized, even to the landscape
picture on the wall; all in colored threads patiently woven by subtle
hands under tired eyes. Rarely has so much human industry been devoted
to the adulation of one man. Louis excused himself by explaining to
Colbert that these</p>
<p>apotheoses gave employment and income to dyers and weavers, and
served as impressive gifts in the lubrication of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Under the lavish royal hand all the minor arts rejoiced. Splendid
carpets were made at La Savonnerie near Paris. Fine faience was produced
at Rouen and Moustiers, good majolica at Nevers, soft-paste porcelain at
Rouen and St.-Cloud. Toward the end of the seventeenth century French
craftsmen, prodded by Colbert, learned the Venetian secrets of casting,
rolling, and polishing plate glass; so were made the vast and brilliant
mirrors of the Galerie des Glaces. 12 Goldsmiths like Julien Defontaine
and Vincent Petit were organized by Colbert and Le Brun, were given
lodgings in the Louvre, and made for the King and the rich a thousand
articles in silver or gold — until Louis and the grandees melted down
these ornaments to finance war. Jewels, medals, coins were cut and
engraved in designs that set the pace for all Europe but Italy. Not
since the Renaissance had the art of the medallion reached such
excellence as came now with Antoine Benoist and Jean Mauger. Leaving no
stone uncarved, Colbert founded in 1662 the Academy of Medals a nd
Inscriptions, “in order to render the acts of the King immortal by…
medals struck in his honor” 13 — which was the great minister’s way of
enlisting moneyed vanity behind expensive art. In 1667 the Ecole de
Gravures was established in the Louvre; and the burins of Robert
Nanteuil, Sebastien Le Clerc, Robert Bonnart, and Jean Lepautre
illustrated with meticulous refinement the personalities and events of
the reign. Even miniature painting survived, though fallen from its
medieval estate, in the Livre d’heures presented to the King by his
pensioners in the Invalides. It is the minor arts, above all the rest,
that display the taste and craftsmanship of the great century.</p>

<p>Two pictorial stars of the second magnitude fall into the outer orbit
of this age: Philippe de Champaigne and Eustache Le Sueur. Philippe came
from Brussels at the age of nineteen (1621), shared in decorating the
Palais du Luxembourg, and made not only the full-length Richelieu in the
Louvre, but the bust and profiles of the Cardinal in the London National
Gallery. His sympathetic flair as a portrait painter brought him as
sitters half the leaders</p>

<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>of France in the generation that succeeded Richelieu: Mazarin,
Turenne, Colbert, Lemercier… He had already, before coming to France,
portrayed Jansen and accepted Jansenism; he loved Port-Royal, and made
portraits of Mere Angelique, Robert Arnauld, and Saint-Cyran. For
Port-Royal he painted his greatest picture, Les Religieuses (Louvre) —
Mere Agnes, somber yet sweet, with the artist’s nun daughter Suzanne.
Champaigne’s range was limited, but his art comes warmly to us with its
feeling and sincerity.</p>
<p>A kindred but more orthodox piety made Eustache Le Sueur
uncomfortable in an age whose painting was dominated by his rival Le
Brun and by a pagan mythology dedicated to the deification of a
not-yet-pious King. The two artists studied together under Vouet, worked
together in the same cellar, used the same model, and were alike praised
by Poussin on his visit to Paris. Le Brun followed Poussin to Rome and
imbibed the classical spirit; Le Sueur tied himself to Paris with a
fertile wife, and seldom escaped from poverty. About 1644 he painted
five pictures, describing events in the life of Eros, for the ceiling of
the Cabinet de l’Amour in the palace of his patron Lambert de Thorigny;
and in another room of this Hotel Lambert he executed a major fresco,
Phaeton Asks to Guide the Chariot of the Sun. In 1 645 Le Sueur stumbled
into a duel, killed his man, hid himself in a Carthusian monastery, and
there painted twenty-two pictures from the life of St. Bruno, founder of
the Carthusian order; in these the artist reached his apogee. In 1776
the series was bought from the Carthusian monks for 132,000 livres;
today they occupy a special room in the Louvre. When Le Brun returned
from Italy (1647) he carried everything before him, and Le Sueur fell
back into poverty. He died in 1655, only thirty-eight years old. Charles
Le Brun ruled the arts in Paris and Versailles, because he had the
ability to co-ordinate and direct as well as to conceive and execute.
Son of a sculptor who had painter friends, he grew up in an environment
where he learned to draw as other children learn to write. At fifteen,
with a never- sleeping eye to the main chance, he painted an allegory of
Richelieu’s life and success; the minister leaped to the bait, and
commissioned him to paint some mythological subjects for the
Palais-Cardinal. Taken to Rome by Poussin, he steeped himself in the
mythologies and decorations of Raphael, Giulio Romano, and Pietro da
Cortona. When he reappeared in Paris his style of luscious ornamentation
was fully developed. Here again Fouquet gave Louis a lead by engaging Le
Brun for the palace at Vaux. The bril- liance of the resulting frescoes,
the voluptuous grace of the female figures, the rich detail in cornices
and moldings appealed to Mazarin, Colbert, and the King. By 1660 Le Brun
was painting frescoes from the career of</p>
<p>Alexander for the royal palace at Fontainebleau. Louis, pleased to
recognize his own features under Alexander’s helmet, came daily to watch
the artist at work on The Battle of Arbela and The Family of Darius at
the Feet of Alexander — both now in the Louvre. The King rewarded him
with a royal</p>

<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>portrait inset with diamonds, made him his premier peintre, and gave
him a pension of twelve thousand livres a year.</p>
<p>Le Brun did not slacken his industry. In 1661 fire ruined the
central</p>
<p>gallery of the Louvre. Le Brun designed the restoration, and painted
the ceiling and cornices with scenes from the legends of Apollo; hence
the name Galerie d’Ap ollon. Meanwhile the ambitious artist studied
archi- tecture, sculpture, metalwork, woodwork, tapestry design, and the
diverse arts that were now conscripted to adorn the palaces of the
great. All these arts were fused in his varied skills,. 50 that he
seemed made by fortune to bring the artists of France into unified
action to produce le style Louis Quatorze.</p>
<p>Even before appointing him director of the Academie des Beaux-Arts,
Louis gave him a free hand and purse to decorate Versailles. There he
labored for seventeen years (1664-81), co-ordinating the art work,
design- ing the Ambassador’s Staircase, and himself painting, in the
Halls of War and Peace, and in the Grand Gallery, twenty-seven frescoes
describing the glories of the King from the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659)
to the Treaty of Nijmegen (1679). Amid a profusion of gods and
goddesses, clouds and rivers, horses and chariots, he showed Louis in
war and peace: hurling thunderbolts, crossing the Rhine, besieging
Ghent, but also administering justice and finance, feeding the poor in
famine, establishing hospitals, nourishing art. Individually these
pictures are not masterpieces; the classical basis is overgrown with
baroque profusion of ornament; but taken together they constitute the
most brilliant work done by French painters in this age. The exaltation
of the King offends us as revealing in him a hybris of pride, but such
adulation of princes was in the manner of the time. No wonder Louis,
seeing some paintings by Le Brun near others by Veronese and Poussin,
said to his painter, “Your works sustain themselves well among those of
the great masters; they require only the death of their author to make
them more valued. But we hope they will not soon have that ad- vantage.”
14 Thro ugh all the jealousies with which Le Brun was soon sur- rounded,
the King supported him, as he was supporting the harassed Moliere. It
was characteristic of Louis that when he was in administrative con-
ference and word was brought to him that Le Brun had come to show him
his latest work, The Elevation of the Cross , 15 he excused himself from
the conference to go and examine the painting and express his pleasure;
then he invited all the conferees to come and join him in viewing the
picture. 16 So, in this reign, government and art went hand in hand, and
artists shared rewards and plaudits with generals.</p>
<p>Le Brun’s artistry, though it stemmed from Italian decoration, was
some - thing new; it was a decorative composition in which a dozen arts
were brought together to make one aesthetic whole. When he tried his
hand at</p>
<p>9 8</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>individual canvases he slipped into mediocrity. As the King’s
victories turned into defeats, and his mistresses gave way to priests,
the mood of the reign changed, and the gay ornaments of Le Brun fell out
of place. When Louvois succeeded Colbert as superintendent of buildings,
Le Brun lost his role as master of the arts, though lie remained
president of the Academy. He died in 1 690, a symbol of glory finished
and gone.</p>
<p>Many artists rejoiced to be freed from his authority. Pierre Mignard
in particular had resented that domination. Nine years older than Le
Brun, he had preceded him as a pilgrim coming with palette to Rome; like
Poussin, he so loved the Eternal City that he decided to live there the
rest of his life, and he did remain there for twenty-two years
(1635-57). His portraits so pleased their sitters that at last Pope
Innocent X, who may have resented the face that Velazquez had given him,
sat for Mignard, who interpreted him more amiably. In 1646, aged
thirty-four, Mignard married an Italian beauty; but he had barely
settled down to legitimate parentage when he received a summons from
France to come and serve his King. He went reluctantly. In Paris he
rebelled against accepting directions from Le Brun, refused to join the
Academy, and fretted to see the younger man reaping ribbons and gold.
A’loliere recommended him to Colbert, but the minister was probably
right in preferring Le Brun; Mignard would not rise to the grandiose
scale that the grand siecle required. However, Louis, then twenty,
wanted a fetching portrait of himself with which to lure a bride from
Spain. Mignard obliged, Louis and Marfa Teresa were charmed, and Mignard
became the most successful portrait painter of the age. One after
another he pictured his contemporaries: Mazarin, Colbert, de Retz,
Descartes, La Fontaine, Moliere, Racine, Bossuet, Turenne, Ninon de
Lenclos, Louise de La Valliere, Mmes. de Montespan, de Maintenon, de La
Fayette, de Sevigne; and he did justice to Anne of Austria’s hands,
which were con - sidered the most beautiful in the world. She rewarded
him with a com- mission to decorate the vault of the dome in the Church
of Val-de-Grace; this fresco was his masterpiece, which Moliere
celebrated in a poem. He painted the King many times, most famously in
the equestrian portrait at Versailles, but we find him there at his best
in the lovely portrait of the Duchess of Maine as a Child. After
Colbert’s death Mignard at last</p>
<p>riumphed over Le Brun; he succeeded his rival as court painter in
1690, and was made a member of the Academy by royal decree. Five years
later, still painting and fighting, he died, aged eighty-five.</p>
<p>A dozen other painters labored for the all-absorbing King.

<p>lowed Mignard as the favorite painter of the aristocracy, not only in
France but for a time (1674- 78) in England. He won Lc Brun’s heart with
the splendid portrait of him that now hangs in the Louvre. His rosy
colors and light touch illustrate the transition from the somber decline
of Louis XIV to the gay Regency and Watteau.</p>
<p>Hyacinthe Rigaud was of tougher fiber; he too buttered his bread with
portraits (see his fine Bossitet in the Louvre), but not with flattery.
Though his dominating figure of Louis XIV, rising at the end of the
Grande Galerie of the Louvre, appears at a distance to be a compliment,
we note, at closer range, the hard and swollen features of the King,
standing at the top of power and on the edge of fate (1701). It was the
best-paid, as it is the best-displayed, picture of the time. Louis gave
Rigaud forty thousand francs for it (,ooo?) — perhaps as much as he had
paid for the awesome robes that here adorned his decay.</p>
<ol start="22" type="a">
<li>SCULPTURE</li>
</ol>
<p>The sculptors were less favored and rewarded in this age than the</p>
<p>painters. Yet it was the antique marbles on whose lines Le Brun
wished all arts to be formed, and great sums and talents were spent in
buying or copy- ing such statuary as had survived the collapse of the
classic world. Louis, of course, was not content witli copies. Mindful
of the Roman gardens of Sallust and Hadrian, he engaged a band of able
sculptors to set the park at Versailles alive with statuary. Massive
vases, like Coyscvox’ Vase de la Guerre, were raised in the basin of
Neptune, and on the terrace; the brothers Gaspard and Balthasar de Marsy
carved the great Basin of Bacchus; Jean Baptiste Tuby projected from the
lake the magnificent Chariot of Apollo, with the Sun God symbolizing the
King; and Francois Girardon cut in stone such Bathing Nymphs as
Praxiteles himself might not have scorned to sign.</p>
<p>Girardon looked back across a century to see how Primaticcio and</p>
<p>Goujon had idealized the female form. The fluid grace of Hellenic art
re- turned to him, perhaps in excess; not all our searching has yet
found such perfect females as in his Rape of Proserpine.” But he was
capable of stronger moods. For the Place Vendome he executed the figure
of Louis XIV, now in the Louvre; and for the church of the Sorbonne he
carved a stately tomb of Richelieu. Le Brun warmed to him for falling in
so amiably with the taste and purposes of the Academy. He succeeded Le
Brun as chief sculptor to the King, and presided over the Academy after
the passing of Mignard. Born ten years before Louis, he outlived him by
some months, dying in 1715 at the age of eighty-seven.</p>
<p>IOO</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(chap, ni</p>
<p>Antoine Coysevox was smoother than his name, and as lovable as his
Duchesse de Bourgogne. Born in Lyons, he was carving a place for himself
there as a sculptor when Le Brun called him to help decorate Versailles.
He began by making excellent copies or adaptations of classical
statuary. From an antique marble in the Villa Borghese he cut the Nymph
of the Shell ; from a statue in the Medici Palace at Florence he made a
Crouching Venus — both now in that Fortunatus’ purse of art called the
Louvre. Still in place at Versailles is his Castor and Pollux, from a
group in the Ludovisi Gardens at Rome. Soon he was producing original
works of considerable power. For the park at Versailles he carved large
figures representing the rivers Garonne and Dordogne, and for the
grounds at Marly two similar symbols of the Seine and the Marne. Four
marbles that he made for Marly — Flora, Fame, Hamadryad, and Mercury
Mounted on Pegasus — are now in the Jardins des Tuileries. From his
chisel came much of the</p>
<p>sculptural decoration in the major rooms at Versailles.</p>
<p>He labored eight years there, and fifty-five in the service of the
King. He made twelve statues of him; the best known is the bust in
Versailles. He became in sculpture what Mignard was in painting — the
most popular portraitist in France. Instead of quarreling with his
rivals he carved them in marble or cast them in bronze, usually sparing
both their vanity and their purse. When he was sent fifteen hundred
livres for his bust of Colbert he judged himself overpaid, and returned
seven hundred. 18 He left firm likenesses of Le Brun, Le Notre, Arnauld,
Vauban, Mazarin, and Bossuet; of himself a simple rendering of an
honest, rugged, troubled face; 19 of the Great Conde two busts, one in
the Louvre, the other at Chantilly, of un- compromising veracity and
masculine force. In quite another style is the graceful Duchess of
Burgundy as Diana , 20 and the lovely bust of the same princess in
Versailles. He designed imposing tombs for Mazarin, 21 Colbert, Vauban,
and Le Brun. His works feel the baroque spirit in their dramatic
emotionalism and occasional exaggeration; but at their best they well
express the classical ideal of the King and the court. They are Racine
in marble and bronze.</p>
<p>Around him and Girardon were gathered a sculptural Pleiade: Francois
Anguier and his brother Michel, Philippe Coflier and his son Francois,
Martin Desjardins, Pierre Legros, and Guillaume Coustou, whose Horses of
Marly still leap into the air at the Place de la Concorde.</p>
<p>Aside and afar from all these, and defying the soft idealism of
the</p>
<p>official sculpture, Pierre Puget made his chisel voice the anger and
misery of France. Born at Marseilles (1622), he began his art career as
a wood carver; but he longed to be, like his idol Michelangelo, at once
painter, sculptor, and architect; the supreme artist, he felt, should
have all these arts at his command. Dreaming of the Italian masters, he
walked from</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>IOI</p>
<p>Marseilles to Genoa to Florence to Rome. He worked eagerly under
Pietro da Cortona in decorating the Palazzo Barberini; he absorbed every
echo and vestige of Buonarroti, and envied Bernini’s varied fame.
Returning to Genoa, he executed a St. Sebastian that brought him his
first renown. Fouquet, again the forerunner of Louis XIV in art,
commissioned Puget to carve a Hercules 22 for the Chateau of Vaux. But
Fouquet fell, and Pierre hurried south to brood in poverty at Toulon.
Engaged to cut Atlantes (each a marble Atlas) to support the balcony of
the Hotel de Ville, he modeled the figures on the toiling porters of the
docks, and gave almost a revolutionary cry to their straining muscles
and pain-distorted faces — the oppressed proletariat upholding the
world. This would hardly do at</p>
<p>Versailles.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Colbert, his arms open to every talent, asked him
for</p>
<p>statuary, preferably in a harmless mythological vein. Puget sent him
three pieces now in the Louvre: a pleasant bas-relief of Alexander and
Diogenes, a laborious overdone Perseus and Andromeda, and a violent Milo
of Crotona — the mighty vegetarian struggling to free himself from the
jaws and claws of an unconverted lion. In 1688 Puget visited Paris, but,
finding his proud temper and angry chisel out of tune with the wit and
art of the court, he moved back to Marseilles. There he designed the
Hospice de la Charite and the Halle au Poisson — in France even a fish
market can be a work of art. His greatest sculpture was probably
intended as a commentary on the martial exploits of the King: an
equestrian statue of Alexander, handsome and debonair, dagger in hand,
carelessly trampling under his horse’s feet the victims of war. 23 Puget
escaped the formalism , but also the discipline, of Le Brun and
Versailles; his ambition to rival Bernini, even Michelangelo, led him to
exaggerations of musculature and expression; see the horrible Head of
Medusa in the Louvre -. But all in all he was the most powerful sculptor
of his land and time.</p>
<p>As the great reign neared its end, and defeats brought France to
despera- tion, the royal pride turned toward piety, and art passed from
the lordliness of Versailles to the humility of Coysevox’ Louis XIV
Kneeling in Notre Dame — the King, now seventy-seven, still flaunting
regal robes, yet laying his crown humbly at the Virgin’s feet. In those
final years the outlay for Versailles and Marly was restrained, but the
choir of Notre Dame was restored and beautified. The idolatry of ancient
art was cooled by its own excess; the natural began to encroach upon the
classical; the pagan elan of art was finished by the Revocation of the
Edict of Nantes and the ascendancy of Mme. de Maintenon and Le Tellier
over the King. The new decorative themes stressed religion, not glory;
Louis recognized God.</p>
<p>The history of art under Le Grand Monarque teases us with
difficult</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>THE AGE OF LOUIS XIV</p>
<p>(CHAP. Ill</p>
<p>questions. Was the nationalization of the arts an injury or a boon?
Did the influence of Colbert, Le Brun, and the King divert the
development of France from its native and natural bent into an
enfeebling imitation of an enfeebled Hellenistic “antiquity,” confused
by a baroque elabora tion of ornament? Did these forty years of le style
Louis Quatorze prove that art flourishes better under a monarchy
patronizing it with concentrated wealth, and directing talents into a
harmonious unity? — or under an aristocracy preserving, transmitting,
and cautiously modifying standards of excellence and taste, and precepts
of order and discipline? — or under a democracy opening a career to
every talent, freeing ability from the bondage of tradition, and
compelling it to submit and adjust its products to the judgment of the
people? Would Italy and France be the favored homes of art and beauty
today if they had not been embellished by the means and tastes of the
Church, the nobles, and the kings? Would great art have been possible
without the concentration of wealth?</p>
<p>An ecumenical wisdom would be needed to answer these queries modestly
and fruitfully, and every such answer would have to be hedged and</p>
<p>obscured with distinctions and doubts. Presumably art lost something
in naturalness, initiative, and energy through being protected,
directed, and controlled by a central power. The art of Louis XIV was a
disciplined and academic art, majestic in its orderly splendor and
unsurpassed in its artistic finish; but it was crippled in inventiveness
by authority, and fell short of that alliance with the people which gave
warmth and depth to Gothic art. The harmony of the arts under Louis was
impressive, but it sounded too often the same chord, so that at last it
became the expression not of an age and a nation, but only of an ego and
a court. Wealth is necessary to great art, but wealth is disgraceful and
art is unpleasant when they flourish at the expense of widespread
poverty and debasing superstition; for the beautiful cannot long be
divorced from the good. An aristocracy could be a</p>
<p>beneficent repository and vehicle of manners, standards, and tastes
if means could be found to keep it open to fresh talent, and to prevent
it from being an agent of class privilege and vain luxury. Democracies
too can accumulate wealth and dignify it with the nourishment of
knowledge, letters, charity, and art; their problems lie in the
hostility of immature free- dom to order and discipline, the tardy
development of taste in young societies, and the tendency of unmoored
ability to waste itself in bizarre experiments that mistake originality
for genius and novelty for beauty.</p>
<p>In any case the judgment of Europe’s aristocracies was decidedly
in</p>
<p>favor of French art. The palace architecture, the classic sculpture
and literary style, the baroque decoration of furniture and dress,
spread from France to almost every ruling class in Western Europe, even
into Italy and Spain. The courts of London, Brussels, Cologne, Mainz,
Dresden,</p>
<p>CHAP. Ill)</p>
<p>THE KING AND THE ARTS</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Berlin, Cassel, Heidelberg, Turin, and Madrid looked to Versailles as
theii model of manners and art. French architects were engaged to design
palaces as far east as Moravia; Le Notre laid out gardens at Windsor and
Cassel; Wren and other foreign architects came to Paris for ideas.
French sculptors spread out over Europe, until nearly every prince had
an</p>
<p>equestrian statue like the French King’s. The mythological allegories
of Le Brun appeared in Sweden, Denmark, Spain, and Hampton Court.</p>
<p>Foreign sovereigns begged to sit for Rigaud, or, that failing, for
one of his pupils. A Swedish ruler ordered Beauvais tapestries to
commemorate his victories. Not since the extension of ancient Latin
culture through Western Europe had history seen a cultural conquest so
rapid and complete.</p>
