<p>1 7 I 5~ S 9</p>
<p>I. THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE</p>
<p>“The Jews,” said Rousseau,</p>
<p>afford an astonishing spectacle. The laws of Solon, Numa, and
Lycurgus are dead; those of Moses, much more ancient, continue to live.
Athens, Sparta, and Rome have perished and left no offspring on the
earth. But Zion, destroyed, has not lost her children; they are
preserved, they multiply, they spread through- out the world…. They
mingle with all peoples, yet are not confused with them; they have no
rulers, yet they are always a people…. What must have been the force of
a legislator capable of effecting such marvels! Of all the sys - tems of
legislation now known to us, only this one has undergone all tests, has
always been steadfast. 1</p>
<p>Perhaps the Mosaic Code owed its survival not so much to its inherent
wisdom as to its service in maintaining order and stability in
communities living dangerously amid hostile creeds and alien laws. In
the Dispersion the synagogue had to be both church and government, and
the rabbis held their people together through all vicissitudes by giving
the sanction of a proud religious faith to a code that regulated every
phase of Jewish life. The Penta- teuch became the constitution — the
Talmud became the supreme court — of an invisible state stronger even
than human hate.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism lost some of its religious bases as orthodoxy declined.
An enlightened minority saw the absurdity and cruelty of punishing an
entire people, generation after generation, for the ancient sin of a
handful of indi- viduals collected on his way from Temple to court by an
old priest who re- sented the admiration given to Christ by the great
majority of those who knew of him. Careful readers of the Gospels
remembered that Jesus had always remained loyal to Judaism even while
critical of its pious hypo- crites. Those who had learned some history
were aware that almost every people in Christendom had at one time or
another persecuted heretics, not by one crucifixion but by wholesale
massacre, inquisitions, or pogroms.</p>
<p>Voltaire knew all this. 2 He repeatedly denounced the Christian
persecu- tion of the Jews. His epic Henriade spoke of</p>
<p>Madrid’s and Lisbon’s horrid fires,</p>
<p>The yearly portion of unhappy Jews</p>
<p>By priestly judges doomed to temporal flames</p>
<p>For thinking their forefathers’ faith the best.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>He praised the Jews’ “sober and regular way of life, their abstinenc
e, their toil.” He recognized that European Jews had taken to trade
because, pro - hibited from owning land, they had been “unable to
establish themselves permanently”— securely — “in any country.” 3 Yet
Voltaire became violently anti-Semitic. He had unfortunate dealings with
Jewish financiers. When he went to England he carried letters of
exchange on the London banker Me- dina, who meanwhile went bankrupt
owing Voltaire twenty thousand francs. 4 In Berlin, as we have seen, he
employed Abraham Hirsch to buy de- preciated bonds in Saxony, planning
to import them (illegally, as Hirsch warned him) into Prussia and there
have them redeemed at a sixty-five-per- cent profit. 5 Philosopher and
financier quarreled, went to court, and ended with mutual hate. In his
Essai sur les moeurs Voltaire let himself go; he de- scribed the ancient
Hebrews as “a petty nation, a brigand people, atrocious, abominable,
whose law is the law of savages, and whose history is a tissue of crimes
against human ity.” 6 A Catholic priest protested that this was a ridicu
- lously savage indictment. 7 Isaac Pinto, a learned Portuguese Jew,
published in 1762 Reflections criticizing the anti- Semitic passages in
the article “The Jews” in the Dictionnaire philo sophiq ue; Voltaire
admitted that he had been “wrong to attribute to a whole nation the
vices of some individuals,” and promised to alter the offending passages
in future printings; but this slipped his mind. 8 French writers in
general sided against Voltaire in this matter. 9 Rousseau spoke of the
Jews with understanding sympathy. 10</p>
<p>The Jews in France had no civil rights before the Revolution, but
they developed some thriving communities and influential leaders. One of
these bought a seigniory that included Amiens; he exercised his feudal
right to appoint the canons of the cathedral; the bishop protested; the
Parlement of Paris upheld the Jewish seigneur (1787). The French
government grate- fully acknowledged the help of Jewish financiers in
the wars of the Spanish and Polish successions, and Jews played a large
part in reviving the Compa- gnie des Indes after the collapse of Law’s
venture in 1720. 11 The Jews of Bordeaux were especially prosperous;
their merchants and bankers were known for their integrity and their
liberality; but they prided themselves on their Sephardic descent, and
succeeded in excluding all Ashkenazi Jews from Bordeaux.</p>
<p>There were no professed Jews in eighteenth-century Spain. In the
first years of the Spanish Bourbons some small groups presumed on the
supposed enlightenment of Philip V to resume secret observance of Judaic
worship; many cases were discovered; the Inquisition, between 1700 and
1720, put to death three Jews in Barcelona, five in Cordova,
twenty-three in Toledo, five in Madrid. Enraged by these revelations,
the Inquisition flared up in re- newed activity; in the 868 cases tried
by its tribunals between 1721 and 1727 over eight hundred were for
Judaism, and of those condemned seventy- five were burned. Thereafter
such instances were extremely rare. In the final years of its career,
1780-1820, the Spanish Inquisition tried some five thousand defendants,
of whom only sixteen were accused of Judaism, and ten of these were
foreigners. 12 The laws of Spain continued to exclude from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>631</p>
<p>civic or military office all persons who could not prove their
limpieza — x. he purity of their blood from all tincture of Jewish
ancestry. Reformers com- plained that this requirement denied to the
Spanish army and government the services of many able men; and in 1783
Charles III relaxed these laws. 13</p>
<p>In Portugal the Inquisition burned twenty-seven Jews for refusing to
apostatize from Judaism (17 17). 14 Antonio da Silva, whom Southey rated
the best Portuguese dramatist, came to Lisbon in 1712 from Rio de
janeiro; he and his mother were arrested as Jews in 1726; the mother was
burned, the son abjured and was released; apparently he relapsed, for he
was burned in 1739, aged thirty-five. 15 The Marques de Pombal, among
his many re- forms, ended all legal distinctions between Old and New
(converted) Chris- tians (1774). 16</p>
<p>In Italy Venice led the way in liberating the Jews: in 1772 the Jews
of the republic were declared free and equal with the rest of the
population. Rome lagged; the ghetto there was the worst in Europe. High
fertility, encouraged by the rabbis, increased the poverty and squalor;
at one time ten thousand Jews lived in the space of one square
kilometer. 17 Annually the Tiber over- flowed, covering the ghetto’s
narrow streets and filling the cellars with pesti - lential mud.
Excluded from most trades, the Roman Jews took to tailoring; in 1700
three fourths of their adult males were tailors, 18 setting a custom
that endured till our time. In 1775 Pope Pius VI issued an “Editto sopra
gli Ebrei,” renewing the old disabilities of the Jews and adding new
ones: they</p>
<p>In Austria Maria Theresa felt that piety compelled her to confine the
Jews to certain narrow districts, and to exclude them from crafts,
office, and the ownership of realty. 20 Her son Joseph, touched by the
French Enlighten- ment, proposed to the Council of State in 1781 a
project for “rendering use - ful to society the large class of
Israelites in our hereditary lands” (Aus tria, Hungary, and Bohemia).
They should be encouraged to learn — and, after three years, be required
to use — the national language in all legal, political, or business
affairs. The Jews were “not to be troubled in any way in the exercise of
their ritual or doctrine.” They should be invited to take up agri -
culture, to enter industry and business, to practice the arts — but they
still could not become masters in the guilds, for this required an oath
of Christian belief. All humiliating distinctions, and all constraints
hitherto imposed upon the Jews, were to be abrogated, “as well as all
external marks whatever.”</p>
<p>632</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>dangerously keen. Joseph counseled his Christian subjects to respect
the per- sons and rights of Jews as their fellow men; any insult or
violence offered to a Jew “will be sternly punished,” and there must be
no compulsory conver - sions. Soon the Emperor issued similar edicts for
Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. He appreciated Jewish
contributions to his treasury; he raised several Jews to the nobility,
and employed several as state financiers. 21</p>
<p>But his reforms, reporte d the French envoy at Vienna, “arouse a
universal cry of disapproval;… the great facilities accorded to the Jews
are con- sidered as assuring ruin to the state.” 22 Christian merchants
deplored the new competition, and priests condemned the edicts as
tolerating open heresy. Some rabbis objected to Jewish children
attending state schools, fearing that these would lure Jewish youth from
Judaism. Joseph persisted, and a year before his death he extended the
Patent of Toleration to Galicia; there one town, Brody, had so many Jews
(eighteen thousand) that the Emperor called it the modern Jerusalem. By
the time Joseph died (1790) Vienna had accustomed itself to the new
dispensation, and the ground was prepared for the brilliant
Judaeo-Christian culture of Vienna in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>By and large the Jews fared better in Islam than in Christendom. With
presumably some exaggeration Lady Mary Wortley Montagu described their
condition in the Turkey of 1717:</p>
<p>The Jews… are in incredible power in this country. They have many
privileges above all the natural Turks themselves,… being judged by
their own laws. They have drawn the whole trade of the Empire into their
hands, partly by the firm union among themselves, partly by the idle
temper and want of industry of the Turk. Every pasha has his jew, who is
his homme d’af- faires…. They are the physicians, the stewards, and the
interpreters of all the great men…. There are many of them vastly rich.
23</p>
<p>Quite different was the fate of the few Jews who were found in Russia
—chiefly in the “border provinces” confronting Poland— on the death of
Peter the Great. In 1 742 the Empress Elizabeth Petrovna ordered that
“from our whole Empire… all Jews shall… be immediately deported,…</p>
<p>and shall henceforth under no pretext be admitted into our Empire…
un- less they… accept the Christian religion of the Greek persuasion.”
By 1753 nearly 35,000 Jews had been expelled. 24 Some Russian
businessmen pleaded with the Empress to relax the edict, arguing that
the expulsion had depressed the economy of the provinces by deflecting
trade from these to Poland and Germany; Elizabeth refused to relax.</p>
<p>When Catherine II acceded she wished to let the Jews re-enter, but
felt too insecure on her throne to face the opposition of the clergy.
The first partition of Poland, however, brought the problem to a new
phase: what was to be done with the 27,000 Jews long established in that
part of Poland which Ru ssia had now acquired? Catherine declared (1772)
that “the Jewish communities residing in the cities and territories now
incorporated into the Russian Empire will be left in the enjoyment of
all those liberties which they possess at present.” 25 A large measure
of self-government was allowed to these Polish Jews, and they were made
eligible to municipal office; however,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>hey were forbidden to emigrate from the “Pale of Settlement” (the for
- merly Polish provinces) into the Russian interior. In 1791 the Jews
were permitted to settle in the provinces of Kherson, Taurida, and
Ekaterinoslav, as a means of rapidly populating these recently conquered
regions and mak- ing them easier to defend. Meanwhile the economic
anti-Semitism of most Russian businessmen, and the religious
anti-Semitism of the Russian com- monalty, made life difficult and
dangerous for the Jews in the empire.</p>
<p>In 1766 there were 621,000 Jews in Poland. 26 Protective “privileges”
granted them by previous rulers were ratified by Augustus II and
Augustus III, but these Saxons, busy with two realms and two faiths (not
to mention their mistresses), had little time to counter the racial
hostility of the Polish populace. The government laid extra taxes upon
the Jews, the gentry sought to reduce them to serfdom, and the local
administrators made them pay heavily for protection from mob violence.
The priests denounced the Jews for “stubbornly clinging to irreligion”;
an ecclesi astical synod in 1720 de- manded that the government forbid
“the building of new synagogues and the repair of old ones”; a synod of
1733 repeated the medieval maxim that the only reason for tolerating the
Jews was that they might serve as a “re - minder of the tortures of
Christ, and be an example, by their enslaved and miserable condition, of
the just chastisement inflicted by God upon infi- dels.” 27</p>
<p>In 1716 a converted Hebrew, Serafinovich, published an Exposure of
the Jewish Ceremonies , in which he charged the Jews with using the
blood of Christians for various magical purposes: to smear the doors of
Christians, to mix in the matzoth eaten at Passover, to soak a cloth
containing an incanta- tion designed to protect a house or bring
business success… The Jews challenged Serafinovich to defend his
allegations, and assembled a board of rabbis and bishops to hear him; he
did not appear, but republished his book. 28 Repeatedly the Jews were
accused of killing children to get Christian blood; Polish Jews were
summoned to trial on such charges in 1710, 1724, 1736, 1747, 1748, 1753,
1756, 1759, 1760; in many cases they were tortured, in some cases to
death; some were flayed alive; some died slowly by impale- ment. 29 The
terrorized Jews appealed to Pope Benedict XIV to stop these accusations;
the evidence pro and con was laid before Cardinal Campanelli; after
receiving a report from the papal nuncio in Warsaw, he issued a mem-
orandum to the effect that in none of the cases had guilt been proved.
The Roman tribunal of the Inquisition supported the Cardinal’s
memorandum. The nuncio informed the Polish government (1763) that “the
Holy See, having investigated all the foundations of this aberration —
that the Jews need human blood for the preparation of their unleavened
bread,” had concluded that “there was no evidence whatever testifying to
the correctness of that prejudice.” 30 Pope Innocent IV had made a
similar pronouncement in 1247. The aberration persisted.</p>
<p>Fear of massacre was a frequent element in the life of the Polish
Jew. In 1734, 1750, and 1768 bands of Cossacks and Russian Orthodox
peasants, organized as haidamacks (rioters), ravaged many towns and
villages in the</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>provinces of Kiev, Volhynia, and Podolia, pillaging estates and
slaying Jews. In 1768 the raiders carried a “golden charter” falsely
ascribed to Catherine</p>
<p>In Germany the Jews were relatively safe and prosperous, though they
suffered various disabilities in economic and political life. Special
taxes were levied upon them in most of the principalities. 32 The law
allowed only a limited number of Jews to live in Berlin, but the law was
loosely enforced, and the Berlin community grew in number and wealth;
similar Jewish settle- ments existed in Hamburg and Frankfurt. Over a
thousand Jewish mer- chants attended the Leipzig fair in 1789. 33 German
rulers, even Catholic prince-bishops, employed Jews to manage their
finances or provision their armies. Joseph Oppenheimer (1692?- ! 7 38),
known as “Jew Suss,” served in these and other capacities the Elector
Palatine at Mannheim and Karl Alexander, duke of Wiirttemberg. His skill
and industry enriched him and the Duke, and earned him many enemies.
Accused of malfeasance at the mint, he was exonerated by a board of
investigators, and was raised to mem- bership in the Duke’s Privy
Council, where he soon became the dominant power. He invented new taxes,
established royal monopolies, and apparently accepted bribes — which he
divided with the Duke. 34 When the Duke pro- posed that all church
moneys should be deposited in a central state bank, the Protestant
clergy joined with the nobility in opposition to the Duke and his
minister. On March 3, 1737, the Duke suddenly died; army and civil
leaders arrested Oppenheimer and all Stuttgart Jews. Oppenheimer was
tried and convicted; on February 3, 1738, he was strangled, and his
corpse was sus- pended in a cage in a public square. 35</p>
<p>We have noted Goethe’s sallies into the Judengasse in Frankfurt. One
of the oldest families there took its later name, Rothschild, from the
red shield that distinguished its dwelling. In 17 55, on the death of
his parents, Meyer Amschel of the Rot Schild became head of the family
at the age of eleven. The numerous states of Germany, each with its
independent coinage, made money changing a frequent necessity for
travelers; Meyer learned in his boy- hood the interstate monetary
equivalents, and earned a small fee for each ex- change. As a side
interest he studied numismatics and collected rare coins; he guided
another collector, Prince Wilhelm of Hanau, and secured from him the
title of “crown agent,” which helped him in his Frank furt business. He
married in 1770, and thereafter begot five sons, who later developed
branches of the Rothschild firm in Vienna, Naples, Paris, and London.
Meyer earned a reputation for judgment, integrity, and reliability. When
Wilhelm of Hanau succeeded his father as landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, more
court busi- ness came to Meyer Amschel, so that by 1790 he had a yearly
income of three thousand gulden — six hundred more than that of Goethe’s
prosperous father. 36 The family wealth grew rapidly during the French
Revolutionary Wars; Meyer engaged in provisioning armies, and was
entrusted with the concealment, sometimes the investment, of princely
fortunes.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>635</p>
<p>The Jews continued to enjoy a relative freedom in the Netherlands and
Scandinavia. The Amsterdam congregation flourished. In Denmark ghettos
were unknown; the Jews moved about freely, and mixed marriages were al-
lowed. Altona, a commercial city across the Elbe from Hamburg but then
belonging to Denmark, had one of the most prosperous Jewish communities
in Europe. In Sweden Gustavus III protected the Jews in the peaceful
prac- tice of their religion.</p>
<p>Many Jews, fleeing from persecution in Poland or Bohemia, found
refuge in England. Their number there rose from 6,000 in 1734 to 26,000
in 1800, of whom London had 20,000. Their poverty was extreme, but they
took care of their own poor, and maintained their own hospitals. 87
Jew-baiting was a popular sport; it declined when the Jews took up
boxing and one of their number became the national pugilistic champion.
38 The requirement of a Christian oath excluded Jews from civil or
military office. Sampson Gid- eon, having accepted conversion, became
one of the governors of the Bank of England. In 1745, when the Young
Pretender was advancing upon Lon- don with a Scottish army pledged to
depose George II and restore the Stuarts, and the public, losing
confidence in the security of the government, fell into panic and
threatened a run on the bank, Gideon led the Jewish merchants and
magnates to the rescue; they poured their private funds into the bank,
and bound themselves to accept the notes of the bank at face value in
their commercial transactions; the bank met its obligations, confidence
was restored, the Pretender was repulsed. 39</p>
<p>The Whig ministry expressed its appreciation by introducing into
Parlia- ment (1753) a bill offering naturalization and citizenship to
all foreign-born Jews who had resided in England or Ireland for three
years. (Jews born there were naturalized by birth. 40 ) The lords and
the bishops approved the bill; the Commons passed it ninety-six to
fifty-five. But the British public, which knew, or understood, little of
the role which the Jews had played in saving the bank, rose
overwhelmingly against the measure. Protests came to Parliament from
almost every town in Britain; pulpits and taverns united in their
condemnation; merchants complained that Jewish commercial competi- tion
would become intolerable; the bishops who had voted for the bill were
insulted in the streets; old legends of ritual murder of Christians by
Jews were revived; hundreds of hostile pamphlets, ballads, caricatures,
and lam- poons were circulated; women decorated their dresses and bosoms
with crosses, and wore ribands bearing the motto “No Jews, Christianity
For - ever.” 41 The Whig leaders, fearing defeat in the coming election,
secured repeal of the law ( 1 7 54).</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE MYSTIC SOLACE</li>
</ol>
<p>From their earthly sufferings many Jews, especially in Poland,
retreated into supernatural consolations. Some ruined their eyes
studying the Talmud; some lost their wits in the Cabala; some

<p>abandoned Talmudic Judaism for heretical hopes and rites. Jankiew
Leibo- wicz, who came to be known by the name the Turks gave him, Jacob
Frank, persuaded hundreds of Polish Jews to accept him as a
reincarnation of Zevi; he taught them a doctrine akin to the amiable
Christian heresy that conceived the Trinity as composed of God the
Father, Mary the Mother, and the Mes- siah their Son; finally he led his
followers into the Catholic Church (1759).</p>
<p>The lowly state of Polish Judaism was in some measure redeemed by the
Hasidic movement. The founder of this “doctrine of piety” was Israel ben
Eliezer, known as Baal Shem- Tob (“Master of the Good Name”), and, for
short, from his initials, Besht. He wandered from place to place as a
teacher of children; he lived in cheerful poverty, prayed rapturously,
and made “miraculous” cures with mountain herbs. He asked his followers
to pay less attention to synagogue rites and Talmudic lore, to approach
God di- rectly in humble but intimate communion, to see and love God in
all forms and manifestations of nature, in rocks and trees as well as in
good fortune and pain; he bade them enjoy life in the present instead of
mourning the sins and miseries of the past. Sometimes his simple sayings
resembled those of Christ. “A father complained to the Besht that his
son had forsaken God, and asked, Rabbi, wh at shall I do? The Besht
answered, ‘Love him more than ever.’” 42</p>
<p>In some ways the Hasidic movement in Poland corresponded to the Mo-
ravian Brethren, the German Pietists, and the English Methodists; it
agreed with these in bringing religion out of the temple and into the
heart; but it rejected asceticism and gloom, and bade its adherents
dance, enjoy the em- braces of their spouses, and even, now and then,
drink to the brim of ecstasy.</p>
<p>When Baal Shem-Tob died (1760) his flock was shepherded, and some-
times fleeced, 43 by a succession of Zaddikim (“Righteous Men”).
Orthodox Talmudists, led by the scholarly but fanatical Elijah ben
Solomon of Wilna, fought the Hasidim with exhortations and
excommunications, but their num- ber increased as Poland died (1772-92),
and by the end of the century they claimed 100,000 souls. 44</p>
<p>A life so harassed on earth, and souls so fixed in heaven, could not
con- tribute much to secular literature, science, or philosophy. Almost
every- where the Jews were excluded from the universities by the oath of
Christian faith required of all students. Their Mosaic Code barred them
from the prac- tice of pictorial art, and dulled their appreciation.
Writing in a Hebrew understood only by a small minority, or in a Yiddish
which had not yet be- come a literary language, they had little stimulus
to produce any literature beyond religious commentaries or popular
trivialities. One memorable con- tribution they made to practical arts
in this fallow age: Jacob Rodrigue Pereire of Bordeaux invented a sign
language for the deaf and dumb, earn- ing the praise of Diderot,
d’Alembert, Rousseau, and Buffon. And one Jew - ish poet illuminated the
gloom.</p>
<p>Moses Chayim Luzzatto was born in Italy (1707), of parents rich
enough to give him a good education. He derived from the Latin poets,
and from</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV ) THE JEWS 637</p>
<p>Italian poets like Guarini, such skill in poetic meters that he was
able to give to his Hebrew verse a fluent ryhthm and delicate charm
hardly known in that language since Jehuda Halevy. In his seventeenth
year he composed a drama on Samson and the Philistines. Then he took to
studying the Zohar, Bible of the Cabala; his imagination was caught by
its mystic fancies; he turned some of them into poetry, and they turned
his head with the notion that he was divinely inspired. He wrote a
second Zohar, and announced that he was the Messiah promised to the
Jews. The rabbis of Venice excommuni- cated him (1734); he fled to
Frankfurt-am-Main, where the rabbis made him promise to renounce his
messianic illusions; he moved to Amsterdam, where the Jewish community
welcomed him; he supported himself, like Spinoza, by polishing lenses;
and he resumed his cabalistic studies. In 1743 he com- posed a Hebrew
drama, La-Yesharim Tehilla ( Glory to the Virtuous ), which, despite the
abstractions used as dramatis personae , earned lauds from those
competent to judge. Popular Ignorance, maintained by Craft and De- ceit,
generates Folly, which repeatedly frustrates Wisdom, and deprives Merit
of its crown, until Reason and Patience at last overcome Deceit by
revealing Truth; however, by Truth Luzzatto meant the Cabala. In 1744 he
went to Palestine, hoping to be acclaimed as the Messiah, but he died at
Acre of plague (1747), aged thirty-nine. He was the last eloquent voice
of Judaic medievalism, just as</p>

<li>MOSES MENDELSSOHN</li>
</ol>
<p>was the first major voice of a Judaism emerging from protective
isolation into contact with modern thought.</p>
<p>Friend and opponent of Kant, friend and inspirer of Lessing, the
grand- father of Felix Mendelssohn was one of the noblest figures of the
eighteenth century. His father, Menahem Mendel, was a clerk and teacher
in a Jewish school at Dessau. Born there on September 6, 1729, the
“third Moses” grew up with such a passion for study that he suffered a
lasting curvature of the spine. At fourteen he was sent to Berlin for
further study of the Talmud; there he followed almos t literally the
Talmudic command “Eat bread with salt, drink water by measure, sleep on
the hard earth, live a life of privations, and busy thyself with the
Law.” 45 For seven years he contented himself with a garret room, marked
his weekly loaf of bread with lines for his daily allow- ance, 46 and
earned a pittance by copying documents in his elegant hand. In Berlin he
pored over the works of Maimonides, found courage in the career of that
“second Moses,” and learned from him and life to control his pride to
modesty and cool his hot temper to gentleness and courtesy. His Berlin
associates taught him Latin, mathematics, and logic; he read Locke in a
Latin translation, passed on to Leibniz and Wolff, and was soon enamored
of phi- losophy. He learned to write German with a smooth clarity rare
in the litera- ture of his country in his time.</p>
<p>His poverty ended when, aged twenty-one, he became tutor in the

<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>of Isaac Bernhard, who owned a silk plant in Berlin. Four years later
he was made bookkeeper, then a traveling agent of the firm, finally a
partner. He kept this business relation actively to the end of his life,
for he was resolved not to be dependent upon the popularity and monetary
returns of his books. Probably in 1754 he met Lessing, apparently in a
game of chess; so began a friendship that endured, despite philosophical
differences, till Lessing’s death. On October 16, 1754, Lessing wrote to
another friend: “Mendelssohn is a man of five-and-twenty, who, without
any [universityl education, has ac- quired great attainments in
languages, mathematics, philosophy, and poetry. I foresee in him an
honor to our nation if he is allowed to come to maturity by his
co-religionists…. His candor and his philosophical spirit cause me to
regard him, in anticipation, as a second Spinoza.” 47 For his part
Mendels - sohn said that a friendly word or look from Lessing banished
from his mind all grief or gloom. 48</p>
<p>In 1755 Lessing arranged the publication of Mendelssohn’s
Philosophische Gesprdche, which expounded and defended both Spinoza and
Leibniz. In the same year the two friends collaborated in an essay, Pope
ein Meta- physiker!, in which they argued that the English poet had had
no philosophy of his own, but had merely versified Liebniz. Also in 1755
Mendelssohn pub- lished Brief e iiber die Empfindungen ( Letters on the
Feelings) ; this antici- pated Kant ’s view that the sense of beauty is
quite independent of desire. These publications won the young Jew full
welcome into the not quite “serene brotherhood of philosophes” in
Berlin. Through Lessing he met Friedrich Nikolai; he and Nikolai studied
Greek together, and soon he was reading Plato in the original. He helped
Nikolai to establish the Bibliothek der Schonen Wissenschaften und der
Freien Kiinste ( Library of Belles- Lettres and Fine Arts), and
contributed to this and other periodicals articles that strongly
influenced current ideas in the criticism of literature and art.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn now felt sufficiently secure to set up a home of his own.
In 1762, thirty-three years old, he married Fromet Gugenheim,
twenty-five. Both had reached the age of reason, and the union brought
them much hap- piness. On their honeymoon he began work in competition
for a prize of- fered by the Berlin Academy for the best essay on
“Whether the Metaphysi - cal Sciences Are Susceptible of Su ch Evidence
as the Mathematical.” Among other contestants was Immanuel Kant.
Mendelssohn’s contribution won (1763), bringing him fifty ducats and
international renown.</p>
<p>One of the contestants was Thomas Abt, a professor in Frankfurt-am-
Oder. In a long correspondence with Mendelssohn he expressed doubts as
to the immortality of the soul, and mourned that the loss of that belief
might undermine the moral code and deprive misfortune of its last
consolation. Partly as a result of this exchange, Mendelssohn composed
his most famous work: Phaidon, oder Vber die Unsterblichkeit der Seele.
Like its Platonic exemplar, it was cast in dialogue form and popular
style. The soul of man (ran the argument) is clearly different from
matter; we may therefore be- lieve that it does not share the body’s
fate; and if we believe in God we can</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>639</p>
<p>without basis in truth. Moreover [as Kant was to hold] the soul has a
na- tural drive toward self-perfection; this cannot be attained in our
lifetime; God must surely allow the soul to survive the death of the
body. “Without God, Providence, and immorta lity,” Mendelssohn felt,
“all the goods of life would lose their worth in my eyes, and our
earthly life would be… like wandering in wind and weather without the
consoling prospect of finding cover and protection at night.” 49 The
demonstrations wer e fragile, but the style of the work delighted many
readers; the charm of Plato’s dialogues seemed to have been recaptured;
indeed, “the German Plato” became an - other name for Mendelssohn. The
little book ran through fifteen editions, and was translated into nearly
all European languages as well as Hebrew; it was, in its time, the most
widely read nonfiction book in Germany. Herder and Goethe joined in its
praise. Lavater visited the author, examined his head and face, and
announced that every bump and line revealed the soul of Soc- rates.
50</p>
<p>Christians of diverse sects applauded the eloquent Jew, and two
Benedic- tine friars asked for his spiritual counsel. But in 1769
Lavater, who was as ardent a theologian as he was a phrenologist, caused
a flurry by making a public appeal to Mendelssohn to become a Christian.
Mendelssohn replied in Schreiben an den Herrn Diaconus Lavater (1770).
He admitted defects in Judaism and Jewish life, but pointed out that
such abuses develop in every religion in the course of its history; he
asked Lavater to consider the hard- ships suffered by the Jews in
Christendom, and added: “He who knows the state in which we now are, and
has a humane heart, will understand more than I can express”; and he
concluded: “Of t he essentials of my faith I am so firmly… assured that
I call God to witness that I will adhere to my fundamental creed as long
as my soul does not assume another nature.” 51 Lavater was moved, and
humbly apologized for having issued his appeal. 52 But a swarm of
pamphleteers denounced Mendelssohn as an infidel, and some orthodox Jews
condemned him for admitting that abuses had crept into Jew- ish
religious usages. 53 For a time the controversy generated more
discussion than national politics or the decline of Frederick’s
health.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn’s own health suffered from the turmoil; for several
months in 1771 he had to refrain from all mental activity. On recovering
his strength he devoted more of his time than before to the relief of
his co-religionists. When some cantons in Switzerland were preparing
further restrictions against the Jews he asked Lavater to interfere;
Lavater did, with good ef- fect. When the Dresden authorities planned to
expel several hundred Jews Mendelssohn used his friendship with a local
official to secure an accom- modation. 54 He began in 1778 to publish
his German translation of the Pentateuch; issued in 1783, this aroused
another storm. To write some of the commentaries on the text Mendelssohn
had engaged Herz Homberg, who was associated with Berlin Jews quite
estranged from the synagogue. Several rabbis banned the translation, but
it found its way into the Jewish communities; young Jews learned German
from it, and the next generation of Jews moved into active participation
in German intellectual life. Mean-</p>
<p>&lt;&gt; 4 ° ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION (CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>while (1779) Lessing published his drama Nathan der Weise, which hun-
dreds of readers interpreted as an exaltation of his Jewish friend.</p>
<p>Now at the height of his fame and influence Mendelssohn persuaded
Marcus Herz to translate into German that Vindication of the Jews which
Manasseh ben Israel had addressed to the English people in 1656. To the
translation he added a preface on “The Salvation of the Jews” (1782), in
which he pleaded with the rabbis to abandon their right of excommunica-
tion. He followed this in 1783 with an eloquent work called Jerusalem,
oder Vber religiose Macht und Judenthum. {On Religious Authority and
Juda- ism), in which he reaffirmed his Judaic faith, called upon the
Jews to come out of the ghetto and take their part in Western culture,
urged the separa- tion of church and state, condemned any compulsion of
belief, and proposed that states be judged by the degree in which they
relied on persuasion rather than force. Kant, now too at his zenith,
wrote to the author a letter that de- serves a place in the annals of
friendship:</p>
<p>I consider this book the herald of a great reform, which will affect
not alone your people but also others. You have succeeded in combining
your religion with such a degree of freedom of conscience as was never
imagined possi- ble…. You have, at the same time, so clearly and
thoroughly demonstrated the necessity of unlimited freedom of conscience
in every religion, that ulti- mately our [Lutheran] Church will also be
led to consider how to remove from its midst everything that disturbs or
oppresses conscience. 55</p>
<p>The book was attacked by orthodox leaders Christian or Jewish, but it
con- tributed immensely to the liberation and Westernization of the
Jews.</p>
<p>In 1783 Mendelssohn was only fifty-four, but he had always been frail
in physique and health, and he felt that he had not much longer to live.
In his final years he delivered to his children and some friends
lectures defining his religious creed; these were published in 1785 as
Morgenstunden, oder Vor- lesungen iiber das Dasein Gottes {Morning
Hours, or Lectures on the Exist- ence of God). In his last year he was
shocked to learn, from a book by Jacobi, that his dear friend Lessing,
now dead, had long adhered to Spinoza’s pantheism. He could not believe
it. He wrote a passionate defense of Lessing — An die Freunde Lessings.
While taking the manuscript to the publishers he caught a cold; and in
the course of that sickness he died of an apoplectic stroke, January 4,
1786. Christians joined with Jews in erecting a statue to him in Dessau,
the city of his birth.</p>
<p>He was one of the most influential figures of his generation.
Inspired by his writings and his successful crossing of religious
frontiers, young Jews came out of the ghetto, and soon made their mark
in literature, science, and philosophy. Marcus Herz went to the
University of Konigsberg as a medical student; he took several of Kant’s
courses, and became the great episte - molog’s assistant and friend; it
was he who, reading the Critique of P ure Reason in manuscript, stopped
halfway for fear that if he continued he would go insane. Back in
Berlin, he developed a large practice as a physician, and gave lectures
in physics and philosophy to audiences of Christians and Jews. His wife,
Henrietta, beautiful and accomplished, opened a salon which,</p>
<p>CHAP. XXV)</p>
<p>THE JEWS</p>
<p>641</p>
<p>at the turn of the century, was a leading rendezvous of intellectual
Berlin; there came Wilhelm von Humboldt, Schleiermacher, Friedrich
Schlegel, Mirabeau fils… The resultant mixture of ideas might not have
pleased Mendelssohn. Several of his children became converts to
Christianity. Two of his daughters joined Henrietta Herz and others in a
“Tugenbund,” or Band of Virtue, which honored “elective affinities”
above marital fidelity. Henrietta carried on a liaison with
Schleiermacher; Dorothea Mendelssohn left her husband to be the mistress
and then loyal wife of Friedrich Schlegel, and ended as a Roman
Catholic; Henrietta Mendelssohn also accepted the Roman creed; and
Abraham Mendelssohn caused his children, including Felix, to be baptized
as Lutherans; the orthodox rabbis claimed that their fears had been
justified. These were incidental results of the new freedom; the more
lasting aspe cts of Mendelssohn’s influence appeared in the intellec -
tual, social, and political liberation of the Jews.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>TOWARD FREEDOM</li>
</ol>
<p>Intellectually, the liberation took at this time the form of the
Haskalah — a word which meant wisdom, but which came in this context to
signify the Jewish Enlightenment, the revolt of a rising number of Jews
against rabbini - cal and Talmudic domination, and their resolve to
enter actively into the stream of modern thought. These rebels learned
German, and some of them, especially in the families of merchants or
financiers, learned French; they read German freethinkers like Lessing,
Kant, Wieland, Herder, Schiller, and Goethe, and many of them delved
into Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Helve- tius, and d’Holbach. A divis
ion arose between liberal Jews, eager for mod- ernity, and conservative
Jews who felt that devotion to the Talmud and the synagogue was the only
way to preserve the religious, ethnical, and ethical integrity of the
Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Haskalah movement spread from Germany southward into Galicia and
Austria, eastward into Bohemia, Poland, and Russia. In Austria it was
accelerated by Joseph II’s Toleranzpatent, which invited the Jews to
enter</p>
<p>Intellectual and economic developments promoted Jewish emancipation.
Catholic scholars like Richard Simon made rabbinical learning known to
Christian students of the Bible, and the Protestant theologian Jacques
Bas- nage wrote a friendly History of the Religion of the Jews (1707).
The</p>
<p>642</p>
<p>ROUSSEAU AND REVOLUTION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XXV</p>
<p>growth of commerce and finance brought Christians and Jews into
contacts that sometimes stimulated, but often reduced, racial hostility.
Jewish finan- ciers played helpful and patriotic roles in several
governments.</p>
<p>Christian voices now rose to propose an end to religious persecution.
In 1781 Christian Wilhelm Dohm, a friend of Mendelssohn, published at
his suggestion the epochal tract Vber die biirgerliche Verbesserung der
Juden in Deutschland (On the Civil Betterment of the Jews in Germany ).
The occasion for it was a plea sent to Mendelssohn by Alsatian Jews,
asking him to formulate a protest against their disabilities. Dohm
undertook the task, and enlarged it into a general appeal for Jewish
liberation. He described in impressive detail the handicaps suffered by
the Hebrews in Europe, and pointed out what a loss it was to Western
civilization that it made so little use of the intellectual gifts of the
Jews. “These principles of exclusion, equally opposed to humanity and
politics, bear the stamp of the Dark Ages, and are unworthy of the
enlightenment of our times.” 56 Dohm proposed that the Jews be admitted
to full freedom of worship, to educational institutions, to all
occupations, and to all civil rights except, for the present,
eligibility to office, for which they were not yet prepared.</p>
<p>His treatise aroused comment in many countries. Some opponents
charged him with having sold his pen to the Jews, but several Protestant
clergymen came to his defense. Johannes von Muller, the Swiss historian,
supported him, and asked that the works of Maimonides be translated into
German or French. The Toleration Patent of 1782 in Austria and the
political emanci- pation of the Jews in the United States (1783) gave
impetus to the liberation movement. The French government responded
meagerly by removing (1784) personal taxes that had burdened the Jews.
The Marquis de Mira- beau shared with Malesherbes in securing this
relief; and his son, the Comte de Mirabeau, helped with his essay On
Mendelssohn and the Political Re- form of the Jews (1787). The Abbe
Henri Gregoire advanced the matter with a prize-winning essay, Sur la
regeneration physique, morale, et politique des Juifs (1789).</p>
<p>Final political emancipation came only with the Revolution. The
Declara- tion of the Rights of Man proclaimed by the National Assembly
(August 27,</p>

<li>implied it, and on September 27, 1791, the Constituent Assembly
voted full civil rights to all the Jews of France. The armies of the
Revolu- tion or of Napoleon brought freedom to the Jews of Holland in
1796, of Venice in 1797, of Mainz in 1798, of Rome in 1810, of Frankfurt
in 1811. For the Jews the Middle Ages had at last come to an end.</li>
