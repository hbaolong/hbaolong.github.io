<p>Persia</p>
<p>I. THE RISE AND FALL OF THE MEDES</p>
<p>Their origins — Rulers — The blood treaty of Sardis —
Degeneration</p>
<p>W HO were the Medes that had played so vital a role in the destruc-
tion of Assyria? Their origin, of course, eludes us; history is a</p>
<p>book that one must begin in the middle. The first mention we have of
them is on a tablet recording the expedition of Shalmaneser III into a
country called Parsua, in the mountains of Kurdistan (837 b.c.); there,
it seems, twenty-seven chieftain-kings ruled over twenty-seven states
thinly popu- lated by a people called Amadai, Madai, Medes. As
Indo-Europeans they had probably come into western Asia about a thousand
years before Christ, from the shores of the Caspian Sea. The
Zend-Avesta, sacred scriptures of the Persians, idealized the racial
memory of this ancient home-land, and described it as a paradise: the
scenes of our youth, like the past, are always beautiful if we do not
have to live in them again. The Medes appear to have wandered through
the region of Bokhara and Samarkand, and to have migrated farther and
farther south, at last reach- ing Persia. 1 They found copper, iron,
lead, gold and silver, marble and precious stones, in the mountains in
which they made their new home;* and being a simple and vigorous people
they developed a prosperous agri- culture on the plains and the slopes
of the hills.</p>
<p>At Ecbatana* — i.e., “a meeting - place of many ways”— in a
picturesque valley made fertile by the melting snows of the highlands,
their first king, Deioces, founded their first capital, adorning and
dominating it with a royal palace spread over an area two-thirds of a
mile square. According to an uncorroborated passage in Herodotus,
Deioces achieved power by acquiring a reputation for justice, and having
achieved power, became a despot. He issued regulations “that no man
should be admitted to the King’s presence, but every one should consult
him by means of messen - gers; and moreover, that it should be accounted
indecency for any one</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the modem Hamadan.</li>
</ul>
<p>350</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>to laugh or spit before him. He established such ceremony about his
person for this reason, . . . that he might appear to be of a
different</p>
<p>nature to them who did not see him.”’ Un der his leadership the
Medes, strengthened by their natural and frugal life, and hardened by
custom and environment to the necessities of war, became a threat to the
power of Assyria — which repeatedly invaded Media, thought it most
instructively defeated, and found it in fact never tired of fighting for
its liberty. The greatest of the Median kings, Cyaxares, settled the
matter by destroying Nineveh. Inspired by this victory, his army swept
through western Asia to the very gates of Sardis, only to be turned back
by an eclipse of the sun. The opposing leaders, frightened by this
apparent warning from the skies, signed a treaty of peace, and sealed it
by drinking each other’s blood . 4 In the next year Cyaxares died,
having in the course of one reign expanded his kingdom from a subject
province into an empire embracing Assyria, Media and Persia. Within a
generation after his death this</p>
<p>empire came to an end.</p>
<p>Its tenure was too brief to permit of any substantial contribution
to</p>
<p>civilization, except in so far as it prepared for the culture of
Persia. To Persia the Medes gave their Aryan language, their alphabet of
thirty-six characters, their replacement of clay with parchment and pen
as writing materials,’ their extensive use of the column in
architecture, their moral code of conscientious husbandry in time of
peace and limitless bravery in time of war, their Zoroastrian religion
of Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman, their patriarchal family and polygamous
marriage, and a body of law sufficiently like that of the later empire
to be united with it in the famous phrase of Daniel about “the law of
the Medes and the Persians, which altereth not.”’ Of their literature
and their art not a stone or a letter</p>
<p>remains.</p>
<p>Their degeneration was even more rapid than their rise. Astyages,</p>
<p>who succeeded his father Cyaxares, proved again that monarchy is a
gamble, in whose royal succession great wits and madness are near
allied. He inherited the kingdom with equanimity, and settled down to
enjoy it. Under his example the nation forgot its stern morals and stoic
ways; wealth had come too suddenly to be wisely used. The upper classes
became the slaves of fashion and luxury, the men wore embroidered
trousers, the women covered themselves with cosmetics and jewelry, the
very horses were often caparisoned in gold.’ These once simple and
pastoral people, who had been glad to be carried in rude wagons with</p>
<p>352 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIH</p>
<p>wheels cut roughly out of the trunks of trees , 8 now rode in
expensive chariots from feast to feast. The early kings had prided
themselves on justice; but Astyages, being displeased with Harpagus,
served up to him the dismembered and headless body of his own son, and
forced him to eat of it . 8 Harpagus ate, saying that whatever a king
did was agreeable to him; but he revenged himself by helping Cyrus to
depose Astyages. When Cyrus, the brilliant young ruler of the Median
dependency of</p>
<p>Anshan, in Persia, rebelled against the effeminate despot of
Ecbatana, the Medes themselves welcomed Cyrus’ victory, and accepted
him, almost without protest, as their king. By one engagement Media
ceased to be the master of Persia, Persia became the master of Media,
and prepared to become master of the whole Near Eastern world.</p>
<ol start="14" type="a">
<li>THE GREAT KINGS</li>
</ol>
<p>The romantic Cyrus — His enlightened policies — Cambyses — Darius the
Great — The invasion of Greece</p>
<p>Cyrus was one of those natural rulers at whose coronation, as Emerson
said, all men rejoice. Royal in spirit and action, capable of wise
adminis- tration as well as of dramatic conquest, generous to the
defeated and loved by those who had been his enemies — no wonder the
Greeks made him the subject of innumerable romances, and — to their
minds — the greatest hero before Alexander. It is a disappointment to us
that we cannot draw a reliable picture of him from either Herodotus or
Xeno- phon. The former has mingled many fables with his history,” while
the other has made the Cyropadia an essay on the military art, with
incidental lectures on education and philosophy; at times Xenophon
confuses Cyrus and Socrates. These delightful stories being put aside,
the figure of Cyrus becomes merely an attractive ghost. We can only say
that he was hand- some — since the Persians made him their model of
physical beauty to the end of their ancient art;“ that he established
the Achaemenid Dynasty of “Great Kings,” which ruled Persia through the
most famous period of its history; that he organized the soldiery of
Media and Persia into an invincible army, captured Sardis and Babylon,
ended for a thousand years the rule of the Semites in western Asia, and
absorbed the former realms of Assyria, Babylonia, Lydia and Asia Minor
into the Persian</p>
<p>Empire, the largest political organization of pre-Roman antiquity,
and one of the best-governed in history.</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>So far as we can visualize him through the haze of legend, he was the
most amiable of conquerors, and founded his empire upon generosity. His
enemies knew that he was lenient, and they did not fight him with that
desperate courage which men show when their only choice is to kill or
die. We have seen how, according to Herodotus, he rescued</p>
<p>Croesus from the funeral pyre at Sardis, and made him one of his most
honored counselors; and we have seen how magnanimously he treated the
Jews. The first principle of his policy was that the various peoples of
his empire should be left free in their religious worship and beliefs,
for he fully understood the first principle of statesmanship — that
religion is stronger than the state. Instead of sacking cities and
wrecking temples he showed a courteous respect for the deities of the
conquered, and con- tributed to maintain their shrines; even the
Babylonians, who had resisted him so long, warmed towards him when they
found him preserving their sanctuaries and honoring their pantheon.
Wherever he went in his un- precedented career he offered pious
sacrifice to the local divinities. Like Napoleon he accepted
indifferently all religions, and — with much better grace — humored all
the gods.</p>
<p>Like Napoleon, too, he died of excessive ambition. Having won all</p>
<p>the Near East, he began a series of campaigns aimed to free Media and
Persia from the inroads of central Asia’s nomad ic barbarians. He seems
to have carried these excursions as far as the Jaxartes on the north and
India on the east. Suddenly, at the height of his curve, he was slain in
battle with the Massagetae, an obscure tribe that peopled the southern
shores of the Caspian Sea. Like Alexander he conquered an empire, but
did not five to organize it.</p>
<p>One great defect had sullied his character — occasional and
incalculable cruelty. It was inherited, unmixed with Cyrus’ generosity,
by his half - mad son. Cambyses began by putting to death his brother
and rival, Smerdis; then, lured by the accumulated wealth of Egypt, he
set forth to extend the Persian Empire to the Nile. He succeeded, but
apparently at the cost of his sanity. Memphis was captured easily, but
an army of fifty thousand Persians sent to annex the Oasis of Ammon
perished in the desert, and an expedition to Carthage failed because the
Phoenician crews of the Persian fleet refused to attack a Phoenician
colony. Cambyses lost his head, and abandoned the wise clemency and
tolerance of his father. He publicly scoffed at the Egyptian religion,
and plunged his</p>
<p>dagger derisively into the bull revered by the Egyptians as the god
Apis;</p>
<p>354 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>he exhumed mummies and pried into royal tombs regardless of ancient
curses; he profaned the temples and ordered their idols to be burned. He
thought in this way to cure the Egyptians of superstition; but when he
was stricken with illness — apparently epileptic convulsions — the
Egyptians were certain that their gods had punished him, and that their
theology was now confirmed beyond dispute. As if again to illustrate the
inconveniences of monarchy, Cambyses, with a Napoleonic kick in the
stomach, killed his sister and wife Roxana, slew his son Prexaspes with
an arrow, buried twelve noble Persians alive, condemned Croesus to
death, repented, rejoiced to learn that the sentence had not been
carried out, and punished the officers who had delayed in executing it .
12 On his way back to Persia he learned that a usurper had seized the
throne and was being supported by widespread revolution. From that
moment he disappears from history; tradition has it that he killed
himself . 18</p>
<p>The usurper had pretended to be Smerdis, miraculously preserved from
Cambyses’ fratricidal jealousy; in reality he was a religious fanatic,
a</p>
<p>devotee of the early Magian faith who was bent upon destroying</p>
<p>Zoroastrianism, the official religion of the Persian state. Another
revolu- tion soon deposed him, and the seven aristocrats who had
organized it raised one of their number, Darius, son of Hystaspes, to
the throne. In this bloody way began the reign of Persia’s greatest
king.</p>
<p>Succession to the throne, in Oriental monarchies, was marked not only
by palace revolutions in strife for the royal power, but by uprisings in
subject colonies that grasped the chance of chaos, or an inexperienced
ruler, to reclaim their liberty. The usurpation and assassination of</p>
<p>“Smerdis” gave to Persia’s vassals an excellent opportunity: the
governors of Egypt and Lydia refused submission, and the provinces of
Susiana, Babylonia, Media, Assyria, Armenia, Sacia and others rose in
simultaneous revolt. Darius subdued them with a ruthless hand. Taking
Babylon after a long siege, he crucified three thousand of its leading
citizens as an induce- ment to obedience in the rest; and in a series of
swift campaigns he “pacified” one after another of the rebellious
states. Then, perceiving how easily the vast empire might in any crisis
fall to pieces, he put off the armor of war, became one of the wisest
administrators in history, and set himself to reestablish his realm in a
way that became a model of imperial organization till the fall of Rome.
His rule gave western As ia a generation of such order and prosperity as
that quarrelsome region had never known before.</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>He had hoped to govern in peace, but it is the fatality of empire
to</p>
<p>breed repeated war. For the conquered must be periodically
reconquered, and the conquerors must keep the arts and habits of camp
and battle- field; and at any moment the kaleidoscope of change may
throw up a new empire to challenge the old. In such a situation wars
must be invented if they do not arise of their own accord; each
generation must be inured to the rigors of campaigns, and taught by
practice the sweet decorum of dying for one’s country.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was in part for this reason that Darius led his armies
into</p>
<p>southern Russia, across the Bosphorus and the Danube to the Volga, to
chastise the marauding Scythians; and again across Afghanistan and a
hundred mountain ranges into the valley of the Indus, adding thereby
extensive regions and millions of souls and rupees to his realm. More
substantial reasons must be sought for his expedition into Greece.
Herod- otus would have us believe that Darius entered upon this historic
faux pas because one of his wives, Atossa, teased him into it in bed ;
11 but it is more dignified to believe that the King recognized in the
Greek city-states and their colonies a potential empire, or an actual
confederacy, dangerous to the Persian mastery of western Asia. When
Ionia revolted and received aid from Sparta and Athens, Darius
reconciled himself reluctantly to war. All the world knows the story of
his passage across the Aegean, the defeat of his army at Marathon, and
his gloomy return to Persia. There, amid far-flung preparations for
another attempt upon Greece, he suddenly grew weak, and died.</p>

<li>PERSIAN LIFE AND INDUSTRY</li>
</ol>
<p>The empire — The people — The language — The peasants — The im-
perial highways — Trade and finance</p>
<p>At its greatest extent, under Darius, the Persian Empire included
twenty provinces or “satrapies,” embracing Egypt, Palestine, S yria,
Phoenicia, Lydia, Phrygia, Ionia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Armenia, Assyria,
the Cau-</p>
<p>casus, Babylonia, Media, Persia, the modern Afghanistan and
Baluchistan, India west of the Indus, Sogdiana, Bactria, and the regions
of the Massa- getae and other central Asiatic tribes. Never before had
history recorded so extensive an area brought under one government.</p>
<p>Persia itself, which was to rule these forty million souls for two
hun- dred years, was not at that time the country now known to us as
Persia,</p>
<p>35 6 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>and to its inhabitants as Iran; it was that smaller tract,
immediately east of the Persian Gulf, known to the ancient Persians as
Pars, and to the modern Persians as Fars or Farsistan “ Composed almost
e ntirely of mountains and deserts, poor in rivers, subject to severe
winters and hot, arid summers,* it could support its two million
inhabitants 17 only through such external contributions as trade or
conquest might bring. Its race of hardy moun- taineers came, like the
Medes, of Indo-European stock perhaps from South Russia; and its
language and early religion reveal its close kinship with those Aryans
who crossed Afghanistan to become the ruling caste of northern India.
Darius I, in an inscription at Naksh-i-Rustam, described himself as “a
Persian, the son of a Persian, an Aryan of Aryan descent.” The Zoro -
astrians spoke of their primitive land as Airyana-vaejo — 1 the Aryan
home.”t Strabo applied the name Ariana to what is now called by
essentially the same word — Iran . 19</p>
<p>The Persians were apparently the handsomest people of the ancient
Near East. The monuments picture them as erect and vigorous, made hardy
by their mountains and yet refined by their wealth, with a pleasing
symmetry of features, an almost Greek straightness of nose, and a
certain nobility of countenance and carriage. They adopted for the most
part the Median dress, and later the Median ornaments. They considered
it indecent to re- veal more than the face; clothing covered them from
turban, fillet or cap to sandals or leather shoes. Triple drawers, a
white under-garment of linen, a double tunic, with sleeves hiding the
hands, and a girdle at the waist, kept the population warm in winter and
hot in summer. The king distinguished himself with embroidered trousers
of a crimson hue, and saffron-buttoned shoes. The dress of the women
differed from that of the men only in a slit at the breast. The men wore
long beards and hung their hair in curls, or, later, covered it with
wigs . 19 In the wealthier days of the empire men as well as women made
much use of cosmetics; creams were employed to improve the complexion,
and coloring matter was applied to the eyelids to increase the apparent
size and brilliance of the eyes. A special class of “adorners,” called
kosmetai by the Greeks, arose as beauty experts to the aristocracy. The
Persians were connoisseurs in scents, and were believed by the ancients
to have invented cosmetic creams. The king never went to war without a
case of costly unguents to ensure his fragrance in victory or defeat .
20</p>
<p>Many languages have been used in the long history of Persia. The
speech of the court and the nobility in the days of Darius I was Old
Persian — so</p>

<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>357</p>
<p>closely related to Sanskrit that evidently both were once dialects of
an older tongue, and were cousins to our own.* Old Persian developed on
the one hand into Zend — the language of the Zend-Avesta — and on the
other hand into Pahlavi, a Hindu tongue from which has come the Persian
language of to- day . 23 When the Persians took to writing they adopted
the Babylonian cuneiform for their inscriptions, and the Aramaic
alphabetic script for their documents . 23 They simplified the unwieldly
syllabary of the Babylonians from three hundred characters to thirty-six
signs which gradually became letters instead of syllables, and
constituted a cuneiform alphabet . 34 Writing, however, seemed to the
Persians an effeminate amusement, for which they could spare little time
from love, war and the chase. They did not con- descend to produce
literature.</p>
<p>The common man was contentedly illiterate, and gave himself com-
pletely to the culture of the soil. The Zend-Avesta exalted agriculture
as the basic and noblest occupation of mankind, pleasing above all other
labors to Ahura-Mazda, the supreme god. Some of the land was tilled by
peasant proprietors, who occasionally joined several families in
agricultural cooperatives to work extensive areas together . 25 Part of
the land was owned by feudal barons, and cultivated by tenants in return
for a share of the crop; part of it was tilled by foreign (never
Persian) slaves. Oxen pulled a plough of wood armed with a metal point.
Artificial irrigation drew water from the mountains to the fields.
Barley and wheat were the staple crops and foods, but much meat was
eaten and much wine drunk. Cyrus served wine to his army , 20 and
Persian councils never undertook serious discussions of policy when
sobert — though they took care to revise their decisions the next
morning. One intoxicating drink, the haoma , was offered as a pleasant
sacrifice to the gods, and was believed to engender in its addicts not
ex- citement and anger, but righteousness and piety . 28</p>

<p>products with their imperial tribute. She showed more originality in
the improvement of communications and transport. Engineers under the in-
structions of Darius I built great roads uniting the various capitals;
one of these highways, from Susa to Sardis, was fifteen hundred miles
long. The roads were accurately measured by parasangs (3.4 miles); and
at every fourth parasang, says Herodotus, “there are royal stations and
excellent inns , and the whole road is through an inhabited and safe
country.”” At each station a fresh relay of horses stood ready to carry
on the mail, so that, though the ordinary traveler required ninety days
to go from Susa to Sardis, the royal mail moved over the distance as
quickly as an automobile party does now — that is, in a little less than
a week. The larger rivers were crossed by ferries, but the engineers
could, when they wished, throw across the Euphrates, even across the
Hellespont, substantial bridges over which hun- dreds of sceptical
elephants could pass in safety. Other roads led through the Afghanistan
passes to India, and made Susa a half-way house to the al- ready
fabulous riches of the East. These roads were built primarily for mili-
tary and governmental purposes, to facilitate central control and admin-
istration; but they served also to stimulate commerce and the exchange
of customs, ideas, and the indispensable superstitions of mankind. Along
these roads, for example, angels and the Devil passed from Persian into
Jewish and Christian mythology.</p>
<p>Navigation was not so vigorously advanced as land transportation; the
Persians had no fleet of their own, but merely engaged or conscripted
the vessels of the Phoenicians and the Greeks. Darius built a great
canal uniting Persia with the Mediterranean through the Red Sea and the
Nile, but the carelessness of his successors soon surrendered this
achievement to the shifting sands. When Xerxes royally commanded part of
his naval forces to circumnavigate Africa, it turned back in disgrace
shortly after passing through the Pillars of Hercules. 30 Commerce was
for the most part aban- doned to foreigners — Babylonians, Phoenicians
and Jews; the Persians despised trade, and looked upon a market place as
a breeding-ground of lies. The wealthy classes took pride in supplying
most of their wants directly from their own fields and shops, not
contaminating their fingers with either buy- ing or selling. 31
Payments, loans and interest were at first in the form of goods,
especially cattle and grain; coinage came later from Lydia. Darius
issued gold and silver “darics” stamped with his features,* and valued
at a gold-to-silver ratio of 13.5 to 1. This was the origin of the
bimetallic ratio in modern currencies. 33</p>
<p>*But having no relation with his name; daric was from the Persian
zariq —“ a piece of gold.” The gold daric had a face value of .00. Three
thousand gold darics made one Persian talent. 33</p>

<p>The life of Persia was political and military rather than economic;
its wealth was based not on industry but on power; it existed
precariously as a little governing isle in an immense and unnaturally
subject sea. The imperial organization that maintained this artefact was
one of the most unique and competent in history. At its head was the
king, or Khshathra — i.e., warrior;* the title indicates the military
origin and character of the Persian monarchy. Since lesser kings were
vassal to him, the Persian ruler entitled himself “King of Kings,” and
the ancient world made no protest against his claim; the Greeks called
him simply Basileus — The King . 94 His power was theoretically
absolute; he could loll with a word, without trial or reason given,
after the manner of some very modern dictator; and occasionally he
delegated to his mother or his chief wife this privilege of capricious
slaughter . 95 Few even of the greatest nobles dared offer any criticism
or rebuke, and public opinion was cautiously impotent. The father whose
innocent son had been shot before his eyes by the king merely
complimented the monarch on his excellent archery; offenders bastinadoed
by the royal order thanked His Majesty for keeping them in mind.“ The
king might rule as well as reign, if, like Cyrus and the first Darius,
he cared to bestir himself; but the later monarchs dele- gated most of
the cares of government to noble subordinates or imperial eunuchs, and
spent their time at love, dice or the chase . 87 The court was overrun
with eunuchs who, from their coigns of vantage as guards of the harem
and pedagogues to the princes, stewed a poisonous brew of intrigue in
every reign.f 38 The king had the right to choose his successor from
among his sons, but ordinarily the succession was determined by
assassina- tion and revolution.</p>
<p>The royal power was limited in practice by the strength of the
aristoc- racy that mediated between the people and the throne. It was a
matter of custom that the six families of the men who had shared with

<p>the dangers of the revolt against false Smerdis, should have
exceptional privileges and be consulted in all matters of vital
interest. Many of the nobles attended court, and served as a council for
whose advice the monarch usually showed the highest regard. Most members
of the aris- tocracy were attached to the throne by receiving their
estates from the king; in return they provided him with men and
materials when he took the field. Within their fiefs they had almost
complete authority — levying taxes, enacting laws, executing judgment,
and maintaining their own armed forces. 40</p>
<p>The real basis of the royal power and imperial government was the
army; an empire exists only so long as it retains its superior capacity
to kill. The obligation to enlist on any declaration of war fell upon
every able-bodied male from fifteen to fifty years of age. 41 When the
father of three sons petitioned Darius to exempt one of them from
service, all three were put to death; and when another father, having
sent four sons to the battlefield, begged Xerxes to permit the fifth son
to stay behind and manage the family estate, the body of this fifth son
was cut in two by royal order and placed on both sides of the road by
which the army was to pass. 42 * The troops marched off to war amid the
blare of martial music and the plaudits of citizens above the military
age.</p>
<p>The spearhead of the army was the Royal Guard — two thousand horse-
men and two thousand infantry, all nobles — whose function it was to
guard the king. The standing army consisted exclusively of Persians and
Medes, and from this permanent force came most of the garrisons
stationed as centers of persuasion at strategic points in the empire.
The complete force consisted of levies from every subject nation, each
group with its own distinct lan- guage, weapons and habits of war. Its
equipment and retinue was as varied as its origin: bows and arrows,
scimitars, javelins, daggers, pikes, slings, knives, shields, helmets,
leather cuirasses, coats of mail, horses, elephants, heralds, scribes,
eunuchs, prostitutes, concubines, and chariots armed on each hub with
great steel scythes. The whole mass, though vast in number, and
amounting in the expedition of Xerxes to 1,800,000 men, never achieved
unity, and at the first sign of a reverse it became a disorderly mob. It
con- quered by mere force of numbers, by an elastic capacity for
absorbing casualties; it was destined to be overthrown as soon as it
should encounter a well-organized army speaking one speech and accepting
one discipline. This was the secret of Marathon and Plataea.</p>
<p>In such a state the only law was the will of the king and the
power</p>
<p>of the army; no rights were sacred against these, and no precedents
could</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>avail except an earlier decree of the king. For it was a proud boast
of Persia that its laws never changed, and that a royal promise or
decree was irrevocable. In his edicts and judgments the king was
supposed to be inspired by the god Ahura-Mazda himself; therefore the
law of</p>
<p>the realm was the Divine Will, and any infraction of it was an
offense against the deity. The king was the supreme court, but it was
his custom to delegate this function to some learned elder in his
retinue. Below him was a High Court of Justice with seven members, and
below this were local courts scattered through the realm. The priests
formulated the law, and for a long time acted as judges; in later days
laymen, even laywomen, sat in judgment. Bail was accepted in all but the
most important cases, and a regular procedure of trial was followed. The
court occasionally decreed rewards as well as punishments, and in
considering a crime weighed against it the good record and services of
the accused. The law’s delays were mitigated by fixing a time -limit for
each case, and by proposing to all disputants an arbitrator of their own
choice who might bring them to a peaceable settlement. As the law
gathered precedents and complexity a class of men arose called “speakers
of the law,” who offered to explain it to litigants and help them
conduct their cases.“ Oaths were taken, and use was occasionally made of
the ordeal.“ Bribery was discouraged by making the tender or acceptance
of it a capital</p>
<p>offense. Cambyses improved the integrity of the courts by causing an
unjust judge to be flayed alive, and using his skin to upholster the
judicial bench — to which he then appointed the dead judge’s son.“</p>
<p>Minor punishments took the form of flogging — from five to two hun-
dred blows with a horsewhip; the poisoning of a shepherd dog received
two hundred strokes, manslaughter ninety.“ The administration of the law
was partly financed by commuting stripes into fines, at the rate of six
rupees to a stripe . 47 More serious crimes were punished with branding,
maiming, mutilation, blinding, imprisonment or death. The letter of the
law forbade any one, even the king, to sentence a man to death for a
simple crime; but it could be decreed for treason, rape, sodomy, murder,
“self - pollution,” burning or burying the dead, intrusion upon the
king’s privacy, approaching one of his concubines, accidentally sitting
upon his throne, or for any displeasure to the ruling house.“ Death was
procured in such cases by poisoning, impaling, crucifixion, hanging
(usually with the head down), stoning, burying the body up to the head,
crushing the head between huge stones, smothering the victim in hot
ashes, or by</p>

<p>the incr edibly cruel rite called “the boats.”* Some of these
barbarous punishments were bequeathed to the invading Turks of a later
age, and passed down into the heritage of mankind “</p>
<p>With these laws and this army the king sought to govern his
twenty</p>
<p>satrapies from his many capitals — originally Pasargadae,
occasionally Per- sepolis, in summer Ecbatana, usually Susa; here, in
the ancient capital of Elam, the history of the ancient Near East came
full circle, binding the beginning and the end. Susa had the advantage
of inaccessibility, and the disadvantages of distance; Alexander had to
come two thousand miles to take it, but it had to send its troops
fifteen hundred miles to suppress revolts in Lydia or Egypt. Ultimately
the great roads merely paved the way for the physical conquest of
western Asia by Greece and Rome, and the theological conquest of Greece
and Rome by western Asia.</p>
<p>The empire was divided into provinces or satrapies for
convenience</p>
<p>of administration and taxation. Each province was governed in the
name of the King of Kings, sometimes by a vassal prince, ordinarily by
a</p>
<p>“satrap” (ruler) royally appointed for as long a time as he could
retain favor at the court. To keep the satraps in hand Darius sent to
each</p>
<p>province a general to control its armed forces independently of the
gov- ernor; and to make matters trebly sure he appointed in each
province a secretary, independent of both satrap and general, to report
their behavior to the king. As a further precaution an intelligence
service known as “The King’s Eyes and Ears” might appear at any moment
to examine the affairs, records and finances of the province. Sometimes
the satrap was</p>

<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>363</p>
<p>deposed without trial, sometimes he was quietly poisoned by his
servants at the order of the king. Underneath the satrap and the
secretary was a horde of clerks who carried on so much of the government
as had no direct need of force; this body of clerks carried over from
one administra- tion to another, even from reign to reign. The king
dies, but the bureau- cracy is immortal.</p>
<p>The salaries of these provincial officials were paid not by the king
but by the people whom they ruled. The remuneration was ample enough to
provide the satraps with palaces, harems, and extensive hunting parks to
which the Persians gave the historic name of paradise. In addition, each
satrapy was required to send the king, annually, a fixed amount of money
and goods by way of taxation. India sent 4680 talents, Assyria and Baby-
lonia 1000, Egypt 700, the four satrapies of Asia Minor 1760, etc.,
making a total of some 14,560 talents — variously estimated as
equivalent to from 60,000,000 to 18,000,000 a year. Furthermore, each
province was expected to contribute to the king’s needs in goods and
supplies : Egypt had to furnish com annually for 120,000 men; the Medes
provided</p>
<p>100,000 sheep, the Armenians 30,000 foals, the Babylonians five
hundred young eunuchs. Other sources of wealth swelled the central
revenue to such a point that when Alexander captured the Persian
capitals after one hundred and fifty years of Persian extravagance,
after a hundred expensive revolts and wars, and after Darius III had
carried off 8000 talents with him in his flight, he found 180,000
talents left in the royal treasuries — some ,700,000,000.“</p>
<p>Despite these high charges for its services, the Persian Empire was
the most successful experiment in imperial government that the Mediter-
ranean world would know before the coming of Rome — which was des- tined
to inherit m uch of the earlier empire’s political structure and ad -
ministrative forms. The cruelty and dissipation of the later monarchs,
the occasional barbarism of the laws, and the heavy burdens of taxation
were balanced, as human governments go, by such order and peace as made
the provinces rich despite these levies, and by such liberty as only the
most enlightened empires have accorded to subject states. Each region
retained its own language, laws, customs, morals, religion and coin-
age, and sometimes its native dynasty of kings. Many of the tributary
nations, like Babylonia, Phoenicia and Palestine, were well satisfied
with the situation, and suspected that their own generals and
tax-gatherers would have plucked them even more ferociously. Under

<p>The Bible of Persia — Ahura-Mazda — The good and the evil</p>
<p>spirits — Their struggle for the possession of the world</p>
<p>Persian legend tells how, many hundreds of years before the birth of
Christ, a great prophet appeared in Airyana-vaejo, the ancien t “home of
the Aryans.” His people called him Zarathustra; but the Greeks, who
could never bear the orthography of the “barbarians” patiently, called
him Zoroastres. His conception was divine: his guardian angel entered
into an haoma plant, and passed with its juice into the body of a priest
as the latter offered divine sacrifice; at the same time a ray of
heaven’s glory entered the bosom of a maid of noble lineage. The priest
espoused the maid, the imprisoned angel mingled with the imprisoned ray,
and Zarathustra began to be . 63 He laughed aloud on the very day of his
birth, and the evil spirits that gather around every life fled from him
in tumult and terror.“ Out of his great love for wisdom and
righteousness he with- drew from the society of men, and chose to live
in a mountain wilderness on cheese and the fruits of the soil. The Devil
tempted him, but to no avail. His breast was pierced with a sword, and
his entrails were filled with molten lead; he did not complain, but
clung to his faith in Ahura- Mazda — the Lord of Light — as supreme god.
Ahura-Mazda appeared to him and gave into his hands the Avesta, or Book
of Knowledge and Wis- dom, and bade him preach it to mankind. For a long
time all the world ridiculed and persecuted him; but at last a high
prince of Iran — Vishtaspa or Hystaspes — heard him gladly, and promised
to spread the new faith among his people. Thus was the Zoroastrian
religion bom. Zarathustra himself lived to a very old age, was consumed
in a flash of lightning, and ascended into heaven.®</p>
<p>We cannot tell how much of his story is true; perhaps some Josiah</p>
<p>discovered him. The Greeks accepted him as historical, and honored
him with an antiquity of 5500 years before their time® Berosus the</p>

<p>and the sixth before Christ. #BS When he appeared, among the
ancestors of the Medes and the Persians, he found his people worshiping
animals,” ancestors,® the earth and the sun, in a religion having many
elements and deities in common with the Hindus of the Vedic age. The
chief divinities of this pre-Zoroastrian faith were Mithra, god of the
sun, Anaita, goddess of fertility and the earth, and Haoma the bull-god
who, dying, rose</p>
<p>again, and gave mankind his blood as a drink that would confer immor-
tality; him the early Iranians worshiped by drinking the intoxicating
juice of the haovia herb found on their mountain slopes.® Zarathustra
was shocked at these primitive deities and this Dionysian ritual; he
rebelled against the “Magi” or priests who prayed and sacrificed to
them; and with all the</p>

dis- ciples of the Master had gathered his sayings and his prayers.

scholar they are known to the Occidental world as the Zend-AvestaA The
contemporary non-Persian reader is terrified to find that the
substantial volumes that sur- vive, though much shorter than our Bible,
are but a small fraction of the revelation vouchsafed to Zarathustra by
his god.$ What remains is, to the</p>

<p>t Anquetil-Duperron (ca. 1771 a.d.) introduced the prefix Zend ,
which the Persians had used to denote merely a translation and
interpretation of the Avesta . The last is a word of uncertain origin,
probably derived, like Veda, from the Aryan root vid, to know. 68</p>
<p>^Native tradition tells of a larger Avesta in twenty-one books called
Nasks; these in turn, we are told, were but part of the original
Scriptures. One of the Nasks remains intact — the Vendidad; the rest
survive only in scattered fragments in such later compo- sitions as the
Dinkard and the Bundahish. Arab historians speak of the complete text as
having covered 12,000 cowhides. According to a sacred tradition, two
copies of this were made by Prince Vishtaspa; one of them was destroyed
when Alexander burned the royal palace at Persepolis; the other was
taken by the victorious Greeks to their own country, and being
translated, provided the Greeks (according to the * Persian authorities)
with all their scientific knowledge. During the third century of the
Christian Era Vologesus V, a Parthian king of the Arsacid Dynasty,

legends, prescriptions, ritual and morals, brightened now and then by
noble lan- guage, fervent devotion, ethical elevation, or lyric piety.
Like our Old Testament it is a highly eclectic composition. The student
discovers here and there the gods, the ideas, sometimes the very words
and phrases of the Rig-veda — to such an extent that some Indian
scholars consider the Avesta to have been inspired not by Ahura-Mazda
but by the Vedas* at other times one comes upon passages of ancient
Babylonian provenance, such as the creation of the world in six periods
(the heavens, the waters, the earth, plants, animals, man,) the descent
of all men from two first parents, the establishment of an earthly
paradise , 63 the discontent of the Creator with his creation, and his
resolve to destroy all but a remnant of it</p>
<p>by a flood . 07 But the specifically Iranian elements suffice
abundantly to char- acterize the whole: the world is conceived in
dualistic terms as the stage of a conflict, lasting twelve thousand
years, between the god Ahura-Mazda and the devil Ahriman; purity and
honesty are the greatest of the virtues, and will lead to everlasting
life; the dead must not be buried or burned, as by the obscene Greeks or
Hindus, but must be thrown to the dogs or to birds of prey . 68</p>
<p>The god of Zarathustra was first of all “the whole circle of the</p>
<p>heavens” themselves. Ahura - Mazda “clothes himself with the solid
vault of the firmament as his raiment; … his body is the light and the
sov- ereig n glory; the sun and the moon are his eyes.” In later days,
when the religion passed from prophets to politicians, the great deity
was pic- tured as a gigantic king of imposing majesty. As creator and
ruler of the world he was assisted by a legion of lesser divinities,
originally pictured as forms and powers of nature — fire and water, sun
and moon, wind and fragments surviving either in writing or in the
memory of the faithful; this collection was fixed in its present form as
the Zoroastrian canon in the fourth century, and became the official
religion of the Persian state. The compilation so formed suffered
further ravages during the Moslem conquest of Persia in the seventh
century. 63</p>

<p>rain; but it was the achievement of Zarathustra that he conceived his
god as supreme over all things, in terms as noble as the Book of
Job:</p>
<p>This I ask thee, tell me truly, O Ahura-Mazda: Who determined</p>
<p>the paths of suns and stars — who is it by whom the moon waxes and
wanes? . . . Who, from below, sustained the earth and the firmament from
falling — who sustained the waters and plants — who yoked</p>
<p>swiftness with the winds and the clouds — who, Ahura-Mazda, called
forth the Good Mind?“°</p>
<p>This “Good Mind” meant not any human mind, but a divine wisdom,
almost a Logos* used by Ahura-Mazda as an intermediate agency of
creation. Zarathustra had interpreted Ahura-Mazda as having seven as-
pects or qualities: Light, Good Mind, Right, Dominion, Piety, Well-</p>
<p>being, and Immortality. His followers, habituated to polytheism,
inter- preted these attributes as persons (called by them amesha spenta,
or im- mortal holy ones) who, under the leadership of Ahura-Mazda,
created and managed the world; in this way the majestic monotheism of
the founder became — as in the case of Christianity — the polytheism of
the people. In addition to these holy spirits were the guardian angels,
of which Persian theology supplied one for every man, woman and child.
But just as these angels and the immortal holy ones helped men to
virtue, so, according to the pious Persian (influenced, presumably, by
Babylonian demonology), seven dcevas, or evil spirits, hovered in the
air, always tempting men to crime and sin, and forever engaged in a war
upon Ahura- Mazda and every form of righteousness. The leader of these
devils was Angro-Mainyus or Ahriman, Prince of Darkness and ruler of the
nether world, prototype of that busy Satan whom the Jews appear to
have</p>
<p>adopted from Persia and bequeathed to Christianity. It was Ahriman,
for example, who had created serpents, vermin, locusts, ants, winter,
darkness, crime, sin, sodomy, menstruation, and the other plagues of
life; and it was these inventions of the Devil that had ruined the
Paradise in which Ahura-Mazda had place d the first progenitors of the
human race.” Zara - thustra seems to have regarded these evil spirits as
spurious deities, popular and superstitious incarnations of the abstract
forces that resist the progress of man. His followers, however, found it
easier to think of them as living</p>

<p>beings, and personified them in such abundance that in after times
the devils of Persian theology were numbered in millions.”</p>
<p>As this system of belief came from Zarathustra it bordered upon</p>
<p>monotheism. Even with the intrusion of Ahriman and the evil spirits
it remained as monotheistic as Christianity was to be with its Satan,
its devils and its angels; indeed, one hears, in early Christian
theology, as many echoes of Persian dualism as of Hebrew Puritanism or
Greek</p>
<p>philosophy. The Zoroastrian conception of God might have satisfied as
particular a spirit as Matthew Arnold: Ahura-Mazda was the sum-total of
all those forces in the world that make for righteousness; and morality
lay in cooperation with those forces. Furthermore there was in this</p>
<p>dualism a certain justice to the contradictoriness and perversity of
things, which monotheism never provided; and though the Zoroastrian
theolo- gians, after the manner of Hindu mystics and Scholastic
philosophers, sometimes argued that evil was unreal,” the y offered, in
effect, a theology well adapted to dramatize for the average mind the
moral issues of life. The last act of the play, they promised, would be
— for the just man — a happy ending: after four epochs of three thousand
years each, in which Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman would alternately
predominate, the forces of evil would be finally destroyed; right would
triumph everywhere, and evil would forever cease to be. Then all good
men would join Ahura- Mazda in Paradise, and the wicked would fall into
a gulf of outer dark- ness, where they would feed on poison
eternally.”</p>

<p>Man as a battlefield — The Undying Fire — Hell, Purgatory and</p>

<p>By picturing the world as the scene of a struggle between good
and</p>
<p>evil, the Zoroastrians established in the popular imagination a
powerful supernatural stimulus and sanction for morals. The soul of man,
like the universe, was represented as a battleground of beneficent and
maleficent spirits; every man was a warrior, whether he liked it or not,
in the army of either the Lord or the Devil; every act or omission
advanced the cause of Ahura-Mazda or of Ahriman. It was an ethic even
more admirable than the theology — if men must have supernatural
supports for their morality; it gave to the common life a dignity and
significance grander than any that could come to it from a world-view
that locked upon man (in medie-</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>369</p>
<p>val phrase) as a helpless worm or (in modern terms) as a mechanical
au- tomaton. Human beings were not, to Zarathustra’s thinking, mere
pawns in this cosmic war; they had free will, since Ahura-Mazda wished
them to be personalities in their own right; they might freely choose
whether they would follow the Light or the Lie. For Ahriman was the
Living</p>
<p>Lie, and every liar was his servant.</p>
<p>Out of this general conception emerged a detailed but simple code of
morals, centered about the Golden Rule. “That nature alone is good</p>
<p>which shall not do unto another whatever is not good unto its own</p>
<p>self.”*” Man’s duty, says the Avesta, is three - fold: “To make him
who is an enemy a friend; to make him who is wicked righteous; and to
make him who is ignorant learned.”” The greatest virtue is piety; second
o nly to that is honor and honesty in action and speech. Interest was
not to be charged to Persians, but loans were to be looked upon as
almost sacred.” The worst sin of all (in the Avestan as in the Mosaic
code) is unbelief. We may judge from the severe punishments with which
it was honored that scepticism existed among the Persians; death was to
be visited upon the apostate without delay.” The generosity and
kindliness enjoined by the Master did not apply, in practice, to
infidels — i.e., foreigners; these were inferior species of men, whom
Ahura-Mazda had deluded into loving their own countries only in order
that they should not invade Persia. The Persians, says Herodotus,
“esteem themselves to be far the most excellent of men in every
respect”; t hey believe that other nations approach to excellence
according to their geographical proximity to Persia, “but that they are
the worst who live farthest from them.”” The words have a</p>
<p>contemporary ring,- and a universal application.</p>
<p>Piety being the greatest virtue, the first duty of life was the
worship of God with purification, sacrifice and prayer. Zoroastrian
Persia tolerated neither temples nor idols; altars were erected on
hill-tops, in palaces, or in the center of the city, and fires were
kindled upon them in honor of Ahura-Mazda or some lesser divinity. Fire
itself was worshiped as a god, Atar, the very son of the Lord of Light.
Every family centered round</p>
<p>the hearth; to keep the home fire burning, never to let it be
extinguished, was part of the ritual of faith. And the Undying Fire of
the skies, the Sun, was adored as the highest and most characteristic
embodiment of</p>

</ul>
<p>370 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Ahura-Mazda or Mithra, quite as Ikhnaton had worshiped it in Egypt.
“The morning Sun,” said the Scriptures, “must be reverenced till mid
-day, and that of mid-day must be reverenced till the afternoon, and
that of the afternoon must be reverenced till evening. . . . While men
reverence not the Sun, the good works which they do that day are not
their own.”” To the sun, to fire, to Ahura-Mazda, sacrifice was offered
of flowers, bread, fruit, perfumes, oxen, sheep, camels, horses, asses
and stags; anciently, as elsewhere, human victims had been offered too.“
The gods received only the odor; the edible portions were kept for the
priests and the worshipers, for as the Magi explained, the gods required
only the soul of t he victim.” Though the Master abominated it, and
there is no mention of it in the Avesta, the old Aryan offering of the
intoxicating haoma juice to the gods continued far into Zoroastrian
days; the priest drank part of the sacred fluid, and divided the
remainder among the faithful in holy communion.” When people were too
poor to offer such tasty sacrifices they made up for it by adulatory
prayer. Ahura-Mazda, like Yahveh, liked to sip his praise, and made for
the pious an imposing list of his accomplishments, which became a
favorite Persian litany.“</p>
<p>Given a life of piety and truth, the Persian might face death
unafraid: this, after all, is one of the secret purposes of religion.
Astivihad, the god of death, finds every one, no matter where; he is the
confident seeker</p>
<p>from whom not one of mortal men can escape. Not those who</p>
<p>go down deep, like Afrasyab the Turk, who made himself an iron</p>
<p>palace under the earth, a thousand times the height of a man,
with</p>
<p>a hundred columns; in that palace he made the stars, the moon and the
sun go round, making the light of day; in that palace he did</p>
<p>everything at his pleasure, and he lived the happiest life: with
all</p>
<p>his strength and witchcraft he could not escape from Astivihad.</p>
<p>. . . Nor he who dug this wide, round earth, with extremities
that</p>
<p>lie afar, like Dahak, who went from the east to the west
searching</p>
<p>for immortality and did not find it: with all his strength and
power</p>
<p>he could not escape from Astivihad. … To every one comes the</p>
<p>unseen, deceiving Astivihad, who accepts neither compliments nor</p>
<p>bribes, who is no respecter of persons, and ruthlessly makes men</p>
<p>perish.®</p>
<p>And yet — for it is in the nature of religion to threaten and terrify
as well as to console — the Persian could not look upon death unafraid
unless</p>

<p>he had been a faithful warrior in Ahura- Mazda’s cause. Beyond that
most awful of all mysteries lay a hell and a purgatory as well as a
paradise. All dead souls would have to pass over a Sifting Bridge: the
good soul would come, on the other side, to the “Abode of Song,” where
it would be wel - comed by a “young maiden radiant and strong, with well
- developed bust,” and would live in happiness with Ahura-Mazda to the
end of time; but the wicked soul, failing to get across, would fall into
as deep a level of hell as was adjusted to its degree of wickedness.”
This hell was no mere Hades to which, as in earlier religions, all the
dead descended, whether good or bad; it was an abyss of darkness and
terror in which condemned souls suf- fered torments to the end of the
world . 87 If a man’s virtues outweighed his sins he would endure the
cleansing of a temporary punishment; if he had sinned much but had done
good works, he would suffer for only twelve thousand years, and then
would rise into heaven . 88 Already, the good Zoroastrians tell us, the
divine consummation of history approaches: the birth of Zarathustra
began the last world-epoch of three thousand years; after three prophets
of his seed have, at intervals, carried his doc- trine throughout the
world, the Last Judgment will be pronounced, the Kingdom of Ahura-Mazda
will come, and Ahriman and all the forces of evil will be utterly
destroyed. Then all good souls will begin life anew in a w orld without
evil, darkness or pain. 8 ” “The dead shall rise, life shall return to
the bodies, and they shall breathe again; . . . the whole physical world
shall become free from old age and death, from corruption and decay,
forever and ever .” 80</p>
<p>Here again, as in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, we hear the
threat</p>
<p>of that awful Last Judgment which seems to have passed from Persian
to Jewish eschatology in the days of the Persian ascendancy in
Palestine. It was an admirable formula for frightening children into
obeying their parents; and since one function of religion is to ease the
difficult and neces- sary task of disciplining the young by the old, we
must grant to the</p>
<p>Zoroastrian priests a fine professional skill in the brewing of
theology. All in all it was a splendid religion, less warlike and
bloody, less idolatrous and superstitious, than the other religions of
its time; and it did not deserve to die so soon.</p>
<p>For a while, under Darius I, it became the spiritual expression of
a</p>
<p>nation at its height. But humanity loves poetry more than logic, and
with- out a myth the people perish. Underneath the official worship of
Ahura- Mazda the cult of Mithra and Anaita — god of the sun and goddess
of</p>
<p>37 2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>vegetation and fertility, generation and sex — continued to find
devotees; and in the days of Artaxerxes II their names began to appear
again in the royal inscriptions. Thereafter Mithra grew powerfully in
favor and</p>
<p>Ahura-Mazda faded away until, in the first centuries of our era, the
cult of Mithra as a divine youth of beautiful countenance — with a
radiant halo over his head as a symbol of his ancient identity with the
sun — spread throughout the Roman Empire, and shared in giving Christmas
to Christian- ity.* Zarathustra, had he been immortal, would have been
scandalized to find statues of Anaita, the Persian Aphrodite, set up in
many cities of the empire within a few centuries after his death. 61 And
surely it would not have pleased him to find so many pages of his
revelation devoted to magic formulas for healing, divination and
sorcery. 66 After his death the old priesthood of “Wise Men” or Magi
conquered him as priesthoods conquer in the end every vigorous rebel or
heretic — by adopting and absorbing him into their theology; they
numbered him among the Magi and forgot him. 6 * By an austere and
monogamous life, by a thousand precise observ- ances of sacred ritual
and ceremonial cleanliness, by abstention from flesh food, and by a
simple and unpretentious dress, the Magi acquired, even among the
Greeks, a high reputation for wisdom, and among their own people an
almost boundless influence. The Persian kings themselves became their
pupils, and took no step of consequence without consulting them. The
higher ranks among them were sages, the lower were diviners and sorc-
erers, readers of stars and interpreters of dreams; 04 the very word
magic is taken from their name. Year by year the Zoroastrian elements in
Persian religion faded away; they were revived for a time under the
Sassanid Dynasty (226-651 a.d.), but were finally eliminated by the
Moslem and Tatar invasions of Persia. Zoroastrianism survives today only
among small communities in the province of Fars, and among the ninety
thousand Parsees of India. These devotedly preserve and study the
ancient scrip- tures, worship fire, earth, water and air as sacred, and
expose their dead in “Towers of Silence” to birds of prey lest burning
or burial should defile the holy elements. They are a people of
excellent morals and character, a living tribute to the civilizing
effect of Zarathustra’s doctrine upon man - kind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is surprising how much brutality remained in the
Medes and the Persians despite their religion. Darius I, their greatest
king, writes in the Behistun inscripti on: “Fravartish was seized and
brought to me. I cut off his nose and ears, and I cut out his tongue,
and I put out his eyes. At my court he was kept in chains; all the
people saw him. Later I cruci- fied him in Ecbatana. . . . Ahura-Mazda
was my strong support; under the protection of Ahura-Mazda my army
utterly smote the rebellious army, and they seized Citrankakhara and
brought him to me. Then I cut off his nose and ears and put out his
eyes. He was kept in chains at my court; all the people saw hi m.
Afterwards I crucified him .” 66 The murders retailed in Plutarch’s life
of Artaxerxes II offer a sanguinary specimen of the morals of the later
courts. Traitors were dealt with without sentiment: they and their
leaders were crucified, their followers were sold as slaves, their towns
were pillaged, their boys were castrated, their girls were sold into
harems .® 8 But it would be unfair to judge the people from their kings;
virtue is not news, and virtuous men, like happy nations, have no
history. Even the kings showed on occasion a fine generosity, and were
known among the faithless Greeks for their fidelity; a treaty made with
them could be relied upon, and it was their boast that they never broke
their word . 07 It is a tes- timony to the character of the Persians
that whereas any one could hire Greeks to fight Greeks, it was rare
indeed that a Persian could be hired to fight Persians.*</p>
<p>Manners were milder than the blood and iron of history would suggest.
The Persians were free and open in speech, generous, warm-hearted and
hospitable . 00 Etiquette was almost as punctilious among them as with
the Chinese. When equals met they embraced, and kissed each other on the
lips; to persons of higher rank they made a deep obeisance; to those of
lower rank they offered the cheek; to commoners they bowed. 1 “ They
thought it unbecoming to eat or drink anything in the street, or
publicly to spit or blow the nose . 101 Until the reign of Xerxes the
people were abstemious in food and drink, eating only one meal per day,
and drinking nothing but</p>

</ul>
<p>374 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>water . 102 Cleanliness was rated as the greatest good after life
itself. Good works done with dirty hands were worthless; “for while one
doth not ut - terly destroy corruption” (“germs”?), “there is no coming
of the angels to his body .” 108 Severe penalties were decreed for those
who spread con - tagious diseases. On festal occasions the people
gathered together all clothed in white . 104 The Avestan code, like the
Brahman and the Mosaic, heaped up ceremonial precautions and ablutions;
great arid tracts of the Zoroastrian Scriptures are given over to
wearisome formulas for cleansing the body and the soul . 105 Parings of
nails, cuttings of hair and exhalations of the breath were marked out as
unclean things, which the wise Persian would avoid unless they had been
purified . 106</p>
<p>The code was again Judaically stern against the sins of the flesh.
Onan- ism was to be punished with flogging; and men and women guilty of
sexual promiscuity or prostit ution “ought to be slain even more than
gliding serpents, than howling wolves .” 107 That practice kept its
usual distance from precept appears from an item in Herodotus: “To carry
off women by violence the Persians think is the act of wicked men; but t
o trouble one’s self about avenging them when so carried off is the act
of foolish men; and to pay no regard to them when carried off is the act
of wise men; for it is clear that if they had not been willing, they
could not have been carried off”108 a( j ( j s ^ e i sew here, that the
Persians “have learnt from the Greeks a passion for boys”; 109 and
though we cannot always trust this supreme re - porter, we scent some
corroboration of him in the intensity with which the Avesta excoriates
sodomy; for that deed, it says again and again, there is no forgiveness;
“nothing can wash it away.” uo</p>
<p>Virgins and bachelors were not encouraged by the code, but polygamy
and concubinage were allowed; a military society has use for many
children. “The man who has a wife,” says the Avesta , “is far above him
who lives in continence; he who keeps a house is far above him who has
none; he who has children is far above him who has none; he who has
riches is far above him who has none”; 111 these are criteria of social
standing fairly common among the nations. The family is ranked as the
holiest of all institutions. “O Maker of the material world,”
Zarathustra asks Ahura - Mazda, “thou Holy One, which is the second
place where the earth feels most happy?” And Ahura- Mazda answers him:
“It is the place whereon one of the faith - ful erects a house with a
priest within, with cattle, with a wife, with chil- dren, and good herds
within; and wherein afterwards the cattle continue to thrive, the wife
to thrive, the child to thrive, the fire to thrive, and every blessing
of life to thrive .” 112 The animal— above all others the dog — was an
integral part of the family, as in the last commandment given to Moses.
The nearest family was enjoined to take in and care for any homeless</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>pregnant beast. 113 Severe penalties were prescribed for those who
fed unfit food to dogs, or served them their food too hot; and fourteen
hundred stripes were the punishment for “smiting a bitch which has been
covered by three dogs.”” 4 The bull was honored for his procreative
powers, and prayer and sacrifice were offered to the cow. 115</p>
<p>Matches were arranged by the parents on the arrival of their children
at puberty. The range of choice was wide, for we hear of the marriage of
brother and sister, father and daughter, mother and son. 110 Concubines
were for the most part a luxury of the rich; the aristocracy never went
to war without them. 117 In the later days of the empire the king’s
harem contain ed from 329 to 360 concubines, for it had become a custom
that no woman might share the royal couch twice unless she was
overwhelmingly beauti- ful. 118</p>
<p>In the time of the Prophet the position of woman in Persia was high,
as ancient manners went: she moved in public freely and unveiled; she
owned and managed property, and could, like most modern women, direct
the af- fairs of her husband in his name, or through his pen. After
Darius her status declined, especially among the rich. The poorer women
retained their freedom of movement, because they had to work; but in
other cases the seclusion always enforced in the menstrual periods was
extended to the whole social life of woman, and laid the foundations of
the Moslem insti- tution of purdah. Upper-class women could not venture
out except in cur- tained litters, and were not permitted to mingle
publicly with men; married women were forbidden to see even their
nearest male relatives, such as their fathers or brothers. Women are
never mentioned or represented in the public inscriptions and monuments
of ancient Persia. Concubines had greater freedom, since they were
employed to entertain their masters’ guests. Even in the later reigns
women were powerful at the court, rivaling the eunuchs in the
persistence of their plotting and the kings in the refine- ments of
their cruelty . n9 *</p>
<p>Children as well as marriage were indispensable to respectability.
Sons were highly valued as economic assets to their parents and military
assets to the king; girls were regretted, for they had to be brought up
for some other man’s home and profit. “Men do not pray for daughters,”
said the Persians, “and angels do not reckon them among their gifts to
mankind.” 120</p>
<ul>
<li>Statira was a model queen to Artaxerxes II; but his mother,
Parysatis, poisoned her out of jealousy, encouraged the king to marry
his own daughter Atossa, played dice with him for the life of a eunuch,
and, winning, had him flayed alive. When Artaxerxes ordered the
execution of a Carian soldier, Parysatis bettered his instructions by
having the man stretched upon the rack for ten days, his eyes tom out,
and molten lead poured into his ears until he died . 11 ® 3</li>
</ul>
<p>37^ the story of civilization (chap. XIII</p>
<p>The king annually sent gifts to every father of many sons, as if in
advance payment for their blood . 121 Fornication, even adultery, might
be forgiven if there was no abortion; abortion was a worse crime than
the others, and was to be punished with death . 122 One of the ancient
commentaries, the Bundahish, specifies means for avoiding conception,
but warns the people against them. “On the nature of generation it is
said in Revelation that a woman when she cometh out from menstruation,
during ten days and nights, when they go near u nto her, readily
becometh pregnant .” 123</p>
<p>The child remained under the care of the women till five, and under
the care of his father from five to seven; at seven he went to school.
Educa- tion was mostly confined to the sons of the well-to-do, and was
usually ad- ministered by priests. Classes met in the temple or the home
of the priest; it was a principle never to have a school meet near a
market-place, lest the atmosphere of lying, swearing and cheating that
prevailed in the bazaars should corrupt the young . 124 The texts were
the Avesta and its commen- taries; the subjects were religion, medicine
or law; the method of learning was by commission to memory and by the
rote recitation of long pas- sages . 126 Boys of the unpretentious
classes were not spoiled with letters, but were taught only three things
— to ride a horse, to use the bow, and to speak the truth . 126 Higher
education extended to the age of twenty or twenty-four among the sons of
the aristocracy; some were especially prepared for public office or
provincial administration; all were trained in the art of war. The life
in these higher schools was arduous: the students rose early, ran great
distances, rode difficult horses at high speed, swam, hunted, pursued
thieves, sowed farms, planted trees, made long marches under a hot sun
or in bitter cold, and learned to bear every change and rigor of
climate, to subsist on coarse foods, and to cross rivers while keeping
their clothes and armor dry . 127 It was such a schooling as would have
gladdened the heart of Friedrich Nietzsche in those moments when he
could forget the bright and varied culture of ancient Greece.</p>

<p>Estimate of Persian art</p>
<p>The Persians seem to have deliberately neglected to train their
children in any other art than that of life. Literature was a delicacy
for which they had small use; science was a commodity which they could
import from Babylon. They had a certain relish for poetry and romantic
fiction,</p>
<p>PERSIA</p>
<p>CHAP. XIIl)</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>but they left these arts to hirelings and inferiors, preferring the
exhilara- tion of keen-witted conversation to the quiet and solitary
pleasures of reading and research. Poetry was sung rather than read, and
perished with the singers.</p>
<p>Medicine was at first a function of the priests, who practised it on
the principle that the Devil had created 99,999 diseases, which should
be treated by a combination of magic and hygiene. They resorted more
frequently to spells than to drugs, on the ground that the spells,
though they might not cure the illness, would not kill the patient —
which was more than could be said for the drugs. 1 ® Nevertheless lay
medicine de- veloped along with the growing wealth of Persia, and in the
time of</p>
<p>Artaxerxes II there was a well-organized guild of physicians and
surgeons, whose fees were fixed by law — as in Hammurabi’s code—
according to the social rank of the patient. 128 Priests were to be
treated free. And just as, among ourselves, the medical novice practises
for a year or two, as in- terne, upon the bodies of the immigrant and
the poor, so among the Persians a young physician was expected to begin
his career by treating infidels and foreigners. The Lord of Light
himself had decreed it:</p>
<p>O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One, if a worshiper of</p>
<p>God wish to practice the art of healing, on whom shall he first</p>
<p>prove his skill — on the worshipers of Ahura-Mazda, or on the
wor-</p>
<p>shipers of the Daevas (the evil spirits)? Ahura-Mazda made answer</p>
<p>and said: On worshipers of the Daevas shall he prove himself, rather
than on worshipers of God. If he treat with the knife a worshiper</p>
<p>of the Daevas and he die; if he treat with the knife a second
wor-</p>
<p>shiper of the Daevas and he die; if he treat with the knife a
third</p>
<p>worshiper of the Daevas and he die, he is unfit forever and</p>
<p>ever; let him never attend any worshiper of God. … If he treat</p>
<p>with the knife a worshiper of the Daevas and he recover; if he</p>
<p>treat with the knife a second worshiper of the Daevas and he re-</p>
<p>cover; if he treat with the knife a third worshiper of the Daevas</p>
<p>and he recover; then he is fit forever and ever; he may at his
will</p>
<p>tr eat worshipers of God, and heal them with the knife.™</p>
<p>Having dedicated themselves to empire, the Persians found their time
and energies taken up with war, and, like the Romans, depended largely
upon imports for their art. They had a taste for pretty things, but they
relied upon foreign or foreign-bom artists to produce them, and upon</p>
<p>378 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>provincial revenues to pay for them. They had beautiful homes and
lux- uriant gardens, which sometimes became hunting-parks or zoological
col- lections; they had costly furniture — tables plated or inlaid with
silver or gold, couches spread with exotic coverlets, floors carpeted
with rugs re- silient in texture and rich in all the colors of earth and
sky ; 131 they drank from golden goblets, and adorned their tables or
their shelves with vases turned by foreign hands;* they liked song and
dance, and the playing of the harp, the flute, the drum and the
tambourine. Jewelry abounded, from tiaras and ear-rings to golden
anklets and shoes; even the men flaunted jewels on necks and ears and
arms. Pearls, rubies, emeralds and lapis lazuli came from abroad, but
turquoise came from the Persian mines, and contributed the customary
material for the aristocrat’s signet -ring. Gems of monstrous and
grotesque form copied the supposed features of favorite devils. The king
sat on a golden throne covered with golden canopies upheld with pillars
of gold . 134</p>
<p>Only in architecture did the Persians achieve a style of their
own.</p>
<p>Under Cyrus, Darius I and Xerxes I they erected tombs and palaces
which archeology has very incompletely exhumed; and it may be that those
prying historians, the pick and the shovel, will in the near future
raise our estimate of Persian art.f At Pasargadae Alexander spared for
us, with</p>
<p>characteristic graciousness, the tomb of Cyrus I. The caravan road
now crosses the bare platform that once bore the palaces of Cyrus and
his mad son; of these nothing survives except a few broken columns here
and there, or a door-jamb bearing the features of Cyrus in bas-relief.
Near- by, on the plain, is the tomb, showing the wear of twenty-four
centuries: a simple stone chapel, quite Greek in restraint and form,
rising to some thirty-five feet in height upon a terraced base. Once,
surely, it was a loftier monument, with some fitting pedestal; today it
seems a little bare and forlorn, having the shape but hardly the
substance of beauty; the cracked and ruined stones merely chasten us
with the quiet permanence of the inanimate. Far south, at
Naksh-i-Rustam, near Persepolis, is the tomb of Darius I, cut like some
Hindu chapel into the face of the moun-</p>

four slender columns about a modest portal; above it, as if on a roof,
figures representing the subject peoples of Persia support a dais on
which the King is shown worshiping Ahura-Mazda and the moon. It is
conceived and executed with aristocratic refinement and simplicity.</p>
<p>The rest of such Persian architecture as has survived the wars,
raids, thefts and weather of two millenniums is composed of palace
ruins. At Ecbatana the early kings built a royal residence of cedar and
cypress, plated with metal, which still stood in the days of Polybius
(ca. 150 b.c.), but of which no sign remains. The most imposing relics
of ancient Persia, now rising day by day out of the grasping and
secretive earth, are the stone steps, platform and columns at
Persepolis; for there each monarch from Darius onward built a palace to
defer the oblivion of his name. The great external stairs that mounted
from the plain to the elevation on which the buildings rested were
unlike anything else in architectural records; de- rived, presumably,
from the flights of steps that approached and encircled the Mesopotamian
ziggurats, they had nevertheless a character specifically their own — so
gradual in ascent and so spacious that ten horsemen could mount them
abreast* 135 They must have formed a brilliant approach to the vast
platform, twenty to fifty feet high, fifteen hundred feet long and one
thousand feet wide, that bore the royal palaces, t Where the two flights
of steps, coming from either side, met at their summit, stood a gate-
way, or propyleum, flanked by winged and human-headed bulls in the worst
Assyrian style. At the right stood the masterpiece of Persian archi-
tecture — the Chehil Minar or Great Hall of Xerxes I, covering, with its
roomy antechambers, an area of more than a hundred thousand square feet
— vaster, if size mattered, than vast Kamak, or any European cathedral
except Milan’s. 138 Another flight of steps led to this Great Hall;
these stairs were flanked with ornamental parapets, and their supporting
sides were carved with the finest bas-reliefs yet discovered in Persia.
188 Thirteen of the once seventy- two columns of Xerxes’ palace stand
among the ruins, like palm-trees in some desolate oasis; and these
marble columns, though mutilated, are among the nearly perfect works of
man. They are slen- derer than any columns of Egypt or Greece, and rise
to the unusual height</p>

<p>of sixty-four feet. Their shafts are fluted with forty-eight small
grooves; their bases resemble bells overlaid with inverted leaves; their
capitals for the most part take the form of floral — almost “Ionic”
volutes, surmounted by the forequarters of two bulls or unicorns upon
whose necks, joined back to back, rested the crossbeam or architrave.
This was surely of wood, for such fragile columns, so wide apart, could
hardly have sup- ported a stone entablature. The door-jambs and
window-frames were of ornamented black stone that shone like ebony; the
walls were of brick, but they were covered with enameled tiles painted
in brilliant panels of animals and flowers; the columns, pilasters and
steps were of fine white limestone or hard blue marble. Behind, or east
of, this Chehil Minar rose the “Hall of a Hundred Columns”; nothing
remains of it but one pillar and the outlines of the general plan.
Possibly these palaces were the most beautiful ever erected in the
ancient or modern world.</p>
<p>At Susa the Artaxerxes I and II built palaces of which only the
foundations survive. They were constructed of brick, redeemed by the
finest glazed tiles known; from Susa comes the famous “Frieze of the
Archers”— prob- ably the faithful “Immortals” who guarded the king. The
stately bow - men seem dressed rather for court ceremony than for war;
their tunics resound with bright colors, their hair and beards are
wondrously curled, their hands bear proudly and stiffly their official
staffs. In Susa, as in the other capitals, painting and sculpture were
dependent arts serving archi- tecture, and the statuary was mostly the
work of artists imported from Assyria, Babylonia and Greece. 1 “</p>
<p>One might say of Persian art, as perhaps of nearly every art, that
all</p>
<p>the elements of it were borrowed. The tomb of Cyrus took its form
from Lydia, the ’slender stone columns improved upon the like pillars
of</p>
<p>Assyria, the colonnades and bas-reliefs acknowledged their
inspiration from Egypt, the animal capitals were an infection from
Nineveh and Babylon. It was the ensemble that made Persian architecture
individual and different — an aristocratic taste that refined the
overwhelming columns of Egypt and the heavy masses of Mesopotamia into
the brilliance and elegance, the proportion and harmony of Persepolis.
The Greeks would hear with wonder and admiration of these halls and
palaces; their busy travelers and observant diplomats would bring them
stimulating word of the art and luxury of Persia. Soon they would
transform the double</p>
<p>volutes and stiff-necked animals of these graceful pillars into the
smooth lobes of the Ionic capital; and they would shorten and strengthen
the shafts to make them bear any entablature, whether of wood or of
stone.</p>

<p>The empire of Darius lasted hardly a century. The moral as well
as</p>
<p>the physical backbone of Persia was broken by Marathon, Salamis and
Plataea; the emperors exchanged Mars for Venus, and the nation descended
into corruption and apathy. The decline of Persia anticipated almost in
detail the decline of Rome: immorality and degeneration among the people
accompanied violence and negligence on the throne. The Persians, like
the Medes before them, passed from stoicism to epicureanism in a few
generations. Eating became the principal occupation of the aristocracy:
these men who had once made it a rule to eat but once a day now inter-
preted the rule to allow them one meal — prolonged from noon to night;
they stocked their larders with a thousand delicacies, and often served
entire animals to their guests; they stuffed themselves with rich rare
meats, and spent their genius upon new sauces and desserts . 1 “ 4 A
corrupt and corrupting multitude of menials filled the houses of the
wealthy, while drunkenness became the common vice of every class. 110b
Cyrus and Darius created Persia, Xerxes inherited it, his successors
destroyed it.</p>
<p>Xerxes I was every inch a king — externally; tall and vigorous, he
was by royal consent the handsomest man in his empire . 111 But there
was never yet a handsome man who was not vain, nor any physically vain
man whom some woman has not led by the nose. Xerxes was divided by many
mistresses, and became for his people an exemplar of sensuality. His
defeat at Salamis was in the nature of things; for he was great only in
his love of magnitude, not in his capacity to rise to a crisis or to be
in fact and need a king. After twenty years of sexual intrigue and
administrative indolence he was murdered by a courtier, Artabanus, and
was buried with regal pomp and general satisfaction.</p>
<p>Only the records of Rome after Tiberius could rival in bloodiness the
royal annals of Persia. The murderer of Xerxes was murdered by</p>
<p>382 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XIII</p>
<p>Artaxerxes I, who, after a long reign, was succeeded by Xerxes II,
who was murdered a few weeks later by his half-brother Sogdianus, who
was murdered six months later by Darius II, who suppressed the revolt of
Terituchmes by having him slain, his wife cut into pieces, and his
mother, brothers and sisters buried alive. Darius II was followed by his
son</p>
<p>Artaxerxes II, who at the battle of Cunaxa, had to fight to the death
his own brother, the younger Cyrus, when the youth tried to seize the
royal power. Artaxerxes II enjoyed a long reign, killed his son Darius
for con- spiracy, and died of a broken heart on finding that another
son, Ochus, was planning to assassinate him. Ochus ruled for twenty
years, and was poisoned by his general Bagoas. This iron-livered Warwick
placed Arses, son of Ochus, on the throne, assassinated Arses’ brothers
to make Arses secure, then assassinated Arses and his infant children,
and gave the sceptre to Codomannus, a safely effeminate friend.
Codomannus reigned for eight years under the name of Darius III, and
died in battle against Alex- ander at Arbela, in the final ruin of his
country. Not even the democ- racies of our time have known such
indiscriminate leadership.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of an empire to disintegrate soon, for the energy
that created it disappears from those who inherit it, at the very time
that its subject peoples are gathering strength to fight for their lost
liberty.</p>
<p>Nor is it natural that nations diverse in language, religion, morals
and traditions should long remain united; there is nothing organic in
such a union, and compulsion must repeatedly be applied to maintain the
artificial bond. In its two hundred years of empire Persia did nothing
to lessen this heterogeneity, these centrifugal forces; she was content
to rule a mob of nations, and never thought of making them into a state.
Year by year the union became more difficult to preserve. As the vigor
of the emperors relaxed, the boldness and ambition of the satraps grew;
they purchased or intimidated the generals and secretaries who were
supposed to share and limit their power, they arbitrarily enlarged their
armies and revenues, and engaged in recurrent plots against the king.
The frequency of revolt and war exhausted the vitality of little Persia;
the braver stocks were slaughtered in battle after battle, until none
but the cautious survived; and when these were conscripted to face Alex-
ander they proved to be cowards almost to a man. No improvements had
been made in the training or equipment of the troops, or in the tactics
of the generals; these blundered childishly against Alexander, while
their disorderly ranks, armed mostly with darts, proved to be mere
targets</p>

<p>for the long spears and solid phalanxes of the Macedonians. 113
Alexander frolicked, but only after the battle was won; the Persian
leaders brought their concubines with them, and had no ambition for war.
The only real soldiers in the Persian army were the Greeks.</p>
<p>From the day when Xerxes turned back defeated from Salamis, it be-
came evident that Greece would one day challenge the empire. Persia
controlled one end of the great trade route that bound western Asia with
the Mediterranean, Greece controlled the other; and the ancient acquisi-
tiveness and ambition of men made such a situation provocative of war.
As soon as Greece found a master who could give her unity, she would
attack.</p>
<p>Alexander crossed the Hellespont without opposition, having what</p>
<p>seemed to Asia a negligible force of 30,000 footmen and 5,000
cavalry.* A Persian army of 40,000 troops tried to stop him at the
Granicus; the Greeks lost 115 men, the Persians 2 0,000. 111 Alexander
marched south and east, taking cities and receiving surrenders for a
year. Meanwhile Darius III gathered a horde of 600,000 soldiers and
adventurers; five days were required to march them over a bridge of
boats across the Euphrates; six hundred mules and three hundred camels
were needed to carry the royal purse. 116 When the two armies met at
Issus Alexander had no more than 30,000 followers; but Darius, with all
the stupidity that destiny could require, had chosen a field in which
only a small part of his multitude could fight at one time. When the
slaughter was over the Macedonians had lost some 450, the Persians 1
10,000 men, most of these being slain in wild retreat; Alexander, in
reckless pursuit, crossed a stream on a bridge of Persian corpses. 116
Darius fled ignominiously, abandoning his mother, a wife, two daughters,
his chariot, and his luxuriously appointed tent. Alexander treated the
Persian ladies with a chivalry that surprised the Greek historians,
contenting himself with marrying one of the daughters. If we may believe
Quintus Curtius, the mother of Darius became so fond of Alexander that
after his death she put an end to her own life by volun- tary
starvation. 117</p>
<p>The young conqueror turned aside now with what seemed foolhardy
leisureliness to establish his control over all of western Asia; he did
not wish to advance farther without organizing his conquests and
building a secure line of communications. The citizens of Babylon, like
those of</p>
<ul>
<li>“All those that were in Asia,” says Josephus, “were persuaded that
the Macedonians</li>
</ul>
<p>384 the story of civilization (chap. XIII</p>
<p>Jerusalem, came out en masse to welcome him, offering him their city
and their gold; he accepted these graciously, and pleased them by re-
storing the temples which the unwise Xerxes had destroyed. Darius</p>
<p>sent him a proposal of peace, saying that he would give Alexander ten
thousand talents* for the safe return of his mother, his wife and his
children, would offer him his daughter in marriage, and would acknowl-
edge his sovereignty over all Asia west of the Euphrates, if only
Alexander would end the war and become his friend. Parmenio, second in
command among the Greeks, said that if he were Alexander he would be
glad to accept such happy terms, and avoid with honor the hazard of some
disas- trous defeat. Alexander remarked that he would do likewise — if
he were Parmenio. Being Alexander, he answered Darius that his offer
meant nothing, since he, Alexander, already possessed such parts of Asia
as Darius proposed to cede to him, and could marry the daughter of the
emperor when he pleased. Darius, despairing of peace with so reckless a
logician, turned unwillingly to the task of collecting another and
larger force.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alexander had taken Tyre, and annexed Egypt; now he</p>
<p>marched back across the great empire, straight to its distant
capitals. In twenty days from Babylon his army reached Susa, and took it
without resistance; thence it advanced so quickly to Persepolis that the
guards of the royal treasury had no time to secrete its funds. There
Alexander committed one of the most unworthy acts of his incredible
career: against the counsel of Parmenio, and (we are told) to please the
courtesan Thais, t he burned the palaces of Persepolis to the ground,
and permitted his troops to loot the city. Then, having raised the
spirits of his army with booty and gifts, he turned north to meet Darius
for the last time.</p>
<p>Darius had gathered, chiefly from his eastern provinces, a new army
of a million men 148 — Persians, Medes, Babylonians, Syrians, Armenians,
Cappadocians, Bactrians, Sogdians, Arachosians, Sacae and Hindus — and
had equipped them no longer with bows and arrows, but with javelins,
spears, shields, horses, elephants, and scythe-wielding chariots
intended to mow down the enemy like wheat; with this vast force old Asia
would make one more effort to preserve itself from adolescent Europe.
Alex- ander, with 7,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, met the motley mob
at</p>
<p>f Probably equivalent to 0,000,000 in contemporary currencies.</p>
<p>t Plutarch, Quintus Curtius and Diodorus agree on this tale, and it
does not do violence to Alexander’s impetuous character; but one may
meet the story with a certain scepticism none the less.</p>

<p>Gaugamela,* and by superior weapons, generalship and courage de-
stroyed it in a day. Darius again chose the better part of valor, but
his generals, disgusted with this second flight, murdered him in his
tent. Alexander put to death such of the assassins as he could find,
sent the body of Darius in state to Persepolis, and ordered it to be
buried in the manner of the Achaemenid kings. The Persian people flocked
readily to the standard of the conquerer, charmed by his generosity and
his youth. Alexander organized Persia into a province of the Macedonian
Empire, left a strong garrison to guard it, and marched on to India.</p>
