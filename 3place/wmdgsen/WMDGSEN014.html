Foundations of India</h4>
<p>I. SCENE OF THE DRAMA</p>
<p>The rediscovery of India — A glance at the map — Climatic in-</p>
<p>fluences</p>
<p>N OTHING should more deeply shame the modem student than the recency
and inadequacy of his acquaintance with India. Here is</p>
<p>a vast peninsula of nearly two million square miles; two-thirds as
large as the United States, and twenty times the size of its master,
Great Britain; 320,000,000 souls, more than in all North and South
America combined, or one-fifth of the population of the earth; an
impressive continuity of development and civilization from Mohenjo-daro,
2900 b.c. or earlier, to Gandhi, Raman and Tagore; faiths compassing
every stage from bar- barous idolatry to the most subtle and spiritual
pantheism; philosophers playing a thousand variations on one monistic
theme from the Upanishads eight centuries before Christ to Shankara
eight centuries after him;</p>
<p>scientists developing astronomy three thousand years ago, and winning
Nobel prizes in our own time; a democratic constitution of untraceable
antiquity in the villages, and wise and beneficent rulers like Ashoka
and Akbar in the capitals; minstrels singing great epics almost as old
as Homer, and poets holding world audiences today; artists raising
gigantic temples for Hindu gods from Tibet to Ceylon and from Cambodia
to Java, or</p>
<p>carving perfect palaces by the score for Mogul kings and queens —
this is the India that patient scholarship is now opening up, like a new
in- tellectual continent, to that Western mind which only yesterday
thought civilization an exclusively European thing.*</p>
<p>•From the time of Megasthenes, who described India to Greec e ca. 302
b.c., down to the eighteenth century, India was all a marvel and a
mystery to Europe. Marco Polo (1254-1323 a.d.) pictured its western
fringe vaguely, Columbus blundered upon America in trying to reach it,
Vasco da Gama sailed around Africa to rediscover it, and merchants spoke
rapaciously of “the wealth of the Indies.” But scholars left the mine
almost un - tapped. A Dutch missionary to India, Abraham Roger, made a
beginning with his Open Door to the Hidden Heathendom (1651); Dryden
showed his alertness by writing the play Aurangzeb (1675); and an
Austrian monk, Fra Paolino de S. Bartolomeo, advanced</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>39 2 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>The scene of the history is a great triangle narrowing down from the
ever- lasting snows of the Himalayas to the eternal heat of Ceylon. In a
comer at the left lies Persia, close akin to Vedic India in people,
language and gods. Following the northern frontier eastward we strike
Afghanistan; here is Kandahar, the ancient Gandhara, where Greek and
Hindu* sculpture fused for a while, and then parted never to meet again;
and north of it is Kabul, from which the Moslems and the Moguls made
those bloody raids that gave them India for a thousand years. Within the
Indian frontier, a short day’ s ride from Kabul, is Peshawar, where the
old northern habit of invading die south still persists. Note how near
to India Russia comes at the Pamirs and the passes of the Hindu Kush;
hereby will hang much politics. Directly at the northern tip of India is
the province of Kashmir, whose very name recalls the ancient glory of
India’s textile crafts. South of it is the Punjab— i.e., “Land of the
Five Rivers”— with the great city of Lahore, and Shimla, sum- mer
capital at the foot of the Himalayas (“Home of the Snow”). Through the
western Punjab runs the mighty river Indus, a thousand miles in
length;</p>
<p>he matter with two Sanskrit grammars and a treatise on the Systema
Brahmanicum (i792). la In 1789 Sir William Jones opened his career as
one of the greatest of Indolo- gists by translating Kalidasa’s
Shakuntala; this translation, re -rendered into German in 1791,
profoundly affected Herder and Goethe, and — through the Schlegels — the
entire Romantic movement, which hoped to find in the East all the
mysticism and mystery that seemed to have died on the approach of
science and Enlightenment in the West. Jones startled the world of
scholarship by declaring that Sanskrit was cousin to all the languages
of Europe, and an indication of our racial kinship with the Vedic
Hindus; these announce- ments almost created modem philology and
ethnology. In 1805 Colebrooke’s essay On the Vedas revealed to Europe
the oldest product of Indian literature; and about the same time
Anquetil- Duperron’s translation of a Pe rsian translation of the
Upanishads acquainted Schelling and Schopenhauer with what the latter
called the profoundest phi- losophy that he had ever read. 2 Buddhism
was practically unknown as a system of thought until Bumouf’s Essai sur
le Pali (1826)— i.e., on the language of the Buddhist documents. Bumouf
in France, and his pupil Max Muller in England, roused scholars and
philanthropists to make possible a translation of all the “Sacred Books
of the East”;</p>
<ul>
<li>The word Indian will be used in this Book as applying to India in
general; the word Hindu , for variety’s sake, wi ll occasionally be used
in the same sense, following the cus- tom of the Persians and the
Greeks; but where any confusion might result, Hindu will be used in its
later and stricter sense, as referring only to those inhabitants of
India who (as distinct from Moslem Indians) accept one of the native
faiths.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 393</p>
<p>its name came from the native word for river, sindhu , which the
Persians (changing it to Hindu) applied to all northern India in their
word Hindustan — i.e., “Land of the Rivers.” Out of this Persian term
Hindu the invading Greeks made for us the word India.</p>
<p>From the Punjab the Jumna and the Ganges flow leisurely to the south-
east; the Jumna waters the new capital at Delhi, and mirrors the Taj
Mahal at Agra; the Ganges broadens down to the Holy City, Benares,
washes ten million devotees daily, and fertilizes with its dozen mouths
the province of Bengal and the old British capital at Calcutta. Still
farther east is Burma, with the golden pagodas of Rangoon and the sunlit
road to Mandalay. From Mandalay back across India to the western airport
at Karachi is almost as long a flight as from New York to Los Angeles.
South of the Indus, on such a flight, one would pass over Rajputana,
land of the heroic Rajputs, with its famed cities of Gwalior and Chitor,
Jaipur, Ajmer and Udaipur. South and west is the “Presidency” or
province of Bombay, with teeming cities at Surat, Ahmedabad, Bombay and
Poona. East and south lie the progressive native-ruled states of
Hyderabad and Mysore, with picturesque capitals of the same names. On
the west coast is Goa, and on the eastern coast is Pondi- cherry, where
the conquering British have left to the Portuguese and the French
respectively a few square miles of territorial consolation. Along the
Bay of Bengal the Madras Presidency runs, with the well-governed city of
Madras as its center, and the sublime and gloomy temples of Tanjore,
Trichi- nopoly, Madura and Rameshvaram adorning its southern boundaries.
And th en “Adam’s Bridge”— a reef of sunken islands — beckons us across
the strait to Ceylon, where civilization flourished sixteen hundred
years ago. All these are a little part of India.</p>
<p>We must conceive it, then, not as a nation, like Egypt, Babylonia,
or</p>
<p>England, but as a continent as populous and polyglot as Europe, and
almost as varied in climate and race, ill literature, philosophy and
art. The north is harassed by cold blasts from the Himalayas, and by the
fogs that form when these blasts meet the southern sun. In the Punjab
the rivers have created great alluvial plains of unsurpassed fertility ;
4 but south of the river-valleys the sun rules as an unchecked despot,
the plains are dry and bare, and require for their fruitful tillage no
mere husbandry but an almost stupefying slavery. 5 Englishmen do not
stay in India more than five years at a time; and if a hundred thousand
of them rule three thousand times their number of Hindus it is because
they have not stayed there long enough.</p>
<p>Here and there, constituting one-fifth of the land, the primitive
jungle remains, a breeding-place of tigers, leopards, wolves and snakes.
In the</p>
<p>394 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>southern third, or Deccan,* the heat is drier, or is tempered with
breezes from the sea. But from Delhi to Ceylon the dominating fact in
India is heat: heat that has weakened the physique, shortened the youth,
and affected the quietist religion and philosophy of the inhabitants.
The only relief from this heat is to sit still, to do nothing, to desire
nothing; or in the summer months the monsoon wind may bring cooling
moisture and fertilizing rain from the sea. When the monsoon fails to
blow, India</p>
<p>starves, and dreams of Nirvana.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE OLDEST CIVILIZATION?</li>
</ol>
<p>Prehistoric India — Mohenjo-daro — Its antiquity</p>
<p>In the days when historians supposed that history had begun with</p>
<p>Greece, Europe gladly believed that India had been a hotbed of
barbarism until the “Aryan” cousins of the European peoples had migrated
from the shores of the Caspian to bring the arts and sciences to a
savage and benighted peninsula. Recent researches have marred this
comforting pic- ture — as future researches will change the perspective
of these pages. In India, as elsewhere, the beginnings of civilization
are buried in the earth, and not all the spades of archeology will ever
quite exhume them. Re- mains of an Old Stone Age fill many cases in the
museums of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay; and neolithic objects have been
found in nearly every state. 0 These, however, were cultures, not yet a
civilization.</p>
<p>In 1924 the world of scholarship was again aroused by news from</p>
<p>India: Sir John Marshall announced that his Indian aides, R. D.
Banerji in particular, had discovered at Mohenjo-daro, on the western
bank of the lower Indus, remains of what seemed to be an older
civilization than any yet known to historians. There, and at Harappa, a
few hundred miles to the north, four or five superimposed cities were
excavated, with hun- dreds of solidly-built brick houses and shops,
ranged along wide streets as well as narrow lanes, and rising in many
cases to several stories. Let Sir John estimate the age of these
remains:</p>
<p>These discoveries establish the existence in Sind (the
northernmost</p>
<p>province of the Bombay Presidency) and the Punjab, during the</p>
<p>fourth and third millennium b.c., of a highly developed city life;
and</p>
<ul>
<li>From dakshina , “right hand” (Latin dexter ) ; secondarily meaning
“south,” since south - ern India is on the right hand of a worshiper
facing the rising sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. Xiv) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 395</p>
<p>he presence, in many of the houses, of wells and bathrooms as well as
an elaborate drainage-system, betoken a social condition of the</p>
<p>citizens at least equal to that found in Sumer, and superior to
that</p>
<p>prevailing in contemporary Babylonia and Egypt…. Even at Ur</p>
<p>he houses are by no means equal in point of construction to those</p>
<p>of Mohenjo- daro.’</p>
<p>Among the finds at these sites were household utensils and toilet
out- fits; pottery painted and plain, hand-turned and turned on the
wheel; terracottas, dice and chess-men; coins older than any previously
known; over a thousand seals, most of them engraved, and inscribed in an
un- known pictographic script; faience work of excellent quality; stone
carv- ing superior to that of the Sumerians; 8 copper weapons and
implements, and a copper model of a two- wheeled cart (one of our oldest
examples of a wheeled vehicle) ; gold and silver bangles, ear-ornaments,
necklaces, and other jewelry “so well finished and so highly polished,”
says Marshall, “that they might have come out of a Bond Street jeweler’s
of today</p>
<p>rather than from a prehistoric house of 5,000 years ago.” 8</p>
<p>Strange to say, the lowest strata of these remains showed a more de-
veloped art than the upper layers — as if even the most ancient deposits
were from a civilization already hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years
old. Some of the implements were of stone, some of copper, some of
bronze, suggesting that this Indus culture had arisen in a Chalcolithic
Age — i.e., in a transition from stone to bronze as the material of
tools. 10 The indications are that Mohenjo-daro was at its height when
Cheops built the first great pyramid; that it had commercial, religious
and artistic connections with Sumeria and Babylonia;* and that it
survived over three thousand years, until the third century before
Christ. t“ We cannot tell</p>
<p>These connections are suggested by similar seals found at
Mohenjo-daro and in Sumeria (especially at Kish), and by the appearance
of the Naga, or hooded serpent, among the early Mesopotamian seals. 11
In 1932 Dr. Henri Frankfort unearthed, in the ruins of a
Babylonian-Elamite village at the modem Tell-Asmar (near Baghdad),
pottery seals and beads which in his judgment (Sir John Marshall
concurring) were imported from Mohenjo- daro ca. 2000 b. c “</p>
<p>Macdonell believes that this amazing civilization was derived from
Sumeria; 14 Hall be- lieves that the Sumerians derived their culture
from India; 15 Woolley derives both the Sumerians and the early Hindus
from some common parent stock and culture in or near Baluchistan. 18
Investigators have been struck by the fact that similar seals found both
in Babylonia and in India belong to the earliest (“pre - Sumerian”)
phase of the Mesopo - tamian culture, but to the latest phase of the
Indus civilization 17 — which suggests the pri- ority of India. Childe
inclines to this conclusion: “By the end of the fourth millennium</p>
<p>39 &lt;5 the story of civilization (chap, xiv</p>
<p>yet whether, as Marshall believes, Mohenjo-daro represents the oldest
of all civilizations known. But the exhuming of prehistoric India has
just begun; only in our time has archeology turned from Egypt across
Meso- potamia to India. When the soil of India has been turned up like
that of Egypt we shall probably find there a civilization older than
that which flowered out of the mud of the Nile.*</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>THE INDO-ARYANS</li>
</ol>
<p>The natives — The invaders — The village community — Caste — War-
riors — Priests — Merchants — W orkers — Outcastes</p>
<p>Despite the continuity of the remains in Sind and Mysore, we feel
that between the heyday of Mohenjo-daro and the advent of the Aryans a
great gap stands in our knowledge; or rather that our knowledge of the
past is an occasional gap in our ignorance. Among the Indus relics is a
peculiar seal, composed of two serpent heads, which was the
characteristic symbol of the oldest historic people of India — those
serpent-worshiping Nagas whom the invading Aryans found in possession of
the northern provinces, and whose descendants still linger in the
remoter hills.” Farther south the land was occupied by a dark-skinned,
broad-nosed people whom, without knowing the origin of the word, we call
Dravidians. They were already a civilized people when the Aryans broke
down upon them;</p>
<p>heir adventurous merchants sailed the sea even to Sumeria and
Babylon, and their cities knew many refinements and luxuries.” It was
from</p>
<p>hem, apparently, that the Aryans took their village community and
their systems of land- tenure and taxation.” To this day the Deccan is
still</p>
<p>essentially Dravidian in stock and customs, in language, literature
and arts.</p>
<p>b.c. the material culture of Abydos, Ur, or Mohenjo-daro would stand
comparison with that of Periclean Athens or of any medieval town….
Judging by the domestic architec- ture, the seal-cutting, and the grace
of the pottery, the Indus civilization was ahead of the Babylonian at
the beginning of the third millennium (ca. 3000 b.c.). But that was a
late phase of the Indian culture; it may have enjoyed no less lead in
earlier times. Were then the innovations and discoveries that
characterize proto-Sumerian civilization not native de- velopments on
Babylonian soil, but the results of Indian inspiration? If so, had the
Sumerians themselves come from the Indus, or at least from regions in
its immediate sphere of influence?” 18 These fascinating questions
cannot yet be answered; but they serve</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent excavations near Chitaldrug, in Mysore, revealed six levels
of buried cultures, rising from Stone Age implements and geometrically
adorned pottery apparently as old as 4000 b.c., to remains as late as
1200 a.d. 19</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP, xrv) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 397</p>
<p>The invasion and conquest of these flourishing tribes by the
Aryans</p>
<p>was part of that ancient process whereby, periodically, the north has
swept down violently upon the settled and pacified south; this has been
one of the main streams of history, on which civilizations have risen
and fallen like epochal undulations. The Aryans poured down upon the</p>
<p>Dravidians, the Achaeans and Dorians upon the Cretans and ASgeans,
the Germans upon the Romans, the Lombards upon the Italians, the English
upon the world. Forever the north produces rulers and warriors, the
south produces artists and saints, and the meek inherit heaven.</p>
<p>Who were these marauding Aryans? They themselves used the term as
meaning noblemen (Sanskrit ary a, noble), but perhaps this patriotic
derivation is one of those after-thoughts which cast scandalous gleams
of humor into philology.* Very probably they came from that Caspian
region which their Persian cousins called Airy ana-vae jo — “The Aryan
home.”f About the same time that the Aryan Kassites overran Babylonia,
the Vedic Aryans began to enter India.</p>
<p>Like the Germans invading Italy, these Aryans were rather immigrants
than conquerors. But they brought with them strong physiques, a hearty
appetite in both solids and liquids, a ready brutality, a skill and
courage in war, which soon gave them the mastery of northern India. They
fought with bows and arrows, led by armored warriors in chariots, who
wielded battle-axes and hurled spears. They were too primitive to be
hypocrites: they subjugated India without pretending to elevate it. They
wanted land, and pasture for their cattle; their word for war said
nothing about national honor, but simply meant “a desire for more
cows.”” Slowly they made their way eastward along the Indus and the
Ganges, until all Hin- dustanj was under their control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monier-Williams derives Aryan from the Sanskrit root ri-ar, to
plough;“ cf. the Latin aratrum, a plough, and area , an open space. On
this theory the word Aryan originally meant not nobleman but
peasant.</li>
</ul>
<p>fWe find such typically Vedic deities as Indra, Mitra and Varuna
mentioned in a treaty concluded by the Aryan Hittites and Mitannians at
the beginning of the fourteenth century b.c.;” and so characteristic a
Vedic ritual as the drinking of the sacred soma juice is repeated in the
Persian ceremony of drinking the sap of the haoma plant. (Sanskrit s
corresponds regularly to Zend or Persian h: soma becomes haoma, as
sindhu becomes Hindu. 25 ) We conclude that the Mitannians, the
Hittites, the Kassites, the Sogdians, the Bactrians, the Medes, the
Persians, and the Aryan invaders of India were branches of an already
heterogeneous “Indo - European” stock which spread out from the shores
of the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>A word applied by the ancient Persians to India north of the Narbada
River.</p>
<p>398 the story of civilization (chap. XIV</p>
<p>As they passed from armed warfare to settled tillage their tribes
grad- ually coalesced into petty states. Each state was ruled by a king
checked by a council of warriors; each tribe was led by a raja or
chieftain limited in his power by a tribal council; each tribe was
composed of comparatively independent village communities governed by
assemblies of family heads. “Have you heard, Ananda,” Buddha is
represented as asking his St. John, “that the Vajjians foregather often,
and frequent public meetings of their clans?… So long, Ananda, as the
Vajjians foregather thus often, and frequent the public meetings of
their clan, so long may they be expected not to decline, but to
prosper.””</p>
<p>Like all peoples, the Aryans had rules of endogamy and exogamy-</p>
<p>forbidding marriage outside the racial group or within near degrees
of kinship. From these rules came the most characteristic of Hindu
institu- tions. Outnumbered by a subject people whom they considered
inferior to themselves, the Aryans foresaw that without restrictions on
inter- marriage they would soon lose their racial identity; in a century
or two they would be assimilated and absorbed. The first caste division,
there- fore, was not by status but by color;* it divided long noses from
broad noses, Aryans from Nagas and Dravidians; it was merely the
marriage regulation of an endogamous group. 28 In its later profusion of
hereditary, racial and occupational divisions the caste system hardly
existed in Vedic times.* Among the Aryans themselves marriage (except of
near kin) was free, and status was not defined by birth.</p>
<p>As Vedic India (2000- 1000 b.c.) passed into the “Heroic” age (1000
-500 b.c.) — i.e., as India changed from the conditions pictured in the
Vedas into those described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana —
occupations became more specialized and hereditary, and caste divisions
were more rigidly defined. At the top were the Kshatriyas, or fighters,
who held it a sin to die in bed. 80 Even the religious ceremonials were
in the early days performed by chieftains or kings, in the fashion of
Csesar playing Pontifex; the Brahmans or priests were then mere
assistants at the sacrifice. 81 In the Ramayana a Kshatriya protests
passionately against mating a “proud and peerless bride” of warrior
stock to “a prating priest and Brahman”; 82 the Jain books take for
granted the leadership of the Kshatriyas, and the Buddhist literature
goes so far as to call the Brahmans “low - born.”” Even in India things
change.</p>
<p>•The early Hindu word for caste is vama, color. This was translated
by the Portu- guese invaders as casta , from the Latin castus y
pure.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 399</p>
<p>But as war gradually gave way to peace — and as religion, being then
largely an aide to agriculture in the face of the incalculable elements,
grew in social importance and ritual complexity, and required expert in-
termediaries between men and gods — the Brahmans increased in number,
wealth and power. As educators of the young, and oral transmitters of
the race’s history, literature and laws, they were able to recreate the
past and form the future in their own image, moulding each generation
into greater reverence for the priests, and building for their caste a
prestige which would, in later centuries, give them the supreme place in
Hindu society. Already in Buddha’s days they had begun to challenge
the</p>
<p>supremacy of the Kshatriyas; they pronounced these warriors inferior,
even as the Kshatriyas pronounced the priests inferior; 84 and Buddha
felt that there w as much to be said for both points of view. Even in
Buddha’s time, however, the Kshatriyas had not conceded intellectual
leadership to the Brahmans; and the Buddhist movement itself, founded by
a Ksha- triya noble, contested the religious hegemony of India with the
Brahmans for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Below these ruling minorities were the Vaisyas, merchants and free-
men hardly distinct as a caste before Buddha, the Shudras, or working-
men, who comprised most of the native population; and finally the Out-
castes or Pariahs — unconverted native tribes like the Chandalas, war
cap- tives, and men reduced to slavery as a punishment. 86 Out of this
originally small group of casteless men grew the 40,000,000
“Untouchables” of India today.</p>

<p>How did these Aryan Indians live? At first by war and spoliation;
then by herding, tillage and industry in a rural routine not unlike that
of</p>
<p>medieval Europe; for until the Industrial Revolution in which we
live, the basic economic and political life of man had remained
essentially the same since neolithic days. The Indo-Aryans raised
cattle, used the cow without considering it sacred, and ate meat when
they could afford it, having offered a morsel to priests or gods; 86
Buddha, after nearly starving himself in his ascetic youth, seems to
have died from a hearty meal of pork.” They planted barley, but
apparently knew nothing of rice in</p>
<p>Vedic times. The fields were divided by each village community
among</p>
<p>400 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>its constituent families, but were irrigated in common; the land
could not be sold to an outsider, and could be bequeathed only to the
family heirs in direct male line. The majority of the people were yeomen
owning their own soil; the Aryans held it a disgrace to work for hire.
There</p>
<p>were, we are assured, no landlords and no paupers, no millionaires
and no slums. 8 *</p>
<p>In the towns handicrafts flourished among independent artisans and
apprentices, organized, half a thousand years before Christ, into
powerful guilds of metal-workers, wood-workers, stone-workers,
leather-workers, ivory-workers, basket-makers, house-painters,
decorators, potters, dyers, fishermen, sailors, hunters, trappers,
butchers, confectioners, barbers, shampooers, florists, cooks — the very
list reveals the fulness and vari- ety of Indo-Aryan life. The guilds
settled intra-guild affairs, even</p>
<p>arbitrating difficulties between members and their wives. Prices were
de- termined, as among ourselves, not by supply and demand but by the
gullibility of the purchaser; in the palace of the king, however, was an
official Valuer who, like our secretive Bureau of Standards, tested
goods to be bought, and dictated terms to the makers. 88</p>
<p>Trade and travel had advanced to the stage of horse and two-wheeled
wagon, but were still medievally difficult; caravans were held up by
taxes at every petty frontier, and as like as not by highwaymen at any
turn. Transport by river and sea was more developed: about 860 b.c.
ships with modest sails and hundreds of oars carried to Mesopotamia,
Arabia and Egypt such typical Indian products as perfumes and spices,
cotton and silk, shawls and muslins, pearls and rubies, ebony and
precious stones, and ornate brocades of silver and gold.“</p>
<p>Trade was stunted by clumsy methods of exchange — at first by barter,
then by the use of cattle as currency; brides like Homer’s “oxen
-bearing maidens” were bou ght with cows. 11 Later a heavy copper
coinage was issued, guaranteed, however, only by private individuals.
There were no banks; hoarded money was hidden in the house, or buried in
the ground, or deposited with a friend. Out of this, in Buddha’s age, g
rew a credit system: merchants in different towns facilitated trade by
giving one another letters of credit; loans could be obtained from such
Roths- childs at eighteen per cent,“ and there was much talk of
promissory notes. The coinage was not sufficiently inconvenient to
discourage</p>
<p>gambling; already dice were essential to civilization. In many cases
gam- bling halls were provided for his subjects by the king, in the
fashion, if</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 4 01</p>
<p>not quite in the style, of Monaco; and a portion of the receipts went
to the royal treasury. 48 It seems a scandalous arrangement to us, who
are not quite accustomed to having our gambling institutions contribute
so directly to the support of our public officials.</p>
<p>Commercial morality stood on a high level. The kings of Vedic India,
as of Homeric Greece, were not above lifting cattle from their
neighbors; 44 but the Greek historian of Alexander’s campaigns describes
the Hindus as “remarkable for integrity, so reasonable as se ldom to
have recourse to lawsuits, and so honest as to require neither locks to
their doors nor writings to bind their agreements; they are in the
highest degree truth- ful.” 4 * The Rig -veda speaks of incest,
seduction, prostitution, abortion and adultery, 40 and there are some
signs of homosexuality;“ but the general picture that we derive from the
Vedas and the epics is one of high stand- ards in the relations of the
sexes and the life of the family.</p>
<p>Marriage might be entered into by forcible abduction of the bride, by
purchase of her, or by mutual consent. Marriage by consent, however, was
considered slightly disreputable; women thought it more honorable to be
bought and paid for, and a great compliment to be stolen “ Polyg - amy
was permitted, and was encouraged among the great; it was an act of
merit to support several wives, and to transmit ability.“ The story of
Draupadi, 50 who married five brothers at once, indicates the occasional
occurrence, in Epic days, of that strange polyandry — the marriage of
one woman to several men, usually brothers — which survived in Ceylon
till 1859, and still lingers in the mountain villages of Tibet.* 1 But
polyg- amy was usually the privilege of the male, who ruled the Aryan
house- hold with patriarchal omnipotence. He held the right of ownership
over his wives and his children, and might in certain cases sell them or
cast them out.* 8</p>
<p>Nevertheless, woman enjoyed far greater freedom in the Vedic period
than in later India. She had more to say in the choice of her mate than
the forms of marriage might suggest. She appeared freely at feasts and
dances, and joined with men in religious sacrifice. She could study, and
might, like Gargi, engage in philosophic disputation. 03 If she was left
a widow there were no restrictions upon her remarriage.* 4 In the Heroic
Age woman seems to have lost something of this liberty. She was dis-
couraged from mental pursuits, on the ground that “for a woman to study
the Vedas indicates confusion in the realm;”** t he remarriage of widows
became uncommon; purdah — the seclusion of women — began; and the</p>
<p>4° 2 the story of civilization (chap. XIV</p>
<p>practice of suttee, almost unknown in Vedic times, increased.” The
ideal woman was now typified in the heroine of the Ramayana — that
faithful Sita who follows and obeys her husband humbly, through every
test of fidelity and courage, until her death.</p>
<p>V. THE RELIGION OF THE VEDAS</p>
<p>Pre-Vedic religion — V edic gods — Moral gods — The Vedic story</p>
<p>of Creation — Immortality — The horse sacrifice</p>
<p>The oldest known religion of India, which the invading Aryans found
among the Nagas, and which still survives in the ethnic nooks and
crannies of the great peninsula, was apparently an animistic and totemic
worship of multitudinous spirits dwelling in stones and animals, in
trees and streams, in mountains and stars. Snakes and serpents were
divinities — idols and ideals of virile reproductive power; and the
sacred Bodhi tree of Buddha’s time was a vestige of the mystic but
wholesome reverence for the quiet majesty of trees.” Naga, the dragon
-god, Hanuman the monkey-god, Nandi the divine bull, and the Yakshas or
tree-gods passed down into the religion of historic India.” Since some
of these spirits were good and some evil, only great skill in magic
could keep the body from being possessed or tortured, in sickness or
mania, by one or more of the innumerable demons that filled the air.
Hence the medley of incantations in the</p>
<p>Atharva-veda, or Book of the Knowledge of Magic; one must recite
spells to obtain children, to avoid abortion, to prolong life, to ward
off evil, to woo sleep, to destroy or harass enemies.* 50</p>
<p>The earliest gods of the Vedas were the forces and elements of nature
herself — sky, sun, earth, fire, light, wind, water and sex. 02 Dyaus
(the Greek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter) was at first the sky itself; and the
Sans - krit word deva, which later was to mean divine, originally meant
only bright. By that poetic license which makes so many deities, these
natural objects were personified; the sky, for example, became a father,
Varuna; the earth became a mother, Prithivi; and vegetation was the
fruit of their union through the rain.” The rain was the god Par j any
a, fire was Agni, the wind was Vayu, the pestilential wind was Rudra,
the storm was Indra,</p>
<p>*Cf. Atharva- veda , vi, 138, and vii, 35, 90, where incantations
“bristling with hatred,” and “language of unbridled wildness” are used
by women seeking to oust their rivals, or to make them barren. 60 In the
Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (6-12) formulas are given for raping a woman by
incantation, and for “sinning without conceiving.”® 1</p>
<p>CHAP, Xiv) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 403</p>
<p>he dawn was Ushas, the furrow in the field was Sita, the sun was
Surya, Mitra, or Vishnu; and the sacred soma plant, whose juice was at
once holy and intoxicating to gods and men, was itself a god, a Hindu
Dionysus, inspiring man by its exhilarating essence to charity, insight
and joy, and even bestowing upon him eternal life.“ A nation, like an
individual, begins with poetry, and ends with prose. And as things
became persons, so qualities became objects, adjectives became nouns,
epithets became deities. The life-giving sun became a new sun-god,
Savitar the Life-Giver; the shining sun became Vivasvat, Shining God;
the life-generating sun be- came the great god Prajapati, Lord of all
living things.*“</p>
<p>For a time the most important of the Vedic gods was Agni — fire; he
was the sacred flame that lifted the sacrifice to heaven, he was the
lightning that pranced through the sky, he was the fiery life and spirit
of the world. But the most popular figure in the pantheon was Indra,
wielder of</p>
<p>hunder and storm. For Indra brought to the Indo- Aryans that precious
rain which seemed to them even more vital than the sun; therefore they
made him the greatest of the gods, invoked the aid of his thunderbolts
in their battles, and pictured him enviously as a gigantic hero feasting
on bulls by the hundred, and lapping up lakes of wine.“ His favorite
enemy was Krishna, who in the Vedas was as yet only the local god of
the</p>
<p>Krishna tribe. Vishnu, the sun who covered the earth with his
strides, was also a subordinate god, unaware that the future belonged to
him and to Krishna, his avatar. This is one value of the Vedas to us,
that</p>
<p>hrough them we see religion in the making, and can follow the birth,
growth and death of gods and beliefs from animism to philosophic panthe-
ism, and from the superstition of the Atharva-veda to the sublime monism
of the Upanishads.</p>
<p>These gods are human in figure, in motive, almost in ignorance. One
of them, besieged by prayers, ponders what he should give his devotee:
“This is what I will do— no, not that; I will give him a cow — or shall
it be a horse? I wonder if I have really had soma from him?” 07 Some of
them, however, rose in later Vedic days to a majestic moral
significance. Varuna, who began as the encompassing heaven, whose breath
was the storm and whose garment was the sky, grew with the development
of his worshipers into the most ethical and ideal deity of the Vedas —
watching</p>
<p>An almost monotheistic devotion was accorded to Prajapati, until he
was swallowed up, in later theology, by the all-consuming figure of
Brahma.</p>
<p>404 the story of civilization (chap. XIV</p>
<p>over the world through his great eye, the sun, punishing evil,
rewarding good, and forgiving the sins of those who petitioned him. In
this aspect Varuna was the custodian and executor of an eternal law
called Rita; this was at first the law that established and maintained
the stars in their courses; gradually it became also the law of right,
the cosmic and moral rhythm which every man must follow if he would not
go astray and be destroyed.“</p>
<p>As the number of the gods increased, the question arose as to which
of them had created the world. This primal role was assigned now to</p>
<p>Agni, now to Indra, now to Soma, now to Prajapati. One of the Upani-
shads attributed the world to an irrepressible Pro-creator:</p>
<p>Verily, he had no delight; one alone had no delight; he desired a</p>
<p>second. He was, indeed, as large as a woman and a man closely em-
braced. He caused that self to fall (v pat) into two pieces; there-</p>
<p>from arose a husband (pati) and a wife (patni). Therefore… one’ s</p>
<p>self is like a half fragment;… therefore this space is filled by
a</p>
<p>wife. He copulated with her. Therefore human beings were pro-</p>
<p>duced. And she bethought herself: “How, now, does he copulate</p>
<p>with me after he has produced me just from himself? Come, let me</p>
<p>hide myself.” She became a cow. He became a bull. With her he</p>
<p>did indeed copulate. Then cattle were bom. She became a mare, he a
stallion. She became a female ass, he a male ass; with her he copu-
lated of a truth. Thence were bom solid hoofed animals. She be-</p>
<p>came a she-goat, he a he-goat; she a ewe, he a ram. With her he did
verily copulate. Therefore were bom goats and sheep. Thus indeed</p>
<p>he created all, whatever pairs there are, even down to the ants.
He</p>
<p>knew: “I, indeed, am this creation, for I emitted it all from
myself.”</p>
<p>Thence arose creation.“</p>
<p>In this unique passage we have the germ of pantheism and transmigra-
tion: the Creator is one with his creation, and all things, all forms
of</p>
<p>life, are one; every form was once another form, and is distinguished
from it only in the prejudice of perception and the superficial
separateness of time. This view, though formulated in the Upanishads,
was not yet in Vedic days a part of the popular creed; instead of
transmigration the Indo-Aryans, like the Aryans of Persia, accepted a
simple belief in per- sonal immortality. After death the soul entered
into eternal punishment or happiness; it was thrust by Varuna into a
dark abyss, half Hades and half hell, or was raised by Yama into a
heaven where every earthly joy</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 405</p>
<p>was made endless and complete.™ “Like com decays the mortal,” said
the Katha Upanishad, “like com is he bom again.” 71</p>
<p>In the earlier Vedic religion there were, so far as the evidence
goes,</p>
<p>no temples and no images™ altars were put up anew for each sacrifice
as in Zoroastrian Persia, and sacred fire lifted the offering to heaven.
Vestiges of human sacrifice occur here,™ as at the outset of almost
every civilization; but they are few and uncertain. Again as in Persia,
the horse was sometimes burnt as an offering to the gods. 74 The
strangest ritual of all was the Ashvamedha, or Sacrifice of the Horse,
in which the queen of the tribe seems to have copulated with the sacred
horse after it had been killed.* 75 The usual offering was a libation of
soma juice, and the pouring of liquid butter into the fire. 77 The
sacrifice was conceived for the most part in magical terms; if it were
properly performed it would win its reward, regardless of the moral
deserts of the worshiper. 78 The priests charged heavily for helping the
pious in the ever more complicated ritual of sacrifice: if no fee was at
hand, the priest refused to recite the necessary formulas; his payment
had to come before that of the god. Rules were laid down by the clergy
as to what the remuneration should be for each service — how many cows
or horses, or how much gold; gold was particularly efficacious in moving
the priest or the god.™ The</p>
<p>Brahmanas, written by the Brahmans, instructed the priest how to turn
the prayer or sacrifice secretly to the hurt of those who had employed
him, if they had given him an inadequate fee. 80 Other regulations were
issued, prescribing the proper ceremony and usage for almost every
occasion of life, and usually requiring priestly aid. Slowly the
Brahmans became a privileged hereditary caste, holding the mental and
spiritual life of India under a control that threatened to stifle all
thought and change. 81 VI. THE VEDAS AS LITERATURE</p>
<p>Sanskrit and English — Writing — The jour “Vedas”— The “Rig -</p>
<p>veda”— A Hymn of Creation</p>
<p>The language of the Indo-Aryans should be of special interest to
us,</p>
<p>for Sanskrit is one of the oldest in that “Indo - European” group of
lan - guages to which our own speech belongs. We feel for a moment a
strange sense of cultural continuity across great stretches of time and
space when</p>

<p>406 the story of civilization (chap. XIV</p>
<p>we observe the similarity — in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and English —
of the numerals, the family terms, and those insinuating little words
that, by some oversight of the moralists, have been called the
copulative verb.* It is quite unlikely that this ancient tongue, which
Sir William Jones pro- nounced “more perfect than the Greek, more
copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either ,” 88
should have been the spoken lan - guage of the Aryan invaders. What that
speech was we do not know; we can only presume that it was a near
relative of the early Persian dialect in which the Avesta was composed.
The Sanskrit of the Vedas and the epics has already the earmarks of a
classic and literary tongue, used only by scholars and priests; the very
word Sanskrit means “prepared, pure, perfect, sacred.” The language of
the people in the Vedic age was not one but many; each tribe had its own
Aryan dialect. 84 India has never had one language.</p>
<p>The Vedas contain no hint that writing was known to their
authors.</p>
<p>It was not until the eighth or ninth century b.c. that Hindu —
probably Dravidian — merchants brought from western Asia a Semitic
script, akin to the Phoenician; and from this “Brahma script,” as it
came to be called, all the later alphabets of India were derived. 86 For
centuries writing seems</p>

<p>CHAP. XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 407</p>
<p>o have been confined to commercial and administrative purposes, with
little thought of using it for literatur e; “merchants, not priests,
developed this basic art.” 88 Even the Buddhist canon does not appear to
have been written down before the third century b.c. The oldest extant
inscriptions in India are those of Ashoka. 87 We who (until the air
about us was filled with words and music) were for centuries made
eye-minded by writing and print, find it hard to understand how
contentedly India, long after she had learned to write, clung to the old
ways of transmitting history and literature by recitation and memory.
The Vedas and the epics were songs that grew with the generations of
those that recited them; they were intended not for sight but for
sound.* From this indifference to writing comes our dearth of knowledge
about early India.</p>
<p>What, then, were these Vedas from which nearly all our understanding
of primitive India is derived? The word Veda means knowledge; f a</p>
<p>Veda is literally a Book of Knowledge. Vedas is applied by the Hindus
ro all the sacred lore of their early period; like our Bible it
indicates a literature rather than a book. Nothing could be more
confused than the arrangement and division of this collection. Of the
many Vedas that once existed, only four have survived:</p>
<p>I. The Rig-veda, or Knowledge of the Hymns of Praise;</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li><p>The Sama-veda, or Knowledge of the Melodies;</p></li>
<li><p>The Yajur-veda, or Knowledge of the Sacrificial Formulas;
and</p></li>
<li><p>The Atharva-veda, or Knowledge of the Magic Formulas.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these four Vedas is divided into four sections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Mantras, or Hymns;</p></li>
<li><p>The Brahmanas, or manuals of ritual, prayer and incantation
for</p></li>
</ol>
<p>he priests;</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>The Aranyaka, or “forest - texts” for hermit saints; and</p></li>
<li><p>The Upanishads, or confidential conferences for
philosophers.^</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps poetry will recover its ancient hold upon our people when it
is again recited rather than silently read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Greek (f)oida, Latin video, German iveise, English wit and
wisdom.</p>
<p>^ This is but one of many possible divisions of the material. In
addition to the “in - spired” commentaries contained in the Brahmanas
and Upanishads, Hindu scholars usually include in the Vedas several
collections of shorter commentaries in aphoristic form, called Sutras
(lit., threads, from Skt. siv, to sew). These, while not directly
inspired from heaven, have the high authority of an ancient tradition.
Many of them are brief to the</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>Only one of the Vedas belongs to literature rather than to religion,
phil- osophy or magic. The Rig-veda is a kind of religious anthology,
composed of 1028 hymns, or psalms of praise, to the various objects of
Indo- Aryan worship — sun, moon, sky, stars, wind, rain, fire, dawn,
earth, etc.* Most of the hymns are matter-of-fact petitions for herds,
crops, and longevity; a small minority of them rise to the level of
literature; a few of them reach to the eloquence and beauty of the
Psalms. 02 Some of them are simple and natural poetry, like the
unaffected wonder of a child. One hymn marvels that white milk should
come from red cows; another cannot understand why the sun, once it
begins to descend, does not fall precipitately to the earth; another
inquires how “the sparkling waters of all rivers flow into one ocean</p>
<p>From the dead hand I take the bow he wielded</p>
<p>To gain for us dominion, might and glory.</p>
<p>Thou there, we here, rich in heroic offspring,</p>
<p>Will vanquish all assaults of every foeman.</p>
<p>Approach the bosom of the earth, the mother,</p>
<p>This earth extending far and most propitious;</p>
<p>Young, soft as wool to bounteous givers, may she</p>
<p>Preserve thee from the lap of dissolution.</p>
<p>Open wide, O earth, press not heavily upon him,</p>
<p>Be easy of approach, hail him with kindly aid;</p>
<p>As with a robe a mother hides</p>
<p>Her son, so shroud this man, O earth. 03</p>
<p>Another of the poems ( Rv. x, 10) is a frank dialogue between the
first parents of mankind, the twin brother and sister, Yama and Yami.
Yami tempts her brother to cohabit with her despite the divine
prohibition of incest, and alleges that all that she desires is the
continuance of the race. Yama point of unintelligibility; they were
convenient condensations of doctrine, mnemonic de- vices for students
who still relied upon memory rather than upon writing.</p>
<p>As to the authorship or date of this mass of poetry, myth, magic,
ritual and philosophy, no man can say. Pious Hindus believe every word
of it to be divinely inspired, and tell us that the great god Brahma
wrote it with his own hand upon leaves of gold; 80 and this is a view
which cannot easily be refuted. According to the fervor of their
patriotism, divers native authorities assign to the oldest hymns dates
ranging from 6000 to 1000 b.c. 00 The material was probably collected
and arranged between 1000 and 500 b.c. 01</p>
<ul>
<li>They are composed in stanzas generally of four lines each. The lines
are of 5, 8, 1 1 or 12 syllables, indifferent as to quantity, except
that the last four syllables are usually two trochees, or a trochee and
a spondee.</li>

<p>resists her on high moral grounds. She uses every inducement, and as
a last weapon, calls him a weakling. The story as we have it is left
unfinished, and we may judge the issue only from circumstantial
evidence. The loftiest of the poems is an astonishing Creation Hymn, in
which a subtle pantheism, even a pious scepticism, appears in this
oldest book of the most religious of peoples:</p>
<p>Nor Aught nor Nought existed; yon bright sky</p>
<p>Was not, nor heaven’s broad woof outstretched above.</p>
<p>What covered all? what sheltered? what concealed?</p>
<p>Was it the water’s fathomless abyss?</p>
<p>There was not death — yet was there naught immortal,</p>
<p>There was no confine betwixt day and night;</p>
<p>The Only One breathed breathless by itself;</p>
<p>Other than It there nothing since has been.</p>
<p>Darkness there was, and all at first was veiled</p>
<p>In gloom profound — an ocean without light —</p>
<p>The germ that still lay covered in the husk</p>
<p>Burst forth, one nature, from the fervent heat.</p>
<p>Then first came love upon it, the new spring</p>
<p>Of mind — yea, poets in their hearts discerned.</p>
<p>Pondering, this bond between created things</p>
<p>And uncreated. Comes this spark from earth</p>
<p>Piercing and all-pervading, or from heaven?</p>
<p>Then seeds were sown, and mighty powers arose —</p>
<p>Nature below, and power and will above —</p>
<p>Who knows the secret? who proclaimed it here,</p>
<p>Whence, whence this manifold creation sprang?</p>
<p>The gods themselves came later into being —</p>
<p>Who knows from whence this great creation sprang?</p>
<p>He from whom all this great creation came,</p>
<p>Whether his will created or was mute,</p>
<p>The Most High Seer that is in highest heaven,</p>
<p>He knows it — or perchance even He knows not. 04</p>
<p>It remained for the authors of the Upanishads to take up these
problems, and elaborate these hints, in the most typical, and perhaps
the greatest, product of the Hindu mind.</p>

<p>“In the whole world,” said Schopenhauer, “there is no study so bene -
ficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the
solace of my life — it will be the solace of my death.” 05 Here,
excepting the moral fragments of Ptah-hotep, are the oldest extant
philosophy and psychology of our race; the surprisingly subtle and
patient effort of man to under- stand the mind and the world, and their
relation. The Upanishads are as old as Homer, and as modern as Kant.</p>
<p>The word is composed of upa, near, and shad , to sit. From
“sitting</p>
<p>near” the teacher the term came to mean the secret or e soteric
doctrine confided by the master to his best and favorite pupils.” There
are one hundred and eight of these discourses, composed by various
saints and sages between 800 and 500 b.c.“ They represent not a
consistent system of philosophy, but the opinions, apergus and lessons
of many men, in whom philosophy and religion were still fused in the
attempt to under- stand — and reverently unite with — the simple and
essential reality under- lying the superficial multiplicity of things.
They are full of absurdities and contradictions, and occasionally they
anticipate all the wind of</p>
<p>Hegelian verbiage” sometimes they present formulas as weird as that -
foundest thinking in the history of philosophy.</p>
<p>We know the names of many of the authors, 1 ” but we know nothing of
their lives except what they occasionally reveal in their teachings. The
most vivid figures among them are Yajnavalkya, the man, and Gargi, the
woman who has the honor of being among the earliest of philosophers. Of
the two, Yajnavalkya has the sharper tongue. His fellow teachers looked
upon him as a dangerous innovator; his posterity made his doc- trine the
cornerstone of unchallengeable orthodoxy.” 1 He tells us h ow he tried
to leave his two wives in order to become a hermit sage; and in the plea
of his wife Maitreyi that he should take her with him, we catch some
feeling of the intensity with which India has for thousands of years
pur- sued religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>CHAP. XIV ) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 4II</p>
<p>And then Yajnavalkya was about to commence another mode of life.</p>
<p>“Maitreyi!” said Yajnavalkya, “lo, I am about to wander forth</p>
<p>from this state. Let me make a final settlement for you and that</p>
<p>Katyaya ni.”</p>
<p>Then spake Maitreyi: “If, now, Sir, this whole earth filled with</p>
<p>wealth were mine, would I now thereby be immortal?”</p>
<p>“No, no!” said Yajnavalkya. “Of immortality there is no hope</p>
<p>hrough wealth.”</p>
<p>Then spake Maitreyi: “What should I do with that through which</p>
<p>I may not be immortal? What you know, Sir — that, indeed, explain</p>
<p>o me.” 102</p>
<p>The theme of the U punish ads is all the mystery of this
unintelligible world. “Whence are we born, where do we live, and whither
do we go? O ye who know Brahman , tell us at whose command we abide
here…. Should time, or nature, or necessity, or chance, or the elements
be con- sidered the cause, or he who is called Purusha”— the Supreme
Spirit ? 108 India has had more than her share of men who wanted “not
millions, but answers to their questions.” In the Maitri Upanishad we
read of a king abandoning his kingdom and going into the forest to
practice austerities, clear his mind for understanding, and solve the
riddle of the universe. After a thousand days of the king’s penances a
sage, “knower of the soul,” came to him. “You are one who knows its true
nature,” says the king; “do you tell us.” “Choose other desires,” warns
the sage. But the king insists; and in a passage that must have seemed
Schopenhauerian to Scho- penhauer, he voices that revulsion against
life, that fear of being reborn, which runs darkly through all Hindu
thought:</p>
<p>“Sir, in this ill -smelling, unsubstantial body, which is a
conglomer-</p>
<p>ate of bone, skin, muscle, marrow, flesh, semen, blood, mucus, tears,
rheum, feces, urine, wind, bile and phlegm, what is the good of en-</p>
<p>joyment of desire? In this body, which is afflicted with desire,
anger, covetousness, delusion, fear, despondency, envy, separation from
the desirable, union with the undesirable, hunger, thirst, senility,
death, disease, sorrow and the like, what is the good of enjoyment
of</p>
<p>desires? And we see that this whole world is decaying like these</p>
<p>gnats, these mosquitoes, this grass, and these trees that arise and
per- ish…. Among other things there is the drying up of great
oceans,</p>
<p>he falling-away of mountain-peaks, the deviation of the fixed
pole-</p>
<p>412</p>
<p>THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XIV</p>
<p>star,… the submergence of the earth…. In this sort of cycle</p>
<p>of existence what is the good of enjoyment of desires, when,
after</p>
<p>a man has fed upon them, there is seen repeatedly his return here to
the earth ?” 101</p>
<p>The first lesson that the sages of the Upanishads teach their
selected pupils is the inadequacy of the intellect. How can this feeble
brain, that aches at a little calculus, ever hope to understand the
complex immensity of which it is so transitory a fragment? Not that the
intellect is useless; it has its modest place, and serves us well when
it deals with relations and things; but how it falters before the
eternal, the infinite, or the elementally real! In the presence of that
silent reality which supports all appearances, and wells up in all
consciousness, we need some other organ of perception and understanding
than these senses and this reason. “Not by learning is the Atman (or
Soul of the World) attained, not by genius and muclj knowledge of
books…. Let a Brahman renounce learning and become as a child…. Let him
not seek after many words, for that is mere weari- ness of tongue.” 105
The highest understanding, as Spinoza was to say, is direct perception,
immediate insight; it is, as Bergson would say, in- tuition, the inward
seeing of the mind that has deliberately closed, as far as it can, the
portals of external sense. “The self -evident Brahman pierced the
openings of the senses so that they turned outwards; therefore man looks
outward, not inward into himself; some wise man, however, with his eyes
closed and wishing for immortality, saw the self behind.” 100 If, on
looking inward, a man finds nothing at all, that may only prove the
accuracy of his introspection; for no man need expect to find the
eternal in himself if he is lost in the ephemeral and particular. Before
that inner reality can be felt one has to wash away from himself all
evil doing and thinking, all turbulence of body and soul. 101 For a
fortnight one must fast, drinking only water ; 108 then the mind, so to
speak, is starved into tranquillity and silence, the senses are cleansed
and stilled, the spirit is left at peace to feel itself and that great
ocean of soul of which it is a part; at last the individual ceases to
be, and Unity and Reality appear. For it is not the individual self
which the seer sees in this pure inward seeing; that individual self is
but a series of brain or mental states, it is merely the body seen from
within. What the seeker seeks is Atman* the</p>
<p>*The derivation of this word is uncertain. Apparently (as in Rig. x,
16), it originally meant breath, like the Latin spiritus; then vital
essence, then soul. 109</p>
<p>CHAP, XIV) THE FOUNDATIONS OF INDIA 413</p>
<p>Self of all selves, the Soul of all souls, the immaterial, formless
Absolute in which we bathe ourselves when we forget ourselves.</p>
<p>This, then, is the first step in the Secret Doctrine: that the
essence of our own self is not the body, or the mind, or the individual
ego, but</p>
<p>he silent and formless depth of being within us, Atman. The second
step is Brahman* the one pervading, neuter, f impersonal, all-embracing,
under- lying, intangible essence of the world, the “Real of the Real,”
“the unborn Soul, undecaying, undying,”™ the Soul of all Things as Atman
is the Soul of all Souls; the one force that stands behind, beneath and
above all forces and all gods.</p>
<p>Then Vidagda Sakayla questioned him. “How many gods are</p>
<p>here, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>He answered,… “As many as are mentioned in the Hymn to All</p>
<p>he Gods, namely, three hundred and three, and three thousand and
three.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but just how many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>“Thirty - three.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but just how many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>“Six.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but just how many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but just how many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>“One and a half.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but just how many gods are there, Yajnavalkya?”</p>
<p>“One.” m</p>
<p>The third step is the most important of all: Atman and Brahman are
one. The (non-individual) soul or force within us is identical with the
impersonal Soul of the World. The Upanishads burn this doctrine into the
pupil’s mind with untiring, tiring repetition. Behind all forms and</p>
<ul>
<li>Brahman as here used, meaning the impersonal Soul of the World, is
to be distin- guished from the more personal Brahma , member of the
Hindu triad of gods (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva); and from Brahman as
denoting a member of the priestly caste. The dis- tinction, however, is
not always carried out, and Brahma is sometimes used in the sense of
Brahman. Brahman as God will be distinguished in these pages from
Brahman as priest by being italicized.</li>
</ul>
<p>fThe Hindu thinkers are the least anthropomorphic of all religious
philosophers. Even in the later hymns of the Rig-veda the Supreme Being
is indifferently referred to as be or it, to show that it is above sex.
m</p>
<p>414 the story of civilization (chap.xiv</p>
<p>veils the subjective and the objective are one; we, in our
de-individualized reality, and God as the essence of all things, are
one. A teacher expresses it in a famous parable:</p>
<p>“Bring hither a fig from there.”</p>
<p>“Here it is, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Divide it.”</p>
<p>“It is divided, Sir.”</p>
<p>“What do you see there?”</p>
<p>“These rather fine seeds, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Of these please divide one.”</p>
<p>“It is divided, Sir.”</p>
<p>“What do you see there?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Verily, my dear one, that finest essence which you do not per -</p>
<p>ceive — verily from that finest essence this great tree thus arises.
Be- lieve me, my dear one, that which is the finest essence — this whole
world has that as its soul. That is Reality. That is Atman. Tat</p>
<p>vam asi — that art thou, Shwetaketu.”</p>
<p>“Do you, Sir, cause me to understand even more.”</p>
<p>“So be it, my dear one.’™</p>
<p>This almost Hegelian dialectic of Atman, Brahman and their synthesis
is the essence of the Upanishads. Many other lessons are taught here,
but they are subordinate. We find already, in these discourses, the
belief in transmigration,* and the longing for release ( Moksha ) from
this heavy chain of reincarnations. Janaka, King of the Videhas, begs
Yajnavalkya to tell him how rebirth can be avoided. Yajnavalkya answers
by expounding Yoga-, through the ascetic elimination of all personal
desires one may cease to be an individual fragment, unite himself in
supreme bliss with the Soul of the World, and so escape rebirth.
Whereupon the king, meta- physically overcome, says: “I will give you,
noble Sir, the Videhas, and myself also to be your slave.’” 18 It is an
abstruse heaven, however, that Yajnavalkya promises the devotee, for in
it there will be no individual consciousness,” 8 there will only be
absorption into Being, the reunion of</p>

<li>It occurs first in the Satapatha Upanishad , where repeated births
and deaths are viewed as a punishment inflicted by the gods for evil
living. Most primitive tribes be- lieve that the soul can pass from a
man to an animal and vice versa; probably this idea became, in the
pre-Aryan inhabitants of India, the basis of the transmigration creed.

<p>he temporarily sep arated part with the Whole. “As flowing rivers dis

from name and form, goes to the divine person who is beyond all.”
129</p>
<p>Such a theory of life and death will not please Western man, whose
re- ligion is as permeated with individualism as are his political and
economic institutions. But it has satisfied the philosophical Hindu mind
with aston- ishing continuity. We shall find this philosophy of the
Upanishads — this monistic theology, this mystic and impersonal
immortality — dominating Hindu thought from Buddha to Gandhi, from
Yajnavalkya to Tagore. To our own day the Upanishads have remained to
India what the New Testament has been to Christendom — a noble creed
occasionally practised and generally revered. Even in Europe and America
this wistful the-</p>
<p>osophy has won millions upon millions of followers, from lonely women
and tired men to Schopenhauer and Emerson. Who would have thought that
the great American philosopher of individualism would give perfect
expression to the Hindu conviction that individuality is a delusion?</p>
