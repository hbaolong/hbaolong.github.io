<h4 id="chapter-xv">CHAPTER XV</h4>
<p>The Scholars</p>
<p>I. THE INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>T HE growth of knowledge was impeded by inertia, superstition, perse-
cution, censorship, and ecclesiastical control of education. These ob-
stacles were weaker than before, but they were still far stronger than
in an industrial civilization where the competition of individuals,
groups, and nations compels men to search for new ideas and ways, new
means for old ends. Most men in the eighteenth century moved in a slowly
changing milieu where traditional responses and ideas usually sufficed
for the needs of life. When novel situations and events did not readily
lend themselves to natural explanations, the common mind ascribed them
to supernatural causes, and rested.</p>
<p>A thousand superstitions survived side by side with the rising
enlight- enment. Highborn ladies trembled at unfavorable horoscopes, or
believed that a drowned child could be revived if a poor woman would
light a candle and set it afloat in a cup to set fire to a bridge on the
Seine. The Princesse de Conti promised the Abbe Leroux a sumptuous
equipage if he would find her the philosopher’s stone. Julie de
Lespinasse, after living for years with the skeptical scientist d’Ale
mbert, kept her faith in lucky and unlucky days. Fortunetellers lived on
the credit given to their clairvoyance; so Mme. de Pompadour, the Abbe
de Bernis, and the Due de Choiseul secretly consulted Mme. Bontemps, who
read the future in coffee grounds . 1 According to Montesquieu, Paris
swarmed with magicians and other im- postors who offered to ensure
worldly success or eternal youth. The Comte de Saint-Germain persuaded
Louis XV that the sick finances of France could be restored by secret
methods of manufacturing diamonds and gold . 2 The Due de Richelieu
played with black magic — invoking Satan’s aid. The old Prince of Anhalt
-Dessau, who won many battles for Prussia, did not believe in God, but
if he met three old women on his way to hunt he would return home; it
was “a bad time .” 8 Thousands of people wore amulets or talismans to
avert evils. A thousand magical prescriptions served as popular
medicine. Religious relics could cure almost any ailment, and relics of
Christ or the saints could be found anywhere — a bit of his raiment at
Trier, his cloak at Turin and Laon, one of the nails of the True</p>

<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>Cross in the Abbey of St.-Denis. In England the cause of the Stuart
Pre- tenders was advanced by the widely held notion that they could by
their touch cure scrofula — a power denied to the Hanoverian kings
because they were “usurpers” not blessed by divine right. Most peasants
were sure that they heard elves or fairies in the woods. The belief in
ghosts was declining; but the learned Benedictine Dom Augustin Calmet
wrote a history of vam- pires — corpses that went out of their graves at
night to suck the blood of the living; this book was published with the
approval of the Sorbonne. 4</p>
<p>The worst superstition of all, the belief in witchcraft, disappeared
in this century, except for some local vestiges. In 1736 the “divines of
the Associated Presbyteries” of Scotl and passed a resolution
reaffirming their belief in witchcraft; 5 and as late as 1765 the most
famous of English jurists, Sir William Blackstone, wrote in his
Commentaries: “To deny the possi - bility, nay, actual existence, of
witchcraft and sorcery is flatly to contradict the revealed word of God;
… the thing itself is a truth to which every nation in the world hath in
its turn borne testimony.” Despite Blackstone and the Bible the English
law that had made witchcraft a felony was re- pealed in 1736. No
execution for witchcraft is recorded in France after 1718, none in
Scotland after 1722; an execution in Switzerland in 1782 is the last
recorded on the European Continent. 6 Gradually the increase of wealth
and towns, the spread of education, the experiments of scientists, the
appeals of scholars and philosophers reduced the role of devils and
ghosts in human life and thought, and judges, defying popular
fanaticism, refused to hear accusations of sorcery. Europe began to
forget that it had sacrificed 100,000 men, women, and girls to just one
of its superstitions. 7</p>
<p>Meanwhile persecution of dissent by Church and state, by Catholics
and Protestants, exerted its terrors to keep from the public mind any
ideas that might disturb vested beliefs and powers. The Catholic Church
claimed to have been established by the Son of God, therefore to be the
depository and sole authorized interpreter of divine truth, therefore to
have the right to suppress heresy. It concluded that outside the Church
no one could be saved from eternal damnation. Had not Christ said, “He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he that believeth not
shall be condemned”? 8 So the Fourth Lateran Ecumenical Council, in
1215, had made it part of the fides definita — required every Catholic
to believe — that “there is one uni - versal Church of the faithful,
outside which no one at all can be saved.”*</p>
<ul>
<li>Una est fidelium universalis Ecclesia , extra quam nullus omnino
salvatur. Pope Pius IX re- affir med the doctrine in his encyclical of
August io, 1863: “The Catholic dogma is well known, namely, that no one
can be saved outside the Catholic Church 〔Notissimum est catholicum
dogma neminem scilicet extra catholicam ecclesiam posse salvari〕” (
Catholic En- cyclopedia, III, 753b.) It is fair to add that recent
Catholic theology softens the dogma. “The doctrine . . . summed up in
the phrase Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus . . . does not</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE SCHOLARS</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>Louis XV accepted this doctrine as logically derived from
Scriptural</p>
<p>texts, and as useful in molding a unified national mind. In 1732 the
public exercise of Protestant worship in France was forbidden on pain of
torture, the galleys, or death. 9 The Catholic population was more
tolerant than its leaders; it condemned these savage penalties, and the
edict was so laxly en- forced that in 1744 the Huguenots of France dared
to hold a national synod. But in 1767 the Sorbonne, the Faculty of
Theology at the Univer- sity of Paris, reiterated the old claim: “The
prince has received the tem - poral sword in order to repress such
doctrines as materialism, atheism, and deism, which cut the bonds of
society and instigate crime, and also to crush every teaching
threatening to shake the foundations of the Catholic faith.” 19 In Spain
and Portugal this policy was strictly enforced; in Italy, more
leniently. In Russia the Orthodox Church required similar unanimity.</p>
<p>Many Protestant states agreed with the Catholics on the necessity of
perse- cution. In Denmark and Sweden the laws demanded adherence to the
Lutheran faith; in practice other Protestants, and even Catholics, were
unmolested, though they remained ineligible to hold public office. In
Switzerland each canton was free to choose its own faith and enforce it.
In Germany the rule that the people must follow the religion of the
prince was increasingly ignored. In the United Provinces Protestant
ecclesiastics rejected toleration as an invitation to religious
indifference, but the laity refused to follow the clergy in this matter,
and relative freedom from persecution made Holland a refuge for
unorthodox ideas and publications. In England the laws allowed religious
dissent, but they harassed Dissenters with social and political
disabilities. Samuel Johnson declared in 1763 that “false doctrine
should be checked on its first appearance; the civil p ower should unite
with the Church in punishing those who dared to attack the established
religion.” 11 The British government occasionally burned books, or
pilloried authors, that had questioned the fundamentals of the Christian
faith; so Woolston was fined and jailed in 1730, and in 1762 Peter Annet
was sentenced to the pillory, then to a year’s imprisonment with hard
labor, for his attacks on Christianity. The laws against Catholics were
loosely ad- ministered in England, but in Ireland they were enforced
with rigor until Lord Chesterfield, as lord lieutenant in 1745, refused
to apply them; and in the second half of the eighteenth century some of
the severe regulations were repealed. In general the theory of
persecution was maintained by both the Catholic and the Protestant
clergy till 1789, except where Catholics or</p>
<p>The Catholic Church has ever taught that nothing else is needed to
obtain justification than an act of perfect charity and of contrition.
Whoever, under the impulse of actual grace, elicits these acts receives
immediately the gift of sanctifying grace, and is numbered among the
children of God. Should he die in these dispositions he will assuredly
attain heaven.”</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>Protestants were in the minority, but the practice of persecution
declined as a new public opinion took form with the development of
religious doubt. The instinct to persecute passed from religion to
politics as the state re- placed the Church as the guardian of unanimity
and order and as the object of heretical dissent.</p>
<p>Censorship of speech and press was generally more relaxed in
Protestant than in Catholic countries; it was mildest in Holland and
England. It was strict in most of the Swiss cantons. The city fathers of
Geneva burned a few unorthodox books, but seldom took action against the
authors them- selves. In Germany censorship was handicapped by the
multiplicity of states, each with its own official creed; a writer could
move across a frontier from an unfriendly to a friendly or indifferent
environment. In Prussia censorship was practically abolished by
Frederick the Great, but was restored by his successor in 1786. Denmark,
except for a brief inter- lude under Struensee, maintained censorship of
books till 1849. Sweden forbade the publication of material critical of
Lutheranism or the govern- ment; in 1764 the University of Uppsala
issued a list of forbidden books; but in 1766 Sweden established full
freedom of the press.</p>
<p>In France censorship had broadened from precedent to precedent since
Francis I, and was renewed by an edict of 1723: “No publishers or others
may print or reprint, anywhere in the kingdom, any books without having
obtained permission i n advance by letters sealed with the Great Seal.”
In 1741 there were seventy-six official censors. Before giving a book
the per- mission et privilege du roi the censor was required to testify
that the book contained nothing contrary to religion, public order, or
sound morality. Even after being published with the royal imprimatur a
book might be condemned by the Paris Parlement or the Sorbonne. In the
first half of the eighteenth century the royal censorship was only
loosely enforced. Thou- sands of books appeared without the privilege
and with impunity; in many cases, especially when Malesherbes was chief
censor (1750-63), an author received permission tacite — an informal
pledge that the book in question might be printed without fear of
prosecution. A book published without the permission of the government
might be burned by the public execu- tioner, while the author remained
free; and if he was sent to the Bastille it was usually for a brief and
genteel imprisonment. 12</p>
<p>This era of relative toleration ended with the attempt of Damiens to
as- sassinate Louis XV (January 5, 1757). In April a savage edict
decreed death for “all those who shall be convicted of having written or
printed any works intended to attack religion, to assail the royal
authority, or to disturb the order and tranquillity of the realm.” In
1764 another decree</p>
<p>CHAP. XV)</p>
<p>THE SCHOLARS</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>scrutiny and control. Sentences varying from the pillory and flogging
to nine years in the galleys were imposed for buying or selling copies
of Vol- taire’s La Pucelle or his Dictionnaire philosophique. In 1762
d’Alembert wrote to Voltaire: “Yon cannot imagine what degree of fury
the Inquisi - tion has reached 〔in France〕. The inspectors of thought
. . . delete from all books such words as superstition , indulgence,
persecution .” 13 Hatred</p>
<p>The philosophes (i.e., those French philosophers who joined in the
attack upon Christianity) protested against the censorship as condemning
French thought to sterility. But they themselves sometimes asked the
censor to check their opponents. So d’Alembert begged Malesherbes to
suppress Fre - ron’s antiphilosophe periodical, VAnnee litteraire;
Malesherbes, though pro-philosophes, refused. 14 Voltaire asked the
Queen to prohibit the per- formance of a parody on his play Semiramis;
she would not, but Pompa- dour did. 15</p>
<p>Meanwhile the philosophes contrived a variety of ways to elude the
cen- sorship. They sent their manuscripts to foreign publishers, usually
to Am- sterdam, The Hague, or Geneva; thence their books, in French,
were im- ported wholesale into France; almost every day forbidden books
arrived by boat at Bordeaux or other points on the French coast or
frontier. Disguised with innocent titles, they were peddled from street
to street, from town to town. Some nobles not overfriendly to the
centralized monarchy allowed such volumes to be sold in their territory.
16 Voltaire’s correspondence, which unified the philosophic campaign,
escaped much of the censorship because his friend Damilaville for a time
held a post in the finance adminis - tration, and was able to
countersign with the seal of the comptroller gen- eral the letters and
packages of Voltaire and his associates. 17 Many govern- ment officials,
some clergymen, read with pleasure the books that the government or the
clergy had condemned. French authors of foreign-pub- lished volumes
rarely put their names on the title page, and when they were accused of
authorship they lied with a stout conscience; this was part of the game,
sanctioned by the laws of war. Voltaire not only denied the authorship
of several of his books, he sometimes foisted them upon dead people, and
he confused the scent by issuing criticisms or denunciations of his own
works. The game included devices of form or tricks of expression that
helped to form the subtlety of French prose: double meanings, dia-
logues, allegories, stories, irony, transparent exaggeration, and, all
in all,</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>such delicate wit as no other literature has ever matched. The Abbe
Gali- ani defined eloquence as the art of saying something without being
sent to the Bastille.</p>
<p>Only second to the censorship as an obstacle to free thought was the
con- trol of education by the clergy. In France the local cures taught
or super- vised the parish schools; secondary education was in the hands
of the Jesuits, the Oratorians, or the Christian Brothers. All Europe
acclaimed the Jesuits as teachers of classical languages and
literatures, but they were less helpful in science. Many of the
philosophes had had their wits sharpened by a Jesuit education. The
University of Paris was dominated by priests far more conservative than
the Jesuits. The University of Orleans, famous for law, and the
University of Montpellier, famous for medicine, were rela- tively
secular. It is significant that neither Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot,
Maupertuis, Helvetius, nor Buffon attended a university. The French
mind, struggling to free itself from theological leading strings,
flowered not in universities but in academies and salons.</p>
<p>Learned academies had sprung up in this century in Berlin (1701 ),
Upp- sala (1710), St. Petersburg (1724), and Copenhagen (1743). In 1739
Lin- naeus and five other Swedish scholars formed the Collegium
Curiosum; in 1741 this was incorporated as the Kongliga Svenska
Vetenskaps-academien, which became the Swedish Royal Academy. In France
there were provin- cial academies in Orleans, Bordeaux, Toulouse,
Auxerre, Metz, Besangon, Dijon, Lyons, Caen, Rouen, Montauban, Angers,
Nancy, Aix-en-Provence. The academies steered clear of heresy, but they
encouraged science and ex- periment, and they tolerated and stimulated
discussion; it was the prize com- petitions offered by the Dijon Academy
in 1749 and 1754 that started Rousseau on his way toward the French
Revolution. In Paris the French Academy of moribund Immortals was
awakened from dogmatic slumbers by the election of Duclos (1746) and
d’Alembert (1754); and the rise of</p>
<p>Learned journals added to the intellectual stimulation. One of the
best was the Memoires pour servir a Phistoire des sciences et des
beaux-arts, edited by the Jesuits from 1701 to 1762, and known as the
Journal de Trevoux from their publishing house at Trevoux, near Lyons;
this was the most erudite and liberal of the religious publications.
There were seventy- three periodicals in Paris alone, led by the Mercure
de France and the Journal des savants. Two of Voltaire’s most effective
and persistent e ne- mies edited influential journals: Desfontaines
founded the Nouvelles litte- raires in 1721, and Freron published the
Annee litter air e from 1754 to 1774. Germany followed suit with Brief e
die neueste Literatur betreffend, which numbered Lessing and Moses
Mendelssohn among its frequent con-</p>

<p>tributors. In Italy the Giornale dei letterati covered science,
literature, and art, while Caffe was a journal of opinion on the style
of The Spectator. In Sweden Olof von Dalin made Svenska Argus a
messenger of the Enlighten- ment. As nearly all these periodicals used
the vernacular and were inde- pendent of ecclesiastical control, they
were a rising leaven in the ferment of their time.</p>
<p>Typical of the eighteenth century, as of our own, was a spreading
eager- ness for knowledge — precisely that intellectual lust which the
Middle Ages had condemned as a sin of foolish pride. Authors responded
with a zeal to make knowledge more widely available and intell igible.
“Outlines” abounded; books like Mathematics Made Easy, The Essential
Bayle,</p>
<p>UEsprit de Montaigne, and L’ Esprit de Fontenelle strove to put
science, literature, and philosophy a la portee de tout le monde —
within the compre- hension of all the world. More and more professors
taught in the vernacu- lars, reaching audiences incapable of Latin.
Libraries and museums were expanding, and were opening their treasures
to students. In 1753 Sir Hans Sloane bequeathed to the British nation
his collection of fifty thousand books, several thousand manuscripts,
and a great number of pictures, coins, and antiquities; Parliament voted
twenty thousand pounds to his heirs in recompense, and the collection
became the nucleus of the British Museum. The Harleian and Cottonian
collections of manuscripts, and the accumu- lated libraries of the kings
of England were added; and in 1759 the great museum was opened to the
public. In 1928 it had 3,200,000 printed vol- umes and 56,000
manuscripts on its fifty-five miles of shelves.</p>
<p>Finally, encyclopedias took form to gather, order, and transmit the
new’ stores of knowledge to all who could read and think. There had been
such works in the Middle Ages, as by Isidore, Bishop (c.600-636) of
Seville, and Vincent of Beauvais (c.i 190-C.1264). In the seventeenth
century there had been Johann Heinrich Alsted’s Encyclopaedia (1630) and
Louis Moreri’s Grand Dictionnaire historique (1674). Bayle’s
Dictionnaire his - torique et critique (1697) was rather an assemblage
of disturbing facts and suggestive theories than an encyclopedia, but it
had more influence on the mind of educated Europe than any similar work
before Diderot’s. At Lon - don, in 1728, Ephraim Chambers published in
two volumes a Cyclopoedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and
Sciences; it omitted history, biog- raphy, and geography, but by its
system of cross references, and in other ways, it gave a lead to the
epochal Encyclopedie (1751 f.) of Diderot and d’Alembert. In 1771 there
ap peared in three volumes the first edition of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, “by a society of
gentlemen in Scotland, printed in Edinburgh.” A second edition (1778)
ran to ten volumes, and advanced upon its predecessors by including
history and biography. So it has grown, from edition to edition, through
two hun-</p>

<p>By 1789 the middle classes in Western Europe were as well informed as
the aristocracy and the clergy. Print had made its way. That, after all,
was the basic revolution.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE SCHOLARLY REVELATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Classical scholarship was in modest decline from its peak under the
Scali- gers, Casaubon, Salmasius, and Bentley; but Nicolas Freret upheld
their tradition of scholarly devotion and far-reaching results. Admitted
to the Academie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres at the age of
twenty- six, he read to it in that year (1714) a paper, Sur TOrigine des
Francs, which upset the proud legend that the Franks were “free” men
coming from Greece or Troy; rather, they were South German barbarians.
The Abbe Vertot denounced Freret to the government as a libeler of the
mon- archy; the young scholar was sent to the Bastille for a short stay;
thereafter he confined his researches to other lands than France. He
drew up 1,375 maps illustrating ancient geography. He gathered
illuminating data on the history of classic science and art, and on the
origins of the Greek mythol- ogy. His eight volumes on ancient
chronology corrected the epochal work of Joseph Justus Scaliger, and
established Chinese chronology on lines ac- cepted today; this was one
of a thousand scholarly pinpricks that punctured the Biblical conception
of history.</p>
<p>A similar blow was struck at classic fables when Pouilly read before
the same Academy (1722) a paper questioning Livy’s account of early
Roman history. Lorenzo Valla had suggested such doubts on this point
about 1440; Vico had developed them in 1721; but Pouilly’s wide research
definitely discredited as legends the stories of Romulus and Remus, of
the Horatii and the Curiatii; the way was made straight for the work of
Barthold Niebuhr in the nineteenth century. Not quite within the
temporal bounds of this chapter, but belonging to the eighteenth
century, were the Prolegomena ad Homerum (1795), in which Friedrich Wolf
disintegrated Homer into a whole school and dynasty of singers; and
Richard Porson’s meticulous edi - tions of Aeschylus and Euripides; and
Joseph EckhePs Doctrina Nimiorum veterum (1792-98), which founded the
science of numismatics.</p>
<p>It was not till the discovery of Herculaneum that the world of
classical scholarship felt again the ecstasy of such a revelation as had
come through the humanists of the Renaissance. In 1738 some workmen
preparing the foundations of a hunting lodge for King Charles IV of
Naples unearthed</p>

<p>by accident the ruins of Herculaneum; in 1748 a first inspection
revealed some of the astonishing structures of Pompeii, also buried by
the eruption of Vesuvius in a.d. 79; and in 1752 the majestic temples
built by Greek colonists at Paestum were recovered from the jungle
growth of darkened centuries. The master engraver Piranesi described the
excavated temples, palaces, and statues of Pompeii in etchings whose
prints found eager pur- chasers everywhere in Europe. The result of
these discoveries was a fervent revival of interest in ancient art, a
strong impetus to the neoclassical move- ment led by Winckelmann, and an
immense addition to modern knowledge of ancient ways.</p>
<p>We must pause to acknowledge the debt of scholarship to monks who
used their libraries and manuscript collections to make researches and
compile rec- ords extremely helpful to the modern mind. The Benedictines
of St.-Maur con- tinued their old devotion to historical studies. Dom
Bernard de Montfaucon founded the science of paleography with his
Palaeographica graeca (1708); he illuminated ancient history by means of
ancient art in his Antiquit e expliquee et representee e?i figures (ten
volumes, 1719-24), and he turned his painstaking studies to his own
country in five folio volumes, Les Monuments de la mo- narchic frangaise
( 1729 — 33). Dom Antoine Rivet de la Grange began in 1733 the
Benedictine Histoire litteraire de la France , which served as
progenitor and storehouse for all later histories of early French
literature. The greatest of these eighteenth-century Benedictine
scholars was Dom Augustin Calmet, whose monastery at Senones gave
Voltaire asylum in 1754; Voltaire never ceased to profit, and sometimes
he pilfered, from Calmet’s Commentaire litteral sur tous les livres de
VAncien et du Nouveau Testament (1707-16). Despite certain shortcomings,
18 these twenty-four volumes were acclaimed as a monument of erudition.
Calmet wrote several other works of Biblical exegesis, followed Bos-
suet in composing an Histoire universelle (1735), and spent nearly all
his wak- ing hours in study and prayer. “Who is Madame de Pompadour?” he
asked Vol - taire in happy ignorance. 19 He refused a bishopric, and
wrote his own epitaph: u Hic jacet qui multum legit , scripsit , oravit
; utinam bene! Amen ” (Here lies one who read much, wrote much, prayed
much; may it have been well! Amen). 20</p>
<p>Some bold laics joined in Biblical criticism. The physician Jean
Astruc, as- suming the Mosaic author of the Pentateuch, studied its
sources in his Conjec- tures sur les memoir es originaux dont il parait
que Moise s’est servi pour com- poser le livre de la Genese ( 1753) ;
here for the first time it was pointed out that the use of two different
names for God, Yahveh and Elohim, indicated two original stories of the
Creation, loosely and repetitiously combined in the Book of Genesis.
Other Biblical students tried to calculate, on the basis of the
Pentateuch, the date of the Creation, and arrived at two hundred diverse
results. Orientalists disturbed the orthodox by quoting Egyptian
chronology that claimed to go back thirteen thousand years, and Chinese
calculations that Chi- nese civilization had lasted ninety thousand
years. No one believed the Indian</p>
<p>502 THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE (CHAP. XV</p>
<p>Brahmins who held that the world had existed through 326,669 ages,
each of which had contained many centuries. 21</p>
<p>The most audacious and far-reaching contribution to Biblical studies
in the eighteenth century was made by a German professor of Oriental
lan- guages in the Hamburg Academy. Hermann Reimarus left at his death
in 1768 a four-thousand-page manuscript on which he had labored for
twenty years — “Schutzschrift fur die verniinftigen Verehrer Gottes”
(Apology for the Rational Worshipers of God). No one dared publish it
until Lessing issued (1774- 78) seven portions of it as “fragments of an
anonymous work 〔Fragmente eines Ungenannten found at Wolfenbuttel”
(where Lessing was librarian). Nearly all literate Germany except
Frederick the Great rose in protest; even the liberal scholar Johann
Semler called Lessing mad to serve as godfather to so devastating a
criticism of orthodox beliefs. For in the seventh fragment, Von dem
Zwecke Jesu und Seine Jiinge (On the Aim of Jesus and His Disciples),
Reimarus not only rejected the miracles and resurrection of Christ, but
pictured him as an earnest, lovable, deluded young Jew who was faithful
to Judaism to the end, accepted the belief of some Jews that the world
was soon to be destroyed, and based his ethical principles on this
premise as a preparation for the event. Reimarus thought that Jesus
interpreted the phrase “Kingdom of Heaven” in the sense then current
among his people, as a coming kingdom of the Jews liberated from Rome.
22 His despondent cry on the Cross, “My God, my God, why hast Thou
abandoned me?,” was a confession of his humanity and his defeat. After
his disappearance some of the Apostles transferred this promised kingdom
to a life after death. In this sense it was not Christ but the</p>
<p>Apostles who inaugurated Christianity. All in all, says Reimarus’
erudite interpreter, Albert Schweitzer, “his work is perhaps the most
splendid achievement in the whole course of the historical investigation
of the life of Jesus, for he was the first to grasp the fact that the
world of thought in which Jesus moved was essentially eschatological”—
based on the theory of an imminent end of the world. 23</p>
<p>From the study of Jewish antiquities scholars passed timidly to
Oriental peoples that had reje cted Christ or never heard his name.
Galland’s French translation of the Arabian Nights (1704- 17), de
Reland’s Religion des Mahometans (1721), Burigny’s Histoire de la
philosophie paienne (1724), Boulainvilliers’ Vie de Mahomet (1730), and
Sale’s Englis h translation of the Koran (1734) revealed Islam as not a
world of barbarism but as the do- main of a powerful rival creed, and of
a moral order that seemed to work despite its concessions to the natural
polygamy of mankind. Abraham Hya- cinthe Anquetil-Duperron opened
another realm by translating the Scrip- tures of the Parsees. He was
attracted by reading in a Paris library some ex-</p>

<p>THE SCHOLARS</p>
<p>503</p>
<p>tracts from the Zend-Avesta; he abandoned his preparation for the
priest- hood, and resolved to explore at first hand the sacred books of
the East. Too poor to buy passage, he enlisted, aged twenty-three
(1754), as a soldier in a French expedition to India. Arrived at
Pondicherry, he quickly learned to read modern Persian; at Chandernagor
he took up Sanskrit; at Surat he persuaded a Parsee priest to teach him
Pahlavi and Zend. In 1762 he returned to Paris with 1 80 Oriental
manuscripts and set himself to trans- late them; meanwhile he lived on
bread, cheese, and water, and avoided marriage as an impossible expense.
In 1771 he published his French version of the Zend-Avesta, and
fragments of other books of the Parsees; and in 1 804 he issued Les
Oupanichads. Slowly the awareness of non-Christian re- ligions and moral
codes shared in undermining the dogmatism of European faiths.</p>
<p>Of these ethnic revelations the most influential was the opening up
of Chinese history and philosophy by European missionaries, travelers,
and scholars. It had begun with Marco Polo’s return to Venice in 1295;
it was advanced by French and English translations (1588) of the Jesuit
Father Juan Gonzales de Mendoza’s Historia del reino de la China
(Lisbon, 1584), and with Hakluyt’s English transl ation, in his Voyages
(1589-1600), of a Latin treatise, Of the Kingdom of China (Macao, 1590).
The new influ- ence appeared in Montaigne’s essay “Of Experience”
(1591?): “China, in whose realm the government and the arts, without any
knowledge of our o wn institutions, surpass these in many points of
excellence.” 24 In 1615 the Jesuit Nicolas Trigault published his
account De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas; it was soon translated
into French, and into English in Purchas his Pilgrimes (1625). Trigault
and others lauded the Chinese system of making specific and detailed
education a prerequisite for public office, of admitting all classes of
the male population to examination for office, and of submitting all
governmental agencies to periodical inspection. Another Jesuit, the
amazing polymath Athanasius Kircher, published in 1670 a veri- table
encyclopedia, China illustrata, in which he praised the Chinese gov-
ernment as administered by philosopher-kings. 25</p>
<p>The Jesuits gave generous commendation to Chinese religion and
philos- ophy. Trigault reported that the educated Chinese conceived God
as the soul of the world, and the world as his body; Spinoza, who held a
similar view, could have read this idea in a book published in Amsterdam
in 1649; his Latin teacher Frans van den Enden had this book in his
library. 26 In 1622 the Jesuits published a Latin translation of
Confucius as Sapientia sinica; in a further summary, Confucius Sinarum
philosophus (1687), they called the Confucian ethics “the excellentest
morality that ever was taught, a morality which might be said to proceed
from the school of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ.” 27 In Memoir es de la Chine ( 1696) the Jesuit Louis Le
Comte wrote</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>that the Chinese people had “for two thousand years preserved the
knowl - edge of the true God,” and had “practiced the purest moral code
while Europe was yet steeped in error and corruption”; 28 this book was
con - demned by the Sorbonne. In 1 697 Leibniz, cautious politically but
alert to every breeze in the intellectual atmosphere, published his
Novissima Sinaica (“the latest news from China”). He rated Europe as
excelling China in science and philosophy, yet</p>
<p>who would formerly have believed that there is a people that
surpasses us in its principles of civil life? And this, nevertheless, we
now experi- ence in the case of the Chinese … in ethics and politics.
For it is</p>
<p>impossible to describe how beautifully everything in the laws of the
Chinese, more than in those of other peoples, is directed to the
achieve- ment of public tranquillity. . . . The state of our affairs, as
corruptions spread among us without measure, seems to me such that it
would ap- pear almost necessary that Chinese missionaries should be sent
to us to teach us the use and practice of natural religion, just as we
send mis- sionaries to them to teach them revealed religion. And so I
believe that if a wise man were chosen to pass judgment . . . upon the
excellence of peoples, he would award the golden apple to the Chinese —
except that we should have the better of them in one supreme but
superhuman thing, namely, the divine gift of the Christian religion.
29</p>
<p>Leibniz urged the academies of Europe to gather information about
China, and he helped persuade the French government to send accom-
plished Jesuit scholars to join the mission in China and make factual
re- ports. In 1735 Jean Baptiste du Halde summarized these and other
data in his Description . . . de F empire de la Chine; a year later this
was trans- lated into English; in both France and England it had wide
influence. Du Halde was the first to give Mencius a European reputation.
By the middle of the eighteenth centur y Bossuet’s Histoire universelle
had been discredited by the revelation of old, extensive, and
enlightened cultures which his “universal” history had almost ignored;
and the way was open for Voltaire’s larger perspective of the story of
civilization.</p>
<p>The results of these enthusiastic exaggerations appeared in European
customs, arts, manners, literature, and philosophy. In 1739 the Marquis
d’Argens published a series of Lettres chinoises by an imaginary
Chinese, criticizing European institutions and ways; in 1757 Horace
Walpole</p>
<p>amused England with a “Letter from Xo Ho, a Chinese Philosopher”; in
1760 Goldsmith used the same device in his Citizen of the World. When
the Emperor Joseph II in person plowed a piece of land, he was imitating
a custom of the Chinese emperors. 30 When the fine ladies of Paris
opened their parasols against the sun, they were displaying a pretty

<p>introduced into France from China by the Jesuits; 31 toward the end
of the eighteenth century the umbrella evolved from the parasol. Chinese
porce- lain and Japanese lacquer had in the seventeenth century become
prized possessions in European homes; Chinese wallpaper, in which the
small units, properly placed, made a single large pictorial pattern,
captured Eng- lish fancy toward 1700; Chinese furniture entered English
homes about</p>

<li>All through the eighteenth century the taste for chinoiseries —
articles of Chinese make or style — characterized English and French
decoration, ran through Italy and Germany, entered into rococo ornament,
and be- came so compulsive a fashion that a dozen satirists rose to
challenge its tyranny. Chinese silk became a symbol of status; Chinese
gardens spread over Western Europe; Chinese firecrackers burned European
thumbs. 32 Gozzi’s Turandot was a Chinese fantasy. A dozen plays with a
Chinese background appeared on the English stage; and Voltaire developed
his Orphelin de la Chine from a Chinese drama in the third volume of Du
Halde. 33</li>

<p>Chinese influence on Western thought was keenest in France, where the
esprits forts seized upon it as another weapon against Christianity.
They rejoiced to find that Confucius was a freethinker rather than a
displaced Jesuit. They proclaimed that the Confucian ethic proved the
practicability of a moral code independent of supernatural religion. 34
Bayle pointed out (1685) that a Chinese emperor was giving free scope to
Catholic mission- aries while Louis XIV, revoking Henry IV’s tolerant E
dict of Nantes, was enforcing religious conformity through the barbarous
violence of dragon- nades. Misinterpreting the Confucians as atheists,
Bayle cited them as dis- proving the argument from universal consent for
the existence of God. 35 Montesquieu stood his ground against the
Oriental tide, called the Chinese emperors despots, denounced dishonest
Chinese merchants, exposed the poverty of the Chinese masses, and
predicted tragic results from overpopu- lation in China. 36 Quesnay
tried to answer Montesquieu in Le Despotisme de la Chine (1767), praised
it as “enlightened despotism,” and cited Chinese models for needed
reforms in French economy and government. Turgot, skeptical of the
Chinese utopia, commissioned two Chinese Catholic priests in France to
go to China and seek factual answers to fifty-two questions; their
report encouraged a more realistic appraisal of good and bad in Chinese
life. 37</p>
<p>Voltaire read extensively and eagerly on China. He gave Chinese
civiliza- tion the first three chapters in his Essai sur les moeurs; and
in his Diction- naire philosophique he called China “the finest, the
most ancient, the most extensive, the most populous and well- regulated
kingdom on earth.” 38 His admiration for Chinese government shared in
inclining him to the belief that the best hope for social reform lay in
despotisme eclaire, by which he</p>
<p>50 6</p>
<p>THE AGE OF VOLTAIRE</p>
<p>(CHAP. XV</p>
<p>meant enlightened monarchy. Like several other Frenchmen, and like
the German philosopher Wolff, he was ready to canonize Confucius, who
“had taught the Chinese people the principles of virtue five hundred
years be- fore the founding of Christianity.” 39 Voltaire, famous for
his good man - ners, thought the decorum, self-restraint, and quiet
peaceableness of the Chinese a model for his excitable countrymen, 40
and perhaps for himself. When two poems by the current Chinese Emperor,
Ch’ien Lung (r.</p>
<p>1736-96), were translated into French, Voltaire responded in verse.
The Emperor sent him a porcelain vase.</p>
<p>European acquaintance with alien faiths and institutions was a
powerful factor in weakening Christian theology. The news from Persia,
India, Egypt, China, and America led to an endless series of
embarrassing ques- tions. How, asked Montesquieu, could one choose the
true religion out of two thousand different faiths? 41 How, asked a
hundred others, could the world have been created in 4004 b.c. when in
4000 b.c. China already had a developed civilization? Why had China no
record or tradition of Noah’s Flood, which, according to the Bible, had
covered the whole earth?</p>
<p>And was it not by the science they brought, rather than by the
theology they taught, that those cultured Jesuits had won so many
friends among the Chinese?</p>
