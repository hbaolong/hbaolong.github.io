<h4 id="chapter-xvi">CHAPTER XVI</h4>
<p>Luther: The Reformation in</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>1517-24</p>
<p>I. TETZEL</p>
<p>O N March 15, 1517, Pope Leo X promulgated the most famous of all
indulgences. It was a pity, yet just, that the Reformation should strike
during a pontificate that gathered into Rome so many of the fruits, and
so much of the spirit, of the Renaissance. Leo, son of Lorenzo the
Magnificent, was now head of the Medici family, which had nourished the
Renaissance in Florence; he was a scholar, a poet, and a gentleman,
kindly and generous, in love with classical literature and delicate art.
His morals were good in an immoral milieu; his nature inclined to a
gaiety pleasant snd legitimate, which set an example of happiness for a
city that a century before had been desti- tute and desolate. All his
faults were superficial except his superficiality. He made too little
distinction between the good of his family and that of the Church, and
wasted the funds of the papacy on questionable poets and wars. He was
normally tolerant, enjoyed the satire directed against ecclesiastics in
Erasmus’ Praise of Folly, and practiced, with occasional lapses, the un
- written agreement by which the Renaissance Church accorded
considerable freedom to philosophers, poets, and scholars who addressed
themselves — usually in Latin — to the educated minority, but who left
the irreplaceable</p>
<p>The son of a banker, Leo was accustomed to spending money readily,
and chiefly on others. He inherited full papal coffers from Julius II,
and emptied them before he died. Perhaps he did not care much for the
massive basilica that Julius had planned and begun, but the old S t.
Peter’s was beyond repair, immense sums had been poured into the new
one, and it would be a disgrace to the Church to let that majestic
enterprise abort. Possibly with some re- luctance he offered the
indulgence of 1517 to all who would contribute to the cost of completing
the great shrine. The rulers of England, Germany, France, and Spain
protested that their countries were being drained of wealth, their
national economies were being disturbed, by repeated cam-</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>538 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>paigns for luring money to Rome. Where kings were powerful Leo was
considerate: he agreed that Henry VIII should keep a fourth of the
proceeds in England; he advanced a loan of 175,000 ducats to King
Charles I (the later Emperor Charles V) against expected collections in
Spain; and Francis I was to retain part of the sum raised in France.
Germany received less favored treatment, having no strong monarchy to
bargain with the Pope; however, the Emperor Maximilian was allotted a
modest 3,000 florins from the receipts, and the Fuggers were to take
from the collections the 20,000 florins that they had loaned to Albrecht
of Brandenburg to pay the Pope for his confirmation as Archbishop of
Mainz. Unfortunately that city had lost three archbishops in ten years
(1504-14), and had twice paid heavy confirmation fees; to spare it from
paying a third time Albrecht borrowed. Now Leo agreed that the young
prelate should manage the distribution of the indulgence in Magdeburg
and Halberstadt as well as in Mainz. An agent of the Fuggers accompanied
each of Albrecht’s preachers, checked expenses and receipts, and kept
one of the keys to the strongbox that held the funds. 1</p>
<p>Albrecht’s principal agent was Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar who
had acquired skill and reputation as a money-raiser. Since 1500 his main
occupation had been in disposing of indulgences. Usually, on these
missions, he received the aid of the local clergy: when he entered a
town a procession of priests, magistrates, and pious laity welcomed him
with banners, candles, and song, and bore the bull of indulgence aloft
on a velvet or golden cushion, while church bells pealed and organs
played. 2 So propped, Tetzel offered, in an impressive formula, a
plenary indulgence to those who would penitently confess their sins and
contribute according to their means to the building of a new
St. Peter’s:</p>
<p>May our Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on thee, and absolve thee</p>
<p>by the merits of His most holy Passion. And I, by His authority,
that</p>
<p>of his blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and of the most holy
Pope,</p>
<p>granted and committed to me in these parts, do absolve thee, first
from all ecclesiastical censures, in whatever manner they may have been
incurred, and then from all thy sins, transgressions, and excesses, how
enormous soever they may be, even from such as are reserved for the
cognizance of the Holy See; and as far as the keys of the Holy Church
extend, I remit to you all punishment which you deserve in purga-</p>
<p>tory on their account, and I restore you to the holy sacraments
of</p>
<p>the Church . . . and to that innocence and purity which you pos-</p>
<p>sessed at baptism; so that when you die the gates of punishment shall
be shut, and the gates of the paradise of delight shall be opened; and
if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain in full
force</p>
<p>when you are at the point of death. In the name of the Father,
and</p>
<p>of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 3</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 339</p>
<p>This splendid bargain for a believer was in harmony with the official
con ception of indulgences for the living. Tetzel was again within the
letter of his archiepiscopal instructions when he dispensed with
preliminary confes- sion if the contributor applied the indulgence to a
soul in purgatory. Says a Catholic historian:</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Tetzel did, according to what he consid-</p>
<p>ered his authoritative instructions, proclaim as Christian doctrine
that nothing but an offering of money was required to gain the
indulgence for the dead, without there being any question of contrition
or con- fession. He also taught, in accordance with the opinion then
held,</p>
<p>that an indulgence could be applied to any given soul with unfailing
effect. Starting from this assumption, there is no doubt that his doc-
trine was virtually that of the drastic proverb: “As soon as the money
in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory’s fire springs.” The</p>
<p>papal bull of indulgence gave no sanction whatever to this
proposi-</p>
<p>tion. It was a vague Scholastic opinion . . . not any doctrine of
the</p>
<p>Church . 4</p>
<p>Myconius, a Franciscan friar perhaps hostile to the Dominicans, heard
Tetzel perform, and reported, for this year 1517: “It is incredible what
this ignorant monk said and preached. He gave sealed letters stating
that even the sins which a man was intending to commit would be
forgiven. The pope, he said, had more power than all the Apostles, all
the angels and saints, more even than the Virgin Mary herself; for these
were all subject to Christ, but the pope was equal to Christ.” This is
probably an exaggeration, but that such a description could be given by
an eyewitness suggests the antipathy that Tetzel aroused. A like
hostility appears in the rumor mentioned skepti- cally by Luther, 5
which quoted Tetzel as having said at Halle that even if, per
impossible, a man had violated the Mother of God the indulgence would
wipe away his sin. Tetzel obtained certificates from civil and
ecclesiastical authorities at Halle that they had never heard the story.
6 He was an enthusi- astic salesman, but not quite conscienceless.</p>
<p>He would have escaped history had he not approached too closely to
the lands of Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony.* Frederick was a
pious and provident ruler. He had no theoretical objection to
indulgences; he had gathered 19,000 saintly relics into his Castle
Church at Wittenberg, 7 and had arranged to have an indulgence attached
to their veneration; he had procured another indulgence for contributors
to the building of a bridge at</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1485 the domains of the house of Wettin were divided into two
regions. The smaller but richer part, containing Leipzig and Dresden,
was given to the younger son, Duke Albert, and became known as Ducal or
Albertine Saxony. The larger but less populous portion, in- cluding
Wittenberg and Weimar, was assigned to the elder brother, the Imperial
Elector Ernest, and came to be known as Electoral or Ernestine Saxony.
This division proved of some moment in the Reformation.</li>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>Torgau, and had engaged Tetzel to advertise the benefits of that
pontifical indulgence. 8 However, he had withheld from Pope Alexander VI
(1501) the sum raised in Electoral Saxony by an indulgence for donations
to a crusade against the Turks; he would release the money, he said,
when the crusade materialized. It did not; Frederick the Wise kept the
funds, and applied them to the University of Wittenberg.® Now, moved by
reluctance to let coin of Saxony emigrate, and perhaps by reports of
Tetzel’s hyper - boles, he forbade the preaching of the 1517 indulgence
in his territory. But Tetzel came so close to the frontiers that people
in Wittenberg crossed the border to obtain the indulgence. Several
purchasers brought these “papal letters” to Martin Luther, professor of
theology in the university, and asked him to attest their ef ficacy. He
refused. The refusal came to Tetzel’s ears; he denounced Luther, and
became immortal.</p>
<p>He had underestimated the pugnacity of the professor. Luther quickly
composed in Latin ninety-five theses, which he entitled Disputatio pro
dec- laratione virtutis indulgentiarum (Disputation for Clarification of
the Power of Indulgences). He did not consider his propositions
heretical, nor were they indubitably so. He was still a fervent Catholic
who had no thought of upsetting the Church; his purpose was to refute
the extravagant claims made for indulgences, and to correct the abuses
that had developed in their distri- bution. He felt that the facile
issuance and mercenary dissemination of in- dulgences had weakened the
contrition that sin should arouse, had indeed made sin a trivial matter
to be amicably adjusted over a bargain counter with a peddler of
pardons. He did not yet deny the papal “power of the keys” to forgive
sins; he conceded the authority of the pope to absolve the confessing
penitent from the terrestrial penalties imposed by churchmen; but in
Luther’s</p>
<p>At noon on October 31, 1517, Luther affixed his theses to the main
door of the Castle Church of Wittenberg. Annually, on November 1 — All
Saints’</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION IN GERMANS</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl)</p>
<p>Day — the relics collected by the Elector were displayed there, and a
large crowd could be expected. The practice of publicly announcing
theses, which the proponent offered to defend against all challengers,
was an old custom in medieval universities, and the door that Luther
used for his proclamation had been regularly employed as an academic
bulletin board. To the theses he pre- fixed an amiable invitation:</p>
<p>Out of love for the faith and the desire to bring it to light,
the</p>
<p>following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg under the</p>
<p>chairmanship of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts</p>
<p>and Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in Ordinary on the same at that</p>
<p>place. Wherefore he requests that those who are unable to be present
and debate orally with us may do so by letter.</p>
<p>To make sure that the theses would be widely understood, Luther had a
German translation circulated among the people* With characteristic
audac- ity he sent a copy of the theses to Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz.
Cour- teously, piously, unwittingly, the Reformation had begun.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>THE GENESIS OF LUTHER</li>
</ol>
<p>What circumstances of heredity and environment had molded an obscure
monk, in a town of three thousand souls, into the David of the religious
revolution?</p>
<p>His father Hans was a stern, rugged, irascible anticlerical; his
mother was a timid, modest woman much given to prayer; both were frugal
and in- dustrious. Hans was a peasant at Mohra, then a miner at
Mansfeld; but Martin was born at Eisleben on November 10, 1483. Six
other children followed. Hans and Grethe believed in the rod as a magic
wand for producing right- eousness; once, says Martin, his father beat
him so assiduously that for a long time they were open enemies; on
another occasion, for stealing a nut, his mother thrashed him till the
blood flowed; Martin later thought that “the severe and harsh life I led
with them was the reason that I afterward took refuge in the cloister
and became a monk.” 10 The picture of deity which his parents
transmitted to him reflected their own mood: a hard father and strict
judge, exacting a joyless virtue, demanding constant propitiation, and
finally damning most of mankind to everlasting hell. Both parents
believed in witches, elves, angels, and demons of many kinds and
specialties; and Martin carried most of these superstitions with him to
the end. A religion of terror in a home of rigorous discipline shared in
forming Luther’s youth and creed.</p>
<p>At school in Mansfeld there were more rods and much catechism;
Martin</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>was flogged fifteen times in one day for misdeclining a noun. At
thirteen he was advanced to a secondary school kept by a religious
brotherhood at Magdeburg. At fourteen he was transferred to the school
of St. George at Eisenach, and had three relatively happy years lodging
in the comfortable home of Frau Cotta. Luther never forgot her remark
that there was nothing on earth more precious to a man than the love of
a good woman. It was a boon that he took forty-two years to win. In this
healthier atmosphere he developed the natural charm of youth — healthy,
cheerful, sociable, frank. He sang well, and played the lute.</p>
<p>In 1501 his prospering father sent him to the university at Erfurt.
The curriculum centered around theology and philosophy, which was still
Scho- lastic; but Ockham’s nominalism had triumphed there, and
presumably Luther noted Ockham’s doctrine that popes and councils could
err. H e found Scholasticism in any form so disagreeable that he
complimented a friend on “not having to learn the dung that was offered”
as philosophy. 11 There were some mild humanists at Erfurt; he was very
slightly influenced by them; they did not care for him when they found
him in earnest about the other world. He learned a little Greek and less
Hebrew, but he read the major Latin classics. In 1505 he received the
degree of master of arts. His proud father sent him, as a graduation
present, an expensive edition of the Corpus iuris, and rejoiced when his
son entered upon the study of law. Sud- denly, after two months of such
study, and to his father’s dismay, the youth of twenty-two decided to
become a monk.</p>
<p>The decision expressed the contradiction in his character. Vigorous
to the point of sensuality, visibly framed for a life of normal
instincts, and yet in- fused by home and school with the conviction that
man is by nature sin- ful, and that sin is an offense against an
omnipotent and punishing God, he had never in thought or conduct
reconciled his natural impulses with his acquired beliefs. Passing
presumably through the usual erotic experiments and fantasies of
adolescence, he could not take these as stages of develop- ment, but
viewed them as the operations of a Satan dedicated to snaring souls into
irrevocable damnation. The conception of God that had been given him
contained hardly any element of tenderness; the consoling figure of Mary
had little place in that theology of fear, and Jesus was not the lov-
ing son who could refuse nothing to His mother; He was the Jesus of the
Last Judgment so often pictured in the churches, the Christ who had
threat- ened sinners with everlasting fire. The recurrent thought of
hell darkened a mind too intensely religious to forget it in the zest
and current of life. One day, as he was returning from his father’s
house to Erfurt (July 1505), he encountered a frightful storm. Lightning
flashed about him, and struck a near-by tree. It seemed to Luther a
warning from God that unless he gave his thoughts to salvation, death
would surprise him unshriven and damned.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 343</p>
<p>Where could he live a life of saving devotion? Only where four walls
would exclude, or ascetic discipline would overcome, the world, the
flesh, and the devil: only in a monastery. He made a vow to St. Anne
that if he sur- vived that storm he would become a monk.</p>
<p>There were twenty cloisters in Erfurt. He chose one known for
faithful observance of monastic rules — that of the Augustinian
Eremites. He called his friends together, drank and sang with them for
what he told them was the last time, and on the morrow he was received
as a novice in a monastery cell. He performed the lowliest duties with a
proud humility. He recited prayers in self-hypnotizing repetition, he
froze in an unheated cubicle, he fasted and scourged himself, in the
hope of exorcizing devils from his body. “I was a pious monk, and so
strictly observed the rules of my order that . . . if ever a monk got
into heaven by monkery, so should I also have gotten there. … If it had
lasted longer I should have tortured myself to death with watching ,
praying, reading, and other work.” 12 On one occasion, when he had not
been seen for several days, friends broke into his cell and found him
lying senseless on the ground. They had brought a lute; one played it;
he revived, and thanked them. In September 1 506, he took the
irrevocable vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience; and in May 1507,
he was ordained a priest.</p>
<p>His fellow friars gave him friendly counsel. One assured him that the
Passion of Christ had atoned for the sinful nature of man, and had
opened to redeemed man the gates of paradise. Luther’s reading of the
German mystics, especially of Tauler, gave him hope of bridging the
awful gap between a naturally sinful soul and a righteous, omnipotent
God. Then a treatise by John Huss fell into his hands, and doctrinal
doubts were added to his spiritual turmoil; he wondered why “a man who
could write so Christianly and so powerfully had been burned. … I shut
the book and turned away with a wounded heart.” 13 Johann von Staupitz,
provincial vicar of the Augustinian Eremites, took a fatherly interest
in the troubled friar, and bade him replace asceticism with careful
reading of the Bible and St. Augustine. The monks expressed their
solicitude by giving him a Latin Bible — then a rare possession for an
individual.</p>
<p>One day in 1508 or 1509 he was struck by a sentence in St. Paul’s
Epistle to the Romans (1:17): “The just shall live by faith.” Slowly
these words led him to the doctrine that m an can be “justified”— i.e.,
made just and there- fore saved from hell — not by good works, which
could never suffice to atone for sins against an infinite deity, but
only by complete faith in Christ and in his atonement for mankind. In
Augustine Luther found another idea that perhaps renewed his terror —
predestination — that God, even before the crea- tion, had forever
destined some souls to salvation, the rest to hell; and that the elect
had been chosen by God’s free will to be saved by the divine sac ri-</p>
<p>344 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>fice of Christ. From that consistent absurdity he fled back again to
his basic hope of salvation by faith.</p>
<p>In 1508, by the recommendation of Staupitz, he was transferred to an
Augustinian monastery at Wittenberg, and to the post of instructor in
logic and physics, then professor of theology, in the university.
Wittenberg was the northern capital — seldom the residence — of
Frederick the Wise. A con- temporary pronounced it “a poor,
insignificant town, with littl e, old, ugly wooden houses.” Luther
described the inhabitants as “beyond measure drunken, rude, and given to
reveling”; they had the reputation of being the amplest drinkers in
Saxony, which was rated the most drunken province of Germany. One mile
to the east, said Luther, civilization ended and barbarism began. Here,
for the most part, he remained to the close of his days.</p>
<p>He must have become by this time an exemplary monk, for in October
1510, he and a fellow friar were sent to Rome on some obscure mission
for the Augustinian Eremites. His first reaction on sighting the city
was one of pious awe; he prostrated himself, raised his hands, and
cried: “Hail to thee, O holy Rome!” He went through all the devotions of
a pilgrim, bowed reverently before saintly relics, climbed the Scala
Santa on his knees, visited a score of churches, and earned so many
indulgences that he almost wished his parents were dead, so that he
might deliver them from purgatory. He explored the Roman Forum, but was
apparently unmoved by the Ren- aissance art with which Raphael,
Michelangelo, and a hundred others were beginning to adorn the capital.
For many years after this trip he made no extant comment on the
worldliness of the Roman clergy or the immorality then popular in the
holy city. Ten years later, however, and still more in the sometimes
imaginative reminiscences of his Table Talk in old age, he described the
Rome of 1510 as “an abomination,” the popes as worse than pagan
emperors, and t he papal court as being “served at supper by twelve</p>
<p>After his return to Wittenberg (F ebruary 1 y 1 1 ) he was rapidly
advanced in the pedagogical scale, and was made provincial vicar-general
of his order. He gave courses in the Bible, preached regularly in the
parish church, and carried on the work of his office with industry and
devotion. Says a distin- guished Catholic scholar:</p>
<p>His official letters breathe a deep solicitude for the wavering,
a</p>
<p>gentle sympathy for the fallen; they show profound touches of</p>
<p>religious feeling and rare practical sense, though not unmarred with
counsels that have unorthodox tendencies. The plague which afflicted
Wittenberg in 15 id found him courageously at his post, which</p>
<p>spite of the concern of his friends, he would not abandonr 15</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 345</p>
<p>Slowly, during these years (1512-17), his religious ideas moved away
from the official doctrines of the Church. He began to speak of “our
theol - ogy,” in contrast with that which was taught at Erfurt. In 1 5 1
5 he ascribed the corruption of the world to the clergy, who delivered
to the people too many maxims and fables of human invention, and not the
Scriptural world of God. In 1516 he discovered an anonymous German
manuscript, whose mystic piety so supported his own view of the utter
dependence of the soul, for salvation, on divine grace that he edited
and published it as Theol- ogia Germanica or Deutsche Theologie. He
blamed the preachers of indul- gences for taking advantage of the
simplicity of the poor. In private cor- respondence he began to identify
the Antichrist of John’s First Epistle with the pope. 16 In July 1517,
invited by Duke George of Albertine Saxony to preach in Dresden, he
argued that the mere acceptance of the merits of Christ assured t he
believer’s salvation. The Duke complained that such stress on faith
rather than virtue “would only make the people presump - tuous and
mutinous.” 17 Three months later the reckless friar challenged the</p>

<li>THE REVOLUTION TAKES FORM</li>

<p>Cranach’s woodcut of 1520 may reasonably suggest the Luther of 1517:
a tonsured monk of middle stature, temporarily slender, with large eyes
of serious intent, larger nose, and resolute chin, a face not
pugnaciously but quietly announcing courage and character. Yet it was
honest anger, rather than jejune audacity, that wrote the theses. The
local bishop saw nothing heretical in them, but mildly advised Luther to
write no more on the subject for a while. The author himself was at
first dismayed by the furor he had aroused. In May 1 5 1 8, he told
Staupitz that his real ambition was to lead a life of quiet retirement.
He deceived himself; he relished battle.</p>
<p>The theses became the talk of literate Germany. Thousands had waited
for such a protest, and the pent-up anticlericalism of generations
thrilled at having found a voice. The sale of indulgences declined. But
many champions rose to meet the challenge. Tetzel himself, with some
professional aid, re- plied in One Hundred and Six Anti-Theses (December
1517). He made no concessions or apologies, but “gave at times an
uncompromising, even dog - matic, sanction to mere theological opinions
that were hardly consonant with the most accurate scholarship.” 18 When
this publication reached Wit - tenberg a hawker offering it for sale was
mobbed by university students, and his stock of 800 copies was burned in
the market square — a proceeding of which Luther joyously disapproved.
He answered Tetzel in “A Sermon on Indulgences and Grace,” concluding
with a characteristic defiance: “If</p>
<p>34 &lt;S the reformation (ghap.xvk</p>
<p>I am called a heretic by those whose purses will suffer from my
truths, I care not much for their brawling; for only those say this
whose dark understand- ing has never known the Bible.” 19 Jakob van
Hoogstraeten of Cologne thun - dered invectives against Luther, and
suggested burning him at the stake. Johann Eck, Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Ingolstadt, issued a pam- phlet, Obelisci (March 1518),
which charged Luther with disseminating “Bohemian poison” (the heresies
of Huss), and subverting a ll ecclesiastical order. In Rome Sylvester
Prierias, papal censor of literature, published a Dialogue “maintaining
the absolute supremacy of the pope in terms not al - together free from
exaggeration, especially stretching his theory to an un- warrantab le
point in dealing with indulgences.” 20</p>
<p>Luther countered in a Latin brochure Resolutiones (April 1518),
copies of which he sent to his local bishop and to the Pope — in both
cases with as- surances of orthodoxy and submission. The text spoke
quite handsomely of LeoX:</p>
<p>Although there are in the Church both very learned and very holy</p>
<p>men, it is nevertheless the infelicity of our age that even they . .
.</p>
<p>cannot succor the Church. . . . Now at last we have a most excellent
Pontiff, Leo X, whose integrity and learning are a delight to all
good</p>
<p>men’s ears. But what can that most benign of men do alone, in so
great</p>
<p>In this age we are worthy only of such popes as Julius II and
Alex-</p>
<p>ander VI Rome herself, yea, Rome most of all, now laughs at good</p>
<p>men; in what part of the Christian world do men more freely make a
mock of the best bishops than in Rome, the true Babylon?</p>
<p>To Leo directly he professed an unwonted humility:</p>
<p>Most blessed Father, I offer myself prostrate at the feet of your</p>
<p>Holiness, with all that I am and have. Quicken, slay, call, recall,
ap-</p>
<p>prove, reprove, as may seem to you good. I will acknowledge your</p>
<p>voice as the voice of Christ, residing and speaking in you. If I
have</p>
<p>deserved death I will not refuse to die. 21</p>
<p>However, as Leo’s advisers noted, the Resolutiones affirmed the
superiority of an ecumenical council to the pope, spoke slightingly of
relics and pil- grimages, denied the surplus merits of the saints, and
rejected all additions made by the popes in the last three centuries to
the theory and practice of indulgences. As these were a prime source of
papal revenue, and Leo was at his wits’ end to finance his
philanthropies, amusements, and wars, as well as the administration and
building program of the Church, the harassed Pontiff, who had at first
brushed the dispute aside as a passing fracas among monks, now took the
matter in hand, and summoned Luther to Rome (July 7,1518).</p>
<p>Luther faced a critical decision. Even if the most genial of popes
should</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 347</p>
<p>treat him leniently, he might find himself politely silenced and
buried in a Roman monastery, to be soon forgotten by those who now
applauded him. He wrote to Georg Spalatin, chaplain to Elector
Frederick, suggesting that German princes should protect their citizens
from compulsory ex- tradition to Italy. The Elector agreed. He had a
high regard for Luther, who had made the University of Wittenberg
prosper; and besides, Emperor Max, seeing in Luther a possible card to
play in diplomatic contests with Rome, advised the Elector to “take good
care of that monk.” 22</p>
<p>At this very time the Emperor had summoned an Imperial Diet to meet
at Augsburg to consider the Pope’s request that it should tax Germany to
help finance a new crusade against the Turks. The clergy (Leo proposed)
should pay a tenth, the laity a twelfth, of their income, and every
fifty householders should furnish one man. The Diet refused; on the
contrary, it firmly restated the grievances that were providing the
background of Luther’s success. It pointed out to the papal legate that
Germany had often taxed herself for crusades, only to see the funds used
for other papal pur- poses; that the people would vigorously oppose any
further remission of money to Italy; that the annates, confirmation
fees, and costs of canonical litigation referred to Rome were already an
intolerable burden; and that German benefices were given as plums to
Italian priests. So bold a rejection of papal requests, said one
delegate, had never been known in German his- tory. 23 Noting the spirit
of rebellion among the princes, Maximilian wrote to Rome advising
caution in the treatment of Luther, but promising co- operation in
suppressing heresy .</p>
<p>Leo was disposed or compelled to lenience; indeed, a Protestant
historian has ascribed the triumph of the Reformation to the moderation
of the Pope. 24 He put aside the order for Luther’s appearance in Rome;
instead he bade him present himself at Augsburg before Cardinal Cajetan,
and answer charges of indiscipline and heresy. He instructed his legate
to offer Luther full pardon, and future dignities, if he would recant
and submit; otherwise the secular authorities should be asked to send
him to Rome. 25 About the same time Leo announced his intention of
presenting to Frederick an honor that the pious Elector had long coveted
— that “Golden Rose” which the popes bestowed upon secular rulers whom
they wished to signalize with their highest favor. Probably Leo now
offered to support Frederick as suc- cessor to the Imperial crown 26</p>
<p>Armed with an Imperial safe-conduct, Luther met Cajetan at Augsburg
(October 12-14, 1 5 1 8 ) . The Cardinal was a man of great theological
learn- ing and exemplary life, but he misread his function to be that of
judge, not diplomat. As he saw the matter, it was primarily a question
of ecclesiastical discipline and order: should a monk be allowed to
criticize publicly his supe- riors — to whom he had vowed obedience —
and to advocate views condemned</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>by the Church? Refusing to discuss the right or wrong of Luther’s
state - ments, he demanded a retraction and a pledge never again to
disturb the peace of the Church. Each lost patience with the other.
Luther returned im- penitent to Wittenberg; Cajetan asked Frederick to
send him to Rome; Frederick refused. Luther wrote a spirited account of
the interviews, which was circulated throughout Germany. In forwarding
it to his friend Wenzel Link, he added: “I send you my trifling work
that you may see wheth er I am not right in supposing that, according to
Paul, the real Antichrist holds sway over the Roman court. I think he is
worse than any Turk.” 27 In a milder letter to Duke George he asked that
“a common reformation should be undertaken of the spirit ual and
temporal estates” 28 — his first known use of the word that was to give
his rebellion its historic name.</p>
<p>Leo continued his efforts for conciliation. By a bull of November 9,
1 5 1 8, he repudiated many of the extreme claims for indulgences; these
forgave neither sins nor guilt, but only those earthly penalties that
the Church — not secular rulers — had imposed; as to releasing souls
from purgatory, the power of the pope was limited to his prayers,
beseeching God to apply to a dead soul the surplus merits of Christ and
the saints. On November 28 Luther issued an appeal from the judgment of
the pope to that of a general council. In that same month Leo
commissioned Karl von Miltitz, a young Saxon nobleman in minor orders in
Rome, to take the Golden Rose to Frederick, and also to make a quiet
effort to bring Luther, that “child of Satan,” back to obedience. 29</p>
<p>On reaching Germany, Miltitz was astonished to find half the country
openly hostile to the Roman See. Among his own friends in Augsburg and
Nuremberg three out of five were for Luther. In Saxony anti-papal
feeling ran so strong that he divested himself of all indications that
he was a papal commissioner. When he met Luther at Altenburg (January 3,
1519), he found him more open to reason than to fear. Probably at this
stage Luther was sincerely anxious to preserve the unity of Western
Christendom. He made generous concessions: to observe silence if his
opponents would do likewise; to write a letter of submission to the
Pope; to acknowledge publicly the propriety of prayers to the saints,
the reality of purgatory, and the use- fulness of indulgences in
remitting canonical penances; and to recommend to the people a peaceful
allegiance to the Church; meanwhile the details of the controversy were
to be submitted for adjudication to some German bishop acceptable to
both parties. 80 Well pleased, Miltitz went to Leipzig, summoned Tetzel,
reproved him for excesses, accused him of mendacity and embezzlement,
and dismissed him. Tetzel retired to his monastery, and died soon
afterward (August 11,1519). On his deathbed he received a kindly letter
from Luther, assuring him that the indulgence sale was only an oc-
casion, no t a cause, of the disturbance, “that the affair had not been
begun</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 349</p>
<p>on that account, but that the child had quite another father.” 81 On
March 3 Luther wrote to the Pope a letter of complete submission. Leo
replied in a friendly spirit (March 29), inviting him to come to Rome to
make his confession, and offering him money for the journey. 82 However,
with con- sistent inconsistency, Luther had w ritten to Spalatin on
March 13: “I am at a loss to know whether the Pope is Antichrist or his
apostle.” 88 Under the circumstances he thought it safer to stay in
Wittenberg.</p>
<p>There the faculty, students, and citizens were predominantly friendly
to his cause. He was especially happy to receive the support of a
brilliant young humanist and theologian whom the Elector had appointed
in 1518, at the age of twenty-one, to teach Greek at the university.
Philipp Schwarzert (Black Earth) had had his name Hellenized as
Melanchthon by his great- uncle Reuchlin. A man of small stature, frail
physique, halting gait, homely features, lofty brow, and timid eyes,
this intellectual of the Reformation became so loved in Wittenberg that
five or six hundred students crowded his lecture room, and Luther
himself, who described him as having “almost every virtue known to man,”
84 humbly sat among his pupils. “Melanch - thon,” said Erasmus, “is a
man of gentle nature; even his enemies speak well of him.” 85 Luther
enjoy ed combat; Melanchthon longed for peace and conciliation. Luther
sometimes chided him as immoderately moderate; but Luther’s noblest and
mildest side showed in his uninterrupted affection for one so opposed to
him in temperament and policy.</p>
<p>I have been born to war, and fight with factions and devils;
there-</p>
<p>fore my books are stormy and warlike. I must root out the stumps</p>
<p>and stocks, cut away the thorns and hedges, fill up the ditches, and
am the rough forester to break a path and make things ready. But Master
Philip walks softly and silently, tills and plants, sows and waters with
pleasure, as God has gifted him richly. 88</p>
<p>Another Wittenberg professor shone with a fiercer light than Melanch-
thon’s. Andreas Bodenstein, known from his birthplace as Carlstadt, had
joined the university staff at the age of twenty-four (1504); at thirty
he received the chair of Thomistic philosophy and theology. On April 13,
1 5 1 7, he anticipated Luther’s his toric protest by publishing 152
theses against indulgences. At first opposed to Luther, he soon turned
into an ardent sup- porter, “hotter in the matter than I,” said the
great rebel. 87 When Eck’s Obelisci challenged Luther’s theses Carlstadt
defended them in 406 propo- sitions; one of these contained the first
definite declaration, in the German Reformation, of the Bible’s
paramount authority over the decretals and traditions of the Church. Eck
replied with a challenge to a public debate; Carlstadt readily agreed,
and Luther made the arrangements. Eck then pub- lished a prospectus
listing thirteen theses which he offered to prove in the</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>350</p>
<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>debate. One ran; &lt;f We deny that the Roman Church was not superior
to other churches before the time of Sylvester; we have always
recognized the possessor of Peter’s chair as his successor and as the
vicar of Christ.” But it was not Carlstadt, it was Luther who, in the
Resolutiones, had raised the point that in the first centuries of
Christianity the Roman See had no more authority than several other
bishops of the Church. Luther felt himself challenged, and claimed that
Eck’s thesis freed him from his vow of silence. He determined to join
Carlstadt in the theological tournament.</p>
<p>In June 1519, the two warriors rode off to Leipzig, accompanied
by</p>
<p>Melanchthon and six other professors, and escorted in country carts
by 200 Wittenberg students armed and armored as if for battle; and in
truth they were entering territory hostile to Luther. In the great
tapestried hall of Pleissenburg Castle, packed with excited spectators,
and under the presi- dency of the orthodox Duke George of Albertine
Saxony, Eck and Carlstadt began the joust between the old and the new
(June 27). Hardly anyone in Leipzig cared that on the morrow a new
emperor was to be elected at Frank- furt-am- Main. After Carlstadt had
for days suffered under Eck’s superior argumentative skill, Luther took
the stand for Wittenberg. He was brilliant and powerful in debate, but
recklessly candid. He denied emphatically the primacy of the bishop of
Rome in the early days of Christianity, and re- minded his mostly
antipathetic audience that the widespread Greek Ortho- dox Church still
rejected the supremacy of Rome. When Eck charged that Luther’s view
echoed that of Huss, which the Council of Constance had condemned,
Luther replied that even ecumenical councils could err, and that many
doctrines of Huss were sound. When this debate ended (July 8), Eck had
accomplished his real purpose — to have Luther commit himself to a
definite heresy. The Reformation now advanced from a minor dispute about
indulgences to a major challenge of papal authority over
Christendom.</p>
<p>Eck passed on to Rome, presented to the Curia a report of the
disputation, and recommended the excommunication of Luther. Leo was not
so precipi- tate; he still hoped for some peaceable solution, and he was
too distant from Germany to realize how far the revolt had gone.
Prominent and respected citizens like Johan Holzschuher, Lazarus
Spengler, and Willibald Pirkheimer spoke up for Luther; Differ prayed
for his success; the humanists were send- ing forth a cloud of pamphlets
satirizing the papacy with all the exuberant vituperation characteristic
of the age. Ulrich von Hutten, on reaching Augs- burg in 1518, turned
his rhymes against Leo’s call for crusading funds, and expressed the
hope that the collectors would go home with empty bags. When news came
of the Leipzig debate he hailed Luther as the liberator of Germany, and
from that time his pen was a sword for the Reform. He en- listed among
Franz von Sickingen’s knights— who were itching for rev- olution — and
induced him to offer Luther all the support and protection that</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 35I</p>
<p>his armed band could provide. Luther replied in warm appreciation,
but was not ready to use force in defense of his person.</p>
<p>In March 1520, Hutten published an old German manuscript written in
the time of the Emperor Henry IV (r. 1056-1 106), and supporting Henry
in his struggle against Pope Gregory VII. He dedicated the book to the
young Emperor Charles V, as a hint that Germany expected him to avenge
Henry’s humiliation an d defeat. To free Germany from Rome, said Hutten,
was of greater urgency than to repel the Turks. “While our forefathers
thought it unworthy of them to submit to the Romans when these were the
most martial nation in the world, we not only submit to these effeminate
slaves of lust and luxury, but suffer ourselves to be plundered to
minister to their sensuality.” 38 In April 1520, Hutten issued the first
of two series of</p>
<p>But the center of the war remained in little Wittenberg. In the
spring of 1520 Luther published, with furious notes, an Epitome in which
he quoted the most recent and still uncompromising claims made by
orthodox theolo- gians for the primacy and powers of the popes. Luther
met extremes with extremes:</p>
<p>If Rome thus believes and teaches with the knowledge of popes and
cardinals (which I hope is not the case), then in these writings I
freely declare that the true Antichrist is sitting in the temple of God
and is reigning in Rome — that empurpled Babylon — and that the
Roman</p>
<p>Curia is the Synagogue of Satan. … If the fury of the Romanists
thus</p>
<p>goes on, there will be no remedy left except that the emperors,
kings, and princes, girt about with force and arms, should attack these
pests of the world, and settle the matter no longer by words but by
the</p>
<p>sword. … If we strike thieves with the gallows, robbers with the</p>
<p>sword, heretics with fire, why do we not much more attack in arms</p>
<p>these masters of perdition, these cardinals, these popes, and all
this sink of the Roman Sodom which has without end corrupted the</p>
<p>Church of God, and wash our hands in their blood? 41</p>
<p>352 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Later in the same year Carlstadt issued a “little book”— De canonicis
scrip - turis libellus-exakmg the Bible over popes, councils, and
traditions, and the Gospels over the Epistles; if Luther had followed
this last line, Protestantism might have been less Pauline, Augustinian,
and predestinarian. The libellus was ahead of its time in doubting the
Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, and the full authenticity of the
Gospels. But it was weak in its central argument: it decided the
authenticity of Biblical books by the traditions of the early centuries,
and then rejected tradition in favor of the books so certified.</p>
<p>Heartened by the support of Melanchthon and Carlstadt, Hutten and
Sickingen, Luther wrote to Spalatin (June 1 1, 1520):</p>
<p>I have cast the die. I now despise the rage of the Romans as much</p>
<p>as I do their favor. I will not reconcile myself to them for all
eternity.</p>
<p>. . . Let them condemn and bum all that belongs to me; in return
I</p>
<p>will do as much for them. . . . Now I no longer fear, and I am
publish- ing a book in the German tongue about Christian reform,
directed</p>
<p>against the pope, in language as violent as if I were addressing
Anti- christ. 43</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>BULLS AND BLASTS</li>
</ol>
<p>On June 1 5, 1 5 20, Leo X issued a bull, Exsurge Domine, which
condemned forty-one statements by Luther, ordered the public burning of
the writings in which these had appeared, and exhorted Luther to abjure
his errors and return to the fold. After sixty days of further refusal
to come to Rome and make a public recantation, he was to be cut off from
Christendom by ex- communication, he was to be shunned as a heretic by
all the faithful, all places where he stayed were to suspend religious
services, and all secular authorities were to banish him from their
dominions or deliver him to Rome.</p>
<p>Luther marked the end of his period of grace by publishing the first
of three little books that constituted a program of religious
revolution. Hither- to he had written in Latin for the intellectual
classes; now he wrote in Ger- man — and as a German patriot — An Open
Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation Concerning the
Reform of the Christian Estate. He in- cluded in his appeal the “noble
youth” who, a y ear before, had been chosen emperor as Charles V, and
whom “God has given us to be our head, thereby awakening great hopes of
good in many hearts.” 48 Luther attacked the “three walls” that the
papacy had built around itself: the distinction between</p>
<p>First, there is no real difference between clergy and laity; every
Christian</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 353</p>
<p>is made a priest by baptism. Secular rulers, therefore, should
exercise their powers “without let or hindrance, regardless whether it
be pope, bishop or priest whom they affect. . , . All that the canon law
has said to the contrary is sheer invention of Roman presumption.” 44
Second, smce every Christian is a priest, he has the right to interpret
the Scriptures according to his own light, 45 Third, Scripture should be
our final authority for doctrine or prac- tice, and Scripture offers no
warrant for the exclusive right of the pope to call a council. If he
seeks by excommunication or interdict to prevent a council, “we should
despise his conduct as that of a madman, and, relying on God, hurl back
the ban on him, and coerce him as best we can.” 46 A council should be
called very soon; it should examine the “horrible” anomaly that the head
of Christendom lives in more worldly splendor than any king; it should
end the appropriation of German benefices by Italian clergymen; it
should reduce to a hundredth the “swarm of vermin” holding
ecclesiastical sinecures in Rome and living chiefly on money from
Germany.</p>
<p>Some have estimated that every year more than 300,000 gulden</p>
<p>find their way from Germany to Italy. . . . We here come to the heart
of the matter . . . . How comes it that we Germans must put up with such
robbery and such extortion of our property at the hands of the pope? …
If we justly hang thieves and behead robbers, why should</p>
<p>we let Roman avarice go free? For he is the greatest thief and robber
that has come or can come into the world, and all in the holy name</p>
<p>of Christ and St. Peter! Who can longer endure it or keep silence?
47</p>
<p>Why should the German Church pay this perpetual tribute to a foreign
power? Let the German clergy throw off their subjection to Rome, and
establish a national church under the leadership of the Archbishop of
Mainz. Mendicant orders should be reduced, priests should be allowed to
marry, no binding monastic vows should be taken before the age of
thirty; interdicts, pilgrimages, Masses for the dead, and holydays
(except Sundays) should be abolished. The German Church should be
reconciled with the Hussites of Bohemia; Huss was burned in flagrant
violation of the safe-conduct given him by the emperor; and in any case
“we should vanquish heretics with books, not with burning.” 48 All canon
law should be discarded; there should be only one law, for clergy and
laity alike.</p>
<p>Above all, we should drive out from German lands the papal legates
with their “powers”— which they sell us for large sums of money —</p>
<p>to legalize unjust gains, dissolve oaths, vows, and agreements,
saying that the pope has authority to do this — though it is sheer
knavery.</p>
<p>… If there were no other evil wiles to prove that the pope is the</p>
<p>true Antichrist, this one thing would be enough to prove it.

<p>This headlong assault of one man against a power that pervaded ail
West- ern Europe became the sensation of Germany. Cautious men
considered it intemperate and rash; many reckoned it among the most
heroic deeds in German history. The first edition of the Open Letter was
soon exhausted, and the presses of Wittenberg were kept busy with new
printings. Germany, like England, was ripe for an appeal to nationalism;
there was as yet no Germany on the map, but there were Germans, newly
conscious of them- selves as a people. As Huss had stressed his Bohemian
patriotism, as Henry VIII would reject not Catholic doctrine but papal
power over England, so Luther now planted his standard of revolt not in
theological deserts, but in the rich soil of the German national spirit.
Wherever Protestantism won, nationalism carried the flag.</p>
<p>In September 1520, Eck and Jerome Aleander promulgated the bull of
excommunication in Germany. Luther fought back with a second manifesto,
The Babylonian Captivity of the Church (October 6). Addressed to theo-
logians and scholars, it reverted to Latin, but it was soon translated,
and had almost as much influence on Christian doctrine as the Open
Letter had on ecclesiastical and political history. As the Jews had
suffered a long captivity in Babylonia, so the Church as established by
Christ, and as described in the New Testament, had undergone over a
thousand years of captivity under the papacy in Rome. During that period
the religion of Christ had been cor- rupted in faith, morals, and
ritual. Since Christ had given his Apostles wine as well as bread at the
Last Supper, the Hussites were right: the Eucharist should be
administered in both forms wherever the people so desired. The priest
does not change the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ; no
priest has such mystical potency; but to the fervent communicant Christ
comes spiritually and substantially, not through any miraculous
transfor- mation by a priest, but by His own will and power; He is
present in the Eucharist along with bread and wine, by
consubstantiation, not by transub- stantiation. 50 Luther rejected with
horror the notion that in the Mass the priest offers up Christ to His
Father as a sacrifice in aton ement for man’s sins — though he found
nothing horrible in the idea that God had allowed man to crucify God as
a sacrifice to God in atonement for man’s sins.</p>
<p>’ To these theological subtleties he added some ethical novelties.
Marriage is not a sacrament, for Christ made no promise to infuse it
with divine grace. “The marriages of the ancients were no less sacred
than ours, nor are those of unbelievers less true.” 51 Consequently
there should be no prohibition of marriage between Christians and non-Ch
ristians. “Just as I may eat, drink,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 355</p>
<p>sleep, walk . . . and do business with a heathen, a Jew, a Turk, or a
heretic, so also I may marry any of them. Do not give heed to the fool’s
law which</p>
<p>forbids this A heathen is just as much a man or a woman created by
God</p>
<p>as St. Peter, St. Paul, or St. Lucy.” 52 A woman married to an
impotent hus - band should be allowed, if he consents, to have
intercourse with another man in order to have a child, and should be
permitted to pass the child off as her husband’s. If the husband refuses
consent she may justly divorce him. Yet divorce is an endless tragedy;
perhaps bigamy would be better. 53 Then, adding defiance to heresy,
Luther concluded: “I hear a rumor of new bulls and papal maledictions
sent out against me, in which I am urged to recant. … If that is true, I
desire this book to be a portion of the recantation I shall make.”
54</p>
<p>Such a taunt should have deflected Miltitz from still dreaming of a
rec- onciliation. Nevertheless he again sought out Luther (October n,
1520), and persuaded him to send to Pope Leo a letter disclaiming any
intent to attack him personally, and presenting temperately the case for
reform. For his part Miltitz would try to secure a revocation of the
bull. Luther, the thirty-seven-year- old “peasant, son of a peasant” (as
he proudly called him - self), wrote a letter not of apology but of
almost paternal counsel to the forty-five-year-old heir of St. Peter and
the Medici. He expressed his respect for the Pope as an individual, but
condemned without compromise the cor- ruption of the papacy in the past,

<p>Along with this letter Luther sent to Leo the third of his
manifestoes. He called it A Treatise on Christian Liberty (November
1520), and felt that “unless I am deceived, it is the whole of Christian
living in a brief form.” 66</p>
<p>While Luther was writing these historic treatises, Eck and Aleander
were encountering the religious revolution at first hand. In Meissen,
Merseburg, and Brandenburg they were successful in proclaiming the bull
of excom- munication; at Nuremberg they elicited apologies from
Pirkheimer and Spengler; at Mainz Archbishop Albrecht, after flirting a
while with the Ref- ormation, excluded Hutten from his court and
imprisoned the printers of Hutten’s books; at Ingolstadt Luther’s books
were confiscated, and in Mainz, Louvain, and Cologne they were burned.
But at Leipzig, Torgau, and Dobeln the posted bull was pelted with dirt
and torn down; at Erfurt many professors and clergymen joined in a
general refusal to recognize the bull, and students threw all available
copies into the river; finally Eck fled from the scenes of his triumphs
a year before. 69</p>
<p>Luther denounced the ban in a series of bitter pamphlets, in one of
which he fully approved the doctrines of Huss. About August 31, 1 520,
as “a single flea daring to address the king of kings,” he appealed to
the Emperor for protection; and on November 17 he published a formal
appeal from the Pope to a free council of the Church. When he learned
that the papal en- voys were burning his books, he decided to reply in
kind. He issued an in- vitation to the “pious and studious youths” of
Wittenberg to assemble outside the Elster gate of the city on the
morning of December 10. There, with his own hands, he cast the papal
bull into a fire, along with some canonical decretals and volumes of
Scholastic theology; in one act he symbolized his rejection of canon
law, of Aquinas’s philosophy, and of anv coerc ive au-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 357</p>
<p>thority of the Church. The students joyfully collected other books of
the kind, and with them kept the fire burning till late afternoon.</p>
<p>On December 1 1 Luther proclaimed that no man could be saved unless
he renounced the rule of the papacy. 60 The monk had excommunicated the
pope.</p>
<p>V. THE DIET OF WORMS: 1 52 1</p>
<p>A third actor now mounted the stage, and from this moment played
through thirty years a major role in the conflict of theologies and
states. In a dozen chapters he will impinge upon our narrative.</p>
<p>The future Emperor Charles V began with a royal but tarnished
heredity. His paternal grandparents were the Emperor Maximilian and Mary
of Bur- gundy, daughter of Charles the Bold; his maternal grandparents
were Fer- dinand and Isabella; his father was Philip the Handsome, King
of Castile at twenty-six, dead at twenty-eight; his mother was Juana la
Loca, who went insane when Charles was six, and survived till he was
fifty-five. He was bom in Ghent (February 24, 1500), was brought up in
Brussels, and remained Flemish in speech and character till his final
retirement in Spain; neither Spain nor Germany forgave him. But in time
he learned to speak German, Spanish, Italian, and French, and could be
silent in five languages. Adrian of Utrecht tried to teach him
philosophy, with inconsiderable success. From this good bishop he
received a strong infusion of religious orthodoxy, yet he probably
imbibed, in middle age, a secret skepticism from his Flemish ad- visers
and courtiers, among whom an Erasmian indifference to dogma was
smilingly popular. Some priests complained of the freedom allowed to
reli- gious opinion in Charles’s entourage. 61 He made a point of piety,
but studied carefully the art of war. He read Comines, and learned
almost in childhood the tricks of diplomacy and the unmorality of
states.</p>
<p>On his father’s death (1506) he inherited Fl anders, Holland,
Franche- Comte, and a claim to Burgundy. At fifteen he assumed the
government, and devoted himself to administration. At sixteen he became
Charles I, King of Spain, Sicily, Sardinia, Naples, and Spanish America.
At nineteen he aspired to be emperor. Francis I of France sought the
same honor at the same time, and the Imperial Electors were pleased with
his douceurs ; but Charles spent 850,000 florins on the contest, and won
(1519). To assemble this heavy Trinkgelt he borrowed 543,000 florins
from the Fuggers; 62 from that time Charles was for the Fuggers and the
Fuggers were for Charles. When he dallied in repaying the loan, Jakob
Fugger II sent him a sharp reminder:</p>
<p>It is well known that your Majesty without me might not have</p>
<p>acquired the Imperial honor, as I can attest with the written
state-</p>
<p>ments of all the delegates. . . . And in all this I have looked not
to my</p>
<p>35 »</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>own profit. . . . My respectful request is that you will graciously .
. .</p>
<p>order that the money which I have paid out, together with the inter-
est on it, shall be returned without further delay. 88</p>
<p>Charles met part of his obligation by giving the Fuggers a lien on
the port duties of Antwerp. 64 When the Fuggers were almost ruined by
Turkish conquests in Hungary, he came to their rescue by turning over to
them control of Spanish mines. 65 Henceforth the key to much political
history would be Cherchez le banquier.</p>
<p>The youth who at nineteen found himself titular head of all Central
and Western Europe except England, France, Portugal, and the Papal
States was already marked by the feeble health that was to multiply his
vicissitudes. Pale, short, homely, with aquiline nose and sharp,
challenging chin, feeble in voice and grave of mien, he was kindly and
affable by nature, but he soon learned that a ruler must maintain
distance and bearing, that silence is half of diplomacy, and that an
open sense of humor dims the aura of royalty. Aleander, meeting him in
1520, reported to Leo X: “This prince seems to me well endowed with . .
. prudence beyond his years, and to have much more at the back of his
head than he carries on his face.” 66 He was not mentally keen, except
in judging men — which is half the battle; he barely rose to the crises
that confronted him — but that was much indeed. A conserving indolence
of body and mind kept him inert until the situation demanded decision;
then he met it with sudden resolution and resourceful pertinacity.
Wisdom came to him not by nature but by trials.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1520, Charles V, no older than the century, went
to</p>
<p>Charlemagne’s Aachen to be crowned. Elector Frederick started out to
attend the ceremony, but was stopped at Cologne by gout. There Aleander
presented to him another plea for the arrest of Luther. Frederick called
in Erasmus and asked his advice. Erasmus defended Luther, pointed out
that there were crying abuses in the Church, and argued that efforts to
remedy them should not be suppressed. When Frederick asked him what were
Luther’s chief errors, he replied: “Two: he attacked the pope in his
crown and the monks in their bellies.” 67 He questioned the authenticity
of t he papal bull; it seemed to him irreconcilable with the known
gentleness of Leo X. 68 Frederick informed the nuncio that Luther had
lodged an appeal, and that until its results were known, Luther should
remain free.</p>
<p>The Emperor gave the same answer; he had promised the electors, as a
condition of his election, that no German would be condemned without a
fair trial in Germany. However, his position made orthodoxy imperative.
He was more firmly established as King of Spain than as Emperor in a
Ger- many that resented centralized government; and the clergy of Spain
would not long bear with a monarch lenient to heretics. Besides, war
loomed with</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 359</p>
<p>France; it would be fought over Milan as the prize; there the support
of the pope would be worth an army. The Holy Roman Empire was tied to
the papacy in a hundred ways; the fall of one would profoundly injure
the other; how could the Emperor rule his scattered and diverse realm
without the aid of the Church in moral discipline and political
administration? Even now his chief ministers were clergymen. And he
needed ecclesiastical funds and influence to protect Hungary from the
Turks.</p>
<p>It was with these varied problems in mind, rather than the question
of a refractory monk, that Charles summoned an Imperial Diet to meet at
Worms. But when the leading nobles and clergy, and representatives of
the free cities, assembled there (January 27, 1521), Luther was the
chief topic of conversation. The forces that through centuries had been
preparing the Reformation came now to a head in one of the most dramatic
scenes in European history. “The great body of the German nobles,” says
a Catholic historian, “applauded and seconded Luther’s attempts.” 69
Aleander himself reported:</p>
<p>All Germany is up in arms against Rome. All the world is clamor-</p>
<p>ing for a council that shall meet on German soil. Papal bulls of</p>
<p>excommunication are laughed at. Numbers of people have ceased</p>
<p>to receive the sacrament of penance. . . . Martin is pictured with
a</p>
<p>halo above his head. The people kiss these pictures. Such a quantity
has been sold that I am unable to obtain one. . - . I cannot go out
in</p>
<p>the streets but the Germans put their hands to their swords and gnash
their teeth at me. I hope the Pope will give me a plenary indulgence and
look after my brothers and sisters if anything happens to me. 70</p>
<p>The excitement was fanned by a whirlwind of antipapal pamphlets; a
wagon, mourned Aleander, would not hold all these scurrilous tracts.
From Sickingen’s castle of Ebernburg, a few miles from Worms, Hutten
issued a frantic attack on the German clergy:</p>
<p>Begone, ye unclean swine! Depart from the sanctuary, ye infa-</p>
<p>mous traffickers! Touch not the altars with your desecrated hands! .
. .</p>
<p>How dare you spend the money intended for pious uses in luxury,</p>
<p>dissipation, and pomp, while honest men are suffering hunger? The cup
is full. See ye not that the breath of liberty is stirring? 71</p>
<p>So strong was the sentiment for Luther that the Emperor’s confessor,
the Franciscan monk Jean Glapion, privately approached Frederick’s
chaplain, Georg Spalatin, in an attempt at conciliation. He professed
considerable sympathy for L uther’s early writings, but the Babylonian
Captivity had made him feel “as if he had been scourged and pummeled
from head to foot.” He pointed out that no system of religious belief
could be securely based upon Scripture, for “the Bible is like soft wax
, which every man can twist</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>and stretch according to his pleasure.” He admitted urgent need for
ec - clesiastical reform; indeed, he had warned his Imperial penitent
that “God will punish him and all princes if they do not free the Church
from such overweening abuses”; and he promised that Charles would
accomplish the major reforms within five years.. Even now, after those
terrible Lutheran blasts, he thought peace possible if Luther would
recant. 72 Luther, apprised of this at Wittenberg, refused.</p>
<p>On March 3 Aleander presented to the Diet a proposal for the
immediate condemnation of Luther. The Diet protested that the monk
should not be condemned without a hearing. Charles thereupon invited
Luther to come to Worms and testify concerning his teaching and his
books. “You need fear no violence or molestation,” he wrote, “for you
have our safe - conduct.” 78 Luther’s friends begged him not to go, and
reminded him of the safe -conduct that the Emperor Sigismund had given
Huss. Adrian of Utrecht, now Car- dinal of Tortosa, soon to be pope,
sent a plea to his former pupil, the Em- peror, to ignore the
safe-conduct, arrest Luther, and send him to Rome. On April 2 Luther
left Wittenberg. At Erfurt a large crowd, including forty professors
from the university, hailed him as a hero. When he approached Worms
Spalatin rushed a warning to him not to enter, but rather to hurry back
to Wittenberg. Luther answered: “Though there were as many devils in
Worms as there are tiles on the roofs, I will go there.” 74 A band of
knights rode out to meet him and escort him into the city (April 16).
The streets filled at news of his arrival; 2,000 people gathered around
his carriage; all the world came to see him, said Aleander, and even
Charles was cast into the shade.</p>
<p>On April 17 Luther, in his monastic garb, appeared before the Diet:
the Emperor, six electors, an awesome court of princes, nobles,
prelates, and burghers, and Jerome Aleander armed with papal authority,
formal docu- ments, and forensic eloquence. On a table near Luther stood
a collection of his books. Johann Eck — not he of the Leipzig debate but
an official of the archbishop of Trier — asked him were these his
compositions, and would he retract all heresies contained in them? For a
moment, standing before the assembled dignity of the Empire and the
delegated power and majesty of the Church, Luther’s courage failed him.
He replied in a low and d iffident voice that the bocks were his, but as
to the second question he begged time to consider. Charles granted him a
day. Back in his lodging he received a mes- sage from Hntten beseeching
him to stand fast; and several members of the Diet came pnvately to
encourage him. Many seemed to feel that his final answer would mark a
turning point in history.</p>
<p>On April 1 8 he faced the Diet with fuller confidence. Now the
chamber was so crowded that even the electors found it difficult to
reach their seats, and most of those present stood. Eck asked him would
he repudiate, in whole</p>
<p>CHAP, XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 36 1</p>
<p>or in part, the works that he had written. He replied that those
portions that dealt with ecclesiastical abuses were by common consent
just. The Emperor interrupted him with an explosive “No! ’’— but Luther
went on, and hit at Charles himself: “Should I recant at this point, I
would open the door to more tyranny and impiety, and it will be all the
worse should it appear that I had done so at the instance of the Holy
Roman Empire.” As to the doctrinal passages in his books, he agreed to
retract any that should be proved contrary to Scripture. To this Eck, in
Latin, made an objection that well expressed the view of the Church:</p>
<p>Martin, your plea to be heard from Scripture is the one always</p>
<p>made by heretics. You do nothing but renew the errors of Wyclif</p>
<p>and Huss. . . . How can you assume that you are the only one to</p>
<p>understand the sense of Scripture? Would you put your judgment</p>
<p>above that of so many famous men and claim that you know more</p>
<p>than all of them? You have no right to call into question the
most</p>
<p>holy orthodox faith, instituted by Christ the perfect Lawgiver,
pro-</p>
<p>claimed throughout the world by the Apostles, sealed by the red</p>
<p>blood of martyrs, confirmed by the sacred councils, and defined
by</p>
<p>the Church . . . and which we are forbidden by the Pope and the</p>
<p>Emperor to discuss, lest there be no end to debate. I ask you, Martin
— answer candidly and without distinctions — do you or do you not</p>
<p>repudiate your books and the errors which they contain? 75</p>
<p>Luther made his historic response in Geman:</p>
<p>Since your Majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I</p>
<p>will answer without distinctions. . . . Unless I am convicted by
the</p>
<p>testimony of Sacred Scripture or by evident reason (I do not
accept</p>
<p>the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each
other), my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I</p>
<p>will not recant anything, for to go against my conscience is
neither</p>
<p>right nor safe. God help me. Amen.* 76</p>
<p>Eck countered that no error could be proved in the doctrinal decrees
of the councils; Luther answered that he was prepared to prove such
errors, but the Emperor intervened peremptorily: “It is enough; since he
has denied councils, we wish to hear no more.” 78 Luther returned to his
lodging weary with the strife, but confident that he had borne good
testimony in what Carlyle was to call “the greatest moment in the modern
history of man.” 79 The Emperor was as shaken as the monk. Bom to the
purple, and already</p>
<p>•We cannot fully authenticate the famous words engraved on the
majestic Luther</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>accustomed to authority, he thought it self-evident that the right of
each individual to interpret Scripture, and to accept or reject civil or
ecclesiastical decrees according to private judgment and conscience,
would soon erode the very foundations of social order, for this seemed
to him based on a moral code that in turn derived its strength from the
supernatural sanctions of reli- gious belief. On April 19 he called the
leading princes to a conference in his own chambers, and presented to
them a declaration of faith and intent, written in French, and
apparently by himself:</p>
<p>I am descended from a long line of Christian emperors of this</p>
<p>noble German nation, of the Catholic kings of Spain, the
archdukes</p>
<p>of Austria, and the dukes of Burgundy. They were all faithful to
the</p>
<p>death to the Church of Rome, and they defended the Catholic faith</p>
<p>and the honor of God. I have resolved to follow in their steps. A
single friar who goes counter to all Christianity for a thousand years
must</p>
<p>be wrong. Therefore I am resolved to stake my lands, my friends, my
body, my blood, my life, and my soul. . . . After having heard yester-
day the obstinate defense of Luther, I regret that I have so long
de-</p>
<p>layed in proceeding against him and his false teaching. I will
have</p>
<p>no more to do with him. He may return under his safe-conduct, but</p>
<p>without preaching or making any tumult. I will proceed against
him</p>
<p>as a notorious heretic, and I ask you to declare yourselves as
you</p>
<p>promised me. 80</p>
<p>Four electors agreed to this procedure; Frederick of Saxony and
Ludwig of the Palatinate abstained. That night — April 1 9 — anonymous
persons posted upon the door of the town hall, and elsewhere in Worms,
placards bear- ing the German symbol of social revoluti on, the
peasant’s shoe. Some ec - clesiastics were frightened, and privately
solicited Luther to make his peace with the Church, but he stood by his
statement to the Diet. On April 26 he began his return journey to
Wittenberg. Leo X sent orders that the safe- conduct should be
respected. 81 Nevertheless the Elector Frederick, fearful that Imperial
police might attempt to arrest Luther after the expiration of the
safe-conduct on May 6, a rranged, with Luther’s reluctant consent, to
have him ambushed en route homeward as if by highwaymen, and taken for
concealment to the castle of Wartburg.</p>
<p>On May 6 the Emperor presented to the Diet — now thinned by many de-
partures — the draft that Ale ander had prepared of the “Edict of
Worms.” It charged that Luther</p>
<p>has sullied marriage, disparaged confession, and denied the body and
blood of Our Lord. He.makes the sacraments depend upon the faith of the
recipient. He is pagan in his denial of free will. This devil in</p>
<p>the habit of a monk has brought together ancient errors into one</p>
<p>stinking puddle, and has invented new ones. He denies the power
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 363</p>
<p>the keys, and encourages the laity to wash their hands in the
blood</p>
<p>of the clergy. His teaching makes for rebellion, division, war,
mur-</p>
<p>der, robbery, arson, and the collapse of Christendom. He lives
the</p>
<p>life of a beast. He has burned the decretals. He despises alike the
ban and the sword. He does more harm to the civil than to the
ecclesi-</p>
<p>astical power. We have labored with him, but he recognizes only</p>
<p>the authority of Scripture, which he interprets in his own sense. We
have given him twenty-one days, dating from April 15…. When</p>
<p>the time is up, no one is to harbor him. His followers also are to
be</p>
<p>condemned. His books are to be eradicated from the memory of</p>
<p>man. 82</p>
<p>Two days after the presentation of this edict Leo X transferred his
political support from Francis I to Charles V. The rump Diet agreed to
the edict, and on May 26 Charles promulgated it formally. Aleander
praised God, and ordered that the books of Luther should be burned
wherever found.</p>

<li>THE RADICALS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wartburg was in itself a somber punishment. The ancient castle,
perched on a mountaintop a mile from Eisenach, was hidden from the world
as well as from the Emperor. For almost ten months (May 4, 1 52 1, to
Febru- ary 29, 1522) Luther dwelt there in a gloomy chamber equipped
with bed, table, stove, and a stump as a stool. A few soldiers guarded
the fortress, a warden tended the grounds, two boys served Luther as
pages. For conven- ience, and perhaps as a local disguise, he shed his
monastic robe, donned knightly garb, and grew a beard; he was now Junker
George. He went out hunting, but he did not relish killing rabbits when
there were so many Anti- christs still unslain. Idleness and insomnia,
and too much food and beer, made him ill and stout. He fretted and
cursed like a Junker. “I had rather</p>
<p>b urn on live coals,” he wrote, “than rot here I want to be in the
fray.” 83</p>
<p>But Frederick’s minister advised him to stay in hiding for a year
while Charles’s fervor cooled. Charles, however, made no effort to find
or arrest him.</p>
<p>In Luther’s intellectual solitude doubts and hallucinations plagued
him. Could it be, he wondered, that he was right and so many pundits
wrong? Was it wise to break down the authority of the established creed?
Did the principle of private judgment portend the rise of revolution and
the death of law? If we may believe the story that he told in his
anecdotage, he was disturbed, in the castle, by strange noises that he
could explain only as the activity of demons. He professed to have seen
Satan on several occasions; once, he vouched, the Devil pelted him with
nuts; 84 once, says a famous leg-</p>

<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>end, Luther flung an ink bottle at him, but missed his aim. 8 ® He
solaced himself by writing vivid letters to his friends and his enemies,
by composing theological treatises, and by translating the New Testament
into German. Once he made a flying trip to Wittenberg to harness a
revolution.</p>
<p>His defiance at Worms, and his survival, had given his followers a
heady elation. At Erfurt students, artisans, and peasants attacked and
demolished forty parish houses, destroyed libraries and rent rolls, and
killed a humanist (June 1 52 1 ). In the fall of that exciting year the
Augustinian friars of Erfurt abandoned their monastery, preached the
Lutheran creed, and denounced the Church as “mother of dogma, pride,
avarice, luxury, faithlessness, and hypocrisy.” 88 At Wittenberg, while
Melanchthon composed his Loci com - munes rerum theologicarum (1521) —
the first systematic exposition of Prot- estant theology — his fellow
professor Carlstadt, now archdeacon of the Castle Church, demanded that
Mass should be said (if at all) in the vernacular, that the Eucharist
should be given in wine and bread without preliminary confession or
fasting, that religious images should be removed from churches, and that
the clergy — monks as well as secular priests — should marry and pro-
create. Carlstadt set a pace by marrying, at forty, a girl of fifteen
(January 19, 1522).</p>
<p>Luther appr oved of this marriage, but “Good Heavens!” he wrote,
“will our Wittenbergers give wives to monks?” 87 Nevertheless he found
some - thing attractive in the idea, for he sent to Spalatin (November
21, 1521) a treatise On Monastic V ows, defending their repudiation.
Spalatin delayed its publication, for it was unconventionally frank. It
accepted the sexual instinct as natural and irrepressible, and declared
that monastic vows were lures of Satan, multiplying sins. Four years
would elapse before Luther him- self would marry; his belated
appreciation of woman apparently played no part in inaugurating the
Reformation.</p>
<p>The revolution proceeded. On September 22, 1521, Melanchthon admin-
istered communion in both kinds; here the Utraquists of Bohemia won a
delayed victory. On October 2 3 the Mass ceased to be said in Luther’s
monas - tery. On November 12 thirteen of the monks walked out of the
cloister and headed for marriage; soon a similar exodus would empty half
the monasteries of Germany. On December 3 some students and townsfolk,
armed with knives, entered the parish church of Wittenberg, drove the
priests from the altars, and stoned some worshipers who were praying
before a statue of the Virgin. On December 4 forty students demolished
the altars of the Francis- can monastery in Wittenberg. On that same day
Luther, still disguised as a Junker, clandestinely visited the city,
approved the marriage of the monks, but warned clergy and laity against
violence. “Constraint,” he said, “is not all ruled out, but it must be
exercised by the constituted authorities.” 88 On the morrow he returned
to the Wartburg.</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 365</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter he sent to Spalatin, for publication, an Earnest
Exhorta- tion for All Christians , Warning Them against Insurrection and
Rebellion . He feared that if the religious revolution went too fast, or
became a social revolution, it would alienate the nobility and destroy
itself. But its opening pages were themselves criticized as an
incitation to violence:</p>
<p>It seems probable that there is danger of an uprising, and that</p>
<p>priests, monks, bishops, and the entire spiritual estate may be</p>
<p>murdered or driven into exile, unless they seriously and
thoroughly</p>
<p>reform themselves. For the common man has been brooding over the
injury he has suffered in property, in body, and in soul, and has
be-</p>
<p>come provoked. They have tried him too far, and have most un-</p>
<p>scrupulously burdened him beyond measure. He is neither able nor</p>
<p>willing to endure it longer, and could indeed have good reason to</p>
<p>lay about him with flails and cudgels, as the peasants are
threatening to do. Now I am not at all displeased to hear that the
clergy are</p>
<p>brought to such a state of fear and anxiety. Perhaps they will
come</p>
<p>to their senses and moderate their mad tyranny. … I will go
further.</p>
<p>If I had ten bodies, and could acquire so much favor with God
that</p>
<p>he would chasten them 〔the clergy〕 by the gentle means 〔 Fuchs
-</p>
<p>s c hnjoan per — the fox’s fluffy tail〕 of bodily death or
insurrection, I</p>
<p>would most gladly give all my ten bodies to death in behalf of
the</p>
<p>poor peasants. 89</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he went on, it is inadvisable for private individuals
to use force; vengeance is God’s.</p>
<p>Insurrection is unreasoning, and generally hurts the innocent
more</p>
<p>than the guilty. Hence no insurrection is ever right, no matter
how</p>
<p>good the cause in whose interest it is made. The harm resulting from
it always exceeds the amount of reformation accomplished. . . . When Sir
Mob 〔Herr Orrmes — Mister Everybody〕 breaks loose he cannot</p>
<p>tell the wicked from the godly; he strikes at random, and then
hor-</p>

<p>Revolution, more or less peaceful, continued. On Christmas Day 1521,
Carlstadt celebrated Mass in German, in civilian dress, and invited all
to re- ceive communion by taking the bread in their hands and drinking
from the chalice. About this time Gabriel Zwilling, a leader of the
Augustinian Con- gregation, invited his hearers to bum religious
pictures and demolish altars wherever found. On December 27 oil was
poured upon the fire by “proph - ets” arriving from Zwickau. That town
was one of the most industrial in Germany, having a large population of
weavers under a municipal govern- ment of merchant employers. A
socialist movement among the workers was encouraged by echoes and
memories of the suppressed Taborite experiment</p>

<p>(chap. XVI</p>
<p>that had agitated near- by Bohemia. Thomas Miinzer, pastor of the
weavers’ church of St. Catherine, became the mouthpiece of their
aspirations, and at the same time an enthusiastic supporter of the
Reformation. Realizing that Luther’s exaltation of the Bible as the sole
rule of faith opened the question who should interpret the text, Miinzer
and two associates — Nicholas Storch the weaver and Marcus Stiibner the
scholar — announced that they were singularly qualified as interpreters,
for they felt themselves directly inspired by the Holy Ghost. This
divine spirit, they declared, bade them defer bap- tism till maturity;
for the sacrament could have effect only through faith, which was not to
be expected of babies. The world, they predicted, was soon to suffer a
general devastation, in which all ungodly men — including especially all
orthodox priests — would perish; thereafter the communistic Kingdom of
God would begin on earth. 91 In 1521 an insurrection of the weavers was
put down, and the three “Zwickau Apostles” were banished. Miinzer went
to Prague, was expelled, and took a pastorate in Allstedt in Saxony.
Storch and Stiibner went to Wittenberg, and in the absence of Luther
they made a favorable impression on Melanchthon and Carlstadt.</p>
<p>On January 6, 1522, the Augustinian Congregation at Wittenberg com-
pletely disbanded. On January 22 Carlst adt’s adherents were strong
enough in the municipal council to carry a decree ordering all images to
be removed from Wittenberg churches, and prohibiting Mass except in
Carlstadt’s sim - plified form. Carlstadt included the crucifix among
forbidden images, and, like the early Christians, banned music from
religious services. “The lascivi - ous notes of the organ,” he said,
“awaken thoughts of the world. When we should be meditating on the
sufferings of Christ we are reminded of Pyramus and Thisbe. . . .
Relegate organs, trumpets, and flutes to the theater.” 92 When the
agents of the council proved dilatory in removing images, Carl- stadt
led his followers into the churches; pictures and crucifixes were torn
from the walls, and resisting priests were pelted with stones. 93
Accepting the view of the Zwickau Prophets — that God speaks directly to
men as well as through the Scriptures, and speaks rather to the simple
in mind and heart than to the learned in languages and books —
Carlstadt, himself erudite, proclaimed that schools and studies were
deterrents to piety, and that real Christians would shun all letters and
learning, and would become illiterate peasants or artisans. One of his
followers, George Mohr, dismissed the school that he taught, and
exhorted the parents to keep their children innocent of letters. Several
students left the university and went home to learn a handicraft, say-
ing that there was no further need for study.</p>
<p>Hearing of all this, Luther feared that his conservative critics
would soon be justified in their frequent predictions that his
repudiation of ecclesiastical authority would loosen all bonds of social
discipline. Defying the Emperor’s ban, and waiving all protection by the
Elector should Charles seek to arrest</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 367</p>
<p>him, Luther left his castle, resumed his monastic robe and tonsure,
and hurried back to Wittenberg. On March 9, 1522, he began a series of
eight sermons that sternly called the university, the churches, and the
citizens to order. He now rejected all appeals to force; had he not
freed millions of men from ecclesiastical oppression without lifting
more than a pen? “Follow me,” he said. “I was the first whom God
entrusted with this matter; I was th e one to whom He first revealed how
His Word should be preached to you. Therefore you have done wrong in
starting such a piece of work without . . . having first consulted me. .
. , 94 Give me time. . . . Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by
destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and
women; shall we then prohibit wine and abolish women? The sun, the moon,
the stars, have been worshiped; shall we then pluck them out of the
sky?” 95 Those who wished to keep pictures, statuary, crucifixes, music,
or the Mass should not be interfered with; he himself approved of
religious images. 96 He arranged that in one Wittenberg church the Mass
should be per- formed according to the traditional rite; in another,
communion was ad- ministered in bread alone at the high altar, but in
bread and wine at a side altar. The form, said Luther, made little
difference; what counted was the spirit in which the Eucharist was
received.</p>
<p>He was at his best and most Christian in those eight sermons in eight
days. He risked all on being able to win Wittenberg back to moderation,
and he succeeded. The Zwickau Prophets sought to convert him to their
views, and offered, as proof of their divine inspiration, to read his
thoughts. He accepted the challenge; they answered that he was feeling a
secret sympathy for their ideas; he attributed their clairvoyance to the
Devil, and ordered them to leave Wittenberg. Carlstadt, dismissed from
his posts by a reconstructed town council, took a pastorate in
Orlamiinde, from whose pulpit he de- nounced Luther as a “gluttonous
ecclesiastic . . . the new Wittenberg pope.” 97 Anticipating the
Quakers, Carlstadt abandoned all clerical garb , donned a plain gray
coat, dispensed with titles, asked to be called “Brother Andreas,”
refused payment for his ministry, earned his living at the plow,
renounced all use of drugs, preferred prayer to medicine, advocated po-
lygamy as Biblical, and adopted a merely symbolical view of the
Eucharist. At the Elector’s request Luther went to Orlamiinde to preach
against him, but was pelted out of the town with stones and mud. 98 When
the Peasants’ Revolt collapsed, Carlstadt, fearing arrest as an
instigator, sought and re- ceived refuge with Luther. After much
wandering, the tired radical found port as a professor in Basel, and
there, in 1541, he achieved a peaceful scholas- tic death.</p>

<li>THE FOUNDATIONS OF FAITH</li>
</ol>
<p>Luther resumed the uneven tenor of his ways as priest to his
congregation and professor in the university. The Elector paid him 200
guilders ( ,000? ) a year, to which each student added a slight
honorarium for attending his lectures. Luther and another monk, now both
in layman’s garb, lived in the Augustinian monastery with a student
servant. “My b6d was not made up for a whole year, and became foul with
sweat. But I worked all day, and was so tired at night that I fell into
bed without knowing that anything was amiss.” 99 Hard work made his
appetite forgivable. “I eat like a Bohemian and drink like a German,
thank God, Amen.” 100 He preached often, but with humane brevity, and in
simple, vigorous language that held his rough auditors in hand. His only
recreations were chess and the flute; but he seems to have enjoyed more
the hours that he spent in attacking “papists’.” He was the most
powerful and uninhibited controversialist in history. Nearly all his
writings were warfare, salted with humor and peppered with vituperation.
He let his opponents elaborate superior Latin to be read by a few
scholars; he too wrote Latin when he wished to address all Christendom;
but most of his diatribes were composed in German, or were at once
translated into German, for his was a nationalist revolution. No other
German author has equaled him in clarity or force of style, in
directness and pungency of phrase, in happy — sometimes hilarious —
similes, in a vocabulary rooted in the speech of the people, and
congenial to the national mind.</p>
<p>Printing fell in with his purposes as a seemingly providential
innovation, which he used with inexhaustible skill; he was the first to
make it an engine of propaganda and war. There were no newspapers yet,
nor magazines; bat- tles were fought with books, pamphlets, and private
letters intended for publication. Under the stimulus of Luther’s revolt
the number of books printed in Germany rose from 1 50 in 1 5 1 8 to 990
in 1 524. Four fifths of these favored the Reformation. Books defending
orthodoxy were hard to sell, while Luther’s were the most widely
purchased of the age. They were sold not only in bookstores but by
peddlers and traveling students; 1,400 copies were bought at one
Frankfurt fair; even in Paris, in 1520, they outsold everything else. As
early as 1519 they were exported to France, Italy, Spain, the
Netherlands, England. “Luther’s books are everywhere and in every
language,” wrote Erasmus in 1521; “no one would believe how widely he
has moved men.” 101 The literary fertility of the Reformers transferred
the preponderance of publications from southern to northern Europe,
where it has remained ever since. Printing was the Reformation;
Gutenberg made Luther possible.,</p>
<p>Luther’s supreme achievement as a writer was his translation of the
Bible</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 369</p>
<p>into German. Eighteen such translations had already been made, but
they were based on Jerome’s Vulgate, were crowded with errors, and
were</p>
<p>Laboring so long on the Bible, and inheriting the medieval view of
its di- vine authorship, Luther fondly made it the all-sufficient source
and norm of his religious faith. Though he accepted some traditions not
based on Scrip- ture — like infant baptism and the Sunday Sabbath — he
rejected the right of the Church to add to Christianity elements resting
not on the Bible but on her own customs and authority, like purgatory,
indulgences, and the wor- ship of Mar y and the saints. Valla’s
revelation of the “Donation of Constan - tine” (the supposed bequest of
Western Europe to the popes) as a hoary hoax of history had shaken the
faith of thousands of Christians in the reli- ability of Church
traditions and the compulsive validity of Church decrees; and in 1 5 3 7
Luther himself translated V alla’s treatise into German. T radition</p>
<p>370 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>was human and fallible, but the Bible was accepted by nearly all
Europe as the infallible word of God.</p>
<p>Reason, too, seemed a weak instrument when compared with faith in a
divine revelation. “We poor, wretched people . . . presumptuously seek
to understand the incomprehensible majesty of the incomprehensible light
of God’s wonders. . . . We look w ith blind eyes, like a mole, on the
glory of God .” 108 You cannot, said Luther, accept both the Bible and
reason; one or the other must go.</p>
<p>All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed
to</p>
<p>us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd,
and false. What (thinks that cunning little fool) can be more absurd</p>
<p>and impossible than that Christ should give us in the Last Supper His
body and blood to eat and drink? … or that the dead should rise</p>
<p>again at the last day? — or that Christ the Son of God should be con-
ceived, borne in the womb of the Virgin Mary, become man, suffer,</p>
<p>and die a shameful death on the cross? 104 .. . Reason is the
greatest enemy that faith has . 1 08 . . . She is the Devil’s greatest
whore … a</p>
<p>whore eaten by scab and leprosy, who ought to be trodden underfoot
and destroyed, she and her wisdom. . . . Throw dung in her face . .
.</p>
<p>drown her in baptism . 108</p>
<p>Luther condemned the Scholastic philosophers for making so many
conces- sions to reason, for trying to prove Christian dogmas
rationally, for trying to harmonize Christianity with the philosophy of
that “cursed, conceited, wily heathen” Aristotle . 107</p>
<p>Nevertheless Luther took two steps in the direction of reason: he
made the sermon, not ceremony, the center of religious ritual; and in
the early days of his rebellion he proclaimed the right of every
individual to interpret the Scriptures for himself. He drew up his own
canon of authenticity for the books of the Bible: how far did they agree
with the teaching of Christ? “Whatever does not preach Christ is not
Apostolic, even though it be writ - ten by St. Peter or St. Paul. . . .
Whatever does preach Christ would be Apostolic even if it proceeded from
Judas, Pilate, or Herod .” 108 He rejected</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 371</p>
<p>them subsequently. . . . Solomon’s Proverbs were not the work of Solo
- mon.” But Catholic opponents contended that his te sts of authenticity
and inspiration were subjective and arbitrary, and they predicted that
after his example other critics would reject, according to their own
tastes and views, other Scriptural books, until nothing would be left of
the Bible as a basis for religious faith.</p>
<p>With the exceptions indicated, Luther defended the Bible as
absolutely and literally true. He admitted that if the story of Jonah
and the whale were not in Scripture he would laugh at it as a fable; so
too with the tales of Eden and the serpent, of Joshua and the sun; but,
he argued, once we accept the divine authorship of the Bible we must
take these stories along with the rest as in every sense factual. He
rejected as a form of atheism the attempts of Erasmus and others to
harmonize Scripture and reason by allegorical inter- pretations . 111
Having himself won mental peace not through philosophy but through faith
in Christ as presented in the Gospels, he clung to the Bible as the last
refuge of the soul. As against the humanists and their worship of the
pagan classics, he offered the Bible as no mere product of man’s
intellect but as a divine gift and consolation. “It teaches us to see,
feel, grasp, and compre - hend faith, hope, and charity far otherwise
than mere human reason can; and when evil oppresses us it teaches how
these virtues throw light upon the darkness, and how, after this poor,
miserable existence of ours on earth, there is another and eternal life
.” 112 Asked on what basis he res ted the divine inspiration of the
Bible, he answered, simply, on its own teaching: none but God-inspired
men could have formed so profound and solacing a faith.</p>
<ol start="8" type="i">
<li>luther’s theology</li>
</ol>
<p>Though his theology was founded with trusting literalness on the
Scrip- tures, his interpretation unconsciously retained late medieval
traditions. His nationalism made him a modern, his theology belonged to
the Age of Faith, His rebellion was far more against Catholic
organization and ritual than against Catholic doctrine; most of this
remained with him to the end. Even in his rebellion he followed Wyclif
and Huss rather than any new scheme: like theirs his revolt lay in
rejecting the papacy, the councils, the hierarchy, and any other guide
to faith than the Bible; like them he called the pope Antichrist; and
like them he found protection in the state. The line from Wyclif to Huss
to Luther is the main thread of religious development from the
fourteenth to the sixteenth century. Theologically the line was anchored
on Augustine’s notions of predestination and grace, which in turn
were</p>
<p>37 2 the reformation (chap.xvi</p>
<p>Judaic contribution triumphed over the Greek; the Prophets won
against the Aristotle of the Scholastics and the Plato of the humanists;
Paul — in the line of the Prophets rather than that of the Apostles —
transformed Jesus into an atonement for Adam; the Old Testament
overshadowed the New; Yah- weh darkened the face of Christ.</p>
<p>Luther’s conception of God was Judaic. He could speak with eloquence
of the divine mercy and grace, but more basic in him was the old picture
of God as the avenger, and therefore of Christ as the final judge. He
believed, without recorded protest, that God had drowned nearly all
mankind in a flood, had set fire to Sodom, and had destroyed lands,
peoples, and empires with a breath of His wrath and a wave of His hand.
Luther reckoned that “few are saved, infinitely many are damned .” 118
The mitigating myth of Mary as intercessor dropped out of the story, and
left the Last Judgment in all its stark terror for naturally sinful men.
Meanwhile God had appointed wild beasts, vermin, and wicked women to
punish men for their sins. Occa- sionally Luther reminded himself that
we know nothing about God except that a cosmic intelligence exists. When
one troublesome young theologian asked him where God had been before the
world was created, he answered, in his blunt Johnsonian way: “He was
building hell for such presumptuous, fluttering, and inquisitive spirits
as you .” 114</p>
<p>He took heaven and hell for granted, and believed in an early end of
the world. 11 ® He described a heaven of many delights, including pet
dogs “with golden hair shining like precious stones”— a genial
concession to his children, who had expressed concern over the damnation
of their pets . 116 He spoke as confidently as Aquinas about angels as
bodiless and beneficent spirits. Some- times he represented man as an
endless bone of contention between good and bad angels, to whose
differing dispositions and efforts were to be ascribed all the
circumstances of man’s fate— a Zoroastrian intrusion into his theology.
He accepted fully the medieval conception of devils wandering about the
earth, bringing temptation, sin, and misfortune to men, and easing man’s
way</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 373</p>
<p>— hail, thunder, war, plague — and to divine action all beneficent
events ; 122 he could hardly conceive of what we call natural law. All
the Teutonic folklore about the poltergeist, or noise-making spirit, was
apparently credited by Luther at its face value. Snakes and monkeys were
favorite incarnations of the Devil . 123 The old notion that devils
could lie with women and beget chil- dren seemed plausible to him; in
one such case he recommended that the resultant child should be drowned
. 124 He accepted magic and witchcraft as realities, and thought it a
simple Christian duty to burn witches at the stake . 126 Most of these
ideas were shared by his contemporaries, Catholic or Protes- tant. The
belief in the power and ubiquity of devils attained in the sixteenth
century an intensity not recorded in any other age; and this
preoccupation with Satan bedeviled much of Protestant theology.</p>
<p>Luther’s philosophy was further darkened by the conviction that man
is by nature wicked and prone to sin.* As punishment for the
disobedience of Adam and Eve the divine image was torn from the human
heart, leaving only natural inclinations. “No one is by nature Christian
or pious . . . the world and the masses are and always will be
unchristian. . . . The wicked always outnumber the good .” 126 Even in
the good man evil actions out - number t he good, for he cannot escape
from his nature; as Paul said, “There is none righteous, no, not one.”
“We are the children of wrath,” Luther felt, “and all our works,
intentions, and thoughts are nothing at all in the balance against our
sins .” 127 So f ar as good works go, every one of us would merit
damnation. By “good works” Luther meant especially those forms of ritual
piety recommended by the Church — fasting, pilgrimages, prayers to the
saints, Masses for the dead, indulgences, processions, gifts to the
Church; but he also included all “works, whatever their character .” 128
He did not ques - tion the need of charity and love for a healthy social
life, but he felt that even a life blessed with such virtues could not
earn an eternity of bliss. “The Gospel preaches nothing of the merit of
works; t he that says the Gospel re- quires works for salvation, I say
flat and plain he is a liar .” 129 No amount of good works could atone
for the sins — each an insult to an infinite deity — com- mitted by the
best of men. Only the redeeming sacrifice of Christ — the suffer- ing
and death of the Son of God — could atone for man’s sins; and only
belief in that divine atonement can save us from hell. As Paul said to
the Romans, “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
shalt beueve in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved.” 130 It is this faith that “justifies”— makes a man just
despite his sins, and eligible for salvation. Christ Himself said: “He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not
shall be damned .” 131 “Wherefore,” rea -</p>

<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>374</p>
<p>(CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>soned Luther, “it ought to be the first concern of every Christian to
lay aside all trust in works, and more and more strengthen faith alone
.” 182 And he proceeded, in a passage that disturbed some theologians
but comforted many sinners:</p>
<p>Jesus Christ stoops and lets the sinner jump on His back, and so</p>
<p>saves him from death. . . . What a consolation for pious souls to put
Him on like this and wrap Him in my sins, your sins, the sins of the</p>
<p>whole universe, and consider Him thus bearing all our sins! . . .</p>
<p>When you see that your sins cleave to Him, then you will be safe</p>
<p>from sin, death, and hell. Christianity is nothing but a continual
exer- cise in feeling that you have no sin although you sin, but that
your</p>
<p>sins are thrown on Christ. It is enough to know the Lamb that
bears</p>
<p>the sins of the world; sin cannot detach us from Him, were we to</p>
<p>commit a thousand fornications a day, or as many murders. Is not</p>
<p>that good news if, when some one is full of sins, the Gospel
comes</p>
<p>and tells him: Have confidence and believe, and henceforth your sins
are remitted? Once this stop is pulled out, the sins are forgiven; there
is nothing more to work for . 188</p>
<p>This may have been intended to comfort and revive some sensitive
souls who were taking their sins too much to heart; Luther could recall
how he too had once magnified the majestic unforgivAbility of his sins.
But to some it sounded very much like Tetzel’s alleged “drop the coin in
the box and all your sins fly away”; faith was now to do all the wonders
formerly claimed for con - fession, absolution, contribution, and
indulgence. Still more arresting was a passage in which the hearty and
ebullient Luther found a good word to say for sin itself. When the Devil
tempts us with annoying persistency, he said, it may be wise to yield
him a sin or two.</p>
<p>Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk</p>
<p>bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out</p>
<p>of hate and contempt for the Devil, so as not to give him the chance
to make one scrupulous over mere nothings; if one is too frightened of
sinning, one is lost. . . . Oh, if I could find some really good sin
that would give the Devil a toss ! 184</p>
<p>Such lusty and humorous obiter dicta invited misconstruction. Some of
Luther’s followers interpreted him as c ondoning fornication, adultery,
mur- der. A Lutheran professor had to caution Lutheran preachers to say
as little as possible about justification by faith alone . 185 However,
by faith Luther meant no merely intellectual assent to a proposition,
but vital, personal self- committal to a practical belief; and he was
confident that complete belief in God’s grace given because of Christ’s
redeeming death would make a man so basically good that an occasional
frolic with the flesh would do no lasting</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 375</p>
<p>harm; faith would soon bring the sinner back to spiritual health. He
heartily- approved of good works; 186 what he denied was their efficacy
tor salvation. “Good works,” he said, “do not make a good man, but a g
ood man does good works.” 187 And what makes a man good? Faith in God
and Christ.</p>
<p>How does a man come to such saving faith? Not through his merits, but
as a divine gift granted, regardless of merits, to those whom God has
chosen to save. As St. Paul put it, remembering the case of Pharaoh,
“God has mercy on whom He will have mercy; and whom He wills He
hardens.” 188 By divine predestination the elect are chosen for eternal
happiness, the rest are left graceless and damned to everlasting hell.
189</p>
<p>This is the acme of faith, to believe that God, Who saves so few</p>
<p>and condemns so many, is merciful; that He is just Who has made
us</p>
<p>necessarily doomed to damnation, so that He seems to delight in</p>
<p>the tortures of the wretched, and to be more deserving of hatred than
of love. If by any effort of reason I could conceive how God, Who</p>
<p>shows so much anger and iniquity, could be merciful and just, there
would be no need of faith. 140</p>
<p>So Luther, in his medieval reaction against a paganizing Renaissance
Church, went back not only to Augustine but to Tertullian: Credo quia
incredibile; it seemed to him a merit to believe in predestination
because it was, to reason, unbelievable. Yet it was, he thought, by hard
logic that he was driven to this incredibility. The theologian who had
written so eloquently about the “freedom of a Christian man” now (1525),
in a treatise De servo ar bitrio, argued that if God is omnipotent He
must be the sole cause of all actions, in- cluding man’s; tha t if God
is omniscient He foresees everything, and every- thing must happen as He
has foreseen it; that therefore all events, through all time, have been
predetermined in His mind, and are forever fated to be. Luther
concluded, like Spinoza, that man is as “unfree as a block of wood, a
rock, a lump of clay, or a pillar of salt.” 141 More strangely still,
the same divine foresight deprives the angels, nay, God Himself, of
freedom; He too must act as He has foreseen; His foresight is His fate.
A lunatic fringe inter- preted this doctrine ad libitum: a youth
beheaded his brother and attributed the act to God, of Whom he was
merely the helpless agent; and another logician stamped his wife to
death with his heel s, crying, “Now is the Father’s will accomplished.”
142</p>
<p>Most of these conclusions lay annoyingly implicit in medieval
theology, and were deduced by Luther from Paul and Augustine with
irrefutable consistency. He seemed willing to accept medieval theology
if he might dis- own the Renaissance Church; he could tolerate the
predestination of the multitudinous damned more easily than the
authority of scandalous tax gathering popes. He rejected the
ecclesiastical definition of the Church as</p>
<p>3 j6 THE REFORMATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>the prelacy; he defined it as the community of believers in the
divinity and redeeming passion of Christ; but he echoed papal doctrine
when he wrote: “All people who seek and labor to come to God through any
other means than only through Christ (as Jews, Turks, Papists, false
saints, heretics, etc.) walk in horrible darkness and error, and so at
last must die and be lost in their sins.” 148 Here, reborn in
Wittenberg, was the teaching of Boniface VIII and the Council of Rome
(1302) that extra ecclesiam nulla salus — “no salvation outside the
Church.”</p>
<p>The most revolutionary item in Luther’s theology was his dethronement
of the priest. He allowed for priests not as indispensable dispensers of
the sacraments, nor as privileged mediators with God, but only as
servants chosen by each congregation to minister to its spiritual wants.
By marrying and raising a family these ministers would shed the aura of
sanctity that had made the priesthood awesomel y powerful; they would be
“first among equals,” but any man might at need perform their functions,
even to ab - solving a penitent from sin. Monks should abandon their
selfish and often idle isolation, should marry and labor with the rest;
the man at the plow, the woman in the kitchen, serve God better than the
monk mumbling in stupefy- ing repetition unintelligible prayers. And
prayers should be the direct com- munion of the soul with God, not
appeals to half-legendary saints. The adoration of the sa ints, in
Luther’s judgment, was not a friendly and con - soling intercourse of
the lonely living with the holy dead; it was a relapse into primitive
polytheistic idolatry. 144</p>
<p>As for the sacraments, viewed as priestly ceremonies conferring
divine grace, Luther severely reduced their role. They involve no
miraculous powers, and their efficacy depends, not on their forms and
formulas, but on the faith of the recipient. Confirmation, matrimony,
episcopal ordination of priests, and extreme unction of the dying are
rites to which no special prom- ise of divine grace is attached in
Scripture; the new religion could dispense with them. Baptism has the
warrant of St. John the Baptist’s example. Auric - ular confession may
be retained as a sacrament, despite some doubt as to its Scriptural
basis.* The supreme sacrament is the Lord’s Supper, or Eucharist. The
notion that a priest, by the incantation of his words, can change bread
into Christ seemed to Luther absurd and blasphemous; nevertheless, he
argued, Christ of His own will comes down from heaven to be present con-
substantially with the bread and wine of the sacrament. The Eucharist is
no priestly magic, but a divine and perpetual miracle. 145</p>
<p>Luther’s doctrine of the sacraments, his replac ement of the Mass by
the Lord’s Supper, and his theory of salvation by faith rather than by
good</p>

<p>works, undermined the authority of the clergy in northern Germany .
Fur- thering this process, Luther rejected episcopal courts and canon
law. In Lutheran Europe civil courts became the only courts, secular
power the only legal power. Secular rulers appointed Church personnel,
appropriated Church property, took over Church schools and monastic
charities. Theo- retically Church and state remained independent;
actually the Church be- came subject to the state. The Lutheran
movement, which thought to submit all life to theology, unwittingly,
unwillingly, advanced that pervasive secularization which is a basic
theme of modem life.</p>

<li>THE REVOLUTIONIST</li>
</ol>
<p>When some bishops sought to silence Luther and his followers, he
emitted an angry roar that was almost a tocsin of revolution. In a
pamphlet “Against the Falsely Called Spiritual Order of the Pope and the
Bishops” (July 1522), he branded the prelates as the “biggest wolves” of
all, and called upon all good Germans to drive them out by force.</p>
<p>It were better that every bishop were murdered, every foundation</p>
<p>or cloister rooted out, than that one soul should be destroyed, let
alone that all souls should be lost for the sake of their worthless
trumpery and idolatry. Of what use are they who thus live in lust,
nourished</p>
<p>by the sweat and labor of others? … If they accepted God’s Word,</p>
<p>and sought the life of the soul, God would be with them. . . . But
if</p>
<p>they will not hear God’s Word, but rage and rave with bannings and
burnings, killings and every evil, what do they better deserve than a
strong uprising which will sweep them from the earth? And we</p>
<p>would smile did it happen. All who contribute body, goods, and</p>
<p>honor that the rule of the bishops may be destroyed are God’s dear
children and true Chirstians . 146</p>
<p>He was at this time almost as critical of the state as of the Church.
Stung by the prohibition of the sale or possession of his New Testament
in regions under orthodox rulers, he wrote, in the fall of 1522, a
treatise On Secular Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed. He
began amiably enough by approving St. Paul’s doctrine of civil obedience
and the divine origin of the state. This apparently contradicted his own
teaching as to the perfect freedom of the Christian man. Luther
explained that though true Christians do not need law, and will not use
law or force on one another, they must obey the law as good examples to
the majority, who are not true Christians, for without law the sinful
nature of man would tear a society to pieces. Nevertheless the authority
of the state should end where the realm of the</p>
<p>378 the reformation (chap.xvi</p>
<p>spirit begins. Who are these princes that assume to dictate what
people shall read or believe?</p>
<p>You must know that from the beginning of the world a wise prince</p>
<p>is a rare bird indeed; still more so a pious prince. They are
usually</p>
<p>the greatest fools or the worst knaves on earth. They are God’s
jailers and hangmen, and His divine wrath needs them to punish the
wicked and preserve outward peace. … I would, however, in all fidelity
ad-</p>
<p>vise those blinded folk to take heed to the short saying in Psalm</p>
<p>CVII: “He poureth contempt upon princes.” I swear to you by God</p>
<p>that if through your fault this little text becomes effective against
you, you are lost, though every one of you be as mighty as the Turk;
and</p>
<p>your snorting and raving will help you nothing. A large part has
al-</p>
<p>ready come true. For . . . the common man is learning to think,
and</p>
<p>. . . contempt of princes is gathering forces among the multitude and
the common people. . . . Men ought not, men cannot, men will not</p>
<p>suffer your tyranny and presumption much longer. Dear princes and
lords, be wise and guide yourselves accordingly. God will no longer</p>
<p>tolerate you. The world is no longer what it was when you hunted</p>
<p>and drove people like so much game. 147</p>
<p>A Bavarian chancellor charged that this was a treasonable call to
revolu- tion. Duke George denounced it as scandalous, and urged Elector
Frederick to suppress the publication. Frederick let it pass with his
usual equanim- ity. What would the princes have said had they read
Luther’s letter to Wenzel Link (March 19, 1522)? — “W e are triumphing
over the papal tyranny, which formerly crushed kings and princes; how
much more easily, then, shall we not overcome and trample down the
princes themselves!” 148 Or if they had seen his definition of the
Church? — “I believe that there i s on earth, wise as the world, but one
holy, common Christian Church, which is no other than the community of
the saints. … I believe that in this com- munity or Christendom all
things are in common, and each man’s goods are the other’s, and nothing
is simply a man’s own.” 149</p>
<p>These were casual ebullitions, and should not have been taken too
literally. Actually Luther was a conservative, even a reactionary, in
politics and re- ligion, in the sense that he wished to return to early
medieval beliefs and ways. He considered himself a restorer, not an
innovator. He would have been content to preserve and perpetuate the
agricultural society that he had known in his childhood, with some
humane improvements. He agreed with the medieval Church in condemning
interest, merely adding, in his jovial way, that interest was an
invention of Satan. He regretted the growth of foreign trade, called
commerce a “nasty business,” ir ’° and despised those who lived by
buying cheap and selling dear. He denounced as “manifest robbers” the
monopolists who were conspiring to raise prices; “the authori -</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) THE REFORMATION IN GERMANY 379</p>
<p>ties would do right if they took from such people everything they
have, and drove them out of the country.” 151 He thought it was high
time to “put a bit in the mouth of the Fuggers.” 152 And he concluded
ominously, in a blast On Trade and Usury (1524):</p>
<p>Kings and princes ought to look into these things and forbid them</p>
<p>by strict laws, but I hear that they have an interest in them, and
the saying of Isaiah is fulfilled, “Thy princes have become companions
of thieves.” They hang thieves who have stolen a gulden or half a gul
-</p>
<p>den, but trade with those who rob the whole world. . . . Big
thieves</p>
<p>hang the little ones; and as the Roman senator Cato said, “Simple</p>
<p>thieves lie in prisons and in stocks; public thieves walk abroad in
gold and silk.” But what will God say to this at last? He will do as he
says</p>
<p>by Ezekiel: princes and merchants, one thief with another, He
will</p>
<p>melt them together like lead and brass, as when a city burns, so that
there shall be neither princes nor merchants any more. That time,</p>
<p>I fear, is already at the door. 158</p>
<p>It was.</p>
