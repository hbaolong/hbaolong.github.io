<p>From Alexander to Aurangzeb</p>
<p>I. CHANDRAGUPTA</p>

<p>ipal government</p>
<p>I N THE year 327 b.c. Alexander the Great, pushing on from
Persia,</p>
<p>marched over the Hindu Kush and descended upon India. For a year he
campaigned among the northwestern states that had formed one of the
Persian Empire’s richest provinces, exacting supplies for his troops and
gold for his treas ury. Early in 326 b.c. he crossed the’ Indus, fought
his way slowly through Taxila and Rawalpindi to the south and east, en-
countered the army of King Porus, defeated 30,000 infantry, 4,000 cav-
alry, 300 chariots and 200 elephants, and slew 12,000 men. When Porus,
having fought to the last, surrendered, Alexander, admiring his courage,
stature and fine features, bade him say what treatment he wished to re-
ceive. “Treat me, Alexander,” he answered, “in a kingly way.” “For my
own sake,” said Alexander, “thou shalt be so treated; for thine own sake
do thou demand what is pleasing to thee.” But Porus said that every -
thing was included in what he had asked. Alexander was much pleased with
this reply; he made Porus king of all conquered India as a Mace- donion
tributary, and found him thereafter a faithful and energetic ally. 1
Alexander wished then to advance even to the eastern sea, but his
soldiers protested. After much oratory and pouting he yielded to them,
and led them — through patriotically hostile tribes that made his
wearied troops fight almost every foot of the way — down the Hydaspes
and up the coast through Gedrosia to Baluchistan. When he arrived at
Susa, twenty</p>
<p>months after turning back from his conquests, his army was but a
miser- able fragment of that which had crossed into India with him three
years before.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 44I</p>
<p>Seven years later all trace of Macedonian authority had already
disap- peared from India . 2 The chief agent of its removal was one of
the most romantic figures in Indian history, a lesser warrior but a
greater ruler than Alexander. Chandragupta was a young Kshatriya noble
exiled from Magadha by the ruling Nanda family, to which he was related.
Helped by his subtle Machiavellian adviser, Kautilya Chanakya, the youth
organ- ized a small army, overcame the Macedonian garrisons, and
declared India free. Then he advanced upon Pataliputra,* capital of the
Magadha kingdom, fomented a revolution, seized the throne, and
established that Mauryan Dynasty which was to rule Hindustan and
Afghanistan for one hundred and thirty- seven years. Subordinating his
courage to Kautilya’s unscrupulous wisdom, Chandragupta soon made his
government the most powerful then existing in the world. When
Megasthenes came to Patali- putra as ambassador from Seleucus Nicator,
King of Syria, he was amazed to find a civilization which he described
to the incredulous Greeks — still near their zenith — as entirely equal
to their own . 8</p>
<p>The Greek gave a pleasant, perhaps a lenient, account, of Hindu life
in his time. It struck him as a favorable contrast with his own nation
that there was no slavery in India;! and that though the population was
divided into castes according to occupations, it accepted these
divisions as natural and tolerable. “They live happily enough,” the
ambassador reported,</p>
<p>being simple in their manners, and frugal. They never drink wine</p>
<p>except at sacrifice. . . . The simplicity of their laws and their
con-</p>
<p>tracts is proved by the fact that they seldom go to law. They
have</p>
<p>no suits about pledges and deposits, nor do they require either seals
or witnesses, but make their deposits and confide in each other. . . .
Truth and virtue they hold alike in esteem. . . . The greater part
of</p>
<p>the soil is under irrigation, and consequently bears two crops in</p>
<p>the course of the year. … It is accordingly affirmed that famine
has</p>
<p>never visited India, and that there has never been a general scarcity
in the supply of nourishing food . 8</p>
<p>The oldest of the two thousand cities 6 of northern India in
Chandrag- upta’s time was Taxila, twenty miles northwest of the modem
Rawal - pindi. Arrian describes it as “a large and prosperous city”;
Strabo says</p>
<h1 id="the-modem-patna.">The modem Patna.</h1>
<p>t“This is a great thing in India,” says Arrian, “that all the
inhabitants are free, not a single Indian being a slave .” 4</p>
<p>44 2 the story of civilization (chap.xvi</p>
<p>it “is large, and has most excellent laws .” 7 It was both a military
and a university town, strategically situated on the main road to
Western</p>
<p>Asia, and containing the most famous of the several universities
possessed by India at that time. Students flocked to Taxila as in the
Middle Ages they flocked to Paris; there all the arts and sciences could
be studied under eminent professors, and the medical school especially
was held in high repute throughout the Oriental world.*</p>
<p>Megasthenes describes Chandragupta’s capital, Pataliputra, as nine
miles in length and almost two miles in width. 1 ® The palace of the
King was of timber, but the Greek ambassador ranked it as excelling the
royal resi- dences of Susa and Ecbatana, being surpassed only by those
at Persepolis. Its pillars were plated with gold, and ornamented with
designs of bird- life and foliage; its interior was sumptuously
furnished and adorned with precious metals and stones.” There was a
certain Oriental ostentation in this culture, as in the use of gold
vessels six feet in diameter” but an</p>
<p>English historian concludes, from the testimony of the literary,
pictorial and material remains, that “in the fourth and third centuries
before Christ the command of the Maurya monarch over luxuries of all
kinds and</p>
<p>skilled craftsmanship in all the manual arts was not inferior to that
en- joy ed by the Mogul emperors eighteen centuries later .” 13</p>
<p>In this palace Chandragupta, having won the throne by violence, lived
for twenty-four years as in a gilded jail. Occasionally he appeared in
public, clad in fine muslin embroidered with purple and gold, and
carried in a golden palanquin or on a gorgeously accoutred elephant.
Except when he rode out to the hunt, or otherwise amused himself, he
found his time crowded with the business of his growing realm. His days
were divided into sixteen periods of ninety minutes each. In the first
he arose, and prepared himself by meditation; in the second he studied
the reports of his agents, and issued secret instructions; the third he
spent with his councillors in the Hall of Private Audience; in the
fourth he attended to state finances and national defense; in the fifth
he heard the petitions and suits of his subjects; in the sixth he bathed
and dined, and read religious literature; in the seventh he received
taxes and tribute, and made official</p>
<p>•The excavations of Sir John -Marshall on the site of Taxila have
unearthed delicately carved stones, highly polished statuary, coins as
old as 600 b.c., and glassware of a fine quality never bettered in later
India. 8 “It is manifest,” says Vincent Smith, “ that a high degree of
material civilization had been attained, and that all the arts and
crafts incident to the life of a wealthy, cultured city were familiar.”
9</p>
<p>CHAP. XVI ) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 443</p>
<p>appointments; in the eighth he again met his Council, and heard the
re- ports of his spies, including the courtesans whom he used for this
purpose; 14 the ninth he devoted to relaxation and prayer, the tenth and
eleventh to military matters, the twelfth again to secret reports, the
thirteenth to the evening bath and repast, the fourteenth, fifteenth and
sixteenth to sleep. 15 Perhaps the historian tells us what Chandragupta
might have been, or how Kautilya wished the people to picture him,
rather than what he really was. Truth does not often escape from
palaces.</p>
<p>The actual direction of government was in the hands of the crafty</p>
<p>vizier. Kautilya was a Brahman who knew the political value of
religion, but took no moral guidance from it; like our modern dictators
he be- lieved that every means was justifiable if used in the service of
the state. He was unscrupulous and treacherous, but never to his King;
he served Chandragupta through exile, defeat, adventure, intrigue,
murder and vic- tory, and by his wily wisdom made the empire of his
master the greatest that India had ever known. Like the author of The
Prince, Kautilya</p>
<p>saw fit to preserve in writing his formulas for warfare and
diplomacy; tra- dition ascribes to him the Arthashastra, the oldest book
in extant Sanskrit literature. 16 As an example of its delicate realism
we may take its list of means for capturing a fort: “Intrigue, spies,
winning over the enemy’s people, siege, and assault” 17 — a wise economy
of physical effort.</p>
<p>The government made no pretense to democracy, and was probably the
most efficient that India has ever had.“ Akbar, greatest of the Moguls,
“had nothing like it, and it may be doubted if any of the ancient Greek
cities were better organized.” 10 It was based frankly upon military
power. Chandragupta, if we may trust Megasthenes (who should be as
suspect as any foreign correspondent) kept an army of 600,000 foot,
30,000 horse, 9,000 elephants, and an unnamed number of chariots. 20 The
peasantry and the Brahmans were exempt from military service; and Strabo
describes the farmers tilling the soil in peace and security in the
midst of war. 21 The power of the King was theoretically unlimited, but
in practice it was re- stricted by a Council which — sometimes with the
King, sometimes in his absence — initiated legislation, regulated
national finances and foreign affairs, and appointed all the more
important officers of state. Megasthenes testifies to the “high
character and wisdom” of Chandragupta’s councillors, and to their
effective power. 22</p>
<p>The government was organized into departments with well-defined
duties and a carefully graded hierarchy of officials, managing
respectively revenue,</p>
<p>444 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>customs, frontiers, passports, communications, excise, mines,
agriculture, cat- tle, commerce, warehouses, navigation, forests, public
games, prostitution, and the mint. The Superintendent of Excise
controlled the sale of drugs and intoxicating drinks, restricted the
number and location of taverns, and the quantity of liquors which they
might sell. The Superintendent of Mines leased mining areas to private
persons, who paid a fixed rent and a share of the profits to the
government; a similar system applied to agriculture, for all the land
was owned by the state. The Superintendent of Public Games supervised
the gambling halls, supplied dice, charged a fee for their use, and
gathered in for the treasury five per cent of all money taken in by the
“bank.” The Superintendent of Prostitution looked after public wom en,
con- trolled their charges and expenditures, appropriated their earnings
for two days of each month, and kept two of them in the royal palace for
entertain- ment and intelligence service. Taxes fell upon every
profession, occupation and industry; and in addition rich men were from
time to time persuaded to make “benevolences” to the King. The
government regulated prices and periodically assayed weighcs and
measures; it carried on some manufactures in state factories, sold
vegetables, and kept a monopoly of mines, salt, timber, fine fabrics,
horses and elephants . 83</p>
<p>Law was administered in the village by local headmen, or by
panchayats — village councils of five men; in towns, districts and
provinces by inferior and superior courts; at the capital by the royal
council as a supreme court, and by the King as a court of last appeal.
Penalties were severe, and in- cluded mutilation, torture and death,
usually on the principle of lex talionis, or equivalent retaliation. But
the government was no mere engine of repres- sion; it attended to
sanitation and public health, maintained hospitals and poor-relief
stations, distributed in famine years the food kept in state ware-
houses for such emergencies, forced the rich to contribute to the
assistance of the destitute, and organized great public works to care
for the unem- ployed in depression years . 34</p>
<p>The Department of Navigation regulated water transport, and protected
travelers on rivers and seas; it maintained bridges and harbors, and
provided government ferries in addition to those that were privately
managed and owned 20 — an admirable arrangement whereby public
competition could check private plunder, and private competition could
discourage official extrava- gance. The Department of Communications
built and repaired roads through- out the empire, from the narrow
wagon-tracks of the villages to trade routes thirty-two feet, and royal
roads sixty-four feet, wide. One of these imperial highways extended
twelve hundred miles from Pataliputra to the northwestern frontier 38 —
a distance equal to half the transcontinental spread of the United
States. At approximately every mile, says Megasthenes, these</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 445</p>
<p>roads were marked with pillars indicating directions and distances to
various destinations.” Shade -trees, wells, police-stations and hotels
were provided at regular intervals along the route. 28 Transport was by
chariots, palanquins, bullock-carts, horses, camels, elephants, asses
and men. Elephants were a luxury usually confined to royalty and
officialdom, and so highly valued that a woman’s virtue was thought a
moderate price to pay for one of them.*</p>
<p>The one defect of this government was autocracy, and therefore con-
tinual dependence upon force and spies. Like every autocrat, Chand-
ragupta held his power precariously, always fearing revolt and
assassina- tion. Every night he used a different bedroom, and always he
was sur- rounded by guards. Hindu tradition, accepted by European
historians, tells how, when a long famine (pace Megasthenes) came upon
his king- dom, Chandragupta, in despair at his helplessness, abdicated
his throne, lived for twelve years thereafter as a Jain ascetic, and
then starved him- s elf to death. “All things considered,” said
Voltaire, “the life of a gon - dolier is preferable to that of a doge;
but I believe the difference is so trifling that it is not worth the
trouble of examining .” 28</p>
<ul>
<li>“Their women, who are very chaste, and would not go astray for any
other reason, on the receipt of an elephant have communion with the
donor. The Indians do not think it disgraceful to prostitute themselves
for an elephant, and to the women it even seems ar honor that their
beauty should app ear equal in value to an elephant.”— Arrian, Indie a ,

<li>THE PHILOSOPHER-ICING</li>
</ol>
<p>Ashoka — The Edict of Tolerance — Ashoka’s missionaries— His</p>
<p>failure — His success</p>
<p>Chandragupta’s successor, Bindusara, was apparently a man of some
intellectual inclination. He is said to have asked Antiochos, King
of</p>
<p>Syria, to make him a present of a Greek philosopher; for a real Greek
philosopher, wrote Bindusara, He would pay a high price. 30 The proposal
could not be complied with, since Antiochos found no philosophers for
sale; but chance atoned by giving Bindusara a philosopher for his
son.</p>
<p>Ashoka Vardhana mounted the throne in 273 b.c. He found himself</p>
<p>ruler of a vaster empire than any Indian monarch before him:
Afghanis- tan, Baluchistan, and all of modern India but the extreme
south — Tamila- kam, or Tamil Land. For a time he governed in the spirit
of his grand- father Chandragupta, cruelly but well. Yuan Chwang, a
Chinese traveler who spent many years in India in the seventh century
a.d., tells us that the prison maintained by Ashoka north of the capital
was still remem- bered in Hindu tradition as “Ashoka’s Hell.” There,
said his informants, all the tortures of any orthodox Inferno had been
used in the punishment of criminals; to which the King added an edict
that no one who en-</p>
<p>tered that dungeon should ever come out of it alive. But one day
a</p>
<p>Buddhist saint, imprisoned there without cause, and flung into a
cauldron of hot water, refused to boil. The jailer sent word to Ashoka,
who came, saw, and marveled. When the King turned to leave, the jailer
reminded him that according to his own edict he must not leave the
prison alive. The King admitted the force of the remark, and ordered the
jailer to be thrown into the cauldron.</p>
<p>On returning to his palace Ashoka, we are told, underwent a profound
conversion. He gave instructions that the prison should be demolished,
and that the penal code should be made more lenient. At the same time he
learned that his troops had won a great victory over the rebellious
Kalinga tribe, had slaughtered thousands of the rebels, and had taken
many prisoners. Ashoka was moved to remorse at the thought</p>
<p>of all this “violence, slaughter, and separation” of captives “f rom
those whom they love.” He ordered the prisoners freed, restored their
lands to the Kalingas, and sent them a message of apology which had no
prece- dents and has had few imitations. Then he joined the Buddhist
Order,</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROMALEXANDERTO AURANGZEB 447</p>
<p>wore for a time the garb of a monk, gave up hunting and the eating of
meat, and entered upon the Eightfold Noble Way . 81</p>
<p>It is at present impossible to say how much of this is myth, and how
much is history; nor can we discern, at this distance, the motives of
the King. Perhaps he saw the growth of Buddhism, and thought that its
code of generosity and peace might provide a convenient regimen for his
people, saving countless policemen. In the eleventh year of his reign he
began to issue the most remarkable edicts in the history of government,
and commanded that they should be carved upon rocks and pillars in
simple phrase and local dialects, so that any literate Hindu might be
able to understand them. The Rock Edicts have been found in almost every
part of India; of the pillars ten remain in place, and the position of
twenty others has been determined. In these edicts we find the Emperor
accept-* ing the Buddhist faith completely, and applying it resolutely
throughout the last sphere of human affairs in which we should have
expected to find it — statesmanship. It is as if some modem empire had
suddenly announced that henceforth it would practice Christianity.</p>
<p>Though these edicts are Buddhist they will not seem to us
entirely</p>
<p>religious. They assume a future life, and thereby suggest how soon
the scepticism of Buddha had been replaced by the faith of his
followers. But they express no belief in, make no mention of, a personal
God.”</p>
<p>Neither is there any word in them about Buddha. The edicts are not
interested in theology: the Sarnath Edict asks for harmony within the
Church, and prescribes penalties for those who weaken it with schism;”
but other edicts repeatedly enjoin religious tolerance. One must give
alms to Brahmans as well as to Buddhist priests; one must not speak ill
of other men’s faiths. The King announces that all his subjects are his
beloved children, and that he will not discriminate against any of them
because of their diverse creeds . 81 Rock Edict XII speaks with almost
contemporary pertinence:</p>
<p>His Sacred and Gracious Majesty the King does reverence to men</p>
<p>of all sects, whether ascetics or householders, by gifts and
various</p>
<p>forms of reverence.</p>
<p>His Sacred Majesty, however, cares not so much for gifts or</p>
<p>external reverence, as that there should be a growth of the essence
of the matter in all sects. The growth of the essence of the matter</p>
<p>assumes various forms, but the root of it is restraint of speech;
to</p>
<p>wit, a man must not do reverence to his own sect, or disparage
that</p>
<p>448 the story of civilization (chap.xvi</p>
<p>of another, without reason. Depreciation should be for specific rea-
sons only, because the sects of other people all deserve reverence for
some reason or another.</p>
<p>By thus acting a man exalts his own sect, and at the same time</p>
<p>does service to the sects of other people. By acting contrariwise
a</p>
<p>man hurts his own sect, and does disservice to the sects of other</p>
<p>people. . . . Concord is meritorious.</p>
<p>“The essence of the matter” is expl ained more clearly in the Second
Pillar Edict. “The Law of Piety is excellent. But wherein consists
the</p>
<p>Law of Piety? In these things: to wit, little impiety, many good
deeds, compassion, liberality, truthfulness, purity.” To set an example
Ashoka ordered his officials everywhere to regard the people as his
children, to treat them without impatience or harshness, never to
torture them, and never to imprison them without good cause; and he
commanded the officials to read these instructions periodically to the
people . 85</p>
<p>Did these moral edicts have any result in improving the conduct of
the people? Perhaps they had something to do with spreading the idea of
ahimsa, and encouraging abstinence from meat and alcoholic drinks among
the upper classes of India . 88 Ashoka himself had all the confidence of
a reformer in the efficacy of his petrified sermons: in Rock Edict IV he
announces that marvelous results have already appeared; and his summary
gives us a clearer conception of his doctrine:</p>
<p>Now, by reason of the practice of piety by His Sacred and Graci-</p>
<p>ous Majesty the King, the reverberation of the war-drums has be-</p>
<p>come the reverberation of the Law. … As for many years before</p>

<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 449</p>
<p>The good King exaggerated the piety of men and the loyalty of sons.
He himself labored arduously for the new religion; he made himself head
of the Buddhist Church, lavished gifts upon it, built 84,000 monasteries
for it,” and in its name established throughout his kingdom hospitals
for men and animals.” He sent Buddhist missionaries to all parts of
India and Ceylon, even to Syria, Egypt and Greece,” where, perhaps,
they</p>
<p>helped to prepare for the ethics of Christ;“ and shortly after his
death missionaries left India to preach the gospel of Buddha in Tibet,
China, Mongolia and Japan. In addition to this activity in religion,
Ashoka gave himself zealously to the secular administration of his
empire; his days of labor were long, and he kept himself available to
his aides for public business at all hours.“</p>
<p>His outstanding fault was egotism; it is difficult to be at once
modest and a reformer. His self-respect shines out in every edict, and
makes him more completely the brother of Marcus Aurelius. He failed to
perceive that the Brahmans hated him and only bided their time to
destroy him, as the priests of Thebes had destroyed Ikhnaton a thousand
years before. Not only the Brahmans, who had been given to slaughtering
animals for themselves and their gods, but many thousands of hunters and
fishermen resented the edicts that set such severe limitations upon the
taking of animal life; even the peasants growled at the command that
“chaff must not be set on fire along with the living things in it.”“
Half the empire waited hopefully for Ashoka’s death.</p>
<p>Yuan Chwang tells us that according to Buddhist tradition Ashoka in
his last years was deposed by his grandson, who acted with the aid of
court officials. Gradually all power was taken from the old King, and
his gifts to the Buddhist Church came to an end. As hoka’s own allowance
of goods, even of food, was cut down, until one day his whole portion
was half an amalaka fruit. The King gazed upon it sadly, and then sent
it to his Buddhist brethren, as all that he had to give.“ But in truth
we know nothing of his later years, not even the year of his death.
Within a generation after his passing, his empire, like Ikhnaton’s,
crumbled to pieces. As it became evident that the sovereignty of the
Kingdom of Magadha was maintained rather by the inertia of tradition
than by the organization of force, state after state renounced its
adherence to the King of Kings at Pataliputra. Descendants of Ashoka
continued to rule Magadha till the seventh century after Christ; but the
Maurya Dynasty that Chandragupta had founded came to an end when King
Brihadratha</p>
<p>450 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>was assassinated. States are built not on the ideals but on the
nature of men.</p>
<p>In the political sense Ashoka had failed; in another sense he had
accom- plished one of the greatest tasks in history. Within two hundred
years after his death Buddhism had spread throughout India, and was
entering upon the bloodless conquest of Asia. If to this day, from Kandy
in Ceylon to Kamakura in Japan, the placid face of Gautama bids men be
gentle to one another and love peace, it is partly because a dreamer,
perhaps a saint, once held the throne of India.</p>

<li>THE GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA</li>
</ol>

<p>in India — Harsha the generous — The travels of Yuan</p>
<p>Chwang</p>
<p>From the death of Ashoka to the empire of the Guptas — i.e., for
a</p>
<p>period of almost six hundred years — Hindu inscriptions and documents
are so few that the history of this interval is lost in obscurity.“ It
was not necessarily a Dark Age; great universities like those at Taxila
con- tinued to function, and in the northwestern portion of India the
influence of Persia in architecture, and of Greece in sculpture,
produced a flourish- ing civilization in the wake of Alexander’s
invasion. In the first and second centuries before Christ, Syrians,
Greeks and Scythians poured down into the Punjab, conquered it, and
established there, for some three hundred years, this Greco-Bactrian
culture. In the first century of what we so provincially call the
Christian Era the Kushans, a central Asian tribe</p>
<p>akin to the Turks, captured Kabul, and from that city as capital
extended their power throughout northwestern India and most of Central
Asia. In the reign of their greatest king, Kanishka, the arts and
sciences pro- gressed: Greco-Buddhist sculpture produced some of its
fairest master- pieces, fine buildings were reared in Peshawar, Taxila
and Mathura, Charaka advanced the art of medicine, and Nagarjuna and
Ashvaghosha laid the bases of that Mahayana (Greater Vehicle) Buddhism
which was to help Gautama to win China and Japan. Kanishka tolerated
many re- ligions, and experimented with various gods; finally he chose
the new mythological Buddhism that had made Buddha into a deity and had
filled the skies with Bodhisattwas and Arhats; he called a great council
of</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 45 1</p>
<p>Buddhist theologians to formulate this creed for his realms, and
became almost a second Ashoka in spreading the Buddhist faith. The
Council composed 300,000 sutras, lowered Buddha’s philosophy to the
emotional needs of the common soul, and raised him to divinity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Chandragupta I (quite distinct, despite his name and num-
ber, from Chandragupta Maurya) had established in Magadha the Gupta
Dynasty of native kings. His successor, Samudragupta, in a reign of</p>
<p>fifty years, made himself one of the foremost monarchs in India’s
long history. He changed his capital from Pataliputra to Ayodhya,
ancient home of the legendary Rama; sent his conquering armies and
tax-gatherers into Bengal, Assam, Nepal, and southern India; and spent
the treasure brought to him from vassal states in promoting literature,
science, religion and the arts. He himself, in the interludes of war,
achieved distinction as a poet and a musician. His son, Vikramaditya
(“Sun of Power”), ex -</p>
<p>tended these conquests of arms and the mind, supported the great
dram- atist Kalidasa, and gathered a brilliant circle of poets,
philosophers,</p>
<p>artists, scientists and scholars about him in his capital at Ujjain.
Under these two kings India reached a height of development unsurpassed
since Buddha, and a political unity rivaled only under Ashoka and
Akbar.</p>
<p>We discern some outline of Gupta civilization from the account that
Fa-Hien gave of his visit to India at the opening of the fifth century
of our era. He was one of many Buddhists who came from China to India
during this Golden Age; and these pilgrims were probably less numerous
than the merchants and ambassadors who, despite her mountain barriers,
now entered pacified India from East and West, even from distant Rome,
and brought to her a stimulating contact with foreign customs and ideas.
Fa-Hien, after risking his life in passing through western China, found
himself quite safe in India, traveling everywhere without encountering
molestation or thievery .“ His journal tells how he took six years in
coming, spent six years in India, and needed three years more for his
return via Ceylon and Java to his Chinese home. 10 He describes with
admiration the wealth and prosperity, the virtue and happiness, of the
Hindu people, and the social and religious liberty which they enjoyed.
He was aston- ished at the number, size and population of the great
cities, at the free hospitals and other charitable institutions which
dotted the land,* at the number of students in the universities and
monasteries, and at the impos-</p>

<p>ing scale and splendor of the imperial palaces.“ His description is
quite Utopian, except for the matter of right hands:</p>
<p>The people are numerous and happy; they have not to register</p>
<p>their households, or attend to any magistrates or their rules;
only</p>
<p>those who cultivate the royal land have to pay a portion of the</p>
<p>gain from it. If they want to go they go; if they want to stay</p>
<p>they stay. The king governs without decapitation or corporal pun-</p>
<p>ishments. Criminals are simply fined; . . . even in cases of
repeated</p>
<p>attempts at wicked rebellion they only have their right hands cut</p>
<p>off. . . . Throughout the whole country the people do not kill
any</p>
<p>living creature, nor eat onions or garlic. The only exception is
that</p>
<p>of the Chandalas. … In that country they do not keep pigs and</p>
<p>fowls, and do not sell live cattle; in the markets there are n o
butchers’ shops, and no dealers in intoxicating drinks.“</p>
<p>Fa-Hien hardly noted that the Brahmans, who had been in disfavor</p>
<p>with the Mauryan dynasty since Ashoka, were growing again in wealth
and power under the tolerant rule of the Gupta kings. They had revived
the religious and literary traditions of pre-Buddhist days, and were de-
veloping Sanskrit into the Esperanto of scholars throughout India. It
was under their influence and the patronage of the court that the great
Hindu epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, were written down into
their present form.” Under this dynasty, too, Buddhist art reached -
torian,” says Havell, “might well consider that the greatest triumph of
British administration would be to restore to India all that she enjoyed
in the fifth century a.d.”“</p>
<p>This heyday of native culture was interrupted by a wave of those Hun
invasions which now overran both Asia and Europe, ruining for a time
India as well as Rome. While Attila was raiding Europe, Toramana was
capturing Malwa, and the terrible Mihiragula was hurling the Gupta
rulers from their throne. For a century India relapsed into bondage and
chaos. Then a scion of the Gupta line, Harsha-Vardhana, recaptured
northern India, built a capital at Kanauj, and for forty-two years gave
peace and security to a wide realm, in which once more native arts
and</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AVRANGZEB 453</p>
<p>letters flourished. We may conjecture the size, splendor and
prosperity of Kanauj from the one unbelievable item that when the
Moslems sacked it (1018 a.d.) they destroyed 10,000 temples. 58 Its fine
public gardens and free bathing tanks were but a small part of the
beneficence of the new dynasty. Harsha himself was one of those rare
kings who make monarchy appear — for a time — the most admirable of all
forms of govern- ment. He was a man of personal charm and
accomplishments, writing poetry and dramas that are read in India to
this day; but he did not allow these foibles to interfere with the
competent administration of his king- dom. “He was indefatigable,” says
Yuan Chwang, “and the day was too short for him; he forgot sleep in his
devotion to good works.” 5 * Having begun as a worshiper of Shiva he was
later converted to Buddhism, and became another Ashoka in his pious
benefactions. He forbade the eating of animal food, established
travelers’ rests throughout his domain, and erected thousands of topes,
or Buddhist shrines, on the banks of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Yuan Chwang, most famous of the Chinese Buddhists who visited</p>
<p>India, tells us that Harsha proclaimed, every five years, a great
festival of charity, to which he invited all officials of all religions,
and all the</p>
<p>poor and needy of the realm. At this gathering it was his custom to
give away in public alms all the surplus brought into the state treasury
since the last quinquennial feast. Yuan was surprised to see a great
quantity of gold, silver, coins, jewelry, fine fabrics and delicate
brocades piled up in an open square, surrounded by a hundred pavilions
each seating a thousand persons. Three days were given to religious
exercises; on the fourth day (if we -may believe the incredible pilgrim)
the distribution began. Ten thousand Buddhist monks were fed, and each
received a pearl, garments, flowers, perfumes, and one hundred pieces of
gold. Then the Brahmans were given alms almost as abundant; then the
Jains; then other sects; then all the poor and orphaned laity that had
come from every quarter of the kingdom. Sometimes the distribution
lasted three or four months. At the end Harsha divested himself of his
costly robes and jewelry, and added them to the alms. 55</p>
<p>The memoirs of Yuan Chwang reveal a certain theological exhilaration
as the mental spirit of the age. It is a pleasant picture, and
significant of India’s repute in other lands— this Chinese aristocrat
leaving his comforts and perquisites in far- off Ch’ang -an, passing
across half-civilized western China, through Tashkent and Samarkand
(then a flourishing city), over</p>
<p>454 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>the Himalayas into India, and then studying zealously, for three
years, in the monastic university at Nalanda. His fame as a scholar and
a man of rank brought him many invitations from the princes of India.
When Harsha heard that Yuan was at the court of Kumara, King of
Assam,</p>
<p>he summoned Kumara to come with Yuan to Kanauj. Kumara refused,
saying that Harsha could have his head, but not his guest. Harsha</p>
<p>answered: “I trouble you for your head,” and Kumara came. Harsha was
fascinated by Yuan’s learning and fine manners, and called a con -
vocation of Buddhist notables to hear Yuan expound the Mahayana doc-
trine. Yuan nailed his theses to the gateway of the pavilion in which
the discourse was to be held, and added a postscript in the manner of
the day: “If any one here can find a single wrong argument and can
refute</p>
<p>All the glory of Harsha’s rule, however, was artificial and
precarious, for it depended upon the ability and generosity of a mortal
king. When he died a usurper seized the throne, and illustrated the
nether side of monarchy. Chaos ensued, and continued for almost a
thousand years. India, like Europe, now suffered her Middle Ages, was
overrun by bar- barians, was conquered, divided, and despoiled. Not
until the great Akbar would she know peace and unity again.</p>

<li>ANNALS OF RAJPUTANA</li>
</ol>
<p>The Samurai of India — The age of chivalry — The fall of Chitor</p>
<p>This Dark Age was lighted up for a moment by the epic of Rajputana.
Here, in the states of Mewar, Marwar, Amber, Bikaner and many others of
melodious name, a people half native in origin and half descended from
invading Scythians and Huns, had built a feudal civilization under the
government of warlike rajas who cared more for the art of life than</p>
<p>for the life of art. They began by acknowledging the suzerainty of
the Mauryas and the Guptas; they ended by defending their
independence,</p>
<p>455</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB</p>
<p>and all India, from the inroads of Moslem hordes. Their clans were
dis- tinguished by a military ardor and courage not usually associated
with India;* if we may trust their admiring historian, Tod, every man
of</p>
<p>them was a dauntless Kshatriya, and every woman among them was a
heroine. Their very name, Rajputs, meant “sons of kings”; and if</p>
<p>sometimes they called their land Rajasthan, it was to designate it as
“the home of royalty.”</p>
<p>All the nonsense and glamor — all the bravery, loyalty, beauty,
feuds, poisons, assassinations, wars, and subjection of woman — which
our tradi- tions attach to the Age of Chivalry can be found in the
annals of these plucky states. “The Rajput chieftains,” says Tod, “were
imbued with</p>
<p>all the kindred virtues of the western cavalier, and far his superior
in mental attainments .” 60 They had lovely women for whom they did not
hesitate to die, and who thought it only a matter of courtesy to accom-
pany their husbands to the grave by the rite of suttee. Some of these
women were educated and refined; some of the rajas were poets, or
scientists; and for a while a delicate genre of water-color painting
flour- ished among them in the medieval Persian style. For four
centuries they grew in wealth, until they could spend 0,000,000 on the
coronation of Mewar’s king.“</p>
<p>It was their pride and their tragedy that they enjoyed war as the
highest art of all, the only one befitting a Rajput gentleman. This
military spirit enabled them to defend themselves against the Moslems
with historic valor, f but it kept their little states so divided and
weakened with strife that not all their bravery could preserve them in
the end. Tod’s account of the fall of Chitor, one of the Rajput
capitals, is as romantic as any legend of Arthur or Charlemagne; and
indeed (since it is based solely upon native historians too faithful to
their fatherland to be in love with truth) these marvelous Annals of
Rajasthan may be as legendary as Le Morte d’ Arthur or Le Chanson de
Roland. In this version the Mohamme dan invader, Alau-d-din, wanted not
Chitor but the princess Pudmini — “a title bestowed only on the
superlatively fair.” The Moslem chieftain pro - posed to raise the siege
if the regent of Chitor would surrender the princess. Being refused,
Alau-d-din agreed to withdraw if he were allowed to see</p>
<p>•But cf. Arrian on ancient India: “In war the Indians were by far the
bravest of all the races inhabiting Asia at that time .” 58</p>

to die .” 61</p>

mirror; but this too was denied him. Instead, the women of Chitor</p>
<p>joined in defending their city; and when the Rajputs saw their wives
and daughters dying beside them they fought until every man of them was
dead. When Alau-d-din entered the capital he found no sign of human life
within its gates; all the males had died in battle, and their wives, in
the awful rite known as the Johur, had burned themselves to death .

<p>The kingdoms of the Deccan — V ijayanagar — Krishna Raya —</p>
<p>A medieval metropolis — Laws — Arts — Religion — Tragedy</p>
<p>As the Moslems advanced into India native culture receded farther and
farther south; and towards the end of these Middle Ages the finest</p>
<p>achievements of Hindu .civilization were those of the Deccan. For a
time the Chalyuka tribe maintained an independent kingdom reaching
across central India, and achieved, under Pulakeshin II, sufficient
power and glory to defeat Harsha, to attract Yuan Chwang, and to receive
a respectful embassy from Khosrou II of Persia. It was in Pulakeshin’s
reign and ter - ritory that the greatest of Indian paintings — the
frescoes of Ajanta — were completed. Pulakeshin was overthrown by the
king of the Pallavas, who for a brief period became the supreme power in
central India. In the extreme south, and as early as the first century
after Christ, the Pandyas established a realm comprising Madura,
Tinnevelly, and parts of Travancore; they made Madura one of the finest
of medieval Hindu cities, and adorned it with a gigantic temple and a
thousand lesser works of architectural art. In their turn they too were
overthrown, first by the Cholas, and then by the Mohammedans. The Cholas
ruled the region between Madura and Madras, and thence westward to
Mysore. They were of great antiquity, be- ing mentioned in the edicts of
Ashoka; but we know nothing of them until the ninth century, when they
began a long career of conquest that brought them tribute from all
southern India, even from Ceylon. Then their power waned, and they
passed under the control of the greatest of the southern states,
Vijayanagar.*</p>
<p>Vijayanagar — the name both of a kingdom and of its capital — is a
melan- choly instance of forgotten glory. In the years of its grandeur

<ul>
<li>In this medley of now almost forgotten kingdoms there were periods

we must pass by, without so much as mentioning them, men who for a</li>

<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 457</p>
<p>prised all the present native states of the lower peninsula, together
with Mysore and the entire Presidency of Madras. We may judge of its
power and resources by considering that King Krishna Raya led forth to
battle at Talikota 703,000 foot, 32,600 horse, 551 elephants, and some
hundred thousand merchants, prostitutes and other camp followers such as
were then wont to accompany an army in its campaigns. 83 The autocracy
of the king was softened by a measure of village autonomy, and by the
occasional appearance of an enlightened and human monarch on the throne.
Krishna Raya, who ruled Vijayanagar in the days of Henry</p>
<p>VIII, compares favorably with that constant lover. He led a life of
justice and courtesy, gave abounding alms, tolerated all Hindu faiths,
enjoyed and supported literature and the arts, forgave fallen enemies
and spared their cities, and devoted himself sedulously to the chores of
administra- tion. A Portuguese missionary, Domingos Paes (1522),
describes him as</p>
<p>the most feared and perfect king that could possibly be; cheerful</p>
<p>of disposition, and very merry; he is one that seeks to honor
for-</p>
<p>eigners, and receives them kindly. … He is a great ruler, and a</p>
<p>man of much justice, but subject to sudden fits of rage. . . . He
is</p>
<p>by rank a greater lord than any, by reason of what he possesses</p>
<p>in armies and territories; but it seems that he has in fact
nothing</p>
<p>compared to what a man like him ought to have, so gallant and per-
fect is he in all things. 8 **</p>
<p>The capital, founded in 1336, was probably the richest city that
India had yet known. Nicolo Conti, visiting it about 1420, estimated its
circum- ference at sixty miles; Paes pronounced it “as large as Rome,
and very beautiful to the sight.” There were, he added, “many groves of
trees within it, and many conduits of water”; for its engineers had
constructed a huge dam in the Tungabadra River, and had formed a
reservoir from which water was conveyed to the city by an aqueduct
fifteen miles long, cut for several miles out of the solid rock. Abdu-r
Razzak, who saw the city in 1443, reported it as “such that eye has not
seen, nor ear heard, of any place resembling it upon the whole earth.”
Paes considered it “the</p>
<p>time thought they dominated the earth. For example, Vikramaditya, who
ruled the Chalyukans for half a century (1076-1126), was so successful
in war that (like Nietzsche) he proposed to found a new chronological
era, dividing all history into before him and after him. Today he is a
footnote.</p>

<p>best- provided city in tne world, . . . ror in this one everything
abounds.” The houses, he tells us, numbered over a hundred thousand —
implying a population of half a million souls. He marvels at a palace in
which one room was built entirely of ivory; “it is so rich and beautiful
that you</p>
<p>would hardly find anywhere another such .” 08 When Firoz Shah, Su
ltan of Delhi, married the daughter of Vijayanagar’s king in the
latter’s capital, the road was spread for six miles with velvet, satin,
cloth of gold and other costly stuffs.” However, every traveler is a
liar.</p>
<p>Underneath this wealth a population of serfs and laborers lived
in</p>
<p>poverty and superstition, subject to a code of laws that preserved
some commercial morality by a barbarous severity. Punishment ranged from
mutilation of hands or feet to casting a man to the elephants, cutting
off his head, impaling him alive by a stake thrust through his belly, or
hang- ing him on a hook under his chin until he died ; 68 rape as well
as large- scale theft was punished in this last way. Prostitution was
permitted, regulated, and turned into royal revenue. “Opposite the
mint,” says</p>
<p>Abdu- r Razzak, “is the office of the prefect of the city, to which
it is</p>
<p>said twelve thousand policemen are attached; and their pay … is de-
rived from the proceeds of the brothels. The splendor of these houses,
the beauty of the heart-ravishers, their blandishments and ogles, are
be- yond all description .” 00 Women were of subject status, and were
expected to kill themselves on the death of their husbands, sometimes by
allowing themselves to be buried alive.™</p>
<p>Under the Rayas or Kings of Vijayanagar literature prospered,
both</p>
<p>in classical Sanskrit and in the Telugu dialect of the south. Krishna
Raya was himself a poet, as well as a liberal patron of letters; and his
poet laureate, Alasani-Peddana, is ranked among the highest of India’s
singers. Painting and architecture flourished; enormous temples were
built, and almost every foot of their surface was carved into statuary
or bas-relief. Buddhism had lost its hold, and a form of Brahmanism that
especially honored Vishnu had become the faith of the people. The cow
was holy and was never killed; but many species of cattle and fowl were
sacrificed to the gods, and eaten by the people. Religion was brutal,
and manners were refined.</p>
<p>In one day all this power and luxury were destroyed. Slowly the</p>
<p>conquering Moslems had made their way south; now the sultans of
Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golkonda and Bidar united their forces to reduce
this last stronghold of the native Hindu kings. Their combined
armies</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 459</p>
<p>met Rama Raja’s half -million men at Talikota; the superior numbers
of the attackers prevailed; Rama Raja was captured and beheaded in the
sight of his followers, and these, losing courage, fled. Nearly a
hundred thousand of them were slain in the retreat, until all the
streams were colored with their blood. The conquering troops plundered
the wealthy capital, and found the booty so abundant “that every private
man in the allied army became rich in gold, jewels, effects, tents,
arms, horses and slaves.’” 1 For five months the plunder continued: the
victors slaughtered the help- less inhabitants in indiscriminate
butchery, emptied the stores and shops, smashed the temples and palaces,
and labored at great pains to destroy all the statuary and painting in
the city; then they went through the streets with flaming torches, and
set fire to all that would burn. When at last they retired, Vijayanagar
was as completely ruined as if an earth- quake had visited it and had
left nor a stone upon a stone. It was a de- struction ferocious and
absolute, typifying that terrible Moslem con- quest of India which had
begun a thousand years before, and was now complete.</p>

<p>Indian history</p>
<p>The Mohammedan Conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in
history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that
civiliza- tion is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order
and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by
barbarians invading from without or multiplying within. The Hindus had
allowed their</p>
<p>strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted
re- ligions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks
of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of
their frontiers and their capitals, their wealth and their freedom, from
the hordes of Scythians, Huns, Afghans and Turks hovering about India’s
boundaries and waiting for national weakness to let them in. For four
hundred years (600-1000 a.d.) India invited conquest; and at last it
came.</p>
<p>The first Moslem attack was a passing raid upon Multan, in the
western Punjab (664 a.d.) Similar raids occurred at the convenience of
the in- vaders during the next three centuries, with the result that the
Moslems</p>
<p>460 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>established themselves in the Indus valley about the same time that
their Arab co-religionists in the West were fighting the battle of Tours
(732 a.d.) for the mastery of Europe. But the real Moslem conquest of
India did not come till the turn of the first millennium after
Christ.</p>
<p>In the year 997 a Turkish chieftain by the name of Mahmud became
sultan of the little state of Ghazni, in eastern Afghanistan. Mahmud
knew that his throne was young and poor, and saw that India, across the
border, was old and rich; the conclusion was obvious. Pretending a holy
zeal for destroying Hindu idolatry, he swept across the frontier with a
force in- spired by a pious aspiration for booty. He met the unprepared
Hindus at Bhimnagar, slaughtered them, pillaged their cities, destroyed
their tem- ples, and carried away the accumulated treasures of
centuries. Returning to Ghazni he astonished the ambassadors of foreign
powers by displaying “jewels and unbored pearls and rubies shining like
sparks, or like wine congealed with ice, and emeralds like fresh sprigs
of myrtle, and diamonds in size and weight like pomegranates.”” Each
winter Mahmud descended into India, filled his treasure chest with
spoils, and amused his men with full freedom to pillage and kill; each
spring he returned to his capital richer than before. At Mathura (on the
Jumna) he took from the temple its statues of gold encrusted with
precious stones, and emptied its coffers of a vast quantity of gold,
silver and jewelry; he expressed his admiration for the architecture of
the great shrine, judged that its duplication would cost one hundred
million dinars and the labor of two hundred years, and then ordered it
to be soaked with naphtha and burnt to the ground.” Six years later he
sacked another opulent city of northern India, Somnath, killed all its
fifty thousand inhabitants, and dragged its wealth to Ghazni. In the end
he became, perhaps, the richest king that history has ever known.
Sometimes he spared the population of the ravaged cities, and took them
home to be sold as slaves; but so great was the number of such captives
that after some years no one could be found to offer more than a few
shillings for a slave. Before every important engagement Mahmud knelt in
prayer, and asked the blessing of God upon his arms. He reigned for a
third of a century; and when he died, full of years and honors,</p>
<p>Moslem historians ranked him as the greatest monarch of his time, and
one of the greatest sovereigns of any age.”</p>
<p>Seeing the canonization that success had brought to this magnificent
thief, other Moslem rulers profited by his example, though none
succeeded in bettering his instruction. In 1186 the Ghuri, a Turkish
tribe of Afghan-</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDERTO AURA NGZEB 461</p>
<p>istan, invaded India, captured the city of Delhi, destroyed its
temples, confiscated its wealth, and settled down in its palaces to
establish the Sultanate of Delhi — an alien despotism fastened upon
northern India for three centuries, and checked only by assassination
and revolt. The first of these bloody sultans, Kutb-d Din Aibak, was a
normal specimen of his kind — fanatical, ferocious and merciless. His
gifts, as the Mohammedan historian tells us, “were bestowed by hundreds
of thousands, and his slaughters likewise were by hundreds of
thousands.” In one victory of this warrior (who had been purchased as a
slave), “fifty thousand men came under the collar of slavery, and the
plain became black as pitch with Hindus.’” 5 Another sultan, Balban,
punished rebels and brigands by cast - ing them under the feet of
elephants, or removing their skins, stuffing these with straw, and
hanging them from the gates of Delhi. When some Mongol inhabitants who
had settled in Delhi, and had been converted to Islam, attempted a
rising, Sultan Alau-d-din (the conquerer of Chitor) had all the males —
from fifteen to thirty thousand of them — slaughtered in one day. Sultan
Muhammad bin Tughlak acquired the throne by</p>
<p>murdering his father, became a great scholar and an elegant writer,
dabbled in mathematics, physics and Greek philosophy, surpassed his
predecessors in bloodshed and brutality, fed the flesh of a rebel nephew
to the rebel’s wife and children, ruined the country with reckless infla
- tion, and laid it waste with pillage and murder till the inhabitants
fled to the jungle. He killed so many Hindus that, in the words of a
Moslem historian, “there was constantly in front of his royal pavilion
and his Civil Court a mound of dead bodies and a heap of corpses, while
the sweepers and executioners were wearied o ut by their work of
dragging” the vic - tims “and putting them to death in crowds.”™ In
order to found a new capital at Daulatabad he drove every inhabitant
from Delhi and left it a desert; and hearing that a blind man bad stayed
behind in Delhi, he ordered him to be dragged from the old to the new
capital, so that only a leg remained of the wretch when his last journey
was finished.“ The Sultan complained that the people did not love him,
or recognize his undeviating justice. He ruled India for a quarter of a
century, and died in bed. His successor, Firoz Shah, invaded Bengal,
offered a reward for every Hindu head, paid for 180,000 of them, raided
Hindu villages for slaves, and died at the ripe age of eighty. Sultan
Ahmad Shah feasted for three days whenever the number of defenseless
Hindus slain in his territories in one day reached twenty thousand.™</p>
<p>4&lt; THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>These rulers were often men of ability, and their followers were
gifted with fierce courage and industry; only so can we understand how
they could have maintained their rule among a hostile people so
overwhelm- ingly outnumbering them. All of them were armed with a
religion</p>
<p>militaristic in operation, but far superior in its stoical monotheism
to any of the popular cults of India; they concealed its attractiveness
by making the public exercise of the Hindu religions illegal, and
thereby driving them more deeply into the Hindu soul. Some of these
thirsty despots had culture as well as ability; they patronized the
arts, and engaged artists and artisans — usually of Hindu origin — to
build for them magnifi- cent mosques and tombs; some of them were
scholars, and delighted in converse with historians, poets and
scientists. One of the greatest scholars of Asia, Alberuni, accompanied
Mahmud of Ghazni to India, and wrote a scientific survey of India
comparable to Pliny’s Natural History and</p>
<p>Humboldt’s Cosmos. The Moslem historians were almost as numerous as
the generals, and yielded nothing to them in the enjoyment of blood-
shed and war. The Sultans drew from the people every rupee of tribute
that could be exacted by the ancient art of taxation, as well as by
straight- forward robbery; but they stayed in India, spent their spoils
in India, and ther eby turned them back into India’s economic life.
Nevertheless, their terrorism and, exploitation advanced that weakening
of Hindu phy- sique and morale which had been begun by an exhausting
climate, an inadequate diet, political disunity, and pessimistic
religions.</p>
<p>The usual policy of the Sultans was clearly sketched by
Alau-d-din,</p>
<p>who required his advisers to draw up “rules and regulations for
grinding down the Hindus, and for depriving them of that wealth and
property which fosters disaffection an d rebellion .” 80 Half of the
gross produce of the soil was collected by the government; native rulers
had taken one- sixth. “No Hindu,” says a Moslem historian, “could hold
up his head, and in their houses no sign of gold or silver … or of any
superfluity</p>
<p>was to be seen. . . . Blows, confinement in the stocks, imprisonment
and chains, were all employed to enforce payment.” When one of his own
advisers protested against this policy, Alau-d- din answered: “Oh,
Doctor, thou art a learned man, but thou hast no experience; I am an
unlettered man, but I have a great deal. Be assured, then, that the
Hindus will never become submissive and obedient till they are reduced
to poverty. I have therefore given orders that just sufficient shall be
left to them from year to year of com, milk and curds, but that they
shall not be allowed to accumulate hoards and property .” 81</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 463</p>
<p>This is the secret of the political history of modem India.
Weakened</p>
<p>by division, it succumbed to invaders; impoverished by invaders, it
lost all power of resistance, and took refuge in supernatural
consolations; it argued that both mastery and slavery were superficial
delusions, and concluded that freedom of the body or the nation was
hardly worth defending in so brief a life. The bitter lesson that may be
drawn from this tragedy is that eternal vigilance is the price of
civilization. A nation must love peace, but keep its powder dry.</p>

<p>It is in the nature of governments to degenerate; for power, as
Shelley said, poisons every hand that touches it. 82 The excesses of the
Delhi Sultans lost them the support not only of the Hindu population,
but of their Moslem followers. When fresh invasions came from the
north</p>
<p>these Sultans were defeated with the same ease with which they them-
selves had won India.</p>
<p>Their first conqueror was Tamerlane himself — more properly Timur-i-
lang — a Turk who had accepted Islam as an admirable weapon, and had
given himself a pedigree going back to Genghis Khan, in order to win the
support of his Mongol horde. Having attained the throne of Samarkand and
feeling the need of more gold, it dawned upon him that India was still
full of infidels. His generals, mindful of Moslem courage, demurred,
pointing out that the infidels who could be reached from Samarkand were
already under Mohammedan rule. Mullahs learned in the Koran decided the
matter by quoting an inspiring verse: “Oh Prophet, make war upon
infidels and unbelievers, and treat them with severity.” 88 Thereupon
Timur crossed the Indus (1398), massacred or enslaved such of the in-
habitants as could not flee from him, defeated the forces of Sultan
Mahmud Tughlak, occupied Delhi, slew a hundred thousand prisoners in
cold</p>
<p>blood, plundered the city of all the wealth that the Afghan dynasty
had gathered there, and carried it off to Samarkand with a multitude of
women and slaves, leaving anarchy, famine and pestilence in his wake.
84</p>
<p>The Delhi Sultans remounted their throne, and taxed India for another
century before the real conqueror came. Babur, founder of the great</p>
<p>4O4 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Mogul* Dynasty, was a man every whit as brave and fascinating as
Alex- ander. Descended from both Timur and Genghis Khan, he inherited
all the ability of these scourges of Asia without their brutality. He
suffered from a surplus of energy in body and mind; he fought, hunted
and traveled insatiably; it was nothing for him, single-handed, to kill
five enemies in five minutes.“ In two days he rode one hundred and sixty
miles on horse- back, and swam the Ganges twice in the bargain; and in
his last years he remarked that not since the age of eleven had he kept
the fast of Ramadan twice in the same place . 88</p>
<p>“In the twelfth year of my age,” he begins his Memoirs , “I became
the ruler in the country of Farghana .” 80 At fifteen he besieged and
captured</p>
<p>His son, Humayun, was too weak and vacillating, and too addicted</p>
<p>to opiu m, to carry on Babur’s work. Sher Shah, an Afghan chief, de
-</p>
<p>feated him in two bloody battles, and restored for a time the Afghan
power in India. Sher Shah, though capable of slaughter in the best</p>
<p>Islamic style, rebuilt Delhi in fine architectural taste, and
established governmental reforms that prepared for the enlightened rule
of Akbar. Two minor Shahs held the power for a decade; then Humayun,
after twelve years of hardship and wandering, organized a force in
Persia, re- entered India, and recaptured the throne. Eight months later
Humayun fell from the terrace of his library, and died.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mogul is another form of Mongol. The Moguls were really Turks; but
the Hindus called — and still call — all northern Moslems (except the
Afghans) Moguls . 85 “Babur” was a Mongol nickname, meaning lion; the
real name of the first Mogul Emperor of India was Zahiru-d din Muhammad
88</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAP.XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 465</p>
<p>During his exile and poverty his wife had borne him a son whom he</p>
<p>had piously called Muhammad, but whom India was to call Akbar —</p>
<p>that is, “Very Great.” No effort was spared to make him great; even
his ancestry had taken every precaution, for in his veins ran the
blood</p>
<p>of Babur, Timur and Genghis Khan. Tutors were supplied him in</p>
<p>abundance, but he rejected them, and refused to learn how to read.
In- stead he educated himself for kingship by incessant and dangerous
sport; he became a perfect horseman, played polo royally, and knew the
art of controlling the most ferocious elephants; he was always ready to
set out on a lion or tiger hunt, to undergo any fatigue, and to face all
dangers in the first person. Like a good Turk he had no effeminate
distaste for human blood; when, at the age of fourteen, he was invited
to win the title of Ghazi — Slayer of the Infidel — by killing a Hindu
prisoner, he cut off the man’s head at once with one stroke of his
scimitar. These were the barbarous beginnings of a man destined to
become one of the wisest, most humane and most cultured of all the kings
known to history.*</p>
<p>At the age of eighteen he took over from the Regent the full
direction of affairs. His dominion then extended over an eighth of India
— a belt of territory some three hundred miles broad, running from the
north- west frontier at Multan to Benares in the East. He set out with
the zeal and voracity of his grandfather to extend these borders; and by
a series of ruthless wars he made himself ruler of all Hindustan except
for the little Rajput kingdom of Mewar. Returning to Delhi he put aside
his</p>
<p>armor, and devoted himself to re-organizing the administration of his
realm. His power was absolute, and all important offices, even in
distant provinces, were filled by his appointment. His principal aides
were four: a Prime Minister or Vakir; a Finance Minister, called
sometimes Vazir (Vizier), sometimes D’vwan; a Master of the Court, or
Bakhshi; and a Pri- mate or Sadr, who was head of the Mohammedan
religion in India. As his rule acquired tradition and prestige he
depended less and less upon military power, and contented himself with a
standing army of some twenty-five thousand men. In time of war this
modest force was aug- mented with troops recruited by the provincial
military governors — a pre- carious arrangement which had something to
do with the fall of the</p>

<li>Later he came to recognize the value of books, and — being still
unable to read — listened for hours while others read to him, often from
abstruse and difficult volumes. In the end he became an illiterate
scholar, loving letters and art, and supporting them with royal
largesse.</li>

<p>466 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION ( CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>Mogul Empire under Aurangzeb.* Bribery and embezzlement throve among
these governors and their subordinates, so that much of Akbar’s time was
spent in checking corruption. He regulated with strict economy the
expenses of his court and household, fixing the prices of food and
materials bought for them, and the wages of labor engaged by the state.
When he died he left the equivalent of a billion dollars in the
treasury, and his empire was the most powerful on earth.“</p>
<p>Both law and taxation were severe, but far less than before. From</p>
<p>one-sixth to one-third of the gross produce of the soil was taken
from the peasants, amounting to some f 100,000,000 a year in land tax.
The Emperor was legislator, executive and judge; as supreme court he
spent many hours in giving audience to important litigants. His law
forbade child marriage and compulsory suttee, sanctioned the remarriage
of widows, abolished the slavery of captives and the slaughter of
animals for sacrifice, gave freedom to all religions, opened career to
every talent of whatever creed or race, and removed the head-tax that
the Afghan</p>
<p>rulers had placed upon all Hindus unconverted to Islam.” At the
beginning of his reign the law included such punishments as mutilation;
at the end it was probably the most enlightened code of any
sixteenth-century gov- ernment. Every state begins with violence, and
(if it becomes secure) mellows into liberty.</p>
<p>But the strength of a ruler is often the weakness of his government.
The system depended so much upon Akbar’s superior qualities of mind and
character that obviously it would threaten to disintegrate at his death.
He had, of course, most of the virtues, since he engaged most of the
historians: he was the best athlete, the best horseman, the best swords-
man, one of the greatest architects, and by all odds the handsomest man
in the kingdom. Actually he had long arms, bow legs, narrow Mongoloid
eyes, a head drooping leftward, and a wart on his nose.” He made him -
self presentable by neatness, dignity, serenity, and brilliant eyes that
could sparkle (says a contemporary) “like the sea in sunshine,” or flare
up in a way to make the offender tremble with terror, like Vandamme
before Napoleon. He dressed simply, in brocaded cap, blouse and
trousers, jewels and bare feet. He cared little for meat, and gave it up
almost entirely</p>
<ul>
<li>The army was supplied with the best ordnance yet seen in India, but
inferior to that then in use in Europe. Akbar’s efforts to secure better
guns failed; and this inferiority in the instruments of slaughter
cooperated with the degeneration of his descendants in de- termining the
European conquest of India.</li>

<p>in his later years, saying that “it is not right that a man should
make his stomach the grave of animals.” Nevertheless he was strong in
body and will, excelled in many active sports, and thought nothing of
walking</p>
<p>thirty-six miles in a day. He liked polo so much that he invented
a</p>
<p>luminous ball in order that the game might be played at night. He in-
herited the violent impulses of his family, and in his youth (like his
Chris - tian contemporaries) he was capable of solving problems by
assassination. Gradually he learned, in Woodrow Wilson’s phrase, to sit
upon his own volcano; and he rose far above his time in that spirit of
fair play which does not always distinguish Oriental rulers. “His
clemency,” says</p>
<p>Firishta, “was without bounds; this virtue he often carried beyond
the line of prudence .” 03 He was generous, expending vast sums in alms;
he was affable to all, but especially to the lowly; “their little
offerings,” says a Jesuit missionary, “he used to accept with such a
pleased look, handling them and putting them in his bosom, as he did not
do with the most lavish gifts of the nobles.” One of his contemporaries
described him as an epileptic; many said that melancholy possessed him
to a morbid degree. Perhaps to put a brighter color on reality, he drank
liquor and took</p>
<p>opium, in moderation; his father and his children had similar habits,
with- out similar self-control.* He had a harem suitable to the size of
his em- pire; one gossip tells us th at “the King hath in Agra and
Fathpur -Sikri, as they do credibly report, one thousand elephants,
thirty thousand horses, fourteen hundred tame deer, eight hundred
concubines.” But he does not seem to have had sensual ambitions or
tastes. He married widely, but politically; he pleased the Rajput
princes by espousing their daughters, and thereby bound them to the
support of his throne; and from that time the Mogul Dynasty was half
native in blood. A Rajput became his lead- ing general, and a raja rose
to be his greatest minister. His dream was a united India . 01</p>
<p>His mind was not quite as realistic and coldly accurate as Caesar’s
or Napoleon’s; he had a passion for metaphysics, and might, if deposed,
have become a mystic recluse. He thought constantly, and was forever
making inventions and suggesting improvements . 06 Like Haroun-al-Rashid
he took nocturnal rambles in disguise, and came back bursting with re-
forms. In the midst of his complex activity he made time to collect a
great library, composed entirely of manuscripts beautifully written
and</p>
<p>Two of his children died in youth of chronic alcoholism.®</p>

<p>engraved by those skilful penmen whom he esteemed as artists fully
equal to the painters and architects that adorned his reign. He despised
print as a mechanical and impersonal thing, and soon disposed of the
choice specimens of European typography presented to him by his Jesuit
friends. The volumes in his library numbered only twenty-four thousand,
but they were valued at ,500,000” by those who thought that such hoards
of the spirit could be estimated in material terms. He patronized poets
without stint, and loved one of them — the Hindu Birbal — so much that
he made him a court favorite, and finally a general; whereupon Birbal
made a mess of a campaign, and was slaughtered in no lyric flight.*”
Akbar had his literary aides render into Persian — which was the
language of his court — the masterpieces of Hindu literature, history
and science, and himself supervised the translation of the interminable
Mahabharata . 10 ° Every art flourished under his patronage and
stimulation. Hindu music and poetry had now one of their greatest
periods; and painting, both Persian and Hindu, reached its second zenith
through his encourage- ment. 101 At Agra he directed the building of the
famous Fort, and within its walls erected (by proxy) five hundred
buildings that his contem-</p>
<p>poraries considered to be among the most beautiful in the world. They
were torn down by the impetuous Shah Jehan, and can be judged only by
such remnants of Akbar’s architecture as the tomb of Humayun at Delhi,
and the remains at Fathpur- Sikri, where the mausoleum of Akbar’s
beloved friend, the ascetic Shaik Salim Chisti, is among the fairest
struc- tures in India.</p>
<p>Deeper than these interests was his penchant for speculation.
This</p>
<p>well-nigh omnipotent emperor secretly yearned to be a philosopher-
much as philosophers long to be emperors, and cannot comprehend the
stupidity of Providence in withholding from them their rightful thrones.
After conquering the world, Akbar was unhappy because he could not
understand it. “Although,” he said, “I am the master of so vast a
kingdom, and all the appliances of government are at my hand, yet since
true great- ness consists in doing the will of God, my mind is not at
ease in this diver- sity of sects and creeds; and apart from this
outward pomp of circum- stance, with what satisfaction, in this
despondency, can I undertake the sway of empire? I await the coming of

in</p>
<p>philosophy have such a charm for me that they distract me from all
else, and I forcibly restrain myself from listening to them lest the
necessary duties of the hour should be neglected .” 108 “Crowds of
learned men from all nations,” says Badaoni, “and sages of various
religions and sects, came to the court and were honored with private
conversations. After inquiries and investigations, which were their only
business and occupation day and night, they would talk about profound
points of science, the subtle- ties of revelation, the curiosities of
history, and the wonders of nature .” 100 “The superiority of man,” said
Akbar, “rests on the jewel of reason.” 10 *</p>
<p>As became a philosopher, he was profoundly interested in
religion.</p>
<p>His careful reading of the Mahabharata, and his intimacy with Hindu
poets and sages, lured him into the study of Indian faiths. For a time,
at least, he accepted the theory of transmigration, and scandalized his
Mos- lem followers by appearing in public with Hindu religious marks on
his forehead. He had a flair for humoring all the creeds: he pleased
the</p>
<p>Zoroastrians by wearing their sacred shirt and girdle under his
clothes, and allowed the Jains to persuade him to abandon hunting, and
to prohibit, on certain days, the killing of animals. When he learned of
the new</p>
<p>religion called Christianity, which had come into India with the
Portuguese occupation of Goa, he despatched a message to the Paulist
missionaries there, inviting them to send two of their learned men to
him. Later some Jesuits came to Delhi and so interested him in Christ
that he ordered his scribes to translate the New Testament . 100 He gave
the Jesuits full free- dom to make converts, and allowed them to bring
up one of his sons. While Catholics were murdering Protestants in
France, and Protestants, under Elizabeth, were murdering Catholics in
England, and the Inquisi- tion was killing and robbing Jews in Spain,
and Bruno was being burned at the stake in Italy, Akbar invited the
representatives of all the religions in his empire to a conference,
pledged them to peace, issued edicts of toleration for every cult and
creed, and, as evidence of his own neutrality, married wives from the
Brahman, Buddhist, and Mohammedan faiths.</p>
<p>His greatest pleasure, after the fires of youth had cooled, was in
the free discussion of religious beliefs. He had quite discarded the
dogmas of Islam, and to such an extent that his Moslem subjects fretted
under his impartial rule. “This king,” St. Francis Xavier reported with
some ex - aggeration, “has destroyed the false sect of Mohammed, and
wholl y dis- credited it. In this city there is neither a mosque nor a
Koran — the book</p>
<p>470 THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION (CHAP. XVI</p>
<p>of their law; and the mosques that were there have been made stables
for horses, and storehouses.” The King took no stock in revelations, and
would accept nothing that could not justify itself with science and</p>
<p>philosophy. It was not unusual for him to gather friends and prelates
of various sects together, and discuss religion with them from Thursday
evening to Friday noon. When the Moslem mullahs and the Christian
priests quarreled he reproved them both, saying that God should be wor-
shiped through the intellect, and not by a blind adherence to supposed
revelations. “Each person,” he said, in the spirit— and perhaps through
the influence — of the Upanishads and Kabir, “according to his condition
gives the Supreme Being a name; but in reality to name the Unknowable is
vain.” Certain Moslems suggested an ordeal by fire as a test of Chris -
tianity vs. Islam: a mullah holding the Koran and a priest holding one
of the Gospels were to enter a fire, and he who should come out unhurt
would be adjudged the teacher of truth. Akbar, who did not like the
mullah who was proposed for this experiment, warmly seconded the sug-
gestion, but the Jesuit rejected it as blasphemous and impious, not to
say dangerous. Gradually the rival groups of theologians shunned these
con- ferences, and left them to Akbar and his rationalist intimates. 1
”</p>
<p>Harassed by the religious divisions in his kingdom, and disturbed by
the thought that they might disrupt it after his death, Akbar finally
de- cided to promulgate a new religion, containing in simple form the
essen- tials of the warring faiths. The Jesuit missionary Bartoli
records the</p>
<p>matter thus:</p>
<p>He summoned a General Council, and invited to it all the mas-</p>
<p>ters of learning and the military commandants of the cities round</p>
<p>about, excluding only Father Ridolfo, whom it was vain to expect
to</p>
<p>be other than hostile to his sacrilegious purpose. When he had them
all assembled in front of him, he spoke in a spirit of astute and</p>
<p>knavish policy, saying:</p>
<p>“For an empire ruled by one head it was a bad thing to have the</p>
<p>members divided among themselves and at variance one with the</p>
<p>other; . . . whence it came about that there are as many factions</p>
<p>as religions. We ought, therefore, to bring them all into one,
but</p>
<p>in such fashion that they should be both ‘one’ and ‘all’; with
the</p>
<p>great advantage of not losing what is good in any one religion, while
gaining whatever is better in another. In that way honor would be</p>
<p>rendered to God, peace would be given to the people, and security</p>
<p>to the empire.”““</p>
<p>CHAP. XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 47 1</p>
<p>The Council perforce consenting, he issued a decree proclaiming him-
self the infallible head of the church; this was the chief contribution
of Christianity to the new religion. The creed was a pantheistic
monotheism in the best Hindu tradition, with a spark of sun and fire
worship from the Zoroastrians, and a semi-Jain recommendation to abstain
from meat. The slaughter of cows was made a capital offense: nothing
could have pleased the Hindus more, or the Moslems less. A later edict
made vege- tarianism compulsory on the entire population for at least a
hundred days in the year; and in further consideration of native ideas,
garlic and onions were prohibited. The building of mosques, the fast of
Ramadan, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and other Mohammedan customs were
banned. Many Moslems who resisted the edicts were exiled. 108 In the
center of the Peace Court at Fathpur-Sikri a Temple of United Religion
was built (and still stands there) as a symbol of the Emperor’s fond
hope that now all the inhabitants of India might be brothers, worshiping
the same God.</p>
<p>As a religion the Din llahi never succeeded; Akbar found tradition
too strong for his infallibility. A few thousand rallied to the new
cult, largely as a means of securing official favor; the vast majority
adhered to their in- herited gods. Politically the stroke had some
beneficent results. The abolition of the head-tax and the pilgrim-tax on
the Hindus, the freedom granted to all religions,* the weakening of
racial and religious fanaticism, dogmatism and division, far outweighed
the egotism and excesses of Akbar’s novel revelation. And it won him
such loyalty from even the</p>
<p>Hindus who did not accept his creed that his. prime purpose —
political unity — was largely achieved.</p>
<p>With his own fellow Moslems, however, the Dm llahi was a source of
bitter resentment, leading at one time to open revolt, and stirring
Prince Jehangir into treacherous machinations against his father. The
Prince complained that Akbar had reigned forty years, and had so strong
a con- stitution that there was no prospect of his early death. Jehangir
organized an army of thirty thousand horsemen, killed Abu- 1 Fazl, the
King’s court historian and dearest friend, and proclaimed himself
emperor. Akbar per- suaded the youth to submit, and forgave him after a
day; but the disloy- alty of his son, added to the death of his mother
and his friend, broke his spirit, and left him an easy prey for the
Great Enemy. In his last days his children ignored him, and gave their
energies to quarreling for his throne. Only a few intimates were with
him when he died — presumably</p>

away without the benefit of the prayers of any church or sect.” 1 ” No
crowd followed his simple funeral; and the sons and courtiers who had
worn mourning for the event discarded it the same evening, and rejoiced
that they had inherited his kingdom. It was a bitter death for the
justest and wisest ruler that Asia has ever known.</p>

<p>The coming of the British</p>
<p>The children who had waited so impatiently for his death found it
diffi- cult to hold together the empire that had been created by his
genius. Why is it that great men so often have mediocrities for their
offspring? Is it because the gamble of the genes that produced them —
the com- mingling of ancestral traits and biological possibilities — was
but a chance, and could not be expected to recur? Or is it because the
genius exhausts in thought and toil the force that might have gone to
parentage, and leaves only his diluted blood to his heirs? Or is it that
children decay under ease, and early good fortune deprives them of the
stimulus to ambition and growth?</p>
<p>Jehangir was not so much a mediocrity as an able degenerate. Born of
a Turkish father and a Hindu princess, he enjoyed all the opportunities
of an heir apparent, indulged himself in alcohol and lechery, and gave
full vent to that sadistic joy in cruelty which had been a recessive
char- acter in Babur, Humayun and Akbar, but had always lurked in
the</p>
<p>Tatar blood. He took delight in seeing men flayed alive, impaled,
or</p>
<p>torn to pieces by elephants. In his Memoirs he tells how, because
their careless entrance upon the scene startled his quarry in a hunt, he
had a groom killed, and the groom’s servants hamstrung— i.e., crippled
for life by severing the tendons behind the knees; having attended to
this, he says, “I continued hunting .” 110 When his son Khusru conspired
against him he had seven hundred supporters of the rebel impaled in a
line along the streets of Lahore; and he remarks with pleasure on the
length of time it took these men to die . 111 His sexual life was
attended to by d harem of six thousand women ,“ 4 and graced by his

<p>wife, Nur Jehan* — whom he acquired by murdering her husband. His
administration of justice was impartial as well as severe, but the
extrava- gance of his expenditures laid a heavy burden upon a nation
which had become the most prosperous on the globe through the wise
leadership of Akbar and many years of peace.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his reign Jehangir took more and more to his cups,
and neglected the tasks of government. Inevitably conspiracies arose to
replace him; already in 1622 his son Jehan had tried to seize the
throne. When Jehangir died Jehan hurried up from the Deccan where he had
been hiding, proclaimed himself emperor, and murdered all his brothers
to ensure his peace of mind. His father passed on to him his habits of
extravagance, intemperance and cruelty. The expenses of Jehan’s court,
and the high salaries of his innumerable officials, absorbed more and
more of the revenue produced by the thriving industry and commerce of
the people. The religious tolerance of Akbar and the indifference of
Jehan- gir were replaced by a return to the Moslem faith, the
persecution of Christians, and the ruthless and wholesale destruction of
Hindu shrines.</p>
<p>Shah Jehan redeemed himself in some measure by his generosity to his
friends and the poor, his artistic taste and passion in adorning India
with the fairest architecture that it had ever seen, and his devotion to
his wife Mumtaz Mahal — “Ornament of the Palace.” He had m arried her in
his twenty-first year, when he had already had two children by an
earlier consort. Mumtaz gave her tireless husband fourteen children in
eighteen years, and died, at the age of thirty-nine, in bringing forth
the last.</p>
<p>Shah Jehan built the immaculate Taj Mahal as a monument to her mem-
ory and her fertility, and relapsed into a scandalous licentiousness. 5
“ The most beautiful of all the world’s tombs was but one of a hundred
master - pieces that Jehan erected, chiefly at Agra and in that new
Delhi which grew up under his planning. The costliness of these palaces,
the luxurious- ness of the court, the extravagant jewelry of the Peacock
Throne, t would</p>

Palace.” Jehangir means “Conqueror of the World”; Shah Jehan , of
course, was “King of the World.” fThis throne, which required seven
years for its completion, consisted entirely of jewels, precious metals
and stones. Four legs of gold supported the seat; twelve pillars made of
emeralds held up the enameled canopy; each pillar bore two peacocks
encrusted with gems; and between each pair of peacocks rose a tree
covered with diamonds, emer- alds, rubies and pearls. The total cost was
over ,000,000. The throne was captured and carried off to Persia by
Nadir Shah (1739), and was gradually dismembered to defray the expenses
of Persian royalty. 114</li>

<p>suggest a rate of taxation ruinous to India. Nevertheless, though one
of the worst famines in India’s history occurred in Shah Jehan’s reign,
his thirty years of government marked the zenith of India’s prosperity
and prestige. The lordly Shah was a capable ruler, and though he wasted
many lives in foreign war he gave his own land a full generation of
peace. As a great British administrator of Bombay, Mountstuart
Elphinstone, wrote,</p>
<p>those who look on India in its present state may be inclined to
sus-</p>
<p>pect the native writers of exaggerating its former prosperity,
but</p>
<p>the deserted cities, ruined palaces and choked-up aqueducts which</p>
<p>we still see, with the great reservoirs and embankments in the midst
of jungles, and the decayed causeways, wells and caravanserais of</p>
<p>the royal roads, concur with the evidence of contemporary trav-</p>
<p>elers in convincing us that those historians had good grounds for</p>
<p>their commendation. 1 “</p>
<p>Jehan had begun his reign by killing his brothers; but he had
neglected to kill his sons, one of whom was destined to overthrow him.
In 1657 the ablest of these, Aurangzeb, led an insurrection from the
Deccan. The Shah, like David, gave instructions to his generals to
defeat the rebel army, but to spare, if possible, the life of his son.
Aurangzeb overcame all the forces sent against him, captured his father,
and imprisoned him in the Fort of Agra. For nine bitter years the
deposed king lingered there, never visited by his son, attended only by
his faithful daughter Jahanara, and spending his days looking from the
Jasmine Tower of his prison across the Jumna to where his once-beloved
Mumtaz lay in her jeweled tomb.</p>
<p>The son who so ruthlessly deposed him was one of the greatest saints
in the history of Islam, and perhaps the most nearly unique of the Mogul
emperors. The mullahs who had educated him had so imbued him with
religion that at one time the young prince had thought of renouncing the
empire and die world, and becoming a religious recluse. Throughout his
life, despite his despotism, his subtle diplomacy, and a conception of
morals as applying only to his own sect, he remained a pious Moslem,
reading prayers at great length, memorizing the entire Koran, and
warring against infidelity. He spent hours in devotion, and days in
fasts. For the most part he practised his religion as earnestly as he
professed it. It is true that in politics he was cold and calculating,
capable of lying cleverly for his country and his god. But he was the
least cruel of the Moguls, and</p>
<p>CHAP.XVl) FROM ALEXANDER TO AURANGZEB 47 mildest; slaughter abated in
his reign, and he made hardly any use of punishment in dealing with
crime. He was consistently humble in deport- ment, patient under
provocation, and resigned in misfortune. He ab- stained scrupulously
from all food, drink or luxury forbidden by his</p>
<p>faith; though skilled in music, he abandoned it as a sensual
pleasure; and apparently he carried out his resolve to spend nothing
upon himself save what he had been able to earn by the labor of his
hands. 110 He was a St. Augustine on the throne.</p>
<p>Shah Jehan had given half his revenues to the promotion of archi-</p>
<p>tecture and the other arts; Aurangzeb cared nothing for art,
destroyed its ’’heathen” monuments with coarse bigotry, and fought,
through a reign of half a century, to eradicate from India almost all
religions but his</p>
<p>own. He issued orders to the provincial governors, and to his other
sub- ordinates, to raze to the ground all the temples of either Hindus
or Chris- tians, to smash every idol, and to close every Hindu school.
In one year (1679-80) sixty-six temples were broken to pieces in Amber
alone, sixty- three at Chitor, one hundred and twenty- three at Udaipur”
1 and over the site of a Benares temple especially sacred to the Hindus
he built, in de- liberate insult, a Mohammedan mosque. 118 He forbade
all public worship of the Hindu faiths, and laid upon every unconverted
Hindu a heavy capitation tax. 118 As a result of his fanaticism,
thousands of the temples which had represented or housed the art of
India through a millennium were laid in ruins. We can never know, from
looking at India today, what grandeur and beauty she once possessed.</p>
<p>Aurangzeb converted a handful of timid Hindus to Islam, but he</p>
<p>wrecked his dynasty and his country. A few Moslems worshiped him as a
saint, but the mute and terrorized millions of India looked upon him as
a monster, fled from his tax-gatherers, and prayed for his death. Dur-
ing his reign the Mogul empire in India reached its height, extending
into the Deccan; but it was a power that, had no foundation in the
affection of the people, and was doomed to fall at the first hostile and
vigorous touch. The Emperor himself, in his last years, began to realize
that by the very narrowness of his piety he had destroyed the heritage
of his fathers. His deathbed letters are pitiful documents.</p>
<p>I know not who I am, where I shall go, or what will happen to</p>
<p>this sinner full of sins. . . . My years have gone by profitless.

<p>you. 1 ”</p>
<p>He left instructions that his funeral should be ascetically simple,
and that no money should be spent on his shroud except the four rupees
that he had made by sewing caps. The top of his coffin was to be covered
with a plain piece of canvas. To the poor he left three hundred rupees
earned by copying the Koran . m He died at the age of eighty-nine,
having long out- stayed his welcome on the earth.</p>
<p>Within seventeen years of his death his empire was broken into frag-
ments. The support of the people, so wisely won by Akbar, had been
forfeited by the cruelty of Jehangir, the wastefulness of Jehan, and the
intolerance of Aurangzeb. The Moslem minority, already enervated by
India’s heat, had lost the military ardor and physical vigor of their
prime, and no fresh recruits were coming from the north to buttress
their de- clining power. Meanwhile, far away in the west, a little
island had sent its traders to cull the riches of India. Soon it would
send its guns, and take over this immense empire in which Hindu and
Moslem had joined to build one of the great civilizations of
history.</p>
