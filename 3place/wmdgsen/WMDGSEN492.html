<h4 id="chapter-xxiii">CHAPTER XXIII</h4>
<p>Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p>1509-29</p>
<p>I. A PROMISING KING: 1509-II</p>
<p>N O one, beholding the youth who mounted the throne of England in
1509, would have foreseen that he was to be both the hero and the
villain of the most dramatic reign in English history. Still a lad of
eighteen, his fine complexion and regular features made him almost
girlishly attractive; but his athletic figure and prowess soon canceled
any appearance of feminin- ity. Foreign ambassadors vied with native
eulogists in praising his auburn hair, his golden beard, his “extremely
fine calf.” “He is extremely fond of tennis,” reported Giustiniani to
the Venetian Senate; “it is the prettiest thing in the world to see him
play, his fair skin glowing through a shirt of finest texture.” 1 In
archery and wrestling he equaled the best in his kingdom; at the hunt he
never seemed to tire; two days a week he gave to jousts — and there only
the Duke of Suffolk could match him. But he was also an ac- complished
musician, “sang and played all kinds of instruments with rare</p>
<p>The intellectual classes rejoiced too, for in those halcyon days
Henry aspired to be a scholar as well as an athlete, a musician, and a
king. Originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, he became
something of a theologian, and could quote Scripture to any purpose. He
had good taste in art, col- lected with discrimination, and wisely chose
Holbein to immortalize his paunch. He took an active part in works of
engineering, shipbuilding, forti- fication, and artillery. Sir Thomas
More said of him that he “has more learn - ing than any English monar ch
ever possessed before him” 2 — no high praise. “What may we not expect,”
More continued, “from a king who has been</p>
<p>523</p>
<p>524 the reformation (chap.xxih</p>
<p>nourished by philosophy and the nine Muses? ” 3 Mountjoy wrote
ecstatically to Erasmus, then in Rome:</p>
<p>What may you not promise yourself from a prince with whose</p>
<p>extraordinary talent and almost divine character you are well ac-</p>
<p>quainted? But when you know what a hero he now shows himself,</p>
<p>how wisely he behaves, what a lover he is of justice and
goodness,</p>
<p>what affection he bears to the learned, I venture to swear that you
will need no wings to make you fly to behold this new and auspicious</p>
<p>star. Oh, my Erasmus, if you could see how all the world here is
re-</p>
<p>joicing in the possession of so great a prince, how his life is all
their</p>
<p>desire, you would not contain your tears for joy. The heavens laugh,
the earth exults. 4</p>
<p>Erasmus came, and for a moment shared the delirium. “Heretofore,” he
wrote, “the heart of learning was among such as professed religion. Now,
while these for the most part give themselves up to the belly, luxury,
and money,* the love of learning is gone from them to secular princes,
the court, and the nobility. . . . The King admits not only such men as
More to his court, but he invites them — forces them — to watch all that
he does, to share his duties and his pleasures. He prefers the
companionship of men like More to that of silly youths or girls or the
rich.” B More was one of the King’s Council, Linacre was the King’s
physician, Colet was the King’s preacher at St. Paul’s.</p>
<p>In the year of Henry’s accession Colet, inheriting his father’s
fortune, used much of it to establish St. Paul’s School. Some 150 boys
were c hosen to study, there, classical literature and Christian
theology and ethics. Colet violated tradition by staffing the school
with lay teachers; it was the first non- clerical school in Europe. The
“Trojans,” who at Oxford inveighed against the teaching of the classics
on the ground that it led to religious doubt, op- posed Colet’s program,
but the King overruled them and gave Colet full encouragement. Though
Colet was himself orthodox and a model of piety, his enemies charged him
with heresy. Archbishop Warham silenced them, and Henry concurred. When
Colet saw Henry bent on war with France, he publicly condemned the
policy, and declared, like Erasmus, that an un- just peace was to be
preferred to the justest war. Even with the King sitting in the
congregation Colet denounced war as flying in the face of the precepts
of Christ. Henry privately begged him not to disrupt the morale of the
army, but when the King was urged to depose Colet he answered: “Let
everyone have his own doctor . . . this m an is the doctor for me.” 6
Colet continued • But J£rasmus T ecclesiastical friends, Dean Colet,
Bishop Fisher of Rochester, and Arch - bishop Warham of Canterbury, were
generous and devoted friends of learning.</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 525</p>
<p>to take Christianity seriously. To Erasmus he wrote (1517) in the
spirit of Thomas a Kempis:</p>
<p>Ah, Erasmus, of books of knowledge there is no end; but there is</p>
<p>nothing better for this short term of ours than that we should live a
pure and holy life, and daily do our best to be cleansed and
enlight-</p>
<p>ened … by the ardent love and imitation of Jesus. Wherefore it is</p>
<p>my most earnest wish that, leaving all indirect courses, we may pro-
ceed by a short method to the Truth. Farewell. 7</p>
<p>In 1518 he prepared his own simple tomb, with only Johannes Coletus
in- scribed on it. A year later he was buried in it, and many felt that
a saint had passed away.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>WOLSEY</li>
</ol>
<p>Henry, who was to become the incarnation o f Machiavelli’s Prince,
was as yet an innocent novice in international politics. He recognized
his need for guidance, and sampled the men around him. More was
brilliant, but only thirty-one, and inclined to sanctity. Thomas Wolsey
was a mere three years older, and was a priest, but his whole turn was
for statesmanship, and reli- gion was for him a part of politics. Born
at Ipswich, “of low extraction and despicable blood” (so the proud
Guicciardini described him), 8 Thomas had covered the baccalaureate
course at Oxford by the age of fifteen; at twenty- three he was bursar
of Magdalen College, and showed his quality by apply- ing adequate
funds, beyond his authority, for the completion of that hall’s most
majestic tower. He knew how to get along. Displaying a flair for
management and negotiation, he rose through a succession of
chaplainships to serve Henry VII in that capacity and in diplomacy.
Henry VIII, on ac- cession, made him almoner — director of charities.
Soon the priest was a member of the Privy Council, and shocked
Archbishop Warham by advo- cating a military alliance with Spain against
France. Louis XII was invading Italy, and might again make the papacy a
dependency of France; in any case France must not become too strong.
Henry yielded in this matter to Wolsey and his own father-in-law,
Ferdinand of Spain; he himself was at this time inclined to peace. “I
content myself with my own,” he - told Giustiniani; “I wish to command
only my own subjects; but on the other hand I do not choose that anyone
shall have it in his power to command me”; 9 this almost sums up Henry’s
political career. He had inherited the claim of the English kings to the
crown of France, but he knew that this was an empty pretense. The war
petered out quickly in the Battle of the Spurs (1513). Wolsey arranged
the peace, and persuaded Louis XII to marry Henry’s sister Mary. Leo X,
pleased with being rescued, made Wolsey Archbishop of York</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>■ (CHAP, xxth</p>
<p>526</p>
<ol start="1514" type="1">
<li>and Cardinal (1515); Henry, triumphant, made him Chancellor (1^15).
The King prided himself on having protected the papacy; and when a later
pope refused him a marriage easement he deemed it gross
ingratitude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first five years of Wolsey’s ch ancellorship were among the most
successful in the record of English diplomacy. His aim was to organize
the peace of Europe by using England as a makeweight to preserve a
balance of power between the Holy Roman Empire and France; presumably it
also entered into his purview that he would thus become the arbiter of
Europe, and that peace on the Continent would favor England’s vital
trade with the Netherlands. As a first step, he negotiated an alliance
between France and England (1518), and betrothed He nry’s two -year-old
daughter Mary (later queen) to the seven-month- old son of Francis I.
Wolsey’s taste for lavish entertainment revealed itself when French
emissaries came to London to sign the agreements; he feted them in his
Westminster palace with a dinner “the like of which,” reported
Giustiniani, “was never given by Cleopatra or Caligula, the whole
banqueting hall being decorated with huge vases of gold and silver.” 10
But the worldly Cardinal could be forgiven; he was playing for high
stakes, and he won. He insisted that the alliance should be open to
Emperor Maximilian I, King Charles I of Spain, and Pope Leo X; they were
invited to join; they accepted; and Erasmus, More, and Colet thrilled
with the hope that an era of peace had dawned for all Western
Christendom. Even Wolsey’s enemies congratulated him. He took the
opportunity to bribe 11 English agents in Rome to secure his appointment
as papal legate a latere in Britain; the phrase meant “on the side,”
confidential, and was the highest designation of a papal emissary.
Wolsey was now supreme head of the English Church, and — with strategic
obeisances to Henry — ruler of Eng- land.</p>
<p>The peace was clouded a year later by the rivalry of Francis I and
Charles 1 for the Imperial throne; even Henry thought of flinging his
beret into the ring, but he had no Fugger. The winner, as now Charles V,
briefly visited England (May 1520), paid his respects to his aunt
Catherine of Aragon, Henry’s Queen, and offered to marry Princess Mary
(alr eady betrothed to the Dauphin) if England would promise to support
Charles in any future conflict with France; so unnatural is peace.
Wolsey refused, but accepted a pension of 7,000 ducats from the Emperor,
and drew from him a pledge to help him in becoming pope.</p>
<p>The brilliant Cardinal achieved his most spectacular triumph in the
meet- ing of the French and English sovereigns on the Field of the Cloth
of Gold (June 1520) . Here, in an open space between Guines and Ardres
near Calais, medieval art and chivalry displayed themselves in sunset
magnificence. Four thousand English noblemen, chosen and placed by the
Cardinal and dressed in the silks, flounces, and lace of late medieval
costume, accompanied Henry</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 527</p>
<p>as the young red-bearded King rode on a white palfrey to meet Francis
I; and not last or least came Wolsey himself, clad in crimson satin
robes rival- ing the splendor of the Kings. An impromptu palace had been
built to re- ceive their Majesties, their ladies, and their staffs; a
pavilion covered with gold-threaded cloth and hung with costly
tapestries shaded the conference and the feasts; a fountain ran wine;
and space was cleared for a royal tourna- ment. The political and
marital alliance of the two nations was confirmed. The happy monarchs
jousted, even wrestled; and Francis risked the peace of Europe by
throwing the English King. With characteristic French grace he repaired
his faux pas by going, early one morning, unarmed and with a few unarmed
attendants, to visit Henry in the English camp. It was a gesture of
friendly trust which Henry understood. The monarchs exchanged precious
gifts and solemn vows.</p>
<p>In truth neither could trust the other, for it is a lesson of history
that men lie most when they govern states. From seventeen days of
festivities with Francis, Henry went to three days of conference with
Charles at Calais (July</p>
<p>1520). There King and Emperor, chaperoned by Wolsey, swore eternal
friendship, and agreed to proceed no further with their plans to marry
into the royal family of France. These separate alliances were a more
precarious basis for European peace than the multilateral entente that
Wolsey had arranged before Maximilian’s death, but it still left England
in the position of mediator and, in effect, arbiter — a position far
loftier than any that could be based on English wealth or power. Henry
was satisfied. To reward his Chan- cellor he ordered the monks of
St. Albans to elect Wolsey as their abbot and dower him with their net
revenue, for “my Lord Cardinal has sustained many charges in this his
voyage.” The monks obeyed, and Wolsey’s income neared his needs.</p>
<p>He was, on a grander scale than most of us, a fluid compound of
virtues and faults. “He is very handsome,” wrote Giustiniani, “extremely
eloquent, of vast ability, and indefatigable.” 12 His morals were
imperfect. Twice he slipped into illegitimate parentage; these were
peccadilloes readily over- looked in that lusty age; but, if we may
believe a bishop, the Cardinal suffered from the “pox.” 13 He accepted
what might or might not be called bribes— large gifts of money from both
Francis and Charles; he kept them bidding against each other with the
pensions and benefices that they offered him; these were courtesies of
the time; and the expensive Cardinal, who felt that his policies were
serving all Europe, felt that all Europe should serve him. Beyond doubt
he loved money and luxury, pomp and power. A large part of his income
went to maintain an establishment whose surface extravagance may have
been a tool of diplomacy, designed to give foreign ambassadors an
exaggerated notion of English resources. Henry paid Wolsey no salary, so
that the Chancellor had to live and entertain on his ecclesiastical
revenues</p>
<p>528 THE REFORMATION ( CHAP. XXIII</p>
<p>and his pensions from abroad. Even so we may marvel that he should
have required all the income that came to him as holder of two
rectories, six pre- bends, one provostship, as Abbot of St. Albans,
Bishop of Bath and Wells, Archbishop of York, administrator of the
diocese of Winchester, and a partner of the absentee Italian bishops of
Worcester and Salisbury. 14 He dis- posed of nearly all the major
ecclesiastical and political patronage of the realm, and presumably each
appointment yielded him a gratuity. A Catholic historian has estimated
that Wolsey at his zenith received a third of all the ecclesiastical
revenues of England. 15 He was the richest and most powerful subject in
the nation; “seven times more powerful than the pope,” thought
Giustiniani; 16 he is, said Erasmus, “the second king.” Only one step
more remained to be taken — the papacy. Twice Wolsey tried for it, but
in that game the wily Charles, ignoring promises, outplayed him.</p>
<p>The Cardinal believed that ceremony is the cement of power; force can
gain power, but only public habituation can cheaply and peaceably
sustain it; and people judge a man’s altitude by the ceremony that
hedges him in. So in his public and official appearances Wolsey dressed
in the formal splendor that seemed to him advisable in the supreme
representative of both pope and king. Red hat of a cardinal, red gloves,
robes of scarlet or crimson taffeta, shoes of silver or gilt inlaid with
pearls and precious stones — here were Innocent III, Benjamin Disraeli,
and Beau Brummel all in one. He was the first clergyman in England who
wore silk. 1T When he said Mass (which was seldom) he had bishops and
abbots as his acolytes; and on some occasions dukes and earls poured out
the water with which he washed his consecrating hands. He allowed his
attendants to kneel in waiting upon him at table. Five hundred persons,
many of high lineage, served him in his office and his home. 18 Hampton
Court that he built as his residence was so luxurious that he presented
it to the King ( 1 5 2 5 ) to avert the evil eye of royal jealousy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, he forgot that Henry was king. “On my first
arrival in England,” Giustiniani wrote to the Venetian Senate, “the
Cardinal used to say to me, ‘His Majesty will do so and so.’
Subsequently, by degrees, he forgot himself, and commenced saying, ‘We
shall do so and so.’ At present he . . . says, ‘I shall do so and so.’”
19 And again the ambassador wrote: “If it were necessary to neglect
either King or Cardinal, it would be better to pass over the King; the
Cardinal might resent precedence conceded to the King.” 20 Peers and
diplomats seldom obtained audience with the Chancellor until their third
request. With each passing year the Cardinal ruled more and more openly
as a dictator; he called Parliament only once during his ascend- ancy;
he paid little attention to constitutional forms; he met opposition with
resentment and criticism with rebuke. The historian Polydore Vergil
wrote that these methods would bring Wolsey’s fall; Vergil was sent to
the Tower;</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIII ) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 529</p>
<p>and only repeated intercession by Leo X secured his release.
Opposition grew.</p>
<p>Perhaps those whom Wolsey superseded or disciplined secured the ear
of history, and transmitted his sins unabsolved. But no one questioned
his ability, or his assiduous devotion to his many tasks. “He transacts
as much business,” Giustiniani told the proud Venetian Senate, “as that
which occupies all the magistracies, offices, and councils of Venice,
both civil and criminal; and all state affairs are likewise managed by
him, let their nature be what they may.” 21 He was loved by the poor a
nd hated by the powerful for his impar- tial administration of justice;
almost beyond any precedent in English history after Alfred, he opened
his court to all who complained of oppression, and he fearlessly
punished the guilty, however exalted. 22 He was generous to scholars and
artists, and began a religious reform by replacing several monas- teries
with colleges. He was on the way to a stimulating improvement of English
education when all the enemies he had made in the haste of his labors
and the myopia of his pride conspired with a royal romance to engineer
his fall.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li>WOLSEY AND THE CHURCH</li>
</ol>
<p>He recognized and largely exemplified the abuses that still survived
in the ecclesiastical life of England: absentee bishops, worldly
clergymen, idle monks, and priests snared into parentage. The state,
which had so often called for a reform of the Church, was now part cause
of the evils, for the bishops were appointed by the kings. Some bishops,
like Morton and Warham and Fisher, were men of high character and
caliber; many others were too ab- sorbed in the comforts of prelacy to
train their clergy in spiritual fitness as well as financial assiduity.
The sexual morality of the curates was probably better than in Germany,
but among the 8,000 parishes of England there were inevitably cases of
sacerdotal concubinage, adultery, drunkenness, and crime —enough to make
Archbishop Morton say (i486) that “the scandal of their lives imperiled
the stability of their order.” 23 Richard Foxe, toward 1519, in- formed
Wolsey that the clergy in the diocese of Winchester were “so de - praved
by license and corruption” that he despaired of any reformation in his
lifetime. 24 The parish priests, suspecting that their promotion
depended on their collections, were more than ever exacting of tithes;
some took a tenth, each year, of the peasant’s chickens, eggs, milk,
cheese, and fruit, even of all wages paid to his help; and any man whose
will left no legacy to the Church ran high risk of being denied
Christian burial, with prospective results too horrible to contemplate.
In short the clergy, to finance their services, taxed almost as
sedulously as the modem state. By 1 500 the Church owned, on a
conservative Catholic estimate, about a fifth of all property in</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>530</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>England. 25 The nobility, here as in Germany, envied this
ecclesiastical wealth, and itched to recover lands and revenues
alienated to God by their pious or fearful ancestors.</p>
<p>The condition of the secular clergy in England was summed up with</p>
<p>obvious exaggeration by Dean Colet in an address to an assembly of
church- men in 1512:</p>
<p>I wish that at length, mindful of your name and profession, you</p>
<p>would consider the reformation of ecclesiastical affairs; for never
was it more necessary. . . . For the Church — the spouse of Christ —
which He wished to be without spot or wrinkle, is become foul and
de-</p>
<p>formed. As saith Isaiah, “The faithful city is become a harlot”;
and</p>
<p>as Jeremia h speaks, “She hath committed fornication with many</p>
<p>lovers,” whereby she hath conceived many seeds of iniquity, and</p>
<p>daily bringeth forth the foulest of offspring. . . . Nothing has so
dis-</p>
<p>figured the face of the Church as the secular and worldly living
on</p>
<p>the part of the clergy. . . . What eagerness and hunger after
honor</p>
<p>and dignity are found in these days among ecclesiastical persons!</p>
<p>What a breathless race from benefice to benefice, from a less to
a</p>
<p>greater one! . . .</p>
<p>As to lust of the flesh, has not this vice inundated the Church
with</p>
<p>a flood … so that nothing is more carefully sought after … by the</p>
<p>most part of priests, than that which ministers to sensual
pleasure?</p>
<p>They give themselves to feasting and banqueting . . . devote
them-</p>
<p>selves to hunting and hawking, are drowned in the delights of
this</p>
<p>world</p>
<p>Covetousness also . . . has so taken possession of the hearts of
all</p>
<p>priests . . . that nowadays we are blind to everything but that
alone</p>
<p>which seems able to bring us gain. . . . We are troubled in these
days by heretics — men mad with strange folly; but this heresy of theirs
is not so pestilential and pernicious to us and the people as the
vicious and depraved lives of the clergy. . . . Reformation must begin

<p>The regular or monastic clergy incurred even severer censure.
Archbishop Morton in 1489 charged Abbot William of St. Albans with
“simony, usury, embezzlement, and living publicly and continuously with
harlots and mis- tresses within the precincts of the monastery and
without”; he accused the</p>
<p>chap. XXin) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 53 1</p>
<p>monks of “a life of lasciviousness . . . nay, of defiling the holy
places, even the very churches of God, by infamous intercourse with
nuns,” making a neighboring priory “a public brothel.” 28 The records of
episcopal visitations paint a less lurid picture. Of forty-two
monasteries visited between 1517 and 1530 fifteen were found without
serious fault, and in most of the others the offenses were against
discipline rather than chastity. 29 Some monasteries still faithfully
practiced the medieval regimen of prayer, scholarship, hospitality,
charity, and education of the young. Some exploited the credulity — and
gathered the coins — of the commons by bogus relics to which they
ascribed miraculous cures; bishops complained of the “stin king boots,
mucky combs . . . rotten girdles . . . locks of hair, and filthy rags …
set forth and commended unto the ignorant people” as authentic relics of
holy women or men. 30 All in all, in the estimate of the latest Catholic
historian, the 600 monasteries of England, in the first quarter of the
sixteenth century, showed widespread misconduct, wasteful idleness, and
a costly negligence in the care of ecclesi- astical property. 31</p>
<p>In 1520 there were some 130 nunneries in England. Only four had over
thirty inmates. 32 Eight were suppressed by the bishops, in one case,
said the bishop, because of “the dissolute disposition and incontinence
of the religious women of the house, by re ason of the vicinity of
Cambridge University.” 33 In thirty-three visitations of twenty-one
nunneries in the diocese of Lincoln, sixteen reports were favorable;
fourteen noted lack of discipline or devotion; two told of prioresses
living in adultery, and one found a nun pregnant by a priest. 34 Such
deviations from arduous rules were natural in the moral cli- mate of the
times, and may have been outweighed by kindly services in edu- cation
and charity.</p>
<p>The clergy were not popular. Eustace Chapuys, Catholic ambassador of
Charles V to England, wrote to his master in 1529: “Nearly all the
people hate the priests.” 35 Many men fully orthodox in creed denounced
the severity of ecclesiastical taxation, the extravagance of the
prelates, the wealth and idleness of the monks. When the chancellor of
the bishop of London was accused of murdering a heretic (1514), the
bishop begged Wolsey to pre- vent trial by a civil jury, “for assured I
am, if my chancellor be tried by any twelve men in London, they be so
maliciously set in favor of heretical pravity that they will cast and
condemn my clerk though he were as innocent as Abel.” 36</p>
<p>Heresy was rising again. In 1 50 6 forty-five men were charged with
heresy before the bishop of Lincoln; forty-three recanted, two were
burned. In 1510 the bishop of London tried forty heretics, burned two;
in 1521 he tried forty-five and burned five. The records list 342 such
trials in fifteen years. 37 Among the heresies were contentions that the
consecrated Host remains merely bread; that priests have no more power
than other men to consecrate</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>53 *</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>or absolve; that the sacraments are not necessary to salvation; that
pilgrimages to holy shrines, and prayer for the dead, are worthless;
that prayers should be addressed only to God; that man can be saved by
faith alone, regardless of good works; that the faithful Christian is
above all laws but that of Christ; that the Bible, not the Church,
should be the sole rule of faith; that all men should marry, and that
monks and nuns should repudiate their vows of chas- tity. Some of these
heresies were echoes of Lollardry, some were reverbera- tions of
Luther’s trumpet blasts. As early as 1521 young rebels in Oxford eagerly
imported news of the religious revolution in Germany. Cambridge in
1521-25 harbored a dozen future heresiarchs: William Tyndale, Miles
Coverdale, Hugh Latimer, Thomas Bilney, Edward Fox, Nicholas Ridley,
Thomas Cranmer. . . . Several of them, anticipating persecution,
migrated to the Continent, printed anti-Catholic tracts, and sent them
clandestinely into England.</p>
<p>Possibly as a deterrent to this movement, and perhaps to display his
theo- logical erudition, Henry VIII issued in 1521 his famous Assertion
of the Seven Sacraments against Martin Luther. Many thought Wolsey the
secret author, and Wolsey may have suggested the book and its leading
ideas as part of his diplomacy at Rome; but Erasmus claimed that the
King had actu- ally thought out and composed the treatise, and opinion
now inclines to that view. The book has the ring of a tyro; it hardly
attempts a rational refutation, but relies on Biblical quotations,
Church traditions, and vigorous abuse. “What serpent so venomous,” wrote
the future rebel against the papacy, “as he who calls the pope’s
authority tyrannous? . . . What a great limb of the Devil he is,
endeavoring to tear the Christian members of Christ from their head!” No
punishment could be too great for one who “will not obey die Chief
Priest and Supreme Judge on earth,” for “the whole Church is subject not
only to Christ but … to Christ’s only vicar, the pope of Rome.” 88 Henry
envied the honorific titles given by the Church to the king of France as
“Most Christian,” and to Ferdinand and Isabella as “the Catholic
Sovereigns”; now his agent, presenting the book to Leo X, asked him to
confer on Henry and his successors the title Defensor Fidei — Defender
of the Faith. Leo con- sented; and the inaugurator of the English
Reformation placed the words upon his coins.</p>
<p>Luther took his time answering. In 1525 he replied characteristically
to that “lubberly ass,” that “frantic madman . . . that King of Lies,
King Hein z,</p>
<p>by God’s disgrace King of England Since with malice aforethought
that</p>
<p>damnable and rotten worm has lied against my King in heaven it is
right for me to bespatter this English monarch with his own filth.” 89
Henry, unac - customed to such sprinkling, complained to the Elector of
Saxony, who was too polite to tell him not to meddle with lions. The
King never forgave</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIXl) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 533</p>
<p>Luther, despite the latter’s later apology; and even when in full
rebellion against the papacy he repudiated the German Protestants.</p>
<p>Luther’s most effective answer was his influence in England. In that
same year 1525 we hear of a London “Association of Christian Brothers,”
whose paid agents went about distributing Lutheran and other heretical
tracts, and English Bibles in part or whole. In 1408 Archbishop Arundel,
disturbed by the circulation of Wyclif’s version of the Scriptures, had
forbidden any vernacular translation without episcopal approval, on the
ground that an unauthorized version might misconstrue difficult
passages, or color the ren- dering to support a heresy. Many clergymen
had discouraged the reading of the Bible in any form, arguing that
special knowledge was necessary to a right interpretation, and that
Scriptural excerpts were being used to foment sedition. 40 The Church
had raised no official objection to pre-Wyclif trans- lations, but this
tacit permission had been of no moment, since all English versions
before 1526 were manuscript. 41</p>
<p>Hence the epochal importance of the English New Testament printed by
Tyndale in 1525-26. Early in his student days he had planned to
translate the Bible, not from the Latin Vulgate as Wyclif had done, but
from the original Hebrew and Greek. When an ardent Catholic reproved
him, saying, “It would be better to be without God’s law”— i.e., the
Bible — “than without the pope’s,” Tyndale answered: “If God spare me
life, ere many years I will cause the boy that driveth the plow to know
more of the Scripture than you do.” 42 A London alderman gave him bed
and board for six months, while the youth labored on the task. In 1524
Tyndale went to Wittenberg, and con- tinued the work under Luther’s
guidance. At Cologne he began to print his version of the New Testament
from the Greek text as edited by Erasmus. An English agent roused the
authorities against him; Tyndale fled from Catholic Cologne to
Protestant Worms, and there printed 6,000 copies, to each of which he
added a separate volume of notes and aggressive prefaces based on those
of Erasmus and Luther. All these copies were smuggled into England, and
served as fuel to the incipient Protestant fire. Cuthbert Tun- stall,
Bishop of London, alleging serious errors in the translation, prejudice
in the notes, and heresies in the prefaces, tried to suppress the
edition by buying all discoverable copies and publicly burning them at
St. Paul’s Cross; but new copies kept coming from the Continent, and
More commented that Tunstall was financing Tyndale’s press. More h
imself wrote a lengthy Dia- logue (1528) criticizing the new version;
Tyndale replied; More replied to the reply in a Confutation of 578 folio
pages. The King thought to quiet the disturbance by forbidding the
reading or circulation of the Bible in English until an authoritative
translation could be made (1530). Meanwhile all printing, sale,
importation, or possession of heretical works was banned by the
government.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>Wolsey sent orders to arrest Tyndale, but Philip, Landgrave of Hesse,
protected the author, and he proceeded, at Marburg, with his translation
of the Pentateuch (1530). Slowly, by his own labor or under his
supervision, most of the Old Testament was rendered into English. But in
a careless mo- ment he fell into the hands of Imperial officials; he was
imprisoned for sixteen months at Vilvorde (near Brussels), and was
burned at the stake (1536) despite the intercession of Thomas Cromwell,
minister to Henry VIII. T radi- tion reports his last words as “Lord,
ope the King of England’s eyes.” 43 He had lived long enough to
accomplish his mission; the plowboy could now hear the Evangelists tell
in firm, clear, pithy English the inspiring story of Christ. When the
historic Authorized Version appeared ( 1 6 1 1 ) , 90 per cent of the
greatest and most i nfl uential classic in English literature was
unaltered Tyndale. 44</p>
<p>Wolsey’s attitude toward this nascent English Reformation was as
lenient as could be expected of a man who headed both Church and state.
He hired secret police to spy out heresy, to examine suspicious
literature, and to arrest heretics. But he sought to persuade these to
silence rather than to punish them, and no heretic was ever sent to the
stake by his orders. In 1528 three Oxford students were jailed for
heresy; the bishop of London allowed one to die in confinement; one
recanted and was released; the third was taken in charge by Wolsey, and
was allowed to escape. 45 When Hugh Latimer, the most eloquent of the
early Reformers in sixteenth-century England, de- nounced the
deterioration of the clergy, and the bishop of Ely asked Wolsey to
suppress him, Wolsey gave Latimer license to preach in any church in the
land.</p>
<p>The Cardinal had an intelligent plan for Church reform. “He despised
the clergy,” according to Bishop Burnet, “and in particular … the monks,
that did neither the Church nor state any service, but were through
their scandalous lives a reproach to the Church and a burden to the
state. There- fore he resolved to suppress a great number of them, and
to change them to another institution.” 46 To close a malfunctioning
monastery was not un - heard of; it had been done by ecclesiastical
order in many instances before Wolsey. He began (1519) by issuing
statutes for the reform of the canons regular of St. Augustine; if these
rules were followed the canons became quite exemplary. He commissioned
his secretary, Thomas Cromwell, to visit the monasteries in person or
through agents, and to report the conditions found; these visitations
made Cromwell a practiced hand in later executing Henry’s orders for a
severer scrutiny of England’s conventual life. Com - plaints were heard
of the harshness of these agents, of their receiving or exacting
“gifts,” and of their sharing these with Cromwell and the Cardinal. 47
In 1524 Wolsey obtained permission from Pope Clement VII to close such
monasteries as had less than seven inmates, and to apply the revenues of
these</p>
<p>CHAP.XXIIl) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 535</p>
<p>properties to establishing colleges. He was happy when these funds
enabled him to open a college in his native Ipswich and another at
Oxford. He hoped to continue this process, to close more monasteries
year by year and replace them with colleges. 48 But his good intentions
were lost in the confusion of politics, and the chief result of his
monastic reforms was to provide Henry with a respectable precedent for a
more extensive and lucrative scheme.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Cardinal’s foreign policy had come to grief. Perhaps be
- cause he sought the Emperor’s support for election to the papacy
(1521,</p>
<p>1523), he allowed England to join Charles in war with France (1522).
The English campaigns were unsuccessful and expensive in money and
lives. To finance fresh efforts Wolsey summoned (1523) the first
Parliament in seven years, and shocked it by asking an unprecedented
subsidy of £ 800,000 — a fifth of every lay man’s property. The Commons
protested, then voted a seventh; the clergy protested, but yielded half
a year’s revenue from every benefice. When news came that Charles’s army
had overwhelmed the French</p>
<p>Now Charles was the nephew of Catherine of Aragon, from whom Henry
earnestly desired a divorce; and Clement VII, who could grant it for
reasons of state, was in person and policy a captive of Charles.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>THE king’s “divorce”</li>
</ol>
<p>Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, came to
England in 1501, aged sixteen, and married (November 14) Arthur, aged
fifteen, oldest son of Henry VII. Arthur died on April 2, 1502. It was
generally assumed that the marriage had been consummated; the Spanish
ambassador dutifully sent “proofs” thereof to Ferdinand; and Arthur’s
title, Prince of Wales, was not officially transferred to his younger
brother Henry till two months after Arthur’s death. 40 But Catherine
denied the consummation. She</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>had brought with her a dowry of 200,000 ducats (,000,000?). Loath to
let Catherine go back to Spain with these ducats, and anxious to renew a
marital alliance with the powerful Ferdinand, Henry VII proposed that
Catherine should marry Prince Henry, though she was the lad’s elder by
six years. A Biblical passage (Lev. 20:21) forbade such a marriage: “If
a man shall take his brother’s wife it is an unclean thing . . . they
shall be childless.” Another passage, however, ruled quite the contrary:
“If brethren dwell to - gether, and one of them die, and have no child .
. . her husband’s brother . . . shall take h er to him to wife” (Deut.
25:5). Archbishop Warham con - demned the proposed union; Bishop Fox of
Winchester defended it if a papal dispensation could be obtained from
the impediment of affinity. Henry VII applied for the dispensation; Pope
Julius II granted it (1503). Some canonists questioned, some affirmed,
the papal power to dispense from a Biblical precept, 60 and Julius
himself had some doubts. 61 The betrothal — in effect a legal marriage —
was made formal (1503), but as the bridegroom was still only twelve,
cohabitation was postponed. In 1505 Prince Henry asked to have the
marriage annulled as having been forced upon him by his father, 62 but
he was prevailed upon to confirm the union as in the interest of
England; and in 1509, six weeks after his accession, the marriage was
pub- licly celebrated.</p>
<p>Seven months later (January 31, 1510) Catherine bore her first child,
which died at birth. A year thereafter she bore a son; Henry rejoiced in
a male heir who would continue the Tudor line; but in a few weeks the
infant died. A second and third son succumbed soon after birth (1513,
1514). Henry began to think of a divorce — or, more precisely, an
annulment of his marriage as invalid. Poor Catherine tried again, and in
1516 she gave birth to the future Queen Mary. Henry relented; “if it was
a daughter this time,” he told himself, “by the grace of God the sons
will follow.” 63 In 1 5 1 8 Catherine</p>
<p>Henry had long since lost taste for her as a woman. He was now
thirty- four, in the prime of lusty manhood; she was forty, and looked
older than</p>
<p>CHAP.XXin) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 537</p>
<p>her years. She had never been alluring, but her frequent illnesses
and misfor- tunes had deformed her body and darkened her spirit. She
excelled in culture and refinement, but husbands have seldom found
erudition charming in a wife. She was a good and faithful spouse, loving
her husband only next to Spain. She thought of herself as — for a time
she was — Spanish envoy, and she argued that England should always side
with Ferdinand or Charles. About 1518 Henry took his first-known
post-marriage mistress, Elizabeth Blount, sister of Erasmus’ friend
Mountjoy. She gave him a son in 1 5 19; Henry made the boy Duke of
Richmond and Somerset, and thought of entailing the suc- cession to him.
About 1 524 he took another mistress, Mary Boleyn; 85 indeed, Sir George
Throckmorton accused him to his face of adultery with Mary’s mother,
too. 56 It was an unwritten law of the times that royalty, if married
for reasons of state rather than choice, might seek outside of marriage
the romance that had missed the legal bed.</p>
<p>In or before 1527 Henry turned his charm upon Mary’s sister Anne.
Their father was Sir Thomas Boleyn, a merchant and diplomat long favored
by the King; their mother was a Howard, daughter of the Duke of Norfolk.
Anne was sent to Paris as a finishing school; there she was made a
lady-in-waiting to Queen Claude, then to Marguerite of Navarre, from
whom she may have imbibed some Protestant leanings. Henry could have
seen her as a vivacious girl of thirteen at the Field of the Cloth of
Gold. Returning to England at fifteen (1522), she became lady-in-waiting
to Queen Catherine. She was not strikingly beautiful; she was short,
with dark complexion, broad mouth, and long neck; but Henry and others
were lured by her flashing black eyes, her flowing brown hair, her grace
and wit and gaiety. She had some ardent lovers, including Thomas Wyatt
the poet, and Henry Percy, future Earl of Northumberland; her enemies
later charged that she had been clandestinely married to Percy before
she set her sights on the King; the evidence is incon- clusive. 67 We do
not know when Henry began to court her; the earliest of his extant love
letters to her is conjecturally assigned to July 1527.</p>
<p>What was the relation of this romance to Henry’s petition for the
annul - ment of his marriage? Unquestionably he had thought of this as
far back as 1514, when Anne was a girl of seven. He seems to have put
the notion aside till 1524, when, according to his own account, he
ceased to have conjugal relations with Catherine. 88 The earliest
recorded proceedings for an annul- ment were taken in March 1527, long
after Henry’s acquaintance with Anne, and about the time that she
replaced her sister in the bosom of the King. Wolsey was apparently
unaware of any royal intention to marry Anne when, in July 1527, he went
to France partly to arrange a union between Henry and Renee, that
daughter of Louis XII who was soon to make a Prot- estant stir in Italy.
The first known ref erence to Henry’s intention is in a letter sent on
August 16, 1 527, by the Spanish ambassador informing Charles</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>(chap, xxm</p>
<p>V of a general belief in London that if the King obtained a “divorce”
he would marry “a daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn”; 59 this could hardly
have meant Mary Boleyn, for by the end of 1527 Henry and Anne were
living in neighboring apartments under the same roof in Greenwich. 60 We
may con- clude that Henry’s suit for annulment was accelerated, thoug h
hardly caused, by his infatuation with Anne. The basic cause was his
desire for a son, to whom he might transmit the throne with some
confidence in a peaceful suc- cession. Practically all England shared
that hope. The people remembered with horror the many years (1454-85) of
war between the houses of York and Lancaster for the crown. The Tudor
dynasty was but forty-two years old in 1527; its title to the throne was
dubious; only a legitimate and direct male heir to the King could
continue the dynasty unchallenged. If Henry had never met Anne Boleyn he
would still have desired and deserved a di- vorce and an adequately
fertile wife.</p>
<p>Wolsey agreed with the King on this point, and assured him that a
papal annulment could be readily obtained; the papal power to grant such
separa- tions was generally accepted as a wise provision for precisely
such national needs, and many precedents could be adduced. But the busy
Cardinal had reckoned without two disagreeable developments: Henry
wanted not Renee but Anne, and the annulment would have to come from a
pope who, when the problem reached him, was a prisoner of an emperor who
had plentiful cause for hostility to Henry. Probably Charles would have
opposed the annulment as long as his aunt resisted it, and all the more
if a new marriage, such as Wolsey planned, would ally England firmly
with France. The proxi- mate cause of the English Reformation was not
the climbing beauty of Anne Boleyn but the obstinate refusal of
Catherine and Charles to see the justice of Henry’s desire for a son;
the Catholic Queen and the Catholic Emperor collaborated with the
captive Pope to divorce England from the Church. But the ultimate cause
of the English Reformation was not Henry’s suit for annulment so much as
the rise of the English monarchy to such strength that it could
repudiate the authority of the pope over English affairs and
revenues.</p>
<p>Henry affirmed that his active desire for an annulment was occasioned
by Gabriel de Grammont, who came to England in February 1527, to discuss
the proposed marriage of Princess Mary with French royalty. Grammont,
according to Henry, raised a question as to Mary’s legitimacy, on the
ground that Henry’s marriage with Catherine might have been invalid as
violating a Scriptural ban irremovable by a pope. Some have thought that
Henry in- vented the story, 61 but Wolsey repeated it, it was reported
to the French government (1528), it was not (so far as is known) denied
by Grammont, and Grammont labored to persuade Clement that Henry’s suit
for annulment was just. Charles informed his ambassador in England (July
29, 1527) that he was advising Clement to deny Hen ry’s plea.</p>
<p>CHAP.XXin) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 539</p>
<p>While he was in France Wolsey was definitely informed that Henry</p>
<p>wished to marry not Renee but Anne. He continued to work for the
annul- ment, but he did not hide his chagrin over Henry’s choi ce.
By-passing his Chancellor, the King, in the fall of 1527, sent his
secretary, William Knight, to present two requests to the captive Pope.
The first was that Clement, recognizing the doubtful validity of Henry’s
marriage, its lack of male issue, an d Catherine’s unwillingness to be
divorced, should allow Henry to have two wives. A last-minute order from
Henry deterred Knight from present- ing this proposal; Henry’s audacity
had abated; and he must have marveled when, three years later, he
received from Giovanni Casale, one of his agents in Rome, a letter dated
September 1 8, 1 530, saying, “A few days ago the Pope secretly proposed
to me that your Majesty might be allowed two wives.” 62 Henry’s second
request was quite as strange: that the Pope should grant him a
dispensation to marry a woman with whose sister the King had had sexual
relations. 63 The Pope agreed to this on condition that the marriage
with Catherine should be annulled; but as to this annulment he was not
yet ready to decide. Clement was not only fearful of Charles; he was
reluctant to rule that a previous pope had made a serious error in
validating the marriage. At the end of 1527 he received a third request
— that he should appoint Wolsey and another papal legate to sit as a
court in England, to hear evidence, and to pass judgment on the validity
of Henry’s marriage with Catherine. Clement complied (April 13, 1528),
named Cardinal Campeggio to sit with Wolsey in London, and promised — in
a bull to be shown only to Wolsey and Henry — to confirm whatever
decision the legates should render. 64 Probably the fact that Henry had
joined Francis (January 1528) in declaring war on Charles and pledging
themselves to liberate the Pope affected Clem ent’s compliance.</p>
<p>Charles protested, and sent to Clement a copy of a document which he
claimed had been found in Spanish archives, and in which Julius II
confirmed as valid the dispensation that Henry and Wolsey proposed to
void. At his wits’ end the Pope, still a prisoner of Charles, rushed
instructions to Campeg- gio “not to pronounce sentence without express
commission hence. … If so great an injury be done to the Emperor, all
hope is lost of universal peace, and the Church cannot escape utter
ruin, as it is entirely in the power of the Emperor’s servants. . . .
Delay as much as possible.” 65</p>
<p>On Campeggio’s arrival in England (October 1528) he tried to secure
Catherine’s consent to retire to a nunnery. She agreed, on condition
that Henry should take monastic vows. But nothing could be further from
Henry’s mind than poverty, obedience, and chastity; however, he
suggested that he would take these vows if the Pope would promise to
release him from them on demand. Campeggio refused to transmit this
proposal to the Pope. Instead he reported (February 1529) the King’s
determination to marry Anne. “This passion,” he wrote, “is a most
extraordinary thing. He sees</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>54O</p>
<p>(chap. XXIII</p>
<p>nothing, he thinks of nothing, but his Anne; he cannot be without her
for an hour. It moves me to pity to see how the King’s life, the
stability and downfall of the whole country hang upon this one
question.” 66</p>
<p>Changes in the military situation turned the Pope more and more
against Henry’s proposal. The French army that Henry had helped to
finance failed in its Italian campaign, leaving the Pope completely
dependent upon the Emperor. Florence expelled its ruling Medici — and
Clement was as devoted to that family as Charles to the Hapsburgs.
Venice took advantage of the Pope’s impotence to snatch Ravenna from the
Papal States. Who now could rescue the papacy except its captor? “I have
quite made up my mind,” said Clement (June 7, 1529), “to become an
Imperialist, and to live and die as such.” 67 On June 29 he signed the
Treaty of Barcelona, by which Charles promised to restore Florence to
the Medici, Ravenna to the papacy, and liberty to Clement; but one
condition was that Clement would never agree to the annulment of
Catherine’s marriage without Catherine’s free consent. On August 5
Francis I signed the Treaty of Cambrai, which in effect sur- rendered
Italy and the Pope to the Emperor.</p>
<p>On May 3 1 Campeggio, having delayed as long as possible, opened with
Wolsey the legatine court to hear Henry’s suit. Catherine, having
appealed to Rome, refused to acknowledge the competence of the court. On
June 2 1, however, both King and Queen attended. Catherine threw herself
on her knees before him, and made a moving plea for the continuance of
their mar- riage. She reminded him of their many labors, her complete
fidelity, her patience with his extramural sports; she took God to
witness that she had been a maid when Henry married her; and she asked,
in what had she of- fended him? 68 Henry raised her up, and assured her
that he wished nothing so earnestly as that their marriage had been
successful; he explained that his reasons for separation were not
personal but dynastic and national; and he rejected her appeal to Rome
on the ground that the Emperor controlled the Pope. She withdrew in
tears, and refused to take further part in the proceed- ings. Bishop
Fisher spoke in her defense, thereby earning the enmity of the King.
Henry demanded a clear decision from the court. Campeggio procras-
tinated skillfully, and finally (July 23, 1529) adjourned the court for
the summer vacation. To make indecision more decisive Clement “revoked”
the case to Rome.</p>
<p>Henry raged. Feeling that Catherine had been unreasonably obstinate,
he refused to have anything more to do with her, and spent his pleasure
hours openly with Anne. Probably to this period belong most of the
seventeen love letters that Cardinal Campeggio spirited away from
England, 69 and which the Vatican Library preserves among its literary
treasures. Anne, wise in the ways of men and kings, had apparently given
him as yet only encouragement and titillation; now she complained that
her youth was passing while cardi-</p>
<p>CHAP. XXIIl) HENRY VIII AND CARDINAL WOLSEY 54.I</p>
<p>nals, who could not understand the desire of a maid for a well-to-do
man, dallied over Henry’s right to adorn desire with a marriage tie. She
blamed Wolsey for not pressing Henry’s appeal with more resolution and
dispatch; and the King shared her resentment.</p>
<p>Wolsey had done his best, though his heart was not in the matter. He
had sent money to Rome to bribe the cardinals, 70 but Charles had sent
money too, and an army to boot. The Cardinal had even connived at the
idea of bigamy, 71 as Luther would do a few years afterward. Yet Wolsey
knew that Anne and her influential relatives were maneuvering for his
fall. He tried to appease her with dainty viands and costly gifts, but
her hostility grew as the annul- ment issue dragged on. He spoke of her
as “the enemy that never slept, both studied and continually imagined,
both sleeping and waking, his utter de- struction.” 72 He foresaw that
if the ann ulment should be granted Anne would be queen and would ruin
him; and that if it were not granted Henry would dismiss him as a
failure, and would demand an account of his steward- ship, in painful
financial detail.</p>
<p>The King had many reasons for dissatisfaction with his Chancellor.
The foreign policy had collapsed, and the turn from friendship with
Charles to alliance with France had proved disastrous. Hardly a man in
England now had a good word to say for the once omnicompetent Cardinal.
The clergy hated him for his absolute rule; the monks feared more
dissolution of monas- teries; the commons hated him for taking their
sons and money to fight futile wars; the merchants hated him because the
war with Charles obstructed their trade with Flanders; the nobles hated
him for his exactions, his upstart pride, his proliferating wealth. Some
nobles, reported the French ambassador (October 17, 1529), “intend, when
Wolsey is dead or destroyed, to get rid of the Church, and spoi l the
goods of the Church and Wolsey both.” 78 Kentish clothiers suggested
that the Cardinal should be installed in a leaking boat and set adrift
in the sea. 74</p>
<p>Henry was subtler. On October 9, 1529, one of his attorneys issued a
writ summoning Wolsey to answer, before the King’s judges, a charge that
his acts as legate had violated the Statute of Praemunire ( 1 392 ),
which imposed forfeiture of goods upon any Englishman who brought papal
bulls into England. It made no difference that Wolsey had secured the
legatine author- ity at the King’s request, 75 and had used it chiefly
in the King’s behalf. Wol - sey knew that the King’s judges would
convict him. He sent in to Henry a humble submission, confessing his
failures, but begging him to remember also his services and his loyalty.
Then he left London by a barge on the Thames. At Putney he received a
kindly message from the King. In abject gratitude he knelt in the mud
and thanked God. Henry appropriated the rich contents of the Cardinal’s
palac e at Whitehall, but allowed him to retain the archbishopric of
York, and enough personal goods to require 160 horses</p>

<p>and 72 carts to haul them to his episcopal seat. 76 The Duke of
Norfolk suc- ceeded Wolsey as prime minister; Thomas More succeeded him
as chancellor (November 1529).</p>
<p>For almost a year the fallen Cardinal served as a pious and exemplary
archbishop, visiting his parishes regularly, arranging the repair of
churches, and acting a s a trusted court of arbitration. “Who was less
loved in the north than my Lord the Cardinal before he was amongst
them?” asked a Y orkshire - man, “and who better beloved after he had
been there awhile?” 77 But ambi - tion reawoke in him as the fear of
death subsided. He wrote letters to Eustace Chapuys, the Imperial
ambassador to England; they are lost, but a report from Chapuys to
Charles reads: “I have a letter from the Cardinal’s physi - cian, in
which he tells me that his master . . . thought the Pope should proceed
to weightier censures, and should call in the secular arm” 78 — i.e.,
excommuni- cation, invasion, and civil war. Norfolk got wind of these
exchanges, arrested Wolsey ’s physician, and drew from him, by means
uncertain, a confession that the Cardinal had advised the Pope to
excommunicate the King. We do not know if the Ambassador or the Duke
honestly reported the physician, or if the physician truthfully reported
the Cardinal. In any case Henry, or the Duke, ordered Wolsey ’s arre

<p>He submitted peaceably (November 4, 1530), bade farewell to his
house- hold, and set out for London. At Sheffield Park a severe
dysentery confined him to bed. There the King’s soldiers came with
orders to conduct him to the</p>
